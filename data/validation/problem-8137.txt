She rubbed her head. "It doesn't hurt."
accept it, then what did it say about who he really was?
"Probably," Rhodey said, completely oblivious to the tumult going on in Tony's mind. "So, how's it working for you two? Are you taking his name?"
"And did you get your most desired toy?"
"No, it's fine.
"I'll think about it."
"I didn't say she doesn't. I've seen the pics of you as a kid. She's you with blonde hair. The attitude's all wrong, but I can't deny she looks like you."
"I don't even know who or what you're talking about," Bruce said, and Hill and Natasha voiced their agreement with him. Tony rolled his eyes again and said another pissy, "Whatever," before he added, "Are we done here?"
JARVIS was quiet a moment before he said, "
He shook his head and waved off his concern. "Nothing. Never mind."
But Tony just scratched at his expertly-groomed jaw and said, "The Avengers…aren't exactly the same. I mean, we've got an actual Norse god on the team. OK, he's an alien, but the Scandinavians thought he was a god. Then we've got the Spy Twins, the one-armed assassin, the android, the witch, the giant, green rage-monster, the War Machine, your jogging buddy, and those bugs from out west — sometimes. I guess you'd call it an eclectic group."
Tony put the tablet down and set the carafe back in the maker to brew up another pot, and after he'd dumped in a fresh supply of grounds and water, he went over to where Steve sat at the island, hunched over a tablet as he scanned through the data gleaned from the mission. Tony put his hands on his shoulders and began to rub and said, "How'd it go? Sorry I couldn't, you know, even join you remotely. You could have woken me up."
this building and
Steve nodded and said their thanks, and he motioned for Tony to lead them in. Tony rolled his eyes but stepped into the small office, and he took a seat in one of the chairs situated in front of the desk. Steve sat down in the chair beside him, and Tony checked his watch and crossed and uncrossed his legs and drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair and—
Steve smiled his relieved thanks at him and went off to tell Barnes the good news.
But god, something about it just didn't seem
That did it.
"Does it matter?"
to head over there?"
"I understand that, Tony—"
Barnes was quiet a moment before he said, "Wait, was this the one you rescued from the bottom of the ocean or something?"
He took two steps on but then spun around and stepped right back off.
"Isn't that right, baby girl?" he added, and the little girl said a quiet, "Yeah," as she held fast to the two little plush dolls in her hands and kicked her legs out in front of her.
"Tony, you were just knocked out with a sedative Hydra used on you in their attempt to kidnap you. You're awake now, but it's still in your system, and I think it would be a good idea to hold off on nursing for a while — just a couple hours or so. Just until it's mostly out of your system."
He swatted at his shoulder. "Head out of the gutter, Captain. I meant Italian

"So long as you were attesting to the fact that you are, in fact, Anthony Stark," the main clerk said.
spoiled. What did you have in mind?"
electric guitars."
this—"
"No. I just know it."
"She's your daughter, Tony."
He marked 'Caucasian' for both sides, went through the list of genetic risk factors and didn't see anything that he thought matched him or Steve (the pre-serum Steve, not the post-serum slice of beefcake) then went down to the section that asked about the father. He snorted a laugh, jotted down '37' for the father's age and then, where it asked for the father's health status and medical issues was very, very tempted to write 'government experiment from the '40s that survived being frozen in a glacier for 70 years — you tell me' but instead just wrote 'excellent/no issues' because, well, right

disgruntled programmer.
Clint shook his head before he pulled the tablet up and began to swipe at it. "Got some intel on Loki's magic glow stick." He swiped to another screen, and Tony leaned over to see what it was. "Seems to have fallen into the hands of someone called Baron von Strucker."
"Yeah, turns out the 'official' record of what Captain America and the Howling Commandos got up to during the war is only the half of it. I swear to god he mentioned something about vampires once or twice."
"Tony, he's not—"
He went over to the elevator, mumbling something Tony couldn't understand, and Tony called after him, "Oh, don't be like that, pumpkin patch! You think we're adorable together!"
"Further inland, we think," Hill said and pulled up the next possible list of targets — the ones that made sense based upon the previous systematic disruption of the grid. Tony, chewing another bite of his bagel, tried to follow along and make sense of what he was seeing, but his back was aching a little bit, and as he began to rub at it, Barton got up from his chair and motioned for Tony to sit down. Tony grumbled out a thanks and sat down, heavily and maybe a tad bit petulantly because contrary to all his bravado, he actually wasn't feeling so great. More than that, though, he was irritated that Steve wasn't going to be fulfilling his duties any time soon. Hydra, those sons-of- bitches, had made sure of that, and as soon as Tony could concentrate on something more challenging than a game of computer solitaire, he was going to write up an algorithm to root out every one of these fuckers and take them to task for having the gall to interrupt his time with Steve.
"He's pretty, but he's not an idiot."
"Duly noted. 'But now' what?"
He had
"Hey, our teammate was just Rule 63'd. Again. I think I'm allowed to point out how crazy that is."
"Yeah, well," Barton said and grabbed a slice of toast from the stacked pile on the tabletop, "you could do a better job of showing it."
"It's not the 1950s anymore, babe."
Steve.
"—that means I'm harboring some deep-down, desperate crush on him. Uh, hate to burst your bubble, goeduck, but I'm not. The guy's an uptight ass with a really nice, tight ass you could bounce a fucking quarter off of."
Steve, weak man that he was, just fixated on the way Tony's breasts bounced as he slammed his hands on the table and made his demand. Though he was and had always been attracted to both men and women, he'd always thought himself maybe just a little more attracted to men. But seeing Tony, female, naked, and standing there before him was upending all of his previously established conventional wisdom. At that moment, he thought he'd never seen anyone or anything more attractive than Tony Stark with soft curves and long hair and generous breasts, and he swallowed and wiped his suddenly sweaty palms on the uniform pants he'd yet to change out of, the material suddenly much too tight and much too stifling for comfort.
"The hell you went to all this trouble for boiled potatoes and corned beef. And don't give me any of that shit about it being the food of your people. You're from Brooklyn. The food of your people is egg creams and hotdogs. And you bullshit you meant 'food'—"
"Clearly, you would make a terrible spy," she mused and took a sip of the punch.
"Baby girl," he said as he reached into the cabinet, "you tell Bruce about this, and I'll take you right back out of the will I haven't had a chance to put you into yet."
Tony glanced pointedly down at his abdomen. "Not to mention over a year's worth of super soldier semen being pumped into me on a regular basis. I'm just saying, if you tested my blood right now, you'd probably find trace amounts of the serum floating around my veins."
"Yeah huh. Fine, babe," he said, frozen with two fingers scissored inside of him. "Go back to sleep."
"Tony, what happened to your wrist?" Bruce asked, but Tony just reiterated a 'goodnight' and continued up the steps to his bedroom.
He stood straight and facing the mirror, and he watched as Steve bowed his head and brushed the tip of his nose against Tony's shoulder before he kissed the spot and added, "When you were...in your other form, you were beautiful. I mean you were absolutely stunning. But what made you feel like you were still
Bucky nodded his agreement, and Tony hummed again and said, "You're right. It is a very tight ass. Deliciously tight. Bounce-a-quarter-off-it tight. Want-to-sink-your-teeth-in-it—"
"You mean when you got back from your vacation?" Tony said.
"What?" Steve asked and glanced down at himself.
the definition of 'troll'?"
He stopped short when he realized they weren't alone, and it was at that moment that Rhodey, for whatever reason, felt it safe to enter the room, and it was Rhodey who broke the silence and said, "Oh, you've got to be kidding me."
He could

He finally seemed to get his resting pulse rate down to something manageable after a good fifteen minutes, and by that time, Olivia had fallen back to sleep, cradled as she was against his chest. Doing his best not to jostle her, he set her back down in the bed and pulled up the covers, and he brushed his lips over her forehead and bid her 'goodnight' before he got up and squinted at his watch to try to make out the time.
"You do know there's still such a thing as habeas corpus, right?"

Tony Stark. There
"Good Lord," he said with a laugh, "Howard would never believe it. Me, being that important to the universe."
Steve just growled and reached down as though to rip it off of him, but Tony cried out, "No! Don't rip it! I may want to wear this again!"
She let out a tiny laugh. "I don't think Steve would be the type to talk out his feelings to a psychiatrist no matter what era he was born in. Steve plays it close to the vest, but he has his tells. It's in his eyes. When he's dealing with something he doesn't want to deal with or when he's put in a situation he doesn't want to be in or when he starts getting a little lost, his eyes go a little flat. I might even say 'dead.' He can't hide it in his eyes."
Steve motioned to his barely-touched plate. "Eat. I already have a couple bags packed for us. We'll… I know a place we can go for the weekend."
a God, he hated him that much—
to me first. Look, I… Maybe Obie did say something to me. Maybe he did talk about you and that you were only with me for the money, and maybe I did — just for one second — wonder if he was right. Because why else would you be with me? What else could you possibly see in me? And then you started to act funny, and I didn't know what was going on, and I got scared. I admit it. I got scared. And then you… And then you left, and I didn't know why. I went to your friends. Did they tell you that? I went to them and made an asshole out of myself crying onto them and begging them to tell me what I did wrong. Because they would know. Of course they would know. They were your friends. But they didn't know, and I just…"
the baby's born. Until we know that everything's OK." He reached out and put his hand over Tony's belly. "Until we know for absolute certain that it's a boy."
Tony just picked up the cup and looked at it. "No, that can't be right."
"Steve and I still horrible people that had no business being in a relationship together?"
"Hey, you mentioned it. Not me. I just wonder what you've got to be so insecure about—"
Yawning, he padded into the kitchen and saw Steve sitting at the island, the entire order spread out in front of him, takeout boxes and plastic containers, all of which had clearly been dipped into by the fork in Steve's hand. He glanced up as Tony entered, and he looked almost abashed as he said, "Hey," and went back to his food.
Rhodey put his hands up in defense. "I already know how to dance, man."
"How's that info on Strucker coming?" Steve asked Barton in lieu of telling him to go stuff it, for some reason.
"No," Steve said with a slight shake of the head, hand still splayed over Tony's abdomen. "Just… don't have anything to add to that."
, I guess I'd say."
"I'll still love you, and I'll still be attracted to you."
Tony heaved out a breath and looked up at the ceiling — at the sheetrock and spackle that hadn't yet been covered and the very dim recessed lighting that he was pretty sure had been picked out by Pepper.
"I know," he said with a heavy sigh and went over to the couch. He collapsed onto it, and Steve collapsed beside him before he pulled him into a tight, warm embrace, and they cuddled for a moment before Tony said, "How should we do it?"
Tony considered this a moment, sitting back down in his chair as he did so. "So…you're saying he thinks I'm his perfect partner?"
Tony dropped his hands. "OK, well, I still expect to be given them." He looked at Wilson. "You! What'd you bring me back?"
As Olivia gurgled and waved her tiny arms in the air, the pediatrician just smiled at Tony and said, "That's
"You said a couple of bad language words there, kiddo. Don't think I didn't hear them."
Steve rolled his eyes and scrambled up from his hiding spot. "Look, just cover me until he leaves, all right? He doesn't…he doesn't need to know."
Tony scoffed. "What?
"Goodnight," Steve said, his arm around Tony, his hand splayed over Tony's belly.
"Sparkling grape juice?" he asked with a lopsided smile.
She just hugged her tablet to her chest some and said, "Well, you care a lot about each other."
that?"
"That's the version everyone knows. Are you sure?" Tony stepped a little further into the room and frowned at Steve.
Tony scoffed. "Please. I won't fall asleep."
He was very, very tempted to scrawl out 'got knocked up by a super soldier,' but he didn't think Steve would approve of that and, plus, as
"You sure?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. Are
"It wasn't—" Tony started to say automatically.
"Absolutely positive?"
He took off in a confident stride, and Barnes glanced back at Wilson and said, "This is all your fault," before he got up and followed after Steve, but not before he pulled Wilson off the couch to drag him along with him, Wilson groaning the whole way and saying something about 'his show' coming on soon.
"Hmm? Oh, like writing out a check but more instantaneous and without having to stand there and write the whole thing out then waiting for it to go through the system and whatever. Debits your bank account—" he snapped his fingers, or at least he
Steve was quiet a moment, and Tony took it as Steve coming to terms with what Tony had just said, before he spoke in so low and calming and authoritative a voice that Tony had no choice but to believe every word he uttered.
Tony turned to Steve and went to hand the baby over to him, but Steve just leaned down and brushed his lips against Tony's, soft, sweet, and maybe a touch wanton if the way he nipped at and then ran the tip of his tongue against his lower lip meant anything.
"And what the fuck do you mean 'not much pain'?" He looked back down at his tablet. "Says right here women that have never done this before usually have more pain
Steve groaned. "Are you in the mood to help me with this?"
"What?" Tony asked but dared not look at what he was reading. He didn't want to know.
— for a while. He'd been fantasizing about calling him 'Antonia' and telling him 'good girl' when he did something that he approved of. He wanted to treat Tony as a woman, as though he'd actually been born a woman, and that—
"What?" Natasha asked, legs tucked underneath her as she sat on an adjacent chair. "Wanting to have a little fun with you guys? One night apart isn't going to kill you."
"I'm so glad you've caught up to commercial tag lines in your education of modern popular culture."
Steve sat down in the chair adjacent to Tony, and he grabbed what was left of the eggs and the last two slices of bacon.
She picked up the phone and dialed an extension, and as she murmured to somebody about something, Tony looked to Steve and said, "Wait, whoa,
he all but snarled at her, spitting the word 'Papa' out like it tasted of poison. "I am never going to
Esmeralda inhaled a deep breath through her nose and drew her finger away from her lips. She folded her arms and drummed the fingers of her right hand against the upper part of her left arm, her long fingernails glittering in the light.
She shrugged. "Conceivably, yes."
"You ever wanted to get with this sweet ass again, you would have."
Tony made a 'hmm' sound but shrugged. "I don't know, but they do exist. Heard the term bandied about by the board from time-to-time when I was in my not-so-great period and they thought I'd get drunk and get married in Vegas to some prostitute looking for a quick payout." He pushed closer to Steve and added, "Surprised they weren't pushing me to take any and all precautions with
Esmeralda — evidently not-dead Esmeralda — frowned when she sensed that Tony was on-guard about something. "I'm not going to hurt her. I just want to see."
a mouthful," Steve said with a sagely nod, but Tony patted his arm.
"And would you?" Tony asked.
"Yeah, I know, but I can't help it. It's how I feel. It's
He shrugged again but didn't say anything to that, instead telling Rhodey, "Sorry. About tonight, I mean. Didn't we have plans to—?"
! Not his dick," he countered when he realized they'd all — even Barnes — taken it the other way.
"Oh, no!" Tony said and pointed a finger at him. "Don't you do this. Don't you take this all on yourself. I was in on that just as much as you were."
"My mother was Italian," he said by way of explanation, and the others just nodded their understanding.
Tony tilted his head at her, making a face like he wasn't sure how to take her words, as Barnes said, "I'm gonna say 'no,'" evidently in answer to Tony's question.
"And people think I'm the sex-obsessed one," he murmured and closed his eyes a moment. Huh, it actually felt kind of good to relax his eyes.
Steve stared at him, and Tony could tell his pride had been wounded just the slightest, his lips pursed and his eyes slightly squinted in a defensive manner. He blinked several times and darted his gaze around the room, flexing his hands a few times as he took a deep breath presumably to calm himself. Finally, he seemed to resign himself to whatever it was he was thinking, exhaling the breath and ducking his head some so his chin nearly touched his chest.
He waved the smoke away and leaned down to tend to the woman, who groaned and scrunched her face up as she put a hand to her head and said, "Well, that's the last time I slam down scotch with a bourbon chaser."
"Oh! Right!"
The doctor made a 'hmm' sound and said, "Is that something… I mean, I'm sure you don't know. Bruce didn't seem to have an answer for it, either."
"Breakfast," Steve said as he found what was presumably a mixing bowl. There was a large scatter of ingredients of some kind on the island countertop ahead of him, and he looked up from where he was reading something on his phone and said, "Sorry. Did I wake you?"
bloodstream, but not only was he not sure if that counted, he wasn't sure if he wanted that information on the record, either.
," Tony said to Steve. "I'm ninety-nine percent sure I know what's going on in that defrosted brain of yours, and, no, I'm not marrying 'Captain America.' Yeah, he's awesome, but he's not really… I'm marrying Steve Rogers, end of story. I want to marry Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers is as awesome as Captain America but without all that annoying baggage."
, Tony'd been overcome with such an intense need to have Steve inside of him — in places he couldn't even begin to explain — and Steve had felt likewise. He'd hoisted Tony up and tossed him back onto the table, and they'd kissed and grunted and writhed, and Steve had pulled the under armor off and pushed his legs back and, after freeing himself from his pants, pushed inside of Tony. Tony had gasped at a slight pinch of pain — he later assumed Steve had 'taken his virginity' — that subsided soon enough, and then Steve was grunting, panting, thrusting into him, and Tony was trying to pull him closer and closer, trying to feel him, needing Steve to fill him in some place that hadn't even existed for him two hours before.
Which meant—
during the night."
The rest of Steve's shift went by rather uneventfully, not that it mattered because he spent most of his time thinking about Tony and about that kiss and wishing he'd thought to make certain that they would actually see each other again and get their date. By the time midnight rolled around, he was more than ready to call it a night and go home and stare at his ceiling for the next four hours and play over the last seven years of his life and wonder how different they might have been had he done things differently, had he not broken things off with the only man he'd ever truly loved.
Hill nodded, and Tony glanced between them for an answer before Natasha said, "Stockings," and left it at that.
. I was just saying—"
"Babe, no one's going to come after you for it. Honest. I mean, yeah, you get some fundies after you to repent your ungodly ways, but seriously, no one cares— No, I tell a lie. The gossip sites are after us for dirt constantly because anything about the Avengers is pure clickbait for them, and they're whores for that sort of shit. But other than that? I mean, honestly, no one's going to throw Steve Rogers in jail for fucking Tony Stark. The most they'd do is throw you under the bus."
She scrunched her mouth to the side, and she tapped a finger against her mouth and said, "I always forget how antiquated your thinking is on this world. I had thought maybe you would be different…" She shook her head. "It doesn't matter. All right, Captain. If that is your contention, I can make it easier for him."
"Nuh-uh."
and Goldilocks with your fucking giant blondeness, and fucking hell, even— Even
OK, he really didn't see Steve as the type to make a pact with any kind of religious cult — not even for
Steve chose to frame them and put them on display right beside a photo of him and Tony taken right after they'd gotten engaged and a group shot of the Avengers taken right after some minor skirmish they'd gotten tangled in, two disparate parts of his life finally coming together as one.
"It's just not something you're supposed to discuss in front of other people!"
"Jesus Christ," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes again, and he felt Steve squeeze his hand as Steve said, "So, what do we do?"
the count for the Hulk in this blunt, matter-of-fact manner: kills, manner of killing, etc. I thought Bruce was going to cry. He's a peaceful guy. Thinks he's a fucking hippy." He laughed at the memory of it. "You should have seen the look on Nat's face. I thought she was going to kill him."
Thankfully, the kid did most of the work for him, though with her now on his lap, it did make trying to work on the armor upgrades a bit tricky. A lot tricky. Look, he was fine burning himself on solder, but he wasn't about to chance burning a four-year-old.
"What?"
"But...but
He folded his arms. "What makes you think I'm pretending?"
"And they're dead, too, huh?"
He shrugged again. "'Cause. You two are married and, uh,
, and he just wanted things with Steve to go back to the way they were.
"Damn right you won't," Tony replied and stumbled a little when his head went a little woozy. He caught himself on the edge of the table. "How the hell much did you take?"
"See?" Steve asked, pride coloring the tone of his voice. "I can figure these things out."
He snorted a laugh. "No, you weren't. It's not army regulation."
"Eh," he said with a shrug, which made the Iron Man shrug as well, "there's a kind of a thrill you get from firing a repulsor at some asshole Hydra agent in person, but, whatever. Not the end of the world if I don't. Steve, I can still be Iron Man and still be back here safe so you're not worried about me getting hurt in the field.
Sam just shook his head. "Point is, we get it. You feel more comfortable leaving the care of your only child — your own flesh and blood — to people that have met her, like, once and live all the way on the other side of the country instead of, you know, people that have, like, played with her and taken care of her and watched her while you and your little princess do your...weird sex games."
"Hmm…" Tony said as he clambered under the covers then stopped and frowned at Steve. "Wait, for what?"
"Yeah, but are you attracted to me?" He stood a little straighter and tried to suck in his gut some before he motioned over himself. "Even like this?"
Sam snorted a laugh and pocked his bounty.
Tony shot a pointed look at him over his menu. "Steve," he said evenly and firmly like he meant business and he wasn't taking 'no' for an answer, "it's my treat. Whatever you want."
"—Steve's the only one you've slept with in
He dropped his hands away from his face and got up from the chair. He made to go to the bar and pour himself a drink, but he thought better of it. Not because he didn't want it — he did — but because he couldn't. Not while he had her. Not while she was here. He wasn't going to be like his father. No matter whose kid she really was, he wasn't going to be like his father.
Natasha, though, was the one to smooth over the situation as she said a soft and empathetic, "No, Tony's water finally broke."
"Papa, wha's wrong?" she asked and rubbed at her nose with her fist. "Is he gone?"
"I know," Tony said and sniffed at the downed agent's form. He turned back to Barnes and said, "Look, forget about what that assclown said. Steve trusts you, Nat trusts you, and I trust you. I mean, I sort of have to after you saw all
"What's wrong with that song?"
, Steve. I don't think you understand. I don't think you
Olivia just stared up at him and gurgled a bit, and Barnes stroked her cheek again and said, "She's got your eyes."
She smiled and winked at him in response then put a hand to Wilson's arm and said, "Come on. We should probably find our seats. I think they're going to serve dinner soon. We don't want to miss the speeches."
The song finally got to the guitar solo part once Twelfth Avenue had turned into more of a limited-access highway, and Tony went to turn the volume down, but Steve said, "No, wait!" and pressed the button on the steering wheel to turn the volume up a little louder. Tony sat back, gobsmacked.
Barnes shook his head. "No. I—" He shook his head again. "No."
So, then he tried to think about Peggy. Sweet, beautiful, tough-as-nails Peggy. With her chestnut curls and brown eyes and red lips and melodious voice and soft curves... Well, he thought soft curves. He hadn't had the chance to find out for himself yet, but if he played his cards right, he was certain he would. She was everything he could have ever hoped for (well, almost everything, but those sorts of thoughts were liable to get a fellow dishonorably discharged), and she'd even thrown a few smiles his way before he'd turned into, well, the peak of human perfection. She'd given him a once-over back when he was still Skinny Steve Rogers from Brooklyn, the dumb kid that didn't know when to back down from a fight; the idiot that had never figured out when to keep his damned trap shut. Maybe, if the fates allowed and this war really was over by next year at this time, he'd have new Christmas memories to treasure. A fiancée to spend the holiday with or maybe, if he was very good, a wife. They would have a son someday (he
Tony's blood chilled, and he met Bruce's now nervous gaze and asked a very even and totally not terrified, "Who's 'Maddie'?"
“I love you, too,” he murmured back, and Tony snorted a teary laugh.
"Are you sure? How do you—"
going to finish that bottle, are you?"
Steve needed only a second to process that before he was grasping a firm hold of Tony's hand and practically dragging him back up the road.
Steve frowned at this, unsure why Welch was directing his disgust at him, and even Tony thought it was a bit odd but then remembered Welch hadn't made sense about anything since the early days of the Reagan administration. Even Howard hadn't thought much of him.
Bruce turned around, and he grimaced and scratched his head at what he found. "What?" Tony asked, sensing his unease. "I did what you said—"
"Then why are you here?"
trying not to think about that part too much, OK? So, please, just… I
," the soul-dead host said, "
Steve glanced back at Tony once again, a wry little smile on his face. "Why does it bother you so much? You don't know them, and this picture was taken almost fifty years ago."
"Other what?"
Tony groaned as the face of his former…one night stand, let's be honest…popped up on the screen along with whoever this other chick was. He watched the host bandy back and forth with the guests as they speculated about the whereabouts of Tony Stark and what was really going on inside Avengers Tower, slapping one slice of toast atop his completed sandwich, and he took a bite of it as the host asked the guests, "
"That's not what I meant. We've done a lot of good, and there's a lot of goodwill toward us from the public, but I'm starting to hear rumblings about us being a rogue group that answers to no one but ourselves."
him on the team. Tony Stark was the very definition of a liability in the field. He wasn't sure anything would ever convince him otherwise.
And complete and utter relief that he wasn't going to have to save Steve from himself again. Maybe Barnes wasn't so bad after all?
, and he was a little embarrassed by the general clutter of the place, but as he switched on the light and Tony took a look around, he just shook his head and said, "I forgot how lazy you are with housekeeping."
And then…he burst into tears.
He nodded. "Yeah," he said, meaning every ounce of the word.
…when Bucky said, "Oh, shit, he's coming back," and Steve's eyes went wide before he dove under the desk again, thumping his way back to his hiding spot.
"Yeah," Steve said and poked at the food on his plate. "Kind of always wanted to go there. Never had the money…or a date."
, not future. Not
Oh, that was something Tony could do, he discovered as he sat on the couch later that afternoon — he thought it was afternoon, anyway going by the amount of light streaming in the windows — he could build thousands of little arc reactors for everyone so that something like this never happened again. What was Tony Stark doing, anyway? No one had heard anything from him since this whole thing had begun. Did he think he was above it all because he was pregnant with Captain America's child?
But she waved him off and said, "Yes, I know. The Captain explained it to me already. But you wish me to get rid of the child that grows in his womb, and I cannot do that."
"You can never have enough toys for a kid," Bucky continued, and Sam nodded his serious-faced agreement before he seemed to think better of it and said, "Well, yeah, that's not true."
The point is they don't trust me—"
so I can go break into a store and steal you a case of formula."
"I notice he's always
Natasha's face went a little softer. "That's not the only reason to do it. Honestly, maybe if you see it, it'll make it a little realer to you."
"You're positive? It's not something with the baby, right?"
Steve looked up again. He met Steve's fierce, blue gaze, and Steve just stared back at him, resolute, and said, "I mean it. I ever see that man again, I'm knocking him into next week."
Other Tony nodded. "Yeah. He really has out for you guys, doesn't he?"
think that!" Barton cried. "I'm saying that's the way they'll report it! Yes, I know you're pregnant. It's a beautiful thing. But honestly, you are
"Yeah, they do a lot of things in the movies that we shouldn't try in real life."
Basically, what Howard had done wrong with him, he would do right with her.
But Steve just grinned at him. "Even
Steve frowned at him and put up a hand to block one of Olivia's from grabbing onto his lip. "It's really not—"
"I wonder why that is."
I caught him looking a little bloodshot and glazed one time."
He snuffled some and wiped away the tears that had begun to collect — fucking hormones — and he stepped into the warm shower and let the water run over his body. He closed his eyes and willed himself to forget about the outside world for a moment and focus on nothing but the way the water felt cascading down his body, the warmth, the comfort, the security it provided him.
hated it as much as you claimed, you wouldn't even think about going out in public looking like that. And you wouldn't have agreed to see Denise or go for an ultrasound."
Figuring he'd gotten it, he hopped up onto the table and sat, the paper of the gown crinkling against the paper sheet that covered the table. "Yeah, well," he said and hugged his arms tight around himself. It was only Steve in the room with him, but there was no telling who could walk through that door at any second. "There's a reason they call them the 'dark ages,' babe."
the fucking juice, and he coughed and gagged and smacked Steve again and said, "What the
He didn't cry. Starks didn't cry. Hell, he didn't even cry at his parents' funeral. But god, if he wasn't tempted. If there wasn't some weird emotion building up inside him—
Rhodey sighed, his shoulders slumping some. "I don't know, Tones. I'm just trying to figure out a logical explanation for all this."
Steve chuckled lightly and reached out to pick up a small shaker of colored sugar. Taking care to note that the top was still on, he shook it a little to watch the green-colored crystalline granules shift around in the tight space, and Tony shot him a look as he scooped a Santa-shaped piece of dough off the table and said, "You can't tell me they didn't have colored sugar in your day."
"Are you reading another pregnancy article?" he muttered as he crunched on a pretzel and tried to look over Steve's shoulder.
He didn't want to think about the fact that he would have been OK with Natasha doing it to him, too. Well, in theory. He supposed. Could Steve watch?
if you promise to curl up on the couch and relax and not go down to your lab and work on stuff that can wait until later."
"Seriously?"
As Tony put the mug in the microwave and set the time for two-and-a-half minutes, he could hear Bruce and Rhodey whispering in the background. He tried to catch what they were saying, but he couldn't hear over the hum of the microwave, but thank god for mouthy little kids that didn't know when they weren't supposed to say anything.
And Bucky, knowing what Steve had run off to do, would be the first one to see it, if only to torment Steve with the knowledge.
He just blinked at her and tilted his head some as he considered what to say. He didn't want to lie to her, but he didn't want to lead her on to think that nothing bad would ever happen. So long as there was breath in his body, nothing bad would happen to her, but him and the Cap... That one was going to be a bit tougher to navigate. Because Tony would be totally cool with playing make believe — at least for a little while, and
The little troublemaker rolled her eyes and huffed. "That's not 'Daddy.' That's 'Papa.'"
Tony rolled his eyes. "The point is she doesn't talk about Cap like he's part of this tower of misfits. Has she mentioned him once?"
Instead, he went over to the newly-reinstalled window that looked out over the city. He braced an arm against the glass and leaned against it, gazing over the artificially-lit horizon of buildings and water. The sun had long-since set, and the city glittered with streetlamps and automobile lights and signage and office buildings that still saw activity even at this time of night. It was peaceful.
alone."
"Though I don't know why I bother," Bucky added. "I'm not good enough to be her godfather, so..."
Steve smiled lazily at him and rubbed a gentle hand over the bed covers right where Tony's leg was. "Outside of the fact that the media again ran with a story they never should have run, I seem to recall something similar happening to you out in Malibu."
"Look, she's got to be from an alternate universe," he said.
She nodded. "Mmm... Tell me—" she turned to look at him, "—why is that?"
to treat a child like a project. I had enough of that from my father, OK? I know
"Not a real girl, Stark," Barton said and turned his attention back to the TV. Tony turned on him.
But Steve shrugged. "You're in your forties; I'm ninety-seven. We couldn't have just met, what, four years ago, could we?"
Yes, he was allowed to use the word 'mansplain' now. Had he used it in the right context? Honestly, he really didn't care at the moment. He was on a table, in his lab, his legs spread wide as he attempted to push a ten-pound sack of potatoes out from between them, probably splitting himself in half in the process. Using a word in its correct context was completely irrelevant to him at the moment.
"That's not the word I would use. Trust me."
"Tony—" Steve tried again, but Tony just got up from the table, the scent from the spit-up finally reaching his nostrils, and he muttered a disgusted, "Oh, god," and, food barely touched, left the kitchen and made a dash for the steps.
Steve's brows knitted together in confusion.
"I'm sorry I missed that. Kinda would have liked to meet an alternate universe version of myself."
Barnes' face went a little pinched, and Tony had a suspicion he was, rather than taking insult, filing the information away for future reference, especially considering the little nod he gave it.
"Did they say where they were going?"
"Bruce, come on! You know deep down you're secretly dying to find out what's there. You're a science man. You like to dig deeper, find stuff out, figure out fixes to problems. Getting to the root of something intrigues you. Science, Bruce. Do it for science!"
hopped up onto the table and said, "OK. Do what you have to."
"See?
Maybe not as quiet and peaceful as Malibu — he would think about getting back out there soon, but he knew that was where Pepper was headed, and…yeah…
"Did you bet him you would pay him fifteen thousand dollars if it turned out you were having a girl?"  Rhodey asked.
"How many are we talking?" Steve asked. "And how many could we even fit here?"
it. He had to assume it, keep telling himself that yeah, he was growing a life inside of him, and someday it would be able to live and thrive on its own, but until that time, it was just an idea, an assumption, something he took for granted existed because he'd been told it existed and nothing else.
But she just stared back at him clear-eyed and said, "Mmm hmm."
"Nah," Barton said before Steve could say anything. "If either of them is in restraints and skimpy clothing, it's the princess. I mean being
He thought then about the overwhelming relief he'd seen on that other Cap's face, the way he'd clung to Olivia and cradled her tight and kissed her and promised her all her fears were for naught. Yes, her papa adored her, but he could definitely say Olivia's daddy adored her, too.
did some reading on your condition."
Tony sighed out a breath and dropped his arms. "Not— That sounds so permanent. I don't want— Not retire, but... A break," he said. "I need— I lost my parents, Steve. I know how that... I can't do that to her. I'm sorry. I know... I know we make a good team, I know I make comments about co-leading the group, but... I don't think I can do it anymore— Not to the extent that I did. I don't... I don't want to retire. I don't want to permanently give it up, but I think... I really think we need to maybe agree that we don't go out in the field at the same time anymore. You go? I'll stay here. The most I'll do is fly remotely like I did back when I was knocked up—"
Tony exhaled a breath. "Look," he said evenly, "first, I just want to say, he doesn't hate you."
"Whatever," he muttered while the nurse laughed a little and motioned for them to follow her into the exam room.
Whatever. It didn't mean anything. Bruce was grasping at straws. He was an outsider in all this. Tony was the one actually
"Babe, come on. Just come out here, and I'll make you feel good. I promise."
After, Bruce put a diaper on her, and Hill provided a soft pastel pink blanket to swaddle her up in. He watched as Hill lay the blanket flat at the foot of the bed, and Bruce lay the baby down on it and then swaddled her up like he was a pro before he handed her back over to Tony, who stared up in amazement at him.
Steve just shook his head a little. "You looked too peaceful, and I know how hard it's been for you trying to get decent sleep lately. It's fine. Jim says if we ever desperately need an armored division, he's right there for us."
, Stark," Barton said. "He's asking if you have a vag."
But that Steve Rogers had been the one to do it.
clear, Tony! This is you! This is—" Bruce motioned at the monitor. "Absolutely impossible."
"Not mad. Tired."
," he muttered and folded his arms, resting them between his breasts and his gigantic belly. "And it's not 'Antonia Stefania.' It's 'James Steven.'"
"Here, Tony, do you want to feel?" Bruce asked him after he'd told him to let up on pushing for a second, and Tony panted, sweat dripping down his face and the hair that had come loose from his ponytail hanging limp as he glared at him, wondering what in his right mind had even possessed him to ask such a ridiculous question. He stared at the well-meaning idiot a moment, panting, then said, "Yeah, I'm good."
The hunt for Hydra cells took them to somewhere in the former Soviet bloc, which produced three things: a formerly safeguarded remnant of Chitauri tech, a bunch of Hydra lackeys that were left to take the fall while the big-guns got away—
"Drive a hard bargain there, Cap." He left the kitchen, and after he did, he called back, "Don't work too hard there, Stark!"
"So, Steve, our darling, wonderful leader, tells him
Steve just nodded, seemingly unconvinced of Tony's theory. "And how are you going to produce it?"
Rhodey just shrugged as Tony tossed the napkin onto the table. "
of a difference in their heights now that Steve was in socks and Tony was wearing a small heel. He watched as Steve pulled a small box from his sock drawer and cracked it open to reveal the sterling cufflinks Tony had bought him for an anniversary.
"Well, her sister, Lynn."
"When am I ever not?" came his cocky reply, and she swatted at him, but there was a teasing and fond smile on her lips as she did so. She muttered something in Russian — probably one of the few words she remembered from the college Russian she'd taken — and Bucky replied in much the same way, and Steve had to suppress a laugh at the blind leading the blind. Natasha's Russian was probably as good as his German—
"The stubbornness," he said as he swallowed down the remnants of the gulp. "I was a very easy- going child. I'm going to assume you weren't."
"Yeah? Then what
Tony startled back as though burned. "Excuse me?"
There was a part of him that had almost forgotten about it, he realized as he opened the box and gazed at the simple gold band. He'd taken it off after he'd gotten turned back in January because it was too big for any of his fingers, and it had never occurred to him to put a chain on it and hang it around his neck like had with the diamond and sapphire band. After stumbling on it down in his lab a couple months earlier — the last place he'd left it after he'd realized it was too big for any of his fingers — he'd tucked it away in his drawer for safekeeping. He was pretty sure that was after he'd been told Esmeralda was dead, and so the band only had sentimental value at that point, but he still… He hadn't been ready or willing to let it go. As gorgeous as that diamond and sapphire band was — and it was gorgeous — this one was still his engagement band, the simple one he'd picked out after Steve had asked him to marry him. The one he'd had every intention of using as a wedding ring when the time came for it.
He blew out a breath, if only to give himself some time to gather his thoughts. "Uh…he asked me to go out with him, and I said I would."
"Uh," Tony said as he walked into the living room and watched them lay the garment bag over the couch, "security breach."
Steve's hold on his hands had gone slack by this point, and so Tony reached out and patted his cheek. "Aw, that's sweet, babe, but I'm still going to fight you on that. The 'mother' of your child is a complete asshole, and he wears it like a badge of honor."
"Are you fucking kidding me?"
Tony hummed, and he nestled his surprisingly alert baby close and said, "Well, you're wrong, but—"
Steve looked up, nervous, like he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer to the question he was about to ask.
"Stop it. Just stop it. I’m on to you. I know your game. I know this is a trap of some kind. I don't understand its purpose, but I know it's a trap." He ran a hand through his — damned short — hair and clenched the other in a fist. Then, in what was probably one of his less-brilliant plans, he eyed the front door and made a break for it.
"You know! The chewy stuff!"
"Totally up to you," Tony said while Steve stood there and seemingly weighed the pros and cons of what Tony was proposing. "We haven't done this in months, and— To be honest, I wasn't sure it would even be something you would want to do with me like this. Not saying we have to; just saying that if you want to, I am a thousand percent open to it."
see you, and he liked what he saw more than he wanted to admit to himself."
thorough. You didn't find anything, did you, babe?"
the one that's pregnant, I don't care who he is, I'm kicking him in the nuts."
He shook his head and swiped at the screen. "Nothing to talk about, J. Little blip on the radar. Doesn't change anything. I didn't actually order anything for her, did I?" He didn't wait for JARVIS to respond before he added, "Cancel it. Whatever I ordered, cancel it. It's not worth it. She's gone, she's not coming back, end of story."
Pepper blinked, looking like a mix between utterly perplexed and ready to take his head off, and she just shook her head a little and scrunched her face and said, "
"I do not know," he said and began to crunch on a slice. "She does not waste her talents, however. There is a reason she chose to focus her attentions on our friend. And you as well. I do not believe this fate would have befallen our Man of Iron did she not sense the bond between you."
"Yeah?"
"What? No!" Steve said. "No, I got that for you."
Evidently they didn't, and evidently even
because Iron Man got turned into a
"Why would you even want this anyway? To be here with these people that are just waiting for you to take one false step? Make one mistake? Step out of line once? You know they'll never trust you. They'll always be waiting for you to fuck up — even that little redheaded bitch—"
"Because the
Tony opened his mouth automatically to say 'girl'—
Bruce grimaced a little but shrugged and indicated his agreement. "Pretty much."
"And the sex."
Tony had a feeling about today.
"I'm not a killjoy."
Palming the gold band for the moment, he glanced over the dresser and picked up the diamond and sapphire band threaded on a thin, silver chain. He held it by the chain so that the ring dangled and caught in the daylight, and he held it over his palm that held the gold band and slackened his hold on the chain, letting the band slide down into his palm where it clanked with the plain gold one. He set the chain on the dresser and stared at the rings in his palm — rings that symbolized so much about himself and his relationship with the man that had given him reason to wear them — and he picked up the diamond and sapphire band and attempted to slide it onto his left pinky, the only finger it might fit. It went down as far as his middle knuckle and wouldn't budge any further, and not wanting to get it stuck on his finger, he scowled a little and pulled it off, holding it between his thumb and forefinger. He turned his hand a couple times to look at it, and he brought it up to his lips and kissed it before he set it in the box he'd pulled his other band from. He loved it and was not ashamed to wear it — there was no rule or law that said he couldn't put it back on the chain and wear it around his neck until the end of time — but was an heirloom now, he decided, something that could be passed to his daughter when she became old enough to appreciate it.
"OK, what do we have here?" he mused and scrolled down the marriage bureau page of the city clerk's office before he sat down at the island again. "Uh…thirty-five bucks. I guess I can afford that. Oh! We can fill it out online!" He glanced up at Steve. "Well, that should get us around that whole, uh—"
"So, he considers JARVIS a person?"
"No," she said and shook her head a little, honey-blonde tresses somehow shimmering even with no direct light focused on them. "Exactly like that. You were born too many years apart to have found each other — to have united with each other — in the way that everyone else must face. Fate played a hand and allowed for you to find each other when you needed each other most. Your eternal youth is a blessing, but it is also a curse. The son of Odin is right. Unless you fall in battle, you will be cursed to watch those you love grow old and pass, and you will be left to live out your deepest fears. You will be alone."
"That's a

I've known about this for a while, Tin Man."
The worry and concern still hadn't left Steve's face. "Yeah, I know," he said and reached a tentative hand out toward Tony's abdomen but stopped short of actually touching him. "But I'm not the one that ended up…"
He shrugged, and Tony arched an eyebrow.
Barnes looked up, awed, like he hadn't considered that angle before. "My niece."
He stepped on and hit the button for the floor the Cap used when he was in town, and he expected some sort of question from Olivia when they stepped off onto the floor — so far as she knew, the Cap lived in the penthouse with them — but what he didn't expect was exactly what
"Just flip through the book and pick a name at random. We both agree we like it, we'll use it."
"I know everything," she explained simply. "I have been waiting for you."
They couldn't get the machine until the next day, which did nothing for Tony's nerves — or Bruce's, for that matter — and when it was finally delivered, Tony ripped off the tape and protective bubble wrap it had been sent over in like a child opening presents on Christmas.
"Anyway," she said, "much fun as this has been—"
"That doesn't mean I want to hear it every time I turn around."
"I thought it was beautiful," Natasha said.
"So, other than that?" he asked, and Steve shrugged and set the tablet down on the coffee table.
"How did you…?" he mused but didn't finish the thought. Seriously, though, how did she sneak in so easily?
or— Who's the one that really has it out for you two?"

"I wouldn't say I
"Here. Drink up. Going to need it for later."
But Hill scowled at him and said, "Hey, buddy, why don't you go drip your flop sweat onto someone else for a while?" but ingenuity suddenly struck, and Tony shook his head and said a quick, "
"Like that! There you go again. I almost think you don't want me to—"

"Lift up your leg," he said, and Tony pulled the blankets back and did so, and Steve tucked the pillow between his legs.

when we get home."
"Yeah," Tony replied. "Almost married him," he added and went back to his phone.
"You won't do a goddamned thing except piss and moan for six months," Barton said and grabbed another slice of bacon. "You're the textbook definition of 'all bark and no bite.'"
"You mean like Stark?" Sam asked and motioned at Tony.
"Maybe I just came here after work with some friends to relax and unwind and got bushwhacked by some sleazebucket that thinks I have any interest in letting him stick it in me."
So, he asked for the next best thing. "Will you stay?"
She shot a glance back at him. "How do you think it's getting out of you?"
He got back up again, his back popping as he straightened his spine. He muttered 'fuck' under his breath again then said, "I don't know, baby. You're going to have to ask him when he gets home. You know how he is."
It was funny how his opinion of someone could change so drastically and so quickly. Not that he'd ever actually
He sucked down the remainder of the lemon-lime, watered down by the ice that had melted, and Steve raised an eyebrow, apparently hearing something that Tony hadn't said. "Are you saying you're not?" he asked.
Steve rolled his eyes and groaned, and he rubbed a hand over his face. "Look, Jim—"
"You don't have to
They met each other's gazes, and their eyes did a dance of wonder and confusion before, together, they looked down at the large swell of Tony's abdomen.

"Then what was that look?"
"Know
"Doing what?"
Tony nodded his understanding then tossed his napkin onto the table and got up, letting Steve keep hold of his hand as he led them away from the table and over to a bank of windows that looked out to the western side of the island as well as Jersey and beyond. The lights of the expanse shone before them, the sun having set some time ago, and Steve took Tony's other hand in his grasp and said, "They're plotting something. I don't know what it is, but they're plotting something."
"Depends on the situation."
"Are you sure about that?"  Esmeralda murmured.
To Steve's surprise and continued confusion, Wilson just laughed. "Man, the universe just loves to fuck with you two, doesn't it. Hey!" he added and shot Tony a knowing look. "Nothing else
somehow — in his fluids or something."
He frowned, his eyes still closed, and stretched out in the bed. It didn't feel like his — like it was too small or something — and he couldn't usually hear what was going on in the kitchen when he was upstairs in the bedroom.
Steve just shook his head a little, and Hill smiled and said, "Congratulations," before she left, and after the elevator door was closed and the car was on the descent, Steve turned to him and said, "She's right, you know."
"Are you kidding? He lives to contradict me. I just explained to him that my way sounded better and made more sense."
this going into it?"
He didn't think he deserved to have anyone make a big fuss over him. He would always be that sickly boy from the Brooklyn tenement, wouldn't he?
Bruce closed his eyes and sighed out a breath. "Let me make a call," he muttered then shuffled off to the elevator, mug in hand and cellophane of the granola bar wrapper crinkling as he pulled it out of his pocket.
— and said, "You're lucky I love you, old man."
"What way?" Steve asked and stole a glance up at Tony before he went back to the dough.
Hill and Natasha nodded their agreement — at what part of Rhodey's statement, Tony wasn't sure — and Tony frowned and took a breath before he said, "Yeah, I should probably call her to explain, shouldn't I?"
Cap just sat there a moment, arms still folded, before he said, "Is there something that's brought this on? Is Miss Potts—"
Pepper frowned and looked at it. "Why? What's wrong with that?"
Barnes blinked, and the cloudiness left his eyes as he turned his attention back to him. "I take it that went over well."
Steve took the glass and sniffed at the liquid, coming away with the scent of something sweet.
"I didn't mention that to Steve, either," he murmured, shame and regret coloring his voice.

"Hey, you have to admit the Sexiest Avenger Couple has that exotic Russian-spy thing going for them. You two've got the whole dad-thing going on. I mean, isn't that a diaper bag on your shoulder?" He motioned to Tony's right side.

Steve just grinned at him, cocky and maybe even a touch proud. "I've got the serum. You don't."
"You expect us to believe that Tony Stark somehow got turned into a woman, that she and Captain America had sex and neither one of them thought to use a condom, and that now you're magically pregnant and stuck as a woman for the rest of your life when everyone knows that Tony Stark — the

"Well," he said and dropped the towel on the table to go back to the stove, "maybe Daddy needs to take some pointers from you."

what he looks like when he smiles," Barton said as he examined the picture. Evidently he was talking about Barnes. Steve's smile in the photo was more of an unsure grimace, and the team had seen Steve smile on many occasions in the time since they'd been assembled.
King Howard had ruled over these lands for over twenty years before producing a viable, legitimate heir. There were bastards, of course. Howard was a strikingly handsome man with sharp eyes and a wicked smile, traits that had found their way into his only son. But none of these bastards could ever lay claim to the throne, as they had been born of affairs with mistresses or whores and not a virtuous and pious queen. Howard, in fact, did not himself take a queen until he was nearly fifty years of age, and then it was two miscarriages and a stillbirth before Anthony was even born. Quite possibly, if not for Anthony, there would have been no legitimate line of succession, and the kingdom would have fallen into disarray with no anointed ruler.

He turned back to Steve expectantly, motioning for Steve to get the proverbial show on the road, and Steve chuckled a little and shook his head but said, "The things I do for you," as he stuck his thumbs in the waistband of his boxer briefs and shoved them down.
"So, as I was saying," he said and adjusted himself on the hard mattress of the gurney, "When Steve comes back — because he's going to come back — he's going to be pissed at you guys for buying these things. He's afraid it's bad luck."
"Why don't we look for something…?"
"I need a dick is more like it."
Barnes stared at him a moment then said, "You could learn Russian."
"Within reason," Tony replied with a shrug. "I know you're not much for the java, my science brother from another mother, so how about some of that herbal tea shit—
Tony watched him do this then asked, seeming to know there was more there than met the eye, "I'm sorry, are you trying to imply I
Steve, however, decided to fight fire with fire.
"Because you're afraid to let yourself hope for even one second that it might be true. Because if you let yourself think it's true and then it turns out it's not, you're afraid it'll hurt that much. You'd rather not feel anything than put yourself in a position to get hurt."
"That's better," Steve said and leaned over to kiss him.
"Honey, I'm going to go out there and tell the world I'm Tony Stark, I'm a woman now and forever, and I'm pregnant with Captain America's child. I'll have every Hydra or AIM or god-knows-what-else faction coming out of the woodwork to try and kidnap me."
Tony hummed as he considered this, soldering a wire to a new connection. "The era you guys came from, I figured you'd be relieved Steve didn't want to fuck you."
Bucky shivered. "Thank fuck," he said, and Steve vowed then and there never to admit the truth to him. "Guy gave me the creeps. Anyway, my point is—"
Tony rolled his eyes, and Bruce directed him over to the couch. "You can't tell me you've never done this before. You mean to tell me you never encountered this during your philanthropic backpacking tour of Calcutta?"
"Oh, come on. You're so much better at it than I am!"
"Whoa, don't go anywhere yet, babe. I need your brain to function around at least twenty-five percent until I get us slicked up here."
"Hmm...miss us already, huh?" Tony asked, but again, there was a mirthful tease to his voice.
"What makes you so sure?" Barton asked, and Tony picked up his glass of orange juice and grinned.
Steve chuckled and moved closer to him. "Tony—"
"Fucking sap," Tony muttered, but Steve just stayed quiet as he rubbed his cheek against the top of Tony's head. "You know, any of the others catch us like this, they'll never let us live it down."
"Meaning? I mean, I know what you mean by immortality for Tony, but mortality — me. What would you do to me?"
"I can't fry an egg to save my life," Barnes said and pulled two cartons out of the fridge because evidently they had to have that many on them at all times now.
Steve shot him another knowing look over the metal rim of his dark aviators and said, "You know where it's got to pass through, right?"
"Mmm…glad you like it."
"I've been eating bacon and eggs since your old man was in

"I do," Tony said. "I don't know if your boyfriend does, though."

considering that you claimed to have been so inexperienced when we started this?"
"Something more," he said and rinsed the cloth out, and before he could help himself, Steve said, "You're a good-looking man."
"Because she knows what they will try to do, and she cannot condone that. She believes that all bondeds wish to conceive and bear children. She believes it is their duty to do so. She cannot condone them—"
Natasha insisted that Tony really try to 'wow' Steve, and at the last store they ventured into, she picked out some rather eye-popping lingerie especially for the evening. Tony had to laugh as she showed it to him and said, "Why are you encouraging this?"
"What? Why do you think it's
"And you know, man, I'm like the lieutenant of Team Stony—"
Steve just rubbed his pec — and by extension his nipple — some more. "How can you say it doesn't hurt?"
"I'm not dead!" he shouted at the screen, the mouthful of food muffling his words. "I'm just fucking pregnant!"

Steve's fault that he was dead, and it really was the height of distaste for him to just shrug and say 'too bad' for his oldest and closest friend before he went and played house with Tony — with a
Barnes turned to Steve. "You understood that?"
"Eh," Steve said as they heard the telltale sounds of a door unlatching or unlocking, "not saying the guy doesn't deserve it. Haven't had the time to do it, though. I'll get around to talking to him at some point. Hear he can be a stubborn son-of-a-bitch."
"A little," Bruce conceded. "Doesn't appear anyone's thought to actually check the clerk's office for a marriage license, and if they have, evidently the one they found doesn't match up with their narrative, so they don't know what to do with it."
"I know. I just wanted to hear you admit it."
, seriously, for the love of god, stop drinking out of the carton! — and dumped that in. Also, these breasts—" he motioned to them, "—that I know every single man and woman in this room has ogled on several occasions — that's right, Romanoff, don't think I didn't catch you checking them out a couple times — ache like you wouldn't believe
He raised his eyebrows and sipped the last of the champagne, and Tony stared at him and said, "I feel like you're trying to tell us something without actually telling us something."
"Yeah, having this kid. Having our kid."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Feeling kind of free with my money, aren't you?"
"I'm sorry," Tony murmured after a moment. "I didn't mean to—"
, but…"
"Aren't you the lucky woman?" she mused before something the assistant did caught her attention out of the corner of her eye, and she grumbled and said, "No, Jeannie, not like
Bruce sighed out a breath and sat down on the coffee table so that he was more at Tony's eye- level. "First, you denied her existence, then you accepted that she at least existed but you were bound and determined to get her back,

The doctor just chuckled and said, "Again, I'm sure he was very thorough about it, but I do need to do one for the record."
stop screaming that he murdered your parents."
"We've been broken up almost two years, Tony. You've been with Steve over a year. I'm with Happy. I think we're OK talking about that sort of thing."
"Thanks, Buck. And nothing ever happened with Schmidt."
Tony closed his eyes, the lab going silent enough to hear a pin drop, and he felt some well of emotion build up inside of him until he couldn't take it any longer. He choked out a few gasps before he realized what was happening, and as the tears streamed down his face, he glanced up at the ceiling and said, "J, you tell anyone about this, and I'm dismantling you and donating you to DeVry."
Say, that was an idea!
had as much of a 'Get out of Jail Free' card as he does."
Steve tried to will the flush to leave him, taking a deep breath and trying to steady his nerves, and for some reason, the only thing he could be bothered to say — almost like it was pure reflex or a muscle memory for him — was, "Don't say 'fucking.'"
"Really?" Steve said, half bemused and half in disbelief.
"He knows that you're a man, Tony. You're not made for this."
"That doesn't make sense in this context!" Bruce called after him, but Tony left the lab and went over to the elevator. He hit the button and waited for it to arrive, and once it did, he stepped on and asked, "Hey, J, is Steve still out on his run?"
"But I got used to it," he said and took hold of the pajamas Steve handed to him. "I mean, yeah, sure, maybe I thought about what it would be like to be tall, but," he shrugged, "it's not in the genes. But then the Avengers came along, and
child," Steve muttered but sat up some, and he reached out and put his hand to Tony's abdomen and grinned like a fool as he felt the fluttering through the layers of skin and clothing. Tony rolled his eyes and muttered, "Sap," as Steve kept his hand there until the fluttering subsided.
"I don't
"That you got yourself blonde, beefy, and anal-retentive there?" Sam asked and motioned to Steve. "No. Ain't no one on this earth jealous that you got his uptight ass."
"Babe?" Tony asked with a knock at the door, and Steve cringed and made a face and said a prayer to God above for Tony not to open that door, which, considering what he'd just done, was a strange thing to ask God's help for, but desperate times called for desperate measures.
Steve nodded but said nothing, and the clerk finally made his appearance from a back room and stood beside the deputy that was refusing to grant their marriage license. She motioned to Steve and said, "Steve Rogers," then nodded at Tony and added, "Tony Stark."
"Maria."
"I thought it was a muscle spasm—"
," he said, gritting out the words as he shoved against the guy again. He could feel the guy's growing interest pressing into his pelvis, and bile began to creep up into his throat at the thought of what that meant — or could mean for him if he wasn't careful.
"No!" he cried again. "No, I— I won't believe this. I'm not believe—
He stopped beside the door to what was the Cap's bedroom and stared at her a moment as he tried to process exactly what she'd just informed him, and his brain almost short-circuited at the conclusion it came to.
The lecher made like he hadn't realized he'd been causing him any problem and said, "Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to get in your way."
"Uh, so…you like 'em? They're OK?" Tony asked as he slid his arms around Steve's waist. Not as easy to do as it had once been — stupid , gigantic stomach was in the way — but he was still able to get a good hold on Steve, and Steve was still able to hold him in his arms and brush his lips over the top of his head and murmur a soft and sincere, "
the one that's actually pregnant. Ergo, I'm the one that gets to have the final say."
“That was completely uncalled for!” he yelled at the sinewy man bent over the engine of an old roadster, his tight, black tank riding up and giving a flash of tawny skin set above the waistband of tight, dark jeans.
"Probably overdid the training in the gym, and maybe curry just doesn't agree with me, either."
"Oh," Tony said, low and knowing, "we're going to talk about
"Well, whatever it was," Tony said and took the book out of Steve's hands, "it doesn't matter. Wasn't this life for either of us."
Well, Steve was, at any rate. But so far as Steve knew, he was, too.
"I mean, I guess you don't have a choice," the voice from his past continued then went quiet as he took a sip. He hadn't turned around from the coffee machine yet, and Steve was
"Got me there. I guess you just have to make sure you're both on the same page with that sort of thing. I only ever did that once—"
"Where's all of Daddy's pitchers?" she asked as she turned her head to take in the room.
With the sparking cake in front of him after the customary chorus of 'Happy Birthday to You,' Steve just laughed and shook his head, and Tony pointed to it and said, "Seriously, can you get any more American than that?"
"Stop apologizing!"
"Any chance those bums had of winning the series. I, of course, took it in stride." He motioned over to Steve with his beer bottle. "Stevie, on the other hand, I think cursed out every single player
Jane opened her mouth to say something, but Darcy made a 'pfft' sound and rolled her eyes and said, "
?" Wilson cried.
"Not to hurt you," Tony said as he sat down at his computer and began to pull up the program he'd set up. "He likes Steve, Steve likes you, so you're golden, really." He looked at DUM-E and said, "No, go on the other side. I need you by his other arm."
would like this nice furniture set I saw—"
"Finger Lakes, or thereabouts," Steve replied as he went over to the bedroom. Tony followed.
He rocked the plug, a slow, gentle rhythm that made Stark clench and unclench his hands over and over, turning his head to press his face into the table.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Fuck's sake, Steve. Grab a sock like everyone else. Or— You know what? Get out here. I'll jerk it for you."
"There's nothing there that shouldn't be there," she muttered, misreading his movements.
Thor shrugged. "I am not certain there is anything to do," he said. "This was a gift bestowed upon you, a way to strengthen and solidify your bond. It is meant to be a joyous moment, as there are many across the galaxy that would give their most prized possessions to be where you are right now."
He flashed the photo at Tony. A grinning little boy with Rhodey’s nose and Mrs. Rhodes’ eyes sat in front of a gigantic cake, covered in candles. (White candles. White candles for subs—purity—and blue candles for Doms—honor.)
should go to his charging station—chop chop!—” Tony made a shooing gesture, “--and
Startled, the girl on the other side of the restaurant hunched down, chastised, and put her phone back in her bag.  Tony couldn’t tell if she’d actually been taking a picture of him and Steve or if they would have been the blurry background for her friends.  Either way, Tony was tempted to salute Jake, but hated to draw any attention.
“Well,” Tony announced after skimming the readings, “whatever it is it isn’t one of those spider things—not related to them in any way as far as I can tell. They weren’t carbon-based organisms and this one is. Sending it to you now, Bruce. You’re the better biologist.”
“Tell him I’m almost there! I just need a couple of minutes!”
“Of course, sir. Running Hypothetical Analysis 1-83,” JARVIS answered. At that moment the energy field began to flicker. “Please stand by,” JARVIS said politely and then a dark shape emerged from the energy field, which was now officially a portal.
Steve’s breath hitched. Tony glanced up and saw his Dominant’s notch bob slowly as he swallowed. The tips of his ears were pink.
Really it didn’t matter what Fury said to Steve.
Steve poured a fresh mug from the caraffee and settled against the headboard; it was a little awkward to drink coffee curled up against Steve and half reclining, but Tony was happy to manage the awkwardness.
“Be even happier to see War Machine, I bet. Stand by—I should be there soon.”
“I don’t know,” Steve said, with a sly smile, “something tells me you’d give me a sandwich just of the asking.”
“Very. I demand casual soul food and going incognito. And, since you’re taking me out to dinner to comfort me because I’m a poor vulnerable little darling in need of soothing, I get what I want.” He fluttered his lashes.
“Is that a good thing?” he asked wearily.
“Well, the best way to help is probably just to leave you to your work.”  He smiled at Tony, that soft gentle smile.  “Good luck, Mr. Stark.”  He bowed, then walked away, seeming almost pleased.
“Just finished,” Tony said, sliding awkwardly from under the satellite. “And, sure. Let’s tackle the data together. My concentration hasn’t been the best this morning.”
Tony found Steve’s hand under the blankets and took it in both of his, but Steve didn’t seem to notice one way or another. Still staring straight ahead.
“Pfft,” Pep let out a dismissive sound.  She stroked a hand through his hair.  “You do plenty.  So, tell me—how’s training going so far?”
“Well actually,” the Captain says with a shy smile, “there is.”
Tony’s mouth was full, so he contemplated his answer while chewing.  Slowly.  He was half tempted to pretend he didn’t know what Rogers meant—“Of course!  The team is getting pizza again tonight!”—but that seemed unnecessary.  Rogers wanted a date.  With him.  Tony swallowed.
It was nice.
Steve reached down to stroke Tony’s cock, hand hot and heavy.
. But it doesn’t matter.” Bruce shook his head. “She’s better off staying clear. She shouldn’t be so trusting.”
you--don’t want to make the decisions.)
“Excited,” Steve said, then added, “Nervous.  You?”
“Nothing went wrong, Tony,” Rhodey said solemnly.
“Mmm,” Tony hummed, stalking closer and giving Steve a deliberate look up and down.  “Does making pancakes always get you hot and bothered?”
“Wear you out, did I?” Clint asked with a grin.
“Hey, so I want a burger and a beer,” Clint said immediately. “Anybody else want in?”
“So, here’s the deal,” Tony said, growing a little more serious. (Deep breath.) “I’m ready to finish the security blanket—using the hybrid we created with a few polyaramid micro-fibers and embedded arc reactors—it’s genius! I don’t really need any more help with it.” Tony gave Bruce an apologetic look.
“Everybody should get to pick out some ornaments for the tree,” Steve said, with the tone of man repeating himself. (Or a patient dad.)
Tony was giving him
Steve nodded again and gave Tony a lingering kiss.
“Don’t you know Stark’s a desperate drunk?”  Tony continued. “He might bash your brains in for a sip of--” Tony grimaced, “Bud Light?  God, if that’s not rock bottom I don’t know what is.”
. (Shit. Shit, shit, shit!)
Fury set the paperweight down very gently and looked up, expression intense.
Tony leaned up to whisper, breath hot against Steve’s ear: “Is this what you thought of? This what you missed? A warm body, here to do with as you please? Did you think of it hard and brutal, against the wall? Want to pound my ass until I can’t sit for a week?”
“Tony?” Steve murmured, leaning forward. He sounded uncertain. “Are you . . . comfortable?”
,” Steve gasped. He flipped them over and pinned Tony’s wrists with one huge hand, pressing him down into the mattress with his entire body. He kissed Tony passionately, his tongue fucking into Tony’s pliant mouth.
I was hoping to find time to make more image manipulations for this chapter but (a) they take me a super long time (b) AO3's image description function hasn't been working for me, so even if I made them, they'd be inaccessible to those using screen readers without an image description anyway.  So I made life easier for myself by not taking time to do manips.  If somebody wants to make the images for me--somebody better at photoshop!--I'd be happy!  But I didn't want to hold up the chapter any longer than it has been already.
Tony licked his lips.
Tony teased Steve and Steve teased back, just as they had done for what felt like forever but was probably only a few weeks. Now that Steve’s first bout of nerves had passed, it felt stunningly familiar except for occasional little moments: like that shy, happy smile Steve had when there was a pause in conversation and he sat, just
It took a little while to put Steve at ease again, but Tony awarded himself an A for effort.  With a little coaxing, Tony soon had Steve waxing rhapsodic about middle eastern art which he’d apparently been reading up on of late.
All in all, things were looking good.
“Scan it, JARVIS!”
And was it all in his head or did JARVIS’s habitual “sir” sound distinctly disapproving?
Steve was going to get “a few things.”
(Time to indulge in a little side project.)
Rogers held up a paper coffee cup and a little bag which read “Anonymous Donuts Ltd” in a retro-looking sans serif font.
Tony snorted. “There’d better be ice cream.”
Tony stroked his chest, teasing his nipples.  He kissed his way down Steve’s body, making him gasp and jerk, as he reached for something at the end of the bed.  Tony came back with a pair of padded leather restraints.  They had heavy metal buckles and a thick metal hoop in the middle.  He held them up for Steve to see.
“What do you mean?”
(And here we go!)
Tony felt his heart twist. “The plan! Agreed. It’s good. I’m not saying we should abandon it, just we could build something that—“
There was a more pronounced sniff.
Tony felt a certain fierce pride at the thought.  How many people were invited to give talks at technical conferences the world over AND were sought after by Orientation & Gender Studies Departments?  He'd been a regular Oscar Wilde on the stand, giving that orientationist fuck of a defense lawyer the witty run around.  And he'd only been threatened with contempt of court five times!
Tony peeked inside the bag.  Oh hell yeah, those éclairs looked good.
“And you said you couldn’t dance!” Tony exclaimed as he moved Steve across the floor in their second waltz. “Look at you now!”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Is there anything else I can--?"
“You’re an angel of mercy,” Tony said. She rolled her eyes.
“I got the contract.”
“So,” Pepper said, filling the carafe with water. “What brings you to my doorstep in the middle of the night, unannounced?”
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Tony tossed his screwdriver aside with a clatter and hopped up to greet her properly.  He tucked himself against her, folding under her arms with his face against her collarbone.  (So fucking tall.)  He wrapped his arms around her slender waist and squeezed tight.
“Really? Wait, what happened. Is she—“
“He all but said I was abusing my power by entering into a relationship with you,” Steve said stiffly.  “Pretty much asked if I’d coerced you.”  Steve stared down at the table. “Or at least if I was certain that I hadn’t coerced you.”
Dummy chirped while Tony oiled his joints.
“You’re in charge,” Tony added. Dom and Switch both nodded with satisfaction. Tony grinned and added, “And, I’m so glad to know that you buy my tech. I’d forgotten. StarkSafe it is.”
Tony was working on the Iron Man suit again when Rogers showed up. He hovered in the doorway, wearing his terrible dockers and rubbing the back of his neck with one big hand.
“It’s entirely Mr. Stark’s prerogative to decide how people address him,” he said firmly to Clint, “and I don’t want to hear another word about it.” Then he turned back to Tony, asking, “Now then, would you like an omelet?”
huge,” Tony said, taking a little step closer.
“May I have the honor of leading you across the dance floor?” Tony asked.
and Chinese food.”
“Steve?”  Tony waited for him to nod, trying to lend his words more gravity.  “I’m sure.”
(Beautiful.)
Rogers laughs. “Of course he does! But somehow Natasha still wins.”
Steve was all curled in on himself, knees up to his chest, arms tight, body closed off. Tony wanted to crawl across the couch and wriggle into Steve’s arms, offer him some human contact, some comfort, but he felt blocked—like he just . . . couldn’t.
Tony approached the alien on the ground. It solidified its resemblance to Steve—this time it had a line for a mouth—and when Tony got into position it put one tentacle around him. Up this close, Tony could see that its entire body was covered in teeny-tiny suckers, like the bottom of an octopus’ arm.
Steve laughed. “Yeah.”
“Sure,” Tony said, pressing his face into the pillow. “Sounds good.”
“I hate you.”
More world-building!  Also things.  And stuff.
(Yeah, apparently he was
Rogers smiled and pulled out a bar stool for him.  Tony snorted and asked, “You know these are my bar stools, right?  They’re not too heavy for me.”
He took a few deep calming breaths and fired the engine, forcing himself to concentrate on the road.  He was heading to the Tower on autopilot before he realized he wasn’t ready to go back yet.  He needed someplace quiet to think, so he could clear his head for a minute.  Not his space;
Steve ended up being gone all day.
It was tempting—not that tiny glass, but a whole bottle—which was why he shook his head. He watched in surprise as Natasha threw back the scotch herself, then vanished the glass into some sort of pocket.
.  If we weren’t famous, I wouldn’t-- )  Steve couldn’t even finish the thought, couldn’t lie to himself, especially not
“No!” Clint shook his head urgently, then grimaced. “Well, yes—but not like that! Just with all the purity bullshit back when Cap was growing up, I figured, even if he always seemed like a basically decent guy there was still . . . stuff. Under there.”
Tony’s jaw fell open for a moment before he snapped it shut.
Tony paused, then added pointedly to the Dom in the doorway, “Won’t you excuse me?”
“No!” Tony answered urgently and too loud.  “God no!  Of course not, Steve.”
Steve blinked and his eyebrows shot up.
“Oh, right.  Yes.  Sure, JARVIS, thank you.”  Bruce shrugged at Steve.  “Science stuff.”
Without really meaning to, Steve flipped forward to the section on pain play— (play?) —and felt bombarded:
I missed you.
“Go ahead,” Tony said in a sultry tone. He dropped his gaze and tilted his head down.
Tony shook his head. “Nope.” He dropped his head to the side and looked up at Steve through his lashes. “I’m
“You shouldn’t have to be. Nobody should.”
Steve hesitated. “It had really good yelp reviews.”
“You mean, that he isn’t--”  Rhodey waved a hand, unwilling to finish the sentence.  Tony gave a wry smirk.
“I know, right?” And, okay, maybe now she was smiling just a little. “Good thing I dumped him.”
“Steve?” Tony asked.
Tony forced a smile. “So, hot dogs, right?”
Natasha looked at him suspiciously. “You’re going to put it on top with your hands, right? Standing on a ladder like a normal person?”
“It was President Nixon, Captain.”
“Everything ok?” she whispered.
forget food, Gina would remember. So, really, everything would be good.)
Tony felt nearly overwhelmed by Steve’s desires.  (And desire for Steve, of course.)  But, looking at the chart, with only one new note it seemed cold and distant, with too little of Steve in it.  He wanted to understand Steve’s thought process more clearly.  He didn’t just want to avoid hurting or upsetting Steve, he wanted to anticipate and
Rogers gnawed on his lip, brow furrowed, looking at Tony very intently.  Tony swirled his glass of scotch and waited.  (Two can use the Pepper Voodoo.)
In the Mandarin above, Tony is trying to practice phrases he might use on a business trip.  It goes roughly like this:
,” Tony grumbled. “Can’t believe you call Rhodey ‘Jim.’”
“Still a genius, though.”
“Tonight?” And was it just surprised pleasure in Steve’s expression, or maybe a bit of relief? “You’re not too busy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh.” And this time he actually sounded kind of disappointed, and maybe just the slightest bit surprised. His brow furrowed. “I see.”
“Carmichael,” Natasha reminded.
The Captain nodded.  “If SHIELD’s projections and your own are correct, it seems too soon, but the, uh, meditation thing you do?  Could you try doing that while we spar, so you can get used to holding your calm while we’re fighting?”
“Be right back.”
“That I have,” Tony said softly.  “That I have.”
“It’s two in the morning,” Rogers said with a bit of a frown.
never filled out a spreadsheet—just Steve.  It was all about Steve, everything they did together.  It was all about what Steve wanted.
“You did?”
Steve was sure Tony’d been close-- he let out a disappointed little sound.  (Why didn’t you come?  I want you to .  . .) Tony was flushed and panting, wild-eyed as he looked at Steve, studying him again.   Tony held his hair tight with his left hand and caressed Steve’s face lightly with his right.  When he ran his fingers across Steve’s lips, Steve opened his mouth to pull them inside and suck.  Tony’s breath hitched.
Tony tried to be a patient man—(Sort of. Sometimes.)—but Bruce was rapidly pushing him to the end of his patience.
Rogers was flipping a pancake when his ass started blaring a poor quality recording of reveille. Rogers jumped. He grunted and reached back for his cell phone grumbling, “Didn’t think the damn thing would be so loud.” He glanced at the screen, then answered, “Captain Rogers speaking . . . Yes, sir. . . I see. Where? I see. Yes, sir. We’ll be there right away.”
“Shhhh,” Tony mumbled, rubbing his back.  “It’s okay. You have permission.  When you’re ready, okay?”
She took one step away from the booth, then turned back to add in a soft voice, “He isn’t always a nice man, but he is a good one.”
Natasha chuckled as Bruce went to get the beautifully arranged tray of cookies and presented it to Steve.
(Beautiful. You’re beautiful.)
“Thanks, sweetheart! I’ve gotta run.”
“JARVIS—blackout windows and lockdown.  Lights 60%.  Temperature 78 degrees.”
“Holy shit!” he repeated closing in on the fellow scientist who was sitting nervously at the conference table in an appalling paisley shirt.
Thank you so much for the kudos and kind words!  Please accept another,  longer chapter as a token of my gratitude.  :-)
How the fuck was this his life?
and the suit; that would open up larger operational problems, but if--)
“Oh, yeah, that shit’s good,” Clint jumped in.  “Remember that place in Tulum, Nat?”
Steve smiled. He finished stripping his lover, and helped him into the tub. Steve hesitated for a moment, before shucking his own clothes and climbing in beside Tony, who was already fumbling around for the soap. Steve laid a light hand on Tony's shoulder. “Would you let me--?” Steve reached out for the soap.
It took great force of will to follow Bruce.
“Ung,”  Steve let out a little grunt and squeezed his eyes shut, bucking up into Tony’s hand.  Tony felt a sudden heady rush.  (Steve liked it, it was good, he was good, he’d make Steve feel good . . .)
Natasha smiled at him and it was always hard to read her expressions, but the way her lips quirked to the side and her brows furrowed looked maybe a little amused, and maybe more than a little sad.
.  He still waited for Tony’s okay.  Rogers’ stance looked a bit like parade rest, hands behind his back, feet apart at the width of his ridiculously broad shoulders.
And Steve was giving him his absolute dopiest smile.
With that, Steve beat a hasty retreat, leaving Tony alone in the living room, staring at the yellowing photograph.
“Yesterday?  What do you mean? I--”  Steve’s heart started pounding.  “N-nothing.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Do you want to talk about it?” Tony frowned. “I feel like we should talk about it.”
“No—just. Just keep talking.” Tony closed his eyes. “Keep talking until I fall asleep.”
The Captain nods. “I have a new friend who works as a counselor at the VA. He told me they’re always short of funding. The waitlist to see a counselor is so long we’re losing people.” Rogers sets his glass of water down too hard; he winces at the loud clatter. His hands curl into fists at his sides. “We have men and women who have served their country in battle, made it safely home, and lost their lives to suicide because they couldn’t see a doctor when they needed one like I did. That’s unacceptable. We wouldn’t leave a soldier in the field bleeding out if we could save them, but we’re letting them bleed out invisibly at home. Our veterans deserve better.”
“Yeah,” Steve said with a soft little smile. “I brought you lunch.”
“Well,” he said, “it’s changed again. Not the same as any previous versions—unless, of course, this is just a stage we’ve never caught before, in which case who knows.”
“Oh, geeze!”
Tony took another sip of cocoa.  Steve opened his mouth to say something (“But it’s still interesting!” or “I like hearing your enthusiasm” or “I know I’m not a genius like you are, but I swear I’m not actually stupid.  Give me a chance!”).  Steve took a sip of cocoa.
: just remember, you’re going to do great. and even if you say something you regret, it doesn’t matter. It will be ok.
“Yes, I will,” she whispered, “Hush, hush.”
“Yes, of course,” Steve said, approaching the workbench. “Hello, Ms. Potts.”
“Hello,” Tony said, as he assumed the hug and fly.
“Tony, about earlier —”
and the venue had been damaged. They’ve rebooked everything and I think you should still attend.”
“So,” Tony said softly, sidling closer so his body almost brushed against Steve’s, “which car shall we take?”
(This was gonna be fun.)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(Shit.)
Tony got up and sauntered to the kitchen. (How he’d made it this long without coffee was a mystery.)
“With pleasure, sir.”
“Steve, I—“ Tony bit his lip. “I’m sorry. About . . . about
Steve’s fingers wandered from Tony’s hair to stroke his neck, his shoulders.
“On and off,” Bruce said. “I saw reruns on TV occasionally, but didn’t watch all of it until college. Oh, hi, Tony,” Bruce said, turning toward the kitchen and catching sight of him. “You didn’t mention that you were getting pizza.”
So sad and sorry to be away from this story for so long.  RL was sad and stressful, but things are steadily improving and I hope to be back on a semi-regular writing schedule until at least October.
Tony reached down to the end of the bed and fumbled around in his Kinky Sex With Steve bag.  He pulled a wet wipe out of the container and, congratulating himself on his foresight, wiped his come from Steve’s skin before it could dry into an uncomfortable mess.  Then he wiped the lube from Steve’s ass and gently cleaned his rim. Tony wiped his own fingers clean, tossed the towelette aside, and shimmied up the bed.
“How are you?”
(Until he couldn’t.  Until I let him down.)
loves this body.)  There was absolutely nothing to be shy about.  (And Tony just said he doesn’t expect some sort of
“What? No! Of course not!” Tony waved a hand dismissively. “Why would I be uncomfortable?”
consider a wide array of possibilities: that he’d been too forward; that Steve was just shy; that Steve wasn’t attracted to him; that he’d done something taboo; or . . . or (absurd! ridiculous!) Steve had simply changed his mind.
—but he bit it down.  There was no point and he just didn’t have the energy.
(And, sure, visiting with a scant thirty-seconds of warning probably counted as dropping by unannounced, but whatever.)
Rogers stared at Tony with a pensive frown for a few moments before looking away.  He was biting his lip again.  He stared down at the table, deep in thought.
“You’d never hurt me,” Steve said solemnly, with absolute confidence.  Tony’s heart clenched.  He let out a strangled little noise, then took a deep breath.
Tony shook his head, half afraid to speak lest he say the wrong thing and make Steve close up again, but Steve seemed to be waiting for an answer, so he said, “Childhood friends, right?”
“Well enough.” Silverstein shrugged. “I confess I’m reluctant to talk about Morgan Stanley with you though.” He gestured to the ballroom expansively. “All anyone wants to talk to me about here is Morgan Stanley; I sought you out since I’m pretty sure you’re the only one here able and willing to talk about the most recent Fields Medalists.”
needed to invent an unobtrusive way to summon the suit...
Tony smiled, warm and relaxed.  (It was good, he was good, they were good . . .) He didn’t usually go to bed so early—and he’d probably wake up in the night—but it had been a long day and, well, there was nothing wrong with having post-scene drowsiness. He let his eyes drift shut.
Rogers fell to his knees, panting. “Thanks,” he said heavily. “Nice . . . nice save.”
Steve bit down on his shoulder and Tony came with a cry, spattering their bellies with cum. Tony clenched down tight around Steve’s dick as waves of pleasure and relief shook his body.
Tony shook out his shoulders and nodded.
"Well then," Phillips said, he raised his glass.  "To Eire."
“It wasn’t a lie,” Cap protested, then hedged, “well, not really. You
“Show off.  And you say you hate it when the press follows you around.  That helmet wasn’t designed to attract attention *at all.*”
“Great! Yes. Email. Awesome.”
“Tony?” Steve called.  “Are you ready to go?”
“I didn’t mean it,” Tony said, taking a step closer. “I shouldn’t have said that. Any of it.  I didn’t mean it.”
“Oh. Good.” Rhodey bumped his shoulder into Tony’s. Tony smiled up at him. “You’ve got a good team,” Rhodey told him again. “It’s good you’re coming up. Unit cohesion and all that.”
(Oh fuck.  Fuckity-fuck-fuck.  Come on.  Words, Tony.  In actual sentences.)
Tony's entire body went tense at Rogers' voice, but he squashed the impulse to move, to scramble up onto the couch.  So he'd seen Tony on his knees now-- so what?  Tony had nothing to be ashamed of.  (Fuck you, Rogers.  I'm a sub.  I kneel sometimes,
“I figured JARVIS had a soft spot of
“Me?”
They’d discovered the creatures hated fire—their webs were particularly flammable—so now New York City was burning. Small controlled fires (for now) to help confine them to the park, but the smoke rising into the air filled Tony’s heart with dread. Too many memories.
“Wow,” Sasha blinked still looking a little surprised.  “Good for you! What’s he like?”
“Yeah.”  Tony took another sip of scotch, deliberating for a moment before he added, “And I oughtta know.  Firsthand experience and all that.”  Tony shrugged.  “You can read about it, you know.  On wikipedia and whatnot.  Hell, there are dissertations written about the trial transcripts alone.”
Steve was really sucking cock. His cock. With determination and (it seemed) pleasure.  Fully clothed. On his knees.
somehow, but Tony couldn’t figure it out.  Tony took a sip of his wine.   “I know he’s Captain America.”  She said it like the idea weighed heavily on her.  Like that should mean something to Tony beyond the obvious.
Tony probably wasn’t blushing—it was just hot in the shower, right? He slid gracefully to his knees.
be playing here,” Tony told Clint venomously.
“Tony, I’m fine.  Just a little banged up.”
“Maybe we should—” Cap began, but he didn’t get to finish. A thick web shot from the spider-alien’s spinneret to wrap around a nearby agent, pulling him towards it with shocking speed. Black Widow sprang into action, glittering knife unsheathed in a second, ready to cut the web.
Tony groaned.
“Can you tell me where Steve is?”
—having pre-marital sex. But maybe he didn’t approve of it for himself?)
“Right,” Rogers said briskly. “I’ll reinforce the camp and prepare a full guard rotation. Best to be prepared.”  Tony tried not to roll his eyes.  (Boy Scout. Duh.)
The Muse has been a little difficult lately, so musings (heh), questions, and curiosity are extra encouraged and appreciated.  Thanks and more thanks.  <3 <3 <3
“You’re working on something,” Bruce said, squinting at the screen.  “Should I come back?”
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Rogers asked.
(Okay, where the hell did I put those tiny fucking screws?)
Tony swallowed.  “Mmm-hmm,” he muttered.
On the common floor-- formerly part of Tony’s own penthouse goddam it-- Tony followed the same routine calling out identifications: kitchen, gaming console, home theater, and so forth.  Tony’s space was all crisp black and white, sleek lines and sharp angles . . . metal, mirrors, and glass.
He was so goddamn sick of waiting.
“Tony!” Pepper cried in alarm when he set down at the landing pad later that evening. “What’s wrong?”
“Asshole,” Clint said affectionately. Tony laughed.
“Well, excuse me, if I find it a little insulting that *real* heroes are being beaten on the commercial market by a fictitious alien who would *so totally loose* to the Hulk!”  Tony waved his hands, narrowly avoiding his glass of wine.  “And our stuff raises money for children’s hospitals and disabled veterans!  They’re just using the money to fuel more shitty Batman movies.”
.) Tony bit his lip. (Steve went to Mass alone all the time, but was it depressing on Christmas Eve? Should he maybe offer to go too?) Tony grimaced. (Ugh.)
“Ok,”  Steve said. “It’s ok, Tony.”
“All right, Avengers! Meet outside in ten!”
Tony thought he might have dozed off for a few minutes; he felt alert and rejuvenated when he stirred again in a way he hadn’t earlier.
+++++++++
Steve was stroking his ass, his hips.  (Or was he planning something more ambitious?  Cane or single tail?)  Tony shivered.  He loved a good whipping, but without the right training and practice whip work could go south pretty easily. And Tony was tied facing out into the room, so Steve didn’t have access to his buttocks or back, the safest targets for most impact play.
Pepper’d be proud, though, right? They’d finally talked about Howard! And wouldn’t you know it, dear old dad was even a condescending dick to the man he later called his best friend. Name-dropping bastard. Tony grimaced.

“Do you have any questions about the menu?” their server asked.
’d leave Cap covered in bruises.)
“We have awesome vacation benefits!” Scotch sloshed over the left edge. “I know: I overhauled that program! But when did I actually manage a proper vacation, huh?”
Steve looked at him with big sad eyes, but nodded.
Rogers’ hair was perfectly combed and absurdly shiny.  His dockers were still terrible, but the white t-shirt stretched across his glorious chest left little to the imagination and more than made up for the dockers.  With his ridiculous muscle mass, he should have been lumbering and awkward, but Rogers moved with a certain easy grace that—
Tony took a deep breath and steeled himself. There would be people there he knew and disliked, and people he didn’t know yet, but would dislike, but there were still a few he knew and liked—so perhaps there would be some he didn’t know and would like? And, with a little more luck, Tony might get lucky and not leave with the rest of the group . . .
Shit’s about to get real in my bill-paying career (aka insanely high-stress and sleep-deprived-making)...  Extra cheer-leading is extra appreciated for the next couple of months!  (Like, maybe, if there's a little detail you especially liked in this chapter....?)  I'm hoping I can keep on my 3-4 week posting "schedule", but that may be overly optimistic. I promise I’ll let you know if I'm vanishing for more than a month at a time, though, and I'll give you an expected return date.
Also:
“You want me to fuck your mouth,” Tony growled.
“Don’t be silly—it’s not dark with the tree shining like that.” Steve shrugged. “I just wanted to spend a little while enjoying it before leaving for midnight Mass.”
“Ew,” Clint said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Does inventing a highly marketable poly-aramid fabric get me off the hook for the Quarterly Report?”
“What, now?” Tony asked, incredulous.
There was a time Tony would have chuckled at that or said “Hurry up, stud, it’s not rocket science.”
(Shit!)
(She’d had more surgery yesterday, right? Clint would know . . .)
“Well,” Bruce said, taking off his glasses with a sigh. “None of these theories seem to be playing out.  And,” Bruce added with an amused little smile, “judging by how often you’ve checked the clock, I bet you’re hungry again.  Want to order Thai?”
“Mmmm. Yeah, water,” Pepper chimed in. “Tony, needs more water. To not. Not. Hangover.” Pepper burped and giggled.
Steve bit his lip.  “I think it’s always been what I wanted, but it used to be complicated. I—” Steve glanced away, frowning.  He was silent.  Tony waited.  Steve was silent so long that Tony found himself struggling not to say something, to fill the gap with his usual rambling.  He ran his hand up Steve’s back to caress his neck, rubbing soothing little circles.  Steve remained quiet.  Maybe Tony really did need to prompt him.  Be more specific maybe?  Tony was considering it when Steve finally spoke, his voice frustrated: “Does it really matter? I mean, I know
Steve glared at him.
“All of it?” Tony blinked. “Or did something in particular get a bee in your bonnet?”
“Don't.”
“Don’t tell me you’re leaving so early,” she said. “I only just found you!”
5 am in Avengers’ Tower.
“Are you kidding?” Tony asked, waving his nearly empty wine-glass.  “Do you really think Mrs. Rhodes would let us get away with—“
“If you’re here to claim the winnings, Captain, no dice,” he said. “You never paid in.”
“Hey, Dummy, pass me the bobbin tray, would you?”
“Tony!”
“Maybe,” Steve said, “if you wanted, I could draw something else for you. Like on a commission—whatever you want.”
TRIGGER WARNINGS in Author's Note.
“Nah, chicks dig the
“Sure, yeah,” Tony said, once again feeling that uneasy guilt at his own relief.
“And this,” Tony said softly, “is a closed hold.”
“Yes, sir.”
Steve shrugged. “Me neither, but your garage is immense. Figured I’d just drive her around, slow and easy, for a few minutes to get a feel. Can get my leathers and take her out proper tomorrow if the weather’s decent.”
(Shit.)
“Well, I guess I’d better get going,” Tony said without enthusiasm.
“I notice that as we’ve been talking, you always refer to your teammates by code name or title when you talk about them. Are you always that formal?”
Tony ran a soothing hand across his shoulders. “It’s okay,” Tony murmured. “You’re right. Uh, boundaries and stuff. I shouldn’t be so nosey.”
Bruce was already handing him a cup of coffee—because Bruce was the
“AC/DC, JARVIS. And make it loud.”
“Whoa!” Clint said, backing away. “What’s the matter with you?”
“I want to make you incoherent with lust and pleasure until you’re a quivering wreck in my arms and then I want to stroke your hair when you’re coming down and tell you what a good boy you are, how perfect.  I want you, Steve.  All of you.”
doing this. Whatever this is.  Nothing; it’s nothing.)
“Yeah. He’s actually the one who convinced me to go see her, because she’d helped him so much. I, uh—I didn’t want to go at first, for stupid reasons, but Rhodey can be damn persuasive.”
Tony closed his eyes, breathing heavily.  He held back, of course— he had to be careful of Steve, be good to him,  go slowly.  (Oh fuck, he’s inexperienced!  Don’t rush.  There’s time.)  Steve’s past was a network of landmines Tony was terrified to step on.  (Nothing that sounds like a slur, stupid.  He’s heard enough insults.  And why the fuck do you want to call your boyfriend a whore, anyway?)
Natasha slid into the kitchen.
Finally!  Sorry was so slow!  Thanks for all the kind words and support and to thatwhichyields for tons of hand-holding and working me out of writer's block.
Tony held back a sigh. (So much for a night off.)
+++++++++++++++
Hulk’s eyes turned brown and--in a now familiar transformation--he seemed to fold in on himself, leaving Bruce naked and trembling in his place. Nat hurried forward with his (redesigned) thermal robe.
Rogers nodded, but didn’t say anything. Tony took a seat and tried to gather his thoughts. (Well, gather them beyond, ‘shit.’) Rogers did not sit. The silence lingered for a few long moments until finally Rogers spoke. (Oh thank God!)
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and took a deep breath.
“Guns on the suit are an abomination!”
Rogers set the remote down very carefully on the coffee table and stood.  Tony's heart was pounding and his mouth was dry.
“Hello?” Steve tried again.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Hi.”
(Uh, you weren’t so into my latest suggestions—to fuck me, to throw me around in the training room . . . Besides, what I really want is—)
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand.
He knew he shouldn’t. It would be foolish to go to
“Sir, might I point out th—”
too long if
“You’re perfect,” Steve said, pressing in with his fingers again. “And I want you to come for me. Come whenever you’re ready, darling.”
Clint shrugged. “I like shooting things.”
Pepper leaned forward to give him one of those awkward upper-body hugs.  She drew away quickly and paused.  “Tony?”  she asked softly.  Oh.  That wasn’t her car after all.
Tony had a habit of losing track of the days of the week, unless he had some pressing reason (and external force to help him) do so. But when he wandered into his—
“I know you’re taking me out on a date tonight,” Steve said, a little shyly, “but I was on my way back from my appointment and passed a flower shop and thought it would still be okay to get you these.”
“It is 7:13 am and thirty-three degrees in New York City.”
(Hardly a rousing, ‘Yes let’s get it on like bunnies!’ . . . Was this what they meant by “Catholic guilt?”)
One by one, everyone reported in.
“But Steve? Seriously? I mean, I love the guy—honest—but he seems like, well, kind of a prude. And you’re—“
"Omegas are rare in Manottan, more so than here in Eire," Phillips said. "But desirable, especially the, uh, uninitiated."
“Hey, Steve, at ease. Just me. So, hey, I was wondering what time you want to watch
Tony hesitated for a moment then came closer.  “Are you sure?”
Tony took another sip of coffee and came a little closer. There was dirt on Steve’s boots and dirt on the left knee of his uniform.
“How can you joke about it!?” Rogers cried. The man floundered. He looked like he wanted to rip somebody’s arms off. “It’s—it’s—“
Steve blinked and, having no good reason not to, followed Tony to the couch.
“You’re making that up,” Bruce said. “And it’s not helpful.”
“Fine.”  He paused.  “It’s . . . They're . . .
Steve’s voice sounded raw. Tony held him close and whispered, “Yeah, it is.”  He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“God!”  Steve gasped, slamming Tony into the wall and sending the breath out of him with a cry.  “Tony, fuck.  I want you, want you so bad.”
“Sir?” JARVIS called. “Sir, I am very sorry to wake you, but it is noon.”
He'd just snoop around a little bit.  Okay.  What kind of username would Captain America pick?  Well, start with the obvious.
Thank you so much for your support and sorry for the long wait for this chapter! I ran into trouble with this chapter and needed to do some planning ahead for the rest of the story (and the next one too!).  I'm still not entirely happy with this chapter but figured I had better post it and move on or Steve and Tony will be stuck in limbo indefinitely.
“You’ve got me,” Steve said, taking Tony in his arms.  “I’m right here, sweetheart.”
(Maybe he should ask Bruce to cross check the diffusion spikes with nearby storm patterns. Maybe lightning would--)
“Safeword,” he answered.
“No!” Tony protested. He waved his arms and knocked a screwdriver to the floor with a clatter. Tony scrambled awkwardly to retrieve it as Rhodey walked around the workbench to stand where he could see Tony’s expression more clearly.
“Tony? Hey, Tony? Are you still— Is that a sewing machine?”
“I love you too,” Steve answered, but the words sounded oddly hollow and insufficient in reply.
“Hands behind your back,” Tony said, voice firm and strong, ringing across the workshop.  Steve’s cock jumped and he hurried to comply.  Without breaking eye contact, Tony unlaced his shoes, slowly, then removed them.  He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, hands steepled, giving Steve an intense look.  Steve didn’t move.
: feels like it does matter
(What the fuck was the matter with him this morning?)
wanted to hear: “I brought you coffee.”
Bruce nodded again. “Still, it's never fun to see him like this.” He stirred the pot serenely. “I'm glad I've left the obsessed, workaholic, self-destructive phase of my career long behind me.”
The handsome agent shrugged and a strand of jet-black hair fell across his forehead.
“Yes.”
"So," Phillips said musingly.  "You've grown up in Brookline Castle--you've heard some of the threats facing Eire.  Raiders attacking the North Coast.  And we lost a lot of men to the recent famine, to the troubles. Helping Queensland beat back Hydra cost us dearly."
They all nodded, listening attentively. Tony continued, “Also, if you want my legal team to look at your contracts, just let me know and I’ll get them on it. Some of you may have more PR wiggle room than I do, so that would be good to know, right? Right. Okay, great! And now, pizza.”
“Mr. Stark?” Rogers said. “Would you have dinner with me?”
— don’t need that kind of PR.”
“And I’ll have the Californian.  And, hey, could you have them toss some arugula on those, just to annoy Steve?”
“Yeah,” Tony answered roughly into Rhodey’s sweatshirt, then said more forcefully as he pulled away, “Yeah, what the fuck?  What the hell happened?”
“Hey, JARVIS?  Get me Rogers on the phone.”
“Sir?  Might now be an opportune time to get some rest?”
Tony didn’t know what to say, so he just squeezed Steve’s hand and smiled at him.
“Captain Rogers,” she said, turning to Steve with a polite nod. “It’s nice to meet you. Please follow me.”
“Great,” Tony said, puzzled. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Steve shook his head, still looking hesitant.
“Ah, ah!”
“Steve!” Tony cried (part petulance, part supplication).
“May I?” Steve asked, reaching for the check.
“Oh, hey, this joint really needs it, doesn’t it?” Tony asked softly.  He unscrewed Dummy’s 88-bolt and eased the oil can in.  The little bot let out a whirring noise.
(Okay, somebody was
“Lay off,” Tony hissed, trying to be quiet. At this rate, asshole was probably gonna leave a bruise on his arm.
“I'm making beef stew for dinner, but for now it's just sandwiches, chips, and veggies.”
Tony shook his head, at a loss. (He knew what it was like. The questioning.) Tony wanted to give Steve a hug, but he didn’t.
Steve was still on the couch, with the blanket over his lap. Tony nearly snorted. (Waiting for that erection to go down, are we?)
Tony set his mug down a little too hard.
Tony smiled, a little relieved. He didn’t want to hurt Rhodey’s feelings.
(I’m Tony Stark.  Of course it’s perfect.)
Steve nodded, still looking kinda uneasy.
Tony smiled. Sam Deetz and Rebecca Martinez met at the fundraiser for an exhibit of medieval manuscripts she’d helped curate. The paleographer and the industrialist: a match made at the Met.
A strange part of Steve felt moved to confess—to share something private in the dark quiet of Tony’s bedroom, sitting side by side, but not looking at each other. Like in a confessional.
“Of course. Take your time.”
that they’d found Captain America a month ago, but he hadn’t been expecting to see him either.  He swallowed, and his pulse sped just slightly.
? Stark Something . . . ok, name needed work…—was still on his bench, its dissected interior visible under a plastic sheet Pepper had no doubt placed there to protect it from dust. (Darling Pepper!) Tony whisked the cover off with a flourish and stared down at the mess of chips, processors, and circuits.
“You made that up, didn’t you?” Tony asked.
(It was a long time ago.)
Cap looked at him, startled for a second, then held out his hands. Tony almost teased him—“Velcro fasteners? So modern!”—but he kept quiet, afraid it would sound mocking.
“Sir?  Perhaps now would be a good moment to remind you—once again—of Ms. Winters’ emails.”
He clutched at Tony’s shoulder and hid his face with his arm. Steve held his breath-- he tilted his hips and drew his knees up towards his chest in silent invitation.
“Looking good, Rhodey,” Tony said, then glanced around. “Where’s this Miranda I’ve heard so much about? Is she—“
Steve nodded, obviously relieved.  “Yeah.  Be right back.”
Tony flipped the faceplate up and skimmed over the data.
(Yes, Steve.)
Tony stared him down. (From below, but whatever.)  “Yeah. And--?” Tony prompted.
“Oops.”
Steve swallowed thickly. “Bucky was working two jobs after school, so I wasn’t seeing him much then. I left a note for him at Magdalene House, just saying that I’d presented and my party was on Sunday at eight. I wanted to see his expression when he found out.” Steve sighed.
(Okay, that does it.)
“Bullshit.  Total bullshit.”  Tony shook his head.  “All right, enough stalling. What have you done to it?  Where’s the suit?”
“Very well, sir.”
“Hey, how about some
Tony grinned. “Yeah, but you’re too nice.”
Tony squinted at the triple reinforced seams of Natasha’s uniform, making sure nothing was out of place.
Rogers’ trousers were too short for him. Of course.
Steve turned the key and she purred to life.
Natasha smiled and reached out to touch Steve’s shoulder very lightly for a moment, then slid away.
(Fan-fucking-tastic.)
(Shit. What do I say?)
“Yeah, no thanks. Never again. Your mechanical Easter bunny made my nephew cry and the kids only found
“Tony,” he murmured again, nuzzling Tony’s neck. He kissed Tony’s cheeks, his neck, his forehead, then—breathing a little calmer—murmured in his ear, “Tony? How about I take you up to your place?”
Steve squinted at his StarkTab for a moment.  Then Tony added (predictably):
Agent Richards. Clint’s ex.
“Hey, does this mean we get to fight over who gives Tony the first shovel speech?” Clint called.
“NOOOOOOO!!!” the dragon roared, then shattered into little shards of light.  Tony blinked.  Natasha was hanging from one of the ceiling ropes where the dragon had been projected.
“Someone asked me earlier if my feelings for you were ‘love at first sight’,” Steve continued quietly, keeping a generous space between them and the other dancers. “I realize now they weren’t.  I mean, it felt like it back when we met; I was so smitten. But my, uh, therapist is right. I didn’t love you then--I didn’t even know you. I loved the idea of you. But now--now I
Tony took a deep breath and tried to speak more calmly. He wasn’t good at it. “Look. We’ve been over this. We have a plan. The plan is good. For once, there’s a plan and I like it. It’s a good plan. Hear this? This is me. Wanting to stick to a plan!”
“Damnit,” Clint said, tone vicious, “you knew and you didn’t say anything.”
“Tony, you’re *early.*”
“Yes?” Rogers prompted. He said it with such sweet openness—not quite hope, but something like it.
Tony gave Cap a little toss and he vaulted in front of the creatures, braced with his shield in front of him. Tony fired the repulsors at its surface full blast in a hard continual stream, while Rogers redirected the energy to hit all three spiders. Tony shot two more shoulder missiles. One of them twitched, then flopped over, legs convulsing in recognizable death throes. Down to two spiders. Tony called the one on the right, leaving Cap the one on the left. Tony hovered in the air and hit his over and over with repulsor beams while Rogers hammered at his with the shield, using it sometimes as a bludgeon, sometimes as a projectile. Cap dodged and weaved out of the creature’s grasp, jumping nimbly away and back. He landed a blow between its body segments that sent it belly up just as Tony’s spider did the same. Tony landed and flipped the faceplate up.
And, though Tony wouldn’t have minded another quiet word with Johnny, he wasn’t sorry to see him herding Dominic away post-haste.
“Say hello to Mrs. Rhodes for me,” Tony demanded.
She remained silent, though whether it was because she didn’t know what he meant (which he doubted), was ashamed (doubted even more), or because admitting it would be giving ground (most likely) he didn’t know for sure.
“Uh, anyway,” Tony said, taking a long sip.  “Thanks.  You know, for the coffee. And the AC-23s, the package.”
“It’s Warren Buffet, isn’t it? I’ll destroy Berkshire-Hathaway!”  Tony paused dramaticaly, then asked, “Or is it the genius part? ‘cause Stephen Hawking isn’t as smart as people think he is! Neither’s Selvig!”
Steve smiled. “Sounds great. I’ve liked all the
“It’s fine,” Steve said, starting to feel embarrassed now that the anger-adrenaline was fading.  He felt drained.  “I, uh, overreacted.”
Tony took a gulp of coffee like it was Dutch courage, then asked, “Seriously, are you all right?”
Bruce pointedly picked up the copy of
interested.”  He added ruefully, “Even when I don’t entirely understand.”  He shrugged.  “I mean, I know I’d never be able to keep up with you and Bruce no matter what I did, but it
“You want it don’t you, babe?”
“Mrs. Rhodes,” Cap said, with a wide grin and unmistakable enthusiasm, “it’s such a pleasure to meet you. And, please, call me Steve.” He took her small hand in his giant one. “Your son is a wonderful man—it’s an honor to serve with him. You must be very proud.”
“What can I say,” Tony dodged, “he’s an old fashioned guy!”
Little by little, the tension left Bruce’s body as they breathed in unison. Bruce rested his cheek on the top of Tony’s head and rubbed his shoulders. Tony smiled. Bruce, Rhodey—the Doms in his life were all the same: they only seemed to take comfort by offering it, even if it was an illusion. They’d rather be the one giving the hug, playing the big spoon. Tony wondered vaguely if there were actually some sort of neurochemical aspect to it, or if they were just socialized only to accept comfort indirectly. In the end, Tony supposed it was unknowable and he didn’t particularly care since he’d figured out how to do what he could for the Doms he cared about.
“Well done, team,” Rogers said beaming around the gym at them.  Tony flipped the faceplate up and grinned. He hadn’t had this much fun in . . . well, he actually couldn’t remember the last time he’d had this much fun.  (Especially such
(But maybe . . . )
“I want you all to know up front,” Steve began seriously, “that it isn’t prohibited in our contracts and will in no way impair our performance in the field. We’re telling you as our teammates, but more importantly, as our friends. See, Tony and I— We, uh—“
It was 4 am by the time they got back to the Tower, dirty and exhausted, but unharmed.  Steve and Tony lingered in the hallway after the others had said good night and vanished to their suites.
“Good boy.”
“That didn’t make it into the film reels,” Tony said.
Although it felt interminable, the meeting actually lasted only thirty-three minutes. Tony bolted from the room as soon as they adjourned.
Steve was sort of frowning down at the table, not meeting Tony’s eyes.
“How many fingers?”
After a moment the fury seemed to melt out of Steve, though, leaving him tired and sad.  “That’s really what you think of me?” he asked.  “That I’d, what? Use Tony and then toss him aside? That I don’t lo— care deeply about him?”
“I have others,” she answered, the ghost of a smile playing at the corner of her lips.
“I never seem to get things right with you,” Rogers said softly, staring down at his coffee. Then he looked up to ask, “Are you angry with me?”
“Did it come with a mate?” Tony asked, gesturing to his corsage.
“Father Gabe gave us each a little St. George medallion before we left for Basic Training and we wrote to him from France,” Steve said, tone wistful. He gave a little shrug.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Bruce laughed as they looked at the menu options.
Fucking Howard. Tony took a sip of scotch. Fucking Howard and his fucking obsession. His old man said he knew everything there was to know about Captain America, but Tony was starting to think he hadn’t known Steve Rogers at all.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“What do you mean?”  Tony asked and examined the silver. “Going on?  Nothing!”  He glanced up again.  “And stop giving me that look.  You know, you treat me like a naughty schoolboy on a regular basis.  And not in a sexy roleplay kinda way.  What’s up with that anyhow?”
(Please give me the courage I need to face what lies ahead, whatever it may be.  Thank you, Lord, for bringing Tony into my life, for this miracle.  Thank you for giving me back a sense of home, a sense of purpose.  Thank you for my friends, for their patience and generosity.  For letting me serve my country.)
They stood there, looking at each other uneasily.
“How do you define it?” Steve asked immediately.  (And wasn’t Steve just adorable when he was inquisitive?)
“Yes, but it’s the one that’s most directly under the power of our government. So I’ve written to my representatives to suggest a bill that would provide additional funding for the VA to assist veterans with PTSD.”
Rogers shrugged. “You’re welcome.”  They stood watching as the various parts of the spectrometer lit up, one by one, in sequence.  It was a beautiful sight.
(Of course, they came down when he’d presented; Cap was supposed to be his role model, not his pin-up fantasy.)
“Of course, sir.”
“Nope! It’s fine! Just a side project. But you’re early, aren’t you? I thought we were meeting around lunchtime.”
“For fuck’s sake, you’re only human!” Tony snapped back. “Or do you actually think you’re some sort of resurrected demi-god who can bear the world on his shoulders? ‘Cause that’s pretty fucking arrogant if you do!” Tony waved his hands, and narrowly avoided throwing his coffee. He jabbed a finger at Steve, coming closer. Steve took a step back.
“Yeah, I know that,” Tony snapped.  “But all your alpha displays, they remind people of my orientation.”
“Mr. Stark?”
“Good to see you too,” Rhodey grunted. “And you know I can’t tell you.”
“I said hold steady!” Steve repeated, actually knocking back one of the SHIELD Agents who had started running towards the Blob.
“So, here’s a thought,” Tony said, putting his sunglasses back on. “Let’s have this meeting once we’ve actually had some time to think and prepare. You know, engage in a dialogue and all that shit.”
every submissive I met—and nobody said anything!  I couldn’t even tell, and--”

Pepper’s face flashed up on a glowing screen. She was wearing her navy blue pajamas, the ones with the white piping that Tony’d given her for Christmas two years ago. She looked baffled.
“We both have,” Tony corrected. “But I
“Suck,” Steve ordered, pushing two fingers into Tony’s mouth.  Tony obeyed eagerly, desperately, like sucking on Steve was the only thing that could relieve this ache.  He was half ready to beg for Steve’s dick, wanting it to choke him, hard and thick down his throat, when Steve pulled his fingers away.
“Michael and I have a few suggestions for upcoming PR, if you have a moment.”
Her face lit up.  “Steve,” she repeated.  “We, that is, some of the other SHEILD trainees and I were going to go out this evening.  Just drinks, maybe some dancing and karaoke, and we, well,
“Pretty good,” Tony said with a shrug.  “We’re just getting started.  I want Bruce to let go; it’ll be good for him and for the team.  Hulk’s a force to be reckoned with--will be a real asset.  But we have to get past Bruce’s walls first.”
Tony waved it off.
“At Stark Industries?” Bruce asked squinting. “Who would call me there, I wonder.”
“So, any jobs for me?” Tony asked Mrs. Rhodes, though he really despised cooking.
“No, I’ll go,” Natasha assured him and, light and swift on her feet as ever, she glided after Bruce.
“Tones, that’s bad,” Rhodey said, brow creased. “Do you think he’s talked to the others?”
“Of course. Um, I can go, if you’d rather I—“
(Tom was pretty sure the whole ‘innocent, calm, unconcerned’ thing was a ploy to get under Rogers’s skin; it seemed to be working.)
Steve shoved his hands in his pockets and watched Tony walk away.  Natasha appeared at his elbow.
Natasha was waiting. “We’re watching
“I’m not asking you to,” Tony said with muted exasperation. He took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. “You said you heard the conversation. Did you know what Title III of the Submissives’ Protection Act is?”
The fully actualized, mini-spectrometer was a gloriously satisfying sight, not least of all since it meant he and Bruce could get the fuck out of SHIELD.  Tony had no reason to stay, and plenty of reasons to go. And once Tony made a decision, he liked to follow though, often abruptly. And loudly.
Strange that Rogers would use that phrase when Tony hadn’t even thought of it. Not that Rogers was
“My pleasure, sir,” JARVIS said.  Tony took a deep breath and read over the familiar numbers once more.
“They were really good to me,” Steve said. “And the food was always amazing.”
Steve shook himself and focused on the present.  (There’s nothing wrong with me.  *Nothing* wrong with me.  Nothing wrong with *us.*)  He took a deep breath.  (These are my friends.)
“That’s good! Stop,” Tony told the elevator suddenly.  “Here’s fine.”  He hit the button just to be sure.
Steve felt the wind knocked from his lungs at that look. (
It was a good date.  A lovely date.
Tony gave Pepper a blank look of his own.
“By definition, right?” Tony rolled his eyes and continued past him. “Well, keep your cool.  I’m getting close enough, not ‘too close’.”
“Maybe they thought putting this crap out right after the press conference would give their B.S. a credibility boost?” Clint speculated.
Tony settled on the edge of the couch.  “Besides, that ad told you all you need to know: buy this car and you’ll attract sexy subs!”
Steve twitched. For a second, Tony thought Steve was going to reach up and hug him, or press his face to Tony’s stomach, but the moment passed.
(Oh.  Apparently she wasn’t going to wait after all.)
“Yeah,” Steve said with a sad sigh and unfocused eyes.
“G’morning, gorgeous,” Rebecca said. “Sleep well?”
“Mr. Stark?  Are you-- oh!  I'm sorry!”
(They hadn’t meant to linger over hotdogs, but Steve got to chatting with the vendor, then they needed hot chocolate and it was a bit of a walk—anyway.)
“I’d mind.” Steve shook his head. “I’m not gonna ask someone on a date if I don’t mean it. And I couldn’t actually— I mean, I’m not --“ Steve looked away again.
“Come on, your grandson would probably get a kick out of you having the same chauffeur as Captain America.”
“Um. Yes?”
And he’d fall for Tony of all people?
Tony blinked. (Wait, did he mean--?) Rogers shook his head, expression amused. “That really was an accident, but they kept making me do the damn paperwork on this mini-device with a touch screen and, I mean, I’ve got such huge hands now and I’d never even
“They’re nothing like
“Cool. See you later then,” Clint said, then paused for a moment. “And Steve? Good fight earlier. I—Yeah. Good fight.”
Tony squirmed and pressed into Steve’s touch. His cock—now fully hard—throbbed and twitched, bobbing in the air, sometimes brushing against Steve’s clothes.  Tony realized with a hot humiliated rush that he was leaking pre-cum all over Steve’s nice black dress pants.  It might stain.
Thank you so much for joining me in the world of P&P!  It has been such a wonderful, happy, healing place for me and it's a joy to have you here with me.  Thank you.  *gives you a bashful Steve smile*
Tony perked up. Armchairs could be extravagant! Some of them might even come close to a Ferrari!
“Aye,” the Northman answered with pride.  “That he did.”
“May I wish you a happy and prosperous new year, sir?” JARVIS asked.
“Oh, hey, listen to this,” Clint called, turning back to the paper and reading out: “’Ms. Romanov was dynamically sublime in a curve-hugging Versace gown; the emerald satin V-neck paired beautifully with her auburn hair to give her the air of an exotic flower.’ Hear that, Nat? You’re dynamically sublime. You know, like an exotic flower or some shit.”
ta-da!  the main course...
“You’re a good man, Tony Stark.”
“Would you recite some for me?” Tony asked.
. Green! Please!”
“Yes, of course,” Professor Ellis said with a smile.  “It’s nice to see you again, Mr. Rogers.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, with an unconvincing shrug. Then he added, “We’re gonna have to meet with SHIELD soon.” He frowned then asked, “How much longer until we can go to the ranch do you think? Are your projects almost done?”
“Hey.”
Tony threw back his head and laughed. He laughed so hard he wheezed and began to cough. Steve frowned.
Two couples--one of them Harry and Sasha!--nearly collided with Steve and Tony’s unexpectedly stationary bodies.
(And, oh man, if that was his first attempt, Tony was one very lucky sub.)
“What time is it, J?”
(What did he want?)
or not?”
Farhad arrived with their next course: a large plate of
“And, you know,” Tony said, “if what I’ve sampled so far is just you running on instinct, I’d say you’re a natural.”
“Is there—” Rogers hesitated, glanced over at Tony before turning back to the force field.  “Is there something wrong with the contract?”
Tony grinned.  “Your place or mine, baby?”
The word hovered in the air for a moment before Rhodes continued, “But going through D.C. sucks and I hardly ever get to see Tony these days. So when I scored some time in New York at the last minute, I figured I’d use the layover to visit my favorite billionaire genius.” He threw an arm around Tony’s shoulders in a rough pseudo-hug.
“Well, I’m only getting fonder. If I could write a yelp review, they’d get five stars.”
Steve took a deep breath and smiled.  He had a date.
Tony swallowed. For a moment, he was on the verge of explaining that this was the most politic thing to say since otherwise half the audience would be pissed at Tony for making a big deal out of chivalrous nothing, and the other half (okay, 10%) would be pissed at Steve for not already knowing things nobody had taught him yet and all of it would just undermine the reality that—
“On ten, sir.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Confused, Clint set aside the
Tony gave a bit of a nod and a shrug.
So when Clint stampeded into his workshop the next day calling out that they were showing Rogers
Tony rolled his eyes.
“But,” Carmichael faltered, “we haven’t even started going through the briefing packets I made you!”
“Of course, sir.”
He leaned back in and fumbled for Steve’s belt again.
“Thank you, Rebecca,” Tony said, taking a deep breath.  That conversation had turned unexpectedly
“Mmm,” Tony murmured with approval, shifting against the headboard. He pulled at Steve’s shoulder, turning him until they were facing each other. “So.”
“Mr. Stark?”
“I realize I haven’t been studying very long,” Steve continued falteringly, “so I will understand completely if you’re not comfortable with the idea, but if you’d like—if you wanted—I’d be honored to, uh, spend the night. With you.”
Shit. Yeah, that was pretty embarrassing. It was one thing for Rhodey to do it—he’d been looking after Tony’s drunken ass since he was too young to drink, so it was practically tradition—but Steve . . .
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled.
smile at Tony or looked out the window or stroked his thumb lightly across the back of Tony’s hand. (It was terribly distracting.)
2005, stupid. You just have a crack PR team on the job to muzzle them.)
“Yeah, but it’s not just that,” Tony said, not quite sure how to put it into words. “He just . . . he really likes cooking. And feeding people. He makes this fantastic roast chicken and potatoes. And he and Bruce like to make Indian food together. It’s—I guess, it’s kinda his thing.”
Bruce looked at him expectantly then waved for him to go on.
“I was just headed that way.”
Tony shook his head and added, “I don’t need you to fight my battles because you’re a big strong Dom and I’m some sweet helpless little sub.”
Tony took a deep breath and tried to calm down.
Chapter dedicated to onemadeofglass for epic cheer-leading!  Thank you, dear!
Tony nodded and gave Steve’s hand a little peck and a squeeze.  The Dom smiled.
“Spinach and pine nut veggie burger? Wow.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, checking the time on his watch. “I’ll take you up on it. I wanna get to my run. I’ve sort of got a new running buddy and I don’t want to miss him.”
Steve let out a long sigh and sank back into it.
(Good God--another ex.)
“Nah, I’m just playing.  ‘As is’ is fine.  And the Malbec again.”
“Steve kept me calm,” Bruce said at last. He swallowed thickly. “He reminded me that you might come back through and need me sane to ‘help with the science’” Bruce sounded gently amused at that, but as his voice went serious as he continued: “or to act as a doctor. Turned out it was a bit of both.”
“Oh, it’s no big deal,” Steve said, shrugging. Tony looked at the pile of letters and wondered how many of these Captain America answered.
“You make enough for two?” Clint asked.
out for food.
(Okay, fine, eavesdropped on. It had been overhearing at first, but around the sixty second mark, let's face it, you're not
“I really think he’d be fine right there,” Steve objected again as Rhodey started trying to pull Tony up off the couch. He overbalanced and stumbled, flopping back down. After a moment’s fumbling, Rhodey got his shoulder under Tony’s arm and started to heft him up.
Tony frowned. Pep should be over the moon! She cared so passionately about all that stuff.
They were quiet for a while as Pepper sipped her tea and absently pet Tony’s hair.
A sharp jolt of pleasure shot through Steve’s body-- he arched off the bed, pulling against the restraints which held him in place.  The headboard creaked and Steve pressed his wrists back into place.  (Be good!  Stay there!)
(FUCK!)
Tony hesitated. “I didn’t,” he admitted, shamefaced. “Steve had to help me see it; but now I do. I’m sorry.”
His jaw dropped open at the sight before him: Pepper was wearing her Wonder Woman armor with nothing over it and pointing an old Stark Industries Glock 17 at his head, her hands perfectly steady.
“Steve’s hardly the ‘mama’ type and Nat’d kill him if he tried it,” Tony answered, tossing a new ball over to the Hulk.
“One coffee and one vodka,” she answered.
expertise to the episode selection process.”
“Well, in that case, before you go,” Steve began awkwardly, with a glance at Tony, “there’s something Iron Man and I—“
The door to Steve’s spare room was open. Inside, there was a large table overflowing with colorful paper and ribbons in reds and golds and greens. A mountain of carefully wrapped boxes stood on Steve’s left and an equally high pile of items waited to his right: art supplies, picture books, toy chemistry sets, building blocks, dolls, scarves and hats and mittens.
Rogers looks up with a smile. “Tony’s done so much to make me feel at home here--not just welcoming us into Avengers’ Tower. He’s introduced me to Star Trek and world cuisine and these horrible noises he insists are music. He’s introduced me to his friends and will always answer my dumb questions, showing me how to use new tech over and over.” The Captain looks at the floor for a few seconds, then adds, “And when I was struggling to adjust, Tony was the first person to tell me that it’s ok for me not to be ok.” The Captain’s Dominant’s notch bobs when he swallows. “I can’t imagine the future without him.”
Natasha showed up silently with her Widow’s Bite one afternoon. She handed it to Tony, then settled in the corner of the workshop to do maintenance on her other weaponry, her motions fluid even with her wrist in a cast. Gun oil was a familiar smell (and not unlike Bruce’s smelly tea, come to think of it); the sound of sharpening knives should probably have felt more unsettling than it did.
Bruce gave Rogers and Tony a shaky wave and followed the ninjas out.  (His eyes were looking a bit green, but he seemed to be weathering their training pretty well.)
(Oh, ok.  Verbatim apparently.)
A moment later Tony was encircled by huge projections: Steve’s spreadsheet, various annotated ebooks, shopping carts at JT’s Storeroom and Mr. S Leather, and of course his own notes.  He yawned.
Rogers leaned the shield up against the sofa, set the box on the heavy wooden coffee table, and, after a moment’s awkwardness, left the duffel on the floor.  Rogers smiled at him again.
Steve shook his head, then answered a little hesitantly, “Just trying to plan a date with Tony.”  He sighed.  “But it’s hard, ‘cause he’s—well, he’s
“Roger, Rogers! Peace out.”
“My favorite,” she said, looking up at him with a pleased smile.  Tony tossed one of the throw pillows on the floor and folded to his knees at her side.
“No.” Cap said it so seriously. “I wouldn’t.” A pause, then he added with a frown, “You really shouldn’t do that though; the grease is blistering hot.”
"Tony, I think it's entirely possible that—"
Tony glanced up from where he sat on the couch, tucked comfortably into Steve's side, and noticed that Natasha did appear to have cleaned herself up a bit and put some makeup on. She smirked a little at Barton and swiped at his head like she was going to smack him, but he ducked out of her reach, and she grabbed her small purse from where she'd set it on the arm of the couch and said, "Don't wait up, boys."
like Tony Stark, OK? I look like what would happen if Tony Stark was born a woman, but I look like Tony Stark." He glanced back down again and frowned. "Shit."
"Hey, check my legs while you're down there. Did I get all the hair? Holy shit, leg shaving is ridiculous, and I will never give any woman any grief about it ever, ever again. And underarms. What the fuck? Why is there even hair there to begin with?"
Bruce sighed like Tony was asking him to commit highway robbery. "Tony, I'm not that kind of doctor. How many times have I told you that?"
He stopped and turned back to him. "Huh?"
! I put in a common floor for them!" he cried. "Is it important, J?"
, but it's how I feel. I feel like…like I'm some goddamned fertility goddess like this. I mean, I have created a brand-new human life that's growing inside of me."
Steve let go of one thigh to shove his fingers into him, mouthing and licking around the clit as he curled his fingers and began to stroke and flex them, stretching him, and Tony arched his back and let out a desperate whimper, clutching hold of the sheets again as though they could ground him or help him or keep him from going mad with want.
"What?"
"Tony, I
Wilson sniffed and folded his arms tight across his chest. "Yeah?" He nodded at Natasha. "I'm sure your girl would love to go with you."
Tony folded his arms, watching Steve in slight amusement. "You're a troll. Has anyone ever told you that?"
He stood there and folded his arms and glared at them, daring them to make him try to reconsider his decision.
She just stared at him, her emerald eyes scanning over his face before recognition dawned therein. "Oh,
And he still had another two months of this —
Steve sighed some. "Tony."
"What's going on?" Steve asked, still looking a little resigned but clearly trying to steer the conversation back on the right track. "The scepter?"
"I didn't say a word," Rhodey said with a laugh.
"Esmeralda, you are meant to bless couples, not burden them with issue they cannot handle," Thor said.
He didn't see it, but he
"Believe me," Tony said and went back over to the table, folding his arms and resting them atop the back of the chair he'd been sitting in, "if I cut your funding, you would know."
"Nah, it's fine," Steve said. "I don't mind telling you. It's just… I think about those things sometimes, and they feel like they're from a dream or from another life. It doesn't feel like it happened to me. In fact—" He set his fork down and sat back. "God, I don't know if I should even admit this to you. I never told this to anyone. But…once, not long after I woke up, I read something about amnesia and different ways it manifests, and I began to wonder if I hadn't made the whole thing up — the whole thing about the war and Project Rebirth and Peggy and Howard and Bucky and Colonel Phillips and the USO and — like maybe I'd seen a movie or read a book before I got whacked in the head, and now I was imagining this whole thing. And then you guys were all trying some sort of immersion therapy — playing into the delusion to try to bring me back to reality or something."
"How weird is it being pregnant?" another woman said.
"For about half-a-second," he replied but didn't elaborate any.
Steve dumped the cooked eggs into a serving bowl and set it on the table, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head as he did so.
Even, evidently, life with his own body.
"Fine," Tony muttered after a moment. "I suppose it would be...hypocritical to encourage you and discourage her."
Steve just shook his head, and Bruce said, "Ideally, you'd do it overnight so you wouldn't have to
"For what?"
"Not gonna turn me into a woman, are you?"
He sighed a little. "I know. I don't know why I snapped."
"Foursome?" Steve murmured and tried to figure out the logistics for that. Seemed like an awful lot of work and not very intimate at that.
"The man!"
this way. Or he didn't think he did.
he was because you love him. Because you don't want him to change because you love him the way he is. You want the world to think Tony Stark is some cold, uncaring bastard that's only in it for himself because to not be might leave you vulnerable, and the thought of being vulnerable terrifies you. Because Howard Stark was a poor excuse for a father that didn't deserve such a brilliant and selfless and caring son as you.
Tony stared at him a moment then turned to glare at Natasha. "What's he sorry for?"
Tony looked up at the— Oh, for the love of… He looked at Steve. "This is all your fault."
Except Sam, maybe. Much as Buck and Sam needled each other on a near-constant basis, Steve had a feeling they deep down actually liked each other, and an immature and irrational part of himself bristled a little at the idea that it wasn't just the dames that liked Bucky better than him. It was his own friends, too.
With Steve watching the traffic, Tony reached out and pressed the button on the dashboard to go back to the other preset, and Steve groaned audibly as the sound of the previous song blared out of the speakers.
with me, kid!" as he tried to get her little black patent leather Mary Janes on her feet. "
It was in Steve's nature to bristle and fight against that accusation — to pull away and look Tony in the eye and make him understand under no uncertain terms that that wasn't in any way true and he was never going to leave Tony because he got too 'old' for him.
Barnes was silent a moment before he said, "Howard didn't give a shit about Steve."
"Please don't wear actual bells," he heard Steve mutter after he'd turned to go and make himself look presentable. He stopped a moment and gave consideration to looking for the elf's hat with the jingle bells on it that Barton had been wearing at last year's Christmas party. Steve didn't want him wearing bells? He'd wear the most obnoxious and jingly hat anyone had ever seen.
"'Cause she's crazy — or she
" Steve said like he couldn't understand the significance of it.
"Well, we'll find out," Steve said as the reporter finally seemed to come back to herself.
"No, Steve!" Tony yelled, spinning around on his heel and glaring at him. He marched right back up to him and jabbed him hard in the sternum with his pointer finger. "You don't get to do this, do you understand? You don't
Tony kept his focus on the road ahead of them. "'Believe me' or 'believe
"I'm sorry," he said.
"I don't think he hates me, either," Steve said in agreement. "I don't think he
Tony stood up, tablet in hand. "I know what you're going to say, so save your breath. I know this isn't ideal, and I know that maybe it's not even my best idea—"
daughter."
for the first time in his life. He'd gotten taller, he'd gotten healthier, and hell, maybe he'd even gotten a little smarter. But what he hadn't become, what he so desperately wanted to become, was
Anthony finally decided it was time to make his appearance. He appreciated the gesture, but it wasn't entirely necessary, he didn't think.
She exhaled a breath. "It's
"What? What, Doc? Give it to me straight."
"I have projects to finish, and I want to make sure they're all taken care of. Pepper, Rhodey, the Avengers…Steve. I need to make sure they're all taken care of. I don't need the board swooping in and taking control over everything. They'll cut the team right off, and now that SHIELD-slash-Hydra is at the bottom of the Potomac, I'm the only one funding them. There's still a lot of rats out there, and we know Loki's scepter got lost in the shuffle along with a lot of other things that should have been under better lock and key. Steve won't rest until all that stuff's back in the right hands."
He wasn't sure he came — at that time, he wasn't really sure what an orgasm should feel like in that kind of body — but he knew Steve had. He could feel the warm release flood into him afterward, and, funnily enough, it was almost as though
Which, technically, wasn't a lie.
Steve groaned and rolled his eyes. "I really wish you'd forget about that party."
familiar with that expression. Oh, but the Man of Iron wishes to be changed back, and contrary to popular belief — I think that's another one of your expressions — you are not the only pair of bondmates I have to deal with. Again, I am not your cosmic personal assistant, so—" she motioned at Tony, "—if you would be so kind as to dispose yourself of your infant, we can proceed."
get some pointers on how to do it from this guy right here."
"Look, I don't have anything against masturbating, clearly, but—"
Rhodey grimaced a little and put his hands up. "Yeah, but I really don't need you two getting your everlasting happiness all over me." He paused in thought a moment and added, "OK, that sounded pretty bad—"
"No?" Tony asked and looked at the tag on the box. "For Olivia," Tony said and looked down at Steve, who nodded and watched as Tony tore into the paper and tossed it aimlessly on the floor.
"Give them time. Barton's doing the flying. Probably forgot to make the left turn at Albuquerque," he said, cradling Olivia close and watching as she slumbered so peaceably in his arms, rain from the late summer storm whipping against the window with addled fury.
He tweaked a smile, and in the same casual and flat tone he'd once told the world he was Iron Man, he said, "I am Tony Stark."
listen to you."
around here, right? He didn't have any dolls for her to play with, and he wasn't sure he had anything for her to color with. The Cap might have — he was sure the Cap had some art supplies — and even though this was his future or alternate-universe daughter, purportedly, he didn't think it was a good idea to go and purge his art supplies for the entertainment of a child. The Cap had had such a hard time allowing himself such a frivolous purchase that Tony, as it turned out, had had to make the transaction for him in the end.
"A few bottles," Tony said with a shrug. "But I rather have that stuff in reserve just in case the whole formula thing doesn't work out."
He couldn't honestly say how long he spent down in his lab. No one came to bother him, and he didn't inquire as to the whereabouts of anyone else in the Tower. Could have been six hours; could have been six days for all he knew. He resolved not to think about his asshole husband and the murderer he called a best friend, but he couldn't
"We didn't have a
"—and your slightly advanced age—"
Steve just held his gaze a moment longer before he nodded like he understood what Tony was saying and went back to cleaning up the mess the others had left behind.
"It wasn't locked, it was the middle of the day, and wasn't that around the time of that whole thing with the Mandarin?"
"I can't tell you why it's a long story, but you with me is, I like to think, because we fell in love. As corny as that sounds. 'course, with the way you're acting, now I'm left wondering if you and Howard didn't have something going on together, and boy, does that open up all sorts of weird Greek tragedy shit. I mean, he did spend pretty much the entirety of the rest of his life looking for you…"
Steve shot him an amused, sidelong smile. "We agreed we wanted a boy. That doesn't mean we're getting one."
"But it's my fault—"
"So…what you're saying is she'd hate me?"
before he turned his attention back to Wilson. "You could just
He glanced at the clock on the microwave and saw it was nearly eight o'clock, and he figured he wasn't getting back to sleep any time soon, so he grabbed a bag of coffee beans from the cabinet, ground up enough for a pot, and then set the coffeemaker to brew, Olivia watching him the entire time.
On a far wall, removed from the presumed 'showpieces' of the event, there were a handful of what looked like personal photos the photographer had taken — well, if she was even the one taking them and this wasn't some overblown stunt by some cynical firm. He moved over to them, gazing upon the black and white matte prints that indicated more domestic or personal scenes.
"You mean he's perfectly A-OK leaving you and your sister alone with those screwballs?"
Steve chuckled a little and went back to his story.
He snatched the towels away from Tony, and he made a pathetic attempt at trying to pat himself dry while Tony worked at mopping up the chocolate that had gone on the couch. Tony made a contemplative noise and said, "Never liked this one, anyway. Just throw it out and get a new one."
Not that he was that much of a fan of the shopping (torture; six stores, twenty-five dresses, and only two that looked in any way remotely decent: a proverbial little black dress and a deep burgundy halter-top number that hugged every curve and played up his cleavage; Natasha insisted on that one), but it was the other stuff that was fun. It was the going for lunch and the just general getting to hang out with Natasha not as superheroes but as friends with an unlimited spending account and a gorgeous city to take advantage of. They strolled the streets, unencumbered by the usual bullshit that would follow Tony Stark because of his fame and rather familiar face. They talked about their likes, they talked about their pasts (well, a
"Yo, where you going?" Sam asked and watched as Bucky left the desk.
"You told me to be as factual with you as possible, so here it is: It's Christmas Day 2015. We're at our home-away-from-home upstate. Why? Because you're a sap, and I'm a sucker. This," he motioned to the toddler in his arms, "is Olivia. Our daughter. She's sixteen months old and too stubborn for her own good. She gets that from you— Could you please stop looking at me like you're going through all fifty ways you know to snap my neck in two steps or less? Trust me,
Thor happily went about making his sandwich, but the others sitting at the island just picked their sorry heads up to look at each other before shrugging and murmuring a collective, "Yeah."
"Hey, yeah, you takin' breakfast orders?" Wilson called out to Barnes, who glared back at him. "'Cause I'll take two eggs over-easy with a side of bacon and some of those hash browns you're fryin' up."
Tony thought about this for a moment. "Yeah," he finally said. "I mean, if I'd absolutely had to, I would have figured something out. Plus, I mean, JARVIS would have been there to feed me information, so it's not like I would have been
No, this is an outrage. I put in a communal floor for you people, and no one uses it. The only time it gets used is when we have parties, and we haven't had one of those since New Year's."
At first, he thought Tony was joking.
"Hey!" Steve said quickly, sharp and commanding. "She'll get used to it. You didn't have to stay that way just so she had a meal."
"Language, Papa," Olivia said with a mouthful of food.
"Your own or—"
"Are you kidding me?" Barnes asked and sat himself down on the coffee table, facing Tony. He glanced beside him at the broken TV remote, and he pointed at it and said, "Steve did that, I take it?"
"I was thinking. With that charity ball coming up, and I know you want to just get in and get out, but you know how those things go. Yeah, you wine and dine and you socialize and glad-hand — sorry about that — but there's usually dancing involved at these things, and that can be a nightmare if you don't know what you're doing, and I have it from a reliable source that you don't know what you're doing. So, how 'bout it?"
"Just until, like, tomorrow or something, and—"
Tony wasn't even fazed by it.
He shook his head and moved away from that panel. Bruce was still talking to Steve about something, and there were other small groups gathered around other panels that he didn't want to bother at the moment, so he glanced around and looked for something else to kill his time.
"Flirting?"
"Fine," he muttered, though he was almost relieved at the fact that someone was
. Which…was kind of insulting to people that had fled the Dust Bowl, and yeah, maybe not his most kindest or most timely insult, but whatever, hormones raging, wrong body, cut him some slack.
Everyone's gaze shifted from Tony to Steve at that. Tony could only imagine the face Steve was making at them.
Steve's eyes hardened into something fierce and fuming. "Don't say that. Don't ever say that about yourself. Maybe you were a spoiled, trust fund brat, but you were
Bucky just raised an eyebrow. "You

"They
"No, man, just, no. Look, I get that you two have some sort of weird bond going on and everything, and I get that you don't want to be separated from each other or whatever, but dude, you really think it's safe?"
"You feel better?"
"What was it about?" Steve asked tersely, and Tony knew he was trying very hard to control his temper.
Tony thought about the ache plaguing him in the particular area that had just been split wide open and said, "You mean it's going to get
it takes longer." He looked up once again. "Days, Bruce! It says it could take
