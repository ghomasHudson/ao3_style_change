“What am I gonna do?” He says sliding back into the chair. “Your father, he’s - well I hate to be the one to tell you this, but he’s a pain. He always manages to get under my skin like no one else. It amazes me how one person can be so arrogant! Sometimes he makes me so angry and… I don’t know… I still love your father. More than I’d care to admit. But that doesn’t really matter much anymore. He’s doing much better now. I can see that. Maybe it was me. Maybe I was the one holding him back. You’re proof of that. If we’d worked out, you never would have been born,” Steve confesses. It’s like a weight has been lifted off his chest. “And speaking of, where’s your mother? Who is she? Why wouldn’t she be here with you? I guess with Tony you can never be too sure. Honestly, I’m surprised there are only two of you. With the way your father carried on, I would have thought there’d be more Starks running around.”
“Uh, yeah,” Tony says, wiping away tears Steve hadn’t noticed before. Everything inside him is screaming for him to reach out and brush away the tears himself.
“C’era una volta un re e una regina che ogni giorno dicevano: ‘Ah, se avessimo un bambino!’ Ma il bambino non veniva mai. Un giorno, mentre la regina faceva il bagno, ecco che un gambero salto fuori dall’acqua e le disse: ‘Il tuo desiderio sarà esaudito: darai alla luce una bambina.”
Steve sits down on the edge of Maria’s bed and pulls out a small grey bunny from inside his jacket. He places it next to her and then takes one of her tiny hands in his. Tony’s simultaneously filled with anger and sadness. The anger wins out.
Steve has to laugh at that. Peter picks her back up and gives her a wet, smacking kiss on the cheek, that has her laughing more. “Alright, now that we’ve got all that straightened out, let’s see if the Cap is around somewhere.”
Steve’s taken to walking around the house in the dark. It’s become impossible for him to get more than a few hours of sleep. When he does manage a few moments of sleep he has nightmares about Maria. Night after night he lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. It’s difficult for him to feel comfortable in the room Tony’s given him. Once the house had been his home. Now he wanders around aimlessly, haunted by memories. He’s haunted by visions of the past and tormented by the thought of what could have been. Of the future he threw away.
“Where are you… okay, never mind I see what you’re talking about,” Tony says as he points to different highlighted areas on the screen. “Am I crazy or are these results saying that her body is attacking itself?”
No matter what he fucking did everything always led back to Steve. Since Steve’s return, Tony’s mood has exponentially soured. He knew having Steve back in his home would be difficult, but what he didn’t anticipate was the extent. Having Steve near again is like being dunked and pulled from a river of ice. The first night, the night of the party, the very sight of Steve makes Tony weak and that weakness has been gaining power since. The desire hasn’t faded, but now it’s mixed with disappointment, fear, and such fiery hatred that it actually scares him.
Steve sits down in the seat next to him. “I could help. You don't have to do this alone, Tony. I’m here, use me for whatever you need.” Steve reaches over and takes Tony’s hand in his.
Its a punch to the gut. Steve feels like all the air has been sucked out of him along with everything else inside him. He looks between Maria and Tony. Maria reaches out and takes his hand in hers.
“If we take a closer look we can see the serum attaches itself to different areas and acts as reinforcements. Now when we look at Maria’s scans, it is clear she has inherited the serum in the chromosomes she received from Steve. They should be acting in the same way as we saw in Steve’s scans. However, when you look here, it’s obvious there is a compatibility issue.”
Friday informs them that the ambulance has arrived and Tony takes Maria from Steve’s arms. “Tony, I swear, I’m so sorry-”
He couldn’t, he wouldn’t rely on anyone, at least not when it came to his family. He kisses Maria’s forehead and then Alana’s before he reluctantly leaves his entire world behind. He watches from the doorway as Alana pulls out a book and begins reading to Maria.
Steve takes her down to the pond. He spends most of the time chasing after her and rolling around in the grass. It goes on this way. In the afternoons, Steve spends his time running around and playing with Maria. They pick flowers and chase bees. But there’s always a cloud hanging overhead. Steve knows better than to tempt fate and every part of him knows that if Tony knew, he’d lose his mind and beat Steve to a pulp. But each day he spends with Maria the harder it becomes to stay away from her. So shamefully, Steve brings Maria back to the house before Tony gets home. Her days are spent with Steve and her nights are spent in the loving arms of her father.
“You can barely stand Tony, I know you haven’t eaten. I need you to take care of yourself. We need you. I’ll stay. I won’t leave her side I promise.”
“Ha!” Tony laughs bitterly. “The only person who destroyed us is you. YOU! You put all of this in motion. It would be so easy for you to just lay the blame on someone else, but you ruined this. We had our problems, but you! You put the nail in the coffin. And yeah maybe someone is working against you and deleted the message. But none of that matters because nothing will change what you did to me. And if you’re serious and you want to be a part of Maria’s life. If you truly want to be a father to her than prove it.”
There were times he’d envied Tony's ability to disappear into a bottle. Why should he not be allowed an escape from his problems like everyone else? He’d tried, many times in his lowest moments, but the serum made it impossible.
“Tony, I’m begging you. Please believe me.” Steve pleads as he grabs Tony. “Look into my eyes. You know me! I know you do! In your heart you know. Why would I lie to you?”
In an instant every little thing Tony has said to him comes flooding back into his mind. He thinks about the conversations in the hospital. Tony believes that he doesn’t have a right to be a part of her life. Tony is trying to keep her from Steve. Tony made everyone believe that Steve doesn’t want her!
“That’s not true. I’m not sad and I know that your Papa isn’t either. Why would he be sad when he has you and Alana and Peter.”
“I’m probably not the best person to ask questions. Let go find the princess and see if she can’t explain all this to you and let's see if we can get you some rooms,” Steve says.
. There’s a bit of sadness lacing those words and Steve makes a mental note to talk about it with her later. Tony makes time for everyone but him. Steve, he avoids like the plague and it hurts him. They used to share everything. They used to be partners and now Tony can’t stand the sight of him. But even so, Steve still wants to be near Tony, he still loves Tony. So what is he supposed to do? Steve gets tired of it and decides to forces the situation. Tony has a very regimented routine, which surprises Steve at first until he realizes that it all revolves around Maria. He watches and he waits. He waits until he knows Tony will be alone and ambushes him. It’s early morning when Tony stops in Maria’s room to check on her before he heads off for his morning workout before she’s up. He heads down to the kitchen with Steve behind.
Everything comes pouring out of him like he’s at confession. He lets out a sigh and rubs his face. “What are you doing Rogers? Venting to a child? Good work,” he tells himself aloud. “Geez, I’m pathetic.”
Steve can’t help but notice a trace of hostility in her voice and what’s stranger is that it seems to be directed at both of them. Tony gets up and grabs her by the shoulders.
“They are some of the best diagnosticians in the world. I’m certainly paying them enough. Why? Do you think I made a mistake?” Tony asks inquisitively.
One morning as he’s about to head out for a run he overhears Maria telling Peter that she wants to play with Steve.
There’s no avoiding it. No matter how much she likes Steve, he’ll never be as good as Tony, never as good as her father. “Come, let’s go find him.”
“Take the sample. See if it helps. If you need more or anything else we’ll figure the rest out later,” Steve tells the doctor firmly.
The doctor’s eyes are as wide as possible. “An isolated sample? What’s been done to it? Who’s sample is it?”
He’s gone over everything that happened with them a thousand times. He keeps telling himself that if he could only find the moment where it all went to hell then maybe somehow he could fix all of it. He’s spent many nights going over every detail with Sam, poor Sam. But it always comes down to the same thing, at some point, the half-truths and lies became more important than being honest with each other. No matter how he looks at it Steve stands behind his decision to oppose the Accords. That’s one thing he can’t change, but that isn’t their problem, not really. He replays conversations he’s had with Tony over and over again. In each of them, he tells Tony the truth about Bucky, about his parents. Tony’s angry at first, but he always comes around. If only Steve had actually lived out one of those moments.
Tony’s left alone, with their daughter, to figure out how to get her out of the hospital. Their daughter.  It’s strange to think of Maria as theirs. Tony has had sole claim to her for so long he never thought it was possible to ever give Steve a share, but it feels right. She is theirs and if the world is going to find out, well they’re going be sure as hell that everyone knows exactly what’s waiting for them if anyone tries to hurt her.
“Good morning, my Lady Maria, Warrior Goddess of New York,” his voice cracks as he recites the title he’d given her during one of their adventures.
Here he is living his worst nightmare. He takes Maria’s tiny fragile hand in his and kisses it and the tears begin. Up until he saw her little body lying limp in Steve’s arms, Tony thought he’d already experienced the worst moment of his life. But boy had he been wrong. He can’t help but feel as though Maria is being punished for all of his sins.
“Don’t you dare lie to me Steven Rogers. I don't need anymore of your bullshit.” Tony walks over to Steve and he wraps his arms around Tony’s waist. Steve sobs into Tony’s stomach.
Coming back is nothing like what Steve thought it would be. Although, he isn’t all that sure what he was expecting. When he first left he kept tabs on all of them, on Tony. But after a while, it became too difficult. There really wasn’t anything for him to keep tabs on, it was as if Tony dropped off the face of the Earth. There wasn’t anything until there was. Until it was on the cover of every tabloid, newspaper, and magazine. Tony had a baby. Tony moved on, Tony found someone else. Tony started a family… without him. For weeks he tortured himself, reading every pointless story which provided him with nothing but vague details and more heartache until Nat intervened.
“Come on. You know how I feel about this whole situation, but nothing’s changed so why are we plotting murder now?”
. Tony, Rhodey, and Sam work together on some new tech. Tony and Nat disappear for hours in the wood behind the house and come back all smiles. When they make their way in he hears Nat telling Tony that she
“Papa wants to be here too, but Papa is very busy right now. Is it okay if I stay with you instead?” Steve continues.
Tony has a look on his face that Steve can’t quite read. Steve starts to feel like he’s rapidly losing control of the situation again. He starts to ramble. “All I'm saying is it’s good to see you happ-”
The music picks up and Wanda pulls him onto the dance floor, telling him he has to loosen up at some point. Steve watches as Tony pulls Alana onto the floor. They glide effortlessly in-between the other people. Tony’s easy smile pulls at his heart. After, Tony’s the only thing he can focus on. He watches as Tony plays the perfect host, moving from person to person, making jokes, laughing, and smiling.
“No, it is necessary for her body to accept your bone marrow. We have to lower her immune system so her body won’t reject it.”
Tony’s shoulders slump back down at the sound of his daughter’s name on Steve’s lips and he goes over to the sofa and collapses on to it. It’s clear he’s holding on by a thread. Steve hates seeing Tony this way and not being able to comfort him. All he wants to do is hold Tony.
Tony breezes by him and disappears out the door. Steve feels defeated as he makes his way back to his room.
Everyone follows Tony to the main entrance and watch as he and Alana get into the ambulance with Maria.
That shakes Tony to his core. The way the doctor looks at Steve isn't right. They know. Somehow they know Steve is Maria’s other parent and even if they did before their little lip lock definitely completed the puzzle. Steve was right. They have to get her out of here as quickly as possible. Steve comes to stand behind Tony, putting his hand on his shoulder.
“Nice try, kid. Get your work done. And just to keep you honest, I’m going to make sure that Friday doesn’t let you in until she checks your homework.”
Even with Tony’s reassurance Steve still has a sinking feeling in his stomach. All this and there’s still a chance it might not work? He wouldn’t care about the risks if it were just him, but the stakes are too high for Maria.
“It is nice to see you again Mr. Stark.” He shakes Tony hand. “Although, I wish it was under different circumstances.”
“I called you! I CALLED YOU ON THAT PIECE OF SHIT EXCUSE FOR AN APOLOGY, IF THAT’S EVEN WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE!” Tony shouts. It would be loud if Steve could hear over the sound of blood rushing throw his vaines.
“You think you can just come here and take whatever you want? That you can take advantage of people in their grief?  I don’t care what you do to me. But if you- ever- come -after -Maria -again - I - will - kill- every- last- one -of - you, and I’ll do it with a smile on my face.” Steve is stone cold and reserved. He doesn’t shout. He’s never needed to. A calm super soldier has always inspired much more fear.
“No, I should stay. They’re going to give her another dose soon,” Tony answers. Steve puts both his hands on Tony’s shoulders and runs them slowly midway down his triceps. The gesture is laced with uneasy familiarity. He can feel Alana and Peter’s eyes boring holes into his back. He ignores it and leans to whisper.
The throb radiates from his hip down to his toes. But it’s nothing compared to the warmth that spreads through him at Tony’s words. His foolish heart overrides his brain and he preens at the encouragement.
“What the hell’s going on?!” Peter asks, looking disheveled and frightened. He’s out of breath and shaking.
“I’M HER FATHER. I’M THE ONLY ONE WHO’S BEEN AT HER SIDE, ME!” Tony let’s out a manic laugh before continuing. “And that’s probably why she’s suffering.”
Tony watches as Steve walks over to Maria’s bed and sits down next to her. His gut reaction is to tell Steve to get away from her, but he also can’t help but feel relieved Steve is finally there, that he doesn’t have to shoulder all of it on his own anymore.
Tony arrives at the hospital, and does his best to avoid the swarms of paparazzi in the parking lot vying for a picture of him, distraught and utterly useless father. He doesn’t even turn the car off. He jumps out, tossing the keys to the security guard out front and makes a dash for the front doors. He walks up to the elevators ignoring the flashing of what feels like hundreds of cameras and heads up to the second floor.
Instead, the four of them stand in front of Maria’s bed, watching the constant drip, drip, drip of the fluids and the beeping of the monitors showing Maria’s vitals. It could have been minutes or hours Steve couldn’t tell, but the others are beginning to fade. Tony looks up at him as he nods towards Peter who’s slumped against his arm. Steve removes himself from the group and pulls Peter away from Tony. He looks up confused for a second before he closes his eyes again and lets himself be led away.
There's a lot of medical stuff in this chapter and if you didn't guess from "medical stuff" I am not a doctor! Most of this is probably wrong, but I did a bit of research and then tried to figure ways Wakanda would have perfected the methods! Hope you enjoy!
“Right now the only thing you should be worried about is telling us whether or not the sample is of any use at all. You’re being paid a whole lot of money for results and so far you’ve given us nothing. Maria is still in that bed and your pockets are lined with money. See the problem?”
Steve perks up at that. He’s more than happy to do whatever he can to help. He walks back over to the table where Maria lays. Shuri stands next to her, waiting.
“The girls make it easy. They’re wonderful,” he waves his hands around, in a manner that highlights the self-deprecating aspect of his personality.
Tony take the empty glass in his hand and throws it at the wall. The two of them watch it shatters into pieces. Steve flinches and prepares himself to be yelled at, but instead Tony softened a bit. Steve likes to think he used to have a pretty good handle on Tony’s moods, but right now he can’t figure him out at all.
“I called you when I knew,” Tony shouts through a fresh batch of tears. “I called you and you did nothing. You made it very clear what mattered to you.”
The silence of the floor is odd and off-putting. Shouldn’t a children’s ward be load and chaotic? It’s so quiet they can hear the ding! elevator, followed by hurried footsteps and a steady click-click, click-click coming towards them.
They don’t move, even as the lab floods with people coming in the check Maria’s progress. Someone shouts Shuri’s name and she comes running. She says something and then there’s cheering, but none of it means a thing. Steve’s whole world has narrow to the man in his arms. At some point, Peter and Alana come in and wrap their arms around Steve and Tony. The four of them huddle together until Shuri comes over to them.
Tony’s eyes are big and glassy, he’s biting the inside of his cheek. Steve knows he wants to say something, but he’s holding back. He opens and shuts his mouth and shakes his head. “Okay, fine, but you’ll come get me if anything changes?”
When they get to the hospital, they all pour out of the van as fast as they can manage. Steve can’t help but wonder what kind of mess they look like. It isn’t until that moment that he realizes they’re all in pajamas and other various types of home clothing and yet when they all walk in together pajama-clad and all the look on the receptionist’s face is priceless. It’s the look of awe mixed with a bit of fear that used to bring Steve a sense of pride and joy. Once they had been formidable. Now they’re broken.
“She was… beautiful and funny and smart. She had the patience of a saint. She had to, dealing with me and Howard. She was amazing and I took her for granted.”
“Contributing fifty percent of her DNA doesn’t make you a father! It makes you a sperm donor!” Tony screams.
“God, I still can’t believe this is your life we’re talking about. You’re a father. You, Anthony Edward Stark, are a father. You have not only one, but two amazing daughters. You always wanted a family and now you have one. You’ve been blessed. Don’t ever forget that. Maria’s life wasn’t random or meaningless.”
Even as he says, everyone agrees with Alana’s assessment. For just a moment, Steve tries to envision what would become of Tony if he lost his daughter and it’s too much to bear. It’s plain to see that Tony had poured his entire world into being a father. Losing Maria would destroy him.
“Steve, we have to get you out of here too. If they’re interested in her, it’s because of you. They want a DNA sample, it’s the serum they’re after,” Tony says plainly.
“If anything happens to her. If I even think someone’s too close to her I’m gonna come find you,” Steve says as he snaps a picture of them.
“Let’s just say that I wish Alana hadn't found someone so much like me. She could do better.” It’s clear Tony’s keeping information to himself and he’s happy Steve doesn’t press for more.
“We need that sample,” Tony states plainly. He seems defeated. “We’ll do it here and then bring it to the doctors to run their tests. Hopefully, they’ll find something in your half to help her.”
“HA!” Tony grunts out. “I gotta go Rhodes, great talk, but you know MY daughters are waiting for me.”
“No!” She says with her little arms crossed in front of her body. He looks over at the three adults, they all look extremely frustrated.
She looks over at Tony. She’s a bit confused, but she understands the stakes. “Fine, what happened?” she asks again.
They’re locked in a death stare. Steve’s a bit worried they might kill each other. As much as he would like to stay and figure out what the hell’s going on, he listens to Tony and heads outside.
At that, Peter picks his head up and pulls Maria into his arms. She doubles over in laughter as he tickles her. “That’s right, you love me! That’s ‘cause I’m the best big brother in the whole world!”
“Her brain is on fire. The seizure was brought on by the fever and the fever is being caused by an infection. Where the infection originated from no one knows. They’re running all these tests trying to figure out how and why this happened. They had to put her in a coma.” By the time Alana gets to the end her words are coming out between sobs.
“I should have been there Tony. There’s nothing I can do to change the past, but I swear things are going to be different from now on,” Steve tells him as he moves to kneel in front of Tony.
“She’s doing great,” Steve says staring at her. Maria turns to him and gives him a smile full of strawberries. Their eyes connect and Maria’s almost unreal piercing blue eyes send a flutter through Steve’s heart. She doesn’t break the connection, in fact, she stares harder at him. It becomes uncomfortable when he feels Tony’s intense gaze on him, along with everyone else.
“NO TIME BROTHER!” Shuri shouts clearing a path in front of her. “GET HER TO MY LAB RIGHT AWAY! MOVE! MOVE!” she continues into the building in front of her.
“Ti voglio bene,” Tony tells her. He tries his best to pour everything he’s thinking and feeling into the hug. “I hope you know how much.”
At some point, they both had fallen asleep. It’s a shock when they are woken up by Okoye, who turns beads on her wrist and showing them something. It takes a minute for Steve to fully understand what is happening. She’s showing them a projection of Alana and Peter, of course.
They are silent the whole way. He feels like he’s covered in thousands of ants. The second they reach Shuri’s lab Tony relaxes a bit. He’s in his element. He rushes over to Shuri’s side and they start hovering over tiny screens filled with information. Tony is vigorously nodding at what she’s telling him. He has a crazed look in his eyes that Steve knows very well. It’s classic self-destructive determination. Classic Tony. Steve attempts to follow their conversation, but he only understands about every other word. He feels completely useless. All he can do is sit on the sidelines while Tony and a teenaged princess save their daughter. He turns away and walks over to the wall of windows. He lets out a sigh and rests an arm against the window. Tony was right all he is a blunt instrument that serves one purpose.
When he finally gets home, he heads straight for the master suite and pours himself a drink. He changes into his sweat pants and a tank. Try as he might pretend to the contrary, despite everything Steve’s done to him, how much he’s hurt him, a part of Tony still loves Steve. Part of Tony misses him so much it’s hard to breathe. He can’t keep himself from wondering what their lives would be like if Steve hadn’t thrown everything away. If Steve had loved Tony enough. He wonders what Maria’s life would be like.
It’s a frenzy of questions. Neither are happy at being left behind and they both do an excellent job at telling them off. There’s a lot of
Steve does his best to swallow the lump in his throat and answer. “I… We… She was crying for you so I was bringing her to you and I felt her tense up in my arms. I’m so sorry Tony. I don’t know what I could have done to set it off. She was fine, well warm, but awake one second and out the next. I’m so sorry.”
Three years ago Steve would have told Tony to stop drinking and quit acting like a spoiled brat. Now he just takes it. What else could he do? “I should go, I’m sorry.”
As soon as Steve gets Alana and Peter settled he rushes back to Maria. He has a sinking feeling as he thinks about what he’d told Tony earlier. He’d promised he wouldn’t leave her side, but the other two needed him. He was feeling a bit stretched thin. He could tell by the look on his face that Peter would have preferred if Steve had stayed with him to talk more, but he couldn’t.
“But that’s the thing, you don’t know. I have never felt this way my entire life. I love them so much it scares the shit out of me. I love them so much sometimes I think it might kill me. You can’t imagine how that feels. Maria is MY miracle,” Tony’s starting to become hysterical. “I felt her growing inside me. I’m supposed to be her protector, but right now I’m useless. My baby could die and I can’t stop it.”
“Fine, but for now, can we call a truce. Maria is the only thing that matters. Princess Shuri is going to do a bone marrow transplant in a few days. She thinks that it may help reverse the damage that has been caused by the virus.”
“I don't want to do this Tony. I don’t want to fight. I’m exhausted. My head feels like it’s going to explode. I have no idea what to do. I need you. We need each other. So tell me what to do and I’ll do it. Our daughter is dying. Everything else isn’t important. I can’t lose her, not like this, not before I even know her. All I want is a chance Tony. I know I messed up. I’m going to make up for it. I promise. But for now tell me, how do I help our little girl?”
Tony thinks he should have said something to Steve before. Steve’s clearly not happy with what he’s being told, but Tony truly doesn’t care.
“Do you really think I would ignore you? I gave you that phone because I was too much of a coward to admit that I was wrong and that I missed you,” Steve pleads. “I was scared that you’d tell me to get lost. I couldn't handle that. All I’ve wanted is you Tony. Do you really think that I could that? Ignore you? Let alone all of this, Maria?”
Tony isn’t oblivious, he knows Steve is avoiding answering him, but he says nothing and Steve is grateful he doesn’t push. He does, however, give Steve a side-eye that says he hasn’t let it go.
“You are being so selfish! He could help her! He could save her! Your fear is going to cost you a daughter! Why don’t you see that? I cannot, I will not lose my sister. If you don’t speak to him then I will!” Steve’s never heard such anger in her voice.
They lay and watch as Maria falls asleep between them. They move so their heads rest above hers. They stare at each other.
“Don't worry about me, Tony. They can’t hurt me and I’m not leaving until I pay them back for putting our daughter in jeopardy.”
“Are you implying that she needs my approval of the people she chooses to spend time with? Or are you implying that I don’t know who my daughter spends time with? Because he is a good person, flawed like any of us, but a good person and a good lawyer. He’s been helping pro-bono at the foundation.”
“They know I’m her father. It isn’t safe here anymore. Who know’s what they want her for. What they've already done to her. You have to get her out of here,” Steve whispers.
“Perfect, so that leaves all day tomorrow to… train with Beetle-Man over here. Today you’ll finish your work.”
Steve blanches. Tony looks like death. Everything rests on this. Steve reaches out and takes Tony’s hand in his. He stands and throws caution to the wind, pulling Tony to him. He’s relieved when he feels the other man melt against him. Tony wraps his arms around.
"I said, where are you going?" her eyes are red and puffy. She’s been crying. He wants to reach out and comfort her, but he isn't ready.
“Peter, come sit down. Alana will come to get us,” the man he came with, Matt, tells him in an even and sure voice.
“Don’t Alana me! It isn’t going to work this time! Stop behaving like a child. Why are you set on taking away her chance to have a whole family? You know more than anyone how much it hurts.”
“ I know, but it doesn’t matter anymore. It’s been more than three years. There’s nothing left to do.”
“Then you need to be a big girl and eat some crackers and take your medicine,” he says as Nat hands him some crackers.
“Hey, come on now,” he starts off slowly but is completely ignored. “HEY!” He shouts next. “You have to stop yelling, okay! We - Tony, is still your father so watch the tone. You’re being loud, rude, and disrespectful. We don’t actually have to tell you anything.”
He didn’t realize that children woke up so early. Every morning breakfast is a big to-do. The first morning after the party Tony apologizes to all of them as they shuffle their way to the dining room.
“I have to go and talk to Maria’s doctors, but stay as long as you’d like. I know Maria would love it,” she tells Steve.
“Well, I’m awake now. What were we talking about before I fell asleep?” Tony asks in an attempt to avoid the awkward tension that lingers between them.
Steve is waiting for Tony at the door, holding it open for him. They make their way down the familiar path to Maria’s room. The air is thick around them and everyone keeps their distance. They walk into her room as one of the nurses tends to Maria’s tiny failing body. She looks like she’s hanging on by the last thread. Her beautiful raven hair has lost some of its luster and her once warm colored skin has a grey tint to it. It’s heartbreaking. It takes everything Tony has not to break down again. They’re falling back into their parts too quickly. Steve senses Tony’s distress and takes over.
The whole thing makes Steve feel flushed and ill and has his chest feeling tight. He feels an overwhelming sense of guilt that such a sweet moment makes him confused, sad, and angry. He thinks back to what Tony was like before they had ended and compares it to the person he sees in front of him now. This Tony is genuinely happy, something Steve can’t remember seeing in a very long time. He knows he should be happy for Tony, but he can’t. He hurts too much to do that. He certainly knows he shouldn’t feel anything but positivity and kindness towards Maria, but all he can muster is a bit of fondness mixed with curiosity, discomfort, and a bit of resentment. He shouldn’t, she’s just a baby. She didn’t do anything wrong, but it doesn’t change how he feels. For him, the little blue-eyed beauty is all of his regrets and failed dreams made real.
“Tony, it doesn’t matter if you won’t admit it to yourself. It doesn’t make it any less true. It doesn’t make it hurt any less.”
“Tony?” It’s Steve’s turn to be confused again. He has so many questions. Just like when he finally gets some real information out of Tony, Alana walks in.
“It didn’t feel right to me,” Steve answers as he slides down the in the chair. “No one knows about Maria? About us?”
“You’ve had to do that because you left me out of it. I could have - I should be there next to you. If you really wanted me to be in either of your lives you would have tired harder Tony, and you know that”.
They pull up to the hospital and Steve jumps out before the car even stops. Tony entertains the thought that Steve might be right on some level, but there’s no way in hell he’ll ever admit it, especially not to Steve.
“No, it’s okay. I’m fine,” Tony tries to lie, but a yawn betrays him. She smiles down at him as she runs her fingers through his hair.
Steve freezes in his tracks, it’s like trying to move a brick wall without the suit. Before Tony can say anything else Steve turns around and has him pressed against the door, capturing him in a deep kiss.
The first time Tony turns on the security channels to check up on Maria and sees her with Steve, it takes all his strength not to put the suit on in the middle of the meeting and go rip her out of his arms. The only thing that stops him, other than the death grip Rhodey has on him, is the look of joy on Maria’s face. Every day he watches as Maria asks the other to go to Steve. He watches how she clings to Steve. Each time it happens, the metaphorical hole in his heart gets deeper. His mind races at the sight of them. He watches as each day Steve plays with her and how he always brings Maria back to the others before Tony gets home. He knows he’s doing something wrong.
Tony turns, from his place in front of the window, to give him a look of shame and anger at the intrusion. Steve proceeds into the room anyway. Tony turns back to face the window. His audible sobs replaced with silent streams of tears running down his face. The closer Steve gets to him the more obvious it become that Tony has been crying for a good long time. Steve does his best to not let it affect his decision. He came for answers and he’s going to get them. There’s no other choice.
The line is quiet for a minute before Rhodey answers. “I’m sorry I can’t be there, but one of has to be here to hold back the vultures. What going on there? How’s Maria?”
I apologize for how short this chapter is. Life has been crazy! I took a new position at work and I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to manage my life. haha! I'm not sure how often I will get to post, but I am going to try my best not to fall too far behind!
Tony’s no fool and neither is Steve. There’s something off with the way the doctor is speaking to Tony. There’s something about the way he looks over and holds the vile that puts Steve in full alert. He straightens up and widens his stance, making himself look as big as he can.
“But you don’t really want to go,” she adds. She pulls the door closed and links her arm through his. “It would be a shame not to, especially when you’re wearing the hell out of that tux.”
“Then lets not. I know this has all been crazy, and we haven’t handled it in the best way, but please don’t take it out on Tony. He’s been through enough and he doesn’t need anything other than your support. So if you have to be mad at someone, let it be me. Okay?”
Shuri attempts to comfort them with a smile. “I promise we will save her. Your daughter will be fine,” she says looking at both of them. “I’ll leave you.”
“Good morning, Mr. Stark. If you’re looking for Alana she just left to go talk to the doctors you had come in.” That catches Tony’s attention, finally some good news, hopefully. He turns to her and reads her name tag.
“I know,” Tony says confidently. It’s been so long since he heard such surety in Tony’s voice that Steve turns to him in a bit of shock.
“Papa is going to stay with her,” she says to Rhodey. He reaches out and takes one of her hands in his. “If anything happens…. Dio, if anything happens to her… I don’t think Papa will survive it.”
“I’m right here,” Steve says quietly, making his way over to him. Relief spreads through Tony as Steve sit down next to him again.
“He’s been spending time with her,” Tony manages to choke out like it’s the worst thing in the world.
Tony goes from mildly concerned to fully panicked. Before Jenna can even finish speaking Tony is half way down the hall to Maria’s room. He prepares himself to kill whoever is in the room with his baby. He looks through the window and freezes.
Alana looks at him with a critical eye and Peter looks at him with a bit of shame written across his face.
“Steve, stop! Please? Don’t do this, okay? We don’t know how this happened okay,” Tony argues with him. Steve melts against the palm that Tony places against his cheek. “Look at me.”
Steve jumps down into the shaft. He hits the top of an elevator, leaving a huge dent. He hears screams inside. There must be people inside, but he doesn’t care. Maria is the only thing that matters, he tells himself. He jumps up on to ladder rings on the wall and makes his way to the doors. He pries them open and finds himself on the third floor. He gets up and makes his way down the stairs and out of the hospital. He doesn’t stop running until he reaches Tony, who’s got all canons on. Fully loaded and waiting for anyone to test him.
“No, okay. He made it very clear. I already made the mistake of letting him too close, but it all ends now.”
“I’ll start working on this immediately. I’ll call you as soon as I find anything,” the doctor says trying to make a quick escape.
If Tony hears him he shows no sign of it. Steve sighs in frustration. Even now, in tears, Tony manages to piss him off and some how also makes him want to comfort him. He goes over to Tony, who is still clutching Maria’s blanket like a life line. He gets down and picks Tony up. Much to his surprise, Tony doesn’t push him away. Instead, he wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and curls into him. Steve takes them over to the bed and sits down with Tony still in his arms.
“Tony, I never got a single call on that phone. Ever!”  He’s desperate. “I waited and waited. I was an idiot, I know that Tony. I don't know what I was thinking. I carried that thing everywhere, hoping. Just praying that you’d have a momentary lapse and give in, but it never came. You’re too good for that. Eventually, I accepted that it was never going to happen and I tried to move on. But I couldn’t. I can’t, Tony.”
“Of course,” Steve says looking at Maria. “How could I turn you down? Tell me, what would you like to do?”
“The team is okay, but my daughter isn’t. She’s dying and the doctors here are trying to use her to get to me. We need your help. I need your people to look at her, to help save her!”
Steve sits up and looks over at Tony, who wastes no time cupping his face in his hands. “All that matters is that you got her the help she needs. The princess is going to help her and everything is going to be okay. We’re going to find the people that did this and we’ll make them pay.”
He really doesn’t want to go, but he wants to see Tony. He wants to see how Tony will react to seeing him in the tux. He needs to know if Tony still feels anything for him. He showers, dresses and makes his way to Nat’s room to see if she’ll do him the honor of not having to show up alone.
“The doctors said there’s no change. Her blood work is a mystery, no surprise there. They’re going to run more test tomorrow,” Tony informs her.
He was raised Catholic, but it hardly meant anything anymore. Life and everything he’d seen made it difficult to believe, not in something greater, but that it was out there looking out for them. He had been pious. He prayed, begged for forgiveness. But he struggled more and more, especially after he came back. The world had changed, he’d changed and like most, he realized he felt abandoned, betrayed.  When he saw his only child laid out low, he decided to put all his faith in what he knew, in what he could see. And it had all worked out because here she was getting better. He put his faith where he should have from the beginning. He put it in Tony, in his family, in himself.
The look on Tony’s face doesn’t give off the impression that he actually means what he’s saying. He stands aside as Tony brings another chair to the other side of Maria’s bed.
“Rogers! I can’t do this with you right now. I know how much you love making everything about you, but I have to take care of MY daughter.” Tony says coldly as he moves past Steve. The words cut him, but Steve knows Tony is lashing out in fear.
Steve can’t help the uncertainty and the fear that gripped his heart. One statement, two truth, two major confessions. He didn’t know how T’Challa would take it and for the first time, he understood what Tony had meant when he’d spoken about other people’s reactions to Maria.
“I don’t know. After we spoke last night, I just thought…” Steve trails off, unsure of what to tell Tony. “Alana told me I could come in. She said Maria would like it.”
“The bone marrow will be extracted from your hip. It shouldn’t hurt very much, but considering your strength we might have to be a little aggressive,” she explains to Steve.
For all his planning, in his haste to just be near Tony, it slipped his mind to think of what he actually wanted to say to Tony.
Steve gets up and runs out of the room. He has the phone. He never could bring himself to get rid of it. It’s a way for him to torture himself. He pulls it out of the bag and runs back to Tony. When he gets back to the room he finds Tony sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands.
Tony looks as though he’s going to have a complete breakdown. His eyes are huge and round and threatening to pop right of his head.
“Sei impossibile!” She cries out in frustration. “Non è più lo stesso. È cambiato! Non puoi vedere? È venuto da solo questa volta!”
Nothing Tony is saying is placating them in the slightest, and it’s starting to be piss Steve off. Yes, they left without saying anything, but it was an emergency and yes maybe in their haste they forgot about Alana and Peter. But they were here now so in his eye it didn’t really matter anymore. Tony looks over and gives him a look and Steve jumps into the fray.
Scott gives Tony a confused look, questioning why he’s getting roasted in the middle of his lecture.
“Of course, please follow me,” T’Challa says as he leads them through the doors and down corridors Steve knows fairly well.
He knows Bone Marrow, he's heard it before. What he doesn’t know is how a sample of it is taken, or from where. Not that it matters to him. He’ll do anything to save her. He’d give up his life if it meant she’d live.
He’s got a bone to pick with the so called specialist he had flown in. It’s been a day and a half and they haven’t given him anything. For what he was paying for them, they should have already given him good news, or any at all. He doesn’t stop to greet the nurse at the station. He knows he should. Alana always does, but he can’t really be bothered with the niceties. Despite the fact they all probably like Alana a lot more than him, they still greet him.
“Our daughter is laying in a hospital bed dying. She needs us. She need you,” Tony says resentfully. “Because for all my money and love, and as much as it kills me to admit, you’re the one she  needs. So be her father and help her.”
“There’s no doubt, but the pictures don’t lie,” Steve says motioning to the family photos that surround them on the living room walls. “…. And you know there’s Peter. I’m certain if anyone asked him, he’d say you hung the moon.”
“Tony, get her out of here. I left a tracker on a bench a few blocks away. Go there. T’Challa is sending a jet. They’re expecting you. I’m going upstairs.”
They stand in the center of the room staring at each other for what feels like an eternity. They’re getting nowhere. Tony is in so much pain and turmoil it’s visible on his face and the worst part is Steve knows he caused it. Tony’s suffered fare more than Steve could have imagined.
When the rest of them make their way in, Maria is sitting in her chair pouting as Tony takes a plate that is more syrup than food away from her. “But I want pancakes,” she grumbles.
“Ugh,” Peter sighs. “Fine, but let me know how RiRi’s doing, okay?” Peter says eyes softening as he walk to Tony, throwing his arms around him.
Steve tugs on Tony’s hand and leads him over to a bench near Maria. Steve drops down like a hunk of stone. He rests his elbows on his knees and slams him face down into his hands. “I’m so sorry, Tony. This is all my fault. God, I’m so sorry.”
“Before you showed up I did something I’m still not sure I even believe in. Something I haven’t done since my mother was alive.”
“She’d only hurt herself if she didn’t know how to use it and she’ll never know how to use it unless she tries. I’m here, I’m watching her. I don’t believe in having ‘kid friendly’ versions of things. We use these utensils and so will she. There’s no point in getting her used to something she’s going to have to give up,” Tony finishes in a voice that dares anyone to question him as a parent.
Steve looks up at her and is about to tell her he’s fine when the shouting in the room stops. He hears footsteps coming towards the door and he bolts. He has to get out there. Whatever either of them have to say Steve doesn’t want to hear it. He runs. He runs down the stairs, through the main lobby, passed the crowd of photographers, who are clicking away, and down the street. He keeps running until his legs ache until he can’t go any further.
“Lo so, Papa. Anch’io ti voglio bene.” She pulls away to look into his eyes. “I waited very long to find you and now I not only have a father, I have a family.”
“That he wouldn’t be able to keep his eyes off of you tonight.” She motions towards Tony where he’s standing in a corner with Sam.
Steve feels a very specific type of pain and anguish he’s never experience before. He’s being punished and he’s sure of it now. He’s a bit hysterical. He’s down on his knees in front of Tony, begging without shame. He’ll do anything to figure it out.
“Okay,” Maria says without any fight. She takes the cracker from Steve’s hand and quietly begins to nibble away at it.
Steve feels like he might vomit when Maria’s tiny little body goes rigid. He lowers them down onto the ground as Maria goes limp in his arms once more. Steve hears what sounds like a stampede heading their way.
Tony gives him a look that is one part awe and one part what the hell. All they can do now is wait. Steve takes back the tracker and they make their way to a location that is less likely to be discovered and wait. It feels like it takes a lifetime.
“Shhh, Steve. Don’t say anything else. Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to have her here, like this, exposed? How hard it is for me to let you close? To either of us? I’m working hard to let you in. Please don’t prove me right by trying to run away from us. You said you wanted to be her father. This is your chance. Don’t waste it.”
“I’m sure she understands Tony,” Steve adds. A lump forms in Tony’s throat when he feels Steve begin to stroke his hand with his thumb. “I thought Matt’s a good man.”
“Here,” Tony says lowering his hands. “I had this brought over. Thought it’d be best if you suit up too.” Tony hands him a bag that has his gear in it.
“Sorry to tell you, but you look absolutely terrible,” T’Challa tells him with a soft smile, coming to stand next to him.
He gets to the door and sees it has some fancy retinal scanner and keycard lock, not that it can stop him. Steve rips the devices from the wall before he kicks down the door. He sends it flying into the room, where the doctors are huddled in a corner. Steve turns and looks around the room. There are screens everywhere with information cycling through them. He has no idea what any of it means. He finds the nearest computer and sticks the device Tony gave him into the first port he finds. All the screens and computers start to flicker. Steve takes this opportunity to start trashing everything around him. Viles filled with God knows what, thrown to the floor. He picks up stools and throws them into computers. All he feels is rage as he looks at all the test tubes and medical equipment in the room.
“Stop playing the martyr. I know that is what this family thinks they do best, but when has it ever helped? I will not let this go on this way!”
A crash of thunder brings him out of his thoughts. Lightning strikes somewhere in the distance and the room is illuminated. The figure a man appears in the doorway and for a split second he goes on the defensive, but he’d recognize the silhouette anywhere. It’s Tony. He’s leaning against a wall in a way that makes Steve wonder how long he’s been standing there. Steve isn’t sure what to do. Nowadays Tony’s likely to leave if he so much as breathes his way.
“You are so strong. I know you are because you have the best parts of us in you,” Steve turns and looks at Tony. “You just have to hang on a little longer.”
“No, first we have to prepare her to receive it. We have two give her a form of chemotherapy,” Shuri explains.
“You’re absolutely sure?” Steve asks, turning his face away from Tony. Tony sees disappointment cross Steve’s face. It’s a look he knows well.
“Mr. Stark, while this sample is helpful. An unaltered, pure sample would be more helpful. You're not a doctor. You could have removed vital information,” he says in a cold and demeaning tone, never once taking his eyes off the vile.
“What happens if we irradiate her and it doesn’t work? What if we lower her immune system and she doesn’t get better? We’ll be helping the virus kill her faster!”
“Take this,” Tony says as he hands him a small device. “The button will kill the lights, once you get into the room stick this into any computer. It’ll spread a virus and destroy everything. It will follow it to anywhere they sent information.”
As he has for most of the days he’s been back, Steve wakes up feeling completely unrested. Every night he’s haunted by dreams of the old life he shared with Tony. He dreams of holding Tony close and telling him how much he loves him. In his dreams sometimes Tony takes him back and it’s wonderful. Other times, Tony tells him he hopes he rots and Steve wakes up feeling like he’s going to be sick.
Tony’s heart swells. Alana is such a positivity light in his life. He has no idea where she gets it. It’s not a Stark trait. Tony wishes he could say with any sort of confidence that Alana got it from her mother, but the truth is Tony could barely remember Chiara. She was a victim of one of Tony’s misadventures and a casualty of Howard’s manipulations. Every time he thinks his opinion of his father could get no lower, his father’s actions continue to prove him wrong.
She immediately drops it and runs to him, throwing herself into his arms. He holds her until she begins to sniffle. “What’s the matter?”
“I extracted your more unique qualities from the sample,” he explains. “All the doctors will have to do is see if it will be in any way helpful to her.”
“What? I - Tony, despite everything… I wouldn’t want anything to happen to her.” Steve looks at Tony horrified. “God, Tony you think I hate you that much?”
“She was born in the house. Vision ran the show. Alana and Rhodey assisted. It wasn't an easy birth,” Tony says looking over at Maria. “My body obviously wasn’t designed for her to make a quick exit. There was a lot of scalpels, lasers, blood and screaming. It almost killed me, but I’d do it a million times over knowing the end results.”
Nat comes over and rests her head on his arm as they all wait in silence for Scott to come around. As soon as he pulls up they all jump in as quickly as they can.
"What good is that gonna do? We've been through all this before," Tony counters his voice laced with venom. "Remember how that went?"
Her presences put him at ease. He relies on her too heavily. She is certainly capable of living her life without him, but Tony needs her. He looks up at her and wonders how he got so lucky.
His chest hurts. Not even their DNA is compatible. How could Steve and Tony not even work on the most basic level?
“Whatever is happening just started. This makes me think that it is the result of outside tampering.”
Steve bolts down the stairs,  jumping from landing to landing. He doesn’t have time to slow down, even if he hears the crunch of concrete under his feet. He keeps going until he makes it out of the hospital. He stops when he feels he’s a safe distance away from the hospital. He takes out his phone and makes a call.
Family, the word brings happiness, but sadness as well. Steve knows he should tell T’Challa that they aren’t a family, that they’ll probably never be a family. At least not the kind of family Steve wants. Try as he might, and he has quite a lot, Steve can’t see them falling into his fantasy of a perfect family. Two parents, the kids, plural, a dog and the white picket fence. What he should be focusing on is learning the meaning of words like Co-parenting. It’s the way huge portion of American families were being brought up. Just another statistic. Just another kid whose parents aren’t together and can’t stand one another, Steve thinks to himself. What a failure.
He’s about to call it quits and leave when he hears an honest to goodness laugh come out of Tony’s mouth. A real genuine laugh. He looks up at Tony in confusion.
“You’ve got it,” Tony shoots back. “Say what you have to say, I don’t have a lot of time. Maria will be up soon.”
Steve hopes the false conviction in his voice rings true. He wants to be confident and strong for Tony, but he isn’t. He tucks Tony into his chest and rests his chin on his head.
Steve’s heart starts to race. Tony looks amazing, he always does. Steve has to fight the desire to go over and take him in his arms. He feels butterflies morph into rockets in his stomach as they make eye contact. Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but Steve thinks he sees a familiar longing in Tony’s eyes. It doesn’t last long before Tony’s face goes flat and he turns away from Steve.
“What?! No, that’s not what I mean!” Steve stammers. He hangs his head and covers his face. So much for making progress.
Steve comes back to find Tony sitting in one of the larger side chairs with Alana curled up in his lap. His eyes are closed as he absentmindedly runs his fingers through her hair. Steve runs the back of his fingers along the side of Tony’s face before he lifts Alana and carries her back to her room.  He comes back again and this time he finds Tony sitting up, staring daggers into the monitors. Steve plops down in the chair next to him. Tony throws himself back into the chair and sighs.
“I do,” Tony answers, pulling the vile from his pocket and handing it over. “It’s an isolated blood sample. Hopefully, this will help.”
The both watch as Steve’s blood fills up the little tube. Tony pulls out the needle and put a piece of cotton over the wound. Steve takes Tony’s hand in his. That little tube is their last hope.
Tony leans closer to Steve, but just a quickly bolts off the sofa before he’s even finished the sentence. “Yeah, I am. I have my family. The family I always wanted. And that’s the only thing that matters. Alana. Maria… Peter! They’re the only things that matter.”
Breakfast goes on without any issues. Maria entertains them with funny kid jokes and little stories about things that Tony has taken her to do. She wows them with her knowledge of the animals she's seen at the zoo and the animals she wishes she’d seen, but knows are essitncted.
He was only one man and it seemed everyone wanted a piece of him. Is this how Tony feels all the time? He’s only had to do it for 15 minutes tops and he’s already caving under the pressure. Tony’s much stronger than he is. He’s a better person and a better father.
“Oh don’t be a baby. It’s time to strip Captain!” Tony says with far too much amusement and if Steve is reading him right a bit of lust.
He thinks over what he overheard Tony and Alana talking about. Tony didn’t want Maria’s life to be an revolving door. Tony knew what that felt like, to have a parent come and go without regard. Someone made it clear that they didn’t want to be a part of Maria’s life. Her mother. No, Tony had said HE.
Tony gently questions her as he gives her a bath and Maria tells him tales of her adventures through wild jungles and enchanted forests with Steve, the sidekick to her heroine. He’s torn between wanting to beat the ever-loving crap out of Steve and the thought that maybe Maria deserves to have any kind of happy memory associated with Steve. From what he gathers from Maria, Steve never attempts to tell her who he is, and at the very least, he’s grateful to Steve for that. But it all makes him nervous. He can’t figure out what Steve wants from them.
Tony closes his eyes and releases a broken exhale, but he moves closer to Steve and kisses him. Steve melts into it. He chases Tony’s lips as he pulls away.
Nat tries one more time with almost the same results, the only difference being that this time Maria looks like she on the verge of tears.
“No, she’s had a few runny noses here and there, but that’s it. She has an excellent immune system,” Tony says, going over to stand next to Shuri as she opens the pod and uses a handheld device to scan Maria.
When Bucky had come back it was a miracle. It was like all his prayers were answered. Steve knows now that he was naive to believe that things could be the way they’d once been. He’d been so desperate to believe that they could back to being the men they once were that he chose Bucky over Tony. He chose his best friend over his lover. Friends first, right? He’d made the decision without much thought. It had just felt right. He had to help Bucky and after they would be okay. But Bucky had different ideas. The day Bucky made the decision to be put into a coma felt like a punch to the gut. He understood why, but it hurt all the same. Steve had chosen Bucky above all else and it felt like Bucky hadn’t done the same. All he wanted was to have his best friend back and then he turned around and abandoned Steve. Karma, as it would seem, was quick to act.
“Sei qui da due giorni. That is too many. You could start a grease fire with your head.” Tony gives her a look, but the truth is she’s right. “You are no help if you end up here too.”
Steve hears Peter grunt as he stands up with Maria in his arms. “When did you get so big? And so heavy?” Peter asks rhetorically.
Steve is sure if he really wanted to he could fight Tony on the matter, but he doesn’t. He’s exhausted if he admits it to himself.
“Hi, Daddy.” The word flows so effortlessly from her lips, as though she’d always said it. Like she’d always known and had simply been waiting for everyone else to catch up.
He cautiously peers into the room and sees the teen sitting on the floor, face in his hand, as he pretends to cry. Maria gets up and throws her arms around his neck.
She winces at the sound and apologizes. “Sorry, I wasn’t sure how hard I had to do that to get through the skin.”
“No changes. She’s stable, though. They’re running more test, but I don’t trust them. I had specialists flown in.”
“A few hours,” Steves tells him. “You should go back to sleep. There hasn’t been any news and I’ve been here the whole time.”
Part of him is beginning to love Maria but another part of him still can’t let go of the resentment. At times, the sight of her reminds him of what he’s lost. What he’s missing out on. Tony started a family, without him. Her name on Tony’s lips feels like a slap in the face and no one’s to blame but Steve. It’s the guilt that drenches his heart. Tony had rightfully named his daughter after his mother, but to Steve, hearing her name was like being forced to watch that horrid video over and over again. Each time he relives the look of devastation on Tony’s face. But he deserves as much. Steve doesn’t even fathom asking for forgiveness. He isn’t delusional enough to think he deserves it or that Tony would give it to him.
“Hey now,” Steve says walking over to Nat and taking the crackers from her. He sits down on the sofa next to Maria. “That’s not very nice. You should say sorry to Nat and Wanda. They’re only trying to help.”
“No, she’s right Steve. It doesn’t matter when she was exposed. It happened. We have to isolate the virus and then get rid of it.”
“Alana sent me home, I had a drink, and then I ran into that overly-rightous Neanderthal. He was sitting in the living room, looking all sad and lost, and the stupid part of my brain let my guard down. How can I hate him so much, so deeply and yet still want to comfort him when he’s in pain? Why does it still hurt me? Why do I still care? How does he still have so much power over me? God, what the fuck is there matter with me?”
“Yes, as soon as I figured out what was happening I covered up until it was impossible and then I locked myself away at in the house until the end. I kept Maria hidden until people would think someone dumped her on me.”
Steve sighs in relief and shakes his head giving Tony a small smirk. It a bit of relief in the entire experience.
“Make the arrangements to get there. I’ll work on getting her out of here,” Tony tells Steve as he pushes him out the door. “Go, I want Maria out of here as soon as possible!”
As though Steve should have expected anything else, their first night back is celebrated with a party. Steve watches as a huge tent goes up behind the mansion. He watches from his room as tables, chairs, and sofas are set up. He nearly punches out a window when Tony’s new A.I system, Friday scares him. In her Irish brogue, she informs him politely that there is a tuxedo in his closet and that he is expected to be in attendance at 6 pm sharp. He thanks her as he walks over to the closet to find one of the perfectly tailored tuxes Tony had made for him. Sorrow and regret fill him as he runs his hand over the material. His mind travels back to the day Tony forced him to get measured, how they’d struggled to keep their hands off of one another long enough for the tailor to make them a matching set. He remembers the look Tony gave him when he tried the finished product on for the first time and how deeply it made Steve blush. How it led to another night of broken furniture and hickeys in amazingly sensitive places.
“Don’t worry we perfected the process, She will only need a few treatments over the next days, but she is ready for the transplant.”
He thinks about his life over the past few years. He’d been given two daughters, in the most difficult and outrageous ways imaginable. The universe has given him a gift, but it also seems determined to rob him of his chance at fatherhood. He thinks of Alana. She’s a grown woman, intelligent, kind, beautiful and by some miracle, despite all her hardships has come out of it as someone Tony feels beyond privileged to call his child. But she isn’t a child and she doesn’t need a father in the traditional sense anymore. Tony is selfish, he’s honest with himself. He should be pushing Alana to branch out on her own, but instead, he clings to her tighter. Now that he has her, he doesn’t intend to ever let her go.
After some time he feels Tony’s breathing start to even out. It’s now or never. He hates that Tony makes him feel like he’s ambushing him, but what other choice does he have? He has to come right out and say what’s on his mind, like ripping off a bandaid, best to just do it as fast as possible. All the fights, battles, wars he’s fought, and a simple sentence is going to be his undoing.
“Tell me that everything is going to be okay,” Tony whispers out, broken and wet. “Tell me that she’s strong enough to beat this.”
“This isn’t about her! This is about you keeping her away from me! You don’t want me to be a part of her life. You just want me to help and then disappear!”
“Excuse me, Sir?” a young woman says to him as he walks past the nurse’s station. “Sir, you can’t just go in.”
“That’s not what I meant! Don’t be a grouch,” Tony says feeling a bit guilty. “I’m in need of counsel here, you know, before I do something we’ll all regret later.”
Steve turns to Tony who looks a second away from collapsing. “Why don’t you go lay down in the room, and I’ll deal with them?” He tells Tony.
“I think we already are,” Tony says clipped and short. He can feel the hatred radiating off of Tony.
Tony carves out a bit of time to spend with everyone. Even Wanda, Vision and Tony spend time alone discussing possible ways of helping Vision. He, Clint, and Scott bond over
Steve follows close behind as they make their way down. Steve’s surprised to see it in a state of neglect. All but one spot. It looks as though Tony had recreated a hospital room.
Tony, on the other hand, is still spoiling for a fight. “WHAT DO I WANT? WHAT DO I WANT? IS THAT A JOKE?”
He watches as Tony blows out a window and takes the pod out with him. Steve steps closer to the window and watches as Steve takes off looking for the tracker. Steve readies himself and walks out of the room. The nurses and doctors on the floor look at him in fear and concern.
“Can’t complain. I’m alive and so is Maria. Vision didn’t do half bad for the first male c-section birth in the history of the world,” Tony continues completely ignoring Steve’s last statement.
Peter and Alana are waiting for them in the hall. Alana takes Tony’s hand in hers and Tony brings it up to his lips and gives it a gentle kiss. Peter hangs behind and looks to Steve for comfort. He does the best he can and squeezes the kid’s shoulder.
“All joking aside, please go and enjoy yourself Nat. This will probably be the only time we’ll be able to have a good time all together.”
It isn't much longer when out of nowhere, they hear a swoosh of air above them and a jet appears. It hovers lower and lower as it becomes visible. The door opens and Princess Shuri exits.
“Oh, Captain. Hello,” he continues, extending his hand out to Steve. Steve quickly shakes the doctor’s hand and makes his way over to Tony.
Tony nods as he disconnects Maria from the machines and places here inside what Steve can only describe as a mini spaceship looking pod.
“For the love of God,” Tony mumbles under his breath. “Maria! Only two pancakes! TWO…. and no syrup!” he shouts, racing to the dining room.
“No, it’s fine. I have something for her,” Steve explains as he pulls out a small grey bunny from the inside of his jacket. “If you could just give it to her…”
A shot rings out in the room. It misses him by a mile, but it gets his attention nevertheless. He turns and sees one the doctors point a gun up at him. Steve dives out of the way before she can get another round out. Damn, he doesn’t hit women, but he has to get that gun out of her hands. Steve jumps up and runs towards her, grabbing her by the wrist and forcing the gun to the side. She pulls the trigger and Steve’s ear feels like it exploded, but he doesn’t let it stop him. He reaches over and rips the gun from her hand. He squeezes her wrist bit harder and she crumbles to her knees. Steve releases her and she crawls back to where the other doctors are.
On the drive home, Tony thinks about his girls and inevitably about his own parents. He’d be damned if he makes the same mistakes as Howard. The man had done everything in his power not to be a father or a grandfather. The day Tony learned the truth of Alana’s parentage was the day his whole world shifted. He figured out what it truly meant to be a parent. When all of the terrible things Howard had done to him fell to the wayside in comparison to what he’d done to Alana. What he did to his own granddaughter. What he did to both of them.
“Our lives are already a media circus. Do you really want to add to that? Do you really want cameras to be shoved in her face?”
She has a look in her eyes that Tony knows well. It’s pure Stark determination and there’s no winning against it. He sighs as he gets up and embraces her. “What did I do to deserve you?” He murmurs into the top of her head.
“She’s going to be okay,” she says as she places her hand on their shoulders. “Better than okay. I’m going to give her another treatment.”
He chest aches at the sight of her, laying in a bed that was far too big her, surrounded by beeping machines. She seems smaller than ever. Now that he’s there with her, he isn't quite sure what he should do. He grabs a chair and sits down next to her bed and lets out a sigh.
He makes his way outside into the tent where he’s met by a truly impressive spread. There are ribbons hanging from chandeliers, tables covered in lanterns, fire pits flaring surrounded by sofas and off to the side, the pond has floating candles in it. In the center of it all is a huge dance floor, with a live band playing songs he remembers by heart. He keeps to the perimeter. He watches as people sway along with the music. He watches their happy faces blur by. It’s times like this when he misses Thor and his ability to put anyone at ease with his rambunctious curiosity. He watches as his family members dance and make toasts with one another. Every once and a while he joins them. It’s surreal and wonderful for all of them to be in the same place. Their smiles are infectious and he lets it help him forget, even for a little while.
“Of course it’s extremely elevated. I’m in the middle of science when Friday tells me to get my things together because Matt is coming to get me! And then she finally tells me that Maria’s in the hospital?! What the fuck?”
The more he thinks on it the surer Steve is that he was insane to have sent Tony that phone.  He couldn’t believe he ever thought Tony would be receptive towards it. Hey, I know I just lied to you and broke your heart, but here take this cell phone. Idiot! He kept telling himself that Tony would come around. At the end of it all,  he ended up alone, no best friend, no lover, no home. He was stuck in Wakanda staring at his own identical, stupid cellphone, waiting for a call that never came. The worst part is living knowing he’d led good people, his friends, down a path they may never fully come back from for his own, thinly veiled, selfish reasons. There was only so much they could take before they caved. Clint and Scott have children. Being apartment from them, knowing they might never be able to see them again was too much. That’s what brought them back here and Steve couldn’t fault them. Steve couldn’t help but feel like it was only a matter of time until they all made compromises and Steve would be left completely alone in a prison of his own making.
Steve looks at him in shock but does his best to recover from this slap of information. He looks at Alana, she’s unfazed. Okay, so they both know. He shouldn’t be surprised.
“Can’t argue with you there,” Tony says a bit dejected. “Alright, well I think I’ll see my little angel before I go talk to those scam artists. How’s she doing today?”
“Here. Tony look, I never got a call. Look at the history. There’s nothing there,” Steve says proudly as he shoves the phone into Tony’s hands.
She doesn’t answer, but Steve feels her nod her head against him, and her sobs turn into small hiccups. She is burning up. Steve brushes the wet hair from her forehead.
He lays down as everyone around him prepares for the procedure. Shuri opens his robe and pulls his briefs down a bit on one side. Steve finds that he’s nervous. Not for himself, but for Maria. This has to work. There are no other options left.
“I wish I could say something more than I am sorry,” she says with anxiety spread across her face. Tony takes her hands in his.
Maria is completely oblivious to the tension that settles in the room, only acknowledging the sound of her own name. Apparently, raising children is a hot subject.
Tony's face contorts as nods. They position the pod between them as they got on the jet. As soon as the doors close, Shuri is shouting commands at the others on the jet. Everyone is in position to take her orders.
Steve is out of breath by the time he finished the sentence. He thought it would feel strange the first time he calls Maria his daughter to someone else, but it doesn’t.
Steve watches her rush off to where Clint is talking to Rhodey. The men welcome her with open arms and smiles. He watches as the trio make their way out the doors and into the yard. He hopes they all have a good time before it inevitably falls apart. He downs the scotch and orders another. They don’t affect him, it’s more about keeping his hands and his mind busy.
Steve watches as Tony huffs and walks over to the bar to pour himself a drink. He notices Steve watching and let out a bitter laugh. “You’ll have to excuse me, your holiness.” Tony brings the glass to this lips and downed the whole thing. “I'm a bit stressed.”
At the mention of whip cream, Maria’s face lights up. Her little smile is so infectious Steve can’t stop one from forming on his own. Tony guides Maria as she puts two pancakes on her plate, loads it up with fruit and helps her put a nice little serving of whip cream on top. Tony hands Maria a fork and knife and tells her to cut small pieces and to finish chewing before her next bite.
Shuri looks at the screen, tilting her head from side to side. “You are right. I need to take a biological sample.”
“Finally embracing the creepy old man persona?” Tony says in a tone that’s meant to be flippant.  He’s been drinking.
“Tony?” Steve whispers out as he looks up, trying to make heads or tails at what the other man’s looking at.
“Wow, very well said,” Tony says, eyebrows raised and eyes wide. “And since I am now fifteen minutes behind schedule, I’m gonna go. Great talking with you Rogers.”
“God, Alana. I’ve been leaning on her too much.” Tony lets out a huff. “Just another shining example of my failure as a father. She can’t stand me right now you know.”
“Hopefully they’ll have better luck,” Steve says. “I don’t understand how no one can tell us anything.”
Every room he walks into he hears Tony’s voice, light and free and calling out to him. Every dark corner brings back memories of passion. The heat of all the fumbling kisses they shared. Kisses that always led back to the bedroom they shared. The bedroom that now belongs solely to Tony. Some nights the desperation to give in and crawl into bed with Tony, consequence be damned, is overwhelming. Maybe Tony would let him stay, maybe things could go back to the way they were. It’s wishful thinking, but he aches for Tony and the ache makes him desperate. It’s on these nights he wanders. Most nights he wanders.
“I thought for a minute that it would be better to keep her here and have the doctors come to us. But when it came down to it. Having her in the hospital seemed like the safer thing to do.”
“Shhh,” Matt whispers. He watches as Matt cups her face in his hands. Somehow he knows that Alana is looking down and lifts her face back up to his. “Talk to me.”
The three of them look over at Maria’s tiny, fragile body. A shiver runs through Steve at the thought of the horrors people might inflict on her.
“Oh, uh, I asked if there was any possibility that anyone knows about Maria. About us?” Tony watches how a faint blush spreads across Steve’s cheeks at the mention of them.
“Steve, I wasn’t suggesting,” Tony sighs, no conversation between them is going to come easily to them anymore. Trying to navigate the hundreds of layers of subtext is exhausting. “I didn’t think that’s what you meant. I’m just asking for your honest opinion on the situation.”
Jenna smiles at him softly. “They looked like a bunch of doctors who are getting paid way too much.”
Steve finally interferes when it looks like Peter’s going to drop her. He takes Maria into his arms and lets out an involuntary
“Thank you, doctor,” Tony says in a flat tone. “I’ll see what we can do about getting you that DNA sample as soon as possible.”
“Papa has sad eyes,” she finishes before her sniffles turn into full-fledged tears. Steve feels a deep swelling pain through his whole body. Every part of him is screaming to find out why, but he’s not stupid enough to drag her into their mess.
“Come on, Captain. We haven’t seen our family in a long time. Let’s go and try and have a good time.”
Tony wants to be mad, he’s sure it’s what Steve expects, but he doesn’t have the energy for it. “No, it’s okay,” Tony says, plopping down into a chair next to Maria’s bed. “Honestly, it’s nice not to have to be on all the time.”
“What is taking so long?” Steve growls. “Isn’t this the age of the technology? I thought everything was supposed to be incredibly fast? How can this of all things be taking so long?”
“Can you blame me?” Tony says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “It’s what you do isn’t it?! You disappear when things get hard!”
Steve closes the space between him and Tony. He pulls him until Tony’s back is pressed tightly against the front of Steve’s chest. He wraps one arm across Tony’s chest. He laces their fingers together. Then he reaches out and pulls Alana to them with his other arm at the same time as Tony yanks Peter.  They huddle close together as they watch the first drips of bone marrow fill the IV bag. He feels Tony go ridge in his arms. He doesn’t know what he expected, but it’s anti-climactic. It was stupid to think the second the bone marrow hit the saline they’d see results, but it was what he’d hoped for.
Before Tony leaves he stops in the doorway, with his back to Steve. He turns his head back to him and says, “If you can’t sleep you could always finish up some of those movies. They’re all still on pause. Friday would be happy to help.”
As soon as it slips from his lips he feels Tony’s body tense. There it is, two words have changed everything. “Say it Tony. I want to hear it come out of your mouth. Say she’s mine.”
“It just felt, wrong. Something about the way he was holding that vile of my blood and looking at it. And the way he was talking to you. I’m sure he isn’t half as smart as you Tony.”
“Yes, because then at least I’d know what he wanted from us, but right now I have no clue what he’s doing and it’s making me insane.”
“Steve… that's not,” Tony says cautiously, as though he’s only just realizing the magnitude of Steve’s reaction.
“I don’t even have anything to say to that,” Sam says in a nonsense tone. “It’s gonna take an hour to get to you if I’m lucky. So sit tight. Go get a coffee, no get yourself a camomile tea or something.”
He makes his way up the stairwell to the floor he knows the doctors have taken over. He walks onto the floor and snaps the handle of the door before he pulls the fire alarm. Then he pushes the button and the lights go out, just like Tony said they would. There’s water streaming down all around him. The doctors come out of the room and immediately rush back in at the sight of Steve lumbering down the hall, soaking wet.
“I wanted to be close by in case you or anyone else needed me. And Scott offered to show me this really awesome move,” Peter explains.
Hatred, at a level he’s never felt before floods through him. It makes him want to feel their bones crunch in his hands. It scares him. He’s never felt this way before. You’ve never had your daughter’s life threatened before, his brain supplies. For the first time, Steve feels no remorse. There’s no understanding there.
T’Challa let out a soft laugh. “I’ve asked you to please call me T’Challa. We are friends, no need for formalities.”
“Thank you, but please, just call me Steve,” he tells the nurse. He doesn’t really feel much like the Captain of anything anymore.
“Yeah,” Steve fibs, really it’s only a half lie. He enjoyed seeing everyone, spending time together, even though some of them were missing. He just wishes that things were different between him and Tony.
Shuri walks up to him and jabs him in the arms with a needle, with more force than necessary.  “Ow!” Steve says rubbing the spot.
He could lose her, before he’s even gotten the chance to really know her. His fear is quickly replaced with anger. All this time he let Tony play the victim. Every time he manges a bit of control in his life it’s ripped away, but not this time. If it’s true, if somehow Maria was birthed from the insanity that had become his life, it’s for a reason, it’s God’s purpose and he isn’t going to ruin it like everything else.
“I don't know, Steve. I don’t know anymore. I thought I knew you, but you lied to me. You hid so much from me. Please don’t insult my intelligence and pretend it was to spare me. You did it for him. You chose him over me. So what I supposed to think? Hmmm, Steve. Tell me. Tell me what I'm supposed to think? How am I supposed to believe you? Trust you?”
Tony let Steve in and gave him everything and Steve had crushed it. Steve ruined him. As much as he loves the girls, there’s a part of him that they could never fill. He feels like an empty shell.
“Because Papa’s sad and you’re sad.” Now Steve’s heart stops in his chest and falls into his stomach. Tony is good at hiding how he feels. Steve knows it first hand, but apparently, it’s true when they say you can’t hide anything from kids.
Before they leave, Steve goes over to Maria’s bed and kisses her cheek. “I’ll be back angel,” he whispers into her hair.
Tony immediately tenses. This is dangerous, but he can’t bring himself to care. For the first time in months, Tony feels a bit of peace. Maybe he’s completely slipped into madness, but he’s going to try. Everything’s still terrible, Maria’s still sick, he and Alana aren’t speaking to one another, and at any moment Steve could say something that would make Tony want to strangle him, but at this moment they’re okay.
For the first time, being with Tony, being loved, put Steve at ease. Then of course, once he realized how he felt the doubt, the shame, and guilt took over. Who ever would have thought, the great Captain America, was a self-sabotager. It was easy at first, to let Tony shoulder all the blame. When everything went down hill Steve simply stepped back and allowed everyone’s assumptions about Tony prevail. Steve had always believe that God had a plan for everyone. He also believes that God didn’t give directions. He lays out the destination and send you on your way without a map; and boy what a mess he made. Taking the long way there is an understatement. He wonders if he’s even on the right path anymore.
Steve’s brain’s making a connection, but Steve can’t accept it. It’s impossible… and yet, something in his heart tells him it’s true. His heart starts to race. Being near her feels right. He’s starting to feel dizzy. There’s only one answer. However unlikely, however improbable, he knows it.
The kids come back and they eat in silence. All of them too scared to speak up and risk the chance they’ll miss something. More time passes and the princess attempts to soothe their fears by showing them the results. Maria is well, she is simply sleeping. It does little for Steve, but he keeps it to himself. Time passes, the sun rises and it falls. The staff turns over, Alana and Peter come and go, but Tony and Steve never leave Maria’s side, her stalwart guardians.
The waiting room is small and just as sad as the wall that greeted them. It’s too bright and there aren’t enough chairs for all of them, but they make it work. You don’t become a superhero if you can’t sit on the floor for extended periods of time.
Tony freezes at the thought of his eldest daughter. He’d put her through too much. He let her shoulder too much of his own shit and she was cracking under the pressure.
“Think I’ll find a tea that will help me figure out what the hell is going on in my life?” Steve let out in a humorless laugh.
“That hurts RiRi. That really hurts my feelings,” he hears the teen saying using an over-exaggerated crying voice.
He can’t stop the sinking feeling in his stomach. It’s telling him that it’s his fault. The only way she could have been exposed was on one of the days Steve had her outside. Somehow, Steve knows that it’s his fault. Tony was right. He’s no good for his daughter. His dread must be visible on his face because Tony moves behind him and squeezes his shoulder.
“You’ll just do anything to keep her away from me, won’t you?” Steve spits in disbelief. “My gosh Tony!”
“Steve?” Tony calls out. He looks around as his eyes adjust to the darkness of the room. For a moment panic sets in. Steve abandoned them, again.
“Because, you know, it’s gotta be weird for you to be back here, in this house…” Steve cringes at Sam’s vocalization of what they all know.
No, there’s no way he’s going to follow in Howard’s footsteps. But he’s also not going to be a fool. Even if it seems to be Steve mission.
“Yes, my daughter. Her name is Maria. Please, we don’t have a lot of time. She’s very sick,” he pleads, voice cracking.
“Right, I’m heading to the hospital now. I’ll keep you updated,” he says facing Peter. “As for ‘awesome moves’ you can practice all you want after you’ve finished your homework.”
“STEVE!” Maria shouts, with her arms outstretched towards him. “Steve! Come play with me!” She’s practically jumping out of Peter’s arms, who’s truly struggling to keep hold of her.
“You’re gonna let her use a real knife?” Clint asks a bit scandalized. Steve’s confused. The knife in question isn’t very sharp and Maria has a more than decent handle on it.
“Before? Tony, what are you talking about?” Steve says confused. “Stop trying to confuse me! How could you keep this from me Tony? How could you do this to me? How could you keep my daughter from me?”
“Fine, I go…. Eat and sleep,” Tony says, sounding resentful that he has to engage in activities so plebeian like, giving his body nourishment and rest. The three of them watch as Tony not so much walks away as he does drag himself out of the room.
It’s his greatest mistake. Every day his decision to keep Tony in the dark eats away at him. They weren’t a perfect couple, far from it. Lord knows they turned arguments into an art form, but they were happy, they loved each other and he threw it all away. While Steve willingly shoulders most of the blame he knows Tony played his part too. There’s no way he would ever let Tony get away scot-free. Tony’s stubborn and controlling. He has no consideration for the rest of the team’s opinions. He just does whatever he wants without consulting anyone, without consulting Steve. They were supposed to be partners, in every sense of the word. It didn’t always feel that way. They would never agree on everything, but when push came to shove Tony never hid personal information from him. At first, Steve convinced himself he was sparing Tony from the pain of knowing and simultaneously sparing Bucky from the knowledge of knowing what he’d done. It had all made sense at the time.
Missing out on so much of her life made him determined to never miss a moment with Maria. He does all the typical parent things. He takes pictures of her constantly. Every step, every noise Maria has made is well documented. He’s taken both of his daughters to every park, play, museum, and popcorn stand he could find. Absentmindedly, Tony slips a hand under his shirt and runs his finger over the scar on his lower abdomen. His daughters are both a blessing, but Maria is his little miracle.
“Steve! What happened?” he hears Tony’s panic-stricken voice calling out to him. Steve is frozen in place as Tony throws himself down next to Maria’s unconscious body. He hears a chorus of confused voices, but can’t focus in on any of the faces.
Steve fills up a cup and snaps the lid and straw into place and brings it over to her. He sits down on the edge of the bed and angles the straw down towards Maria. He holds it steady as she takes small sips. At this point, Tony has laid down in the bed next to her and pulled her close to him. Maria looks up at Steve and smiles.
Tony’s hand slips from his face and he’s awake. For a second he doesn’t remember where he is, but reality quickly catches up to him when he looks down and sees his little baby laying in a hospital bed. He’d been dreaming, dreaming that everything was okay. He’d taken Maria and Alana on a picnic. But the dream ended and what he’s left with is far from a picnic. There are no smiles or laughter here.
Steve isn't sure what he was expecting. A love confession, an apology, an acceptance of his apology? It’s a letdown, but that’s more his fault than anyone else.
“No, you don’t. I’m the one who’s up every night sick to my stomach thinking about every worst-case scenario. I’m the on-“Steve cuts Tony off before he can continue into another tirade.
She turns to look quickly between both men. “I can’t stress enough how this is completely experimental.”
He sits up in bed as he hears the same high pitch giggle, that has woken him up every day, going down the hall. Every morning they are greeted by Maria’s sweet voice singing out,
“Put on this gown, the opening in the back. You can leave your underwear on,” Shuri cuts in a no-nonsense tone.
Steve watches Tony’s movements become more and more erratic. He get up and goes to Tony, but as soon as he touches Tony’s arm, he’s shoved away.
For the first time in his life, Steve’s legs give out from underneath him. They collapse onto the floor, with Steve’s knees taking the brunt of it, with an audible crunch. But he couldn’t care less because Tony just said the best three words in the whole universe. Maria’s getting better. Their daughter is going to be okay.
“Yes, it looks like they went after her because of me. People have tried many times over to replicated the serum and they have all been relative failures. But Maria’s the perfect opportunity for a whole new path of experimentations. The advances the serum has given me have been passed down to her. Do you understand? This is a whole new way for these people to create super soldiers.”
Maria forcefully shakes her head back and forth and squeezes her eyes shut. “Yes,” Steve tells her. “Do you want to feel better and go play in the garden?” he asks.
It must be nice to have someone who is concerned with your well-being, Steve thinks to himself. To have someone who fights with you because they love you and want what’s best for you. No matter what he does, somehow everything he thinks about leads him back to Tony. It’s the house he’s sure of it. He’d been both nervous and excited about coming back. Now he realizes how stupid he’d been. Being back there only made everything worse.
“Nat, you don’t have to stay with me. Go find Clint and Wanda and have a good time. Instead of looking after an old man,” he tells her as she hands him a scotch neat.
Steve sits down on the coffee table in front of Tony. As soon as he does it he realizes what a big mistake it is. His choice means he’s sitting in between Tony’s parted legs. It’s far too intimate and they both know it. They sit in uncomfortable silence, staring at each other until Tony looks away.
"Wouldn't do anything for me," Steve tells him honestly. The man nods and walks away, thankfully understanding that he wants to be left alone.
The hospital is where time comes to die, specifically, in this very waiting room, Steve is sure of it. They have been waiting for over an hour without a single word from anyone. Steve is sitting next to Peter who is attempting to distract himself by doing homework with the aid of Matt. Wanda pours herself another cup of terrible coffee and everyone else is staring off into space. The silence is starting to make Steve’s skin crawl. In his frustration, Steve slams his head against the wall and leaves behind a pretty sizable dent.
“I’ll be okay. Goodnight Sam,” Steve says, patting the other man on the shoulder before making his way towards his own room.
Steve sees Tony’s conflicted. Tony wants to say something and as horrible as it’s likely to be, Steve wishes he’d just say it. He’s sick of trying to compile a list everything he’s done to Tony. Because despite what everyone else says Steve knows there’s more going on than Bucky and his parents.
He slowly makes his way down the hall to Maria’s room and freezes when he grips the handle. He’s nervous, which is just ridiculous. She’s a three-year-old, an unconscious three-year-old. He holds his breath, opens the door and walks in. If anyone asked what he’s doing in Maria’s room he wouldn’t have anything to say to them, because he isn’t sure himself. All Steve knows is that it feel right. It feels right for him to be there, with her. He decides he’s going to stop pretending he has any idea what’s going on in his life and instead, embrace whatever comes his way.
He’d felt tormented by the decision he had to make. It’s funny to think back on it because he feels infinitely worse now than he had then. But at the time, his happiness, his joy made him feel terribly guilty. Tony made him happy. Tony loved him and he loved Tony. That was the problem. Tony made him forget. He made Steve forget all the people he’d left behind. All of the people who deserved to have a chance at happiness, far more than he did. Survivor's guilt Clint once told him, but it’s more than that.
“At least some things never change. It’s still funny to watch you squirm, Rogers,” Tony says around the mouth of the glass.
At first, Steve thinks Matt stood up in reaction to the bang of his head, but then he realizes that he turned to face the hallway opposite them, where Alan was making her way towards them. She’s a wreck. Everyone stands when she reaches them. The first thing she does is throw herself into Matt’s waiting arms and begins to sob.
She ushers them in. Tony hangs back, Maria’s pod behind him. Steve stands next to him and gives his hand a quick squeeze. “We have to go Tony. Princess Shuri is one of the brightest minds in the world. If anyone can help Maria it’s her, but we have to go now.”
Tony turns to face him and throws his arms around Steve’s neck. “It’s working. She’s getting better.”
“We found some common abnormalities. We need more samples to run tests,” he says looking directly at Steve. “A complete DNA sample would be even better.”
“Go home,” she tells him. Tony tries to make one final protest before he caves. “Don’t make me kick your butt, old man!”
Steve has to get back. He hops on his bike and speeds back to the house. He has a mountain of questions and this time he isn’t going to take no for an answer, not anymore. He races back as fast as he can. He doesn’t even bother putting the bike in the garage. He drives right up to the front doors and jumps off, leaving it laying out in the rain. He pushes the doors open and the slam against the walls with a loud bang. All the lights are out,  except one. He saw it on his way in. The master suite, the room he’d once shared with Tony. He runs to the door ready to burst through, ready for a fight. He’d gone over everything he was going to say on the drive back. But as he reaches for the knob, he hears crying. It’s Tony. Opens the door, the sight of Tony curled up into a small ball on the floor, clutching a small blanket shakes his resolve, but he can’t let anything stop him.
Steve lets out a sigh of defeat and Nat quickly leads them over to the bar. He feels bad. He knows she’ll stay by his side all night long, babysitting him. He can’t stand the thought that he’ll end up ruining her night too.
He goes to Maria’s side and brushes a strand of hair off of her face. He wonders if the chemo treatment has already begun to take effect on her body. Nothing about the whole process instills confidence in him. He tries to think back to a point in time when he felt like he had control over his life and comes up short. He feels so out of control. He wishes he wasn’t so completely useless. Even though it was his bone marrow that was going to save her, Steve still felt like he wasn’t doing anything to help.
More often than not he ends up in the living room, sitting in the dark. Even there he finds little peace. The sofa seems bigger and colder without Tony. He thinks about all the nights he spent cuddled up with Tony watching some movie Tony promised Steve would like but they rarely finished. It’s a terrible feeling to be a stranger in a place you once called home. The house looks the same in most ways. It’s the little things that have changed the feel of the house. The pile of toys in the corners, children’s drawings randomly stuck to the walls, goldfish and half eaten rolls of crackers on the coffee table, tiny shoes everywhere. The pictures of a happy family on walls. Those sting worst of all. It’s been over 3 years and Tony has every right to move on with his life, but could anyone fault Steve for secretly hoping Tony missed him, even a little?
This isn’t the line of conversation he’d been expecting, the truth is Steve is concerned. He did want to know more. He’s had a terrible knot forming in his stomach that only got worse with each passing day. But this feels wrong. He feels like somehow Tony is leading into dangerous territory. Steve sighs, all their conversations are littered with land mines.
Steve closes the door and turns to face Tony. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to just take over like that. But I’m starting to understand your hesitation. I just didn’t care for how he was speaking to you.”
Whenever Steve feels like he’s lost his way the first thing he does is to go back to the place where he’d gone wrong and try and course correct. He thinks back over every conversation he had with Tony. Yes, he’d been a bit too optimistic in thinking Tony would be glad to see him, but he never imagined Tony would not want him around at all. Then there was Maria. She’s at the root of all their problems. She isn’t a problem, but she’s there at the center of it all.
They make their way down the main staircase, where guests are checking their name cards, and everyone stops to stare. Where Nat flourishes under the attention, Steve wants to crawl under a rock and hide. He tries to focus on the music coming in through the back doors. She gives him a tug to remind him to put on his mask. He can’t be Steve, tonight he has to be Captain Rogers, Captain America, and Captain America is friendly and happy. He snaps a smile into place.
Steve looks at the rest of them. Seeing the twin looks of uncertainty on Clint and Nat’s faces is unnerving.
The doctor practically cowers in front of Steve. Tony sort of feel bad for the man. Not many people on the receiving end of Steve’s frustrations aren’t intimidated.
Alana looks like she’s about to protest, but Steve stops her with a raised hand. “But, we will, okay? But first, you need to back off and give him some space. We’re sorry we didn’t say anything, but it was all time sensitive.”
Steve is beyond control. The dam has broken and the tears are running down his face. He can feel the mucus from his nose beginning to run down his face but he can’t bring himself to care.
“Mr. Stark,” another doctor calls out as he comes into the room. Steve shoots up as Tony brushes his hand across his lips and readjusts himself in the chair. Suddenly it feels too small.
“Get up Tony,” Steve calls out as he tries to keep his voice as steady as possible. “I mean it, enough. We need to talk. I have questions and you have the answers. We can’t do this anymore.”
While getting naked in front of Tony isn’t anything new to him, hell, even stripping slowly and with intent isn’t new to them, but doing it in front of other people certainly is. It wasn’t as if they hid their relationship before, but they never announced it either. It’s strange that only after it’s over should Steve feel the questioning gaze of everyone in the room on them and feel uncomfortable. Although, at this point, it didn’t truly matter considering everyone in the room most likely already know Steve and Tony are Maria’s biological parents. Tony does nothing to alleviate Steve discomfort. In fact, he makes it worse as he wiggles his eyebrows and crosses his arms in a manner that says get on with it, don’t make me wait.
“I should have known better than to think that I could have anything good in my life. I couldn’t keep my mother, Steve left, so why would I get to have my daughter be happy and healthy? I’m not meant to have anything good in my life. I’m cursed and she’s suffering for it.”
While he waits he works up the courage to listen to the message Tony left him. He can’t help but think about how long he waited for a different message on a different phone that never came.
Clint and Wanda look at him in shock, but Nat has a small smile and a twinkle in her eyes. After she eats a few more and takes the medicine he gives her, she falls asleep in his arms. She’s even heavier when she sleeps. He dares say that his arm might be falling asleep, but it’s worth it. She sleeps for almost an hour, during which the trio leave him and head off to buy lunch in town.
“That’s… fair,” Tony responds. He looks down and realizes they’re still holding hands. He coughs and let's go. “What did you mean being hesitant?”
“It isn’t that simple. I don’t have all the things I need on the ship. For now, we will keep her under until we can get her back to my lab and run more extensive tests.”
“Hasn’t anyone told you not to keep a lady waiting?” She asks as she spins in a small circle. She looks beautiful in a long, silver gown. It highlights all of her ample attributes.
“Hi princess,” he chokes out. “There’s so much I want to say to you, but not like this. You see, I’m your dad. I know I haven’t been around long, but I promise that’s going to change. I’m going to make this all better and then we’re going to go so many more adventures together,” Steve whispers as he strokes Maria’s forehead.
After he hangs up with Sam, he realizes however super he may be, his jacket is no longer helping him and the cold air is biting at his skin. He makes his way down the street and stops when he finds a little place. Against Sam’s advice, Steve sits down at the bar and orders black coffee.
“It’s okay,” Steve says, rolling up his sleeve and offering up his arm. “Do you think that this will help?”
He sits down on their big, cold, empty bed and down his drink. He runs his hand across the space Steve once occupied. He can’t keep the tears at bay. He’s so lonely. There are times when wakes up and feels Steve next to him. He can almost feel Steve’s finger roaming across his body and he aches from it. He sees Steve in the corner of the room. He wants to reach out for him and he hates himself. He’s sick, he’s twisted to still love Steve so much. He hates him, but Steve’s still the only man on his mind. He’s tried to move on, to find someone new. He’d dated Aiden for months and every time he touched Tony, all he could only picture Steve. Amazingly, it hadn’t worked out. He couldn’t be so selfish. He couldn’t hurt someone else like that.
When they get word that there’s a possibility for things with the Accords to change, Steve jumps at the opportunity. They all know none of them are going to change their minds, but it isn’t a secret what Steve’s true motivations for agreeing are. No one says anything, they all jump at the chance to see their friends again. They’re told that Tony would be hosting them in his home upstate. From what Steve knows Tony spends most of his time there, away from prying eyes. It makes sense. It’s a safe place to raise his daughter. Tony sends a car to pick them up and bring them to the house, where he already has their rooms arranged and waiting for them. Steve had hoped he’d get a chance to talk to Tony alone, but the moment doesn’t present itself. He goes to the room picked out for him and sighs as he sits on the edge of the bed. It’s an amazing room, beautiful in design, leaving nothing to be desired, except for its location on the opposite end from where the master bedroom is, from where Tony is. He knew Tony would be angry and hurt, but he truly didn’t think that years later he’d still feel as strongly as he did.
“I would tell you not to worry, but that would be foolish of me. It isn’t too soon, I promise. I would never do anything that would hurt her.”
Tony and Steve rush to the hospital. The get into the car and head to the hospital. The silence is like needles digging into his skin. Tony can barely take it.
Tony looks between Peter and Scott with a bit of jealousy and a bit of distrust. Apparently, he doesn’t like sharing any of his children’s attention.
“She was my mother and I loved her. And I know that if she were here, she would have loved you and Maria.” Tony’s voice cracks as he finishes.
“I will let you have some, but these,” Tony explains as he holds out the plate for one of the servers to take, “are not pancakes anymore. You can have two pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, and a little bit of whip cream. Okay?”
“Shocker,” Tony says pouring yet another drink. “Then again getting anything useful out of you has been painful.”
The rest of the trip is riddled with unease. Tony moves and puts distance between them, inches feel like miles.
“Not, so great. There’s so much to tell you, but there’s no time. I need you to send a jet over as fast as you can,” Steve says unable to control the panic rising in his voice.
“Sorry, I forgot to warn you, Maria wakes up stupidly early and she’s full throttle from the second her feet touch the ground until the second she goes to sleep, which I should mention now is also a production,” Tony seems both proud and annoyed. “She’s just extremely excited to have guests. We don’t get many.”
When Maria wakes up she’s groggy and lethargic. She eats a few more crackers before she slips out of Steve’s arms and goes to grab some toys to play with. Steve watches her in amazement. The ‘toys’ she’s playing with aren’t really toys. The first time he’d seen them, Vision informed him it was a molecular model kit. He’s not a toy expert by any means, but he’s positive other three-year-olds are not playing with the same things as Maria. It’s clear she’s inherited the Stark genius gene. Steve studies her as she works on her creation. Every day he spends with her, he sees just how much like her father she truly is. She’s warm, friendly, and charismatic. She is all the things he loves about Tony.
“Are you even listening to yourself? Don’t you think they’re going to ask questions? Don’t you think they’re going to want to run every test known to mankind? Two biological fathers and no mother isn’t exactly common.”
“I don’t know if she does and the point is she shouldn’t because I’m supposed to be the parent. And as for Matt, he is a good man. His extra-curricular activities, however, could be better.”
When his mind finally slows down and he comes back to reality he realizes he has no idea where he is. He finds a bench and sits down. He's facing a body of water he’s almost positive it the East River. He pulls out his phone. He has four missed calls from Alana, two from Nat, two from Sam, there are four voicemails waiting for him, along with a single missed call and voicemail from Tony.
