It still amazed Steve, sometimes, how quickly certain things could happen in this century when you had access to enough resources. He’d grown use to it on a small-scale, with things like food delivery and twenty-four hour convenience stores, but it was on a different level entirely to have a full supply of paint, decorations and furniture (kinky and otherwise) appear seemingly out of nowhere with less than a full day’s notice.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, it was fine. I suspect Talia does not fully realize the reality of what she has agreed to yet; our methods are so different from your own that she knows but cannot possibly understand how different her daily life will be. So while I fully anticipate some revisions becoming necessary, for now we are on the same page. And you, Captain Rogers?”
On this occasion, even Peter’s morning-brain did consider lying. Lately, though, he’d been finding that the truth of his life was so alienating to most people that trying to fabricate a fiction that would have the same effect was just not worth the effort. And something about Steve’s hesitation in asking made the unnecessarily antagonistic part of him (the teenager part, May would have said) come out. For once, he didn’t want to pretend to be fine when he wasn’t, not even if it made Captain America uncomfortable.
Like usual, his friend came to, surprisingly alert. He did, however, blink down at Peter several times. (Was it egotistical of Peter to wonder if Ned was checking that Peter was really there?) The Spider-Man suit was sticking out from the inch or so of Peter’s backpack that he hadn’t finished zipping before they’d fallen asleep in the wee hours of the morning. Ned hadn’t dared to touch it then, treating the suit with an exaggerated hero-worship that Peter suspects was masking a more complicated reaction. Even if he hadn’t understood at the time, Ned had seen Peter after some of the worst of his nights as Spider-Man. Undoubtedly he’d been remembering them all, and the more gradual way that there had been almost nothing left of Peter himself in the weeks before Tony had come into his life. Before either of them could change their minds, Peter unzipped his bag, grabbed the suit, and pushed it into Ned’s hands.
Steve shouldn’t have laughed. He really shouldn’t have laughed, because God knew he had been where Tony was, totally wrong-footed and bewildered by his partners and embarrassed by that fact. And he wasn’t really laughing at Tony so much as at the absurd, wondrous joy of having Tony in front of him, yelling and cursing and making ridiculous demands all because he was being confronted with feelings and thoughts he didn’t know quite how to handle.
“After you thought James Barnes had died, both times, how did you cope? What were your responses?” A knot of unease formed in Steve’s belly.
I am running out of new ways to communicate how great you all are, and how lucky I am to have you all as readers, but I'm going to keep trying! Because you're just that fabulous. Thank you for your comments, questions, and kudos, and for sharing your wish-lists for the rest of the story. Based on those a lot of you are (hopefully) going to be pretty happy with what's coming!
When he took a long inhalation, it felt easier to draw in a full, complete breath of air than it had since before Siberia. He eyed the spot at Coulson’s feet again.
“Is any of what you've figured out critical enough that it can’t wait a day or two?” Steve demanded, tightening his hold and pressing his nose into Tony’s hair. He smelled like all the usual scents of the workshop, and even with the grease and sweat that accompanied it, Steve could easily have stayed there forever, letting his body learn and re-learn everything there was to know abut Tony’s.
They remained there in a kind of standoff, Natasha offering no more than she had to, and Steve trying not to feel hurt by how secretive she was being. This had once been her MO, of course, but he’d thought they were long past that, had assumed that Natasha knew she could trust them with anything at this point.
“No,” Tony said shortly. He elected, in fact, not to answer pretty much all of Bruce’s usual questions, and refused him permission to view JARVIS’s food logs for good measure. The guy had to be getting frustrated, but he did far better at masking the reaction than Steve had done. Somehow, this made Tony even angrier.
“Bite for a question. Deal?” Tony offered, and Steve obligingly launched into an explanation of the different accommodations the park made for weather during the winter. As they talked and ate, Tony slide closer until their knees and shoulders were pressed against one another. Eventually, the conversation expanded away from just the park. When asked about his day, Steve offered with only a whisper of anxiety that he’d spent the morning in a therapy session. If anything, Tony seemed happily surprised by this news, and in turn shared a story about his own therapist (a woman he’d affectionately nicknamed ‘Suckerpunch’) threatening to fire Tony as a patient several times. As they talked Steve could see the traces of mustard and relish at the corner of his mouth, could feel the vibrations of Tony’s laughter against his side. (Tomorrow, he resolved, he would donate his entire paycheque to the park. It had recently become one of his favourite places in the world.)
“I’m sure you handled it beautifully, Tony. I’m just sorry you had to. You can go get some rest in your own bed now. One of us will handle Steve from here.”
"We have a new problem. Tony asked me about marriage the other day. He tried to couch it as a matter of interest kind of thing, but I’m pretty sure based on that that it wasn’t. This means something to him.” Phil rocked back on his heels, stunned, and saw his own feelings mirrored on the expressions of pretty much everyone in the room.
Aunt May had seemed a lot more relaxed over the last few days, Peter realized. He’d assumed that had been a response to Peter’s own life settling down, but that had probably been a little self-centered. May cared about him, sure, but he wasn’t the sole focus of her existence or something. He flashed Steve a grateful smile, then regretted it when he saw the tight, pinched look that Tony couldn’t quite manage to hide for a few seconds. He left the room shortly thereafter to fetch more wine from the cellar, even though the bottle sitting at the centre of the table was just under half full.
“You ready, buddy? Sure that bench is okay, not putting too much pressure on your chest or anything?”
“In that case we should probably try for something simple to start,” Steve recommended. “A double column tie, anchored to the bar over there?”
There was no disobeying that tone, and the cool rush of air into his lungs combined with a series of hits from the flogger just below his hips were enough that he might as well have been coming. His mind was gloriously, completely blank, numb to everything but the pain singing across his back and ass. Thudding was not enough, not even close to enough of a descriptor to capture the way it felt like Bruce was inside him, even more deeply in some ways than just fucking him, because this wasn’t just one place it was everywhere. He had taken over Tony’s entire being from the inside out.
“Of course. Let’s talk a little more informally, though, unless you’re in pain anywhere I should take a look at?” Tony shook his head, then let it fall back against Bruce’s chest. His shirt smelled like sunshine and the fancy organic detergent Tony had once kept his homes stocked with, before preparations for the showdown with Thanos had made such comforts irrelevant. He sighed happily and pressed a kiss against Bruce’s bicep, feeling oddly thrilled at the contact given how formal check-ins normally were. “Talk to me, honey. You seem good today, hmm?”
“Oh, Steve mentioned you were doing some work on your college stuff today. It’s been a long damn time since I applied, but I still got some game. Where all you thinking about going?”
has had several interactions with the Avengers to date (we learned in the main branch of the narrative that she helped build the photon shield for Captain Rogers, for instance); her orientational needs are unique following her accident, however she remains contracted to longterm partner Maria Rambeau.
He shuddered, body unable to take the heat of anticipation without some kind of response, and the moment was broken. The sharp edge of arousal and Dominance left Bruce’s gaze as if it had never been there at all, replaced with wide-eyed panic, and the other man jerked backward with more violence than he had the day Tony had poked him with an electric probe. Seeing Bruce scard and backed into a corner was not exactly a new phenomenon, but Tony himself had never been the cause of it before. It hurt. It dumped ice into his veins and left his skin feeling prickly and pulled tight over his bones. Bruce seemed to realize it after a few seconds, and he reached out across the gulf between them with a halfhearted,
“I’ll say,” Bruce agreed wryly. “And it’s especially ironic given that if anything you have things backwards. Things are essentially reversed for Dominants; Dominin works by hyper-stimulating the amygdala. Dominants are incredibly sensitive to the emotional and physical status of their partners; in headspace, they are almost single-mindedly obsessed with providing their subs with whatever they need.” Tony blinked, casting around for the little terminology he knew from his time experimenting in the scene.
Of all the many mistakes he’d made over the years, all the ways he’d attempted to find absolution, it had never been so complete or unambiguous as that moment. (He’d known instantly how addicting that feeling would become if he let it.)
Tony wasn’t sure if that thought, the idea of being known and seen that way, was more disquieting or arousing. He was, however, willing to find out, so he stood and stripped off, though without making the kind of display of it he might normally have done. Clint still nodded his approval, raking his eyes over every inch of Tony with a leisurely kind of arrogance, like it was his right. Unsure if he was supposed to sit without invitation, Tony withstood the inspection as long as he could. Just when he was considering making a break for the couch without permission, Clint gestured to the spot next to him.
“The Board is planning to leak this on Wednesday. That gives us until Monday or Tuesday at the absolute latest for you all to the let the public know that Tony is…well, here.”
“You have this. You can do this. Whatever’s going on, whatever this is, he needs you to be calm and steady for him just like you always are. His controlled variable, didn’t he used to say?” Bruce smiled weakly, even as his heart thudded a rapid beat in his chest.
His first absurd thought was that someone had found a highly specific set of recorded affirmations and snuck them into the penthouse, but the voice was too strained and drawn to have been designed to be motivational.
Natasha came a few days later. She’d insisted on reviewing the information Phil had already compiled, keen eyes roving over the screen seeking out patterns and connections that just weren’t there to make yet. He could feel her frustration, felt it himself every time Tony responded differently than they expected or said something that just didn’t quite make sense.
As he watched Phil’s fingers trace reverently over the gleaming white keys of the piano that Obie had been the last to touch (at least in Tony’s own universe), he considered that maybe it wasn’t his presence here that felt odd, but rather the team’s. Unlike the Tower and the Compound, the Malibu home had only ever been his. Yes, he’d cemented his role as Iron Man here, but it had also been the last place in the world except for a cave in Afghanistan that he’d been just Tony Stark. After it had been destroyed he’d never bothered to rebuild, turning his attention instead to the team, and to defending the Earth alongside them. It hadn’t even felt like much of a loss, not at first, not until everything had fallen apart and there was nowhere left to go that wasn’t linked to one bittersweet (or just plain bitter) memory or another. And now the team was
“Well, Malibu might be temperate but late November is still a little too chilly for surfing. As long as the floorpan is the same, though, there’s a sunroom and a pool on the upper level. Being warm sounds pretty damn good right now, as does seeing the lot of you wet and in very skimpy swimwear. Come on, you basically can’t say no to me right now, right? Dropping, broken sub and all?”
“Six—no, maybe five.” If Tony was using the same scale they all did then there was no reason at all for Bruce to look so pleased as he recorded this answer. But Steve had learned his lesson about unwanted interruptions during Bucky’s check-ins; Bruce had zero compunction about kicking any one of them out for interfering with the process. Check-ins, he’d told a furious and protective Steve more than once, were the submissive’s time. They were an opportunity for the sub to make sense of and process anything they were working through, whether it be a health problem or a scene that had left them feeling confused or conflicted; beyond the questions Bruce needed to ask to keep them healthy, the sessions weren’t supposed to be about any Dominant and their needs at all.
“Fletcher,” Phil said, already in the process of digging his phone out, presumably ordering SHIELD’s systems to run every conceivable check and surveillance on the guy.
“The shrink. She’s threatening to bench me from active service if I don’t start seeing some kind of—professional. To handle the sub-dep.” She spat the last word like it was something horrible and dirty and shameful, and for a long moment Steve wondered if he would make it out of this conversation with his own dignity in tact. Because Talia was just….so very, very much like Tony. Clever, brave, and deeply, uncontrollably angry at what felt like a betrayal from her own body. It had taken Tony years to come to terms with his need for submission; even now Steve couldn’t say for sure if he’d ever truly embraced it. From the best anyone could piece together, Talia had been resisting her orientation for nearly a decade; she’d spent most of her adult life in some degree of sub-dep, struggling to keep a steady job because of mandatory wellness programs much like SHIELD’s. She didn’t identify as trans-oriented, she just (like Tony, though for different reasons) had a deep and profound hatred for the things her body and mind required to stay healthy.
Anger, at least the all-consuming brand that had dominated Tony since he’d learned of Ultron, also needed to be fed. It had chewed up everything Tony had offered over the past several days it with relish—the years worth of hurt and rage and frustration from his own world that there hadn’t been time to process with Thanos’s arrival always on the horizon; the incontrovertible proof that had they acted on his fears instead of dismissing them, there would never have been a Snap to undo; even what some part of him knew was an unfair obsession with how easy Mark II had seemed to have things was enough to keep it going. Everything Tony so much as looked at seemed to nourish the rage-monster that had taken up residence in his psyche. Even innocents like Rhodey hadn’t been safe from its desire to isolate and destroy.
“But not immediately following it. Any leads on what the difference was?” Everyone else shrugged, but Steve looked thoughtful.
Phil supposed it made sense that without orientation playing a role, marriage would have a more powerful role in Tony’s original universe. But his head was also spinning at the idea of facing a second set of expectations, especially since they wouldn't even know what most of them were. The others were just as lost.
Having faced his own mortality quite recently, Tony felt it was entirely fair to deem the mix of dread and anticipation surrounding him on the short elevator ride from Rhodey’s floor to the penthouse to be comparable in most respects. Sure, he knew that no member of the team would actually cause him lasting physical harm, but that might honestly be preferable to putting the final nails in the coffin of yet another relationship. (How sickly ironic that he’d been prepared to leave these people just days prior, and now the knowledge that he was likely on his way to be broken up with made him queasy.)
“Not being on holiday sucks,” Clint was complaining. “New York is like Eeyore personified right now, I’m already losing my tan I swear. And I miss James, and the ocean, and that really good pizza place by the Malibu house that always delivers for us.”
“It was an open declaration of war, and I knew that caving on that would mean setting a precedent to either become nothing but a figurehead, or find myself out of a job in under a year. After that their methods got…more creative.” Tony was positive she hadn’t mentioned this part before, because it was impossible to miss the way her body closed in on itself, becoming smaller before his eyes. Even if Tony’s brain was all the way broken he would never miss anything that made Pepper look like that, because it made him instantly, powerfully murderous.
. If he’s starting to take on some of the biochemical characteristics of a submissive, he doesn’t want to wonder if that’s the only thing that made you want him. And if he’s not, then he worries he’ll be disappointing you all, especially you because of your classification. You can tell him that none of that is true until you’re blue in the face, but you’ve seen how empty words can be in our circles. Take this one night, before the bloodwork and the media and any of the rest of it, and show him that you’re choosing him just as much as he’s choosing you. Get dressed up, bring him flowers, hold him inappropriately close on the dance floor, the whole works. I’ll handle everything else.”
What if, after so long just spending time in his own skin, Tony couldn’t convincingly manage to put those defences back up again? (What if he succeeded, and the team decided they liked the facsimile of Mark II better than the incomplete and flawed version of submission he could offer them?) The bit of cucumber he was still chewing turned bitter in his mouth, and Tony nearly choked trying to swallow it down.
Tony should have known, really. Natasha was always at her most dangerous when she was in the shadows, and he hadn’t seen her since he’d moved over to the bench. It was almost insulting how much it could hurt for her tiny hands to connect with his ass; he wondered absently if it was comparable to flogger in a way, if somehow the smaller surface area of Natasha’s hands made the impact stingier. The blows felt just as rhythmic as her work with the paddle had, maybe even moreso. She kept at it long enough for his mind to start to visualize the pattern as a series of music notes: a rest here, an eighth and then a few sixteenth notes here, a long whole note whenever she let her hand rest for a few beats on his skin. When he closed his eyes, he could almost hear the music of it playing alongside the percussive impact of her hand.
Natasha, along with most of the rest of the team, was thankfully out of the Tower today. This had left Tony free to venture down to the shop and break into SI’s system. (The firewalls had clearly been changed since Mark II had passed, and while whomever had done the work was good, they just weren’t equal to any version of Tony.) In less than half an hour, he’d located the worst offenders in the attempted coup against Pepper, deactivated their credit cards, alerted two of their wives about extramarital affairs, and programmed the phone of the one who had attempted to find a loophole to deny Pepper’s holiday bonus to play an endless loop of Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money.” He’d also, with a slightly more guilty conscious, worked his way into Pepper’s private server in order to find some of the ongoing R&D projects and leave corrections and suggestions, along with an unsigned and triple encrypted note telling her she didn’t have to pass any of it on until after the news about his presence in this universe went public.
“I’m coming back,” he announced, rising to his feet and seeking out the shield. Talia would have to understand, and if not he could probably figure out a way to leave her with the Wakandans and check in. Whatever else this Tony was, he was still a version of the man Steve loved, the man it had become Steve’s goddamn purpose in life to protect and care for. He’d failed his version of Tony, would never get him back, but that didn’t make his instincts or his heart any less determined to ensure the wellness and safety of this Tony Stark.
“Nah. Bucky and Sam are supposed to be up later, and I’ve long since learned that letting them be hungry around one another only makes their tendency to act like toddlers worse.” Peter tried and failed for several seconds to imagine quiet, serious Bucky Barnes or the funny but rigid Sam Wilson acting like a toddler. He was almost relieved when Steve added, “Any, uh, any reason you didn’t get much sleep?”
“What, you think you’re the hero right now? You realize that by ‘saving’ me from the terrible fate of a light collision with a sheet of glass, you may in fact have broken my tailbone, right? My ass is definitely bruised, which, if I’m going to start dating is really not something I want to have to explain to anyone.”
“You take out your own garbage?” Tony blurted. He knew that Pepper eschewed many of the protections and luxuries that came with being a Fortune 500 CEO, but when Tony found whichever member of her security team was allowing her to take her garbage out to the bins, there were going to be words. Many words. Meanwhile, Pepper glared and opened the drawer to his desk, likely to find something to fling at Tony. When she found only a single pillow, the glare went from semi-annoyed to downright poisonous. “Oh come on, I’ve never been able to get stuff done in spaces like this. All my real work happens down in the shop, you know that.”
Steve had been the one to cry that night. He’d gathered Tony into his arms, had picked him up the way Tony usually forbid him from doing, and carried him all the way across the penthouse to the bedroom. For once, Tony had managed to keep himself quiet as Steve had undressed him with painstaking care, then slid on his softest pair of pyjama pants and the sweater he’d stolen from Steve’s wardrobe during his first mission after they’d gotten together. After tucking Tony into the bed and surrounding him with every damn pillow in the room, Steve left only to return with a platter of food that could easily have fed five of Tony, and watched with almost visceral satisfaction as his submissive ate every bite he could manage.
enough space—” A piece of popcorn flew across Steve’s field of vision, a much-needed reminder that he had a part to play in all of this. (For someone who hated being on stage with such passion in his early days as Captain America, he considered it a sick kind of irony how much it felt like he was playing the part of Steve Rogers, and poorly, most days.) What would Before Steve have said about this?
“So I wondered if maybe we might consider combining those two aims—prepping you on expected submissive behaviours and helping your own issues with food—by trying out some hand feeding.”
How much could he reasonably be expected to tell Tony? Where was he to start? The witch’s vision? The fact that in its wake Tony had elected to forego sleep and food and basic hygiene until Steve had bodily dragged him from the labs? He certainly couldn’t tell this man, this version of Tony who would never understand, that his Tony had begged Steve for his first punishment the next morning, that he’d sobbed as he was held over Steve’s lap and spanked until he’d confessed all of it: the vision, his fear of a looming threat, his and Bruce’s use of the scepter. (This man couldn’t possibly understand what a release that had been for them both, how close it had brought them, how Steve had never loved Tony more than the moment where he'd laid himself and all of his anxieties and anger and trauma bare.) But if he started with what happened after, the weeks Tony and Bruce had spent consulting with Thor, Stephen Strange, Odin, pretty much anyone who would listen as they took Ultron’s code apart and put it back together, then laid out a rigorous morality and ethics training program for the young AI, wouldn’t that be a lie? Would he really be answering the question Tony had asked him?
“And what about developing those kinds of relationships with any other members of the team?” Rhodey swallowed, even looked a little anxious or embarrassed for the first time during the conversation.
“’s fine. Just…again, Pep, please.” She frowned, pursing her lips in an expression that felt distinct from the numerous versions of disapproval he’d seen in his own world. (But then, Pepper and Tony had never been romantically involved in this universe. Perhaps this was what Pepper looked like when Tony screwed up relationships that didn’t involve her—all the sadness, but none of the anger and disappointment that came up when it was her he was hurting.) Eventually, she sighed and began her explanation again from the beginning.
to wait. I will, I swear I will kiss you goodnight and take you to your floor if that’s what you want, but if you don’t, please may I take you to bed now?”
Word traveled quickly after that. Tony, who loved being around the team but who was also unused to having constant company, usually took one day a week to spend on his own. This quickly became the team’s time to gather on Phil’s floor and rant about themselves. Sometimes the complaints were funny, such as when Natasha threw a less-than-dignified drunken fit over learning her other self had been blonde for the end of the world.
The worst part was that Tony could see all of these machinations as plain as day and they were somehow still painfully effective.
“I know the feeling,” he said honestly. “And we don’t…I don’t want it to feel like charity or something, either. Look. What if we call it an internship?” His voice cracked just a little on the last word, but he covered it up admirably with a cough. Peter was too tired, or too befuddled, to recognize anything was amiss. “I’m on vacation for a bit longer, but when I’m back we’ll set up some times for you to come to the Tower. You can help me out in the lab, and as a bonus you’ll have all the space and materials you need to improve the suit and the web fluid.”
So I reflected a lot this week on how and why I am still so energized and excited about this fic after all this time and all the words already spilled. And a lot of it comes back to you fine folks! This story has had an incredible, active, generous readership basically right from the start, and I'm so grateful that you're still here with me.
Content Notes: This chapter continues on almost immediately after the previous, so we're still dealing with Bucky's safeword and Tony (with help) working through the feelings left behind by his punishment last chapter. This includes (spoiler) so-called 'submissive high,' a post-punishment euphoria Tony initially takes to mean the team has 'fixed' him. He struggles with disappointment and sadness upon learning that's not the case, but the team helps him through. It also transpires that Bucky has a particularly strong 'Dominant voice', which Tony reacts very strongly to. Bucky doesn't provoke this response on purpose (the team isn't totally used to needing to regulate that with Tony) but it still happens.
“Tony is fine. He knew exactly what he was doing last night; he had JARVIS look up how to support Doms in dep, and he offered the help he could while remaining well within his own limits. He didn’t tell you because JARVIS told him the probability of you turning down the help if you knew what he was doing was as high as ninety three percent.” Steve barely had time to digest the news that he hadn’t forced the very low level of Dominance he’d exerted last night on an unwilling partner, which was both a relief and hugely disconcerting. (Because that meant Tony had knowingly, willingly offered Steve his submission, and what was Steve supposed to do with that news? How could he feel so grateful and angry and guilty at once?) Because then Phil added, his cool tone entirely at odds with his otherwise submissive bearing, “He certainly did a better job of practicing self-care than you have done for yourself these past few weeks.”
“No,” Natasha said simply. “We are done with that now. The slate is wiped clean, you have nothing to apologize for.”
Nothing seemed remotely abnormal until Tony woke in the middle of the night with an idea for upgrading Drama’s sensors and threw open his bedroom door only for Steve Rogers to tumble, quite literally, onto his feet.
Every time Thor brought the strap down, he followed it with messages of love and support and forgiveness and protection. There was no escaping it, the words or the pain, nowhere left even in his mind for Tony to shield himself. He was flayed open, raw and exposed, on the edge of something he both feared and welcomed. Thor handed the strap off to Clint, who walked around first to the front of the bench, knelt down, and kissed Tony on the forehead.
We also got our first #AskStrange entries, one about the orientation classification system and one about the outcome of the Infinity Wars in the MCU-verse. Responses were posted to Tumblr, and are now also up on A03 as a part two to this story. If you want to participate in this interactive component of the fic, you can ask questions here or on Tumblr; just remember to tag them #AskStrange so I know you're asking him and not me! If you have no idea what I'm talking about but think it sounds like something you might be interested in, see the extended notes at the beginning of chapter one.
. Worked on me and these guys,” Butterfingers whistled in protest, “and gal, sorry dear. He’d work on us for hours. Plus he’d use the time to teach me about all kinds of music he thought I should know about. For a long time it was one of the only things I had to look forward to. So when he was gone, I…well, I ain’t a genius like he was, but I couldn’t just leave ‘em down here alone. I pieced together what I could from watching him do it, and JARVIS taught me the rest.”
“Anything.” Thor’s voice was a shattered whisper, a mere echo of his typical booming tones. But like everything Thor ever said and did, the vow rang with painful sincerity. Steve blinked back the tears that rose to his eyes in response; for once, he didn’t want to be anywhere other than right where he was, and with who he was with, and the gratitude that provoked was an ache beneath his ribs that threatened to pull him apart and put him back together all in the same instant.
That left Coulson. Which…maybe not the worst idea. Coulson’s role as handler for the Avengers had been a mostly abstract thing in Tony’s own world, a taunting reminder of another way the team had gone wrong almost from the very start. Here, though, it hadn’t taken long to realize that Coulson had fulfilled all that promise and then some. Tony had witnessed first-hand how the man’s mere presence was sometimes enough to impact the team, drawing Clint out when he otherwise seemed inclined to retreat, and soothing the more brutal outbursts of Thor’s rage.
"Captain Rogers.” JARVIS spoke in a voice that was as close to a whisper as he could approximate. Even so, Steve was surprised when Tony didn’t even twitch next to him; he’d never known the sound of JARVIS’s voice to not have his creator up and halfway to his feet, often before he even knew the full reason for JARVIS’s interruption. “Captain Rogers, either you will wake Sir or I must. You are in the early stages of top-drop, and you need his assistance.”
“General Zabu is resting after her patrol last night. But she has asked that you join her for dinner in her chambers this evening.” (She would know. Masdee was brilliant and perceptive and entirely unimpressed by the legacy surrounding Captain America, which meant she was never afraid to speak her mind with him. Most of the time all of this would be counted as positives, but now…)
“You’re dead on your feet. Whatever you’re doing can wait. And no, to answer your question. Tony is currently doing the worst impression of a sleeping person I’ve ever seen in my life. Even Dummy isn’t fooled. But I’m going to give him the dignity of pretending to believe him for at least twenty minutes before I go check on him.” Pepper nodded, her head falling back against the back of the sofa. “Maybe I should put you in next to him,” Rhodey teased, stealing a swig from her beer. “It makes me tired just lookin’ at you, maybe it would rub off on him.”
“You might fight differently enough from our Tony that Taskmaster will notice something’s off. That’s something we can try to analyze and account for in the future, but for right now—well, he’s annoying, but from what we know of the situation as it stands, he’s not a significant enough threat for it to be worth the risk. I’ll be the first to let you know if that changes.”
Clint arrived in the penthouse two minutes early the next day, clad in a pair of dark washed blue jeans and a plain grey t-shirt that lovingly hugged chest and abdominal muscles that Tony hadn’t known existed and which he was now apparently doomed to be fixated on forever. He greeted Drama, their robot llama, with all his usual enthusiasm, bending down to pat at the top of her head and throwing a quarter down on the floor for her to collect. (The bot had proved to be a complete klepto, always rooting around in and under furniture for shiny things to steal, a tendency that Clint was way too indulgent of in Tony’s experienced bot-parent opinion.) Then he waited, just as he had the evening prior, for Tony to meet his gaze. It took him close to a minute to manage it this time, he kept wanting to fidget or fixate on something else simply from nerves, but Clint’s patience was a force all its own.
“Okay. Then we should talk about how you think we could handle these cases better.” Just like that, like it was nothing for Tony to walk in and criticize how Steve was running his massive spy agency, and nothing for Steve to offer to change based on that input.
“Thought you might be hungry. We haven’t kept the fridge and pantry up here very well stocked lately.” And oh fuck, they were from Peter Pan and the light layer of condensation leaking through the bottom of the cardboard box meant they were still slightly warm. If there was a damn cruller in there Tony might weep.
Steve was the first to come in. He still wouldn’t reveal how he’d managed to gather any background at all about Tony while he’d been on the other side of the world, but he reported that the development of Ultron (which all of them had been able to gather from Tony’s rather extreme reaction had ended rather badly) had coincided with mental attacks from the Scarlet Witch that Tony had never been asked about and had never elected to share with his team. Tony had also revealed that the wound on his abdomen, which Bruce had reported to all of them, had been caused by Thanos stabbing Tony with a piece of his own armour.
Even though Steve had been the one to put Thor in the air today, witnessing him hoisted several feet above the bed didn’t feel all that dissimilar from all those other occasions where he'd watched Thor fly. The suspension rig that Steve had meticulously assembled using Asgardian rope was holding Thor beautifully; Steve was damn near obsessed with the point where it cinched at Thor’s waist and then met a larger grounding knot at his groin, spreading out to wrap around both thighs and under his ass. The chest restraint required for the simple seated suspension was fairly minimal, but on a whim Steve had added a lace-up armbinder, so that Thor would feel the press of the knots all the way from his shoulders to his hands.
“We recognize that for now this is mostly between the three of you. However, I do have a suggestion if you’re willing to hear it,” Phil said, his voice was the same deep well of calm competence it always was during the worst, most disastrous missions. May, Tony, and Peter all nodded. “Peter, I think the only thing that’s going to really help you believe that Tony is serious, and that you can trust him, is time. Perhaps prior to starting your internship with Tony, both you and your Aunt would consider joining us for dinner on a weekly basis—whenever works for your schedules. Then all the pressure of getting to know one another isn’t placed on this one morning.”
“And being settled, what does that mean? Like I won’t want to sub as much? Wait, are we about to become the old married poly people who never have sex?” Bruce snorted, pressing his hips up against Tony’s so he could feel Bruce’s half-hard cock against his back. It was another thing he never would have done during a regular check-in, and even though Tony had come to value the regularity and routine of how those sessions were run, he was also more than a little delighted by the easy show of Bruce’s desire, even if it was likely never going to go further than this right now.
And then Clint sank, jerky and unsteady, to his right knee. Before her brain could even begin to process that,  T’Challa, a King who knelt to no one, followed. (The cry she’d heard. No. No.) Unwillingly, her eyes began to seek out the absences rather than the presences, but it was not a long search. It didn’t need to be, not when Steve crashed to his knees with painful finality, like he never intended to stand again.
?” Talia asked. Masdee turned to face Steve’s agent with her usual mix of grace and intensity. Her silence was the only indication she gave that Talia should continue speaking, which she did after a few seconds’ pause. “I just…if they blame Wakanda for not offering up their medical technology, Princess Shuri is the face of those advancements. Maybe the sale of the weapons is a ruse, a distraction from something bigger.” Masdee exchanged several tense words with one of her captains (C’Chemi, if he recalled correctly—she’d saved Clint’s life once, when he’d performed another of his heart-stopping dives off of a massive piece of scaffoling.) Then she turned back to Talia.
It was awkward at first; Barnes clearly wasn’t used to working with a hostile audience, and he glanced backward at Tony every ten seconds or so as if awaiting criticism. But the thing was…there was nothing to critique. Barnes was absolutely methodical. He cleaned cooling vents and filters, tightened bolts, checked cable connections, all while keeping up a gentle prattle that appeared to delight all three bots.
“There are dozens of potential effects, and they can vary widely from person to person. And both are referred to as ‘Domino Hormones’ because a large part of their effect is to stimulate the production or circulation of other hormones that the body wouldn’t otherwise naturally produce, at least not in high quantities, during the conditions of a scene. These include testosterone, serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine, estrogen, and of course endorphins. But they also have some functions unique to them. Generally, subtonin works primarily on the anterior cingulate cortex, which is the part of the brain that—”
has been touching War Machine for anything but the most basic maintenance I will pretend to be a ghost and haunt their asses. Jesus Christ is this—what is this tech? It’s not Hammer, I’d know his shit anywhere, but it’s way too close for my liking. JARVIS, get me specs, and a background on whoever made this garbage.” Tony was…well, he was fondling War Machine, there was no way around that. (So sue him. The last few years had been focused entirely on getting War Machine compatible with Rhodey’s new bracers and other changed physical requirements. There’d been zero time for the fun kind of upgrades. And the poor thing had been practically in tatters when Tony had made his rather abrupt departure.) But this shit was honestly beyond the pale. He could tell just from looking at several of the guns affixed to the suit that they were shoddy; one of them looked to have a damn bullet lodged in the barrel. “Squib load? Seriously? This could have taken your damn hand off, Rhodey, Jesus.” Midway through Tony’s muttered complaint/work list, a soft mechanical swish signalled the opening of the shop doors. Somehow he was not all that surprised to find Coulson making his way inside, trailed by Dummy. The latter immediately made himself busy, circling the shop in long loops like a king surveying his territory. Coulson, meanwhile, flicked his gaze back and forth from the suit to Tony several times, then nodded, that decisive, tight motion that had always meant business.
It felt sort of like he was a grouchy god they were trying to appease with tributes. But they were also sort of delicious tributes, and before he totally knew what was happening, he’d been herded towards the living room by a pleasantly chattering version of all these people who seemed to know Tony, even this unfamiliar version of him, far better than he knew them. There was a long awkward moment where several of them stared at an oversized purple pillow on the floor in front of the couch. (Maybe the other Tony had been neater than he was? He hadn’t even been the one to put it there, but whatever…) He was in the middle of picking it up and settling it onto a space-gray armchair when JARVIS announced Barnes and Rogers’ arrival.
“He can take War Machine,” Rhodes offered. “I’ll pilot Iron Man, keep any interested parties off our tail, then ditch the armour somewhere and meet you all at the hospital. Where do they have him?”
“Not even remotely. And it’s not definitive proof of anything. Yes, it might mean that Domination really isn’t for you. It might also just be a sign that you need more time to move between headspaces, or that you’ll always be most comfortable exploring Domination in conjunction with some level of submission. Could even be a hint of top-drop. None of those are bad or wrong options. And look, I know that we’ve been pushing you for honesty and reflection a lot lately, but that doesn’t mean we expect you to have all the answers right away.”
Content Notes: Okay, there's a few for this chapter so bear with me. The big one: Steve talks at some length in this chapter about the day that D/s Tony died. While there are no detailed or graphic depictions of violence, it's obviously a depiction of a deeply traumatic event. If you're doing your best to read around the descriptions of loss in this story, I would skip all of Steve's sections in this particular chapter.
him. It’s not actually entirely a first. This one time in my old universe, on the flight to Afghanistan actually…” Tony was halfway through the story of the flight, including the stripper pole and scantily-clad flight attendants, before he realized what he was doing. He could count on one hand the number of times he’d volunteered information about his own universe like this, especially the happier memories; with how sensitive he was about the other Tony, he’d just assumed the team wouldn’t want to hear anything but the shitty stuff about their counterparts. But when he dared a wary glance at Bruce, the other man was smiling widely with no signs of frustration or hurt colouring the expression.
With symphony, I’m not stretched quite as thin in terms of perspective (Steve and Tony are our only POV characters except in AskStrange shorts.) I’ve also grown a bit more confident, so while I still outline the major story arcs as well as each chapter, they’re more point form now, and I’m also more inclined to let the characters take me places I wasn’t necessarily planning on going. (For those of you who have read the ageplay verse, I actually owe a lot of that to Clint; he surprised the hell out of me when I wrote (That Would Be) Enough, and in such wonderful ways that both I and readers felt great about. He was a great lesson in trusting my instincts.)
It was a slight and subtle movement. Hell, his body was so out of practice with orientation-based interactions that he was surprised he didn't creak like the Tin Man pre getting oil in his joints. When he dared look back at Gwen, he found the space she had just been occupying a moment ago empty. On the low table in front of him sat a brightly coloured flyer, inviting him to a house party at Liz’s in three days time where Gwen’s band Fridged would apparently be providing the live entertainment.
Dr. Strange got some excellent questions this week that he'll be posting answers to soon as well, so keep an eye out for that!
“I decided it might be time to change that once it became infinitely clear that none of you fools were going to let anyone else treat anything but the most superficial scrapes and bruises. Did yours, did he never…”
“Infinity,” Tony supplied immediately, and with none of his customary snark. He had already learned that jokes about anything related to the safeword, or consent more broadly, were
“Yessir.” Clint’s hand wrapped back around his dick before the second syllable had finished falling from his lips, and Tony whined, shaking his head and tugging at his bonds once more. “Sir please, you can’t, you can’t—”
“So it’s ranked in order of intensity? 1 being most submissive, 10 being most dominant. Switches are between 4 and 7, with their number reflecting whether they are more inclined towards dominance or submission. But how’s that measured?” Bruce makes a pinching and twisting motion with his hand, and the OCS chart is minimized.
“We’ll ease our way into it. In the next couple of days I’ll provide prompts, or we can discuss potential options. For today, I’d like you to write ‘I asked for help when I needed it.’ And then I’d like you to try to remember that you can in fact
“Sorry, but despite the rumours that might be floating around, I’m not actually a mind-reader. I can give you a couple of suppositions and a recommendation, but that’s my best offer.”
Clint pushed. He found a submissive’s buttons, sometimes ones they didn’t even know they had, and he pressed away at them with what often presented like thoughtless glee. Tony had subbed for the guy enough to know, now, that Clint’s Domination style was actually the farthest thing from thoughtless. He usually enjoyed the challenge of sceneing with Clint, who didn’t seem to fear or regret the darker, sharper edges of Tony the way some of the others did.
“So beyond making it voluntary, how would you prevent the kinds of abuse people were concerned about when they wrote these laws?”
“Was about the only thing we could do without bickering there at first,” Clint added ruefully. Phil wrote down their latest supposition and added a question mark next to it.
What the hell could Domen want to talk about that would require these kinds of precautions? Curiosity and dread were competing for primacy in Steve’s mind, but regardless of which won out, there was no way he could turn back now. He nodded, and Domen sighed with something that sounded like regret. She really didn’t want to do this.
Tony panics about having his blood taken for reasons that might not make sense if you haven't read chapter six of the Ask Strange replies
“What if you’re a True, you mean?” He nodded, and his Dad threw his head back and laughed again, already turning his attention back to his work. “Boy, you got nothin’ to worry about. There hasn’t been a Stark that’s been anything but a middle-scale Switch in decades.”
“I mean, my counterpart died. Or worse, he didn’t and he went along with some kind of long-con undoubtedly thought up by Fury. So either way, I think I got the worst end of things here.” Clint took issue with this, claiming the fate of ending up on a farm with a secret wife and kids worse than death, and the more they bickered and complained about their alternative selves, the more they drank.
“He’s really, really fine. He voluntarily came to me for a check-in on his day off just to make sure he was as fine as he thought he was. And he was excited to spend the night playing video games and drinking way too much Red Bull before, as he put it, Rhodes ‘gets his hooks in him tomorrow.’” Even Natasha had to laugh, but Steve couldn’t help but notice that she still didn’t seem entirely comforted by the reassurance. Bruce picked up on it too. “You could always go spend the evening with him. Just because we don’t play on Thursdays doesn’t mean we can’t be around him as long as he’s up for company. And we’ve got plenty of hands here, we’ll have no problem finishing off everything that can be done tonight.”
The only way that Tony was made aware of time continuing to pass was the slow expansion and contraction of Bruce’s chest and abdomen. In any other scenario Tony would have skipped the foreplay and gone in for the kiss by now; he already had so many ready-made cheesy lines about wanting a taste of something other than finger-foods, it was basically a crime to not use them. But he couldn’t quite make himself close the small gap between them. It felt…disrespectful, somehow, of Bruce’s Dominance, and the effect it had managed to have on Tony despite his lack of a corresponding orientation. So he waited, clenched his fists to try to avoid the temptation of providing his aching cock with the relief of at least some friction. Bruce’s eyes, still all pupil, tracked Tony’s movements, unapologetically observing, and the thought of having all of that genius-level intellect brought to bear on him, having Bruce learn Tony’s body and mind with the same slow, methodical precision he did anything else… it was devastatingly hot. (It had come as a surprise, at first, to learn that Bruce was classified as the highest level Dominant in the Tower after Steve, but now Tony could almost feel the force of it, orientation or not.)
“Let’s eat and talk a little less formally for now, alright?” Tony shrugged, trying to make the whole thing look as inconsequential as it should have felt. He took a large, crunchy bite of his breakfast when Bruce handed him a bowl, just to show how unbothered he was. “How are you this morning? Does it feel nice to be back?” Tony shrugged. “The house is beautiful. It’s been a long time since we made it out here.”
The echo of Sunset’s earlier words combined with the vulnerability of the posture…that was probably about when things started to go downhill. But Tony wanted fiercely for this to go well for he and Steve. He’d put the guy through so much just to get here in the first place, for fuck’s sake, the least Tony could do was make it through a relatively simple scene without freaking out.
escape this situation if he wanted to was enough to take Tony from overwhelming panic to just plain anxiety, which was a huge bonus. Tony could still
“I’m sure Cap and I can avoid each other until everyone else gets back, Jay. Nothing to worry about. Rhodey, on the other hand, does he really think he’s going to make it between those two buildings? His shoulder artillery is way too broad. JARVIS patch me thr—”
Tony had seemed to love being fucked from the bottom the night they’d scened together, and Steve did have a special affection for making a sub feel powerless in a position where they might typically expect to have more control. So once Tony was ready, Steve got a solid grip on his hips and pistoned upwards, hard enough to make both of them yelp. Tony tried halfheartedly to rise up, to ride Steve the way the position practically invited, but Steve chuckled and patted his rear.
“The entire team, including James, is also going to be in attendance as long as that’s alright with you.” Tony gasped in mock outrage and spun around to point an accusatory finger at Clint.
For the first time in weeks, Tony woke and entered the living area of the penthouse to find it empty. The signs that the team had been there recently were everywhere, including the kitchen counter where someone had left a full bowl of washed fruit and what looked like homemade mini-scones. (It had to have been Bruce, he’d taken to leaving snacks out all over the Tower lately.) But there was no one watching TV on the couch or drinking orange juice out of the carton or offering to fetch Tony his first cup of coffee.
“Okay, well good to have an unambiguous sense of where you’re at. Now, I brought that up in advance partly because Bucky is going to be taking part in the scene. He’s not one hundred percent certain he’s ready even to be Domming alongside someone who’s hurting you. For today we’d prefer he didn’t have to leave, so the plan is for us to switch over to something else if that becomes necessary.”
“Girl, you seem pretty awesome and I’m glad that Peter has you in his life, but no way are you gonna talk me into calling anything I’ve put into my own body ‘Thor Juice.’ You got it?”
“You guys don’t—I’m not a delicate sugarcookie for fuck’s sake!” Thor instantly withdrew his hand, taking the pillow with it. Tony’s head jerked awkwardly and landed smushed, face-first, into Rhodey’s arm pit. And just like that, silence draped the room again like a heavy canopy. (Well, it couldn’t have lasted anyway, this whole display of team unity.) Not wanting to allow things to disintegrate further, Tony made a valiant attempt to slither out of Rhodey’s arms. They tightened in response, almost as if by reflex, and then fell away just as suddenly as Thor’s pillow. Tony was up and halfway toward the elevator before he realized JARVIS might not let him into the workshop.
I continue to live for your comments, kudos, and questions. You're all wonderful, and I absolutely adore hearing your thoughts on where the story is heading! There will also be Dr. Strange responses posted tomorrow, so let me know if you have questions you want me to pass on to the Doc!
“Oh good, I thought you’d be gone longer, Agent. Listen, I think we need to remove the right shoulder-plate entirely, it’ll be a lot less aggravation to just bin it and since Rhodey’s not here to bitch I can add in some—oh.” Without being asked, JARVIS softened the music to a dull roar as Tony and Steve stared at each other. “Look, Cap, if you’re here to yell again do you think you could—”
This did mean that by the time anyone else was up and moving around the penthouse, Tony had already put the finishing touches on the SI mission statement as well as several project proposals. Steve walked in, took one look at the haze off screens surrounding Tony like thick New York smog and sighed softly. Tony quickly went on the offensive.
“So you crashed the fighter jet, not because there was any imminent harm to public safety, but because, and I’m quoting here, ‘the would-be pilot was a twatwaffle.’” Leaning against the wall with her back pressed against the door, Talia’s only reply was a smirk at hearing Maria utter the word ‘twatwaffle.’ Undoubtedly that had been her entire aim in placing such a ridiculous turn of phrase in her statement to begin with. “This would be the part where you elaborate, where you try to convince Director Rogers, Agent Coulson and myself that there’s some crucial information missing from the report, that you didn’t just willfully destroy the property of the American military because some jacked-up private with an attitude pissed you off.”
“Yes, Clint.” The hand dropped back to his cock at once, that same loose, possessive hold from before. In seconds, Tony was on his way to more than half hard.
“Oh good, you’re here! I broke a thing. It’s a small thing, really, nothing to worry about. Personally I wouldn’t have even mentioned it, but Masdee has a real thing about honesty. She once made me go back in and change my time card when I had clocked in at work because she caught me playing that TsumTsum game on my phone.”
“I get that, maybe more’n anyone else here. Steve and I…it took a long time, after I came back here, for him to really accept that I wasn’t the guy he knew. Even longer to believe that I didn’t want to be. I wouldn’t wish what happened to me on anyone, and I’m sorry for all the people I hurt, but I ain’t got the time or the inclination to hate all the ways I had to change and adapt to survive. The Soldier is as much a part of me as anything else, and he’s done a hell of a job keeping me and the people I love safe over the years. I ain’t sorry I’m not just James Barnes anymore, and you shouldn’t be sorry you’re not the other Tony.”
“They’re meeting tonight, and if you do want to come it’s actually a good time. They wanted me to stop by and offer some suggestions on their technique, hence the footage, so I could introduce you. If you want.”
—I’m a real fucking submissive, dammit, I can kneel even without whatever biological shit everyone else has here that make their joints into rubber!”
“Mmm. You like that sweetheart?” Tony nodded, but Steve made a little tutting noise. “Nope. You want it, you’ll ask for it. Just because I’m helping you out a bit doesn’t mean you’re not participating here just like I told you you would be. Say ‘more, please Sir’ if you want the crop again.” Tony tried for a matter of seconds to resist it, tried to just focus on the toy and on being good for Steve, but it was a doomed effort. He begged just as Steve told him to, and felt the immediate lick of the crop on his other thigh.
He did open it, to find it soft red velvet lining. A cylindrical stand sat square in the centre, and the housing unit he’d handed to his Dominants the day prior was nestled on top of it, covering everything else with warm blue light. Around the stand itself was nestled a collar. After imagining this moment for so long, Tony’s first, ridiculous impulse was to close his eyes, afraid that if he looked too hard for too long, this beautiful, perfect moment might turn to dust. It was Steve, like always, who called him home.
With JARVIS’s rather reluctant help (the AI was definitely another resident of the Tower who was pissed at him, and the team had long since learned that that never boded well given his near-complete control of every aspect of the Tower), Steve tracked Tony down a couple hours later. He was in his…the shop, of course, completing what looked like some heavy-duty upgrades to the War Machine armour.
…that was enough to make tears sting at Tony’s eyes for just a second. (There was always a way to do things wrong, and he almost always succeeded at finding it.) He closed them, pretending it was in response to the bit of brownie Bruce offered next, then let them stay closed when he found it somehow easier than figuring out what to do as he watched the food slowly moving towards his face. Eventually they developed a rhythm. True to his word, Bruce never tried to rush or hurry things along. He didn’t get upset when it turned out Tony didn’t like the hummus they had in the Tower, or when Tony asked for more of the cereal milk pastry. He didn’t mind when Tony’s lips or tongue lingered to retrieve the last remnants of favoured items from his fingers. He answered Tony if he asked a question, but otherwise allowed the silence of the room to be accompanied only by the gentle sounds of their shared meal.
Content Notes: The May/Peter/Tony conversation is emotionally intense, but I don't think there's anything taggable in it.
He looked back down at the collar and carefully unbuckled it to get a closer look. At first glance it seemed simple, almost plain: a thick strip of dark brown leather that perfectly matched the staining on the box. Inside, on the part of the collar that would sit against his neck, the leather was embossed. His fingers slid over the odd assortment of hexagons, lines and circles for what was (for Tony at least) an embarrassingly long period of time before he understood. They were molecules.
“…doctor patient confidentiality?” May was not in any sense a doctor, but as she suspected this was a point in her favour, she took a swig straight out of the bottle and then handed it back to Tony. He immediately followed suit and then sighed. “I…it’s hard for me to see the others around Peter, and around you to some extent. Especially Steve.”
Did I mention that you all are some of the kindest, most thoughtful and fun readers ever? Because you are. Your comments and kudos make every chance I have to open the file for this story a joy.
“Aww, just bring him here,” Steve chuckled, smiling fondly as Tony was deposited into his lap. “Hey there sweetheart. Let’s get you all prepped and ready.” It was nothing he wouldn’t have said normally; if anything, he was a little extra gentle with his tone, as if Tony were something fragile and in need of coddling. It built on the dynamic Bruce and Clint had already established without straying out of Steve’s own comfort zone, and judging from the way Tony shuddered, it worked for him too. Steve slid two fingers easily inside him, taking plenty of time stretching Tony out. “That’s it, honey, just relax for me. Gonna get you all sorted and feeling good, give you everything you need.”
“Tony’s job today is to observe. We’re mainly going to use TV for that, because we can’t go outside so it’s the closest we can get to an on-the-ground view of everyday life. Try to pay particular attention to social norms or everyday things in the programming or even in ads that aren’t the same as your universe, Tony; it’ll give us a clearer idea of where we’ll need to devote the most time when you’re closer to needing to perform this role for real.” Watching TV felt weirdly anticlimactic given what Tony had come into the room expecting, but the logic behind the decision was sound; it was the same way recent migrants often learned the language of their new countries, after all, and orientation was essentially a new embodied language for him. And it was definitely preferable to Nat pulling out a whip or something. He nodded in acknowledgement, but couldn’t keep his eyes off of Phil, who was frozen in place, staring between Natasha and the plates in his hand. “However, in addition to needing a sense of how orientation in general functions, you’ll also have to get acclimated to the specific dynamics of the Tower. No one’s going to be explicitly sexual in front of you, Tony, and if there’s anything you’re ever uncomfortable witnessing you can always say so. But orientation…it really does effect most every aspect of our lives. There are things we need to stay well and safe and fulfilled, and it’s not realistic or sustainable in the long term to confine them only to private bedrooms.”
My own gift for Stark shall come in time, though I confess that it may be outside of even Amazon’s reach.
“Oh, she didn’t know. No one but Tony knew I was Spiderman then, and he promised to keep it that way and help me out with gear as long as I went with him.” Peter, still blissfully unaware that he’d said anything wrong at this point, made to take another drink of delicious, delicious Thor-juice (he’d started calling it this during stage one, much to MJ’s disgust). She yanked the bottle forcefully out of his hands.
It warmed something in Steve to see how willing both of them were to essentially interrupt their date for his sake and turn it into something at least semi-platonic. And God but it was tempting to agree; even the jealousy of watching Tony and Natasha’s flirtatious back-and-forth could end up being very much worth this opportunity to just spend time with them both, cocooned in the warmth and comfort of the Tower and the people he cared for.
“Alright sweetheart. I can see we have a ways to go.” And then Tony knew nothing at all beyond the white-hot streak of pain where the strap connected with his ass for the first time.
Steve didn’t use the crop this time. Tony was beyond needing that kind of distraction now, and he worked his way through the series of toys with no room for any thought or concern beyond making it to Steve this time, and surviving the oversensitivity that felt like being on fire from the inside out. By the time he reached the damn fourth dildo again, Steve looked almost as impatient as Tony felt; he had undone his slacks and slid them far enough down his hips to slide his cock out. It was hard and deeply red, and when Tony reflexively licked his lips, Steve gripped it as if he was barely in control of himself.
“I mean, you don’t have to, and I definitely wouldn’t advise using kinetically reinforced web-fluid for an average fight or something—”
Thankfully, Jordan got his feet back under him fairly quickly after that, speaking confidently and passionately about his experience in the SHIELD scholarship program and his goals for future projects; he showed a particular interest in the communications side of things, and happily shared several compelling thoughts about future public outreach programs. To Steve’s mind, what was equally impressive was Jordan’s complete absence of shame about the fact that he wanted to use his mind to SHIELD’s benefit rather than weaponizing his fit, muscular frame toward the spying end of things. For all that the old bravado had long since fallen to the wayside, there was still something about Captain America that brought it out in some Doms. (Yet another reason it was important that he meet all their potential incoming agents.)
“Oh for—that was one time!” They bickered pleasantly all the way to the fifth floor of Hudson Yards, where Bucky steered them into a restaurant called Kawi. The interior was warm woods and soft lighting, nothing like the chaos Steve associated with mall dining, and he caught the scent of a warm, thick stew on one of the tables they passed. Bucky arched a brow as he held out Steve’s chair for him, and Steve rolled his eyes.
Sam smiled, with far too much knowing and gentleness to fit her admittedly unflattering and largely un-nuanced view of what superheroes other than Peter were capable of being.
“Dunno. Never really.” And then he stopped talking before he managed to make himself sound any more pathetic. Bruce sighed and dug into a small black duffle bag he’d brought with him, emerging with—“Should I also indicate any deep-seeded hang-ups I have regarding fuzzy socks?” Bruce smiled, the fond one that crinkled all the lines near his eyes and mouth, and then proceeded to pull Tony’s feet into his lap, undo the laces of his shoes and tug them off, along with his black silk socks.
“Course you haven’t! Nor should you have.” He chortled again, and Tony fought very hard not to cringe. He didn’t even
