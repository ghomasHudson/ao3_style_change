Clint wasn't a whore. He really wasn't. //Right? Right.// It was just damned near impossible to ignore how close Scott was, and how fucking hot the man was. //So maybe I do get around a little,// he admitted to himself, closing the distance between them. He couldn't really bring himself to care when Scott was so willing. Clint didn't even bother tugging off his archery glove before tangling his hand in Scott's hair and dragging him into a commanding kiss. "Well, when a good, hot fuck falls in my lap, I'm not the kind to pass it up," he breathed.
It didn't take much to figure out that Clint was upset. "Nat?" he guessed. There weren't many things or people that got under Clint's skin the way Natasha did. Coulson was still working hard not to look as hurt as he felt by the obvious brush-off, by Clint's easy dismissal of the whole thing. //Fun. Of course. That's it.// Even the vague hope that Clint might be game again wasn't really helping because it definitely wasn't what he'd envisioned. He'd wanted more. He'd thought… //And that's why you're not supposed to think about it. Stop.// "Is everything okay?" He reluctantly peeled himself up off the floor and attempted to look entirely steady on his feet, as if he hadn't just had the best blow job of his life from a guy who he would very much have liked to be going home with.
"Or the log cabin and the elevator," Steve mused with a hint of a smile. "I mean, we have to get downstairs to start the vacation, right? Elevator rides can run a little long when there are technical issues that I'm sure you and Jarvis is more than capable of creating." He sounded entirely earnest and not in the least bit devious, but the light in Steve's eyes said otherwise. "And I almost didn't say nice. I almost said 'swell,' but the last time I did, Clint didn't stop teasing me for two weeks."
"Good. Because if you keep holding back secrets, I'm gonna get some of that truth serum from Fitz-Simmons and stab you with it," Clint threatened, smiling as Phil burrowed into his neck. "I still have to hunt down your ticklish spots and find out what embarrasses you most. Other than Nat announcing that the two of you got busy on a mission." He thought a moment. "Oh! And I have to figure out what makes you blush. Like really makes you blush. Uncontrollably."
Steve couldn't really help it - he all but screamed Tony's name. That one stroke combined with Tony's hand on his cock almost finished him that fast, and Steve only barely hung back from the edge of release. Already he was dripping, precum smearing against the leather as Tony drove into him. "I can't... that's... it's like that because I can't get enough," Steve admitted without hesitation. "Never enough." He was pretty sure they could spend a week doing nothing but having sex and taking breaks to hydrate enough to keep going and he still wouldn't have had enough. He was pretty sure he'd still be begging Tony to fuck him harder or spreading the man open so he could return the favor. "Never gonna be enough."
Sif threw back her shoulders and met the golden eyes of Heimdall without flinching. "I seek passage to Midgard."
Logan didn't seem to hear the words, shifting to let his cock press against the other man's entrance a bit more insistently. As he did so, a small bottle of lube bounced off the side of his head.
Clint hadn't missed Coulson wincing, and his brow furrowed as he watched the agent gingerly settle back into his seat. "Sleep'd be good. I need to catch up," he decided, watching Coulson carefully. "You might want to swing by medical while you're at it." The archer was starting to feel the aches of his own injuries, but most were superficial. A few small nicks over his eyebrow and on his cheek from broken glass, and a few not so small bruises. Realizing his own injuries drew his attention to some of the more visible bumps and bruises on Coulson. Grabbing the medical kit from under his seat, Clint cracked it open. "You've got a few cuts; there was a lot of glass flying around back there," he observed, rummaging around until he found what little gauze and disinfectant was left. "Man... always run out of gauze and bandaids first," he muttered as he started dabbing a fairly sizable laceration on Coulson's cheek, his free hand on the back of the agent's neck to keep him still.
Clint smiled faintly, standing. "Yeah, guess so. Doesn't feel like anything broken, but what the hell." He glanced at the hammer, which seemed to be practically begging for attention from its unceremonious spot in the forward corner of the plane. The archer shifted uneasily, glancing at Phil. "So... how do we get that thing to research without getting close enough to touch it? I'm betting Fury doesn't have any ten foot tongs laying around." In spite of his casual tone, Clint was internally a mess. Part of him wanted to pick the thing up and carry it, and the other part was so terrified of losing himself in the artifact that he wanted to bolt from the plane and go hide in his room.
Coulson sheathed the taser at once and moved to the man’s side. He was damn good at reading people. Even Natasha could only fool him about half the time. Barnes wasn’t faking it. He put a hand on the man’s shoulder. “Breathe. Slow in, slow out. Can you stand up? I’d like to help you to the infirmary now.” Even if Bucky attacked him again, Coulson knew it was vitally important to get him treatment. For all he knew physical pain was as good a trigger as anger. He didn’t particularly want to find out. “We need to get you looked at.”
In that moment, Phil found himself vacillating wildly between appreciating Clint's honesty and hating that it was an established fact that Clint loved someone else. It was one thing thinking it and another thing hearing it, apparently. He took the cup and poured them each some coffee to cover for the fact that he was buying time to think. He could feel the shred of hope that he'd been clinging to slipping away and finally had to let it go. "I think that maybe... that maybe as long as you're in love with someone and the guys you're with are there to kill time, it doesn't matter all that much what I want." It wasn't a cop out so much as a last ditch attempt to protect himself. He'd given away too much as it was, and Coulson couldn't bring himself to give away how much he cared when he knew it couldn't change anything. "That doesn't mean you can't still be here for coffee or to crash on the couch or that we can't feed the ducks, but I think that until something bigger changes, that's all I have to give."
Scott's voice broke in over the comm, "He's about a quarter of a mile due west of you based on what security cameras in the area are saying."
Fitz looked equally pleased. In fact he was too excited to remember that he was supposed to be jealous of Bruce and instead waved the man over to point excitedly at the screen. "Jarvis has been filtering through the information from the suit, and it worked! All of it! Well, most of it. Alright, so technically Mr. Stark was dead for a few seconds, but then the nanobots kicked, and look at this!"
That actually made sense. Steve let some of the tension drain from his shoulders and favored Tony with a smile. "I'd like us to be friends, so... let's go." Making friends with Tony would go a long way toward feeling like a real leader for the team. He'd felt strange being put in the position, but Fury had been insistent. He was the military man and certainly the most disciplined and loyal of the Avengers. That meant he was leader material whether he felt like it or not. As Nick had bluntly put it, "Knowing how to set up an iPhone doesn't have shit to do with leading a team."
Logan tugged his chest strap a little tighter. Too tight, really, but it wasn't like he was going to get a blister. "Don't see why we couldn't just land the friggin' thing," he grumbled under his breath. He knew, of course, that he could probably have hit the ground without a chute from a lot higher altitude and at worst come out with a headache. That didn't mean he felt any better about flinging himself out of a perfectly good airplane or having gotten on one in the first place. His thoughts were interrupted by a hard shove from behind that left him flopping head over heels for a few seconds before he finally regained his bearings and got hold of his chute release. In the process, he swore to himself he'd be killing Barton if Loki didn't do it first.
Despite the immediate vote down, Coulson couldn't help but feel grateful that Natasha had even put a vote in his direction. The Avengers required something less polished and less administrative than a SHIELD team of the normal variety might. "Barton has the most combat experience of anyone here that's still on the list, excepting Logan."
Clint nodded. Much as he wanted to beat Creed until the mutant begged for mercy, he wanted to be away from him more. He let the two continue down the hallway, leaning lightly against Phil as they turned back toward the elevators. With the battle over and the hammer reassuringly clipped to his belt, Clint was feeling a little more level. "Well, he can't hurt us now," he remarked, though he wasn't sure if he was trying to reassure Phil or himself more.
"I'm not sure I'd let him hear you say that," Scott answered with a smirk as he took the beer. "He looks sharp enough to put you through a wall even if he couldn't compose an essay about it afterward. There are, frankly, times when I wonder if in our particular line of work it's not better to be a little dumb." //If you were too dim to have any idea what you were doing meant and how screwed you were in the long run, it had to be a lot more inspirational.// Scott had always gotten himself into trouble over-thinking. "Then again," he lifted the beer, "this is the great equalizer."
"I may have just been trying to make you look like that. Maybe." Steve couldn't help but laugh at the look on Tony's face. "A blow job might be a little obvious, but a hand job... if we're all drinking. Or it's just Nat and Clint." Somehow he doubted either one of them would bat an eyelash whether they knew what was going on or not. He knew nothing about their sex life and frankly didn't want to, but Steve had never taken them for vanilla one way or another. "If it's you, I can probably be persuaded to be flexible. A little bit. Sometimes. But you have to admit that public restrooms are pretty gross."
Logan's thoughts mirrored his lover's. He knew he'd likely hurt Scott, at least a little. The idea of taking Scott like this - all rough and raw and desperate - was too enticing to let him worry about a bit of discomfort. Already hard and ready, Logan guided himself to Scott's entrance, shifting his lover's weight to slowly ease him down onto his cock. He groaned out Scott's name, nuzzling the man's neck before pressing another commanding kiss to Scott's full lips.
Tony nodded, sitting up a little. He honestly hadn't trusted himself to make eye contact with Steve for a few moments. He didn't want to betray his uncertainty. It wasn't that he doubted Steve on any level, but Tony had a hard time believing any real relationship involving him had any kind of hope. Finally gathering his nerve, he looked up at Steve and offered him a smile, leaning up to peck a kiss onto his soft lips. "Thanks," he said. "You're my hero." The words were uttered a little more softly, without the usual snarky edge.
FYI, I'm going to ultimately break this baby into five parts. Part five is the unfinished part. The good news? Part 4 will be 32 chapters long as it currently stands.
Swallowing and brushing away the tears, Steve managed, "Help me get him back. The least that Loki owes him is a proper burial."
"What? This isn't fresh enough for you?" Scott threaded their fingers together and suggested, "We could head to Central Park." No one without a death wish was likely to try to jump Logan, which left him feeling pretty sure about the idea even with the darkness coming on. "Being around some trees and the illusion of nature sounds like fun."
"I have a feelin' they won't let 'er near them. I hear the Geneva Convention's not real popular in Russia," Logan said, smirking at the thought of her beating Piotr unmercifully. Hell, Logan himself would be tempted to do the same given the chance. He might even be tempted to hit Mystique, though battering women without provocation wasn't really his thing. He'd learned long ago that women weren't by any stretch the 'weaker sex,' but... well, he was a little old-fashioned, maybe.
“If nothing else, I think it’s a guarantee I’ve never had better company at a movie.” Steve was mindful to give Tony his space. No matter how relaxed the man seemed, Steve knew what he’d been through now. He’d seen the cracks in Tony’s normally flawless armor, and he wanted to avoid at all costs doing anything to make him retreat again. Even with those fears, however, Steve couldn’t miss the spring in Tony’s step and the gleam in his eyes. The excitement was infectious, and Steve happily sipped his coffee as the opening scrawl played across the screen.
"You will be when I'm through with you." He watched the woman's gaze narrow. "Your control is fantastic. Such a striking contrast... yes. A matched set." Loki lifted a golden orb. It hovered neatly over his hand and then flashed.
Scott knew he'd be a mess of bruises and hickeys the next day. The thought aroused him more than troubled him, though. Scott groaned at the thought. He'd be marked. He opened his mouth to tell Logan how good it felt and only succeeded in gasping as Logan drove hard into him. Every thrust slammed hard into just the right spot. It was a perfect kind of torture. Release loomed, and Scott just managed to groan, "So close," as he fought the urge to hold back for just a moment longer.
It was a typical knock-down, drag-out argument to get Tony to sleep that ultimately did end in threats of taser application and Phil removing everything that used a wireless signal and wasn't bolted down from the room. It was another hour of laying there, awake, turning ideas over in his head before he finally drifted off. In spite of his warnings to Coulson, Tony woke around 8:30 and laid there another thirty minutes before he finally got up and started making himself human. He was wheeling himself into the living area just as Coulson walked in with food and coffee. "I woke myself up. Food can go on the table. I don't like being handed things."
Loki smiled in return, though he knew Victor didn't see it. The man had some sense of discretion. He liked that, appreciated it. Loki rose languidly and took a long shower before he donned his clothing again and headed for the cells. He definitely needed to have a long discussion with Natasha Romanov.
Bruce watched the pair, a smile playing at his lips. He glanced at Tony as the man sipped at his coffee. "You realize, of course, you just made their day, right?" he asked quietly.
Jemma watched the video play, unable to keep from smiling as Captain Rogers appeared on the feed, all strong jaw and certain stance. There was no sound, but it didn't take much imagination or the field reports to play it out. "That would make sense. For all we know he has five broken ribs and a bloody nose right now and we just don't see them." It begged the question of why Loki hadn't simply tried to escape by being someone else. "He could have walked right out or surrendered as a member of the Brotherhood. He could have done this a thousand different ways," Jemma said slowly before looking up to Bruce, "but he told us the truth."
If it hadn't been so dangerous, Phil would have taken the hammer. He wanted it the hell away from his lover. He wanted Clint safe and sound and not touching artifacts that might be tearing him apart from the inside out. "Look at it this way - maybe we can talk Logan into letting you take a few swings at Creed before he gets debriefed."
Clint leaned in to Phil's touch, eyes closing for a moment. It was a little frightening, knowing he meant so much to Phil. The idea that he might one day slip up and get killed on a mission didn't scare him; the idea of hurting someone he cared for so badly was utterly terrifying. His gaze flicked up. "That was a year ago," he murmured, his hand reaching up to cover the back of Phil's as he turned his head to press a kiss to the palm. He smiled gently, "How long have you worried about me like this?" He wasn't sure what to think. It was intimidating to know someone cared so deeply for him. He hadn't had a family to speak of growing up, and knowing that someone cared about him above and beyond simple friendship or as a teammate was completely foreign to him.
"No, I suppose nothing worse than usual," Loki agreed. He couldn't keep some humor from creeping into his expression despite the situation. He didn't know if anything apart from his skin would change, but the idea of it terrified him. It wasn't vanity so much as the idea of losing any parts of himself. Loki had learned long before that the only person he had to trust in the universe was precisely the man slowly changing before his eyes. To describe it as uncomfortable was selling things short by a great deal. "I don't think that frost giants eat people if that's any comfort to you. Your virtue may still be in peril, but I think your vital organs should rest easy."
"Not to worry, sir. We have plenty of friends to help." She giddily pointed out a robot arm already reaching out to seat the hammer properly on the pedestal.
Bruce looked at Tony askance as they boarded the plane. "Did... did you inject yourself with nanomachines?"
"That reminds me…” Even in the midst of her own grief, Peper managed to sound in control. Steve was reminded in that moment how much like Coulson she was at times and felt a pang of guilt that Tony wasn’t the only loss on their roster after the battle. “It's no secret that Stark Industries has been my very special problem for awhile," Pepper ventured, "but I looked the paperwork over last night. The rest? The Tower and any money not tied to the company? That's yours, Steve. Apparently Tony had Jarvis update his will at some point."
The idea of food turned his stomach, but Scott nodded anyway. "A banana sounds good," he allowed. It had hurt getting out of bed, and it hurt even more thinking about putting right everything that was wrong with him. The hangover was really the least of his problems. Scott remained almost completely silent while Logan got the coffee ready. He grabbed a banana and managed to get through both it and the coffee without throwing up. Only then did Scott finally ask, "So I feel like shit, but I still... what I said last night, what I did... I meant that. It's not like I gave up on it this morning."
It took a little thought for Steve to find the answer, but eventually, he shook his head. “I miss my mom. I miss things with Bucky when it was just us out in Brooklyn, but I don’t miss being just this side of dead most of the time and not…” Again Steve fought to find precisely the words he wanted to describe it, his fork idly scraping a pattern into the sauce on his plate. “I couldn’t do what needed to be done. No one would even let me try. I might miss people and places and some good times, but I can’t say I’ll ever miss being useless.”
Scott wasted not a moment in leaning in to kiss Logan soundly. The day had been downright joyful overall, and he was buzzed from it in addition to being exhausted from the tension that led up to the good parts and the lingering uncertainty about whether they'd manage to get Barton back into his right mind without breaking him. "Dinner? I'm not really hungry, but I'll sit with you while you eat. Or we can snack in your room. Or... just..." He let his forehead fall against Logan's shoulder with a sigh. "Let's be not with people, huh? I'm tired of people."
Fury looked back at Coulson. "If you can, pull Summers aside and see what you can get from him. Discreetly."
"It's... it's familiar, yeah," Scott agreed with a glance at Logan. "Rain check on that dinner?" he asked the other man with a smirk before following Natasha out into the hallway.
"Bruce is ki... ind of a cool dude, too," Tony said, his voice catching as Loki's hand ran down his arm. It was all he could do not to recoil completely, but he couldn't stop himself from shifting the limb away from the god's touch. His heart rate picked up, and Tony wasn't sure if it was fear, revulsion, or the fact that it was kind of enticing that made him want to pull away. //You're just desperate for comfort,// he assured himself. He latched onto the comment about Creed and brought all of his snark to bear in hopes of keeping himself calm. "Yeah, you know, Bruce is house trained, though. Big plus," he said, swallowing hard. It had been a lot easier to do what Loki wanted when he could easily pretend it was Steve fucking him into the mattress. Tony wasn't sure how well he'd hold up when it was just Loki being himself.
"You bet," Tony said, the stress immediately melting away from his features as he took Steve's hand in his own and moved toward the elevator. Back in his suite, Tony pulled his lover into a long, gentle kiss, smiling a little as he drew away. "You know, it feels pretty amazing holding you. You're pretty huggable," he said gently. Jerking his head toward the bar, he smiled faintly. "Think we could use a little wine?"
They made it to the lab without incident, though Coulson was told firmly and more than once by different agents that the cuffs had to stay on. He didn't like it, but he didn't protest. It made sense. It did. They arrived in the lab to find Steve entering a beat after, pushing Tony in a wheelchair with one hand on the man's shoulder as if he was sure Tony would bolt out at the first opportunity otherwise, which was probably true. "Natasha wanted us to make sure that everything was going well."
"You don't have to," Logan said, a little faster and louder than he'd intended. He cleared his throat and shrugged. "I mean, I get it. You obviously don't want to. You can keep usin' the couch." //Or the bed. Bed's fine, too,// he thought, but didn't quite have the nerve to say it. It'd been more reassuring than he cared to admit to have Scott there when he woke. Then again, the man was his one link to the closest thing he'd found to home in a long time. //Helluva link,// he reflected. "Coulson's the one you'd wanna talk to, though. I mean, if you want your own place, or if you wanna tell 'im you're on my couch. I mean, he'll keep his mouth shut about whatever assumptions he makes."
Steve hesitated, but Tony obviously wanted him to go first. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes and instead confessed, "I have. It was... different then. Had to keep things quiet. But I have." Instinct told him to look around the room and make sure no one had overheard, but the naked truth was that no one in the room would care. Suspecting it was too intimate a thought but wanting to clarify just the same, Steve ventured, "When I'm attracted to someone, I'm attracted to them. Gender just... doesn't really matter."
The gesture uncurled a knot of tension from Phil's body. He reached out and took Clint's hand with obvious pride. He was grateful to be walking through the place hand in hand with the most handsome guy there. A band took to one of the main stages, and they were ten different shades of amateurish, but it wasn't all bad. "What would you get?" Phil asked out of the blue only to get a blank stare from Clint. "If you were going to get a tattoo, what would you get?"
The dirty talk and the sight of Scott completely lost in pleasure was too much for Logan's control. He growled his pleasure, hooking his arms under Scott's shoulders and pounding into him. Well beyond rationality, he fucked Scott mercilessly, biting at the man's throat and jaw as he lay claim to his lover. His desire for the man was indescribably powerful. He hadn't realized how badly he'd wanted Scott until the man had pounced on him the night before, and even then he'd well underestimated the effect the man could have on him.
"Body hair and a tendency to scratch yourself in public?" Tony asked, finishing off his Scotch in one gulp and ordering another.
"Mmm hmm." Coulson knew the difference. Clint could fake his tone, but he couldn't really do much about his heart rate. Still, he was willing to play along. It was hard to resist doing a little something anyway. Phil let his lips brush against the shell of Clint's ear. "Well, far be it from me to keep you from sleeping on a beautiful afternoon like this. Even if I do enjoy hearing you talk." He actually did. There were missions where the steady stream of conversation from Clint had helped keep him sane. "Just going to keep kissing your ear, though. Hope you don't mind."
"I will," the agent agreed. As much as he wanted there to be nothing wrong, Coulson wasn't stupid, and he wouldn't risk anyone's lives if it came down to it. If Clint had to act, then he had to act. "If there really is something wrong and he knows, I think he'd tell us." Coulson certainly hoped so, or the bridges they'd been building with both men were for nothing.
"Slow," Tony decided without hesitation, then let out a long, low moan as Loki's fingers worked him open. The illusion was off on a lot of levels, but Tony did a decent job of not giving a damn. He wanted to forget all the fucked up things going on right then, and it wasn't hard to convince himself to do so. He squirmed against the sheets, making soft sounds of pleasure as skilled fingers worked him open. He started to ask to face the other man, but hesitated at even the subconscious thought of such intimacy with the illusion Loki had generated.
Tony arched and gasped at the feeling of Loki's nails digging into him, but he surprised himself by moaning as the pain and pleasure mingled. His hands moved to rest on the god's hips, and he rocked up into the clenching heat with a shaky moan. "Yes... need it," he breathed, pulling himself up to kiss Loki's throat, his hands sliding up the god's lithe back as he nipped harshly at the god's bluish skin.
"I'll put in the call," Fury agreed. He couldn't say Xavier was a buddy of his, but the man cared about his people and about humanity in general. Saving the world ranked above making friends. "Captain Rogers, until we know how this thing Fitz-Simmons cooked up is going, I want you here.t."
Clint's jaw tensed, but he said nothing, nodding once and flicking a glance to Phil and Nat before placing his collapsed bow on his back and moving for the door.
Simmons was startled to see that Tony's eyes were red, and he honest-to-god looked as if he'd been crying. She felt her blood run cold but tried to smile brightly. "Right, then!" She offered Fury an even shakier smile, nerves taking over from more specific worry as she and Fitz went back and forth. Somehow even when they should have been tripping over each other, it all flowed into a flawless if often too specific presentation of precisely what the gun could do. "There you have it, sir. Of course, there... well, there is the back up plan." Simmons looked to Tony, her expression suddenly strained.
Coulson remained at the man’s bedside while he slept off the drugs. He hoped that whatever Steve and Tony were talking about took awhile. For one thing Tony needed the company, for another he didn’t want to worry Steve before they knew anything at all.
"In that case..." Clint arched his head back and hooked his arm back behind Phil's head to tug him into another, deeper, more lingering kiss before he pulled away. Having his hair petted was soothing in the extreme, and if Nat wasn't weirded out by them kissing a little, he wasn't going to stop. He needed some kind of intimacy with the other man, chaste as it was. He hadn't missed the way Phil had left ownership of the suite vague. The truth was, the archer hadn't had much inclination to go back to his own even before their abduction. Now, he couldn't imagine doing anything but staying with Phil.
"I don't know, honestly." He looked sheepish when he admitted, "In high school, I almost got the shield on my arm. In retrospect, it's better that I didn't." It was one thing having Steve know he was a bit of a fanboy, it would have been very different trying to explain the tattoo. And somehow he knew he would have ended up awkwardly explaining it whether Steve ever saw the damn thing or not. Certainly it lacked the emotional resonance of a proper memorial tattoo. The sentiment was sweet, the idea one that left Phil gently squeezing the other man's hand as they walked. "I tend to be indecisive about it. It's permanent." He gestured to the booths showcasing everything from fine art to jewelry to photos of the artist's work on skin. "How do you choose out of all this? That's why I like festivals and shows. I can enjoy all of it without having to decide."
Clint chuckled, grateful for the distraction of someone to talk to that he trusted. Steve and Tony were obviously preoccupied, and Darien was a good fuck, but he wasn't a teammate. "Well, I could try and do the 'strong, silent type' thing more often, but I'd hate for people to think I'm just another pretty face."
"Yeah, sounds good." Scott knew it was going to get silly and probably annoying if he followed Logan around all the time, but for the time being the man didn't seem to mind. "Lemme change." He availed himself at last of the clothing SHIELD had provided, choosing a dark t-shirt and jeans. Reluctantly he tossed Logan's shirt into the hamper. It was a security blanket. Scott was smart enough to understand that. Letting go still felt like crap. He emerged in Logan's sitting area dressed and ready to go. "Now, food?" He was struck by the urge to thank Logan for his kindness again but refrained. It sounded like a broken record already. "So who's this Coulson guy?"
Clint flinched involuntarily at the sudden touch, but it did help ground him more firmly back into reality. Eyes still a little wild and heart still racing, he shook his head. "Just... just a nightmare," he murmured, finally pushing himself up from the floor. "We were taking care of the thing with Scott, and Logan..." He trailed off. Coulson was a good friend. The image of him getting brutally murdered was hard enough to get out of Clint's head; talking about the dream seemed too much like inviting it to become reality. Trying to change the subject, he asked, "How long was I out?"
"Of course. We can meet in the professor's office. I'm sure he'll want to hear what you have to say as well. I'm Jean Grey."
"We've dealt with worse." Carefully Coulson pushed himself up to stand again. It hurt like hell, but he was at least starting to feel more in control of himself if not the situation. "I know I can't exactly ask you to step into the next room, but I need to get cleaned up." And assess the damage as best he could, but that didn't really need to be said when he didn't really want to think about it. He waited until Clint got the hint before making his way over to the sink. The discarded shreds of his shirt were useful for the process, at least. There wasn't as much blood as he'd worried there would be but more than enough to bring up fears of things like infection in addition to the pain that would almost certainly get worse before it got better. He didn't feel better by the time he made his way back over to Clint, but at least he felt cleaner. Leaning back against the wall, he reached for Clint's hand. "I think I'll live."
"Well, there might be one or two. We need to get the mean, green rage machine back. And I think it might be a little impolite to leave Magneto here to wear out his welcome."
"Why Captain Rogers, you really are a gentleman, aren't you?" Good natured mirth danced in Tony's warm eyes as he smiled at Steve. They climbed off of the couch and headed out with some reluctance.  He gave Steve a gentle nudge before linking their arms together. "Lead on."
Tony sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. "Alright. Alright, okay," he said, taking a deep breath. He wondered if it was really a progress update or if the good director actually had a mission for them. His eyes flicked anxiously to Steve before he could stop himself. He could see the well-controlled fear in the blonde's bright blue eyes as well. He wasn't sure if he was ready to actually deal with the idea of building the gun and using it. It was, in fact, the first time Tony Stark was not all that anxious to try out a new invention. Hands he just managed to keep from shaking nervously pulled Steve close. "Hey... It'll be alright. Hulk's gonna smash, Wolverine's gonna kill Loki, and I'll fly around making smartass remarks," he said, quirking a smile he didn't really feel.
Clint barely realized Creed was moving before he was hauled roughly to his feet. He had to fight back another wave of nausea as he was dragged to the front of the cell. One of Victor's hands held him roughly by the hair while the feral mutant undid his cuffs only to latch them to the bars of the cell.
Biting back a significantly more graphic remark, Tony managed a relatively civil, "Uh, no... different anatomy. Next question."
"So, what you're telling me is, I shouldn't've been staring at her cleavage." When Coulson gave him 'the look', he held up his hands. "I'm kidding. And you're weirdly good at the 'dad' look. Just so you know." He sighed as he leaned back in his seat. "You know, I have to give you credit. Not many guys would walk up to gods and telepaths and talk to them like it was a completely normal thing."
"If he does, we'll stop him then." Coulson paused. "Just in case the voices in your head go both ways, I think it's important that he be aware that we don't intend to leave any loose ends this time." He lifted a folder. "I have paperwork to do. Enjoy your stay." Even with his blood pressure skyrocketing, the agent managed an apparently casual smile as he turned and walked out of the room. They needed to find Loki, and they needed to find him fast.
"Oddly enough, polite I can do. My manners are impeccable. I just have a tendency to enjoy..." Loki searched for the proper way to say it. "I enjoy stirring things up. When the surface of the water is too calm, I find it frustrating. I want to see what's underneath, so I throw a stone in." He inclined his head. "You're not so different, you've just been more judicious. Smaller scale chaos. I think I can learn to enjoy that. I hope that I can. Thankfully for you, I'm also rather terrible at transparency, so you've no need to worry over your secrets." Loki smiled and leaned in a bit closer. "Would you like to hear one of mine in return? An insurance policy of sorts?"
"Sorry," Scott answered, sounding every bit as miserable as he felt. "I..." He felt like a toddler coming into his parents' bedroom, but he couldn't stop himself from confessing, "I couldn't sleep. I kept having these... dreams... just... can I sleep in here? I'll take the floor, I don't care, just... I just need to be close to somebody right now." It hurt feeling so broken, and it hurt even more feeling that way around someone like Logan. Once upon a time the man would have pounced on the chance to expose such weakness. Now Scott didn't feel like he had anywhere else to turn.
Muttering to himself, Tony complied, climbing into the front passenger seat, much to the cabbie's apparent chagrin.
Tony stared at Loki for a moment as if trying to determine whether the god was messing with him. Realizing Loki seriously had no clue, he laughed a little. "No, heh. No. No, I'm not sure why he's still alive. Only Logan can do stuff like that. But I guess SHIELD managed to save him somehow." He smirked at his captor. "Maybe your aim is off."
"Both," Coulson agreed with a hint of a smile. He knew his own tolerance wasn't what it once was, and he preferred to enjoy a few beers for a slow burn instead of tossing back shots until he forgot his name. That went double considering Clint's thigh was settled comfortably against his own, and forgetting where and who he was would probably have resulted in some very uncomfortable moments. "We can save shots until we've decided we're completely finished actually being capable of speaking to one another."
"Acid round. Logan didn't like it much, either," Clint said, looking a little too satisfied with himself. Glancing at Phil, he muttered, "Might wanna shoot him for good measure..."
"Stark," Clint managed in a voice that made it clear he was exercising every last ounce of patience he had and that Tony was probably lucky he was wearing handcuffs, "we're just here to see if you two are making any progress." He could see the hammer behind a few layers of blast-proof glass, and he was fairly sure he could feel his hands itching.
The doctor barely had the question out before Clint was next to him. He followed closely and grabbed her hand as soon as it was in reach. One of the nurses was kind enough to drag up a stool for him, and he settled on it, never taking his eyes off the woman on the bed. "Nat?" he murmured, his heart in his throat. "Nat, it's me, Clint. Can you hear me?"
Clint huffed, tearing his eyes away from the two and grumbling that they could stand to get a room. //Mostly so I don't wind up standing here with a raging boner. Awkward.//
“Weren’t so goddamn stubborn,” Tony finishes. “Hm.  I see you, Cap. It’s not always something I want to see, and sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect, righteous face. Standing next to you can make a tall man feel small. It’s infuriating.”
“Why not?” he says around a laugh. The man leans against the wall of the roof, looks out towards the battle not so far away from them. The unmoving picture of it.  “You’re an interesting guy.”
The surprise isn’t that Steve insists on talking about it - Tony was expecting that - but the way he brings it up, the lilt of his voice, what he
“Let’s see it. Hand it to you mother,” he says, and deftly catches the watch when Elizabeth tosses it over. “God, look at this thing. JARVIS, look at this thing.”
Taking risks is what Tony does, so he brings his hand up to touch Steve’s hair.  Pushing his fingers through the soft blond strands. It’s getting long and he can nearly tuck it behind Steve’s ear.
reference. That if you get him talking - really, really going - that All-American bland, calculated way he speaks slips away and the
“I remember how this feels,” Steve says carefully. “The world you knew and everyone in it is dead. And those who aren’t are old and fading and left you behind 70 years ago. I know all you want is to go back. To dance with her.”
“Yes you are,” Tony says and nudges him with his shoulder. “You made Captain America. Steve Rogers is the superhero. Not a good soldier, a good man, et cetera.”
“It’s because I’m not a woman,” Tony continues. He ducks her next hit, tries to come up with his own punch and gets knocked down on his ass. “Or feminine presenting, I guess? Hm.”
Steve ignores him in favor of steering Dum-E away from the new Go Big Boom arrows for Clint. Which is endearing and therefore annoying, so Tony ignores him just as hard, sliding behind his desk and manually inputting some figures just to look busy. Then he sends a text to Rhodey, just to say hi. And a text to Pepper, just to ask what his schedule looks like for the next few weeks.
If he had access to FRIDAY he’d ask her the average temperature Steve kept his room at, those first years.  If it was higher than the rest of the Avengers’ living quarters.
Something aches in his chest.  She’s got Steve’s hair and smile and nose, but she’s painfully Tony inside. And he can’t help but wonder how badly he must have fucked up to allow that.
Steve sighs and slumps. Tony slaps him between his shoulder blades, forcing him to stand up straight so he can continue fitting the material of his new suit around his ridiculously broad back. Under his hands, Steve takes a deep breath, expands and deflates, and Tony slaps him again. Like he could knock the words out of him.
“And Loki?” she inquired, glancing around cautiously with one hand at the gun on her waist, as if he were going to pop out ready to stab them at a moment’s notice.
Deadly silence then a one-word question filled with so much rage, Tony would have cowered had he not known that it wasn’t directed towards him. “
Tony sighs but damn it, Steve's right. He's always right. Tony doesn't know much about Clint's life before SHIELD and the Avengers, but he knows it wasn't pretty. Seemed to be a common theme amongst their little team.
As Steve made his way to the Sanctum Sanctorum, the pain in his head began to subside to a dull ache versus the throbbing roar it had been before. He followed the directions Bruce had given him as closely as possible and soon found himself outside the front of a three story building that had somehow sustained no damage from the battle. Bruce had told him to look out for an ornate townhouse with a copper-green roof and a dome window with a strange sign emblazoned upon it. This had to be the right one.
Steeling himself, hands clenched into fist at his sides, Steve took that first step and prayed for strength.
Kind of have a plan for this fic now but it's still mainly just vibes lol. I'm having fun though and really that's all that matters. Thank you to everyone who commented on the first chapter, I'm happy to know that there's some people who would be interested in seeing more of this fic 💖.
Steve held down the clutch and pushed the start button and with a beautiful, satisfying purr, his bike roared back to life.
Tony’s the last to arrive like always, holding his own bowl of popcorn because he’s the only one who prefers caramel corn over kettle corn like a heathen. His eyes go wide as he surveys the room, sees that there are no seats open.
Tony's always liked puzzles, and right now, the biggest puzzle of them all is what exactly made Steve's face go slack, his eyes all clear and soft and staring directly at him.
“I’m sorry, Cap.” Tony shook his head. “But I can’t stay here. Not anymore. It was fun while it lasted.” He gestured to Steve and Bruce, “You two are both welcome to continue to stay here, but I gotta go.” And with that, Tony stalked out of the room, leaving Steve and Bruce behind.
straightforward, yet Steve still turned over the words in his head, looking for any possible angle, any trick the Red Skull could have been pulling and came up empty. He
(P.S. Friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or the MCU or anything related to it. This fic is just for funsies.)
“Carmen,” Tony interrupts before she starts melting under the full force of Natasha’s undivided attention, “what’s the game plan for today?”
Was he dead? Had a migraine done what countless villains hadn’t manage to do in Steve’s 105 years of life? But that was no normal migraine. No migraine would send a super-soldier to his knees, clutching his head in utter agony. The sorcerer. The sorcerer had said
“Come for me,” Steve said, jerking Tony to the pace of his thrusts. “Wanna feel you clench down on me.”
With Steve still jerking him, the arousal hit him like a punch to the gut. Tony could see it; bound to their bedposts, Steve filling him up again and again, not even giving his come the chance to leak out of Tony.
One woman, who introduced herself as Chris, had shoulder length black hair and a prosthetic arm. The man with sandy-blonde hair in a buzz-cut called himself Jackson. He seemed to be a bit older (physically, anyway) than Steve and sat with his shoulders hunched forward as if he were trying to make himself smaller.
Tony had been sitting on his bed with his hands in his lap, unsure of what to do with himself. Howard and Maria had left just as quickly as they had arrived, both of their schedules occupied by SI business and charities and they were just oh so sorry that they couldn’t stay for long. With Jarvis and Ana gone…Tony had…he had no one.
And now he was…where was he? He blinked, willing his eyes to adjust to the lack of light until he could make out…a bucket? He blinked again. That was most definitely a bucket. An old mop was leaning next to it. Something was digging into his back and with a shock, Steve realized he was slumped over in…a closet. A scarily familiar closet. Faintly, he could make out the sharp, sickly sweet scent of bleach and other various household cleaners.
"And why is that?" Tony asks like an idiot until he remembers that this base is located in the Alps, where so many things went catastrophically wrong for Steve.
They move from the island to Tony's couch, Tony curled into Steve's side, Steve's arm slung around his shoulder. They polish off the rest of their hot chocolate and scroll through the pages of fanart, getting lost in each other's touch and presence. There's something warm and golden in Tony's chest, slowly expanding, and he knows one day it's going to fill him up from head to toe.
"Tony," Steve breathes his name like a prayer, and it's like someone's punched Tony directly in his chest. Every time Steve says his name like
he even got a chance to get the stones. The original timeline had already been decimated but this one,
She hasn't changed a bit since Tony's last seen her. She's still tan, still short, shorter than Tony. Her dark wavy hair is pulled back into what she used to call her "business braid" for when she had "shit that needs to be done."
For a terrifying second, JARVIS hesitated to respond before saying, “My diagnosis is that you’ve experienced a severe anxiety attack.”
“It was like losing Bucky all over again,” Steve continues. He’s stopped caressing Tony but still holds him close, a reassurance. “And if they had gotten your hands on you...like they did to him...God, I don’t—I don’t know what I would have done.”
Steve turned to look at Tony. Tony was staring up at the trees, his eyes following the flight of a hummingbird. "Is this an interrogation?"
Steve presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth. "Your smile." Another kiss on the tip of his nose this time, making Tony chuckle. "Your laugh."
Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s neck, moaning into his mouth when Steve’s hands slide lower to cup his ass.
Tony raised his sunglasses onto his forehead, stooped down to get a closer look at Steve’s bike and let out a low whistle. “Is this a ‘57 sportster? Where’d you get one in such good condition?”
An inn would be preferable. Somewhere far from the castle and far away from Steve where he wouldn’t have to face him.
Thor lands in the snowbank, sending the snow into a flurry. He stalks towards Tony, his red cape fluttering in the wind. Lightning dances at his fingertips, and paired with the fury painting his face red, Tony would think it was directed at him.
"My mom. When I was a kid...she'd draw whatever I asked her to and would let me color it in however I wanted, even if it was ridiculous. Took me to art museums when we had the money."
"How could I make it up to you?" Steve says, his eyes not so subtly shifting down to look at Tony's lips.
“You…you wouldn’t,” Tony stuttered and closed his eyes, the images coming to his mind too much for him to handle. Just the mere thought of marching back down to the cafeteria, uniform unzipped, his mouth and chin covered with pre-come and drool was enough to make a wet spot on Tony’s underwear start to bloom where his cock was steadily leaking pre-come.
"Iron Man? Iron Man, do you copy?" That's Steve's voice. There's an urgent note to it, almost like he's trying to stop himself from shouting.
Rhodey's mouth closes, and Tony can practically see the cogs in his head turning, coming to the same conclusion he had reached.
Lowering his head, Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s covered thigh. A sharp intake of breath—Steve had liked that. Tony repeated the action, pressing another kiss slightly higher on his thigh while his other hand slowly stroked up and down the right. A part of him wanted to skip past all of the teasing and shove Steve’s cock down his throat until he was gagging on it but he knew the buildup only made Steve more desperate. And a desperate Steve could fuck him like nobody else. With the kevlar catching on his roving lips, Tony’s nimble fingers toyed with the hidden zipper at the apex of Steve’s thighs.
that happened between him and Steve, he did offer him a place to stay. Tony’s not that much of an asshole. He’s not going to retract on that offer.
“I could show you how,” Tony continued, finding Steve’s hands. Heat surged through him as Tony guided him down, down to Tony’s hips and then further to his ass. Steve kneaded the flesh, marveling at the moan that escaped Tony’s lips.
have to talk about anything or answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable, if you don’t want to.”
Dugan shrugged. “Never been one for titles. Not all of us are little lords. I was a blacksmith’s apprentice before I was knighted.”
For a man on his knees and a fist in his hair, Tony looked far too smug, that same wicked smirk emblazoned on his face.
“Oh, trust me, I will,” Steve muttered, drinking anyway.  The wine was sweet but rich, coating his tongue more so than the mead. “How long am I to have my little
“I want to touch you,” he declares. “Let me?” He looks at Steve and hopes his eyes look wide and sweet. He remembers how Steve had snapped the last time he had looked at him like that, the bruising kisses and the hard, almost punishing way Steve had gotten him off…
It, like many things involving him and Rogers, had started because of an argument. Both he and Rogers had been working overtime cleaning up one of Tony’s (although he would argue that it was only 50% his fault) messes. Rogers had been bitching at him nonstop. Tony barely remembered the words that had come out of his mouth. Only the rage, followed by fear as Rogers had stiffened and leveled Tony with a gaze so intense it felt like Tony’s soul was being laid bare. And then came the lust. His ears had burned as shame and lust slammed into his gut in equal parts. Rogers was his co-worker, even worse, his superior, and yet none of that had seemed to matter in that moment as Rogers had seized Tony’s face in his big, calloused hands to pull him into one of the filthiest kisses Tony had had the pleasure of partaking in.
“A fine name,” Steve stated. Tony looked up, meeting Steve’s gaze once more. He flushed, suddenly aware of how close they stood, and found himself backing away from the other man. Floundering for something to distract Tony from his awkwardness, he gestured to his table.
“Fuck,” Steve hissed when Tony let his teeth lightly scrape over the flesh of his cock, his hips bucking upward and briefly gagging Tony. “Do that again.”
Rhodey looked frustrated, although some would argue that was his perpetual state while around Tony. “It tested well with focus groups, alright?”
“You’re late,” she says, in lieu of a greeting. Compared to the rest of them, she looks quite put together. Not a hair out of place, the cut on her forehead cleaned and bandaged. The archer—Barton, his brain supplies—sits with his feet propped on the table like a goddamn
Call him biased, but he loved the stealth suit on Steve. He loved the way it hugged his lithe form, the way the navy hue complimented Steve’s ridiculously blue eyes. The fact that Tony made it soothed the part of his brain that ran through countless scenarios of Steve getting hurt. It’s like whenever Steve wore it, he was carrying a piece of Tony with him.
Steve sighed, leaning his head against the cool metal walls. “Don’t I know it. JARVIS can you take me to my floor?”
Steve repeats the motion and Tony feels as if he’s drowning, waves of pleasure crashing over him like the sea at high tide. He’s not sure if it’s because it’s been some time since he’s last been fucked or if Steve knows his body better than he knows it himself, but as Steve places a cheeky bite right at the edge of his entrance, his hands leave the headboard and thread themselves into the silky strands of Steve’s hair.
It seemed like after their impromptu lunch, the flood gates opened. Slowly, but surely, Tony began to seek Steve out. Sometimes, Steve would enter his floor to see Tony lounging on his sofa wrapped up in his ever present Iron Man themed blanket and light up house shoes as if he lived there himself. One time, Steve had caught him trying (keyword:
"We don't know that," Tony says, his voice muffled. He looks up to see Steve raising a judgemental brow at him. "I'm letting not one, but two master assassins, the Hulk, and a fucking
, she knows, and if it weren’t her job to gather intel and pick up on context clues, he’d be a lot more worried that the others knew. But she wasn’t blackmailing him or threatening him to stay away from Steve? She...approved of them? He remembers that debriefing after they had defeated Loki, what felt like a lifetime ago, and her casual dismissal of Tony and his relationship with Steve. He wants to bring it up, to confront her, but what’s there to confront?
“Captain, are you alright?” Not for the first time that day, one Natasha Romanoff caught him off guard, approaching him with slow steps.
It was the peak of spring. There was a restlessness to the air, as if every person on earth was collectively holding their breath for the start of summer. Tree leaves swayed back in forth in the gentle May breeze, bringing with them the scent of flower buds and Maple tree sap. It was the kind of day that made you want to leave the house and venture out into the world.
“ Of course I do” Tony smiled ignoring the voice in his head telling him no one cares about him. At least trying to ignore it, but he knew it was true and that’s why Tony didn’t burden people with his personal problems. They were dumb problems anyway and completely irrelevant.
Steve rolled his eyes “I kept a promise to your friend and I never break my promises” Steve put on his ‘Captain I’m in charge’ voice. “besides look at you, you’re an absolute mess it won’t hurt to let someone help you” he had a lazy smile on his lips, it made Tony smile too.
“It’s because if they ruin him, they’ll ruin his father overall ruining Stark industries” He blurted out the words without his braining alerting his mouth to shut up. He had to get out of here, the heat began rising up his neck and spreading through his body.
Without second thought he opened the back door through the kitchen and into the alley the people were in. “What the hell is going on here?” Steve shouted hoping that he would be able to take on five people at once if he needed to.
“Relax it’s almost our turn” Thor responded clearly agitated. Steve lazily laid his head on his younger cousins, Peter’s, shoulder; his mind constantly rolling back to this fake mermaid. The wait felt like years but finally they were let in and the group of teens and co rushed inside.
“If you don’t mind me asking why is the exhibit closed?” Steve piped up a part of him was actually disappointed. He didn’t know why but he just thought that maybe this summer would be different but so far it was already at the worst start.
The three men and two women ran, as soon as they caught sight of Steve. “I got his wallet! Go!” One of the girls yelled whilst another one recorded everything.
“Your-Your friend? Brother? Called and told you to stay here. He said Thor and Bruce were on their way?” Steve was panting from how fast he was running. He also stated everything in a question because he really didn’t know what he was getting himself into.
“Drive safe” he winked and Tony might as well have dug up his grave right there and then because he was dead.
“I’m not sure man I think it’s because the mermaid isn’t cooperating or something” the overly strange employee responded before walking away.
“Well it was my first language so yes sir” Tony liked this conversation, it kept him distracted. Howard always told him distractions were the cancer of success but Tony really needed a distraction right now.
“That's so hot” Jarvis smiled leading Tony to the passenger seat, he might as well have been drunk because he clearly was not thinking straight. Jarvis smiled as he started up the car. “Oh Jarvis what will I wear?” And for the first time in a long time Tony was content with his life.
The men continued to discuss their issues except this time they made it loud and clear on their motives. “Marty this animal right her is gonna save the zoo” and the realization hit Tony that he would never leave this fake home as he looked up to see these horrid humans put a cage over the fake sea to prevent his escape. Everyone was right, humans really are horrible monsters.
“Steve, I know you’re a good person. Just don’t think your heads in the right place right now. I’ll let you figure it out for yourself” she shook her head and slipped into the restroom to get a look at the damaged clothes that previously belonged to Tony Stark. Steve was left thinking about the young Stark a part of him thought maybe he could be wrong.  A larger part of him kept reassuring himself that he was right.
The footage on the tv continued showing different clips of the horrid Stark. His father sold weapons to people who only ever caused destruction, causing them to be very unpopular in the regular world.
“Net!” and in a blink of an eye everyone swam away yet Tony was still trying to comprehend what was happening.
Tony walked into a small diner his head pounding from his wild night before. He sat himself in a booth and pulled his baseball cap lower hoping no one would recognize him and blame him for one of the many wars taking place. Despite effort to avoid anything remotely related to well, himself, Tony saw a video of him taking continuous shot last night and it looked like someone he considered a friend recorded it. He acted as if he didn’t notice the whispers about him and his horrid last name, but they were hard to avoid as multiple videos of him being stupid continued.
“Sounds about right to me!” Bruce spoke up suspiciously, but backing Rhodey up regardless. Loki just shrugged not caring, following Thor as he led the way back to Tony’s room. They expected to see Tony a bit on the upset side but instead they were greeted with extreme mayhem.
“I guess you’re right” Bruce groaned “but if he stabs me Thor I’ll haunt you” Thor nodded quickly and began to lead the way. Tony’s body ached every step they took, he so desperately wanted to shower again and sleep away all the pain. “Tony are you sure you’re alright? You don’t look so good” Bruce skimmed over Tony’s face.
“See you” nothing within the last 5 minutes had registered in Tony’s head, he was on the verge of going insane, because Tony never had good luck. Tony never got a lucky chance but apparently today was different.
“Y-yeah yeah I’m great” he closed his eyes took in a deep breathe and ran his hands through his hair. Tony hadn’t had an anxiety attack in awhile and he usually had someone there. He felt exhausted and hollow. He just wanted to nap for a very very long time. Instead he washed his face to hide all evidence of what occurred and tapped his fingers against his chest to attempt to even out his breathing. Tony threw on his signature smirk and left after tossing his horrid clothes in the trash.
“Sir, please calm down, look he's moving, he'll survive” Tony’s chest was still on fire as he bent over looking at the damages, he really was a shitty driver. The cashier from earlier, Steve, turned around.
“Sir may I ask why you are in the driver's seat” Jarvis stood at the door watching Tony with concern.
“I should’ve known you were a privileged ass! I can’t believe that for a second I almost thought you were normal!” Natasha walked in to witness Steve screaming at Tony.
He turns up the radio and Tony almost misses it when he says, “Neither one of us should have been on our own. That wasn’t coping.”
“We haven’t fought,” he says. “Figured by now you would’ve strangled me to death. I haven’t even tried to hit you with the car. Not once. Haven’t even thought about it.  It’s surprising.”
brain if he’d even had a fleeting thought that Steve Rogers could be interested in him, like this. But Steve is flushed and very close and drags his teeth across his bottom lip, and yeah.
Steve is pressed against him, shoulder and thigh and his left foot nudging against Tony’s right foot, like he’s asking something. Under any other circumstances Tony would know the answer, but Steve cannot
“You fought good,” he says. “Made a few mistakes here and there, sure, but you weren’t dealt the best hand this go, Cap. You never are. But this one was a doozy.”
Tony thinks, not for the very first time, it's the sweetest sound he's ever heard. It makes his palms sweat.
He’s been trying not to think of that encounter. Doesn’t know what to make of it. It had refused to call itself God - but what else is something that claims to be the source of all things in the universe? In the
Yes, Steve can see how he would.  They weren’t mirror images of each other. The suits, their hair, the wrinkles that have carved in around his eyes. Steve had just wanted him to
The being in front of him laughs, a big, light sound like bells and morning birds. It says, “Yes. That is typically how it goes.”
after Tony admits he’s never been and Steve finds that unacceptable. Steve parks backwards in the lot and pops open the hatch, folds down the backseats so they can stretch their legs out. It’s definitely a movie about people doing something and going somewhere and things are happening, but Tony couldn’t tell the details with a gun to his head.
Tony hums and Elizabeth turns back to Nat. When the scans JARVIS takes of the gauntlet pop up on screen, Tony turns his full attention to them, and blocks out whatever the girls are saying. There’s something deeply unsettling about all of this, and he’s only now starting to realize what it is.
“Don’t see why not,” Nat says, digging her phone out of some secret, discreet pocket Tony doesn’t remember designing into her suit. “Everyone loves a little recreational reality bending.”
And he did, somehow. Since the moment he left Bruce and Sam and Bucky by Tony’s lakehouse. It was the end of a fork in the road.
“JARVIS, get Strange over here,” Tony says, turning the device she’s been using to reality jump over and over in his hand. “And Richards, I guess. If we really have to.”
He can’t hear what Steve says to her, or what she says to him, but the look in his eyes is so soft, so affectionate, that Tony thinks he could drown in it. Even from twenty feet away.  Steve brushes a stray bit of hair behind her ear.  He gathers her close for a hug, and kisses her forehead, and it stirs everything in his gut Tony has been trying, and failing, to ignore.
The girl throws herself at him, her strong arms winding up around his neck, and she buries her face against his chest and sighs.  It’s instinct that Tony puts his arms around her too, holds her close and tightly, but soft, so fucking soft and careful, the way he always thought a parent
Because he doesn’t deserve another one, not here. Because he loves Peggy, has always loved Peggy, and wants a quiet life in the shade. Just her and him until his bones give out.
“Hey, kid,” he says and she turns to him. Those big blue eyes so tired and scared that Tony’s bones feel heavy.
two years away from where Tony is now. By her own account, the time variables from universe to universes are within three years of where she started.
,” he corrects. “Elizabeth, look, I’m going to get you home. Frankly, the fact that you exist is really screwing with me, so the sooner I can get you out of here the better.”
“Thank you, everyone,” Elizabeth says, in a top notch Captain America voice. “There’s so much - I’ve been lost for a while. Thank you for helping me get home. I know you aren’t
But still, he’s also thinking of the hundred and forty-two ways he knows how to subdue someone, without using his weapon.
“That’s not what you meant,” Steve says, finally looking at him. “Okay. It’s been twenty-one days...?”
, pushes Tony face-first into a vortex. These things happen. Tony knows that better than anyone. Sometimes he meets a
It’s a good sound bite, looks stellar on the news and Avengers propaganda. I’ll give you that. But nothing about you is average. You’re extraordinary, Steve.”
Maybe he could have just done it.  Erased this Steve’s memory with the mind stone and asked that entity to send him back, without the use of the device as it promised.  He could have just
There’s a long silence, before the girl says, “You cast it.” Then quickly, “It’s complicated. Everything is always complicated, right?  It’s not a big deal. Things get... “
“Because,” Steve says, with his on-the-field Captain America voice, “I could hear your heart beating. I know you wanted to kiss me. And you can, if you still want to. I want you to kiss me, Tony. If you don’t anymore, I can -”
, anything, but mostly he wanted to help. It wasn’t until Thor touched his shoulder, and came around to look him in the face, that Steve realized he was crying.
The panic that rose up to choke him on Morag returns.  Knocks him against the wall, the hard edges of the case and hammer in his bag dig into his back, and he can’t breathe. There’s no time for this - as soon as possible he has to get down there and replace the Tesseract and then, after it’s done, he can find another shore somewhere, another ocean to pour all his grief into.
“I know what PTSD looks like. I should’ve - I should have saw what you were going through. Maybe we could have avoided the entire thing if you’d thought anyone was listening to you. Or seeing you.”
Two hands grab at his shirt and hold him back against the wall. His legs don’t work, his knees are buckling, Tony is dead, Tony is here and alive, Tony is,
Until a blonde teenager with Maria Stark’s big blue eyes - Tony’s eyes - says, “No, I told you. You’re my
His name is Joe and he runs the gym near Steve’s first apartment after he was fished out of the ice. He’d given him a key, because
Steve turns away, back towards view. He says, “It’s not surprising.” His fingers brush against Tony’s, knuckles bumping and slotting together. Just for a moment. “I wish - we should have done this a long time ago.  We wouldn’t fight so much if we -”
He watches himself come out of the elevator and the tension in his back loosens. His breathing comes easier.
Even if he wanted to tell him, Tony doesn’t know how. The way he loves Steve rolls over him in waves, pulls back and pushes forward like the tide, and he could drown in it.
