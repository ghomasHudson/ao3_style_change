The pack was anticipating making it to New York before the pups were born. That was the overarching plan. But they were also prepared for if Tony went into labor while they were on the road. They didn’t want that to happen for obvious reasons, but they were prepared nonetheless. They just hoped it wouldn’t come to that and Tony would have a nice, comfortable place to birth his pups.
“You got something in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?” Tony asked, in a neutral tone that Steve couldn’t figure out. Nevertheless, Steve looked away as he felt his face heat up in embarrassment.
Back in the castle, Steve and Tony were in their bedroom thinking of plans for the baby but were celebrating first of all.
“None of that, now! I only wish I could have made it to your graduation! Want some carbonara?”
“Come by to practice any time. The Lang/Van Dyne family’s always got your back, you know that.” Scott said as he held Cassie close.

Bucky comes running into the room, dressed in his gear. “Steve, we have to go now.”
The unforgiving climate of the Rocky Mountains was hard on Tony. His brown fur offered little warmth from the cold winds and clumps of snow started to stick to his underside. Yet still, he trudged on. He couldn’t stop moving. He had to keep moving. The best thing he could do was to keep moving. He needed to get away from his old home. He needed to find his freedom.
On the cliffs, Tony could see a golden-colored wolf that looked majestic. Tony was drawn by how stunning the wolf was that he howled back as a response to the wolf. The golden wolf seemed to hear him and looked down at him and howled back but then he turned around and moved out of Tony’s view. Still staring at where the golden wolf was on the cliff, Tony pondered “Why didn’t that wolf come down? I wanted to get to know him.” before making his way back to Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy.
Seeing how Pepper and Happy were bonded, Tony wondered if he would bond to Rhodey but it didn’t seem like they were connecting like that.
“Of course, dear. We understand. Go pay your respects.”
Steve grunts and groans as he spills his load in Tony’s mouth who greedily swallows it all. Tony then gets up and climbs back into Steve’s laps who holds him in his lap with his hands in Tony’s hips.
“I have to talk that over with Coach Yinsen.”
“Did you want a Catholic wedding?” Tony asked.
Their friends teased him about this often.
Over the next few hours, the pack would continue on the highway and take a break to eat and hunt for more food and find water to drink. They would also stop to play some games at some picnic tables at parks they found along the way to help entertain themselves after walking for quite a while
“Steve, I’m not sorry about leaving. I was worried about you and it turns out I was right and I’m happy I saved your life.”
“What is it, Bruce? I need to know,” worried Steve as he started to worry about his mate again.
Steve then inserts another finger into Anthony’s hole and slides in and out so Anthony could adjust to another finger inside his hole. Anthony felt himself writhed at the mercy of Steve’s touch. He also grabbed the sheets and kicked his feet lightly as a way of reacting to the pleasure.
“Here Tony, I brought this for you.” Steve said as he sat the cup down on a spot on the desk. Steve looked on at Tony working on the suits for them both. Just seeing Tony hard at work like this reminded him of the times where he would come to the lab in the tower and sketch Tony working.
Anthony is watching the footage of Harley practicing is in shock of how good the kid has been doing since the last time he saw him.
After the alpha female said that, Bucky and Tony went over to their sleep partner which was Sam for Bucky and of course, Steve for Tony. Before he fell asleep, Tony felt Steve licking his neck and ears feeling happy that he had a mate like him.
As they are riding through the main city, the citizens of the HYDRA kingdom notice their king and future queen. They stop what they’re doing and bow down and praise their king and future queen. Both of them reach the gate of the kingdom and exit through, heading into the forest.
“Excuse me.” Tony said.
When their kids told them this, Tony and Steve were just shocked. They were finally told the reason why the kids were acting strange.
Tony sat back and blinked. That woman was

Steve blinked, opened his mouth to say something and suddenly had a mouthful of very enthusiastic Tony. Unsurprisingly, he tasted like whiskey. Steve leaned forward, into the kiss, came up to breathe. Slowly, he put his hands up to Tony’s shoulders.
However, Steve’s real introduction to the 21
One week later, while Tony was abroad at a conference, Clint, Natasha and Steve were standing amidst concrete dust at a crossroads in East Harlem. They had just wrapped up the fight against their second villain of the week.
Steve’s plan backfired spectacularly when one evening Tony had one drink too much, leaned across the brick that no-one had bothered taking away from the cushions and kissed him.

Subjects may feel euphoric and less sedated and might have the feeling of doing better, but actual performance ability continues to be impaired by the effect of alcohol. “
The day after the attack, right after debrief, Maria Hill had called for a streamlined image campaign. Apart from SHIELD-curated social media, appearances at conventions and interviews for the press, said campaign also involved the only two overpowered Avengers left on the continent suiting up to lift rubble and the occasional steel beam. Steve didn’t mind. It was not like he had elsewhere to be. And even if they occasionally (frequently) argued, he did not mind spending time doing manual labour with Tony. Even if him thanking Tony for joining him in this “new experience” had not been received so well (
Steve Rogers: I appreciate it.
Tony stepped into the shower and sighed, watching the water circle down the drain between his feet. He had not told the others, but the convention had been grueling for him. There had been five pictures of him with Pepper for him to sign.

Steve was ducking under the table to get his shield but it was too late. A large portion of the ceiling’s cooling system was headed his way. The only thing he could do was bring his arms over his head and brace for impact, before he was being tackled right across the stage and the ventilation array fractured on the back of Iron Man’s armor.

Of all public appearances, Steve resented talk shows the most. The shirts picked out for him by SHIELD media always clung too tight, the topics felt irrelevant at best, and there was no script. He stuck to his lines, regardless, smiled politely and was glad when the rest of the team picked up the ball for him. They never said anything about that. Still, whenever Steve felt like he had made an ass of himself on TV even more than usual, Tony would invite them for brunch, lunch, dinner. Steve was not sure whether to feel grateful or even more inadequate for that. He supposed they needed the team bonding, anyway; there was no telling when the next power-crazed madman would appear. So if they got to know each other over Steve’s inability to distinguish
Right as if on cue, Steve chose that moment to amble into the living room with a bowl of popcorn and a book. Wordlessly, he deposited the snack on the coffee table next to Tony’s hand, sat himself down on the opposite end of the couch, cracked open the book and started to read. The fact that there was a brick laying between them on the couch cushions like a particularly rectangular chaperone apparently warranted no commentary. However, Tony could have sworn he felt glances into his direction whenever he moved for the popcorn. What was this, middle school? When would Steve graduate to pulling his hair? Next week? Perish the though. Because Tony was maybe (definitively) oblivious sometimes, but even he could see what was happening here. This was probably the most awkward courting in the history of the United States. Strangely, he was not all that against it. Maybe only that it was happening at such a glacial pace. And hurting his behind in a definitely unsexy manner. And his little toe, from when he had stumbled over a brick with a cup of coffee on it next to his lab door.
Well, he did not mind being played this evening, not when it kept him and Captain America from going for each other’s throats. “Cooking is not really my thing. In my youth I mostly played

Tony Stark: Sry my bad.
Tony Stark: Things like these are just so stupid most of the time.
Later, after they had debriefed and all gone their separate ways, Steve was left with the unenviable task of writing a report for Fury and Cc-ing Tony. He was not thrilled about finding out how their teammate would react to the day’s bill. A few minutes after sending the report, his phone pinged.
listening to this:
Tony Stark: I am currently testing a beta-configuration for JARVIS’ speech-to-text recognition algorithm. Amped up the sensitivity so I don’t have to yell. Apparently botched the accuracy.
Tony Stark: Oh my god.

In his peripheral vision, Tony could see several people filming with their phones. Not even a second later, JARVIS solemnly informed him that twitter was going ballistic and his stock had just lost five hundred basis points. Tony grinned nastily. Then he opened the visor and said,“Why
evil. I am not talking about we-are-about-to-die-sex, either. I am talking about

Two weeks since Steve had moved into the tower, and Tony was starting to wonder why the Good Captain was still hanging around. Given the man had found a new apartment to replace his ransacked one only one day after moving in – the New York City rent market was not that hard to tackle when you had a highly-sophisticated AI to crunch through listings for you, seventy years of back pay at your disposal and your idea of comfort was access to a water-boiler. An actual reason for the lingering was starting to feel overdue. Especially since Steve had been so hesitant to take up the offer, at first. Tony had had to
Then Steve poured all his energy into his legs and ran. The expo was a tactical nightmare, full of smoke and worse than urban warfare: Zero visibility for him and perfect topview for anyone who might be sitting in the rafters. His only hope was that if they had snipers, they were underestimating him. He was aware of Stark shouting on the comms’ but tuned it out. He was probably calling him a reckless idiot again.
century only started when a fan took off her shirt at a meet-n-greet.
Tony Stark: Look I know you come from different times but if this is going to be a problem for you, then we have a problem. As far as I know, we are professionals.
In his free time, he went to the movies, rode the subway and scoured Wikipedia. The team did not really meet outside of their SHIELD-prescribed publicity events. In short, New York was loud, but Steve’s life was quiet. He was not sure yet whether he liked that. And time flowed on.
Steve Rogers: See you at seven Tony.
together. Something was changing between them on the battlefield. There were no miracles, of course, but little by little, the Avengers were coming together, all of them. More banter over the comms’, less friendly fire. Possibly jeopardizing the Avenger’s team work for his little personal crush seemed irrational, irresponsible, even. So Steve had vowed himself he would step back and let companionship be enough. There was just one crucial fact he had ignored – Tony Stark was the kind of man that would take one step forward when others were stepping back, even if just to relish in watching someone squirm in a corner for a little.
Steve Rogers: It would not be for long.
Natasha ended up ordering in Italian for everyone. When the pizza arrived fifteen minutes later, Tony’s carton was right on top. Nearly immediately after he had taken his first bite of Margherita and started chewing, however, he stopped, squinted at it, put the slice back into the carton and finally lifted a chunk of cheese with his beer coaster to look underneath. He turned to Natasha who had been watching silently. “Oh my god, you literally Hid The Zucchini. Is that even allowed within the bounds of your cold assassin persona?” Natasha daintily took a breadstick and smiled, “What, I only get to have

Not even a second later, the pictures were replaced by diagramms of pure blue light. Tony glanced quickly at them and turned back to Steve, who had just frozen on the couch. “Just as I thought. The photos are mostly your drunk and thirsty fellow citizen, time of posting also suggests desperate or on a dare. Now, the
“No, but in certain places there is graffiti.” “Graffiti….”, Steve repeated, completely mystified. Tony suddenly felt like the fun had gone on for long enough. “Don’t sweat it, grandpa. JARVIS! Add new rule ‘send auto-reminder that offenders’ IPs are being geolocated, blacklisted and that they can kindly fuck off before each autodelete’.” Then Tony turned on the profanity filter again.
When he fell into bed one debrief, five jelly donuts, one shower and four hours later at around three PM, Tony did not want to speak to anyone. Ironically, he had just finished changing into his pyjama bottoms, praying for twelve hours of dreamless sleep,

After half an hour of half-dozing, where no-one felt very inclined to talk, Tony finally said, without opening his eyes or lifting his head from where it was reclined against the headrest, “We won and nobody but one bad guy died. So why the long face?” “It should have gone better”, Steve replied, not looking at Tony. He continued, “What we did today is basically all I did during the war, for two f- frickin’ years, Tony. I should be better at this.” Tony turned his head and looked at Steve. The man was sitting with perfectly straight posture in a fluffy blanket. In another situation, he might have pointed to the humor in that. Instead, he took a breath and made a confession: “I still dream of them, you know? The civilians we did not save two months ago, the guys with me in the Humvee that did not make it when we got blown up. I don’t think I will ever stop, honestly, because that was all on me. But today, Cap? That was not on you. That was on us, I think. We make a lousy team.” Steve’s jaw worked, then he exhaled loudly before agreeing: “Yeah, today was horrible.” “Buuut… ”, Tony amended, “… we can get better. Trust me. Just, work with me here?” He extended his hand to Steve and they shook on it. Both their hands were cold, but it still felt like a start; maybe this could work.
, that was entirely understandable. Even if most of the time he did not seem like it, the man basically had woken up in his times' equivalent of a pulp magazine a little over six months ago. Probably it would be for the best for Tony to be patient and not push him.

Also, a commenter felt cheated out of the pretty brick, so here it is:

“I agree”, Steve answered, then he added, more lightly, “Nevertheless, good job everyone. This could have gone a lot worse. I think Hill knows enough for today and we all need rest. We can do a full debrief tomorrow. Clint, Natasha, please keep an eye on each other until then. Tony, is Happy taking you back to the tower?” “He is on his way.”, Tony replied. “Watch my six until I am in a bullet-proof German car?” “Always.”
Tony Stark: Renegotiating a contract and presenting SI tech for a public tender.
Tony turned around, bone-tired but ready to mobilize that last bit of energy to tear the man child a new one, when Steve yelled across the Street: “Hey, tin can! Would you like to go on a date with me?”
Tony walked over to Steve and started to rub his head on Steve’s hand and got on his hind legs and put his front paws on Steve’s lap. He then got settled in Steve’s lap and whined again. Sensing his mate’s worries, Steve pet and rubbed his fur before he got up and went to the rooms of the other pack mates to alert them.
The citizens of the Hydra kingdom have stopped in certain spots and looking at pieces of paper that are posted in shop windows and in the paper that circulates in the kingdom. They are reading an announcement from the king that reads:
“I would love to meet them Steve,” said Tony as he walked over to be close to Steve.
Steve then started with the plans of letting the kingdom know of the future heir but found it important to let his cabinet know of the news. About 1 hour after the pair found out the news, Steve gathered his cabinet into the meeting room with Tony.
Pretty soon after walking for a while, they found a hotel that wasn’t so run down and they went to rest at the hotel before they would continue the journey. Everyone in their pairs went to their rooms of choice and retired for the night. Steve and Tony settled in their room and prepared to shift out of their wolf forms so they could sleep in the appealing Queen-sized bed.
Shadows: Shits about to go down guys. Happy reading. The chapter title is from
After the golden wolf said that, the Alpha who was harassing Tony walked off and they don’t see him anymore.
“Hey, you just got here, and you’re leaving already?” Maria said as she watched her son walk out with a side bag.
“What do you think? Much as I would hate to rely on magic, there is an appeal to having our own kid ourselves.” Tony asked Steve.
Here is chapter 4 finally. There is some smut in this and a bit of a surprise so read to the end.
“Hi, Happy.”
“Dear Tony, everything is going to be alright. I’m going to keep you safe.” Steve spoke as he held his queen’s face in his hands and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead and hugged him again.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve replied, relieved.
Tony sat in silence as he took in the information that Howard had presented to him. He didn’t want to be thrown away to some Alpha he’d never met. He didn’t want to become a housewife in a loveless mating. He didn’t want to be used by this Alpha. Tony had dreams. He had ambitions. He wanted a life of his own. He wanted to build and study the robotics and computers that had been left behind from the old times. He wanted a life of his own.
“Pietro called River a stupid Omega and Wanda ruined Rowan’s painting that he made of us all by smearing black acrylic paint all over the canvas,” Sarah spoke as she looked at the twin boys who still seemed to be upset from what happened to them.
On the T.V. in the main lobby of the villa resort, footage is shown of inside the Aviator Sports ice rink of skaters practicing.
Steve leans in to give Anthony a soft kiss to the side of his lips. The feeling of those lips on him made Anthony blush hard since he never had an intimate moment with someone before and he just met the person in front of him the day before. Steve could tell that Anthony is feeling a little tense so he takes everything he does slowly since they will be wedded in a few weeks.
Also, the journey to the east coast would take longer to accommodate Tony’s pregnancy in case he needed anything. It was better to take things slow and steady with such valuable cargo. Nobody had any problems with this new arrangement. After all, they all wanted Tony and the pups to thrive.
“Mrs. Stark! You’ll never guess who I have with me!” Pepper said as she stood next to Tony who had his luggage in hand.
“Shit. We might already be too late.”
“What? You had a viewing party? You’ve got to be kidding, Mom! I’m going to die!” Anthony then shook off what his mother told him over the phone.
Tony then turned around to walk over to the desk to get a sip of the coffee that Steve brought for him. After having a drink, Tony sat the cup back down and Steve saw a few drops of the coffee dribble down his chin before Tony got a towel and wiped his mouth clean.
The next morning, Tony woke up slowly and noticed that Steve was still sleeping. When he woke up, Tony was feeling nauseous and carefully moved out of Steve’s embrace and sat up on the bed. The movement from Tony sitting up stirs Steve which then wakes him up.
“Look how beautifully you came on me, don’t be ashamed of doing this.”
At the end, Anthony is panting from the exhaustion that he feels after performing for Hope. When he lost at the Grand Prix Final, Anthony felt depressed but now feels energized and alive after doing that.
“Oh Tony, we don’t have to do that.” Steve replied. He knew Tony didn’t share his religious beliefs, and he certainly didn’t owe Steve anything.
“I do love you and I can’t wait for you to be my queen and bear our children.”
Tony took the wedding ring for Steve. “Steve, this ring is a reminder of my promise to you. I vow to love and honor you from this moment forward.” He slid the ring on Steve’s finger. At that, they didn’t wait for the priest to invite them to do it, they drew close and kissed.
“She looks just like you,” Steve said lovingly.
“Alright guys, the final round of the game.” Happy said as he drew a black card from the top of the deck. Flipping over the card, Happy reads the following “Me Tarzan, You, _____.” As soon as Happy put down the black card, Rhodey, Tony, and Pepper start looking through their deck of white cards for the perfect card. As Happy waited for them to play their cards, each of them let out some hard laughs, probably indicating that they’d found the perfect card to play. As they set their cards down in a pile, Happy takes them and starts shuffling them.
The 3 winners were Steve Rogers in 1st place, Thor Odinson in 2nd place, and Peter Parker in 3rd place.
Tony was enjoying his time laying in the leaves when the pack came sprinting back from their hunt. Now the pack coming back early wouldn’t normally be that big of a deal if they had a fresh kill with them. But they were empty-handed and Steve looked part frantic and part furious.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi Sarah,” Steve said as he looked at the newborn in his arms. She had blue eyes and a small tuft of blond hair. “Oh.” Steve breathed out.
“YOU ARE STAYING HERE AND THAT IS FINAL!” Steve yelled at Tony.
“You can do it, Anthony! Work hard!” Cassie said excitedly.
After resting in Kansas City for a little longer after finding out that Tony was pregnant, the pack continued their journey onward through Missouri. While they continued their journey, Steve decided that Tony would be resting in the truck while Happy drove for a period of time so he could rest before he’d resume walking with Steve.
The rest of the service went on once they sat back down. At the end, the priest invited Steve & Tony again to stand in front of him while he said a closing prayer. Once he finished, they instinctively drew in for another kiss.
Luckily they didn’t have to wait too long for the pups to come to them.
“Mom...Dad...there’s something we need to talk about.” Sarah began speaking.
“Ahh… This is exactly what I needed.” Anthony said.
Song for this chapter may have been inspired by Mamma Mia.
Steve then wrote down the last thing on their list for now and put the paper and pen away for now and then turned to look at his sweetheart sitting in his lap facing him.
“Why? You should have it. It was made for you.” Tony gently put the shield on Steve’s arm, and for some reason Steve was reminded of Tony placing the ring on his finger.
He couldn’t believe his luck.
Steve’s reminiscent thoughts were interrupted by the Quinjet touching down at the Compound. He steeled himself for whatever Tony’s reaction would be. Yes, Tony wanted them here because logically it made sense. It didn’t mean he would be at all happy to see them. As they exited the Quinjet, Tony was there, in the suit, minus the helmet. The armor looked different. It was more streamlined and not as bulky as Tony’s previous armors, more closely hugging his frame. Steve used to watch Tony as he designed his new suits. This one looked impressive. He wished he could have been there to see how Tony’s genius mind had developed it.
Although probably the word “scoundrel” would have been more appropriate, Steve mused. The man’s lack of a plan B and his tendency towards soliloquy had more than compensated for their lack of manpower – less than an hour after the call to assemble, the offender was already tucked into the back of a receding police car, leaving behind nothing more than rattled residents and hundreds of thousands of dollars in property damage. Steve had a sinking feeling that this might become a regular occurrence. While he could not really put his finger on it, he felt like the appearance of “heroes” was encouraging all kinds of irresponsible behaviour.
Tony Stark: And it is Harlem, again. I am starting to feel like we are actively furthering gentrification.
Obviously the man’s formative years had not been very fun and he was now forever stuck in catching up on all the missed-out Great Depression era pranks of his preteen years. Tony could not really fault him for that. Hell, probably bricks had been all the rage in 1926. But the couch. Really, Steve? The

Because exactly there lay the problem – Tony Stark was not only endlessly interesting, generous and frustrating, he was above all a fellow Avenger. Since that day on the Quinjet when they had shaken hands a second time, Captain America and Iron Man had been on a really good path towards working

at the fan until she tucked her shirt back in. Tony had signaled for security. Within minutes, the lady had found herself very quickly in front of the convention centre again, without an autograph. But Tony had not missed the look of utter shock that had crossed Steve’s face for a second. Apparently, neither had the others, because when he had invited them for dinner and drinks at the tower after the convention was over, they had all agreed.
Week three and Tony was going nuts. He had meant to relax on the couch and unexpectedly sat on a brick. Vigorously. Then he had yelped, jumped and sat down a little to the right. At this point it really should have stopped being surprising. Steve kept finding excuses for bringing back “interesting” bricks from his charity outings and leaving them all strewn across Tony’s living space. By now, Tony had given up on trying to find an artsy interpretation. From what he remembered Pepper telling him, Land art was something done
“Shall we be on our way my bride?” Steve whispered.
“Stark tumbles to last place. Will this season be his last one? Possibly.”
Tony can see Steve fighting Howard in the middle of the chaos. Steve was holding his own well but Howard was faster and moving in quicker. Howard then made a move and stabbed Steve in the side. Tony quickly feels scared for the safety of his mate seeing him injured but realizes that he has to act fast in order to save him.
“Alright, got that idea down. Now, there are some traditions that the kingdom follows for weddings but I want to know if you want to follow them or not.”
As night fell once again on what was Tony’s third day of travel, the storm let up for just a moment. The sky did not clear, but the endless tide of snow slowed down and the wind slowed to a gentle hum. And yet, the cold did not let up. The temperature continued to drop and ice formed on the branches of the trees. The February frost setting in for the night.
“Do you, Steven Grant Rogers, take Anthony Edward Stark to be your husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?”
The priest asked for the rings and blessed them. Steve took the wedding ring for Tony, which was silver with a blue stripe down the middle. It was the same shade of blue as the glow of the arc reactor Tony used to have. “Tony, this ring is a reminder of my promise to you. I vow to love and honor you from this moment forward.” He slid the ring on Tony’s finger.
“Listen up soldiers, King Howard from the Stark kingdom has received word that my bride is here and is coming to take him back. The wedding is being moved up to tomorrow so there is time to prepare for the up and coming attack from King Howard and his army. King Howard is not taking back the queen of the Hydra kingdom.” Steve yelled out, showing that he is very angry at the chance of Howard trying to take back his queen.
After they stopped to rest for the night on their first day of travel, they all got into their piles to sleep in. When Steve and Tony got into their pile, all they smelled was each other’s pheromones which made them go even deeper into bliss. Steve licked Tony’s face and Tony returned the affection. Pretty soon, Steve could hear quiet huffs which told him that Tony is asleep.

“Hey Bucky,” said Tony as he fully shifted in his wolf form for bed.
“The name sounds familiar,” Steve replied as he shook Strange’s hand.
Pretty soon, Steve arrived in the lab with a cup of coffee for Tony as sort of a peacemaking gift while everyone worked around the clock to prepare for the fateful day.
“Oh, so that means I’ll have to wait until the right scent comes along to find my mate,” said Tony a bit solemnly while finishing the cup of coffee he was drinking.
“U-Uh…I’ve got to go now, sorry.” said Tony since he can’t bear to be near someone as successful as Steven when he failed miserably at the final. Tony then turns around to leave as Steven watches on in somewhat sadness.
“Uh…”
Steve saw Tony’s eyes glistening as the priest turned to Tony. “Do you, Anthony Edward Stark, take Steven Grant Rogers to be your husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?”
But they quickly left when they saw the tuft of black fur stuck to a tree not far from the cabin.
Steve leaned forward and kissed Anthony lightly on the lips and he continued to thrust into Anthony but he decided to take it a more romantic turn to show his love for his future bride. He laid his right hand over Anthony’s and brought it to above his head, gently opened it with his fingers, and interlaced them together. They were in the most intimate moment they’ve ever had since meeting each other only 1 day ago. Steve then moved his lips from Anthony’s lips to his neck and pressed feather-like kisses over the vein. He then moved to look Anthony directly in the eyes. The thrusts became more erratic before Anthony came with a scream from the sensation he felt for the first time and Steve came with a grunt into Anthony’s hole before pulling out.
Steve Rogers: When should I bring my things?
Please note that this actually is being done by *teams* of people with doctoral degrees and/or getting there.
Let me show you.” He pressed a button on the side of the coffee table and a holographic screen came to life between them. With a few movements of his hands, he navigated to Steve’s official social media page. “Did you know, Steve”, he said “that SHIELD is using a profanity filter based on open-source code from Stark industries? Well, this allows me to do
Tony Stark: Wow where is that even coming from.
Clint Barton: But please keep sending me updates lol
taking visual cues from this:
Tony stared at his phone, then at his reflection in the window, noticed that his mouth had fallen open and closed it. Then he looked at the picture again. Was Steve taking the metaphor
-walking around MIT campus in google street view.
There was a ping of an incoming message over the sound of the shower, but Tony ignored it.
Tony Stark: I graciously leave that honor to you, since I am the one bankrolling this shindig.
He had just gotten into the tub when he remembered. “JARVIS, read this to me?”
Clint Barton: Lucky bastard.
During the exchange, Steve had snatched up the shield and and taken off across the convention floor. While running, he formulated a strategy: “Clint, Natasha, stay with Stark, get Hill on the phone and and get the whole convention area cordoned with SHIELD agents. We also need help with evac. This is clearly an ambush and they are using civilians as collateral to keep us busy. On-site security are all gone, no idea why. Don’t separate! I am clearing the north exit, then I come back, I take Stark’s six and we take it from there.”
Clint Barton: Ten bucks.
Tony Stark: Also not sorry.
(If you have any experience with editing sound, I strongly recommend reducing pitch by about 2 full tones and tempo by a few bpm, and you are golden)
Steve Rogers:
In the blink of an eye, the Good Captain had stopped lingering. Equally fast, he had gone back to looking generally constipated whenever Tony entered the room, what with the flexing of the hands, the grinding of the jaw and the all-around bullheadedness back in full swing. He had also tried talking to Tony after a debriefing on two occasions, even once making a grab for his shoulder. Tony had brushed him off. There was only one plausible explanation, anyway – Captain Steven Grant Rogers had decided that even in the 21
Tony Stark: I suddenly feel a lot less inclined towards donating that park now.
Tony flicked his wrist.
This particular evening, Natasha, Clint, Steve and Tony were having cocktails at the tower after what had been an especially painful meeting with the Fourth Estate. Or especially humorous, as Tony insisted. “No really, Cap, don’t feel bad! You made a talk show host perform a literal spit-take on national TV without even trying. That was some effortless grace there, I’m envious.” Then he handed Steve a game controller. “Speaking of effortless grace, have you ever played Mario Kart?”
Edit: Nope, it will be five instead of three. Oops.
When Tony was not around, Steve usually let his mind wander while shifting the debris. Even if he felt guilty thinking it, he was grateful for the time out, the opportunity to slowly get used to Manhattan’s new face again. Even if he was doing it one destroyed shopfront or broken sidewalk at a time.
In case you don't know why Tony is reacting the way he is: Clint is referencing the
Clint Barton: No way in hell I am getting into that.
A very helpful anonymous comment.
If you feel I missed something, please comment!
Steve was going nuts. Over the last three weeks, not only had he realised that he was interested in Tony Stark; he was starting to feel embarrassed for
As always, if you think you spotted something that had you go "hey!", please drop a comment :)
Also,  we will have four chapters instead of three, folks. Sry for that :/
In the end, they found and incapacitated twelve mercenaries armed with guns.
but apart from that… what about you, Barton?” “I make a mean stir-fry.”, Clint shot back from the other side of the coffee table before calling out, “Anyone apart from me want pizza?”
Shadows: Things are happening! Who’s ready for things? It’s a good one this time around. Enjoy!! Also, it’s Emmie’s birthday today! Happy Birthday!!!!!
“Roses, carnations, and baby’s breath. There should be black and red roses, Baby’s breath should be white, and we should have red, white, and black carnations.”
The fact that they were able to win against a mad titan who had the power of the Infinity Stones and could have destroyed them all but they did it. They really did it.
“Yes please.” Anthony said, giving his consent very clearly.
Man, this took a while but I finished it. Hope you guys enjoy the new chapter. I'm actually really excited about writing this but I need a break.
“Sure enough, he’s crushed the free skate event, as well. This marks the 5th consecutive Grand Prix Final win for Irish Legend Steven Rogers. Rogers is now 27 years old. Some speculate that he may retire but his masterful performance here may lay such rumors to rest.”
“My dear king and queen, you are with child.”
Anthony walked up to Midnight and gave her the treat to which she eats quickly like with Steve.
After Tony finished his story, they all just sat in silence and taking in what the Omega had told them.
After they all sat down in the chairs, Bucky was first to speak.
Shadows: This one's a bit short but it’s a good one. Chapter title is from
At that reminder, the look in Tony’s eyes was gone as he shut himself off again.
The ceremony proceeded, with the priest saying the opening prayer before the wedding party went to sit in the front row pews. They moved onto the readings, and afterward, the priest delivered a short sermon. When he finished, it was time for the wedding party to stand in front of the altar again, so Steve & Tony could recite their vows. They took each other’s hands as the priest turned to Steve.
“That you, Anthony?” She asked to which Anthony nodded in reply. “Well, quit standing there like some stranger and tell me how you’ve been!”
“Wine, cheese, and bread.”
“Mmmm, smooth,” Tony said between kisses.
“I guess. I kind of need more time to think it over.”
“Ha! I’m telling you, Cassie might be one of your biggest fans. Hey!” Scott said coming from behind Anthony.
“Come on my dear, let’s take you to a healer to find out what’s wrong.”
Steve is on the ground, clutching his side while he stares at Howard towering over him. “It’s over King Steven, Tony is going to be taken back to be married off.”
After Steve’s parents were killed in the explosion of their house, he wondered if he would ever have a family again. Now that he found his mate, he couldn’t wait to have a family but was sad by the fact that his mom and dad were not around to be able to meet his future pups. So in his mind, he had thought of the idea of naming one of his future pups after his mom: Sarah.
“So it will be that way.” Steve says as he turned around with his council as King Howard did the same.
“That sounds wonderful Steve, I’d be glad to do those traditions.”
"You know what? Keep it for now. I'll let you know if I want it back."
Tony smiled. “Well then it’s obvious where the two of you got your looks from.”
Here's a new chapter for you guys. Hope you're liking what is happening so far.
Bruce continued to work as the pack doctor. With so many members it was important they had a doctor on hand to keep everyone healthy. Especially the more accident-prone members. Clint came in with some sort in cut or bruise at least once a week. Speaking of Clint, he’d taken the job of teaching archery to kids. He absolutely loved his craft and was always excited to share it with others. Plus Clint working had the added benefit of getting him out of the house where he was even more messy and troublesome than all nine pups combined.
Shadows: Bit of a shorter chapter here guys as things start to wind down. I hope y’all like it.
“Well, I suppose I have, but I don’t know how good a parent I would be. I didn’t have the best example of a dad.”
“Good morning my darling, glad to see you awake.” Steve said as he brushed one of his hands along Anthony’s cheek.
Enjoy the final chapter of Allure of Your Blood!
“We need to move NOW.” spoke Sam as he looked behind him to check for anyone that might be hiding. As soon as Sam finished talking, everyone went over to the truck and Tony got into the front passenger side and Happy shifted back and then turned on the truck and started to drive with everyone else surrounding the truck.
“So you’re retiring? You’ve never had a girlfriend?” Cassie went on.
After seeing that, Hope is in tears of joy.
Emmie: It's finally here guys, read the chapter and I hope you'll like the smut that Shadows cooked up
Emmie: Here we are, we made it through Howl for Me and it’s sequel, The Next Stage. It sure was something to write both of them but Shadows made it fun and I loved every minute of it. Right now, I’m working on the 3rd chapter of Paint Me and my Stony song one-shots but writing this took a lot of energy out of me and I’ll get to them when I have it again. Thanks again for the love and we’ll see you guys next time when we post our own individual work.
Anthony nodded and said “Ok.”
“They have been causing a nightmare for all 7 of us,” Morgan spoke.
And finally, there was Loki. He’s opened up a book shop that sold just about every kind of book you could think of. Loki felt at home surrounded by books in his little shop. He’d spend his days reading and writing among the piles of books when he wasn’t helping people find things.
Anthony had his arms around Steve’s waist as they rode fast back to the castle. After around 30 minutes of riding, both of them make it back to the castle and head through the gates. When the citizens saw their King and King’s Consort, they all clapped and Steve waved at everyone he could see. Steve also instructed for Anthony to wave at the people too. It didn’t take long for them to reach the stables. Steve got off of Midnight and helped Anthony off as well. Steve walked over to a bucket and grabbed 2 treats from it. He handed one of them to Anthony.
“Stay still for this part.” said the healer as he dipped the brush into the blood and began to draw the symbols on Tony’s stomach. It only took a few minutes for the healer to draw the symbols on Tony’s stomach. The healer started to chant in the same strange language that Steve used when he healed his injuries a few months back. After a minute passed, the blood turned to a black color. The healer smiled at the result and looked up to Steve and Tony.
“Then a few weeks ago, Sarah had enough and kicked Pietro’s ass after practice. It was at the same time as when Pietro insulted River and said some not so nice things.” Fawn spoke.
“Yeah, thanks, Mom. It’s been a long time. I should’ve come to visit sooner, sorry.”
Steve rubbed his hands together before he gently slid one finger inside Anthony’s hole and went in and out again and again. Anthony opened his eyes and gasped from the shock of feeling what Steve was doing and felt a little discomfort since this was his first time doing this but didn’t ask Steve to stop because he was loving what was being done to him. Anthony felt it was good to let out more moans to let Steve know that he was enjoying this and he wasn’t in pain.
“Yeah, I’m tired of it too,” Steve replied.
“Fine, I guess.”
“Rhodey, how is it that Pepper and Happy are bonded but I’m not bonding to you?” asked Tony while sitting in a chair and drinking a cup of coffee while wrapped up in a blanket by the fireplace in the cabin.
But it wasn’t all arguments, especially once they were able to talk through their problems. There was also wedding planning to be done.
“Pietro made fun of River about how he was landing his jump in pole vault and Wanda insulted the painting Rowan made of us all together,” Sparrow spoke.
Anthony lays on the floor, feeling shame and embarrassment.
The fight was brief, but intense. They eventually won the battle, but Steve knew that wasn’t the end of it. Whoever they were, they had done a number on Vision, and had seemed to want something from him.
As Tony began his journey back to the cabin, he recognized the smell of an Alpha nearby and started to get uncomfortable with how off-putting the smell was to him. As he started to near the end of the city, the Alpha that Tony smelled earlier came up to him and started to get too close to him.
“Alright, the wedding will be tomorrow. Wanda and Pietro, send out word to the citizens that the wedding is tomorrow so the celebrations can begin.” Steve said to said people to which they nodded in understanding. “Be sure to get my suit and Tony’s dress finalized by the end of the day today so we’ll be ready for the wedding tomorrow.”
“Of course, Tony,” Steve replied, as they settled down to watch the rest of the movie.
After their short conversation, both of them hugged each other and kissed before they got back on their horses and Steve called for the army to return home.
After a crushing defeat at the Grand Prix Final in Sochi, Italian skater Anthony Stark decides to go home and debate if he wants to continue skating in the future. After being recorded doing the Grand Prix Final routine of his idol, 5-time consecutive gold medal winner Irish skater Steven Rogers, Anthony's skills reached worldwide and even inspired his idol to come and be his coach for the next season.
“You don’t have to go through with it, Tony,” Steve said as Tony looked over at him. “If you’d rather not, I’ll do it, or we can explore our other options.”
God only knew how Tony referred to him now.
Thor and Sam worked in construction which is why they were able to build the extension to their old mansion before moving into their current one. They were really good at the job, gaining a reputation across the city for their expertise.
Tony did as instructed and gave his outfit over to Steve. The healer moved over to Tony’s left shoulder and made a small incision in the skin. Tony winced at the feeling of the healer cutting into his skin and held onto Steve’s hand. After letting the wound bleed for a little bit, the healer collects a decent amount of it into a small dish with a small brush.
Steve twirled the engagement ring around his finger with his thumb. Their first contact in two years. It seemed like a lifetime ago.
Emmie: Here’s to a new chapter while we are all stuck at home.
“After a ride, I like to give my horse a treat.” Steve said as he gave Midnight the treat to which she ate fairly quick. “Now it’s your turn, give her the treat.”
Shadows: It’s pup time! Emmie did a lot of research for this chapter and it’s sooooo good! Give it a read. Enjoy!!
Steve inserted a third finger and slid in and out so Anthony would be stretched open before he would slide in. That’s when Anthony withered underneath Steve’s touch and let out some high-pitch moans and breathed quick and fast. Steve then pulled his fingers out and lined up his member with Anthony’s hole and teased him with doing so. Anthony mewled and whimpered with excitement.
“Steve, there’s one thing that I want to let you know.” Anthony spoke as he stared into Steve’s eyes.
Steve then got up from the bed and got dressed for the day and helped Tony dress as well before they headed to the medical room in the castle to meet with the healer. When they get there, Steve carefully led Tony to a seat as he did himself before the healer came over to the duo.
“Oh no, I loved the beard. Beardy you and shaved you both bring valid things to the table.” Tony replied, continuing to kiss Steve as much as possible. Steve certainly wasn’t going to stop him.
“All right, dear, take care.”
Tony, however, was feeling scared but also happy. He was...he was pregnant. He was going to be a mother.
Emmie: This is the end everyone, thanks for reading this fic and maybe we’ll have another coming out. I just posted the 2nd chapter of Paint Me but it did take a while since I’ve been focusing on making sure this gets done and handling college but since I’ve been sent home because of the coronavirus so now I’m doing my school work from home and I can work on my fics now. Thanks for reading this fic and maybe in the future, we’ll do another fic. ENJOY!
“There are these 2 kids that are older than Sarah, me, and Morgan,” Peter spoke.
“Alright, here I go,” Tony whispers before stripping down and shifting into his wolf form. Tony, in his wolf form, was mainly brown with a white belly and white muzzle. After he shifted, everyone else gathered around him to sniff him. Now they recognized Tony as one of them.
“What is it?” Tony asked, concerned.
“Is everything ok Steve? You have this weird look on your face.” Tony said to him as he sat the towel down on the desk.
Shadows: This one was all on Emmie. She did a good job with all the exposition. Happy reading.
Shadows: Well, that’s it. That’s the story! Thank you all for reading and all your kind comments. This was a blast to write with Emmie. It’s been quite the journey, hasn’t it? This was my first time writing a true sequel to something. I don’t count all the add on one-shots and such for MTHS since they all take place during the main story. Thank you all so much for all the love this series has gotten. It means a lot. If you liked my style of writing, feel free to check out my other fics. I’ve got a thunderiron one going on right now and a winteriron one in the works and a few one-shots. Thank you all so much for the support. This is Shadows, signing off.
“No, he didn’t qualify. But fortunately for us, that means he can come home.” Maria said as she tending to a plant in the main lobby of the villa resort that the family ran.
“You did well tonight, but I think your step sequence could use a bit more finesse.” Steven said as he walked by with Harley.
“Nah. I’m guessing you don’t want an audience? I’ll make sure you’re not interrupted.”
Steve was overwhelmed and tried to hold his emotions back. “Oh, yeah, that’s…that’s amazing of you Tony.”
After just hearing Steve yell, Tony is shocked and backs away from him out of mild fear. After just realizing what he had done, Steve lowers his head in shame before getting close to Tony.
Shadows: Good things are happening! We all need some good things right now so enjoy!!!
“Uhh, yeah I’m totally ok Tony.” Steve said in haste. He tried to then make it seem like he wasn't hard anymore but Tony could tell in Steve’s reaction that there’s something more than what Steve was telling him.
“Don’t give up yet, kid, you hear me? You’re too young to retire.”
Then someone kicked the door of the bathroom stall Anthony was in which scared him.
“Oh…! You’re freaking amazing! That was a perfect copy of Steven! Honestly, I thought you’d be depressed and unwilling to skate again after your loss at the Grand Prix Final.”
“We haven’t talked about names yet.” Steve said one night when they were both in bed. Steve had his hand over Tony’s belly, looking at it in wonder. He told Tony as often as he could how beautiful he found Tony and how proud of him he was. Steve knew this wasn’t easy for him.
Rhodey was the first to greet them, sticking his hand out to Steve, “Cap. I would say it’s good to see you again, but you look like crap.”
“Well, I don’t know.”
Emmie: Get ready for the big surprise that this chapter has, it’s what you’ve been waiting for
“Uh… Umm… I’m sorry… I messed up.” Anthony said as he lightly cried and hung up the phone.
”I have nothing to prove to you.” Tony said as he swung his sword and sliced Howard’s neck, leading to him bleeding out.
“Hey.” said an Irish voice that Anthony knows all too well. He turns around and it’s Steven Rogers, his idol.
“Let me guide you my dear.” Steve said as he threaded his fingers in Tony’s hair and guided his face to his cock.
“Here darling, these shoes are fit for the future queen of the Hydra kingdom.” Steve then handed the shoes to Anthony who put them on swiftly.
“Well dear, we will have a traditional wedding ceremony and that night is when you’ll be turned. The next morning, you’ll be dressed in your royal garb and meet your new subjects. It will be a grand occasion and I want you to be ready for that. You and I will have people to help us dress for the occasion, you’ll walk down the aisle alone, and we’ll say the wedding verses that will bond you and me together for eternity.”
“Anthony!” A friend of his said as he was walking while watching the video on his phone.
“You didn’t like the beard?” Steve asked as he kissed Tony back.
Hey guys! Can you believe that there's one more chapter after this? It's crazy to me. After I get the last chapter done, I'm taking a break from writing so I can wind down after dedicating myself to writing this multi-chapter fic when I'm used to doing one-shots.
They then laid their lips on each other and put their hands on each other’s shoulders.Tony opened his mouth slightly to moan and Steve took the chance to slip his tongue in his mouth while slipping his hands up the dress to cup the velvet bubble butt and knead it with his hands.
Their hands are all over each other as they passionately kiss with Steve nipping Anthony’s neck. His hands go back to Anthony’s ass where he grabs, pinches, and kneads. That results in Anthony letting out some high pitched moans.
“Yeah he’s a wizard,” Tony added. “The kid & I helped him stop some aliens who were after his necklace.”
Not long after, Steve can spot something coming into view from a distance. He sees 5 figures coming from the distance on horses. Steve signaled for his council to follow him as they move towards the figures coming their way.
Emmie: WHO’S READY FOR SOME PORN?!?
“So my dear Tony, do you have any ideas for the wedding?” Steve said as he held the pen above the piece of paper while looking at Tony.
“Sure dear, what flowers do you think we should have?”
“What?” Tony asked, turning towards Steve in surprise.
For days, Tony walked through what felt like a never-ending blanket of whiteness. He wondered if Howard was looking for him. He doubted it. He was nothing more than a useless tool for the man. He tried not to dwell on things. It did not good to think about the past. There were better things to think about as he trudged through the growing piles of snow.
Shadows: Hey peoples. Here’s a new chapter for you. Enjoy some fluff and a little bit of trouble brewing.
“We’re so sorry, I promise it won’t happen again.” Steve wanted to fling himself out the window. “I should probably check up on the rest of the team anyway.” With that, he turned to leave, wanting to get away from there as fast as possible. He glanced at Tony, who was turned away from him. As he left Shuri’s lab he twisted the ring around on his finger and wondered what prompted Tony to kiss him. He could hear laughter coming from behind him as Shuri & T’Challa made light of their embarrassment. Clearly their irritation was just a ruse and it wouldn’t be long before the whole team knew about it. Great.
Steve felt the tears well up as he nodded “Yes, yes absolutely I will, but are you sure this is what you want?”
“Alright, I think I know why Tony can’t shift back to his human form,” said Bruce as he stood back up.
Steve lends out a finger which results in one of the butterflies landing on it. “Lend out your finger my dear.” He says to which Tony obliges and watches in aw as the butterfly flew from Steve’s finger to his.
back into his life?
Anthony then skates to the center of the rink.
“Seriously?” Shuri asked in an irritated tone. “Right here in my lab?”
After having thoroughly grooming his mate, Steve turned Tony onto his side so he could see his belly. Steve nuzzled the fur there and gave Tony sweet little licks. He couldn’t wait to see Tony get heavy with their pups. He was going to have the family he dreamed about for so long.
“I’m a master of the mystic arts” Strange corrected, somewhat annoyed. “And the ‘necklace’ is the Eye of Agamotto. It houses the Time Stone, one of the Infinity Stones.”
Steve then wrote down the traditions on the paper.
Anthony is in one of the pool relaxing, taking his sister’s advice to go soak in it.
“Huh? Stevie?” He questioned before the dog jumped on him and tackled him to the ground.
"You've kept that on for two years, even though there was almost no chance of us getting back together?"
When they arrived in Ohio, Tony was now 6 months pregnant and heavy with his and Steve’s pups. Steve could see by looking at Tony that there was maybe more than 1 pup. He was filled with so much pride and joy seeing how heavy his mate is with their pups, only 3 more months and they would be born. Tony’s nipples were already starting to get bigger and hang lower, a sign that his body was preparing the milk for their pups to drink. As he was getting bigger, Tony’s found it harder to walk compared to before he was pregnant.
“Rhodey,” Steve replied, relieved that Rhodey at least forgave him enough to joke with him. He wondered what Tony might have told him about what happened. “I will say it’s really good to see you again.”
“Why me? Like why did you choose me out of everyone else that you could meet?”
Steve moved his hands to the straps of Anthony’s dress and started to pull them down slowly from his shoulders. He continued to pull it down to where it’s at Anthony’s waist. Steve then moves his lips to rest on Anthony’s neck. He breathes, nips, and licks it which makes Anthony let out a sweet and soft moan. Steve took note of what he just heard and chose to move the dress even lower which exposed Anthony’s ass. He then moved his hands to grab a hold of Anthony’s ass. As soon as Steve put his hands on Anthony’s ass, his mind went
The other close call was at night. Clint had been keeping watch outside of where they’d decided to stay the night. He saw some movement nearby and decided not to risk anything. Everyone quickly packed back up and left after that. And so that lead the pack to now. Tony was a week away from nine months along and they were only just entering New Jersey. They were so close to reaching their goal. So close to safety and sanctuary. They just needed Tony to hold out on giving birth for another two weeks and they’d be home-free.
Tony Stark: Well not all of them, obviously.
Especially the scene in the parking lot is strongly inspired by the author’s real experiences. Also, I took medevac and piling dead bodies into a helicopter straight from here.
So for Tony to pull this off on his on, with limited lab time... no need to say more, right ;)
, he thought wryly to himself. Well, why was he surprised. They just did not work out, apparently. At least not apart from work. No need to tell the team yet. He suspected Natasha knew already, anyway.
Meanwhile on the flatscreen, Steve’s character had driven off the racetrack and was plummeting to his cartoonish death while Clint calmly drove his cart across the finish line. Then he held out his right hand to Natasha, who handed him ten dollars and
***THE END***
, Tony had agreed to join Steve and the FBI’s HRT, and the ensuing fight had been brutal: Steve had nearly drowned once and Tony’s armor had come under heavy fire, one of the hostage-takers was dead and one of the three HRT helicopters had been forced to return to the mainland for emergency landing. By the end, the rig had virtually been rendered obsolete. Now, the Quinjet’s autopilot was engaged, both Captain America and Iron Man were down to their undersuits and Steve was wrapped in a blanket.
to become sergeant?
Also, the tone has gradually been changing over the course of the fic, how do you guys feel about that?
