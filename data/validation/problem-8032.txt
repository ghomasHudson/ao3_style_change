"Don't they already, Lord Stark?"
Being a hired sword under Rhodes' command, she felt out of place amongst silk gowns and silver cutlery and would've much rather spent the evening in the small hall to eat in her friends' company. Sellswords, poachers and knives were people she liked to surround herself with, but she knew not to let discomfort show.
Out of the two of them, there’s only one intruder – and it most definitely isn’t the dark-haired girl with the same mistrustful frown on her young face he’s seen on Tony just hours before.
In any case, Steve doesn't care as long as the final outcome is the same and there's less fuss made about it. The fur Tony is still clinging to falls down his shoulders and pools around him as he settles. Steve moves him around to open his zipper and free himself from his suit pants. As is always the case in Tony's presence, he's fully hard in a couple of strokes.
“You had that falling out too, right? Back in–2016? The Accords? Siberia?"
His skin is still flushed, reddening where Steve has kissed and licked for a prolonged amount of time, and his dick is back to being almost soft between his legs. Tony has to look twice at the groin area, and–yup, his face isn't the only place the razor should've paid a visit. Not that he has the desire or stamina to keep himself free of body hair, but that jungle down there is seriously clamoring for a trim.
Steve knows.
but despite her great efforts, the effect is rather sobering.
To think that Tony has to relive this experience again and again when he's already suffered through it more times than anyone deserves (once) makes Steve sick to the stomach in a very real way. The urge to throw up is there, although he always manages to stifle it just so.
The next time he looks down, he's naked.
That first touch is exhilarating – the scratch of Tony's goatee is a sensation his brain associates with intimate familiarity, something Steve only realizes he's longed for when he is shown what he's been missing.
that measures his harmonies, because Tony isn't playing along anymore. They can stop pretending to perform together when what they are is worlds, decades and a pile of bodies apart.
When he's made himself presentable again and the house is still quiet, Steve chances a glance at the clock in the kitchen. It's past noon already, and from what he can tell, lunch hasn't been served yet. Tony seemed appreciative enough of his cooking last time – considering he said so himself, he surely wouldn't mind a repeat instance of it.
Instead of commenting on Tony's habit, he says, "Wolf. Maybe wolverine, but they don’t go for game that large. Unless they're desperate." He swings himself back onto his mount, gnawing at his temperature-induced split lip. "We'll need to, ah, spend a night. If they made a kill once, chances are they'll come back for a second serving, and we can't have them thinnin' out the herd."
He surely was aware of this, and yet, under the layer of flippant arrogance bestowed upon him by his father, Anthony Stark remained a kind-hearted and compassionate man who guarded his land and its people like the apple of his eye.
Tony doesn’t respond, already distracted by the numerous holograms JARVIS has pulled up for him. “What if we just… missed something,” he mutters, sifting through the data. In his peripheral vision, he sees Steve still lounging on the sofa, but he’s put the sketchpad away and his arms are crossed over his chest. Tense.
“Will he pull through?” the stranger inquired, gesturing toward the men that were carrying Anthony back to where they had set up camp the day prior.
Steve gets up and takes one last look around. The Tesseract is gone; he isn't sure whether to be glad or annoyed about that development, but he'll try to stay positive for now. It's the only thing he
“Tony! To– Tony?”
She sure is Tony's kid, no doubt.
Bruce went ahead to apply a cooling paste and wrapped the foot in fresh bandages. By the time he began fixing a splint to Anthony's leg, two flat pieces of wood that would force his foot into a fixed position and limit its movement so as to prevent him from disturbing the healing process, the brunet was barely reacting at all but for subdued groans of discomfort.
Steve pulls out with a wet squelch and hot, pulsing throb in his entrance that Tony can’t even conjure up the presence of mind to feel humiliated about. In its stead, he feels deeply sated and perfectly content–some overworked muscle groups definitely won’t be thanking him come tomorrow, but that’s nothing he can’t live with.
"You, Peter. I would like for it to be you."
Steve Rogers is expendable, but the future needs Tony Stark.
The last time he was referred to as such would have been in his late teens. Indeed, Tony Stark was jailbait once.
Tony can't help himself – a bit of sick wonder and disbelief claw their way into his chest. He looks back down, and, with no small amount of trepidation, reaches out with a hand. His palm smooths over the light bump of his stomach and then, he pulls at a fold of (what looks to be) mostly fat with his thumb and index finger. He jiggles the skin to check. Yup. No rock-hard abs there, as suspected.
"That he is," he said, turning to his mount and pulling himself up to its back.
, then no. That was a trick question,” Tony answers, his lips twisting into something of a faltering smile. He turns to the hologram floating behind him, rearranging some segments and discarding others with a flick of his wrist.
Romanoff nods as if to accept the apology. Steve doesn't see why she would play along other than to humor him, so he considers it a point in his book.
The Lord's words faded into silence and he now moved to face him as well, a small, muted trace of his previously broad smile left.
Anthony made it out alive, if only by a hair’s breadth. Stane was beheaded a fortnight after. The once trusted man’s treason seemed to have shaken him out of his grief-induced apathy, and he began to take on the role of his departed father in earnest.
joke to you?"
he thought as he felt his member only stir in the confines of his breeches, clearly finding the prospect to be exciting rather than unsettling. Still firmly seated in his lap, Anthony did not fail to notice. He smirked, a spark of something wicked in his eyes as he bore down onto his groin.
After having been relentlessly pestered about the matter, Potts had merely commented that while she respected and considered Lord Stark one of her dearest friends, they had never nor would they ever share a romantic bond of any kind.
It’s funny, because he wasn’t even in heat then. Couldn’t have been, not yet anyway. A few days more and he would’ve been able to tell, but even if it had been closer–the chances of them conceiving should’ve been virtually non-existent. Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve. Even when the odds are in
He'd keep Tony from going in peace just because he needs to squeeze in another
Not-Steve’s face does something strange. It's a grimace, half laced with resignation and guilt. He begins to shake his head ever so slowly, a few degrees left, the exact same amount to the right. Robotic, pre-programmed. Again. Again.
whatever comes out of his mouth. And right now, Steve's saying all these frankly outlandish things because he, his entire, too-good-to-be-true being, is convinced that this is what Tony is. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Hell, even perfect
Tony feels his face scrunch up in a strained grimace as he tries to pry his eyes open. They refuse to cooperate, at first, and the first glimpses he gets through small slits in his eyelids are nothing but blurry smudges of color. It's frustrating and he grinds out a sound of displeasure through clenched teeth, fingers digging into the soft material underneath.
It'll have to do. Tony’s standing by a tree and leans against it for support while he wrestles with cloth and buttons until he's managed to free himself from his pants. The cool air makes him suck in a sharp breath, but Tony doesn't acknowledge it any further. He can't wait anymore.
Hi-dra may have shaped him into the perfect soldier, but they have no say in who he is today. Not anymore. They gave him the tools to surpass not only his previous self but them as well, and they're naïve to think he wouldn't notice it happening or care even if he did.
And it was fun enough, when he was younger – and he's a lot of things, but that he isn't anymore – but it lost prevalence in favor of other things. Maybe it was part of him growing up, growing into this role he'd forged for himself in the cave, and that was fine. He'd nonetheless dress up occasionally, get particularly fancy or a little risqué when he dared, only now for outings and events at least tangentially related to Avengers business.
Steve slides his fingers between Tony's, pressing their palms into his chest to wordlessly emphasize the statement. It’s a nice sentiment, so universal there’s no need for it to be spoken out loud.
"So… I called. They're getting here tomorrow, and, uh, nobody said, but I bet you Fury will be coming to see this with his own eye. Thought you might wanna know, fair warning and all."
The last weeks were quite the journey, and this getaway isn't only the perfect opportunity to relax for a bit but a much-needed reminder that they'd do well to take some time for themselves more often. Tony doesn't want to have to wait for the next time Thaddeus Ross practically strangles him with red tape to go on a vacation again.
They fixed him.
He pulls his hand away. Steve's brows draw together in confusion and then in disappointment, but Tony doesn't leave him any more time to second-guess. Steve watches, motionless and blue eyes still watery, audibly drawing in air as Tony wraps his arms around his neck until they're pressed flush against one another. Disbelieving, the other man wordlessly observes Tony as he leans closer on the tips of his toes.
When Lord Anthony greeted her with a "My Lady," smiling still and somehow smelling of lavender, something within her bristled.
They hadn't noticed him that day, and he never made a mention of it afterwards. So it came that only much later, when Anthony asked they go out on a ride together, the boy stated no reason but the unspoken yet obvious dejection eating on him.
At 1930 hours, he's waiting for his target to show.
Tony swallows, gaze dancing around the room until he seems to finally force himself to look at Steve. There’s an abundance of emotion in his expression, apprehension and indecision and
Tony, staring into his own distorted reflection that frowns at him from the remains of the amber liquid at the bottom of his glass, experiences a moment of clarity.
“The Kronole. That I sent. With every message. Please don’t tell me...” he exhales forcibly, brows knitting in a contemplative frown. “Look, it’s like these small, black chunks of– well, it’s industrial waste, but–”
As soon as he's fit enough to walk at a speed that doesn't insult his dignity, he escapes the hospital with a cracked sternum, broken ribs and a limp and has FRIDAY do an extensive scan in the lab.
Even in the dark, he's able to see the moist gleam in Tony's eyes, and it tells him everything he has to know.
Steve adjusts his grip on the supersonic rifle. He'd be labeling it as excitement, but he knows it's adrenaline that's ramping up his pulse. This is the moment he’s waited for since he’s been handed his most recent assignment, and it is somewhat of a special occasion.
i gave in and decided to turn this into an actual thing.
With the used rag, he wipes away the sweat collecting in the hollow of Tony's throat. As he gently turns his head to do the same for the back of his neck, Tony’s hand comes up and locks around his wrist in a grip that is feather-light, barely qualifies as one.
Steve flings the severed limb away, shortly thereafter followed by the butcher’s knife. The counter is a single pool of blood creating individual waterfalls where it’s dripping onto the floor, forming another puddle at their feet. Tony’s slumped over, his legs barely keeping him upright, and his body shakes with sharp, hysterical cries and teeth-rattling sobs that have no beginning and no end. It’s a long string of continued misery of Steve’s doing.
of course this is it.
Tony's feet are dangling just above the surface of the water; Steve watches and feels irrationally anxious about the likelihood of his socks getting wet.
"They're workin' you two like hell, ain't they?"
Natasha had trouble keeping her fingers off the daggers in her waistbelt after having first encountered the man.
"Will you ask him to join the guard?"
Stark might be the exception to the rule, as much of a curiosity as he is. (Or perhaps especially because he is one.) It is this that drove Steve this far in the first place: icy blue, soft brown underneath and vivid red against lifeless concrete.
He’s expected to take another moment to follow Tony over the edge, but the instant his hole spasms around Steve tight and hot, he’s done for. With a blissed-out moan, he comes inside Tony, who’s gasping audibly as he spills his release within him.
“Let’s just say it was far from over for us…”
Steve is doing the sad eyes again, and can he
it says.
Tony's gone through enough himself, there's no need to burden the man with emotional baggage that's not even his own.
He doesn't get to react beyond a nod and a tight smile before she's already turned her back to him and enters the van at the very front of the convoy, the last person to arrive. They leave, after that.
Just the one moment of inattentiveness is enough. Tony steps on an icy patch of ground and loses his footing. With a yelp, he finds himself on the floor yet again, the pain of impact uncharacteristically distant. Tony writhes helplessly in the snow as he tries to get back to standing – the crutch is somewhere he can’t
And still, Tony keeps stroking himself toward completion, the rough palm of his hand rubbing the skin raw. He wonders how Rogers' would feel in its stead, whether it'd be softer, or harsher, or more punishing in its grip than Tony's is. The man's hands are bigger than his own – Tony has stared at them for prolonged periods of time, and he has been able to make that out very clearly. They're bigger, maybe big enough his prick would almost disappear entirely in his fist.
but I'm sure this is really hard on
Steve enters the house last, pulling the door close as everybody files into the living room, taking their seats. He keeps to the back, near the wall, and stifles a soft gasp when an almost too real hologram of Tony flickers on.
Tony Stark sure as hell won't be ordered to sit idle when he knows he can be of use. It's one thing for Rogers to take care of those tasks he's better suited for and hand off the idiot-proof ones that even the most out-of-touch city slicker could manage to Tony, but this is downright ridiculous. Their job up here is one and the same and he'll do his part just as Rogers does, occupational hazards be damned.
He already feels like he won’t be able to string two words together in a hot minute. Is that a good enough excuse to just keep quiet? Can he dare? Steve’s narrowed gaze suggests that no, he doesn’t even want to try wiggling himself out of this one.
Hearing it like that, it does sound like a bit of an overreaction. Steve feels his ears burning with shame but can't get himself to admit to the fact that he could (and should) have handled the situation differently. Impulse control sometimes isn't on the forefront of his mind, especially when related to unjust accusations that are nowhere near the truth. Especially when related to Tony.
"Safe travels," he shouted as both the knight and the Lord kicked their mounts into a leisurely trot, leaving the castle grounds and their walls behind.
ego, of all things.)
or he will catch goddamn mountain madness in these next few months.
"I'm just, I'm confused about my own–” he cuts himself off and sighs in frustration. “I don't know why I– Does it mean my brain can't differentiate between you two? Does it mean I didn't
When he’s done, Nebula’s share still lies untouched in front of her. She looks up when his confused stare becomes too piercing to ignore. After a few moments of silence in which Tony is left wondering, she pushes her piece of food in his general direction, expression unchanged. “Eat,” she says, in a tone that tolerates no dissent, and turns away.
When Tony's gaze travels back up for a moment, he notices the telling ways of his nose being wrinkled and the corners of his mouth having turned very strictly downward. His frown is accentuated by already existing and increasingly prominent lines. He looks a little appalled. Mostly, though, he looks just the part of someone who's on the verge of hitting a late midlife crisis. Nice one, Stark.
Tony jolts upright with a gasp, desperately sucking air into his lungs after what feels like an eternity of going without. Like being held underwater for an extended period of time. (And wouldn't he know about that?)
lord. They–"
His gaze wandered to Steven, who everyone knew was a miserable liar. Clearly, he suspected that this outing had not been approved of by the resident steward. Sometimes, the boy was more perceptive than he ought to be.
The prospect of going back to SHIELD and practically reliving the past eight years feels like he's stuck in a cruelly ironic catch-22. It's almost a deja-vu, save for the feeling of existential horror that overcomes him when he thinks about repeating the experience of being thrown into a new-old world all over
Bruce tuned out the man's continued drivel to gather his equipment and supplies from the counters and cabinets in the chamber, returning to the two men right as the blond threw his hands up into the air.
"We'll be running late," is what Tony says, finally, and his voice sounds rubbed raw for a reason he doesn't want to take a closer look at. "So, if you still wanna introduce me to that Korean place–"
. Here he is, another human being, and Rogers prefers to talk to a damn horse. Mostly though, it’s endearing to witness, and Tony often has trouble looking away. But he does. He does look away like he’s supposed to, and instead pats Butterfingers’ neck in way of apology for not being quite as big of a horse-sympathizer as Rogers seems to be.
Tony whistles a little tune to himself when he hears Steve return. He’s just finished the first batch of omelets. They're far from perfect but edible, and that's everything that can be asked of him.
Tony–who lies there, spread apart, turned inside out and gasping broken little noises–looks like the personification of lust. His reflection is sweaty in a way that somehow isn’t as attractive as Steve’s, his dick slapping against his thigh with every thrust and his stomach graced with a soft curve where Steve's is flat.
Steve realizes that's precisely what he might be, at least to this very much alive version of Tony Stark. He doesn't get the chance to finish the thought, because Tony has recovered from the initial shock and produces a gauntlet out of nowhere, his palm alight and pointing in Steve's direction.
"Romanoff is here," she says, neutral although the glint in her eyes betrays that she knows the meaning of the words to be a weightier one.
saying are of possibly greater value. Steve narrows his eyes despite the knowledge that he’s long ago acquired: you can’t read anything off of Natasha she doesn’t want you to. “It’s– heat, I think,” she adds, taking mercy on him.
ears, and that should mean– "What the fuck's that supposed to mean, JARVIS? I swear, one of these days I will sit down and hand-pick all those lines of code even
possible moment, he rolls and yanks on Steve's leg, successfully pulling the man on top. With him and the Iron Man suit between Steve and the ground -- well, there's no sugarcoating it. Chances of survival are still a one-digit percentage.
"The sayin' does go 'curiosity killed the cat', so you might be onto somethin' there," the man returns, and although he does a good enough job at painting over it with practiced indifference, there's still the hint of a smirk there.
The kiss, hot and messy as it is, has them both out of breath by the end of it. Tony looks at him quietly as they part, something new and unreadable in his half-lidded eyes. When their lips meet again, there’s a desperate edge to the way he moves against Steve that wasn’t there before.
The glide is so smooth–flawlessly engineered by none other than himself–Tony barely feels the blade until it comes out the other side.
He goes back to his seat in the corner, with the rats and the whiskey to drown out his thoughts.
When he's finally finished and satisfied with the results in front of him, he puts the razor down with the towel (Steve's going to bite his head off later), moving to retreat into the bathroom – and catches a glance of himself in the mirror.
Steve stops chewing for a moment. When he resumes, he lifts a questioning eyebrow.
and although Steve wasn't watching, he could see that was Nat's doing in his peripheral vision. And peace was restored.
The sight is affirmation enough. In any case, Stark looks too out of it to catch any smugness in his voice. There are faint trembles shaking him, dried tear tracks streaking his face and a faraway look in his eye. If it's resignation, spite or just the drugs is anyone's guess.
"Well, Sir Rogers, I believe we will just have to keep our carnal desires away from the castle, wouldn't you agree?"
They remain standing there for a moment.
Today, it was Ms. Potts who greeted him on his way to the workroom where he would typically meet with Anthony to put their most recent stroke of genius into practice.
compulsion to fill it with words doesn't stem from just thereabouts.
Tony starts reading and the world lifts out of its hinges.
When he has fetched the book, Tony opens it hurriedly, not even daring to sit down.
"What he said," Tony provided, voice like sandpaper, finger pointing at Clint. "And you know I wouldn't say that if the situation wasn't dire."
The lake house.
While James' stories of his adventurous forays into amorous territory always made for entertaining conversational material, it one day struck him that Anthony never really did share anything of the sort himself.
Then, he catches a glance of the drawing Maria has worked on during all this time: it's a colorful illustration of a sailboat, three stick figures on its deck. The sail's triangle has "Maldives 2024" written on it in blocky letters, and the background is a sea of bright blue and splotches of green land, with the occasional flipped-over '3' depicting a seagull.
Anthony Stark had invited him to, as Peter came to know soon enough, offer him a position among the castle’s staff to aid him, the Lord in person, think of more such inventions that would benefit all people in the Far Lands.
Steve has the audacity to roll his eyes at him.
These long days and longer nights come and go.
he needs someone to make sure they don't all keel over dead throughout the winter," he explains, pausing for a moment while his gaze shifts off to the side in thought. "Say, ah, you wouldn't know anyone willing to work a job like that? It's no lone man's business up in these mountains, and frankly, I have no desire to be that man. Pay ain't half bad, though."
“Uh, no, I think I’m alright, JARVIS. This is very insightful. Thank you,” he answers, and takes another sip from his juice. Wants to, anyway, but the glass is already empty. Huh. That was quick.
Erica is a smart woman. He should probably stop skipping his therapy sessions.
He knew it would happen one day.
Tony's eyes go from wide to narrowed in a matter of seconds and his voice is a hiss when he says, "Who the
Steve is glad he's gotten the last say, this time around.
It's the next night that Rogers' body finally gives up the fight; as in, he passes out and hopefully catches up on enough sleep for him to go back to being his slightly less grumpy and slightly more amicable self.
Steve stiffens but then holds him tighter, almost in a clutch. Tony doesn't hear his answer.
"JARVIS, would you put some music on? Something slow, maybe."
There's no judgement in her voice, nothing to gauge whether she has an opinion on the matter one way or the other. A personal connection clearly isn't there, but she'll have known of Tony's name and the things told about it and connected the dots. It's a simple statement and one that is true–after half a year, the amount of Tony's tech circulating on the market is scant.
He swallows as he heads toward the front door, apprehension suddenly clogging his throat. When he steps onto the patio and focuses his hearing, he can clearly make out voices from inside. They're muffled, but one is deeper, older, and the other is undoubtedly that of a young girl.
"Yeah.
Seeing as it's a regular occurrence, Steve isn't surprised when he's pulled back into reality on one of these nights–not at first, anyway. His mind is slow to shake off the sleepy haze and Steve painstakingly blinks himself awake only to find Tony's usual spot on the bed unoccupied.
Steve, suddenly aware of how in the way he is, forces himself back onto his feet. He's still not entirely steady, his head light and his chest hurting, but he steps aside when the others pass, following Rhodey as he walks and carries Tony through the rows of heroes still on one knee to honor the fallen Avenger.
In fact, Carol realized as she grew, she was not interested in much beyond the art of swords and the art that was other maidens.
Steve was never any good at saying no
It's only right and just for this to in turn haunt Steve in his sleep, on the rare occasion that he gets some.
"Let's hold off on that one. Think I got one more round in me after this."
that? It's serving no purpose but to make Tony feel guilty about something he doesn't have any real control over. Christ, it's not like he got up this morning and made the conscious decision to be a mental car-crash of a person for the rest of the day.
“Here’s how this is going to go,” Ross says and takes a few purposeful steps in his direction. It’s supposed to rile him up; the bitter tang of Tony’s shame still hangs in the air and this asshole's having a field day over his slip-up.
Once Steve's finger is engulfed up to the second knuckle in the warm sleeve of Stark's asshole, it takes all the willpower left within him not to immediately replace the one digit with his dick. Resisting the temptation is torturous, but he can’t very well send Stark to medical right away. Pierce won’t mind if he’s a little banged up–he will be worse off once they begin breaking him in–but his employer won’t take kindly to irreversible damages done.
Steve swallows, his throat so tight he almost chokes on it. His eyes sting relentlessly like he's about to cry again, but the tears won't come. The other two haven't noticed yet that he's stopped his work, both occupied with the suit's lower half, legs and boots.
Spreading out the pre-made mixture of unripe mulberry, flax, mandragora leaves and a good many more ingredients on a thin piece of cloth, the physician cast a furtive glance over his shoulder. The two other men were conversing quietly, Rogers' expression having softened with sympathy in the face of the pitiful sight Anthony made for.
Maybe his expression is a little too fond, because Tony angles himself away from Steve just so and visibly closes off after that, shaking his head as if to get rid of whatever their interaction might have triggered within him.
There’s something like unspoken understanding between them. Watching your friends and allies turn to dust while you’re the only ones to remain standing will do that to you, Tony thinks, during a bout of morbid cynicism.
This one took a while, but he found him. He always finds them.
Later, Tony won't be sure if he imagined it, but he thinks he feels something zipping past his cheek and it causes him to flinch. All hell breaks loose in the fraction of a second – there's a bark, a wounded whine, and a hoard of lowing cattle storms past him, luckily parting around him as they do.
“Well then, how about we find out just which favors King Fury will be ready to grant us?”
When he turns the page again, the landscapes and animals vanish into thin air, making room for... Tony. It's all Tony, from a close-up of his mustache to a sketch of him outside the hut, brushing off Butterfingers with an easy smile on his face. It's him at the campfire, illuminated by its glowing embers, him with dishevelled hair and an oversized coat that the thinks might be Rogers'.
The blond firmly shook his head. "Worried. You
One evening, they’re cuddled up on the couch together, watching–to Tony’s immense suffering–a rerun of
turns into yet another lie. They're apart, disassembled. Broken, all of them. As he sits there in the dirt, numb with a pain that’s yet to come, he looks up into the sky with tears in his eyes.
Tony's neglected dick twitches at the words. He can feel each and every part of him as Steve has his way with his body and it's
When gravity finally has Tony meeting the ground, everything fades into the background in behalf of the sudden, debilitating spark of pain shooting up into his body from a place low in his leg. He cries out despite himself, but manages to muffle any further sounds as the initial surge passes and only a continuous, hot throb in his ankle is left.
“Indeed. Young Miss Stark was delivered by c-section, however.”
Steve’s almost relieved when Tony nods in understanding. If none of this fazes him, their timelines might not be all that different after all.
Tony looks up at the peak of the mountain in their wake, recognizing it from their hike up to its peak, and frantically checks whether the gem in his hand is still there. He's not disappointed at the results. In his palm, the Soul Stone glows a more subdued orange than before, but it's very much there nonetheless. He shows it to Steve who smiles, having just picked up his shield that's magically reappeared on the ground at his feet, and Tony stores the stone away safely. After all this, he isn't taking any chances.
Seeing as he doesn't have any other choice, Tony makes
He anticipated as much. They are (or, were?) the same person in the truest sense of the word, after all. Steve’s own emotions are all over the place; he can’t imagine what it must be like for Tony, being confronted with the spitting image of his husband and father of his child, knowing it’s not the same man he remembers loving.
"I think I'll manage," he says. It's only half a lie. "I'm not about to exaggerate my skillset, but I learn quickly. Just need someone to show me the ropes."
"Felt a little longer, is all."
Steve swallows, mostly regarding the knowing look in her eyes, but nods. She'd know, of course. He couldn't imagine Tony keeping the true extent of their relationship from his wife in any case. It's not like it was that much of a secret, what they'd had back then, during the time Pepper and Tony were apart.
The wound itself, while leaking discharge and not anywhere near healed, does seem to be improving slowly. Steve won't praise the day before evening comes around (their last outing has taught him not to dare ever again) but he watches every step Tony takes toward betterment with his breath caught in his lungs and hope a gentle nudge in the back of his brain reminding him to breathe again.
They make love again later, under the full moon that hangs low and bright over the hills in the distance. Just for a moment, Tony gets distracted by the strange glitter of moonlight against the grass–it’s bright and concentrated as though reflected off a surface–but the thought gets chased away by another kiss.
Turns out his gut was right after all.
– you find out new things you didn't even know were there for you to know nor thought to ask about. It's nice.
"You can either say it or we'll stay right here. I can do this all day. Your call, sweetheart."
he thinks, and leaves the place behind for good.
If his eyes are red when he returns to the cockpit, Nebula doesn’t mention it.
when they left them here with Tony's body. Nobody even stopped to think that their means to reverse this are right here at their disposal. Maybe--nobody dared to bring it up. Maybe they thought it best to not play with powers beyond their comprehension, and, well. Steve can get behind that. It is reasonable.
The unfairly muscled reason for his lapse of judgement is sitting on the tall strawberry roan trotting along the snow-covered trail in front of him like he was born there, shooting knowing glances back at Tony every once in a while as if he's intensely aware of Tony's deep-seated regrets.
And Steve Rogers is no one's soldier.
Tony is half reclining against Steve’s chest, the other man’s hand clamped in his as he twirls the bracelet around Steve's wrist. It’s too tight to slip up or down but loose enough to move. Tony thinks it’s one of his better designs, especially with that holo-shield he managed to fit into the paper-thin casing. Multi-purpose is his thing.
this world's Tony chose to come out here. Chose this, isolation and primitivity – both of which is relative, but especially for a man like Tony Stark who'd be used to towers and mansions, a house by the lake could be viewed as such – over luxuries that had felt safe and familiar before but served then as a constant reminder of his failings.
Just where
“Okay,” Steve finally concedes, as he always does and as Tony expected him to. This is everything he can do, after all, to atone for this thing he had no actual hand in. “Run me through it again.”
Steve purposely keeps his eyes down and fixated on his own hands, but he can't help but notice Tony shifting minimally, his stance infused with a sudden tension as he does.
Steve slows; hIs movements are oddly calculated as he turns off the stove and adds the last pancake to his own stack. “Tony, what do you–” He cuts himself off and shoots Tony a stern look. “Did you pass out in the workshop and hurt yourself again?”
is, unable to scream or curl in on himself with agony.
"More than," Tony says around a mouthful of omelet. He grins and knows it's more likely to be a leer. "I don't know what you're gunning for with this, but it's kinda hot. Actually, not knowing is what elevates it to the next level."
When Tony steps out of the shower, the mirror in the en-suite has fogged up with steam, its surface covered in a layer of white.
"Eh, you know," he answers, clearing his throat to hide the strain in his voice, "nothing too specific. Watching the people that find their way into this god-forsaken place is interesting enough. Makes you wonder what made them come here, where they came from, where they're going. Good way to pass time."
They have a more or less quiet meal. Tony is busy shoveling food into his mouth–once he got a taste, he realized he wasn't just tired but starving–and Steve keeps glancing at him between bites and then starts all-out staring with something in his eyes that Tony would call
Although Tony isn't looking at him and won't notice, Steve smiles in sympathy. He knows what it is that Tony fears, this nagging feeling that even something you thought you could treasure forever is gradually slipping through your fingers. It's an irrational fear, but a real one nevertheless.
The words were spoken between breathy moans and something that Steve didn't know how else to call but a
Rhodes has exchanged the War Machine suit for casual wear and is now leaning against the wall on the other end of the room, barely engaging in conversation and silently staring off into one corner more often than not. His eyes are red-rimmed and his jaw clenched tight, and it seems to take everything in his power to not leave the room immediately when Tony's name falls. Steve understands.
And if what he's suggesting is the exact premise of his every other nightmare, well. It's not like he's in the habit of talking to Steve about his nightmares anymore. Roundabout is everything he has to offer these days.
After a few nights and after each of which Rogers turns even less talkative,  increasingly irritated and snaps at Tony for comments he would have previously only rolled his eyes at, Tony takes mercy on him (and on himself, because the man is exhausting to be around when he's tired and moody).
He knew it would happen. It just wasn’t supposed to happen this soon.
It takes a while, but they settle into a kind of routine.
“And I will be sure to have an earnest talk with the woman about her loose tongue and the type of men she chooses to share her bed with, no doubt. As for you–” he stepped back, creating enough space for Hammer to slip past him and leave the table as he gestured for the man to do so in an ever-polite manner.
Fury's office is as expansive as the one Steve was familiar with in his world. The great glass panes behind the desk allow for an almost picturesque view of the city in the back – a view that is disturbed only by the countenance of one Director Nick Fury, whose expression turns to one of displeasure as he notices Steve's increasing absentmindedness.
"Am now," he returns, his smirk lopsided.
God, he’s really hard.
"I watched you die," he says, eyes distant, fogged with lives past, "over and over and over again. I watched you die because nothing I did was ever enough. It took… a
“Do I really need to spell it out for you?” Tony asks suddenly, his tone exasperated but his eyes tired.
Truth be told, he figured he'd get an evening of extraordinarily extensive lovemaking and maybe some sappier-than-usual pillow talk whispered here and there, but nothing that would differ much from their usual procedure.
Tony thinks, smirking crookedly into the warmth of the fire.
His anger at himself gets directed outward as he shoves the door open with a momentum that has it shaking in its hinges and banging against the wall behind. Noise is always the first thing that will get you unwanted attention, so Steve reigns himself in. Later, there’ll be time for guilt, for rage and self-loathing. Right now, it’s Tony’s fragile life that demands his attention, and Steve can’t fail him again. Not this time.
When they get to the medical station, the omega, of course, isn't alone but has attracted unwanted company. The small group that has gathered around him seems to at least have the decency to go by the phrase "no touching, only looking", although Steve isn't inclined to test for how much longer that'll hold true. They've already snagged the piece of cloth from the man, the loss of his only protection forcing him to retreat further into the corner behind him, naked limbs tucked tight against his body.
"I'm beautiful." Tony huffs with pretend annoyance. "There, I said it. I'm cured.
One day. One day, his tired, old heart is going to give out and nobody will ever know it was good ol' Captain America's sexual deviancy that did him in. Hell, there's worse ways to go.
Steve nips at the sensitive skin on the inside of his thigh, one of the spots that will unfailingly draw sounds from him every time. Tony gasps a little and spreads his legs wider on instinct, or in the hope that Steve will finally stop playing with him and go where his mouth is
Tony perks up at one particular word.
His voice is laced with feigned incredulity and Tony hates him a little for it. Not really, but he shifts in Steve's lap to get his revenge, causing the younger man to suck in a sharp breath as his undoubtedly still oversensitized cock gets jostled with the movement.
Pepper said. That's easy enough. The scent neutralizer makes him feel all sorts of gross, but he’ll have to put up with it one way or another. No way he can say ‘no’ after Pepper’s gone all out to get him some convincing fake booze to carry around a glass of for show.
without sounding all that desperate and melodramatic, so he's going to stick with easy-going.
"So, let me get this straight one more time: You returned the Tesseract to where it belonged at the time, which, as you've established, was the bunker in Camp Leigh. And then," Fury chuckles, and Steve doesn't like where this is going. "And
Point taken. Tony shrugs.
So much so that when their ideals didn’t align like they should, it threw them for a loop. Not because they weren’t used to clashing with the force of stars colliding, but because everything evolved alongside their relationship. Every feeling, good and bad.
separation — w. s. merwin
It takes a little encouragement to get him to move. Tony's grip on the armrest is white-knuckled, fingers digging into the leather; his flesh hand leaves a dent but the metal one rips a hole into the stuffing. He uses it for support to heave himself up, up, up until Steve's slid out most of the way, then whimpers when he goes back down, gnawing at his lip until blood colors it as red as the lipstick does Romanoff's.
Then however, his eyes narrowed, observing the man in front of him with a calculating gaze until all of a sudden his complacent grin took its place on his face yet again.
Then however, Steve has the audacity to pull away entirely, leaving his now proudly standing erection glistening with spit against his belly. Tony groans at the sudden loss of stimulation, ready to complain, but the words get stuck in his throat when the reason for Steve's retreat becomes clear.
"Steve," he moans, dropping his head and clawing the edge of the sink to his right as Steve teases his cockhead into the cleft of his ass.
Tony watches, admittedly a little dumbstruck, as the man draws closer. For a moment, he thinks Rogers will deck him, no holds barred, and
It’s an instinctual response – of course it is. There’s nothing else to do for him here than comfort the heat-ridden omega and ensure he is content even after the act is over with, like nature has engineered him to.
Steve sighs, fondly exasperated, misconceiving his tentative denial as a joke. “I’m honored your dreams are so vivid when I’m not around, but you promised me to be more careful.”
He's lowered his voice to a whisper, wanting to disturb the other inhabitants in the wagon as little as possible. It isn't about privacy – there's no privacy here. Whatever you're doing, whenever you're doing it, people are going to know. At some point you either stop caring or you go insane. Everything he can hope to do now is keep the noise down and not wake everyone in the vicinity. (No sleep is bad for morale.)
Tony's voice is strikingly neutral; he's leaning against the wooden pillar at the porch, facing Steve as he balances a basket of laundry at his hip. He just finished collecting clothes (that had been soaked in the squirt gun incident) from the clothesline outside and seems to have only spontaneously been struck with the thought of informing him about SHIELD's nearing arrival.
"Sounds like a plan."
is everything his vocal cords accomplish, although the sound might've been more of a howl if he wasn't gagged. After a couple of heaving breaths, he collapses in exhaustion, muscles going limp all the sudden.
That man staring back at him from the mirror like he's some idiot. A squishy, soft-around-the-middle idiot.
It’ll
In the end, he decides omelets with bacon and vegetables should be doable. As Steve gathers everything he needs on the counter, he stumbles upon another question: would it be rude to cook just enough for himself? Or would it be rud
If anything, Maria looks more sceptical than before. In his defense, nobody ever tells you there might come a day when you’re going to have to explain the concept of a multiverse to a five-year-old, even if aforementioned child may very possibly be brighter than most her age.
Tony feels his grip spasm around the thick leather of the journal. He expected it. He doesn't know why it feels like he's choking around nothing (nothing but the betrayal and
"You're saying his–"
"My one condition being that you keep this thing up," Tony says, going for casual as he waves his hand around in front of him in a way of extremely poor explanation.
Rogers pauses. Then, he does smirk. A subdued one, but it's there.
That makes him an egoist, possibly. Or an asshole. Or a coward. Or all of those combined; little bit of everything, maybe?
Thanos comes with an army and four Infinity Stones.
They both contemplated this for a moment, the words settling heavy in the room, crawling away and squeezing in-between the cracks of the old stone and the graves within.
“Why are you allowed to worry and I’m not? That isn’t fair,” she says, sounding genuinely upset.
He isn't, but he sees the sharp glint of self-deprecation in Tony’s eyes anyway, and grasps his hand that has formed a fist laying on the mattress in front of him. Tony doesn’t find a reason to resist, so he lets Steve’s palm cover the back of his hand and guide it up to lay over his chest–right there above his heart.
“I’m not gonna say it, I won’t–no, you know what,
The other man sighs, but although his expression shows annoyance, his body grows rigid at the implication that Steve isn’t taking him by his word. His hand moves to scratch the back of his neck but the attempt is thwarted by the rope tying his wrists to one another, and so he yields to the pull and aborts the movement.
"I– yes."
Steve feels his mouth fall open. Steve can tell he's pushing himself up from his seat. Steve hears the chair slide back and topple over with the force of it.
couldn't be a problem, well, there's a first time for everything.
When he slows, Steve notices the imprints in the dry grass as well and looks around, then shrugs.
In the beginning, Tony works.
Steve shuffles far enough back on the bed he can maneuver them into a different position. It’s only for a moment, but as Tony gets on his hands on knees and Steve slips out of him in the process, the feeling of emptiness is overpowering. He’s become so used to the intrusion that now, his insides feel incomplete, open, stripped apart and dripping as he is.
He pulls through, because it’s Tony, and if he can’t, who possibly could? Tony makes it out the other side, except his hollowed, bloodshot eyes talk not only of loss and defeat but also a bitter, quiet acceptance that scares Steve to death. He never thought he'd see the day where he looks at Tony Stark and has the broken shell of a man who once stood tall and proud even in the face of doom and destruction look back at him, but he finds out that there is indeed a first time for everything.
"You have to understand, Tony. It was the only way. I needed to be there to protect you. Nobody else could, certainly not him. I'd know. I was him."
He traces it with the pads of his fingers, feeling along the nubs that are just slightly raised above the pitted skin and wonders if the torture Stark’s subjected himself to measures up to the one he’s lived. Who's to say? They might not be so different after all.
His stomach rumbles in protest as he makes his way down the painfully noisy stairs, reminding him just how long ago his last meal has been. His metabolism calls for a lot more than just three meals a day, and he hasn’t even gotten those in the last twenty-four hours. Steve tries to ignore the pangs in his empty stomach. He can hardly plunder Tony’s fridge, and it’s not like he hasn’t had to go without eating for much longer periods of time in the past.
When he approaches the kitchen, the feeling of being watched doesn’t vanish; if anything, it grows into something even stronger, like eyes boring into his back. And yet, no matter how many times he checks, he can’t make out what triggered this sudden paranoia. Steve decides to get the sole reason for his coming down here over with and grabs a glass for himself. He fills it with water from the faucet and empties its contents in quick succession, swallowing the cold liquid down greedily.
Tony knows that sometimes, he'd indulge a little too much.
The knight remembered spotting him at the very front of the crowd that had come to watch Strange use his abilities to save Anthony from certain death, but had not paid any further attention to his rather unobtrusive looks.
Although it's obvious the inquiry is an attempt at deflection, Steve lets it slide. For the moment. Tony isn't delusional enough to think this isn't bound to come up again during the course of the evening. At the time being though, Steve only meets his gaze in the mirror with a dark, heated gleam in his eyes that sends a buzz zapping through Tony, and slides both hands underneath his thighs to pick him up in a sitting position.
boring.
Natalia could swear the knight, as he stood out there and endured the audience's cheers, smiled fondly and
The broken trap, made from scrap metal that under Tony's hands found purpose again, has a locking mechanism that will usually cause the jaws to snap close but is now malfunctioning. Steve shows it to Tony, and it's clear the man immediately knows what needs fixing because he's quick to assemble all the spare materials and tools he needs.
smell like you haven’t showered in a decade– Oh, wait. Right. That’s because you haven’t.”
If Tony hadn't been painfully aware of how not qualified he was for this job, he sure would've been then.
Except he's Iron Man, and his core is fucking Iron Man-grade, and his body should be Iron Man-esque too. Nobody without some proper abs, obliques and back muscles can pilot a half-ton, flying exoskeleton, so why doesn't he look the part? It's so far from fair Tony feels those traitors of tears stinging in his eyes again.
The sensation was amplified hundredfold that very next moment, as the body around him trembled violently, Tony's walls tightening weakly as his every muscle tensed and he came with a keen that sounded of pure euphoria.
He doesn't know how long he waits for something to happen, but his inner clock tells him it's been something close to two hours when the door swings open. Steve immediately shoots up to see who's on the other side, wary, bracing himself for the worst.
enamored thing. It is also when Steve looks at him that his erection gives a twitch within Tony, and
"You'd not believe if I told you, my friend," he said, addressing Von Doom above all else, "but the high an' mighty Lord Anthony has quite enough dark and dirty secrets himself."
"Why'd you have to ruin it?"
without moving
The street lantern on the main road behind Steve throws his shadow on the rain-slick ground in front of him, a long and misshapen copy of himself. Stark’s just there at the head of it, give or take twenty feet away.
Tony guides him up the stairs and to a room on the righthand side of the upper floor. It has a roof slope that makes the space look smaller than it is; there’s a single bed in one corner and a row of cupboards and bookshelves on the opposite wall. A skylight drenches the room in soft daylight, highlighting the dust particles floating in the air.
and rocks them both a little, back and forth and back and forth.
Of course, he neither stopped to invent technical marvels nor did he discontinue to utterly disregard societal norms. Soon after having put Ms. Virginia in charge of not only the castle’s but also most of his land’s finances, he agreed to integrate a very determined and very capable hired sword into the ranks of his household guard. (James openly gaped when he came to know her name.)
Tony wakes with a headache pounding behind his temples that makes him wish he could drift off to sleep again.
do, really.
Steve's worry and unsolicited sympathy is all too evident when he looks at Tony and the mess he is: bags under his eyes, three days of grease and sweat stains on his shirt and possibly a manic glint in his gaze.
does he miss his shield. Steve scans his surroundings and listens for sounds until he’s convinced himself whatever he saw must’ve been his imagination playing a trick on him. God knows it's no wonder he's out of it with everything that happened.
It was no secret among the people that Anthony Stark of Mar'vill had yet to take a lady wife, and so high and small lords from the farthest corners of the kingdom would leap at every opportunity to introduce their dear daughters to the Man of Iron, hoping one of them arouse his interest.
The one time the physician looked up from his work to ensure his patient was still faring comparatively well, the man had taken hold of Sir Rogers' hand and was digging clawed fingers into his skin with a strain that turned his knuckles white.
– but when he actually arrives, it's not with his fist in Tony's face. Instead, he grabs him by both shoulders and draws him impossibly, indecently close, blue eyes flitting over Tony's features for some unbearable seconds that last forever. Tony's gaze involuntarily drops down to the man's lips, like iron being drawn to a magnet. He feels warm breath grazing his skin and desperately tries not to think about how easy it would be to bridge the remaining distance between them.
“Me,” Peter rushed to say. The Lord, understandably, did not believe him until he had explained the functionality of the device to him in an amount of detail that only its creator would be capable of.
Tony’s lips tick upward just so and he grabs a plate for himself, only convinced once he’s given the omelet a taste. He hums approvingly. “Might make you stick around against your will if you turn out to have a secret knack for cooking,” he jokes, ignoring the sudden change in the atmosphere and the way the air seems to settle heavier around them whenever they’re alone in the same room together with their focus solely on each other. Steve knows, rationally, that it’s only a projection of his own discomfort, but it’s hard to pretend like that doesn't make it real.
A year ago, he would've traded the wormhole for any other dreamscape in a heartbeat, ignorant to the reality that for one monster to replace another, it needs to be capable of much greater atrocities than its predecessor. (The Ten Rings, the Chitauri, Steve. Somehow Steve is always the superlative, be it as a soldier or a nightmare.)
He meets Steve's eyes again and there's guilt in the twisted line of his lips. Which is precisely what Steve sought to avoid, but he's never been as good at camouflaging his emotions as Tony's known to be.
"No, still Steve Rogers. But probably not the Steve you know," Tony flinches at that, "or the Steve you, uh, knew."
He merely took one last look at Lord Rhodes with a spark of mischievous humor in his eyes and pointed them both to seats close to the head of the table, at which roast turkey and various side dishes were already being served.
Despite the pain in her eyes, her words aren't full of pleas and regrets. Steve realizes the things he meant to say are
Stark? Stone's omega?"
–handsome just for you, how's that feel?" Tony asks, hoarse, and that's when Steve bows over him and cries out as he climaxes. He comes in a steady pulse, coating Tony's insides with another layer of his come, another irrefutable token of his attraction.
Some of his inner devastation has obviously translated onto his face, because Steve crosses his arms over his chest and chuckles, a little sympathetic but mostly amused.
Long before the Earth froze over in the aftermath of a failed, last-ditch attempt to curb catastrophic global warming, Stone had begun to promote this project as his, and his alone: A train track circumventing the entire planet with a one-mile train running on it that would be entirely self-sufficient in its power, food and water supply.
Steve flips him over. Stark pants in both fury and immediate fatigue as he writhes on the floor while his body is arranged to Steve's liking, "At least have the
Insignificant–at least that's what it should be, right? Two words. Unimportant. Speaking them out loud means nothing. It doesn't prove or change anything. So why is it so hard to meet Steve's one condition?
There's times where he's dangerously close to losing his grip on himself, but he has already had quite enough practice when it comes to holding back certain urges and this isn't all that different. It's another kind, but the want, the carnal need is the same, and Tony is an expert in biting his cheek bloody while he crushes the unwanted underneath his mental boot.
And so he nods. "Five minutes."
Now that he’s got the time and space needed to look at his situation from a more fact-bound perspective, a few positives come to light. He could do without going back to SHIELD, of course, but if getting poked and prodded for a while and having a highly confidential heart to heart with Fury to prove the legitimacy of his identity will ultimately help convince them to get him back where he’s come from, that’s something he’s willing to take upon himself.
He holds back, collects himself even as Tony throws his head back and scatters wet, desperate kisses under his chin and everywhere else he can reach.
Although he was careless in many ways, this was not one of them. Not even Lord Stark would simply appoint an heir on a whim; no, this was his life blood. If he considered Peter to be fit to follow in his footsteps, there had to be solid reasoning supporting this arbitration.
Anthony E. Stark, on Hi-dra’s radar for multiple decades and Steve's personal target for close to a month, pushes aside the manhole cover in the dirty back alley below and, after a brief glance at his surroundings, crawls out like the sewer rat he is.
He peels the dented casing open and gets even more distracted by the things it contains.
Stark gets his act together a few days after, and he’s acting like he’s being made to do the walk of shame even though nobody really looks at him twice – no more than they usually do, in any case.
The force of his climax hits Steve unexpectedly. Tony’s body tenses as he collapses face forward into the pillow, fingers fisted in the soft material as he shakes through it, going quiet after an initial, drawn-out groan.
‘One day’, in this equation, was always an undefined variable. Undefined, far away, a distant point in the nebulous future they weren’t even sure to reach. ‘One day’ was a term he didn’t waste a thought on, most days, knowing that entertaining it would mean to lose sight of their single priority: survival.
Tony bites the inside of his cheek, forcing himself not to fall for the derisive tone.
“Tony is omega, right? That’s– He did have the baby. Like it’s described here?”
“Alright, Tony. Nice to meet you.”
Right now, there's only one thing he wants to address.
Steve stays behind, among rubble and dust, and the grief turns into anger and frustration. He holds back a scream, his fingers digging sharply into his gloves instead.
Tony doesn't groan in frustration, but it's a close one. Sure, it's necessary, a reasonable solution without doubt, but – Christ, he hasn't slept properly in weeks, and now he's, what, on guard duty because local wildlife decided to go for the easiest available dinner?
It's not his right to feel blindsided, because he isn't. He knew this was going to happen – Tony announced they'd work with them from the get-go. As much as he wants to (wants nothing more, in fact), he can't hide out here forever. Not to mention that's not who Steve is; he might want to hide and pretend, but at the end of the day, he's going to go out and face the music. Get it done and over with, ugly as it may be.
With a sigh aimed at no one, Tony calls it a day and pats DUM-E in passing as he exits the workshop. His concentration nosedived a while ago and he should put something on that burn. Steve's bound to get back home soon and if he sees it, he’ll scowl at Tony in that half-concerned, half-disappointed way of his and won't be persuaded into reunion sex until he’s played nurse.
you even think, or is that the road less traveled in these parts?"
It's sudden, but Tony sure isn't opposed to it. When is he ever? His dick is already beginning to harden, pressed against the kitchen counter, and he groans as he rocks into it and then into Steve's hand as it cups him through his boxers.
do this all day, blue balls be damned. He'd probably remain right on the brink of breaching him, just to prove a point. It should be maddening (it is), except this isn't about Steve being his usual bull-headed self. Tony doesn't approve of his methods, but he is doing this
“But we'll be prepared and we’ll be together, and that’s all that matters.”
Steve thinks it strange that these should be the only major things amiss, but Tony was very adamant about not wanting to speak of the Accords and everything that came after and Steve isn’t so insensitive as to straight out ask him about Afghanistan, so he brushes off the thought.
is how it's going to be tonight.
beautiful.
Tony is loathe to see him this distraught, even after their falling out. Siberia should’ve driven the point home that the man's feelings didn't run as deep as Tony needed them to–and yet here Steve is, crying for him, proving him wrong. Tony joins, although the tears aren’t for himself but rather ones of joy as he understands Steve cares more than he ever believed possible, and ones of sorrow as the realization hits him that it won’t matter either way.
"Come and get it, soldier," he murmurs into the other's mouth, meeting his next stroke hard enough their skin slaps together loudly in the room's silence. It does an excellent job at driving the point home.
Tony looks back at Steve, the shine of unshed tears in his eyes. He understands. All of a sudden, the picture of his mother fades into a flash of colors, thousands of different faces looking back at them at once. Steve's grip tightens almost unbearably, but Tony can't conjure the presence of mind to complain.
"Out. It will only be five days, you are going to be fine if you listen to Ms. Potts. She knows the ways of the castle better than I do, most days."
“He’s asking for you,” the alpha tells him, voice strikingly level. What she says surprises him, but the things she’s
How can’t it, when this small, tired, grieving Tony looks just as heartbroken as he's been feeling during the worst of times?
Still, after a few years of living, fighting and approaching one another in more ways than one, they had made it to a point where they at times were alike to the Asgardian soldiers in Thor's raunchy stories.
Sensing Tony’s presence, Steve's head twitches just so in his direction, his eyes lingering on the Skull for a moment longer before he looks over at Tony.
He shudders, but Steve holds him tight as the world shifts and they suddenly find themselves on the grass beneath. The ground is cool but soft, familiar and unlike everything in the environment of this spaceship that Tony has learned to view as a blessing and a curse all at once. He feels himself tremble and is aware it’s not only a reaction to the chilly breeze blowing around them.
Tony's beginning to think maybe he walked into that one.
Steve removes his knife from the sheath strapped to his thigh, takes a few steadying breaths and begins to dig for the implant in his neck.
The stains on Steve’s grey sweatshirt are the same color as the wild roses growing in the front yard of the family home they’ve been camping out in for months now. Splotches of vibrant red on a drab canvas. Only the stains aren’t stains anymore; the front and the sleeves are virtually drenched in blood, most of it Tony’s but some his own.
For some reason, he feels Steve smiling against him at that.
When the other doesn't respond, he keeps going, searching his pockets for the bundle of dollar notes. "Whiskey, maybe gin. A few bottles to get us through. It's a little dreary at times, up there, and– we'd appreciate it."
Steve stares.
Positioning himself at the foot of the cot, he searched Anthony's eyes in silent question, the other nodding curtly and giving him permission to proceed.
Steve lets himself fall back into the leather cushions of the chair and clasps his hands on the table in front of him. For a few seconds, he breathes, lets the anger roll off his shoulders.
Steve doesn’t respond and instead presses a kiss to his forehead.
And yet, he's here, crammed in a tiny space with this defiant, irritating, loud-mouthed omega turned into a shivering, helpless, wanton one. It's wrong to want it this much, Steve knows that. Depraved is what it is, but he can't help it – he runs his fingertips down Stark's spine, just grazing the heated skin, from the curve of his neck to the small of his back but no further. The body underneath him trembles in anticipation and finally, Stark bites out a frustrated whine, opting to rut against the sheets below him.
and then opts to take matters into his own hands, shoving his hips back and forth to get some more of the desired friction.
"And she's–"
Tony doesn’t think, because Steve gets to play vigilante on the other side of the ocean while he’s here
He knows Steve’s willpower is wearing thin, can feel it in the harsher, faster thrust of the fingers in him and the way his breathing picks up. “I’m done, c’mon, it’s been so long, Steve–”
She doesn't seem to intend to get hung up on the technicalities in any case, because her main concern is of an entirely different nature, "I heard you talk, and daddy said you'll have to leave again. I know he's sad. I don't understand why he wants you to go."
They're not prepared.
With a soft click, the door falls shut, and Steve finds himself alone.
Let’s just say the reaction he gets isn’t quite the one he expected. Instead of rolling his eyes or sighing in long-suffering exasperation, Steve’s smile remains stapled onto the sinful curve of his lips. Almost like he’s got another card to play, and it’s one that’ll win him the game.
Maybe, he needs it to mean something. Like his going into the ice and waking up seventy years later needed to mean something. Like Tony's death needed to mean something.
With a frantic kind of energy that borders on the edge of desperation, Steve’s hand comes up and cups his cheek, stroking the all-too prominent bone there with gentle brushes that have nothing in common with the undiluted panic his bobbing throat and widening eyes communicate. He’s trying, for Tony, to hold back. Appear calm, provide comfort. Too bad Tony can read him like an open book.
The knight cleared his throat to shed the all too telling rasp he knew his voice must have taken on – although it would do little to aid him deny Anthony's bold proposal, seeing as his body had already betrayed his interest.
He grumbles a little but enjoys the pleasant warmth trapped under the covers despite the noticeable lack of Steve's familiar shape next to him. (He hasn't given up hoping for a day their tumble in the sheets will burn off enough energy for Steve to skip his thirteen morning miles. It'll be like Christmas, but better.)
Maybe that is an exaggeration. Rogers, underneath the impenetrable layer of grime and stoicism, seems like a nice enough character. Tony doesn’t get many glimpses of it, but there’s a certain softness, something delicate and kind that has maybe been curbed like Tony’s drive to create has a long time ago. It shows when he is interacting with animals; his horse, first and foremost, which he makes sure is cared for above all else and murmurs encouraging or apologetic or humorous things to depending on the situation.
to such a degree is not sitting right with him. At least Steve remains Steve, at his core. Stronger, better, more efficient and some would argue more brutal, but it’s what was already there that has changed and improved.
If you ask him, mastering indifference is key, and he’s the best in this métier for a reason. This line of business punishes the ones who wait, who pause and hear both sides, who allow doubt to tarnish the simplicity of the mission.
After short rest, a brown slop that barely qualified as coffee and a conversation Tony had forgotten the moment he stepped back outside, the man showed them to the back of the hut, where a small roofing shielded half a dozen mules from the worst of the cold. Four of them were entirely packed with hay bales, the other two carried supplies and equipment under thick, dirty-white canvases.
He suppresses a moan, but a small, breathy huff still escapes through his clenched teeth. Tony feels his fingers dig painfully into the bark of the tree he's holding onto while his other hand is clenching harder around his length, trying to get the most pleasure out of the last, frantic strokes.
The steady incline wears all of them out – rider and animals. To battle the effects of exhaustion, they take breaks more often, and the sun slowly but gradually descends from its highest point in the sky. It worries Tony, but he thinks they would’ve persevered nevertheless and made it back by nightfall.
Tony pretends to think, then smirks.
There's a certain wariness about the men when they first see him – their chatter ceases and one of them leans into the others' space to mutter something as they approach.
After that, he's lead to a conference room, where he doesn't come face to face with Fury but instead a trio of agents, two men and a woman, the latter of which is sitting at a virtual keyboard. They sit him down – there's a hundred-ounce bottle of water and a cup in front of him – and ask him to retell every major event that occurred in his timeline. Yes, that includes everything before his waking up from the ice – he did, in fact, get frozen as well, no?
Tony just sits there, dazed, face buried into the man’s coat to escape the snowflakes grazing his skin like thousands of needles. He knows he should stay awake – although he can’t remember why, when sleep is so much more pleasant – but everything is a dull, slow haze, and the comfort of safety makes him think it’ll be alright to doze off. He can, now. Rogers is here now and he’ll be here later, when Tony wakes up.
Steve's eyebrows finally uncouple from another, but it's only to travel all the way up his forehead instead. His gaze flits over Tony’s features, almost like he’s searching for something to indicate that Tony is making a joke at his expense.
Carol did not care for their approval in any case. She was happy about the camaraderie of the few that had reconciled themselves to her presence, but everything else did not matter long as she remained fit to serve in the guard.
When Steve sees it, he knows he isn't dreaming. Only reality has the potential to this kind of cruelty, to take and ruin without hesitation.
The Steve in the recording laughs.
Ask him again today and the answer might be a different one.
He gives Steve the shield back. Steve doesn’t have anything to return except for a stammer and an incredulous smile as he takes the familiar weight of it out of Tony’s hands.
The answer to all the vaguely interwoven questions in her mind came in form of one Lord Justin Hammer the following day. She misliked that truth more than she could say; this man was what she had once feared Anthony Stark might be, yet many times the worse. His person in itself was intolerable, self-serving and presumptuous. His smile was an empty one and his quick tongue only spit lies and deception.
"I knew you were judging my taste in men, but this is a bit much."
Coding new safety protocols is a reasonable countermeasure and also alternative to letting the Avengers know. They argued about it again just last weekend ("There's a pattern here. Whatever their goal is, it's something to do with me. Not the Avengers." – "What if it's about getting to the Avengers through you?" – "So you're just concerned about what this means for the Avengers?") and although Tony won him over with the compromise that they'd come clean about everything the moment anything remotely suspect happened, the peace of mind he’d been expecting to find didn’t make an appearance.
He ends his speech with an 'I love you three thousand', and although the words and what they imply seem to be mainly directed at his daughter, Steve feels himself tear up at the sincerity in his voice and the softness of his smile.
Ouch. Steve chuckles, but promptly swallows the noise when she shoots him a disgruntled look, eyes distinctly narrowed. Right, how dare him? This is a serious matter.
Bruce soon came to know that the Lord had always loved riding, and he had always loved his horses. The man claimed he'd grown up on horseback, though it stood to reason that he had spent more time in the back of a wheelhouse than on the horse itself.
Tony does.
Steve, who kneels by his side and knocks his bloodied knuckles against Tony's chest and looks at him with glassy, reverent eyes. "It's in there, isn't it? There always was too much, more than even the universe could handle. So, one day, it decided you had to go. Can you imagine?"
The wording makes Steve blink and his throat tighten uncomfortably, and even more so when he realizes the last sentence was meant for him more than it was for Maria.
favor for a change, Tony somehow manages to do the impossible and turn the tides.
Tony's bottom lip wobbles. He sees it in the mirror. Yikes. What is it with the mood swings today? This is a bit much even for him, and he doesn't have the excuse of being pregnant nor a toddler.
It was during their journey that Anthony and the swordsman first made each other’s acquaintance. James was tending to the horses at the end of a long day of uninterrupted travel when he witnessed the incident.
With time, Tony can move about on his own again, which gives Steve the freedom to do so as well. He doesn’t dare stray too far from the house, but patrols the surrounding area as usual again and their home feels safer for it. Once he is steady on his feet, there’s nothing Tony insists he can’t do by himself: changing his bandages, cooking their food, and finally, repairing a broken trap that Steve brings from the woods.
After five years, Scott Lang (re)appears, and his clumsy explanation of how the Quantum Realm might be able to send them back in time spikes a flame of hope nobody would've thought possible.
Like the calm before the storm, Stark's suddenly motionless, breath shallow, muscles and tendons straining and releasing like it takes his all not to tense up entirely. "I got'chu, let go," Steve assures him, just a hint of firmness in his voice. He nips at the skin behind Stark's ear. "There's a good fella, Stark. Tha's it."
Carol perked up. "Danvers. Carol. My Lord."
"Sir Rhodes, I believe it is your Lord's intention that you be promoted in rank," he began.
“Like I said, it’s not much, but make yourself at home,” Tony says, walking over to the bed to swipe his palm over the surface of the nightstand. More dust swirls through the room as he does, testifying just how scarcely this part of the house receives guests.
His early departure comes with a price, because despite the long journey, he waits another two hours or so until Cannon's men show up. Tony snaps out of his half-sleep with a jerk when he hears the voices of riders approaching, and straightens hurriedly. Without anything else to do, he's been dozing off leaning against Butterfingers' warm shape for some time.
. It turns out it wasn't just paranoia that Tony felt back there, because that's a wolf alright.
In lieu of acknowledging the subliminal statement in Steve’s words, Tony responds to the more surface-level message. “Mh–how about you make use of it, then?”
As night falls, Tony finds himself looking out the window repeatedly, always checking for the single, small glimmer of light that belongs to Rogers' fire at the camp. He eats a single serving of canned beans, grimacing at the taste all the way through, and has to wash the bites down with swigs of whiskey. Only when he can hardly keep his eyes open does he leave his seat by the window.
Eventually, Steve regains control over his limbs again and pulls out gingerly. They’ve already made a mess, so it’s not like him watching the come drip out and down Tony’s balls does anything that hasn’t already been done. Tony chuckles hoarsely as he realizes what he’s doing, but bats his hand away when Steve tries to fondle the sensitive, swollen pucker of his asshole. Worth a try.
So this is how it'll be.
Beside drawing, Maria has also helped him prepare breakfast multiple times, glad to find someone already up in the kitchen as she came downstairs. (Tony hasn't outright mentioned it to him, but he's definitely benefited from the fact that he isn't being dragged out of bed every day anew at what he'd consider the asscrack of dawn.)
His train of thought comes to an abrupt halt when Steve jumps and disappears from his field of vision in a split second, because-- he can't do
Rogers' expression is one of concern – Tony has figured it out now, that his frowns often aren't truly angry but rather a misdirected attempt to show care he doesn't know how to express otherwise. (Tony might be a menace, but Steve Rogers is an enigma.)
He only grunts in acknowledgement when Tony slaps a ten-dollar-bill down in front of him to settle his debts, and then makes off with the money clutched in his fist. The guy's an asshole and doesn't particularly like him, yes, but since Tony's a regular and always pays up, the service is good enough.
, do it, don't stop–don't want you to stop even if I tell you–"
After the third time, Stark declared he had no need for Steve’s
In an attempt to discourage her, a few knights began to jokingly refer to her as
Rogers cares. He cares
Tony doesn't let up. If anything, he seems more wary. "So, what? Is this–
charming, are you now, Steven Rogers?”
When he nods slowly, Tony continues, “So, we had Maria. We had all of that, for five years. And, well, you know what happened after.” Tony swallows audibly; his eyes have turned glassy, and they’re swimming with tears when he turns toward the blue light of the holograms.
There's no time to be wasted, Steve knows that. Carol has a spark in her eyes that tells him she'll pounce at him in the next five seconds, and Bucky is already on the move, only a few feet separating them.
The realization hits him like a punch in the gut and takes his breath away in the worst way possible.
Turns out, that mounting sense of foreboding he felt on their hike up the mountain wasn't just the general anxiety he's had nestled in the back of his head ever since starting this suicide mission.
She had long stopped to care for others' criticism of her ancestry. The S'vjetians were rulers of the Frost Lands across the sea, had been for centuries, and many in the Kingdom of Shields feared them as raiders and savages that brought forth wildlings and warrior brides. Maybe they were wild, Natasha mused, but no more and no less than the people in these lands.
"Talk to me, Tony."
Even if he wanted to drag this out, watch Steve scramble to deny the truth, he wouldn’t be able to concoct any elaborate schemes. Reduced to base instincts, everything that’s left is noise: his heartbeat in his throat, Steve’s too-loud movements in a too-silent room, his thoughts a thrashing mass of
Steve would've taken his place in a heartbeat if he could.
breakfast right about now.
“Is there anything you would like me to clarify or elaborate on, Captain Rogers?”
The shapes change, exploding into countless little fragments that then disappear one by one
Steve gets another cloth and soaks it in water, swapping it with the one currently placed on Tony's forehead that is warm to the touch.
Aforementioned owner, a balding man with a stocky build, a gut to match and no people skills whatsoever, has been tending the bar day and night ever since the fateful day Tony semi-purposely got himself stranded in Red Rock. Considering this place probably is the man's life blood, Tony can see how he would get a little defensive about its obvious rodent infestation.
, of all the things he's had to and been made to do in his life, he's got another thing coming.
Stark is slippery. And he has all the quirks of a man constantly made to look over his own shoulder: he’s meticulous in the way he keeps to himself, pedantic in his sharing of information and his travels to and from places in the city. Even the way he moves is ever-calculated, every step one taken after an instance of consideration. If he were to guess, he'd say paranoia is the man's middle name.
How do you admit to mistaking someone else for the man you love? How do you explain the
Tony grits his teeth. It's a lie. Saying it would mean lying. Not that he gets to pride himself on an immaculate clean slate when it comes to the act of telling (un)truths, but– But. Fuck it. This is ridiculous. He wants to get rawed right now. If Steve thinks he can't do
His finger is shaking. The other man raises a meaningful eyebrow at him, as if to say ‘There, you’re proving my point and contradicting your own’. He hasn’t budged an inch where he’s standing even in the face of Tony’s ire, and now too, his stance and face remain unmoving.
Bruce, Scott, Natasha and Clint are either people who’ll fit right into the scenery of Chitauri-infested New York City (Bruce, Nat, Clint) or are unobtrusive enough not to stand out at all (Scott, Nat, Clint). As a logical conclusion, Thor is revising Asgard with Rocket to keep him in check while Rhodey (air support) and Nebula (knows the place) went to Morag.
Tony thinks that might've been one of the better lies he's come up with. God knows he doesn't give two shits about who enters and leaves this establishment, but he'd rather tell the man that than the truth, which is that he's the first person Tony's found worth looking at ever since arriving in Red Rock.
Unsurprisingly, he can already feel an ache building up in his low back, and his neck has been stiff ever since their first go when he just
And then, a weak imitation of FRIDAY’s voice says, “Power depleted. Shutting down now, Boss.”
