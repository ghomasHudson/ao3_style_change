“Out of the way, Obadiah,” said a curt voice.
The feeling of being caged intensified. Tony half wished he had listened to Obie … if this was how life was going to be for him in England from now on, maybe he would be better off in New York after all.
Jarvis blinked rapidly. “Yes, I—yes, I am quite all right,” he said, and even managed a self-depreciating, little laugh. “My old mind must have done tricks to me after all this reminiscing.”
“James!” Sam called, turning around. “Where are you, man? Did you see that? With one blow, not bad, eh?”
“I wore it on a chain around my neck,” Tony spoke up and tugged down the collar of his hospital-issued shirt, “See these burns here? Funny, how metal conducts heat.”
“Take it,” he mouthed at Steve from the lower steps, and stretched his left hand out. On it was the bulb.
He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked jaundiced and ghostly under the artificial light of his father’s workshop, and they bore several scars that caught light at certain angles. He twisted around and tried to spy his reflection upon a wrench — but the distorted image served to only make his headache worse; it felt as though his brain was being squeezed by a vice. He had just rounded the table, thinking the new perspective would help, when he heard the grandfather clock in the hall chime: several rings too many to imply the hour was a respectable time to go to sleep at, and several times too few to legitimate pretending he had slept.
“It’s spot-on,” said Tony, who felt Rogers had overstayed his welcome; he made a meal out of watching Dummy chase the gardener and his hosepipe in the distance.
The men in question looked up when caught, standing by the showcase of the floral shop. It wasn’t Hammer, or Stone — it was, however, something almost as abominable. With a familiar expression of dark-lashed dislike, Inspector Rogers took in the streets spreading around him in either direction, until finally meeting Tony’s eyes, that narrowed behind his shades; even his occupied mind
Steve was breathing deep; there was a stitch in his side under his bruised chest that felt as though he had a blade between his ribs. Despite this, his arm stayed level as he pulled the hammer slowly back, using its heavy pull for emphasis, until they both heard it notch.
The Town Court echoed with voices as Steve made his way past its icy windows; winter was approaching fast. People unwrapped themselves from their protective layers as they sought for seats among the six rows of spectator seating, which faced the ungated judge’s dais, flanked by the witness table and the jury. Large groups of women tended to converge along the middle aisle, chattering excitedly, which caused blockages on Steve’s way to his seat among the witnesses; fortunately, however, very little people had gathered by the drafty windows, so that Steve was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate his way along the left wall.
“Yes,” Steve said finally, “I am.”
“Tony,” Steve begun slowly, “what’s wrong?”
“Taking a smoke?” repeated Coulson, incredulously. “I’m asked here for a trial from behind a, frankly, monstrous pile of paperwork and all I get is a bunch of no-shows? Now, you will fetch him here, or the next sentence I give, will come very much faster.”
it read.
“That’s not the interest I’m here to protect,” she told Tony. “Walked past the hall to see a dozen of them skitter thought like they were making mental notes to mark off furniture.”
“Standard procedure, huh? Okay, just put your foot under the other. Like climbing down a tree. Did your father ever teach you how?”
said Tony in such a voice that caused Steve looked up. “You stubborn—”
“Perhaps,” said Steve.
And although Steve had his retort ready for when Bruce asked him why he had not simply taken care of it each night, he did not need it: Bruce sat down facing him without a word once the new dressing had been finished. His hand still throbbed, but he was determined to be as detached from it as he was from the hollow in his chest.
No promises on a new Friday update this time 🙈 🙈 🙈
Steve walked along the shadows of the porches as quietly as possible, though some horses tied at the posts still snorted fright at the squeak of a board, the play of shadows whenever he passed a lamp. He crossed the mouth of an alley, ducked behind the porch of the townhall, a rail that hid him out of sight. He kept glancing up at Fury, who was walking back rather slowly while sorting his letters by priority … it just didn’t sit right given his earlier eagerness, somehow…
“If you think I regret our marriage, you’re not telling the truth,” Steve replied, affronted.
Soon he was hurtling along the carpeted corridor, at the end of which was—
Rogers gave Tony a cool, appraising look. Tony had the impression that the man was assessing whether it was beneficial opening hostilities this early on.
One word caught Steve’s attention and held it. “Ruthless?”
“Travel stress. You know how it is,” he explained. “I’m trying to ground myself, but you gotta admit, this house is damp.”
The man closest to him crouched down to Tony’s eyelevel. Tony, through the blurry gap of his undone curls, saw a face covered in receding grey hair and sparse-haired, pale brows on either side of a severe frown line. Stern smelled as he had done at the corridor: of martinis, strong cologne and sweat.
Tony’s eyes darted, fast as birds, over Steve’s features. “Steve?”
The finger stopped, and Tony’s weight shifted. Last, Steve registered something was being pressed to his balled hand: Tony’s ring, now clinking next to its twin.
Steve turned. Sharon Carter, a decidedly least spinster-like schoolteacher Steve had ever met, had broken free of the dancers and come to observe Steve’s skulking in amusement.
Ross had been one of the men he had stumbled into during all the stiff, decorative formalities that had followed his obtaining the medal for valor. As a former Senator and a Republican, he had been very vocal about advanced social justice. Had he angered the wrong people?
“And you saw nothing?”
“What—what is
“You are unhappy with my assumption,” Jarvis noted correctly. “Do you not trust its source? I
And then, before Steve’s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, Stane had beat him to Tony’s side. He was greedily eyeing the pieces of copper wiring seen though Tony’s shirt which had been torn, gaping open around his scarred chest. Stane, then, kneeled to tug an unseen piece of machinery off Tony’s unmoving body.
The observation felt as though it had rubbed salt into a wound Tony had not known existed; however, Tony rallied quickly.
Steve hastily wiped a wet cheek against the carriage’s wall and straightened. The window was blurred where his heavy breathing had fogged the glass.
“Ty?” he stuttered. “What?”
It’s almost clumsy … badly put together … as thought the goal was never to see you hang, but to point the focus on someplace else, away from something they do not wish us to see?”
“Well…” Steve began, watching Tony strut away, but Tony had undergone a startling return to his animated, rambling self.
“Oh, Toomes. Is your wife better.”
“I have here a simple document dated 13
Stane had passed through.
Tony recoiled. “That old
is clear?”
In which there is, unfortunately, more than one bed.
“Well, blow me,” said Tony. “You get about.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you for your cooperation,” said Bucky and brought his fist upon Rumlow’s head, whose eyes rolled back and went limp.
“Lucky me,” purred Tony.
“No, no, no, you’re not going to touch the Gainsborough without proper—”
“Ah!” cried Tony. “And that’s why you snooped around the study! They aren’t mine — well, technically speaking.”
Steve breathed.
Natasha, Steve couldn’t help but notice, looked rather flattered at this. Steve, feeling sore about the person whom he suspected to be the source of this rumor as well as the one concerning Tony’s involvement in arson, couldn’t quite muster similar regard.
“Everything all right?” called Tony, unable to stifle the amusement from entering his voice.
“No, it’s all right.”
“You yourself did not happen to notice, miss, when you later ran out of the rooms towards the noise in the hall, whether it had been used or left ajar at all?”
“Hey, pal,” he cheered in a drawl. “What a small world we live in, right? Right? As for myself,” he went on, rather importantly, “I’m here to collect a big order for a — well, I don’t know if you heard that it’s a grand time for a knees-up in honour of, well…”
“I—I have since the death of late Mr. Stark been taking sleeping powder, sir,” said Jarvis, as though admitting to something indecent. “The effects were just wearing off when I woke to shouts.”
“Was I ever tempted to do him in, you mean? Wondering what I’d have loved to see more than witness that stiff upper lip wobble?”
a certain group of people who have been monitoring a lot of potential threats closely. As of now, I can only reach them by mail. Whoever burned that bridge has made me a
Steve huffed. “You told everyone about that?”
The gardener was waving at him from outside, hovering by the flowerbed below the window. He was a simple man, who looked older than he must have been with his tanned and dry-skinned face, which was mildly peeling at his cheeks and wrinkled forehead.
He gazed at Tony, looking expectant.
With a soft creak, the bedroom door opened, creeping steps coming closer; there was an unmistakable sound of a hand trailing along the wallpaper.
And wasn’t that, thought Steve, the story of their entire relationship.
“Sorry, boys. It’s a busy day,” said Nat, striding to their table, and sitting down on what little bench space there was next to Steve. Through their clothes, their legs met from hip to ankle. “Comfortable?” she asked wryly.
Steve: *mumbling* I don't wike it
“How long did you serve?”
“I heard you once were close with Tiberius.”
“Water?” Steve asked, holding a cup for Tony to take.
"Yes, well,” Director Carter continued. “Agent Rogers has become increasingly devoted to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream. Are you familiar with the so-called ‘
“Alright, sorry, Doc,” Truitt said, putting his hands up defensively. “You just look awfully young, is all.”
Tony looked again and wrinkled his nose. The birds did have the same swelling that was present in each of the victims, and thankfully, he didn’t have to get any closer to see that. Rogers picked one of the birds up by the talons and wrapped it in a tarp in the trunk before slamming it shut and rounding back to the front of the car.
“What did you want to tell us?” Tony asked, trying to maintain professionalism even as his partner chugged his entire glass of water in five seconds as though he’d been in the desert for months. Rogers set his glass down so hard Tony was worried it might break, and then he focused on Theresa like she was about to tell him who killed JFK.
“Well, you’ve certainly got an impressive resume. And, if I may be frank, after some of the things I’ve heard about you from your supervisors, you’re much different than I expected you to be,” Director Carter said.
“You should know I’m not so easily swayed by ghost stories, Rogers.”
“Alright, did you find anything new?”
“I’m Jay Nemman, county medical examiner. You people think you can just come here and do whatever you please!”
Tony snorted and said, “So I’m here to discuss hobbies, then.”
“It looks like a check mark to me,” he said. “Like Nike.”
“Wait,” Tony said. “I think she’s talking about the same virus our victims had. Similar structure to the mumps?”
“Encephalitis,” he said.
“Can I ask you some questions, Lauren?” Rogers asked. She nodded. “Can you tell me what happened at your graduation party?” She frowned, and Tony watched her eyes become shiny with tears. He resisted the urge to turn away.
“Hard pass.” Tony snorted. “I already did my time at the Academy.”
“Do you think it could be arson?” Tony asked. If an accelerant were used, that would explain the speed of burning.
They went to Dot’s, a locally-owned diner in downtown Bellefleur. The diner was so brightly-lit that Tony felt as though he was blinding himself when they walked in. He wasn’t sure what Theresa meant by ‘a safe place’, but she had been adamant that they not talk in the parking lot. Rogers, of course, ate the whole thing up. Tony was skeptical, but he hoped she could tell them something they’re missing.
“Howard sees it as an act of rebellion,” Tony said. “But, to be completely honest, I saw the FBI as a place I could distinguish myself—separate myself from my father’s legacy. I wanted to make my own way in the world.”
“Seatbelt,” Rogers said, sounding not even the least bit shaken. “You know, Stark, a group of ravens is called a conspiracy.”
“You’re on call, Rogers. Get dressed,” he said, though if he were honest with himself, that would be the last thing he wanted Rogers to do. “There was an accident at the hospital.”
“Why did you think that?” Rogers asked.
Rogers fell asleep almost immediately after they boarded the airplane, spread out across three seats. Tony rolled his eyes, but he was ultimately grateful for the chance to work in silence and pretend he wasn’t working with the infamous Steve Rogers. He side-eyed the folder he’d dug out of Rogers’ desk, labeled
“Of course you do, Rogers.”
“Steven Spielberg,” Rogers teased from the other side of the door. Tony frowned and opened the door to find him standing outside in workout clothes. “I’m going for a run. Wanna join me?”
“No,” Tony confessed. “I only know him by reputation. He worked with the SSR during the Cold War—helped take down HYDRA in 1980. He had a nickname in the Academy…” Tony chuckled. “Spooky Rogers.”
Rogers tossed the can back in the trunk and pulled on the gloves, then said, “Don’t these birds look a hell of a lot like our victims?”
“Yes!” she exclaimed. “You’ve seen this before?”
“They deal with unexplained phenomena,” he said.
“Oh, great,” Tony sighed. “God, I hate hospitals. Okay. Give me twenty minutes; I’ll meet you outside.”
“No, Dr. Stark. And, I apologize if I’ve put you on edge. You’re here, in fact, because of your scientific mind. It’s my understanding that you have a special interest in… disproving claims of supernatural phenomena?”
“This is absolutely incredible, Stark,” Rogers said in awe, snapping another picture with the camera the local police had lent them.
“I was recruited out of school, ma’am. I wanted to serve my country, but I wasn’t cut out for the military. Guess I prefer silk sheets to army-issue cots.”
“Daddy, please,” she begged. “Let’s just go home.”
“That’s
that?!” Rogers exclaimed, scrunching up his nose at the foul smell of decay. Tony just stared, slack-jawed, unable to figure out if this was someone’s sick idea of a joke. The thing didn’t even look
“Are you kidding me, Rogers?” he snapped. “I suppose you think this is, what, some kind of extraterrestrial? It’s weird, and honestly kind of disgusting, but it’s definitely human. Now, remind me which one of us has a medical degree. I’m not staying here all night because you have a
Tony felt like the cat who got the metaphorical cream. Whatever positive karmic acts he had performed in a past life to deserve this opportunity must have been considerable. He didn’t want to jinx it, so he didn’t say what he was thinking:
he didn’t say. “So, wait, let me take a guess before you say anything else. You asked about my hobbies, and now you’re asking me about Rogers. I like those odds, so here goes: you want me to debunk the X-Files.”
“So, what is it?” Rogers asked impatiently, setting the camera down on the examination table. He was practically hovering over Tony, and Tony resisted the urge to tell him to fuck off.
“I guess that’s why you’re here, Doc.”
“Couldn’t the pathogen have caused this? You should do it for the sake of scientific discovery, and for the families of these kids, if not for me.” And Rogers had the gall to look so
“Shit!” Tony hissed. “My research! We have to go.”
“What?!” Tony asked. “I’d like to see an order from your boss.” She produced a piece of paper and handed it to him, but before he had even finished reading it, she took it back.
He bit his tongue.
And, there he was, Steve Rogers, looking every ounce the man Tony’s father had always described: tall, blonde, built like a brick wall, standing in front of a projector screen on the opposite side of the room. His back was turned to Tony, looking at an image on the screen of a young woman’s dead body sprawled in the dirt among fallen leaves. Her light brown hair fanned across her paper-white face, and her arm was twisted sickeningly underneath her body. Rogers finally turned to face Tony, who was standing, frozen, slightly nauseous in the doorway. He hadn’t expected to react so viscerally to seeing Rogers’ face, and he forced himself to move again.
“Whaddaya think, Anthony?” Rogers asked smugly.
“Oh, right, take a look. This is Karen Swenson.” He clicked a button on the projector, and if flipped to the next slide. The woman’s body had been turned over to show a close-up of two small red bumps on her inner left elbow. Her chin and neck, as well as her left calf, were so swollen they looked like balloons. “She was the fourth person in her graduating class to disappear under mysterious circumstances and turn up dead. What do you make of these marks?”
“What are the symptoms?” Rogers asked.
“Amy, come with me,” she said to the nurse. “Let’s give them some time to talk. The call button is right here above Michael’s bed if you need anything.” She closed the door behind her, leaving Tony and Rogers alone with the patients.
“You’ve only been with the Bureau for two years,” Director Carter noted, closing Tony’s file and looking at him from behind her glasses, analytical grey eyes sizing him up, “but your work at Quantico has already earned you quite the reputation. You’ve received glowing reviews from every one of your students. You graduated magna cum laude from MIT at fifteen, and you’ve since earned two doctoral degrees in medicine and electrical engineering. You’re the youngest agent we have ever had at the Bureau, and you were poised to take over the most successful weapon’s company in the world, but you chose not to. Why is that?”
“What happened?” Tony asked. Dr. Miles sniffled and looked up at him with misty eyes.
Rogers sighed, but Tony was right. They were almost certainly not going to get any verifiable information here. Still, he turned back to Lauren. She had her thumbs in her ears like she was blocking out a loud noise, and she was staring off into space.
Rogers got out of the car, and Tony followed, only to see the red X on the pavement that Rogers had drawn just two days earlier. The deer was missing one leg, and Tony could see it lying on the side of the road when he turned his head to the right. Rogers must have seen it, too, because he made an exaggerated gagging sound. He was just a bit green when Tony looked at him.
“She’s not lucid, Rogers. The doctor said it herself. Besides, it just looks like a check mark to me. It could be anything.”
“There was an accident at the hospital.”
“There was a fire at Ponderosa Lodge,” he said, then turned back to his conversation.
“Because I know who was driving the car that killed Lauren Burns. It was one of the men from the party—the ones that came and injected everyone.”
Director Carter closed the file and tossed it to the side, then leaned forward over her desk.
but he didn’t pick it up. The file contained all of the reports on the so-called Winter Soldier. Tony couldn’t help his curiosity, but he didn’t have the time. He had other things to work on, so he picked up
“I think it’s HYDRA,” Steve said bluntly. “A new disease no one’s ever seen before has their stench all over it. Could be getting ready for a new kind of warfare.”
“Or like Stark Industries,” Rogers said, accusatory.
“It’s okay, Doctor,” Rogers said, laying a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “Accidents happen.”
“I can’t say I’ve had the pleasure,” Tony says, mouth screwing up in distaste. “Until yesterday, I was just teaching at Quantico, but something tells me an educational cadaver is a whole lot prettier than a corpse fresh out of the grave.”
“I’m a paramedic, sir, not a firefighter.”
“I still think something weird is going on.”
She didn't want a compromise like the one that had been broken, she didn't want anything other than sporadic encounters, she hadn't said it out loud, but she had made it completely clear on Steve's skin and very surely some others Unnamed people who had hovered in the mansion.
Steve moves a little faster, a little stronger and now deeper, unable to take his eyes off, what her body causes and how she moves, Tony's hands move through her body, playing with Her breasts, running through her abdomen, touching her clitoris, is a small show, which is making it even harder to follow and just look at her.
Steve walks behind them, thinking about what he will write in the report.
They are at a time where Tony has not said "yes" to Steve yet and they have touched heaven, where Tony has not betrayed him and has taken them to hell, they have not entered into that damned vicious circle in which they touch and they break each other, where they always find a way to work until they don't and then they start the countdown until they are together again and promises are made that this time everything will be fine and they will not hurt each other again, although they know they are lies and in the end they will be worse than when everything begin again and only left to pick up the pieces and try to make it as good as possible to be able to go ahead with the wait (promise) of there will be a tacit question with a "yes" that it will take them to touch the heaven as an addict ready for their next dose.
Steve accepts it.
Tony's legs get tangled up in Steve's hips and everything is just rampant, Tony moves a little, lowering Steve's closure and releasing his dick, there's a denial somewhere with a red spotlight that lights up in the Steve's mind, a warning to stop, walk away and not compromise their relationship in this way, but Steve's only response is to put Tony's red panties aside and ram her.
He hasn't even started to really sweat and the anger is still there, flaming slowly, although now that all this disaster has happened a little, it may not be because of the agents or even Tony, maybe it's just the anger that He has never left at all after the war, there really is no clear answer and he only puts it aside.
He expect even worse things, not this, not her calm with guilt on her face.
Iron Man avoids him.
That time does not even spend more than two hours in that universe, because no matter how masochistic he is, it is too painful to see what could have been, but never will be.
And what started being something a little slower, that was meant to make her beg, ends up being fast, they both move to satisfy the desire for completion, she gasps and Steve takes her hips, touches her bare back with one of her hands, touching the reddish spots on her skin, he touches her and sees her twist a little to see him, with her red lips parted trying to hide her moans and her half-open eyes with the makeup slightly drawn.
Steve sighs and for a moment he allows himself to enjoy this, the camaraderie that they had lost, but she quickly hides behind the fissure that had been opened and leaves him outside, Steve can only see her go a little further in her old and entrenched customs .
"It's just an adventure, a one-time thing" he said as the only argument, it is something that will not be repeated because they are teammates, they are friends and Tony will move on to his next conquest before even Steve has the opportunity to rethink this whole thing and invite her on a date (or allow himself to simply fall for her).
-What do you want Stark? - he says sullenly, without much desire to apologize for hitting the agent.
Until it happens, it is not very certain who starts everything, as if they could not avoid being tempted, they take the first place available and simply plunder for what the other is willing to give.
“Take your time,” he said, and she sniffled.
“Good thing we got the accident insurance,” Rogers quipped, laughing nervously. Tony watched, confused, as he put the car in park and stepped out. He himself followed after and gagged at the sight of the swollen distended bodies of at least twenty ravens. When he averted his gaze, he saw Rogers open the trunk and pull out a can of red spray paint and a pair of latex gloves.
“Would you mind if we talked to them?” Tony asked.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked. “What just happened?” Rogers didn’t answer, just shook the can and painted a large X on the pavement. Tony found himself veritably shaken and irritated by the lack of response he was receiving. “Rogers, what the fuck was that?!”
“It’s one of the driest years in half a century, Rogers. Fire danger has never been higher. It’s a massive inconvenience, but it’s not all that surprising.”
as a raven hit the window of the car and rolled down the hood. Rogers averted panicked eyes from the road, and he and Tony made eye contact in the instant before a whole flock of ravens fell from the sky and rained down on the asphalt. Tony’s body jerked forward when Rogers stomped on the brakes and they squealed to a stop. There was a massive crack in the rental car’s windshield, and Tony’s heart was racing.
fault they were late. Him and those disgusting birds.
“It’s Ray Soames,” Tony said slowly. “The subject is human, and there’s nothing to suggest that the grave was desecrated. Jesus Christ, Rogers, you don’t have to stand so close. If you’d like me to leave so you can have some alone time with the corpse, you just have to ask.”
“They put the needles in us,” she said. “I don’t like needles.”
“And what is the stench of a dead Nazi organization?” Tony rolled his eyes. "What was the cause of death?”
sees this. You hear me? No one.”
“Morning,” Tony grumbled, and Rogers laughed.
“Great,” Rogers said. “I’m Steve Rogers. This is Tony Stark.”
“Of course, Director,” he said, trying not to sound too giddy. “It would be my pleasure.”
to you,” Tony said, as calmly as he could manage, pulling out his credentials from his suit coat pocket.
It was a fairly long drive back to the airport, and at one point, when Tony looked over, Rogers seemed like he might be nodding off. Tony tried to think of small talk he could make to keep him awake, but instead, he blurted out what he had been thinking since he first heard about Spooky Rogers back at the Academy.
“Good catch,” he says, albeit begrudgingly.
Rogers opened the file on his desk and scanned it.
“Okay, what are the odds?” Rogers asked once they were safely in the car. “The only person who gave us any information about that graduation party gets killed, and as soon as we leave to investigate, there’s a fire at our motel.”
“It’s pathogenic,” he said slowly. “Jesus, I’ve never seen anything like this. It could be an emergent disease. Maybe the wounds are from an animal bite? But all that swelling around her neck looks like mumps.”
the weirdo here, Rogers,” Tony snapped, still tense as he shoved the file into his seatback pocket. “Humans were not made to be this high off the ground, unless you count
Tony sighed and turned to storm back to where Rogers stood at the edge of the parking lot.
“No,” she said. “You’re here to discuss one of our other agents. Steve Rogers.”
“So why are you telling us now?”
She led them inside through two prison-like double doors and then down a long hall. She opened the door at the very end, where a young boy—no older than Tony—lay in a hospital bed. He remained catatonic as the nurse readjusted an IV in his hand. The girl—Lauren—sat in a wheelchair staring sadly at the TV. Tony frowned, and his face twisted in discomfort. Rogers didn’t even hesitate, though. He sat in the chair beside Lauren and smiled warmly at her.
Tony turned to watch the crew work, and he could see the webbing they were using to lift the coffing starting to get strained. He didn’t get the chance to say anything, though, before it snapped. The casket was dumped on the dirt beside the grave, and it fell open to reveal a body that could not possibly belong to a man who had died more than six months earlier.
“I’m guessing your alarm didn’t go off either?” he asked, and Tony shook his head. “Come on; we’ve gotta go interview those kids at the hospital.”
“Did you come home before sunset?” Tony said finally, jumping off of his elevated spot. “’Cause I came home before sunset.”
I'm so disappointed in myself. In my defense, though, the space fell clean off my 7 y.o. computer and I had to edit this with the stub that was left in its place. Sigh. You gotta work with what you've got, like they say.
And then the newly found well of astounding discoveries threw them another bucketful, and excitement rose inside Steve so quickly that he almost kicked Sam’s chair leg.
Happy rocked forward. The little girl was hurtling around his legs, squealing in delight and throwing herself into the arms of a laughing Scott, who lifted her up in one, smooth swing, crying, “Cassie!”
“It’s
“But this is just—just so
“Isn’t your three-year anniversary soon?” Clint suggested after a beat. “Maybe your boy’s cooking up a surprise,” he said, and made a vulgar gesture that suggested what kind of surprise he was envisaging.
The rustler hit the street with a sand-blowing thud.
“You expect to bust your way through just like that?” asked Nat, sounding amused.
Sorry it's been seven days, I was reading a really good fic and forgot I had to edit some parts of that Pym scene...
For several minutes, he sat and watched his father looking sternly upon the room. He felt much calmer, somehow, now that it was all official. And although the things he had pushed back to a ‘later time’ still felt insurmountable, knowing he had Obie there to guide him, soothed him. Tony looked at the desk. By each knee, there were four drawers, most of which he had already gone through, except for the last, locked one. He was gazing at it, remembering how a key had been handed to him, when he caught his father’s eyes again and walked to the portrait.
Indeed, when Steve pulled back, there still was a visible lack of relief on Tony’s face, although a new, healthier flush had worked its way under the bruises on his cheeks and—
“Much,” Steve admitted sheepishly, voice hoarse. He knocked back the new glass; it burned less the second time around. “Sorry I, uh, took it out on you.”
It was an odd moment. He and Tony had been briefly united against Stane—now the fact they used to be lovers came back to them both. Neither spoke, but there seemed to be an unwritten rule that one could look only when the other’s attention was elsewhere. Steve took full advantage of this, letting his eyes sweep over Tony’s bruised features once again; Steve felt the hit from the beam resonate in each of his own injuries.
A thick silence swelled, save for the intermittent soft whine and groan of the engine; Tony, arm resting on the door, drummed his fingers on it and watched the headlights reflect off the wet dirt. Every time Steve reached over for the gear by Tony’s right knee, their arms brushed.
“I think the smoke got into my eyes. It’s dark,” Sam remarked from behind Steve.
Bucky snorted rather unattractively. “You’ve obviously never been to the East Coast. It’s even
Rhodey did not want to hear this.
Perhaps it was the tone or the way in which the name had been spoken, that had Tony’s head snapping back to her.
“Right,” said Sam. “You’ve made your point, everyone’s met each other, and all is well in the world. Now, let’s move this reunion party someplace else—”
Steve stared at the cell wall, then made a grimace of frustration.
“Of course not,” said Tony, voice echoing in the hall; they had yet to get more than a few feet from the door.
More leisurely in his approach, Tony skipped down the staircase, adjusting his suspenders, and was just about to contemplate on putting on something more appropriate than his shirtsleeves, when he rounded the corner — and found her licking the hands of Inspector Rogers, who was bent over her wiggling form, with his hat removed at entry. His hair had fallen down his forehead; pieces of it were standing up from static.
“Hello?” Rogers said. “Layperson here. Could someone explain this to me?”
“I’ve already arranged to have the other bodies exhumed… You’re not squeamish about that sort of thing, are you?”
Nothing in the file leapt out as a potential lead. It
Theresa and Tony ordered coffee—hers black, his with cream and two sugars—and Rogers ordered a slice of apple pie. For someone so sure that the whole world was conspiring against him, he certainly behaved as though he had all the time in the world to sit in this diner in central Oregon.
“What about the fire?!”
“Does anyone know what caused that?” Tony asked. “The swelling, I mean?”
“Yes, this is Agent Stark. What’s going on?”
“Well, then the swelling can’t be a result of the infection, right? So maybe that’s a dead end. She could have just been an asymptomatic carrier. I’d still like to take a closer look at her autopsy report, though.”
“Now, if you don’t mind, we’re going to take Miss Nemman back to the station to ask her some questions,” she said. “Have a safe flight back, gentlemen.”
“Who is it?” he called as he set aside the laptop and stood up.
“Are you insinuating that I don’t know how to do my job?”
He rolled over and stood up, opening the door to find Rogers standing outside, holding a bagel in either hand. He offered one to Tony, and Tony took it.
“Yes, but she was the only one with the bumps and the infection. They all had the swelling, though.”
Tony thought derisively.
“Okay. Goodnight, Tony,” Rogers said.
The drive to the hospital was short but truly painful. Clearly, Rogers was enjoying this a great deal, and it didn’t seem like he wass going to let Tony off the hook anytime in the near future. It was a relief when they finally pulled over behind a row of emergency vehicles on the road to the hospital.
, he thought. He only barely composed himself by the time Rogers came back with his shirt halfway open. He buttoned up as they walked to the car.
“Lauren and Michael Burns were both admitted the day after their high school graduation. We thought they had gotten in a car crash,” she said.
“Dr. Stark, Agent Rogers,” she said. “I’m Marilyn Hayes with the Center for Disease Control. This case is officially outside of your jurisdiction. You’re free to leave.”
“Okay, that was weird,” Tony said once they were back in the rental car driving toward the airport. Rogers didn’t answer, but the car squealed to a halt. When Tony looked out the window, he practically jumped out of his skin. There was a deer in the road, but it looked so horribly bloated and disfigured—limbs askew and bent at sickening angles—that it barely resembled a deer anymore. “Jesus Christ!”
“Why didn’t you talk to anyone about it?”
“Sure did. This is all they found.” He flipped to the next slide. “How’s your chemistry?” Tony looked at the chemical sequence on the screen with furrowed brows.
“Stark, what is she doing?” Tony watched her draw in the air again.
“It burns,” she whimpered, touching her forearm where there was the slightest bit of swelling. Rogers tooke her hand in his own and squeezed.
Tony hung up and got out of bed, shoving his feet into his shoes and doing his best to flatten the wrinkles in his button-down. It was still warm when he stepped outside, and the cicadas were practically shrieking. He banged on Rogers’ door so long he worried he might get slapped with a noise complaint before he got an answer.
“Tony Stark, as I live and breathe!” Steve said, and he genuinely sounded excited as he moved to shake Tony’s hand. “I gotta say, I almost didn’t believe it when the brass told me I was gonna be working with you. God, you look just like your old man. You know, we used to work together.”
“Yikes,” Tony said. “And all the victims died of the same thing?”
“You know, I’ve never met anyone so eager to discredit their own accomplishments,” he said, and Rogers sighed minutely, but he didn’t look away from the road. “You’re a hero for what you did with the 107th to take Hydra down. Most people would take that and run. I don’t get it, Rogers. You won. Why are you so hung up on these crazy conspiracy theories.”
He sighed and cocked his head, as if he could get answers if he only stared at the vial long enough. There was a knock on the door.
“Theresa, get back in the car and let me handle this,” he said, then turned toward Rogers and Tony. “I don’t know who you people think you are.”
“Goodnight.”
.” Steve frowned, and Tony came back to himself, shook his head, and put on his best press smile. “Sorry; that was unprofessional of me. It’s nice to meet you, Agent Rogers. What is this you’re looking at?”
“Watch the way you talk, Stark,” Rogers teased. “This one was older than you are. Anyway, it wasn’t heroin. Her toxicology was clean, and everyone who knew her swears up and down she wasn’t a drug user. Didn’t even drink.”
Tony squints, and sure enough, there it is: foundation just a few shades darker than Soames’ skin. He really should have caught that, with the amount of times he’d been whisked away by a makeup artist to cover up a black eye before a photo op for Stark Industries.
“Have you ever met him?” Assistant Director Janet Van Dyne piped up, speaking for the first time from her perch in the corner of the room.
There were boxes everywhere, practically blocking the narrow hallway to a single door labeled 131. Tony knocked, loudly, twice.
“What’s going on?” Rogers asked, and the officer looked away from the EMT he was talking to in time to see Rogers flash his badge.
When they got back to the motel, they were told that the firefighters couldn’t salvage anything, and that, Tony found a bit weird. Unless the emergency response time was truly abysmal, they should have been able to put out the fire well before everything was destroyed.
When they arrived at the cemetery, the coroner was already waiting for them. Tony shot Rogers a sharp look as they stepped out of the car, because it was
“Hi,” he said softly. “You must be Lauren. I’m Steve.” Tony took another step into the room, and Dr. Miles turned to leave.
“Rogers!” Tony tried to sound scolding, but it mostly came out distressed and disgusted. He rushed to get back into the car as quickly as possible.
Tony felt his stomach roll over at the crunching sound of the birds’ bodies as Rogers drove over them.
“Uhmm..M-Mr. Stark I-“
Sam was taken a back. “That proud bulky blonde?”
But of course he could not change back time. He sighs in content as he smiles. "Yeah...I've always wanted to go to the Empire State building."
"I see you're well aware of Mr. Rogers current predicament and his absence as of now. And for the latter, we have no clue either. We're still trying to find him. I'm waiting here just in case he comes back."
Pietro shrugged. "I mean I don't think he calls himself that way but a lot of people do. Look let's just focus on finding Steve and Nat."
“Wanda, are you out of your mind? You’ve been with him for a long time. Have you ever seen any nice Alphas that actually just wants to be his friend or help him? All they do is force themselves on him.”
“Look, trust me when I say this. Stark is not a bad guy but that does not mean we share the same values or vision. I don’t agree with some of his way of thinking. What he is doing with Steve is very wrong and I apologize on his behalf because I know he won’t.”
"Bucky I thought we agreed to wait until you come back. Not that I don't want to.." Steve runs his hand through Bucky's hair and massaged the scalp as the Alpha hummed in satisfaction.
"Please! For your own good."
“Check.”
"Thanks Nat." He blushed.
"I'm looking out for ya doll face."
Happy nodded. "I saw them too. It's brilliant actually."
Steve looked away, humiliated for what he's doing. He kept on pushing Bucky even when he knows it would be no use. Bucky hummed in satisfaction as he sucks and pulls Steve's nipple. Steve jerks in surprise, body tingling from the new sensation. He bit his lips to stop himself from moaning out loud, not letting Bucky have the satisfaction which made Bucky furious inwardly.
Peggy smirked at Clint as she continued to play with her knife. "To be precise, I'm going to kill 2 assholes."
Steve stopped as he reached a 1 meter radius between the two.
He sighed. "I told you, later."
Steve just bit his lip. He knew what Natasha meant. He hates the idea of being with an alpha but he knew Natasha was just saying this with good intention. "I know you mean well Nat but I just can't grasp at the idea of having an alpha. I-I don't like to be tied down. I wanna be free. The freedom to do anything I want."
"Do. It." His eyes were furious that he could drill a hole into Happy's head.
As she was running, her phone rang again. She stopped to see it was Sam and answered.
"Look, you know what forget it. JARVIS tell me about Steve's whereabouts." Happy sighed and went back to the files he's been working on.
"The fuck is this Wilson?!" Bucky was pissed as he looked at Wade and towards Peter.
“What do you mean?” Peter looked at her confused.
Both looked at each other intensely. Steve was just really confused on how both Alphas that he hated knew each other.
Bucky growled and glared at Happy again. “Tell Stark that he won’t be working with him anymore. He’s mine!”
Steve shook his head. “N-Nothing. I want my friends. Please.”
“God, I haven’t even seen him in a while and now he’s like this. I should’ve stick to him at all times.”
"No. Either that or the deal is off." Steve said sternly. Or at least he tried to be.
Steve shook his head. "No, I wanna know more..."
Thor's eyes widened at Wanda. "Wanda!"
Nat nodded. "Yes. We both have something big for you which is why we need to discuss today. Come on." She turned around to lead the way until she saw Happy trying to stop a particular billionaire who was striding towards them confidently. Even when he was wearing a pair of sunglasses, Natasha knew he had a predatory gaze on a particular blue eyed sweetheart. She groaned, annoyed that the Alpha is trying to ooze out dominance just to impress the Omega.
“Steve! Where were you?!” Peggy got up from the couch and rushed towards Steve who just entered the office with Tony.
"Shh Steve sweetheart...I'll be gentle alright." He said as he stroke his head.
“But Happy!”
He could already see a few people in black at the said park which he knows it is Bucky's men and of course the familiar scent quickly hits his nose.
"T-Thank you uhmm what's your name again?"
"Ah! Buck! Ah!" His body jerked up, head thrashing around in pleasure. "Bucky please. Don't tease."
Well that was new for Bucky. "Proposition? I'm going to guess Romanoff does not know this?"
With that, the Alphas forgot about the war they plan to execute and focus immediately on the Omega who now seems to be sleeping in Bucky’s arm.
"Steve hold still. I don't want to be rough with you."
Steve broke from his trance. "O-Oh no no God I'm sorry. I shouldn't have acted like this."
"Steve! Please, wait! Let me explain!" Natasha ran after Steve as they made it out off the club.
He tried to keep his inner Alpha intact.
Sam sighed. "You think this is going to work? Not gonna lie I think I'm having doubts."
Tony blinked in confusion but he could smell a delicious smell from the bag.
When Steve can't take it anymore, he leans down to put his mouth on the overstimulated nipple making her moan, her tongue plays with it, while his hips go faster, she touches him again and when Tony is close to finishing she clings, buries her nails in his skin, arched against his mouth, shudders, says his name and Steve simply drops his head on Tony's sternum.
Tony is smiling at him and she is one of those pretty smiles that fill her blue eyes with a glow that feels soft, real, one that has not been directed at anyone but himself, cannot be a lie, this is real.
When everything is over, she taps his shoulder and he lets her go.
He think of Tony and how they had said goodbye before leaving on that mission, she was fine, smiling, flirtatious and ready to kiss him until he forgot everything, he was late for the first time, delaying the departure of the helicopter.
He tangles his legs on Steve's hip and drops backwards, scattered across the table, with her shirt half undone, bust outside the bra, her lips, her shoulders with reddened marks,  Steve sees what he has done, what it causes in her, she is brazen, she is playful, she is ... she is beautiful and Steve wants to have her like this forever.
Antonia was a free being, was someone who could not easily be tied.
Steve wonders if he has ever been so close to someone before and it is a silly question because, he has been with other women before her.
Maybe his own prejudices were the ones that kept him away.
It felt good, it felt right to stand there in front of Iron Man without the hood to hide his face, telling him, showing him and making promises, thinking about the future, talking about them.
During the meetings they always sat close to each other, but it was normal, they are the team leaders after all.
He enters it and it is ... as if he was complete again.
Most of the symptoms were there, only he had been too distracted to see them.
Details that Steve found a little later in the newspapers, where he also found a picture of how his wings would look like, with reddish brown tones and yellow at the tips, were a beautiful wings that almost reached the calf but it went very well with Stark.
-I need a drink- she speaks with the voice that she's done with everything, goes straight to one of the shelves where she has a small reserve of her favorites drinks, serves a brandy and drinks without even hesitating.
She moves away to be able to look at him and Steve enjoys seeing how beautiful she looks right now, near him, in his arms, with his appetizing lips of a reddish tone that encourage him to continue kissing her, but Tony's eyes stop him.
Every part of him has renewed energy, leaves the motorcycle, knocks on the door and the new Jarvis receives him with a smile and a greeting that Steve simply puts aside with the man, Steve does not wait for Jarvis to take him to her, not even matters that she has never really taken him to her room in all this damn time.
He accepts it because he is not sure where he is treading with Tony or even if his friendship could survive after all the mess they have created around their relationship.
She is looking him in the eyes again in search of something that does not exist, because Steve does not understand or know exactly what she wants from him.
Steve stays several moments without a single movement, accommodates his clothes, thinks about what happened and feels how each part of him plays with his mind, this is not something he was looking for, it is not even something he wanted, this is something that neither It should have even happened.
They had started a bond without realizing it and every small part of Steve feels fluctuating and excited.
-Stark can you stay a moment? We need to talk - it almost escape as an order.
It was a disaster that almost ended with New York, not counting all registered dead.
She noods with desire and every part of Steve feels victorious, as if he had won a war, feels a strange warmth in his chest that ignores and instead smiles and gets up to kiss her.
He should have known, he should have known that none of this would last, nothing really good lasts.
-Excellent talk honey, we have to repeat it again one day- she says and walks away with a small movement of hips, as if all this was something completely normal that happens every day between them.
Steve's blood is boiling, every part of his body is tense and ready to break bones, he doesn't realize what he is doing until everyone is watching him.
There is no real concept of the time they have been there, only that he has Tony with her hands reloaded on a table, Steve's arms surround her, his hands are resting on each side of her and his lips run down the back discovered by the dress, spreads kisses on her shoulders, in the curve of her deltoid, nibbles on her shoulder blade and she just writhes, instantly tries to turn to Steve, but he takes each of her hands in his to keep her that way.
"You do not have to tell me your identity or show me ... " Steve tries once more time "just give us a chance".
Tony see happier places, places where all the heroes have a lot of fun when they are fighting with a villain or even once he go to one where there were no heroes, but still there is a Tony Stark who made weapons for the government.
It seemed all unreal, but try to calm down, try to relax his tense muscles, try to feel better because she is there, she is with him, but  he could not until he is in bed and he is hugging her close, there is nothing sexual in his touch, just a comforting touch, he looks at her and gives him a short kiss again.
He drops to his knees in front of her who looks at him breathlessly, with the excitement dancing in her gaze, he gives a few kisses to her legs covered by the soft fabric of her tights and goes up slowly making her bite her lip, reaches her skin and she feels even better than her idyllic memory could protect, perhaps marred by the speed of their encounters, he leaves a kissing path on her thighs and she shudders touching his hair with her fingers.
She is the one who breaks the kiss, it is not abrupt, it is soft.
Iron Man turns his back on him with a "I can’t".
Then there is another great cataclysm that leads Tony and Steve to a fight between them where they can not solve anything together, there is a fight between them that Tony already expected to come, so even they manage to make things work, they create a plan that will save them all, everything is fine, until things get screwed and everything starts a decline that forces Tony to act, takes all the pieces, lies and betrays, he doesn't know what will happen exactly with him, but it doesn't matter, because the world (Steve ) has always imported more than Tony.
-So ... - she starts moving one of her hands -What can I help Captain Rogers? - she says suddenly becoming the business woman Steve has glimpsed a few times, even formally speaking to him, something that since They knew each other had not done.
Steve can not help but notice every little movement of her, her hips that surely under the beautiful brand suit will have the marks of his fingers, her occasional shirts that do not hide well the small marks that Steve's lips have left as proof that he was been there, the flirtatious blue look full of secrets that Steve wants to discover one by one.
The opportunity does not come quickly, it does not come even though he has changed his own routine and has been hovering around the mansion for longer than he has at the time it became the place of residence of the Ultimates just to find Tony.
-That has never stopped you… - try again to touch her, but that answer seems to be the wrong one because she pushes him.
In response to the attack, Steve's fingers push aside her panties and touch her seriously, circling her clit, it is slow, just a preamble of what will come next, she moves her hips rubbing a little more and Steve just wants to make her feel good.
He think of his parents and his brother, dead.
She is everywhere as if she knew where to play so Steve would lose control, as if she was openly looking for just that.
-What do you want from my Steve? - It's almost a scream, she stops, lowers the volume of her voice as if trying to calm down. - Did you want me? There I were for you, what you will need there Iwas. Did you want space? I gave it to you, I gave you so much space that I almost left the team so you could breathe without feeling pressured.
Steve loves the thin line of her shoulders.
Perhaps those were the reasons that repelled him from his surroundings.
He had started to stockpile bottles of Iron Man's favorite soda on his shelves, but that was not uncommon, after all it was the only thing that Iron Man consumed when he was in team meetings or at any time of connection with the team.
His knuckles burn, but it doesn't matter, they will heal before he has time to really worry about it.
Maybe he will never be able to know for sure the answer.
Tony makes adjustments to his own armor, makes changes so that the system works again and does not need the help of any other person if he arrives at another universe that is not his, in order to calibrate and open another portal, he doesn't leave that nobody touches anything of his things, least of all the younger Tony who looks at him with so much interest, because he does not want Tony to get to where he is, he does not want his future for this Tony.
He continues to give only a few kisses on the line of her shoulder while his hips remain still and the fingers of his hands barely make a slow brush on her clitoris, something as faint and completely different from how Tony likes these meetings between them, on the other hand, Steve is too fond of having her in his arms with her body buzzing in need and all her barriers thrown to the ground.
She was fine and now ... Now maybe he will lose her too.
Days go by and Tony stays off his radar, they have no missions together, there are no more agents talking about her, it's almost as if she only existed in the magazines and in the interviews she attends to show new inventions or talk about the Ultimates, as if she was just an untouchable television star.
It's frustrating.
This is how he ends up encountering a kind of Avengers in the place, giving reason to his theory about being expelled from his own universe, it is easy to get along with them as if they had been waiting for Iron Man to join the team, they help him and when everything is ready for him to leave, they ask him to stay and he is tempting, because he has become fond of them, but he can't do it, there are people waiting for him and he creates a portal that will take him home.
The search for touch is not only a desire for his wings, his hands play an important role even when Iron Man can not feel anything, but there is Steve putting his hands on his shoulder, on the forearm or even once (or maybe twice) in the Iron Man's waist, he wants to feel close to Iron Man.
Maybe he had simply been eclipsed by Janet's charm.
And he does, the next morning follows a normal course, wakes up with the first rays of the sun, takes something light to eat, runs in the small nearby circuit, returns home for an efficient shower and a good breakfast along with the newspaper, He puts on his suit, uses his motorcycle and goes straight to Triskelion, although he is not really an active agent of the organization.
She was simply an incoherence with legs trying to prove something to the world, she was an independent woman with the guts to break the schemes established by a conservative society, with an almost endless list of conquests and a company that created the technologies that would change the future.
These are crazy ideas, these are ideas that should not be in Steve's head, since Iron Man has made it clear that he can not create a deepest bond, his secret identity is important and Steve respects him, even when every part of him vibrates because Iron Man let him in.
-You look tired- he says softly, as if he’s afraid to break the moment.
Of course she was bold, quick-thinking and a really intelligent woman, all those things bottled in one of the most beautiful women he had ever met, but with all that set she also came loaded with a little insubordination, a loose mouth that looked like her better quality was flirting than thinking and a woman who could drink her weight in alcohol without losing her composure.
But the first time he fell fully into Tony's charms that was the moment when everything inside Steve was doomed.
She kisses his cheek and hugs him by the neck.
There is an answer that is lost in his mind, it is drowning.
And even with everything he has agreed with himself, even with all the time he has said that he has accepted what he has, the man under the cape simply has a thorn that cannot be removed, chasing every one of his thoughts, is simply that feeling before the serum, yearning for a life that has been denied, Steve begins to want more.
- Are you serious? - Tony's formal facade is broken for a moment and Steve just crosses his arms. -Of course you are serious- she says wryly and sighs. -I haven't done anything other than what you want, honey.-
But what confirmed it completely was when Iron Man was hit by the villain on duty during one of their fights, Steve could feel the blow completely on his ribcage as if he had been hit himself, even a bruise was as strong proof of their bond.
He kissed her, because he needs her even more than he needs to breathe, like a man in the desert looking for water, that when he finds it, he almost drowns with it.
He think of Gail, Bucky and how they both found a way to stay together without him.
Steve's patience is running out, in fact he feels exhausted and tired of her ignoring him, catches her eyes on him is only a second but it feels like hope.
Steve stops and nods. They may want him report before he even has time to get comfortable.
She falls asleep in his arms and Steve can't let her go all night.
He starts rocking his hips against her, partly for his own relief and partly to distract her, he puts aside the pantiesand her fingers sneak in playing now with the edge of her entrance, it's barely soft, she moves in an attempt to take his fingers inside, looking for more friction.
-Let's go on with the board- he forces himself to say.
-I've also been busy. Where do you think the property and equipment damage is paid? - Counter.
Steve just looks away from her to concentrate, breaks her panties to reach his destination, his tongue touches every sensitive point he can reach while Tony's fingers twist over his hair, her heart stutters fast and her lips barely let out. some incoherent words, showing him exactly how she like it.
Loot every little gram of good sense from his mind, kiss her as if it were the first time, as if he wanted to explore every little corner that her mouth allows him to have, she takes control of everything, touches him on every part she can reach and before that he even has an idea, she already has his erection between her skilful fingers, making him groan.
Steve feels time is running very slowly, while he is trying to get to the mansion as fast as he can, he feels angry because he was not there for her, she fainted in the bathroom of his own mansion and nobody noticed until hours later, hours, not instantly, not seconds, not even minutes… fucking hours, he wants to hit everyone because she could die next to the toilet and nobody cares in the least.
Steve can't stop, he has to touch her and he does it, he’s hesitant, waiting for her to throw him, he runs the fingers of one of his hands through her little hair, slowly, carefully, just to be a little massage, that Tony Accept, leaving the glass and recharging on the table.
"I really can’t give you what you want Steve" says the distorted voice of Iron Man, so low it looks more like a strange squeak.
"Someone had to do it" contradict Steve's thoughts.
-You have me- escapes from Tony's lips along with a groan and Steve can only feel like a warmth runs through his body, intoxicating, beating his excitement and for a moment he knows that the feeling that fills him is happiness , but he wants more and she asked for sincerity, so the selfish vein wins and wants more, wants everything.
Antonia is there, sitting on one of the benches, waiting for him.
The suit begins to retract, it's automatic, every little fiber of Steve is vibrating with emotion as he watches as the pieces of the armor fly off, until he starts to see skin and then the wings go along with the suit, leaving Steve paralyzed, he does not stop looking at how the scars are revealed and how suddenly there is nothing stopping him from looking completely at the man who has been hiding under the suit.
When everything ends and the others leave, Steve gets up from the table to reach her, but she is faster, Tony is even already following Thor.
And it is his universe, he is more than sure of it, because he can see all his feelings inside this younger Tony, who is more foolish, more naive and more optimistic, but above all this Tony can not look away from Steve when he is in the room and he really doesn't want to think about this Steve who doesn't stop looking at him as if he is trying to find all the similarities between him and the younger Tony, Tony avoiding look at them to much because he knows what awaits them and also hurts not being able to go and touch Steve, touch every single part of him so the feeling that they are together again will be satiated and he can continue working.
