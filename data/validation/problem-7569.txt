Look... I get that this frustrates you, hell it's no fun for me to make such a soup of Yaël's life either. I'll fix it later, I promise.
Harry shrugs.
“What I would give for Steve to be here right now,” Tony mutters. Bruce shrugs.
Ned smiles and holds his hand out to Harry, who doesn’t smile back as widely but still shows him a little grin. He shakes his hand.
Yaël grinned as she read the text. So, this man really couldn’t die? How was that even possible? Or was he joking? How does a man get immortal? She received a following text.
Tony walked straight through the projection to Peter, taking a knee in front of the boy and placing his hands on both of Peter’s shoulders. Peter shuddered just slightly beneath his touch and Tony gripped just a bit harder, wanting to ground Peter with his presence and chase out the fear. This was so much, compiled with everything he already put the kid through; too much if he was being perfectly honest with himself, for a 15-year-old boy. It was selfish, and the guilt roiled in Tony’s heart.
Peter snapped out of his traitorous thoughts and realized this whole time he had been sitting there with his mouth half open, his burger only inches from his mouth as he spaced out. He could feel the flush overtake his cheeks, he hated how easily he blushed around Tony.
In Tony’s mind, he could see Clint seated atop the back of the couch, screaming obscenities into a head set while he slaughtered online players in Call of Duty. Vison and Wanda would be huddled around the stove while she attempted to teach the android to cook. Natasha and Bruce were doing yoga poses that even Tony wouldn’t dare on mats near the western windows where the afternoon sun flooded in and bathed them in it’s warm light. Thor and Cap would be engaged in some silly challenge initiated by Thor, like arm wrestling, and Tony would be on a Stark Pad, bitching at the two of them not to break his house for the thousandth time just to have his eye twitch at the sound of splintering wood.
“Alright, lay it on me, elder Chris Angel.”
“Thanks, doll,” Tony said, shooting the waitress that million-dollar press smile that caused her to blush and rush hurriedly away. Tony turned and looked at his burger in what Peter could only describe as predatory and he wondered briefly at the feeling of jealousy toward the dead flesh of cow. He picked up his burger when Tony did and went to take a bite but his efforts were thwarted when Tony bit into his burger and let out a low groan of pleasure at the taste.
“Tony!” Pepper admonished, looking pointedly at Peter.
“Do not disregard the boy. What you are told by society; disregard it. He’s the web that will weave you all together.”
“Mr. Stark?” Peter asked the man, would had ceased movement after getting three feet into the room. Peter could see he was remembering and that it was painful. Tony didn’t respond to him and Peter knew the older man was a little bit lost in the fog of the past right now. He bit his lip and tentatively placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, the warmth of his palm seeping through the cotton of Tony’s faded AC/DC t-shirt and the light weight of his grasp snapping Tony from his reverie.
E = h f = (h/2π) 2π f = ~ω. E = 1 2mv2. p = mv. Tony let himself think about random quantum physics formulas. That was a safe train of thought. He rounded the corner and spotted Vision. The android was going through all the cabinets in the kitchen as if he was taking inventory. Vision had now taken to wearing human clothing and Tony wasn’t sure about how he felt about Vision’s sense of style, which seemed to be a page ripped right out of the Steve Rogers manual.
Suddenly, Tony remembered Strange asking how he liked being 21. His eyes widened.
Vision smiled at that, but it was one laced with eternal sadness.
Tony’s hand involuntarily clutched his chest, right where the arc reactor used to be, in the exact spot Steve had smashed his shield into the Iron Man armor so hard he cracked Tony’s already fragile sternum that previously had to be reconstructed after the removal of the arc reactor. He was six weeks recovered from the surgery to repair it, adding yet another snarled scar to chest. He was finally cleared to lift objects under 30 pounds, but he did seem to remember the doctor saying something about being susceptible to infection now the subject arose.
“No, but thanks man. Go get some sleep, you have a flight in the morning to catch. I’ll have it done before you leave.”
He and Tony hadn’t met before, but like anyone else, even before becoming Sorcerer Supreme, Strange knew of Stark. From what he’d seen of Tony from media in the past, he could see the toll the Accords and the Civil War between the Avengers had taken on the man. Tony would always look good, he was too blessed genetically, but the man had lost a good ten pounds. He had more wrinkles in his face and around his eyes than he had two months ago. Not having left his lab in weeks, more gray had streaked through his hair than he probably would’ve normally allowed and his usually sharply groomed facial hair was getting out of control.
And Peter’s hips jerked forward as he sprayed himself all over the tile in front of him, dick pulsing as he emptied his balls of what felt like a week's worth of semen. He rested his forehead against the tiles and let the water wash away the evidence. He wished it could wash away the burning shame that lit his face and tips of his ears on fire. Surely if Stark knew what Peter really thought of him, he’d be utterly disgusted and that would be the last Peter ever saw of him. But Peter had no idea how to escape the infatuation he had with his mentor, and he’d accepted it was just a burning secret he was going to have to live with for the rest of his natural life.
“You assume I know where they are.”
“Well, that was a lifetime ago, and I don’t see what 21-year-old me has anything to do with our present situation,” Tony sniped, growing bored with the game Strange was playing.
Tony arched a brow.
“Something like that,” Strange answered, sweeping his cloak back as his gaze narrowed in on Tony.
When the waitress came back, Tony made double orders of triple decker cheeseburgers with all the fixings except onions, with larger baskets of fries and salted caramel milkshakes. Peter amended his to be chocolate, but promised he’d at least try Tony’s when Tony insisted it was one of the best things on the planet. Peter filled the time of waiting for the food by engaging Tony in his ideas for safer blunt tip cannulas that would inject automatically from the pilot needle. Stark used his Stark watch to pull up 3D schematics right there on the tabletop, and he and Peter hunched over it, twisting and turning the model as they discussed the inner workings of the automation of the needle.
“Sir, you appear to have a visitor.”
“Tony, no. Now really isn’t the time, you should be resting!” Pepper cried, shooting Peter a look as he moved to help Stark up. The boy froze, clearly torn between who he was supposed to obey. Tony gave him a look and Peter sighed, offering Tony a hand to help pull him up from the car. He could feel Pepper’s eyes burning a hole in the back of his skull. He hoped he didn’t get trapped in the elevator with her any time soon. Pepper was scary.
Peter got impossibly pinker, hating how he tripped all over his words like his tongue was sliding over a sheet of black ice.
“T’Challa will be in contact,” Steve replied, and before he could take another breath the line went dead.
When Tony heard Steve’s voice answer “Rogers”, it was like a flashback scene from a bad romcom. He remembered their contentious first meeting, baiting Steve and getting under his skin when they sparred, favoring HUD data over the Captain’s call in the battlefield. He remembered taking Steve to his first ball game after the unthawing, Steve riding with him to get greasy burgers at way too late hours of the night, of a thrilling brush of hands in the elevator…
Tony stirred groggily on the floor. Somewhere in the distance he thought he could hear FRIDAY, but it was far away and his head HURT. He felt like he’d been smashed into the side of a building by the Hulk without his armor on and somehow lived to tell the tale. Maybe that is what happened. Maybe Bruce had finally come back, gotten pissed at the state of abuse Tony had put his recovering body through, and Hulked out on him. God, he missed his science bro.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“There’s too much at stake for you to poison me now, Parker, do it for after we save the world,” Tony grunted, stuffing a large helping of pancake into his mouth.
Vision let this hang in the air and Tony could not deny any of it. If it was Steve saying this, Tony would deflect, would go on defensive, would escalate the situation until they were both so incensed that they forgot they were discussing Tony’s inadequacies. There was something about Vision that wouldn’t allow Tony to be false beyond a practiced smile.
“I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.”
“Not necessary, FRIDAY,” Stephen Strange said in a bored voice, and with the minute flick of a finger, yanked Tony out from beneath his car by manipulating his creeper, the wheels gliding effortlessly across the polished concrete floor of the garage. Tony sat up incredulously. He hated magic, he really did.
Strange smiled, and Tony was struck by how much the action simultaneously illuminated the man’s face and made him look lethal.
Tony’s legs that were more blackened with oil stains than the actual color of the denim fabric of his work jeans were all that were visible from under the Audi R8 Spyder. He’d purchased himself a new one after its predecessor had been blown to bits and buried at sea in Malibu. Tony was meticulous about regular maintenance on his babies, and thus was beneath the sleek car changing the oil.
“Well, actually, there are probably numerous villains that would like this information although it won’t do them a bit of good for world domination plans,” he mused and caught Peter’s slight jaw drop at his honesty, “but that’s neither here nor there, I swear, I don’t know how I get off on these tangents around you,” he quickly added.
Tony stared at Peter, dumbfounded, letting that process.
“Um, yeah. Is that not ok? I totally get it, you probably follow a strict diet, I probably should too, being a hero means you should stay fit, right? You don’t have to eat it, it’s just something that May and I do when she’s not working on the weekends and I thought, since I’m usually here, that maybe I’d carry the tradition over, but it’s ok, Mr. Stark, really you don’t have to eat any of it.”
Tony took a deep breath and nodded. All Peter talked about was him? Yeah, the kid really did need a life. If Tony was the most interesting thing in his life, Peter was definitely doing something wrong…especially going around licking spoons like a god damn porn star, all in public too, little exhibitionist- TONY NO!
“I’ll go to the lab; no one up but me at this time of the night.”
He finally got Pepper to leave. Don’t get him wrong; he loved Virginia Potts from the first hair on her beautifully groomed head down to her manicured toes in a strictly ‘we tried but it will never work out and we are both too dependent on each other to stop being in each other’s lives’ sort of way, but that woman could be a goddamn harpy when she wanted to be. Finding Tony half dead-ish on his garage floor was a harpy trigger, apparently.
Tony pushed off the wall. He had the sudden craving for a shot or seventy of bourbon. He wasn’t going to go that route again, but in times of having to deal with emotions he’d rather not, he sure missed the burn of alcohol and the way warmth bloomed throughout your chest and you just stopped giving a shit about everything.
“FRIDAY, upload these to Peter’s files please,” Tony asked his AI through the watch, and they both watched as the hologram disappeared.
Rhodey gave him one more searching look before he nodded, muttered goodnight and lumbered off to his guest suite. Tony stood there alone once Rhodey left, again longing for that drink. He sighed to himself, resigned to what he must do, and stepped inside the elevator trying to ignore the anxiety trying to claw its way out of his chest where his reactor used to be.
Tony put the brakes on the emerging train of dirty thoughts slamming into the station.
Stephen simply twisted his fingers into what looked like a weird mudra to Tony and suddenly an image appeared before him. It was like a holographic that FRIDAY could produce but not brought about by scientific means. Again, Tony was reminded of how he wasn’t fond of magic and subtly flinched back.
“Don’t thank me just yet, you haven’t tried any of it yet.”
“I think, Anthony Edward Stark, that you let the darkness of doubt that clouds your heart and whispers into your mind get the best of you. I gather, from the parts of me that are made up of JARVIS, this is a foundation laid deep within you by Howard Stark’s hand. For everything you have done in your entire life, you feel you never measure up. You are somehow convinced that you are undeserving of happiness.”
“T’Challa will be in contact,” Steve had replied. Tony knew Steve would follow through on his end, so he gave up trying to stave off the emotional tsunami inside himself and snapped the phone shut, throwing the archaic tech across the room as if it had burned him. Tony collapsed onto the bed, grabbed the comforter and rolled, pulling the blanket as tight around his body as he could. It was something he did as a child when his parents fought to feel secure.
Peter grinned at him sheepishly, making the dimple in his chin appear. Another one of those weird things that Tony’s brain cataloged for no apparent reason.
“Aw, he’s heard way worse, Pep,” Tony soothed, his voice gritty from thrist, still looking at his reflection in the mirror.
(See the end of the chapter for
Strange smirked.
“Great!” Tony exclaimed, pushing himself up and away from Peter, who stood and followed Tony back to the elevator. The doors opened with a barely there “shick” and they stepped inside.
Happy dropped them off at this hole in the wall burger joint in lower Manhattan. It was near closing time and the place was all but deserted. Tony knew the owner and exchanged pleasantries with him, keeping on his overly large sunglasses and joking about “having to keep his face pretty for the company” when the much older gentleman noticed the difference. The guy was a friend of a friend of his father’s, from an older time and Tony knew he’d never breathe a word of Tony being here or his appearance.
Then Tony’s hand would go into his hair, tightening in his brown curls just enough to be on the right side of painful and jerk his head back. He’d tell him with grunt he was going to paint his pretty face, and Peter would have just enough time to snake his tongue out before warm ropes of cum splashed over his skin. Maybe Tony would even scrape some off his cheek and feed it to him…
Peter sat on the couch while Tony preferred to stand, eyeing Peter and for once choosing his words carefully.
“Thanks, kid. These last few months have meant a lot to me. I’m afraid maybe our positions have been reversed; I think you’ve been more of a rock for me than I have been a mentor to you.”
Vision quotes Mark Twain. Peter is domestic?
Peter mentally face-palmed. Of all the people in the world to get a crush on, he had to choose Stark. The multi-billionaire genius who could get anyone he wanted who would not so much as look at a scrawny teenage boy in that type of way. Oh, he was so fucked.
Tony was on his seventh bottle of Evian. SEVENTH. And yet he still did not have the urge to piss and he had been down in the lab for nearly an hour. He was downing water like a dying man and tossing the empty bottles over his shoulder, pitching them into the lab for DUM-E and U. They were more than taken with the sport, whirring and beeping happily as they retrieved the bottles and put them in the recycling bins. Every now and then there’d be a clatter of metal hitting the floor, where DUM-E ran into tables and toolboxes and knocked something down in his excitement.
Vision just gave him a searching look, his blue eyes doing that thing that made Tony feel like the android was seeing into his very core.
“I’m not Secretary Ross, Anthony.”
Peter swelled with pride; this was the happiest he’d seen Tony in weeks. Aunt May always told him that good food equaled a good mood; Peter was pleased that it worked. He just wanted to take care of Tony, in any way Tony would let him, and he figured if telling a little white lie about a “breakfast tradition” got him closer to that goal, it would be ok. He’d punish himself for it by washing all the dishes instead of letting the house maids do so.
“You got me breakfast?”
Later that afternoon, when Tony reached over and snagged the edge of Peter’s stool, yanking Peter away from his own research in an abruptly rude fashion that scattered hologram screens as Peter’s body moved unceremoniously through them, and Peter couldn’t even bring himself to feel perturbed. He didn’t think it was possible for him ever to be truly mad at Tony anyway, but this…
Tony took a breath to steady himself and stepped off the elevator when FRIDAY opened the doors. He clenched his fists at his sides and resolved not to look in direction of the couch, where just the other day he had nearly pulled Peter into his arms, awash with a fierce instinct to comfort and protect the boy after he watched himself die at Thanos’ hand. If he looked, he’d remember falling into the way Peter’s eyes shone when he said he believed in Tony, how it made his new, young heart squeeze with pride. He’d feel the flex of toned muscle in Peter’s shoulders where his hands gripped the boy that night. And that sinful way the kid licked that milkshake spoon…
------------------------------------------------
“Peter is the web that weaves us together,” Tony repeated, still not understanding what the hell Strange meant by that. What did any of this have to do with the kid?
“Alright, let’s not get extreme. Nobody would torture you for this information…”
“Pulse 88, temperature 100.5. He seems to be suffering from a great deal of dehydration, Miss Potts,” informed his AI. Ah, his baby girl. She was a beautiful work of artful engineering.
“Scans show he is perfectly intact, Mr. Parker, he is just delirious from dehydration.”
Fire shot through Peter’s veins and pooled in all the wrong (right) places. Alarms were going off in his head and he realized now what was going on.
“Alright, kid, what you are about to see is top secret for now. I’m the only other person who knows about it; I’ll share it with Vision separately. So, I need to know you can handle the weight of something of this caliber.”
“Thank you, Mr. Stark. But if you are going to insist on paying, I’m going to insist on you letting me leave the tip.”
“Woah, Mr. Stark, you…”
“Pete, look at me,” Tony said, letting authority leak into his voice but keeping his tone soft, waiting for Peter to raise his eyes to meet his own, steeling himself under their force when Peter met his gaze. Up this close, for the first time, he noticed that Peter’s syrup brown eyes were smattered with tawny flecks. Not sure why his supposedly genius brain was noting and filing that away right now, he shoved it aside in his mind.
“You bring me food, and yet, there it sits. Come on, kid, bring it over!”
Of course, Peter flushed; it was constant around Tony.
Steve stood there silently for a few beats, listening to the silence on the other end of the phone, eyes unseeing the Wakandan scenery before him.
“Pete?” Tony groaned out, finally recognizing the other presence in the room.
--------------------------------------------------------
Peter smiled, glad Tony wasn’t touching anywhere on his body that would give away how his pulse was racing right now. He felt like his brain was short circuiting right now. Having Tony’s complete and intense attention on him like this overwhelming to say the least. He swallowed hard, willing his voice not to shake.
“Oh my God, of course Mr. Stark! I’d never tell anyone, I swear!” Peter exclaimed sincerely.
The third time he gave up and submitted to the thought of getting off in Stark Tower, to Tony Stark, in his own shower. Which apparently he was going to do now, as his mind so helpfully jumped on board and began to play out his fantasies. Wrapping his hand around himself he began to imagine it was Stark’s, rough from working with metal and blow torches despite being perfectly manicured.
Arms wrapped around him from behind as Bucky’s lean frame pressed against his back, holding on to him tightly as if he could keep Steve together.
The sadness in his eyes when they stepped out of the elevator onto the commons floor wasn’t something Tony couldn’t hide either as he swept around the room. The ghosts of his family that was now nothing but tattered shreds of misplaced anger and regret still haunted this place. This was only the second time since Siberia that he set foot on this floor. The first time was just after he was cleared to leave medical and he went into Steve’s abandoned room where it still smelled like Old Spice and clean soap, collapsed on the perfectly made bed and screamed into Steve’s pillows with so much anguish and rage he ripped the stitches open above his left eye.
“What, was he afraid that I was going to hurt his feelings? Or did he think I was going to blow up the city again?” Yaël sneered sarcastically while poking in her pasta with her fork.
Now, it’s not even that late. The sun is probably still up, and they haven’t even had dinner yet, but it doesn’t seem to matter. Because Peter has his hands resting on his painful stomach, carefully avoiding his bruised ribs and not breathing too hard to keep the pain under control. He’s only just finished his call with MJ, affirming another date for tomorrow. Or, date… it’s a big word. They’re just going to serve food to the homeless again.
, Lord Asshole.” Loki frowned and pointed at her, but got interrupted as he opened his mouth to give her an ugly answer.
“Just Rhodey and Vision again. They’re probably the only ones who can hang out with you for a longer period of time,” Natasha jokes, but Tony doesn’t laugh at all. Sure, he’s showing her a fake smile, but it’s obvious that leaving these things so unresolved makes him uncomfortable. Peter just clears his throat again, uneasy at the tense atmosphere going on here.
recall Steve saying something about having to head back to the academy. He at least thought they’d have a whole day together, but half a day is just as good.
“You know, if you can’t form an actual sentence, I’m not sure I’ll be able to help you here,” Tony interrupts quickly. He starts walking into the hallway, intending to get to the recreation room and fetch some coffee. He knows Steve will follow him.
Wow, he really wasn’t expecting this; Steve Rogers and Yaël? Together? He wouldn’t have expected it from the Captain, really. But then again, what does he know about the man?
“You know there’s consequences, right? For the kid?”
“Tony…” Bruce mumbles in defeat while shaking his head. The engineer just gives him a big smile.
“You have a fever!”
“Yeah, really,” he said, not credible at all. Steve took another sip of his glass and stared at the wall. He was thinking about something, so Yaël decided to let him be for a moment.
“Awesome,” Tony mumbles. When the door opens he turns around to face Steve, who is holding up Tony’s crutches.
“Yeah, sorry for scaring you all,” he finally says. “I hadn’t slept for twenty-five hours-“
But he keeps it all in.
“Tony, just take a deep breath, okay?”
to talk to Peter in the hallway when their paths crossed.”
“I’ll just… go there for a bit…” he says. Everybody nods, and before anybody can say anything Peter’s already gone.
“We’re coming!” he returns. He can see Shuri say something, snickering as a result. Peter looks embarrassed, punching her (gently) on the arm and hissing something in return. It’s fun to see them joking around like this; it’s a complete opposite sight of the Peter they’ve had in the house for the past week.
“Thanks, I love you.”
Yaël waited until the guards had brought her some food, because, hey, free food. And this way the guards would stay away for a little while. After she was finished, Yaël walked towards the door and inspected the lock. Then she tried steering air through it and moved her finger to mimic the air opening the lock. As if it was a wonder, the rectangular doorknob moved. Holy shit, did she manage to do that from the first try?
It takes a few more seconds for Peter to catch up. After that he smiles widely, taking the phone and watching his father walk back to Steve. Once the two have their arms wrapped around each other again, Peter dials Yael’s and Wade’s numbers, feeling like everything is finally back to normal.
“Of course,” Steve says. He gives Wade a pointed look before following Tony out of the room. Once they’re separated from the others well enough, he turns towards his partner.
With that, he shut the door behind them, leaving Yaël alone.
Shit. Tony freezes on the spot, turning around slightly to find who called for him. Coming closer is a young man with a camera in his hands. A reporter, it seems.
Was that a good character trait, though? Yaël’s heart raced. What did she actually want from him? One second she wants to leave him as soon as possible because he reminded her of Loki, the other second, she wants to talk to him again as she found him intriguing. Or maybe she just wanted to sleep with him, which wouldn’t shock her either, as he was damn hot.
“I remember how we walked in, and you pulled us to this stall, begging us to buy you one of those Iron Man masks. And Ben said we’d do it if you would pay it back later – so you would learn to start earning what you get.”
Everybody stops their movement. Eyes are opened wide, mouth have dropped in surprise. Tony's fork falls out of his hand.
The reunion between Tony and Bruce has been wordless. The two just looked at each other, and suddenly Tony pulled him into a strong and long hug. His eyes might have been a bit red, but there hasn’t been more reaction than that. After that, Bruce has left to take a shower, and he’s currently dressed in one of Tony’s slacks and a shirt from Steve. He didn’t ask questions about it when Tony gave it to him.
“Dear Loki,” Yaël smiled, “since I have a hole in my leg and my hand and a scar on my forehead, I’m not that easy to look at anymore. That, and I heard you have stools in your showers.”
Johnny nods, and so do Sue and Reed. Ben just grunts. What a group, they are. A bunch of scientists who went up in space for research and a teenager that snuck in on the space craft because he didn’t want his sister to go without him. Ben is Reed’s best friend. Sue is Reed’s fiancé. Johnny is Sue’s brother. That doesn’t seem enough, most of the time. Whenever they’re
With a soft creak the door opened.
“There are some matters that I want to address to each of you,” Ross starts, taking his remote and starting up his speech. Nobody speaks, instead listening to the man. Once or twice, Sue has to kick Johnny in the leg whenever his attention starts to waver, but other than that there’s no trouble. And Ross speaks, about their accomplishments in the world, the way the people view them, what they’re called. Reed and Johnny smile proudly. Sue can only feel there’s something coming soon.
Peter doesn’t need to be told twice. He gets his breakfast in with hurried bites, and then runs to the room to get some clothes on. The attempt to tame his bedridden hair is hopeless, so with curls going all the way Peter appears back at the living room, holding up his arms to the side when he gets an unimpressed look from his Aunt.
“Smartass,” Pepper returns. Tony shrugs smugly, leaning forward to kiss her cheeks before walking off.
That is, until he walks on something. Looking down to see what’s under his foot, he finds, much to his surprise, that the whole floor is covered with toys. Plushies, squeaking things, Barbie dolls. Tony leans forward and takes one of the dolls into his hands.
“Let’s just agree to be better friends to each other, huh?” she asks. Peter nods, holding out his hand towards her to shake, which she does. “Though I feel like we still need to talk about what happened afterwards…”
“OF COURSE I CAN DIE, WADE! I FEEL PAIN AS MUCH AS ANYONE DOES!”
“Yeah, I have no idea what that means,” Steve chuckles.
Steve marches towards the table Toomes is occupying. The man only barely looks up when he sees Steve arrive, but he seems to realize immediately that there’s something wrong here. Clearing his throat, he makes place for Steve’s plate.
“Doing what?” he asks.
“Tony, please, don’t go,” Steve begs of him. Tony turns around immediately. His breath speeds up, his hands are balled into fists.
Happy holidays! I wish you all warmth, love and the strength to follow your dreams and reach your goals!
“Da-, uh, Mr. Stark?” Peter asks, remembering only right on time that, in public, he’s only his intern.
“Why would I-?”
“I wouldn’t expect anything else from you; you’re Tony Stark, after all,” he assures him. Tony smiles lightly before pulling him along. It’s about time they get to their destination, because Tony is starving, and he’s sure Steve is, too.
“Oh Captain, my captain, is there something you wanted to ask humble little old me?” Tony asks the moment he’s through the door. He probably doesn’t even notice letting go of Pepper’s hand while he approaches Steve.
“Hi, Lopt,” she said as she turned around to face the black-haired man. She wanted to introduce him to her father, only to notice, Cem had disappeared.
“I like her,” Steve eventually says while they’re watching the Hobbits having fun in what looks like a tavern.
“So, Dr. Banner,” Strange says. “You’ve been missing for a while.”
“Well, that’s actually the problem. It- he, he’s no
May temporarily moved into the tower. They have prepared a bed for her in Tony’s unused office. Having put aside all the furniture in there, Rhodey and May have practically made the place their own. Only for a little while, though, May keeps on assuring him. She has no intention on staying here after Peter gets back on his own feet.
“There was stuff happening, people were getting hurt and I couldn’t just run out like you wanted me to. I had to stop him before people got hurt!”
It had been somewhere in between, well, kind of like a friends-with-benefits-thing. She had just passed his apartment whenever she felt like it and he took her random appearances very casually, just like she did with his frequent disappearances. He had told her that, with his secret-ass-job and all, she shouldn’t worry if he’d be gone one day. And that was exactly what had happened. One day, after struggling with the spare-key he had given her, she remembered it clearly, Yaël had walked into his apartment and it had been empty. Not empty like nobody was home, but empty like nobody was even living there. Every single piece of furniture had been taken out.
“Yeah, nothing’s changed. It’s not like I’m going to invite her along since she pretty much has the biggest dislike for parties like this.” Remembering how pissed off she looked at Liz’ party last year, he figures it might be for the better she’s not coming. Otherwise she’s going to prepare herself another piece of toast to eat there while giving everybody a death-stare.
“Shit, kid, you really went all out, didn’t you?”
encounter.
“After what, exactly?” Tony inquired, taking a large step back from the Sorcerer.
And like that it was gone; back to genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist in a snap. Well, Steve didn't deserve kindness anyway.
“I think,” Peter said as he scrunched up his nose a little bit, “that’s a little more sea salt than I’d like.”
“So, what do we do about it?” he finally asks Strange, afraid of the answer because he knew magic would be involved. Nothing good ever became of magic being used around Tony Stark. But he couldn’t let this reality come to pass. This time, the vision was real. This time, the whole entire world would be destroyed if he couldn’t it get right. He massaged his temples. He was getting too old for all the universe’s problems to keep falling on his doorstep.
He tried ignoring it the first time it had happened about 4 weeks ago. He managed alright and was able to get some fitful sleep in once he willed it down to a semi hard-on by imagining everything undesirable as he could: Ned in a tutu, painfully remembering walking in on his Aunt accidentally in the shower when he was 8, MJ and Flash suddenly dating with excessive PDA; you know, standard stuff. The second time, he tried the cold shower method, still determined that he was not going to get off to Mr. Stark in his own Tower.
Once Peter was no longer crouched over him, Pepper was next to appear, and her audible gasp of surprise before she clapped her hand over her mouth, eyes wide, scared Tony. Pepper had seen a lot of things; if she was shocked, it probably wasn’t good.
“I believe it was Mark Twain who said: Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter,” Vision supplied, his iridescent eyes watching Tony’s face.
“This is what will come to pass if I do not intervene. Normally, this would not be my first choice of method, but seeing as how time is valuable to us and cannot be wasted, I’m going to tell you how this vision comes to be. You, my friend, suffer osteomyelitis within your newly repaired sternum.”
“FRIDAY, have like, 3 cases of water delivered to the lab. I feel like I swallowed the desert. Unfortunately, I do have experience with that, ah, watch the goods, kid!” Tony groaned when Peter shifted him a little too roughly.
“Keep your money, kid, I have more than enough.”
“Tony, I don’t think sudden movements are-”
“You need better friends, kid, if hanging out with me is the highlight of your week. Come on,” he said, sliding his hand down to place it between Peter’s shoulder blades, guiding him toward the wide wrap- around white leather couch, “you are going to want to sit down for this one.”
“It’s ok, Peter, really. Good morning, by the way. What brings you down here this early?”
Peter smirked.
“Can’t say I’m pleased to make your acquaintance,” Tony snarked, eyeing the amulet suspiciously that hung from the man’s neck. His fingers twitched, knowing with the push of a button on his watch the suit would automatically wrap around his body for protection. He knew his baby girl was running the man’s name now and would compile the information for him to look through after this, well,
“Uh no. You know it has to be you. That’s the only way we are going to get everyone back to help us fight this monster. Tony you saw what is going to happen. This isn’t something that we can face divided.”
“No, I like salty. That thing,” Peter pointed at Tony’s milkshake, “is an acquired taste.”
What? He was modest.
I hope that did not suck! Comments always welcomed! <3
“I’m s-sorry, Mr. Stark, really, I called out to you like five times but the music was too loud. I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to frighten you. I should’ve told FRIDAY to announce me or something, I’m stupid for not thinking of it before, really I’m sorry!”
“That’s not true, boss, as Vision is up and pacing the common area kitchen.”
Chapter 5
“FRIDAY, scan my sternum for possible signs of osteomyelitis,” Tony asked, arching a brow smugly at the Sorcerer, who simply arched one back.
“Uh, yeah, I-uh, just had a thought about the research is all,” Peter stammered and promptly shut himself up by taking a large bite of his burger.
Vision just smiled a knowing smile.
“Absolutely lovely? More like an absolute nightmare. I can’t wait to hear your ideas on how to explain this to the SI board.”
Peter could feel his face heating up at the confession, but the small genuine smile that broke out over Tony’s face at his admission made the embarrassment totally worth it. Peter loved it when Tony smiled, real true smiles, and on his now younger face he could see how ladies had just dropped into his bed with just a look. He got distracted from that line of thought when Tony wrapped a hand around the back of his neck, squeezing lightly, and Peter hoped Tony wasn’t feeling the same heat on his skin that he was feeling. The skin beneath Tony’s work roughened hand suddenly felt like molten lava.
“No-no sir,” stammered Peter, shaking his head, “you have nothing to apologize to me for! You’ve been great, amazing! Really sir, being able to come spend the weekends here is the only thing that gets me through the week at school.”
Tony shook his head.
“FRIDAY, light of my life, play back footage of Strange’s transformation.”
“I do not require an apology for your absence during your time of recovery from surgery and in your time of grief. I grieve too, for the loss of our comrades and for the mistakes that were made in the disagreement with the Accords.”
And straight into his dick, because life was cruel and decided he needed to have a post saving-the-neighborhood erection every time he came back from his watch of the city lately.
Tony sucked in a breath and nodded, hoping the kid was right to believe in him. He wasn’t feeling as confident as he led Peter to believe, but he meant every word he said. He’d go down trying to keep this world from burning.
“Uh, yeah, it’s me,” Tony answered. He sounded different. Steve could hear a softness there that was not usually associated with Tony Stark. From Steve’s knowledge, the only people who got that side of Tony were privileged few, and his heart wrenched with every beat that it was still there, even after he’d-
“To what do I owe the honor of your presence, Cloak-n-boots?”
They locked her up in a very white bedroom, with no windows, no colors, nothing…only a chair and a bed. Loki never did a thing to give her more freedom and after a while, Yaël understood that she had just been a prisoner. Sometimes, when the guards guided her through the metal, shiny alleys, to some sort of ‘trainingroom’, she could see Loki talking to a screen with a big purple mannish creature on it, which she heard Loki called Thanos.
“Easy on the merchandise,” he jokes out. “War wounds.” He raises his shirt to clarify that he’s not shying away from the check. Then the two are allowed in. Tony knows his way, so he motions for Peter to follow him.
Yaël knew exactly who she had to call.
“So, what can I help you with?” Raido asked her, it was weird to hear English coming from his mouth.
“Excuse me!” Yaël snapped back. “Isn’t that exactly what you’ve done to me?! Remember? The Chitauri?!” Loki lost his self-assurance for just a split-second, Yaël noticed as his eyebrows dropped for a moment. He almost looked sad... And then it was gone again.
Oh, crap, he was looking down without realizing, was he?
“Okay, this must be a joke, right?” Sam wonders in confusion. James shrugs, clearly not getting it, either. After that, the video moves to the last part of the dvd. Here they are back in the bedroom. Tony’s on his belly, clearly shirtless. He’s leaning on his elbows while he looks straight ahead.
Ben is already seated on the chair in front of Reed. He’s looking into a file, but he doesn’t really seem to pay too much attention to it. The seat in front of Sue is still empty. They’re waiting on Johnny. The secretary of State, former General Ross, is talking with one of his colleagues. The guy he brought along, is holding a suitcase and handing Ross a remote.
“There’s some powerful weapons in there, things from back in the day where we were still a weapon’s factory! It’s too dangerous in other people’s hands!”
Everybody stays quiet after that. Ross keeps his eyes on Tony, and Tony stares right back. He’s not going to back down. Impossible.
“I’m afraid we can only allow one person with him, otherwise it’ll be too crowded,” the third nurse says before she can get it. Tony nods, looking at May with wet eyes.
“Nah,” Peter returns, getting himself out of the elevator. “Wait for me, I’m joining ya.”
“I’m not planning on disappointing him, honestly, what do you even think of me? I’m just not going to like it a whole lot.”
“You think, what?” Natasha urged on, walking forward and putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder to assure him that she’s there. Steve cleared his throat once more.
Looking up old pictures of Mary didn’t particularly help, either.
Peter nods, giving her a smile now that she can actually see it. After that, he gets up as well, pulling his mask back down.
the Stormbreaker. The axe is hanging over his shoulder, underneath the cape. Mjölir, though, is hanging over his hip, looking so in place next to him. It was hard to imagine Thor with another weapon, so seeing Mjölnir next to him is kind of comforting.
The rooms are pretty much alright. A few of Clint and Wanda’s possessions might have been destroyed, but all the other stuff can easily be moved back to the tower. The moving people are already on it, just like FRIDAY and Peter are already busy with bringing everybody to their respective floors. Tony just sighs, kicking away a small stone on the ground.
When they get to the vows, Steve had forgotten about the fact that Thor’s speech is close to eleven minutes long. He feels a bit guilty that he didn’t warn him more about it, but Thor’s just very stubborn.
According to the schedule Mr. Stark had made for him, he doesn’t need to show up today. Of course, he knows he’s not going to stay home at all. He needs to know if everything is alright; did they do the right thing there, yesterday?
Of course, her father and she celebrated it together every decade, which had his charms too. Well, that actually looked a bit more like how the people on earth celebrated it, but more… cozy? Warm? There were no gifts, it was only about the people, the family.  She didn’t know how to put it, but the vibe was different. And the last few decades, since Cem passed, she had been celebrating her birthday all on her own.
“Alright,” Bruce says. “We’ll call up a search party, but other than that I suggest we all just calm down for a bit, catch up on some sleep.”
“I know, to the Asgardians, my life might be short, over in just a blink of an eye. But I’ll try my damnest to make that blink of an eye worthwhile for everybody. For you as your wife. For our child as a mother. For Asgard as her Queen. Because I know that, by your side, I can do things I would never have been able to imagine, and I need to thank you for that.”
It was dark when Yaël opened her eyes a second later and she was pretty sure there was someone laying on top of her.
“Listen, kid, there’s obviously some things we need to talk about,” Tony starts after they’ve been driving for five minutes. They’re already stuck in traffic, and immediately Tony regrets not taking the suit to fly them out of here.
“You didn’t
“Yes, I wish I was the one who’d let it explode, but this friend of yours was a very unexpected turn to my plan.”
Yaël got herself dressed and a few hours later, after ordering some pizza, she heard a knock on the door.
“I’m so sorry, Peter. Steve… it was all my fault,” Tony admits. Peter doesn’t answer. But what can he say?
"The only thing we know is that she worked together with that idiotic piece of shit, you can't deny that. She's friends with him."
So Peter hurries home after detention. He only has about three hours before he needs to be at Liz’ house, and he has close to no suit at all. And May is there to help. They put some stuff together. With a credit card Tony provided them, they managed to get a suit. The woman helps him getting the tie right. Then she gives suggestions for a corsage, which Peter goes to get next.
Tony doesn’t turn around, all too aware that Rhodey is giving him a glare.
“Gross, man, I don’t need to know about what you and Steve are doing when I’m gone!” Peter mutters, complaining about the image he desperately tries to get out of his mind.
‘No I’m not.’
“Oh?” Wade said as he heard the bitterness in her voice. Stark had brainwashed her, because Yaël was sure Peter didn’t hate her…Right?
“I- I,” he starts, but he can’t continue. What was he doing? Was he really about to kill this guy? A mere human who has no possible way to defend himself? Disgusted with his own, Peter lets go of him, taking a few steps back and trying to place that weird stinging in his chest. His heart is beating like crazy.
“I’VE BEEN –uh- ‘PERSUADING’ THIS MAN TO TELL ME ADARO’S NAME FOR AN HOUR!” Yaël shouted, still steering fire at the statue, working on the facial details.
“Tony, there was an Everett Ross on the line, he wanted to talk to you about another meet-up for the accords so you can- oh, hello Peter, I didn’t know you were here?”
romantic than that, he supposes.
The only bad thing about Liz’ neighborhood? The lack of tall buildings. With absolutely nowhere to shoot his webs at, he finds himself stranded on the ground, meaning that his journey to the blue explosions has just become a whole lot harder.
Flash is lucky that his house is quite separated from the others, otherwise the police would have been here a lot earlier.
“Hey Petey, are you alright?” he asks, reaching out for Peter. In a jump, Peter is out of his seat. The whole class is now looking at him, wondering why he’s reacting so weird. But Peter can’t speak, because he only sees Harry there and he isn’t sure if it’s Harry or the Goblin.
“There’s many disturbing things that have happened that I know of. And I’m sorry for all of it.”
“I’m spontaneous, there’s a difference.” Then he grabs the water bottle on the table and throws it up in the air, winking at Peter and hurrying back to his own place. When the bottle comes back down, it lands perfectly.
, whatever that means.
It goes on, Tony joining in on the dancing much like they practiced until he grabs the shield back and strikes his final pose. He’s a bit out of breath, waiting for the lights to die down. He’s sweating like crazy, realizing that this suit is not really optimal for fighting at all. The fact that people believed Steve went into battle with this was to be honest the most disbelieving part of this all.
“So she’s trying to make you into a murder-assassin, right?”
“No, or, uh, yeah, kind of. Maybe… Nobody knows,” Yaël answered while rubbing her sore leg. Maybe she’s a bit more grateful for Hilde pushing her wheelchair this time, as her hand still didn’t feel alright yet either.
So, yeah, here Peter is sitting, doodling on his piece of paper while getting spit-balls against the back of his head by the guy he might have seriously hurt when his emotions got out of control. He deserves the punishment that he’ll get, but he very much hopes that Flash, too, gets what he deserves. It’s been going on for long enough, after all.
“Oh, some sparring, huh? Beware, I don’t hold back,” the girl warns him. Peter ignores her, instead groaning when suddenly the soles of her shoe smash against his face. Instantly, he reaches for his head in search for the damage, but he quickly realizes he can’t see it just yet.
“Th-thank you Mr. Stark,” Peter says. After finally managing to put everything away, he accepts the hand Tony had held out, and shakes it.
“Hey, don’t ignore me! What does the Goblin want with you, and has it anything to do with the destruction of our hallway?”
After that, Tony hung up, and Steve turned to Sam, who looked at him knowingly.
Peter nods, feeling quite small all of the sudden. He’s glad she can’t see his face underneath the mask, otherwise she would see the guilty expression he’s giving her.
Like that wasn’t bad enough, Steve joined the scenery. He let his shield drop, looking like he had been or still was is some heavy combat.
“Get a higher frequency!” Bruce shouts somewhere. He figures that Tony agrees, as suddenly the fight seems less straining. The parts that were crawling back up his face come loose, and it even get to a point where it looks like the suit wants to get off as quickly as possible. Peter sits up the moment he feels like everything is off, throwing the black goo – the thing he remembers seeing back on the crash site – somewhere in the room. Tony seems prepared for it, dropping a container on it the moment it’s free of Peter.
“Okay, pain-meds are taken, injection-place has been disinfected. Needle is free of air. Let’s get this show on the road.” Tony clears his throat, looking behind him into the mirror. “On one.”
He falls for maybe just a few seconds. In that time, he sees the ground get closer. He hears the Goblin escaping, and Iron Man’s thrusters getting louder. He feels the air all around him, blowing into his hair. He feels his heart skip a bit, his breath escaping his lungs.
But, Wanda did tell him that Stark has been living in the compound lately, rather than his probably very luxury penthouse at the tower. Could Mrs. Potts departure be the reason for that?
“Steve, wake up, we’re going to bed,” Tony tells him softly. Steve hums against him.
“Always am,” Peter says with a wink. Then he puts the mask back on and throws himself over the balcony. There’s a lot of things for him to think about tonight.
Well, that must be Peter’s cue to leave, right? He holds the bag on his shoulder a bit tighter before clearing his throat.
“Why not?”
“Who’d you convince to even agree on going on a date with you?” Clint asks jokingly, taking another swing from his beer while Vision makes his move on the table.
“Glad to see you too, sweet cheeks, I’m here with an offer to make.”
“Thanks,” he says, though still out of breath. “Are you two over there already agreeing that you’re not going to win against me?”
Once Tony returns with a cotton drenched in cleaning alcohol, he feels Peter’s eyes on him. He’s aware the teenager is looking at him with those big brown peepers, but he tries not to let it show. He doesn’t need Peter to start asking questions, because first Tony needs somebody to talk about the issue with.
“Exactly,” Charles says, sounding amused. “Now, I know it’s asking a lot, but there has been only one person alive that Wade here has any bit of respect for.”
Yaël’s eyes itched so badly, she felt tears running down her face. Being cold while standing in warm smoke was a strange feeling. Moving her fingers started to feel weird. All her instincts yelled at her, she needed to do something or she’d die in that stupid cage. With one hand, she kept knocking the rock against the wall, with the other, she wiped away her tears.
“Status update, FRIDAY?” Peter asks.
He awakens about an hour later, hanging upside down in the dark of the night with no memory of how he got here.
“No,” he admits. Tony feels bad for him. He shouldn’t have gotten dragged along into this. Tony wraps an arm around the boy’s shoulders and pulls him closer. Once Peter’s leaning against Tony, still bouncing nervously, Tony kisses him gently on the top of his head.
“Hey, what is that?” Yaël suddenly asks, making everybody look up in surprise. Outside, they can see something… shining? It’s like a star, but a
lies in a hospital bed, he just had surgery, had shrapnel taken out of his leg and had the back of his head stitched up. He has a concussion. You don’t really want to leave because of this, do you?”
“Thanks,” Yaël answered with a wide grin “They are so cool! I mean like, who the heck has plates like these?”
And it’s because of Peter that Steve realized how very much in love with Tony Stark he really is.
Miles nods at him, still unable to believe that this is happening to him right now. Before he can say anything, Spider-Man jumps into the air, disappearing in the dark shadows of the night. Miles finds that his mouth has dropped open from the shock.
“If you’re no longer with MJ, who are you going to ask for senior prom?” Peter then asks. Harry hums in thought.
Seeing that Thor and Hilde were keeping Hela busy, Yaël took a few steps back and started retracting water from Hela’s body. Hela was so caught up in the fight that she didn’t even notice. At least until she knocked downBrunnhilde and Thor, who climbed up again and yelled to dreadlock-guy to go.
How to train your Tony Stark: Pepper Potts has a lot of patience, but it's about ready to run out when she learns Tony's escaped from the hospital
“You need to push it, then pull it down before pulling it up,” he explains. Hilde hums in understanding, and when she does it, Tony lets out another relieved breath as the suit opens up around him. The late-summer air hitting him at last, Tony rolls out of the suit despite how much it hurts his leg.
Tony urges on carefully, pulling away his mask. As if on cue, the Quinjet flies over them, landing not too far from where they are sitting.
“We have a deal, remember? You ask when you ready, that’s what we agreed on,” Steve then hisses at him. Tony’s frown deepens for a bit, but then he takes a deep breath.
“I’m glad that there’s at least someone who cares about him – a lot,” Peter finishes. Right when Steve turns to look at him with horror written all over his face, Peter opens the door and heads outside into the rain. “Maybe someday he’ll notice it, too?”
(In)correct Quotes part 3: this one speaks for itself.
Would he even have met Steve? He shivers at the thought of never having met him.
Mantis blinks once, those large black eyes seeming confused. Then, before she can even reach out her hand, Lady Sif interrupts them.
No further explanation, no more words said. The call is disconnected, and Peter can only hear some ringing in his ear. But, at the same time, he can’t move.
Maybe it’s a bit stupid of him to go. After all, she and Harry have only just broken up. And sure, they both don’t really seem upset about their break-up, and MJ
Everybody raises their eyebrows at him, simultaneously crossing their arms. It’s Tony who speaks up.
“This man obviously isn’t from around here… But why does he understand Norwegian? And why does he know about Valhalla, but not in the way we believe in it?” Oh, right, Raido thought they were still speaking Norwegian… and he was asking some good questions. Lopt looked a bit surprised. But his face quickly started showing annoyance.
“Uh, sir, te-tech-technically this is my dad’s car, sir, so I can’t really-“
given in?
“Are you sure you want to know the answer to this?” she then asks, suddenly completely serious. Peter just shrugs, realizing that she’s giving him the option to escape the answer. But even though he’s sure he doesn’t
Someone passed her in the hallway and Yaël could’ve sworn the man was staring at her strangely. But when she looked up, he had already turned his head and was walking away from her. What was that about?
The man who hated her without giving her a second chance.
“Their King being Odin?” Tony asks, going to the next page. Sharon shakes her head.
When Peter tries to talk to Wanda about it, she asks him not to bring it up again. Instead, the two decide to watch a movie and get some distraction. It’s the next day that everybody
“Tony-“ he starts. Tony ignores it.
“Guys, this is my nephew Peter,” Natasha greets with a fond smile, and Peter feels a warm feeling upon hearing ‘nephew’ coming out of Natasha’s mouth. “He needs to learn.”
Steve opens up a door for him, nodding inside as a gesture for Peter to move forward. Peter hesitates only a little bit before clearing his throat and getting in.
“She wanted to water the flowers, of all things. We don’t even have flowers here, right?” Tony turns to Wanda, who just shrugs.
“If this is some sort of prank to make me talk to you again it’s really not-“
“Nothing much, just a talk with Mr. Stark to get an internship at his company,” Peter says in a soft shrug. Steve then smiles at him.
“Means you did a good job, right?” Peter suggests, and Dr. Cho just hums. Once she finishes with the last stitches, she moves up to throw everything away before cleaning her hands again, turning her chair back towards Peter.
“Hey, as a father I feel like it’s my job to make bad jokes,” Tony counters. Peter smiles, liking how easily Tony has adapted himself into the job of fatherhood. It hasn’t been that hard for Peter, either.
here?!”
“Wow, did you read this?” Peter asks after a few minutes of looking through the paper. Miles nods before shrugging.
Tony doesn’t know what to say. He stays quiet, waiting for Steve to continue.
Well, except for her…
“What’s- what do you want? Who are you?” Bruce asks in confusion, scratching his hair in confusion.
Tony chuckles, though it sounds forced. He turns his head back until he looks up at the ceiling. “No, I’m not. It’s not going to stop you, I already know that.”
Wanda finally looks up, eyes wet and clearly shaken by what happened.
They leave Oscorp rather quickly. There’s no surprising addition of Norman or any other person from Oscorp. Traffic is still in full swing, despite the time. Tony has to admit that he’s practically jumping into his seat.
“Yeah, top floor. Neat, no?”
They don’t stop. Instead, they even involve the biggest man-child of them all; Barton. Natasha catches them talking about it during breakfast (great conversation material…), during training, and during simple relax-time.
That’s Cap, Tony is sure of it. He tries to open his eyes but the light is too much. As he wrinkles his nose, he feels that there’s another tube pushed through it. Crap, that hadn’t been comfortable the last time back in Afghanistan. Out of reflex, Tony reaches up to pull it out, only to have a strong hand stop him.
Out of the blue, Yaël heard a door slam shut behind her again, and again she turned around. She saw a tall, long-black-haired man walking away from the cottage staring at the ground as he walked. His hair did get soaked, but he didn’t seem to care as he was sunken deeply in thoughts. Yaël got curious and took a quick glance behind her to see if Mr. Blonde Ambition could see him too, but her mysterious friend had disappeared. Weird dream…
And there they pretend to make some more groaning, enjoying themselves and whatnot. Not too much later Tony starts shouting that he has soap in his eyes. He runs out of the shower, revealing his swimming trunk to their three-person audience.
That, though, that hurt a bit. Especially when Mary moves forward to hold on to his face, attempting to pull away the supposed make-up he’s wearing according to her. When she finds nothing but skin she startles, pulling her hand back.
“Ah, come on babe, don’t be angry,” Tony says. He leans forward until he’s resting against Steve’s chest, his head against Steve’s shoulder. “Forget the crapping part and just go on to the rest.”
“You know, in case you were trying to be ‘mean’,” Tony does some airquotes to accentuate his point, “it’s pretty much failing given the fact that I
Ross responds. Then he hangs up the phone, and Tony hears nothing more than a beeping sound. Eventually, he lowers the phone and lets out another long sigh. Natasha squeezes his shoulder in response.
“I suspect you’re here for Yaël, aren’t you?” the man asks. Peter nods, unable to say anything. “You’re welcome to come inside. I’ll go wake her.”
“Jackpot,” her voice calls out. Peter turns around and finds her kneeling in front of some sort of safe. One she somehow managed to open. Carefully, Peter walks up to her.
“C’mon Natalia,” James hisses in return. “Hey Steve, we have a little question.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll remind you to call her,” Charles said, taking account with how distracted and confused Yaël could be. The man also frequently reminded her of the stress-relieving exercises, like meditating, the psychiatrist told her to do, and because she sometimes felt uncomfortable or slightly ashamed for doing these; Charles made sure there was nobody going to bother her when she needed her minute alone.
“Pick my battles wisely? Did you guys get to choose in the invasion? Did you guys get too choose when Thanos arrived on Earth? I didn’t see you guys
Peter and Wade didn’t even notice her clumsiness, because while struggling with the tiles, Yaël had already frozen Wade up to his neck without even noticing it. Yup, that’s exactly why Fury said she wasn’t trained enough. She quickly stopped the freezing procedure. Wade looked at her sheepishly, but she didn’t feel sorry.
FRIDAY tells him. Peter sits up in confusion.
Not My School: Peter is afraid to admit to his father that he doesn't want to go to MIT
It frustrates him to no end, not being able to sleep. It’s been getting harder to do that, too. He should try again. Tony clears his throat and squeezes his eyes shut this time.
” she says, and Peter waits for his father’s image to show up on the screen. Of course, it’s clear that the line is still busy, so he hangs up again and decides to bring it up when he gets back home. He leaves the group, and swings up into the sky, moving from Brooklyn to Queens, until he’s back in Midtown. That’s when he sees it.
Crap, this is the reason
“Yet you don’t want me to sign them?” Peter asks, unimpressed by that answer.
“I didn’t believe you when you said you know Stark, but I figure I was wrong.”
Without giving the other things any attention, Tony opens the file with a blink of an eye. There’s more documents in there, along with one video file.
“It doesn’t like fire, either,” Gwen adds. Peter closes his eyes, trying to shake the uncomfortable feeling off.
Tony hums. Blinking twice before shaking his head. That sneaky kid…
“Wait a sec,” Yaël protested “We were doing great without your
“What the-?” Clint gets out. Natasha already knows what is next. There’s a whole cinematic sequence she had too much fun filming. A slow camera shot that passes over several pieces of clothing that accentuate once more what they’re supposedly watching. After that, Natasha made sure to tilt the camera up until it’s showing only Steve, lying on the bed.
“You’re too fucking drunk to even remember this dickwad stealing my girl, don’t you?” Eddie asks, huffing out an annoyed breath while pointing at Peter. A few heads turn towards Peter in confusion.
But as he sits here, he feels a bit of sadness inside of him. Wasn’t he going to come here with Tony, Steve and Bruce after Octavius’ presentation? What even happened to the guy? Last night he was still in the hospital, but he hasn’t really looked him up again after this.
“Yes, I mean, maybe we should keep an eye on him…” Yaël mumbled as she saw Wade and Logan turn around, while everybody else was still frozen. Charles forced them to calm down and go to separate rooms, he was probably going to have a talk with them after this mess got cleaned up.
As Tony opens up his mouth, it’s Steve who interrupts him.
“Come on, Cap, we’re curious beings, you know!” Clint counters. Steve’s hand comes up to cover his eyes.
If he has a parent that’s still alive, he has to know about it.
“Yes, well, the nurse will come and take some blood samples, and after that we’ll plan a few more diagnostic tests if that’s alright?” he asks. One quick look at the nurse, and the woman nods and hurries out of the room to fetch her materials. Then, to the other doctors, she starts naming up a few medications that she’s prescribing Tony, but he isn’t listening. The only thing he’s thinking about is the possibility of what could be wrong with him.
Tony doesn’t react. He clears his throat.
That would all have been better than this. Not being recognized by your own parent? Peter blinks twice before looking back up at the girl.
“The test came positive, he
Lopt signed her to follow him. As they walked closer towards the light, which appeared to be a campfire, she saw herself lying next to it. Her other-self woke up and started looking around. Of course, this past-version of her couldn’t see her actual self and Lopt standing there. The other Yaël looked terrified as she discovered she was completely alone in a dark and deep cave.
“Oh shit,” Yaël mumbled, she looked around while rubbing her sore hands and could finally breathe again.
, Tony thinks to himself. They had been dealing with Ultron back when it happened, so they weren’t in New York. To imagine, had Tony not created such a mess, they might have been able to save her.
Steve frowned, like the serious man he was, when he answered: “Yes, we have a new prisoner.”
“Put him through,” Peter sighs, throwing his legs over the edge of the building and swinging them back and forth. Then he sees Tony’s face appear on his vision. “Heya dad.”
“Yeah?” Steve agrees, realization only dawning on him then. “Oh, I get it. You’re afraid she’s going to try and steal your stuff and sell it afterwards?”
“Karen, what happened?”
Wanda and Vision offer him to try and build something. But while Vision tells him to go for something practical, Wanda says to make something that comes out from her heart. In the end, Peter left the two as they were starting up an argument he didn’t want to be a part of.
“I- I wasn’t?” Peter can’t even find it in himself to react to the sudden snap he’s getting from Tony. Sure, the guy’s clearly pissed off and ready to start throwing insults all around the place, but Peter doesn’t care. Because his father’s not making any sense at all.
“Ever thought about the fact that maybe it’s none of your fucking business?”
Hope closes her eyes, unknowing of what to do with the praise. Tony squeezes her shoulder once again shortly before letting go. He turns back to the couch, where he can see Scott sleeping against Bruce’s shoulder. Bruce is still talking with Steve about something.
“You know what’s fun about hanging around in the school?” Wade asked while his wooden horse went up. They were sitting on a horse-mill, a classic one, made of wood and painted with pretty colors.
“I know this wasn’t exactly something you or Steve could help me with,” Peter returns. He clicks his tongue while thinking about his words. “And you both seem to know that, otherwise you wouldn’t have involved Nat.”
So, if you notice something strange in this or one of our other stories from this series, please keep in mind that everything is under reconstruction. Also, please report illogical faults, plotholes and such, if you want to, of course :)
“No, I don’t, but I don’t like fighting for something like this, either. Can’t you just talk to the others? You’re God gave you a mouth so you’d solve problems in a more civilized way, Steve,” Yaël hissed. Oh, how Yaël hoped nobody was going to ask Peter, well, Spider-Man, to help in the fight. And if someone did, she surely whished the boy would use his common sense and keep himself out of this exploding situation.
“STEVE!”
Peter snorts again, wondering when he’s ever been careful. For the past few days he’s been wandering around in the compound, checking out the place and figuring out where everything exactly is. He’s been planning this for a while, waiting for the right opportunity. The best one is when both Steve and Tony are distracted, since they’re the ones who will mostly be looking for him. The others probably think he’s already heading back home.
she tells him. “
Don’t. Go. For. The. Chest.
“Hey, you once vaguely mentioned you would do it with me! It helps if we sign up now so at least we’ll have a spot in the team for next year!”
“You want to return to New York, am I not mistaking?” T’Challa continues the conversation while they exit one hallway to get into another one.
“PETAH!” she shouts, pronouncing it wrong on purpose. She’s never called him ‘Peter’ before, instead going for ‘Petah’ all the time. She says it’s because of her dialect, but Peter knows it has something to do with her reading the Hunger Games books.
Even in Peter’s mind Gwen starts to make jokes. “
“Well, yeah, he did some horrible shit, Peter. You can’t deny that, hell, he even attacked you two times already-“
Finally, when his vision is back to the way it’s supposed to be, Tony reaches for the fridge to get out the bottle of water. It’s too late for coffee, and they don’t really have much else in the house anymore. So Tony gets himself a glass of water, walks towards their bedroom and sits down on the bed while he searches trough his nightstand.
“Hey!” he shouts. The girl is already back underneath the window.
“And why exactly do you need me to come along?” Tony asks after Steve hands him the helmet for his motorcycle. Tony gives it a long look before putting it on, a bit smug about the Captain America pattern drawn on it. Meanwhile, Steve takes out one, but Iron Man-themed instead.
But Natasha took Steve’s hand while he was trying to walk away. Her cold skin against his felt weird, but not unpleasant. Right when she was about to open her mouth, the elevator opened up, showing Pepper walking inside as she took off her high heels and loosened her hair.
Peter finds himself dancing with some girls he never even met. Much to his surprise, even a few guys start rubbing up on him when there doesn’t seem to be much pace for anybody to move. And Peter doesn’t care at all, because he’s having fun. And for once, people don’t see him as the loser, or the nerd that can’t keep his family together.
“Because English is no problem to me, neither is Norwegian…but that Sil of you people, it gives me a headache.”
“I’m up here!” comes from somewhere. Peter looks up, finding a hole in the ceiling. There, indeed, he can see her suddenly walk up to him, kneeling down with her hands grabbing the edge of the floor. “Can I pass these two down to you? It’s too dangerous to jump from here.”
Peter snorts. “Don’t worry, Dad, I’m sure she wouldn’t have done that at all. She would have tried subtler ways to make you pay,” he assures him. Tony just frowns, looking down at his plate for a bit as he starts to wonder what exactly happened that day.
“What?”
“Eh, maybe another time?” he offers. He knows it’s college and that he’s supposed to just go out and have fun, but honestly? Hanging out with MJ tonight sounds ten times better. “You just go to your party. And you know the rule!”
But then his eyes fall onto a security-badge lying next to his pencils. There he can read the name ‘Lincoln Jones’ on it. The guy doesn’t notice it, though, eyes instead focused on the screen.
"No problem," Yaël mumbled, but it was obvious that the conversation had been about her. Who did Yaël work with? Was she supposed to be the villain? What the heck was her role in this weird world? The rain rattled around, but it seemed like it couldn’t touch the man in front of her. It fell right through him, like he wasn’t there at all. Even the wind didn’t touch his hair.
Tony doesn’t know how they’ve suddenly ended up in an airconditioned room. He can only vaguely recall the two of them, running back inside with their fingers tangled together. Steve probably knows his way through the gardens.
“You’re such a fucking dickface, you know that, right?” Eddie complains, shoving Flash the moment he reaches him. Flash makes a questioning noise. “Having a pleasant chat with the Penis here, aren’t you?”
Yaël felt sad, looking at her sister. She should’ve been there for her, like a real big sis. But on the other hand, Yaël was going to make the same dumb faults as Peter had made by visiting Harry in his cell. Maybe Yaël had no talent for being a responsible sister. Or maybe she needed to make her own mistakes too. But whilst Peter had a father and an aunt who’d catch him when he fell, she didn’t even have a big brother who was always there for her. Maybe Yaël felt a bit sick of being responsible, since she managed to fail at that every freaking time. She should’ve been the sister who braided Nilla’s hair, Yaël thought while softly touching the window, imagining the scene.
“Being?” Yaël asked while putting the card in the back pocket of her pants.
Tony doesn’t notice his breathing speeding up, but he can feel his heartbeat rising. His eyes stay glued on the cuffs, his brain unable to understand why it’s attached to Steve, of all people. Who ratted him out? Who was so heartless as to report Steve to the authorities?
“There’s some readings we need to analyze,” Fury says, nodding towards Sharon once she passes them by. She gives Tony a smile and waves at him. Tony waves back, forcing the corners of his lips up as well but not feeling the joy exactly.
“So, how is she, your mom?” Yaël saw the curiosity in Brunnhilde’s eyes.
Peter had smiled at her. “Maybe, yeah.”
“You must be Hela,” Thor said .“I’m Thor, son of Odin.”
Alright, better not hesitate too much. Tony holds up his badge towards the identification scanner, and then the door opens up to him.
“Eyes on the road, kid!” suddenly comes out as a warning, and Peter immediately turns his head back, seeing that a group of people is about to cross the road. Quickly, he hits the brakes, allowing them to pass.
“Thank you,” she says after he motions for her that she can pass. He doesn’t really know what to feel when her hand is gently put on his shoulder for a few seconds only to be pulled away again. Wordlessly, Peter turns around to see her walk away.
in any way – though that’s probably because of his continuous avoiding behavior to things that trigger him.
FRIDAY asks. Peter frowns.
herself is an intruder to our planet. She isn’t Helvegian, God knows what she is!”
“Now I feel ashamed for even thinking about leaving you,” Steve then admits. Tony lets out a loud huff, his hand going to his chest while he sags back on the couch.
“You, my friend, are
Peter reaches out, letting his fingers touch the cold metal of the suit. It looks like a merge of Iron Man and Spider-Man. The design is amazing, the suit solid. It shines, lacking any scratches. Peter even wonders if it flies.
Suddenly, the two Avengers stop, pointing towards a room with a closed door. Peter doesn’t need them to tell him who’s inside. He nods, takes a deep breath, and opens up the door to walk in. All too aware of the heads turning his way, Peter is faced with all the other members of the Avengers staring at him. He feels small, like they’re all judging him. They did tell him to just go, to listen to Steve.
Bruce closes his screens again and nervously plucks his glasses off his nose. “Right, I’ll be there in a minute,” he then says. Peter nods and leaves the room again. When he’s back to his living room, Harry’s still making his explanation to MJ, who still looks a little bit surprised. Tony, at the kitchenette, looks at it all in fascination.
“For having these weird powers?” she interrupted him.
It’s weird to hear her voice again. Tony leans forward a bit, trying to capture what he’s seeing in front of him, but reminding himself that she’s no longer there.
“PARKER!” he shouts, and Peter’s not sure if it’s Venom calling out, or Eddie. They both hate him equally.
“Yeah, yeah, just try,” Tony mutters. “Anything from Steve or Peter?”
“So, I can go home tonight?” he asks. Did he ask it before? The way everybody seems to groan and roll their eyes indicates that maybe that’s not the case.
I'm a woman.
," Tony explains casually. He grabs an apple from the fruit-basket and takes a big bite out of it. Steve raises an eyebrow after that, and Peter, too, gives him his most unimpressed look.
Ned clarifies.
“How did that happen?” Bruce asks in confusion. Tony hides behind his glass, so Peter speaks up.
“It’s amazing,” Dr. Cho says, though she’s not as surprised as the other doctors. “Your liver is working just as well as Steve’s. It’s burning through your medications more quickly than they used to so we’re going to have to change your dose again.”
“Still, I’m sure I can reach the castle on my own,” Lopt’s arrogance pulled her out of her thoughts. Yaël and Raido simultaneously glanced sarcastically at Lopt, which made him raise his eyebrow. “You guys underestimate my powers…” he grumbled.
But she literally couldn’t, she felt more worthless than ever. Her powers didn’t save anyone, but it ruined cities. There was nothing she could do to help these people. People would always hurt other people. Yaël was never going to be a hero, not with her shifty powers and not with her bad decisions.
The twitch in her eyes seems to have caught Norman’s attention, who starts to turn around to see what Mary’s looking at. There’s a short moment of panic before Mary almost shouts it out and reaches for Norman’s arm.
“No takebacks, a bet is a bet, and you lost it, so now you have to pay up.”
Why he avoids every single belltower, meaning every church in the neighborhood. He doesn’t want to be near them, fearing too much that he would relive the moments where he had Gwen so close within his grasp, but he only arrived too late.
In comes Mr. Stark’s new assistant – Peter has failed to get her name before. She’s a tall, blonde woman, dressed in a tight black skirt and a loose white top. When Peter takes a look at her heels, he wonders if that could even be comfortable to stand in.
“Jesus, Parker, I guess ‘penis’
“What’s that about me?” she asks.
Grabbing some of his dad’s spare clothes that always linger in the workshop, Peter removes the suit and drops it on the workbench. Suspiciously, he keeps an eye on the suit. Now that he’s no longer wearing it he feels… weaker? Is that possible?
piece of art,” he returns. Natasha rolls her eyes.
“Peter, I know this is kind of awkward, but… uh… it’s not really that unusual for us to, you know, have some fun, right?” Tony scratches his head, while Steve scratches his beard. The two make a lot of effort not to let their eyes meet Peter’s.
Tony turns back to the room, seeing Peter sitting on his bed with his head in his hands. He looks like he’s crying, but his shoulders aren’t moving. When Peter’s hands go through his hair, he startles up, looking down at his hands.
I'm pretty sure scholarships don't really work this way; I have absolutely no idea how the American school-system works, no matter how much research I do on it. It's probably even still too early for Peter to try and get the scholarship, but after watching Homecoming we changed the story to fit Tom Holland's version into it. The first version of the story picked up after Amazing Spider-Man 2, where Peter graduated but DIDN'T go to college.
After that, Felicia starts running off towards another building, moving in an elegant way that makes Peter wonders if she’s very agile. She certainly moves that way. Then he pokes Johnny in the side.
“No, that’s alright,” Mary quickly says. She taps the computer gently. “I’m going to back up some of Richard’s logs since I’m here anyway. I’ll lock up when I get out.”
Yaël got up and put the disc in the DVD-player and turned on the TV. She gave Peter a bowl of ice and a spoon.
"Alright, who-ever put the teams together really didn't think this through," Steve mutters, looking at the tablet and staring at the names. "I mean, they're right; they have three master-assassins."
Peter lies down on his back, looking up into the dark sky. The sad thing about New York is the lack of stars during the night.
“Dude, I think you should go with them,” Johnny tells him carefully. He’s right, of course, but that doesn’t mean that Peter is ready to have the lecture of a lifetime. Who knows, maybe they’ll take the suit again from him. It wouldn’t be the first time, after all… They can’t ground him since he lives in here, they can’t stop him being Spider-Man since he still has his old suit – however horrible it is.
Tony quickly looks at the clock on the wall. Eleven in the morning? How did that happen? Crap, he needs to sleep after this shit.
Bruce sits down as well. Peter takes the seat next to him. Then the two of them wait for Strange to start.
- Mentions of panic attacks
Well, okay, her apartment comes close to being that, though.
Next to the couch, there’s the source of the noise. Apparently, the girl has moved the crib for the baby out of her bedroom and brought it here. Surely aware that she would fall asleep on the spot. Tony decides not to wake her up, instead heading towards the fussing baby lying down. He’s not crying, rather just… kicking his legs, clearly done sleeping for the evening.
They don’t have sex anymore. Tony’s always in the workshop, and whenever he comes to bed, Pepper’s already asleep or about to get up to get to work. He doesn’t hold her anymore when they lie in bed together, doesn’t talk about his day the way he used to.
“What, I’m just making telling fact to these kids?”
The door led to a small hallway, with on each side more doors.
“Hey! Don’t walk away from me!” the other person, a man, shouts. Michelle snaps something back in a lowered voice. Then, eventually, she starts walking off carrying her bag over her shoulder and keeping her thick coat closed with her hands. Peter follows her with his eyes for a short while until she’s passing a corner, and then he leans back on the roof.
“Psychiatric hospital,” he answers dryly. “Getting treatment for my depression. Which nobody knows about, obviously.”
“Benjamin,” Peter then answers, not really telling the truth but not lying, either. Benjamin is his second name, after all. He just never really uses it.
“STEVE!” Natasha hisses again. Steve nods again. He’ll round it up.
It’s not so much
“Probably...” Loki shrugged. “But the reason I actually came to you tonight is to tell you I’m probably going to leave this planet. I don’t really know how yet... but since Thor arrived, I suppose he’ll stir everything up just to get out of here and that probably involves me.” Suddenly Yaël remembered Loki looking down on her from the VIP-section in the audience.
Four weeks.
“Steve?!” Yaël yelped as she saw the blue eyes as soon as the walls were gone and they were back in the open air. Steve was still holding his shield above them, as protection, even though there had just been a ‘roof’, built by Yaël, above them.
“You two alright as well?” he asks. Steve shrugs.
Cap points up towards – what a surprise – Oscorp, where Peter can see Iron Man and War Machine fighting together to hold off some strange green creature. Peter’s stomach drops then, realizing who exactly it is they’re fighting.
“… but that’s why we’re here now. Dad, you need to tell Steve what you told me earlier.”
“I’m sure you guys can manage without me,” he says plainly. Dum-E comes rolling up to Steve, giving him a poke in the side to get his attention. “Rhodey’s back in town, isn’t he? Ask if he wants to fill in.”
“Dad, I-“
“It won’t stay down,” Peter mutters. Aunt May hurries towards him and makes quick work of styling his hair back down. When she, too, fails at it, she just takes off the cap she’s wearing and puts it on Peter’s head instead.
People think that Tony never listens.
“What do you mean?” he asks.
She should call Cap and ask him… Yaël used to discuss everything with the man, because it always seemed he had some kind of answer to all of her weird questions and his patience was golden. She could ask these mutant-questions to Wade too, but the whole point was that she missed calling Steve for the simplest things. And having a conversation with Wade could go anywhere instead of getting answers.
been on Peter’s mind for a little while.
MJ literally growls at him, snapping her teeth together in the direction of his hands. Venom pulls back, a loud laugh thundering through the square.
They’re in what seems like a bedroom. Their lips once again attached. Only shortly do they pull away to let Steve take off his shirt. Tony throws it away somewhere on the ground. Steve undoes the buttons of his own shirt. It joins the other quickly.
Tony shook his head, “No, that’s OK.”  The music swelled suddenly, and Tony found himself practically in Steve’s lap.  He grinned sheepishly, curling into Steve’s warm arms.  “Actually, make that a yes.  If that’s all right?”
Tony just knew he was turning red from Steve’s attack, and he batted helplessly at Steve’s hands.  “Please,” he gasped around laughs.  “My stomach hurts, I need to breathe!”  Thankfully Steve had mercy on him, and Tony took a few moments to catch his breath.  He looked up at his grinning boyfriend, whose cheeks were tinged red and stretched wide in a joyful grin.
Leaning more of his weight on one elbow, Steve brushed Tony’s hair out of his face, running a finger across his eyebrows, down his nose and over his lips, then repeated that a few times.  Tony hummed, eyes closing as he enjoyed the personal attention from his Dom.  “When you’re ready, you’re going to give me the tags and come back to me, all right honey?  We’ll take a quick shower, I’ll order some pizza to be delivered and then we can have a nice evening in, huh?”
“Oh yes, but I fear they have a few more hours in them.  Particularly,” Sarah added, pointing at boys and laughing, “if they keep sneaking candy, the little boogers.”
Steve laughed, making Tony bounce slightly against his chest.  “Says the one who actually
The next twenty - thirty? - minutes passed peacefully, with Steve only getting up to change Tony’s pose ever so slightly a few times.  Steve couldn’t resist running his hands up Tony’s thighs, loving the way Tony whined when he got close to his sub’s straining cock.  He debated giving him a few strokes, but with the ring around it, it would only make Tony more tense and that wasn’t the point for today.
Tony scoffed.  “As if there were any other option.”
, come in me, let me
The camera flashing in his peripheral brought him back to the moment, and Tony felt his cheeks warm up when he looked to see Mama Rogers smiling at them from the couch.  It grew when she caught his eye, but he gave a sigh of relief when she only said, “All right boys, time to clean up and get into your pajamas.”  She stood up from the couch, kneeling down to brush a kiss first on top of Steve’s head and then Tony’s.
Tony looked absolutely adorable in his black jeans and oversized orange sweater that had a jack-o-lantern face on the front.  The matching orange eyeshadow plus black eyeliner made his already gorgeous eyes pop, and as Tony walked towards him, Steve noticed orange glitter sparkling in his curly hair.
“So, I made them with blueberries, well, because you are always eating blueberries, so I figured you’d appreciate them in pancakes.”
He could do it, he could hold it together. He was god damn Iron Man. Stark men are made of iron, right?
Tony wept, certain that Howard Stark was rolling in his grave and not giving two fucks about it.
“You going to enlighten me on what you know and how you know it?” Tony finally asked.
“What kind of teenager gets up at 7?” Tony asked incredulously.
Tony smirked at that.
The embarrassing article of “clothing” was removed and put in the rucksack he used to transport his dirty clothes from the Tower back home. He refused to let anyone but himself do his laundry, not even May. FRIDAY, the lovely and intelligent AI that she was, already catalogued Peter’s preferences of the water pressure and temperature of the shower; it came to life automatically, as most things did in Stark Tower. Peter slid himself beneath the spray and sighed, trying to relax and let the adrenaline and exhilaration of being a superhero bleed out of his nervous system.
Peter watched the city go by out of the windows, sipping his shake. Tony pretended to be engrossed in his phone the whole way home, just one thing on his mind.
Tony sat on the edge of the bed staring at it. An inconspicuous, completely outdated fossil of technology that was the one and only link to the person he didn’t know how to talk to anymore. Tony scoffed at it; a stupid AT&T flip phone. It was so Rogers. The man was so far removed from the world and instead of embracing Stark Technologies, he got with the times by getting a flip phone. Hell, the end table the phone was sitting on was worth more than that compact hunk of junk. Tony felt a rush of empathy for the components that made up the cell phone’s inner workings. They could’ve been put to better use.
Thank you all, for your kudos, comments, bookmarks, everything! I'm so pleased to have so much support for this story! I hope you all enjoy the next chapter!
Strange folded his arms across his chest and regarded Tony coolly.
Pepper let an unlady like sound.
Tony realized his hand was still stretched across the table and pulled it back. This was Peter. He was an innocent
“Ok, so I know I’m not going to be ready for any science-ing after all that. Why don’t we go drown our sorrows in greasy hamburgers and milkshakes? I’m just realizing how hungry pending world destruction and being de-aged makes me.”
“Holy shit!”
“Tony, I swear if you got drunk and this is another famous Stark hangover, I’m officially quitting. If you cannot take your health seriously and want to kill yourself, I can’t stand by and watch you do it,” Pepper threatened, although she couldn’t quite keep the shakiness out that Tony knew all too well was her holding back tears of anger.
“It’s too late anyhow,” Strange continued, albeit in a softer, more gentle tone. Tony’s eyes snapped to his and saw sympathy shining there.
“Yeah, I’ve known Morse since I was like six,” Peter admitted.
“I don’t make it,” Tony deadpans, understanding dawning in his mind.
Pepper was kneeling gracefully next to him, stroking his face, the corners of his eyes, and pushing back his hair that had fallen across his forehead.
“That Harry Potter knock off gave me a chicken head, didn’t he,” Tony muttered, vowing to figure out how to build a suit impervious to magic and punch Stephen Strange right in his perfectly groomed face.
They sat at a secluded vinyl booth in the back of the restaurant away from the windows. It wasn’t the most capacious design and Peter flushed hotly as his legs brushed against Tony’s beneath the table. He snatched up a menu and hid his flaming face behind it, trying to focus on reading the words. He chewed his bottom lip as he tried to contemplate why suddenly being within close proximity and even touched by Tony now affected him like this, when so many times before the same actions barely blipped on his radar beyond the awe he always held for Tony.
Even from the balcony, Bucky heard the buzzing of the cell phone that Steve kept tucked in the corner of his desk when they were in their quarters. Super soldier hearing. He could even pick up on how Steve’s heart and breathing increased as he crossed the room in two strides, grabbed the phone, and ghosted out onto the balcony to answer the call. Bucky knew who it was, as there was only one person the phone was ever meant to be connected to.
So although he looked bored, he was actually watching Rhodey’s face as FRIDAY played back how Tony had been made young again and the horror of what Dr. Strange foretold of. Tony was able to pick up the marvel at Strange’s magic (ugh), the narrowing of eyes at the start of the story and the minute swallowing when seeing himself a twisted wreck of metal and deceased. When the show was over FRIDAY silently took away the projection and Tony watched Rhodey pace over to the window, the slight whir of the gears in the braces the only sound in the room. He scrubbed at his face as he looked out at some of the best views of Manhattan before turning to his friend.
Tony was used to people looking like they wanted to carve his eyes out with a plastic spork, so Strange’s look of murder at his comment bounced off him as if he was wearing the Iron Man suit.
Tony slipped his arm free, his heart racing like he’d run a mile on the treadmill. He didn’t even have a comeback for that, just stuttered a “thanks for the chat,” and made like a banana and split. Vision just shook his fondly, watching as the billionaire bolted for the elevator and wondered how a genius could be so dense. Humans were truly interesting, mysterious creatures.
“Good boy,” praised Strange.
“If anyone can do this, it’s you. I have complete faith in you, Mr. Stark.”
Peter trailed off, not knowing what to say or if he should say anything at all, his eyes tracing over Tony’s face in shock and a bit of awe. A thin finger traced over Tony’s cheek before the kid caught himself and gently set Tony’s head on the floor, shrugging out of his hooded jacket he always wore and balled it up, tucking it beneath Tony’s head as a cushion.
“Osteomyelitis detected within 40% of the repaired bone structure, sir,” FRIDAY reported out clinically. “I advise contacting the surgeon’s office, would you like me to do so, sir?”
When he swallowed, he stabbed his fork in Peter’s direction.
Peter surveyed Tony’s face and it was impassive but he didn’t need his spider-senses to tell him whatever Tony was about to reveal wasn’t good stuff. If he was hiding it, from Miss Potts of all people, it definitely was bad business. Peter had come to be able to read Tony’s body language like a book after spending so much time at his side and knew Tony was the king of closing off all emotion, putting on and hiding behind the celebrity persona that Peter was slowly learning to hate.
Vision’s eyes found his over the rim of the mug and he contemplated Tony in that way of his, and Tony did his best not to fidget beneath the gaze.
“Get me to a mirror. Now.”
“Where to, boss?” asked FRIDAY.
He stepped into the elevator and leaned against the cool railing, fishing his Stark Phone out of the pocket of the black cotton jogger pants he wore to bed.
“You are a good man, Anthony Stark. If nothing else proves it to you, let your guidance of Peter prove it to you. He comes to see me often, and all he ever talks about is you. He wants so badly to make you proud.”
“I am going to make this short, as we are both men for which time is invaluable. Something wicked this way comes. We have, at best, 22 months to prepare for what is moving across the universe toward us. The state that the Avengers is in, and you, personally, Anthony, are not going to place humanity as we know it on the winning side.”
Steve lay dead at the monster’s feet, his shield shattered, the blue of his eyes muted in death but boring straight into Tony’s just as they had in Wanda’s vison. Something churned in Tony’s gut and he tore his eyes away from Steve’s; looking beyond the fallen Captain, he saw the War Machine armor was a mostly a mass of twisted and dented metal as if it were nothing more than crumpled up aluminum foil. Rhodey was dead and broken within. Bodies of deceased heroes littered the scene.
Tony simply snapped his glasses over his eyes and made the gesture that indicated ‘after you.’ Peter slid from the booth with his shake, and as he headed for the door Tony reached in his jeans pocket and pulled out a small wad of bills. He tossed it on the table without caring to count it and followed the kid, resolutely looking everywhere but at the kid as they climbed back into the car as Happy held the door open for them.
“Kid, mirror,” Tony snapped, and Peter was hauling up him with inhuman strength, shouldering Tony’s weight as he half dragged his boss to the car he was lying a few feet from. He helped Tony sit in the driver’s seat and Tony snapped down the visor, sucking in a harsh breath at his reflection.
“We have a major issue. We are going to need to arrange a rendezvous.”
“How did you like being 21?” Strange queried, and Tony’s eyebrows shot up.
He held up a hand to stop Peter’s tirade, which surely would carry on for at least another ten minutes if Tony let it.
Tony begins to pace, his mind racing through possibilities and not liking the answers he was coming up with. He was just as unlikely to survive a heart transplant as he was the surgery to remove infection.
However, whatever Strange was doing was rapidly draining his energy and Tony could feel his eyes growing heavy. It was almost like he’d been injected with a heavy sedative. He fought it although he knew he’d never win. Just before he drifted into unconsciousness he heard Strange’s voice echo through his mind.”
By the way, the anti-aging science Peter is working on is called microlipoinjection. We are pretending that for this fiction, it isn't a thing yet.
Peter was literally tickled pink, and they ate their breakfast, Tony declaring loudly to FRIDAY to note that Peter was now his most favorite and best Avenger when Peter passed him a whole thermos of freshly brewed coffee. Tony didn’t miss the way the kid’s eyes lit warm like the sunrise with every forkful Tony swallowed. That was something to think about.
“It isn’t your fault, Vis. Anyone on this planet could hold that stone, it wouldn’t make it their fault either. He’s just a power-hungry tyrant, as all villains are, but we are going to put in him in his place. Strange gave me this do-over for a reason, and I’m going to make sure this world ends up on the winning side.”
Tony nodded at one of the door guards and the door rolled open. Beyond it, everything had changed: gone were the grimy atmosphere and the drab gray palette. Now, blinking colorful garlands crisscrossed above their heads and all the shops were open. Under floating spheres of light, the massive crowd flowed through the intricate alleys of the station talking, clicking, and garbling. A screaming slug invited everybody to Vornard’s House of Mystery and children ran between everybody’s legs and tentacles and whatever. Trembling shape-shifting blobs offered the latest news from Xandar and a small hooded figure chanted about the adventures of the Knights of Rom. Flowers covered the floor and their thick sweet smell invaded the streets, almost covering the stench of sweat and food. It was chaos and it was life and Steve would never forget it.
Steve leaned down and their foreheads touched. The rest of the team was so far away they couldn’t see them and that made Steve brave.
“That’s a good point I hadn’t considered.”
Steve looked down at his sketchbook. Inside its pages, Steve had drawn the foggy streets of London during the Blitz and Peggy’s full lips and expressive eyes, the crowded New York of his childhood and Bucky sleeping with his rifle next to him. There were sketches of the Howling Commandos drinking, of Howard working on something… He closed it.
The more he heard, the scarier depending so much on one person got, especially when that person didn’t have any command experience. But no matter the risks, the lure of space, of exploring new worlds and having new adventures was too much to resist. He’d go with them and hope that Tony would be up to the task.
He put the file with his things and gave a half-hearted attempt at training, but gave up halfway through. He wanted to go back to his apartment and think about the first thing in the future that had almost excited him. While he rode the subway, he wondered if any of the other passengers felt as confused as he did.
“No… we’re… Just give me a second.”
“If you don’t hurry up, you’re going to die.” His voice broke at the end and he gripped Tony’s arm tighter. “Nat, how long until we hit the docks?”
the run. He didn’t enjoy being angry at Tony, but Tony’s entire being was so infuriating and hard to ignore. Like a small, prickling splinter in the arch of your foot that always made its presence known and was impossible to kick out of your mind.
He was the only SHIELD agent Steve knew and that had been baked into his backstory. His SHIELD job had been, supposedly, to be part of a STRIKE team — whatever that was — that reported directly to Fury and had been ‘wiped out’ during a mission. ‘Grant Stevens’ was the sole survivor, wanting out of SHIELD because of it. They had created fake names for the agents and faked reports and hired grieving widows. All Steve had to do was repeat his fake backstory until it seemed real.
Howard waved a hand. “I know. You picked Tony’s foolish little club over working for SHIELD. Can’t say I was expecting that.”
A shadow covered and Steve looked up to Nat. She had been even more graceful than him and had landed in a perfect crouch. Her hair wasn’t even tussled.
"Still, she must want to see me. Know I got out of the ice."
Its small fingers were pointing at Steve’s hands, so Steve showed the kid the sketch he was working on — the frazzled creature trembling from… stem to fin, Tony laughing in the background.
“Hey, I’m in better shape. You’re still hungover from Vegas.”
Tony put his palms up, bewildered. “Okay, people… why don’t we calm down and talk like adults? We have important things to…”
Steve shook his head. “I won’t apologize for that, but I should’ve asked if we had a doctor before. My timing was bad.”
“Clint, no, I’m not gonna… I don’t even know how to dance to this,” Laura kept protesting as Clint dragged her into the dance floor. They weren’t the only ones: the bar patrons were filling the dance floor and even the snake on the counter shook itself awake and skidded into the crowd. Steve stood frozen in place. Even galaxies away from home, he was the shy guy watching everybody else have fun.
He tried to organize the information he had learned already. It was 1994. The other man had returned in the early 50s and he had been told this was SHIELD’s headquarters. SHIELD was apparently where the other man and Peggy worked to keep the world safe. The war was over — it had been over for almost fifty years. They had won. He had too many questions, but most of all he was lonely.
Steve raised his hands. “Then you get what I mean.”
‘I’m not talking to myself. I’m talking to you.’
‘Then, can Hulk help me tonight in my room?’ Nat asked.
and tight hugs and
“Of course we care! We’ll get him back! But right now, we have to leave and follow the Kree ships.”
‘Good job.’
Tony laughed. “I know. But don’t you understand? When we get there, we’re… we’re going to see aliens. Real alive aliens.”
“I was right. He deserved it,” Bruce said and shrugged.
“What? That’d be… be completely inappropriate.”
‘Oh, I think it fits,’ the girl said and then pushed him forward. ‘Go say hi!’
“So Fury seems to like you,” she said instead of focusing on Tony again.
“What do you think the trick is with this one?” Tony said.
“Bastard couldn’t even have the decency to put me somewhere comfortable,” grumbled Tony, feeling the kinks in his back ache from lying on a hard surface all night.
Peter’s uncannily strong grip was on him, flipping him over with great care and Tony kept his eyes closed tight, the world spinning inside his head. When he opened his eyes and they finally focused, his vision was filled with Peter. His brown eyes were wide and filled with concern and he still cradled Tony’s head carefully in his hands.
“I’m Dr. Stephen Strange.”
Tony stood, hitching his jeans up over slightly protruding hip bones, eyeing the Sorcerer suspiciously. He was going to ignore the blow to his looks for now.
Rhodey strode across the room in his commander strut reminiscent of being Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force. Saving the world brought out that self righteous bravado that reminded Tony so much of Steve. That thought lanced through his heart. He met his best friend’s eyes, and was sure Rhodey saw right through his feigned nonchalance to his bleeding heart.
When Peter swung back through his window to his room in the Tower, it was well past 3 am. He said goodnight to Karen before pulling off the mask and placing it carefully on the comforter of the bed. For being surprising both light and tight, the suit peeled off quite easily, as if it had a non-stick Teflon coating on the inside. Knowing Tony, it probably did. He placed the suit delicately on a hanger in the closet and scurried across the room to the bathroom. Even 90 floors up, Peter was paranoid of someone seeing him naked save for a thong.
“Everything you say about me is true. I never could be what Howard wanted me to be, which was practically Steve, and for so long I bought the lie that my weapons were keeping people safe. I’m never going to have enough lifetimes for the Stark Foundation and Stark Industries to undo all the horrors the Stark name profited from. All the renewable clean energy, clean water wells in third world countries, the millions of dollars I pour into humanitarian causes, isn’t going to make up for, Vis.”
-------------------------------------------
Peter gasped, his innocent eyes going round with excitement, but what made his heart race faster, he wasn’t sure. It could’ve been from the amazing prototype schematic for what Tony was calling the Iron Spider Armor, or it could’ve been the fact that they were sitting so close together that their thighs were pressed firmly together, and Tony was so wrapped up in explaining the upgrades, he didn’t think twice about the non-existent distance between their bodies.
He let himself slump further down into the softness of the mountain of pillows spread at the head of the bed and contemplate life. In just one day his life totally tilted on its axis in a brand-new way and Tony never really did like surprises. What had happened to him in the last 24 hours somehow seemed more draining than having an absent and abusive father, years of being a playboy and drowning in alcoholism, Afghanistan, losing Pepper, his responsibilities as Tony Stark and Iron Man, and the fucking Accords and Siberia. He supposed if it was going to happen to anyone, it would happen to Tony Stark.
Tony looked at the image and fought down a wave of violent déjà vu with deep breaths. The Sorcerer showed him what looked like a giant purple alien, wearing gold colored armor, cackling while the world burned. In each hand he held the limp bodies of Tony’s friends- in his right hand was the large green body of the Hulk, whose face was smashed in beyond recognition. His left held Peter’s broken form by the back of his war tattered suit, his head hanging from an unnatural angle.
Tony rolled over in his huge California king sized bed, swathed so tightly in the white duvet that he looked like the cream filling of a Hostess Twinkie. He scrubbed a hand down his face and cracked open a whiskey eye, peering at the blacked-out penthouse windows where FRIDAY would surely have displayed the time upon detecting his waking up. Soft light lit the room at about 20%, FRIDAY following protocol to make the room lit just enough for Tony to see around the room. Tony groaned at the time, 3:30 in the morning. As tired as he should be, his new body decided that 5 hours of sleep was enough. Pepper would applaud him; 5 hours straight was probably close to record breaking when it came to Tony and his sleep habits.
“We can’t do it alone, just us three and Strange. Thor is in Asgard and Banner is missing. You know you will have to reach out to our missing comrades.”
“So, what, you are here to use your magic to help me build a time machine to restore me to my former glory?” Tony scoffed haughtily.
“Creature of habit, I guess,” Peter muttered, and that adorable blush was back. He nervously pushed at the stray curl that always flopped down on his forehead and Tony crossed his arms over his chest, feigning nonchalance and ignoring the whisper in his brain that made his fingers twitch, longing to sink his fingers in Peter’s soft looking hair.
He was doing that thing he did, where he talked a mile a minute and his tawny brown eyes grew wide and his cheeks flushed pink with embarrassment. Tony was a sucker for that; Peter was a ball of passionate energy and he threw himself wholeheartedly into every situation he got himself into. Just like Rogers, Tony thought to himself before he pushed the thought away hurriedly.
“You still got me, Mr. Stark. I-I know it isn’t much, certainly not the same as having everyone around, but I really like being here with you every opportunity I get.”
“It’s not exactly early, Mr. Stark. It’s already 9:30 and I’ve been up since 7.”
“I’m 21, still older than you and still your boss Parker, so if you make any baby face jokes, you’re fired.”
“Hey, kid, you gonna eat that?”
Someone was jostling him. The movement made him nauseous. Why was his voice so fucking loud? Fingers found his pulse point on his neck. Tony didn’t know how steady the pulse was, but he knew he was alive, although he didn’t really want to be if it meant dealing with this pain. He pushed into the cool fingers, they felt remarkable on his feverish skin.
“Tony?” Steve had questioned, and Tony was still caught up in those moments that could have been when he answered. In the blink of an eye though, the compressing feelings of betrayal and anguish crashed over him like a tidal wave. Tony felt like he couldn’t breathe.
“He cares about you Anthony. Don’t shove him aside just because he’s younger than you.”
“You are going to want to drink a lot of water after this,” he advised, do that weird thing he did with his hands.
The waitress came over with Styrofoam cups, pouring the rest of their shakes in the to-go cups. Tony went up to pay the bill, and Peter pulled his wallet out and placed a ten on the table. When Tony came back, he arched a brow.
A holographic screen popped up in front of Vision, and FRIDAY let it run.
Peter sucked his bottom lip in between his teeth and braced his left hand against the condensated travertine of the shower, mindful of his super-strength somewhere in the back of his mind as he fucked into the tightness of his hand. He didn’t want to break anything, it would be embarrassing to have to tell Mr. Stark he’d cracked the tiles. What was worse would be that Mr. Stark would be interested in how they’d come to be broken in the first place. Embarrassment and arousal colored Peter’s cheeks at the thought of explaining himself to Tony.
Tony looked at Vision sharply, trying to dismantle what those words meant. Vision couldn’t possibly know about this weird, perverse train of thought Tony had been on surrounding Peter. The kid needed him to be a mentor. He didn’t need Tony trying to get in his pants…his delectably tight, ass hugging pants (TONY NO!). Being 21 again was fucking awesome but Peter still wasn’t the age of consent; the gap was still wide enough that Tony could go to jail in the state of New York.
“Listen to me, Parker. What you saw there, I swear to you I am not going to let that happen. Whatever reality I failed in before, it’s not going to happen now. I know I haven’t been the ideal mentor. I’m putting more on you than I have any right to, but right now you and Vision are all I have. We are going to stop that monster, and I will not let him destroy you, or the world. Understood?”
Tony arched a brow.
“That was the year I became CEO of Stark Industries. It was a good a year…I think. There were a lot of parties. I was often…moderately functional. Lots of women…yeah, it was a good year.”
The best they could come up with for his now roguishly youthful face was he took an extended vacation and while on it, decided that staring 50 in the face was midlife crisis material and underwent an extensive plastic surgery that restored him to his former glory. It was Peter’s idea that said he decided to try an experimental trial of injecting his fat into the cells of his face that had enhanced collagen to revitalize the skin after the surgery.*
“Ah-ah. Before you sully your taste buds with chocolate, real original, by the way, you need to taste this beauty,” Tony commanded, dipping his silver long handled spoon down into his frosty treat and producing a heaping helping for Peter, extending it out to him.
“You made me breakfast.”
The pain between the words was sharp, no matter how gently delivered in his soothing voice. Tony thought of the budding closeness between Vision and Wanda, how Rhodey had been accidently injured in Vision’s distraction by the fallen witch. It dug at him, pulling open barely healed scabs of betrayal and anger that even the coffee wasn’t going to fix.
“FRIDAY, what’s his condition? Vitals report,” demanded a female voice.
“It won’t bite you,” FRIDAY snarked after he’d been sitting there for sometime, just trying to figure out how he was going to do this. He snatched it up, flipped it open with an eye roll at the absurdity of the action and hit the call button before he could chicken out of his big boy pants.
“I’ll have whatever is your favorite.”
Tony arched a brow with a smirk.
Tony spotted the waitress headed their way, laden with a larger tray of food.
This is set in the same college AU as the first three chapters!  ^-^
Now it was Tony’s turn to look sheepish, using his hold on Steve to walk them into the house.  He released Steve to turn back and close the door, locking it firmly.  “I was reading a scary book, and apparently without my warm, blond teddy bear beside me, I got a little worked up,” Tony admitted, unable to meet Steve’s eyes.
Tony continued walking around the couch, and he had to clap a hand to his mouth to stifle his laugh.  His big beefy boyfriend was decked head to toe in a green dinosaur onesie, complete with slippers that looked like dinosaur claws.  Meeting Steve’s eyes, Tony managed to ask around his laughter, “Where did this come from?”
There was nothing more that Tony loved than being surrounded by his caring Alpha and their darling child.
Be prepared for some mega fluff y'all, I didn't set out with this idea in mind for this prompt but I'm so so happy with how it turned out!  XD
Day 3/31 of Spooktacular Halloween: Movie.  Direct continuation of chapter 2, same college verse.  ^-^
With that, Steve and Tony seemed to be re-energized.  Steve released his mom to grab Tony’s hand, and the two of them started skipping back where they came from.  Maria laughed softly.  “I don’t envy you having to get them into bed tonight.”
,” Steve said, pushing Tony down on the couch and kneeling closer to him to yell, “A plush of the sandworm from Beetlejuice!  You
Steve let Tony give him a sip of coffee, humming appreciatively at the sweet taste.  He waited until Tony put his mug down before pulling him close.  Steve brushed a kiss on his forehead, nose before finally covering those pouting lips with his own.  Allowing himself to savor the soft, plush lips, Steve kept kissing Tony until the shorter man had to break away for a breath.
Tony took a deep breath, hugging Steve closer, before breathing out, “Sounds wonderful.”
neighborhood honey.”
for relief across their bond, probably reacting to Steve’s thoughts over it too.  “All right sweetheart, I’ll give you what you want.”
“Can we go home?”  Steve asked, walking forward to hug his mom, stifling his own yawn into her stomach.  A second later, he seemed much more alert, and popped his head up to ask, “But Tony can still come over for a sleepover, right Ma?”
“Sounds perfect,” Tony said, leaning down at the same time Steve lifted himself up again to meet his lips in a gentle kiss.
Tony moved closer to Steve, fingers gripping tight to the arm that was curled around his waist.  He felt a chill go up his spine despite the thick blanket covering their legs, but couldn’t tear his eyes away from the TV.  Tony watched as the mother walked through the house, blindfolded and playing a hide-and-go-seek game with her daughter.  She clapped a couple times, and when her daughter clapped back, the mom went towards the sound.
Apparently Margaret hadn’t noticed, as she dropped back down to sit beside Tony.  She pulled the blanket tighter around herself, and Tony smiled at her content humming.  A quick peek back down revealed Steve’s eyes were closed again, so Tony gently rubbed Steve’s back as the rain continued to fall.
Tony looked down at his lap where Steve rested his head, sighing in relief when he didn’t wake up from the sudden noise.  A slight breeze rustled the blond hair, and Tony tucked Steve’s blanket up further around those big shoulders before he could get chilled.  Tony was sitting on his own blanket, the top draped over his shoulders and the bottom half tucked around his legs.  He slowly combed his fingers through his Alpha’s hair, taking in the long lashes that he’d counted numerous times before, and the soft pink lips that he loved to kiss.
By the time Tony came back with the bowl of popcorn and a package of redvines, Steve had the movie queued up and their couch cushions rearranged so that they could lie back but still eat comfortably.  Tony readily cuddled back up under the blanket, placing the bowls in their laps and settling down for the classic, glad to have a loving boyfriend like Steve.
!”  A fresh peal of laughter came out of her as Steve gasped in mock-offense, and renewed his tickle attack.  “Ah Daddy no!  Please!”  When he didn’t let up, she turned those blue blue eyes to Tony, saying, “Mama help!”
Tony unconsciously held his breath, completely transfixed by the book, and he burrowed further into his blankets.  His eyes swept across the page, but something niggled at the back of his mind and he lifted his head to try and figure it out.  There - a soft scratching noise came from somewhere in the hallway, but before Tony could decide whether he wanted to get up or not, it stopped.  Shrugging, Tony went back to the book.
I need you.
Maria was brought back to the present as Tony and Steve approached them, her son trying to hide a large yawn.  “Did you two get a lot of candy?”  She asked, smiling at their enthusiastic nods.  “Ready to go home, or do you want to go another block?”
Steve made to pull out of Tony, but the sub whined, hooking his legs around Steve’s waist to keep him close.  Steve chuckled, settling back down in a way so he wouldn’t squish Tony but still give him the weight and contact he wanted, and asked softly, “Want to stay here a little longer?”  When Tony nodded, he said easily, “No problem, sweetheart.”
Steve tilted his head.  “I can live with that.”  He leaned down further to brush kisses on Tony’s cheeks.  “How about a movie now?  Something spooky to match the season?”
a mature adult after all.  But Steve enjoyed being able to bring his sub a little bit of peace in between his busy schedule, and Tony
When he came back to himself, Steve could feel soft fingers brushing up and down his sides, the body beneath him breathing deep and easy.  He kissed Tony’s neck gently, then slowly uncurled himself from around the other man, watching his expression to make sure everything was fine.  Tony only gazed back at him, eyes showing he was still slightly under, but warm feelings of content flowed through their bond.
“Yeah, I like those!  Here, you can have my Reese’s Pieces, I don’t like peanut butter candy,” Tony said, gathering the candies and placing them beside Steve’s pile.  As Steve did the same, Tony found his gaze traveling from the candy to his friend’s face.  A warm feeling went through him, one that was slowly becoming more familiar whenever he saw his friend.  He knew he liked to spend time with Steve, and that he always had fun with him.  But recently, he’d started thinking about how cute Steve was too, how nice his smile was and the warm and fuzzy feeling Tony got when Steve smiled at him specifically.  It was a new feeling and kind of scary, but Tony also got the feeling sometimes that Steve felt the same way.
Steve came into the living room first, asking, “Can we watch some cartoons, Ma?”  He grinned when she nodded, running over to place a kiss on her cheek before leaping onto the couch.  He had just stopped on some Looney Tunes when Tony came padding out, hair all messy from being towel dried and Steve couldn’t help but think,
The scritch-scratch of Steve’s pencils and brushes against the canvas were pure bliss to Tony’s ears, helping Tony stay down where his Dom wanted him.  Tony could feel Steve’s gaze on him, and his inner sub preened at the attention as Steve painted him.  He floated gently, feeling almost weightless, yet remaining grounded enough through the padded cuffs keeping his wrists together.  They were connected to a matching set around his ankles, and Tony knew his back and thighs would be delightfully sore later on from keeping this pose.
“Hello?”  He called towards the only other room in their place, adding, “Are you sure we’ll remember that it’s Halloween this month?”
A few steps behind them, Maria Carbonell and Sarah Rogers watched as their sons joyfully recited the traditional phrase, their little faces lighting up when they received more treats.  “They’re going to completely knock out tonight,” Maria whispered to her friend, shaking her head in amusement as they raced away towards the next house.
As he walked out of the bedroom, Tony heard the TV on from their living room and called out, “So what are we watch-”  He froze just around the corner, taking in his boyfriend sitting on the couch.  Or rather, the yellow felt dinosaur spikes peeking above the couch cushions.
“So we’re both dorks, is what you’re saying?”  Tony asked once he could.
Steve paused the movie immediately, then leaned his head against Tony’s temple, brushing a kiss there a second later.  “Of course sweetheart.  Let’s put on Hocus Pocus, I know you love to sing along with Bette Midler.”
Tony’s cries and moans being pushed out of him with each thrust forward went straight to Steve’s cock, driving him to go faster and harder until Tony was barely able to hang on to Steve anymore.  “
“This is boring.”  Tony bit back a grin, feeling Steve smile against his thigh as their daughter continued, “Can I have some chocolate milk?”
Sarah smiled down at him, running her fingers through his gelled back hair and loosening it up a bit.  “Yes of course, darling.  Maria has his stuff in the car, so we can go straight home.”
about Halloween...but maybe he could do without the scary movies.
“Wow, you got a lot!”  Steve said, peeking over as he poured his own collection of candy onto the rug too.  There were a few moments of silence, broken only by the clicking of Mama Rogers’ camera and the crinkling of candy wrappers being moved around.  “Hey Tony, do you want my 3 Musketeers bars?  I don’t really like the texture,” Steve said, crinkling his nose and smiling when the action made Tony giggle.
It had been a long week for both of them, and when Tony had come to him last night, brown eyes rimmed with red and so, so tired, Steve had immediately started planning this scene.  Tony put so much time into each of his responsibilities for the Avengers, at SHIELD, and for Stark Industries, and it was very easy for him to forget about himself along the way.  Not that Tony wasn’t capable of taking care of himself, he
Steve stood up, wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulders, and after muttering a quick, “Lift up a bit for me darling,” hooked his other arm underneath Tony’s thighs.  In one smooth movement, Steve lifted Tony and carried him out of the room and across the hall to their bedroom.  He laid Tony down at the top of the bed, mindful of his arms and legs that were still hooked together, holding his sub open and giving him a wonderful view of his dripping cock and the puckered entrance beneath.
The day he met Steve, Maria had never seen him more animated and excited after a school day.  He had always enjoyed learning, and he made a few friends, but that day there was a glow around him that made Maria’s heart fill with warmth.  Tony had talked her ear off as they made dinner that evening, telling her about this little blond boy named Steve who was “the bravest boy I ever met Mama!”  While Maria had been distraught to find out Tony had been bullied, she was glad that apparently Tony had acquired a knight in shining armor.
