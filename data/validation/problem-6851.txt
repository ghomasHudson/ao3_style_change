So she skips her library, and email session. She calls herself with breath techniques, and just waltz’s down to the cafeteria by herself. And sure enough, her computer is back in her room when she gets back. She’s not naive enough to think she just missed it when she first looked, or that she scared Sasha into giving it back. She knows they got whatever that wanted off it and now she’ll just wait for the other shoe to drop.
“What about the Malibu office? I heard that one’s pretty nice.” Clint mentioned the day after she moved in. Her plan of dicouraging inter floor movement had not worked.
The woman stands up rather quickly, and finally, he has a clear look at her face. Even though it’s a little bloodied, it clicks.
It’d been satisfying to try on Pointe shoes first. The satisfaction wore off when she tried to use them. Her toes bled most nights, she had to clean the shoes herself.
“It’s the bag with all the supplies and your written brief, it’ll be on the chopper.” She glances at her watch, “Speaking of which, we need to leave.”
“So...Antoinette, would you like to explain your actions these past few months.” Howard finally pointed out the elephant in the room bluntly,
The candidates of Toni's class are assigned a small mission, the three lowest girls in the class are given rifles, while Toni and Tania are told to run. Everyone wants Toni dead, and she's cornered in a room with one of the girls, when they hear gunfire from outside. They investigate and Mila's been shot, Eva is distraught, and Toni takes advantage, forcing her to walk to the exit at gunpoint and ending the mission. Because Toni 'won' the mission, she's awarded a real life assignment. The object is to plant small bugs in the hotel room of a Ukrainian man, and she does. However he arrives back to the hotel early, and forces her to preform oral sex. A mysterious agent appears, and injects him with an anesthetic, before leading her out of the hotel. She realizes the agent was the infamous Black Widow. She rides home and thinks the universe is punishing her for all her actions in the Red Room, but has her icy exterior back in place by the time she arrives at the mansion.
“It wasn’t an easy job. Lots of problems came up. Like when bratty little girls insisted on coming on a business trip with her parents. We originally just added you to the hit list, when I had a bright idea. My good friend ran a school for bratty little girls with no parents.”
“I met her, she was really nice, she and Father went somewhere after but I had to go home and Maria- I mean my mom had a migraine.”
She doesn’t remember ever going to the dentist, but she knows what they are. How strange it is having so much knowledge yet no experiences.
“Let’s start with the positions.” She went the five most basic positions, and had every girl go through them twenty times each before she was satisfied, then they all did them in unison another dozen times till they got that right.
“All sorts.” She says, and starts unstrapping the restraints on her arms, why are there restraints on her arms? Before she can ask, Madame says, “You’ll learn world history, science, math, literature, and of course the feminine tricks, seduction and hand to hand combat.”
Furiously, certainly without thinking it through, Toni stormed down the hallway to confront Sasha and the other girls involved. The door was unlocked, due to the policy, and she shoved it open.
“She grabbed me by the elbow.” Toni said, Madame paused, waiting for an elaboration but Toni offered none.
Most strikes landed squarely on her cheek, sometimes she hit her nose, other times she outright missed and punched her neck. It was only a few minutes till Svetlana stopped crying out, a few more till she stopped moving.
Toni sighs, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have- I always do this. Just don’t tell my father, please? I didn’t mean to assume anything, but you’re so-so pretty, and I-”
Toni is surprised, she expected questions about when, where, maybe about Maia or their relationship. She doesn’t see why this matters.
Antonia gets up from the chair and looks around the otherwise deserted room, it seems to go on forever with the only exit right behind Madame.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea.” Steve says, “We’re doing so good in our little bubble. Aren’t we?”
“No.” Toni sighed, Natasha wasn’t going to let her infiltrate the meeting unless she trusted her, which meant Toni was going to have to trust Natasha first. “He killed my parents two weeks later.”
Doing her best apparently meant doing her worst, and maybe she got a little out of control. Fucking a new guy or girl every other day, hitting crack three ways to sunday isn’t known to be the best grieving process but who’s really to say it’s bad.
“As you all know eliminations are a crucial part of our program. Weeding out the weak and unloyal is what makes for the best possible assets.”
She didn’t have to worry about being stir crazy for much longer, because as seven months set in she didn’t want to leave her bed, let alone her apartment. She watched documentaries, of many different varieties, historical, scientific, and some specifically about pregnancy.
The flawless soldier. What Toni could never be despite how hard she tried. She was broken. But maybe being broken made her strong.
She fell asleep with her mind set to being sober, her bed was soft and Rhodey fell asleep next to her.
She stays awake as long as she can, but even in the awkward position she’s in, she eventually gives in to exhaustion. The van was eerie and uncomfortable, the floor was unfinished and the wall was cold. She was shaken awake by a silent man, and she could feels the creases on her face from leaning against the wall.
“Yes Steve. I read them before I showed them to you.” She replied, she’d read them six time, annotated it three times, reorganized it once, and burned it twice. Because she knew what this would do to them.
“She was afraid they’d take her off.” Nika says, “Nothing's worse than not being on Pointe she says.” She glances at her feet a second, “Maybe it’s for the best I’ve been thrown out of her group.”
“You must’ve suffered a head injury in your escape. Don’t fret darling, the Red Room will help you grow so you’ll never hurt again.”
Silently the guards and Instructors leave them once they’ve be subdued, and they sit alone in silence.
“That’s if he even buys it for a second! They only found him a few hours ago, how accurate it you’re little set? How well have you researched this?”
She looks to the remaining eleven girls, before her eyes settle on Lara Vasilla. “Vasilla. Come here.”
“It’s not like you don’t punch back Sobol.” Nika says, starting to hit again, this time slower and more focused, “And you got here in year eleven.”
“And here I am.” She shrugged, “He wasn’t supposed to return for hours, I would’ve come sooner if I’d known...”
“It’s not the typical kind. No swing set.” She smiled, “We own forty acres, half of which is dense forest, just outside the mansion. There is an electric fence surrounding it. ”
The return home is quiet and no one acknowledges Lucie Steele, but they traded emails and Lucie’s parents are mad. Apparently Howard Stark called them and told them their daughter turned his daughter into a dyke.
“You cunt.” Toni murmurs, she pauses a moment, allowing for the adrenaline to wear off, if she’d been shot but hadn’t noticed.
Steve blinked, the apartment was almost completely dark, and the music quietly continued in the background, “I didn’t know you were married.”
She pushes up and over the wall and both the soldier and Steve watch silently for a second. Her feet are planted on the highway and she sighs, “Really? A highway? Could you be more overdramatic?”
She turns back to the folders and flips open the first one. A familiar girl’s picture is paper clipped neatly to the front, she knows it’s her. Part of the writing is in Russian, which she seems to understand.
Tania nodded, “I was on a street corner, begging. Told me she’d give me a meal and a bed for the night and I woke up just outside the mansion.”
“Well you’d have better luck talking up someone else,” she says, “Thanks for the drink though.” She hops off the stool and grabs her bag.
The doctor looked down at his shoes, and said nothing. Rhodey walked slowly towards the bed she laid on, and touched her shoulder, “Toni.” She said nothing, finally letting her face crumble. The tears finally slide down her far as she turned to Rhodey and pulled him in for a hug. She still couldn’t sit up so he knelt down beside her and laid his head of her arms as she sobbed with him silently.
She met Lucie on the walk to school everyday. It was a nice tradition they started in private school together as a survival tactic, now turned cutesy relationship thing.
“Which is exactly why you won’t be involved. We’re trying to capture not kill, you’re too unpredictable. The mission is-”
She ducked as Tania surged, her, throwing her body at her legs and knocking her off balance for just a moment. But it was enough.
Oh right, they were dating. They finally cracked after two weeks of school together, never talking about the kiss, or the consequences of the kiss. It was Toni who started it, blowing up a little, exclaiming she really liked Lucie and no one would probably even care if they dated.
“It didn’t really come up,” She pauses wiping a runaway tear, “till now. She’s sick. She’s in New York. I think I have to give a blood transfer or something.”
Her face turned red, maybe with anger maybe embarrassment. She shot up like a firecracker and charged Toni again. This time it was too much, she was a steam engine and Toni was the damsel tied to the tracks. If Zma hadn’t stepped in and caught Tania inches from Toni, she would’ve been knocked to the ground, and probably pummeled.
“We’ve researched it plenty Ms. Stark. You can watch the feed of him waking up, and then one of our agents debriefing him and then, and only then will you get to talk to him. But you’re going to have to leave after.”
“Don’t you even fucking shut up?” Antoinette said, not quietly at all, inciting a gasp from the surrounding kids, shocking Holly and her friend into silence, but not for long, “Listen you little-” Holly started, and Antoinette, without realizing it and later regretting it deeply, because it wasn’t a good choice and is never the answer, punched Holly right in the nose.
Her train of thought was interrupted by the realization that her new laptop was not in the room. It wasn’t a very large room, and Toni knew she hadn’t misplaced it, it’d been a gift from her father, well partially. He’d given her the resources to build a computer and the screen schematics, but she built it, and gave him back hair designs. The new Stark Computers looked eerily similar to her own, but she didn’t particularly care. It wasn’t anywhere near Willa’s stuff, she never touched Willa’s bed or desk. Suddenly she remembered Willa’s rush to get out of the room, and refusal to let Toni touch any of her bags, one of which was so big it could hold the clunky laptop. She’d been running down the hall, right towards Sasha’s room.
Katya crawls back, “No! Please no!” She cries as the guards unceremoniously take both her arms, and dragged her towards the door.
She didn’t remember anything. A common one, Toni had to announce this weekly, sometimes daily, to her classmates and Instructors.
She killed people, little girls, so that they wouldn’t kill her. How much better was she than the soldier after all. Maybe he’d had a metaphorical gun to his head the entire time too.
Howard no longer entertains at his own house, since people were starting to notice, but instead hosts a weekly poker night where rich men gamble away their pocket money.
This wasn’t a logical scenario, because Father and Mother were married, and marriage bonds you only to kiss your husband or wife. Antoinette knew this because Francesca told her, so why was Francesca breaking her own rule?
Someone must’ve tipped off Coulson or Fury or someone that she was dieing, but whoever is was she’s pissed and greatful. It isn’t so easy to hate Howard when he technically saved her life, and because of that she can’t hate Rogers so much.
But Mr. Steele on the other hand, didn’t not approve of it. Going so far as to call up Howard and tell him his lesbian daughter was corrupting the good Steele family name, Howard replied that Mr. Steele was homophobic, and he didn’t chose who his daughter dated, and for any of that to be true, the Steele family would have to have a good name to begin with.
She looked up at him, ‘This is for Captain America. Long live the revolution, let the Accords die!’ rang in her head.
Despite this unlikely common ground between them, neither was willing to talk to the other for more than a few minutes, after years of mutual dislike.
Toni doesn’t even notice she’s screaming till her arm slips and she falls off the bed. The slick floor makes it hard for her to push herself back up to the bed, so she lies there a moment.
When she gets to the end of the strands she grasps it suddenly and pulls Eva’s whole head downwards, “No one in this room has any authority to tell me how to run my program.” She smirks as Eva as she stands up straight again, “Especially the fool who lost the only advantage she ever had.”
Toni paused, she’d never thought in depth about the elimination process, ever since Nika’s death all she’d been focused on was surviving.
“You haven’t had a proper chug in weeks, it’s more likely your three day nap after that party was your withdrawal.”
Toni finally let her fear and shock show on her face, “What? But there were twelve of us? You can’t kill eleven innocent girls!”
She stood there a moment silently, before he said, “I lost Peggy! The last person left in my life. You don’t know what that’s like.”
“Everyday. I loved her, I loved Francesa like I love Jarvis. I never told anyone but Maria knows, she was there.”
He begrudgingly raises his hands and starts to kneel, and lets himself be taken into the transport van.
He was already poisoning himself. He carried a pack of thick, expensive cigars wherever he went, and a smaller bunch of cigarettes for emergencies.
“I’ll be right back in Mama, I just need some air.” Toni hears, and she takes a sharp right towards the voice. She finds Manya overlooking a beautiful garden through a window,
At night they cuff her hands to the wiry metal headboard, just like all the other girls. After a few weeks of this, she has an angry red band around her wrist just like everyone else.
-The target in chapter 5 was a person involved in the very small Ukrainian campaign in the early 2000s. I didn’t know much about the events so I borrowed a name from a much smaller figure rather than a key player. The story greatly exaggerates the events and involves Russia, while there is no evidence that Russia was involved. It’s more than someone on another side rented their highly trained agents to spy rather than the government actually getting involved though.
“I said,” She looked up and got off of Katya, “She is not lost. She’s right here and she’s done nothing wrong.”
Her successful mission was a show of good faith. Lucifer living up to her name. Evil, cruel, and unbothered by moral tethers was a good reputation for an asset. But those who knew her code name didn’t know she spent nights in her bed sobbing, or lying on her kitchen floor silently staring at the ceiling.
“No,” She manages to raspily say, “Save my baby.” Her vocal cords burn, she can’t cough, her mouth is so weak. They must have already started the anesthesia.
Suddenly all her training left her, her voice was small and in the back of her throat, the beating of her heart seemed to drone on in her ears. “That’s alright sir, I have a lot of rooms to clean.”
“Maia Peterson has just been admitted at hospital in New York. Her parents came her because her biological mother lives her, and you’re listed as such. Can you get to New York City Children’s Hospital as quickly as possible?”
The table was clear, and they still sat there, for minutes before Mother stood up and started walking towards her room, Antoinette followed.
“Well that explains it.” another girl sitting farther away remarked under her breath, but Annie's come a long way since punching Holly in the face, she just ignored the girl. But apparently she wasn’t trying to ignored because after other girls asked more question, she butted it, “So why’d you go anyways? You weren’t even invited.”
Tania starts to reply when another voice chimes in, “Can you two quit flirting or get a room?” they both pauses awkwardly, “Some of us are trying to sleep.”
It lands feet in front of her and the pilot waves her on board. Silently they take off again, towards the city.
The first few missions were child’s play compared to what she’d done for the Red Room. A hostage rescue, and recovery of items. All just half an hour from her flat.
Been told there are some continuity issues, and they're right. I'll reedit later, but I was honestly just trying to get all chapters out. If you want more, I'm seeing Endgame tonight so I'll probably write a story around that once I've healed emotionally. Peace.
She nodded, “Yeah, we are, but I’ve done secret relationships before, it’s all hot and heavy till it isn’t. This kind of thing is easy to walk away from and-” she stops short. She doesn’t want him to walk away. She doesn’t think she’d survive it.
“Revenge is a powerful motivator, they’d go after you, and your family, after being humiliated like that. Besides, if they tried to do it to us, they would’ve done it again.”
“Find me her next of kin.” He said, and once again she heard a door open and close, this time she could see a spot of light near the sound. Her vision was coming back.
“I know you’ve lost a lot. I can see that now.” He said, “But you’ve still got stuff left. The team, Iron Maiden, me.”
Toni smiled sadly, “I worked in your dad’s political office. I got in the way of some revolutionaries while they were pillaging, during the coup.”
She didn’t dare turn around to the figure behind her, deep down she knew not to ask for help. She could, however, see his shadow from the street lights surrounding them. It was slow and decided, bulky and intimidating. He first walked to the front passenger seat, and tore off the door. She watched in horror as he wrapped his hand around her mother's neck, and slowly tightened his grip before pressing her against the headrest and the back of the chair, raising her by her neck till she stopped squirming and deflated against his hand.
“But I can sure as hell try.” She said, and she spun on her heel, dropping the tray in the trash. But Eva lurched towards her, and dragged her back by her elbow.
After the informal debriefing, Fury took her outside of the hospital room Steve was recovering from his fall in, “You have a place at SHIELD if you want it. You’re skilled, well trained. You’d make a great agent.”
Toni walked up at a reluctant pace and Zma waved her hand impatiently. She positioned Toni in front of the girls, “There are three things you want the audience to focus on during a dance,” she gestured to her face, her fingers tracing the sharp bone of Toni’s jaw, “the face,” she began, then she moved down the her hips and set both hands lightly on top her her pelvic bones, “The end of your torso,” and finally she gestured down to her neatly tied ballet flats, “And of course the feet.”
Uniforms? Toni thought to herself, the girls around her exchanged glances but no one dared to question, they filed into through the door one by one till all the girls stood in a line in the studio.
In her shock she doesn’t even notice the next few texts, alerting her Coulson has received all the recovered items, and people, and is sending them to the proper places for restoration and rehabilitation. Basically that SHIELD is taking over her operation.
-October 7th, national revenge day, a Libian holiday. Toni really tries to get revenge this chapter. Very revengish.
The words shock Annie, she considered her own words before speaking, “Because I’m rich? Because I went to the Oscars?”
“I ditched my bong, but my parents meet and greet went south. I’m getting in my car, just give me an address and details.”
The day is worse than the others for whatever reason. Only one other girl in the class has been given a real life mission, and from what she could tell, Eva’s mission didn’t go well.
She bypassed the rest of security, Coulson must be pretty high ranking she figured, and was led to a dark room with whole screen wall projecting a feed of Captain Rogers. Some doctors were operating on him, operating being an exaggeration because they were mostly doing a mild checkover of him and treating his minor hypothermia.
Toni’s hand rested on her back, when Zma snatched them, “They should never think of your hands, or what’s in them for that matter.” She tapped Toni on the back as if to say ‘you’re done now.’
Nika looks smaller in the dark hallway, more lost. Her eyes are as round as saucers when she sees Toni.
“Antoinette. Let’s go.” He seemed to have a special drug in the bathroom that cures hangovers and drunkenness in minutes, but Toni couldn’t even start thinking about that.
Toni knew for a fact she was much better at British accents, which she had no doubt Kozlov knew too.
Her gut sinks. They still don’t know. Elimination means exactly what it sounds like. One of them won’t leave this room alive. Just like Madame said, she doesn’t let candidates escape.
But Maria had other ideas, “We’ll be sending you back to the higher education program next year of course.”
Bruce chuckled, “Alright Toni. And I know it’s not completely your fault, but lay off Cap. I think you guys would really like each other if you gave each other a chance.”
“Well actually-” Obidiah turned to the makeshift shooting range where Toni tested it out earlier, and it shot perfectly, silences and accurate.
She was already waking up late, and so changing her clothes made her unmistakably late for roll call, her tight braids were still damp.
All the displays of ruthlessness and strength bought her no good will with Eva, who now rallied younger girls against them both.
They reached the long corridor, and Father’s door was opened slightly, but Mother ignored this, so Antoinette did too. Mother walked into her room and went to close the door when she noticed Antoinette standing there.
“How clever.” She says, “But there’s a major flaw in your plan. I don’t allow candidates to escape.”
And just like that, Party Toni was loose again, this time with a vengeance. She didn’t think about a goddamn thing.
“Well I’m already out for the night but Reed Richards son is having his 18th right now, it’s only just started but it’s at the mansion?”
Carly hit Jason again but her grin stuck too, and Annie couldn’t hear much of what they were saying anymore.
New York City was probably a mistake. Known for her wild party attitude, she got invites the second she stepped foot inside the city.
She saw what would happen next, they’d drag her and Petra into the huge room. Maybe this time they’d take more time, and make Petra suffer. They’d certainly make Toni watch.
Toni found that the soldier, Barnes, getting away didn’t affect her very much. Steve and Fury hesitantly told her, as if expecting her to bolt the second she could to hunt him down. She assured them that she wasn’t planning on murdering anyone in the near future.
She’d had a leg up since they started nearly two years ago, literally and metaphorically. Not only her daily workouts that built up muscle tone, but also her small figure and petitie look. She was one of the girls in her class who actually looked like a ballerina.
It was Rhodey who picked her up off the floor a while later, in fact nearly two years later on December sixteenth, in a week it’d be an annaversary of her one night stand and conceiving. Then in a few monthes the next birthday of her child.
“Ok let's go through them. If you have a serious illness, you’d have other symptoms like eye or skin discolorations chest or stomach pain, bloody shit.” Tera listed
So she arrives at the school along with everyone else, and due to the weird look of ‘tweens’ no one seems to notice she’s nearly three years younger than everybody else. She hasn’t been moved up a grade since she started third grade at age six and now she’s nine, and starting sixth grade.
TMZ noticed their relationship, and honestly it’s about time. They weren’t even being subtle about it. So now between ‘look how far she’s come’ Toni also see’s ‘spiraling after girlfriend leaves’ stories on the front cover of teeny magazines.
That particular evening, Howard sat on his couch while two women in impressively high heels acted out some sort of story. Their dresses covered their thighs, but were sheer, showing off an intricately laid set of lingerie that gave Toni a headache when she thought of attempting to put it on.
“I don’t want a slut for a mother.” She said, breaking Francesca and her own heart with one sentence. Maria’s head shifted upward with approval, she’d done the right thing in her book, and she spun on her heel considering Francesca secure, now no one in the house wanted her here. Annie copied her actions, turning towards her bedroom and wishing Francesca’s sobs would fade away quicker. She knew no matter what she said, Francesca would be leaving. She couldn’t afford to be taken down with her. But she’d loved her, with her whole heart and she mourned the death of their friendship.
Brynn didn’t seem made exactly, just a little surprised but firm that she’d tolerate no more dead parents jokes.
“Oh my god.” Toni whipped her head around to see Sasha standing in their doorway, “You two fucking freaks. I’m telling!”
The gunshot cuts her off. It rings throughout the hall. Lara’s body slumps over itself, and a spray of blood covers Svetlana, and a few girls close to her.
She stood up suddenly, and only adressesing Maria said, “I don’t care about our differences, I think you only stuck around for me and I can’t thank you enough for that, but I’m nearly an adult now, I don’t want to watch you suffer. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll hightail it out of here, because that’s exactly what I’m going to do.”
She tried to pull away at first, but soon he’d backed her up to the wall, and the arm that wasn’t steadying her was groping at the edge of her skirt, pulling up and up. She cried out and smiled, maybe it sounded like moaning to him, maybe he liked that she was afraid.
Being restricted to the wheelchair was worse, but it provided a nice place to rest her head on her hands, while she listened to the Avengers argue back and forth.
She slowly turned her head away from the window she’s been staring out, and made eye contact with him. “You fought Thanos, did he give you can't clue as to his plan for after the snap? Did you find any coordinates while you were stranded?”
“In the pursuit of the strongest, I can. The trauma makes you ruthless, precise, and untouchable. Only once you’ve gone through purgatory, can you see heaven.”
Katya groaned quietly, before her head finally fell to her chest, a few more drops of blood slide down her neck and torso, but her body was still.
Finally, he has a shot, their back is turned and they’re running to the edge of the building when Steve throws his shield. His head snapped towards Steve suddenly, and he catches the saucer with ease, before sending it right back.
Her other beacon of light was a new friend she met at a summer program at MIT, James Rhodes. She and him emailed too, he was in the same grade and he even lived nearby, she and him seemed to click in the same way Lucie and her had. Well not exactly the same way, she couldn’t imagine Rhodey kissing her, he was like the brother she never had.
Going through a bit of writers block at the moment, and schools been HEcKing rOugh so if y'all could give me a bit of encouragement, it'll going a long long way! Thanks!
She almost doesn’t catch her slip out the backdoor when new guests arrive, and it takes a moment to detangle herself from the crowd to follow her.
Kozlov begins to ask another question, when Madame strides towards her, “That is quite enough Kozlov.”
“Then what’s your name?” Natasha says stepping back in the room, which unlike the others isn’t empty.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“We have an asset inside already, she’ll be watching to make sure you’re successful and she’ll get you out safely.”
She arrived at the SHIELD HQ only hours after hearing about the discovery, they must not have known she was coming, or that she knew where is was because they only caught her entering the second security clearance, after intimidating the first entrances guard to let her in.
Toni interrupted with a gunshot, everyone in the room flew to the ground but her, Natasha reacted fast, grabbing Toni and pulling her down the hallway and through the staircases. They went silently, guards were too busy securing the other floors to chase them.
Toni could barely feel the muscles in her leg, by the end of class, and she still had formal schooling to complete.
Yeah I did change the post date to cash in on views from the new black widow movie, what about it?? You have something to say? Keep it to your self. I deserve this, this is self care.
Toni only rolled her eyes, “Happy to see me, Utkyn? When it comes down to it, you’re really gonna have to get over that crush.”
“Are you injured? Do you need help?” The woman said, slightly more concerned, she didn’t wait for a response, “Your phone is being tracked help is on the way. Stay on the line, try and talk if you can.”
Toni’s whole body flinches at a loud sound nearby, she thought for sure Eva had spotted her, when she realized it was coming from outside.
-The hotel is a real 5-star hotel and it looks pretty awesome and is poorly described due to the horrible mess in the story.
Toni tries not to let the words get to her. She knows they’re a ploy. If she lets her guard down, Shvets won’t waste a second killing her. She won’t hesitate as Toni does.
Staring out the window is getting old fast, Steve lies beside her fast asleep, and she’s got a pit in her gut waiting for him to wake. He stirred slowly, just as the light from outside hits his face.
They stood at the gate, peering inside, the other woman turned their heads towards the lone window in the back of the cell, but Toni stared at the closest guard till he made eye contact. She looked at him angrily, rebelliously. Just like she knew he would, he picked her out of the bunch, so he could feel powerful as he beat the rebellion out of her.
The draw pulled her eye, and she bore into it like it might catch on fire if she stared long enough.
They touch back on earth quickly, in Wakanda, where Toni kept meaning to visit after it opened up to the rest of the world, never found the time between recently attempting and failing to save the world.
“You’re embarrassing, insufferable reputation for being a slutty party girl is ruining our good name.” Howard says calmly
“KGB then? Former CIA? Dishonorably discharged, and turned to mercenary work?” Pierce guesses, with each comment his smiles widen, “Or is it a lifelong friendship, Red Room?”
Tania leans closer, “Not really, you can tell me. I have to say I’m impressed you turned the tables that quickly.”
She cuts her hand on the rocks as she claws at the ground, trying to get away from the men surrounding her, but they grab her arms and she’s so tired she barely fights as they throw her into the back of the van that pulled up when she wasn’t looking.
She lay behind a huge table that’d been pushed sideways, and cardboard boxes stood between her an her soon to be killer; another girl, just three years older than her at nineteen, but equipped with a machine gun.
“Well I’m Sindy and this is Elle.” Sindy said, before looking Toni up and down, “Toni, Toni, Toni. That’s a boys name.”
But her best friend in the world was dead and hadn’t thought to tell Toni she’d been dying since the day they met.
“Pack an extra shirt by any chance?” Toni said, gesturing to the dirty, wet shirt drying on the rock.
He’d never admit it but he sighed a breath of relief. He probably shouldn’t have done that anyway. Natasha would be upset, maybe he just wouldn’t tell her.
She’d seen Eva talking to the young girls later that morning, and while she was drying off she heard giggles from behind her. No doubt, she’d convinced the girls to pull the prank.
“Hello darling.” She snaps to attention, and turns to the front. A tall blond woman sits on a heavy black desk. Everything about her is pointy, her bones almost poke out, her dress sticks out to a triangle, and especially the sharp high heels she taps on the ground.
Kozlov nodded, and moved on to the next girl in line. She skipped a girl every few questions, but Toni knew she wouldn’t be missed. Kozlov had a special hatred from her, she didn’t know why.
Tania scoffed, but no one argued with the Instructor. She took their silence as acceptance and led them to the next class.
“Alpha, an older asset, before your time, was a leader, impossible to look away from, impossible to refuse.”
But Tania was better than she looked, with a grin she slid just out of the way, and caught Toni from behind with another hit.
“Not on my watch,” Rhodey said, helping her through the door of her apartment, she realized she’d been speaking out loud and hoped she hadn’t said too much.
The room is cramped, but there's enough room for her to change, and sit to reread the brief. It mentions no motive for the mission, only location and target. She pauses momentarily at the top of the page.
She runs upstairs, and cries “Dad! Dad! My robot worked!” fprgetting he had company and only just noticing the table full of suprised faces, and the one annoyed face,
The Captain looked up in surprise, he probably would have thought she was an agent if she’d stayed in the formal wear, she broke the silence, “Nice to meet you. Captain.”
Nika looked so sad though, Toni almost wanted to let her win so she’d perk up a bit. It was depressing to watch her go through the motions.
“I’m not telling. Besides, maybe it was my fault. Maybe I embarresed myself and can never face them again.”
“You might be wondering how ballet translates to the refined act of murder.” Her smile was thin and frightening, “But you will find out soon enough.”
If they even bothered to investigate, they’d find guilt-ridden Manya, and a dead body fitting Toni’s description.
Lucie sat up on the bed, she glanced at the door, it was cracked open, that was the policy for some reason, no doors are completely closed.
“Well no, Howard, and his wife Maria passed away in two thousand five, when she was eighteen. She inherited it when she was twenty one. She’s actually the one who found you, she kept Howard’s project alive, to find you. She’s actually her today, we could probably find her for you.”
I-’m such a little bitch for characters repeating lines back to each other chapters later, AND saying the name of the story in the story. Sorry if it’s too cheesy for y’all, I just love love love it.
“Take her to the machine.” They grabbed her arms, and lifted her off the ground as she kicked and pulled.
“I mean,” Madame paused, walking towards the wall, “Lara Vasilla was not the only one being eliminated.”
Tania spent her practice time knotting Toni’s laces, or pulling down her skirt when she wasn’t looking. Toni spent her practice time practicing, which showed whenever they actually performed.
Unlike the other girls, Tania didn’t retreat into herself after the murder. Mila, and Toni became more quiet and reserved, even though no one even knew Toni murdered Nika.
“Yeah you don’t do anything! I worked to get here I didn’t sit on my ass and have things handed to me! You’ll learn what it’s like to struggle real soon.” Sasha reached forward and pushed Lucette, who at the last second grabbed the railing and only fell on her butt.
The sound was familiar. Gunfire, Toni decided. Eva had stopped right in front of the table, but was turned towards the door now. Tania must’ve been caught not far from here, and was probably dead.
This is literally almost done. The next two chapters are really short, like 10 between the two of them. Jesus. Thanks again to my beta, you're a godsend.
Whoever was driving by could help her, she turned over to her stomach, twisting her ankle, and kneeled on the asphalt. “Hey!” she called out, her voice raspy but surprisingly loud, “Help me! Please help!”
She paused as if waiting for a response, “I lost someone. Again. Didn’t think I could take it again, but here I am. Still standing no matter how much I wish I wasn’t.”
Evelyn might have started to deny any problem but quickly decided against it, “I think you’re a stuck up little brat who doesn’t deserve a thing she has.”
She realizes tears are welling in her eyes. For a second she considers lying, but all her other relationships were just about destroyed because of it, she can’t get out of this one.
She cycled through them in four weeks, week one she starts with Spanish or French, then English, then Mandarin or Korean, once and a while Japanese, and finish it off with Czech or Hungarian. Her other cycles consisted of mostly the same, just shuffled. And Toni memorized it, by heart.
“I know.” Toni pauses, “And I’m not going to kill you. I’m putting you somewhere, where you’ll never see the light of day again.”
The nurses took the baby away after soothing it’s cries. Toni had arranged for a closed adoption for a couple in America, no sexuality or location preferences, but Toni had no idea where it was going or to whom. And once again Toni was alone.
Maybe she sensed his hesitation, or how every bone in his body told him to run because she politely smiled, “Thank you, but I already have a load in downstairs.”
“My.. my sacrifice?” Lara repeats. Matveev doesn’t answer, and turns to Svetlana who’s face has taken on an ashen quality.
Toni only smiled, and tried to focus on Tania’s weaknesses. Strong legs, weak arms, too arrogant, easily riled. She repeated the mantra, and hoped Tania wasn’t doing the same for her.
Toni groaned and rolled over, ignoring Lucette for the rest of the night. It wouldn’t be long till Sasha told Van, and everyone else who Toni was. Everyone was going to hate her again.
“Nope. His pupils are responsive and when he wakes up they’ll run a few more cognitive tests but so far have no reason to think he’ll have any disability or trauma. Physical trauma.”
Annie blinks, not having seen this coming, unfortunately some part of this was true, she fully expected Father to run away, so she paused. “Just because your are a pathetic nobody doesn’t mean you get to hate me. I memorized the quadratic formula for fun, I can speak three languages plus english, I can do math science and much more in circle around you, the school district said I can’t be pushed up anymore grades to make sure I have some semblance of a childhood. But the thing is I don’t have to prove a goddamn thing to you because you’re right, in fifteen years I’ll be in charge of the largest tech company in America and you be just as sad and pathetic as you are right now.”
“We began this class with twelve students.” Toni furrowed her brow. The class had begun before her arrival though,
He’d retreived the newspaper early that morning, he always woke up early, and smack dab on the front page was her fathers face, and above it read, “Starks Die In Tragic Car Accident”
Madame gave Katya an unamused look, “Defiant doesn’t mean weak. Quite the opposite actually.” she turns to Toni,
“To make room. Ivana wasn’t booksmart, she wasn’t the kind of asset they wanted, so they took her outside and she never came back. Petra said she heard a gunshot from the library.”
Strangely they woke up together, even sitting up in the bed at the same time, silently putting on close before he tried to make awkward conversation.
She looked towards the bed as if she hadn’t been watching him, “I’ll go get you new ones.” She stepped out of the bathroom and towards the door, but he caught the crook of her elbow, it took every bit of willpower not to flip him over her back and pin him to the ground.
It’s been a while since she’s actually seen the woman, and it shows on her face. New wrinkles run through her chin and forehead, and her neck started to sag.
But Sunday night she got a notification, “Shit.” Brynn exclaimed, she rarely swore, “What?” Toni replied
The conspiracy theories around Toni’s sexuality got worse by the day, and she had quite a few more days of eighth grade at this school. Her room was empty, Willa, her new roommate didn’t stick around long, only slept in the shared room once a week.
She was never paid. But groceries were dropped off every week, her bills were never sent directly to her, and she had a single card that seemingly never ran out of money when she shopped for clothes or furniture.
Only a few weeks after she was outed, Toni was walking down the hallway, she spotted Sasha and Lucette talking near the staircase and moved closer to hear what they were saying.
“You’re guilty.” Steve continued, as if she’d said nothing, “You created Ultron, and you skipped out on fighting him, because you were mad I wouldn’t tell everyone I liked you. Are you really so insecure?”
“That’s another project. It silences automatically, tells the shooter when the targets in range, and had pin point accuracy.”
“No. Maybe your dad is, but you are not. You’re made of diamond, tough but beautiful rare but dangerous. A promise, you’re a promise but you decided what that promise is.”
“Oh my gosh, Stark!” Steve yelled from the kitchen, Toni rolled her eyes and traipsed in to watch the show begin, “You do realize people other than you live here?”
Kissing Lucie is a lot like knowing Lucie, soft and sweet and pure. Her blonde hair was long but often swept back, her green eyes were striking. Neither deepened the kiss, neither knew how. But they sat there kissing slowly, tenderly for what seemed like a long time.
“And who exactly is that?” Nick says finally after catching Steve up on what’s really been going on in SHIELD- or Hydra.
“You weren’t having a teenager rebellion phase Tania! You were murdering people, you killed young girls!”
The doctor pauses, “We had to remove her to operate on you. There was extensive damage, I’m afraid the car crash ruptured part of the uterus, we only would’ve been able to save her if you had no injuries, but that wasn’t the case.”
“I don’t care” was her anthem for a while, all the way till Christmas when her parents requested her presences at Stark Manor. The stuffy old house seemed like hell and she meant to decline, but the carefully worded letter was filled with concern, and hope, and that was two more emotions than Maria normally managed.
Rhodey forced coffee down her throat and she pointed out a home IV kit in the back, he rolled his eyes, “You have a problem you know?”
“You’re much smaller than us, always have been.” She starts, “Some girls here are petite, but you always looked younger. Besides, you’re much less… developed.”
The helicopter approached in the distance, none of them said anything as they boarded, or as they flew. The landscape was familiar, Russian forest. They’d studied it in history and rudimentary science classes.
“A lot of things. Most of it’s making fun of you for stupid stuff, like your accent, or ‘amnesia’. Some of it though, she was disappointed in herself. She broke her toe the next day getting herself on Pointe.”
“Toni?” A familiar voice says, ironically the second she’d given up hope and retreated to the snack bar was when Lucie happened upon her.
Finding Sitwell should be a good thing, but Steve has an uneasy tension in his chest. As they drive down the highway, he wants to turn around to see what’s coming every other minute. But he stops himself because he’s being ridiculous, till the steering wheel of the car is ripped out from above, and Steve almost screams they crash so fast.
“You’ll be placing twenty listening devices all over Ihor Mazur’s room. You have a maid outfit in your grab bag, along with a bulletproof stealth suit for your expos.”
-If you think I actually rewatched the incredibly awkward scene between Sharon Carter and Steve in the hallway 7 times to get the dialogue, you are absolutely right. And yes it was painful.
“No no, I was pretty much running down the hall. It’s my fault-” He started, and joined her in picking up the papers, they were almost all mail, labeled with the name 'Eugenia Wilson’. He squinted at the paper a moment before looking up at her, “Eugenia?”
It wasn’t long till the guards came around. They took two women outside every night for execution. The longer the Prime Minister held on to his position, the more prisoners would die, one of which was his daughter.
“You have got to be kidding me. That’s literally psychotic. That’s just cruel! He’ll wake up thinking he didn’t miss anything, then have it ripped away?”
His mind reeling after his tense discussion with Fury, Steve hopped up the stairs of his new apartment.
Instead she was surprisingly receptive to escaping. Maybe she’d been plotting all along like Toni had, maybe she’d been too afraid to hope.
“She’s disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the internet.” Pierce supplies,
The girls bully Toni out of fear, because they think she’ll get them eliminated, they all kinda bully each other because they’ve lived together for so long and all the stress of potentially dying really gets to them, mind you all the other girls are 20 years old, Toni is 17 so there’s also that.
It wasn’t long till he couldn’t stand upright, and his handwriting lagged. Next went his speech, and his dart throwing aim.
“Antoinette! Please! Tell your daddy you like me better! I can be your mommy, tell him you love me more!” She pleaded, dropping to her knees in front of the then five year old. Annie’s face never betrayed her, and Mother’s watchful gaze never shifted.
The grade school she was at was private, just like all the other schools she’d been to. It had itchy, ugly uniforms and strict teachers, Annie personally thought they should unionize to get better pay, more flexible hours, and benefits but no one listened. The girls there were much nicer than previous schools, Annie figured their awareness of her family, and fortune might have something to do with that but they all came from fairly wealthy families so she gave them the benefit of the doubt. She actually had a group of people she hung out with, well hung out with is a strong word, she sat with them class, and lunch and mostly agreed with whatever they said and didn’t say anything.
Francesca was not invited to dinner ever, Antoinette didn’t know where she ate. She wished Francesca was here because Father was sick or something, sick and angry, he moved slowly and talked mostly gibberish, but still managed to cuss out Mother.
“No.” Manya says, “My father granted me the autonomy to choose my husband, more than other girls get. I never picked anyone, and now I’m nearly thirty and unmarried. Practically an old hag.”
“We don’t have to tell everyone. I mean I wasn’t thinking a press conference.” She looks down at her hands, “Just our friends. The Avengers.”
She glanced at his name, and she hung out in the bar he frequented. He preferred blondes so she wore a wig. It wasn’t long until he approached her. Adrian Krupin was young. He would’ve been a good council member.
Toni thinks it’s a lie, they never see it coming. That’s the point of the process, shock someone enough and eventually they accept the shock.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
Their faces were stoic, judgmental, and all around prudish. She made a point of avoiding the last month or so of her life, steering clear of partying, to avoid a fight. But that’s where Howard wanted to go, and Howard didn’t like not getting his way.
Toni exhaled deeply, and Katya struggled under her harder. Deep down, they both knew there was no way she’d win this fight, but neither wanted Katya to die.
The ride was silent. Her apartment was in the heart of Moscow, where she could be operated by Hydra at a moments notice.
Manya’s father was an untrusting man, and he was hard set in his ways. He’d allowed his daughter to go unmarried, but this would be the final straw.
They find him, calm him down, and sit him in a poorly lit room, and if the Captain was handcuffed to a table it wouldn’t look out of place.
“Sobol.” Madame said, and Toni looked towards her, trying to keep her expression even, “Eliminate her.”
Her desk was characteristic disheveled and despite being often tempted, Toni didn’t move any of her stuff onto Willa’s desk or bed. She didn’t need to give Sasha anymore fuel, to call her out on being selfish or kicking Willa out of their room, Toni could picture it now, “Lonely Loser”, taunting her in the hallways, it was better than the other L word, lesbian.
The next morning, her night with Lucie seemed like a dream. Maria was gone, left early the morning, and Howard was lazily sitting in the living room, drunk or hungover.
Sure enogh two monthes later the Stark pistol XI 4 came out, exactly how Toni had designed it, with Howard Stark printed across the handle.
Her smile was thin and fake, and it gave Toni a slimy uneasy feeling. She then reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a square cloth. Toni couldn’t flinch away when she pressed the towelette to her mouth and nose, it stung only a little, but Toni was burning with anger when the world got darker, and the faces surrounding her faded.
A team up probably wasn’t what Madame or the Instructors wanted anyways, so Toni ducked a different way and found herself trapped in this tiny room with Eva and her assault rifle.
“I’m Toni Stark! That’s what’s wrong! I literally cannot fuck you, it’s just now allowed. The last time I fucked my dad’s business rivals’ kid...”
More blood poured out of Katya, but at that information, she began struggling against her ropes and crying muffled screams.
“The Merchant of Venice.” Klara replied clunkily, over pronouncing Merchant and pretty much missing the entirety of the word Venice, she’d never pass for an American. Kozlov’s lips tighten into a frown, but it’s for show, deep down she’s pleased.
The returned to the files, and Toni looked down at what she was wearing. A formal business dress, stilettos, she’d just come out of meeting. She looked ridiculous, and turned to Coulson who was sitting in a chair nearby going through some cards.
Lucifer. She wanted to laugh. It seemed like not long ago she was calling Madame the devil, and now the older woman had turned around and branded her with the name. Lucifer.
Targets were high profile people, celebrities or inventors, he started to wonder who Toni really was.
“Yeah, please tell me what he or she did so bad you’ve basically blocked off the entirty of the east coast.”
The next award show she went to was much smoother, she was seven now, and the stylist had approved outfits beforehand, Ann preferred red specifically, and that's what she wore. She kept her bearing this time and snuck away from Maria towards the reporters, “Ann! Ann! Can we talk to you for a second?”
She arrived in the morning, classes in session, a few drifters scrambled through the hall, none looked at her.
Toni swallowed hard. They liked to run these tests, give one group an advantage, send the other running, like a game of hunting. They’d done it a dozen more times after the first, but hadn’t used it for elimination since Mila. She didn’t like the sick look in Eva’s eyes as she realized the similarity to their first trial.
The grab bag is in the back, next to a door mark ‘change’ so she slings the bag over her shoulder and opens the door.
With only one more floor to go, he pauses to pass the girl standing in the hallway talking on the phone. He almost squeezes by. Natasha’s voice is in his head suddenly, “You know if you asked Kristen out, from statistics, she’d probably say yes.”
She looked to Jarvis with tear stains down her cheeks, and spot of wet all down her shirt, “Jarvis! I can’t do it!”
What? She managed to move her arm a little, trying to touch her stomach. She thinks she was able to feel it earlier. Alex. She couldn’t move her hand far enough, it just laid limply at her side.
Evelyn face was foaming, she looked like she might start crying, when suddenly it changed, she Annie turned around to see the teacher standing behind her, and she was angry.
She made them line up next to the mirror before she began again, this time studying each of us a moment, “I will now issue the uniform you will be expected to care for and be wearing at every class. She held up a small black leotard, and loose ballet slippers.”
Two years after she found out everything she could about her daughter, and Toni was busy. Good busy.
Toni smiles, the bartender pours them, and hands over the glasses, both Toni and the woman drink. “Not my friend, but you’re still drinking.”
The word rang in her skull, she remembered the name. The soldier. Madame told her about him the first time she was here. He was an asset of Hydra.
“кандидат в красную комнату?” he says coldly, she doesn’t know what the red room is, or why she’s a candidate, but she doesn’t want to find out. The soldier nods, and a few more people emerge from the car, dressed in black suits like the first man.
But would the remaining girls end the game? Along with Eva, Klara Petrov and Mila Fedorov were in the basement, armed and ordered to kill them.
“Now, my prize was to be awarded to the killer of the night, but as we don’t know exactly what happened to Fedorov, and Eva here seems to blame Antonia, she will be tonight's winner.”
Nika is killed for ‘telling lies’ and Toni starts out the chapter fed up with lying, but finishes the chapter lying through her teeth so she isn’t also eliminated
“Yeah, because you don’t do anything any yet you have everything. Everyone says your this genius like your father, but I think it’s all a ruse so that they can make your inherit the company when your daddy gets tired or runs off with some bitch.”
Then he walked around the car slowly, to the driver's seat. Her father hadn’t moved yet, and she didn’t know if he was playing dead or if he was dead, but he’d stayed slumped over the steering wheel since she opened her eyes. He tore off the door again, and threw him from the car. She barely refrained from crying out for him, but her only hope was to remain unseen in the back. She could hear his fists drive into her father's body, maybe he was already dead, if not he’d be close now. Finally, she heard the loud thunk of metal hitting asphalt, and he lifted her father from the ground back into the driver's seat.
“Now get changed, you have five minutes. Then go get your father, he’s in his room.” Maria paced out of the large closet, then out of Toni’s room, leaving her to change in silence.
Just as she was giving up for the afternoon, she heard a rustling coming from a hallway she’d not yet gone through.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
She leaves the headquarters in a faze, calling a ride home, and mulls over the day. It was a big day. Captain America is alive, found, kinda funny, but thinks of her as Howard’s daughter because of course he does. It’s like the universe found out she felt back to normal so it yelled, surprise surprise bitch.
“I’m literally deform, don’t make me show you.” She was ready to unbutton her shirt when she got a ping on her stark phone. It read, “Urgent: South Alaska-Antarctic search squad found something early this morning. Looks promising. What next?”
“Tera, tell me where the nearest rager to my house is.” She phoned her nearby friend, who always seemed to know where free booze was.
-Basically, after Captain America 2, iron man 1 happened, except Toni had to convince everyone she was not only who she said she was, but also capable of running the company. Then Obie has her kidnapped and the rest follows the plot, except ironman isn’t involved in the battle of new york, which doesn’t make sense but we’re ignoring it. So she’s ironman, but also black widow, in other words, a total badass.
“Unimportant. What’s all this?” She gestures to the many boxes of files and paper, some paper is just spread out on the floor in no particular manner of organization.
And finally she was rushed to the hospital two weeks early, and Toni’s pretty sure she pushed herself into labor out of sheer force of will.
“Coming!” She drops her shoes and bag by the door, walks into the kitchen. Steve is mixing something on the stove and the world news channel is on.
She skips dinner that day, opting to go to her favorite abandoned classroom in the lone wing. She starts off with push ups, then squats. She’s been working on holding handstands since last June, because she thinks it’ll help her with ballet.
“Can I ask you a question?” Pierce turns to another man, “What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow? And you knew they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium. For execution. And you could just stop it, with the flick of a switch. Would you? Wouldn’t you all?”
With renewed adrenaline, they approach the two, sure enough, the soldier manages to toss the woman backward again and reoriented himself towards Steve.
Toni didn’t speak. She didn’t want to. Maybe they’d take her off missions, she was torn between immense relief, and the knowledge that an asset that doesn’t go on missions is useless. And useless means dead.
“Oh, yeah!” She exclaimed, and then something Ann would never be able to place possessed her, she stuttered for words before spitting out, “I’m Toni.”
She sticks to single men to avoid drama, but throughout the night she keeps an eye on Manya, who loiters in the back, torn between looking bored and angry the whole night.
He nodded, but his muscles tensed. He hadn’t been there in weeks, and he’d hardly used his TV since he moved in. He just nodded towards her, but carefully walked towards his door.
She let her get up, and begin again, neither struck each other for a moment, but that wouldn’t go over well with Madame, so Toni started to jab her in the stomach.
Six months was a long time to be pregnant. When she first started feeling sick, she’d blamed extreme drinking and slight drug use, but now she knew it was because she was growing a child it felt even more exhausting. But Italy was beautiful and she never had to leave her penthouse apartment that came with a pool, and a view. She’s signed in under a false name and only the room service knew she was pregnant. She wasn’t even showing that much.
It wasn’t till a pool or blood circled her skill that she got up and returned to the line. They all stood at attention, waiting for their next order. The Instructor, Kevac, simply ordered the next two girls to begin their spar.
“Mine couldn’t miss work. I’m Sasha.” She held out her hand and Ann shook it without a word, “Are you going to tell me yours?”
“Yes.” Zma nodded, “It’s easy to knock big things off balance, and even easier to tire them out. That’s why you are all being instructed in the art of ballet. Elegance and grace are just as important as brute strength.”
“Yes, Lucette Steele will be in attendance. I suggest you behave yourself.” Maria continued primly, “Her father is one of Howard’s biggest competitors, so a friendship between you two could be bad. Let alone a...” Maria didn’t finish her sentence.
For a moment Eva almost seems to try to talk again, and Toni wants to hold her back, to protect her from Madame’s wrath, when she regains composure and satisfies herself with glaring at Toni.
But Eva followed her, “Oh we’re not afraid of you. We’re afraid of what you might do to civilians.” She was following so close she might’ve stepped on her heels.
Thankfully, it wasn’t long till another girl, Svetlana, got on Pointe, Katya and Lidia followed her. Now only Nika and Lara weren’t using Pointe shoes.
They only made eye contact for a second, but Katya’s eyes were wild and afraid. She would die, one way or the other. She might’ve been confused as to why Toni didn’t do it then and there, and maybe she should have, but she couldn’t bring herself to end this poor girl’s life in a dingy basement, on a wrestling mat, in front of six teenage girls.
The car was driven by a silent chauffeur, who didn’t debrief her, let alone look back to notice the stream of tears sliding down her face as they drove further and further from the hotel.
She gestured towards the open door, and Toni started walking through it, limping slightly, where Eva hid tried to kick in her knee when the trial began, the Instructors stayed inside watching and cleaning the room.
She’d brought some jeans, a little ripped from working on her car, and a plain black T shirt and vans. She didn’t bring any more underwear so they thong stayed.
Skipping down the hallway lightly, Toni ignored the glares, just as she opened her door, Willa tried to exit, bumping into Toni.
This week, poor Nika Lupu, a tall, slender girl with lovely black hair, who excelled in history and science, spilled her lunch all over the table on Monday.
Steve nodded, and for a moment it was silence. Awkward silence. “Hey, uh if you want-if you want, you’re welcome to use my machine.” He gestured to the small basket of laundry she held. “Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.”
“Oh I’m sorry Antoinette, we already have too many people.” a girl she thought was named Holly said sweetly, but superficially, barely even turning around to look at her.
Tania shook her head. “Rumor has it that your amnesia is bullshit. Nika told us some stuff before she was eliminated. Crazy stuff.”
Tania cursed the Instructor under her breath, along with Toni and the spectators, if Zma heard it, she didn’t show.
She breathed in hard but the air in her throat hurt and she choked. Pins and needles seemed be poking her in the face, and bile rised in her gut. She fell out of bed and dashed to the cabinet filled with vodka, and martini glasses, numbing the pain didn’t work last time but second times the charm.
Koila was not good at guarding her expressions, so Toni knew she’d bought the story, “I wish I could say I was brave, or I defended the Prime Minister, but I was just trying to escape.”
“Begin.” A familiar voice said, they turned to look towards the source and saw that Madame had joined the Instructor in observation. There would be an elimination, Toni was sure of it.
“Well with your history, I’d suggest you keep it. Your history of alcoholism might put extra strain on the body with the procedure, and since your young, the pregnancy would have less effect on the body, at least physically. Emotionally you’ll need support. Tremendous support.”
They must’ve had some sort of gas or weapons in their backseat, because the explosion mostly went backwards. She could see the flames above her and behind her, but her car was mostly untouched by the fire. The metal and glass however, was bent and sprayed all around her, she could barely reach for the back pocket  of her jeans.
Toni couldn’t make out much of her features, due to the thick black sunglasses she had on, but she noticed a tiny red hourglass symbol on her belt.
One might’ve thought after being kidnapped, forced into mercenary work from a young age, and psychologically tortured, Toni’s life would get easier after all that was done. One would be wrong.
-January 8th Adam and Eve were created in the first week and were quickly sent away from Eden after being tempted by the serpent, often recognized as Satan himself or at least a demon of Satan. I couldn’t find anything on the exact date Lucifer fell from Heaven, but I’ve heard conflicting reports, that Lucifer meddled with Adam and Eve which was his wrongdoing against god, or that he had already fallen and was just doing his satanic thing. I’ve gone with the former, as Toni becomes ‘Lucifer’ in this chapter and according to the Catholic version of the story, and believe me I’ve read them all from Judaism to Islam, I went with this being the act that creates Satan, or Lucifer. Also, hypersexuality is a symptom of PTSD and poor mental health if observed after a sexual assault. I think it’s and underrepresented symptom and it fights Toni’s character really well since she's a control freak and losing control like that would’ve been really traumatic
All three of us? Toni looked towards Klara, who was grinning wilding at her, then towards Tania who seemed more interested in her mashed potatoes than the conversation going on feet from her.
It wasn’t till they’d found the safe SHIELD car parked two blocks down that Natasha turned to her, “Did you shoot him?”
She takes a break, only a few minutes, till she clears the perimeter of the classroom and starts running laps. Thrifty, sixty, ninety, till she collapses on a desk
The kind robotic voice replied, “All the Avengers are on their floors, with the exception of Captain Rogers who’s down the hall. Should I give him the go ahead?”
During a nightmare of an evening fueled by red bull an and uneasy feeling of being forever alone, Toni created JARVIS. Almost no one made the connections between JARVIS and Jarvis, except Rhodey.
She didn’t shop often, only when an item is worn out or was ruined. But she wondered about it a lot. Her parents never had problems with money, but that was because her father worked all the time. Was she indirectly being paid, or was there so much money on the card it wouldn’t have to be filled for years.
But their talking from the right side of a two way mirror and the Captain doesn’t know their there, so it’s not that repurposed.
His face was beautiful as usual, shaven, and perfect. Just the way she remembered the pictures on Howard’s desk.
Toni didn’t know why she was mad at Lucie, it’s not like she killed herself, and it’s not like this was a shock to anyone else. But it shook Toni to her core, made her reevaluate life, because if it can snuff out a good person, a much better person that To I'll ever be, slowly and painfully letting her suffer like that, then what’s the point?
She stops putting her jeans on suddenly, of course that’s why. He wanted an out. “Ok. I understand.”
He peered in curiously, his face was almost familiar, despite being mostly covered up. She pushed her back further into the door, but he snatched her by her foot and dragged her out of the car. As she hit the pavement, and was dragged into the highway, she waited for his fists to hit. She covered her face as best she could, but her head and back hurt so much she couldn’t think straight.
“What do you call this then?” She beamed again, and went for a right hook that landed with a satisfy crunch, but Tania was all laughs when she recovered, “Can’t talk your way out of this one Sobol, I’m bigger and stronger, and I’ll end you.”
“Good morning, candidates.” She said, smiling widely at the terrided line of faces. Twelve girls stand at attention. Toni was third to last in line, and certainly going to get a question. The other girls hadn’t figured Kozlov out, they didn’t know her routine.
They never talked, but they never fought which was rare, it’s like the library was a safe zone in their war.
It was easier to pretend to be drunk while she took shots of water than to sit in her cold apartment staring at the TV reporting her latest mission.
It was getting dark when she was done, after heating up today's soup, and washing it down with the first sip of water from her canteen, she put out the troublesome fire and laid between two fallen logs.
A death sentence if she’d ever heard one, Toni smiled in return, “I don’t know if you understand the point of this program Eva, but the reason we’re here is to complete missions.”
The doctors smiled comfortingly, placing a hand on her shoulder, “We'll take a day or two, decide but try to do it quickly.” She turned to leave the room so Toni could get dressed, but Toni said, “What do you think I should do?”
Toni is a missing kid, even if everyone thinks she’s dead, and a lot of other candidates were missing children.
Petra dramatically walked towards the mat, “Oooh I’m so scared. Try not to kill anyone this time Sobol?”
Ignoring her, Toni continues, “I mean if I was named Judyta, I’d change it too. But how did you land on ‘Madame’? Was it given to you, or did you pick it out yourself?”
“They were attempting to blackmail me, Madame.” Toni says finally, after Madame had cooled down a bit and was pausing.
“I identify with it. Fritz Haber made two world changing inventions using nitrogen. Fertilizer, which ended up saving tons of people from starving, but he also started chemical warfare for the Germans in world war one.”
She sat through twenty minutes of the examining celebrities dresses, before they came to Jodie Foster, apparently accompanied by Howard Stark.
“I have a daughter.” His shock is obvious and he says nothing, “ten years ago, I gave her up. Didn’t even know her name or gender or where she went till my parents died. I looked her up. She lives in California.”
Ok so this gets dark, you've been warned, but then again what do you expect out of a Red Room fic? Please leave a comment below, they give me life, even one word literally makes my day. Thanks a billion to my beta! Could do it without ya!
“I just arrived to tidy your room, sir.” She paused, looking around the filth, “We didn’t expect you back so soon.”
Sasha was standing close by with her parents, her grin was malleolus and it grew as she stalked over to Toni.
It came back in bits and pieces over the years. She strained her head trying to remember her mother’s face or the smell of her father’s cologne. They were never great parents, but they were parents.
“Well, getting into a room with Alexander Pierce isn’t a bad start.” Natasha says turning on her heel, “I don’t know if you’re ready to go with Steve, but I wouldn’t mind a little backup.”
“You weren’t exactly on call.” She tapped her fingers together, “He knew. He didn’t want to be involved I guess. Or maybe he didn’t want to be involved with me. It doesn’t really matter now Alex is dead.”
The fight happened two afternoons later. They changed out of their ballet uniforms, and into tight spandex shorts, and loose camisoles. Both of them braided their hair into buns, wore mouth guards and non stick sneakers.
“Jodie Foster? You met Jodie Foster! She just won an Oscar!” Eryn said, “Did you get to meet her? Did you go to the after parties?”
“I’m being sold already?” Toni said, a quip about being rescued from a whore house was on the tip of her tongue and only by the grace of God did she resist.
There were three chairs, and the candidates all took one, Tania snagged the one closest to the door, and Eva took the one farthest. Eva had grown to hate Tania even more than she hated Toni, for killing her best friend.
Shwarma is just as delicous as Toni thought it would be. Or maybe it’s the rush of adreneline of almost dying or sending a trickster packing or all of the above. She doesn’t care because it’s offically added to her take out list.
“I’d known her for years, just like I’ve known all of you for years. But she was the first one to talk to me like a person.”
“I tried to follow you. Tania’s not letting me sit down in the mess hall, so I figure I’d hang with you, but you weren’t in the library, and I saw you go down one of these hallways once, but then I got lost.”
“You know it’s different. He was with them for decades, just shy of a century. You need to be angry at the ones pulling the strings.”
She looked back at Tania, whose face had turned red. Her hands awkwardly held each other in front. She wondered why a moment before she remembered her own appearance. Her long hair had been freed from it’s ponytail to wash any remaining soot, and she only had a flesh color bra on.
“I was just thinking of dear Ursula.” Toni remarks, “Do you think she knew what was happening in her final moments?”
She wished she was an airhead, who couldn’t tell calculus from quantum physics, because the only thing her ‘gifted mind’ was getting her now was a death sentence.
“Yeah actually it is. What’s not fair is a group of psycho terrorists murdering my baby!” She cried, and took a deep breath, “And I’m getting pretty fucking fucking tired of people telling how to feel!”
“That’s fine, I have to go anyways.” She gathered her clothes, and thanked god they were casual, so she didn’t look like a total slut doing the walk of shame.
She felt like the room had gotten smaller the longer they talked, and Toni couldn’t even bring herself to look towards the woman as she gave the final details of her new assignment. She just nodded in understanding and turned away.
“What good name? The only difference between you and me is you did it in front of your wife and child.” Toni replies equally as calmly
An intimidating man, Toni identified as Mr. Volkov, told Toni she must be punished for being unnatural, and corrupting his daughter.
She kicked furiously as they brought her to the side of the plane, but she was determined not to let herself fit through the little door, when woman in a suit approached, “This will make it easier for all of us trust me sweetheart.”
“I don’t know.” Toni said shifting her weight on her heels, they were only an inch or two high, while Sindy and Elle’s were easily four, “Why don’t we sit.”
“I know you lost a lot Toni.” He replies, she’s stepped closer and closer to him, half attempting to be threatening despite her height, and half because she can feel the world slowly slipping out from under her and despite their past she knows he’ll at least catch her.
“No, Antoinette, you can’t, you can never play with us!” The boy closest to her said, and it took Antoinette by surprise, usually they just made fun of her, saying she’s be bad at basketball, or she was a girl so she couldn’t play, or that because she was wearing a dress.
“I left a change of clothes in my bag, I’m going to get it. You better not move him before I get back.”
The building is cold too, and the sheets she was issued are thin and worthless, so she sleeps on top of them to avoid frantically making her bed before inspection every morning.
It takes weeks before the bug starts to show, just like planned. Sasha blames Toni, of course because she’s not stupid, but Toni didn’t plan for her revenge.
“So you’re keeping Captain America hostage? I mean I found him so if anyone should get to keep him hostage, it should be me. By the way, no one has thanked me for discovering our ‘national treasure’ possibly saving him even.”
She was leaving the Red Room. She was going outside, for the first time in years. And if she had anything to say about it, she wasn't going to come back.
It was the equivalent of her parents telling her they weren’t angry, just disappointed. She looked over at the other Avengers, minus Thor, who usually dropped in, literally, every other week for a fight and some lunch and then went back to his galactic ass kicking.
They all eventually stood up and followed Toni down the stairs, where the robot sat. She pressed her buttons, and once again it beeped on, before the arm began to move.
“That I was American.” Nika exhales sharply, “My parents were assassinated. I remember that a little. I can see a man choking my mother to death, but that’s all. And they said I was a genius, my IQ was 146. That’s why they placed me ahead of my age, I think.”
Has it been 2 and a half months since I posted? Yes. Do I have an excuse? No. Am I sorry? Yes. Will I ever learn? No. God bless my beta, idk why she puts up with me. I'm excited for y'all to read the notes I made while writing this whole thing because you'll get to experience no less than two mental breakdowns(as of now). Junior year kicked my ass, writing kicked my ass, we really aren't thriving, but I love getting notifications that my subscriptions have been updated so this is your no nut November gifts your welcome.
Toni stares at the thin layer of dust coating her hands in disbelief. It blows away in the wind after a moment, so she starts digging into the small pile of dust clumped on the ground. It wasn’t long till she cracked her nails, and the tips of her fingers started to bleed. She could feel the presence of another behind her, watching. She ignored them.
It took months before she managed to pull herself together again. She’d stared at a bottle of booze for what felt like years, before she found every bottle in the tower and poured them down the drain one by one. She was tired of moving backwards.
Her arms go quicker than her core, so she takes off her shoes, and ties up her hair and starts jumping jacks. Her legs ache, and her stomach shoots pain, but she goes till she’s done a hundred.
“No. I remembered being dragged into a room, strapped down to a machine, it hurt so badly and when I woke up, everything was almost blank.” She pauses, “But they lied. They said my parents were Henrik and Marzia. That they sold me. And my name was Antonia. But I saw my file on a table nearby and read everything written about me. That’s all I know.”
The other women snapped at her at first, but everyone soon realized it did no good. The young girl was inconsolable.
The horn goes off and every nerve in her body tells her to duck not run. She drops to the ground and barely dodges a cloud of bullets.
None of the Avengers crumbled, but all of the newbies did, they got a call from Clint later confirming. She offered condolences to them, but didn’t look Rogers in the eyes. Bucky was dead, or gone at least. She didn’t feel a sense of satisfaction more than anger. Steve obviously thought she’d be pleased to hear the news.
Ann is assured the plan was to send her to boarding school after elementary school anyways, but she’s thinks it had more to do with getting kicked out of school after school, they’d probably run out of private schools, and god forbid Antoinette Stark goes to public school.
She sat down at the counter, opposite him, “I do realize, but it’s still my name of the lease and on the bills so...”  she said poking the mess she’d left on the counter. It wasn’t that big a deal, and she’d actually meant to clean it up before they got home, but there was this huge explosion in the lab and motor oil is a bitch to wash off so she’d gotten distracted.
“He pulled me out of the car and held me to the ground for ten or twenty minutes. Till they came and brought me to Russia. I refused to go along with their program so they put me into this sort of electric chair. It made it hard to remember things for a while but they left my file on a table nearby. I read everything, but it was like reading someone else’s biography. It was only after I escaped that memories came back.”
“At least pretend you have a sliver of self respect Francesca.” Antoinette turned to see her mother standing in a doorway nearby, she looked mad, maybe at Antoinette for being expelled.
Lucie’s stopped calling. Probably moved on, or realized what a mess she was. Or maybe she’s mad Toni went to college first, since she got early admissons, and Lucie’s still in highschool.
The strong doors that held her in all these years opened wide, but Toni didn’t think the toll had been worth it. The baggage she carried with her made her hands and backache, but it was too late to turn around.
It was weeks till she worked up the courage to make her first recording, and it wasn’t for the person she really wanted to talk to. Pepper was a safe bet. Caring, non judgmental. She could confess her sins, and she had no grievances against the woman, her best friend.
The fire wasn’t easy to light, it took most of her patience not to kick the whole set up to smithereens numerous times, before she finally felt set up.
“I’m sorry Stark. I really have to go.” She hopped of the large couch and tugged on some jeans she must have brought. “I can’t be with you. You’re too much, their gonna read between the lines if we try to hide it.”
Long term poisonings took more than a slip of a hand and the trading of a side dish. You needed to be close to them as you killed them, they had to trust you.
“You’re aunt was part of SHIELD? Is that why you want to kill the soldier so bad, did he kill your aunt?”
Toni could see the slight cracks in Coulson's normally neutral face, she’d almost surprised him, she’d almost made him blush or laugh or prove he was human in some way. But not quite. One day.
“How will this teach us to fight, Instructor?” She said in a small voice. She was a tiny thing, about as big as Toni. She looked like a dancer already, with delicate features and graceful arms.
“Alex,” she muttered, and for a moment she was afraid no one was there to hear it, she didn’t know if she could wait for someone to show up and do it again, but then she heard the shuffle of sneakers next to her, “What was that? What’d you say?”
She steps out and breathes deeply, a smile playing on her lips despite herself, and she only just noticed the helicopter approaching in the distance.
Toni wished she could say the expirence changed her. She grew as a person and she stopped her wicked ways. But there was always a party and Toni could always get in, and practically everyone was an enabler. She left the mansion shortly after reciving two manilla folders labelled “Antointte Stark Adoption”, she nearly burned them, but resolved to never look at them, but bring them to her house in New York City.
“Do we have an update on family? Or her name?” The doctor said, “I don’t know how much more we can do without consent.”
“You punched a kindergartener!” Lucie exclaimed, they were lying opposite on Lucie’s bed. Toni’s feet on the pillows, Lucie’s head on the pillows.
“And the name, I had the honor of choosing myself.” Madame continued, “An asset’s code name is to reflect the nature of their work and their personality, Black Widow, of course, is beautiful and deadly, silently and toxic.”
At the end of the day, her muscles ached and all she wanted to do was fall into the thin bed. Instead, during their dinner break, she searched for another empty classroom.
“Loyalty is freedom, work is peace.” Madame starts, the girls respond, “We’re all daughters of Russia, our mission is to serve.”
Zma quickly put a stop to it with the flick of her wrist, she knocked the hand of a girl picking at her leotard, and she cried out.
Fury being alive is however unexpected. Natasha is happier than she lets on, even with the morphine for her bullet wound, she doesn’t get emotional.
He was smelly and fat, not necessarily the worst thing someone could be, but paired with an uneven temper, and incredibly boring interests, she could barely stand the sight of him, let alone to spend time with him.
She felt bad. He wasn’t a nice man, but she didn’t know his crimes against Russia, she didn’t know why he would die a miserable shadow of himself.
Steve crashes through windows and doors after him and almost doesn’t notice the figure right behind him.
“That’s alright, you can call me Toni.” Why not make friends with your dad’s prostitutes, what could go wrong.
Toni nodded numbly. Maybe her blood would boil while she did it, maybe she wouldn’t have the strength to care for her wounded pride.
Koala's sobbing began as they walked through the filthy hallways. A guard led them through the building, and another stood behind them, in case they ran.
Mystery brunette seemed okay with the arrangement, and she followed him up stair to a large red bed in a room lined with mirrors and windows.
Whoever she went home at night, never saw her again, and if they did she didn’t recognize them, and it must’ve been someone who looked just like her because she had that kind of face.
He doesn’t think much of the call from Pierce the next day. Maybe it’s to debrief or tell him who’ll be taking over Fury’s position. He doesn’t see it coming, not by a long shot.
She laced each one with an untraceable neurotoxin. The nights she made him dinner, she sprinkled it on like seasoning, or baked it inside.
She tried to remember what he looked like, but all she could remember where his wild blue eyes, they looked terrified and terrifying at the same time.
But it was June. Toni was tired. She’d made plans for the end of the school year, Rhodey and her were taking the metro back to MIT to start the summer program early, and Toni didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize this. So she sat back and listened.
Sasha, to the least, was shock. Toni had always been quiet, even when they were friends. She looked like she was about to retort when Toni grabbed Lucette’s hand and hauled her back to their room. Neither spoke till they were safe inside.
She runs a hand through her hair, and thank god she managed to put a shirt on before Eva arrived, she uses it to wipe away her tears,
They began and Toni quickly took advantage of Petra’s lack of technique. She had no balance or grace, but she knew the skills and moves. Toni had to knock her off her feet before she could attack.
Basically Steve is adorbs I love him, Toni has a new name and tries to fight everyone both verbally and physically, also you can skip parts of this if you've seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier if you haven't go do that it's a terrific movie
“Yeah. It’s for you. The grip twists with you, and pulls a little so it doesn’t whack your hand so much.”
“I was gonna wait until Steele shows up, then I can get a good look at her and I’ll have a good excuse to be in the hallways.”
Toni searches the room, no one reacts for a moment and Toni wonders if they’ll just kill anyone who raises their hand.
“I’m not going to die here. Not like Tania, or Nika, or all the other girls.” Eva said as she held Toni’s legs down with her legs, and tried to wrestle the gun from her hand. She considered letting go for a moment. Giving Eva the gun and surrendering.
“Sobol. Orlov. You will go first.” Toni swallowed hard and tried not to look at Katya Orlov, but out of her peripheral vision she could the girl standing there. Her eyes were wide, and her shoulders tensed. Toni would win this fight, and everyone here thought the loser would be eliminated.
“A little lonely is all.” She gestures to the rest of the bar, almost entirely empty, “Not much company.”
Lara begins to wail and plead. Tears are running down her face in seconds, and she flung her body forwards and backwards with each wail.
But bringing up theories on how and why she’d killed Katya and sometimes even Nika were the best ways.
“Excuse me Madame, but I think Sobol has cheated.” Eva stepped forward suddenly, “She didn’t kill Mila, and she stole my gun from me. The rules didn’t say she could do that.”
Whew thats 13, I hope you realize the pain and suffering I went through for this, and drop a like or comment. It's been a thirteen day process of posting these and I look forward to hearing your reactions!
The automated beep the little robot makes, startles Toni, and when his hand thing moves up and down Toni wants to cry.
Natasha tenses and starts to dive behind one of the cars they hit in the crash that had been abandoned, Sam starts gets the falcon suit ready, and Steve prepares to charge him and draw his fire. All three are cut off when the woman leaps from the ground to the soldier.
The teacher usually took their side, because they had more numbers, and asked Antoinette to sit with her for the rest of recess. She didn’t mind really, because it was more fun than sitting alone, but the taunts they sent her on the way back to the classroom when the teacher wasn’t looking, made her blood boil. Antoinette didn’t really know why she followed this routine, the definition of insanity was repeating the same action over and over and expecting a different result, so maybe she was insane. They never relented, they never let her play, they never even considered taking pity on her. But she continued her path every recess.
She got out though, fighting tooth and nail to make sure she and Yinsen, made it out alive. Of course, he had to sacrifice himself though, and she couldn’t stop him.
No one can pick her up, not even her nanny, so a teacher's assistant drives her, she doesn’t live far. They don’t say anything to her in the car, the silently drop her off, and walk her to the door, a maid answers and she walks in, the assistant is gone by the time she turns around. Mother already knew she’d been expelled, so she stood in the archway waiting. Mother didn’t come around, so Antoinette walked over to the wing were Mother and Father slept. The hall was long and there were identical doors on either side, one went to Mothers room, and the other went to Father's, she walked slowly and quietly as to not bother Father side and was about to knock on the door when Father’s door swung open. Her nanny, Francesca stood in the doorway, retying the belt of her wrap dress. “Antoinette!” she exclaimed, almost nervously, “What are you doing kiddo?”
Tera paused, “Toni that only leaves, pregnant. Who’s the last person you had sex with and did you wear protection?”
“That was actually pretty impressive.” Toni turned around to a tall brunette guy behind her, playfully smirking, “Bet you can’t double it.”
Looking back on things Lucie said, everything fit together like a puzzle piece, she told Toni how the school they were at was different, even though she was being bullied and teased, it was for different things. Previously, Toni assumed, she’d been teased for being weak and fragile and hollow, because she was always sick. Now they were teasing her for being rich, but they were after Toni too so she didn’t feel alone.
His heart pounds straight to his head but he hardly feels it, all he can think about is running as fast as he can after the shooter. Every time he gets the guy in his sights he seems to disappear.
The rest of the year Nika comes to her in her dreams, sometimes sad, usually angry. She never touches her, but the screams are enough to torture her every night. Her absence is quickly discovered, but Toni won’t tell them what happened.
“Do you think our line of work values sportsmanship?” Madame says, she walks towards Eva slowly, her lips are still smiling but now they’ve gotten thinner. She brushes her finger across Eva’s forehead and runs it through the first strand of hair framing her face, “And what, pray tell, gave you the idea I cared at all about what you think?”
Sasha sat down on her bed, “Right? Those kinda girls just enroll here last minute, meanwhile I’ve been working in a scholarship to go here since first grade!” Sasha motioned for Toni to sit next to her.
An unlikely sight. The two hated each other. Madame was near them, all waiting, so she quickly walked up the steps and met them.
She realizes that the fire had blown all night, towards her. She was covered in a thick layer of soot from her torso to her neck.
But out of the library it was all out there was no mercy, Sasha had her friends who made a chorus of sneers and cackles whenever Sasha spoke, and Toni had only herself to defend. She held her own most days but sometimes when Sasha and Co. cornered her in the stairwell she gave in and silently took their abuse before turning away and walking back to her dorm.
He didn’t appreciate her lack of fear and sent her on an impossible list of chores. But she had the backing of the KGB to help her complete them, and he couldn’t help but be impressed.
But at what cost? Prolonging her death? She’d be tortured, maybe spill some information, she couldn’t decide, because she didn’t even know their organization.
“Antoinette, it’s time for supper, come along.” She held out her hand, and Antoinette stared at it for a moment, looked to Francesca, and went with her mother to the dining room table.
Eva slides beside her, Toni ignores. Sometimes she does this at lunch. It’s probably the most annoying timing.
The second guy is on the roof with a pistol, he shoots a few rounds at the knocking Steve out of his shock. Before he can try again the metal man jumps off the building, and when Steve makes it to the ledge he’s nowhere to be found.
It was quiet, but Toni could see again, she felt her hand tremble a little, but it still wouldn’t move for her, “Her eyesight is coming back, pupils are equal and responsive.”
“Six...no eight.” Toni turned back to the dresses to get one last look at them but was simply shoved a bundle of clothing. “Number seven, between six and eight. That’s your choice.”
Her mother room moved farther and farther away as the years went by, no longer did Maria sit across the hall as Howard screwed young women, she moved up two stories and about as diagonal from the cave of testosterone as she could, and Toni didn’t blame her. It smelled like cigarettes and sex.
She realized her mistake the moment the words left her mouth, but Madame’s lips curled in the way they always did when she thought something was funny, “Oh darling, you haven’t even started.”
Toni’s heart is racing, she can’t sit up and she can’t talk but she doesn’t want this, she needs this baby to live.
“What about your friend here?” Pierce gestures to Toni, and she tries to keep her face blank, “I assume you two didn’t meet at book club.”
“Are you ready for tomorrow Sobol?” One says, “I’ve been looking forward to kicking your ass for a while now.”
-Koila Nailatikau was the first daughter of Fiji and later became the first wife, she was kidnapped during a coup against her dad but survived.
The dark winding road lulled Toni to sleep for the very last time. It was a weightless sleep that filtered dreams in and out, none of them mattered though, all she could feel was calmness. It’s only fitting she was woken sharply, by the screech of metal against metal, followed by a crash. The car was firmly wedged into the highway side rail.
She took a long time to write, but we got there! Really excited for the next chapter, and it has a pretty large time jump and will be from Steve's pov, so don't be confused!
“You think I don’t know that?” She replied, “Years of these taunts, and you never broke, never sunk to their level. You were my example to others. Why now?”
When Madame doesn’t respond, she continues blabbering, “She’ll be the best candidate in our class, in our whole school!”
It's cramped and cold, Amanda’s trying to talk to the guards, but Steve can’t ignore Nat’s erratic breathing,
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“Steve please.” It’s the first time she really heard him speak, there was no sound in the stage because they’d had so little time to set it up they couldn’t even bug it.
Toni really didn’t think she was pregnant. She really didn’t. But two dozen positive pregnancy test highly suggested otherwise, and a visit to her doctors confirmed it. They placed the date of conception the week of the previous christmas.
“I went there once with my aunt. Got lunch, then she had an emergency and had to bring me to this big white room. I sat outside with my book, The Velveteen Rabbit, she argued with them for a little while and then we got ice cream.”
“Well, all but two of the Comando’s passed away, Peggy’s in a nursing home, and Howard died in a car accident in 1993 with his whole… family.” Steve pauses,
It’s a days walk to the mansion but she makes it. Only running into Eva once, but carefully avoids her by ducking under cover.
“I paid off the doctors and the press. If someone dug into my records, they’d find out about the pregnancy.”
No one talks for the rest of the night, and Toni barely sleeps. Everytime her eyes close a little, she gets flashes of nightmares.
“I don’t know what’s true.” Toni says, her head hurts trying to remember. All she can see are flashes of a life she lost, that feel more like dreams. “They did something to me.”
“Ever since I got myself expelled, Maria and Howard decided it was best not to spend money on a school environment until I was mature enough to handle it, so I’ve been homeschooled. But this year since I only have two years on highschool left, and Maria is leaving for a tour across the states with “Mothers of America” I’m going to convince Howard to let me go back to school. Where are you going?”
“Yeah, you are. You’ve been redeemed. You can move on.” She pauses looking towards the papers, “I never can.”
“We managed to save you, thank goodness, your sister Ursula was less fortunate.” She gestured behind her, where two men in black suits wheeled away a gurney covered with a grey cloth, presumably carrying her sister.
-Had to come to terms with the fact I couldn’t rewatch the entire movie to get all these scenes correct. If you’re reading this, you probably watched the movie, so I tried to stick to scenes that would be changed by Toni’s presence.
Toni wishes she’d been wrong. She wishes Sasha could have looked over the two weeks they spent together, and realized their friendship isn't superficial and over looked her family history.
Sorry this took literal years to write, I think I rewrote it at least twice. Working on the next one now and it should be done soon.
Toni taps the counter of the bar and regrets it immediately. It probably hasn’t been washed in the last ten years, and she can feel the sticky residue on her fingertips. She ignores it, and continues, “One more for me, and another for my friend here.”
She hissed, even though the bruises on her neck and hands faded, she still hated being touched there. Without thinking, she slammed Eva’s head against her knee.
“You’re gonna laugh at me.” Toni groaned, and Tera didn’t deny it, “Ronnie Richards. Reed Richards’ son.”
“What do you mean?” Eva said the wind must’ve been knocked out of her since her voice sounded so hoarse.
The dramatic reading of Toni and Lucie’s emails blindsided Toni. She had to admit, it made them look very much in love, but Toni wasn’t sure how she felt about that word. She told Lucie she loved her, but she didn’t know what love was.
Toni wakes up with a shudder, it’s way too cold in the room. Too white and too cold. She tried to sit up, but her stomach burned. Her face shattered as she laid her hand on her stomach through the thin hospital gown.
Not that Toni asked, she didn’t want to know. Cancer, brain tumor, kidney problems, heart failure, whatever it was. Toni would research it, find out current treatment methods, point out their flaws, fix them, and once she had a better process of treatment she would realize that she’s still too late. Maybe one day she’ll look up cause of death but right now Toni was doing her best not to die of a broken heart.
Some girls saw Antoinette coming, and tapped their friends or rolled their eyes, when she asked, “Can I play?”
“That’s what they all think.” Toni wants to probe what she means but she’s out the door and soon out of the apartment too quick.
“I don’t remember much of it honestly, I barely got out the door, my butler had to find me a dress.”
He bled out in his apartment that night, all signs pointed to a break-in. Toni read about it in the newspaper two days later.
“We couldn’t save both of you, you were losing so much blood, and there was already damage to the fetus.”
“Listen you low rent whore, just because your life is shitty doesn’t mean you get to make everyone else’s life shitty. Go take your daddy issues back to the trailer park because we’re tired of hearing you bitch and moan about your ‘struggle’ next time your attempt assault, I’ll call the dean and we’ll see exactly how far your scholarship gets you in juvie.”
“No.” Toni sighed, she set the wet shirt on a nearby rock, and tucked the pistol back into her pants.
The bartender emerges again from the back, with a shotgun, but Toni waves him away, “It’s ok Steve, I’ve got this. Just cuff her.”
A body was waiting there, burnt to a crisp, unrecognizable. But the same height and weight as Toni. She’d flee, leaving the corpse, and some manservant who wouldn’t want to admit his failure. The Red Room would be alerted of her failure and subsequent death.
Captain Rogers is what Howard always called him, Captain America was too formal, they were supposedly best buds, but Steve or Rogers wasn’t respectful.
She fell to the ground in shock, and he said nothing, eventually leaving. Maria, who was now back at home, found Toni on the ground, and for the first time in ten or so years, gently picked her up, helped her to the bathroom, and gently applied concealer to her cheek. Before placing a light blue pill on the counter.
Her grades were optimal, she was first in class, maybe because she wasn’t busy with anything other than studying, or maybe because she was just smart.
The ride there is long and boring, she doubts the pilot wants to talk, so she leaves the small room, closing the duffle bag and her school uniform inside, and sits in the only passenger seat in the back.
Madame smiled quietly, “It’s a curious thing. Light pressure to the wound would allow time for the blood to clot.”
“At least we did it together, right?” She murmured, but she saw the look on his face and knew he’d heard her, “Together. Except the people who got killed.”
“If I remember correctly, you were about to blow my head off two minutes ago, so I don’t feel too bad about being cruel.” She poked the back of Eva’s head again, “Stand.”
She had tears in her eyes as he unbuckled his belt, and they slid down her face when he grabbed her jaw and squeezed till she couldn’t stand but open her mouth. He was ruthless selfish, and dirty, and she was choking on her own vomit, that rose from her throat.
She put up with the low level agents telling her she couldn’t be there for about two minutes before she realized they didn’t even know why she was there. “I need to see Agent Coulson, or someone who knows what the fuck is going on.”
Toni approaches the door hesitantly, but opens it in one pull, the rush of the rising sun blinds her as she looks at the huge backyard of the Red Room.
“You’ll all be dropped in the middle, and sent in different directions. When you hear the horn for the first time, you’ll run, the second time means the game begins. Run back to the mansion when it’s one of you is dead.”
It was quick work placing the bugs through the room, mostly on the underside of window sills and tables. She popped a few behind the bed frame, and one behind the toilet. She hoped no one was tasked with constantly listening to these bugs.
Tania laughed, “We’d last two days in an apartment together,” she’s joking, but her breath hitches on every word and Toni know she close,
So the first fifteen minutes of the party are spent scouting out Lucie, she doesn’t know how she missed this in their emails. She’ll have to be more descriptive next time and they can make plans to meet up.
He expects Sam to turn him and Natasha away. Hell, he expects Natasha to ditch him the first chance she gets. He might if he could.
The way out of the hotel was quicker and darker, they took staircases and side hallways. A black car was waiting in the alley, and Toni turned to the woman to say thank you and goodbye, but she stood down the hallway.
This is what she loved about Lucie. She didn’t judge or assume, maybe because she was in a similar position, or maybe that’s just how Lucie was.
“Yes I’m aware, he’s official stealing something I spent millions of dollars to discover.” Ok, maybe she cared a little.
A heavy weight settled in Toni’s stomach, and she silent listened to her new friends theorize about how awful the next three years would be if they had to talk to or even look at Lucette Steele or Antoinette Stark for hours.
The sun has risen more since she got on the chopper, and the sights are beautiful. She can’t focus on them too long, as her mind is racing.
Toni stood up, “No. I’m not. That’s the point. We’re all completely and utterly fucked. But it’s not our fault. They made us like this.”
“I was seventeen. Lucie had just died, I was fucking anything that moved and I messed up my pill, so I took a vacation and have been trying to drink myself to death for about two years.”
He turns sharply, but the second guy is gone too. He’s alone on the roof, out of breath with nothing to show for it.
She sits with Tania at lunch. Not next to her, of course, but there’s only so many tables, so each untouchable can’t have their own.
“I don’t know, sounds like something someone with a shrine would say,” Steve replied, as he started to get up. He gave her a hand and they both paused, nodding a quick goodbye, and went down the hall.
The nearest exit was only two hallways down, they’d been told that every door had an Instructor ready to end the trial. The look on the Instructor who opened the doors face was priceless, only hours ago, Toni had been sent in unarmed, to die, and now she had her would be killer at the wrong end of an AK-47. She’d feel proud if there wasn’t a lump in her throat every time she remembered Mila’s body lying in the hallway.
“Leave.” She said back, she didn’t think her whisper would carry in the wind, but they responded, “The wizard was very clear in emphasizing how it important it was you stayed alive, so I cannot.”
She was inches away from hitting record, when a wash of gold light filtered across her hand and the armor. She lifted her hands to her face, before she found the source of the light.
“Madame,” Toni said, she felt like her whole body was shaking, but her hands and voice were firm. “Am I done now?”
It was only a few minutes till the Instructors appeared at the door, she suspected a camera was hidden somewhere, but maybe they’d heard gunshots.
“I’m on the pill.” She replied, despite the fact her plane to new york from LA had messed up her whole schedule, she had total trust in the magic of modern contraceptive medicine.
Toni doesn’t get off the ground for ten minutes after the last shot though, Tania lies near her a few feet back, but they’re both silent.
As if on cue, they step towards each other a mad fury of limbs, Steve doesn’t think he could join in, and he doesn’t think he wants to.
He called Maria, and asked if she had anything to say on the matter, she had a lot to say on the matter, and when they hung up, he went and did the opposite of what she told him to do. So Toni was enrolled in eleventh grade at Pittsford High School for the fall of 1999.
Servants clean up dinner quickly after that, Mother stayed at the table, Antoinette did too, she hadn’t been excused yet.
New being a relative term. He’d lived there for months, but spent half the time living in SHIELD barracks instead. They were usually closer, more convenient. Plus he felt more like he was just away from home when he slept in the dull grey room.
Ironically, Sasha wouldn’t have gotten revenge if Toni hadn’t gotten revenge, and Toni could later appreciate the humor in the situation, but it took a few years.
With every assassination she committed, she spent less and less time at the apartment. And she wants to scream at someone, to take all her frustration out of the people responsible.
