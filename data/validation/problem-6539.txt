In all reality, Wade thought as he looked around the little cabin, if someone wanted to find them bad enough they could. He looked to where Peter was laying, curled up on the couch and fast asleep... He couldn't keep Peter here any longer, but he couldn't go back with him anymore. Not like he wanted to. He needed to finish his mission, but he didn't have it in him to kill Peter. Not now... So he settled for doing what he could.
He brushed his thumb over the red and blue accents by the sole of the shoe before lunging up and hugging Wade tightly. Wade laughed before kissing Peter's head through his mask and rubbing his back. Peter made it a point to put the shoe back into the box the same as he found it. After Peter composed himself, Steve handed out the next round of gifts.
A look of realization came across Peter's face as it suddenly dawned on him what it was that Rumlow wanted from him right now. He wanted Peter to trade sexual acts and self-mutilation for a tiny sliver of human treatment? If he didn't take it, the punishment would be bad, he was sure... So wordlessly, he slid out of his chair and onto his fragile, bony knees.
Peter checked over his web-slingers just as he was struck by the realization that his suit was not bulletproof like Tony's was. He didn't have a metal arm like Bucky, or a shield like Steve. Even Sam had his wings.
Steve followed Bucky, just like he always had. Except for this time he was much farther back than he'd ever been before. To tell the truth, he was afraid, not for himself, but for Bucky. He saw what Bucky'd been doing, and God only knows how long he'd been doing it before Steve showed up.
"No baby, you're safe. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you. I've got you now." He kissed Peter on the head again. Peter calmly curled up to Wade's chest and let himself be held, fully aware that Wade had a hand wrapped around the handle of a gun beneath his pillow.
When he tunes back into the conversation, Nat's talking to him about some girl named MJ that he used to hang out with and how she'd love to come and see him, and how Ned would too, and she even asked him if he'd be excited to go back to school in a couple of months. He didn't answer. He didn't remember the people she was talking about, despite knowing they were probably once
"Oh no, I fucked something up, didn't I? Did I forget anything? I know there's no concealer or anything, I wasn't sure how to do the color match without you being around, I'm sorry. Do I need to go pick something else up? Do I need to take something back?"
There was a flash of memory in his mind of the last few seconds that he saw Peter before he left. When the boy had spoken to him in the Soldier's tongue. His tongue.
Without another word, Tony made for the teen's bedroom. Despite the sound-proof walls, Tony knew Peter was upset. Just as Tony was about to knock, Friday spoke in a hushed voice. "Mr. Stark, I find it imperative to warn you that Mr. Parker has just fallen asleep."
He knew it wouldn't take much to rip the fragile teen into shreds of the person that he is now. Wade could lead Peter on and with a few simple words, he could crush everything that Peter had inside of himself and break his little heart into pieces. It would make him vulnerable, it could get him hurt, or killed.
The boy in question gripped tighter onto Bucky and cried harder. "They never stop!" Was what he managed through his tears. Everyone automatically assumed it to be the bullies that have plagued Peter's life as of late, and he told them that they were getting so bad he couldn't even focus on patrol anymore.
That's why he trusted his own doctors to do what they could for Peter and keep their mouths shut about this random child that Tony Stark was wandering around with all of a sudden. He trusted them not to breathe a word of Peter or his injuries to anyone.
The man then sighed. "I want you to burn your elbow, Parker. I don't care which one, but I want it done
Peter was being very defensive, not just of himself, but of the scarred and unresponsive Deadpool that he refused to leave without. When they tried to lead him out, he fought and protested that he wouldn't leave without the man that was helping him escape, even if he didn't remember who he was.
From the way Peter looked at their hands, Wade thought he might feel it too. Peter did feel it, and he felt his spidey-senses telling him that Wade was a bad idea, but for just one moment, he didn't care. He was hurt and sad and scared and he just wanted it all to go away and if it meant using Wade then so be it.
Peter's voice cracked slightly. "And the fire was so hot... I got burned... Sometimes... Sometimes I can still feel it. Feel the flames on my skin, and it burns so bad..." Peter's fingers trailed absentmindedly over his collarbones where the scarred skin was.
He struggled as more arms wrap around him, and he felt a sting in his neck. A familiar voice said, "Don't you worry now, everything will be just fine..."
Peter heard footsteps, and he saw Wade standing behind the girl, and the footsteps grew louder and louder, and he felt hands on his body, and he could hear someone calling his name.
Bucky lifted Tony up farther and listened to the pained attempts at air and the weak, scared whimpers... Then the door opened, and standing there was Steve, with Natalia and Bruce behind him. So Friday had alerted someone. That someone just so happened to be the one person in the world that Bucky would listen to while he was like this.
Bucky rose his gaze from the floor and let it settle on the men in front of him. He quickly glanced at Natasha who just shook her head. They weren't going to interfere. If Tony and Steve were going to be at each other's throats then so be it.
Peter was a little more intoxicated than he should be, especially since he'd never drank before tonight. Peter was really good on rules and laws, especially underage drinking, but there were a lot of bad influences here.
Peter awoke in the hospital to a reminder going off on his mostly undamaged cell phone. The cracked screen told him that his Hydra escape was just a little over two months ago, a fact that he couldn't even focus on because not only did he feel sick, but because he heard the voice of a woman that wasn't Nat.
Once two in the morning rolled around, and Peter had been yawning off and on for nearly three hours, Wade put his phone down on the arm of the couch and sighed. "Petey, honey, I think it's time for bed."
She insisted that she didn't really know, but if they were letting him see this guy, then he must not be so bad after all. Peter took that thought and held it close. He didn't want to think Wade was a bad guy. He remembers watching the Avengers dragging him into the base, and he remembers that he wasn't fighting. He was barely even being restrained... But everyone was so badly injured, someone had to do it.
The second thing he was made aware of was the fact that it was pitch black and that he was no longer chained to a table, but instead closed inside of what seemed to be a box. He extended his arms as far as he could, his breathing already picking up. The box he was in was no bigger than a small refrigerator box.
Grabbing onto the handle of the metal door, he yanked with all of the strength that he could manage and pulled the door off of the hinges, effectively rendering the locks on the inside as useless as the people. He heard yelling in the Soldier's native tongue and then screaming the moment he came through the door.
He was shaking and every time Steve got too close, he was physically pushed away. And when Steve saw the calendar he realized why Bucky was having this outburst. He remembered this date from Bucky's S.H.I.E.L.D. file and from his Hydra file... Today was December 16th. 27 years ago today, The Winter Soldier killed Howard and Maria Stark.
He pulled out a hair dryer, flat iron, and curling iron, and the fact that the curling iron didn't match the others didn't matter because Peter had seen these on the website and knew what they cost.
Feeling like he might be nearby somewhere, she called out, "So, how did you get us out of the alleyway without being seen?"
"Why do you think I did something to him?" Wade asked as he brushed Peter's hair out of his face. He could feel Peter's pulse beating steadily at his temple.
Peter didn't miss the way the man's grip on his gun relaxed, or the way that the man pulled him closer. The metal-armed man stood in the corner, chuckling as he watched the scene before him.
Peter watched her as she walked into the bathroom and came back out. She handed him a plastic package with a soft sigh. "It should work... The instructions are on the sink."
Wade took the hint and tugged, not missing the way Peter's jaw went slack. Wade took advantage of that and used the grip on Peter's hair to push his head down. Peter moaned, like it was the best thing that'd ever happened to him and doubled his efforts of pleasing Wade.
"It's important, think of the people you love, can you trust them? If your life was on the line, would you trust them to save you?"
That made Tony hurt, and that's exactly what Bucky wanted. He wanted Tony to hurt right now for those things he said to Peter.
"Nah, I don't think I made it into much of that..." Bucky knew what this was. It was flattery, being used in a way to distract from one of his earlier questions. Bucky knew the signs, he was no idiot. This man had a secret, and that was dangerous. He made easy work of changing the subject to something else, a common factor.
Peter was basically crying tears of pleasure at this point, letting out little whines and cries at each of Wade's thrusts. Wade nearly matched each sound.
Steve nods, and they make their way back to Brooklyn. It's been a very long time since Steve straight up killed anyone, but he supposes it's never too late to start giving these Hydra assholes what they deserve.
They were the only ones to look at him any differently, which was good. He could handle Flash being a dick, and he could handle Ned being... Ned. He could handle getting shoved into a locker and he could handle getting a sandwich at the newly rebuilt Delmar's after school.
Peter shook all thoughts from his mind. The last thing he needed to think about was Tony fucking Stark. He doubted Tony was actually looking for him, to begin with. He probably had Friday running all the scenarios and diagnostics and statistics on everything. Friday was probably pinging his cell and calculating the percentage of Peter coming home safely. It was likely that all Tony was doing is telling Friday to look for Peter.
He sighed and rubbed his thumb across the barrel of his gun. "You sure do have a big mouth... I'm getting kinda tired of listening to you talk, but you're the only company for the time being so... I'm gonna regret this."
Wade reached for Peter, who backed away and crawled onto the bed to stay out of the merc's reach. He didn't want to be touched, he wanted answers. He wanted to know what'd happened to him and who'd done it and why. "And I don't want any of your excuses, Wade, I want the truth!"
Tony unzipped Steve's jeans and pulled out his hefty length, wasting no time in leaning down and wrapping his lips around it. Steve reached a hand down and threaded his finger's through Tony's hair the way he knew Tony liked and gave the ends a little tug.
Absentmindedly, Peter nodded. He was trying to imagine the stars at night and all the planets and the moon through his telescope.
He carded his fingers through Bucky's hair and sighed as he looked to Nat. She looked stressed and worried all at once. She looked like she needed a strong drink and a nap, but instead, she settled for grabbing a book and sitting at Steve's feet so he could play with her hair too.
"He's a spy... It won't take him long to figure out your game. You're going to have to be a really good actor, паук." That last word, spider, was the first word out of his hallucination's mouth that didn't sound like a monotone recording. Was he remembering? He didn't think so. Every day he strayed farther from whoever he used to be, but this was a tactic taught to him by Natasha, not that he remembered her.
Steve was silent, mentally making plans to wipe out every last HYDRA scum even if it meant dying in the process. He knew they wouldn't ever be free of this pain caused by those, as Peter said, snakes until Steve got rid of every last one of them.
Wade... Would live on without him. And that thought alone is enough to scare Peter into silence. The only sound that fills the air between them is the sizzling from the stove.
Wade could feel Peter's arousal through his thin sweatpants and decided to take advantage of it by flipping them over and pinning Peter to the bed. He kissed down Peter's chest, slowly, teasingly. Peter wasn't in the mood to be teased like this, and he flipped Wade back over. Wade's eyes were wide and full of lust as Peter started working on getting wade out of his jeans.
After the black eye incident, Peter's parents took to driving him to school. The day Bucky gave Peter a ride was the first time Peter'd been left alone in weeks. Bucky drove him to school on Steve's motorcycle and just 'happened' to be wearing a sleeveless shirt. Bucky was the most threatening looking of all of Peter's parents. Everyone knew Tony was rich, and if they wanted their projects funded they needed to chill the hell out.
"I know who you are, and you know who I am. And I know that you know where I am. I want you to come here, and I need to know what you've done to my son."
And Peter did his very best to hold back his tears as he stood next to Okoye as Bucky boarded the jet out of Wakanda, and he tried so hard but the moment the doors closed and Okoye was touching his shoulder all kind and gentle like, he was bursting into tears. And he felt weak but he'd spent so much time apart from his family, and he was the last of his bloodline for the time being and the rest of his new family was so far away and it all just
Before them was the man they'd plucked from a ravine and picked for a project he never knew existed. They tormented him, sawed off what was left of his arm and attached a brand new titanium one. They took him away from whatever second chance at life he could have had after the war and turned him into a machine, a weapon.
Bucky nodded. He understood. "Okay. Okay, I'll help you. I'll be right here every step of the way, Peter."
that didn't even have any birth parents. They hadn't told him, and he didn't remember, but it wasn't hard to figure it out. He didn't look anything like these people and they were way too old to really be his parents anyways. Everybody knew who Steve Rogers was... Well, they knew who Captain America was.
This thug is feeble at best. “Be frightened, blah, blah, blah, you are worth a lot to us so don’t try anything, blah, blah, blah.” He’s clearly not their A-team, I mean he put the key ring in his pocket after opening the door and walking in the room. Tony’s sure he’ll be able to get out just by catching him off guard and knocking him out. No need to engineer a siege engine or a bomb with whatever is at hand, which is good because Tony can’t afford to blow this joint sky-high until he has Steve out and safe. Oh, and he has to suffer this goon’s manifest stupidity, at least until he lets slip what they’ve done with Steve.
When goons are all into their self-aggrandizing thing it’s not hard to catch them off guard. Tony hits him square in the jaw. The guy flies back into the door hard. On his way down to the floor, his head clips the doorknob, knocking him out neatly. Good thing Steve, the best strawweight boxer in Brooklyn during his high school years, taught Tony to land a punch. His hand will be feeling that one for days, but it’s worth it ‘cause it did the job.
Tony looked slightly worried. "I could have helped you, made sure you got a good deal out it. I could have spared you the agency fees."
That's the thing with Stark. He may be a freaking genius capable of creating new elements and crazy apocalyptic AI but he's completely oblivious to whatever is in front of him. He has always been, sadly. He's probably never realized just how strong he is. He's never realized that a whole pack has formed under his protective aura, despite himself. He's never realized he met his soul mate. He's completely oblivious and hasn't got a clue. It's infuriating.
Tony's eyes flashed with confusion. His smile had faded to leave place to a curious and questioning pout. Then he chuckled mirthlessly while looking away.
to make it alright. He reached a hand out but Tony recoiled and stepped back, leaning against the workbench behind him, putting the mug away. Steve wasn't sure what kind of face he was making but Tony averted his eyes and made a painful grimace at the sight of him. Steve felt the tears come back.
—for tonight." Natasha took the bottle with a confused smile. She put the bottle away while Tony held a huge bouquet in her direction. "And this is for
Tony smiled and grabbed his pack of cigarette to smash it in his hand in a silent agreement. He chuckled. "I'll try..." He finally said in reply and Steve muffled his words into a long passionate kiss, both hands holding his face preciously.
Tony shivers at the touch. It's just a slight brush but he almost gasps, overwhelmed by the blissed fluttering in his chest. He knows Steve's lips are going to brush over his jawline and plant a delicate morning kiss there, igniting every cell in his body. He
"What's the E for?" Steve asked, needing to take control of that conversation again, he usually had it. That was probably the one thing he was pretty good at: mouthing off. Tony guy impressed him though, more than he would admit, more than he could ever accept.
Steve dropped his jaw in puzzlement and then felt a slightly angry feeling creeping up his chest. He ground his teeth and frowned at his boyfriend.
Steve turned to him and their eyes locked into each other. Steve chuckled and gave his boyfriend a little tap on the chest. "Asshole." He muttered affectionately. They stared at each other for a long moment, reading each other's thoughts silently, seeing in their eyes how much they loved each other until Tony's shuttered closed and he leant into Steve, grabbing his neck to give him another languorous kiss, moaning and breathing heavily into his mouth.
Tony laughed. "Why are you so angry?" He asked innocently. He knew, though, very well, how Steve would react to his impromptu visit. "Surely you didn't think I wouldn't jump on the first opportunity I had to visit your workplace... I've wanted to come here for
Sam rolled his laughing eyes and shook his head softly before a huge, vicious grin spread on his face. "You. And the new boy." He made a salacious gesture with the fingers of both his hands that Steve shall not comment on. "And all the staring. What the fuck? Have you known each other in another life or what?"
Steve startled and fell silent for a short moment. This was the first time that Tony used that word, to refer to himself. The first time he acknowledged, out loud, what had happened to him. That was a huge fucking step for him and Steve felt so moved for a while. He brought his hand to Tony's, the bandaged one, and rubbed it softly, making sure he would not to hurt him.
No, he hates Loki, it's a fact. And why is it him, of all people, who opens the door to them anyway? Who does that? Welcoming guests in other people's house... And why is he already here? They're not even late for once.
He walked inside and put the cool box with their lunch on the kitchen counter. Tony followed behind and dropped on the floor the pile of folded cardboard boxes he had been carrying while huffing out a relieved sigh and catching his breath. The perks of having a much stronger boyfriend Steve thought amusedly. In a moment of weakness, Steve took pity on him and strode to him to give him a thankful peck on the lips. Tony's lips were wet with sweat and curled into a tired smile when they touched Steve's.
“Don’t ask, Cap. I’m not the kind of guy to kiss and tell,” Stark says, his eyes glinting mischievously.
Steve looked up from his fumbling with the remote with a familiar crooked half-smile that Tony definitely did not look at. Instead, he fixed his eyes on Steve’s perfect, almost Grecian in form nose, and willed away the flush that was steadily rising up his neck.
“You know usually, that sentence would definitely not disgust me,” Steve replied after managing to swallow his load of meat on cheesy bread. “But this middle-aged lawyer John Smith sounds like a real swell guy.”
His dad ruffles his hair with a soft laugh and stands up again, heading into the living room to presumably put the books away. Peter watches him leave with a wide grin on his face, thinking about how his dad has done such a good job at fixing their broken life.
Steve jerked forward and kicked the door open, thrusting forward with the shield entering before the rest of him. He heard Tony step inside after him, the hiss of pneumatics as the armour’s joints moved almost muffled by the densely falling snow that had begun to descend thickly as they had been standing in front of the door.
“Sure, sweetheart. You’re feisty, aren’t you,” he asked, barrelling on before Tony can respond. “I like that. I like that a lot.”
The doctor laughs. “Hello, Steve. We’re from Network America. Your son called us for advice on how to find you a new wife.”
He wasn’t surprised at all when he heard the sound of soft footfalls and Steve soon appeared looking just as exhausted and ragged as Tony figured he must look like.
She looked away, reaching out to toy with the edge of one of the burgers that had once been the only thing between Bruce’s Whopper and shame.
“I’m trying, Buck. I really am,” he promised, wondering if one day he’d actually be able to convincingly make that promise to himself.
Peter’s eyes follow them until they make it to the other side of the street. The light turns green and they start moving again.
“You are finding me those reports, and we are sending them to Fury tonight, or so help me-” The rest of her words are cut off by a series of yelps from Clint as she hauls him out of the room.
The island itself was similarly made of wood, with cylindrical pieces of wood stacked upright next to each other to form the base, and a large polished slab to make up the surface settled on top of them. Above the kitchen island, were two dome lights that flared outward towards the surface of the island, and hanging from a thin black chain secured at the ceiling.
Back at the apartments, Steve set up the newest season on DVD and sat back on the couch with Tony, arm thrown casually over the back of the couch. Tony shifted a little and tucked his foot underneath himself.
When Wade woke, Peter was curled up to his chest. His hair was a mess and he was snoring and drooling all over himself. With a chuckle, Wade carefully got up and grabbed his shirt from the floor, wiped Peter's chin off, and then made sure he was covered up before going out into the living area of the tiny cabin.
Bucky's been wanting to ask Peter, but he doesn't want to overwhelm the boy. Steve thinks that's okay, they're not in any big rush right now.
Steve's shield bounced off of one of the trucks and swept a woman's legs out from underneath her. Sam kicked a man while he passed through the air. Peter jumped from the ceiling onto one of the trucks. All he could think about is what would happen were one of the boxes of weapons to explode. About how the walls would all cave in around them.
As he looked down at the sleeping boy in his arms, he realized that they might not stay that way after all.
When Wade's eyes moved to Peter's chest... When they trailed over the burns on his otherwise flawless skin... Peter looked down. Wade just kissed over it and started pulling Peter's bottoms off.
The boy was somehow still tired and falling asleep while standing upright between them, so they took him back to bed. It was difficult for the two bigger men trying to fit in the minuscule bed, but they made it work, and when they were comfortable enough, they managed to fit Peter into the bed as well. The blankets trapped the heat and Peter was no longer shivering, and his watch was no longer vibrating.
He unlocked the door and dropped the keys on the table just inside the door before kicking off his shoes. He tossed his bags onto his bed on his way into the bathroom. He washed off his face and paused as he thought he heard shuffling in the other room.
The permission was all that Peter needed before he was crying out again, painting the ground beneath him as Wade filled him up farther.
Peter said that yes, he was kinda getting into it now, and despite some things still missing from his collection, Wade had gone above and beyond to spoil him. Tony nodded, listening intently for a few minutes before speaking.
All of those agents also knew what could happen to them if they were found out as traitors, so none of them so much as dared.
. We're safe here. We're safe with you. In fact, you make me feel twice as safe compared to when I'm here alone. Know why?" He waited for Bucky to shake his head. "Because you're here with me, and I know that you've always got my back no matter what, just like I've always got yours. Okay? Nothing is gonna happen to us. You won't hurt us. We're safe... Bucky,
He did know one thing, and that was from now on, he and Wade were going to use protection. Religiously.
So when Bucky first approached him in the bedroom after he'd become part of the group and told him to kneel, Tony didn't hesitate to drop down onto his knees and shut his mouth. He was quicker then, but since he seems to have forgotten his place.
Steve's stress was slowly leaving his body as he looked after the two of them. He was quick to realize that this was all he needed, just Nat and Bucky. Stark was too complicated to deal with. Buck and Nat were both very straightforward and blunt, never hiding what they wanted. If they wanted it, they told Steve about it and he did what he could for them.
Steve was at work, he'd started a new job that understood that he'd sometimes have to ditch work for Captain America duties on short notice. He'd picked it up because he wanted to provide for his family, without the help of Tony Stark. He wouldn't admit it, but sometimes he felt like a bum letting Tony do all the paying, especially now that they weren't together anymore, and Steve was too prideful to do anything else.
He walked around them and into the kitchen, stealing an apple from the bowl on the counter. He bit into the apple and leaned on the counter in front of him and smiled up at Steve when he passed through the room. "Hey Pops, how was work?"
Steve basically met Bucky in the dead center of the alleyway when he came from the opposite end. Standing in the middle of the alleyway, it was clear that neither Rumlow or Natalia were here, which instantly begged the question,
Wade held a legitimate looking Santa sack full of stuff. He sat it down by the other presents before walking over and giving Peter a tight hug. Peter buried his face into Wade's shoulder, and his sweater smelled like chocolate, gunpowder and cigarette smoke. Somehow it was soothing. He heard Nat's camera click from somewhere in the room but doubted she was focused on them in the slightest. When Peter pulled out of the hug, Nat put her hand on Wade's shoulder and gently urged him to go introduce himself in some kind of non-threatening manner.
Tony decided that from that moment on, he was gonna do whatever it was gonna take to make Peter feel welcome. While Peter slept on his lap, Tony checked the real estate listings, searching everywhere between Brooklyn and Queens. He bookmarked one that he knew would be perfect before returning to messing with Peter's hair.
Bucky shakes his head, strands of long hair falling into his face. "I used to tell Peter stories about the things I remembered. Things from being Him. The tactics I used to use, the places I used to go."
Absently Peter wondered if he'd be able to get tattoos with his healing powers, but as Wade started trying to get Peter out of his sweater, he decided that he didn't care about that right now. All he cared about in this second was having sex with Wade, and maybe that was bad, but if being good meant not feeling good then Peter would rather be bad.
Bruce nods and fiddles with his sleeves as he glances at the door the boy had just been taken through. "Yeah, I did... The anomaly wasn't a malfunction..."
Peter flicked his wrist and suddenly Bruce's arm was webbed to his stomach and the doctor was webbed to the wall. Bruce looked surprised.
Peter sat down on the floor at the back of the group. He didn't expect a whole lot, and that was okay. He had people who loved him and that was enough... Speaking of. Wade plopped down right beside Peter and they automatically leaned together until they were pressed side to side. Peter put his head on Wade's shoulder as Steve handed out the first round of presents.
Peter turned on his heel to run to the basement, and Natasha followed suit. Peter, as he ran, was starting to have flashbacks again.
He remembers a super-soaker fight in the fifth grade. He remembers being given money for school trips, even when money was tight. He remembers being her number one priority... And it was all taken away. He'll never have those things again... She won't ever have those things. Hydra took all that she was. All she could've been... Gone.
And then there was Bucky. He was doing a little of everything. He was going on missions, leading the search, sitting through debriefings and interviews, filling out reports and writing weapons logs. He was keeping all of his own weapons cleaned and his arm well-maintained with the use of Peter's toolbox... Despite how everyone else is doing, they all think he's doing far worse... And they're right. But he would never let them see that.
also now that I've figured out italics I'll be using that instead of just putting words in all caps. also, I think I'll use it to add in flashbacks so maybe in the future, we'll see more of the past.
As long as the focus was on him being the bad guy, then he could make sure to keep the real bad guys out of the way. As soon as someone figured out they had a traitor inside their ranks, it'd be Civil War between them all. God knows that it wouldn't be one against all. They'd each pick sides with each other. There'd be someone that'd side with the traitor, simply because they were friends or lovers. The thought made Wade roll his eyes because even he wouldn't side with someone like that.
"Someone was bound to be hurt anyway, and I'm just glad that it ended up being me and not one of them. They're two valuable members of the team, and like you always say, I'm just a kid." He slid off of the table and put a hand over his stitches. He got close to Tony, just inches away. "If the only thing I can do for this team is take a bullet, then so be it."
"I want to speak with him alone." He said quietly, which earned him a yank on his hair. He didn't make a sound at the pain, just closed his eyes.
He shifted and let his arm slide across the back of Peter's leg, reaching out and easily grabbing hold of Peter's throat. Peter fucking wailed and let his head roll back, fingers loosely gripping Wade's arm.
Truthfully though, if one of his friends had been there, he probably wouldn't have had anything to drink at all and would have never been in this situation in the first place. Wade scratched his brow and sighed. If he'd been here in the first place nothing would have happened either. He chose work over coming to the party, and now the consequences were getting to his head.
If May wasn't here, then where the hell was she? Peter's eyes fell on the broken coffee table and he began to fear that the worst had happened to her. "May?!"
Peter himself was somewhat skeptical, but he couldn't let Bucky's insecurities about this mission transfer to him. He had to stay collected and sane, there was no room for error today. Who knows when they might get another chance like this?
He did spend a lot of time listening though. He listened to Steve and Nat, and he'd listened to them both talk to Tony, but he never made any input. Sure he thought some things, but nowadays Bucky was a man of few words. Even fewer than before... Everything.
The right moment, screw the right moment. This was Steve looking at him with so much love and so much worry that he’d broken something between them by keeping this secret. Screw the romance and the perfect words. Tony had to say it now before he lost the chance again. He reached for the ring miraculously still in his pocket and opened his mouth to speak.
Finally, Mike broke the silence. “As soon as I get you back to the bungalow, you’ll need to pack up, hit the road and get away from Starkesboro as fast as you can. I’ll wait until you go, and follow your car until you’re out of their territory. They won’t touch you with me around, or in my house, and once you are out of their territory they can’t follow you. But first, you must have some questions.”
There was no reason for him to feel so queasy, he was almost swimming in it. He tried to center himself, just get the first words out. “Steve I… Steve?” Because this was not right, Steve looked queasy too. Did he know what was coming? Did he not want Tony to propose? The thought made Tony feel worse. But then Steve listed sideways just as Tony’s vision started to swim, and he knew this was not nerves. Something was very wrong.
He looked Steve, his beautiful, brave, amazing Steve, straight in the eyes and began, “Steve… I … I … “ and then it rushed out of him like the wind all in a single breath, “Iloveyoumorethanlifeitself-willyoumarryme?”
“I promise it’s the only thing I’ve ever kept from you. I’ve wanted to tell you for a while now. I even rehearsed it, over and over in my head how to tell you. But I could just never quite find the right moment to say the words.”
Steve talked Tony round to considering a project that kept the look of the building, and integrated dedicated low-income housing for the building’s residents into the mix. “Considering” -- who was he kidding? Steve cared so much that there was no way Tony could say “no” to him (there still isn’t). He changed course, brought this passionate and talented young architect in on the project. It became something they dreamed up together. And somehow in the process, Steve came to care for Tony too. That was the real surprise. That, yeah, that was everything to Tony.
But that was just too naive of a hope. Because apparently the townsfolk are all werewolves, or at least enough of them to quickly track them down and surround them in the woods. There was no way these were your garden brand of timberwolf wolf. They were way too big, and those glowing red eyes, unmistakable in their intent, were just not natural. They were the same predatory eyes Steve and Tony had felt targeting them when they first came to town and he was pretty sure he recognized that hungry, sharp-toothed grin.
Tony grabbed a stick from the ground as Steve sunk into his fighting stance. They stood together, back to back. They weren’t going down without a fight. The odds were not in their favor in the least, but since when had that ever caused Steven Grant Rogers to back down? Tony was going to stand with Steve, no matter what. He felt the ring, heavy in his pocket, and he started to speak. “Steve, I’m so sorry, it’s all my fault we’re in this mess. In case we don’t make it out of this alive, I want you to at least know that we came here because I was planning to ask you to …”
Together, that was the point of coming here after all, but not in this crazy back-assed way. Just him and Steve, spending time together. It was supposed to be a romantic getaway, to a sweet little New England town.
The meal started out just perfect. Reasonable wine list for Steve and Fever-Tree for Tony. Traditional, sticks to your ribs, cold weather stews and pies with a historical flair. They had Indian pudding on the dessert menu, yum! Even the service was attentive without being in your face.
“I mean, werewolves, I’m a scientist but I’ve seen some pretty weird things in my life. I’ll just add this one to the list of ‘There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,’ stuff and move on, so long as you can tell me Steve is safe and he’ll be okay going forward.”
They make it outside. A quick visual survey shows no phone lines, no vehicles, and no barn or garage. So the woods it is. Whoever brought them here and hooked up Steve to that machine had left them here in the sole charge of the idiot Tony had taken out in the basement; arrogant kidnappers are the best. He and Steve are not waiting around for anyone to come back, thank you very much.
He realizes that he’s in the basement of a huge old house. He can tell by the familiar quality of the cement and the post and stem wiring that suspends a flickering lightbulb overhead, since he grew up in a brownstone mansion himself. He heads for the stairs, listening at the door before he steps out onto what must be the ground floor. Yep, huge creepy old Victorian mansion. Must be out in the woods, because all he can see through the windows is bare trees and that dense, creepy fog. If he could just find Steve, they could disappear into that fog. Not as good as a vehicle, but what are the chances he’ll find a second kidnapper who’s stupid enough to advertise the werabouts of his keys.
Steve mechanically looked at his watch and realized it was way to early for Tony to have left the party. He frowned at him. "Were you following me?"
Steve opened his eyes wide, startled. He stared at Tony's smile, so warm and gentle, which was growing a little insecure. "I—" he stammered, "I don't know how to dance."
Tony would swallow the cum of twenty-three men before he left this place. That was a good, relatively feasible objective, he thought.
intended to get you back and break up your relationship." He husked out nonchalantly, an evil grin spread on his face.
The guy startled. "Okay. Should we go to a hotel then?" That guy was really asking too many questions. Tony was too drunk to care. Faced with too much hesitancy from Tony, the guy asked another disconcerting question. "You still wanna do this, Greg?"
Tony beamed. And Tony Stark flashing a beaming smile at you was not something you could just be indifferent about. Steve's heart started racing and felt suddenly very hot. And believe him, it was
It's terrifying the way they're now connected to each other. They can feel each other's feelings, know each other's thoughts, it's all mingled and yet distinct, but they can't really know each other's thoughts. It's basically a hunch, an intuition but one they know they can trust. It's indescribable.
"And then I got pregnant and I don't know how that happened." Her voice faltered. Her breathing hitched. "It wasn't supposed to work." she said with a high-itched voice. She had tears in her eyes. "I wasn't supposed to—it was a
Finding himself against has been a long and rocky path. Remembering has been arduous, painful and a constant battle with himself. Now he knows who he is, and he also knows where he stands. He is happy for them, really, he is.
"Wait..." He mumbled while reaching a trembling but determined hand to Tony's neck. He tugged on his collar and it was there, discreet, inconspicuous but unmistakable in his state. The soft reddish scent gland of an omega. "You're omega!?!" He choked out, unable to believe his own eyes.
"I hate you guys..." Steve said feeling as hot as if he had eaten spicy chili. Everyone laughed teasingly.
Steve's heart is not in it but he won't let their last moments together turn into a sad and pathetic pity-party. It is their last weekend and Steve fully intends to make the most of it. His mum is on duty all weekend and if Happy drops Tony off tonight only to pick him on Sunday afternoon, no-one else needs to know. They're so lucky Happy and Jarvis approve of them.
He feels his alpha's knot deep in his throat and the omega's cock buried in his ass. He feels how hot and overwhelmed it makes him feel. He feels his knot in his own mouth and his cock his own ass and all the sensations it brings. He can
Steve shrugged. "Don't know... I just... They were offered to me, I think. Probably Clint. Never knew how to use them."
He ditched the jacket, a bit too obvious. He wasn't cold anyway, already tipsy and high on coke. Summer nights were warm, he should be fine. Getting in was easy, despite looking already smashed, cash helped. He made a beeline for the bar and ordered two drinks straight away. The waitress was sexy, a little brunette with tattoos on her face. She looked nasty and glared at him with contempt when he flirted, maybe she was a dyke. The possibility highly turned him on and he fondled the idea a little. A crazy night of sex with her in a shaggy motel room, or in her apartment, really sounded like a nice prospect but she was busy and not particularly responsive—not exactly surprising since Tony had been gross and a tad insensitive—and Tony had no time to waste. He took his drinks and gulped down the first one in one go. Then he clutched the second one in his hands and disappeared through the crowd in his quest for tripping rapture.
"Take care of yourself." Steve specified. "If you know how to fight, then why didn't you?" Steve was sitting now, eyes intent on him, staring defiantly. "Why did you let them treat you like this?"
They both have tears in their eyes and keep looking at each other lovingly. Bucky has tears in his eyes too and feels a burning ache in his neck. He closes the door with the warmth of happiness pooling in his stomach. It is a little overwhelming.
Steve groans out keening whimper. His hands are shaky and his eyes wide open, already hazy with lust. He swallows and starts walking, trying his best to keep a steady walk while his knees are wobbling. Bucky licks at Tony's dick provocatively, to motivate him a little, eyes staring at him amusedly. The blond omega grabs his alpha's neck possessively and pulls him into a filthy kiss. Tony's hand lands on his strong, pretending shoulder and gives it a little push. Just enough to free himself from the omega's grasp. "Get down on your knees now, omega." He growls, eyes feral and dominant.
The alpha shrugged as unnecessary apologies flowed out of his mouth before Steve could react. "I'm so sorry, Steve. I just.. After last night, I really needed to talk to you, to...to explain but I chickened out while in front of your house and—"
Steve gasped and shuddered and felt a tear flow down his cheek slowly at the sudden painful twinge in his heart. He paced quickly to him and wrapped his arms around his waist from behind, nestling his face between his shoulder blades. Tony took his hand in his and fondled the inside of his palm with his thumb. Silent. Loving. And grateful...
Tony startles. "Kids were never an option." He blurts out. "Do you seriously think Steve would want kids?"
Instead he climbed back up the stairs, went to the bathroom to take a long shower and rubbed his body thoroughly, then changed his sheets, emptied his bin, put on some clean clothes and went back to the kitchen. He pushed the door and sat at the table, starving as if he had been fasting for a week. His mum was making pancakes and his heart swelled with gratitude. He joined his hand in a prayer and waited for her to turn around.
As he stared at his drawings powerlessly, he felt a benevolent presence looming over him. A familiar smell, though he was too upset to try finding out who it was. He recognized the voice, however. Instantly. And his heart started racing.
The nice thing about doing it in the men's room was that it wasn't its primary purpose, which meant some of the guys here actually came to pee. Tony enjoyed that a lot. There were a lot of curious, some envious, looks. He hoped those would be a bit more forward though. Tony definitely could take two cocks in his mouth, probably three.
stopped laughing, his uneasy smile faded... because he didn't like the way Steve was seeing him right now. He hated himself through Steve's eyes right now. He felt wrong and dirty—as dirty as he had felt the first time Obie laid his pervy filthy hands on him—in his eyes, like his whole existence was a mistake, like
He didn't know if Tony had noticed the hostility in Sam's not so innocent question but Tony's smile faded and a glimpse of vulnerability crossed his eyes. He wetted his lips and paused, seemingly thinking thoroughly about it, before he answered with a provocative smile.
They kissed again. Hot and urgent and filthy this time. Hungry and touched-starved. It felt like something Steve had missed his whole life. Something he had wanted—
"Now get the fuck out of my car." Obie said curtly, an amused glint in his eyes. "You're still young! Party! Fuck! Have fun!" He almost commanded. "But remember this, Tony boy, always." Tony opened the door while pretending not to listen. Obie wasn't fooled though. When he was out, he glared at him. "You're
Steve is busying himself with his own phone and speaks again, after a short moment. "Clint's inviting us on Friday night."
Tony buried his head into his neck and curled his arms around Steve, Steve tightened his embrace. He felt his boyfriend quiver spasmodically. Tony broke down into his arms and wept silently into the crook of his neck.
Steve finally exclaims, out loud, because he really didn't think Bucky's motivations for him getting off his suppressants was seeing him pregnant.
"Steve?" Steve jerked his head on the side, at the gentle and slightly concerned voice. "You alright?"
Steve startled and looked up into his eyes. He pouted. "I don't know." He admitted rather honestly. "Not really interested in that, actually."
Steve's stance waver at Tony's silence, losing composure as the minutes go by. Tony can feel it, as pure and strong as polished vibranium, the bond that unites both of them.
"What would you say to the fans who believe your entire work is based on your private life and mainly your relationship issues with Tony Stark?"
Very few omegas were open about it. She was and she claimed it. Would Steve be able to do the same if he was?
Tony tore off his shirt and kissed down his neck, biting his skin softly, while his hand slipped into his pants and fiercely grabbed his dick. Steve was already hard and Tony muffled his moan with another brutal and languorous kiss. Then he pulled his hand out, frustratingly, and grabbed Steve's waist to push him against the nearest surface that was the right height to bend him over it. When Steve's back bumped into the dining table, Tony's hand grabbed his neck and squeezed a little while he kissed him one last time before swirling him around and pushing him down.
Tony heard his friend chuckle discreetly. "I'm pretty sure Steve would love it if you gave him flowers."
Steve almost choked on his own spit, remembering the taste of her on his tongue. "Why Natasha? She's alpha." Something twinged in his heart, well, he might not have presented yet, but he was pretty sure he was omega. At least, he had that for himself, for better or worse. Omegas were supposed to date alphas and alphas omegas. Why would Tony go from
"I'm so sorry, Tony." He whispered. "I should have told you about that painting. I just... I was scared how you would react and I... Frankly, I really just wanted to forget about it. Get it out of my life. I never thought it would just turn up in the worst possible way..."
be freaking out a little, in hindsight, but he just couldn't hold it against him now. "I'm so glad that you did."
Bucky answered his smile and plunged his eyes into Clint's who looked suddenly unsettled by the intensity in his husband's expression. Their hands were still entangled.
"Oh, I think I had to give him pretty heavy hints." Betty explained excitedly. "And even then, nothing. It's only when I invited him over for dinner that my feelings finally got through him. He only realized it wasn't work-related when I brought a pink heart-shaped cake to share for dessert and gave him a rose, though. I had to take my kiss myself!" She laughed wholeheartedly, eyes sparkling with love. "You should have seen the look on his face! I was scared I had made a monumental mistake but I guess things turned out all right in the end. I regret nothing." She squeezed his hand in hers and kissed him on the cheek lovingly.
The ride to the hospital wasn't long but something uncomfortable roiled in his stomach. That same uneasiness he had more or less felt all day long. Tony wanted to cry and he didn't know why, he just felt miserable. He pressed himself against Steve, hoping the feeling would go away but it didn't.
And Steve is sucking the alpha off and Bucky wants... he wants... And the alpha wants it too. He won't just let Bucky do it, he
Now he's slowly falling into a deep slumber, lulled by the warm and comforting presence of the omega. He's finally satiated, he thinks, and his omega smells like happiness so he can let himself go. He's gonna need a whole week at least, to recover from this. He can feel his omega purring in the distance, his gentle hands are fondling him. Everything is perfect.
It didn't have the heavy, impersonal and showing-off atmosphere that Steve had felt in Tony's other places of living. The penthouse resembled its owner and every facets he had. And maybe... maybe him too.
What has she done to deserve such a lousy pack alpha? One who can't even do something as stupidly simple as submitting his omegas, restore the peace and make everyone happy and fulfilled. Him and his fucking theories about wanting to dominate his instincts. If he just stopped trying to rationalize things, for once. If he just stopped trying to intellectualize something that was just purely instinctive and vital to their survival and their well-being.
"I can never give up on Bucky now." He chokes out, unable to see what Steve offers, unable to accept the hard truth. "He's mine and he'll always be mine, Steve. It's too late for us."
His heart skipped. The voice made him feel warm, his imagination suddenly going wild. He gazed up at him without thinking, as if drawn inevitably and stared stupidly at the boy, dazzled by his bright smile.
cute." He protested, because objectively speaking he wasn't. He was more of a thorny bush than a delicate flower, per say. Steve paused, reflecting upon the relevance of the comparison. Alphas were usually not compared with flowers, thorny or not, what was wrong with him?
Tony listens, heart beating fast. The conversation has turned really awkward really quickly and he didn't get the time to adjust. "He's in love with you." He whispers softly after a pause.
Steve didn't answer that. He was short of arguments for now. Both of them kept quiet as they walked along the corridor, heading to their next class.
Sometimes Tony shifted positions and Steve could catch a glimpse of his profile. The glint of an eye. A pout on round lips, often glistening wet. A focused frown. A straight nose that he often touched with the tip of his thumb. Steve had noticed, but only because that was the kind of things he did. Noticing, he meant.
When he woke up, slowly emerging from what felt like a comatose sleep, he had a raging headache. He took his surroundings in and was perplexed for a moment. He was leaning against Steve, in what looked like the emergency room of a hospital, and wondered for quite a while what the fuck he was doing here. He could hear the muffled sound of Steve's worried voice explaining things to a nice-looking nurse and felt like they were talking about him as if he wasn't in the room. It felt weird, like Tony was no longer in his own body, like he had died of some sort. He was soon reminded of the sad truth of his existence by the pain he felt all over his body, however, especially the burning ache in his throat.
He startles. He really did not expect that kind of reply. He pauses, wondering. Are they in trouble? As far as Tony's concerned, he's never been as happy as those last months of sharing a life with Steve. "Hum, no... We're fine." He finally says. "I mean, we're good. It's been amazing so far. I mean, it's perfect when it's just the two of us."
Tony pushed him against the shelves and ground into him, eager and hungry. He was probably hard too but Steve couldn't really feel it with the fireworks happening in his own pants. He was just trying to keep a clear mind.
Tony's mind drifted away and he started flying, more and more out of it, just like when he was a kid. The pain too intense, the excitement too intense, the rage that each blow titillated wrenching. His throat was used like a Fleshlight and the burn spread down in his entire body. He didn't care much. He didn't pay attention to the insults either. Those guys were really into that apparently. Not that Tony had ever cared. He didn't care about anything. Nothing mattered anymore. At some point though, the whole thing stopped being fun. He thought. At some point Tony got bored, or realized he was, and wanted them to stop, let him die or let him go.
Tony collapses over him when it's over and Steve wraps his arms around him, to keep him close for a little longer. He loved it, and can't wait to do it again.
Tony's eyes narrowed and he scrutinized Steve's face with an unsettling seriousness. "Is that what you want?" He finally asked, tone indifferent.
Loki shrugs. "I know you didn't." He takes another swig of his beer and gives him a gentle smile. Tony's curiosity is suddenly aroused.
Steve laughs but it sounds a little sad. He looks away and shrugs. "I wish I could tell you that's not what we want but I'm not quite sure about Bucky." He says with an amused smile. "It might be exactly what he wants from you, really." His eyes are twinkling in the subdued light. "Not me though." He adds, tone suddenly serious and words meaningful. He stares right into Tony's eyes, so determined it's unsettling. "I've never considered you as a human dildo, Tony. It wasn't about sex with you, despite what you think. Not even at the beginning. It took me a while to realize it but from the very moment our eyes met, it was more than just lust and biological urges."
There it was, the most humiliating thing that Tony could ever do to Steve in front of his co-workers. He stumbled, feeling hot and red as a beetroot,  Everyone was as startled as Steve had been however and they could only hear a few embarrassed chuckles around them before everyone got back to what they were supposed to do, being work, lunch break or simply get out of their way.
Steve raised timidly his eyes. Waiting was... reassuring option, but he really wanted to fuck. Anyway possible. And keep his hands on the alpha and never let go. "Don't you want to?"
Tony didn't protest, he just chuckled once more and somehow his laugh turned into silent sobs, muffled in the crook of his neck, and Steve's felt another pang in his chest. He curled his arms around Tony's head and held him tight against him, as tight as he could without literally choking him.
The moment feels right. Tony clears his throat, “Steve, will…” But he’s cut off by the doorbell ringing. The fippin’ owner has timing! In bursts a red-faced, grey haired man (because of course he has a key). He’s all in a tizzy, apologizing profusely for the lack of hot water as he unlocks the basement with a rattle and a clank and heads down with his toolbox.
“Wait!” said Tony as he cut Mike off. “I want to know what it explains, but first there’s something I have to say to Steve that I’ve been trying to say for a while, and it can’t wait any longer.”
The welcome to Starkesboro sign declared it, "A nice place to live," but they could tell something was weird about the place from the very beginning. They rolled into town, intentionally driving the least conspicuously flashy car from Tony’s collection. You don’t head off for a quiet getaway to ask your one true love to marry you in a car that brings the paparazzi along for the ride. He didn’t want to attract the attention of the local Twitter-happy citizen armed with a Stark Phone either (damn him for making social media posting so seamless).
Right now, Tony needed to focus on warming up Steve. He fired off a quick text to the owner to get himself over here pronto and get it fixed, got Steve toweled down and into dry clothes, and then worked on starting a fire as Steve huddled in a blanket on the couch. He knows this about Steve, pretty much the one thing that stops his stubborn determination in its tracks is uncontrolled cold. He was sick a lot as a kid and catching a real serious chill just puts him right back in that place of hunkering down.
“He was my grandfather,” Steve said softly. “He married and had a secret family, my mother and my Uncle Bucky, and now there’s me, his grandson. I know you’d never guess it with how small and feeble I am, but it’s the truth.
There was other weird stuff too. It wasn’t something you could confront, or even put your finger on. There was that guy on the vegetable aisle sniffing the air near Tony and Steve as they poked the tomatoes. The deli counter lady gave them this wolfish, sharp toothed smile when she handed over their sopressata. The cashier’s eyes had this strange red glow to them that Tony caught out of the corner of his eye when he approached the counter. It was gone once the kid started checking out their groceries while mumbling, “paper or plastic,” but they compared notes later and Steve had seen it too. Definitely odd.
By the time they were finished, they were hot and sweaty and breathless, and Tony was tired and that was fine. He helped Tony clean up and watched as he fell asleep on the couch. Soon as he was out, Steve stepped out onto the balcony and called Bucky.
Peter wonders if this could be the church Steve attends, and with a quick question to Nat, it's proven to be the one. He knew Steve couldn't make it, as much as he wanted to. Work was keeping him busy today, but that was okay. Peter knew that his dad had a life and he'd do well to respect it.
He bade goodnight to Steve around a jaw-cracking yawn on his way to the bedroom, but paused at the door when he caught Steve staring at the toaster out of the corner of his eye.
He’s closed his eyes for maybe ten seconds when the alarm goes off, signalling an intruder in the tower. Probably another psychotic, evil hell-bent on ruining their one day off. Or maybe Bruce Hulked out for some reason.
“Your Uncle Bucky is going to sleep here tonight, and in the morning he’ll make your favourite blue pancakes that I can’t ever get right. I’ll be home before you finish up and we can go biking tomorrow,” Steve acquiesces, stroking his thumb over Peter’s brow. “How does that sound?”
His first thought was: how the fuck is she dancing in those heels? They looked like two bodies, hard to separate from each other as they seemingly moved as one weird, mutant person accidentally manufactured in a lab with four arms and four feet, two of which were in high heels. Heels which barely touched the floor before they picked up again as the beautiful redheaded woman spun ‘round and ‘round, like in the impossible way of the Tazmanian Devil on the Looney Tunes Show, except far less hilarious and a lot more jaw-dropping.
“Nat told me they were hopeless, but I really didn’t realize to what extent ‘till now,” Bucky replied, sharing yet another look of incredulity with Sam.
He sticks his hand out. “My name is Tony,” he doesn’t say his last name, because some of the kids in his class had whispered really loudly and stared at him when his name was called in roll call. He knows his family is famous, but he doesn’t really understand why. His Dad isn’t in movies or anything.
“Excuse me, please?” Tony says, after a few minutes of working up the courage to talk to him. The boy turns to him with a slight frown, and Tony suddenly wishes he hadn’t said anything at all because he’s probably bothering him like he bothers his Dad when he plays too loudly.
