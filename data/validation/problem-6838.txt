Carol thanked her, and glanced back at Steve. Her expression was troubled, but her voice unwavering. “Barnes. Do you have a defence?”
“Wake me up in ten minutes,” he told Steve, with a seepy, almost cunning smile. The he closed his eyes, got comfortable, and seemingly drifted away.
Tony’s eyes shone a richer brown than usual in the first rays of the sun that arched their way through the cafe window. Steve took his order with a smile, and while Tony flipped through his wallet for cash he subtly used the time to study the man’s face as closely as he could.
The next day, Tony arranged himself along an entire booth, arm draped dramatically over his eyes to shield them from the early morning rays. Steve noticed the rock-band shirt he was wearing under his suit jacket had ridden up a little, revealing a little skin above the guy’s waistband.
The target range was empty. It was partially a blessing, knowing that nobody was around to witness him breaking, but it was also a curse. His constant urge to be busy, to help with the reconstruction, with the return of refugee citizens, to constantly
Steve barely looked up from stacking a newly washed cup against the draining board. “What a surprise,” he said, sarcasm lining his voice. “Considering all our customers are women.”
He swallowed, with difficulty, and gestured at the data she had strewn across his desk. “I can’t accept this. This is all… this doesn’t make any sense. Your data is clearly wrong. But that’s okay,” he said, shooting her a saccharine sweet smile. “We all make mistakes when we start out.”
“I am in no way going to claim that the Winter Soldier did not exist,” he began. “The Soldier was a terror upon all Hydra’s enemies, and has been for the past five years. But I do have some evidence, I hope, that James Buchanan Barnes was not, himself, responsible.
The man swallowed thickly and let his head fall back against the wall with a thud; let the phone fall limply from his hands. His eyes were no longer clenched tight, but they looked tired and dark and sad, and Anthony wanted to run his thumbs over those eyelids and kiss away the bruises below them.
The moment the spell is complete, the angel disappears in a cloud of dust, and Steve’s heart crashes through the floor. They had watched the same thing happen to the other victims, bore witness as the spell became complete and the statues shattered into nothing.
to have one. The vast majority were people who had killed enemy soldiers in the war, but now and then a suspicious case arose: a mysteriously gifted person with no previous murderous history to be found.
Steve doesn’t let him finish; he crashes their lips together, a disaster of lips and teeth and twin grins pressed against each other, and as laughter bubbles up his throat to join his team’s all he can think is that the kiss is utterly
was good enough, or if he was going to Hell forever for letting a team of scientists alter his God-given body.
A sailor handed a stack of pamphlets to the COs near the bow, and soon they were spread out among the men. Little explanations of French words, road signs, and maps. Everyone knew the mission. Everyone had been drilled on the mission until their brains hurt.
“This was one time,” Steve choked out, gripping tight to Tony’s shirt. This was probably the last time they’d ever see each other. He didn’t think he’d be invited to Peter’s graduation. Or marriage. Or birthday parties. Or anything. He would be the uncomfortable body in the backdrop that Peter shied away from.
“Can I hold it when Daddy comes?” Peter asked, all but bouncing in Steve’s arms. “he’ll think I’m really tall!”
“Why wouldn’t I think it’s genuine? It’s Steve. I don’t think it’s possible for him to fake something like that,” Tony said, trying not to think about the fact that
Alive, people could stay away from him without feeling bad about it. They could be perfectly happy without the guilt, the wondering if there was anything they could have done.
“Wood,” she said. She crouched to the floor, her little finger tracing the lines in one of the decorative planks creeping from the walls.
Someone had gotten Tony to change his habits. Not even Steve had been able to do that in all of their years together. Buying a piece of furniture on a date was probably one of the only times they had jointly decided to make any alterations to the main house. He was pretty sure Tony had even been adverse to Steve’s clothing moving into his dresser at first. The man did not like change in his household.
Even if Peter hadn’t called him in years. Even if they hadn’t seen each other face-to-face in almost five. Even if he didn’t know who his little boy was anymore.
The mission was forgettable, though it was one of the rare occasions where their intel was bad in a good way. The hard drive they needed to extract was only manned by a small task force that was easily taken care of with no casualties. Tony pulled the data like clockwork and Natasha ruptured the system shortly thereafter. They got out without so much as a ding in Tony’s armor. Easy. Steve might have thought it was too easy, had he been less focused on Tony not getting himself killed.
Dinner was canned peaches and something close to chili from one of Bruce’s prototype MRE packages that were supposed to better support their superhuman abilities. Namely Steve’s.
This crush certainly wasn’t planned. Not to mention that Steve didn’t even want to be attracted to Tony Stark in the first place. Tony was a selfish, spoiled brat. He was rude and obnoxious and all he cared about was himself and his money.
A low rumble of thunder bellowed through the penthouse, rattling the priceless paintings on the walls. Steve wasn’t overly fond of storms, but he did appreciate the beauty of them. Right now, though, he was tempted to call in a favor from Thor to send the light and noises away.
Peter pulled back and raised his brows with a sigh. “Finals went fine. Some of my professors though…”
Blaine would have hated him, but Steve got along with him fine. Emory had an ego, but Steve was a master at making sure that ego didn’t show up around him. He’d married Tony Stark, after all.
Tony shifted in his own sleeping bag, shivering in the nighttime chill. Steve hadn’t put up the tent because he couldn’t tell if the sand would support it, and it was too dark to build it anyway. Besides, Tony could use a night under the stars—he probably hadn’t experienced a “camping” trip since the time Steve dragged him to the Rockies while they were still married.
Steve stopped walking and turned around, his eyes red and his cheeks wet. “I’m sorry I ruined us,” he said shakily. “But I wanted to save what I could of our family. And I did. You and Peter have done so much together. I’m proud of both of you.”
Bucky had only said it about a hundred times at the bar, and Sam probably a dozen times more before he had left the bar with a nice girl. Bucky had gone back to his hotel, unable to sleep anywhere foreign that wasn’t at least ten stories up.
Steve looked up almost pleadingly as Blaine stepped back toward the warm light coming from inside the bar, but said nothing.
“That’s awesome, Peter,” Tony said with a wide grin. “We’ll have to put it on loop in all of the buildings.”
For a fleeting second he thought it was Jane Foster in the soldier’s arms. She had the same brown hair, but her lips were fuller, like Natasha’s. Anger burned in her eyes and her mouth was twisted into a snarl.  She was young, too. Young and unbelievably stupid.
Sometimes Steve wondered if his and Tony’s divorce had somehow helped Peter to discern what a good relationship was supposed to be like. Peter dealt with relationship problems so gently and with so much concern for Mary Jane that it made Steve feel like he had been a fool to ever think he and Tony were in love with each other. Peter was only nineteen and already displaying more maturity in his relationship than Steve ever had in his.
Everyone put down their cards and turned to look at the screen. Blaine grabbed the remote off of his bed and turned up the volume.
“No,” Steve answered, as though Tony had been asking the question seriously. “But I did watch the news.”
Steve laughed, shaking his head. “I know, I know. I managed to make it out unscathed, though.” He sipped some more broth, then got this little goofy smile that Bucky hadn’t seen in a long time.
He hit the water and went under, but it still felt strange not to feel wet on his face or head at all. His HUD highlighted the fish fleeing from them, and Blaine as he walked across the bottom of the lake toward the house.
The sounds called them. Each rolling wave beneath them sent energy surging to triumph over their fear. They were scared to death and itching to fight all at once. Some men howled, like dogs. They were all like dogs, Steve supposed. Dogs penned up for too long, trained but never put to the test. Now they were furious with excitement, ready to sink their teeth into flesh and tear away.
The gushing fountain of happiness in Steve’s chest burst a pipe. He swallowed, glancing between the tablet and Tony, waiting for the joke. The true story. He waited for Tony to laugh and say that it was all a trick, that he really just wanted to go get dinner.
“You just love to cause me pain, don’t you,” Steve snarled. “No, I don’t want to go to dinner. I’m done being your puppet, Tony. I thought I could handle whatever it was, but this? This is cruelty and you know it.”
Now he was standing in the middle of a charming New England boutique wondering what the hell he was going to buy for Tony and Jackson’s wedding.
Nobody knew that the core of his happiness didn’t come from some notion of finally being able to move on—no, it was far more selfish. Steve considered this wedding a victory. He had won. He had been the one to prove everyone wrong who said he was a gold-digging super slut that was going to date someone else and take Tony’s money. He made his own money and had raised Peter without so much as a cent from Tony. Even that extra money from the museum had felt tainted in his wallet, but so long as Tony’s name wasn’t on the check, he could swallow it.
Steve grabbed Peter by the shirt and threw the door open, all but throwing Peter out into the hallway. Peter gave a panicked scream, and Steve snatched the phone before flying out into the hall. He grabbed his son and bolted for the outside door.
His therapist said he shouldn’t be angry at Tony for moving on. Tony didn’t owe him anything, no matter what he had said in the past. Even if he’d said he loved him.
“Daddy’s gotta,” he soothed, dabbing her face one last time before he laid her down in her crib. He covered her in a blanket when she started to shiver, thought he wasn’t sure that was the move Steve would have made.
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony whispered. “I’m not trying to force anything out of you. I just needed to know.”
Anger was bubbling up in him, the cold kind that made him nervous. He didn’t hate Tony. He couldn’t hate Tony, not for this. Even if he did feel betrayed, he wasn’t yet sure if he was allowed to feel that way. And where in his past he would have charged back swinging, Steve wasn’t the same person now.
Surprisingly, it looked like a normal subway train. It was cleaner too, but had some dirt and grime. It rolled to a smooth stop, and Steve fell behind a young man who had been waiting nearby, slipping into the train car.
“Jesus,” Steve hissed as he startled. He tossed down the towel onto the counter and hurried back into the bedroom to find Tony standing in the doorway, clutching a small picture frame in his hand.
“Tell me what’s going on so I can understand,” Steve pleaded. “I promise I’ll sleep if you just tell me.”
He betrayed himself as he slid into Tony, listened to him whine and moan as he worked himself deeper, inch by inch until he was fully sheathed.
Steve knew better than to ask.  Tony would tell him if he gave him a few moments to build his courage.  So he just sat quietly for a moment, rubbing his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand.  He hadn’t even known Tony had one of Howard’s cars in storage.  Tony took a breath and Steve shoved his thoughts aside for the moment.
Steve had become aware of his surroundings about two minutes ago, but he’d heard voices and decided he had an advantage in feigning unconsciousness. Unfortunately, the voices stopped shortly after he had awoken. The only thing he could gather was that at least two other men were here with them. The bomb, or whatever it was, had to have been planted above Tony’s workshop. It was likely he had been the target, and Steve had simply been a bonus in the whole operation.
Steve watched as Tony rose from the bed and stretched, the muscles in his back flexing and making Steve’s mouth water. He’d never let himself admire Tony so openly in the light of day, and it was a new experience that Steve never wanted to give up. He also desperately wished he had a pencil and paper to help him document the curve of Tony’s shoulders and neck, the ridges of his spine, the shifting angles of his shoulder blades, the way the elegant line of his back led the eye down to...
His wrists were unchained and he collapsed to the ground, gasping slightly from jarring his injuries. He heard one man leave but was helpless to prevent the kick to the face that likely came from Blade’s boot. He stayed on the ground until he heard the cell doors lock and all the footsteps recede as the sedative began to wear off. There was blood flowing from his nose, which was definitely broken, but it would heal.
“I’m assuming there’s a reason I’m in your private apartment, soldier,” Fury said. “And I’m also assuming there’s a reason your recent cellmate is absent.”
“Huh-uh, come back,” Tony said, using his other hand to grab Steve by the front of his shirt and pull him into a searing kiss.
Steve nodded. This was exactly why Fury couldn’t talk to Tony. “Sir, I wanted to tell you that I will submit a full report of what occurred down there. I’ll even answer any questions you have right now,” Steve said. “But I think- well, I know- that it would be best if you didn’t ask the same of Tony.”
They lay like that, kissing softly and talking quietly, until Tony drifted off.  Steve watched him for a while, comforted by his even breaths.
Steve pulled away and glanced around for a moment until he found a chair to sit in.  He pulled it over next to the bed and collapsed backward.
He suddenly realized that it was hard to sit alone with his thoughts in this new century. He never used to struggle with alone time, but recently, he’d gotten used to technology always being on in some form or the voices of the other Avengers filtering through the Tower. He’d gotten used to how loud life could be with his team, and the quiet was unsettling now.
“You’re in control of what happens next, Stark,” Kray said. “Say the right words, and all of this stops.”
Steve tugged Tony away from the counter and lifted him by the backs of his thighs, causing Tony to yelp in surprise, his hands shifting to Steve’s shoulder and his legs wrapping around his waist instinctively. Tony raised an eyebrow, but his cheeks were flushed.
Tony glanced at Steve and motioned to the paper in his hand. “Crossword troubles?” Steve startled and unfolded the paper on the desk.
Later, when Steve lay worn out on his stomach and Tony lay on his side next to him, stroking his back with a lazy hand, Tony spoke up. “Steve...how are you so okay with all of this?”
Steve could tell there was debris on top of them, weighing his back down slightly- probably the remnants of the desk they’d dove under. He tried to keep the weight off of Tony while he listened for the voices. It was quiet, though, except for the faint sounds of water leaking from the ceiling somewhere and an alarm going off distantly.
Steve and Tony crouched behind a broken chunk of concrete, and Steve surveyed the area. A sensation of relief stronger than he expected filled his chest when he saw his team, along with many SHIELD agents, fighting against Kray’s men.
Steve sighed. “It’s...worse than they realized. DC is completely corrupted as well. And it extends all the way to the higher-ups. Fury doesn’t know who to trust. And half the time, he’s just waiting to see who’ll put out a hit on him.” Tony squeezed Steve’s hip in comfort, as Steve looked at him with ghosts in his eyes. “It’s HYDRA, Tony.”
And Tony was a huge part of all of it. He honestly didn’t know what he would do if he lost him. So he wouldn’t let that happen.
Tony smirked. “That can definitely be arranged.” Steve gave a small laugh and thumbed at the corners of Tony’s eyes.
Tony cleared his throat. “Anyway, how did you fill the long- no doubt, extremely boring- hours of my absence?” Tony asked.
“Date?” Natasha finished, one brow raised. Steve thought that was a funny choice of words since they’d only really had one date (last night) which had gone okay, then pretty badly, and then amazingly at the end part. But Steve nodded, a feeling of unease falling over him at Nat’s subtle frown.
Steve sat watching Tony for a long time, making sure he’d fallen asleep and watching the steady rise and fall of his chest. Eventually, he drifted off after him.
“Well, you know,” Tony said. “Fashionably late and all that.” Steve smiled, but Tony’s answering smile had an edge of tension. It reminded Steve of how he smiled at the media. Steve’s brows furrowed, but Tony sidled up to him at the stove, distracting him by asking about dinner.
When Steve got close enough, Tony threw him the other towel, which Steve swiped across his chest and arms to mop up some of the water, but which really did little to dry him off. Steve collapsed onto his knees in the sand, and Tony’s eyes widened when he moved as though he were going to lay on top of Tony, his hands in the sand on either side of Tony’s waist. But he aborted the movement halfway through, at the look on Tony’s face, and sat back on his heels, glancing around him with a dejected look that Tony immediately wished he could never see again.
...Except he didn’t get the chance. When he’d awoken the next day, Tony was already gone, whisked away by Pepper and Rhodey, who had evidently been assisting with the search for him and Steve any way they could.
Nick Fury, however, was a different story. Steve knew he wouldn’t have the same compunction about preserving their feelings, so Steve was determined to intercept him before he could get to Tony.
Tony had been trying to placate Kray but the pressure of the gun under Steve’s chin had increased until he winced, and Tony had insisted they search his person. The men holding him had frisked him forcefully, throwing him to the ground when they found nothing.
Steve took the crossword with him, along with a mug of coffee, and made his way down to Tony’s lab. Before he’d even opened the door, he could hear Tony’s music as well as JARVIS and Tony’s voices floating above the noise. Steve entered his access code and pulled open the door, the music lowering upon his entrance.
“Um,” Steve cleared his throat when his voice came out gravelly. “Maybe we should move back inside.” Tony nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Steve waited another moment, his breath calming slightly, before pushing himself up and off of Tony.
“You’ve got the dish towel slung over the shoulder and everything,” Tony said teasingly, patting Steve’s shoulder briefly. “Are you a secret chef?”
He remembered what Tony had told him in Kray’s cell, about the hazy memory of screaming through a surgery in a cave, one without anesthesia, while they carved out a whole in his sternum- not understanding what was happening or why. Steve couldn’t imagine. The pain of the serum entering his body had been incredible, but he’d entered into it willingly, knowing what it would mean.
“Well, I’ve got some work in the lab,” Tony said when he’d finished his coffee. “Later, Bruce, Steve...” Tony brushed his hand across Steve’s shoulders as he walked past him toward the elevator. “I’ll be downstairs if you need me.”
And it was like those words set Tony free. He closed his eyes and breathed out shakily, moving closer to Steve and leaning against the bars that separated them. “H-how are you? What can I do?” Tony asked.
To make matters worse, Tony was only dressed in his jeans and a thin tank top, like he often wore in the lab. Not that Steve was much better off in his t-shirt. He thought about taking off his shirt and throwing it into Tony’s cell for him, just so he would have an extra layer, but he didn’t think it would be welcomed or appreciated.
“You sounded really Brooklyn for a bit there, Cap.” Steve rolled his eyes, but smiled down at his lap. “I wish I’d gotten to know that little guy from Brooklyn,” Tony said, still smiling.
“You won’t leave, will you,” Tony said, not a question but a statement of fact. He wasn’t talking about DC, either. Somehow- and it was too early to feel this so absolutely- but somehow Tony knew Steve wasn’t ever going to leave this. Them. He’d never felt so sure about something since he’d built Iron Man to destroy his weapons in the hands of terrorists.
One of the men looked over at Steve’s cell and saw him watching them. “But look who is awake.” This caused the other men to look at him. The man in front stepped in front of his cell, eyeing him for a moment without saying anything.
Steve didn’t know what to do with himself, so he tried to get back into a routine- working out in the team gym, sparring with Natasha, watching cartoons with Thor, working on the report for Fury. But he couldn’t stop thinking about needing to talk to Tony.
Pepper had liked it cold in the room so she could pile blankets on top of herself, and Tony hadn’t minded, adding sweatpants to his sleepwear. But he didn’t so much need sweatpants anymore with a human furnace in his bed. And Steve didn’t like the cold, so Tony kept the room warmer for him. All of this to say that he was somewhere in the middle now, wearing a tank top and boxer briefs to bed at night.
“Yeah, and I’m sure it won’t be our last.” But Steve only sounded matter-of-fact, maybe even fond. “Wasn’t much of a fight, though. There wasn’t even yelling.”
“I’m not trying to fix you, Tony,” Steve said. “I’m just trying to help. Look around you. Can’t you see you’re running yourself ragged?”
“Oh, you do, do you?” Tony arched an eyebrow, and Steve reached his hand up to rub his thumb gently against the crow’s feet at the corner of Tony’s eye.
“Tony,” Steve bit his lip anxiously. “I’m really serious about this- us. And I feel like you might be too...” Steve waited until Tony nodded at him to continue. “I don’t want to hide this from the team. I want to be able to...pursue whatever I’m feeling when I’m around you, and I won’t be able to do that if I have to hide it around them. And anyway, I don’t think I’d be able to keep my hands off of you for that long, now that I’m allowed.”
He didn’t catch sight of Tony all day, which Steve knew meant he was wrapped up in work in the lab. When it got to be midnight and there was still no sight of him, Steve made his way downstairs. Tony was in the lab with the music blaring, same as usual, but he was sitting at his workstation, his elbows resting on the desk and his head in his hands. Steve frowned and made his way to Tony’s side.
The lab, then, Steve thought. He wasn’t surprised. That was usually where Tony was when no one had seen him. He glanced down at the crossword in his hands and smiled at the memory of asking for Tony’s help only last week. It felt like a lifetime ago.
One of the men behind him tore off Steve’s shirt, causing Steve to sigh. Now he definitely wouldn’t be giving it to Tony.
“Tony, you aren’t sleeping. And you’re waking up, gasping for breath, from nightmares that you won’t acknowledge,” Steve continued, before Tony could interrupt. “I understand if you don’t want to talk about it. God knows, I don’t want to talk about my nightmares. But you can’t go on pretending it’s not happening.”
“I thought all your cars had safety codes to prevent anything like this from happening.  Isn’t Jarvis able to override or something when he thinks you’re incapable of driving?”  Steve asked.
Kray himself was missing, but Steve couldn’t imagine it would be for too long, with the combined minds of SHIELD and Tony Stark looking for him.
Tony was looking up toward the ceiling, trying to find what was stealing Steve’s attention, but it was too high of a frequency for any normal hearing to pick up. The noise suddenly stopped. And it took Steve exactly 2.6 seconds to grab Tony and dive under the desk before the ceiling imploded.
The boss smiled. “We won’t be so foolish as to leave you with your own devices, Stark. My men will be with you as you work, and if we suspect anything-- well, let’s just say that the good Captain might have accelerated healing, but it won’t be able to keep up with us...”
“Yes, it was quite impressive, actually,” Thor said from his seat at the counter. “I’ve never seen a meal disappear so quickly, on Earth or Asgard!”
“Alright, Tony,” Steve said gently. He looked at Steve in surprise, and Steve nodded. “I understand.”
Steve’s whole body felt like it was burning, yet Tony was barely touching him. Tony’s hand around Steve’s wrist clenched every few seconds and it was a reminder that this was affecting Tony as much as it was affecting Steve.
Steve watched his fingers trace Tony’s shoulder, letting his hand wander further down Tony’s back and following the path with his eyes. Tony studied Steve’s face while he was distracted. There was a pounding in Tony’s chest, a lump in his throat, a burning in his eyes and in his gut that was starting to overwhelm him. He felt so much for this man laying next to him that he thought he might burst with it. He simultaneously longed to shout it out and keep it buried. He didn’t think either would make the feeling go away.
Once they’d done all they could at SHIELD and retrieved Bruce, the Avengers reunited officially on the quinjet. There was a lot of hugging and suppressed tears, but it already felt like the way it should be. None of the team had asked Tony or Steve what had happened in the nine days that they were prisoners. And he knew they wouldn’t push either of them to talk if they didn’t want to.
“You don’t approve?” Steve asked, his tone a little sardonic, considering Nat wasn’t his parent. But he was also a little hurt by her reaction, even if it wouldn’t change his mind about anything. Steve noticed Bruce out of the corner of his eye, grabbing his coffee and shuffling quietly to the armchair by the television, giving Nat and Steve space. “You don’t seem surprised, either,” Steve continued.
Steve tilted Tony’s head up to look at him. He was smiling and it made Tony’s chest constrict for a different reason than before. “Pretty sure we were kind of flirting when we argued on the Quinjet that one time.”
Steve didn’t bother with responding. He doubted he would ever beg this man for anything, but he supposed he didn’t fully know what he was capable of.
“Well, what would you suggest?” Tony huffed. “We’ve gotta go up there if you want to get out of here.”
“But then I woke up in this century, where a lot of people are so much more open about their sexuality. There was a whole community out there that understood and were sure of themselves too. I think I started accepting a part of myself that I’d ignored for years. But I didn’t really understand it fully...until you.” Tony raised an eyebrow and Steve nodded. “It was hard to deny my sexuality when Tony Stark was always around, looking like you did and always making me feel...well, it was undeniable at that point.”
Blade had also eventually grown tired of the knives pulling little reaction from Steve, and had moved on to other tactics, such as breaking bones. He might not have been as big as Steve, but he was certainly strong enough to cause damage. And he’d correctly assumed that broken bones would take longer for the serum to heal.
Tony gave a small smile, but his eyes were a little sad. “I have to admit to you, though, that I’m probably gonna be messed up about this Kray thing for a while.” Steve frowned and stroked Tony’s chin again. “I just...I feel responsible- and I know,” Tony talked over Steve so he couldn’t interrupt. “I know you don’t think the same, but it’s just how my mind works through these things. I’m probably gonna be in the lab for hours every day, and I might not be here in the mornings when you wake up. It can be hard for me to sleep when my mind is cycling like this.”
“I remember what I saw- aliens, wormholes, space- and I...can’t even comprehend...” Tony swallowed thickly, but forced himself to continue. “I try to sleep, and I can’t. I come down here. Do what I know. Try to prepare for the next mission- the next threat. It’s the only thing holding me together. That and...you.” Steve’s arms were still crossed over his chest, but his eyes didn’t look angry. “I have to protect what’s most important. You, the Avengers, Pepper, Rhodey- you’re my family. I can’t...”
Tony turned around, catching Steve’s dark gaze and the way he was biting his bottom lip. Tony raised an eyebrow and winked at Steve. “Are you coming, or not?” he asked, as he sidled into the bathroom. The sound of the shower turning on prompted Steve to clamber out of the bed after him.
“...About you,” Steve said, his voice a rough murmur, and his hand finished its path from Tony’s shoulder to behind his neck, his thumb feeling the soft texture of Tony’s hair.
“Sir, what’s happening at SHIELD?” Steve asked. Fury sighed, one of the first times Steve had seen an honest emotional reaction out of him, if that’s what it could be called.
“I think I need you to tell me,” Bucky said gently, lowering his hand again and thumbing Steve’s shoulder.
Steve nodded to himself. “Yeah, might not be the best choice. Could poison the water supply or show us some new tricks.”
Stark Tower gleamed above, reflecting a gorgeous skyline. Of course, it was actually Avengers Tower now, but Steve never saw it that way, especially now that they had the compound.
“I actually go to this painting class in Manhattan on Wednesdays in this great little studio,” Steve continued, unable to stop smiling.
“ ‘M okay,” Steve slurred, turning onto his left side. His right arm was a mess, but his kneepads and shin guards had protected at least the front of his legs. Operators did not give up, and Steve was not about to let Blaine handle this on his own.
Trading one parent for another. That was all a divorce would do.  And Tony might turn right around and go back to being busy all the time, leaving Peter to take care of himself. To grow up alone, thinking his Papa didn’t want to ever see him.
“Four hundred thousand remain ready to come online. But sir…there was talk of a clean. What is protocol if the backpack is to be thrown away?”
Without so much as a goodbye, Steve adjusted his beanie and turned away, heading back for the elevator. Peter might have been happier knowing that he regretted everything he had ever done to hurt his family. Peter would have also been happy to know that Steve would spent the rest of his eternal life warring with all of the ‘what ifs’ of his marriage, of having a child. What if he had just let it go to abuse. What if it hadn’t ended up going to abuse. What if he had stuck around long enough for Tony to divorce him. What if he had waited another week, another year, another fucking lifetime to end things.
Steve’s eyes narrowed slightly. “I’m sorry, I was told not to get any ideas. Is this a social thing or a business meeting?”
The words hung in the air a little too long, twisting them from something positive to something less so. He hated the way it echoed in his chest like notes gone sour, because it was all a lie. He could have fun at a pop up exhibit with Steve Rogers, but it didn’t change that he was hiding a pretty big secret, and would be hiding one for some time still.
Steve couldn’t fight the stinging guilt, the anger that pricked him afterward. He wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to get past what happened in Sibera—not with Tony, at least. Sometimes it felt dooming, other times it felt like a challenge. Surely someday he could be truly good again in Tony’s eyes.  Wasn’t that the reason he agreed to this mess in the first place?
Steve had been pacing the lobby of his hotel for the past hour, and had been trying to get ahold of his son for the past thirty minutes. Going back to his room would end very badly, he knew. Besides, Malibu was too sunny and beautiful to be cooped up in a tiny room anyway. The grand expanse of the lobby was much better.
Very little could faze him now. Certainly not physical intimacy or sleeping next to strangers. Hell, he’d slept naked in the woods with soldiers he didn’t know  to escape the heat.
. About the relationship that was ever so slowly becoming real again, but that Tony knew would ultimately shatter when a kid entered the mix. He’d seen the way Steve looked at the kids on the field trip: with gratitude that he didn’t have one. Steve was amazing with children, but Tony had very well seen today he didn’t want one of his own. But Steve wanted
Peter didn’t answer right away and Steve had to close his eyes and clench his jaw to keep from breaking down right there.
“Who are you?!?” Steve snapped. “Where’s Tony? Where are my friends? Tell me what’s going on first, then I’ll see about sleeping.”
Two weeks until Tokyo. Two weeks until he could finally throw away the gold band on his finger that had destroyed his life.
Steve had never realized how suffocating New York had become until he left it. Fresh air was his drug now—and Bucky was the only person that could keep up with him to enjoy it. Now he only felt at ease when his heart was trying to escape his ribcage and his lungs were burning white-hot in his chest.
“I’m not sure this is a good idea. You won’t even tell me what the reason is. That usually means it’s something I won’t like.”
“You’re a fucking asshole, you know that?” Maria was furious. For some reason Steve found it hilarious. She ticked just like Tony: as long as he passed off everything she said, she would get more and more angry.
“His happiness is our first priority,” Steve corrected. “He hasn’t seen me in four years. I’m not going to force it on him at his wedding when he doesn’t want me there.”
So he just nodded once and backed away until he had pushed the door open to enter the atrium. Peter watched him go, but it was Franklin who had knowing eyes that Steve didn’t like.
“He’s seen pictures,” Steve assured him. “You have grown a lot, though. Did you know you’re almost six inches taller than when we first came here?”
Something terrible was about to happen, Steve could feel it. Getting in the car with Tony had been a huge mistake. It had been stepping into a snare. They headed out to the car and Steve dreaded every step. The coffees were warm in his scraped-up hands, but Steve could only feel a chill.
“You’re making me drowsy,” Tony murmured, resting his head on Steve’s chest where Peter’s little body had been only minutes before.
“I promise I’m not going to hurt you,” Tony assured him. It held no weight with Steve. He glared at Tony as a pair of glasses were pulled from Tony’s pocket, identical to the pair he was currently wearing. He slipped them on Steve’s face.
Tony shrugged. “We pretend to be in a relationship again. You can move back into the tower—on your floor, of course. Let everyone think you moved back into the penthouse.”
friends with. Wherever he was, Bucky had been here, and he had trusted this man enough to tell him a story like that.
Steve’s eyes flew open, his brow creased in confusion. “What? I’m going to the wedding. I can’t just miss my son’s—“
He set Tony down after a moment, looking into his eyes. Dark, warm. Nothing like the bright blue he’d seen during his time away. Steve’s hands framed Tony’s face, thumbing at his perfect cheeks, unable to stop smiling. It was really him.
“I’m gonna take a nap and come check on you in just a bit, okay?” He leaned down, pressing a kiss to her temple. Still warm, but he knew that would fade. If not, he had an excuse to come kick Steve’s door in when his daughter was hospitalized for a fever.
It looked…a bit unlike Morgan’s usual art. She was very smart, picking up on things many kids hadn’t—like the sky not just being a blue bar above the trees. But her drawing was just a bunch of sloping lines and circles all over the page. The color palette was nice – blue, purple, and red crayon.
Tony smiled fondly, resting their foreheads together. “More than you know.” He leaned back again. “And I promise to never leave you alone on the tarmac again.”
Steve moved his hand up to his chest, lacing his fingers with Tony’s. He wanted to kiss each knuckle, run his lips along the callouses Tony had built up from years working and inventing. But he was too tired, so he just gave Tony’s hand another squeeze.
“Oh, yeah. Well…I think most of it is just me being selfish,” Steve continued with a dry chuckle. No, he was being completely and utterly selfish, ruining Peter’s day and causing drama by bringing Blaine, who would be seen as his date the entire time. “But I still…” His voice went quiet. “I still want to feel like I’m part of his family.”
Steve didn’t reply, wiping the tears from his cheeks. There weren’t too many. He had gotten much better at stifling his old habits.
Steve blinked slowly, feeling a little lethargic. He wanted to lie down and sleep for the rest of his life. Again.
“Would if make you feel better?” Steve asked, not yet removing his hand. “Because if it’d help you feel better, I really don’t mind. Seriously. I know my Tony would do it for your Steve if things were reversed.”
“Call your son. Don’t come calling to try to make me feel bad for you anymore. He’s your kid, you tell him the bitter truth. At least have the balls to do that.”
“Tony probably has a concussion,” Steve told her, cutting him off. “He hasn’t walked yet since the impact, so lifting him out would probably be best.”
“Overwatch, package is secure,” Steve murmured into his comm as they advanced onto a rooftop. “Requesting extraction, over.”
The new blood was cold in his veins, and it wasn’t long before Tony was laying a thick blanket over him to stop him from shaking. Steve tried to scream many times, but the fear rendered him mute with terror.
“I don’t want you in my life. I don’t want you in Dad’s life. The only reason you’re here is because MJ loves you because I didn’t have the heart to tell her that Captain America is such a shitty person underneath the mask,” Peter snarled, but he was crying too. “Don’t walk down the aisle tomorrow thinking that things are going to change just because I’m getting married. You left this family.”
Well, he really was an idiot. Tony chuckled to himself as he crouched down with her, following her finger with his own. “Wow,” he breathed, genuinely impressed. “You’re smarter than me, you know that?”
“Match for what, Rhodey?” Steve jabbed his chin toward the blood. “Is that my blood? Is he what, cloning me?”
“Fine,” he finally said. “I won’t text him this week. Or next. I’ll let him…make his decision or whatever.”
Steve’s eyes were still locked on the childhood toy, rooted to his spot. He wanted Tony to know he’d looked. That he’d seen the life Tony had removed him from.
Now he had an electric razor sitting in a drawer that looked like some sort of alien machinery, with three circular spinning blades and the supposed ability to shave dry without cuts. As much as Steve tried to put his trust in new technology, that was one he just couldn’t get past.
“You’re damn right,” Peter snapped. Steve wanted to close his eyes to see if that would stop the peeling of his long-healed scars. Peter cleared his throat. “Captain America ruined my father’s legacy. We could have been decades ahead of where we are today if Cap would have recognized that he was slowing my father down.”
“What? That I would say I want to be with him again?” Steve snapped as quietly as he could. “This is ridiculous.”
“Just getting people checked in. Um, your seat is in the back here. Let me show you.” She nodded toward the chairs in the sand.
Real Depression shit right there. After eighty years you’d think a guy would give it a rest, especially when he was surrounded by opulence.
“I didn’t ask you, no,” Steve said quietly, thumbing Tony’s cheekbone. “But I asked Pepper all the time. Asked Rhodey, even got Happy to give me a few details every now and then. But Morgan told me the most.”
Even the stairs down to the subway seemed more tucked away in Brooklyn.  Though they weren’t any less traveled, Steve appreciated that subway stations usually seemed calmer than throughout the rest of the city.
Steve turned to see Tony making his way into the kitchen, his sunglasses resting on top of his head. Jackson was close behind.
Steve told himself to look at it like a vacation. Malibu in springtime. He would be escaping the miserable weather in the north, staying in a nice hotel, and he’d get to see all of his friends in one place. That barely ever happened anymore.
“It’s okay to still like him, you know,” Natasha said, her voice going softer the way it did when she thought Steve was being too hard on himself (which had happened much more often in the past year).
Just Cap, the Commander said. Quick and easy mission. They just needed Cap for the newsreels. The papers.
“I think I need to get some sleep,” Steve said, but the words felt unformed as they fell out of his mouth.
Harry explained. “I’m here for the ladies, Mr. Rogers. Peter’s just gonna pine for MJ the whole time.”
He swallowed hard. “So we’ll just see each other when it works for you—“ Never. Because Peter would have to be punishing himself to come into the sad little apartment to spend time doing nothing with the man who shoved all of his ideas down Peter’s throat. “—and that’s fine. Is that fine with you?”
The Navy commander stared at them with a decent amount of hatred—he was a sailor and they were soldiers, Steve didn’t fault him for that—then nodded once.
“You know what? My people are going to love hearing about this,” Maria snarled. “As soon as I’m out of here, you’ll wish you treated me with respect.”
Bucky set his rifle on the floor and lay down behind it, checking his scope and ensuring everything was in order. He had a good view of the fields and forests. Given that the team started to the north, they probably wouldn’t be flanked.
Bucky’s eyes flicked open when he heard the sound of cupboards closing in the kitchen. He rubbed his eyes, wincing a little as one hand pressed cold to his face, then sat up with a yawn. Even something as stupid as a yawn took a ridiculous amount of mental wrestling to achieve. Weapons did not yawn.
“He told us this was what he wanted,” Vision murmured. “I trust that he knows that this is what’s best.”
Tony sat with a paper straw bouncing between his lips. He’d chewed through two already. He wasn’t sure the sea turtles were any safer. He glanced at his timepiece, the minute hand a quarter past seven. A full half an hour after Steve was supposed to show up. Well, a full half an hour since Steve had been invited to show up.
Steve jerked his head, twisting as he felt ligaments snapping, his heart madly pumping blood into his gaping chest cavity.
Steve put up a hand. “That’s worse. Don’t tell me that. Don’t tell me you planned on being there and still couldn’t make it.”
“Hey, can I get my coffee now?” Tony snarled, arms crossed. “Steve, show me where the hell there’s a Starbucks around here. Hell, I’ll even take a Tim Horton’s, just get me some coffee.”
And how could Steve deny that smile? Tony had no idea he’d disappointed him—Tony just wanted to be around him. He just wanted to spend time with his…friend. But maybe this was the way back to where they had once been.
God, it was so strange to touch him again. Even if this was not consensual by any means, Steve had to do it. Just to make sure that was still the same Tony he’d left. No—the same Tony who had left him.
Now that was something Steve had never anticipated hearing. Tony never said the word “need.” Not unless he was desperate, or under threat. Or someone he loved was under threat.
“Yeah,” Blaine said, his smile catching the moonlight. “But are you sure you wanna go back? We’ve got two more days of leave.”
Jackson was speaking quietly to Tony, and Tony was nodding and saying something back, but Steve couldn’t make anything out until Tony looked up at him, his eyes still a little wild.
Dust filtered through a shaft of sunlight in Steve Roger’s office. He occupied a sophisticated leather desk chair, sitting at a sleek glass top desk that was clean of clutter. There weren’t even desk decorations, nor photos. He preferred to keep his personal life outside of work as much as possible. The only indication he even had a personal life was the titanium alloy wedding ring wrapped snug around his finger.
The boat looked like a giant stall, Steve realized. Or one of those gates that racehorses were penned up in before they burst out onto the track. Steve imagined what they were feeling now was similar to what those big horses felt. The loud sounds of breathing, the seething of waves, the slick metal deck beneath them. The cramped quarters that were as comforting as they were suffocating.
“I hope you go to bed and think about my suffering child while you drift off to dreamland,” Tony said petulantly. “Sweet dreams.”
Steve put on a cracked smile. He turned his gaze to Peter first. “I’m just fine, Peter. If you want to live at your dad’s, let’s do it.” He gave a nonchalant shrug. “I agree that it’s what’s best for this internship and for you and your friends to be close, so let’s not make it a big deal, yeah?” He paused, but spoke again before anyone could interrupt. “This is already too much of a big deal—it’s my fault, I know. I’m just a little upset about losing you, Pete, but I’ll get over it. It’s important for you to be able to take advantage of all of these opportunities.”
“You’re not the first parent to have a kid with a fever, you know,” Bruce reminded him. “She’s going to be fine, I promise. If it gets worse, you’ll know and you can call me.”
Tony hoped Steve’s heartbeat was faster now, that his skin was cold with the pressure to impress him, to fix his daughter and save the day.
Something wet hit him on the cheek and Tony jumped in the booth, touching his cheek. Something slimy was there, and he made a face of disgust until he saw Steve smirking at him, his straw bobbing in his mouth like a cigar.
“Great,” Tony said with a false smile. “Now get out of my house. We’ll discuss living arrangements after we see how the reveal goes.”
“That’s what I said,” Steve murmured, thumbing at Tony’s hips. “It won’t be too long, though. It’ll fly by, then I’ll be back and we can figure all of this out.”
“Yes, please,” Steve said, his throat closing up. His eyes were hot with tears, which made him feel even more stupid. God, he needed out of here. “Quickly, please.”
He couldn’t catch sight of Tony or Peter, so Steve resigned himself to reading news articles on his phone. Nobody wanted to talk to him here, and evidently he wasn’t allowed to talk to Tony or Jackson yet.
An uneasy sound left Steve’s throat that might have been a chuckle if not for the tightness of his chest.
“No,” Bucky said, and Steve could feel the vibration of his vocal chords. “You did every last thing you could to help them and they fucked you over every time. You were just tryin’ to get better and it never worked ‘cause they won’t stop hurtin’ you. It ain’t your fault.”
“I like the guy,” Tony snapped without malice. “Yes, like-like, crushy-wushy, he can be my valentine shit.”
“Easy there, Cap,” Tony warned. “I know you like to get all handsy before deployment, but that’s not in the cards today.”
Tony nodded in return, but his eyes drifted to the window behind Rhodey. The view wasn’t great, but Rhodey had always been more about looking at books on military history than staring out the window.
Steve reached over and ruffled his hair. “You can sleep if you want. I know you don’t get enough at night.”
Steve heard the clink of a Zippo and looked over to Emory, who had the letter dangling between two fingers as he lit the paper on fire.
“I’ll close out.” He fished out a hundred dollar bill. “That should cover it, I’d say. Keep the change.”
At least, that was how Steve remembered it, but he hadn’t really been paying attention on that Saturday. Maybe it was actually rainy and miserable, but he couldn’t say for sure. He had been in too many countries too many times during that week.
Steve felt a buzzing in his pocket, and his heart started to beat right out of his chest. “Daddy’s calling right now,” he informed his son, pulling out his phone. Only Tony had the number here.
“You should come! It’s not just painting, we actually haven’t really painted anything yet. We sketch, mostly.”
He paused for a moment when he noticed the old-fashioned, drooping lamps that hung overhead. They were cast iron, shaped like bulbous cages—and he had
“Release the hostage!” Steve screamed. “Drop your weapon or I swear to fucking God I’ll rip you in half!”
“One second, Peter. Everything’s fine,” Tony called back before standing up himself. He was frustrated, with his hands curling into fists and then uncurling again at his sides. “Come with us, Steve. Just come stay the night at the penthouse, in a guest room, and we can figure all of this out.”
The finesse of his movement slid away, returning him to mortality as he put the tablet away and got to his feet. Steve could see the beginnings of age in the way he moved, the slight intake of breath as his body prepared for pain.  A man like him wasn’t meant to take repeated beatings.
- into his arms, gentle and slow, as though jostling him would wake him from slumber. He tucked Tony’s head under his chin, pulled him close, found bare skin on the back of Tony’s neck and pressed his hand against it, putting everything he had into trying to
Tony’s eyes met his. A tear slipped from one of them. Tony tried to speak again, and Steve leaned down to listen, but couldn’t hear anything.
Strange studied him, puzzled. He’d expected gratitude. Joy, even. Relief at having made it through certain death. This bizarre rage and fear that had apparently taken over the engineer was completely unexpected and frankly unnerving. If Strange didn’t have complete confidence in his own abilities he could almost believe he might have gotten something wrong during the ritual.
The crack was small. Miniscule. But if he took the ridiculous-looking instrument he’d managed to cobble together and prised it open-
She closed the book, sliding it back onto the desk. “It does. We need to warn the guards, the King-”
All of it fell back to him. He could see in Bruce’s eyes that he accepted that, even if he wished it weren’t true. He broke away to pick up one of his notebooks, trying to appear unconcerned.
The guy was surprised. He was, after all, the only person in the cafe, and Steve’s eyes darted away so he could pretend to focus on writing the guy’s order on his cup, as though it was totally normal and necessary.
Hooo, boy. My chapters just keep getting longer and longer. By the time we get to the end of this I'll be writing entire novels for each one.
Her telescope was situated in a tower well above the rest of the Academy, far from the pollution of the occasional street lamp and roaring fires inside the dorm rooms below.
“I didn’t think he knew,” Steve said, wringing the dish towel and turning his back to the cafe at large, pretending to wipe down some of the cups that were already dry. “I, uh-“
“No,” Steve gasped, his voice breaking. He cradled Tony’s cheek with a trembling hand. “Tony, don’t- don’t do this. I need you, you need to come back, I- I can’t-”
“Sweetie,” Hammer said, launching out of his seat and putting his arm around her shoulders. He snatched one of the pages of notes she had to prove her suspicions, perusing it with disdain. “I know you think you’re right, but it’s simply
He needed the tesseract. He needed to place it by the giant creature’s side and destroy it, force an explosion as large as the one he’d triggered five years ago, a blast of magic so strong and so potent that even a giant lumbering beast of a brain couldn’t possibly survive.
He carefully picked up the stone with a pair of heavily warded tongs and carried it to the magic circle on the other side of the room. In the soft, flickering candlelight he lowered the stone into its new home, the safest place Strange could think of, and snapped the specially made casing closed.
Through the portal he could see something behind the flood of Chitauri flowing through. It was a huge, hulking thing - slightly organic looking - but clearly placed far enough from the portal to be safe from any hope of attack. Tony had no way of knowing
Steve spotted a town in the distance and picked up pace, a sense of urgency driving him despite the echoing reminder in the back of his head that
to make sure I’m dead in the ground - which he almost managed, rightfully so, until you decided to fuck it all up!”
Tony scoffed and looked away, eyes glistening in the flickering light of the fire. “He has been hunting Iron Man for years, Strange. And now he’s found out that Iron Man, the famous mass murderer and person responsible for his best friend’s death, is the very same person he has been spending the night with on a regular basis. If nothing else he has a responsibility
The reaction was instantaneous. All the Chitauri, as one, turned to look at where the portal had been. Steve was spotted, and at least a dozen Chitauri launched themselves in the King’s direction.
“I’m looking for an artist,” Tony told him, his eyes warm in the early morning light. “I heard there was a pretty decent one here. Turns out I’m an attention whore who really likes being a life model and I’m thinking of taking it up as a career.”
Tony stared up at the shelves that lined the workshop walls, for once unsure exactly where he should begin. He knew what he was looking for. He had a vaguely half-formed list of projects that might be useful, if he had actually invented gotten around to inventing them. There were likely dozens of useful prototypes scattered across the walls. The problem, however, was that there were
“… Very well,” Carol continued, eyes narrowed at the audience, who had began to stir again. “Prosecution?”
The pacing man had a hand pressed to his mouth, another hugging his stomach, eyes red rimmed and puffy but fiercely determined, and the angel loved them.
“I… A skrull was here, pretending to be Clint. It asked how to work the tessaract, and I… I told them how to shut it off.”
He didn’t really realise he was drawing the man in the corner until he looked up, trying to compare the way the guy’s hand was clutched possessively around his cup. He coughed, and tried to busy himself around the coffee machine, hoping he hadn’t been caught.
Tony didn’t move, cradled as he was in Steve’s arms, and Steve felt himself shatter, the pieces resting just as broken as the magical shards that surrounded them.
Tony tore his eyes away. It didn’t matter - he was dead anyway. He gasped another breath to suppress a sob and tried not to think of how Steve would probably publicly denounce him, how he would likely have him named an official traitor to the crown. He would move on, and find someone new - someone better, someone pure - and Tony would become nothing more than a mass murderer in everyone’s minds.
Bucky looked up at the woman, his expression wretched, and opened his mouth as though to say something - but the woman was resolutely not looking at him, so he closed it again and looked away.
It took him a second to realise the guy was gesturing to the free seat on the other side of Steve’s booth. He coughed, and nodded, and his muse slid into the seat with languid grace.
. “The prince took back his throne once I cleared his name. I suspect Captain Rogers has resumed his previous post by now.”
He looked up. Tony hadn’t moved an inch. Tony inwardly wondered why - Steve’s eyes hadn’t been on him, but somehow moving had still felt utterly impossible.
Tony saw the source of the problem the moment he crested the walls. On the other side of the river stood a portal, a hundred feet high, through which Chitauri were still spilling in droves. He saw a collection of them
The man’s face fell into despair for a moment. Then the man gathered himself again, opened his eyes, and started to pace back to the room. “Come back to the chapel, Tony,” he said, and he turned to walk back to the little room on the hill.
Bucky snapped to awareness the moment the dungeon door clicked shut, and within moments he had taken stock of what little he had on him. There weren’t really any useful weapons around him, nothing beside his own body and the clothes he was wearing. He could probably use his boot laces as a garrotte, he mused, if he managed to get them off in time.
Steve shrugged, suddenly embarrassed. “Yeah. I tried it, after you died. Every night, for a while. Trying to find something, some kind of message from you.”
” He let his notebook fall to the workbench with a resounding thud. “I made hundreds of blueprints, Bruce. Most of them things like… like body scanners, or portals, or air transport. But of course, out of all the useless, harmless shit I designed, he managed to get his hands on one of the weapons.
Tony stopped wriggling. A moment later he pressed a kiss into the junction between Steve’s jaw and neck and nuzzled closer.
The man’s eyes opened. They were desperately sad, and scared, and there was a shadow of something else there that Anthony didn’t recognise. He sighed, and nodded, and promised he would find something, and when he left the world around Anthony became dimmer.
Usually the mornings were a dead shift at the start; the rush typically started at around 6:30, so the earliest parts of the morning were lovely and Steve had barely enough time to
He stared down at the notes in his hand for a moment, as though trying to decipher exactly how they had ended up in his possession. “… So I take it this is a bad time?”
, now, half choking on each breath, so Tony leapt to his feet and was there to meet the next attacker with a snarl.
Steve blinked as he considered it. Not long ago he’d dreamed of abdicating, letting someone else take the throne and its heavy burden from his shoulders. He would have rejoined the guard, taken a simple wage. He and Tony would get married, in a small ceremony, and they would live together in Tony’s estate, slowly turning it into a real home. Every night, after his last shift, he would collect his husband from the workshop and escort him home, and they would tumble into bed together. They would watch wrinkles gradually appear at the corners of their eyes for every bit of laughter they shared.
He glanced up from rifling through one of the shelves, an arm already cradling three half finished devices - weapons he had been working on when he was kidnapped. He handed them off to Bruce, vaguely aware that the man was quiet and pale. He climbed the next rung of the ladder and surveyed the mess on the next shelf with derision. “Have you seen the prototype for Clint’s hearing aids? I have an idea.”
“I don’t know,” he said, his voice breaking a little. He looked up at the horizon, just above the storm, searching for something he didn’t expect to find. Then he saw it, written in a scrawl Steve recognised from plans he’d found in the workshop.
He didn’t hear any movement, and he pushed away the itching anxiety that crept up the back of his neck as a result. Tony normally
“Is that true?” Carol asked Bucky. He hesitated, as though about to say something. Strange’s thumb dug even deeper into his shoulder, though, so he simply nodded slowly.
He remembered why he couldn’t touch anyone - that if he did, they would be flung back through time and space.
Anthony wasn’t sure where ‘here’ was, only that it was ‘here’, and there were other places, but this was where he needed to stay.
He was surprised, when he came across a road, to see what he recognised as a modern hatchback speeding along it. He waved the car down, unsure what to think, and asked the woman who stopped what the date was. She told him, with a strong Scandinavian accent.
By the time Steve reached the portal machine he could already feel his body healing, the scrapes and bruises stinging slightly less than they did before. He could hear some muffled sounds, now - cheers, maybe. Screams. He didn’t
It was a quiet murmur breathed gently into Steve’s ear, but it was enough to rouse him. He smiled and turned his head toward brown curls to kiss the forehead he found there. “They can wait.”
No. Instead the hearing aids sat in Clint’s nightstand, where he’d abandoned them, entirely useless but working
“Sure, Tony.” Bruce glanced up, in time to catch Tony’s triumphant grin. “Show me what you need from me.”
The portal was surrounded, but as Tony soared through the sky above the battle he could still pick out individuals in the fray. Thor launched into the air, propelled by his hammer, and brought down a stampede of Chitauri with one blow to the ground beneath their feet. Hawkeye was perched upon the castle ramparts, launching specially designed arrows that exploded on impact. Natasha was holding the gates to the city, Carol at her side, the two of them seamlessly working through the mass that was quickly descending upon the city entrance.
Tony let his head fall into his hands and stared at the untouched meal in front of him. “I still can’t go back.”
This is a big, angsty mess of a chapter involving battle. Check the end notes for specific content warnings.
Steve could feel the blush that spread across his cheeks and down his neck. “I’ll be sure to give you some, uh, warning.” he offered. “Next time. If I must.”
The room held its breath as the odd little machine whirred to life in Bruce’s hand and eventually issued a single beep. Bruce turned the display so the Captain could see its reading.
“I trust you,” Tony whispered. “I trust you and Thor, and I need you to keep this quiet. You never brought me here.”
He stifled a coughing fit and pulled the sketchbook closer, propping his head up on his pillow and trying to arrange himself comfortably enough that he could still sketch lying down.
This time, however, it bounced exactly the way Tony had planned, soaring toward the target and leaving a deep dent at the bullseye. Steve caught it as it flew back toward him.
. But.” He pressed his hands onto Bruce’s shoulders, gave them a squeeze. “This is my fault, Bruce.”
Steve moved to steady her, but she stubbornly pushed him away. “Steve,” she said, gripping his shoulders. “Listen to me. They’re coming. Hydra. The army is - it’s still tiny, but it’s moving, and it’s transporting something.”
Anthony couldn’t respond. He was kneeling in front of the man, hand hovering over the man’s forehead, desperately wanting to gently tease the man’s fingers from where they were buried in blond hair.
“It’s okay. Really.” Tony tugged a box from one of the shelves and flipped through the files inside. “You’re doing your best.”
The perfect clarity would have been glaringly obvious, a welcome relief from the muffled echoes he had quickly become accustomed to since Tony had died and his magic had faded. Perhaps he would have investigated. He might have taken them to Bruce, who would have been puzzled and alarmed, and eventually suspicious. The doctor may have spread the word to Tony’s loved ones, and whispers of Tony’s possible survival would have rustled through the streets like autumn leaves in the wind. Perhaps they would have exhumed his grave to discover it was empty, with detectible traces of magic heavy in the silk lining. Maybe they would have noticed that Jarvis, the only person who tended to the body after his master died, was slightly less grief stricken than one would typically expect. Maybe they would have remembered the haste with which Strange had left the city immediately before the funeral.
“I just… I don’t know which one. I was so sure I destroyed everything, Bruce. How do I built adequate defences against Hydra’s coming attack if I don’t know what it will be?”
Strange passed behind the statue, his hands glowing, and the relic began to glow in kind. He paced slowly back down the steps, following the arc of the awkwardly drawn circle, and slowed to a stop before it. He stood for a moment, finishing his incantation, as his hands and the relic reached a painful brightness.
They had argued that morning. An hour of shouting, of tears and righteous anger, before Bucky finally agreed and told Steve to leave. They hadn’t fought in years, not since they were children. Steve stared at him, jaw tense, all too aware that Bucky could defy him now and there would be nothing Steve could do-
The joy and hope that flooded through him is intoxicating, and he grinned as he offered the woman everything she could possibly ever want or need if she could just get him to the airport. On the way, he borrowed her phone.
to sway and fall where he stood. He felt Steve recover and climb to his feet and let the king take his back, but just as fiercely fought anything that came within reach, a desperation and frantic need to protect his king and his people overwhelming even the worst of his magic poisoning. He could feel the darkness swelling within him - the gaping maw that stood in his place, the
Steve was too mortified to reply, and Bruce’s friendly amusement turned to concern as he swept up the last of the broken ceramic. “What’s wrong?”
Steve didn’t voice any of this. Instead, he smiled. “I’m sure you and your students have made admirable progress,” he said. “Send over your devices first thing tomorrow and they will be duly considered. Now - Stark. I understand you have an invention?”
“She was working as a guard at the river docks. I- I wanted to surprise her and take her to dinner, so I’d brought her flowers, and-” she blushed. “She was excited. Said she knew just the place, and that she would meet with the other guards to hand over her shift on the way there. We’d started walking together, but she heard a yell coming from one of the ships, and-” She ground to a halt. Looked down at her feet. Took a deep, slow breath. “She told me to stay where I was. Said she was the guard, and she had to make sure everything was okay. She went up into that ship, and I heard her yell, and I heard a fight. She had told me to leave, but I didn’t. I... I stayed, and I tried to find something to use as a weapon, but then the fighting stopped.
was nothing, he was worthless, he was a burden to everyone he loved, and perhaps it was time he gave in.
“Thing is, Stevie, Strange lied today. I kept the Winter Soldier’s magic when the spell was broken. The only reason my arm didn’t work was because Tony disconnected it before we returned.” He shrugged, looking away. “It was causing me pain.”
He felt it the night before, thankfully, and though he was determined to work whenever he could even he could recognise he shouldn’t be working with food while unwell.
Echoed faintly through his mind, and it took it several seconds to understand that they were asking it a question. The person - the one with blond hair and blue eyes that the angel was somehow infinitely happy to see - was holding something, holding it out, close to the angels face, eyes closed, face twisted up in some kind of emotion that the angel didn’t recognise but still hated. A strange mixture of hope and desperation. Despair.
He tried again and missed. His hands were shaking too much to hold the shield steady. He adjusted his grip, struggling to breathe.
Steve swallowed and looked down at the shield in his hands. It was as shiny and unmarred as ever, glinting innocently in the sunlight. “I didn’t have enough magic then,” he muttered, wiping a hand over his mouth. Clint didn’t seem to catch the implication of that, though, seemingly puzzled. [What?] he signed. [Again?]
It melted away, dissolved into the air, leaving him gasping and bleeding and half naked on the ground. He clenched his eyes closed, unwilling to witness the moment when Steve understood who he was. He heard a sword clatter to the ground. A thud, as Steve crashed to his own knees in front of him. Rough hands grabbed his shoulders and Tony finally opened his eyes. Steve’s face was flickering through confusion, despair, fear, too fast enough for Tony to follow, especially through the tears that were gathering in his eyes.
Steve shook his head, his smile wry and fond. “He might be a little eccentric sometimes, but he’s one of the best men I know.”
Steve asked him about an artefact, and something in the back of Anthony’s head was screaming, reaching, desperate to get out. The man was waiting for an answer, a strange black object - a phone? - in his hand.
He stood back to regard it, head tilted to the side. The solution wasn’t immediately obvious, so he took it from his easel and propped it against his door in the hallway, pacing backwards to look at it again.
Anthony had tried climbing over the fence, but hadn’t gotten very far. He knew he had to be careful, he knew that the eyes of humans were dangerous, he didn’t know exactly how they were, or why, but he knew to avoid them, and so the man who had appeared on the other side of the fence Anthony had been about to climb made him freeze.
Fun fact: I've had that conversation between Tony and Strange written since before I posted the prologue. If it weren't for the fact that this chapter is
“NO!” A moment later Steve he realised he had slammed a fist onto the table. He carefully unfolded it and let his hand lie flat on the wood. “No. No citizen will be forced to sacrifice their lives. Our people will journey home from Asgard to find Marvel safe and whole. Now, Stark-” He met Tony’s worried eyes across the room, unable to ignore the light flutter in his chest. They hadn’t had a moment together since Peggy had arrived home two weeks prior. “- I understand you have some new developments for our strike team.”
It had been a while since he’d last asked her for access to the archives. It was a secured room hidden behind ancient locks and had a detailed list of each citizen with magic, their powers, and who they had killed to gain them. At least, it was
“I didn’t mean it,” he whispered, pressing the words into Tony’s neck, right over where his pulse should have been. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know.”
You might think I know what I’m doing, but this fic is running away from me and I’m pretty sure I’m herding cats right now.
“You know what? Stay.” Steve motioned toward the bed. “I’m not him and I never will be, but if I can give you some sort of comfort, I will.”
Aside from training new recruits, he was also in charge of testing them. HYDRA had given him numerous skills (thinking about how bad a soldier he had been back in World War II made him cringe), and he had taken it upon himself to train his students to a similar caliber. Enhanced enemies were becoming a greater threat, and, having been one himself, Bucky knew what lengths they would go to complete the mission. No corners could be cut.
Steve’s eyes flicked open, and he was surprised to find Tony awake and alert, tablet in hand. He rested against the headboard, tapping away.
Tony couldn’t fight the warmth in his chest when he heard that, but he shook his head. “That’s still not okay. That’s like, a big red flag for abusive relationships—why did you put up with that?”
“Daddy and I love you,” Steve told his little son. “You’re ours. You’re my Petey, not hers. You’re my Petey.”
Steve could only see how happy everyone was. Of course, there was a twist in his gut that came with the sight, because he knew that something terrible had happened. His brow furrowed slightly, and he peered closer.
With a sip of wine and a simultaneous motion for the DJ to hand him the mic, Tony was soon standing right on the stage, right where he knew he should be. Where he belonged.
He had his friends, sure, but he would be alone for the rest of his impossibly long life. He had made the decision to save Peter from abuse and to save Tony from becoming an abuser. Success had come with a price had hadn’t been prepared to pay. Not like this. Not ending up with an ex-husband who never let go and a son that despised him.
“If you’re asking me whether or not I heard you and whoever you brought over last night, I didn’t. I’m two floors down.” Steve took a quick sip of orange juice.
With what was definitely a high schooler’s maturity level, Tony found himself daydreaming away his time with Steve when they did things together, like stop off at a shitty diner in New Jersey on the way back from a training session.  Steve had decided to step away from training the new Avengers for a few months, which at first had everyone worried until they remembered that this was the first time Bucky had admitted to feeling “back to normal.” Tony used normal loosely with that guy, but Bucky was at least in a place where nobody had to worry about him killing anyone.
There were a few other texts: one from Sam, one from Bucky, a picture from Natasha presumably taken inside a fancy nightclub in an effort to get him to come along.
Emory pulled away from his scope to give him a smile. “Quadruple kill. Nice. Six hundred yards.” He lifted a hand.
“I think so,” Steve said with a nod. He held up his hand, showing off the vibranium band, a single line of red titanium alloy running around the center. “Are you?”
“Okay,” he finally relented. If Peter wanted him to try it, then maybe he should. “I’ll try it out.”
“Steve,” Rhodey said kind of loudly. He looked over to where Pepper was showing a family past the entrance. A pained smile came to his face. “Invitation?”
Steve leaned over, kissing Tony in a way he swore he could feel on his own lips. That shoulder camera should have been on already, giving him a better indication of the message behind that kiss. He’d gotten very good at reading the visual over the past few years, even if he couldn’t feel it.
He laughed, quietly, at the guy’s pose - but eventually pulled out his sketchpad and pencil, happy that he could finally draw his muse without worrying about him noticing.
He didn’t hear the bell jingle, because he’d started grinding a new blend, so when he turned back to the counter a few minutes later he almost dropped everything he was holding in surprise.
“I am APPALLED,” Tony said, rising from his chair. “Appalled and shocked and dismayed at this betrayal-”
“Steve,” Anthony said. It sounded like the rumble of falling stones, of wind on an old brick building.
Steve does’t even register moving; he just launches himself into the circle, ignoring the annoyed squawk from Strange and the excited yell from Clint, and sweeps Tony up into a hug that could have cracked stone if he hadn’t held back a little. It’s a huge relief to feel that movement, the half-hearted struggling in his arms that quickly turns into laughter and a pat on Steve’s shoulders. The team is there, crashing together in a what Clint would later call “A group hug to end all group hugs”, and Steve’s cheek is nestled firmly in Tony’s soft, human curls.
It started the way it always did - a pin prick of cold above his heart that spread like cracks through ice, the physical sensation almost mundane to him - but it exploded into an agony Steve had never felt before when he realised what it meant. Magic - the unspent life force of a person who died too early - was passed on to the person who killed them.
I wrote the first bit without ever planning on continuing it, hence the plot holes several miles wide.
Tony nodded. The device in his lap beeped and they both glanced down at the number 697 flashing on its screen. Tony’s hand shook. “More than I thought,” Tony breathed. “This is going to hurt.”
Clint scattered a few more seeds across the roof and watched the flock descend in a flurry of feathers and angry cries.
Steve had wanted to speak to Bucky, but the prince had been placed back under guard with only Strange allowed in to see him. Steve’d heard some kind of muffled argument filtering through the door where the guards had held him at bay, but couldn’t understand a word of it. The sorcerer must have been muffling all noise.
Still. It was possible. Strange narrowed his eyes, considering his course of action. He could lie, try to placate the engineer - but something told him that was only going to end badly.
But then Tony explodes back into life from within the cloud, an instantaneous eruption of movement and energy and soft, human skin.
“The artefact,” the man whispered, and somehow the name ‘Steve’ floated into Anthony’s - Tony’s? - head. The man’s breath brushed over Tony’s lips, and he wondered what it was like to breathe. “You know where it is. Please. Describe it. Tell me where it is, or what it looks like, or how we can find it. Anything.”
“Bruce. Brucie-bear. Keep a little context! Who was the one who got us into this mess in the first place? Who’s the person who discovered how to get it to work in the first place? Who created the blueprints of… of whatever it is they’re making? All you’ve done is told them how to make the damn tessaract itself stop working. That’s nothing!”
“Uh, good,” Steve said. “Really good.” He couldn’t help the way his eyes strayed to Tony, before averting back down to the newspaper.
“Well, then,” Kray continued. “Blade will do his worst, and then we’ll see if you’re feeling any differently on the matter.” Blade grinned at Steve, his blood dripping from the knife. “I don’t particularly enjoy the screams, so I’ll be back once I feel you’ve had your fair share of them,” Kray finished.
Tony let Steve continue to explore his ‘handsome but few’ wrinkles, amused. “Steve Rogers, do you have an age kink? I think I’m scandalised. But also, not complaining.”
Steve rubbed his hands over his knees. “Well, just like you say, sir. I’m a soldier,” Steve started. “And I have a certain ability to...compartmentalize these things, I guess. Tony...well, I just don’t think it would be good for him- for his health- to dwell on what happened. Not before he’s ready.”
Tony started rubbing his forehead in frustration. “I can’t seem to locate Kray. I’ve tried everything that usually works- tracking telephone lines, credit card transactions, traffic cameras- but he’s not showing up anywhere. And I know SHIELD is probably not telling us everything. Maybe they even know where Kray is. Maybe they even have him in custody and don’t want us to interfere. Wouldn’t surprise me at all...”
He decided not to respond, hoping that Steve would be convinced he was in fact asleep. The effort was probably futile, but Tony liked to humor himself that he could still get away with some little things.
Steve nodded thoughtfully, glancing again at the irritated skin. “If I could give you the healing factor, I would,” Steve said honestly.
Thor pulled away from the hug and looked around them. “Ah, Tony! His intelligence never fails to surprise me,” Thor said. “Without him we could not have found you.”
Steve was relishing in bringing Tony right to the edge before backing off. And Tony would complain if he had any words besides Steve’s name, over and over again. He was clinging to Steve wherever he could reach in the moment, but nothing was enough. He didn’t know if he’d ever feel like anything was enough. Or if he’d always yearn for more.
Steve sighed, not surprised necessarily by Tony’s summary, but always taken aback by his flippant tone in these situations. “Tony, the team is looking for us now, I’m sure. We’re gonna get through this, just like always,” Steve said.
“Steve,” Tony said, breaking him out of his thoughts. “Something Kray said earlier got me thinking.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve forced the words out. “You don’t have to...justify yourself to me.” He knew a rejection when he heard one.
“Breakfast?” Steve asked. Tony nodded, but before Steve could pull away, Tony tugged him into a deep and thorough kiss that left both of them panting.
Steve reached up and smoothed away a few loose strands of hair from Tony’s face, trailing his fingers down to rest against his cheek.
Steve nodded and looked back down at the crossword, before realizing he hadn’t even brought a pencil with him. He looked back up at Tony, who was studying Steve with a curious expression. He handed Steve a pen and leaned his elbows on the desk in front of Steve.
Steve dropped the plate in the sink, likely breaking it, and turned toward Tony. “And tell you what, Tony? What could I say? You’ve already made up your mind.”
“You can’t seriously expect me to calmly watch you get tortured, Cap. I’m not that heartless,” Tony said flippantly.
“‘The 15th most common street name in the U.S., as of 1993’,” Steve recited, glancing around the workshop before spotting a chair and dragging it over.
Steve could survive without food or water for longer than the average human, but Tony would only last three or four days without water. He hoped to God it wouldn’t come to that. They needed Tony alive, so they’d have to give him water eventually.
Steve took a moment before responding to think about what it would be like for him, watching them torture Tony, knowing that if he gave in, Tony’s pain would stop. Steve realized he would’ve given up hours ago.
“It’s almost all healed now,” Steve said, referring to the burn. Steve’s eyes flitted up to see Tony nod slowly.
Steve nodded, satisfied. “It’s not just me, Tony,” Steve added, quietly. “You may pretend like you only care about yourself, sometimes, but you’re one of the most selfless people I know.” Tony gave a small, self-deprecating laugh, but Steve interrupted him. “No, don’t do that. Don’t brush it off,” Steve said. “I’ve rarely seen someone so dedicated to helping the world be a safer place. It’s why you’re an Avenger.”
“Just...thought of some improvements I could make to the suit,” Tony lied. He didn’t even know why, just that he didn’t want to give too much away of his true feelings. He was pretty sick of listening to his own thoughts, let alone repeating them out loud.
“Together?” Steve finished for him. “Yeah, I’d- I’d say so.” Steve smiled at Tony, and tried not to ogle too much at his forearms in front of Bruce.
And that was what it was like in those weeks. Working until he couldn’t any longer- until he had to sleep, or else collapse. Waking after some hours from dreams that left him gasping from the anxiety. Avoiding Pepper and Rhodey’s more and more frequent looks of increasing concern. Trying not to break down in public.
Steve recalled what he’d first thought of Stark when he’d met him- a man who was so arrogant, always mouthing off, seemed ill-suited for a spot on the Avengers. But then they’d moved in, Steve and the team. Tony was always working on upgrades for his own armor, but also for the rest of the team. It was his way of doing the best he could to protect the people they were responsible for. Steve had slowly begun to understand that almost everything Tony did was for others. It was only his outer countenance that he made appear self absorbed.
There was silence as Steve looked into Tony’s cell, where Tony was on his knees looking in Steve’s direction but not seeming to really see him. His eyes were glazed and he looked so tired. Steve ached in his chest, and it wasn’t because of the knife wounds.
Steve raised his eyebrows and shook his head. Was that a real youtube channel? Steve sometimes couldn’t tell if Tony was just messing with him.
Kray turned his attention to Steve with a disinterested glance. “Blade, you’ve worked hard enough today, I think,” Kray said. “Take your toys, but leave them with something to think about.”
And Tony didn’t make him wait long, attaching his lips to Steve’s and tugging him by the hip until Steve was pressing Tony against the counter. Steve groaned and let one hand wander along Tony’s back, the other coming up to frame his jaw, fingers scratching against his beard. Tony was doing a very good job of completely mussing up Steve’s hair while also maintaining his iron grip on Steve’s hip. Not to mention the tongue that was currently gliding against Steve’s, causing heat to build in his stomach and...lower. Tony was very good at this.
He swept out of the cell without another look, leaving the two men in Steve’s cell and the two others in Tony’s, plus two outside the cells guarding the doors. Steve took a deep breath to prepare himself.
“Are you kidding me?” Tony said, instead of voicing the thoughts swirling through his mind. “Yes. Beach. It’s perfect. I have some trunks you can borrow.” Steve’s smile was so pleased that Tony felt he might be spending the rest of his life trying to make it reappear at every opportunity.
“Tony,” Steve sounded long-suffering, but his mouth was pulling up at the corners. “You’re insufferable.” But he was letting himself be tugged. Tony laid all the way back as Steve’s six-foot-two frame covered him, his forearms coming to frame Tony’s face.
Tony sent Steve a fond look and tugged the hand he was holding to his lips, pressing a firm kiss to the skin there, squeezing his eyes shut as he did so.  Steve smiled and wrapped his other hand around Tony’s after he’d placed them back on the bed.
“You have nothing to make up for, Tony. I’m sure when you find out what went wrong, you’ll realize there was nothing we could’ve done to stop it. And I know you’ll make the Tower’s defenses even stronger after this because that’s what you do,” Steve said. “The team somehow breaks your incredible inventions all the time, and you find a way to make it so they can never break it the same way twice.”
Tony blew out a breath and collapsed onto a nearby stool, running his hands down his face. There was a reason he wasn’t sleeping, but it was easier to drown himself in work and suit upgrades than it was to address the real problem. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that giant wormhole into space, felt it closing around him, watched as aliens- aliens- invaded New York. It was so beyond everything he’d understood about the world, and he felt like it was only just catching up with him.
“Uhh, ‘I Think I Smell ‘blank,’ by the White Stripes’?” Steve knew for a fact that no amount of thinking would reveal that answer to him.
“I like it,” Steve said, after he’d swallowed his bite. The wind was gently ruffling his hair, still wet from the quick shower he’d had after his run. “Much warmer here than in DC. Or New York, for that matter.”
After agonizing seconds of simply staring at the elevator number slowly reach seven, Steve took a deep breath before emerging into the waiting room.  He needed to calm down.  Tony only had minor injuries; there was no need for him to tear the place apart in his haste to reach him.
The light finally turned green and Steve sped toward the hospital.  The amount of time it had taken Steve to drive there had given him time to think, and he’d realized that the whole thing didn’t make sense.  He knew for a fact that all of Tony’s cars had Jarvis installed in them to take over the wheel in case of emergency or potential accident, just as Jarvis had taken over the Iron Man suit many times in combat when Tony was incapacitated or injured too severely.  Not only that, but Tony had also built safety codes into all his cars that would pull them over if Tony became compromised in any way.
They both quickly reacted, Steve with his fists and Tony with...a repulsor? Steve focused on dodging bullets and knocking out his assailants, which got easier after he acquired one’s gun and was able to incapacitate the others. Upon closer inspection, Tony had rigged a repulsor like device in his palm that had wires running up his arm and under his shirt to the reactor.
“I- I don’t know, Steve. I’m just trying to figure shit out,” Tony said. “I don’t understand how any of this happened. How did they plant that bomb in my lab? How did they get in the tower? How did they even know I’d be in there at six in the morning?”
“Rogers, we need you back in DC. A...situation has developed. I debated whether to tell you over the phone, but it might be the only way to get your ass into high-gear,” Fury paused, and neither Steve or Tony breathed in the short silence. “We’ve found Barnes. Or rather, he’s found us. And yes, I mean your buddy from the forties. He’s here, he’s alive, and he’s very unhappy to see us.”
“Hey, how are you liking the Golden State?” Tony asked. Steve was currently leaning his elbows on the stone railing, bent over and watching the waves crash against the rocks as he ate an apple. From where Tony was laying in the lounge chair behind Steve, he was enjoying an entirely different view that was no less pleasing.
He glanced at the car’s clock again and tapped his fingers against the wheel with impatience and worry.  Apparently, Tony had been in an accident hours ago, but no one had called to notify him, or any of the other Avengers for that matter, until fifteen minutes ago.  The doctor had said that the injuries were relatively minor, so it made sense to Steve that they wouldn’t think it prudent.  But on the other hand, Tony had left the tower without telling anyone.  The fact that the team hadn’t known where he was, and yet no one at the hospital had taken the time to call made Steve’s stomach churn.
Tony shook his head and got back to work. He just needed to finish tweaking some things with Mark 42 before he could be done for the night.
They were both breathing heavily, Tony’s hand hot on Steve’s lower back. “If you try to tell me you’re not interested now,” Steve said, his voice gravelly. “I don’t think I’d believe you.” Tony laughed and clutched Steve harder.
He raised the shield one last time, faintly aware that this was likely his last chance before he faded completely. He could see Steve in his peripheral vision, could hear when the king screamed his name.
Bruce gave him an odd look, crouching to fish the dustpan and broom from their place under the counter. “He said he liked being your muse, or something.” Bruce took in Steve’s quickly reddening face with an amused smirk. “Are you dating him?”
It was peaceful here, quiet. He liked it, though something itched, between his shoulder blades, on the back of his neck, in the knuckles of his stone fingers; something was missing, he knew it, but he didn’t understand what, or how.
He had just been about to ask Tony about himself, but the bell rang as a gaggle of schoolgirls flooded into the room and he had to jump up to serve them.
A man with golden horns, a fight in the sky, flying and falling, blue eyes reaching him too late, far too late, but just in time. For one last promise.
“Huh,” Carol said, her mouth crooking up on one side. “Dead on. You could have set it to do that, though.”
He coughed, frowning, and tried to sit up, but immediately slumped back to the ground when a wave of vertigo slammed into him. There were dead Chitauri around him, scattered wide across the battlefield, Marvel soldiers picking their way between them and checking for any signs of life. He tried to call for help, but he couldn’t hear his own voice over the ringing in his ears.
He stepped back, humming in satisfaction. He raised his arms, letting power ripple across his skin and arc against the sigils he’d etched into the hardwood floors. He spoke, the spell falling easily from his lips with the care and practice he’d poured into it over the past few days, his voice rising to compete with the deafening crackle of magic that filled the room.
Tony’s nose scrunched up when Steve gently prodded him awake; his face slipped into a frown of annoyance before Steve slipped a freshly made cup into his hand. “On the house,” Steve told him. “Since you’re so tired today.”
?” Bucky hissed, launching to his feet. He pulled at the bars, teeth clenched in wild frustration. “WHAT DID YOU DO!?”
Tony seemed deep in thought by the time they reached the archives and Jane ushered him through. He moved immediately down the stacks and she followed him, eyeing the way he pressed a palm against his chest.
There were far too many of them. Marvel had already been outnumbered. Soldiers were falling like flies to groups of the enemy that operated as one.
Steve lost himself in a half-asleep daze, stroking Tony’s shoulder with a thumb and watching as the clouds through the eastern window were gradually gilded with sunlight. The colours of the room around them, faded with age and lack of care, slowly crept back into view.
Bucky carefully avoided his gaze, mouth twisted in guilt and shame. “I- it’s my fault, really. Tony wanted to exonerate me, and… I guess he figured out how.
, not since Bucky’s official state funeral five years ago. Even the balconies were filled with people, citizens and nobles alike clamouring for a view as Carol arranged the court notes and evidence. Steve tried to ignore them, quashing down his inner turmoil, and carefully schooled his expression into something that resembled calm neutrality.
That wasn’t why Clint was asking, and they both knew it, but Tony turned and left before Clint could say another word.
“… It’s all real, Steve. I heard him say it - he just didn’t know I was there. He loved you so much that, when he asked Strange for three favours, one of them was expressly to protect you. Do you think he would want you to be living in guilt?”
He ran down the stairs and sprinted across toward the dungeons. He had planned on channelling Bucky’s extra magic into a stone, into a new reactor core, but now he didn’t have any time. He crashed into the workshop, found the device he was looking for, and ran toward the dungeons.
This was Tony’s last gift to him, and he’d never learned to use it. Even in the battle it hadn’t worked as intended - every time he threw it it had skittered off across the battlefield, just waiting for someone - for T
Tony hummed in sympathetic agreement, but his attention was drawn back to the notes in front of him. He scanned the top page and flipped to the next one, vaguely aware that she’d slumped back into her chair with a defeated sigh. “Always convinced he’s smarter than everybody who enters the Academy’s doors-” he glanced up, his gaze serious. “- though I suspect he barely holds up against the amphibian specimens down in the lab, let alone against yourself.” He glanced back at the paper in his hand and frowned, scanning the next page. “Your mind is worth a good deal more than his.”
He should be more suspicious. He should have reported all of this days ago, but something was making him hesitate. He simply couldn’t seem to shake the idea that Tony was a good man - even if he had something to do with Iron Man himself.
He could see the artefact in his mind. Exactly what it looked like, and the dilapidated place in the middle of the wilderness where it was housed. Some part of him could sense exactly where it was in relation to himself, though the journey to reach it would be long.
“It can’t be too late,” Clint said, and Tony registers a flicker of anger and fear in his eyes before he pulls it back behind his mask. Bruce put a bracing hand on Clint’s shoulder and squeezed, staring down at the floor. “Strange can’t be wrong. Right? We were meant to have a couple more days!”

For a while, Tony could almost trick himself into thinking this was possible, that the two of them could keep this precious thing they had between them and foster it into something more. He’d never had the chance to simply walk with a lover before; his previous ‘relationships’ had mostly consisted of midnight trysts into opulent bedrooms, not early morning dawdles together in the street. This was something different, something that filled his heart with warmth-
out of Tony Stark, but the incredible mind that powered it. He remembered Steve reaching for his face, stopping just before his hands brushed stone, confessing to Tony how desperately he needed him back and whole and human.
He threw Steve’s shield back to its owner and cut toward the portal, scanning the controls. They had clearly modified the damn thing, but the core of it was still there, and his hands flew across the controls as he tweaked them.
with energy, and to see him literally still as a statue until Steve’s eyes turned away was already unnatural. The fact that Steve had even stopped hearing his movement when his eyes were closed was unnerving. Terrifying.
He pressed a hand against the wound on his chest, desperately trying to think through the blackness he could feel eating away at the edges of his mind. Steve’s shield lay nearby, but Tony didn’t think he could throw it hard enough at the giant monstrosity on the other side of the portal to kill it. He looked up, calculating, and knew that even if he could reach the tesseract and pull it out of its casing, he wouldn’t be able to launch it through the portal and destroy it before the portal flickered closed.
He broke off, choking. He raised shaking hands to his chest - to the blade that had been driven straight through him from behind.
“I was right about you!” Steve yelled, and Tony stepped back in alarm. There was something in Steve’s eyes that he didn’t recognise, a blinding fury that he’d only glimpsed when Bucky had died. “Traitor!”
Behind him, Peggy finished telling the gathered advisors and military leaders everything she knew - which was, unfortunately, very little. Steve didn’t doubt her abilities as a master spy - nobody did - but the fact that they didn’t know exactly what enemy was advancing upon them drove a stake of worry straight through Steve’s chest. He was a tactician, a strategist, and he did his job best when he understood exactly what he was working with.
the store before he looked up to find warm brown eyes watching him from across the counter, a slight smirk crinkling them at the edges, and Steve had to clear his throat before taking his order, because
that it would be close enough. He eyed the tesseract where it sat in its holdings with unease. He would have mere seconds between removing it from its holding and the portal collapsing. He’d have to be fast.
For a moment it was something like heaven. The man relaxed, sighed, and Anthony pulled back to look at him.
“- up until the next one runs out too. Look, Jane, I trust you. I really do.” He paused, seeing the scepticism in her eyes, and let his head fall forward. “Barnes.”
, Tony remembered. He’d read Jane’s notes thoroughly over the past few nights, trying to devise strategies and defences against such a foe.
Hammer grinned and stood straighter. “Oh, Tony. Tony, listen, there’s no need to be defensive! There’s no shame in being a mere consultant. My students and I are more than capable-”
Tony leaned forward, eyes running over the other small sketches on the page with a critical eye. “You’re good. You’re gonna go far.”
Steve cleared his throat, awkwardly casting about for something to say. “I’m really sorry”, he settled on, ducking his head and pretending to wipe down the counter. He stopped. “It was wrong, and kinda stalker-y, and-“
And he remembered a place. A map. He remembered pictures of an object, one that he knew was important, but he lacked the words to describe it.
“We also have a device that can measure a person’s magic capacity,” Strange continued. Behind them Bruce started and awkwardly fumbled a little black box out of his jacket pocket. “I propose that we scan his kill count and simply compare it to the university records of Barnes’ kills prior to his kidnapping. A simple, objective solution - don’t you think?”
in his chest stuttered and radiated with pain, or if he’d noticed the way Steve had dropped his hand without a backward glance. Tony gave him a brittle smile and waved it off. “Hydra,” he said, as though that should explain all his problems.
He could have sworn the guy was smirking when he glanced up and their eyes met. Steve looked away too quickly to tell.
So that’s what Tony did. He sapped a little time - a day or so, which the Dr Who wiki told me is enough to bring an Angel back to health for a while - but ultimately Steve was simply transported directly to the thing, the place, that Tony was thinking of.
The next morning he rolled over, feeling like death warmed over, and stared at his sketchbook on the nightstand.
there’s something there. Every book, every paper, mentions their odd behaviour-” She pulled a book from the pile that had mounted beside her desk. “Look, here. I was researching records of inter-dimensional disturbances to see if we might be able to find you a replacement core, and-”
He left the next night, staggering into the forest alone when he thought Strange wasn’t looking. There was no point staying any longer, he told himself. He was healing quickly, and stronger than ever. He could barely walk straight, but Strange was right: Marvel needed him.
Steve’s muscles were still sore. He’d spent the night before helping dig graves for the fallen, for the dozens of citizens who had died in their effort to protect the city. The soreness would fade over the next few hours, disappearing as quickly as the scars that had littered his palms-
For those who skipped the torture scenes: Tony's trapped in Obie's basement, with anti-magic bindings. Obie threatens to hurt Tony's loved ones; Tony bites him, and manages to break the spell holding the Soldier hostage without Obie noticing. It doesn't seem to have changed anything.
He drew a breath and crashed their lips together, a sick parody of the passionate kisses they had shared only recently. He drew back, the taste of ash and
The large majority of them were quickly constructed, mostly out of material that just happened to be lying around, because the sheer number of things Tony and Bruce needed in their workshop was constantly growing. The volume had long since overwhelmed the already generous store-room in the back corner. Tony had built the new shelves as they needed them, slowly expanding them until half the walls could barely be seen behind the collection of gadgets and bottles and metal scraps waiting to be used. There were hundreds of half-finished projects buried in the mess, things Tony had started building in the middle of one of his fever dreams and forgotten about when a new, more important task came up.
He didn’t need to ask or say anything; he climbed to his feet and lunged at the Chitauri that was strangling Steve, pressed his gauntlet-covered palm to the side of its head and fired. The kickback landed him on his back again, but Steve was alive, he was
Finally Steve looked up, his eyes red and glassy. He stared in the direction Bucky was pointing, and for a moment, he could swear he could see it.Then he blinked, and in the mess of his tears it was gone.
This all seemed more like a simple neighbourhood community than some kind of treasonous plot, but that didn’t make much sense.
“Now you see,” Hammer told her, punctuated with a gigantic bite of his apple. “You shee, I can apprecia’ tha’ you have put a lot off effort into thish, I really can, it’sh real shweet, but this?”
Jane looked up, but Tony was staring out the window at the morning sunshine. “A hive mind,” she agreed.
Tony cleared his throat, not bothering to hide his amusement. He lifted a crate full of items onto the table. “Before we start on the actual weapons - sit
Carol’s shoulders were stiff, and Steve realised he recognised this story. Carol had been furious that one of her finest had been cut down with nobody to support her, had channeled her pain and feelings of failure into ruthlessly chasing down the culprit. They’d changed the way patrols were run, after this case. Two guards, together, at all times.
“I… remember,” he said, and was vaguely aware that his voice sounded wrong; like the wind whispering past stone buildings. “The artefact.”
The cheeky grin was followed by a wink, and Steve blushed heavier than before. “I would, I would love to-“ he said, and realised a moment later that he was telling the truth - he really would love to. “But I’m on shift for the rest of the morning…”
He went to the front of the Chapel to stare out at the rush of traffic; there, he closed himself off, let the curse take over him, surrendered to the cold embrace of nothing, and finally went still.
tiny chapter. real teeny one. just because i'm graduating tomorrow and i feel like i should give you all something to celebrate too.
He sighed in frustration and pulled one of his hearing devices out of his ear. Stark had called them Hearing Aids; he’d built them himself, discovered entirely new concepts about physics and engineering just to ensure that Clint was able to hear properly. He’d gone from being able to hear only vowels, and only at a high volume, to suddenly having consonants crisp and audible and incredibly clear.
Steve nodded, shoulders hunched, shame flooding across his chest. “Kind of? Only him. He’s just so… there’s something special about him. I like him.”
Her smile turned sad, and Tony glanced away, embarrassed, pressing the heel of his palm against the thing in his chest. He hated when people pitied him. “I’m chasing a new lead,” she told him, softly. “Rhodey was going to follow up on some rumours of meteors, see if any of them could have brought down a new core. He was supposed to have left yesterday night. I’m assuming he’s been delayed, now.”
Jane threw herself into her favourite office chair and glared at her desk - or at least what she could see of it through the scattered mess of paper and books. Far too many books. “Hammer,” she hissed out, as Tony followed her into the room and gently shut the door behind them, “Is a
He didn’t wait for Steve to recover, didn’t wait for new Chitauri to take the place of those he had just killed. He simply threw himself into the wall of alien bodies with a fierce determination, faintly recognising when the king apparently decided he was more friend than foe and turned back to the fight.
Steve glanced across at him, unsure. Bruce bumped his shoulder affectionately. “Just switch back. Clint’s been bitching about the schedule change anyway.”
The angel didn’t know how long he had been in this place. He knew his name - Anthony - and he knew his mind was fast, and that it was somehow filled with knowledge he had no memory of gaining, but the Beginning was something he couldn’t recall.
“He hadn’t reached 100% blood toxicity yet. The arc reactor wasn’t full. If I hadn’t killed him, he might have had more time-”
If Bucky noticed the tears building in Steve’s eyes, he didn’t say anything. “And over there, right above the clouds. It says ‘I love you. With all of my magical ass.’”
He tilted a new magnifying glass into place and peered through it, squinting at the tiny crack he’d managed to make in the tesseract’s casing. It didn’t look like it was about to explode, which was good. He hadn’t been entirely sure whether it
He put it in a takeaway cup, though, and let Tony tug him out the door into the early morning street, where the rest of the city was slowly stirring around them.
Bucky looked up at her, expression unreadable, and shrugged. She tilted the device toward him, and waited for the beep.
He breathed in. Out. Narrowed his eyes. Focused on the target, brought his arm back, and finally let it fly-
. “Sure you don’t. Listen, next time just let us know you’re heading out, would you? I don’t mind a midnight excursion or two, but a man
He tore his shirt open and scrabbled at the casing. The core ejected with a soft click. The change was immediate; the moment the crystal was unseated Tony felt the full force of his magic slam into him. It was too much, for a moment, and he was simply caught up in the sensation of coming apart at the seams. Without the core syphoning off the excess magic he was too weak to control it anymore, to keep the light and heat from searing through his blackened veins, to stop a supernatural whirlwind from stirring up around him. With shaking hands, he reached through the portal and let the reactor rest, peacefully, against the side of the gigantic hive mind on the other side.
Steve chuckled, ruffling his friend’s hair as he passed, ignoring the indignant yelp he got in return. The cafe was clean and tidy, the chairs already taken down from the tables. He busied himself with pulling out the pre-made pastries, putting the croissants in to bake, and started up the coffee machine.
Steve was still very upset when he pushed at the door, making it open so hard that it smashed through the wall with a loud noise. That woke a very busy Tony from his working slumber on some machinery Steve didn’t even want to know about.
fucked up was so frustrating that Steve almost couldn’t keep his legs still. He wasn’t even looking at Fury throwing words at him; he was just staring mindlessly at a point in the wall near the director feeling his head throb at his temples. He knew he fucked up, he knew it. No worth in telling him.
Steve let himself be dragged and sat on the chair without hesitation. He was so angry he could break a wall with only a stare.
“What did I say about you jerking off on my hand? You stay still, or I’m leaving you here all night in these miserable conditions,” Tony scolded him, back to touch himself at the look of Steve desperate pain written on the man’s face. He freed his cock to have better access to jerk himself off and to be sure that Steve was in the front row for his show, looking. Steve’s look was dark and hungry; he swallowed, imagining Tony’s cock in his mouth. He would have loved that now, but he didn’t dare to ask; he was under Tony’s orders tonight.
“Oh Rogers, you can’t even keep yourself together. How can you think to be able to give orders out there?” Tony said, and added another hand on Steve’s length, making him cry at the feeling of overstimulation.
“Fury’s being an ass again? Because, you know, when he’s upset, he can be a very frustrating pain in the-“ Tony couldn't even finish his sentence as Steve let himself fall hard on his knees in front of him -“ass,” he concluded, a bit shocked by the gesture, but fully aware of what that gesture meant.
He left the bike in the parking space Tony made just for him, and stormed into the workshop where he knew he would find the other man.
“All very clear, sir” Steve responded, already getting up from his chair, mind blank with anger and frustration. “I’m leaving now, sir,” he saluted and went straight to the garage where he took his bike and drove back to the Tower, needing some time to relax.
Tony let go of himself and reached to grab Steve’s cock again, starting the same slow, stroking pace. This time, Steve concentrated on trying and not letting himself go in the touch, but when Tony gripped his cock harder than before, he shivered hard. He was almost succeeding in keeping still until Tony passed a thumb on the head of his cock, slowly but still grasping hard, and Steve jerked furiously feeling the restrain on his wrist starting to give in.
“Fuck, Tony,” he breathed, and Tony gave him a wicked grin. He started to quicken the rhythm of his hand, making Steve’s eyes roll back in his head. He kept going for some time until he felt Steve's balls tightening up. “T-Tony,” the Captain tried. “I’m so close, don’t stop.” But Tony wasn’t done yet, and he pulled his hand away, leaving Steve on the edge of an orgasm. “No, don’t stop!” Steve groaned loudly, jerking his hips in the air, already desperate and flushed.
And the idea that the team might know- improbable but still possible- what he liked to do when he was frustrated made Steve shudder in embarrassment, his face more red than ever.
“Hey beauty, how was the debrief?” said Tony in an almost too cheerful manner for Steve’s actual mood, turning in his chair to face the blonde.
“You can’t even manage to complete an easy mission, but you think you can save the world?” Tony continued, stroking Steve’s hair. “Now sit in the chair. You must learn a lesson, you useless little soldier,” he said, gripping at the blonde’s hair and guiding him onto the chair he had been sitting on moments ago.
Tony then decided that he was doing good enough, and with some effort and a pat on Steve’s hips, he succeeded in shoving Steve’s pants and underwear down to his ankles, making Steve’s cock bob free against his still clothed belly. Steve breathed hard, shivering as soon as Tony took him in his hand. He started masturbating Steve in a slow, frustrating pace that couldn’t suppress a strangled moan and a jerk of hips.
Steve was about to feel like he had enough when Fury stopped and looked directly at him, gaze steady and pointed. “Am I understood, Captain?"
“Tony, please, I’m- I-“ and Steve trailed off at the overwhelming sensation of having Tony’s hand massaging him in the sensitive spot under the head of his cock.
He stood up towering Steve, who was breathing hard and not looking at him. “Very well, Captain. So you’ve been a complete failure again?” Tony shifted his tone immediately; he knew that when Steve was back from a failed -or semi-failed- mission, he needed to let go of his frustrations.
“Oh, look at you. Already desperate. I can imagine you can’t concentrate feeling like this,” said Tony, looking at how flushed and red Steve was partially from the anger and partially from the embarrassment. He quite enjoyed having Steve like this, very willing to accept everything Tony gave him, enjoying the ride a lot too. It would be awful if Steve didn't like it and still asked for this, but judging by the big bulge in the man’s pants, it seemed like he was very much having a good time. Tony moved closer to Steve, touching his face gently  and earning an intense dark look from the blonde, and then he moved his hand south, travelling over Steve’s broad chest and not stopping until it reached Steve’s belt. He remained there for a bit, teasing at the belt buckle and undoing it in slow moves. Tony then pulled away and Steve twitched against the chair, craving for the touch. Tony positioned himself behind the chair with his face near Steve’s and reach out with his arms to touch Steve through his pants. With his right hand, he reached under the man’s pants, willingly massaging his now fully hard cock.
