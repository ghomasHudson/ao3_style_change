They wouldn’t have let Sam back in without it. Steve can hardly criticize, even by not-signing he’s playing by the Accords’ rules. It’s not a principled stand; he doesn’t run secret missions or invade countries for the greater good. He sits quietly on the couch while his team - absent him - carries on. “I figured.”
Steve stays awake on the couch for the rest of the night but for the first time since waking in the future, he feels young.
But of course he is. It’s why Natasha’s fine with hiding him from the council. It’s why Tony is perfectly willing to let Steve believe he’s screwing with Bucky’s head rather than admit he’s getting help. Kovalchyk is the perfect candidate; his father was a scientific genius broken by guilt who eventually -
“Don’t do it.” Steve held his hands up. “I promise I won’t hurt you. I won’t ask you for the key ever again. Just don’t - “
“I only had the two parents. He kill anyone else I know?” Sober that remark would sting but Tony’s drinking so it rolls off his tongue without barbs.
“I’m not the man I thought I was,” he confessed instead. “I’m not who I used to be, who I’m supposed to be. And no one knows.”
, no. He only knows something bad happened and no one’s talking about it. And now you know and you won’t come home. You’re the second supersoldier to run across the country to get away from me. You’re gonna give me a complex.”
Steve’s stomach lurches. He’s felt this way before; torn between wanting to know more and needing to know less. There’s only one reason Tony would choose a man as unremarkable as Robert Kovalchyk to review the Winter Soldier’s files. Stark’s after a second opinion in more ways than one.
“Please," Tony begged. "Just hold on a little longer. Stephen or Reed or T’Challa will pull us out when it’s safe to revive you. You won’t remember any of this but until then...
On cue both men walk in having a loud argument about football. They spot Pepper and comically lower their voices before Rhodes slumps, happily drunk, on Tony’s other side.
He doesn’t know if he hates who he is becoming or if this is who he always was. Under all the glamour of Captain America was a skinny kid who fought the world with his fists. What happens when you grant that kid power? The serum turned Schmidt into the Red Skull, Banner into the Hulk, Blomsky into an abomination. What did it turn Steve into?
“Barton's off grid. Assumed taken.” She lets her eyes roam the ceiling and walls of the coffee-colored hallway she stands in. Habit, nothing more. Check for bugs and cameras in the ceiling, even though she already knows JARVIS is everywhere.
” And he walks out of the room, the rest of them trailing after as the back-up singers they currently are.
” he sings, smirking in a way that everyone in this room knows is all bullshit and hidden bitterness, and Tony is going to
” Loki says with a put-upon sympathetic expression, and dance-steps close enough to fit his hand above Clint's heart, the cold seeping through the fabric of his t-shirt. “
Steve lets Tony's unconscious body slide to the ground, going down with him, making sure Tony's breathing. He glares at Loki but doesn't say anything; the curse has got him again, Clint realizes. The Captain's shivering with the energy spent to break into Tony's song.
Clint hangs his head; smirks humorlessly as he can feel – though not hear or see – his team getting closer. “
” Steve murmurs and Tony knows the team is here, Loki's here, but it still feels like it's just the two of them; just Tony slumped against Steve's unyielding, warm frame, feeling steady breathing against him and trying to draw in air himself.
” Phil's hands tighten on the wheel, and he feels what little energy he has drain as he keeps singing.
Thor's moving more fluently than Tony thought he could, a complicated set of dance movements that must be Asgardian. Tony notices Loki watching his brother with a faint look of derisiveness. Bruce and Steve are dancing together, of all things: a jazzy waltz, which, Tony doesn't even know how that works, but it does. Steve even smiles, twirling Bruce, and though Tony knows it's all the curse and the music – confusing, fast-paced, neither crescendoing nor rescinding – it still makes his stomach tumble in a way that's both painful and soothing, seeing Steve smile like that.
Steve grins and pulls him in. “Yeah, he is. My handyman.” He kisses the side of Tony's neck, making him squeak and attempt to squirm away.
” Tony rasps to Loki, though he keeps his gaze on Clint's to see the man draw his head back a fraction; the closest he can get to shaking his head right now. “
“Clint,” she echoes, and closes the door before leaning back against it, arms folded. She cocks an eyebrow at him, but doesn't say anything.
“I'm going down to Tony for a minute,” Phil murmurs. “Go back to sleep, nothing is wrong. I'll be back shortly.”
“So, I've got this question,” Tony says when he walks into the Avengers' living room this morning, “and feel free to ignore me if, y'know, I'm talking crazy here, but have any of you spontaneously burst into song lately?”
“I feel like shit,” Clint mutters and steals one of Tony's expensive bottles of vodka. He shares it with Natasha, who nods with him. The rest of them fall into disturbed, increasingly drunken silence after that – even Thor.
.” Steve's eyes are far-away and yet still trained on Tony's, his cheeks coloring, and there comes the guitar strumming and Tony just
” Steve sings, and the music's calmed down entirely now, cut off from Tony's death dance, Steve taking over when Tony can't anymore.
“Yup. Anything funny coming up?” Tony sits upright, DUM-E rolling back a few steps and looking at him. Tony rubs his eyes.
Clint feels like a gag has been removed from his mouth, and finds that he can speak freely. “Hulk!” he shouts, watching how Loki scrabbles to put his hand back on his chest. “The gold chain around Loki's neck! Get it off!”
“That won't be necessary, Mister Laufeysson,” a new voice says from behind them, and Clint's every muscle tightens.
The silence almost has time to settle again, before Tony speaks. “See, I didn't know that.” The humor in his voice is weak, but it's there, and so is an awkward smile.
.” And he finally pushes off, finally backs away, and sings his refrain again, but Tony's barely listening anymore. He's half-hard, to his own mortification, from Steve's words – and just about ready to hurl at the real meaning of them, at the misery exuding from the kid.
On a usual day, he'd spend some hours shooting down on the range, or sparring with Natasha and Cap in the training room. But meeting people means the possibility of singing to people, and it was horrifying enough to sing out loud to
” Steve continues, and walks towards Tony, one step per lazy beat. The guitar strums in the background, and for each step the Captain takes, Tony stumbles backwards because no, nope,
Okay. Fair enough. Tony spits blood and sucks in a scratchy breath, hears the music change, turn frantic, egg him on, and Tony lets his eyes fall shut and dances.
Hulk looks down at Thor, as if asking for permission - which is such an odd thought, Clint thinks - and Thor pats Hulk's arm. "You have done well, Green One," he says. "Some careless frolicking will do you good."
doesn't understand how the hell that happened – them – but it's clearly working for them both (even Hulk's taken to cuddling Thor post-battle instead of beating the shit out of him), and Tony's going to be so pissed if this damned curse splits them up. Contrary to common belief, Tony likes seeing his friends happy, even if the thought of Thor and Bruce having sex makes his brain boil.
Tony pulls DUM-E close and pets him, trying not to think about the fact that the only creatures who love him are his robots. DUM-E beeps with pleasure and curls up against Tony's chest the best he can, which truthfully isn't very good, but sentiment's everything and Tony murmurs quiet praise to the kid.
Loki's grin widens. “No? Oh, well. Do not let it wear you down.” Something about that particular sentence triggers all kinds of red flags in Clint's mind, but he remains passive.
“Um, yeah, no,” Tony says. “Are you suggesting we track him down and just barge in, not knowing if he's got another Tesseract stashed in a pocket somewhere? That's a terrible plan, Cap. I'm ashamed on your behalf.”
Coulson doesn't ask why Stark and not Captain Rogers, but Natasha can tell he wants to. “Need SHIELD back-up?”
Clint is jolted out of his muddled thoughts – maybe even out of half-sleep – by a quiet moan. Quickly, he looks up, but Phil is still asleep and pale against the white sheets of the hospital bed. Which leaves the occupant in the other bed.
“Cafeteria coffee, Rogers. See you in a few.” And then he's out of the room, leaving Tony alone with Steve and a hopefully-sleeping Agent Agent.
“My systems are being overridden, sir,” JARVIS says, and sounds like he wants to swear. “I apologize in advance.”
“You feel,” Clint says with a sigh, “whatever Loki wants you to feel. You feel... awe, for him. Pride, maybe. Devotion. Calm. Certainty.” He sits back in the chair. “On the outside, you might look like a robot, but – but the way you
“Where's Tony?” Clint asks, when the rest of the team is assembled in their common room. Thor and Bruce sit next to each other on one of the couches, and whatever Tony had mentioned earlier about something being wrong, Steve can't see it right now. Natasha's keeping closer to Clint than usual, and Clint seems... tired. Really tired. This singing business is taking its toll on all of them.
Tony would be super embarrassed, really, but he's made a fool of himself too many damn times today to care properly. They all dance their way over to the podium, Loki swaying to the music and smiling indulgently, his eyes dancing with laughter and insanity.
“We got tired of waiting and singing, sir,” Steve says, letting the bite in his tone show. He's just let a perfectly good – if a little hurtful and unhealthy – friendship go down the drain, and he'd like to find Loki and make him pay
Clint grunts in agreement before he falls back asleep. Their sheets are cool, like their room, the window open against the autumn night. They're tangled and clad in sleep wear, because although Phil has gotten to see and know more of Clint than he ever thought he would – could – there are still some places they have yet to go. There's no hurry. This helps enough with his own nightmares.
Fury sighs and folds his arms behind his back. “We have an inkling. I'll have someone send you the information you need. Now, if you'll excuse me-”
“Aye,” Thor says, and looks torn between relief and fury. Natasha nods jerkily, her mouth a pinched line.
They both turn their heads in his direction, and Thor sighs. Bruce just shifts the grip on his tea cup and looks wistful. He's not even wearing his glasses, and for some reason, that's the weirdest part of this morning so far.
, he'd said, and then he had died of cancer before Tony turned twelve and Tony had known that there were no angels watching over him, not anymore, and he'd have to build his own one day.
The stuff of fairy tales,” and the song calms down again but it's not helping this time, because Tony's just too fucking
“Phil Coulson is alive.” Natasha stares at him for a few seconds, before she goes back to her magazine. Her flipping the page is like an exclamation point.
The knowledge; you're Nick's right-hand guy,” And Phil's eyes flicker down, and Clint knows that if the agent could, he'd still not deny that he was part of this plan. Fuck.
“If you beg my pardon, Sir,” JARVIS says, “but while I find Captain Rogers a perfectly pleasant man, he is not my creator. You are.”
And Clint is suddenly singing along, the words springing from his lips unbidden, although at least the words are his own: “
She just shakes her head, and the rest of them know better than to pry. “Steve?” Clint asks instead.
“I am serious. Since when am I not serious?” Tony asks, because he's serious. He's totally serious. Seriously. “I'm always serious.”
“Me? I'm adorable.” Tony flings himself onto the large couch in Cap's living room – the one he put there because Steve kept being vague and 'I don't know, anything's good, really' at him – without spilling a drop of his remaining coffee. This really is an awesome couch; deep and comfy. Because Tony's an awesome friend. (If not a deep and comfy one.) “So, what did you want to talk about? Or sing about?” Tony stretches and puts the cup down on the table nearby, arching an eyebrow at the superhero and hiding his jitters below the usual layer of bravado and bullshit. “Please tell me you didn't want to sing?”
“There is something I would like to attempt, if I have your permission,” JARVIS says vaguely. He's not usually vague at all, which makes Tony a bit wary, but he trusts his guy past the end of the world.
“Is that –” Steve cuts off whatever he was going to say and frowns at the white floor. “What you... sang. Is that why you always made fun of me?”
“My, my,” Loki says pleasantly, in a way that's so far from pleasant it makes blue crackle at the edges of Clint's vision. “You talk more than Stark. I'm impressed.”
”, JARVIS sings, and Tony blinks, because he didn't even know JARVIS knew that. About his human ancestor, Edwin Jarvis, who had told Tony about guardian angels.
Chapter warnings: Serious health complications based on the side effects from the curse. It shouldn't be too bad, but check the end notes if you want to be spoilered and sure.
stare at her boobs or ass; he made fun of Cap. Because really, what else could he do with the super-soldier? They were from two different worlds, almost-literally, and while Steve seemed to settle into the 21st century just fine, he was still so...
” Steve's close now, too close, close enough that Tony can see all the hurt and the confusion in Steve's eyes and really, it was just
“Lover's spat – didn't get the details. We done here? Because I'm a busy man, you know,” Tony says and crosses the living room, heading for the door. An entire conversation with Cap and no singing; that's almost too good to be true, and Tony really doesn't want to push it.
“Bruce, I apologize,” Phil says and Clint frowns. He looks at the scientist, who's staring at Phil, but looks as confused as Clint feels. Loki raises his hand – presumably to force Phil into his own little dancing monkey routine – when a gunshot rings through the warehouse, making Steve and Thor flinch.
grateful to be alive. He was grateful for the pain, for the cold, for Sam and Sharon who he never thought he’d see again. He was grateful Tony left him behind to save them both and so Steve could burn for his sins. He was grateful Tony was standing here in front of him so Steve could finally, finally stop killing him.
“Here’s my offer,” Steve’s voice is hollow and he feels another sliver of himself give way, “you let me retape your side and you tell Natasha you’re out with bruised ribs. FRIDAY sends her updates about your condition.” He presents the extra coffee. “That’s the best I can do.”
Steve’s grimace tightened. He rested his forehead against his intertwined hands and Tony wondered why it took him so long to recognize a man praying. He moved to give Steve some privacy before the man in question surged forward and Tony froze, his sprained wrist caught in Steve’s careful grip.
Tony doesn’t look up, so he misses Steve’s expression of horror. This is who Tony thinks he is. This is who he
It’s pitiful and paltry, and it barely scrapes by ethically but it’s the most Steve can offer that Tony still has a chance of accepting. If this is compromise then if feels like failing. Tony looks as unhappy and trapped as Steve feels but he nods. The outstretched coffee remains untouched until Steve places it on the floor for Stark to pick up, the minor adjustment serving as another reminder of far they are from okay.
Strange pinched his nose like he knew this had been a bad idea from the start. “I’m here to make you an offer. One, I should stress, that you can
“He smells different, you notice that? Makes me want to hit something. I don’t know how Logan stands it. How have you not… ”
This is how the dream ends: running through a labyrinth with hunters hot on his heels but Steve’s happy and Bucky smiles and it doesn’t matter if they’re right or wrong because they’re free.
There are days when the only thing that keeps him sane is visiting Bucky. Everything that surrounds the rehabilitation of the Winter Soldier is carefully planned and scheduled - up to and including visits from Steve. We need him to focus on moving forward, the doctors had said as if it was Steve who was the jarring ghost from the past and not the other way around.
Reed had already stretched himself away. “It’s been four days since your battle with the Celestials. You gave us quite a scare.”
The survivors were huddled under blankets as onlookers pointed and cried. They couldn’t see what Steve saw. The focal point glowing orange against the stunning landscape: the cerulean sea set behind, the manicured green lawn, the magenta of twilight, the raining fire, the absolute destruction. On the way into SHIELD custody, Sin looked back and smiled. She saw it too.
After the elation of seeing Tony alive finally faded, Steve was left with the cold hard truth. It had been a month and Tony looked no better than when he returned; pale and thin, with dark circles etched under his eyes and a charming smile that no longer blinded Steve’s careful inspection.
The stranger doesn’t seem perturbed by Tony's miraculous appearance. “I thought I’d have some tea. I apologize for the mess in your kitchen.”
Steve steps closer and the gold undersuit crawls up the vee of Tony’s throat as a protective measure or a warning or both.
For a man who can't get sick in the world's most accommodating prison, Steve gets asked that question a lot. “I’m alright.”
Hunger and thirst were unwanted intrusions; barely recognized. His stomach rumbled when he forgot to eat which was often. Sometimes he skipped meals deliberately to punish his body for surrendering to the marching orders of time. For all his lapses, his muscle tone never lessened, his skin never sallowed. The Cursed wound hadn’t even left a scar. There were no dark circles under his eyes to betray the long stretches he spent awake, patiently waiting for Tony’s return so their two-step could recommence.
Tony hasn’t taken the glasses off and Steve knows the moment he leaves Stark will dive right back into whatever memory he needs to relive and rework. It’s an especially bad week for BARF to become functional again and Steve wonders how deep Tony’s self-sabotage goes.
He dragged Steve’s hand downward and Steve said the words he knew he should even as his fingers did as they were asked. “We don’t have to.”
Steve glared. “You said you’d left us a way out so what are you looking for? A portal, a key, a machine, what?”
Logan unsheathed his claws. “You don’t wanna be part of this, Cap.” They both disappeared through the veil.
Steve slams the door to his room and steps into the hall. “That’s why you’re here?” he hisses angrily.
Clint called it once with good humour. The last time Steve had seen Clint he’d said it in a tone a good deal darker.
Tony doesn’t seem surprised in the slightest. “Then he should stop screwing me and go fuck the one-armed bastard instead.”
Stark is standing unnaturally still, impervious to Steve’s turmoil. He looks… smaller, warmer; more human than the untouchable mogul that has been ruling Steve’s life since his return. Stark’s just staring at him, brown eyes dark and wide and confused, and for once Steve can’t find a hint of dismissal or condemnation. He’s not looking at Steve like he’s a problem or a threat but like a puzzle Stark can’t quite figure out. There’s nothing guarded in his expression just uncertainty mingled with curiosity.
Stark looking at him without hostility didn’t used to be rare and suddenly Steve needs more. He needs to recapture something of Tony and not of Stark. He runs his lips lightly across the other man’s collarbone and the skin under his mouth shivers.
Steve obeyed and pulled out a series of foil circles. Condoms, right. They hadn't used them before but it was reasonable, a request one would make of any casual lover regardless of whether said lover wanted more. Steve outfitted himself and then Tony was pushing him down to the bed and climbing on top, lining himself up.
“Tony’s just angry, he didn’t mean any of it.” Steve owes her so much more than platitudes for making her choose. “You’re one of the best people I know. It was unfair, not trusting you from the beginning. I’m sorry.” He swallows. “You had faith in me and I didn’t show that I had the same faith in you. But I trust you, Natasha. Please tell me you know that.”
Stark downs his drink in a single swallow before turning and dropping his glass back in the cart. It hits the tray with a deafening clank and his hands are already moving to pour himself another. Steve resents the twinge of guilt he feels at Tony’s lack of moderation.
Gregory drowns on the family property in 1974. It takes the police eleven days to officially rule it an accident. There are incomplete files but it was a local force in the 70s and parts are inevitably missing. There was no autopsy but a number of objections to the dragging investigation get printed in the local paper. Enough to suggest a cover-up. Enough to suggest it wasn’t an accident.
After all, this is the future not a back alley in 1940. This isn’t two fearful-eyed men darting into dark corners for a brief few hours where they can be themselves. This is Tony Stark whose past dalliances are splashed across tabloids whenever the news cycle slows, who Steve once saw interpret cocksucker as a pick-up line instead of an insult.
The first time he touches Tony in 27 days is in violence. Steve drives both of them across corridor before either has a chance to blink. Stark’s head hits the back wall hard enough that his teeth click violently. Steve doesn’t give him any time to recover. He spins Stark around, twists his arm behind his back as Steve’s other hand presses at the nape of Tony’s neck, forcing his head into the wall. The grip around Stark’s wrist will bruise, the one at the base of his skull is gentler but not by much. He’s being forced to his toes by the position of his arm and Steve’s body is preventing him from getting any leverage.
. It didn’t throb like a secondary heartbeat that had a will of its own. Outside the Ether, pain was an enemy, not a companion. A pale imitation was all he could afford.
Steve rolled out of bed in disgust and headed towards the shower. He stood under the spray of water, one hand on the tap, and remembered the frozen lake. He used to hate the cold but the ice water in the Ether had been so clear, so numbing. He had started to believe that Tony had indeed given him a gift. Steve slowly turned the tap all the way to the right, waiting for the cold to swallow him whole and take him home.
On the holographic globe the typhoon is a beautiful counter-clockwise spiral as it moves towards landfall. Stark sighs. “Fri, show me the numbers I ran this afternoon. Include the probabilities.”
A shadow at the threshold of the lab paused, not daring to come closer. Steve deliberately averted his eyes. He didn’t trust either of them. The distance between them may have well have been an ocean.
For one brief insane moment Steve didn’t think even the threat of the Hulk would be able to stop him. Then Logan appeared from the depths of the Mansion and Steve saw the pattern. There was Bruce guarding Tony’s room, Strange posted like a sentry, Logan roving. Bucky must have called ahead.
Steve has no idea what he'd say. Stark had been caustically indifferent to Bucky’s health crisis and Steve had been angry. Not the type of angry that ended in sex but the type that ended with him storming out, righteous fury burning under his skin. Stark must have figured out by now that Steve had forgotten. Or maybe he just thinks Steve remembered and doesn’t care. Either option makes him feel sick.
Tony flicks his wrist and tosses the keys to Steve. His voice is raw. “Can’t have me die in an actual car accident can we? I’d never escape the irony.”
Tony was skinnier than when he left, hipbones jutting sharply without the underlying muscle. He was cold at the extremities and feverish at the core, slower too; keeping Steve’s pace when before he’d race ahead and call the shots. He tasted like copper and salt.
Teacups are filled, two this time and Steve accepts his black without complaint. Kovalchyk adds lemon. “By 1941 he was here in the US, nursing his hatred of the Germans and with Walas’s ideas rattling around his brain. He was adopted by the American government who put him to work for a brilliant man named Howard Stark.”
On bad days Steve wonders if Stark knows where Lang is, where Clint is, and is just keeping the information back from Ross until Steve dares put a hair out of line. Stark has always designed his weapons with care and he is used to living among his enemies in a way Steve is not. Steve itches for confrontation, for a finality Stark won’t give him.
Strange was not amused. “I wouldn’t try that again, Captain. Ever. On anyone. Especially not me and especially not Anthony.”
Stark’s globe isn’t binary, it’s mapped by degree; cyan to blue to black and every colour inbetween. There are a series of percentages attached to each country that flicker in real time, fluctuating up and down. Billions of lives quantified. Meted and measured and given a calculated cost.
Tony doesn’t mention the other Avengers often. Not to Steve. The context sours it: Tony attributes deaths by some mysterious formula known only to himself. Steve doesn’t count the war, doesn’t count trickery or mind-control or indoctrination or survival.
“Captain?” Vision prompts. He doesn’t take orders from Steve anymore but the irony is he trusts Steve’s judgement in this: to know when the border is crossed between an argument between friends and a fight that desperately needs an intervention. Steve has no idea where that line is. Especially when it involves Tony.
Steve meets Tony's eyes and desperately searches for truth in their depths. He tries to find some sign that he can risk Bucky's life on Tony's word. He doesn't know if he'd recognize it if he found it.
(In his memories Steve’s not paying attention: he’s already deciding where to hit when things go south. He’s chosen; Stark’s lost. Maybe Tony could read that in his face; maybe that’s when he decided that if no one cared why save himself.)
The tipping point came in the form of a visitor. Steve had been lunching outside the cafe on French pastries that turned to ash in his mouth and hot coffee that did not thaw him. He watched the chaotic city pass him by: rushing to and fro, swearing into cellphones, stealing cabs, throwing tantrums. The July sun shone down on the liars, the greedy, and the malingering alike as the heat of the day built its way to a crescendo. Had Sol a sense of justice, New York’s population would have cooked like eggs on a sidewalk.
realizing that he knows very, very little about what's going on in the lives of the people around him. He is surprised by Bucky and Tony, Sam and Rhodey, and Tony's extremis update all in one chapter.
Every other Thursday Jim makes sure to pin Tony down and make him eat and talk. There’s an art to it that none of the other Avengers ever really learned. It seemed the epitome of prima donna behaviour to have your best friend jump through so many hoops for the honour of spending time with you.
.” Steve releases the sleeve and watches gold drain back into bones. “Take the victory, Tony. Even if I leave you’ve still won.”
The Soldier’s head swivels and Steve shoves him out of the line of fire. Iron Man doesn't shoot, he advances, but he ignores the Soldier completely and grabs Steve instead. Cold metal encloses his right forearm and his instinctive left hook to the side of Iron Man’s helmet does nothing but bloody his knuckles.
That’s the detail that Steve keeps circling back to day after day. He adheres to Natasha’s instructions and keeps Kovalchyk off the record but he picks at him like an open sore. Neither Tanaka nor Bucky have heard of him but even though FRIDAY is nominally kept out of the North Wing it’s not like Tony couldn’t get access to the Winter Soldier’s files -
The punishment never lasted. Death did not exist in Hell. There was no reprieve in the act of killing the enemy and no final damnation for the betrayal of a friend. Steve would sit with the body afterward and the Curse in his ears would die down to a rumble. Then Tony would wake, immaculate, eyes wide in perfect wonder. He’d make promises with utter sincerity and trip over himself to ease Steve’s discomfort. But those stretches of amnesia - of innocence - never lasted. Tony always remembered eventually. If the words existed that would have convinced Tony to let him go, Steve never found them. The final say was Tony’s and it was always
. He guards his eyes closer than his wounds. Most of Steve’s experience is predicated on silence but Tony has no such filter: instructions, insults, and dirty talk all make an appearance - everything but Steve’s first name. Not since he came back which means not since…
Steve snarled and pushed Tony over the edge of the crevasse. Every bit of musculature stood out as Tony strained to keep himself from falling to a death he didn’t remember wouldn’t take. He was dangling from his fingertips, knuckles white with pressure. He had the most beautiful, terrified eyes Steve had ever seen.
Steve stares down between his knees. “I want to stop making things worse. I don’t know how to say the right words. I feel like I’m losing things when I know I never had them in the first place. I can’t keep promises. I’m… stuck. And everyone else has moved on.”
“You… You don’t fight like that.” When Steve looks at him he elaborates. “Like I used to. Mindless. You didn’t even hear me calling your name. You heard Tony.”
He sounded so completely serious and Tony could only snort. He regretted it when Steve flinched and softened his tone. “I’m pretty sure this isn't Hell, Cap. Not the capital ‘H’ one at least. There’s a distinct lack of fire and brimstone and well...” he motioned to the emptiness, “...
“You win,” Tony says hoarsely. He flips the sketchbook closed and Steve doesn’t know if he means in Siberia or the drawing or - “The bet. We didn’t fight.”
Steve’s hands left streaks of warmth behind them as he manhandled Tony upright. The water hadn’t been cold but the lukewarm temperature of everything meant that Steve’s body heat felt like taking a burning brand to newborn skin. Tony submitted himself to the inspection as Steve’s hands roamed: pausing at his neck, his cheek. Steve paused at the three puncture wounds in his abdomen, pulling the skin around them taunt.
Steve feels like he’s drowning in three feet of water. He tries to remember every bit of frustration that ever leaked out onto Stark's skin, tries to guess how many bruises he’s laid. They’ve encountered one another once or twice a week for the past two months.
“You smell like the floor of my freshman dorm. How on Earth are you sticky?” An exasperated sigh. “I was never this sloppy when I was tanked.”
He couldn’t remember the last time he saw Tony’s eyes in daylight instead of hidden behind dark sunglasses. The jokes didn’t cover Tony's newfound tendency to clean his plate or the fact his personality dimmed when he thought Steve wasn’t looking. Whenever their borrowed car passed a church Tony held his breath.
“Then do you find it a touch ironic that you’re here to talk me out of my newfound technological caution?”
Steve made a promise back in that letter that Tony burnt to ash; to come when called. Captain America doesn’t break promises or abandon people. Steve can and does and Tony knows it.
It’s why she left and wasn’t sure she’d come back. Steve knows a secret when he hears one and he knows to Natasha they’re worth their weight in gold. He gives her one back. “I miss you. More than Clint or Wanda sometimes because you’re right here and we don’t… I miss it. Spending time with you. Planning missions. Having dinner. Training.”
This is the only ending I could think to write. One where Steve recognizes what he’s lost and what he’s never had and starts to rebuild something of his own. Tony gets sobriety, Rhodey and Pepper, and a version of Steve that he trusts to drive when he needs a rest. I will never not love the Steve-and-Tony recruitment scenes from the comics so that’s in there too.
“There’s a reason for that,” Tony grimaced, “it’s because I don’t smell like you anymore. Or the Captain if you want to get technical.”
“I saw the request sheet.” Tony stills and Natasha waits five agonizing seconds for him to look at her. Her voice could cut glass. “I won’t to do this alone.”
He crushes it in his palm and washes it down the sink drain along with all the alcohol in the penthouse and his wedding ring.
He graduates to full blossoms in mid-September. The first whole flower is the worst; he spends hours dry hacking over the sink only to finally release a small, intact marigold no bigger than a wingnut. It’s limp and deformed. Malevolent.
“Not in and of itself.” The doctor physically injects himself between Steve and Tony and that’s historically not a safe place to be. “You just have to believe I’m not here to do Sergeant Barnes harm. I was invited.” Kovalchyk gestures toward Stark.
“Thank you for that image.” Steve takes another swig. The liquor burns through his throat leaving a pleasantly smooth aftertaste and he doesn’t try to guess how much money he’s just swallowed. He can’t get drunk but every mouthful he takes is a mouthful Tony can’t.
“On whose authority? Who gave you the right to decide - ” Steve choked over his own words. “I know, alright. I know how you feel but nothing you do now will undo what happened to him.”
Steve’s not straight as an arrow but he’s not... He’s never though about it. It doesn’t matter. He’s not so invested in labels that he’ll take whatever bait is dangled in front of him.
He can see that Phil wants to say something, but they're both under the musical spell now, and Clint's the only one who opens his mouth.
He gets out of bed quietly, though not so quietly that he doesn't wake Clint back up. “Mmmn,” the archer says and frowns sleepily at him.
*Steve sings to Tony about being in love with him. In the dance, he's forced to straddle Tony and talk - vaguely - about sex, and both of them are very uncomfortable and Not Okay With This. Nothing more explicit happens.
” Steve sings, right into his ear, and lust or want has nothing to do with it, Tony knows; this is Steve
And thoughts flash through Tony's mind without his permission, old dreams and fantasies and jerk-off material; Cap on his back, on his bed, naked; kneeling in front of him, neck bared, Tony with a hand safely on the nape of his neck, and Tony wants to close his eyes to the real version in front of him, but he can't. He swallows convulsively instead, and Steve nods, like that's a confession and a rejection in itself. Maybe it is.
Fear threatens to sneak in under Clint's skin, and he shakes it off like he once tried to shake off Loki's hold on him. “You don't have the Tesseract anymore.”
“Out and about. Bruce and Nat's getting some rest. Thor's with Fury, getting our friendly neighborhood psycho-god stuffed up somewhere.”
” he finishes meekly and sinks back into the couch, next to Natasha. She pats his knee in reassurance, and Thor's face brightens a little again.
” He turns away from Loki, from Clint; turns until he's facing his team, with Steve closest. Steve, who looks like he's in more pain than Tony right now. “
Natasha starts to 'ooo' again, her hand on his cheek, supporting him the only way the song lets her.
. It made Tony feel bad to even touch the guy, like he'd somehow make Steve less – less something. Less
Stumbling a little, Tony gasps for breath as the music winds down a little, for the bridge. He feels like he could sleep for a week already, and that's... that's not a great sign.
In a matter of hours, every Avenger receives an email from Director Fury telling them to stay off the streets and not do any superhero work until the probably-possibly-spell has been broken. Apparently the entirety of New York seems to be under the influence of the curse, with people bursting out into song all over. At first, everyone thought it was some kind of elaborate TV stunt, but by now there are just too many perfectly synchronized ballads and musical numbers happening, and people are starting to freak out. Or they would be freaking out already, Tony muses, if they weren't forced to sing and be jolly around each other.
“I would not mind witnessing it,” Thor says as they make their way out of their apartment and up to the roof, where the Quinjet's waiting. “If we are to assume that the Hulk is as adept at singing as you are, it may well be a pleasant experience.”
.” Steve lets go of the door handle and looks apologetic even as his body leans back against it, trapping Tony in his apartment. “
to sing and dance, to reveal our secrets to each other, but we do.” Steve looks down at his hands, curls them, before they relax again.
Clint doesn't know when exactly this conversation turned into Projection Lane, but the urge to grab Phil's hand is stronger than ever. He swallows and pointedly folds his arms across his chest. “He still loves you, though.”
Tony shifts, and shifts more, and doesn't answer. Not for a few minutes, anyway. “You know me, Clint,” he sighs. “You've read Natasha's report on me – Agent Comatose over there must have told you heaps of stuff about me long before we started living in the same tower. I'm not –” he gestures vaguely.
“Steve, hey,” Clint says and gets to his feet. He glances over at Tony, then smiles sweetly at the Captain. “Good timing – I need to grab a bite. Mind if you look over these sleeping beauties for a while?”
,” Clint finally says and waves a hand vaguely at the door. “Pissing or, smoking or, I dunno. Probably rallying up the troops.”
There is a moment of total silence. Then Natasha curses in Russian and Clint bursts out with “I knew there was something off with those back-up singers!” Steve says nothing, but he blushes, and Thor claims that he noticed nothing out of the ordinary, as he tends to spontaneously burst into song anyway.
,” Natasha snaps and walks over to him, catching him by the jaw. He allows it, and her eyes blaze with fury, knowing that he's preventing her from helping him. “That's my
,” Tony says out of pure instinct, before he actually has time to properly hear the question. “My – I'm not going to talk about my issues with you, Cap.”
He's not even surprised when the melancholy piano music starts up, though he feels more tired immediately – like the music's tapping into his energy and feeding off it. At least he's alone this time.
“Rogers,” Fury says, and something flickers across his face. If this were another man, Steve would be tempted to call it fear. “I thought I gave your team specific orders to stay in the Tower until otherwise instructed.”
The safety zone is one step and a heavy door away but it may as well be miles. “I made a promise.” Steve grips it like a lifeline.
He should still be fixated on Kovalchyk, he’s the unknown quantity here, but Steve finds himself swinging to face Stark anyways. He can’t help it.
One night Tony kissed him across the divide, mouth soft but resolute and it had taken everything in Steve to retreat slowly instead of flinching back.
“Yeah,” Steve can’t keep the bitterness out of his voice. He’s envious of the ways in which Tony survived their falling out. He still gets to be Tony Stark and Iron Man and an Avenger. He gets to keep his name, his team, his purpose. Steve gets a damaged shield and
Tony is almost far enough away before Natasha’s voice rings out, “You’ve been giving him quite a few.”
Most of the time Tony spoke of the other world with casual offhandedness, like it was a crummy vacation to a third-tier tourist trap. Comments like how bars in this dimension were so much more civilized, or how cotton sheets made an excellent change from straw but silk was better. He remarked quite often that running hot water was worth its weight in gold.
“Quite the opposite actually.” Strange flicked a wrist and the damaged cars moved 20 feet to the left so they no longer impeded traffic. “I was asked to meet with you to offer my services.”
Then Stark shakes his head in disbelief and between breaths Tony disappears. He fixes his clothing as best he can and saunters over to the drinks cart, all artifice as opposed to grace. He pours himself a finger of scotch, thinks better of it, and adds a second as he leans against the side table. He doesn’t offer Steve one. “So is this going to be a regular thing with you?”
It makes Steve irrationally angry to see a man with so much pride have so little of it in this. Even without knowing what lurks under Tony’s skin Steve doesn’t think he could bear to touch him ever again. “You could just ask me to stay.”
Steve opens his door to find Tony in the hallway. He’s leaning casually against the wall Steve drove his head into after Rhodes left eight months ago, the night he sought Steve out; furious and lost and incapable of asking for comfort. The present version of Tony seems perfectly put together but Steve has to avert his eyes until the afterimage fades. Reminders persist; triggering an avalanche of phantom sensation followed by shame wrapped up in regret.
Steve searches for a revelation that doesn't involve Tony in some way. “Vision’s trying to learn to dream.”
“And here I thought we weren’t going to do this,” Tony mutters. He rips the glasses off and Steve barely has time to count that as a victory. “I didn’t blackmail your buddy into signing the Accords. Believe it or not, the people who agree with me aren’t exclusively stupid or evil. Rhodey and Natasha recruited him. You have a problem with him switching sides, take it up with them. Or better yet,
Rhodey exhales rapidly and Tony marvels at the ease. He slides sheets of medical proxy legalese across the table. He trusts Steve to do right by him but not in this final request.
He’d fallen into a massive cave. The ceiling was a smooth black stone that blotted out the sky. The cave was lit from below and the light reflecting off the virgin snow gave everything a strange, white glow. Stalagmites and stalactites lined the floor and ceiling like teeth in a cavernous mouth. The ground wasn’t rock but a sheet of thick, white ice covering a large underground lake. The source of illumination was buried below the ice sheet, in the water, and the ice itself glowed eerily bright. The whole environs held a horrid, alien beauty.
“Easy, Rogers,” Tony says, not unkindly, but the use of his last name almost throws Steve out of whatever uneasy peace he’s made with the situation.
It’s Tony’s hologram that fades last, eyes still furious and accusatory before dissolving into static. Steve rips the glasses off. They crack in his fist. He’s not sure it’s an accident.
Tony huffed, his own frustration leaking through. “I was thinking more along the lines of a pair of ruby slippers.”
The bones were less disturbing than the other sights. One trench was filled boiling pitch: black tar coating a victim in the act of pulling himself out, caught at the perfect moment of his escape. There was a fire - a real one - at the bottom of a deep crevasse. Tony could feel the heat rising and caught a glimpse of those trinkets the crematorium could not burn away: kimoyo beads and unstable molecules, all cradled in eternal flames.
The mark on Tony’s throat was covered by a fashionable black coat from which a red scarf hung, streaming down like blood. A ritual sacrifice at the altar of Steve Rogers. His gaze was a million miles away. “His revenge consumed him. The night of the revels he was so fixated on punishing me he didn’t recognize his one true love, back from the dead, and standing right in front of him."
But there was nothing. On the screen Tony had been glorious in technicolour: fashionable and charming and untouchable. He’d smiled, lower lip curling slightly upward, a calculated ploy to draw his mark in. The interviewer leaned closer, unable and unwilling to resist the promise of more. For a moment Tony’s eyes flicked towards the camera and Steve had thought maybe Tony could see him.
Steve averts his stare, propriety catching up with him. He can feel colour rush to his cheeks. Tony gives a small laugh from somewhere outside his field of view.
Bucky would never hold Steve snapping against him but it still hurts to reopen his eyes and nod. He expects to be let up. Bucky doesn’t let him.
. Fuck him. He was my personal hell, he doesn’t get to be yours too. You don't even know what he - “ Tony bit off the rest before huffing. “Ignore me, it’s been a long day. I’ll let you sleep, Cap.”
He watches from the sidelines as Natasha and Bucky spar in the North Wing and the pair of them are a thing of beauty. Twin figures sleek and deadly, more akin to a dance than a fight. Natasha’s back on her feet and her form is improving as her body heals. Bucky’s arm is no longer the weapon it once was but it doesn’t slow him down. Neither of them are taking it easy but they make it look so simple that the doctors don’t notice.
Psychiatrist, psychologist, behaviorist. Steve doesn’t remember the difference but he remembers what Zemo pretended to be and how terribly that went for everyone. Steve was a fool for believing that Stark and the government could keep Bucky safe. If the stranger’s here to activate the Winter Soldier then the Avengers are currently under attack and -
When pencil gets too blurry, Steve switches to pen. When that’s not enough he breaks out the watercolours buried at the back of his closet and mixes heavy golds, greens, blues, crimsons. His memories are bathed in glorious technicolour regardless of how black and white they seem in the moment. Once on the page the paints bleed into each other, haemorrhaging across the penned outlines.
Apparently he’s wrong. Apparently random men at galas meet Tony’s ineffable standards and Steve does not, even if he'd have turned any offer down flat. The muted disgust must show on his face.
“Hey, Punk.” Bucky's leaning against the (triple-paned and bulletproof) glass with a smirk on his face. Intact and whole and alive - and the entirety of Steve’s life suddenly makes sense again even if he had to tear down every part of who he was to find it.
The adrenaline in Steve’s system amplifies sensation tenfold. Tony bucks his hips up in a futile attempt to dislodge him and accidentally brushes against Steve’s growing interest. Proximity to Tony means one of two things these days and Steve’s body can’t tell the difference anymore.
Rhodes mutters something indistinct and Tony clearly isn’t having it because he gives a high-pitched laugh and that precedes nothing good. Steve’s blood boils, ready to stride in and -
“He moved countries, cut off all his old acquaintances, changed his name to disappear. He never picked up a set of blueprints again. He watched the Americans and the Soviets build up nuclear arsenals until each had enough to destroy the world ten times over. He even built a labyrinth of fallout shelters under our property but he could never quite escape what he'd helped create.” Kovalchyk shakes his head. “He managed to survive just long enough to see his sons grown and off to college. Then one cold day in April he walked out to the bridge over our creek and hung himself for his crimes.”
. It feels like Steve’s insides are being wrung out and exposed in front of an audience. She knows about Bucky and now Stark does too.
“I promise I’ll stay away from him,” Steve says even though she didn’t ask it of him. She’d asked it of Tony.
The longer he looks at her (helpless, and the Black Widow was never helpless) the angrier he gets. They aren’t supposed to get shot by their own allies because they’re supposed to go in alone. He’s angry at Clint for not magically appearing when Nat needed him, he’s angry at Tony for not protecting her better. He’s angry with Bruce for being missing in action. He’s even angry at Natasha for staying; for trying to save them all from themselves instead of running away and saving herself.
He’s out of practice and she takes him to the mat a dozen times. Punching a bag alone isn’t the same as fighting with a partner and she proves it to him over and over again. The Black Widow is an expert in hand-to-hand but it’s still embarrassing. He’s fast and strong but he can’t anticipate her moves like he used to. He’s forgotten and has to relearn.
“Apparently you’re a creature of habit. You didn’t return and she woke me up pretty concerned I was going to find you dead somewhere on Avengers property.”
“He can’t make you do this,” Steve says. Stark’s affixed her name to compromise, plied her with responsibilities she never wanted, and shoved her into the spotlight. Now they’re tearing her apart.
The edge of the desert was just as abrupt as its beginning, the sand butting up against cool, dark soil. The flat meadow that stretched out ahead of them may once have been covered in grass but it had long been upbraided. The little grass that remained had been poisoned yellow by some unknown substance. Long ditches had been dug ten feet deep and a wingspan wide into the raw earth. They wound off into the distance like a sunken labyrinth or the Kafkaesque interpretation of trench warfare.
“Not like that,” Tony sneers like a grenade hasn’t just gone off, “and the sex was surprisingly good considering I was being punished for being me and for not being Barnes at the same time.”
“You gonna sing to me?” Clint asks when he comes to, before he can open his eyes. He can feel how his wrists and ankles are secured to the chair he's sitting in; unyielding, cold metal. His head throbs and his body feels heavy. He's sluggish from the sleeping, but also from the singing, he surmises.
A low whir, and DUM-E's coming over, peering up at him and moving his robot arm in a gesture that somehow, Tony knows means
Loki looks down at himself, but he's whole. Clint sees the target, though; a hole in Bruce's shoulder, spurting blood, and Bruce's eyes widen in understanding before he turns green and grows to three times his size in the span of a few seconds, his shredded clothes falling off him. The Hulk roars in rage, the bullet pushed out of his body and falling to the floor with a clear
“You know, J,” Tony says. “I don't know about the body-and-face parts, although I can fix you up with a body, buddy, don't even worry about that – but far as we know, only humans are affected by this goddamn spell. So that's... that's something, I think. Don't you?”
Tony has mostly kept his eyes closed while this has all been going down, so Steve sits down in the chair their archer vacated before he notices that Tony's awake. “Tony, hey. How are you feeling?”
Phil has a sudden, dreadful feeling that whatever he's walking into here, he's going to be stuck with paperwork for
“Oh.” Steve looks down at his hands. “I don't know. I just – I tried for the entire song, and nothing happened. And then I was just – singing.”
Thor looks down at the amulet. “This is a magical artifact of great value and power,” he says and stares hard at it instead of his brother, who's getting the shit kicked out of him for the second time in a year. Then Thor drops Mjølnir on it and it cracks, Clint suddenly feeling several kilos lighter. Natasha straightens from her near-slouch and Steve sighs with relief. Tony stays unconscious.
“Yes, everything is fine.” Phil leans down to kiss Clint softly, and the man rewards him with a content huff before curling back up in the space Phil vacated.
… Yeah. Clint doesn't have a ready answer for that one. They lapse into an uneasy silence, two heart monitors beeping out of sync and Clint watching his handler's chest fall and rise.
“Tony's gone," Steve tells Bucky when they finally allow him to visit. "He wants to spend Christmas in Malibu.”
Steve takes several long, angry gulps of whisky to prevent himself from retorting. In contrast Tony draws himself inward, wrapping his jacket to ward off the chill.
Some of the graves had been dug deep, some shallow, some half-covered with earth. Any bones they saw had been picked white by desiccation and were all jumbled up like puzzle pieces fresh out of the box. Too many skulls were mixed in with too few spines. One grave held only ribcages with broken sternums where an arc reactor would have fit. Another had whole skeletons with their heads turned completely backwards, the empty chain of Agamotto still resting around their twisted necks. One ditch was perfectly orderly: row upon row of femurs stacked nearly to the brim with a crowning border of skulls resting atop, rising out to critique their interlopers like Waldorf and Statler at the opera.
He hates that surrounded by people he cares about he has managed to lose everything. He hates that he can’t stop himself from sabotaging what little he has left. Something or someone has to change and everyone else already has. He feels like the lone straggling survivor after a disaster, staring at the rubble and unable to move on while around him the world adapts. Bucky’s re-emerged, Natasha’s a leader. Wanda’s left home, Sam’s struck out on his own. Vision’s becoming more human and Stark dug under his skin to become something less. Steve’s the only one who hasn’t changed. He doesn’t know how. He’s lost.
The grey wisps of smoke rise to the heavens. It smells acrid, awful and wonderful, like aftermath and catharsis. The wind blows a billow of smoke into Tony’s face and suddenly there’s cleansing fire in his lungs, burning him from the inside out, and then -
Tony walks to the edge of the porch to stare suspiciously up at the clouded sky. “We’re going to need them all for what’s coming. And more.”
He’d show up at Steve’s door at midnight; clothes dishevelled, bruises optional. Sometimes he’d smell like sex: alpha pheromones reeking off him or omega fluids stuck to his skin. Steve could barely look at him. He wondered if that was the point Tony was trying to prove; standing defiant under the scrutiny. But most of the time when Steve opened the door Tony was dripping wet from the shower, scrubbed down to the bone, like with enough soap and scraping he could smell like nothing. Steve could always smell the sea.
Tony’s eyes have a dark glint and when Steve finally figures out what he means he can feel a blush rush to his cheeks. There are things two men can do with each other that the two of them have never done. The combination of modern porn and ‘40s fear has rendered the act into something over-the-top and obscene in Steve’s imagination. He prefers hands and walls and silence, Tony likes mouths and dirty talk and off-label uses of furniture, but the closest they’ve come to something more involved is Stark’s fingers wandering to the skin behind Steve’s sac. He’d just assumed that Tony didn’t do more, or didn’t like it.
It turns out Robert Kovalchyk may have lead an unremarkable life but his father, Grzegorz Kowalczyk, did not. Grzegorz was a Polish scientist who immigrated during the war and ended up a consultant for the American government. He did work for Hayes, for Oppenheimer. The more Steve reads the more sure he is that Grzegorz was a prime candidate for SHIELD; intelligent and driven with no home to return to, except half a year after the war Grzegorz’s life just blanks.
It's a taunt. Stark could have fixed it if he wanted to. Instead he gave it back to Steve, a brutal reminder of what happens to obsolete weapons now out of fashion. Steve wasn’t going to let Stark hand it over as if it were just another possession that didn’t mean anything to either of them. Anger sustains their relationship these days. Their interactions are built around accusations, feints, and appeals. If they stopped that would mean that what happened between them was history, set in stone. Too late to change. Steve had marched straight into Stark’s office and -
Steve catches a glint of gold out of the corner of his eye. Like molten lava a tide of liquid metal comes flowing down Tony’s gauntleted hand, wrapping his arm. It bubbles out of his skin, flooding his chest and throat and legs, coating him in gold like a man under Midas’s touch. Steve drops back in horror. The dark red plates of the Iron Man armor assemble overtop and Steve counts five visible arc reactors in constellation across the chestplate. He scrambles back as the Iron Man gets to his feet, fully armored sans helmet.
Phil is driving, hands on two and ten, feeling the slight twinge of his chest every time he turns the steering wheel too much to the right, when he feels the Urge again. He sighs and feels grateful that he's alone – though out of some sixth sense he doesn't fully understand, he knows that he is not the only one singing this song. Even if he can only hear his own voice.
It’s easy to talk to Francesca but in the real world Steve struggles to get what’s inside of him out without distorting it beyond recognition. “I’m worried about you and your… upgrade. You keep telling me I shouldn’t be. It would help if I knew more.”
“Of course,” Richards looked mildly offended, “barring the low statistical probability of cardiac arrest.”
“Oh? How? Target practice gone awry?” Clint asked before squinting. “You aiming at someone in particular?”
Tony tucked his hands where he couldn’t see them. The illumination from the burning oil threw the forest beyond into stark relief. Giant malformed trees gathered closely: leafless and lifeless and looming. Tony staggered across the bleeding river towards them like a child reeled in by the novelty of strangers. Steve followed like a shadow behind.
Tony’s face becomes utterly expressionless. “This is a bad position for this,” he mumbles, twisting. “Lube’s in the top drawer.”
Steve eyes him warily before he picks up the shards of glass around Tony’s feet and dumps them in the sink.
The implication is clear enough. A trade: a sober night for the ability to skip his medical exam. Everything with Stark these days is a bargain. Bucky used to tell Steve to pick his battles but the lesson had remained more or less an abstract concept until Tony. This isn’t a fistfight in an ally. This is a million minor disagreements fought with posturing and words, and Steve feels every one grinding him down. He’s finally learning his lesson and with every concession he feels like he’s giving up a piece of himself.
He tells himself it’s luck that the first person who strolls through the living quarters that night is Robert Kovalchyk.
The armor is hovering close enough that if probably could but Steve shakes his head. He has to be sure so it has to be him. “You can’t trust your life to a machine.”
A snarl bursts out of Tony and Steve snatches his hand back at the tone even if the curses pass him by. It probably merits another I'm sorry. Steve can only hope that his hands stroking loose and soothing at Stark's sides is interpreted as the apology he can't bring himself to say.
The blossoms Tony coughs up these days are already dead: decaying brown petals, withering already. Flowers after first frost.
This was why Logan hung around the Mansion, what Bruce had been doing on his hiatus, and why Reed seemed to live here now.
Tanaka blinks like it’s obvious. “His guilt, of course. We’ve tried to emphasize living in the present but he still stumbles around anniversaries.” They stare at Bucky through the glass and Steve hates that it feels like they’re ogling an exhibit at a zoo. “The reappearance of the Soldier is a stress reaction. Unlike previous incidents Sgt. Barnes can’t seem to deal with this spike consciously so he’s slipping into a dissociative state.”
Neither of them had bothered rebuilding the broken bridge between them. Tony was busy smoothing over their edges with sex and Steve was waiting around for someone else to come fix it. They have to stop.
“Really? Because from the outside this looks like the world’s shoddiest escape plan. What’s the next step Master Tactician, survive on coffee and run away on foot? To where?”
“Well then, I guess he’s completely forgotten about it,” Bucky says dead-eyed from where he’s just thrown up in the garbage can. Steve allows himself a bit of relief that the sarcasm means Bucky hasn’t retreated into a silent shell of himself.
Natasha’s mask hardens again. “For all intents and purposes you’re his jailer. He’s stuck here. He needs you.”
At Stage 4 there is nothing left to be done medically and old wives’ tales are all Tony has left. He just has to get his husband to love him like he used to. Even if it seems like Steve already does. Steve comes home and makes an effort. He compliments Tony, he makes love to him, comforts him. When he leaves apologetically for a mission, it’s the job they both signed up for. Tony doesn’t know what’s missing; what he’s misplaced.
He was worried Bucky might track him down, or Carol might decide his self-exile was over. He was utterly unprepared for who caught up with him.
“Or what?!” A muffled voice yells. There’s the bass thump of something hitting carpet. “What are you going to do?”
It hurts to stay still but Steve holds himself fast. He just watches, vaguely hypnotized, as Tony jiggles the clinking keys in contemplation, the weight too light for the very real possibility they hold the fate of the world.
“I was the blushing bride to Captain America,” Tony joked when Steve had finally gathered the courage to ask. Then he sighed and his voice turned serious. “It wasn’t you, Steve. I never found you over there. Believe me, I looked.”
Kovalchyk’s face is infinitely sad. “After a fashion. You see Captain, my father’s war ended in May 1945 with the surrender of Nazi Germany. The bomb he poured all of his hard work and hatred into was never deployed in the European theatre. Instead Truman dropped it on Hiroshima in September. Five days later, another was dropped on Nagasaki.” His laugh is a mere exhalation. “I’m not sure my father spared a single thought for Japan during the entirety of the war and then,” he snaps his fingers, “he had helped wipe out two cities. He didn’t have enough hatred left for that.”

Steve stripped him out of his undersuit as cold fire rained down around them. A finger breeched him and if there was any pain it was deadened by this place and eclipsed by the elation of having Steve inside him. He could give Steve this to tide him over until Tony could figure out the rest. Steve’s silhouette was rutting over him as he chased down the only bit of pleasure available to him in this place. Tony stared upward into the lifeless eye-slits of an Iron Man faceplate suspended in the branches above and couldn’t look away.
The silence that befalls the Compound immediately afterward is deafening. Steve watches from his suite window as an ordinary yellow taxi pulls up and Rhodes stumbles toward it, duffle bag throwing off his balance on his exoskeletal legs. A humanoid shadow walks up behind him and Steve’s hopes lift for a moment only to be dashed. It’s not Tony, it’s Vision. The android carries Jim’s bag to the waiting taxi and then the car speeds off, red running lights fading into the night.
“The mission ends once you’ve cleared Medical, until then you’re under the council’s purview.” He stalks forward. “Inebriation on duty is cause for immediate removal from rotation.”
Stark’s stare is steady. “Of course you don’t. You just chased me down and dug your fingers into my side because you thought it would
“Stark got eaten alive for years." Her voice doesn't betray any emotion Steve can recognize. "It’s my turn.”
Steve’s gaze slid down Tony’s throat to the reddened mark and could only hope that he gave what was needed.
He’d been so preoccupied with compartmentalizing Bucky and Tony in his mind that he’d forgotten they’re linked in reality in irrevocable ways. “It’s only the 10th.” It sounds like an excuse.
So Steve spends Christmas Eve in the North Wing with a box of saltines he stole from the common room. It’s barely enough to be a snack for them these days but it would have constituted a feast once upon a time. Crackers and company. Steve has no other gifts to give.
Bucky went the other way. He drifted as far away from Avengers Mansion as he could get, repelled like a magnet. Only Steve seemed to notice that Bucky ducked out of any room Tony entered. It didn’t seem hostile but it bothered him, even if the want for distance seemed mutual.
“No. It was all me. I just saw you and,” Steve swallows, “I assumed when I shouldn't have. You deserve better than that. You’ve made so much progress. I should have believed in it.”
Tony does a double-take as if he too forgot the current status quo. “Chalk it up to muscle memory,” he shakes his head and it's nearly fond, “we did this too many times.”
“The worst part of it was they all loved him. You’d think that regularly executing your own citizens would put a damper on hero worship, but it didn’t. It made perfect sense to them: every time I got out, bad things happened. Who were they going to believe, the war hero or the war criminal? No one believes the Devil’s innocent.” Tony shrugged. “And I’m not really. My crimes more or less align with Stark’s, not that the Captain had any way of knowing that. Karma’s a bitch.”
From the parapet of stone Steve had looked out over their empty kingdom. The meadows of brilliant green rippled in the non-existent breeze. The sky was an unnatural crystal blue the exact shade of Steve’s uniform and the sun was nothing more than a topaz gemstone hung at high noon. The moon, when Tony remembered to call down the night, was a translucent pearl on dark navy velvet. Steve took no credit for the landscape, Tony was in charge these days. They could not sleep in the Ether, they could not dream. They could only create and so Tony had built them a home: this castle, this meadow, this sky.
Bucky fidgets like he wants to tear them from Steve’s hands. “You know he tells them all, right? Or I guess his lawyers do. Sends ‘em round to the next of kin of everyone on the list. Like war telegrams.”
He leads Steve out of the workshop, the lights automatically dimming behind them. He’s limping, muscles clearly stiff, as they go up a flight of stairs Steve didn’t know existed to one of the guest living quarters. Tony barely waits until they’re inside before he’s pressing himself into Steve, licking into his mouth. It’s not the worst cure for insomnia and even after a three week absence they fit as well as they ever did. At least Tony isn’t avoiding him now. Maybe he finally believes in Steve's goodwill or maybe he’s just desperate enough for a drink, or a friend, or sleep that it doesn’t matter that Steve is all he has left.
If you’re keeping track, Steve breaks every promise he makes save the last. Neither Tony nor Steve manage to actually keep a secret either: everyone knows they’re sleeping together, that Steve’s in love with Bucky, that he’s visiting the North Wing. Tony doesn’t manage to hide his bruised ribs, his dalliance at the gala, or Kovalchyk. Tony gives Steve the same speech in Chapter 5 that Natasha gives Tony in Chapter 2. Steve’s rants in Chapters 2 and 4 about abandoning your responsibilities in favour of wallowing in your own pain are, of course, peak hypocrisy given that’s exactly what Steve spends this entire story doing.
The smooth synthetic face of crimson and green stares at him intently. “I do not know,” Vision replies in JARVIS’s voice but with more hesitation than the AI ever displayed. His eyes are gold; open and brilliant. “I can stop them, if that is what you believe would help.”
The further they went on the more Tony fell behind. He felt sick and hot. There was a buzzing in his ears as if invisible gnats had made a home in skull. His vision fuzzed around the edges. There was death on either side as he stumbled after Steve who led him like a will-o’-the-wisp further and further into the maze until finally they stopped. Tony fell to his knees and vomited, crawling forward on all fours to where Steve was leaning over an old stone well. The tableau reminded Tony of something he’d seen before, somewhere.
Bucky’s basement apartment is small and cramped. His neighbours are ex-SHIELD agents. He has an outpatient schedule taped to the wall and a mattress on the floor. Steve knows Tony offered more but Bucky declined. On the coffee table is a cardboard box containing an array of brown envelopes standing at attention; all unaddressed, all unsealed. Bucky doesn’t try to give them away anymore but he still writes them. It’s what the dead deserve.
“Nothing. One-hundred-percent alcohol free and black as your soul, Widow. I withdraw my offer, you can get your own coffee.”
Steve looked at him. “I’m sorry for tackling you, just - " he drew a quick breath before whispering, “...please don’t leave me behind.”
A pulse of pain flared across Steve’s chest. The Cursed wound bled red through his white chemise as the Ether rushed to smother the pain, dulling it to a faint persistent whisper in his ear, like a breeze that never died down. It whispered things Steve already knew: that he should be dead already. That this wasn’t life, it was a waking nightmare before oblivion and Tony held the only key to the exit.
Rhodes has the qualifications, the experience. He signed the Accords from the off. “I’d have thought he’d be the ideal candidate.”
Tony's left hand curls around the side of Steve’s neck and Steve can feel the augmented strength of a gauntlet press into the flesh of his throat, sleek metal the exact temperature of the human body. He can feel the pulse of power against his skin, can hear the palm repulsor charging at point blank range. Tony can’t miss. Not this close. Not with Steve’s forearm pressed over his fragile beating heart. Steve still has the gauntlet watch is pinned to the ground. Where on Earth did the second one come from?
The Compound is dry. The Sitting Duck (and what a terrible name) has become the unofficial Avengers hangout for when they need a beer. It’s so normal now that it’s difficult to remember that Tony’s sobriety didn’t come easily. Steve can’t get drunk regardless of how many drinks he has. Tony can’t have one for the flood that follows.
“I haven’t asked him for anything since he came back.” The words scratched Steve’s throat on the way out. “He’s said no, I don’t expect him to change his mind.”
Of course he does. It’s not the same for Bucky, who volunteered once and paid for it dearly. Steve’s bones ache from the effort it takes to keep himself here, feet planted where Bucky needs him. It’s that devotion that prevents him from stealing Quinjets and diving headlong into typhoons. He can stop himself from running off but he can’t stop himself from wanting to. He is war down to his bones in a way the Starks never were even when they were better at it.
“Who should I call?” Steve asked solemnly as Tony wiped his latest attempt with the back of his sleeve, pre-heat restlessness causing the motion to be jerky instead of smooth.
For a moment Steve just watches, intrigued. Then his eye catches the cyan numbers flashing on the digital clock: 3:24 am. No one’s supposed to be up here. Steve’s not supposed to be up here.
That’s all the warning Steve gets before Stark socks him. A sucker punch to the left side of his unguarded torso. It hurts.
If Steve has to have someone pressed up against the wall, hands buried under shirtsleeves desperately searching for skin, it should be someone he loves, someone he likes. Someone at the very least who likes him. It should be Sharon or Peggy. Or Nat or Bucky if they’d have him, and if Steve dared.
“Nothing,” Steve chokes out. “There’s nothing you can say.” He can’t stop himself from reaching for Stark but it’s with an open hand instead of a fist.
“Good,” Stark says and Steve glares, all careful neutrality forgotten. “The longer it takes to break his conditioning the stronger his legal defense for
There's a reason Steve is hyper-sensitive to his name when Tony says it and he's thankful for it now, but the rest of his auditory recall logs the rushing white noise of combat and nothing else. He tries to shrug, feeling every ounce of the weight on his shoulders resist. “It was a lot to take in at once.” He tries to make it sound normal, like a mistake anyone was bound to make.
Tony’s eyes fly open as he inhales sharply and bats Steve’s hand away, hard. “You know, our relationship would make more sense if I thought you were an actual sadist.”
It’s a reminder of what they used to have. When post-mission bickering was just that. “Go to Medical. Get cleared.”
“Why?” Steve answers his own question when his eyes alight on Kovalchyk still sipping his tea. “You don’t want any record of him being here. What are you using him for? A second opinion? Bucky’s doctors have to cleared by - “
“No, that’s never the way round it goes, is it?” Tony’s eyes glittered cruelly. “I play the part so much better than you.” He was too close now and Steve could feel the heat of his body. “You’re such a forgiving soul. What do I have to do to you before you finally get it? Erase your mind a third time?”
Oh Steve’s seen Rhodes angry - he’s even seen him pissed at Tony on more than one occasion - but he’s never heard him climb down into the mud-slinging contest that is fighting with Tony over something that you think matters and that he thinks doesn’t. Now Steve knows that he is not the exception; better men are reduced to it too.
But MODOK smiled the same way Steve’s devil always had. His head wound didn’t bleed because this MODOK had been a robot too. From inside the fake-MODOK a white light started pulsing faster and faster -
“He never knew I was here. Not at the beginning. I needed to know how much he remembered.” She frowns. “Then I needed to find out how much
