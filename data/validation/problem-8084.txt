“Oh, Tony…” She looks at him like she thinks he’s the mad one; like she feels sorry for him, and he tenses up.
The tip of the iceberg to the entire situation is when Peggy Carter marches up to him one day after their joint Magical Creatures class and slaps him hard across the face.  Tony whinges to Pepper and Rhodey afterwards, but neither of them look surprised or sympathetic, the traitors.  Natasha’s only contribution is to declare that her admiration for Peggy Carter has grown exponentially.  Clint smirks as he sharpens his arrows. But Bruce grimaces in sympathy, which is why Bruce is his favorite, really.
“You know what? I don’t care.” James waves his hands in frustration. “Do you know what Tony was even doing that night?”
James walks away and ascends the stairs, leaving Steve with a lot to think about and the sinking feeling that he’s made a big mistake.
Steve’s face heats and his stomach summersaults. “What?”
“How so?” She frowns, and she looks genuinely baffled by his accusation, which is…wow, maybe she doesn’t know how crazy she sounds.
He can hear footsteps pounding the pitch all around them as shadows fall from the sky, but his vision tunnels and goes black before he can do or say anything else.
The hat seems to understand, because it bellows, “Slytherin!” loud enough for everyone to hear.
That might be overstating it, but his mood isn’t great regardless.  So when Rogers finds him in his workshop that night, Tony doesn’t even turn around.  He focuses on the improvements he’s making to his armor, and when Steve comes in and sits down, Tony finally says, “I’d like to be alone, actually.”
That night he decides to get shit-faced, because why the hell not.  It’s not like he usually needs a reason, but on this occasion, it seems more than reasonable.  And the more firewhiskey he drinks, the more reasonable it seems to get into his armor and take it for a spin.  This is all fine and dandy, of course, until he crashes through a window in Gryffindor tower.  There might be an explosion of some sort, he can’t be sure, but when he comes to, a bunch of Gryffindor girls are screaming in his general vicinity.
Steve beams up at him like the sun piercing through the clouds, his big hands resting lightly at Tony’s waist, and Tony kisses him until he’s smiling so wide it’s ridiculous and unwieldy.  But Steve doesn’t seem to mind.  He just tilts his head and kisses Tony long and slow until their smiles fall away and they’re both breathless and aching and perfect.
“Oh, he likes guys,” Sam informs him during Quidditch practice one lazy afternoon as they watch the rest of the team fly drills above them. “You know, if the diversity of his rumored conquests is anything to go by.”
Stone hits the ground to a stunned silence. Steve can’t help smirking at Stark. “Anyone else? I can do this all day.”
Tony spends a lot of time alternating between not looking at him and getting way too familiar with his own right hand.  It’s torture.  And he has an uncomfortable feeling his so-called friends know all about it, because each and every one of them gets this constipated look on their face when they regard him these days.  Clint outright laughs at Tony when he stares at Rogers’s ass for a bit too long during breakfast and accidentally pours scalding hot coffee onto his own lap.  Natasha raises a brow at him and frowns as if she thinks he’s the stupidest wizard on earth, which is…what the hell? He knows Rogers is out of his league, and he’s a lost cause at this point, but is it really necessary to rub it in? The problem is that Pepper and Rhodey have adopted the same look and the treatment is seriously unfair.
“Owww…” he groans and tries to get up, but his armor is locked for some reason and his limbs are too heavy to move.
But even now, years later, the memory of it makes his heart beat quicken and his mouth go dry; his palms go sweaty like he’s still in line in first year, waiting to be sorted.  It’s disconcerting and weird, and he doesn’t like it.  So he distracts himself from that feeling – which only grows stronger over time, damnit – by charming his way into the beds of various classmates.  Of course, he doesn’t realize that should have been a major clue as to the true source of his feelings until it’s way too late and way too inconvenient.
He pops up at his workshop unannounced sometimes, too, his bulk filling the doorway until Tony whirls around and notices he’s there.  He’s glad he doesn’t have a weak heart, because the guy scares the shit out of him, lurking like that in all of his glorious perfection.  Rogers stammers an apology every time, but that doesn’t stop him from ninja-ing his way into Tony’s workshop the next time, and it’s honestly baffling.  Tony doesn’t know whether he likes it or hates it, but he never can drudge up the will to tell the guy to go away.
“Tony,” Steve replies.  He sounds amused and more than a little breathless, which is weird.
“You told me to be honest,” she points out.
Steve shakes his head. “Don’t call it that.”
Natasha scares the shit out of him, but she’s smart and observant.  He can’t say that for a lot of people in his house, unfortunately.  So, in a weird way, they bond – mostly through mutual exasperation.  Tiberius Stone is the only other Slytherin worth knowing. But even then, there’s a voice in the back of Tony’s lizard brain that tells him the kid wouldn't hesitate to hex him at the first opportunity.  And Stephen Strange really lives up to his surname -  patrolling the halls late at night with a cape of all things - until he turns up in the Great Hall for breakfast looking like he’d spent the entire night walking through hell.
"For the love of Merlin, Tony. Shut up," Rhodey tells him, holding his head in his hands. "I will seriously hex your mouth closed right now. You know I have to live with the guy, don't you? I'm never going to be able to look him in the eye again. Oh my god."
James’s gaze hardens. “What does that have to do with anything?”
She places a hand on his forearm and stops him.  “It isn’t pity.  At least, not in the way you think.”
“Right.  Thanks,” Tony adds, still staring at the parts in front of him, and pretending to work.  He’s good at that.  “This project could take a while.  Months.  So…”
Natasha doesn’t say anything, but she looks unimpressed.
Steve wakes up in the Hospital Wing, feeling like an idiot. Bucky and the others are crowded around his bed and he groans.
“Rogers was here earlier,” Clint throws in, overly-casual, but he’s giving Tony a look as he says it.  “He said he wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Heads turn when Steve enters the Great Hall that night, but he’s only aware of one. Tony’s staring at him with his mouth open and Steve tries not to feel too exhilarated. After all, despite all the changes, he still feels like the same Steve – the runt of the litter. But Bucky nudges him and grins. “See what I mean?”
“Actually, technically, I’m a genius,” Tony disagrees.
“You’re an idiot.”
“And you’re emotionally stunted.”
To say it has an impact on his return to Hogwarts for sixth year is an understatement. He doesn’t know what to do with all the attention on the train alone. His ears are permanently burning.
Tony nods and his face heats because he’s still resting his head on Steve’s lap and Steve’s fingers are still rubbing his scalp and grazing his jaw.  He performs a quick scan of the area and realizes he and Steve are alone in what must be the Gryffindor common room.  The pieces of his armor are piled up haphazardly against the wall like they belong there, and he and Steve are on a couch in front of a crackling fireplace.  It’s almost straight out of one of the wet dreams he’s had more than once.  So no one can blame him for pinching himself. "Ow..."
So he takes his sketch book after class one afternoon and walks into the abandoned classroom Tony uses for his transfiguration.
And, of course, the mouthiest of them is Stark. “Hey, short-stuff! At least you won’t have far to fall when Ty wipes the floor with you!”
Peggy turns to go. “He’s all yours.”
“We’ve hit it big, eh, Stevie?” Bucky grins as he drops his trunk beside his own four-poster.
“My aren’t we the genius?” the hat says (thinks?), clearly amused.
It starts when he finds the Slytherin first-year, Tiberius Stone, hexing a Hufflepuff in the halls and he doesn’t hesitate to intervene. Tiberius challenges him to a duel and he’s stupid enough to take it – again, according to Bucky. It’s supposed to be a clandestine meeting in the Great Hall the next night, but word gets out and by the time he arrives, it seems like the whole student body is there.
Tony’s heart aches and he rips his eyes away.  “I hope you find her.”
“Hell yes,” Tony agrees and he sits up and twists around so that he’s straddling Steve’s magnificent thighs.
Luckily, he doesn’t have much time to think about them as he’s swept up in the revelation that is Gryffindor Tower. It’s cosy with its fireplace and plush beds. It’s the fanciest place he’s ever lived.
“Ow…what the hell, Romanoff?”  he yelps, hopping on his good leg.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, earnest and calmer than Tony thinks he should be.
“Sam…”
“Yet, too ambitious for Ravenclaw.”
“You’re sober, though,” Tony tells him.  Just to make sure.
“Huh,” Tony utters.  “Anything broken?”
The first time they do anything intimate, it’s in a broom closet of all places. Tony accosts him outside of class and tugs him inside. Then Tony pushes him against the door and has his merry way with him.
Tony doesn’t last long either. Steve is pretty proud.
The first time Tony sees Steve Rogers, his palms are sweaty and his mind is trapped in a loop of don’t-fuck-up-and-disappoint-Howard-again.  So he only has enough brain cells free to think, ‘damn, that kid’s small’ and ‘probably a Hufflepuff’, before the Sorting Hat falls over the kid’s eyes and bellows, “Gryffindor!” at the top of its metaphorical lungs.  The tiny kid hobbles over to the Gryffindor table amidst a notably shocked silence. But when the kid takes a seat, his new housemates roar their approval like the meat-headed Neanderthals they are.
He doesn’t fully believe that, but then Tony wakes up, color high on his cheeks as he realizes he’s in Steve’s lap. He looks up beneath his dark eye lashes at Steve and Steve just knows. His friends were right all along.
Of course, Tony chooses that night to literally crash into the Girl’s dormitory in Gryffindor Tower and turn all of his assumptions on their head.
Relief washes through him and Tony releases a breath.
Steve blushes all the way to his ears when Tony recounts this to him, but he effectively shuts Tony up by engaging his mouth in other activities.
“Rogers is moping.”  She says this like the idea of it offends her, her nose scrunching in disgust.
Well...after Steve, of course.
“No,” Rogers replies and his face is still flushed.  He rubs a hand along the back of his neck, and looks at Tony with an expression he can’t decipher.
Tony blushes. Again, it’s clear he doesn’t know how to take compliments. “Of course it is. I made it.”
Peggy kisses him on the cheek in the Great Hall that night and echoes Tony, “Ask that Stark-boy to the Yule Ball, Steve. What are you waiting for?”
“Yep.” Sam raises his brows. “He’s been checking out your booty, man.”
“What?”
Tony eventually gets lost in his Transfiguration, manipulating metal and other material into his own inventions – mostly armor, but household items as well, like a talking toaster (he’s sure there’s a use for that in some magical household, even though Bruce vehemently denies it) – and Rogers doodles in his notebook, biting his plump lower lip in the most distracting way possible.  This goes on for hours.  And when it’s over, Tony has to escape without much preamble into one of the washrooms in order to take care of himself before he bursts.
“He was trying to get his inventions back from Justin Hammer, who stole them.”
Pepper’s face is wet and Tony would wince if he had the energy for it.
Sam shrugs. They fall into a comfortable silence. Then Sam turns to him, his expression serious. “You want my advice?”
Bucky laughs so hard he cries when he sees him. Then he gives him a noogie. “You’re bigger than I remember.”
He gears himself up to do it. He’ll do it today, he thinks, as he crosses the threshold into Tony’s classroom.
Steve rolls his eyes, but he pecks him on the lips. “I know you love my ass. I love yours, too.”
“The right partner,” Rogers replies, and Tony can feel his eyes on him so he glances back.  Rogers is staring at him, his expression so damn earnest it physically hurts.
Too late, Steve thinks. “Don’t worry. I won’t.”
Peggy approaches him in the common room and Bucky attempts to chat her up, but she barely looks at him. She sticks out her hand and Steve takes it in a shake.
The day she breaks it off, she takes him aside and says, “I care for you, Steve. But I don’t think you’re really here with me.”
“You never lost me, Tony.”
“What the fuck?” he questions.  But no one is there to answer, obviously.
“Your derriere?”
Needless to say, Steve is a lot better at that, and Tony is not going to be thinking about the ache in his toes the next day.
“What? You wanted to know. I could see it on your face while you moped around this past week.” Sam takes a large bite of an apple and chews it noisily. He swallows and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “And, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but he’s been checking you out.”
Clint Barton from Hufflepuff and Natasha foster a strange bond that Tony will never figure out, but he doesn’t have the balls to ask either of them about the particulars.  By their fourth year, he spends half his time wondering if there’s sex involved, but there’s no definitive proof either way.  So he contents himself by ribbing Clint about his wand, which is a stubby little thing at 4 inches (this is his actual wand not, you know, his other...well, Tony's never seen
He stares at Rogers as the guy opens a notebook with blank parchment and gets to work, but Rogers seems to notice after a while and glances up at him through the veil of his ridiculously long lashes to say, “The light is really good in here.”
“Tell me how you really feel,” Tony deadpans.  “No, really.  Don’t hold back.  It’s unbecoming.”
At the Yule Ball, all of Tony’s friends punch him in the arm when they congratulate him for “finally growing some damn balls, Stark,” as Clint summarizes so helpfully.
Then Rogers comes back Sixth Year, looking like the bulked-up love-child of Apollo and Aphrodite, and Tony has to hole himself away in the abandoned room he’s been using as his workshop just to give himself some time to hyperventilate in peace.  He can’t even handle it.  Rogers has always been beautiful, but now everyone can see it.  Now when Rogers walks into the Great Hall, heads turn and students whimper –
Steve punches him in the arm, but his entire face tingles with heat.
“Bludger to the chest,” Clint replies, and he doesn’t even smirk about it, which is unsettling.
“It’s fine.” Steve replies with a crooked smile. “From the sound of it, he got what was coming to him eventually.”
“Right.” Steve’s voice sounds weak, which is disconcerting, but he’s further away now.  “No problem.”
He goes home to bury his mother on a Sunday, Bucky at his side. It rains that day like God is weeping too. He can only be grateful that it disguises his own tears.
So it’s a genuine relief when Steve leans down and kisses him Spider-man style (what?  He watches Muggle movies).  It’s an awkward angle and their lips catch in weird ways, but it’s the intent that makes it perfect and Tony can’t help sighing into it and clutching the back of Steve’s head to keep him there a little longer.  Steve hums against his mouth and nips his lower lip once before he leans back and regards Tony with that same look of overwhelming adoration Tony has been completely blind to up until this moment.  Merlin…he really has been an idiot. Point to Natasha…and Pepper, and probably everyone else.  God.
So Tony tells Bruce all about it instead. Bruce is clearly uncomfortable, but at least he doesn't threaten to hex him or kick him out of his lab.
“Please tell me no one kissed me,” Steve sighs.
His best friend Rhodey is in the You-Know-What-House anyway, so it isn’t such a horrible color-scheme for Tony to choose.  If anything, he’s honoring that friendship.  After all the shit he’s pulled around him. It’s the least he can do, really.  He’s showing his honey-bear that his House affiliation doesn’t matter to him, despite the fact that Rhodey’s housemates are a bunch of self-righteous jocks, hopped up on whatever the wizard equivalent of steroids is.  Well, Jan’s okay, but she’s dating Hank, who’s a Hufflepuff.  So, obviously, she has some standards.  And Carol was a hat-stall for Ravenclaw.  So at least she has a brain between her ears.
Steve just smiles. “Just wanted to know. It’s…really cool.”
“Oh…um…” Tony’s initial inclination is to deny it - to be fair, that particular memory is a bit fuzzy right now - but Steve is caressing his face with an expression so hopeful it’s impossible to misinterpret.  So...there's that. Wow. He restrains himself from pinching his own arm again. “Yeah.”
Bucky and Steve share a look. And that’s how Sam finds out about Steve’s crush on Tony, much to Sam’s dismay. But Sam is a good person and a good friend, and he tells Steve that even though he doesn’t think Stark deserves him, he supports Steve. Steve doesn’t know what he did to deserve friends like Sam.
Maybe Buck is right. Maybe Steve takes it too far, but he’s always hated bullies and…well, Slytherin is full of them. With Stark at the very top.
“What, Peggy?” Sam questions.
“Okay.” She nods, like she's taking his request seriously.  “You would never make a good spy.  You have terrible observational skills.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Tony gasps.
After a month of this, he thinks maybe he’s getting somewhere with Tony. Maybe they’ve become friends.
“I’ve been better.” Steve sits up with a grimace.
"Get out."
“How you feelin’, Cap?” Dum Dum asks, chewing on his quill.
Steve can only smile back. “Steve…um…Rogers.”
He’s carried back to the Tower on a swell of back-patting and cajoling.
“So tell us,” Steve says. “Why would Stark be in Slytherin?”
Pepper shakes her head, but at least she’s smiling now.  Point for Tony.
Steve grins back. No more shivering on a shared mattress with Bucky while his mother slaves away on the night shift at the hospital in order to bring the heat back on. The dorms here are warm, artificially so. Magically. And isn’t that the kicker? He had no idea magic was even real until he’d received his Hogwarts letter. But here they are. He and Buck, both Wizards.
Needless to say, Tony sleeps with his wand under his pillow. You know, when he sleeps at all, which is basically never.
A great chasm opens up in him that feels like it might consume him whole – a void that he fills with school and Quidditch and even a brief relationship with Peggy.
“It must be all that goat milk and fresh air,” Sam observes.
Steve huffs a laugh, but he doesn’t last long.
Steve jolts then rolls his eyes. But he knows Sam can tell that he’s committed now. No turning back. He’s a man on a mission.
"That's...nice, Tony." Bruce  smiles weakly and Tony beams at him.
The last thing Steve sees is Stark scowl as he helps Stone to his feet, before Steve is carried off by his Gryffindor Housemates in a wave of victory.
There’s way too much yelling, really, and someone is pounding on the door until it bursts open.  Tony takes one look at the figure in the doorway, his head pounding, and something ugly yawns open in his chest as he croaks, “You stole him…you...gimme...”
Rogers is especially unfair.  Without fail, he always stops Tony in the hall to say hi, a disconcertingly shy smile tugging at his lips, and Tony doesn’t even know what to do with that.  Is the guy even real?  He thinks he should pinch himself to make sure, but then Rogers always does something like pat him on the shoulder or clasp his left pectoral in a weird half-hug before he’s walking away like he didn’t just leave Tony’s face burning and his brain melting onto the floor like a pile of useless goo.
Tony basks in it and smiles.  “Steve.”
And surely Steve can hear it, can hear Tony’s traitorous heart beating out a painful rhythm of attraction, and that must be why his face is set in agitation. It can’t be because Tony had just called him for a ride yet somehow found his way back into the house with a girl whose name he didn’t know. Tony barely has time to process that he should be embarrassed before Steve is reaching out a hand, grabbing him by the arm, and yanking him up. He spots the girl on the ground behind Steve as he stands, her face twisted in indignation as she glares at Captain America, and he shrugs apologetically.
He holds onto the feeling for as long he can.
“Tony - Tony, where are you?” There’s a thumping bass beat echoing through the house, pulsing in Tony’s head, drowning out his words as he screams over the music and the talk of the rest of the party goers.
“I’m here, Tony. It’s okay.” The words whisper across the small space between Steve’s mouth and Tony’s ear and Tony feels his head shaking without his permission and his foot is moving backward on it’s own, but before he can take a full step, Steve’s hand is there. It’s sitting on the small of his back, so large it nearly engulfs his spine, and it’s warm, heating Tony through his shirt. Each finger feels electric where it sits, a livewire of sensation nudging Tony forward, encouraging him, reminding him
And then he joins the Avengers and then...he notices. Steve has a tic, a small tell. He jumps lightly, marginally, every time he hears the telltale flick of Tony’s lighter. And then, later, he learns that Steve enjoys the taste of the leftover smoke that always lingers on Tony. He licks it off Tony’s lips, off his hands.
“Luke’s?”
“Time?” His voice is raspy and harsh and it scratches against his burning throat. He tries to swallow again but his mouth is somehow empty and god he’d give his entire inheritance for a glass of -
“55381 Willow Ave, just outside Manhattan.”
So he sticks with the Camels.
And Steve both loves it and hates it. Loves the almost sweet smell of fresh smoke, and the deeper, richer smell of the stale scent that lingers on Tony’s body. Tony is careful, usually, tries to wash it off, but Steve can smell and taste it still. It’s given him a second hand addiction
“Steve it’s- he’s- amazing! He’s almost ready, I think. I have a few more codes that still need tweaking because they’re just...ugh, but. He’s almost done. And he’s going to be amazing, and really useful, not like DUM-E or Butterfingers, and I think dad -”
Tony shivers as the memory of Howard’s anger that day washes through him, chilling him to the bone, and wraps his arms tighter around Steve’s trim waist, seeking the heat that he always seems to emit. He feels Steve’s chest rise and fall with each steady breath, feels Steve turn his head slightly and run a rough hand over Tony's arms. The callouses drag roughly over him, making him shiver for a new reason. He sighs deeply as he feels the ice that had wrapped around his chest loosen and give, breaking up as it always does under the onslaught of Steve’s warmth. He closes his eyes, lets his head fall forward and rest against Steve’s broad shoulders. They’re hard and solid, reminding Tony of where he is and who he’s with. The leather of Steve’s jacket is cool and sticky against his cheek and he breathes deeply, inhaling the thick scent of leather and spice. His mind drifts again as they weave through traffic, wind whipping his hair around and stinging at his face, but he doesn’t go back to Howard. He thinks instead of Steve, only Steve, and the fact that this, here, having Steve in his arms as they drive towards their favorite diner, is what he really longs for. More than the floating euphoria of being high, more than the easy confidence of being drunk, he longs to be filled up with Steve, to feel Steve invading his senses.
Steve is there. Nice Steve. Kind Steve, with his soft eyes and his easy smile, the special one that he only shows to Tony, and he looks at Tony like he’s something precious, something important. Tony likes Steve, likes it when he’s nearby, likes it when he smiles and his eyes sparkle and the blue in them glistens, like sunlight hitting water. He loves the way they glance down at him, bright and sweet. And then his hand is on Tony, holding him tight, tucking him into Steve’s side. Steve is warm and sturdy and the words he’s saying to Howard don’t register in Tony’s mind but he feels security in them, safety. He pulls Tony out of the lab as Howard shouts something, his words bouncing off the door as it shuts, and Tony rushes his little legs to keep up with Steve’s long angry strides. At least until Steve notices Tony huffing as he half runs, and suddenly he cuts his speed in half and smiles down at Tony again. He offers his hand and Tony takes it; it’s big and warm and calloused and fully engulfs Tony’s. He loves it, wants to keep his hand in Steve’s forever, the big fingers curling around his own smaller ones, keeping him safe. Steve leads him down the hallways, hand never leaving Tony’s, and Tony lets himself be lead, not worried about where they’re going, knowing he is safe as long Steve is around.
Once he’s dressed, Steve guides him out of his room with a warm hand on his back and doesn’t drop it until he’s certain Tony can walk in a straight line on his own. It makes Tony feel safe, cared for, sends a warm spike of comfort tingling over his skin from the contact, and Tony tries to focus more on that as they walk than the impending lecture he’s about to get. He knows he fucked up, knows Howard is sure to tear into him, but he can’t bring himself to really care. It won’t be the first time Howard has chewed him out over missing a meeting and it won’t be the last. Besides, the second he comes up with some shiny new tech for Howard to present, he’ll be forgiven and the cycle will reset.
All of my love and thanks to Karma and my boy, PJ, for betaing and inspiring me <3
Tony laughs lightly when Steve mentions that it’s bad for him, as though fighting super villians on the regular hasn’t also shortened his life expectancy. He does get Tony to slow down, though, to have maybe three or four a week. But it doesn’t help that Tony knows Steve enjoys watching him do it, knows that Steve will ask JARVIS to play feeds of him in the lab, where he’s got one dangling from his lips while he tinkers on a bot.
Steve’s smile is soft, indulgent. He leans forward, eyes sparkling with humor, claps his hands in front of him. “Pretty sure this is what most of us call night, Tony.”
“Yeah?” He tries not to sound as exhausted as he feels, tries to bolster his voice, to salvage at least a little of his dignity and not look like he’s all of five years old. It all flies out the window as Steve crouches next to him and brings a hand up, rough fingers brushing tenderly at his still wet cheek, and he knows his eyes are big, showing every emotion he desperately wants to keep locked away inside his chest. Steve looks he is about to say something profound, maybe offer some kind of verbal consolation, but then his eyes rove down over Tony’s body and a quick rush of air blows out of his nose. He stands, goes back to his chair, settles in with a book he grabs off the nightstand, glances back at Tony.
Steve did not remember returning to the tower. In fact, he did not remember much after Venom disappeared. Everything was in a fog until he heard Tony speak. His shock over the comment was instantly wiped away all his downtrodden feelings.
Peter bit down on his lip upon the reflections. He never saw what Uncle Tony had been doing as fatherly until now. Guilt instantly weighed heavily upon his shoulders.
Natasha had trained with James and she had killed with him. But, she had never been in the field with him, fighting hand-to-hand and special ops. They had only killed together from afar as he was training her in sniping and other long range kills.
“War Monger?” Steve asked, quirking his eyebrow. “You are the last person I'd call a War Monger.”
Tony stirred and his grip tightened on the toy Steve had left in his hands. Tony rubbed his eyes with his closed eyes with his free hand and he murmured, “What’s up, J?”
Dead.
Steve dropped his head and felt his eyes heat up. It had been years since the unfairness of the situation affected him so. He tried to keep his emotions to himself but sky darkened above them and the field they had been sitting on appeared more ominous in the dark.
Tony entered the kitchen looking both irate and petrified.
Tony read a few lines and then gasped, “What…What the fuck?”
“Mr. Stark, you need to stay here! We have to discuss this. Your level of incompetence nearly cost us a teammate!” Steve yelled, angered by Tony’s uncaring reaction to almost killing Clint and trying to leave the scene like it was nothing.
Tony did not see the other two’s reactions as he was caught by Steve’s instant dazzling smile. He rushed forward and embraced Tony.
Bucky nodded stiffly but Tony could see tears gathering in those frustrated eyes.
“You asked yourself how much longer you could do it? Do what exactly?” Peggy murmured with interest.
Clint was strangely silent and watching them walk with a clinical eye but he suddenly ginned.
“Great! Toast it is! In the meantime...” Tony opened up new holograms for Bucky and said, “Let’s check out some old photos and spark some memories, shall we?”
Her brave, sweet, and loving super soldier was dead.
But, more importantly, he remembered holding a bloody implant out to the memory of his target, and pleading to the woman, “
Peter and Wade were too wrapped up in each other to notice Logan’s suspicions. He was happy for them, he really was…Those two had been wallowing in their loneliness long enough.
He'd been denied a relationship with the man and it made Peter upset. And then it upset Peter even more that he was upset by that because Stark wasn't his father! Richard was! It was a constant circle of upset and anger that he could not find a release for.
them a lot.”
Steve kept imagining Tony thinking him dead.
He was surprised to find Bucky was actually at the spot. He expected for him to wait in the shadows until Steve got there and then sneak up on him. Yet Bucky was there, leaning against the railing and watching the boats go by just as they used to decades prior.
“We’re not going if James doesn’t consume any liquids today,” Natasha murmured, sliding next to Bucky. She placed a bowl of oatmeal and a mug of tea in front of her. She began to eat leisurely but her shoulders were rigidly set in a way that spoke volumes to her lover.
“Ready to go to bed, baby boy?” Wade murmured gently.
Jarvis had already moved the elevator to Steve’s floor and the metal doors were waiting and open for them.
“Jarvis has been watching all of the city’s cameras,” Tony replied. Steve’s eyes flickered up and easily found one of the glass black domes which concealed one of the hospital’s cameras. Of course, how could he forget about Jarvis?
Steve nodded and was the one to lead Tony through the barriers. Tony stuck close to his side and because of that Steve was able to hold his head high and keep his face expressionless as he made his way into the courthouse.
“Where in D.C.?” Clint asked.
Steve was all big eyes and quiet as they undressed. They never had been naked in front of each other and Tony felt a little nervous too.
“I have no idea what you are referring to,” Tony replied airlessly, not wanting to admit it yet. He’d hurt Peter and Wade because of his stubbornness to disbelieve what was now so obvious. He wanted to apologize, truly apologize, and let them know his eyes are open. For now, he’d dance around it with Steve, but Wade and Peter deserved the admission from Tony first.
It reminded him of when he first kissed Tony under the stars in the shadow of the base. Steve’s heart at the time had swelled with emotion and every touch was magical. He had wished that moment had never ended because for the first time in his life he was kissing a man more for their hearts than anything else…
“He will love Peter!” Bruce promised. “And so will the others!”
Steve glanced at his watch, it was a little after 3 a.m. He got a couple hours of sleep. Looking at the dark bags under Bruce’s eyes, Steve knew his friend got absolutely no sleep.
He paused at the top of the stairs and stared at the sealed door blocking him from his destination.
Steve cupped his cheek and his eyes grew shiny as stared into Tony’s eyes. He promised, “I will always be there for you. Here or the dream world, love…”
Like most people of this century, he checked his phone and noticed he missed a call from his old family friend and texted him back letting him know they were alright.
The hope he once had for returning home was unraveling as quickly as a falling ball of yarn. He was never going to see his friends again. He was never going to say goodbye.
Steve had just rubbed him off and solicited him for sex but, upon Tony’s suggestion, he turned beet red. Tony laughed and humped his hips under Steve’s teasingly.
He knew the body would not be there but he expected that the body had been stolen.
“What the fuck, Nat?! How else would you explain matching Barnes and resisting Thor!” Clint yelled. He straightened his broke nose with a grunt but did not go back to trying to get her off Bucky.
“You did nothing wrong,” Peter promised him. “I ignored them too and, well, it’s gone. What we did or didn’t do doesn’t matter anymore.”
“Us?”
Peter shook his head at his dad’s last statement. He knew the nightmares were nowhere close to being over. He might be haunted by them for the rest of his life but he could live with that…what he could not live with was the living nightmare Pops was stuck in because of Peter.
Steve was smiling widely now and that hope was shining in his eyes again.
Norman never revealed his true identity to the robot or, its master, the Chameleon. To explain his access to Oscorp, he told them he was a confidant of Norman Osborn. And he revealed to the cyborg that his transformation was due to Oz, a compound made in the Oscorp labs…
Tony observed, “No one is going to say this isn’t real! I can’t wait to see the pictures! Though I bet a few are going to be too naughty for daytime television,” Tony teased, cupped the back of his head, and rubbed the tip of his nose against Steve’s playfully.
“Tony, you need to get out of there,” Steve hissed, ignoring his observation. Large portions of the house were falling in the ocean.
Tony lay himself against him, pressing his body flush to Steve’s. They simultaneously groaned as their hard cocks pressed against each other. His erection strained against his trousers and made all the more sensitive to any touch and Tony was probably feeling the same in his jeans.
“I want you,” Bucky whispered, his eyes flashing with heat.
Steve did as commanded but eyed the device uneasily. Tony ran it over his face and he felt the plastic pieces glide painlessly over his face but never felt the blades as his hair fell away. The razor buzzed loudly in his ears, but Steve never really noticed it, too entranced by his fiancé. Tony’s eyes were on the razor and held the same kind of intensity for the attention to detail as when he worked on a delicate piece of machinery.
“An initiative made to protect the Earth in the greatest hour of its need using a collaboration of its mightiest heroes…We-we want you to lead them,” Coulson stated.
“He called me his possession,” Steve murmured, grasping Peter’s tiny hand. “He said, ‘You are mine,’ then kissed me…And when I felt his lips on mine, I…I felt something.”
But Steve betrayed him anyways…and this betrayal hit him harder than anything other deceitful actions made toward him in his entire life.
Peter nodded and Pops’ brows pinched together.
He just wanted to be another stranger and buy some parts…
“Got it, Cap,” Tony said with a nod and ran over to the roof access. As soon as he disappeared behind the door, Steve began his ten minute countdown.
“Yes, because it sounds like you are weirdly flirting with me and your boyfriend is standing only five feet away from me.”
Tony must’ve fallen asleep first because the dream world was just darkness and it scared him awake.
“Love, please don’t antagonize them!” Steve gasped, helping Tony sit up.
Tony and Steve turned toward Peter and each draped an arm over him. Steve rubbed Peter’s chest and Tony patted his belly. Neither questioned him as to why he was there because it was obvious. This was the first time the Tower had been breached since Loki attacked New York and Peter had not been born at that point. It must have been frightening for him to suddenly realize their home was not a perfect haven.
Whatever the reason, he clearly couldn’t save Bucky anymore. Tony had to save Steve from this grisly fate as Hydra’s puppet but…
Peter grinned sheepishly and murmured, “Didn’t sleep in enough. I need to make myself a pot! Does anyone else want some coffee?”
“Are you kidding? How could I not make something for this adorable specimen of stars and stripes! Have you decided who you are going to name godfather yet? I humbly apply for the position.”
Steve stared at the photo in shock and Cable growled, “Now your future is starting to disappear!
Tony moved them so they were leaning into each other, hip to hip. He draped an arm across Steve's back and rested a hand on his shoulder. Steve did the same and found his face only inches from Tony’s. They exhaled at the same time and their warm breaths intermingled between them.
Because Tony was dead.
“…I’m just going to remind you two that we have open communicators so
“Back off, Tony,” his target bit harshly.
She seemed to understand and whispered, “You’re happy, James.”
Her eyes were riveted on the man before her.
Sam had stayed with him until he could breathe and then stayed to talk him through it. Steve told him about his and Tony’s relationship through broken gasps and Sam did not judge either of them but told him to stay strong and not give up on him. Someone wanting to betray him would have turned tail and run at the first sign of tears.
He hurried upstairs and didn’t notice the odd silence of his AI, who would usually announce who the caller was…
“Oh, I don’t know. I forgot his name. You know, I don’t know what I had for breakfast this morning,” Tony replied to her.
Steve sat Peter on the railing but kept a firm hold on his waist and a wary eye on Peter’s strong tiny hands. Peter leaned forward and only watched the lemurs as they lounged against the topmost branches. Any movement from them made Peter twitch from excitement.
“Hey, why am I Subject B?” Eddie whined.
“What…is that?” Jim gasped and everyone’s attention was directed to the flickering blue glow that was being revealed.
At first, Peter avoided Tony and Tony believed he might have blamed Tony for what happened to Steve. Yet, after the funeral, Peter changed. He latched onto Tony and refused to let go. It was enough to make Tony weep again and he held his son for what felt like hours. From that point on, Peter took comfort in Tony’s nearness and would hold him whenever he was given the chance, Tony happily returned the embraces and held him for as long as he needed.
“And Patrick Swayze is?”
“Maybe they should not spar,” Steve murmured as he paused to watch Natasha catch Peter’s tiny fist in the palm of her hand. Natasha was training Peter how to punch with his non-dominant hand. She had no idea what they planned.
Peter clenched his fists, the answer to his question already dawning on him, and demanded, “Why?”
Steve’s hold on him tightened and Tony found himself clutching his super soldier.
Tony dropped his head and clenched his fists, hissing, “Don’t say that…”
And why did they have to do it today of all days?
Bucky heeded his words and sprinted over to Peter. He picked up the boy from behind around the waist and Peter’s eyes widened with surprise. His shock gave way in seconds and he kicked wildly at the air and demanded, “LET ME GO! LET ME HELP HIM!”
The machine in front of Gary hissed and Gary’s hands moved quickly, turning knobs and positioning the paper cup. A moment later, he handed Tony his cup and his boyfriend accepted it with a happy sigh.
“Keep trying to get in contact. Try Phil’s personal cell too,”
And he said ‘dad.’
“Did he say relationship problems?” Tony murmured under his breath and looking at Wade with a narrowed gaze. His eyes focused on Wade’s hands which held Peter quite familiarly. Would their future son
He felt one of them try to pick him up but he shook the person off and threw the agent across the room. He leveled his glare at the others and snarled, “Get off of me! I’ll kill you! I’ll—!”
My brother and I are doing well, and I should be able to start posting regularly again. Thank you for your patience! Now enjoy the new chapter! :)
“If Cap goes to the fundraiser with Stark, then we calculate his true identity will be discovered within fifteen minutes –
Peter’s shoulders slumped forward and he smiled at the madman.
Reminder for Graphic Violence and AU tag! This isn't going to be like Captain America: Winter Solider or other Cap cannon! :)
.” Steve slammed down the mesh ball in frustration. He bent down to one knee to pick it up but did not get up and rubbed his eyes. With Steve no longer standing, the water from the shower head hit Tony at full force.
Peter stood and Aunt May came around the table to embrace him tightly.
“We don’t have to worry about Stark until he needs the reactor. The Goblin is a twisted fuck which is why he went back to the future with the reactor. He probably wanted you and Peter to watch while Stark begged for his life or just for you two to see him die. He
Tony stared down at the model his father had made of the first Stark Expo and saw the element he’d slaved over hidden its design.
Memories filtered back into his mind and made less sense than what had happened.
“We need to get our clothes off
“Nah,” Steve replied. “I’ma not gonna die on you. We haven’t had make-up sex. I owe you…”
“Because maybe it worked!!” Tony hissed. He pushed himself off Steve and glared at Bucky. He growled, “If it pissed her off she would have shoved it down your throat! Now get out of my room before I shove my pillow down your throat instead!”
Both men nodded curtly but made no move to sit down. Tony spared one last look at Steve and then cut communication off to the outside as he commanded, “J, run a systems check.”
After Tony swallowed his food, he chuckled to Bucky, “Not one for subtleties I see.”
He didn’t think he would be able to fight with Bucky until he met Dr. Erskine and his entire life changed.
“Not later, now,” she retorted, crossing her arms over her chest. She stated, “We talk this farce out and give Steve some space to calm down. It’s a win-win situation.”
Tony cleared his throat and huskily said, “Yeah, yeah I can do that…”
Steve
“Puny God,” Hulk growled, spit began to foam at the corners of his mouth. “Puny God take Hulk brother. Puny God bully Hulk family.”
Tony removed the face mask first and said, “You will call her Pepper and me, Tony. Clear?”
celebrity weddings…You aren’t going to marry Wade any time soon, are you?”
“Hi, Petey,” he greeted the toddler warmly.
When the two peoples finally converged into one, it was a loud and boisterous affair. The Americans wore orange jumpsuits too though they had small American flags on their right shoulders. Whereas the Russians were all pale and had either blond or brown hair, the American group was a mix of races and colors. Steve was excited to see such diversity. His own team, the Howling Commandos, was the first team to ever have mixed race in the Army and that was only because Steve had fought adamantly for it. And now it seemed to be a norm. How much more did the future change?
“We-We’re going to have to do it again,” Steve stated what Tony was most likely going to allude to. They were going to have to make out again…Steve both longed and feared it. Could his sanity and heart handle it a second time?
Dum Dum was also falling all over the place but that was mostly because he was drunk.
Tony woke to Steve slipping out of the cot. Tony moaned and reached out to him to come back but, a moment later, Howard stepped into the tent and was probably the reason Steve left him in the first place. He was as glad he did it because there was no way he was getting in that awkward conversation with Howard.
Howard's eyes lit up and refocused on Tony. He swallowed his food loudly and rested his chin on his fist and drawled, “Well, well, well you just became mildly interesting…”
“Peter this is Papa’s friend. He’s your Uncle Bucky.”
Steve and Tony shared breakfast and they spoke of other things that got Tony out of his foul mood. Spending time with Steve just did that for him. The man was naturally soothing to Tony. His smile alone usually lifted Tony's spirits.
Peter’s stomach clenched tightly. He was sooo hungry.
Their bodies melded together almost seamlessly, like they were made for each other. They were perfect for each other and, as Wade kissed him so preciously, it made it hard for him to remember how he’d lived without Wade for so long.
He couldn’t lose either and the fight seemed to be leading for him to lose both.
“Sir?” Coulson answered. Surprise flickered over his expression and he said, “Yes, sir.”
The moment Thor had pushed Hulk aside, Steve turned back to Tony. In the few seconds Steve had taken his eyes off him, he had not moved at all. He leaned over Tony, his vision beginning to blur from his uncontrollable tears, and he gasped, “
“I did – I mean – I do – I, well, we barely had time to discuss getting married nonetheless raising a family. Truthfully, I didn’t even think it was an option because we were both men but if we can get married in this era then it stands to reason that we can adopt together too…Did – ah – Did you want kids?” Steve asked, nervously.
But, it was also something Steve had craved. Neither of them brought it up before because of the newness to their romantic relationship and the dire situation Tony was in, in the real world. But now...
He was the first to reach out and touch Steve. He ran the tips of his fingers down Steve’s chest, over his abdominal muscles, and just barely brushing his cock. Steve shivered but leaned into his touch.
As the boy grew, he showed remarkable progress and powers. Hydra excitedly whispered about finally being able to destroy Captain America. Norman would have no part in it their inane plans of revenge. It did nothing to further his research.
Sam exchanged looks with the Social Worker and then said, “Well…okay then…”
He remembered the last time he fought Schmidt like this, kneeling beside Natasha for what he thought was the last time. He’d been able to defy him by mumbling one extra word but now he had to stop his entire body from moving.
Steve didn't and chuckled as Howard left the room. Smirking, he turned back to Tony and asked, “This must be extremely bizarre to you.”
He finally noticed that everyone around them were frozen and still as statues. The Goblin was being overwhelmed with SHIELD agents and Peter was on the ground not too far from where they stood with Wade at his side. He was holding up a hand before him, his fingers opaque like Tony’s had been.
“Yes,” Tony replied. Tony paused then slowly reached out and grasped his hand. Steve inhaled sharply but did not jump away, he was getting used to Tony’s intimate touch. Tony said, “I should have made a call –
Steve chuckled and said, “We have more food than fridges!”
“Don’t worry, we won’t stay too long. We just want to ask where Mary is,” Steve tried to assure the nervous looking boy.
Tony separated the distance between them and pressed himself flush to Steve. The breath caught in Steve’s throat as he felt the mold of Tony’s body against his. He grasped one of Tony’s elbows to keep him close. Tony smiled wickedly at him and ran his hands up Steve’s chest until he finally reached his tie. He tugged on it, pulling his neck down and closer to Tony’s face.
Bucky met them halfway and, with one look at Tony, he wordlessly went to Tony’s other side and supported him too.
"There's no 'probably' to that," Bucky said rolling his eyes. "I'll pick you up, Steve. I promise. Till the end of the line, right?"
Hahaha happy birthday, Steve! I started the first story with Tony grumbling about "Fucking Hydra" so I thought it'd be poetic to end it similarly! XD
And waited for the day to come that he could stop running and stand with Tony again.
They all piled back into the quinjet and Sam, being a former paramedic, checked Steve over and gave him a cold compress. Bucky sat next to him and fretted like he always did when it came to Steve. Steve demanded the same treatment in turn and Sam looked over Bucky next. He'd received burns similar to Steve from when he had used the infinity stones but his injuries seemed much older than Steve's and were further long in the healing process.
Bucky rolled his eyes and said, “If this was really Part Four then it failed. There was nothing sexy or romantic about it.”
She grasped him and lowered herself down slowly. They moaned together and then slowly started to move and make love.
Wade chuckled nervously and scratched the back of his head. He murmured, “I think I’ll hold onto that one until it becomes canon too.”
“So you’re not together?”
did Steve’s living equate to Hydra’s living?
For a few minutes, Steve had been utterly convinced his son had killed himself.
“…Well, if you insist,” he heard Tony murmur.
Tony picked up a screwdriver with a grin and said, “Awesome, now bring me up those specs from the reconstruction.”
Tony scrambled to the edge and reached out to Steve and Steve reached out for him but he was too slow. Steve’s finger’s caressed the metal of the storage container then it was gone and his grip only met open air.
“I’m going to put Peter to bed,” Tony whispered.
“If it’s a competition then Stepan will win obviously,” Natasha replied, smoothing a hand over her round stomach. Bucky smirked at his wife, his dark eyes twinkling with mirth. Natasha smiled wilily back.
“What are you doing!?” Bucky demanded, “Fix it!!”
His dad jolted upright upon the sound of his cry and all the confusion left his eyes and were replaced by a sad but comforting warmth. He leaned forward and lightly grasped Peter’s hands. He whispered, “It’s alright. There’s nothing to apologize for. You were having a bad dream, weren’t you?”
“What’s wrong? SHIELD. SHIELD is wrong,” Tony said and pushed the hologram of his growing list to Coulson.
test something like that on yourself!”
Peter was napping on Bucky’s chest and Bucky was laid out across the couch, seemingly napping himself. The Winter Soldier opened one eye as soon as Tony entered the room and glared at Tony, as if daring him to wake the small child.
He looked like he was falling back asleep so Wade nudged him and murmured, “Don't go back to sleep, baby boy. Weren't we supposed to meet your parents for breakfast.”
“He is her Godson,” Bruce added. “He’s the closest thing she has to family.”
“You two fell in love by just watching each other,” Bucky scoffed. “You’re literally a freaking fairy tale romance.”
Natasha shook her head and grimly replied, “None. The Mandarin covers his trail just as well as Tony.”
And Wade…
was the one who wanted to change the future.
“Beloved?” Tony gasped, breathing like he was out of breath.
The electricity ran through him again with this connection but he didn’t even notice it as he put all his strength into pulling Peter free. It was hard, it was probably the hardest thing he’d ever done. Slowly but surely, more of Peter appeared: the rest of his arm, a shoulder, part of his torso, and then, his head and the rest of his upper body. Peter yelled as his upper body was freed and grit his teeth as he pulled himself toward Wade. Terrible moans ripped from Peter as red welts formed on his skin from the electrical burns and smoke began to come off his body as if he was being cooked alive.
“I am ready,” Peter reassured him, running his hands along his chest, his fingers were tracing the dips between his pecs and just above his abs and it was very distracting. Peter continued, “I know I am, it's just…with Venom on, I was all caught up in the moment with all this adrenaline but now…I just don't want to disappoint you. I've never slept with another man before and –.”
Hydra is the reason got us together.”
Steve leapt from the quinjet and started running as soon as his feet touched the ground. He could feel Natasha’s disapproving glare stabbing itself into his back and tried not to think what must be going through his friends’ minds….No, his central focus was Peter. No matter what, he will save his son.
He felt like he was being crushed by the same oppressive force that caught him. He could barely breathe. Tony felt like he took what he thought would be his last breaths being forcibly pushed out of his lungs…
Steve added, “He also takes after you. When you two talk science or machines I can barely keep up.”
“Hey!” Tony retorted indignantly.
“To the roof,” Steve ordered and the elevator began to rise.
Steve tensed and imagined dozens of scenarios of the meeting. In most, he saw Mary yelling horrible accusations at Steve in front of his son and them leaving with Peter never looking at him the same way again.
Pepper hurriedly flicked some more switches and hit some buttons and alarms started to flair. She yelled up, “It’s ready, Tony, get off the roof!”
“Thanks for coming, Peter,” Steve intervened.
“…Sorry,” Tony whispered, dropping his head. He just couldn’t stop thinking about the portal. He half felt like he was still there.
He grasped the neck of the glass in Steve's clasp and his fingers rested right on the edge of Steve's fingers by mistake. He paused in his surprise as his fingertips tingled under Steve’s warmth. The pause extended long past social norms as Tony stared dumbly at their connected fingers.
Tony had been lounging in the main room with his feet propped up on the coffee table and his laptop on his lap. He was still in his swim trunks but had slipped on some jeans and an AC/DC shirt. The suit had soaked into his jeans and made him mildly uncomfortable but he was able to easily ignore it.
With a shocked expression, Peter slowly returned the embrace and he whispered, “…You’re serious.”
“Oh, come on, I’m trying to do the same with mechanical science! Maybe whatever you did will help me with what I’m trying to achieve…”
He painfully groaned and he saw Steve’s head snap over in his direction and his eyes turned a darker blue.
After making love, Wade and Peter fell asleep in each other’s arms. Wade fell into one of the most deepest and content sleeps he had ever taken but, he still woke when he felt Peter slip from his arms.
He continued, “I recently remembered the moment my implant activated. I hadn’t remembered it since yesterday…they took it from me like everything else. Just like they took my name and I know they took
Tony dropped his head in his hands in defeat.
The stress was getting to him. Tony was so frantic with worry and had barely slept or ate. His clothes hung off him loosely and, the last time he saw Pepper with their food supplies, she looked at him like she saw a ghost. Hell, he felt like he was dying.
The judge sat at the table at the forefront of the room. Tony’s lawyers waited for him at the table to the judges left and the prosecution sat at the table to the judge’s right. There were others who worked for the court milling around but Steve’s eyes did not focus on them. His eyes were on the woman who would decide his freedom.
Peter only half listened but put most of his concentration upon chewing.
Bruce turned back to the holo where Brock was watching them with a worried expression. He unmuted it and then asked the younger man, “Would electrocution work?”
Tony had opened his mouth, likely ready to spout a speech on the merits of trusting him, but he sealed his mouth with a smile upon Steve’s question. Steve flushed as Tony grinned wider. He may have asked an unconventional question but the man had an unconventional glow coming out of his heart!
Bruce groaned and Peter giggled as Bruce caught his face as he head drooped.
The Goblin, as everyone was calling him, was among the missing criminals.
"I wished that Clint received the soul stone no matter what. I had planned on using the Mind Stone like Loki had and make Clint believe he saw a dead Natasha..." Bucky sighed heavily and whispered, "I thought I could handle the snap....but I was in so much pain that I couldn't save her...so I had to go back again. But then the Red Skull tried to stop me and well...It took a few tries. But I eventually caught her and Clint was transported clear away with the stone and the Red Skull was too busy dealing with my past self to stop me."
Neither one of his fathers knew what the colors represented to Peter, and he did not plan on telling him anytime in the near future. They probably would have demanded he take the black off. As it was, he had no idea how Pops was going to react to his mask, it took him ages to convince Dad to let him include it in the design.
Or lack thereof…
Steve demanded, “How do I save Peter? How do I separate him and Venom??”
Steve melted into Tony as his heart soared at the sincerity of his words.
If this worked then the next and final step would be to add their DNA. Peter tore his eyes from the dark mixture to look at his friend. When they study the final results, would he notice the minute differences in Peter's DNA? Should he confide in Eddie about his other life? If he kept his secret about being him being in a gay relationship, would he keep Spidey a secret too?
Tony’s heart lodged itself in his throat and he couldn’t respond. That monster was trying to
“Oh my God, that was violent,” Pepper gasped.
“Oh shush, if I get Barnes to go along with this will you help me out?” Tony asked.
Wade stopped swaying and Peter leaned forward to initiate their kissing again.
“Lather up, soldier,” Cap retorted, grinning at Tony in the reflection of the mirror.
lab. Uncle Bruce’s door was across from it and sealed as always.
“The Captain is in a secure location,” he grunted.
, Bruce. No child should have to go through this.”
“No, look at them,” Tony said, nodding in the couple’s direction. Steve followed Tony’s direction and watched as Bucky made Steve’s imposter get to his feet and Natasha grab the man’s other arm. She murmured something in Russian to Bucky and the Winter Solider retorted in Russian with a chuckle. Tony continued, “Whenever they fight together, they’re fine! We should use that to get them together! Let’s send them on a mission that ends somewhere romantic…”
Clint sat up and said, “Jarvis, pause the show.” To them he said, “Bruce! Steve! Hey, what’s up? Who’s the kid?”
“Enough,” Wade retorted. He got to his feet with Peter still in his arms. Peter wrapped his limbs around Wade to make it easier for him to hold him and they began to move. Steve must have returned in the meantime because Peter could hear him whispering directions to Wade as he began to walk out of the gym. Peter buried his face into Wade’s chest and concentrated Wade’s heartbeats, measuring their rate between beats.
The rest of the guests trickled in and Friday announced them like a herald. Those who were used to the AI found it amusing, like Logan or Kitty. His friends from his life as boring old Peter Parker were a
The only thing that could have done this was neutron damage from the reactor wall. The palladium metal of the chip couldn’t handle the strength of his reactor and was breaking down under the pressure. It was leaking into his body, poisoning him.
Tony held up his hands and laughed, “Just making sure!” He crossed his arms over his chest and murmured, “However you do it, if you want positive press, firstly you have to include them to make them feel welcome. If they find out on their own, they’ll pick you apart. You also have to approach it ‘American Dream’ style: how happy you two are, what perfect lives you have mapped out together, white picket fence in the horizon, blah, blah, blah…”
Everything was frozen together in the concave of his shield. He dug it all out and, even with the protection of his thermal gloves, the cold bit into his skin and numbed his fingers painfully.
Hydra had built a Goddamn time machine and Tony stumbled into it none the wiser.
Peter cupped his face with both hands and leaned more into his lap and Wade was happy to oblige the movement.
…Except he was wearing Steve’s Captain America uniform.
“Will that be before or after he blows your head off?” He retorted, drawing an arrow.
“I love our kind of stuff,” Tony murmured as sexily as possible. Which was hard as there was the non-sexy feeling of sand irritating his ass crack. He pulled the super soldier into the water. Waves crashed around them and the tide pushed and pulled at their bodies.
“Did…Did the Avengers want my input again?” Eddie asked, hoping to hear how Venom was fairing.
“Shit, this is probably the most serious conversation I’ve had with you…”
Tony looked at Peter, barely conscious and flopping like a ragdoll. He whispered to his husband, “He’s right in front of me, Steve…I ca – can’t…”
“…Dad? Pops? Why are you here?...And where are your clothes?”
Tony glanced at him from behind his shoulder and whispered, “Coming, beloved?”
Tony paused after getting out of the shower and took a few steps backward to peer into the mirror again. The mirror was still slightly fogged but there was no mistaking the glow from his reactor.
This was no gauntlet like he had assumed.
Thinking of Tony's condition, Steve asked, “Will they find it quickly?”
When Peter finally came, he was flushed bright red, dripping with sweat, and gasping for breath. Wade held him closely, breathing with him and listening to his frantic heartbeat.
“I explained it,” Steve replied. “He didn’t understand what love is so he thought I was taking care you because you were also my son…”
“Yes, he should arrive before liftoff,” the President replied. A secret service agent drew the President aside to tell him something in private so the President did not see Steve scowl.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Steve chuckled, amused by Tony’s strange but caring nature.
“Ready to go, baby boy?” Wade whispered into his ear, freeing him from his sudden revelation.
Thank you to all who have followed, commented, kudoed, and subscribed!
James may have once loved Natalia.
He monitored his father as he and his men put the machine back together and tried to understand its mechanics from the sidelines. Jarvis relayed commentary as he recalled what went where when he saw it through Iron Man’s cameras.
He peered down at the discarded clothing on the floor and became flustered thinking about lifting his gaze any higher. Images of Tony standing under the water ran through his mind: Tony’s hands in his damp hair and water running down his torso, following the contours of his body leading down to—.
The movement woke Wade and he sleepily hummed and readjusted his limbs around Peter into a more comfortable position. He murmured, “Good morning, baby boy.”
Steve turned in the direction of the cafeteria but, as soon as he saw an empty alcove, he leapt into it.
As Gabe slowly pushed the plunger of the syringe into Tony’s arm, Bucky came in next with the tool bag Tony had claimed for his own since joining Panzer's team.
His eyes were watering and his vision was blurred. His gaze remained on the paperwork strewed at his feet and he blinked a few times, planning on meeting Cable’s eyes with a clearer gaze…
The priest looked nervously at the SHIELD agents not to far away and then murmured under his breath, “He told me everything about the time traveling and he’s just trying to be with you again.”
“If you guys don’t mind…I’m going to take a shave,” Steve murmured. “And a five hour shower…”
Tony draped his arm across the small of Steve’s back and lightly placed his hand on his hip. Steve’s jumpy reactions were getting better and the arm holding the spatula merely twitched a tiny fraction. Steve let himself lean into Tony and the perfect fantasy world around him was complete.
Peter smacked a hand over his face just as Steve elbowed Tony and hissed his name with embarrassment.
Venom was boiling in its filthy container and, with its expanding consciousness, it began to understand the meaning of ire.
“Cap here, what’s the mission?”
He whispered to Tony, “You are the love of my life,
He shakily reached out to Natasha. She tensed but did not pull away as he cupped her cheek.
“What? I assume the kid already got the bird and the bees talk? When two guys love each other, they get some lube and –.”
“What, no greeting for me?” Natasha asked as she stepped out from behind Coulson. Peter screamed with excitement and launched himself at his aunt. Natasha caught him with a laugh a spun him around.
“Me too,” Tony sighed. “I’ll be right behind you again.”
“We had flown back to the Tower together because I was worried about Peter,” Steve started, happy to change the topic.
Tony nervously ran his hands through his hair and then ventured out of his room…
The beast slapped him away and hissed, “I am your father –
“Don’t let her go online until you’re done talking to her then,” Peter’s father grumbled right back. He sighed heavily and said, “We need to get more eyes out there, Wade…”
“He learned that from you!” Steve gasped amid his laughter.
Steve took it and tentatively tried a sip. He instantly felt tipsy and he groaned, “Fantastic.”
But Venom was moving so fast.
The reminiscing did nothing to make the ache in his chest go away nor get rid of the acidic taste in his mouth created by his fear for Steve.
The missile hit and another explosion wiped out all sound from his phone speakers and bulbous flames blossomed on the screen again.
After the ceremony, they returned to the tower for lunch. As they ate, Tony made a reference Steve could not understand and it led to the creation of Movie Night at the Avengers, a first for them. Tony decreed that he was done trying to explain pop culture references to Steve and these movies would better acclimate him to this world.
The structure in the center Tony could only have described its function as a grandiose throne. A large red velvet sofa chair sat in the middle of the contraption. It was worn with age but looked like it had been built strong.
Now Tony’s brows furrowed and he shook Steve away. Steve woke with a hiss and wildly looked around him but relaxed as soon as his eyes focused on Tony.
“I am going to check in with my friend and make sure he’s okay!” Tony hissed as his suit molded around him.
“I – I can’t…” Steve began.
They walked a few feet toward the car before Tony finally found his voice and sarcastically stated, “Well, that went better than I expected.”
Tony had been staring off into space, trying and failing at figuring out ways to help Steve. He had already exhausted all his leads years prior when trying to figure out how he and Steve were dreaming together in the first place. No one could figure out how a dead man could keep dreaming with him. It was unheard of. So he did not know who to approach about this…maybe he could inquire with someone on…on what happens in dreams as another soulmate dies.
“You?” Steve scoffed. Hulk might be able to pin Venom but Tony?? Venom was attentively paying attention and, in the back of Steve’s head, he felt the symbiote ready to spring into his mind and take control in an instant.
“Ice cream?” He asked Tony.
He reviewed the footage of that damning day countless times. Venom devoured the robot, spit it out in two pieces, eventually the Captain woke and, for some reason, he gave it tools to fix itself. The robot was quick to fix itself and was even quicker to get out of the tower and out of Norman’s reach.
Natasha quickly called all the people Steve had schedules with and made excuses for the super soldier and promises of rescheduling. She was going to have nothing to do next week and she felt a little cheated.
Peter relaxed into Wade’s hold and agreed, “Yes, let’s go.”
Steve closed his eyes, readying himself for sleep, and contently sighed, “I love you.”
“Language, Cap,” Tony chuffed with a smile. Tony felt like he was going to burst from the joy pooling within him but then Steve began to touch him and his lust burned through all the excess in seconds.
The future couldn't come soon enough.
Tony concluded Steve’s account by stating, “Well you’ve traveled far…and now here we are.” Steve placed the pizza boxes down and Tony continued, “So you don’t want to fight a war you are not a part of which is understandable. The army has been requesting my tech ever since Iron Man first appeared and there’s
Steve narrowed his eyes and asked, “What is this?”
Tony smirked at Steve and his friend mirrored the smile. Inwardly, Tony felt relieved. The awkward silence in the car ride was gone. They could do this.
Venom regarded him with renewed interest. The beast was indeed large…deliciously large. So much mass…so much
He’d barely gotten used to the fact that Steve was alive nonetheless engaged to him...but to see a photo from their wedding...
Before he could thank her, she left.
“I don’t need a babysitter,” Tony retorted.
“Yes, I’m positive,” Bucky stated. "It...It's the closest thing Steve has for a final resting place and I want to go there to say goodbye. No, I need to go there, Tony. I need to be with him one last time, even if it's just his spirit..."
“Baby boy?” Wade whispered with uncertainty.
“Tony, it’s great to have you back and Captain –,” Marston began.
Steve’s brows pinched with concern and Tony pointed to it and said, “That was what I didn’t want to see. Next thing I know, you’ll be going to Howard and giving him parenting advice when he hasn’t even met my mom yet.”
Vision instantly phased himself and Wanda through the wall and, as soon as she was materialized. Wanda worked her magic. Without having to worry about injuring Peter, Wanda flexed her hands and contained the symbiote in a pink ball of magic, crushing and containing the symbiote into a small sphere.
After Phil left, Steve found Tony to show off his new goods.
“No,” Tony interrupted as he glared at the car’s exhaust manifold, refusing to lift his gaze again.
“Pwease,” Peter added and Steve grinned proudly at him.
It was a simple design with three horizontal stripes: with white on top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. For all he knew, they could be the enemy. It was close to Netherland’s flag but the colors were switched around. Did that symbolize something?
“What the hell did you do now?” Tony gasped.
“Don’t do it,” Peter gasped instantly. He must have been conscious of everything and it broke Steve’s heart. In the last week, there were so many things Peter should not have experienced let alone witnessed.
“Operator?” The man asked in bafflement.
“We were together, Steve,” Bucky murmured. “It was her kiss I was comparing yours to. I loved her and I did not get the chance to fall out of love like all the others…like with you…They wiped my mind and froze me before I could even fathom it, not that I wanted to fathom it…We were happy together. I was the Soldier and for the first time as that monster I saw a future that was not covered in blood…I just don’t understand, why she is so upset…I don’t think I did anything wrong…I mean I had no choice whenever I was frozen or my mind was wiped…I don’t understand why she is so angry.” He hesitantly explained at first but the words seemed to come out faster as more came out. He griped his head tightly with his metal hand and hissed, “I wish I can remember everything.”
Steve snorted and took Peter into his arms. Peter smiled up at him, his mouth speckled with a couple of teeth, and Steve smiled warmly back.
The Soldier ignored the lone chair at the table and took his place by her, leaning into her side and the counter. They picked off the same plate, sharing meat and vegetables in silence.
Steve nodded in greeting and Tony forwent the greeting and said, “You guys ready to go?”
The monster circled them until he was behind James. He commanded, “Look at her and tell her the truth. Tell her she was a distraction.”
Tony’s hand squeezed his thigh and he whispered, “I would very much like to get some practicing in. Right now is fine by me.”
But now all of Tony’s enemies would know he has a son. Peter would be the ultimate leverage or tool of revenge.
The three dotted ellipsis appeared on his phone as Steve began to text a near-instant reply, making Tony smile. He wondered if Coulson was on speaker phone as Steve was texting him or if he ended the conversation.
New chapter and new chapter count! The end is nigh!
“One reason. Two words: 2018. Juggernaut.”
Howard turned off the welder and ripped off his mask. His hands began to tremble again as he brought the chip and reactor together. It didn’t click in as easily as it had last time. From the corner of his eye, he saw Steve and Tony clutch each other closer.
The bike rumbled to life and they took off with a jolt as Bucky cranked the gas. They jumped off the sidewalk and from there Steve could only guess where Bucky took him. He kept his eyes shut tightly and concentrated on breathing normally.
They asked him a number of questions about the “supposed” rape and the events that led up to it. They asked for an alibi and, with Jarvis’s help, they were able to prove he in fact had an alibi for the day in question. He had been on a mission for SHIELD, infiltrating a terrorist plane as it was midflight.
The suit, however, was overkill. No one was there. Bucky’s cryostasis chamber had been randomly stuffed between a lot of boxes. Tony was shocked by the empty warehouse. Had Fury’s campaign already thrown Hydra into disarray? Or was Bucky forgotten in the years he’d been stored there?
“Hydra?” She perked up on the mention and stated, “You’ve never mentioned them before.”
Howard backed up and the man moved with him like a predator keeping its prey in its sight.
He bit down on his lip and got to his feet. Who was he kidding? This was his life, filled with pain, regret, and misfortune. His aunt’s words rang true, this was just going to be another hurt he was going to have to endure.
The thick, black mass that was adhered to his arm drew back his emotionless shock.
Jarvis did not impede him in any way nor said anything about his phone call. The AI must have heard it but kept his opinions to himself.
Steve’s head bounced from the shaking but he continued to slumber. Tony dropped his head on Steve’s chest with a groan, “I can’t believe I’m going to do this…” He lifted his head and cupped Steve’s jaw. He stated, “Alright, princess, I’m going to kiss you and, if it wakes you up, I will forever call you Sleeping Beauty.” He paused to see if the threat was enough to stir Steve but the man remained inert so Tony pressed a kiss into his mouth. Steve’s lips were lax but Tony tried several different angles and even licked the bottom of his top lip the way Steve liked. Steve didn’t move and Tony eventually stopped kissing him and pulled back. He hopefully peered at Steve’s face but nothing had changed.
“No,” he whispered and shook his head as a smile played on his lips. He pressed his face into her damp, wavy, red hair and she grasped his hand and threaded her fingers through his.
Steve thanked his friend and ran in the direction of the main offices where he knew Peggy would be either bent over reports or writing missives.
“Prove it, put that hammer down,” Steve said and Tony’s hackles instantly rose.
....and ended up adding 4,000 more words to the story....Sooo I guess the moral of my notes is, when you give me the power to go back and change things I take it WAY out of proportion! XD
But he was
Steve was watching the President walk up the stairs to Air Force One when the Iron Patriot finally arrived. His heart lurched slightly as he looked upon the suit’s familiar design. If it weren’t for the gun mounted on the back and the patriotic paint job, the suit could pass for Iron Man. He may have been upset with Tony for doing this alone but he still missed him and he hated that the last time he saw him was after Steve told him he had willingly kissed Bucky.
Freezing wind hit him and the cold sunk deeper into his skin, making him nauseous. Yet he stepped out into it and wrapped his arms around himself to better ward off the cold.
Peter shook his head and murmured, “There’s got to be a solution, Dad… There’s got to be. Spider-Man needs to be on the streets. I
Steve smiled gratefully to his friend and sprinted down the hall.
“I CAN’T STAND IT!” Mary roared, slamming her fists into the counter. Bruce backed away from her sudden outburst and stared at her with wide eyes. Tony just felt justifiably smug until she continued, “
Peter held his breath as he watched Eddie turn the stopcock and let the near unstable liquid flow into the beaker. Both he and Eddie leaned in closely as they watched the measurements etched onto the burette progress with the emptying of their solution. Eddie turned the stopcock, slowing the flow as it approached their number.
Logan took another drag from the cigar and continued, “Disasters…like humans, also have similar smells. I have smelt famine many times and it away has the same acidic scent. I’ve never encountered anything like your new suit before, but, it smells like famine.”
Pepper pulled him into her embrace and whispered, “Oh, Tony…”
Steve stepped forward and grabbed the New York Times off the first rack.
Tony sat at the counter and began to dig into the food. He explained, “Bruce wouldn’t come if I didn’t have a way to stop him if he Hulked out. So I created the Hulkbuster.”
Jarvis was fully operational again by the time Pepper got there. Tony had worked himself into a frothy rage as he anticipated what he was going to do SHIELD once he was free.
The fact that Peter did not heal like him was at the forefront of his mind and adding to the kindling of his growing hysteria.
For half a second, Steve was 100% certain this was it. This was the moment they were going to die and wipe out their future to reflect the blankness of the photo.
“Oh…” Peter turned to him with a flush and awkwardly grasped his shoulder. The
“She's also badass,” Wade points out.
“How did you know?” Steve asked.
They even shared their first “real” kiss today too.
He was
Clint strolled in, pulling his arrows off his back, and said, “Even with all the stupid things I have done, I have never managed to get on SHIELD’s shit list so kudos to all of you.”
But Wade had a resolution and he meant to keep it.
“I am going to make some lunch,” Ben whispered lightly.
Beta Jarvis?? Why would Beta Jarvis be on?! It was only supposed to activate if he lost connection to the main program! Could his communications be damaged?
“And…well…you saw what happened… I'm being held with this guy, Yensen, he says it would be impossible for someone to find us. We're underground, in a series of caves…I have to find another way out…”
Tony stalked to the back of the plane and gave them no warning as he punched the release and opened the back door.
Without breaking his gaze from the cylinder, he whispered, “What is that?”
He dug his fingers in Tony’s shirt and moaned, “No, no, no, no, no!! Sweetheart, stay with me!!”
“Kilian?” Steve questioned and the leader smirked in confirmation. Steve growled, “Why are you doing this, Kilian?”
Tony frowned and replied, “Yes,
Steve snorted and wordlessly pulled Tony to the car. Happy opened the door for them and Steve murmured, “I need to watch some of these romantic comedies, the clichés you are listing off are getting ridiculous.”
“It’s a highchair with a few safety mechanisms added in for good measure
Peter perked upon the mentioning of the sugary substance and Steve shot Bruce a grateful smile. Peter absolutely loved ice cream. One of the SHIELD agents gave it to him and ever since he had been hooked.
Iron Man stared blankly at him as J chose not to reply.
liked it when he was “cliché”. It had become a strange kink of his. But that was what their lives had turned into and Steve wouldn’t change it for the world.
Tony immediately felt sick at the thought.
He knew Bucky was going to die and…he did nothing.
“What will we do about Peter?” Tony asked the question that was at the forefront of Steve’s thoughts.
Peter’s eyes broke away from the screen and he leaned back into Steve and said, “Anima Crackas.”
“Tony?”
Coulson nodded and said, “The President’s detail will be here in an hour to pick you up. The Parkers will be notified to come then to pick up Peter. You have until then.”
Closer, Tony could see Steve’s entire body was tense and his hands were strangling the blanket with a white knuckle grip.
And then it opened its mouth and Tony’s stomach dropped as he figuratively fell off the edge of that cliff.
Tony repeated with a gasp, "Situation?"
He opened his mouth to explain but stopped himself. He almost told Tony how stupid Steve was being. By stating this, this would have led to Steve having to explain that Steve had always yearned for this moment so the bashfulness was just ridiculous. But he couldn't tell Tony. He couldn't let him know his secret.
is where he belonged. Here with Wade and in his arms.
She gasped and grabbed at his hands, digging her nails into his flesh and breaking them on the metal. Her light green eyes were huge and wet from tears. She looked at him in shock like she could not believe he was doing this.
“That was a really stupid move, kid,” Uncle Clint said with a frown and Peter flinched. Even Uncle Clint was upset. That was bad.
And he knew he was going to have to use that function or New York was going to be destroyed.
? Give me more info, Parker!”
“I need to test some things with the symbiote remains on you,” Bruce murmured and motioned for him to sit at the examination table again.
Steve slowly drew his hand up then, with a bewildered expression, touched his lips.
When the doors opened, he shot out and called out, “Bruce!”
All the while, Steve whispered, “I love you, Tony – I love you –
Wade grinned as his heart was instantly overfilled and flooded his entire body with sappy, hopeless love. Wade turned his head and cupped Peter’s cheek as he kissed him. Water ran down their faces and along their closed eyelids and into their open mouths. Peter turned around in his arms and pressed his chest into Wade’s as they tightened their arms around each other.
Tony wordlessly held out the phone to Bucky. Bucky smirked and held up the phone to his ear and said, “Heya, Dum Bum. How you doin’?”
“If you ask SHIELD for protection, they will give it, no questions asked. You are one of their founding members and if you don’t feel safe then they will help you in that aspect at least. They can’t argue away your safety!”
Steve took a step toward the Winter Solider and hissed, “That is Bucky! I know my best friend!” To the Solider, Steve said, “Bucky? It’s me, do you remember me?”
“Wha-?”
Their reunion had been tragically short and their separation had been an undeniable horror.
“Steve and I are coming from two very different situations,” Peter countered. “His identity as Captain America was never really much of a secret.”
“Crystal,” Jarvis stated, albeit somewhat miffed.
Dr. Banner pinched the bridge of his nose and stated, “By my calculations…” Banner bit down on the end of his pen as his eyes scanned over the scribblings on the notebook in front of him. “With his metabolism and prior history, I’d say he’ll be out another hour, at most, two…”
. And just because you were too
Additionally, Steve and Tony are going to grow closer and eventually live up to their Super Husbands tag (hint hint hint!!)!
It wasn’t strong, but it was there. Tony sighed in relief. He didn’t need another brave man’s death on his conscious.
Clint pumped his fist and exclaimed, “YES!”
“I was hanging out with Uncle Tony. Did you miss me?” Steve answered Peter’s question fondly.
Steve muffled another chuckle and happily wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulder. His husband leaned into his chest with a happy sigh.
When the priority alarm went off, Tony moaned with relief. He stood, dropped the materials he was working with, and jumped over to his suit.
, Steve. We’re going to raise him…what if I fuck it up like my dad had with me? What if I’m trying to help him and he hates me for it too?”
Steve smiled gratefully at him and whispered with total sincerity, “Thank you.”
Everything looked different and more advanced and…
The robot chuckled and Steve flushed, feeling like he said something stupid. Iron Man affirmed, “It is
Steve froze and, for a brief moment, he relaxed and held Tony close and tenderly grasped Tony’s arm. This was nothing like the brush of lips from their first kiss. Tony's mouth was hot, wet, pressed hard against Steve's, and he sucked lightly at his lips. Tony's mouth made Steve's toes curl in a way that Peggy's kisses never did.
The only people who had known Steve was his soulmate were his parents and Jarvis (the butler and AI) and neither parent believed him and, as it was, they were all dead. Everyone just assumed Tony never had a soulmate and no one usually asked about it because they didn’t want to hurt his feelings…
Steve deflated but kept on a pleasant expression as he listened to his soulmate describe his love life.
Tony rubbed his mouth to muffle a
Ohhhh, he was annoyed.
“We are not analyzing the motives of Natasha Romanov at three in the morning!” Tony groaned, falling back onto his pillow with a light thump.
“…He…He feels the same, Buck,” Steve stated. “We were pretty frank with each other last night and I thought it was over but he approached me this morning wanting…more…”
Tony paused when he saw Steve. It was almost like a normal morning. Steve was cooking at the stove like always.
Sam blinked a few times then stepped back and said, “Yeah, yeah, come in!” As soon as all of them were in, Sam looked around outside and then closed the door.
“What level would you like to go to, sir?” Friday enquired. Peter glanced up at the camera in the corner and then back down to his hands.
even more from it! In fact, I think I’ll feel safest in the Hulk Room so tell him, if he wants, he can find me there…”
Peter stepped out of the bathroom in a clean pair of boxer briefs and was rubbing at his head with his towel. Wade leaned back into the bed and wolf whistled as soon as he came into the room. Peter smirked and strolled over to Wade as he asked, “Do you think this will become a thing? Like once a year a super villain has to kidnap Peter Parker or they’ll be kicked out of villain club?”
Natasha was just about to make her escape when the Soldier did the impossible: he knelt down to one knee, a vulnerable position, and grasped her hand. With one powerful tug, he pulled her over the edge and she scrambled to her feet. The Soldier remained kneeling where he was but watched her with a critical eye over his shoulder.
Steve knew Tony used to sleep around with both men and women but in the last two years he had
sneaking around without revealing himself was with the knowledge that the was the only remaining super soldier and thereby the strongest man on the planet.
“Hello, Dr. Banner,” the young woman said and eyed Steve and Peter curiously. She probably assumed they were guests of Bruce so did not ask him to check in with her. Steve was still wearing his disguise so she did not seem to recognize him.
He could not stop kissing him. Steve tasted of dirt and dust but he was warm, he was there, he was not a dream, and he was
Howard buzzed in his assistant and ordered them refreshments and they spent the rest of the afternoon reminiscing and talking about their present lives. It had been nice to speak with Peggy again. Not many women were comfortable with Howard’s brash ways and she was one of the few that could handle him.
He recognized the large tunnel he lay in as being a part of the sewers Venom had dragged them through as they hunted. Overhead, a sewer grate cast light down on him and he could hear the hustle and bustle of a normal city day going on.
“Something wrong?” Steve teased, loving the way Tony was studying him.
“So not covered in his own blood like he was yesterday?” Peter asked sarcastically.
All he wanted to do was pull Tony back into his arms but it was just…
It turned its demonic gaze on Peter and hissed with anger, “Separation means death.
“How so?” Thor asked Bruce in confusion.
“…It’s not your fault,” Tony whispered.
“Shall we make it…dirtier?” Tony asked, grasping Steve’s belt.
Bucky went flying across the room and landed in a crouch, catching himself with his metal fingers digging into the mat. His stare was cold as he said, “Stop fighting. You can’t stop it. These memories are worthless. They are getting in the way of the mission. You must never let anything get in the way of the mission.”
“SHIELD will help him now. You’ve done enough.”
There was nothing he could do for Steve now, but he could get the tesseract and save Tony’s life in the least.
They climbed in the small space. It was made more for kids and teens and not two grown men, but, they managed.
“Got a few cases like yours here. Plus combat vets, people with disabilities who had to choose between owning a home or gettin’ medication…It’s tough out here.” Solo clasped his shoulder and promised, “I’ll help you out and you can help me with the aliens.”
good.
It was arguably the longest day of Tony’s life.
“We’ve been together for three years!” Steve gasped. “How many times have you done this behind my back?!”
“That’s enough, Tony,” he gasped and Steve tore his hands out of his grasp. Tony looked up at him with wide eyes and Steve realized how out of character he acted. Tony was helping him but Steve was acting as if he was doing the exact opposite. He added, “Thank you but I have to go check on my son….Sorry…Thank you… Sorry.”
“Steve needs time to adjust to our world before we throw him into it and ask him to defend it,” Tony stated the words Steve had been struggling to say. “He’s gone through things no one else has
. He thought instantly. If Tony was kindhearted to him he knew he would break. He did not want that to happen. It would be so humiliating. He had just met Tony Stark, he was practically a stranger to him.
“Ass-guard?” Tony repeated with a smirk. He rubbed his mouth, barely muffling his chuckle. The hologram before him was playing the same ten second clip repeatedly of the fight between a robot and a giant blond man with an overly large hammer. Very little information was being let out and the little New Mexico town where the fight occurred was shut down. But SHIELD databases contained a plethora of information which Tony was eagerly digging through.
Death.
“Sweet name,” his dad stated.
They needed to talk this out again. Steve had pretty much told Tony he was up for anything when they had practiced and Tony seemingly took that to heart. He needed to lay down some ground rules on how they were going to act before they totally destroyed their friendship.
Steve jolted to a stop and Tony grinned widely as he met Steve’s shocked gaze. Tony’s gaze fell to take in Steve's body and his eyes became more heated. Steve’s flush deepened. He chose wisely with the bathrobe.
Hundreds of miles away, Steve Rogers experienced the moment very differently. A shock burned through him reminiscent to the same burn of the vita-rays that created his superior strength. He woke up gasping for air and felt cold, so c-cold…
The Iron Patriot nodded and silently walked up the stairs, sliding past the President into the airplane. The President waved one last time to the white house photographers before following Rhodes back into the plane.
She raised her hand to her communicator and gasped, “Stark, we need you here now. I am the only able body and Schmidt has his strings back on James. He’s going to break at any moment.”
Tony stared starkly at it then anger surged within him at the injustice and he punched the metal lid with all of his strength. He hissed, “You
Tony grunted in acknowledgement but most of his concentration was in breathing…well, breathing and contemplating Steve’s fate that is…
“Hey,” Steve softly intoned, grasped one of his hands. He chuckled, “Good morning to you! Is this how you normally wake? I thought you were a grouch and not about to jump out of the bed!”
Tony knew that Bucky had been his first love. He had asked Steve if would leave Tony, if Bucky had come back proclaiming his love. But Steve had promised Tony that would ever happen.
“The future has already fucking changed, J!” Tony exclaimed with a hysterical edge to his voice. “Play the rest of the conversation! I want to hear it in its entirety!”
Fuck, he was horny. He hadn’t slept with anyone since Steve and it’d been so long since they made love. Just touching his naked chest made him so hard.
“They can’t arrest Bucky!” Steve hissed.
Under the influence of alcohol, he had been easy to trust the robot but now he is in the
Their arm pinches they shared started to feel as intimate as their kisses. Steve felt a light flush creep into his cheeks again and he whispered, “Yeah, I’ll – I’ll see you later…”
Her eyes flickered down to where he was touching his implant and she murmured, “James will never respond to Clint. He has no connection to him.”
“J! System’s check!” Tony demanded, gasping for air and hunching forward. He clutched his chest instead as the pain began to fade.
“You waiting for an invitation?” Tony murmured, his eyes hooded and dark.
Natasha was the one who trained him in SHIELD and knew
His instincts screamed with the need to claim her. To press his lips into hers and finally end their dancing around it. She was his soulmate and he wanted her body and soul.
Steve learned all he could about Tony’s body in the period when they couldn’t get their hands off of each other. He knew where to touch him just right to make him moan in ecstasy or tease him just enough to make in groan from sexual frustration. He realized kissing him along the ribs made his toes curl and he became more turned on by Steve’s strength when he pushed him into the bed.
Until one day, they were on the way to meet up with some of Solo’s friends when something caught Steve’s eye. They were walking through the city, crossing the tourist zone to get to their less reputable area, when Steve saw the name “Stark.”
Tony guided Steve to the couch and he sat down heavily. Steve adjusted Peter so he would be sitting in his lap and kept his arms wrapped around his son. Peter was silent and watching him with a keen eye. Steve could feel the worry coming of his son in waves.
“The Chameleon was a distraction,” Bucky hissed. Natasha nodded in agreement. Tony did not seem to hear them as he was busily typing away on three different holograms hovering in front of him. A look of total concentration was splayed across his face and his mouth seemed to be set in a permeant frown. The virus shook him. He thought no one could outsmart him or his machines and now he was trying to add more armor to a system he thought virtually imperishable.
Steve rounded the corner and saw the Winter Solider already climbing up the side of the building. Desperate, Steve yelled out the one thing that got across to him prior, “Don’t go! It’s-It’s you and me till the end of the line, remember!?”
He staggered to his feet and saw the same dark clothed agents in the room as last time.
of your undies!!”
Relief and joy splayed across Steve’s features as he cupped Tony’s face and, in a broken voice, repeated, “You’re fine?”
The man was perfect in all ways but one: he was not really with Tony.
Steve looked nervously from his son to Bruce. Tony asked for him, “So Bruce, what does this mean for Peter? Is he going to be alright?”
Tony turned around with two mugs and handed one to Steve. Steve accepted it and sipped at the dark brew with a happy sigh. Tony leaned against the counter beside Natasha and asked, “Where did you two go for the bear?”
Pepper texted Steve and Tony in a group message and told them to be downstairs in five minutes and to be ready to face the press.
“Natasha,” Steve whispered. She turned to Steve, her eyes glassy and her jaw clenched in rage. “This is what he wants. Don’t give into him. Let’s lock him somewhere where no one can hear him and live out the rest of our lives.”
“Then let’s do it!”
All his doubts disappeared as she pressed her lips against his. Her arms wrapped around his head and pulled him in deeper. He responded by curling his hand into her hair at the back of her head and drawing his other arm around her back to press her closer to him.
And they were finally safe.
“-ptain America?”
The endgame was to expand those cracks until they crumpled the entire infrastructure…
“It is,” Steve agreed with a heavy sigh. “Let’s take care of SHIELD and then we can all sit down and talk about this.” Steve motioned to the beard. He was ready to tell the story and move on from it. He was also ready for a shave and a haircut. He had resolved to get rid of the beard once he saved Tony and he’d accomplished it.
“Died?” Harry exclaimed in confusion.
The closer he got to the explosion, the more crowded the halls became. People were screaming and fire alarms were blaring, making it hard to hear anything. He knew he was close when he smelt the smoke and he quickened his pace.
“Does Tony have anything panned for tomorrow?” Steve asked the AI.
Pops and Uncle Tony exchange another set of glances this time they were more secretive.
The corners of Wade’s lips upturned in a cock-obstructed smile and he happily hummed, making Peter's toes curl as the feeling reverberated through his dick.
Steve seemed to have spotted him at the same time and face contorted with emotion and a wobbling smile spread across his face. Steve was still outside but he quickly opened the glass doors to the balcony and rushed forward, wetly gasping, “
Steve leaned heavily into the wall to help support his weight as he kneeled down to kiss him. Tony’s hands dug into Steve’s neck and he pressed himself into his soulmate, wanting to physically show Steve how much he
Yet as soon as he reached the doorway Steve had been standing in moments before, he ran into Natasha.
Bucky’s eyes became glassy as his gaze turned inward and he said, “Just yesterday, I remember shooting a man in front of his daughter then I waited for the mother to come home and shot her as well. I left the little girl there, alive and sitting in her parents’ blood.” Bucky paused as pain flashed through his eyes and he whispered, “Sometimes I slip back into him. I become the Soldier and lose all my emotions...I lose my soul. It can happen without warning, like today… I-I did not mean to hurt you.”
“I’ll call it Mt. Rogers. No wait, it got both of your ass cheeks, how about, the Rogers Mountains?”
The lab used to feel like a sanctuary to him but, when the eyes of the other interns and the supervisors fell on him, the lab felt the furthest thing from the safe, relaxing place it used to be.
"...What?"
“Please do not repeat that or Uncle Clint might actually start doing that,” Peter begged.
“James, he is fine,” his aunt stated.
Bruce was near salivating as he stared at the medical files pertaining to Steven G. Rogers pre- and after-serum. He gasped, “Y-Yes, please, do it!”
– Tony gasped, “St-Steve Rogers?”
Rogers slouched and he shifted his cup on the table but did not pick it up. He whispered, “I understand.”
Tony carded his fingers with Steve’s and said, “C’mon, we got to take a selfie at the end of Route 66 sign, walk to the end of the pier, maybe go on the ferris wheel…the day is still young!”
Steve sighed heavily and rested his head on top of Tony’s. He was quiet and Tony listened to Steve’s gentle breathing as he waited for him to speak. Steve finally whispered, “If…If this does not go according to plan…y-you—you don’t have to…”
“Alright, get back to the pool, you two,” Tony said and the boys did not need another word of encouragement. Their somber expressions vanished as they leapt into the water and soaked their cousins and the rest of the Avengers. Poor Bruce and Betty had been sitting with only their feet in the pool because they did not want to get wet but were now thoroughly soaked.
Peter snorted and finally pushed back to look up at Wade and ask, “And why on Earth would I want to do that?”
“Fine-!” Tony wheezed, between the jarring coughs, “Went down wrong pipe!”
Everyone always ate together and seemed to only store snacks in their personal kitchens, which Steve was happy to replicate. Breakfast and dinner were team affairs and they all gathered in the large dining room on the community room floor to eat the takeout Tony or Clint ordered, or the food Bruce or Steve made. Steve had helped his mother cook so he made wholesome meals that Tony called “All-American.” Bruce made more exotic foods he had learned from his travels and every dish was something delightfully new to Steve always with a touch of spice.
Peter led him over to the section where the interns had reserved seating, conveniently near the stage. Most of the others were there already, Eddie included, and his friend did a double take when Peter and Wade came up. Eddie stared at Wade’s skin openly and Wade went quiet, obviously noticing the scrutiny. Peter frowned, already missing hearing Wade’s happy prattling.
Steve rolled his eyes again but slumped into Tony’s side and wrapped his arms around him. His weight on Tony’s back was a comfort and he relaxed into his husband’s arms with a light sigh.
“I am not going to produce Dr. Parker just because
And then he’d always add, “Do the math, Tony. Two heads have twice as much teeth.”
“We are so gross,” Tony groaned, walking stiffly toward the bathroom.
“Yes, he is alive. Look at the photo. It should have stopped fading because the future isn’t set here. Our presence should already be altering the future the Goblin created,” Cable replied. Steve pulled out the photo and saw Cable was right. The fading had stopped. Half of Tony’s body was gone but his upper half was still there and it was no longer fading.
“I’m not ready,” Tony hoarsely stated in a desolate voice.
But because of Tony’s crazy idea to protect him with a “fake” relationship, Steve had never before been so true to himself than ever before now.
He was running his finger over it as Clint let Barnes out.
“Tony?” He called out.
“I think I will stay clean shaven,” Peter replied with a slight edge. Now that it was out that he was Tony’s son, did people expect him to drop everything and be just like him?
They almost had to declare bankruptcy. Norman had to call in favors to save his company and fortune. And to top it all off, SHIELD kept Stark Industries
Steve uneasily adjusted his hold on the reactor and waited for the other to come back.
Wade kissed the back of Peter’s neck as he returned his hands to massaging Peter's shoulders and murmured, “Then call me the Jello Master.”
. I know you’re strong but I am
Bet you weren't expecting that! ;D
“What are you doing?” Tony asked him with a grin and a laugh on his voice. Steve leaned in toward Tony as he cracked open his hazel eyes.
Steve smiled self-consciously. It looks like they did not recognize him just like he had wanted. Even though they seemed to be allies Steve did not want to reveal anything just yet. He had no idea what these people were doing out in the arctic and they flew a flag that did not belong to the Soviet Union. For all he knew, he had stumbled into the Soviet division of Hydra.
“It is what the files said, Peter. They said she was dead so we believed them,” Steve whispered and he strode back to Tony’s side. Harry stood awkwardly where Steve left him until Steve motioned him to follow him.
“Help him,” the Soldier whispered. He was looking down at Steve with eyes glassy with a flurry of emotions.
Eddie nodded. He knew he’d never live a normal life with Venom but he was not willing to go back to his pitiful life as boring, weak Eddie Brock.
Schmidt threw back his head and laughed.
“May texted me,” Steve replied.
“No, not again, baby boy,” Wade begged, his grip on Peter now painful. “I can’t lose you again.”
{No...He loves you, Wade and you him. You never knew the true meaning of happiness until you met our baby boy} the other assured him. {This isn't a bad thing. Even the Merc with a Mouth can find happiness, love, and other poetic crap synonyms that express how perfect you two are for each other.}
much worse.
He pulled back but as their eyes met, Steve and Tony automatically pulled together again and kissed. It was the first time they shared a real, honest-to-God kiss between each other without the shadow of it being fake in the background. They held each other like their lives depended on it and pressed into each other so tightly they could barely breathe.
Pops…
It was all too much, the combined knowledge and seeing Tony like this in person. With only a second’s warning, his eyes overfilled, and he inhaled sharply as his chest seemingly collapsed from the immense grief. He put his hand over his mouth as if to smoother any more sounds, but it’d do little good, Tony had seen it all.
Smiling widely and without a hint of nervousness, Steve strode out onto the stage. The audience cheered again when Steve appeared.
Peter rolled his eyes and said, “Indeed…”
He gasped, “I wish I could be talking to you right now and not a hunk of stone that looks like you…"
Peter pushed Wade off him and scrambled up onto the seat in front of Wade, gasping, “
“Babe…” Peter sighed.
“He’s on our list, Stark,” Fury countered. “You’re on federal land. Hell, you’re within walking distance of the goddamn Capital Building! This place is crawling with cameras and agents!
“I get the pick of the priority missions for the next month,” she retorted.
The Iron Patriot stood off to the side, out of the way, and silently watched as people busily prepared the plane. Steve glanced at him, wanting to talk, but the President moved deeper into the plane and Steve followed him.
Peter loved his father but he also loved his life. He didn’t want to change it, even if it meant he couldn’t do something as simple as getting an afternoon coffee with his dad.
“Good morning, beloved,” Tony whispered, his voice still scratchy with sleep. Steve opened his eyes and found Tony propped up by his elbow and gazing down at him. Tony continued, “Or rather, I should say, good afternoon.”
“We’re really discussing this in front of me?” Bucky groaned.
“Sir, I have been running their photos through both state and city databases but if neither have been arrested or had a state job then there will most likely be no results.”
She waved to the broken shards on the floor and Bucky automatically obediently knelt and started to pick it up with his bare hand.
“If you’re already kissing him then you sound more than happy with him,” Steve murmured dryly.
Snap out of it!”
“What if…?” Howard began but Tony was already out. The implications of this new discovery changed everything. What if everything that had happened was meant to happen? What if it happened like that in Tony’s timeline too because he was always meant to be here?
“…Sir,” Jarvis interrupted both of them.
He was beginning to fade in and out of lucidity. The first night of his delirium, he weirdly called out  for “pepper” asking where it was. Bucky had brought him some pepper from the kitchens, thinking it might appease him, but it just made him more upset.
They were no closer to finding Steve than they were at the beginning of the week.
It was no question for Steve to agree to move into Tony’s apartments. It was much larger than his old apartment and included three floors and a large private balcony. Peter had taken to the transition with ease and loved being closer to Tony. The most difficult part for Steve was merging their closets. Tony’s closet was as big as Peter’s bedroom but it was filled with enough suits to clothe an entire army.
“Sir?” Jarvis called out from his phone speakers. Tony pulled it out of his pocket and Jarvis stated, “Both instances created shockwaves, invisible to the human eye, and with abnormal power signatures. I noted both occurrences in the logs though, at the time, I thought them no more than the usual seismic events of the planet.”
Tony nodded but was frowning.
Even with none of them guessing the right time, Tony decided to award the win to the absentee Bruce (who obviously could not handle big crowds or reporters) and the rest of them agreed.
Peter’s heart felt like it was going to stop when Eddie sealed the burette. They both leaned down to look at the reaction in the beaker.
The Soldier hushed her by touching the tips of his fingers to her lips and they both froze.
Steve chuckled as he pushed himself up too. With his eyes sparkling, he repeated, “
Tony looked far from relieved by this news, in fact, he appeared downright upset. He closed his eyes and, with a pained whisper, stated with an eerie certainty, “No, he’s going to die…”
She gave him a tour of the Tower and finished with her own floor. She explained it would be his as well and…he couldn’t explain the emotion that rose up with this information…
Peter stared at the reflective surface, remembering a couple years ago, being on the other side of those doors and nervously staring at his warped reflection. Back then, all he’d been worried about was being able to create a relationship with his father…
All he had to do was deal with what to do with Venom…
Wade chuckled and wound his arms around Peter.
Stony!”
Dum Dum, Gab, and Monty were the only survivors. They were old men now but approached Steve and Bucky like a day hadn’t passed since they last parted.
Steve turned around and saw Bucky slip into the room with a silent tread. The only clue Natasha gave to noticing him there was her eyes briefly flickering in his direction. She did not turn her head or shift her body in any way nor did she stop coaching Peter. Peter himself was concentrating so hard on his lesson that he had yet to notice his uncle.
“To your left, Pete,” Steve sighed and Peter found the hallway with the direction.
The command made James stiffen and, with wide, fearful eyes, he lowered his weapon.
Natasha was making a salad in the kitchen and she nodded to Steve in form of greeting.
Logan took another drag from his cigar and retorted, “Yeah, I noticed that.”
Steve smiled warmly at his friend and stepped over to him to embrace him. He whispered, “I’m fine, Buck. I’m home now.” He slipped out of the hug and continued, “And now my fella’s going to give me a good shave. What more could I ask for?”
His tech guys suddenly bust into the room and he murmured to May, “I have to go.” He hung up and asked the tech agents, “What do you have?”
Tony, the only person in the room having known Mary Parker in real life, gasped, “Holy crap, that’s her.”
“You don’t remember?? Is there
They hadn’t left each other’s sides since but they were also never alone again.
Tony smiled sadly at him and forewent answering his question by whispering, “You should be sleeping in a bed.”
“It’s a burner phone. SHIELD doesn’t know about it so Hydra doesn’t know about it. Only two know the number. Clint is one and the other just called me.” Natasha held out the phone to Steve and said, “He’s on the line right now and you need to talk to him.”
And I already have the chapter title picked out...it’ll be: Nightmares
"...You two are the only ones who know what I'm going to do," Bucky explained.
Tonight, Wade thought the best-case scenario would have been having a terse dinner with the folks. He never imagined….
“…Eddie?”
“Yes, and all you need to do is look presentable,” Pepper retorted.
thought he would use that term in context to his significant other and nonetheless Tony.
Steve gently removed the Iron Man gauntlet from Tony’s undamaged left hand, his mind easily made up on what he needed to do because…because Tony was dying.
“I only want to know,” Bucky whispered to her. “I
Peter automatically curled into Tony’s side and buried his face into his torso. It made Bruce’s heart ache. Peter was usually so talkative and happy, he saw no signs of that right now.
“James,” he repeated, the name rolling off his tongue with ease.
On the screen, past Steve disappeared. Tony turned his head and pressed his face against Steve’s.
Wade lightly kissed those smiling lips and then traced his fingers along his face. There were dark circles under Peter’s eyes. Wade traced them and retraced them and then observed, “Did you not sleep well, baby boy?”
Steve clenched his fists and glanced apologetically to Tony. Tony was still too shocked and scared to respond. Steve looked back to Peggy and explained, “Iron Man may be able to help Tony with his chest…they both have similar devices.”
“Hey, Cap, thanks for keeping Tony some company,” Howard said, stepping beside Steve where he had sat himself on the edge of the cot.
Bucky had not looked away from Natasha and her weapon since they entered the room. His expression was oddly speculative and he whispered, “I…know you.”
“Tony was the one who saved me from Hydra and he took me in,” Bucky replied with a shrug.
Tony could not stop the initial onslaught. The story was going to be published no matter how many connections he pulled and how much money he bribed with. The story was out and, despite it being the middle of the night, it was already all over social media, spreading like wild fire. If the news outlets did not run with the story, whispers of a cover-up would tarnish Steve’s reputation further. So Tony had to grit his teeth and let it happen.
“Whose baby did you two steal?”
In that year, Steve and Tony lived like any other couple, they laughed, they fought, they cried, they loved…in other words, they lived and grew closer.
And that was all that mattered to Steve: Tony’s happiness.
Tony paled and squawked, “What!?”
“I near about had a heart attack when I saw them jab you with that baton,” Tony gasped as he pulled out of Steve’s hold. He wildly searched his body for any other injury.
