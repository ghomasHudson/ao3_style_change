but you can’t— You don’t know how to sit in a room with him, so close, you can count the creases by his eyes, you can smell his
The sound settles low in Steve’s pelvis, adding to the tension building there. He nudges his hips forward again and it feels… Not pleasurable, exactly, or at least not yet, but
“I would if I could,” Iron Man says again, and for a moment the wistfulness in his voice sharpens into something almost like yearning. It vanishes, gone as if it had never been, as he continues. “You go ahead and have your fun without me, okay? Pull out all the stops; really give me something to regret, and serve me right, for leaving you in the lurch.”
Wasp shakes her head. “What happened? One minute we were fighting and the next you were just standing there, staring up. It was like you were hypnotized or something.”
“You could do it again. If you wanted. Both hands, you could— Jesus.” Steve feels a shock of cold metal as Iron Man rests his head against his thigh. “I think I’m catching religion here.”
“So,” Iron Man says, still slowly, as if trying the words out, “you’re saying that the reason you’ve been so distracted lately is that you’re… in heat.”
You could fix that. Insert a script into your brain, corrupt the code, let the perfect, hideous machine of your body fritz and error and bluescreen itself into the ground. You could—
“You won’t be getting it tonight,” Tony informs him. “But, on the other hand…” He withdraws his foot, face pulling into an exaggerated grimace. “No one could reasonably expect me to stick my cock in
Steve slammed the wardrobe shut with a violence that would have sent any normal door off its hinges.
Steve lets Iron Man lead him into the bathroom. He lets him hand him a washcloth and untie the knot on the bandage around his head.
Except if it was you—if, in that knife’s edge of a moment you were the one to lean in, to close the distance, to bridge the gap between thought and deed, well. That sets you pretty firmly on the road to damnation, but it’s not like you weren’t there already, and at least it means you chose this. At least it means you were in control.
Iron Man’s absence admittedly puts a spoke in those pleasant—he stretches again, curling his toes, mmm,
hands are difficult to draw. How had he ever managed before? Still, it’s perfectly fitting for someone of Merlyn’s wizardly dignity to stand with his hands clasped behind his back. It’s not giving up, it’s just…
my world,” he says, and looks away so he doesn’t have to see Rogers’ face close down, to see that sadness—distant, immeasurable—creep into his eyes.
You lift an uncallused hand to your chest and trace over the places your scars used to lie. Steve loved your scars. You remember the night he took you to bed for the first time, the way he traced his tongue over every crater and fault-line in your skin until you wondered if it was possible to die of wanting someone too much.
“Winghead,” Iron Man is saying, “you all right in there?” There’s a pause and a few indistinct noises, and then Iron Man’s voice comes again, “I’ll go, if you want— If you need some, uh. Time to yourself, I just. Need to know you’re all right.”
You’re thinking of those glad-handing suits in Washington with their backchannel negotiations and their hemming and hawing and their
It’s as if the world has spun away under your feet, leaving you floating in empty space. How foolish of you, how woefully naïve to imagine that there could be any such thing as a
Iron Man’s gauntleted hands are strong enough to crush steel—Steve knows, he’s seen it happen—but you’d never guess it from the way he cradles Steve’s head, as if he’s holding something infinitely precious. A metallic thumb brushes over Steve’s cheekbone and then Steve feels the roughness of cotton wrapping around his head, over his closed eyes and the bridge of his nose.
something like this. You feel a sharp tug between your ribs—if you were standing, you think you might have stumbled. It’s your future, pulling at you, dragging you one step closer to war.
He bats the thought aside. It has no place here, troubling the easy warmth of his afterglow. He takes a few deep breaths, and reaches once again for the soap.
Tony leaps to his feet, unable to sit still for a minute longer. He walks to the window, staring blankly at the scattered lights of the city below him. He can feel Rogers’ gaze tracking him as he moves.
Iron Man lets out a startled huff of laughter. “What, just like that? Not a big believer in foreplay, huh?”
Steve’s face blanks, the way it does when he’s struggling with some complex emotion. His hands drop to his lap and he shifts—restless, uneasy—in his chair. “I know things have been— lately, I mean, I know we haven’t—
Steve feels the effects almost immediately. Over the weeks and months, he’s grown used to the feeling of Extremis, both like and unlike the serum in the way it takes him over, sinks into the core of his body and makes it something new. The serum hurt, but that was the pain of growth—of development and blossoming and becoming. Extremis never hurts. Instead, it infiltrates him like a virus: overwrites his cells, erases what it finds and leaves itself in its place.
Steve sighs. Not that it makes the slightest bit of difference. Iron Man’s clearly not interested in explaining… anything, really, and Steve will just have to live with that. Pledged not to pry, and all. He’s made it this far without knowing any details of Iron Man’s private life. There’s no reason that has to change.
Thanks to the wonderful wynnesome for brainstorming help, and to my fabulous alpha, Antrodemus, who requested mOAr feelz. Antro, I hope this satisfies.
Steve chased you down, all the way to a truck stop in the middle of the Rockies, just to ask you not to do this. You asked him not to get in your way.
Because you can tell that he really believes what he’s saying. Really believes that he’s just solved all your problems in one fell swoop. Everything is so fucking simple to him. You think you’ve loved that, at other times, in other places, but here, now, all you can think is that this will be what wrecks you.
He flexes his thigh muscles, then the ones in his calf, and then his toes, down the left side and back up the right. It does nothing to dispel the tension growing in his body. If anything, simply paying attention to that tension makes it all that much harder to bear.
“I have to go,” he says, and then he turns on his heel and runs. He hears someone call out from behind him, but he doesn’t stop, doesn’t even slow his pace, only vaults over the crushed ruins of an abandoned taxi cab and disappears into the city beyond.
“Because what’s a little light arms trafficking on top of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting, harboring a fugitive…”
It’s a reasonable enough explanation. Steve might even have believed it, if it wasn’t for everything that came before.
Steve has allowed his eyelids to droop, but at that, they fly open, lips parting on a gasp. His hands clench, one knotting in the sheet, the other scrabbling against the smooth surface of Iron Man’s armored thigh.
“You like this,” Iron Man says wondrously, finger picking up pace as Steve lets out a low keen of agreement. “You really, really like this. You’ve been holding out on me, Winghead.”
The corner of Rogers’ mouth hitches upwards. “Still. Shouldn’t be an issue for much longer. Carnelia’s been in talks for a while, hasn’t it? And now that they’ve seen the benefits of having a superhero on call…”
He tries to pull back, but Steve follows the motion, attempting to convey, as eloquently as he can with his mouth full of cock, that Iron Man is welcome to come down his throat—that he wants it, even.
“I know,” Iron Man says, as the last few hiccups of laughter subside. He takes Steve’s arm where it’s fallen between them and presses it to his chest for a moment, before lowering it once more to the mattress. “I should go. It’s getting late.”
On his watch. And all his fault. Because he made a call. The right call which was really the wrong call which was the only call to make. Because of Rogers. Because he
You keep going, of course. You’ve done the worst thing already—nothing you do now can take it back again and anyway, you’ve always prided yourself on being a gentleman. Your mind is blank, grey static, a holding pattern, as you lick and suck with passionless efficiency. Ironically enough, that’s what seems to do it for her, far more than all your fumbling attempts at tenderness, and it’s not too long until she’s quivering and swearing and bucking up into your face.
Just focus on the task at hand, that’s the thing. Rogers’ mystery weapon. Not because Rogers wants him to—because it’s all Rogers apparently thinks he’s good for, but because it’s what he’s best at. Because he’s the best at
“It’s not Thor.” Steve forces it out through clenched teeth. His fingers spasm, closing around empty air, and he’s trying
The darkness behind Steve’s closed lids deepens with every pass of the cloth around his head. There’s a desperate kind of unreality to it, the imposed blindness and the blazing need, as if Iron Man’s gentle (too, too gentle) touch is the only thing that still binds him to the world.
Iron Man sighs again. “Then I’ll stay,” he says, adding, as the mattress depresses under his weight once more, “But I want to be the big spoon.”
Steve knew, vaguely, that Iron Man was still wearing his chest plate, but knowing is different from feeling the evidence cold against his skin. Iron Man must have been very careful so far to position himself so that Steve couldn’t feel it. The realization strikes Steve as sad in a way he can’t quite define.
Iron Man pulls away. “Right,” he says, and takes a deep breath, like he’s rallying himself for something. “Let me slip into something a little more, uh… less.” The there’s nothing but the clinks and clinks and rustles of Iron Man undressing.
Tony walks over to the table, yanks out a chair, and collapses into it. A wordless command to the armor retracts the remainder of the helmet.
And he knows it must be right because the tip of Iron Man’s finger dips inside of him. He stifles a gasp, but all Iron Man does is swipe a little lube across the walls, soft and shallow, in and out in a moment.
He isn’t sure quite where the desire comes from, a desire that is not like the desire he’s known, something fierce and hot and dreadful, but a quiet, gentle ache. He wants the intimacy of it, two bodies aligned, pressing closer, the soft tangle of limbs and tongues and lips. The thought occurs to him that if he kisses Iron Man, he’ll be able to taste himself in Iron Man’s mouth, and that thought does send a pulse of heat through him, but that’s not what this is about. He can’t even say, in this limp, floating state of post-coital bliss, that he wants to kiss Tony.
,” Steve growls, which is unworthy, but for god’s sake, how many times is Iron Man going to make him say it before he gives him what he needs?
“Well. Good thing I came prepared, then.” His voice drops. “I’m going to take care of you, Cap. You just relax.”
For a moment, it’s more than he knows what to do with, the urgency and force of that desire. Then the fantasy in his head flips, and now it’s Tony who is
Which you won’t, of course. Even if it is kind of funny, if you think about it. You guess it’s one way of circumventing your destiny. And at least that way, you wouldn’t have to tell Steve…
He doesn’t notice when Iron Man leaves, only knows, after his orgasm has finally burst over him, leaving him spent and shaken and horribly, desperately
It’s easy to forget just how powerful words can be—how, deployed correctly, they can rewrite history itself. Take something intimate and urgent and full of care and turn it ugly, turn it sordid and shallow and small. Iron Man’s words don’t feel like a blow. They feel like something stolen from him. Something precious wrenched right out of his hands. And he wants to be angry about that—can feel the anger kindling in him, bright and searing, except— What has Iron Man actually stolen? A memory? A sense of closeness? You might just as easily say Iron Man has taken himself away, and isn’t that Steve’s own fault, for assuming in the first place that Iron Man was his to hold?
So yeah, no Tony this chapter, sorry. It was gonna be this one, but then Iron Man had to go into slow collapse off camera and skew the plot. Next one, I promise. Which I will hopefully not need a full calendar year and a global pandemic to produce JESUS.
“While you were gone there was… some kind of perfume, I don’t know where from, and I think—what you were saying—”
A sudden desperation rises within you, bubbling up through the fading bliss of orgasm. “Let me?” you ask, and it’s clumsy—too vulnerable, too
Iron Man’s hand is still a heavy weight on Steve’s shoulder, fixing him in place. He gives it a pointed look. Iron Man holds his ground.
, streaked with grease and up to his arms in machinery with a smile on his face that could power the world—
You’re feeling lightheaded—a pointless psychosomatic reaction. Surely you should be beyond that by now.
Steve pushes himself up and swings around to sit on the edge of the bed. Across the room, mid-morning sunlight streams through French windows, warm and golden, like someone’s idea of a joke. He stares down at the phone in his lap, the phone blinking the length of the call back up at him. Seven minutes and forty-three seconds. The numbers look wrong, out of place, as if time is a faulty metric. As if whatever just happened can only be understood according to some other scale entirely. Turbulence, maybe. Seismic magnitude.
“So that’s it, huh? Couldn’t bring yourself to end things, so you found a way to get me to do it for you?”
Iron Man’s fist tightens on Steve’s cock and Steve gives a muffled shout, thrusting upwards into his grip.
A shock of recognition goes through him. Iron Man’s note. He… never really got a chance to look at it, did he? Too eager for answers to properly examine their vehicle. Well. No harm in taking a look now, is there?
Inch by inch, the pain is becoming impossible to ignore. Steve lets himself sink into it, lets himself become nothing more than what he is: a body, distressed. His neck cricks, his jaw aches, his cheeks are sore and pulled. The wooden floor is impossibly hard against his worn-down, old-man’s knees. Every minute is a battle, and at the end, no reward but the increasingly stringent demands of the next.
Once upon a time you awoke in a cave and dreamed you could be better than you were, but to Sal, Iron Man is just a man in a metal suit. Wrestling monsters and punching dragons—a child’s dream of how to build a better world.
He’s always liked that about their friendship, the way all those little personal and biographical details never seemed important or even relevant. Steve has lost so much. He’s the only one of the Avengers without a secret identity, and that’s because, for all intents and purposes, Steve Rogers doesn’t exist in this era. That life was dead and buried over half a century ago.
Tony nearly drops the piece he’s holding. His hand flies to his left arm, rubbing at a phantom ache.
what we’re shooting for. ‘Really’ too, if we can swing it. If you kneel on the bed, I can— Yeah, just like that.”
Steve gets obligingly to his feet, not quite able to resist licking his lips as noisily as possible for the pleasure of hearing the stutter in Iron Man’s breath.
by you, by what you’ve done to yourself, and he might not remember that just now but you sure as hell haven’t forgotten.
He places one heavy hand on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve feels a rush of tension leave him. The other hand curls around the back of Steve’s neck, ruffling the short hairs at his neck. The metal isn’t as cold as Steve would have imagined, but it’s still cool enough to make him suck in an audible breath.
You steel yourself. Tighten your abs, as if that could quell the writhing in your gut. Turn onto your side and wait for your eyes to adjust, for the familiar features to coalesce out of the dark.
“I’ll. Um. Be back in a moment,” Iron Man says again. The bed creaks as he stands. Steve hears his footsteps pad across the floor.
“Yeah,” he says, in response to whatever Iron Man has just asked him. “I mean, no. I mean— Sorry, Shellhead. Got my head in the clouds. Now’s not really a great time to talk. Maybe later?”
From the long, controlled breath that crackles through the voice modulator, it’s clear that Iron Man doesn’t believe him, but all he says is, “Okay. Okay. I’m going now. Just—just call, if you need me. Anything I can do,
“Oh god. I’m sorry. That was such an awkward— Forget I asked. Really. I was just, you know. Concerned.”
He tosses the phone onto the bed and rakes both hands through his hair, steepling his fingers behind his neck, leaning back into their hold.
Honestly, it’s not even cute how many title changes this went through—I’m starting to suspect I might be overthinking things. Like, this is just for porn, right? Right???
Iron Man’s voice is flat, utterly without inflection. He might as easily be the robot Steve had first taken him for, in the submarine all those months before.
He knew it had to be something like that. Something innocuous. Something that was nothing at all. It was just that, for a moment there, he thought…
,” sounding almost lost, which wasn’t right because surely one of them had to know what they were doing here.
Iron Man doesn’t seem to mind much of anything at all, judging by the way he mutters litanies of praise and prayers beneath his breath—doesn’t mind Steve’s inexperience, doesn’t mind his blindfold-induced discoordination.
Steve lurched to his feet, stumbled half-blindly across the room. One hand caught the back of one of the sofas, as the other dug furiously—painfully—into the root of his crotch. He couldn’t— he shouldn’t be— No.
Iron Man slides his hand down to cup Steve’s jaw, thumb coming to rest on Steve’s lower lip, tugging it gently downwards, gliding to and fro across its smooth underside as if sampling the slickness it finds there.
Steve hums his approval and begins to suck more vigorously, bobbing his head in time with his hand on his cock.
Tony Stark. What a cockblock amirite? Or, not a cockblock. What’s the word for wanting to hang out with your currently-non-sexual crush except you don’t even realize it’s a crush, you just think you’re really, really horny for their friendship? A that-block.
“Of course.” Steve gives Iron Man a reassuring smile. “This probably wasn’t how you planned to spend your morning, huh?”
“Not going to be winning any beauty contests,” Tony hums, “but at least I don’t feel like throwing up every time I look at you. Say cheese!”
he’s talking about—if you look up ‘desirable’ in the dictionary it’s accompanied with a photo of Tony’s face—and so it doesn’t mean anything. Not really.
He reaches down to take himself in hand, and that feels right, that feels good, to be touching himself with Tony’s—no, not Tony’s, Iron Man’s—with Iron Man’s cock in his mouth.
“You’re so beautiful,” the woman says, and the awe in her words is like a command interfacing directly with your code because suddenly the memory is playing in realtime—
You hear the opening of drawers, the rustle of someone rummaging through discarded clothing. You hear Maya curse.
Steve freezes. There’s a strange feeling in his abdomen, as if his heart and stomach had suddenly flipped places.
“I don’t care what you thought,” he interjects. “The only thing I care about is whatever’s in that bag, and even then only barely. So budge up.” He sets the suit to disengage.
Normally, Steve takes Iron Man’s flirting in the spirit it’s intended—a bit of light-hearted banter between friends, but now it grates against his over-sensitized nerves. He needs to end this conversation
“Did it even occur to you,” he asks, fighting for some small semblance of calm, “that this room might be bugged?”
He glances back over at Iron Man, who has turned towards Thor in what would probably seem to anyone else to be total attention.
also, 3x a week is too frequent for my brain, so I'll finish this week according the orig schedule (update tonight, plus update on Thursday), and then after that it's gonna be Sundays and Wednesdays until we hit the new material. just fyi
So, all in all, while he’s not exactly thrilled by the return of his prodigal libido, it’s nothing he doesn’t know how to deal with.
Steve tries to dredge up a suitable response to Iron Man’s teasing, but his mouth is dry as his imagination conjures Tony in his workshop, grease-marked and rumpled—
God only knows when you’ll see him again. On the battlefield, maybe—broken bodies, rubble and mud, cold light gleaming off a hard edge of vibranium as the shield comes up, swings down, down—
He turns to the side, walks forwards a few paces, stops, turns, walks a few paces back. Stops. “You know, you really are the most unrepentant asshole?”
“I can’t explain it, but believe me, you’d be laughing too if you— At least, I hope you would. It just, um. It occurs to me there’s a really simple solution to your problem. That’s all.”
Carnelia. This time last year, who had even heard of it? Apart from trivia buffs, international relations majors, and—just maybe—its own ministers. And today it was the battlefield for two wars: the one lying in wait for Tony’s arrival, and the one that followed him here.
Iron Man clucks his tongue and trails his hand down Steve’s neck and across his chest, seeming to linger just for a moment over Steve’s left pectoral. Then he begins to pull away.
Luke, unsurprisingly, declines, and that’s another thing you don’t have time for: Luke’s pissy, half-assed iconoclasm. You’re just about to tune back out except—
“What?” Iron Man sounds genuinely shocked. “No! God, no. How could you— And even if I was that much of an asshole, I hope I’m not that much of a hypocrite.”
A groan tears from Steve’s throat, drowning out the rest of Iron Man’s words as twin spots of flame and pressure carve trails down either side of Steve’s spine. They
Rogers is watching him closely. “What do you know about where the Sons of the Great Bear are getting their weapons?”
a man. The name’s a clue, of course, and the Avengers all refer to Iron Man as “he” and Iron Man has never corrected them, but has he ever said anything to confirm the assumption?
“You’ve seen me shirtless before,” Steve reminds him. He still feels embarrassed, but there’s a strange edge of pleasure to it now. Iron Man likes the way he looks.
The instruction is no sooner given than Iron Man renders it impossible, as one of Iron Man’s hands covers Steve’s cock, giving him a few gentle strokes, almost a reassurance, and it feels so good—so damn
He imagines opening his mouth for Tony eagerly, willingly, of his own accord. Imagines Tony’s half-incredulous gasp of pleasure. Drags his tongue up the underside of Tony’s cock.
Next chapter might be a little longer coming out because I have a few other WIPs I need to finish first, but if you haven’t heard from me by the new year, feel free to come and poke me gently on tumblr or whatever.
To breathe, first, calm his racing heartbeat, in—and his nostrils were flooded with floral fragrance, almost cloying now in his over-sensitive state. When did it get that strong? How—?
A smile flickers at the corners of Steve’s mouth, almost despite himself. “I mean, I’m not complaining so fa—
—even from Steve’s enhanced hearing. Still, Steve didn’t like it, being cut off like that, under the circumstances. Not knowing what was going on. He could always just… just open the door and check…
The villain intent on taking apart Times Square is new, or, at least, no one Steve or any of the other Avengers have ever heard of. He fights like it’s personal though, with a bevy of insults and no clear aim other than general mayhem.
of yours either. So tell me, Tony—” a light in her eyes, savage and empty and just this side of sane “—god’s honest truth, what the fuck does any of it
“FRIDAY, enhance model 600%. Run surface density analysis, and remove all abrasions deeper than… call it 0.6 millimeters.” He squints at the projection. Not much to see. Okay. “Reverse parameters. Shallower, not deeper.” Nothing. Gibberish. He thought for a moment he might’ve glimpsed some pattern in among the noise but…
Tony stows the phone again and stands up. Steve lets his head droop a little and watches him pace for a moment, the immaculate crease of his pant legs, the shining leather of his shoes.
Iron Man makes a small sound of realization. He’s always been quick on the update. “Oh, honestly, Winghead. Is this because I said, in the note…?” The tension has left his voice now, replaced by amused exasperation. “It’s just an
Maya’s already off you by the time you come back to yourself. She’s rolled onto her side, hand delving between her legs.
so you open your mouth and you choke it back and you choke it back and you say, “Hey,” and don’t say, “handsome,” or “babe,” or “beloved,” or any one of the myriad easy endearments that are no longer yours to use, that will never be yours again.
A shadow of a smile flickers across his disgustingly perfect face. It makes Tony kind of want to die. A murder-suicide, that’s what it’s going to be.
“In that case,” you say, rounding on him, “there are only two choices. There’s one side, and there’s the other, and we’ve already established that that’s not going to
The thought of Iron Man getting him off with Tony’s technology is almost hotter than Steve can stand, but it’s not what he
“I don’t think—” Steve’s mouth pulls to one side. “I mean, if that were true, wouldn’t I only be interested in women?”
springs to his lips with alarming ease. Steve’s made it most of the way through his cycle on his own, but just these past few minutes have him halfway to undone.
“I know the girls would thank you, if they knew about you,” he says, and then, as Steve tenses, continuing in horrible, singsong reassurance: “They don’t, though, and I’m not going to tell them. You’re my filthy little secret.”
“I have to—” he rasps, and somehow it’s so much worse, to be there in public, with the eyes of the city—the eyes of his teammates, two pairs questioning, one pair widening in realization—upon him, all the scrutiny so much oil on the fire burning inside him as the longing climbs rapidly towards a fever-pitch, as a single name pulses through his veins like the beating of drums—
Rogers grimaces. “Not yet. But we’ve got something else.” He reaches down to retrieve a leather satchel at his feet and sets it on the table. “I think this is a little closer to your paygrade.”
Steve pulls a face and Iron Man chuckles again, reaching over to drag his nails lightly down Steve’s forearm, a caress with the merest suggestion of bite to it. Steve shivers.
Steve jerks forward in his chair, hands clamping down on the armrests. “Because you were changing! You were changing yourself and you were pulling away from me and I didn’t know how— I couldn’t—”
The two of you in a room in your old mentor’s house. Together. Alone. Both fugitives and damn near crawling out of your skins with it. Maya’s got a drink in her hand and you dig your fingernails into your palms to disguise the way they ache in their emptiness.
The words come out largely unintelligible, but apparently Iron Man understands them well enough, because he huffs out a laugh.
“Because if not, I don’t mind— I’m more than happy to bottom, or to do something else entirely, if that’s what you—”
(Also, if anyone’s interested in Tony’s characterization here, I wrote a little character study for him which is now number three in the series.)
You wonder if it’s always been in you, this capacity for treachery, or if it’s yet another gift of your new body.
The worst thing is, he’s not wrong. Steve has spent so much of his life as a vessel. First for its country, all its hopes and aspirations and most dearly treasured fantasies, then for the idol he made of his own rage, and now, finally, at the end of his life—of his
He should really get up soon. Any minute now. Actually get up—get up and start his day. He’ll feel better for it—he’s always felt at his best when in action. He’ll change the sheets, that’s a good start. Take a shower.
Steve felt an overwhelming surge of relief—it wasn’t just him, he wasn’t alone—before he realized a very important difference.
“Mmm,” Steve agrees, making another grab for the pillow. He tucks it under his head, and smiles in Iron Man’s direction. The smile slips slowly from his face. “You going, then?”
You mean to say something about Washington—meetings, galas, responsibilities, a perfectly accurate and entirely dishonest answer any politician would be proud of—but somehow what comes out is, “I thought it would be best.” You manage to stop talking then, or at least, your throat closes up, which amounts to the same thing.
It was such a revelation to you, the idea that something could be so manifestly flawed and still be beautiful. Your lovers have always been perfect in your eyes, and Steve the greatest paragon of all.
it’s a lie. You’ve seen it, nearly every night now, the moment you close your eyes and even creeping into your waking hours: the cold rage in Steve’s eyes, the cut-glass curl to his lip. He’s halfway there already without even realizing it; he’s
Warnings flash red and urgent across the HUD. Your right hand is fractured in eleven places. You’ve got a punctured lung. You’re bleeding internally. The only reason you’re still even upright is that the suit is pumping enough painkillers into your bloodstream to fell a horse. You need medical attention, and soon, or—no use sugarcoating it—your injuries are going to kill you.
Rogers inhales sharply, but when Tony glances over at him, his face is determinedly blank. As Tony watches, it shades into uncertainty, the first slip of confidence Tony’s seen from him so far.
Beside you, your lover sleeps fitfully, grunting and twitching. You can tell from the flex of his fingers around the rim of an imagined shield that he is dreaming of war.
Back in his room, he changes into work-out clothes. Does a hundred push-ups, then a hundred more. Wastes almost half an hour on jumping jacks. Does every stretch and warm-up that he can think of. Tries jogging in place.
“Sure,” he says. “Yeah, I can—” The hand on Steve’s ass slides up, starts tugging on the waistband of Steve’s boxers. “Fingers might be a little cold, but…”
“In that case…” There’s an air of slight confusion in Giant-Man’s voice, as if he can hardly believe the words coming out of his own mouth. “The meeting is adjourned.”
Steve is lying on the bed in the wake of his third orgasm in the morning, spent but not quite sated. Still, at least his blood seems to have settled long enough for him to catch his breath. As it turns out, this is just as well.
This is the heart of you now, this bleak, black solitude, the sucking maelstrom of loss and shame contained within your chest, your body a perfect, untouchable prison for your all too flawed, all too touchable soul. For a moment, you indulge yourself with a fantasy—of letting yourself fall into that abyss. What it would be like to give up. Give in. To
He gives his head a little shake to clear it. His throat is tight; his lungs won’t seem to fill properly.
? As if Steve wouldn’t have found one by now, if it existed—as if he wouldn’t have jumped on the chance—
“There’s got to be a way— Maybe if you just found a partner, someone to work it off with. You said you didn’t used to… not alone, right? There are thousands—tens of thousands, hundreds, even—of people in New York alone who would be happy to— Hell, I know a few places in the Village, you’ll barely be able to get through the door without half a dozen Tony Stark lookalikes falling over themselves to take you home.”
He laughs, flat and utterly without mirth. “No, what am I saying, of course you brought me a weapon.”
“You’re not going to clean up?” Steve asks, surprised. “You can’t tell me you’ll be comfortable like that.”
“Whatever it is,” Steve says, “we’ll face it together.” His voice rings with earnest conviction, and that—that’s what finally gets to you.
He reaches out with one gleaming shoe and presses into Steve’s crotch, dragging the toe down the soft curve of his flaccid cock.
That sadness is swept away as Steve realizes the other thing Iron Man has been trying to keep Steve from feeling, namely, the fact that he’s still wearing underwear, and that underneath it, he’s fully hard and leaking. Steve can feel the evidence pressed against his thigh.
Rogers ignores him. “You start building in the district where the Sons of the Great Bear have been most active, then you organize a business trip with the kind of media fanfare usually reserved for visiting royalty—”
Boys, boys, whitefish and cream cheese and lox are BOTH acceptable bagel toppings. (what is fluff even? is it arguing about bagels? it is, right? genuinely I have no idea what's going on there. maybe I was hungry?) I'm just saying, though, love is knowing how the other person eats their bagel.
You’re out of the shower and have just finished toweling yourself off when you hear a pounding on the bathroom door. Your heart turns over in your chest, but it’s only Maya.
Tony stares at him a moment, weighing the potential pros and cons of strangling a former national icon with his bare hands. Then, somewhat to his surprise, a laugh burbles up in his chest. He can’t help it. He’s always admired bare-faced effrontery. It calls to something in him.
“I think,” Steve says a little louder, “the problem with spending too much time staring at a problem is that you stop being able to see it clearly.”
Whatever your engineer’s soul might want to believe, Newton’s clockwork universe—it’s slick, mechanized inevitability—is a lie. Reality, at its very heart, runs on chance. On probability. On uncertainty, and randomness, and, just maybe, a choice.
Iron Man seems to sag forward. He brushes the fingers of his gauntlet over Steve’s own, a brief gesture of comfort and solidarity. “I promise,” he says.
and make the call. Or—not wants to exactly, but wants to want to. Wants to imagine that he could. That there was ever even a choice to be made.
He redistributes his weight again, a seismic shift in the topography of Steve’s world. Steve startles and tenses as Tony’s hand falls heavily on the back of his head.
to sleep, so maybe something more like… I don’t know. Chamomile tea? That’s a thing people drink, isn’t it? Or hot milk punch? I haven’t had that since I was a kid. Doubt it’d make much of a difference to you what with the whole…” He gestures vaguely at Steve, indicating, Steve supposes, the super soldier serum. “But maybe, you know, you’d at least get the placebo effect?” He pulls a face. “I’m rambling.”
“Mother of God, Tony, you—” And then there was nothing else to say. Steve crossed the room in three strides, and then he was taking Tony’s face in his hands, drawing it up to his and Tony’s lips were parting and the heat of his breath—the heat and the wet and the heat—
Steve sucks in a great gasp of air at the idea—the image of Iron Man approaching his boss like some kind of—of
“Iron Man!” he says, pulling open the door. He rearranges his features into an approximation of the welcoming smile with which he would, under any other circumstance, greet his best friend in the modern age. “What can I do for you?”
something in him suggested. Tony probably wouldn’t mind. He didn’t seem to have the capacity for shame.
What was it Romanoff had written on his SHIELD evaluation? “Iron Man, yes; Tony Stark, not recommended?”
“No, you are not,” Iron Man agrees, “and believe me, I’m enjoying that, but I was mostly talking about all this.” He swipes a finger through the precum beading at the head of his cock, dragging across his slit in a way that makes Steve moan and rock his hips. “You’re so
With one data-stream streak of consciousness, you reach for your Argonauts: your greatest invention (apart from yourself), your vanguard, your vision of a world made safe. You are in low-earth orbit, inside a shielded satellite currently positioned 1,800 miles above Vanuatu. Your armors are just where you left them. Still dormant. Still awaiting the word that will launch them into the uncharted vastness of the future. You sigh in a part of yourself that no longer has access to lungs.
said noble steed. He settles on a scene from the novel instead: Arthur and Merlyn at the battlements, overlooking their kingdom.
a together.” It’s as if another force entirely has seized control of your mouth, the words flooding out as from a dam unstoppered. “That’s the whole point. The thing that’s coming? It’s going to break us, Steve, break us right in two, and by the time it happens, you won’t even care.” And it must be true that you can’t control this, because surely you would never have spoken the next words aloud of your own volition, the heart-caught whisper of them: “You’re going to hate me.”
A shard of metal, smoke-stained, melted and misshapen. And another one, about six centimeters longer. And another. And another. And—
“I think there’s you—” and by the time you realize you should have stopped him, he’s already taken your hand, “and me,” pressing it briefly to his chest, then holding it in the space between you as he continues. “What if— what if
There is a man on the streets, ragged and half-frozen, clutching a newborn baby in his arms and thinking, maybe life is something worth fighting for.
All traces of humor vanish. It’s a moment before he speaks. “I want a lot of things, I guess. I— Can I sit down?”
Tony reminded him of Monaghan sometimes, a little. They weren’t really anything alike. Charlie Monaghan was a sweet-faced kid of nineteen, soft-spoken and eager and none too bright, whereas Tony… Tony was all angles and hard-polished edges, and he was a damn sight older than nineteen.
He wouldn’t even be the first to make that mistake. There’d been a couple of… of misunderstandings, hastily and definitively set to rights, about Steve and the kind of man he was. That was back in the days before the serum, mostly. Afterwards, people had tended to let Steve be. Which was fine—was good, even. Was what Steve wanted. Do the job, get in, get out, win the war, get home to Gail. He hadn’t been in the market for distractions, and the guys out there had sensed that, or seemed to.
A brief pause. Then: “Are you sure?” Iron Man asks, uncertainly. “That was a pretty nasty hit you took, serum or no.”
Iron Man lets out a huff of laughter. It has no warmth in it. “I guess you don’t read the tabloids, huh? Let me assure you, Cap, Mr. Stark’s most definitely, uh. Equal opportunity, so to speak.”
He’d just finished the first section when the cycle hit and put all thoughts of light entertainment out of his mind.
He blinks spots from his eyes. He feels obscurely like something momentous has happened, but he can’t for the life of him think of what. Or how. Or why.
You find him in the rubble, slumped over, battered and groaning. He’s clearly clinging to consciousness through sheer force of willpower, but still awake. Still miraculously alive. The rush of relief that hits you then is so bright, so heady and overwhelming that you forget for a moment that all of this is your fault. Trust him to outlast the guy with invulnerable skin and the guy with adamantium bones, the crazy, stubborn, magnificent bastard, Steve,
Steve’s mind may be blurred and blotted with need, but he’s still a strategist. Iron Man’s not sure Steve wants this? Then Steve will just have to convince him.
Except it might be better—might be kinder to the both of you to let him believe that you have, but something has sharpened in Steve’s expression, like a bloodhound picking up a scent. He’s leaning forward now, a posture not of defeat but of intent, and you know you’ve already given yourself away.
“You’re absolutely right,” Iron Man says gravely, carrying on a one-sided conversation. “That was far too open-ended. Forget the metaphysics, let’s stick with something concrete. What do you usually do?”
Steve bites down on his lip and puts up his hands. “I’m sorry,” he says, angling himself so he’s no longer blocking you in, and in that moment you come as close as you ever have to hating him, for his consideration, for his perseverance. For being so
Steve blinks, trying to refocus on reality. Speech takes a surprising amount of effort. “Feels…” He gives up on holding his head upright, lets it droop onto his chest, and is rewarded with a stroke of heat up the back of his neck. “You could,” he suggests, “more, if you…”
That, somehow, is the hardest admission of all. If you knew him less well—understood him less—maybe it wouldn’t have come down to this. Maybe you could’ve kept on in ignorance for a few more weeks, a month, before—
There’s a weight and an import to the question—even through everything else, Steve can sense that. It’s almost enough to make him want to pretend misunderstanding—to say, yes, of course he has, of course he’s done this before. He is so far from being a virgin, after all.
Iron Man breathes out a curse, then, raising his voice, he says, “I’m going to go shut the door. I’ll be back in a moment. Don’t run out on me, okay?”
It’s a new world. The old way of doing things just isn’t going to cut it anymore. New world with new demands and a new you to meet them. You need to prioritize things like efficiency. No room for sentiment, just doing what it takes to get the job done, and anyway, pretty soon you’re going to have enough red in your ledger that you can’t let yourself get all worked up over a dead man who isn’t even dead.
Next up: Just two bros, neither of whom are secretly and/or unwittingly in love or lust with the other, having a conversation about sexuality and genetically modified biology. Everyone is super honest and no one hides anything because again, neither of these bros is secretly and/or unwittingly in love or lust with the other.
Iron Man thrusts in again, deeper than ever before, the head of his cock dragging across Steve’s prostate. Steve gives a hoarse little shout, bucking upwards as pleasure ignites like a firework within him.
Tony’s already in the kitchen when Steve comes down. Steve comes to a halt in the doorway, transfixed by the sight. Tony is caught between the yellowish, half-dimmed illumination of the overhead lights and the harsher light of the open refrigerator. He looks almost unreal, the soft wave of his dark hair picked out in bronze at the back, shading at the front to a gleaming blue-white. Vivid and subtle. Light and dark.
“I need,” Steve pants, and he doesn’t know what he needs, but apparently Iron Man does, because something brushes across his stomach and then there’s a hand curling around his cock, slicking him with his own precome and it’s so
“Well, I do,” Iron Man says sharply. “I’m not doing this to hurt you. That’s the last thing I—” He makes a frustrated noise. Then, more gently: “I want to help you feel better.” His finger skates back and forth over Steve’s entrance, probing with gentle pressure at the place where the muscle turns inwards, and if Steve has ever wanted anything more than he wants this, he can’t remember it now.
For a minute Steve struggles with himself, fighting down the awareness of absence, the icy spill of it across his innards.
One corner of your mouth has lifted in a jeering smile. Now your cheek tics with the effort of keeping its place. “People change, Steve. Relationships fall apart. That’s
He clenches his jaw, bracing against the expected blow. Says nothing. Rogers may not deserve to be the one to say this to him, but Tony sure as hell deserves to hear it.
“And what if you thought wrong?” Steve’s voice is even, reasonable, like it’s a real question. Are you wrong in reading something harsher—edged—into the tilt of his head, his flat stare, the sideways draw of his mouth?
The book is one Iron Man had lent him, a somewhat irreverent retelling of Arthurian legend. From the printing date and battered state of the spine, Steve has surmised that it’s a childhood copy, much reread, and is secretly a little touched by the gesture. Iron Man shares so little of his life outside the suit. Steve thinks of him now as a young boy, curled up in bed with his book, and laughs out loud as he realizes he’s picturing this younger version of his friend complete with a miniaturized helmet and chest plate.
Steve grits his teeth against the sudden swell of emotion. Rides out the wave until it settles back into a more manageable arousal.
Steve’s jaw is aching. Moisture gathers in his eyes, smearing across his already-faltering vision. Tony’s face is too blurred for Steve to make out any of the details, but he already knows what he’d find there: a magazine cover perfection, all the lines and creases and imperfections, all the humanity in his features, blended out of existence. But then, these days, Steve bears lines enough for them both. He wonders sometimes if there’s some greater power at work, some incomprehensible force of cosmic justice balancing the scales. If Tony’s ascension could only ever come at the price of Steve’s diminishment.
God, you think, and you’re not sure if that’s your gorge rising or just a sob lodged stillborn in the recess of your throat. God,
He grips himself more firmly and shuts his eyes, letting the thought grow until it fills his mind. No need to settle on some kind of scenario this time—no need for narratives or elaborate contrivances. Just Iron Man, here in Steve’s bedroom once again, and this time no blindfolds or armor between them.
Tony leans back again, resisting the urge to cross his legs. “Well, I’ll tell the maids not to bother making up the sofa bed then.”
“I don’t know if I ever explained,” he says, noting with detached pleasure the huskiness of his own voice, “what things are like, at the end of a cycle. It’s not just on or off, you know.”
Drawing was always his escape. Escape was something you were allowed when you were 4-F and not good for much more than dreaming. It’s not something you get when you’re a hero. A symbol. That never stops.
It’s on the tip of his tongue to call Iron Man on the lie, except… What would that actually get him? More lies? More searoom in the widening gulf between them?
His voice is matter-of-fact, but pitched low and soothing. He sounds like he does when he’s reassuring a frightened civilian, and Steve hates how something in him responds to the tone.
Steve swallows. That thrust sent Iron Man’s cock scraping across his prostate, and his brain seems to have gone dark and slow and sticky-sweet. It’s like trying to think through a head filled with blackstrap molasses.
The tingle in Steve’s belly increases. He adds a few more strips of bacon to his plate and Tony’s conspiratorial glance gives way to one of reproach.
“Then I guess I’m in your hands,” Rogers says, voice steady, and even through the armor Tony can feel his gaze like it gives off heat.
He knows it’s too terse from the way Iron Man stiffens and ducks his head, the rims of the eye-slots in his mask casting the eyes beneath them into shadow.
“Whoa,” Iron Man says. “What are you—? Oh. Aw, jeez. Should’ve known you’d be a snuggler. Wouldn’t a pillow or something be better?”
Steve feels Iron Man settle behind him, moving forward on his knees until Steve is just inside the vee of his thighs. Iron Man’s legs exert a firm but gentle pressure against Steve’s hips. It feels nice. Comforting. Like he’s being held but not confined.
He makes it almost a full hour before touching himself. He’s never been particularly given to self-loathing, but standing in the shower with the water pounding down from above—ice cold, not that it makes the slightest difference—and his hand glistening with his own stolen release, he thinks he comes pretty damn close.
Iron Man shakes his head in sharp negation. “You’ve been holed up in your room all week, snapping the nose off of anyone who comes near you. You canceled an appointment with Mr. Stark—”
Steve thinks, blankly. Tony has invited women here, even knowing that Steve— He can’t be planning on bringing them in here, can he? Decrepit as he is, Steve is still recognizable. God, the scandal—
,” Steve hisses. “Yes, that’s—” The pressure increases, and the heat is incredible, a mouthwatering pleasure just this side of pain. There’s a roaring in his ears and Steve is no longer quite sure if it’s the roaring of surf or the sound of his own pulse. “Oh. Oh, that feels… Like that, yeah, please,
There’s a slight awkwardness—a tension that’s descended on the room and Steve isn’t sure where it came from.
“It shouldn’t.” Frustration leaks in around the edges of your voice. What you’ve done—it’s unforgivable. How can he not understand that?
He flips the sketchbook shut and shoves it back; spins himself around in his chair. If he has to do this, then he’ll do it, as quickly and efficiently as he can. No harm in thinking… whatever he has to think to get the job done. No harm, and no shame.
. It was as if his body had been storing up every wayward impulse, every flicker of sexual interest, only for the floodgates to open all at once until Steve was all but drowning in it.
Tony’s laugh is ugly even to his own ears. “Oh, I think we’ve established I had the situation under control.”
Yet, try as he might, he can’t quite get into the story the way he’d expected. The newest section opens after a significant time skip, centering around characters not previously introduced, and maybe Steve is taking things a little too personally, but he finds himself resenting the gap, that tacit expectation of readjustment.
“—smote him greatly with a piece of the building the villain had himself shattered. Thus was the foe made victim of his own destruction, and thus was he, as all shall be who threaten the peace of this fair city, vanquished by the mighty Avengers!”
Steve nods, still not trusting himself to answer directly. “Do you mind if I…?” His fingers hover over the fastening of his jeans.
He’s pushed himself upright on the bed, hunching over the phone like it’s something he can contain. He can feel the conversation spinning out of control, and he wants to stop it, to wrench it back, but how can he when he doesn’t even understand what’s going wrong? “That’s not what I meant—”
Steve realized he’d come to a halt in front of the tapestry which hid the door to the bathing room. He cocked his ears, straining for the sound of movement from within.
But as the weeks rolled into months rolled into years, you found yourself watching Steve more and more. Or, not just Steve—sometimes it feels as if you’ve spent half your adult life with him in your sights—but the way people reacted to him. You saw the way the public looked at him in unjaded moments (even as those moments came less and less frequently), like he was George Washington and Lady Liberty and Santa Claus all rolled into one. You saw the way your fellow heroes turned to him, the way they drank him in, the steadiness of his words, the broad and gleaming truth of him. And you remembered how it felt when you found him on the ice, like the world had been made anew. Like anything could be possible.
is what it is, the way he looms so large in your mind, eating up memory, overloading your servers, running your processors into the ground. You need something: a patch, an update, an override. It’s impairing your functioning; you can’t
Steve thinks there are some tortures that would be preferable to this. He’s trying so desperately hard not to so much as think the name, so hard not to picture
You’re the kind of man who isn’t a man at all but a sinking ship. You’re the kind of man who was born to go it alone.
So he’s an asshole. Not above the cheap shot. It’s not like everyone doesn’t know that already. And better some small cruelties now, to preserve the distance between them, than—
He presses the heels of his hands to his temples. Iron Man probably just had some kind of errand to run, or— or an appointment to keep, maybe. There are a thousand possible explanations, none of which merit this sudden swell of desolation
. You don’t know what else to say, don’t know what you can give him except this sad, small sliver of truth.
But you’re the futurist, the realist to Steve’s idealist, so you swallow the hurt of it and you make your plans and you set your back to the wind and your face to the world to come. And maybe you’re broken, maybe you’re flawed and wavering and weak, but you’ll just have to fix that. That’s what you do; you fix things. You make them work. You will do what is needed; you will
Steve, and it’s nothing like we’ve ever seen before. Because this time, there is no ‘us versus them.’ It’s us versus
Good thing Tony wasn’t here after all, to see the effect of all his sly little insinuations. He’d probably laugh himself sick. Oh, Steve knew what they all thought of him—old-fashioned, uptight. A relic. Stark was no better than the rest of them. Mr. Big Shot, Mr. Cosmopolitan—he’d probably never felt out of place a day in his life.
No, it wasn’t anything like this, this twitchy, circular fixation, this slow massing of heat deep down where he’d never asked heat to go.
Once he’s unwrapped the bandages and carefully daubed off his face, he opens his eyes and examines himself in the mirror.
Steve leans forward. There’s a spark of that old recklessness in his gaze, the way he used to look right before he threw himself off skyscrapers, expecting you to catch him, and you find yourself remembering the first rule of flying:
He blinks. Tony is still halfway across the kitchen, hip propped comfortably against the counter, one hand curled around a mug.
He couldn’t have been… testing the waters, could he? It seemed ridiculous, to think that someone like Tony Stark would ever… But it was a possibility.
This as Steve makes a kind of lunge in the direction of Iron Man’s voice, nearing falling off the bed in the process.
How old would Iron Man be? Not too old, surely, to be able to go out into the field and take the kind of punishment Iron Man endures on a regular basis. Steve wonders if he’s handsome. There’s something about the way he holds himself sometimes, particularly in battle, that makes Steve think he might be—as if he’s used to commanding attention. But then, Iron Man can be so self-deprecating. Wouldn’t a handsome man be more confident? Unless something had happened to shake that confidence. Maybe there’s a reason other than a generous benefits package that Iron Man spends all his time in a metal suit. An injury, maybe. But surely an injured man wouldn’t have accepted such a dangerous position?
“Looking forward to that, huh? Can’t deny it’ll be a relief. That groin plate’s been getting mighty uncomfortable.”
If it was just some kind of… twisted alien sex drug, then… that was okay, then, wasn’t it? It was okay to feel like this, to think these things, about Tony. It wasn’t his fault. No one could hold him to blame if he—
He turns his attention back to the coffee table, fingers hovering above the clasp. “It’s not live, is it?”
You scoff, scraping a hand across your face. The blade of your palm drags a thin smear of snot down into your mustache.
Tony says nothing, doesn’t waste the words. There’s no need, after all. Steve understands perfectly well.
Steve’s straining arms give way and he half sinks, half falls onto Iron Man’s chest. He makes the most of it though, brushing a clumsy kiss over where he thinks Iron Man’s mouth must be before his head drops all the way and he rolls to the side. He’s managed to brush the edge of Iron Man’s mouth-slot, at least. He knows Iron Man can’t have felt it, but he feels better for having done it just the same. It feels more honest that way.
There’s a deliberation to the way he’s speaking, a weight and significance to his words, and Tony suddenly realizes where he’s going with this.
He dreams of Tony, the warmth of his breath as he presses a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck. He knows it’s Tony he dreams of because he can feel, quite distinctly, the bristling scrape of a mustache against his skin. He thinks he dreams of other things, too, but those he can’t quite remember.
“I thought,” Rogers begins uncomfortably, and Tony, sharply and suddenly, can’t bear to hear another excuse from his lips, another justification.
He picks up the note, handling it with care, like it’s evidence in some kind of case. Like it’s something to be solved.
You find your would-be victim in Belgravia, ripping through firewalls like so much wet paper. Karim Mahwash Najeeb, former terrorist, current keynote speaker at the Stark Industries Global Peace Summit, and presumed target of the black hat who’s been hacking your nervous system. It would take less than nothing to kill him right now, a whisper of a thought. You’re lucky your hijacker has a taste for the dramatic; it’s a public execution they want, not a swift and mundane slaughter.
way. Maybe he knew them for some other reason. Maybe this isn’t the first time he’d been called on to acquire a discreet companion for the evening. Of course he’d know which agencies were reputable. He’d have to vet them himself, wouldn’t he, as Tony Stark’s bodyguard, if Tony—
Well. ‘Comes back’ isn’t quite right, considering that implies that the cycles ever left off, and sure, seven months is definitely the longest since the serum Steve’s gone without one of his… ‘funny spells,’ as he’s taken to thinking of them, but they’ve never been the most regular things in the world. So all told, it’s not exactly a surprise when he feels that first flush of heat, that sudden prickle of interest low in his belly.
He wipes off his hands and reaches for his tablet. It’s not like this is the first time he’s struggled to get his mind and his body on the same page. A little research earlier in the week turned up an adult film actor who bore a passing resemblance to Tony—the right coloring, anyway, and similar facial hair, although he doubts Tony has quite so many tattoos—and Steve has been selectively sampling his filmography ever since. He’s not proud of it, but it’s helped him before, when things got really rough, and maybe if he can outsource the fantasizing to his computer screen he’ll finally be able to get on with things.
Slightly more obscure title this time, so if you were wondering, it’s a reference to the Book of Daniel and the prophesied coming of a kingdom of iron, symbolized by a statue with feet of mingled iron and clay. “And as you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it the strength of the iron… And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken” (Daniel 2:41-42), and like, if that ain’t Tony…
Steve stands slowly, giving the others ample time to reach the door. He’s just begun to follow when a gauntleted hand descends on his shoulder.
Except there was Corporal Monaghan, who’d made a pass at him behind the barracks one night, and Steve’d never told—
things like that, Jesus—” When Steve rolls his hips this time, Iron Man meets him with an abortive thrust of his own.
The world splits for a moment, out of phase and out of focus, and then snaps to with a deadly, crystalline clarity.
“Hey there,” Steve says, and smiles. He still feels good—he still feels so very good, and he wants to make Iron Man feel good too. “Maybe I can help you with that?”
Steve goes to the kitchen to fix himself dinner. It’s the first time he’s left his room in several days, but he’s finished the bagels and he’s hungry, and anyway, he’s sick and getting sicker by the hour of his four walls done up in tastefully neutral beige, of his earnest blue bedspread. He knows the reasons he had for locking himself away, and they’re still good reasons, but… surely an hour’s freedom can’t hurt? It’s not like any of the other Avengers are likely to be around. They’ve all got homes of their own to go to.
yeah, just like that—or whatever’s the opposite of that.” A strange, twisty laugh. Then, very softly: “You look like my unjust reward.”
“Actually…” He clears his throat. “That’s the other reason I called. I wanted to let you know that things seem to have, uh. Run their course. With my. You know.”
“Not yet,” Steve says in answer to the uncompleted question. The smile still twitches at the corners of his mouth. “But soon, I think. Much better if I’m in my own rooms when it hits. Less awkward.”
Tony wheels a chair in front of him and takes a seat. He makes a few sketches in the air and holoscreens appear; Steve can see them shimmering through the glass surface of the desk.
It doesn’t hurt, because that is a kindness you’ve given yourself. You’re looking right at Steve when you do it—another kindness, and maybe one you don’t deserve but you’re not thinking about “deserve” now. You’re dying and you want his face to be the last thing you see.
“Got it in one.” Tony turns around and raises the glass in a mocking salute. “Cheers,” he says, and drains the glass down to the very last drop.
“Well,” Giant-Man says, glancing around the table. “If that’s everything…” His voice trails away in invitation.
Steve doesn’t reply straight away, like maybe he’s hoping for something more out of you. Then he casts his eyes down in thought and nods, minutely.
It was Doomquest week over at the SteveTony bookclub when I wrote the first half of this chapter, but I'm sure that didn't affect anything unduly. *coughs*
“This?” Tony lifts the mug in question. The gesture brings his forearm to the light. Steve sees smooth muscle downed in dark hair. His throat feels dry as bone. “Coffee. Irish. My muse is a restless type—she doesn’t exactly work to schedule. But I’m assuming you actually
—but in an awkward, uncoordinated kind of way. More than once, when Steve angles his head wrong, Iron Man’s cock slips from his mouth, dragging wet trails across his cheek and chin, but from the sound of it, Iron Man doesn’t seem to mind.
“Someone will have spotted you, though,” he says, as much to himself as to Rogers. “The surveillance I’m under isn’t exactly light. For some reason I’m suspected of harboring terrorist sympathies,” he adds, shooting Rogers a significant look.
“What is this, an H.G. Wells novel? I’ll have you know that my robot suit is powered by far more sophisticated technology than cogs. Steam-power at the
Hypnotized wasn’t a bad word for it. He’d been captivated by the evidence of Tony’s brilliance, his resilience, his craftsman’s eye—captivated and overmastered by the feelings it had roused in him, the awe and the longing and the terrible, terrible hunger. He can feel it now, bubbling up once more inside him and the heat in his belly, the wanting and the
He’s rustier than he’d expected. He’s gotten so used to being good at things—picking up skills quickly. The serum augmented a lot, but he supposes there’s not much it can do for a lousy sense of composition.
than the Avengers have traditionally aimed for, which is what you and Steve are arguing about, but better some lowlife like the Dynamo than the civilian he was threatening, and anyway, you restarted his heart with no damage done so it’s not like it really counts.
Iron Man swears, almost too low for Steve to catch. “Okay,” he says. “I don’t have the master key; not on me. I can run and get it—”
Steve doesn’t know how long it takes Iron Man to reach him. Time rapidly loses its significance as a measurable concept, giving way first to duration and then to simple endurance. Everything falls away until there is nothing left but the heat: the relentless burn where his finger has breached his body, the encompassing flames of his own desire. The fever climbs outside his body, searing the shape of absence into the air—Steve’s terrible, blazing need given form: arms, legs, a torso… He squeezes his eyes shut tight as Tony looms over him, the colors of the fire bleeding across his face, casting his features in scarlet and molten gold.
Below you, you can hear Luke starting up. He hasn’t exactly proven much of a team player—seems to chafe in the role of rank-and-file Avenger, questioning the hierarchy at every turn. Right now he’s accusing you of being a glory hound, as if— as if you’ve ever— as if you want anything from this except to
Iron Man lets out a staticky breath. “Or that,” he says, sounding a little unsteady. “That works too.”
if you were?). It’s a question of metadata. You know what happened. It’s the how and why that escape you.
(Sometimes, in his secret, most shameful thoughts, he lets himself hope that Extremis will overrun him completely. Erase everything bruised and impotent and aching—hollow him to the core. He could stand at Tony’s side again, perfect, ascendant, and empty. But it seems soullessness is yet another privilege Tony keeps only for himself.)
“Cap,” Iron Man says, and there’s something terribly hesitant—tremulous—in his voice. “Cap, you— You have done this before?”
Iron Man’s voice is shaking. “Don’t— You don’t—” He spits the words out like he’s just bitten into something rotten. “Don’t you think, don’t you
Steve lifts the hand that, until moments ago, was holding yours, and clasps the back of his neck. “Well. Nobody said it’d be easy.”
“-derstandable,” Iron Man is saying, “and I just thought, if you’re not, uh, comfortable, I could always take him the uniform. If you’d just leave it outside your suite or something, I can take it to him…”
Tony plants his hands on the edge of the desk, bracing himself. Darkness crowds at the edges of his vision. His chest feels cavernous, scraped raw, his own breathing echoing in his ears rough and ragged as the sea. This is what it feels like, drowning on dry land.
That done, he stretches and debates the merits of going down to the gym. He wants—god, he feels good—wants to do…
But it’s as if you’ve struck at the faultlines of him. Steve’s face seems to crack open; all his tension, all of his painstaking composure crumbling away in an instant.
Iron Man doesn’t sit, not at first. He stares down at Steve for long enough to make Steve uncomfortable, before turning and walking a few paces away. He stops, then pivots abruptly, hand coming to rest on the back of Thor’s vacated seat.
Something comes to rest on Steve’s hip for a moment. He feels sweat-dampened skin and a thick sweep of hair—Iron Man’s forehead.
His brows are knit, and he’s looking at Tony hard, as if trying to divine the answer. As if, for some reason, it really matters to him.
The fact that he’d been sketching the Avengers probably hadn’t helped. Not much of a distraction if you’re drawing the very thing you’re trying to distract yourself from.
Steve forced his feet to resume their pacing. What the hell was Tony thinking, anyway, running off for a soak at a time like this? This was what came of working with civilians. No damn discipline. Bad enough the man showed up to the field smelling like a distillery more times than not. What had Tony said earlier?
Tony throws his hands—the ones which aren’t shaking—down by his sides and rockets upwards until he’s all but skimming the clouds. A little higher and the world would vanish entirely, smothered in white.
“I can certainly smell something,” Tony hedged. “It reminds me a bit of jasmine. In fact, it reminds me quite a lot of jasmine. Unmistakably, even.”
He can hear, distantly, a series of clinks and clunks that must be the sound of Iron Man undressing, but without Iron Man’s voice, without the anchor of his touch the sounds are so distant from him they might as well be a memory or a dream. Steve’s balls are tight, his cock aching. He needs to be touched, needs it like a fish needs water—like he used to need air, only he thinks now maybe he needs this more. Why is no one touching him?
His eyes go blank, light spreading across them like an infection, a cold, machinic wash of blue. His lips work a few times; his hands sketch incomprehensible sigils. After a minute or two, he makes a pleased sound.
The backs of your knees slam into the side of the bed as you jerk backwards; you have to grab at the bedpost just to keep from overbalancing.
“You don’t have jurisdiction,” Rogers says, the words loud and slow and deliberately enunciated, like he’s speaking to a child or an idiot.
“Right back atcha, big guy,” and Steve is sure at least he isn’t imagining the softness in Iron Man’s voice.
With an enormous effort, he tears his mind away. He’s hard as a rock now. His palms have begun to sweat.
next time: Iron Man makes Steve an offer he can't refuse. Yes, it's probably exactly what you're thinking. Slow burn? I don't know her.
Steve’s mouth twists, because he hates that word, “wet.” As if his need somehow made him less of a man—
There is a man in a cave, feeling his tattered heart beat stubbornly in his chest, realizing he could be so much more than what he’s made of himself.
known him better. Or, just maybe, that he should’ve known Iron Man better. A signal failure; a break-down along the lines of intimacy.
Iron Man makes an odd hiccoughing sort of noise, a little like a laugh and a little like a sob and not very much like either.
“I don’t think there’s really any sort of a formal reinstatement process,” Iron Man is saying. “We just have to call up the others, let them know you’re good to go. Or. Not we, obviously; you’re more than capable of handling a few phone calls—”
He rises now, looking down at Steve from his towering height, peerless and immaculate and inhuman. Steve’s body is a network of aches, radiating outwards from two central hubs of pain at his knees and jaw. He hasn’t even been kneeling five minutes, and already it’s almost more than he can bear.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” Tony drawled, like it meant nothing, but his eyes were wary and a little bit fearful.
“Sorry,” Iron Man says, tinny through the modulator, and a little rougher than Steve is used to hearing.
like one, the way your heart is pounding, the way you keep imagining yourself wracked with non-existent tremors.
Either every conflict is made of heroes and villains, or none of them are. And for those who need to believe in heroes, well. Given the choice, you know which of you they’ll pick. You can’t even blame them.
“Tell me that’s not how you see it,” Steve commands, hating the way it comes out more like a plea. “As ‘services rendered.’”
“Because, really, no one could blame you,” Iron Man says, gently teasing—plainly trying to put Steve at ease. “We’ve all seen Thor. Between those biceps and those flowing golden locks—”
Iron Man sighs again and takes a seat. He angles himself towards Steve, leaving plenty of space between them, but the message is clear.
Rogers’ eyebrows twitch upwards, but he complies, still slow, still easy. Not once does his gaze waver from Tony’s face.
You open your mouth, a question still unformed in your mind. You want so badly to touch, to lose yourself in the intimacy of skin against skin. Surely there’s something more you could give.
His voice—its gentleness, its control, its utter lack of surprise—floods like ice water down your spine as, suddenly, sickeningly, you realize just how badly you’ve botched this. You thought he wasn’t here to fight, but this whole time he’s been dodging and feinting, bending the whole of his tactician’s mind to the task, maneuvering you inch by inch until he’s got you exactly where he wants you. This has always been a battle—and it’s one you’re losing.
” He makes a show of stepping aside and gestures expansively towards the door, smiling with far too many teeth.
“Now, be good and wait for me, will you? After all, I might need to use you again, if the ladies want a second round.”
You take out the rogue armors one by one, and you’re almost laughing, because god, what a screw up. What a collosal fucking waste. You’re not working alone, of course—little details like “wanted fugitive” have a tendency to fade away in the heat of necessity—but every time, it’s your plan that finally puts the rogue down. Every time, you’re the one delivering the killing blow.
Tony is staring at him, color draining from his cheeks. His eyes are wide and stricken. “I—” he says. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”
. “The minute you need anything,” he’d said, but does this really count as need? He’s been getting along just fine by himself, hasn’t he? Fine enough, anyway. There’s no actual
Not enough for the simmer in his blood, for the heat and tingling pressure mounting in his limbs, for the pulse pounding in his throat.
It helps even less that said costume still bears the evidence of Steve’s embarrassingly lackluster performance in yesterday’s battle. He’d managed to clean off most of the adhesive, but as for the tear in his mail… He’d jerry-rigged a solution so you’d hardly notice the damage, not unless you were really looking, but if he wants more than a temporary fix he’ll have to talk to…
Anyway. That happened. Turned out a little angstier than expected but whatcha gonna do. THAT SAID, I just wrote a chapter about Iron Man roleplaying Tony Stark, BADLY (I still can't believe I did that), I have been looking forward for weeks to pulling this nonsense on you, and I would love to hear what you think. <3
“Hey, no.” Iron Man hurries towards him, boots clunking softly on the carpeted floor. “I’ve got you. Lift your head?”
You’re still blinking hex codes from your eyes, which is probably why you don’t give much thought to the knock that sounds twice at your door.
Steve waits for the relief to hit him, the vindication, but all he feels is more confusion. “Then why’d you
“—and the last thing,” Iron Man continues wretchedly, “the last thing I want in the world is for you to feel obligated—”
Steve looks over in time to see Iron Man lift an arm and rub the back of his neck. It’s an odd gesture—surely he can’t feel anything through the suit?
apologetic, but at the same time there’s a calculating look in his eye, as if he’s watching to see how it all goes over.
last millenium.” He pushes himself to his feet, swallowing a groan as his joints ache and pop. The fight catching up to him at last. Or maybe he’s just getting old. “I’m going to have a drink. Feel free not to join me.”
There’s an ache in his voice almost as keen as Steve’s own, and Steve doesn’t understand how that could be unless… Unless Steve’s finally asked too much. (Unless he finally
When he comes back to himself, he’s sitting on the floor with the back against the door, come cooling on his hand and stomach and the placket of his trousers. Steve gives a little hitching noise, somewhere between a laugh and a sob and even he couldn’t say which it was closer to. He reaches over and grabs some toilet paper, cleaning himself up as best as he can without actually getting up, then lets his head tip back, shutting his eyes and listening to the pounding of his pulse.
And it must matter, you know it must, but standing there before the withering force of Maya’s apathy with your own guilt wrapped around you like the opposite of armor, you can’t seem to think of the words for
Thousands of feet below, the countryside lies sprawled in an uneven patchwork of yellow and brown, shading to grey in the shadow of the waning afternoon.
Despite yourself, you feel a twinge of pity. You remember what it was like, to face this truth for the first time.
“You don’t understand.” Iron Man’s voice is like broken glass—perilously fractured, jagged and brittle—but his hands are back on Steve’s body, massaging the cheeks of his ass, spreading him apart once again and Steve is so close to what he’s seeking he can practically taste it, his need a tight and heavy weight in his balls, on his tongue. “There are
—and now he’s here, asking you to throw it all away for, what? an empty page? for good intentions, and hope?
I mean. Eventually. Sex is solving, right? Fuck it out and everything’s fine? That’s definitely how it works, I’m like, 80% sure. Well. 65%. If you round up. By a lot. IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
“I want you gone,” Tony says. He starts low, picking up volume and rapidity. “I want you out of here, out of this room, out of my life. What’s it gonna take, huh? How many ways can I say this? I am opting
You’ve braced yourself for his anger. Anger has always lain at the very heart of him, as much as his ideals, as much as his kindness and his determination and his hope, and Steve’s core has always been bedrock. His rage will be elemental, the earth’s righteous fury, and you will lie there and you will take it, because Steve’s anger—Steve’s hatred—is nothing more than you deserve.
“Sorry, I just meant you don’t have to worry about… that. Me. I’m here for you. My dick is…” Iron Man blows out a breath, as if casting around for a phrase. “…surplus to requirements.”
Tony’s freedom, the freedom of Rogers’ friends and teammates—the lives of all the people they won’t be able to save from inside a prison cell.
So much to do. You’ll need to talk to Nick. To Kooning. Get your assets unfrozen. Remove any shadow of suspicion that might still cling to your name. You’ll need to reach out to Reed, to Bob, to Carol. Repair those cracked alliances, and start building new ones. Peter is loyal. If you can connect with him now…
“You’re all clenched up,” Iron Man tells him, voice gentle, undemanding. “If we’re going to do this, you need to relax.”
“Well. Good.” He doesn’t quite feel equal to meeting Rogers’ eye, so he shoves his hands into his pockets and makes a show of looking around the room. “So. How long will I have the dubious pleasure of your company?”
Just a few more days, he tells himself. It’s always worst at the beginning. Just another day or so of this relentless, overwhelming need, and then it’ll be at manageable levels again. He can apologize to Iron Man then. All he has to do is wait it out.
She rides you with a focused ferocity, her knees locked like a vice around your hips. They might have left bruises a month ago, back when your skin was still something that could be marked or marred. You raise your hands to her waist and she bats them away.
Steve starts to turn, but too late. Something slams into him in a burst of color and pain, before the world winks out like a light.
“You’re leaking like a fountain,” Iron Man informs him, and Steve can feel shame spiraling up within him, chased fast by anger, before Iron Man adds, fervent as a prayer: “It’s just about the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. God, what I wouldn’t give for a taste—”
You make yourself walk over to it anyway. You don’t get to hide from this. Mechanically, you dress yourself; sit on the edge of the mattress amid the stale debauchery of ruined sheets to pull on your socks, lace up your shoes.
“Sounds to me like Mr. Stark’s the one you should really be talking to. Or did you just miss me that much? You know you never need an excuse to see me.”
No. No, that’s bullshit. There’s no grand conspiracy here, and even if there was, would it really change anything? Maya’s not responsible for your relationship.
You’ve settled into a sickly kind of numbness, like your brain has been wrapped in asbestos insulation—muffled by slow-creeping poison. You’re looking at your hands again. One of your cuticles is loose. You tug at it until it tears. A bright drop of blood wells from beneath ragged, white-edged skin. You bring it to your lips. Mouth away the blood. When you lower your hands, you see the wound has already healed, the shiny pink of new skin fading before your eyes back to pale. You wonder how much damage you could take before it was too much for even Extremis to handle. If you pulled yourself apart strip by strip, unraveling like a sweater caught on a nail—how fast would you heal then?
You were right. Already without realizing it they’re choosing sides. Falling into line. Defining themselves in opposition. To you.
He finds himself reaching—as he still does sometimes, when Tony manages to nudge up against what remains of his pride—for his anger. He remembers what it felt like the first time he came here, not so long ago—the rage blazing like a fire in his chest, lighting his path, making all things clear. But Steve’s anger was for the man who was his comrade, his friend. For the man who betrayed him. For a man who no longer exists.
? The fact that Tony was a fan as a kid isn’t exactly a surprise. Steve knows Tony admires him. What kind of a friend would he be—what kind of a
“No,” Iron Man agrees, “no, of course not. You’re much more of a dog-type. One of those big wolfy-looking ones with the bright eyes and the noble bearing.”
“And that’s not going to happen if you’re stuck up here—” Iron Man’s other gauntlet comes up to tap Steve lightly on the temple. “—the whole time. Let me help you. Let me make this good for you.”
How does Iron Man not get that? “I just wanted—” He realizes he’s cut Iron Man off again, and stops.
Iron Man startles backwards as Steve surges forward, almost throwing himself bodily onto the table. If Iron Man had been wearing anything other than a suit of armor, Steve might have picked him up and shaken him.
Iron Man makes a frustrated noise low in his throat. “You think anyone would care who you’re thinking about? Christ, do you know how many of those men are probably married with kids—?” but Steve is gone again, back to that smoky, low-lit room and
He steps forward and grabs the strap of the gag where it loops around the back of Steve’s head, hauling back so the metal pulls at Steve’s cheek like a horse’s bit.
It restarts a moment later, thought it seems to be moving with an odd, treacley slowness as those fingers haul him upwards, as Tony shuffles and rebalances and gets his feet back under him.
Funny, the way thinking of him swallows up everything else. Like lagging software, out of date and bloated with the history between you. Put those thoughts aside and look how smoothly you run. You’re skimming the news, you’re liaising with an Oakland construction company to repair the damage to Sal’s roof, you’re running through the key points of tomorrow’s DoD meeting, you’re triple-checking the math on your latest repulsor upgrade, you’re—
A few seconds of silence while Steve fights down a hysterical laugh, then the sound of the door opening and heavy boots approaching.
you start to tell him, but the grip of his hand in yours—so tight you can feel his pulse, the steady surging of his blood. A lifeline.
He rubs at his upper arm, trying to flatten the goosebumps that have appeared there. He supposes he’s just never really felt it before, not like this: the mystery of Iron Man, its breadth and its magnitude.
So he’d appreciated that he and Iron Man were able to build such a rapport without ever removing the masks. As if it was okay to be nothing more than Cap and Iron Man; Winghead and Shellhead. As if that could be
You’re thinking of a shield raised high on a broken street and a broken man lying beneath it, waiting for the blow to fall.
He rounded on the wardrobe. If he could just get one of those doors off, it might do for a makeshift shield. Sure the shape would be different, and the weight and the size and the balance, but all food is meat to a starving man. The hinges—that was where the door would be weakest. The fact that he couldn’t see any hinges was beside the point. The door was attached somehow, and however that was, Steve could break it.
Your hands settle on the curves of her hips. Her hands are harsher. Perfunctory. She pulls your cock out with your pants still on and the buttons of your shirt only half undone.
Iron Man gives a snort, but obeys. He shifts a little and then there’s a hand resting on Steve’s side, thumb idly tracing the groove of his ribs. The pad of the finger is rough—callused. Steve wouldn’t have imagined that, before. He gives a hum of contentment.
Sorry for the wait guys, this chapter ended up being… way, way more challenging than anticipated. Hopefully in some small part worth it though? It could probably use some more editing tbh, but I just didn't want to delay any longer. If anyone is still reading this old thing, drop me a line and let me know what you think!
Such a small, strange sacrifice, you thought then. You will give up so much for this, before the end. For the war you never wanted but know you must win. What does this matter, when it comes down to it?
Maybe it was in the mansion, on a day like any other and yet like no other before it, with Steve reaching out a hand to touch your shoulder, stopping you as you prepared to file out of the briefing room. “I was wondering—” drawing in a steadying breath “—if you wanted to get dinner?” and it couldn’t possibly mean what it sounded like it meant except there was his smile, hesitant and small, and there were his eyes, hope budding in them bright and new, unfurling like leaves at the break of spring—
He’s always imagined—well, always for however long he’s been imagining that kind of thing, anyway—Tony as a leisurely sort of lover, patient, easy, and slow. The sort of person you could laugh with, even in the midst of everything. Rough, sometimes, maybe, when the occasion called for it, but rough like a game, like a shared joke. But this time, somehow, he can’t help but think of… focus. Determination. Lips around him, swallowing him down, sucking at his head like it’s a riddle to be solved, and yet at the same time like the answer to that riddle is something profoundly important, a resolution years in the making. Urgency and care, all at once.
You take the opportunity to finish opening your shirt, to push your pants down your hips until you can no longer feel the bite of the zipper. There’s so much you can’t think about so you don’t—focus instead all the power of your overclocked brain on the thought of kissing Maya’s breasts, of cradling their weight in your hands and pressing your face to that soft, fleshy valley.
Because he kind of wants to know. What it is. What could be dire enough—and strange enough—that Rogers would chance a meeting, and all its attendant risks, just to seek out Tony’s expertise. Because he
He shifts against his pillows, his confidence settling and remassing like sediment at the bottom of a stirred glass. He tries on a smile, and finds that it fits quite comfortably on his face. Only errands after all.
I tried to inculcate in you a sense of the future, he says, like he thinks he’s failed, and maybe he has, because the future to Sal is something glittering with potential. How can you tell him that you carry the future with you always, strapped across your chest like a dead weight—the unyielding iron clasp of it?
“Ever since the serum, I haven’t felt much in the way of physical… urges. I see a good-looking dame—sorry, woman—on the street or the television and I can admire her, but I don’t feel…” He pulls a face, gesturing vaguely at the part of himself which is mercifully concealed by the table. “There’s just… nothing there. No interest.”
A vague sense of awkwardness lingers in the wake of Iron Man’s departure, but it soon dissipates in the face of Steve’s overwhelming sense of wellbeing. Physical, mental—it’s like the high at the end of a really satisfying workout, only… well,
The morning air is cool against his back. His shoulders tighten. He’s aware of a vague sense of unfamiliarity about the room, a spectral, amorphous presence. Or, no—not a presence. It’s the feeling when the light has shifted; everything is different and yet nothing has changed.
Rogers is sitting just where he was when Tony began. He’s just been sitting there this entire time, Tony realizes. Sitting there and watching him. The thought is… His mouth pulls as he tries to pigeonhole the shiver of energy racing down his spine. He settles on ‘unnerving.’
Iron Man is standing in the middle of Steve’s bedroom, fully dressed in his metal suit and looking a little awkward. Steve feels a small pang of… sorrow? disappointment? loss? at the sight of him armored once more. Untouchable.
It all slams back into you at once with such visceral force that for one, blessed moment, you think your heart’s actually stopped again. You
.” The word falls like a sob from his lips. “Please, it has to be you, you’re the only one I can trust—”
“There’s an extraction plan in place,” Rogers assures him. The ‘but’ hovers almost tangibly in the air.
Steve wakes hours later to morning wood and the realization—if the complete lack of urgency accompanying his erection is anything to go by—that his cycle is finally winding down. He rolls his shoulders back in a stretch, and palms himself contentedly. He always has a day or two like this at the end of a cycle, after the worst of the fervor has passed but before his libido abandons him completely—a day or two where he can want the way he imagines most people want, at his leisure, without need gnawing at his bones. He doesn’t think Iron Man will mind if Steve takes care of himself now. Maybe Iron Man will even want to lend him a hand. Maybe—he smiles at the thought—Steve can return the favor.
He pushes on, more out of stubbornness than anything else. It’s slow going. The new book is peppered with unsubtle allegory and references to the second world war—it might almost have been designed to put his back up. But more than anything, he dislikes the changes wrought in the book’s protagonist. The boy Steve had felt for is gone, replaced by a young king, complacent, blithely ignorant, interested only in those of his responsibilities that lay on the battlefield. Steve shifts in his chair, troubled by a persistent but amorphous itch. As if he’d ever, even for a moment, been allowed to lay his responsibilities aside. As if he’d ever really allowed himself to
Across the table, Steve notices Iron Man shift slightly in his seat, the way he does when he’s trying not to laugh. Steve is feeling more than a little squirmy himself, although for entirely different reasons.
Steve hears boots retreating, the click of the lock, and then boots approaching again. There’s a series of faint mechanical sounds. When Iron Man speaks, his voice is right around the level of Steve’s ear, and Steve realizes he must have crouched down to Steve’s level.
Except then, four months out, he was out in the field and one of the guys was passing around a battered postcard of Betty Grable and the desire just slammed into him, a bolt from the blue, and it
that. It was the smart call, the responsible call—not to risk his position and influence, not to jeopardize all the good he could do by getting himself tangled up in Rogers and all his—his
Steve nods indulgently, because he’s pretty sure he could have figured it out himself, but it kind of seems like Iron Man needs this. Anyway, it’s kind of nice to be taken care of, even if he doesn’t need it.
“—brave, patriotic men and women,” Steve continues, trailing his fingers lightly back and forth across his pecs, “unfailingly courteous as hosts—”
“Why do they all think they’re special? What do they think they have that makes them worth my time?”
Steve can’t help himself: he shudders, a wracking, full body thing. His lips shape a plea, or maybe a prayer; even he isn’t certain which.
He can’t deal with this right now, that’s what he can’t. Can’t deal with the news Rogers is bringing, can’t deal with its implications. Can’t deal with
There’s a note of wistfulness in his voice that threatens to burrow, insidious, under Tony’s skin. Tony shrugs, flippant and dismissive.
Tony’s just decided that the best way to deal with this, under the circumstances, is to ignore it, when Rogers continues.
Rebelliously, he scribbles in a full beard, but it looks wrong, imposed and out of place, like Arthur’s wearing some kind of cheap Halloween costume. And even beneath the beard he can see—how could he have missed it before, when that’s so clearly Tony’s mouth, wide and full lipped on the bottom…
He clamps his eyes shut as his heartbeat stutters and speeds to a fluttering arrhythmia, spurred on by a sick and guilty excitement. He feels like he's suddenly found himself in uncharted waters. Without the blindfold, anything could happen. He could’ve seen Iron Man’s face. He could still see it. All he has to do is open his eyes.
After all, how long can charging the armor actually take? How long ago did Iron Man leave? Surely he’ll have finished by now, or at least be close to finishing. And he did say to call, if Steve needed anything. And okay—Steve smooths the sheets across his thighs, eyeing the bulge of his cock—so maybe it’s not actually a
It could’ve been anyone who ratted him out, but Steve couldn’t help wondering if Monaghan had thought
“Cap?” Iron Man calls, voice clearer now and much closer. “Are you there? I just— I just want to be sure you’re okay.”
“I wasn’t lying,” he says, because it’s important that Iron Man understand. “About it never having been an issue in the field. But it’s not— Not what you’re saying.”
Flames lick at his hollow places. He knots his fingers more tightly in the sheets and feels the cotton fibers begin to give under the strain.
It reminds him of Tony—the heat swells, pushing outwards at the boundaries of his skin, which seems suddenly pressurized, taut, vulnerable to rupture—yes, of Tony, the way the smell of metal clings to him, even outside the shop—as if he carries his work with him always, like something in the blood—
It isn’t always like this. Sometimes, on nights like these (and when did you last have a night that wasn’t?), he wakes up first. Often, then, he’ll reach out to you, pull you from your dreaming into the warmth and solace of his arms. Is it cowardice or courage when you turn to him, let him close you in his embrace?
“I—” Iron Man stammers. “I—” And then, soft enough it sounds like defeat, “No. No, of course it isn’t.”
He chances a glance over at Iron Man. Iron Man’s posture is attentive, but otherwise inscrutable. Steve looks away again.
His palms are sweating, hand shaking so badly that he almost knocks the phone off the nightstand before he manages to get a solid grip on it. Iron Man’s number is second in his speed dial, preceded only by the number for the mansion itself. Even so, it takes him three tries to actually put the call through. He drops the phone on the pillow beside him and brings his hand down to wrap around his cock.
Steve wiped a hand viciously across his mouth, the other slamming out to catch the wall. What the hell was
You make your excuses. Well, call a spade a spade: you blow him off, but ever since Extremis it’s like he can’t even look at you except to criticize and you can’t— You don’t have
Iron Man is shorter than Steve—he said—but then, he’d still have the helmet on, wouldn’t he? So maybe, just for that moment he and Steve would be exactly the same height.
Tony’s voice has already gone distant. Steve knows that if he could lift his head, he’d see Tony’s eyes washed out again in blue.
about the note of cheer in Iron Man’s voice, but Steve doesn’t have time to think about that now, doesn’t have time for anything but—
It is almost, if he thinks about it, humiliating. That he allowed himself to imagine even for an instant that Rogers might’ve come here— That he might just have wanted—
“Condom?” she asks, but of course you don’t carry them anymore—haven’t needed one in years. She makes a noise—impatience? disgust?—and clambers off you. “Stay,” she says.
“I, ah. Uh. Didn’t know that, no.” Iron Man sounds a little flustered now, and lord but that’s a heady feeling. To be the one making Iron Man squirm.
Iron Man has moved forward, closing the distance Steve put between them. Now he lifts his spare hand to Steve’s upper arm, tugging him gently backwards until Steve’s shoulders are resting against Iron Man’s chest. The metal there is still cool, a pleasant counterpoint to the heat now dancing across his torso.
And it helps least of all that it’s Giant-Man’s turn to chair the meeting, and he seems perfectly content to allow Thor to rehash every minute detail of the battle at top volume and in the grand heroic style. All the more time for Giant-Man to make eyes at Wasp, Steve thinks sourly.
Steve allows himself to absorb this piece of interesting information. Iron Man didn’t seem smaller than him when they were together, but then, would he really have been able to tell?
“See you soon?” It comes out a little quicker than Steve intended, eager and questioning, but Iron Man only replies generically:
Iron Man lets out a sound of startled amusement. “Where on earth did you hear— Yeah. Yeah, okay, jets cooled.” He breathes out in a noisy, pressurized
“Okay.” The roughness is still there, but there’s a gentler timbre to Iron Man’s voice now, soothing. “Okay, I’m on my way. Just need to grab some supplies first, but I’ll be there before you know it. Just hang in there, okay? Can you do that for me?”
Iron Man had, in fact, given him the copy months before, when they were only just barely starting to become friends. Steve had been confused by the gift at the time—even a little suspicious, as he so often was in those early days. For Iron Man to lend him a book whose first volume had been published in the 1930s—did he think Steve couldn’t handle anything more modern? Was the title—
—and now Yinsen’s son is lying dead on the pavement and you feel, for the first time, the Trojan executing in the back of your brain, overriding admin privileges, no write access—
“Sorry to disappoint,” Wasp says cheerfully, “but I got my information secondhand. I left early. You weren’t the only one with
It never ceases to surprise you, how easily he can read you at times, because his face darkens then. Here, at last, is Steve’s anger, that tight bitter set around the corners of his mouth. You focus on that, and avoid looking at his eyes, the way they glitter, pink and raw with unshed tears.
“I know your principles and I know what you believe in and I know you will always, always do what you think is right.” You breathe in deep, hoping against hope that, whatever he’ll think of you in the days to come, just now, just in this moment (and maybe, years in the future, looking back over dust and ashes long since settled) he’ll understand. “And I have to do the same.”
This story is narrated solely from Steve’s POV, but if you think Tony doesn’t immediately go and have a nice shame-wank to the memory of what Captain America looks like when he's just been sucker-punched by lust, allow me to correct that misconception.
“I need it,” Steve says, squeezing his eyes together so tightly he can feel tears spring to the corners of his eyes. “You, I need— oh god, Shellhead,
“You, uh.” Iron Man’s voice is hoarse, audibly so, even through the modulator—hoarse and a little dazed. “You need me to…?”
So now you’re back at the tower, packing a bag. You have a flight to Washington set to leave in five hours. You’ve got several meetings set up already—some public, some discreet, and one or two entirely off the record—and one part of your mind is industriously arranging more: composing e-mails, making overtures. It’s the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday. Not really your scene these days, but that’s part of the point. The price of political success is a certain amount of schmoozing. You need to be getting out there. To see and be seen. You need—
Maya snorts and hitches up a shoulder and half turns away, and that’s when Sentry crashes through the roof.
He doesn’t have his armor and he doesn’t have his sensors—doesn’t have anything except Rogers’ urgent cry of “Tony, watch—!” and he doesn’t listen to Steve Rogers anymore, does he, and so he doesn’t see the vase he knocked to the floor and so he trips and so—arms windmilling, grasping for ballast in the empty air—he falls—
Steve smashes his fist down and feels the tiled floor shatter on impact. The fractured porcelain grates against his knuckles and he knows that when he withdraws his hand, he’ll find blood among the wreckage.
A rapping at the door, sharp and urgent. It pierces through the haze even as the voice continues, the crackling of kindling resolving into the familiar static of Iron Man’s modulator.
Steve reaches up, more carefully now, aiming once more for Iron Man’s shoulder, but Iron Man startles and rolls off of him. The mattress shifts wildly under his weight. There’s a clattering from the nightstand, and then something heavy and metallic falls to the floor.
There follows a very brief tug-of-war over Iron Man’s dick, which ends with Iron Man pulling out of Steve’s mouth just as he comes, liberally splattering Steve’s face, chest, and, in all likelihood, the carpet beneath him with warm ejaculate.
And okay, so maybe he’s being a little overcritical. More critical than he’d normally be, at any rate, but why should that be, when he’s been feeling so good? Really, really good—the thought is almost plaintive—centered and healthy and—
with desire. Not in the normal way of things. He was sickly as a child and then a teenager—the spirit more than willing, but the body so terribly weak. And then, after the serum, his body was in top working condition, but the desire was just… not there. He can’t say it ever bothered him much. There was a war to fight. He had more important things to think of.
He realizes, vaguely to his surprise, that he’s most of the way back on the bed now, lying against the pillows, sprawling and easy, one hand loosely encircling his half-hard cock.
“…yeah?” There’s a note of wariness in Iron Man’s voice. Steve decides he likes it. Let Iron Man be wary. This is Steve’s show now.
Iron Man gives a little jerk. It wasn’t so many months before that he’d been called in for a special disciplinary meeting after failing to answer a call to assemble. Evidently the memory still stings.
He cuts himself off, not entirely sure what he’s accusing Iron Man of thinking, only fiercely, entirely certain that Iron Man
When Iron Man speaks again, his voice is both quieter and much closer than before, and Steve realizes he must be bending down, leaning over as if to impart a secret.
He comes back to himself when the last of the aftershocks are dying away. Steve is lying wrecked and boneless on the bed, chest heaving, skin prickling with sweat. “That was…” he begins, and stops, at a loss for words.
You press your hand to your mouth and shut your eyes. You feel like you should be shaking, but every voluntary muscle in your body is perversely steady. Controlled. Even the nausea you willed into existence has passed. Your body is in prime operating condition: full factory reset, just like— no,
Except he remembers how the story ends. With him broken and bleeding and alone, and now Rogers is holding onto him again, now Rogers is
Steve shakes his head, feeling a surge of fondness even through the prickling heat that’s begun creeping over him once again. Iron Man has always gone so far out of his way to make sure Steve feels welcome. Some days, Steve’s not sure what he’d have done without him.
“It’s not a question of me not wanting to,” Iron Man says, low and fervent, “I want to, I just— Are you sure?”
The restlessness is on him again, the need for activity. He’s so tired of feeling useless, of sitting around and letting things happen, even when those things are movies or radio pods. He looks at the door and feels a tick in his jaw—glances over toward the desk, half hoping for some sort of work to just materialize, when his eye falls on the sketchbook, still pristine and untouched inside its vacuum-sealed packaging. Yet another gift from Tony, not that Tony and his gifts are something Steve really wants to be— Anyway.
Steve’s face, his brain, his whole body is on fire, and worst of all, his dick finally twitches and starts to fill, just a little. Tony must notice, or maybe he just knows Steve that well, because he thrusts hard and holds, just as he bends down to whisper:
He pulls out and wipes his hard cock on Steve’s face, first one side, then another, smearing his cheeks with pre-come and Steve’s own spittle.
Steve feels his way along Iron Man’s thighs again until he comes to his cock. He takes it in hand, enjoying the heft of it. He enjoys even more the way Iron Man jumps at his touch. When he fits his lips over the head, Iron Man swears aloud.
And sure, maybe you have some inside information, but still it’s… gratifying, in a way, in the midst of all this disaster. You did what you set out to do. Project Argo would have
Another time you might have laughed, because you’re honestly not sure you’ve ever seen him like this, all awed and wide-eyed and him barely less of a legend than Arthur himself. But now… God, how can you bear to have him here, knowing what you know? (How could you bear to send him away?)
Beneath his hands, Steve’s cock gives a needy twitch, and he allows himself one moment of shame for involving his best friend in these sordid fantasies before—
Rogers’ face scrunches up. “Not— I phrased that poorly. I only meant that there aren’t too many places left in the world where you’re not obligated to arrest me on sight.” There’s a drop of irony in his voice, a touch of the old gallows humor. He looks Tony right in the eyes when he says it, like he’s inviting him to share the joke.
But the better he’d come to know his teammate, the less likely it seemed that Iron Man could’ve given him a gift in mockery, however friendly the intent. Shellhead was, with the possible exception of his employer, the most considerate man Steve had met in this era—in any era. He’d picked the book up again one restless night a few weeks back and found himself, to his surprise, charmed by the tales of the young Arthur and his eccentric tutor. He could identify with the story of a boy underestimated and overlooked; even the cynicism that had struck him before had a kindness and good humor behind it that he’d missed on the first read. He can understand now why Iron Man would like it—that mixture of the noble and the mundane, all bound together with a twist of whimsy… A realist and a romantic all rolled into one, that’s his Shellhead.
