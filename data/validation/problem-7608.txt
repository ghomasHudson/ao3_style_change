“Don’t you recognize Iron Man when you see him? Look at how cute he is,” Tony cooed.
"So, I know we've got the next session scheduled for Thursday, but I might have to take a rain check," he said, casually, after they'd wrapped up and moved to the kitchen for refreshments.
After a few more strokes, Tony followed, his head thrown back, moaning wantonly. His come burned like hot wax where it landed on Steve's skin, and Steve's hand went to it on reflex, relishing the feeling of it while the aftershocks of his own orgasm shook his body. It was pain, danger, excitement and pleasure all together. It was Tony, and he enjoyed all of it.
"Thirty kilometers. Two days," Tapio says.
Tony has similar scanners to Sam's, and he should see the same things, but nevertheless, Tony's muttering under his breath, over the comm channel that he probably forgot to close, "Oh no, no, no, no, Steve, I'm so sorry, we're too late. I got here as fast as I could. I'm sorry."
His body felt so wrung out that he could barely find the energy to sit up. Steve made his way to the bedroom and lay down in the king-sized bed, but as tired as his body was, his mind wouldn't let him sleep.
"And switched careers to the NYPD?" Steve checked, though he was less interested in Fury's personal history and more in what he'd found out.
"Tony, you can't, the strain of it—" Rhodey began.
Sure, Steve was enjoying Canyon City just as much as Tony had promised. It was every bit as magical as Tony had said: a labyrinth of stone carved by both nature and people; an architectural miracle that was like Venice but in three dimensions, its canals full of open air instead of water.
"Sure, straight out of Marvels. Did any of that actually happen? Did you even go on that expedition? Did Cauac really stab you?" Steve asked, not sure if he'd believe Tony's answers.
"No!" Tony says. Too fast, too defensive. "He—it was inactive when I found it. I never even got to talk to it, and it saved my life. Come on, Elijah. You can't have many models with specs like these that aren't in the catalogue."
On the other hand, they weren’t in a hurry. The quinjet provided them with perfect shelter from the weather—it wasn’t even that hot, currently—and they had food and water to last several days. So far, whoever had shot them down hadn’t come back, suggesting that the hostiles were only concerned about defending their lair when someone got too close, and were currently satisfied with having neutralized the approaching Avengers.
“I see who he’s supposed to be, but what is he? Some kind of monkey?” Steve demanded.
Luckily, they'd managed to get a message through to Jarvis, who was probably already on his way to them with a backup team. There was no telling how long it would take to find a route to where Steve and Tony rested and clear the rubble blocking the passage, but it was only a matter of time. Unless something unexpected happened, they were in no real danger.
He'd figured out what the message said, but it still made no sense. He wasn't a match with Tony. They weren't soulmates. He'd had that checked. Why would Tony be doing this? To mess up with him and make him feel bad? Steve didn't think he'd be that petty, even if they were far from being on friendly terms.
Tony wasn't hit. Thank the stars.
He didn't know. He had no idea. But that's no excuse. He has to fix this. He's going to fix this. The armor will fly, he knows it, and he can easily add a small arsenal to it, because as much as he hates it, it's the truth that he's very good at building destructive things.
He looks good, Tony has to admit, and wonders what Kamski thinks of him in return. Probably that he seems pale and tired. This isn't some public appearance, so he didn't go through the trouble of trying to hide the bags under his eyes or the trace of a bruise on his cheek from his most recent mishap in the workshop.
He opened his eyes ever so slightly. The light in the room around him made his head hurt even worse, like liquid fire flowing into his synapses. He gasped and shut his eyes again. At least he'd seen enough to orient himself.
"Been better," Steve admitted, "but it's nothing another dose of painkillers won't fix, I think."
There were no words for a good while after, just the crackle of the fireplace and the whisper of skin against skin. It was far more leisurely than their previous encounter; that had been mostly about getting each other off. This was something more. This was them luxuriating in the moment when all secrets were out, all walls down. They were no longer a detective and his suspect, nor Captain America and Ed the mechanic. They were just Tony and Steve, two men learning to know one another—and themselves.
Together, they got out of the car and took the first steps towards their shared future.
Pepper was quiet for a beat, and when Tony glanced at her, the look she gave him was shrewd. "It's not really about matching, then, is it? Being a match with someone doesn't make you fall in love, you know. That's not how it works."
"Stane's drones took him," Rhodey said.
Tony only budges from Steve's side to argue with the SHIELD medical staff about treatment options. They don't come up with much. Their working hypothesis is that as long as they keep the surroundings safe and warm, Steve will surface on his own, eventually. They are reluctant about trying to wake him with medication, particularly since the serum tends to make estimating doses nearly impossible.
"What sort of ideas?" Tony asks Pepper.
Since this was a complete shot in the dark, he could only try to guess what the dosage should be. He'd given it plenty of thought over the past two days, going over previous research, and decided to follow the original Extremis protocol. That meant serial injections adding up to a considerably higher dose than what the ongoing gene therapy experiments were using, but those tended to be targeted at some specific tissue. This wasn't. He needed to make sure he'd saturate his entire system with the Exvec construct, or it might not be enough.
Tony didn't want to start a conversation with Pearly-eye when it would make James even more suspicious—he was already looking skeptical, his frown deepening, his eyes going from Tony to the dinosaur.
"You try having open heart surgery in a cave, and then come tell me how comfortable you are with people getting up close and personal with the result," Tony snaps at him, and backs away.
His fire has dwindled to embers, no longer enough to warm up the small lean-to he's put together, and he's shivering in his summer suit. The shelter isn't much to write home about, anyway, since the best material for supports that he was able to find were the same thin twigs that he used for the kite's frame. It took him most of last evening to work them into a structure sturdy enough to hold up the parachute fabric in a triangular space he could barely fit in.
He opens the door, and forgets how to breathe.
It's not like he's actually getting anywhere.
Ultron would know he hadn't been wearing the watch—the loss of the activity and health data flows would've made that obvious—but since the fake tracker signal matching his frame had remained at the police station throughout the day, he could claim he'd just taken the watch off his wrist for whatever reason. He quickly checked the missed calls. Ten from Ultron, which he'd been expecting, and more surprisingly, four from Pepper. He wasn't going to call them back. He'd see them both soon enough.
"Show-off," Tony commented, shifting to a more comfortable position, his side on the cushions, his head on Steve's chest, one arm flung over Steve's front.
Stark seemed to be struggling to catch his breath, one hand clutching at his chest. His eyes, though glazed with pain, found Bucky, and he made a small "ah" of disappointment.
She rolled her glassy eyes. "Of course I'm not lying. That would be a dumb way to do business. So. One coat of your choice, whichever one you want, and fifty coins."
Steve's waiting for him in the kitchen, breakfast laid out. Tony thinks he seems subdued, but maybe he's just reading too much into what's actually a neutral expression. At least Steve's LED has gone back to its usual blue.
Kamski quirks an eyebrow. "And I'd think you're envious—ah, wait. You probably are."
Steve was slowly getting used to Tony's final pick for his permanent frame, just as he was getting reacquainted with his own changed physique, the lighter build and the lack of enhancements.
—is a pretty blonde with a friendly smile, and Tony recognizes the model: RT600, commonly known as Chloe. CyberLife's flagship, their first commercial success, and the first android to pass the Turing test. Not that that's much of an achievement. JARVIS could pass it using a fraction of his processing capacity. It's just that Tony's never bothered to play at that particular game.
He'd originally accepted everything his rescuers had told him without question. Looking at all of it in a different light, he wasn't sure about anything anymore. He'd been told the dinosaurs were terrible beasts, and he'd believed that, because it fit what he'd heard about them before the island, and what he'd seen of them here—but the dinosaurs he'd been introduced to had been held captive and turned into training targets. They'd had to choose between fighting or death.
"Can I come in?" came the cautious reply.
Tony turned his head to glance at Steve over his shoulder, otherwise staying still. "No, I'm done with this. Go away," he said, his voice reedy. Steve thought there were traces of dried tears on his cheeks, but his expression was blank. Steve had seen that very same look before; the look of someone who'd been through so much that they'd just shut down.
"Give him his moment," Steve heard Stane say. "It's the last one he'll get."
"I haven't given them the full report yet," Steve said. "Most of that will be in it. I don't expect them to believe half of it."
Tony stared at his drink for a moment. Then, he looked up at Steve, those familiar dark eyes meeting Steve's, his expression unreadable. "Back then? Yeah, I think I did," he said, at length. "But that was a long time ago."
Stane scoffed. "Assuming I had any idea who you're talking about, why on Earth would I go for that?"
"Oh. Of course." Tony had known that. It was a defense mechanism, one that made a lot of sense. He'd just been too sick to think of it.
He buried his face in his hands. There was something oddly familiar about the feel of it, the clean-shaven chin, the cheekbones, the nose.
"Yes, yes, I'll tell you," Steve promised. "Don't worry. It's intense, but that's how I like it."
"Still. I'm not impressed," Steve said. "Besides, why are they even wasting time on that nonsense when we're at war?" He motioned at the mess tent around them, as unnecessary as the reminder was.
Before Tony could finish the sentence, Steve grabbed fistfuls of his shirt, slammed him into the nearest wall and smashed their lips together.
On the first night, Steve napped in his chair. The second night, he gave in and retreated to crash at the safehouse the NYPD had provided for him, but only for a few hours. They were also paying him a minimal daily allowance so he could get by, since the bank account Stane had set up for him was frozen for investigative reasons. Overall, Steve's legal position was just as precarious as Tony's, since he had broken his parole in a spectacular fashion. He hadn't really considered the consequences to himself when he'd made his decision to help Tony.
He approaches the pack, glancing up and down the slope as he goes, and it doesn't take him long to catch sight of the figure on the ground, around five hundred feet across and uphill from him. It has to be Tony; the clothing matches what he was wearing when Steve last saw him. He's face-down and completely still, so it's no wonder Steve didn't spot him earlier.
Tony glanced at him, the faintest hint of a smile crossing his lips. "Hm. I thought you might."
Tony had to cough to clear his throat before he managed to answer her, still sounding stifled. "What is it?"
Maybe that was all it was. Steve wasn't sure if he believed that. Even if this was the real Tony, the one he'd known in the past and not an impostor, Steve still didn't know this present version of him. There was a gap of over eighty years between them, and he couldn't claim to understand what was going through Tony's head.
"I was young, reckless, and had too much money. You could say my life was one big party back then. I spent the days posing as the company figurehead, the evenings with a glass always in my hand—Champagne, cognac, Scotch, the more expensive, the better—and the nights with some beautiful dame in my bed. It's no wonder I quickly gained a reputation."
"Then I really don't get what the problem is. Just look at the Avengers. It's not like any of us are actively looking for a match." Bruce held out a hand, ticking off fingers as he went on: "Natasha and Clint are probably too neurotic about their privacy to hand over samples to anyone. Steve's genome is classified, for sure. Thor isn't even human. And me, well, I've got a big green reason not to, and even if I wanted to, after the amount of mutations the gamma exposure left me with, it'd probably be a pointless exercise."
"I was there, and I helped her out of the water," Steve clarified.
"If he is, we'll catch him," Steve promised. "I'll get to meet him today, then?"
Steve had pictured Tony staying at some big ranch matching the luxury of his townhouse, but this secluded corner of the wilderness didn't look like the place for one. The further he drove, the worse the quality of the track became. It seemed to parallel his mood, which was growing more and more frayed.
"Seeing as how we're currently stuck here, I know these adventures don't always go as planned. You can tell me," Steve urged him on.
Steve has only been napping for a few hours when he's roused into full wakefulness by the rain. Once again, he's thankful for his uniform, which is almost entirely impervious to it; he can easily imagine how miserable this weather would be in worse clothing. A vision of Tony shivering in the rain in his summer suit crosses Steve's mind, but he pushes it away. Tony is probably at the hut already. He'll be fine.
"Good," Tony said, and gave Steve's lips a quick peck, his expression shifting to something more playful after the brief serious interlude. "So, you think you could go again? Would you like to? We're only halfway through that list of yours. I seem to remember there was something about riding."
Steve sighed and shook his head. “Tony. Why couldn’t you just get a kitten or a puppy like any normal person would?”
"Shh," Steve hushed him, and peeled off his sock to press a kiss on the bridge of his foot. "I'm not the one who just practically came back from the dead."
"You should talk to Natasha," Steve added, and pointed out one of the two ladies who'd been with him, the one whose red hair was straight rather than wavy. "I shouldn't be telling you this, because people here say you shouldn't pry into anyone's past, but her story is a lot like yours. She ended up in the North as well."
The creature in the cage was without doubt one of the ugliest things Steve had ever set his round blue eyes on. Around the height of Steve’s face, it was some kind of an animal, like a monkey, with those disturbingly long limbs that were completely disproportionate to its otherwise tiny body. It was clearly dressed up as Iron Man, and the costume was skillfully made and full of detail, its metallic surface gleaming red and gold. There was even an arc reactor in its chest, lit up like the real thing. The creature wasn’t wearing a helmet, revealing its uncanny face. Instead of the lovely soft plush that covered Tony’s body, this strange little lookalike seemed to have patches of coarse dark bristles as its hair and beard. The rest of its face was a very pale shade of pink and entirely hairless. Poor thing.
"And I'm pretty sure Hydra isn't doing this to help him, it's just to sweep the whole mess under the rug. Otherwise, someone might ask inconvenient questions about how Stane was able to pull off his takeover so easily. Honestly, I expect he'll have an accident of some sort one of these days," Clint said casually. Steve wasn't entirely sure whether he was implying Hydra would have Stane killed, or that he might do it himself. He wasn't sure he even wanted to know.
"Well, I'm fine now, I promise. I'm sorry I scared you," Steve said, caressing Tony's side soothingly. He could see how what'd happened had been disconcerting from Tony's point of view, but he wasn't too worried, himself. It wasn't the first time he'd run into unexpected side-effects when having sex in a frame not primarily designed for it. The added risk and uncertainty was a part of what made this so exciting—this was just a more extreme example than most.
"No, you're not. You're someone better, and far more interesting," Steve said, getting up from his seat to crouch next to Tony's chair and kiss him on the lips.
He's not quite Hawkeye when it comes to hitting targets, but Steve has super-soldier abilities and years of practice aiming his shield. The very first rock he throws catches one of the birds hard enough to stun it. The rest let out panicked clucking sounds and run and take off around Steve as he rushes forward to grab his prey. He wrings its neck to kill it as quickly and painlessly as he can.
And still, he walks, because he knows he has to. Has to get somewhere warm, out of the rain.
Tony didn't know what to answer.
The transport stopped to hover above the roof of the facility and the team rappelled down. Their plan was very simple: Steve's Commandos would go in from the top, while Rumlow's would force their way through the front door. Together, they'd clear the building as swiftly as they could, eliminating all the resistance they came across. Non-permanent kills preferred, but no repercussions for accidental node damage.
"Right. So, for this one, we have to go to the beginning of my adventures. It was 1929, and Rhodey and I were on our first proper expedition in the Andes. Wow, was I young back then, so innocent and so excited, the whole world still unexplored and just waiting for me," Tony started his account, the nostalgia thick in his voice.
That, he hadn't been expecting, but he was excited to hear it. So far, he hadn't seen much of the island beyond the town walls and the nearby training grounds. He was definitely ready to visit other parts of it, and if that came with the chance to do some good, all the better. "Yes. I'm ready. I can fight either men or monsters, as needed," he assured her.
When his vision cleared, he was on the floor, his back against the wall, and it took him a confused moment to realize that it wasn't the same place as before. He was no longer in the corridor, but in a larger space full of familiar machinery. Bucky must've carried him to the Vault.
The following morning, Steve woke up from a dreamless sleep to the startling realization that he wasn't alone in bed. Half awake, he stumbled away into a defensive crouch. His neck protested at the movement, a deep ache running along his spine to his skull. It took conscious effort not to raise a hand to rub at his forehead.
"Captain America." Tony shook his head. His hands came to rest on Steve's waist, his thumbs hooked under Steve's belt. "Out of all the people I thought I could never have."
"Too bad." Kamski shrugs, like he was expecting as much.
He ran his thumb over the slit, probably smearing traces of Tony's come over his own pre-come. That was a much more exciting thought.
The next morning, Steve isn't there to drag Tony out of bed, and he's fine with it. It means he can sleep in and take his time sorting himself out. He's disgusting, after so much time spent in the armor and then just falling into bed. He peels off the undersuit in the shower, revealing some truly spectacular bruising beneath. Yeah, he really needs to work on cushioning for the armor.
"Excellent," Randall announced, finally having reached the end of his routine. "You pass with flying colors. I'm ready to declare you fit to face the world."
He stays in his spot when Tony continues on his way, and Tony wonders if he'll have a problem with orders as vague as that. He tries not to think of how he could've told Steve to follow him to the shower, and Steve would've done that without a moment's hesitation. It wouldn't even have been particularly wrong to do so—sex with an android is perfectly legal, and entirely ethical, too, according to experts and the general public alike. No need to talk about consent if your partner is a machine.
"Oh, me too."
Steve knocked the guard's head against the wall behind him, hard. He fell quiet except for a hiss of pain, followed by equally harsh breaths. Steve felt no sympathy for him as he quickly gagged him again.
Pepper seemed to relax a little as she considered that. "Not really. Not that I can think of."
"Or you could stay a little longer," Tony said softly, tilting his head upwards to meet Steve's gaze, his eyes sad and vulnerable, looking decades younger than his true age.
This wasn't a major revelation to Steve; he'd already guessed that might've been the case. "So, that's why the occasional hesitation."
"You should be glad my team is keeping an eye on things," Steve returns, a sharp edge to his voice that says his mood mirrors Tony's. "You have no idea how much we're doing to sort out your messes. Yes, I did follow you to Oslo after we intercepted a message hinting at this kidnapping—something all your people clearly missed!"
Steve tried tugging back, and got a set of insistent pulls in return from Tony's end. It almost felt as if there was a pattern. It took him several long seconds to recognize what it was, and that Tony wasn't just yanking at the thread at random. There were longer and shorter tugs: a code. Morse code, which Steve had memorized during the war.
Stepping out of the elevator into the airy lobby, he could picture Pepper standing in the middle of the space in a crisp skirt suit, waiting to try and talk him out of it. Of course, she wasn't there, either. Not like she built her schedule around Tony's. Not anymore. Not in years.
"So, where do we go from here?" he asks aloud. He doesn't expect Steve to have an answer, but he does. The man with a plan, as always.
"So, it didn't occur to you to, I don't know, just let me know about said intel? Warn me so that I'd be prepared?" Tony scoffs. "You just had to show up in person, to brag about what a great job you're doing and ask for a pat on the back?"
It was a lie, of course, and she could probably see right through it. He'd been on a few dates. They hadn't felt quite right. He wasn't the kind of guy to kiss on a first date, anyway. That kiss with Natasha had been just a ploy to distract pursuers, and he tried to take it as such. The memory of it still made him feel awkward. It'd been so sudden and surprising, and even though it'd felt wrong, he couldn't deny it'd also been kind of nice to share that kind of intimacy with someone, as brief and meaningless as it might've been.
"Those firemen are very good at their job," Steve assured her. "Can you tell me more about this upstairs neighbor? Do you know them well?"
"Not much more than a headache," Steve said, rubbing at his temples for effect. "I think I'm going to call this an early night." He took a step in the direction of the elevator, but Tony blocked his path.
It all fit together and made sense when he thought about it.
Bucky pursed his lips. He couldn't just pretend that everything was fine, start making new friends and go on with his life. He'd feel like a liar. "We should talk first. Just you and me."
The first to step out was a large man, wide-shouldered and tall. His suit looked expensive, with a pristine white jacket, and since he wasn't wearing a hat, his bald head stood out. He had a walking stick, though he didn't actually seem to need it. He was followed by several men who looked like your garden-variety gangsters. Steve counted eight in total. He spotted the scar-faced man he'd knocked out in the Groggy Cod among them. They organized themselves in a semi-circle around Tony, pointing guns at him, trapping him at the edge of the pier with nowhere to go.
The breeze is still favorable for flying his kite, so he uses it to check his position and make sure he has the correct compass bearing. He doesn't see Steve. The hut looks closer than yesterday, but his skills at estimating distances and hiking speeds haven't magically improved overnight. He knows he won't be any faster today than he was yesterday, considering how tired he is, not to mention that it's painfully obvious his shoes are poorly suited for covering long distances. He expects that before the day is over, his blisters will have blisters.
Steve's expression shifts ever so slightly; it's still angry, but Tony thinks there's some regret in his eyes, too. Clearly, Tony's words hit home. "This is a completely different situation," Steve says.
Steve supposed Tony assumed that he was asleep, because unlike all the other stories, this sounded real. Steve almost felt as if he were eavesdropping, but he wanted to hear all of it. The sleepiness was nowhere to be found now, replaced by a deep curiosity.
"You're going to have to pull through, Tony," Steve told him, in one of the countless quiet moments that seemed interchangeable and endless. "We still haven't finished that conversation."
Tony let out a squeal of surprise, but seemed to get over it quickly: he wrapped his legs around Steve's waist and placed his hands on Steve's shoulders, clinging to him for balance. Steve may have gotten preoccupied with other things, but Tony clearly hadn't. The feeling of his rock-hard cock pressing against Steve's stomach through his briefs was definitely helpful in getting back to the moment.
Steve wanted to tell him that it would be okay to say if he wasn't, but he knew Tony was even less likely to admit such a thing than Steve was. "Glad to hear that," he said, instead.
He picks up some rocks of a suitable size and approaches the birds as slowly and stealthily as he can.
Him and Captain America. What were the odds.
Tony blew out a breath and blinked open eyes that looked somewhat unfocused. "I didn't know I could do that."
Steve peeled back the paper and stuck the medication under his tongue, staring at his blanket-covered legs.
"Looking for someone," Tony said. His casual, amicable expression gave nothing away. He might've just meant that he was looking for company, for all Steve knew.
That was, of course, the exact moment Bruce chose for poking his head through the privacy curtain. “Hi, how are—oh." He gave the most long-suffering sigh Steve could imagine.
There was a smoking dark patch where the back of his chair met the next one, a few sparks lighting up as Steve watched. That had been awfully close, but Tony was okay. Or rather, as okay as he could be.
He kicked again, and again, and at the third attempt, the hinges gave way, the door falling open.
"Ah, sorry, of course. It's been a few years," Tony said, apologetic. "I think he's still missing. We can check. Ultron?" he raised his voice to address an AI. "What's the current status of a James Barnes? Worked for SHIELD back in the day and got into trouble during that takeover attempt."
If Tony was, indeed, not as unflappable as he let the world believe, Steve didn't think he'd ever admit it. Before he found some reason to believe otherwise, he was just going to take Tony's word at face value, and stick to the more concrete details of the case.
He asked Jarvis to switch the lights back on at the dimmest setting and to play some soothing background music. It was enough of a distraction that it made falling asleep easier, but it didn't change where he ended up. He still jolted awake, his heart racing, the memory of drowning in his own blood fresh in his mind.
"I wasn't just going to sit and wait for him to murder me as a ritual sacrifice. I grabbed for the first weapon I could find, which was a machete that I'd been using to carve my path through the jungle, and lunged at him, forcing him outside.
"Does that mean you'll finally tell me how long I've been out?" Steve tried.
It was all good and great, except for the part where he kept waking up every night, drenched in sweat, from nightmares where he felt like his chest was cut open or he was drowning, or where everyone around him was dying because of something he'd done. Not to mention the constant presence of the arc reactor as a reminder of what had happened, and the thought of how fragile it made him. And then there were memories of Obie crouched over him with the cruelest smile on his lips, his eyes cold and merciless. Tony had trusted him. He would never, ever have believed Obie would try to kill him. He tried not to think about it too much, because if he did, he might start doubting everyone around him, and he had to admit he sorely needed the few friends he still had. He couldn't start doubting them too, or he'd go crazy.
That's the last thing Tony wants. In creating this thirium reactor, he inadvertently came up with something that's extremely weaponizable, and he isn't going to let anyone else get their hands on it. That would be the opposite of what he now knows he needs to do. That'd be spitting in the face of the promise he made to Yinsen.
The landing on the 50th floor was clearly different. This was still Stark Tower, so it wasn't particularly shabby, but the design was more functional, done using cheaper materials and less attention to aesthetics. To Steve's surprise, there was no one else around at all.
"I might be," Steve said cautiously.
"Maya?" he called out. "You in here?"
That night at the Bartons' had been a revelation. The way Steve had acted all confused about Tony and their non-relationship, he might've as well spelled out in big fiery letters that he had no idea they were a match. Had he been feeling even half of all this stuff Tony was struggling with, he must've at least suspected something, so really, this could only mean that they actually weren't a proper match, and it was, somehow, one-sided.
“Lonely?  Far from it,” said Atlas with another rumbling laugh.  “The greatest city of your country is spread out before me.  Millionaires, janitors, young mothers and old men – they all walk past me, and I hear what they say.  Even on Olympus itself I was never so surrounded by life as I am today.”
Tony handed him the mug, then pulled out his muffler and carefully wrapped it about Steve’s neck.  It was a soft, saffron-gold wool with a deep green leaf pattern woven along the edges.  “Here.  You need this more than I do.  Why aren’t you wearing a hat?”
“Which doesn’t exist.”
Steve slumped against the cold granite plinth that held up the statue of Atlas holding up the world.  He’d watched, fascinated, as the workmen set it into place, never dreaming that it or he would still be unchanged eighty years later.
“That's not what you said to Clint,” Steve said before he could stop himself, and Tony actually retreated a step.  He looked genuinely shocked, not ironic.
…the blacksmiths worked day and night to fill the armories, for Ioannes was now in the Low Countries and had announced that he would take Graymarie by the fall. Antonius brought to his court a new knight, one Stellarius of Hibernia, who was said to be skilled in tactics and siegecraft, and set him to preparing castle and countryside for the coming invasion. This man was much in the King’s company, and all men remarked that they soon became as close as brothers, even as Amis and Amiloun of great repute. Even so, none were jealous of him, even the King’s dear friend Sir James, for so good of heart and open of hand was Stellarius that there was none in Graymarie who did not love him and seek his good opinion…
“Yeah.  I wonder what happened?”  Steve pulled two twenties out of his wallet and left them on the table before Tony could say a word.  “I know it’s your turn to pay, but I want to get out of here before things get out of hand, and that means cash.  We’re off-duty, you know.”
Once Antonius had brought Stephanos to the Abbess, he sent for meat and drink to be consumed privily in her cell, for the Abbess Carola deemed it wise to conceal the Captain’s return until the hour of battle. “For the Captain has been gone for many reigns of kings, and much has changed,” said the noble lady to the king. “It is best that he learns of our ways and history before he fights against so deadly a foe as this Ioannes, who will seek out any weakness and turn it against him, though he be ever so high of heart and strong of arm.”
Eventually the noise stopped, and he was able to let the memories go, one by one.  The bedclothes that had kept him warm became unbearably heavy and hot, and he unpeeled them enough to reach for the bedside clock to check the time.
And so sing the bards:
“Steve?  Where – oh thank God.  I was afraid you’d been mugged.”
“Right after the Chitauri attack,” said Tony.  His saffron robe whipped about his legs in the briny wind.  “You’re still in the ice, which means no one directing traffic on the ground.  Fury had Hill relay orders over the comm link, at least until those space whale things showed up.  Without you - ”
“What is this?“  Steve gestured at the carnage.  It was clearly spring, not winter – what was going on?  “When did this happen?”
Steve cautiously pushed himself to a sitting position.  He’d somehow ended up sprawled behind the  statue of Atlas across from St. Patrick’s, cheek pressed against the cold, smooth granite.  “Thanks. Coffee?”
Last his son Antonius, who gave red gold in store.
There was no sound for much, much too long.  Tony’s jaw worked as he visibly fought for control.  “I never said that to Clint.  Not once.  The only time I came close was when Loki’s glowstick – “
“Ross wasn't even there.”  Steve took a step forward, even though the rational part of his brain knew he and Tony had to be invisible.  “He was at Fort Hamilton during the Chitauri attack.”
.  Tony made a face and grabbed Steve’s hand with surprisingly strong fingers  “Next life lesson, and just as an aside, if you ever do this again can we go with Prometheus?  He’s much more my speed, plus we could take a spin around the rink at Rockefeller Center before they recycle the tree or whatever they do with it these days.  They have hot cocoa, not that it’s all that good, but hey, chocolate, you know?“
“Come with me,” said King, and led him hence to the scriptorium of Our Lady to behold the pious nuns at their work. Then he took Stephanos to the great library, with books in Latin and Greek and other tongues, and afterwards to the stonecarvers and glaziers as they worked to adorn a chapel dedicated to Huard and Maria. Lastly they visited the great workshops and smithies where Antonius spent his work time, and when the bells rang for the evening meal Stephanos had seen reasons enough to cherish Graymarie in this time as well as his own.
“Don’t bother, JARVIS,” he said, and entered the revolving door onto Fifth Avenue.
“Oh ho!  There you are,” said a familiar voice.  There was a burst of golden light that made him wince.  “I was wondering when you'd get here.”
Cold.
Slowly he rolled into a kneeling position.  He’d learned not to panic at waking up in a strange place – last spring had taught him the dangers of
“Most of the collection can be restored, or so they say.”  Tony gestured, and they stood in what had probably been a gallery as conservationists and museum employees triaged the damage.  One young man was all but in tears as he gathered up what was left of an illuminated manuscript, while a middle aged woman gently sponged soot and ash from an altarpiece.  “Rebuilding the Guggenheim, though – that’ll take years even if someone raises the money.  Ditto the American Wing at the Met.”
Steve managed a little half-smile at the thought of Tony’s mother, elegant and poised, settling down to read a story about Psmith or Bertie Wooster to her brilliant, restless little boy.  Peggy had introduced him to P.G. Wodehouse during an air raid, when her well-loved copy of The Code of the Woosters had been the only printed material the team had had besides a week old copy of Stars and Stripes and a crumbling ASE edition of This is Your War.  “I got that reference.”
Steve jerked back to himself as Tony flashed that beautiful smile at their waiter with his usual aplomb.  “Sorry.  I was just woolgathering.”
“Tony?  What the hell are you doing here?”
So say the bards:
Steve woke in darkness, warm and deep and  still.  He lay unmoving for a moment as his senses adjusted to the lack of light, then carefully worked each limb until he was sure he was uninjured.  Gravel dug into his cheek, and the air smelled of ozone and sweat and oil.   A faint, sparking screech of metal on metal sounded occasionally, but the sound was muffled, as if behind a massive wall.
“Foolish King!” cried the Bishop, and would have struck Antonius with his crozier had not Sir James stood between him and his liege. “Thy parents fell because they would not heed my will. The same fate shall befall thee! Fall upon thy knees and beg – “
Antonius was wounded sore in body, and his heart was heavy with the loss of his parents, for he had loved his mother dearly and also his father despite King Huard's jealousy and scorn. Even so, he directed James and Ginevra to make them a sledge of willow branches to bear the Dragon’s head and tasked Felix Pugilisticus to harness the remaining horses to the same. Only when this work was done did he allow his own hurts to be tended, after which the party did set out for Graymarie’s city to display the proof of his triumph to the people.
“Son, it’s all right – “
“Well.  It seems that back in the 60's someone had the bright idea of filming a burningYule log and showing it on Christmas morning so all the people who didn’t have a fireplace could still get into the holiday spirit – “
“I shall defend this land and people against all comers as long as there is strength in my arm and breath in my body.”
.  He hit
“Sounds interesting,” said Steve.  He breathed deep of the night air, let the noise and the pace of the city wash over him.  “Tell me more.”
Came then another Will, one both grim and sad,
Another screech sounded from somewhere in the distance.  Steve glanced up at the ceiling, then down the tracks.  The light from the fissure was enough for a normal person to see the platform in the distance, the switches and warning lights and the third rail.  “Yeah, that was swell.  I always wanted to know about Loki’s private parts.”
A burst of angry shouting made both men turn.  Steve's fists clenched as General Ross, an honor guard of Rangers in full body armor fanned about behind him, stood at rigid attention before a visibly enraged Nick Fury.  Two of the Rangers stepped forward to claim a dark-haired man on a stretcher.  A medic started to protest, only to be pushed aside by another soldier with a laser rifle.
So the future of the land and the crown was Graymarie was secured, or so it seemed for many years. The young Prince proved as eager to learn as his parents, and the oracular head Jarvis pronounced him a flower of the land, with “a heart of iron and a will of adamant.”
Despite this, the battle that day was fierce, and many great and noble warriors fell to the invading force before Stephanos himself arrived with his own household. Desperate was the struggle to repel Arminius and his minions, and had not Sir William of Naslund and his seventy-six noble knights come by sea to strike the enemy from the rear, Graymarie might well have been lost forever to Arminius and his greed.
“My lord king,” said this Stephanos, stepping forward and dropping to one knee, “send me to thy lands of Graymarie. I swear to thee now, before this great company, that I shall defend this land and people against all comers as long as there is strength in my arm and breath in my body. Thou hast been as a father to me since I came hence with my company, and I would repay thee thus.”
They stood on the flight deck of the helicarrier.
“Yule log?” Steve finished his cocoa and followed Tony out onto Fifth Avenue.  He could go to church in the morning.  “I thought the Viking invented those.”
Fearsome in war and kindly in peace.
“Which is not a concern since it's my turn to buy.”  Tony clapped him on the back, just heartily enough to avoid seeming less than platonic.  “Plus the Health Department gave it an 'A' for cleanliness.  What's not to like?”
…in the year of grace 450, the great emperor of Rome, Lucius Artorius, did send a company of soldiers from Eboracum to the aid of his cousin, Arthur son of Uther, to aid him against invasion and war led by his kinsman Mordred. This company was captained by a man named Stephanos, originally from Hibernia but long in the service of the imperial armies fighting against the barbarian hordes from the East. Arthur sent precious relics from Glastonbury Abbey in thanks, but here the correspondence between the rulers ceases….
And so it was that Antonius donned his newest armor, forged from adamant brought from far-off Ouakanda by Sir Gabriel in the days of Stephanos, girded the sword of state about his slender waist, and rode off to confront the Dragon of the Ten Rings. With him were but three, his most faithful companions: James of Rhodes, cousin to mighty Feirefiz brother to the knight Parvizal, of whom Wolfram of Germany hath writ; Felix Pugilisticus, strong of hand and loyal of heart; and Lady Ginevra herself, who wore her fallen Queen’s favor into battle and brought with her all the potions of war that Antonius had created during his studies.
As for Stephanos, Knight of the Star, he stood always at the King’s right hand as counselor, general, and beloved sweet friend, refusing to claim the throne the people might have offered him. “I am a Captain, nothing more, and certes am content with my lot,” he said whenever asked why he did not retake what had been his in former times. “Antonius was raised to rule, and it is not my place to force him from the role God had decreed for him.”
The waiter narrowed his eyes, and if his face had been a little less blocky he would have looked annoyed.  “What would youse like on the side?  Sweet potato fries, regular fries, plantain frieds, turnip fries, salad – “
Fair was Prince Antonius as he grew to manhood, of more than average height, with eyes blue as the mountain lakes and his mother’s dark curling hair, with shoulders broad from hunting and smithcraft and a waist near as slender as a maiden’s, for he was constantly moving about and oft forgot to partake of more than bread and wine. He proved as skilled a mechanician as his father, if not moreso, devising many new ways to forge and sculpt shape weapons and also devices to ease the burden of the laborer.
Alas! This beauty and skill availed the Prince little insofar as his sire was concerned. For as wise and worthy Huard had been as a king, so was he distant and cold as a father and husband. Some said it was because the Queen, fearful of death in childbed, denied him her favors, while others claimed it was guilt that he had put aside Graymarie’s long tradition and gotten him an heir of the flesh and not of the heart. Still others held that Huard saw in Antonius such brilliance and promise that he could never hope to match, and thus envied his own child so much he could scarce stand to see the boy at all as he waxed old and found himself less and less able to engage in the work he loved.
“Just checking to see if there’re any leftovers before I head to church.”  JARVIS must have noticed him flinch because the car was noticeably warmer by the time he’d reached his destination.  “Christmas Eve  Mass  always attracts a crowd.”
just shut down the system, but there's around a ninety percent chance that'd kill him outright, and I suppose that's not what you're after. If you want me to do that, just let me know. I'd be happy to."
"You don't remember me, do you?" he asked Steve, reaching out to place his hand on Steve's shoulder, giving it a squeeze. "James Rhodes. An old friend of Tony's. Even older than you, believe it or not."
Tony couldn't bring himself to share Steve's optimism. "But what if something goes wrong? All these people—"
Barton's attention was on the bartender and the reptilian, and his gun was still in its holster. Steve might not get a better chance than this.
"The usual," Steve said. He sat up slowly, clenching his hands into fists and opening them again to get rid of the lingering numbness. Glancing down at himself quickly confirmed his first impression: his frame was as buff as the fake he'd died in, his front a landscape of toned muscles and smooth skin all the way down to the blanket covering his lap. His biceps were as thick as his birth frame's thighs.
Tony's own stance was the only reasonable one: that it was all nonsense, like every other bullshit paranormal idea out there. Studying these things was a waste of time and money. This had been Tony's opinion since he'd been old enough to understand the concept. His dad's ridiculous beliefs had fueled the fire of his annoyance. Dad had always said he and mom were soulmates. Mom had played along, but Tony had never been sure whether she'd believed it or not. Whichever the case, a fat load of good that had done to them. From Tony's point of view, his parents had been miserable together.
Of course, Tony wasn't like most citizens of the island, and he had always enjoyed crossing the Basin. It reminded him of his travels through many other rainforests, in the Amazon, the Congo and Sumatra. As amazing and beautiful as Dinotopia was, most parts of it were quite safe. Here, like high up in the Forbidden Mountains or in the caves deep beneath Canyon City, one could still find true adventure.
Steve's hand is still on Tony's chest. He knows Steve can read his vitals without that, so the only reason for Steve to touch him is because he chooses to, and wants to—even though Steve has held the reactor with his own hands, which means he must've picked up on the serial number on the regulator. Is it possible that he's still not figured it all out yet?
"It's just, ever since we got back from the Yucatán, he's not been quite himself. He's been absent and distracted, like something's bothering him." Pepper was speaking slowly, seeming to consider each word carefully. Steve figured that might be either because she hadn't talked about this with anyone, or—the less charitable explanation—because she didn't want to give away too much.
It's obvious he hasn't done this before, and clearly hasn't downloaded some sexbot's software to cover for his inexperience. It's a clumsy kiss where Tony does most of the work, with Steve's mouth unmoving against his. He doesn't mind. It's still among the most memorable kisses that Tony's had; the not-quite-human feel of it, Steve's lips slightly too unyielding, a little drier than a human's; the chemical taste that Tony thinks has to do with thirium. He keeps it brief and chaste, strictly no tongue. He doesn't want to overwhelm Steve, after all.
"Of course I don't!" Steve exclaimed. "I would've done the same thing. In fact, I might do it when I get the chance. I have no need to remember what he did to me, either."
There was a cool cloth on his brow, one soothing feeling to counteract all the pain, and he felt himself starting to drift away.
Steve makes his way up the next hill in front of him to get a better impression of the lay of the land. From the top, he sees, as he'd already assumed, that the wilderness stretches on into the horizon in every direction. He can't see any houses or any other signs of human activity. He does see several rivers and small lakes, so at least finding water won't be a problem. Food might be more of an issue, but he can keep going for some time before he needs to worry about that. Above all else, the main challenge will be finding his way back to civilization, and then to his team, without getting caught.
That got the strongest reaction out of Tony that Steve had seen so far. His face twisted into open anguish, and he threw aside Steve's jacket, backing away from him on all fours, muttering "no, no, no," until finally slumping against the wall, legs folded under him, panting for air, as if that short distance had been so draining he couldn't go any further. "You can't know about that. You're not taking that from me," he said wearily, half-open eyes aimed in Steve's direction.
, rushing across the room towards the couch.
The strutter would walk on dry land, if he somehow miraculously managed to power it, but it wasn't fully waterproofed. He'd need at least another full day of work to finish it, and he didn't think he had that long.
He couldn't blame her for being concerned. He was long past concern, himself; he was downright terrified. Every breath took effort, with the relentless ache and tightness in his chest.
Hammer grimaced. "Ah, yes, of course. That's part of the reason why we're here, anyway. I'm very, very sorry about that, and I want to make it up to you." He motioned them deeper into the building.
"So, you speak English, then?" Stark tried as they left the room, picking their route through the corridors towards the Vault, which was located on the same underground level of the castle. "You must be recent. Where are you from?"
"That so?" Tony quirked an eyebrow, his lips turning to a grin again. "Well, Steve, how about I buy you a drink, then?"
"I did," Steve confessed. In a bout of courage, he took Tony's hand in his. "And I really meant that. It was the most extraordinary story out of all. But, you know, even if it wasn't, that would be okay. You're allowed to be an ordinary human too, just like the rest of us."
He opens his eyes, and Steve is right there, sitting near his bed, so focused on reading a newspaper that he hasn't noticed Tony's awake.
Tony's hand stilled under Steve's, but stayed tense. "You know. Waking up in another body," he clarified.
He knew that the cold was one of the worst threats out here, but he'd been so sure that Tony would reach the hut—and really, Tony was very close, which makes it all the more tragic that he faced his end like this, alone out here, while Steve was enjoying the cozy warmth less than a mile away. Worse yet, the time that Steve spent looking for Tony after hearing his shout can't have been much longer than an hour. If only he'd spent less time hesitating, and if he'd happened to choose a different route, things could have been very different.
Steve slipped his hands under Tony's faded t-shirt, his palms against the warm, soft skin of his sides. Tony shivered a at the touch; Steve imagined that his new clone would feel sensitive, maybe even ticklish, so soon after the transfer. "Which frame are we test-driving, yours or mine?" Steve asked.
"Okay, you do have a point," Tony has to admit. It's not like he hired Pepper to do his housekeeping. It's just that he's busy and it's convenient, and she is so efficient and good at keeping his life from sliding into chaos that he ends up leaning heavily on her for that. "So, can you do those things?" he checks with Steve.
He opens his eyes, trying to brace himself for anything and everything. The first thing he sees is still a profound shock.
"It wasn't a kiss," he said quickly.
Rumlow crouched closer, stun prod hovering next to Steve's cheek.
Steve looked at the two people sharing the table with him, and noted the changes in their expressions as they heard the words. Happy made a little nod, his lips quirking, while Pepper seemed to tense, drawing a sharp breath. Her face looked odd thanks to the subtle layer of anti-facial-recognition makeup she wore. Although it was barely noticeable to human eyes, it should confuse most AIs. Steve knew his own features would be similarly distorted, since she'd applied the same camouflage on him. It was a common trick in criminal circles, and apparently also among the ultra-rich who wanted to go incognito, which was how she'd come across it.
Pepper had broken Steve out from a very similar predicament just a few days ago, but Steve doubted it would work a second time. Stane would have tightened his security measures. Besides, there was no way they could pull Tony out of VR the way Pepper had done with Steve. The strain of that would kill him as surely as putting a gun to his head.
Sam turned to face him and gave him an appraising look. "Did something happen?"
His mind made up, he got out of bed as noiselessly as he could and crossed the slumbering town to the dungeon. He felt like he should be sneaking around on tiptoe, even though he knew there was no need for that. He was considered one of the regular wardens, and the guards at the dungeon entrance just nodded at him as he passed them. He did his best to keep his face neutral, ignoring the sweat on his palms.
"Slightly. Wouldn't stop me, though." Steve crosses the few steps to the door and turns around to face Tony once more. "See you in a month, Tony." He gives Tony a wave and a smile—warmer than the previous one, and damn, but he does look gorgeous, beard or not—before exiting the room.
“You could’ve asked me?” Tony replied.
Convincing himself that Stark was the enemy was getting more and more difficult. Nothing that Bucky had seen of him suggested that he was bad or evil. The way he kept interacting with the two dinosaur prisoners—the large beast in the Vault and the waist-height, sharp-clawed one in the cell close to his—didn't look like someone groveling in front of his masters, but like someone showing genuine compassion for his fellow prisoners. Then again, maybe those two things would look similar.
Every time Tony's tried to ease his conscience by repeating to himself that the android he took apart was just a machine, he's been lying to himself. His guilt wasn't misplaced. He really is a murderer.
"And you feel okay, otherwise?" Steve checked, starting to wonder if he should've hurried to take Tony in for first aid anyway.
"It's going to be alright," Steve reassured him, one hand on the back of his neck now, his forehead resting against Tony's. It felt like a cold compress over feverish skin. "Toro's learned a lot about controlling his powers during the years I've known him. You may be different, but I think he'll still have useful advice for you. If that seems like it's not enough, there are others we can ask. We'll figure it out."
"But you're barely a few hours out of the swap," Tony tried.
"It is," Tony admitted, softly, his gaze on the hands resting on his lap. "It really is."
Now that he really thought about it, Steve realized what Tony meant. There was no subtle way to get at Stane when he was in the Tower. Worse than that, he was already on high alert when it came to security, and constantly surrounded by drones whenever he left his home. Even if they had the weapons to fight those drones—which they might, looking at all the tech around them—it would be incredibly tricky to do that covertly, so that no one saw them grab Stane.
Living at the SHIELD compound, Steve dedicated a lot of his time to catching up on what he'd missed, and computers were a big help. On his third day, he came across a news item that baffled him more than any of the advanced technology he'd seen.
"It's not the same, and Pepper did most of the work," Tony insisted. "How is she, anyway? And the others? I know Jarvis hit the self destruct button, and you said Rhodey was injured."
It was hardly surprising that Steve dreamed of Tony again.
"Sorry, Cap, this elevator only goes down to one hundred," Ultron informed him.
An unsafe virtual reality link could definitely be one way to insert any number of things into a target's mind. Steve wasn't fit to judge if it was a more likely explanation than suicide. He simply didn't know Tony well enough anymore. Was there a chance that this callous facade was just that, a facade, and that deep down, Tony was troubled and vulnerable, depressed, even? Maybe Steve had jumped to the wrong conclusions about him. Not that he wanted Tony to be unhappy, but he'd almost prefer that explanation to the more likely one, which was that Tony had just turned out to be an unpleasant person.
His first thought would've been that this was some kind of joke, but it couldn't possibly be. Not after everything he'd suffered, and not with how serious and honest Lina seemed about this. He couldn't imagine what she'd gain by making up such a fantastical lie.
Steve didn't want to push Tony. He was surprised enough that he'd gotten this far, and that Tony didn't seem angry at him anymore. Instead, he looked resigned and sad, gazing into the distance, eyes unfocused, like he wasn't really seeing the lovely landscape in front of him.
Steve was having dinner with Sam's family when the message arrived, bringing both the pleasant evening and his tour of the island to an abrupt end.
Steve woke up to find himself in a world that was completely different, yet somehow very much the same as what he was used to.
He understands it better later, after they've finally located Steve.
"Ah, Natalie. Sure, you can do this just as well. I need someone to show Steve his accommodation," Tony ordered.
She looks unconvinced, and declines at first when Tony explains that he needs help replenishing the thirium reserve and can't handle the finicky valve himself. He manages to talk her into it eventually, because she's a good, kind person. Not like Tony.
"I've made it my business. Don't try my nerves. I haven't had a particularly good day today." Steve tightened his hold and lifted the man a few inches off the ground. Not that he'd actually resort to violence as an interrogation tool, but the solid threat of it could be equally effective.
Steve let him work at it, enjoying the sensations instead of responding actively, that odd combination of slightly less pressure and more taste than in an organic frame. The notes of coffee were definitely still there, but there were also exciting traces of hormones, a signal of Tony's arousal that he couldn't have normally picked up. That sent a buzz of excitement through his synthetic nerves, right through to his cock.
"A bar called the Groggy Cod," Steve replied.
chained in the Vault with his own eyes, and Seren had mentioned catching glimpses of other dinosaurs when she'd been moved to different parts of the castle. He wanted to set them all free, but how could he do that, when he couldn't even free himself?
Now that he wasn't in the same room with Tony anymore, he found himself considering what other people might think if they knew what had happened. That made it all too clear to him how utterly wrong it had been, from start to finish.
"No, but it definitely wasn't home," Jan said. "He got a call from Pepper—Miss Potts—and told her he might not be coming back before the evening."
He hadn't told the other people in the resistance about his past, about growing up as an army brat, let alone his secret work by Captain America's side. Somehow, maybe just because Stark's voice reminded him of radio plays, and his resilience had made an impression, Bucky almost felt like giving him a few details, but he remembered the Mayor's words. He'd been told over and over again not to trust Stark. How stupid would he feel if he went against everyone's advice, and then got into trouble because of it?
Thankfully, at this point, he was standing by his ride and had an obvious escape route. He opened the door and slipped behind the wheel.
He could see one single explanation that'd make the pieces fit. "You're the reason Stane got me out of the ice, aren't you?"
They were in a hurry, so this was clearly the best option. Bucky shifted on the floor so that his back was towards Stark. "Would you rather faint again? Hop on. I can do this."
Tony made an unhappy face and nodded. "Yeah. We did. It's on Luna."
Steve kept the blaster trained on Barton, but quickly drew his other gun to point it at Natalie, turning his eyes towards her, confused. "You're not?"
"So, what's the plan now?" Clint asked.
"Well, I don't think that's the effect they got. Definitely not the effect it's having on me." Tony licked lips, his eyes fixed on Steve's groin, his pupils huge.
"I want that too. Right now. I really do. The last thing I want to do is wait. I'm sorry." Tony leaned forwards to press a kiss on the crown of Steve's head. "There's just way too much stuff going through my head. Like I've got first time jitters and old guy performance anxiety at the same time."
“Space armies,” said Tony, reaching out to grip his good shoulder, and Steve found himself clutching at the other man’s hand.  “Plus, every Asgardian knows how to fight and use some magic.  It literally never occurred to him that New York was eight million civilians and no fortifications.”
A sudden buzz at his hip jerked him out of his imagination.  He pulled out his phone, unlocked it, and blinked at the notification of a text from aestark@avengers.stark.biz.  He tapped the icon, frowning slightly.  What was Tony doing up so late?
“Pada - “  Steve pulled his legs underneath him to stand.  “Why are you talking about Thai food?  We're in a subway tunnel and - “
Not only the country folk despaired. Antonius himself read the reports from his generals and wondered in his heart whether his subjects would have the means to fight when the Red One was at the gate. For all the good harvests and gold in the treasury, the Dragon of Ten Rings had laid waste the fields and storehouses, and many veteran knights who might have advised the young King had fallen with King Huard to the Dragon. Antonius might have slain the Dragon himself and restored much of what was lost, but never had he fought in pitched battle nor directed a castle under siege, nor had most of his household.
Meanwhile the preparations for war continued, with King and mechanician and knight alike striving with all their might to create defenses fit to withstand the coming evil…
And strong of arm, highly skilled in all war’s arts.
Here the bards speak:
“Sweet potato fries, with the maple mustard,” said Tony before Steve could point out that a green salad and Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Dressing Delicately Splashed With Organic Strawberry Vinegar was much healthier than anything fried.  “And a large iced tea.  Unsweetened.”
“Turkey burger with cranberry ketchup?  More like someone’s idea of Thanksgiving at a hipster hotel.”  Tony made a little
Spangly costume.
Others have written about the great battle that raged upon that doleful day, of how the sky grew dark with the showers of arrows that pierced the Red Skull’s lines and how the shield wall of Graymarie buckled and nearly failed under the charge of the Company of the Serpent and others fresh from the Italian wars. My poor words can scarce convey the dreadful slaughter nor the mighty deeds upon both sides, for as evil as Ioannes was, among his forces were men of courage and skill, and had their leader been a worthy man their prowess would be renowned, and Graymarie fallen to their swords.
“Not this one, oh no,” said Tony.  He walked briskly to the corner and waited for the pedestrian signal.  “This one is – well, it’s an old New York custom.  Not quite from your time, but not new.”
“I told you to keep the mutt in your suite.  He's -
He all but sprinted into his suite once the elevator opened.  He swallowed, slammed the door shut, and all but sprained his thumb activating the DNA lock.  The room was supposed to be set for a comfortable 72 degrees but all Steve could feel was the bitter cold of the wind over Greenland as the Valkyrie began her death dive into the dazzling white.  He bit back a curse that was half-scream, staggered to the bed, and  slid down beside it, wrapped in the spread and the quilts, until the shivering stopped.
for it?”  Steve did not realize he was shouting until he saw Tony flinch.  “It was
“This is well said,” replied Antonius, and while the Dragon slept he did prepare his armor and lance with the alchemical solutions and ointments Lady Ginevra had brought hence. “May the Lord guide my hand, and may my parents be avenged!” And thus armed and prepared did he ride forth to destroy the Dragon.
, and it looks like someone spat in his sandwich.”  Steve, nose wrinkled in disgust, checked under his burger bun and heaved a sigh of relief. “Mine looks okay.  What about yours?”
The worst loss of all was Stephanos himself. He fought bravely and ever in the van, and had not Arminius tricked him into single combat he might well have lived to see another day. Woeful to tell! It was not so; Stephanos was cast into the freezing water even as he struck the death blow against his old enemy, and by the time he was found and brought to land again he was insensible, his noble face so cold it might have been carved from marble, and none could rouse him nor detect any signs of life.
Wherever he was, it wasn’t Rockefeller Center.  Worse, he was completely nude.
Antonius dropped to one knee, head bowed, one hand pressed to his heart. “Great Captain of Graymarie, hail and welcome! For thou hast come in answer to many prayers, at thy country’s hour of peril.”
Steve flushed.  The “art student” had been an unnervingly intense middle aged donor at a September Foundation gala in the Greco-Roman galleries who had spent several uncomfortable minutes loudly comparing Steve to the nude warriors, then asked him to model at a private life drawing class.  Of course Christine Everhart and her camera crew had gotten the whole thing on film, and of course the Ones had decided that “Captain America being embarrassed in public” was a dandy way to end their late night newscast.
Thus it was that King Huard, when age did come upon him, did proclaim his Bishop as regent, to rule in his stead should aught befall him and his Queen before their son should be ripe for the throne. Queen Maria was not best pleased with this, for she was as able as any man to rule, or any of the queens or lady knights of Graymarie’s past. King Huard would not be gainsaid, however, and thus his last years were spent in quarrels and animosity with his once-beloved wife and the son he should have cherished above all things.
, then a sliding sound as something shifted on the polished granite countertop.  “That makes them mine, and – “
Steve blinked, then carefully lowered his hands. “Sorry about that.  I don’t usually talk to statues.”
“I never would have guessed,” said Tony.  He paused as the waiter, who had a strong jaw, badly cut reddish hair, and a sullen expression, pulled out a well chewed pencil and held it poised over an order pad.
…word came from the East that one Ioannes, a Teutonic knight called Caput Rufus for a great battle scar that had left his face and pate as red as the fires of Hell, had turned from the path of God and sought the riches of Graymarie. This man, who was learned both in the arts of war and the most evil of magics, had conquered all in his path until he had ventured forth against the men of Kievan Rus. Their lord, the mighty Alexander, had repelled this Ioannes but at heavy cost to the land and people, and so could do no more than send swift messengers to the West to warn Antonius and the other Christian kings of the peril that Caput Rufus brought to their lands….
- but what had happened to his clothes?  Why didn’t his shoulder hurt from landing on rough ground?  How had he gone from Fifth  Avenue to a place that sounded and smelled like an unused subway tunnel?
Tony hastily pulled the perfectly toasted Ancient Grain Bun off his turkey burger, visibly sagging at the sight of nothing more than turkey and cranberry ketchup.  “All clear, thank God.  That was too good to waste.”
“No.”  The faint, gnawing hunger that had driven him to the kitchen was gone.  “I - “
“Sheathe thy sword, good Stephanos, and I shall tell thee all,” Antonius then said, rising as Stephanos, wondering, did as he was bade. “I am Antonius, son of Huard, and I tell thee truly that long years have passed since thy last battle, and wrought much change in Graymarie and in the world. Come with me now to the chambers of the Lady Carola de Danverius, Abbess of Our Lady of Liberty, if thou wouldst know the truth.”
Steve broke into a smile that was as bright and beautiful as the afternoon sun streaming in through the restaurant’s plate glass windows.  “Don’t be too sure of that.  Your armor could be right out of a Futurist – “
Normally Steve would have shrugged and refused, but not tonight.  He nodded, gripped Tony’s lower arm, and let the smaller man pull him to his feet.  “Thanks.  Guess I nodded off waiting to see if I could sneak in.”
Huard who took a wife from distant shores,
“I – no - don't let me get in your way,” he said, the words far higher pitched than he'd intended, and was back in the elevator and slamming the button for his floor before either man could say a word.
He dressed, combed his hair, and slipped on a pair of black wingtips that were only slightly stiff.  For a moment he considered wearing a hat, but he'd always hated them, even in the Army, so he left the snap brim he'd picked up a few months ago in its box.  St. Patrick's was less than fifteen minutes on foot.  He'd be fine.
Ioannes rode forth under the flag of truce, his heralds and the dread knight they called the Master of Men at his side, as the two sides faced each other across the fields of Kasserine. “King of Graymarie! I have come to treat with thee. Come out, or let the world know thee as a coward!”
So sing the bards:
“Tony.  Whatever you’re doing – “
The frond tickled as Tony draped it across Steve’s shoulder and chest.  “Sorry, but not yet.  You knew Capra, so yeah, you need to see Potterville before the Powers That Be let you go back to being depressed.”
“Then dessert’s on me.  I know this great little place about three blocks away.  Best cannoli in Midtown,” said Tony.  He came around their table and stopped directly in front of Steve.  His eyes were very, very blue.  “That is, if you can reschedule with Logan?”
“Lord, I beg thee to grant thy grace to my poor land! For though my machines are mighty, they alone cannot suffice to withstand the evil approaching swift from the East. We have but lately recovered from the deprivations of the Dragon, and my people despair that we have not the means to fight.
“I guess it’s St. Patrick's after all,” he said, and took an extra moment to steady himself before checking the closet for something he could wear to church.  At least he’d remembered to shower after his workout.
Hear now the roll of the Noble Nine,
” came an angry shout from across the dining room, and both Avengers automatically swiveled in place to see what was going on.
“Sure, that sounds great,” Tony blurted out, mentally wondering if there were any relatively private spaces in the long downward spiral of Frank Lloyd Wright’s last great building.  “You’ll have to explain it to me since I’m not an artist.”
“Fuck you, asshole,” said the kid.  He flipped Steve the bird, then hopped on his skateboard and ripped down a side street before Steve could react.  One of the women squealed, while another started talking about how rude and mean everyone in New York was, why couldn’t they be like people out in Blue Ball, next year they’d stay home and not waste their money.
Steve came awake with a jerk.  Tony, in a dark topcoat and a Russian-style hat that would have looked better on Natasha,  knelt beside him on the sidewalk.
Victory came to Graymarie in the end, thanks be to God! Stephanos himself vanquished the Master of Men with a single thrust from his lance, while Ginevra and her lady knights drove back the warrior women of the North. Antonius personally directed his siege engines and mechanicians against the foe, and mighty did they prove in battle. Ioannes did rage and swear at the loss of his knight and then deploy all matter of foul sorceries against Graymarie, but even his strongest efforts were as nothing against the clever work of the King of Adamant and the stout arm of the Knight of the Star.
Steve raised an eyebrow and gestured at the muscular, slow-moving waiter.  “The staff giving you a five minute rundown of every ingredient and where it was produced?  I’ve got an appointment later today, you know.”
The crowd had thinned out enough by the time he reached the great statue of Atlas on Fifth that he could actually see the doors to the cathedral across the street.  They were shut, of course, and if he concentrated he could just make out the roar of the great organ as the choir began processing down the center aisle.  The service would in English, not Latin, but if he closed his eyes he could see it so clearly, the singers in their white cassocks and purple robes, the bishops and priests and the Cardinal in their glittering vestments, candles and music and warmth and light –
Father Edwin, Antonius' own confessor, initially doubted the rumors, for he was a saintly and kindhearted man. All the same, he counseled that Obadiah should be kept under close watch, for such bitterness was not seemly in a man of God, and Antonius agreed that this should be done. For during the years of his estrangement from his royal sire, he had often found the way to his father's chamber barred by the cleric, and some of his companions in debauchery were themselves in the Bishop's service.
Would any of them care?
The plea in those dark, brilliant eyes was almost too much to bear.  Steve had to remember to breathe.  “I didn’t – I assumed – “
Steve cautiously laid his free hand on Tony’s upper arm, grip relaxing into a very slight caress at the other man’s smile.  His voice went husky as he leaned close enough to whisper, “Whatever you want, Shellhead.”
Which would be a really, really bad idea since the preceding ten (or twenty, but who was counting?) pages were full of drawings of various parts of Tony’s anatomy, including one that would have made it crystal clear that Steve was interested in a bit more than just muscle and drapery studies.
“For surely the Dragon will leave when it has sated its hunger, and then we can rebuild our land,” he said, the words falling honey-sweet from his lips. And so it was that rather than taking arms against the foe, many foolish, frightened townsfolk did list to obey and repaired thus to the church to lament and cry woe, woe! when they might have spent their time in preparation and defense.
“That’s all,” said Tony, as the world went dark around them -
or something else that was actually around prior to 1945, ‘kay?”
One-armed James and Natalia th’Red
“Gladly will I accept thy oath, my good Stephanos,” cried the noble king, and when oaths had been sworn and accepted he raised Stephanos with both his hands to kiss him on cheek and brow. “Go now to Graymarie with what men owe thee allegiance, and tell its defenders that I, Arthur, did send thee to its defense.”
Tony cocked his head as an equally flowing white robe swirled into place around Steve's body.  “Not quite as good a view, but now I can see why that art student at the Met last week wanted you to pose.”
“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” came JARVIS’ cultured tones, and Steve had to remind himself not to look at the ceiling.  “How may I assist you?”
Graymarie enjoyed half a decade's peace before evil once again threatened the land. For all things must change, as Our Lord has willed it be so until the Day of Judgment when He shall judge the quick and the dead, and so at Eastertide in the sixth year of Antonius’ reign word came to Graymarie of a threat from the East.
the portal until it was almost too late.  By the time Fury told his gun crews to start firing at least five or six more leviathans had come through, and guess where a couple of them headed?”
Steve bared his teeth as the pain lanced through his shoulder again.  “Like hell you didn’t!  You told  Clint I should have stayed in the ice when he was feeding his dog!  I was on my way to my room and I heard you, so don’t even think about lying!”
Also did Antonius return in secret to the crypt with the royal banner, which he draped over the casket of Stephanos, that none might know that its occupant once more walked among mortal men. If any asked, the King replied only that the dismissal of the demon that had worn the guise of Bishop Obadiah had cracked the crystal, and he wished to conceal the damage until the battle against Ioannes Caput Rufus had been won….
…and so Antonius, having earned his kingdom with blood and battle, did reign long years in peace. At his left hand were his dear companions Sir James and Lady Ginevra, the latter of whom in due time wed Felix Pugilisticus and produced a daughter hight Penelope, who was as beautiful as the stars themselves and as strong as any man. She was the true flower of the realm, and all loved her as she grew to womanhood and won her spurs in battle when danger came again, as it ever does.
So it was that Howard broke with long custom and took unto him a wife, Maria Carbonelli from far-off Padua, in hopes of getting an heir of the body since he could find none suitable in his court. Brilliant was she, the equal of any man in learning and curiosity, with the dark beauty of her native land and a kind heart that called to mind Good Queen Bets, consort of King Geoffrey of the Mace. Great was the land’s rejoicing when she conceived and grew heavy with child, and greater still when she was safely delivered of a healthy son, named Antonius for Queen Maria’s father, a scholar of renown.
So say the chroniclers:
“Never, by Our Lady of Liberty!” swore Antonius, and truly did the Bishop recoil at the name of the Mother of God. At this Lady Ginevra, making the Sign of the Cross against evil (for what true priest would show disgust at mention of the Blessed Virgin?), drew a potion of truthtelling from her girdle and threw it in Obadiah’s face.
Then spoke up one of his younger knights. This man, Stephanos, called the Knight of the Star for the device upon his shield, had but lately come to Camelot from Eboracum, yet had he won great renown fighting the captains of Greater Germany in service to the dread Emperor of Rome, Lucius Artorius, kin to Arthur himself. His hair was golden as ripe wheat in the summer sun, his eyes bluer than the sea, and overall so tall and well-knit was this noble knight that none handsomer nor stronger could be found throughout the realm. Generous was he to the poor, and kind to the ladies, and had he come to Arthur's lands but a few years earlier he would have been proclaimed the noblest and most courteous of all those who sat at the Table Round.
…and when the King returned to his people with the Dragon’s head, the people rejoiced greatly, for the Dragon had killed many folk of the countryside and the King and Queen besides. The elders declared that Antonius, young though he was, was fit to be King without a regent, and so he was crowned without delay despite the objections of the Bishop…
They stood inside a funeral home somewhere in the Midwest as a whole family – mother, father, little boy who couldn’t have been more than ten – was waked.  Steve blanched as he recognized the out of towners who’d driven straight into the attack, then blundered into an alley.  “These people –  I killed a Chitauri who was trying to get them.  No one else saw them?”
“Looks like it, and no, I don't know why your subconscious chose me to do the whole 'Clarence needs to get his wings' thing.”  Tony shrugged and slipped off his seat.  He was almost Steve's height here, and still glowing slightly.  “I also have no idea why you're naked, but hey, not going to question it.  Your dream quest thing, your nudity.”
The army of Graymarie let up a great shout at the sight of the man they knew only as a legend alive and well and prepared to fight once more in their defense. They shook their spears at his brave words and cried that they would follow Stephanos and Antonius, Captain and King, into the very jaws of death. Even the Master of Men quailed at this, for he and his chief had seen but little defiance on their way from Rus to Graymarie, and the words of freedom were new to his ears.
“Of course.”  JARVIS waited as the mechanism whirred to life and they began their descent.  “Should I inform Sir and the other Avengers that you are leaving the Tower?  Agent Barton is attempting to trim a Christmas tree, Agent Romanov and Ms. Potts are preparing to retire for the night, Dr. Banner and Sir are arguing about the Large Hadron Collider, and Prince Thor is conducting a video call with Dr. Foster.”
“Life - “  Steve stopped as he remembered Atlas' words:
Neither man spoke for a moment.  Then Steve said, a hair too quickly, “You know, I think I pencilled Logan in for the wrong day.  There’s an exhibit over at at the Guggenheim I was meaning to see, Italian Futurists, and I – I’d love company if you had the – “
Many was the night that the King would leave his bed and wander castle and church, working out plans and schemes for machines that might save the land. Those who saw him claimed he spoke often to himself, as if the very stones might answer, and those of his own household noted how wan and red eyed he grew as the enemy approached. Then yet more rumors spread that the King was unfit to rule, or had gone back to drink and loose company, and so the heart of the people failed even as it should have grown stouter.
“So much for - “
“You think that?  After seeing up close and personal what a couple of dictators did to Europe?  Really?” Tony demanded.  His eyes were hard, his voice harsh.  “Ever heard of a pyrrhic victory, Mr. Super Soldier?  That’s what we have if Fury doesn’t find you in time.  You’re the key, the heart and soul of the team – “
…and so it was that the people did acclaim Stephanos, mighty in battle and much of honor, to be the Captain of Graymarie, sent by Arthur to protect and guide them in his absence. And when Arthur fell in battle and was seen no more, the wise of the land did request that Stephanos remain as their guardian, though he might have returned to Rome’s service or repaired to his own steading….
So say the chroniclers:
“That’s because you don’t use oven mitts like a normal person,” said Clint in a surprisingly reasonable tone.  “See these?  Nice and insulated, only $5 at the dollar store so you can buy a set for every day of the week.”
“Yessir,” said the waiter.  He scribbled something down, shoved their menus under his arm, and stumped off toward the kitchen.  Steve waited until he was out of earshot to speak.
“No, no.”  The compassion in the stranger’s voice, the sudden sympathy in his wife’s eyes as she held out a slip of paper, was more than Steve could bear.  “I couldn’t.  You – you go with your family.  I’ll find somewhere else.”
When fell their noble Cap to duty.
“Uh huh.”  Even the way the man chewed was perfection, and oh, Tony was going to hate himself if he was reading this wrong.
“Speak the truth, false priest, and sap our strength no more!” spake the good Ginevra, and all those assembled took up the call.
…never had the prayers of a ruler of Graymarie been answered so swiftly and in such fashion, as God was pleased to work a mighty miracle to bring succor to the land. King Antonius was greatly surprised to see proof of the blessings of God made manifest in such a fashion….
“Capra?  You mean the guy with the Motion Picture Unit?” Steve brushed the frond aside, or started to.  It was oddly warm to the touch.  “He directed me in a couple of shorts, but  – “
“Probably slept wrong,” he murmured to himself as he walked down the hall to the elevator.  He’d moved into what everyone was calling “Avengers Tower” just before Thanksgiving, when he’d finally given up on trying to make the drab little apartment SHIELD had found for him feel like something other than a grim reminder of what he’d lost.  He wasn’t a big fan of Tony Stark’s taste in furniture, artwork, or window curtains, but at least everything in his suite was brand new, not second hand junk that the head shrinkers had decided was comforting solely because it was old.
There was a noticeable pause.  “I trust that did not upset you, Captain.  I am still not entirely familiar with the needs of anyone except Sir and Miss Potts.”
A wisp of steam rose from the tunnels underneath Atlas as the lights changed and the two men started across the street.  Neither was in range to smell the faint trace of ozone in the smoke, or see the tiny hint of a smile play about the great statue’s lips.
“Me?”  Steve watched as half a dozen airmen dumped the ruined plane off the flight deck into New York harbor.  “I spent my time on the ground.  You and Thor were the air support.  I didn’t – “
burger joint with great reviews on Yelp.”  Tony checked his phone, then held it out so Steve could read the starred review on a foodie blog.  If their old favorite
Alas! All things must end, and so did the years of Stephanos, the Captain of Graymarie. For one Arminius, a Switzer rumored to have clashed with Stephanos during his service to the Emperor Lucius Artorius, did envy Graymarie her good fortune and desire to seize her wealth for himself. He raised an army and sailed across the sea, thinking that peace had made Stephanos soft, and sought to land at the Isle of the Conies, one of the Five Blessed Isles, on a cold spring day before any defense could be mustered.
Another text notification appeared.  Steve deleted it, set his jaw, and entered
Who brought bright victory with his hand.
Steve laughed and reached for the door handle.  “In that case, after you, my dear Alphonse.”
The King then sent word to the nuns of Our Lady, and also their chaplain priests, to venture forth throughout the land to cleanse it of the harm Obadiah had done during his years of power. And so it was done.
Then did Stephanos, drawn by the nobility of Antonius’ countenance and his honest word, sheath his sword and set his shield upon his back. “That I will, for I have many questions for thee and thine.”
Thus endeth the tale of mighty Stephanos, Knight of the Star, and his sweet friend Antonius, King of Graymarie and Knight of Adamant. May all who read it rejoice in the knowledge that friendship and true hearts may overcome all obstacles, and that they who serve land and people with faithful intent are blessed of God and beloved by men.
fault, not yours or Clint’s or anyone else’s!  He brought the army, he attacked us!  Blaming either of you is crazy!”
“ - should have kept him out - ice - “
“As you wish,” Tony said, and waved the frond –
“That was Jan, not me, and it wasn’t turkey, it was seitan.”  Steve’s own burger looked as simple and straightforward as the man himself, with a nice char to the meat, perfectly melted cheese, and a slice of red, juicy tomato that Tony could practically taste across the table.  “How are the sweet potato fries?  They look awfully – big,” he finished, and was that actually a blush staining his cheeks?
Tickets?  Tourists?  Even during the war they hadn’t tried to keep soldiers from going to church, not when every time you went might be the last, and –
“Lucky doesn't  have fleas,” said Clint, joining him.  His t-shirt was rumpled and his hair stuck straight up in front.  “Five minutes and we'll have more pizza rolls.  You want?”
Here relate the chroniclers:
“That's Bruce on the ground,” said Tony.  His jaw twitched as the Rangers loaded an unconscious Dr. Banner onto a sleek black transport.  “Ross has wanted himself a super soldier for years and Brucie's the closest thing we had before you showed up.  Now he's got what he wanted most, never mind that without Bruce I was a dead man and the city was probably toast.”
Here the bards do return to their tale:
“May it be as thou hast said, my lady,” said Stephanos, and knelt for her blessing. He then tied back his hair, for it had grown long during his time in the crypt, and took up his shield. It had been covered with black cloth to conceal its shining star until the time was right, for Stellarius would be a knight without arms until it pleased the King to reveal his true identity. Sir James then conveyed him outside the capitol under cover of night, that they might enter the gates in the full light of day, for many noble warriors and men at arms were journeying to Graymarie to join the armies now that Ioannes and his men had drawn nigh.
“Well, sweet potatoes are pretty long,” said Tony after a pause, and yes, Steve was definitely a bit pinker than usual.   Maybe his crush wasn’t quite as hopeless as he’d always assumed?  “Want to try one?  They’re awfully good, especially with a little mustard right on the tip.”
Then Obadiah did utter a cry that cracked the very stones of the castle, and behold! a demon of Hell stood before the King! Then all understood that the estrangement between Huard and his Queen, and their deaths, and the drunkenness of Antonius’ youth, was all due to the fell interference of this accursed man. Father Edwin spoke the word of the anathema in a great and terrible voice, and Obadiah vanished as if he had never been.
“I’ll have a cheeseburger, lettuce and tomato, medium well, with provolone.  Regular fries,” Steve blurted out.  The Firehouse Burger sounded wonderful but messy, and the last thing he wanted was to drip chili sauce all over his lap.  “That turkey thing sounds perfect for you, Tony.”
Here the chroniclers say:
Such could not be said of Antonius and the army of Graymarie! For though they were fewer than the Red One’s force, every one of them wore armor forged according to the King’s designs to be harder, lighter, and stronger than the finest Nuremberg plate. Mighty trebuchets laden with stone hewed from the mountains stood arrayed beside cannon of cold iron against the foe, as well as companies of mechanicians and alchemists with their devices and tinctues that would cloud the mind or pierce armor of leather or cloth.
“Those were part of the weekly grocery order, which is bought and paid for with my ill-gotten gains,” said Tony.  There was a metallic
“Good,” Tony breathed.  Neither spoke for a long, long moment, even when the critic pulled out his phone and shouted that he was calling the police.  “Want to blow this Popsicle stand?”
“So?  What just happened?”  Tony, who’d appropriated two to-go boxes from a bewildered teenage girl who had been clearing the tables, stood up as Steve worked his way back through the gawkers to their table. “Who was that guy?”
“Damn.  I forgot we haven’t actually shown you
Steve drew in a shocked breath as a blast of cold wind swept the flight deck.  The runway was pockmarked from what looked like a series of massive explosions, the black surface half-melted in places.  A damage control party aimed a fire hose at the smoldering wreck of a quinjet, the smoke whirling about an ascending medevac copter with stretchers – or were they body bags? - strapped safely to its landing skis.  The serial number on the bridge was all but hidden by a blast mark from an energy weapon of some sort.  Maria Hill, half her face covered by bloody gauze, leaned heavily on a female medic’s shoulder as the two women picked their way toward a triage station.
“Uh huh,” said Tony after a few seconds.  He cocked his head again and held out the frond.  “I think you're supposed to grab this so I can whisk you off to learn what you're supposed to learn.  Still not sure what that is since you're, y'know, Captain America and the hope of the nation, but - “
“PTSD” they called it now, even though it was just another name for shell shock or battle fatigue.
“Steve.  We weren’t talking about you.  Clint’s dog had just knocked an ice cube tray and a package of those frozen fruit things Bruce likes off the island onto the floor, right into the the mutt’s water dish.  I was telling him he should have kept Lucky in his room.  Nothing more.”
She smiled and leaned back against him.  “Right in my purse, just like I do every year.  After the time your brother forgot and we had to go home – “
Tony frowned.  “You’re not wrong about what went down.  Why do you think I sent Thor over?  That story about Loki fooling Zeus into thinking he was a girl was the best distraction I’ve seen since the time Rhodey dropped a tank on a statue of some dictator in Madripoor.”
“We were talking about the dog, Steve, not you.  I swear.”  Tony placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders, carefully avoiding the sore spot.  “You’re the heart of the team and have been from the start, whether you know it or not.  Thor tries, he really does, and so does Nat, and me, and the others, but without you?  We’re five freelancers pretending to work together and failing pretty badly    You’re the difference whether you know it or not.”
“Young man?  Are you all right?” said the man in the chesterfield.  “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Steve closed his eyes.  He wanted to believe Tony so badly it hurt, but how?  “Half the time I don’t even know what you’re talking about.  Any of you.  I’m trying to keep up, but I just – I - “
Scarce had the disguised Stephanos arrived at court but Antonius set him to work drilling the army and setting the fortifications to right, for he swiftly learned of the new machines of siegecraft and devised ways to counter them. Rarely did the this noble knight smile as he went about his tasks, but soon the forces of Graymarie were as good as ever they had been, bold and keen and skilled in all the noble arts of war. Soon he pronounced them ready to face all comers, even after the King’s spymistress, Lily Charretiere, brought news of the foul weapons Ioannes Caput Rufus had devised to bring about Graymarie’s doom. For in addition to siege engines and great ballistas, Ioannes had drawn upon the dark arts to transform a peasant lad into a knight of tremendous strength and cruelty.
These words of Stephanos had been repeated by every ruler of Graymarie upon their coronation day, confirmed by solemn prayers and oaths before the high altar in Our Lady of Liberty. Antonius himself had spoken them scarce six years prior, and now they lay heavy in his heart as he took his place at the prie-dieu and readied himself for prayer.
Chronicler and Scribe
Antonius made his way down the rows of the dead, hoping to find some guidance from prayer among the bones those who had come before him. James and Natasha lay in their common grave, the stone worn smooth by long years; the simple slab of granite with seventy-six crosses marked William, first of his name; the great mace wielded by King Geoffrey laid upon his floor grave; the effigies of Sir Gabriel and Dame Margaret, each mailed and accoutered for battle. The nuns of Our Lady of Liberty kept perpetual vigil for them all, the rulers and heroes of Graymarie, and Antonius nodded briefly as he passed one sister and another as she knelt before each tomb.
…then did the Dragon of Ten Rings fall upon the land, and lay waste to many of the fields and forests. The people cried out for succor, and so King Huard, old though he was, set out with his Queen and many of his most senior knights and men at arms to end the fell creature’s rampage upon the land.
Steve shuddered.  Maybe he was a soldier now, but he was still an artist deep down.  “What’s next?  The Chrysler Building?  The Statue of Liberty?”
Two menus and your best table,
“Just give me the damn branch!” Steve snarled, and grabbed it near the tip.  The hard, glossy leaves shivered, the ozone smell of the tunnel spiked, and there was a sudden flash of darkness -
- at the great statue of Atlas.  The bronze eyes were open and fixed directly on him, while a faint, almost amused smile played about the sculpted lips.
“Excuse, ma’am.”  Steve gave the family his best “buy war bonds for America!” smile.  “Did I hear you say something about tickets?  To get into a church service?”
“Lucky’s my companion, not a pet, it says so right on that thing Bruce printed out from the Internet about animal rights –
He paused the longest at the image of his parents, Huard sternly holding an alembic in one hand and a sword in the other, Maria with her cherished volume of Miriam the Egyptian’s alchemical works open upon her breast. He dropped to his knees and said a prayer for their souls, then rose and made the Sign of the Cross before one parent, then the other. The Dragon of Ten Rings had taken them before their time, and as able as he had proved, always he would wonder if he had come to the throne too young and untried.
They lapsed into silence for a moment, and the respite from all the intense words and emotions made Tony realize how thoroughly exhausted he was, the way his whole body ached like he'd been fighting a supervillain in a badly damaged suit, even though the battle had been entirely internal. He let his head sink back into the pillows, allowing his heavy eyelids to close.
As the ceratopsian came into full view, Steve saw in the pale morning light that there were two men on his back, and he recognized both of them right away. He would've known them anywhere.
It was a terrible burden, and Steve hadn't really fully considered it from Tony's perspective. He could imagine wanting to do the same if he were in Tony's position; if he knew he was dangerous to other people, choosing to keep away from everyone, indefinitely, seemed like the safest solution. It couldn't possibly be the only one, though. Steve knew other people with powers that resembled Tony's. It wasn't beyond the realm of possibility that he could use them for good instead of chaos.
"You know that I'm a light sleeper, and that may have saved my life that night. Some hours later, when it was pitch-dark outside, I woke up to someone rustling at the entrance to my tent. 'Who's there?' I called out, and picked up my flashlight to look. The sight chilled the blood in my veins." Tony lowered his voice like someone telling a horror story, and Steve found himself holding his breath waiting to hear what would come next.
It was difficult not to sympathize with him. He spent all his time in the dank, ill-lit dungeon, after all, and although he was getting regular meals now, they barely seemed like enough. If Bucky occasionally tried to smuggle him more than what was the prisoners' usual fare, it was just because of basic human decency, he told himself. Not because he thought Stark deserved special treatment. Definitely not because he was starting to warm up to him.
? Tell me, what reasons have you given me to believe a single word you say?"
The flip phone sat on the coffee table in front of him, mocking him.
There was a shuffling sound in the opposite corner of the room, and Pearly-eye called out to Tony. "What's going on?"
"I do owe you one, though," Tony adds.
"Hence the need for helmets," Steve said.
It always sounded ridiculous, but most of the times, the imaginary Steve said yes. He might've said yes in reality, too. Maybe he would've been curious. Besides, he'd been handing out samples for all sorts of scientific experiments all his life.
He kept a very close eye on Tony while waiting for his answer, to see how he'd react. Tony did, in fact, grow more sober, his smile vanishing. "It was unpleasant, but I dealt with it. I'd rather not talk about it."
"If you happen to be, your friend Ed left you something. Are you?" the receptionist repeated, not handing over the glass yet.
He turns around to face the android again. "Look, Steve, I don't need your company for this. Just wait here. Make yourself at home."
Bucky greeted everyone with an easy smile and pulled up a chair next to Steve. "Cap. Are you sulking, or is that just the frame?"
Bucky really had made the right choice. It was a sobering thought that if he had waited until the morning, he might never have learned any of this.
When he turned back towards Steve, Tony put his hands on Steve's hips, ready to get rid of his pants. Steve stopped him, grabbing his wrists gently but firmly. "No, it's your turn next."
"Hm. I suppose you could join me for dinner, I have no company today and the chef always makes much more than I can eat on my own," she offered.
Tony was the first to move, but just enough to place a hand on Steve's knee, raise his head and press his forehead against Steve's other thigh. "That was nice," he murmured into it.
Jarvis sighed, clearly not eager about the prospect, but nevertheless, said, "I suppose I should, when Captain America asks."
"It doesn't mean I'm leaving the team. I'll still be an Avenger," Steve added, so he wouldn't give the wrong impression. "I'd just like to have a day job, too, same as the rest of you."
Steve tried to ask where they were going, which came out as a "where?" that sounded more like a groan.
There was a faint smell of smoke hanging in the air around them, and going by the movements of the car, Rhodey was running evasive maneuvers. Not the best setting for a potentially life-threatening procedure.
He'd never touched another man like this before; he'd wondered, sometimes, when he'd thought about Tony, back when he'd first guessed they might be soulmates, if it would feel awkward. It didn't. Probably, the matching was a part of that: Tony's skin was as familiar as his own under his fingertips.
He couldn't deny that he'd thought, over the past few days, that things would've been a lot simpler without those test results Tony had shared with him; if Steve's earlier belief that they weren't a match had been true. He'd also thought that maybe he could just ignore the whole thing, go on as if nothing had happened, pretend there was nothing special between them. Still, somewhere at the back of his mind, there'd always been that hopeful curiosity about things that could've been. Now, he'd missed his chance of ever finding out.
"Weird, like you said it would, but I think it's a good weird." Tony moved closer, properly into Steve's personal space, putting his hand behind his neck and pulling Steve's hands with it. "It doesn't feel quite real. Feels like I'm still in VR. I'm not on meds and nothing hurts. I'd forgotten you could feel so good while in frame space."
After last night, any self-delusion that Steve might've held about being able to stay impartial and neutral regarding Tony was gone. He liked Tony. He liked Tony a lot. It wasn't just that last night had been, hands-down, the most memorable sex Steve had had in his life, it was what he'd learned about Tony's character through that. Never mind that Tony was charismatic and shameless and adventurous, he was, first of all, considerate. He'd alway made sure Steve was enjoying things every step of the way.
Since the day Steve had first woken up on Dinotopia, in Tony's guest room, he had spent his time learning everything about the island and exploring its many wonders. It had been lovely: months of enjoying great company and exquisite views, and meeting some of the most extraordinary people he had encountered in his life, both human and dinosaur. It had been like the most amazing holiday, but now, he was back in action, and he had to admit that as much as he'd enjoyed those leisurely months, he had missed this. There was a particular excitement to being on a mission, with the high stakes and the tangible danger, that nothing else could surpass.
After they'd finished eating and just cuddled in bed for some time, they advanced to rather awkward fooling around in the bathtub. There really wasn't enough room in it for two, but at least the clean-up was easy afterwards.
Tony rested his hand on Steve's shoulder, his fingers dancing nervously against his skin. "There are things you don't know about me."
He ran a quick internet search to check, and it confirmed his interpretation: BLAM scores and e-values were used to evaluate the probability of a soulmate match. A BLAM score of 100 meant exactly identical sequences, and the e-value was, as far as he could tell, some kind of estimate of how reliable a particular score was. The smaller, the better. 1e-134 was the same as 10
"Eh, you know how it is. Lots of early prototypes end up forgotten in the junk pile. I haven't memorized all the serial numbers of every android we've ever built," Kamski says dismissively. It seems slightly evasive to Tony, like he knows something and doesn't want to reveal it, but that might just be wishful thinking. "We do have records of them all, so I should be able to look it up, though it might require some digging."
Steve shook his head. "Sorry, don't seem to be wired that way."
"So much. Thank you," Steve replied. "That was—that really was something else."
"You won't. I'm the one who made the first move, aren't I?" Steve places his hand behind Tony's neck, fingers playing with his hair.
"Hello?" Natasha called out, her voice raised to carry over the waves.
"Of course. Who wouldn't be," Steve admitted. "Still, I think I'd just like to take my chances instead."
Steve looked from the drones to Tony. "So. Why, exactly, do you need me as a bodyguard again?"
When he let go, Tony was giving him the most beautiful, radiant smile. "No one sees me like you do, Steve. I don't know what I've done to deserve you." He gave Steve's cheek a quick peck. "I used to think ending up on this island was the best thing that ever happened to me, but I was wrong. It's you."
"And yet, you always do your best to hide it," Steve insisted, squeezing Tony's fingers. "He's an awesome person, that Tony Stark from Marvels, the one whose life is a continuous adventure, whose heart is whole and who's never been afraid or uncertain of anything. I just like you better."
The dinosaurs, including the one carrying Tony and Bucky, who probably hadn't spotted Steve in the faint dawn light, continued their charge without slowing down, following the track leading towards the shore.
It wasn't Steve being lost that got to Tony so badly. It was Steve being lost alone in the cold.
His eyes still tightly closed, with a wordless groan of pleasure, Steve came. Iron Man held him as he did, the hand on his chest now just hugging him close, his face nuzzled against Steve's neck.
"I can come up with plenty of ways to get us in. We've still got missiles that can break the windows. I could fix my armor and fly up there. Might even be able to smuggle Jarvis into the elevator controls and hitch a ride," Rhodey said. "The problem's getting Tony out. I think the first thing Stane will do if he feels threatened will be to kill him and call in SHIELD, in that order."
"Shut up, scaly scum," Rumlow snarled in the Northerners' version of the lingua franca, then turned towards his young accomplice and, to Tony's astonishment, switched to flawless American English. "See, James? You just need to keep them in their place. It's not looking so scary now."
The offer was entirely unofficial, and simple enough to understand without a law degree: if Tony and his friends stayed quiet about the whole affair, SHIELD would not pursue any actions against any of them for what they'd done to take down Stane. Tony could go on with his life, back at the helm of his company, and Steve would stay free, pardoned in spite of his new offenses.
"I knew he was trouble from the moment I saw him," Obie says to Tony, sitting down next to him on the couch. "I know you've always wanted to do the right thing, Tony. He just got you confused about what that is. I tried to be patient and waited for you to come to your senses, but I think we're past that now. I can't wait forever."
"Right, where are my manners? Of course you'd not recognize me like this," the man said, wiped his sooty hand on the remains of his shirt, started to offer it to Steve, then seemed to realize it was still filthy, and pulled it back. "Better not, I guess. Tony Stark. I believe we've met."
He hated giving up, but he had to admit defeat for this round. Frustrated beyond words, he took the elevators up again and spent the next few hours in the gym, trying to work it out of his system.
Steve knew how many adventures Tony had seen in his life before this island, and he had faith in Tony's ability to make it, no matter what challenges he faced. He'd hold on to that.
Rhodey's posture relaxes, but his frown stays on. "Since when? I know your stance on androids."
"She likes Happy," Tony corrected him. "She tolerates me. On most days."
"Fine," Steve said. He had no need to turn this into an argument. Instead, he headed out of the room to see if the bathroom was free.
"Mr. Kamski sent me to you," Steve repeats, still standing up, hands behind his back so that his shoulders look even wider and his waist even narrower.
Hammer had already turned towards Steve, his smile growing wider. "And this must be the famous Captain Rogers! Or should I say, infamous, rather?"
"Me? Caught?" Tony exclaims incredulously. "I just need more eyes in the sky. It's going to be fine. Let's see..."
"You are angry with me, though," Tony said, his shoulders slumping even more. "Look, the curfew will be over in an hour. If you want to go, the door's that way." He motioned towards the far end of the room. "There's a closet with some clothes in the bedroom. Might take some trial and error, but I'm sure there's something there that'll fit you."
"Thank you, Captain. I appreciate that," Jan said, with a grateful smile.
Steve left his shield hidden behind the barrels and plunged headfirst into the sea where he'd seen Maya go under.
The cryo storage chamber did resemble a mausoleum, even if its occupants weren't actually dead. The difference between the quiet, windowless room and the corridor they stepped into was striking: the glass-walled walkways of SHIELD headquarters were bathed in rosy-hued sunset light, and there were plenty of people bustling about. The criminal masterminds of the Solar System didn't care for office hours, so neither did SHIELD.
Steve shakes his head and avoids Tony's eyes. "I shouldn't be like this. I was meant to be the perfect soldier, but I'm broken. You know who they based my design on? Why they called me Steve?"
Steve carefully stowed the piece of paper in one of his belt pouches. He'd need to ask Tony what it meant, and see if it might refresh his memory.
"There, good as new," he said. "I don't think it's too serious, but if you start feeling nauseous or get a bad headache, let us know."
It was as if the temperature in the room had suddenly dropped a few degrees, a tangible tension hanging in the air, and Steve had no idea why.
This frame wasn't quite as exaggerated in the size department as the synthetic Steve had died in, but was definitely still on the large end of the spectrum. That probably made sense, if it had been grown following some standard template at this overly luxurious clinic—those billionaires would want to be impressive—but that was absolutely not what he should be thinking about right now.
When Steve let go, he was frowning at Bucky. "What happened to your arm?" he asked, and took hold of Bucky's metal hand, pulling back his sleeve to reveal more of the prosthetic.
"James," Bucky said. Not that he was particularly worried about sharing details of himself, but he was wary, since he didn't know where he was or who these people were. But before he started asking those questions, there was one that was even more important. "Did you find my friend?"
Bruce had been talking to him for the past half a minute, but Tony hadn't heard a word of it. He stood up and started to pace, too excited by his eureka-moment to stay still. Bruce fell quiet, peering at him curiously.
Steve could fill in the rest. "And that's why the world has gone to hell in a handbasket." That was why so many things seemed so wrong about the laws and the organization overseeing them, and explained the emptiness and ever growing misery he’d glimpsed on the streets. He felt so angry he could barely breathe, fingers clenching around the plastic chair until it bent. "This can't go on. Someone has to do something."
Steve let the drones lead him to the elevator. They followed him inside, as well. As the doors closed behind them, Steve found himself suffocating on the feeling of being utterly trapped, all too familiar from his earlier stay at the Tower. For all that he was entirely committed to his plan and knew exactly what he needed to do, he couldn't help the physical reaction, the breath catching at his throat, the way his heart speeded up.
As far as Steve knew, they didn't have Tony's DNA lying around, and this definitely wasn't a matter of life and death. He would just have to take Tony's word for it.
"If James shows up again, I'll try to grab the keys from him and throw them to you," he tried again. "I don't know if I'll manage, but I promise to do my best."
"Well, you were right about that," Tony said, his voice bitter. "I'm not safe to be around. Not safe at all."
"Nothing so far, but she's probably with Stane. He should be awake in the new clone by now, but he'll need time to catch up," Steve said. "Do you have any news?"
"You read the paper, right?" Pepper checked. "They're theorizing that to catch the soulmate sequences, you'll need to do high-coverage whole-genome sequencing. That's not cheap. We've been thinking about new directions for the company."
Natasha pulled back her hand and crossed her arms, clearly uncomfortable with the conversation. "I probably do," she said.
Steve had to admit that Tony was half right. The quinjet was partly buried in sand and almost entirely non-functional, including the communications array. With a quick glance towards the cockpit, he could see that Natasha and Clint had opened several panels, trying to work on the computers. Unfortunately, Steve knew their chances of repairing any of the damage within a reasonable timespan without Tony’s help were low.
It took every bit of restraint Steve could find not to flinch at Stane's touch. He spent the walk across the living room focusing intensely on every detail around him, not allowing himself to think. He was afraid that if he let go, his body would betray him, the feeling of being trapped and the fear of pain to come overwhelming him. He stared at the floor, the fine marbled texture of its surface; at the couches they passed, the fabric that might be genuine leather; at the smooth gray walls and an unfamiliar piece of abstract holographic art floating next to one of them.
After a brief pause, Tony started again, and Steve focused as hard as he'd ever focused on anything on interpreting that signal and not missing a single pull of the thread.
"Sure," Steve said, and followed his lead to take a seat next to the stunning view.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm okay," Steve replied, on reflex, even though he was well aware that he wasn't. He took the hand Rhodey was offering and got up, keeping his eyes away from the man who might very well be Tony Stark.
He wasn't going to protest against a rescue, even if it was by a wholly unexpected party. Cautiously, he placed his bare feet on the floor and pushed himself off the chair, but his legs wouldn't hold his weight. He ended up on his hands and knees, the room spinning around him, his headache spiking again. He squeezed his eyes closed and breathed through his nose, trying to keep the nausea at bay.
If he'd have to guess, he'd say Tony must've suspected this for a long time, maybe from the day they'd first met. It'd explain why he'd always been so awkward around Steve, always on the defensive, hiding behind either actual distance or biting wit, never letting him close. He'd realized they were soulmates, and he hadn't wanted that. Maybe he'd even hoped Steve wouldn't realize it.
"I know," Steve says, expression still indifferent. "It makes sense. They are more durable than humans. And expendable."
"Then I can't let you out," James said, his jaw set.
At least they had a mutual understanding about that.
It was great, except for one detail. "But Stane would go free," Steve said.
"If there's anything at all I can do to help, I will, ma'am," Steve promised. He wanted to ask her if she knew what was going on, but couldn't come up with a tactful way to do that—for all he knew, it might be her home that was on fire.
There's a reason why it's Elijah Kamski and not Tony Stark who rules the android market, and why there are no humanoid robots in Stark Industries' portfolio. Tony's actively steered the company away from them. It's not that he doesn't like androids; more like the opposite. He's always been very fond of the machine minds around him. He considers JARVIS a friend, and his bots are as dear to him as pets would be to someone else. The thought of creating AIs as sophisticated as JARVIS and putting them in bodies that are realistic enough to fool you into thinking that they're human, and then selling them as a commodity—he doesn't think that's right.
"God, Steve, I was such an idiot. It took me forever to realize who he was. What kind of a nickname is "Bucky" for someone called James, anyway?" Tony asked.
Luckily, she didn't need any encouragement; realizing that Captain America was standing right there, willing to listen to her woes, seemed to be enough to open the floodgates. "I should've called the police the first thing when I heard those noises from upstairs! If only I'd known it'd lead to this—the thing is, the tenant there hadn't been around for over a month, and then suddenly there's all this shouting and thrashing around, and the next thing I know, the fire alarm is going off! I really hope it won't spread to my home!"
He had thought he would be forever pining in secret, but in this quiet, hazy morning, he'd woken up with a spark of hope glimmering inside his damaged heart.
He might've been able to keep his calm and stay reasonable if not for the fact that he's spent all night envisioning a completely different course of events. Now, he feels like a naive idiot. He's angry at Tony, and he's also angry at himself, for letting himself hope that something good could come out of this mess.
He's forgotten the big picture, too enmeshed in his own little drama with the android by his side. He remembers Obie's jab about him being busy playing house with his plastic pal.
Focusing on the view again gets him no closer to figuring out his geographic location. He's convinced he's somewhere high up in the north, going by how cool the weather is for late June and the complete lack of trees. Russia seems like a good guess.
He'd thought he was making progress, building on his previous army skills and putting his new, sturdy metal arm to good use, but being invited to talk to the Mayor somehow made him worry he hadn't kept up to the standards expected of him.
"Yes. She's fine, and she's safe," Steve reassured him.
"SR100," Steve replies, holding his head a little higher. "I'm a prototype. Only three were ever made. The other two are no longer functional."
As much as Steve knew Bucky was only a few years younger than him and had seen as much of the horrors of war as he had, it was difficult to stop thinking of him like his kid brother. Bucky has stopped wearing his costume since, and looked like any young man just shy of turning twenty. He could certainly take care of himself, better than most people, but knowing that didn't dampen Steve's protective streak at all.
"You're not?" Steve says. The fragile hopefulness in his voice is heartbreaking.
"That's really not necessary," Tony said, waving a dismissive hand in the air. It would've been more effective if he hadn't looked like he'd been through the wringer.
"Your lady friend ain't here," said one of them, a man dressed in a well tailored suit and a fedora.
There was a brief pause before Tony replied, "I was expecting as much. Big ugly building, not at all your style. I'm glad you've got your career plan all sorted out."
Tony reached out to take hold of Steve's forearm in turn. "No, it's okay. Really. All I want to say is, I won't hold a grudge if you won't."
"Well, you're not the only one. Director Phillips is aware of this, too, and he doesn't like it, either. This puts us in a difficult position. We can't change what's happening above us, and if we start openly disobeying these orders, we could end up being replaced, too," Peggy explained, sounding apologetic.
"What, exactly, did you tell him?" Steve asked.
"This one's inside the NYPD," Steve said.
"I think so," Steve replied. At least that was one thing he was fairly certain of. "Too many similarities for it to be a coincidence. Do you know if there were other victims beside this one?" he asked, hoping the answer would be "no".
Obie's been behind it all from the start.
"If you don't want me here—" Steve begins, but Tony doesn't wait for him to finish the sentence.
Tony started bobbing his head back and forth, and Steve held on to his hair, careful not to pull too hard. He knew his strength, and he didn't want to hurt Tony, either. Every now and then, Tony stopped to lick and suck at the tip of Steve's cock, creating a contrast between the cooler air on the shaft that he wasn't touching and that point of heat at the tip.
"Of course," Kamski says, relaxing into his chair. "I was happy to hear that you made it back safely."
Tony decided to risk another try, opened his eyes, and leaned slowly towards the table, where the screen had lit up with the assorted files he'd asked for: several chains of emails with the gene therapy R&D people, a few plain text ones with DNA sequences, and the preliminary, proof of concept test results. That should be all he needed. It'd just be a matter of turning the plans into reality. Back when he'd been researching this, the people he'd talked to had assured him the wetlab work would be simple to implement. All they needed was a target sequence, and as of last night, he had one.
. That was astronomically small.
Tony hadn't seen a single firearm in the years since he'd ended up here. It was a shocking reminder of the past, even if these were a haphazard collection of different vintages, from something that looked like a modernized take on a musket to a rifle suitable for big-game hunting. That could certainly hurt a dinosaur. The thought that someone would want to harm the gentle beasts was nauseating; aside from the wilder predators who roamed this jungle, the dinosaurs wouldn't harm a fly.
