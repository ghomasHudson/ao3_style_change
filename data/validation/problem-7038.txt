“What?” Tony snapped, glaring through his black eye at Clint as the elevator came to a stop on Tony’s floor.  The doors opened, but neither of them moved to get out.  “You spew the biggest sacks of bullshit around here, and yet you can’t take it?  Maybe I don’t want to fucking tell you, alright?  Maybe it’s fucking private?  Jesus Christ.”
Before he could regain conscious control of his body, his arm had swung out, knocking the man out cold.
Tony sleeps soundly throughout the night, and awakens to find Steve slumped awkwardly in the chair, sound asleep.
Steve nodded.  It’s not like he could be mad at the guy for it; hell, in some twisted way, it made it better.  Two liars in some odd relationship that was never meant to be.  Not that he dwelled on that last part for too long, because really, it hurt enough.
“Ah, is Tony sleeping on rice and booze again?  It’s not even Tuesday!” Clint came rounding the corner, peering into the pantry with a wild smirk.  Steve just looked bemused.
One big, huge, semi destroyed tower all to himself.  And Pepper.  Until Pepper left.  For Malibu, of course.  On business.  Yeah, definitely.  The bachelor life was what he craved, of course.  Random fuckings, leaving his underwear strewn across his living room, alternating between pizza and chinese food every night.  It was great, really.  It was how it’d always been, after he’d left for MIT.  Well, in MIT he had Rhodey, but that didn’t count, not really.
“And you must be Sebastian,” Steve replied in turn, but he wasn’t blistering with rage, as Tony thought he might, at being played, at-
Once there, they spotted Uncle Ben waiting by the gait, a small smile curled across his face.  “Thanks so much, I’d do it myself, y’know, but my back won’t stand for it.”
“Would it honestly kill you to understand, for just a second, that I, that we, were worried about you, Tony?  Would it kill you to see that we’re just trying to help, trying to figure out what’s going on?  Please, Tony.  Just try.”
Steve began shrugging into his clothes, and Bucky moved towards the other side of their small, shared bedroom to do the same.  They were worn out and threadbare, but to his dismay, Steve hadn’t grown in the past 3 years or so, which gave him no real reason to waste his resources to make new ones.
His fake name was called and he stepped into the ring, and the muscular man’s face twisted up with high, mocking laughter.  His breath was thick with the stench of tobacco and ale, looking absolutely smitten with Tony and his comparably tiny stature.
Steve had never believed people when they told him the line between love and hate was wire thin.  Not until now.
At seventeen, Tony’s parents die.  It’s Peggy who picks him up at MIT to bring him home, and to the funeral.
He failed.  He fucking failed.  He sputtered out a laugh at the irony of it, even as the nurses who had entered right after his team began to flutter around him, measuring this that and the other and god, he was so tired and aching and nothing had changed except the tube in his arm and the fact that his team was staring at him with wide, concerned eyes.
He’d wake up in cold sweat once every few weeks; less often than that, he’d wake up screaming bloody murder.
Tony paused, but only for a moment, before he turned toward the doors.  “Are you coming or not?”  He called over his shoulder.
And Steve left and god did it hurt, did it ache, but it was for the better it really was because he was no good for Steve, no good for anyone, no good for Pepper, no good for himself.
Groaning, he swung his feet over the bed, snatching his discarded clothes from the floor as he dug around for his cell phone to check the time.
to do with anything any of you did, okay?  It was all me, one hundred percent.  So don’t change your behavior, just because you’ve discovered my dirty little secret.”
“Son of Stark has returned!” Thor boomed, grinning as Tony plopped himself into a seat at the dining table.  Tony rolled his eyes, as Clint came over to punch his bicep, carefully avoiding his injured shoulder.
Peggy is busy, away on work more than she was home, and she really feels that it was the right decision.  Tony is four now, already famous for building his own circuit board.
Tony didn’t notice the doors of the lab swing open, and he didn’t hear Natasha swear when she saw him, a withering mass strewn across the floor of his workshop, and he barely noticed when she snatched the gun out of his hand, throwing it across the room as she cradled him within her arms.
that most of Tony’s jokes had no malice–about the ice, about him being old, about him being out of his own time–he was never completely sure.
Slowly, Tony turned around, and found himself walking into Steve’s outstretched arms.  Because this, this was okay.  This was wonderful.  And he wanted this, all of this, without the dark, murky words crawling within his brain weighing him down.
So when Tony found himself plastered against a wall with Steve’s soft, sweet lips against his own, his big strong hands resting on his hips, Tony most definitely
Steve seemed to process that for a moment, and Tony could practically hear his brain screaming in thought.  It was agonizing.
The man gestured to himself, cocking his head slightly.  “As you can see, I’m fit as a fiddle.  I admit perhaps I should’ve had JARVIS clarify that, but it was minor detail.”
It feels like history is repeating itself, with how desperate Steve is to find a cure, the lengths he’s willing to go, and doesn’t that feel like an iron punch to the fucking gut.
“Tony, why do you keep doing this?  You, of all people, should’ve known to scan the damned thing, it was mechanical after all.”
?  My friend told me it was good,” Steve piped up, and Tony eyed him because really, Steve just usually went along with whatever because Steve was Steve and he was like that.
Tony fully expected Clint to snap back at him, but the other man merely slumped his shoulders, sighing again.  “Tony, we’re just worried about….about you.  Steve especially, he keeps saying--”
The team was slowly realizing that they could be their normal selves around him, that they didn’t need to give him tentative looks after every wry joke, after every time they went to pick a movie, after every time they went to order takeout.  And it was good.  It really was.  It definitely was.
“What does it matter?” Tony snapped, now glaring at the other man.  Garner looked as calm as ever, fingers entwined with one another, resting on the desk.  Tony scoffed, sinking lower into his chair.  “If he doesn’t answer then I’ll deal with it.”
The smile that crawled across Tony’s face was achingly brittle and sharp to a point and oh god did it
They’d made their truce, sure, but Tony could still be an arrogant asshole, could still get on every last one of Steve’s nerves and tear them apart twice over.  And while it
Throwing his bag across the room, Steve began to shake Bucky, in a somewhat desperate attempt to wake his friend
“Yes, he will mind and you know it,” Tony cut in, burying himself into Steve’s chest as Steve cradled him closer, both of them leaning against the doorway of Tony’s bedroom.  “Not that I mind Fury being pissed of, because who fucking cares, right?”
She raised a brow at them, unimpressed.  “Doombots invading Time Square urgent?  Or….” She gave a sidelong look at the folder Steve was holding, and he was about to question her, to see if
“Better than being drunk, right?” He was slurring, a smile managing to reach his lips.  Steve, however, didn’t look amused.
He’s not not crying, not screaming, not shouting.  No, he’s just...staring.  In shock.  In disbelief.  His head too full of it’s own noise for him to actually make any.  He doesn't dare glance at Natasha, because he already knows what she’s thinking.  That this is forgiveness.  That this is Tony’s way of moving on, moving forward.
He spun around, the hands on his shoulder falling in mild shock.  “For once?  I’ve let you in, I’ve let you in so many times, so many more than I ever meant to, than I ever should’ve--”
After minutes, hours, whatever, he knew Steve was still there and he just couldn’t, he couldn’t, he was so tired, so so so tired.
“I’m not done yet,” she cut him off, but her tone was not unkind.  “That’s what they told me, but I know it’s not true, and you do too.  But it did hold some value.  What makes us the weakest, is dependence.”
This time, it was Steve who answered, his voice as stiff as his limbs.  “Giant robot spiders.  Who can shoot electricity, I might add, that were able to short circuit your suit, and if you’d be cautious enough to scan the things you would've realized that before you went charging in.
Sure it did.  Whatever.  It mattered to Pepper, it mattered to Rhodey.  Probably.  They’d probably be sad if he died.  Or something.  Pepper would, he knew Pepper would.  The rest of them?  Well, sometimes, it was really hard to tell.
He tries to regain himself, turns toward the Natasha, then to the box, then back to Natasha.  “No...no you can stay.  I’m sure it’s not…”
Steve looked at him, a look filled with emotions Tony couldn’t even begin to decipher in the state he was in.  After a moment, Steve nodded, walking across the grand room to pull up a chair to the side of the bed.
It was still dark out, the sky an inky black across the New York skyline.  So that was good.  Probably.  Not like he cared.  Obviously.
His name was called and a body slammed down onto him, knocking the sweet, sweet air from his lungs, but he didn’t need it, not really.  His body was being crushed with 250 pounds of of dirty, not-Steve muscle and Tony was smiling, smiling as his spit blood out from between his teeth, sputtering out what had gathered upon his lips.
“Ben’s waiting for the two of you up at the ranch!” Aunt May called as he and Bucky trotted past.  Steve nodded in affirmative, guiding his horse up the small hill leading towards the enclosure.
“Audrey, so sad to hear about your breakup with Mags.  Though I do happen to know a certain CEO who swings both ways, if you know what I mean….”
But there was this thing.  And despite his best efforts to shove it back into the bottom of his skull, it bothered Steve.  Really, really bothered him.
Perhaps he should talk to Wanda.  Perhaps she would understand, considering what happened between her and Vision.
“Well, it’s not the craziest thing you’ve--” Clint cut himself off, his eyes falling onto an open box at his feet.  “Oh my god.  Oh my
Park Street.  It was nothing special, it wasn’t South Station or anything.  But MIT was on the Red Line, and whenever he needed to get on the Green, Park Street it was.  Not that he really had anywhere to go all that often while at school, but Rhodey had this thing for the pizza bagels at Faneuil Hall--not that Tony minded of course, because c’mon,
He’d thought that Steve would at least have the courtesy to announce his presence, not just waltz in.
After what felt like hours Steve pulled back, staring down at him with sad, sad eyes.  “Let’s go, I can yell at you in the morning, but you can explain yourself when we get back to the tower.”  Smiling slightly, Steve handed Tony a helmet.  With shaky hands, he took it, throwing it atop his head.  Steve turned, throwing himself onto the bike as Tony paused, furrowing his brow.
Good.  He didn’t have anything to say to her, drunk or not.  Drunk at eight AM, no less.  But who cared, who fucking
She offered him a small smile, cocking her head slightly.  “You need to get it all out in the open, Steve, really.  It’s for the better, no matter what happens.”
He didn’t know what to expect when Tony had dragged him into one of his grossly expensive cars and began driving them out of the city, but being driven to a small cemetery upstate didn’t even crack his top ten.
Tony snorted, shooting a raised brow towards Clint’s, but the man just rolled his eyes.  “You made us suffer through Wayne’s World, you have no right to judge.”
“Pepper can handle it, she’d done it before and she’ll do it again, I’ll buy her a new dress, I’ll buy her fifty dresses.  It’s not a big deal, Cappy, I don’t know why you’re so worked up about it.  This isn’t the worst thing I’ve done,
He’d wanted to stay in the lab until, well, next month really, but Bruce was cooking duck that night and Tony knew that Bruce’s duck was not to be missed.
“God, you stupid asshole,” the blonde muttered, voice wavering.  “You turned your damn phone off, you didn’t answer, you didn’t tell anyone where you were going, you know that, right?  I was….we were
He could use Pepper here right now.  Pepper would know what to do.  Pepper would know why Steve was being so nice, so unnecessarily and incredibly
So while the others tried to take the damned thing down, Tony flew to the screeching train and managed to “catch” the damn thing before it hit the ground.
Peggy takes in a sharp breath, fists shaking at her sides.  “Is that all this is about to you?  You and your goddamn image?  Your fucking company?”
Moving past Natasha, he nearly runs down the hallway to his room, thoughts rushing through him at a dizzying pace.
So, no, Steve hasn’t heard from Tony, but Natasha did bring him his shield back after the first month.  Just said that Tony knew it would be better with Steve.
Exhaustion crashed over him, suddenly and all at once, and he’d barely managed to make it to his bed when sleep took him, collapsing onto his mattress with a muffled
By the time he made it to the common room, Clint was about to show the damn thing to Steve, and Tony being the impulsive man he was, managed to tackle the archer to the ground.
“Well,” Tony grinned, patting Steve on the back, “I suppose that’s enough uh, team bonding for one day, whaddya say?”
Breathing staggered, he pressed his back against the cool, smooth wall and sank down, his knees finally giving out after hoisting him up for decades, decades of sharp, sharp pain, sharper than the metal in his chest or a hand tugging at his wrist, too harsh and too unkind from a father to his son, his child,
Well, a word from Tony himself.  Thanks to Natasha, he knows what Tony’s been up too.  Knows that he’s helping out that Parker kid, knows that he’s nearly perfected his assisted legs for Rhodes, and now knows that he’s helping fund and build a hospital in Lagos and equipping it with the latest Stark medical tech.  To make up for a mistake that wasn’t his.
“You weren’t the party this weekend were you?”  The man’s grin was absolutely shit eating now, curling mischievously at the corners as his eyes shone impossibly brighter.  “I’d say I wouldn’t forget a face like that, but really, I think it’s those arms that I wouldn’t forget.  What was it?  Football, wrestling?  Maybe baseball?”
After shoving a handful of Benjamins into the bouncer’s hand, with a quickly muttered “I was never here,” he made his way swiftly down the stairs and through the clunky door.
“Yeah,” Steve said, looking like he was fighting to contain a hysteric bout of laughter.  And hell, maybe he was.  The situation was so corny and ridiculous and stupid and maybe.
Steve ignored his best friend, choosing instead to throw his duffle over the shoulder, snagging his bus ticket from his desk.  “Well, this has been
“Yep, well about some things.  Others?  Not so much.  For example, counting backwards from ten is pointless and stupid.  Got anything else?”
get along with the others–Bruce was easy to talk to when he opened up, Clint was more frat boy than professional when it came down to it, and he could trade war stories for espionage experiences with both him and Natasha.
But really, he was the reason Tony was really, really fucked up.  Obviously.  Or that’s what he told himself.
Rhodey eyed the contents in his hands, sighing as he moved to let Steve in.  “Tones, you got a visitor.”
He could’ve called Thor in to help, but he could still hear the mechanical cries of the machine monster in the distance, and knew that this was something he had to do alone.
“Uh,” Steve fumbled, looking more anxious than embarrassed, which was odd, really.  “I don’t know if we’re dating but...her name is Se-Sabrina,” he finished, nodding lamely.
If the public knew that the king of Wakanda was housing multiple fugitives, Steve is also sure the public’s reaction to T’Challa’s donations would be a bit different.
In which Tony nodded, scratching his goatee as he turned up the volume on the latest episode of Game of Thrones.  Tony, of course, was smirking to himself because at that moment in time, he believed that he still had Steve convinced that the Stark family on the show were his long gone relatives.  At the same time of course, Steve was smirking to himself because he did, in fact, know the show was completely fiction.
He sighed, hunching away towards his desk where he slid into his chair, letting his head fall to the table.
He sighed.  In theory, it wasn’t a huge deal; it’s not like he needed to find something to wear, or needed to clear his schedule or whatever.  It’s just.
?” Natasha suggested, smirking slightly as Bruce sent her daggers with his eyes.  The Other Guy wasn’t really a fan of musicals, as they’d learned too little too late.
It’s seconds, minutes, hours later when Steve comes back to himself, is able to breathe, breathe without an ache in his chest, without fire in his lungs.  Natasha is still there, staring at the...at the arm,
It was ridiculous, but Tony didn’t care.  He didn’t care if it was grossly tiring, if it drained him more than a fight with an onslaught of Doom Bots did these days (though that could be a fault on Doom’s fault though, because seriously?  Did he
“No!  No, I just…”  Steve’s voice sounded off; distant, somehow.  There was a pause, and Tony could almost visualize the other man shaking off whatever had come over him.
As horribly lame as the tweet was, it did catch Tony’s attention, and so he click on the Demetrios guy and.
He did leave Steve with a bit of a briefing on her (not a formal SHIELD file, as he’d done with the rest of the Avengers), mentioning her brother and niece.  And that was nice, that was good.  She was glad she had them, and she was glad she was able to move on past his death, to continue on with her own life.
“It was football, back in high school,” Steve swallowed, hoping his face wasn’t as red as it felt.  He’d received many lewd compliments in the past and usually he could deal with if fine, but something about the man’s snarky lips and blazing eyes made Steve feel like a scrawny high school freshman all over again.
Instead he rushed through the misty woods, dodging vines and tree branches, hopping over rocks and through allies and caves until finally they reached a dead end, Steve finding himself in a circular clearing, tall pines and billowing oaks towering over him, the sunlight seeping through the cracks in the natural canopy.
Ahead of him, the cloaked man let out a harsh cackle as he rammed straight through the gate, leaving an unharmed horse and shattered wood in their wake.
“....No,” Tony conceded, slumping further down in his chair.  The daddy issues, the drinking, the sex. They all wrapped around each other, strangling him into his current mindset.  His current, depressed, mindset.
Tony, you tried to kill yourself!  After we….after all this shit that you’ve done, and, god, do not try and tell me it was an accident because I know it wasn’t and thank god for JARVIS, if not for him, you’d be, you….you’d be….”
There was a reason Steve shouldn’t be doing this, shouldn’t be flirting so obnoxiously to some Italian stranger he’d just met on Twitter.  On his
“Is that why Pepper dumped you, Tony?  Too loose for her taste, what with all those threesomes you’ve been having over the years?  Aren’t you a bit old for that, Tony?  Come now.”
Steve, alright?  I was fucking dying and so what if I got drunk and destroyed half of my Malibu estate, and so what if I let my best friend take my suit and hand it over to the-”
made the team suffer through his own fair share of horrible movies, so whatever it was, it wasn’t unjust.
Slowly, he grabbed the pants and the contents he’d found inside, getting to his feet and walking out the door.  Slowly, he knocked on door 211, and was greeted by his DA.
There was a stiff pause, but Tony refused to look back over towards the doctor.  “Some patients require different tactics.  I feel like you need a dose of reality.”
Or well, he hoped it was his last love, because no one else deserved that pain, deserved that torment of being attached to Tony Fucking Stark.
Tony isn’t lying awake at night, wondering what Steve is up to.  He’s not fretting over where Steve is.  He’s not shuddering into his pillow, trying to remember how to breathe with memories that hang over him.
So when Steve went down to Tony’s lab for the first time, and saw what he had on his desk, he might have acted a bit….rash.
It was just the two of them in the backseat, Natasha and Coulson, who was driving, muttering quietly in the front.  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony, shifting them so Tony’s head was tucked into the crook of his neck.
Before Steve could utter something out of his slacked jaw, Tony scrambled off of his chair and out of his workshop before he could make an even bigger fool of himself, which he knew all too well was very possible.
He shook his head, a sad little smile playing at his lips.  “Do you really think I give a shit about your money, Tony?  Really?  Tony, if you’re gone, I’m going to be miserable.  Because I’m your
“Yes, JARVIS?  A call to assemble?”  Normally the klaxon would’ve been sounded, but he couldn’t imagine what other reason JARVIS had to reach out to him.
and his heart was doing this funny thing, this really funny thing and Tony had to run down to the lab to see if the arc reactor was malfunctioning because fuck.  Fuck.
A sharp ringing sound grew in his ears; his senses numbed, his mind slowed down and his heart, his fucking heart.
He sighed, squeezing her hand that was wrapped firmly around his.  God, Pepper, a part of him was happy she was here, with him, but the rest was so disgusted that she was seeing him like this, so weak, so cowardly, so so so
“Okay, let’s get one thing straight here,” Tony started, making his way over towards the couch.  He flopped down onto his, refusing to meet anyone’s eye.  “All of you are not going to treat me any different, capishe?  I’m still Tony Fucking Stark, I’m still an Avenger, I’m still
Gently, Tony untangled himself from the other man, sitting up on the bed and facing Steve.  The other man’s eyes were rimmed with red, and Tony tried not to wince.
But Tony needs time.  More time than Steve.  Steve came out with what he wanted, Bucky safe with him.
So as to why he found himself, now weeks later, talking to Nick about the new Mad Max movie they’d gone to see (separately, and well, that was somewhat unfortunate, really), Tony had no explanation.  Again.
And fuck if Steve didn’t look so earnest, so willing, so goddamn loving after all the shit Tony put him through.  It did strange things to him, but for once, strange wasn’t necessarily bad.
His name was called and the man kicked Tony over, so his own eyes were looming into the man’s.  The man, who looked absolutely disgusted with Tony and really, really, why wouldn’t he?
Before he could come up with some bullshit schpiel, a pair of strong arms were wrapping around him, pulling him in tight.  He let out a soft gasp as Steve buried his head into the crook of Tony’s neck, hands stroking the small of his back and Tony absolutely melted.
She regretted that her job wouldn’t let her be with her little boy the way a parent should be there for their child.  She regretted the times that the boy was brought into–where having a child out of wedlock would most likely damage her position in the career she’d fought so hard for.  She regretted that she took out her grief with sex and alcohol, instead of in a more positive fashion.  She regretted that it was with
“Well, she’d probably want to come without me,” Tony said.  “Seeing as how she moved back to Malibu a few months ago.”
Steve smokes another cigarette and waits half an hour before he finishes getting dressed to leave.  The stairs are covered in family pictures he didn't notice on the way up, when he was pulling off his shirt and sticking his tongue down Tony's throat.  He looks at every photo on the way down, one at a time, carefully, and wonders which half of these people he killed.
“Haven’t had time, been a busy day,” Tony says, and smirks when he thinks of Steve seeing the clip later.
In the HUD, he sees Steve falling from the sky.  They’re on a collision course, but it’ll be a close call; if Tony hadn’t answered Peter’s call, Steve would be about to hit the water.  “Come on,” Tony says, willing the suit to go faster.  “This is gonna hurt, you son of a bitch.”
“Ace-holey?” Morgan says, because she might be testing at eleventh grade reading levels at age six but, luckily for Tony, spelling isn’t her strong suit.
“I’m not mad at you on Bruce’s behalf,” Tony says.  “Although maybe I would be, if I thought a single word you said back there had anything to do with Bruce.”
“I’d rather keep them out of our relationship from now on, if it’s all the same to you,” Steve said.  “Oh, and Tony?”
Steve pulls the straps of the shield around his wrist, runs a finger around the edge.  “Thank you,” he says, looking up at Tony.
“Everything’s about money in the end,” Stark says.  “How about it, Aldrich?  Make it 25 g’s and 15 percent.”
Steve remembers that; his superiors had been furious.  “So as soon as the war got ugly for you personally, you wanted out.  Color me impressed.”
Steve whirls around and catches an approaching fella in the gut; he doubles over with a grunt, and a man down the hall holds up a Tommy gun.  “Duck!” Steve yells, and hopes to hell that Stark hits the deck as bullets fly.
“Why?” Tony said, exasperated.  “What difference does it make?  So you spilled your guts to me a few times.  Who cares?  It’s not like I can tell anyone.”
"I've been ready for two and a half years for that," Steve says.  "I've just been waiting for the right opportunity.”
Tony snorted.  “I know a little about quiet retirements.  They don’t always work out.  Too many bad guys just begging to get punched.”
“I’m sorry, did you want that underwater upgrade to your suit or not?  Because all this butting into things you don’t know anything about is going to get that moved right to the bottom of the priority list.”
, for the record, because the man was 28 (too young) and 95 (too old, probably) and he was the last person in the world Tony should even consider getting into bed with because he was a teammate and had a case of PTSD to rival Tony’s and on top of all that he was probably the straightest thing since sliced bread and
the one who did what was done to me?"  Banner pushes back from the bar and pulls his coat more tightly around him.  "You still have a chance to keep yourself out of this, Rogers.  I'd suggest you take it."
“I can probably handle them without the shield.”  Steve leans against the railing and gazes out at the party below.  “Why’d you do this, Stark?”
you asked for this, Bruce, because I want you to hear it.  You know, it kind of figures that when it really came down to it, you choked.  You think you're this big strong guy when you're the Hulk, but that's not really
“I’m happy to weigh in on that, if you need assistance.”  Tony fluffed up his pillow in what he hoped was a very nonchalant manner.  “You back to normal?”
, but when he looks at Steve he sees that that’s not it at all, because Steve looks just as unhappy about it as he does.
The sun starts going down during the drive through Pennsylvania, and Tony rolls all the windows down to let in the crisp fall air.  “Thanks for bringing me along,” Steve says.  “I know you don’t get as much time with her as you’d like.”
mad.  “Pull it together, Stevie.  I’m gonna get old standing here waiting for you to stop makin’ goo goo eyes at Stark.”
“No, sorry, that wasn’t about you,” Tony said.  “I mean, it was, but not in the way you - anyway.  Hi.  Good morning.  I’m alive.”
They get a table in the back of a little place in Chelsea that Tony has on retainer to keep paparazzi away; Tony orders a bottle of wine and drinks his first glass in thirty seconds flat and wonders exactly when hanging out with Steve fucking Rogers started making him
“It’s good for morale,” Steve says, grabbing a cookie and settling into his seat.  “Did you have an item for the agenda?”
“Couldn’t wait any longer,” Steve breathes.  He presses Tony up against the wall and kisses him like it’s urgent, like it’s all he’s been thinking about since they last saw each other, not that Tony would flatter himself to think that’s true.
And that’s when Captain Marvel slams into him, grabs the stones right off his gauntlet, and snaps her fingers.
“Yeah, I remember,” Banner interrupts, and Natasha can see a vein throbbing in his forehead.  “But once I start, I can’t always stop.  I’m not - I’m not like them, I don’t actually like hurting people, but I don’t always have -
or he’ll vibrate out of his skin.  He twists his hands together behind his back and says, “Just trying to keep busy, I guess.”
Bruce, who was dozing with his head propped up on his hand, straightened guiltily.  “I’m not that kind of doctor.”
“I deserve that,” Stark acknowledges.  “But I did get out of weapons, in the end.  And it turned out I had a lot of things to get out of.  Things I didn’t even know I was part of.”  He pulls out a rag and polishes the already-gleaming breastplate of the clockwork man.  “Took a couple years to get all my money out of the places it had ended up.  Some of it was involved in things your bosses probably have pretty extensive files on.”
moment.  Or, at least it might be before Clint opens his mouth and says, “So whadda they got on you?”
Steve glared at him.  Tony tensed, and before he could blink the ball was hitting the fence behind him.  He glanced at his gauntlet; 148 MPH, but
"No, I don't," Tony says.  "I mean there's this meeting, but I don't have to - I just meant, if you have to be somewhere - "
He takes a left at the canned peas, and the second door is there, right where his source said it would be.  He tries the knob, and it turns easily and opens into a dingy staircase that nobody's cleaned in a long while.  It's dark, and Steve wonders for a minute if they're open, but then he hears it - the clink of a glass, the low murmur of conversation.  He's in the right place.
It is, in some indefinable way, very much an invitation.  And over the course of his life, Tony has had feelings about Steve along the entire spectrum - he’s idolized him and been irritated by him and been proud of him and hated him, it’s been
“You ever think of giving up the whole secret identity thing?” Tony asks.  “It’d certainly enrich your social media presence.”
at keeping track of her, and just as he threw the ball she took off, and Tony had barely even caught the pitch and thrown it in Rhodey's direction before she slid into second.
“To getting a fucking bathroom in this place!” Barton yells, and with a laugh, they all clink their glasses.
“Dum-E, I swear, one of these days I’m going to paint a clown face on you and then everyone will know the truth, you are a mess, seriously - who’s at the door, J?” Tony said, not looking up at the knock.
“Hey, no complaints, I didn’t mind the view,” Natasha said, “but then again I don’t think Steve even noticed the rest of us were there.”
"Won't work.  It has to be somebody who knows how to get under my skin.  And I think it has to come from someone I care about."
"I implied I might," Stark says, "and you were pretty clearly not interested, so I'll save my money. You're not here to bust us or to collect a payoff, but I'm guessing you didn't wander in on accident, either.  So what's the deal?"
“Edgar deals with toiletries,” Clint said, tossing a towel down and joining them.  “So, Tony, I see that at least one of my sparkling varietals is up to your standards.”
“I didn’t mean the things I said,” Tony says.  “When we were fighting, I didn’t - I mean I probably meant some of it at the time, but I was pissed and embarrassed and really afraid of what you were going to say, if I’m being honest, and none of that is an excuse at all, and you didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of that.”
“Thor left it out on the bar at the tower,” Clint said, looking proud of himself.  “Should we break into it?”
“Sam would probably say something obnoxious, like that it’s my subconscious trying to process grief alongside my unresolved emotional attachment.  He’d probably be right, but don’t tell him that.”
Steve’s still mulling over the conversation when he leaves the bureau just after nightfall.  Pierce has always kept close tabs on his agents, but it’s not against protocol to take a look at a file for a case you’re not on.  Steve’s so focused on trying to figure out what he’d done to tick off the old man that he doesn’t notice the black Chrysler parked in front of the office until the man leaning against it says, “Agent Rogers?”
“Probably can’t say the same for most of your guests,” Steve murmurs, letting his hands skate down Tony’s sides.  “You sure know how to throw a party.”
smart.  Ambitious.  Always calculating what’s next.  He doesn’t particularly want to play chess with Beck, but he has to admit he’s curious.  “And why would I re-think that, exactly?”
“Rude,” Steve said, and flicked a handful of water at him.  “I really hope we don’t get attacked while we’re drunk and naked.”
“No,” Steve said.  “I didn’t.”  He sighed again.  “I came down to your lab because I like you a normal amount too.”
Steve raises his eyebrows.  "I just told you I'm an officer of the law.  What makes you think I'm gonna tell you my name?"
“Exactly,” Tony says.  “Really, if you want to get into the quantum possibility matrix of it all, there’s probably a version of us out there that does all kinds of things.  I mean, there’s probably a version of you that votes Republican.  There’s a me who adds roller skates to the suit.”
“He’s a scientist, we’re all a little unstable,” Stark says.  “He’s just more interestingly unstable than most of us.”
“So what are you saying?” Jameson says.  “Are you saying Tony Stark might not be the hero we’ve all been trained to think he is?”
“I can see that,” Steve says.  He turns in Tony’s arms and meets the other man halfway, their lips pressing together a little more hesitantly in the light of day, maybe, but still firm and purposeful, and Steve shivers despite the warm morning.  “I should get going.”
“While I do not have non-emergency surveillance access to Agent Romanov’s quarters,” JARVIS said, “I
she asked me if I had any intention of moving back in, and I told her I didn’t know, and she said for someone who knew the whole future I had a hell of a hard time figuring out what I wanted.”  Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.  “And then
"As long as you don't bring any friends from work," Romanov says.  Steve tips his hat to her and, slinging his ruined jacket over his injured shoulder to hide the blood spattering the white shirt, climbs the stairs.
“I just feel,” Tony said, pausing to bite gently at Steve’s nipple, “like I don’t want to waste this opportunity to find out
anymore, so that’s something.  Bruce, Brucie, I’m such a fan, I will invent a thousand fabrics for your beautiful green ass if you want me to, all you have to do is ask and you shall receive.  Clint, even though you’re an annoying son of a bitch sometimes, you cook a mean Thanksgiving dinner and I’m glad you did it, I actually am.  And Steve.  Oh, Steve.  What to say.  I should probably just say nothing, because if I’m not careful I’m going to start talking about how much I like Steve and
“Language!” Tony called after him as the other kids followed.  “End it, Agent.  Just do it.  One shot.  Put me out of my misery.”
“I thought you said you’d rather make out with a warthog than any of us,” Steve said, folding his arms across his chest.
And with that, Banner disappears just as he arrived: without a sound.  Steve stares at his reflection in the dim glass for a long, long time before he picks up his hat and heads back up to the street.
“Hey,” Tony says, finding himself completely unable to shut down the goofy smile spreading across his face.
“Speaking of murderers,” Jameson says, “what about all the criminals who Blipped back and then escaped from prisons that had been abandoned?  In New York alone, there are over two hundred prisoners who have yet to be re-captured.  How will you feel if one of them murders someone?”
They stared at each other.  Tony could (vaguely) remember Steve being brave last night, so.  He figured he kind of owed him one.
“Are you sure?” Cap asked warily.  The others had backed away, still skeptical, but Steve stayed hovering over him.
At Bucky’s silence, however, Steve had to look up.  His friend was staring at him, wide eyed and jaw slacked.  Steve rolled his eyes, and turned back to the pair of jeans he was currently folding.
And again, again, it wasn’t until Tony had left the room that the implications of Tony’s words hit him like a punch to the gut.  The realization took a firm hold over him, fast and strong and
They would talk later, they would, they had to.  But for now, for now Tony was wrapped in Steve’s arms, kissing the man for all of New York to see, and Tony knew that whatever happened, it would be worth it, honestly and truly.
The first person that comes to mind is Natasha, but he hasn’t seen her in a few weeks, since her last visit, since Steve...admitted to a weakness he tries not to show so openly in front of others.  He doesn’t have her number, because she’s still, technically, on the other side of all of this.  She shows up when she needs to, or she contacts him on a burner phone.
“Yeah baby, gotta make you nice and loose first, gotta open you up, get you ready for me,” he muttered, already halfway through ripping Tony’s pants off.  When he reached for his top layers however, Tony stopped him.
Steve turns toward T’Challa, who’s poised at the door frame of Steve’s bedroom.  The King is dressed formally, a suit made of cloth, not of vibranium.
He says that a lot.  But mostly, he tells Tony how he knows Tony feels the same way, and that Tony’s too stubborn to admit it.  But Tony’s
It was at Park Street where the real nostalgia began -- not that Tony was a nostalgic person, or at least he never thought he was.  What did he have to be nostalgic about?  His childhood?  His early failures as an engineer?  The mess of his media life that was 2004?
At a place like this, he didn’t need his usual, tiring Tony Stark charm that was required of him at galas or business meanings.  He didn’t need to
over.  Y’know, just in case.  Or something.  Right, Oh Captain My Captain?  Right?  I mean I know my file says some shit in there that you might not find to your liking, but-”
Part of Tony really expected him to leave.  Another part thought he’d go over to Tony’s kitchen and make him weird, calming tea or something.
Steve was virtually screaming now, his voice high pitched and strangled, face twisted with sloppy tears, Thor physically holding him back from reaching out and shaking Tony apart.
And when Tony pulled the gun out of the drawer, that was the only thought that crossed his mind; that it was a gun, that it was loaded, and that was good, better than good.  Better than whiskey or vodka or scotch, better than a goddamn bottle of pills.
The man gave him a small smile.  “I’m Dr. Andrew Garner.  I’m here on Coulson’s behalf.  He requested that I come talk to you.”
“I’m saying Maria wasn’t your biological mother…it doesn’t matter, because she was a better mother than I ever was, but what I’m saying is that twenty-two years ago your father and I fell into bed together, and now here we are.
Steve would come by before the team meeting, maybe swing by the workshop, walk up to the conference room together.  You know.  Just to say hi.
“Uh, hello?” Bruce said.  “The science experiment gone wrong isn’t exactly setting any positive examples over here.”
“Better than those neighbors you had over a few weeks ago for drinks,” Tony said.  “On top of being catastrophically boring, they were also pretty racist.”
With a thunk and a crash and a metallic screech, a clockwork man walks into the room from behind the bar.
Vanko arches an eyebrow.  Steve’s playing with fire; seconds in command tend to be fiercely loyal right up until an opportunity presents itself.
Not that he doesn’t trust the others, of course he trusts them, he just wants to be there.  It’s important, returning all the stones to their precise locations in time to snuff out any alternate timelines they may have created by snatching them away.  If something goes wrong - well, he’d be there, and he’d fix it.  Tony always fixes things.
The man below Steve stops struggling and falls unconscious, and Steve releases him immediately.  “You’re gonna get us killed,” he mutters, following Stark back toward the stairwell.
As Steve’s eyes adjust to the dim car interior, he finds himself staring at Alexander Pierce.  “Everything all right, sir?” he says.
There’s a sudden explosion of gunfire, and Steve rolls under a table as bullets hit the wall behind him.  “Give it up, Rogers,” Pierce says from across the smoky room.  “It’s just like Stark to save his own skin when it comes down to it, so I can’t say I’m surprised, but I thought
something about any of it?” Tony said, and he sounded angry, almost furious.  “All the stupid mistakes, the fighting, the suffering?  How can you say that?  Do you just not care?”
He’s in Indiana before he even looks up.  Nobody talks to him when he buys a gas station hot dog and fills up his tank, so he decides to stay a few days.  People in small towns are less likely to think the guy with the scruffy baseball cap really is Captain America grabbing a stack of pancakes in their neighborhood diner; mostly, they leave him alone.
"I was enjoying the show," Clint responds. He works her wrists around until he's got her pinned one-handed--with the other, he slides a blindfold over her eyes. She stands stock-still. Clint snugs the bandana in place; then, his hand drops to graze over her rump, gathering up a handful of the ivory silk slip she's wearing. "You wearing anything under this?" he asks.
Next to him, Tony drummed his fingers on the console.  “Everything looks good.  The coordinates are right.  I should have another ten minutes in this location, at least.  Oh, and I’m still against this idea, for the record.”
Which is why he's as surprised as anyone to find himself swinging open the door to the Black Widow just before midnight.
He wasn’t actually going to puke, he determined fairly quickly, but it had been a decent way to excuse himself because nobody liked to hang out with somebody who was about to throw up, not even -
“You might not now, but you will soon,” Pierce says.  “If you know what’s good for you.  We usually hang traitors in this country, but if you ask nicely I might be able to get you a deal.”
“So,” Pierce says, his voice echoing through the bar, “if we know she’s here, and we know the others probably are too, whaddya say we drop all the pretense and have a little chat?  How’s that sound, Miss Romanov?”
The thing about the Annual Intra-Avengers Baseball Game was that it was always a little... contentious.
Odinson brings their drinks and slides back down to the other side of the bar; Steve has a feeling he can still hear them, but he appreciates the show of discretion anyway.
She smiles indulgently. Clint's many proclivities are an open book to her. "How was I to know?" she says innocently, batting her eyelashes at him, and is not a bit surprised when he seizes a pillow and, ignoring her squeals, drives her off the bed in a blizzard of feathers. "Stop!! Stop!! I'll be good, I swear," she says, laughing.
And that’s when Steve yanked him forward, leaned down and kissed him.  Tony was briefly aware that he was still wearing his facemask and his catcher’s glove and that terrible ugly vest that he wore to protect his fragile squishy human parts, and then all of that awareness completely left the building because
"Exactly," Stark says, smiling.  "So, now you know the name of a famous industrialist who hangs out at speakeasies.  Care to return the favor?"
before Steve leans in.  When he’s just a hair’s breadth away he pauses, and Tony thinks that if he’s gonna call it off he has to do it now, right now, because he’s not gonna get another chance -
) an asteroid hurtling toward Earth could have kept his mind off what they were planning to do the next day, grating carrots (seriously, what kind of sadist had written a recipe that demanded
“Where’s the fun in that?” Tony says, and kisses the top of his head, which is probably dumb but whatever, oxytocin.
have any ground to say you didn’t do anything - okay, new rules!  No whining.  No shopping.  No sneaking out.  JARVIS, restrict elevator access for all minors.”
“ - and not just the politicians but the mobsters too, Killian and Blonsky and all of them, and they won’t just arrest you and put you out of business, you know they won’t, they’ll - ”
Steve holds very still.  Pierce’s gaze is level, and gives absolutely nothing away.  “Not much.  Couple operations out of Hoboken, last I heard, but I’ve never worked his case.”
is a good rule.  If they brought it home it would be all or nothing, and since it definitely couldn't be all, it would have to be nothing.
"Grab ahold of the top shelf," he tells her, and Natasha obediently reaches for the edge of the shelf. Her cigarette drops a column of ash on her left breast, stinging her, and she jumps and whimpers but does not move. Rising quickly behind her, Clint brushes the ash away, and, in a gesture that makes her shiver, takes the cigarette from her lips. She hears him take a drag behind her, feels his exhale on her shoulders as she's wreathed in two rippling banners of smoke. His voice comes from behind her.
“Only Vanko,” Banner says.  “But if Blonsky sent him, that means they’re interested.  We’re lucky they didn’t notice your armband, Stark; Vanko’s got a quick trigger finger and he doesn’t mind collateral damage.”
Tony’s finally setting the last flipped Prius right side up when he sees Steve slam the door to the van shut and head back toward his bike.
“Nice night,” he commented as his eyes adjusted to the moonlight, and he blinked as Steve quickly shoved something into his pocket.
“That’s psychobabble and I resent it,” Tony says.  “Look, the short version is, I screwed it up pretty much immediately, no surprises there.  It’s probably for the best.”
“He’s fine,” Sam says.  “He’s fallen out of buildings, he can take a few swings.  They’re patching him up right now.”
“A lot,” Steve admitted, wincing as a gaping Stark Industries employee eased his way around the completely excessive, totally-edible gingerbread house in the middle of the lobby.  “And for the record, gingerbread is
Steve thinks about one of the years they were on the run, the time Natasha snuck ingredients back to their shitty apartment in Phnom Penh and Wanda baked a cake while Sam was asleep on the sofa and they woke him up singing Happy Birthday.  “Thought it was cats dying,” he’d grumbled, but they could tell he was happy, and they’d all had cake for dinner.
Pepper puts out the most incredible press release the day Tony officially moves back into the penthouse.
“J, open up the server,” Tony said, once the rest of the team was ostensibly in bed.  “I’m looking for that list of parts I ordered last week, no idea where I ordered it from, pull up my - hey, what are all these?”
"Kind of.  Not really.  We don't do parties, parties are in bad taste, it was the board, and there were a lot of questions about the space shuttle program, and Pepper was there."
Steve pushes back from the table and heads to the bar.  Nobody notices - they’re too busy trying to convince Bruce he’d have made a good accountant in a past life - and Tony quickly stands up too, leaves the rest of them arguing workplace semantics and follows him.
“I could eject both of you for that, you know,” Coulson said, arching an eyebrow as Tony settled into position.
"You'd be surprised," Stark says.  He throws back the rest of his drink.  "Just be careful, Rogers.  Wouldn't want a nice kid like you to get caught up in something ugly."
"Self-defense isn't weapons manufacturing," Stark says, pulling off the arm band and slipping it into his pocket.  "I'll pay for the damages."
“Do you think when we grow up, like, our cells will still be the same?” Bruce said.  “Or will they be totally different grown up versions of the cells that we have
“Way ahead of you, Doc,” Clint says, grabbing the sack from him and stepping over the body on the floor.
“This is awesome.”  Steve inspects the drawing as closely as if it were a prized work of art.  “Looks like you used every color in the box.”
He gets on his bike and just rides, so blindly that he doesn't realize what he's doing until he's through the Lincoln Tunnel and pulling into the parking lot of a Sheraton in Hoboken.  He pays for a room and texts Tony the address from the elevator, stands under the scalding spray of the shower until he hears the click of the door.
Tony's propped up on most of the bed's sundry pillows, his fingers in Steve's hair.  "What happened at the raid this morning?"
He swallows hard, then leads her down the stairs to the crowded dance floor.  It’s steaming down here, the air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke.  Natasha’s just begun to wonder if Banner knows how to Charleston when the song ends and a slow one starts up.
"You too, but would you mind keeping it down a touch?" Steve says.  "Be nice if there were a few people around who
“For those of you who don’t know,” Clint said, ignoring her and turning to Thor, “there is a tradition here in America to share what we’re thankful for on Thanksgiving, because this is supposed to be a day about being grateful for everything we have or some shit.  I’ll start, okay?  I’m thankful for Stella.  Stella’s my favorite bow, if anyone doesn’t know that.”
“That’s a reasonable expectation,” Tony said.  “So if we both like each other a normal amount, that’s… interesting.”
Stark leans even closer, and Steve holds his ground.  The other man is completely in his space now, their bodies nearly touching at the chest.  Stark's lips are slightly parted, and if Steve leaned forward he could -
“Guys,” Tony said.  “Come on.  I was a teenager once.  I get it.  It’s fine.  Nobody’s in trouble.  Just hand it over.”
Steve laid still while a truck rumbled by outside the window.  He thought of all the times Tony had talked to him over the years, the things he’d brushed off, the things he’d ignored.  He wondered why Tony had kept coming, why Tony had kept
“You think?” Steve said.  He blew out a breath, cocked a hip against the doorframe.  “It’s harder, being here.  Than I thought it would be.”
“So that leaves me, making sure that this city isn’t drowned in a muck of its own making,” Pierce says.  “I make sure we don’t tip too far one way or the other.  But keeping that balance - it extracts a price.  There are certain people I’ve needed to bring on board, people who might in the light of day be considered unsavory, but people we need on our side.  It’s better, I’ve found, to keep your enemies close.
And as much as he doesn’t want to admit it, he wants Steve.  He wants to be able to tell Steve what he wants, and for Steve to listen to him and stay anyway.
“Well, I haven’t talked to Santa in a few years, but my good friend Iron Man told me you could use my help making sure any kids who were nervous to meet you know that you and I are friends.”
“And then a few weeks ago I slept with this woman, Nicola Blake, you probably saw her in that Leo DiCaprio movie - ”
There was only one thing to do: leave.  He grabbed his glass of wine and swiveled around and dropped in an elegant heap (if he did say so himself, which he did) onto the sofa next to Bruce.
“I’m definitely not qualified for this,” Tony said.  “Nobody has ever even left me alone with a plant, much less a bunch of
They’re celebrated as heroes, spend months turning down parades, but eventually - just like Tony knew they would - the questions start.
No, what Tony’s created is actually an artificial UNintelligence.  It can’t so much as spell its own name (which is Dopey, for the record, no acronym, not his best work, he’ll get the marketing people on it eventually) without his explicit go ahead, but what it
Before long they’re cruising down Broadway.  Steve’s ridden in a car before, quite a few times, but the interior of this one is the nicest he’s seen, all sleek metal and leather, and the driver’s gloves look fancier than anything Steve’s worn in his life.
The parlor felt somehow brighter in the sudden silence, and Tony jerked a thumb toward the stairs.  “So - ”
“Ignore him,” Pierce snaps, and Natasha smiles, because the night’s gotten away from him a little.  Killing some bootlegger dame in an off-the-books raid won’t raise many eyebrows, but Tony Stark turning up dead, now
Everybody keeps coming by his room without a good excuse.  Steve knows they want to ask him things but they don’t, and Steve wants to tell them things but he doesn’t, but somehow, for some value of okay, it’s okay.
Steve laughs and presses his forehead to Tony’s.  “Everything we do is a bad idea, Tony,” he says, but when Tony kisses him again he can tell he’s smiling.
Steve’s eyes are bright, and Tony can tell by the way he’s holding himself tightly, all kinetic energy waiting to explode that he’s furious, and that - that’s not what Tony wants at all.
"Yeah," Steve says, and then Tony's quiet for a long time, and absolutely nothing is ever right anymore but given the circumstances it's not exactly wrong, either.
Tony wondered vaguely who he had pissed off, besides all the usual suspects.  This felt more as though he’d pissed somebody off in, like, a cosmic way.
“So, question,” Peter said.  “And I really mean this in the nicest way, but has anyone checked to make sure Captain America hasn’t lost his mind?”
“I’m kind of out of the habit after, you know, being in hiding for the past couple of years,” Bruce said apologetically.
And in the middle of it all, Banner, whaling on the fourth man, fists flying, the sickening crunch of bones breaking and the wet thumps of blood vessels popping -
"I think they're planning to reopen one of them this season," Tony says.  "My parents brought me here once.  My mom was a great skiier.  She used to ski the Alps when she visited her grandparents in Italy."
.”  Steve sighed and lifted his paper up again.  “And that’s why I can’t change anything.  This world doesn’t need me meddling with it.  It doesn’t need me at all, actually; I’m a trespasser.  I’m just trying to keep my head down.”
Steve, who had recently pretended to burn his tongue to avoid talking to Bob in the breakroom, smiled.  “That would be great.”
The noise gets louder as he edges through the crowd to the backyard.  The band is set up on a stage next to a swimming pool, and the air is thick with laughter and cigarette smoke.  Almost everybody has a drink in their hand, and Steve doesn’t recognize a single person.
“Sam would probably say talking to my own hallucinations won’t help me work through my lingering trauma.”
“Cap!” Morgan calls when Steve steps out of the elevator.  “I drew a tiger at school the other day, do you want to see?”
If by “the worst”, you mean “Steve ‘Somehow I Don’t Look Bloated The Day After Thanksgiving’ Rogers walked in.”
Tony nods.  “That’s a fair request.  And on the friend thing, of course, you’re totally right, you and me, that was always crazy, even for us.  No hard feelings, give it a couple weeks and we’ll be right back to normal, probably driving each other up the wall just like we - ”
Steve rolled his eyes.  “Oh, I don’t know.  The fact that you drove me crazy.  All the things that happened between us that I regret.  The stupid, pointless crush I had on you probably comes into it somewhere.”
Steve takes a long drag and tilts his head back to exhale.  "I don't think anybody's looking for me to set an example for America's youth anymore."
“Never,” Tony says, pouring himself a scotch.  “You’re a junior Avenger.  This is your life now.  Accept it.”
“Am I gonna get a pitch over here or what?” Bucky drawled impatiently, but when Tony looked back at him he was smirking so Tony figured he couldn’t be
“You’re entitled to your opinion,” Pierce says.  “That’s the beautiful thing about America.  We’re all entitled to our opinions.”  He tilts his head and smiles, and Steve tenses, because there’s no cover nearby, and anyway Natasha and Clint are behind him, easy targets even if he gets out of the way.  “And we’re entitled to change them, too.  In fact, I think I might just change my own. Here’s an idea.  Agent Rogers turns in a quiet resignation, my friend Killian has one extra body to get rid of, and the bureau stays out of it.  It’s all a lot cleaner that way, isn’t it?”  He shakes his head and hefts his gun higher.  “What a waste.”
Bruce had found footage of the Hulk destroying Harlem, which was too bad, but he’d also watched at least seventeen episodes of Cheers, which was
Steve crossed his arms.  “It’s funny, you say you’re real, but the Tony Stark I knew never gave up on anything.”
was a conversation he was super excited about, but hell, it’s not like he had anything better to do, so he took his brimming glass out onto the veranda.
“Cap says we should have something healthier than Fruit Loops in the house,” Morgan says, not looking up from the futuristic-looking unicorn she’s drawing.
“Don’t tempt me,” Tony said, and leaned down and kissed Steve’s abused, bright-red lips.  “What do you want?”
"No, not really."  Steve shifts in his seat.  "It’s - I had a friend who went missing during the war."
“What we did, Pep?  It didn’t come free.  I can’t stand by and let them denigrate everything we worked to save, everything we lost saving it.”
, you can put it down wherever, I’ll have it sent to your place later.  This is a party, I’m really hoping you won’t need it.”
a relief,” Stark says, and when Natasha starts laughing out of pure adrenaline none of them are able to stop for a long, long time.
Steve tries not to think about that too hard as he approaches the door off the alley just past the corner of 55th and Broadway.  The alley smells like grease and garbage and everything else a New York City alley usually smells like, and when Steve opens the swinging door there's nobody in the storeroom of the deli.
“I’m not trying to torture you,” Tony said.  “I’m trying to - I know I’m not doing a very good job, it’s not really my thing, but I’m
Steve tilts his head like he’s considering it carefully.  “On the one hand I do, but on the other hand I
“Huh,” Tony says when the video ends.  “I’d be more compelled by this so-called video evidence if it wasn’t shot on what appears to be a Motorola Razr 3.”
Tony knew where he was supposed to be.  He’d just seen him.  They’d talked.  Tony was supposed to be here.
“I’ll rest easy,” Miss Romanov says.  “We found a few things ourselves, in the mess from Vanko’s office.  Him and his boss have some… plans.”
“He has the power of the federal bureau of investigation behind him, he’s got every politician in the city in his pocket - ”
“The difference is that shotgunning a Natty Light in your dorm room is very different than being served a beer at your job by the adults who are theoretically responsible for you,” Tony says.
“Seriously, Rogers, out with it,” Barton says.  “You disappear for a week and come back looking like you fell face-first into a meat grinder.”
“Oh, yeah!” Peter says enthusiastically, and Tony loves Peter to bits but sometimes he really wonders how this kid hasn’t gotten killed yet, that radioactive spider must have been
Steve falls into a crouch, and when the man with the knife dives he goes low and takes him out at the knees; they scuffle on the floor, and Steve's just about to stomp the knife out of his hands when somebody comes from behind and sucker punches him.
Steve smiles as Tony slides his hands around Steve from the back and bats away his hands from doing up his buttons.  “That’s the kind of thing people do in the morning, you know.  Get dressed.”
Clint's silent behind her - he always is; it's one of his myriad skills - and she's quiet too as she climbs toward her apartment.  The noise of the bar fades quickly as she climbs, lost in the rumbling of automobiles and the yowl of cats, and she’s about to knock on his door when it opens right in front of her.
“Amazing,” Tony said.  “A total genius.  Better than me in every way.  God, I hope she doesn’t want to be a superhero.”
The suit’s nanotech has done strong work, and by the time Tony lands in the open hatch of the hovering Quinjet, he’s at about 70% capacity.  A fucking EMP; it’s so
“You know what you were in Wakanda?  Weak.  You were too weak to do what needed to be done.  And - honestly, Bruce, I don't see how you can forgive yourself for that.  You don't deserve any forgiveness.  Not your own, and not ours, and not all the people who died because of you.”
“You gotta stop whipping that out for bullshit like this or one day you’re gonna say it and it’s gonna be true.”
Natasha doesn’t have a view around the bar, but she can tell by the footsteps and the air in the room that whoever it is brought a crowd.  She’s surprised: they’re not a mob-run joint, so there’s no reason for the Unit to send more than a clean up crew.
“I feel fine, thanks for asking,” Steve says dryly.  “Did you come to give me a hard time?  Because these two have it covered.”
“Then I’ll hit restart and try again,” Steve says.  “We know where the pain points are, we’ve done it once already.  Why do you want to come so badly?”
He looks a little less uncomfortable than he did last time he was here, and Natasha pours him a glass of the moonshine just to see what happens.  “Long day?”
“Oh, yeah, usually when people in our line of work disappear without a word, all of their friends assume they went on a fun solo vacay,” Tony says.
“Because this is about more than one man, no matter what kind of man he is,” Pierce says, his eyes ice cold.  “We have a very important mission here, and every single one of us is just a cog in the machine.  If you’re not interested in the case we’ve assigned you, there are always other options.  I hear they’re looking for agents at the Kansas City field office.”
“I think I oughta,” Agent Sitwell says.  “You want to get a cup of coffee first?  There’s a spot I like just around the corner.”
“What’s going on?” Clint said from the couch, where he and Bruce were playing what appeared to be GTA.
“You don’t trust me,” Stark says.  His arm is flush against Steve’s arm, his hand on the railing just a hair’s breadth from Steve’s little finger.  “It’s okay, you can admit it.  You don’t, right?”
“Yeah, whatever,” Tony says, and Scott looks between them and then backs away, because Scott Lang may be a lot of things but he’s not a
“I don’t mind,” Steve says.  “Morgan’s easy to like.  You should start bringing her to meetings, she can be a junior Avenger.”
All it once it’s too much like being in the trenches but not enough like it either, because there Steve knew what to do, and right now he doesn’t know what to do at all.  “Tony, if you can hear me, I’m sorry, but we have to get you out,” he grits out, and then he reaches down, grabs the facemask and yanks as hard as he can.
He pulls her closer into his arms, swaying to the music as his breath ruffles the curls at the side of her crown. "I think I may have heard of it, once upon a time. They have it in Russia?"
Fifth floor is hers. It’s large enough to be divided into two apartments, if the occupants shared the lavatory, but Natasha likes her privacy, almost as much as she likes her security. There are three locks on the door. She undoes all three carefully, listening for creaks on the other side of the door, looking for a shadow punctuating the line of light that's there. Standing carefully to the side, she lets the door fall open.
“Okay, slightly more fun,” Stark amends, rolling away.  “I’m gonna go to sleep, you want to go to sleep?”
“I gotta warn you,” the man calls out, “he’s very persistent.  In fact he told me to follow you until you got in.”
“Understandable,” Coulson says.  “But we happen to know a little about what the six of you have been getting up to in your off hours, and we have a feeling you might be interested in the support we can provide.”
“Look, Jonah, I think anybody who knows Tony Stark knows he’s a genius,” Beck says, which is an obnoxious thing to say because it’s true, and -
Morgan presses a smacking kiss to his cheek.  “I’ll come back for you.  And if you don’t get up I’ll jump on the bed!”
“Can you bring some towels down to the girls by the pool?  Rogers is concerned for their virtue,” Stark says.
“Now.”  She raises her eyebrows, and Bruce’s gaze slides to the man who still seems to think he has a chance.
“And that,” Tony says.  He leads the way out of the bedroom, Nicola trailing after him, her heels dangling from her fingers.  “Happy’ll take you wherever you want to go - you remember Happy?”
“Not at all, but now that you’re a ridiculously attractive grown man again, we are back in business,” Tony said, swatting Steve’s ridiculously attractive grown man ass and pressing a kiss to the corner of his lips.  “I’m guessing you won’t want to call me Daddy anymore though, huh?”
“Nothing, honey,” Pepper says, gazing out the window.  “Just tired of all the cameras.  Glad to be going home.”
“I’m not part of the bureau,” Coulson says.  “We’re called the Strategic Science Reserve.  We’re an… independent organization.”
"Good thing, too, 'cause if you were you'd have been terrible at it," the man says, leaning back in his seat, his eyes raking Steve up and down.  "Odinson had you made in five seconds flat."
“There are a lot of things I didn’t used to do,” Steve says, watching lightning roll silently across the horizon. “Seems silly not to do them now.”
“I don’t think he’ll mind,” Steve said, pulling it out of his pocket and taking another sip.  “And if he does, he’s not here to mention it.”
It’s only two and a half blocks to Strange’s place, and Tony puts his head down and hoofs it, just a New Yorker trying to stay dry.  When he gets to the big doors he hesitates, just for a second, and then he thinks
Tony ignores all of it.  He reads Morgan bedtime stories via holo and repairs the Mark LIV and has his PR people decline every interview invitation and request for comment, even when they beg him to
“Sure is,” Beck says.  “Why try to deny it?  You and the rest of the Avengers talked all about it.  You planned the whole thing.  We have it on
"Fridays always are.  It's funny how many folks care a little less about the Constitution after a long week," Barton says.  "Stark's at the same table as yesterday."
“So, never,” Rhodey translates.  “Tony’s incapable of retiring.  He actually invented time travel so he wouldn’t have to retire.”
“In a splash-off?  I’m pretty sure I could ta - ” Tony said, before he was cut off by a literal tsunami.  “Okay, Clint’s gonna have to refill the pool if you keep that up.”
Thor sniffed the air curiously.  “What smell?” he said.  “I don’t smell anything.  Bruce, do you smell anything?”
“No promises,” Tony said, and swallowed a groan as Steve pressed his mouth to Tony’s dick through his underwear.  “You done this before?”
Natasha’s heart leaps into her throat.  She runs out the door behind Clint, who looks over her shoulder with a frown.
“Yes!” Clint said, grabbing the nachos and leading the way into the adjourning parlor (because really, it was a parlor, that’s the only term for a room like that, Tony would know, and how weird was it that Clint had a
“Clint was saying that young Steve has - ” Thor started, but then Natasha’s little elbow darted out and nailed him, right in the ribs.  “Oh!  Good aim, milady.”
“Sure, but you could argue that with a company as large and diverse as Stark Industries, they have their hands in a lot of pies,” Jameson says, sounding very much like he has no intention of arguing that at all and only brings it up for the sake of a straw man.
“I seem to,” Stark says.  “What are you doing poking around up here, anyway?  Just general nosiness?”
“We should move HQ to South Dakota,” Tony announces.  “Alcohol is cheap, the views are acceptable in the dark, and you can almost ignore the smell of manure.  It’s not so bad.”
"My pants?  I don't care about the pants - sure, we don't do this in New York, but this is kind of a letter but not the spirit thing, we can literally
In the tradition of Stark men, Tony spent Thanksgiving Day working, ignoring anyone who tried to bother him (in order: JARVIS, Pepper, JARVIS, a Hello Kitty balloon from the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade that almost got loose, JARVIS, thirteen texts from Clint berating him for not having a gravy boat made of anything other than silver, and JARVIS), and drinking.  If there was one part of the holiday spirit Tony could get into, it was the drinking.  Mulled wine!  Spiked eggnog!  Shots of quadruple-distilled vodka illegally imported from the Soviet Union!  That one had maybe just been his dad, but still.  That made it a family tradition!
"I came off the project three years ago," Banner says.  "There was an... incident.  But back then they operated out of Washington Heights.  The things they're doing - "
"So it seems like you're really not here on the job," Romanov says, looking Steve up and down.  "Killian would have been a huge catch for the boys in blue, and you let him walk right out of here."
Steve waits until the bartender’s gone before he says, “And I didn’t realize you were my boss these days.  Did you guys update the charter since I left?”
“Then we’re all in a lot of trouble,” Tony said, poking his head into a Bath and Body Works and withdrawing immediately due to the smell.  “Come on, you guys should be better than this, what do teenagers like to do at the mall?”
“Verily,” Odinson says, grabbing another glass of champagne.  “We deserve it after the other night’s escapade.”
“At sixteen?  I was going to college and trying to build a robot out of junker cars and hanging out with kids three years older than me.  Trying to get laid when you’re the youngest kid in the freshman class, not fun, can’t recommend.”
“Okay, how about, do you want to come upstairs, skip the drink and go straight to bed?  Promise I haven’t used that one before.”
The insurrection in Sokovia isn’t particularly organized, but it’s still a decent fight; the armored soldiers are way overpowered, blowing up buildings left and right, and Tony wonders what kind of Justin Hammer-impersonating asshole is responsible this time.  By the time Cap and Wanda corner the leaders in an abandoned subway station, several city blocks are rubble.
Steve glanced back, still glaring stubbornly.  “With all due respect, I don’t think I am.  The doc says I might put on a few more inches, but I don’t think I’ve got a foot and a half to go, and that’s what I’d need to wear any of those clothes.”
“Offense fully taken,” Clint said.  “Okay, so I called ahead and made sure rooms were made up for everybody, if you need anything this is Edgar - hey Edgar, these are my friends, you know who they are - Edgar’s the butler - ”
“About yourself,” Tony interrupts.  “You may have forgotten I pretty much have a degree in self-loathing.”
He finds Tony in the kitchen, sitting on the floor surrounded by a deconstructed toolbox, a tipped-over bottle and the remains of what looks like the inside of a computer.  "You're here!"
“I’m sure it is,” Tony says.  He looks around at everyone staring at him, their faces everywhere along the spectrum from discomfort to pity, and climbs over the back of the sofa.  “Anybody else want a drink?  Bruce?  Just one martini, you can have one and go straight back to work, you can’t even feel them these days, I know you can’t.  Rhodey, sweet cheeks, Manhattan on the rocks coming right up, you know I’ve got you - ”
Steve and the Hawk both look around.  A man Steve's never seen before, dressed to the nines and wearing a hat that probably cost as much as Steve's monthly pay, stands under the one bright light in the whole bar.
,” Steve said.  He leaned back and smirked, which was pretty bold of him considering his shirt was now seventeen sizes too small.  “Actually, it was pretty fun.”
“Banner’s a genius,” Stark proclaims.  “I’ve been working on a compound for my new power source - I’m gonna run an entire floor of my building off it, it’s gonna change the energy game - and I’ve spent three weeks feeding different juice into the capacitor with no luck.  Banner took one look at it, and bam.  Solved it.”
“Search them,” the man says briskly, and Steve puts his hands where everybody can see them as the other men step forward.
“Are you envisioning some big love story with a happily ever after at the end?  Because I have this funny feeling that that’s not how this story goes.  I’m not that kind of guy, and somehow I don’t think you are either.  Or at least you haven’t been so far.”
Steve just turns on his heel jogs up the stairs, and even though it's as hot as New York City ever gets in the middle of the night, Steve thinks, it's a lot less heated than it was in that dingy stairwell under the firebrand gaze of Tony Stark.
Steve sets the shield back on the floor gently and walks out onto the balcony.  “I don’t know, the crowd’s getting pretty rowdy.”
"Of course you do," Tony says.  He plucks the cigarette from Steve's mouth and holds it to his own.  Steve watches his lips curl around the paper, sees the lazy exhale, tendrils of smoke drifting into the humid air.
Steve winced.  “Maybe.  I think.  I’m pretty sure, actually.  And for the record I’m only telling you because I think you already said it on accident.  And also because I have a feeling you won’t remember any of this tomorrow.”
Tony rolls his eyes and pours another couple of glasses for the rest of them.  “To new beginnings,” he says, and when he slides his hand up Steve’s thigh under the bar Steve leans in closer.
The metal shears off with a screech, and then it’s just Tony’s face, pale and drawn with blood seeping out of a cut from over his eye, and Steve hasn’t lost a soldier in a while and this one - this one -
“You’re reading, but you have the TV on too,” Tony said.  “Which means you’re not paying attention to either.  So.  What are you thinking about?”
"I don't take much stock in who supplies the hooch, I just drink it," Tony says.  "Hell, I even visit your bars once in a while."
“He’s lucky I even talk to him,” Tony says as he waves to the security guard at the end of the Pentagon’s driveway.  “I should be spending all my time on VR headsets and automated vacuum cleaners.  That’s what’s driving the economy, not his space defense program.”
“Oh, not much,” Steve said.  If Tony had ever forgotten that the man was once a performer himself, he couldn’t miss it now; Steve had his audience’s rapt attention.  The room was silent, every boy and girl leaning forward eagerly to hear what Captain America himself would ask for.  “Just for all my friends here in New York to have a safe and happy holiday season.”
This car was in better shape than May’s car, so Peter didn’t see a problem with it. He just shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t think it’s bad.”
"But I care what he thinks about me!" Peter shouted, his voice cracking slightly. He froze and cleared his throat as his face burned red.
Steve grabbed Tony by the shoulders to stop him before he ran out the door. "You need to take a deep breath. Peter is with Harry. He's going to be okay until we get there, but you need to relax first."
Peter shrugged his shoulders. “Not anymore dangerous than other things I’ve done. I’ll be fine. Especially with you there. Don’t worry about me. I’m Spider-Man. I can handle myself.”
"He'd be out there with or without you, Tony," Steve told him. Steve had seen videos of him long before the airport in Germany. "You're just giving him more protection and keeping him safe."
Tony started to play the music, and it was a soft sound. He smiled because it was only a few seconds in, and Tony could already tell it was so
Steve never wanted his child to feel like Joseph made him feel. And even if this child wasn’t his real child, for now, Peter was his boy, and he would protect and defend him.
"Embarrassed about it, huh? Yeah, I'd be mortified too if my son tried getting makeup. I mean, condoms, good for him. But makeup? No, sir--."
Maybe Peter had just always been super lucky with parents. Three out of three sets were perfect. Harry didn’t have that same luck with only his one parent.
Harry scrambled out of the house and to Norman’s side, following him rigidly as they walked back to their house. Steve didn't close the door until he saw the two of them disappear in their own house. Steve prayed that Norman didn’t take anything out on his son.
Peter lifted his fingers to his lips, remembering the feeling of Harry’s on his, and he had a hard time believing anything else.
Peter flopped backwards on his bed with a loud groan. This was going to be a lot harder than he thought.
Peter hoped he wasn’t getting any of it on Harry. That would definitely be embarrassing. He groaned after another round of vomiting. Harry helped move him to the ground by a tree and sat next to him. “‘M sorry!” Peter cried, feeling nauseous. He regretted drinking. If this was what being normal felt like, he never wanted to be normal again.
This song was very upbeat and either had a set routine or Peter had choreographed his own. Between the music and Peter's (off-key) singing, it was loud in the house.
They got into the car and hurried to where Tony traced Peter’s phone to the exact location. Steve wasn’t surprised that Tony had his location so readily, though he did wonder if Peter knew about it. Probably not, as that would just start another fight.
It was so hard for Steve to keep his eyes down. "Tony, the entire neighborhood doesn't need to know. Neither does our son."
Peter shrugged his shoulders and Tony narrowed his eyes. "Did kids bother you about it? You know what I've said about bullies, Peter."
know about what happened at the mall? He just wanted to keep Harry out of trouble...he didn’t think the news would travel around the entire neighborhood.
The only time his father didn’t throw his fists around was when he had been drunk. Then he just came home and passed out on the couch. Those nights, his mother had to take care of him and his father. Steve tried not to need anything on those nights. Sometimes, Bucky came over to check on them and took care of Steve when his mother was busy with Joseph.
“He’s a lowlife, Peter. He will do whatever necessary to get what he wants, and frankly, I don’t know what that is with you.” Steve’s  knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.
Steve didn't seem to mind though, even when there was a perfectly fine couch that could fit them both easily a few feet away.
After a moment of hesitation, Steve answered, "I don't think they know who we are...I mean...if they did, they would have known the crash wasn't going to kill us. They would have had to come back and finish the job."
Later that night, they all ended up on the couch again. They let Steve pick the movie this time, and he chose a film that had been on his list for a long time. Tony wasn't familiar with it, but it wasn't bad.
Sighing, Peter pushed open his bedroom door. He thought one hide-out was enough for today, but he already needed another one.
Steve’s shoulders relaxed the moment Peter started talking, and a smile spread across his face. “Queens,” was all he said and Peter found himself smiling right back.
"Thank you. I better keep running before he wakes up, but I'll see you around soon, Roger. Have a good day!" She started to jog off and Steve waved with a smile.
Peter knew that Tony didn’t want to fight with Steve anymore. Especially not after they had been getting along for so long. He wanted to tell Tony that all of these feelings he was having was because he was in love with Steve, but telling him that now would probably cause his mind to melt.
am, and I say that he will not be going on that thing. You shouldn’t even be on it like you were this morning.”
is just making up a story. He needs to stay away from him." Steve was already turning on his heel, storming out the door.
Peter's next words were almost carefully planned, it sounded like. "The new version of the Accords is good. It satisfies both sides. Even you admitted that. What's still an issue?"
"Lucky us," Tony muttered, dropping his mug into the sink after he had already finished it. He started walking out of the kitchen and Steve's eyes drifted to the sink.
Steve looked down in his glass as he swirled the orange juice around. He didn’t want either of them to see the disappointment on his face.
There was a sound of feet scurrying down the hall before Peter and Harry were right there. Peter’s face was flushed, and Harry looked nervous too. He wondered if they heard the fighting from where they were both hiding.
Tony couldn't imagine Peter being anything but his typically bubbly self. "I don't like it," he said honestly.
Peter raised his cup to Harry before drinking it. It burned his throat and made his stomach feel queasy, but he didn’t stop. This is what normal kids did, and he was going to be normal. Once that drink was done, he filled the cup up again because he was sure his metabolism would mess with his ability to get drunk. Steve couldn’t ever get drunk and Peter prayed it wasn’t the same for him.
He wouldn't want Tony. Hell, Tony wouldn't even want him to want him. The only reason Tony couldn't get the fantasy of himself riding Steve as they rode that bike was because he was horny and he hadn't been laid in months. He'd only masturbated once since he'd been in this damn place because there was no such thing as privacy anymore.
Tony and Steve both jumped apart as the record changed to the next song. Tony's heart was racing as he looked over to where Peter was watching them from the doorway.
Steve didn't want him to get worked up about it again. They were supposed to be relaxing. "Just sit down and at least put your feet in if you're going to stay out here." He was breaking the silence Steve had been enjoying, but he'd much rather hear him than the silence. Tony was always the exception to everything.
I'm dropping this as I fight a migraine so if there are mistakes please ignore them until I can fix them. I wil answer all comments on the last chapter tomorrow morning! Thank you all for the HUGE response last chapter! Your comments are so sweet and I've never the smiles they've been giving more than usual lately.
The easiest solution to dealing with his anger was taking it out on someone that deserved his anger. Someone who lied to him and frustrated him and always acted like he was so much better than him.
felt off, and his spidey sense didn’t let him ignore that. “Well, were you looking for something? ‘Cus you were looking--.”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Harry said immediately. “I made sure he didn’t choke. I tried to get him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen.”
Tony leaned against the car seat with a deep sigh. “And I know I have no way of stopping you, so I guess that’s the best deal I’m going to come to with you.”
“I needed some air, so I ran. Found myself at a Harley Davidson store. I wanted the bike the moment I saw her. I gave them your credit card.”
“I’m being serious. Just...stay out of trouble. Please. If you only ever keep yourself from bad guys one time, let it be this time.” Tony was pleading now, and Peter felt bad.
“Now that we’re all awake and ready for our day, I think we should figure out the cover story for this whole little
Tony smiled. He didn't know who was around that Steve needed to play undercover husband for, but Tony liked that nickname. He wished he used it more often.
"Yes," Tony said. "It'll help you find your rhythm. I mean, we both just heard Peter. What's worse than that?"
Tony wasn't, though Steve wished sometimes he would cut the kid some slack. He seemed just as miserable when Steve checked on him after dinner and invited him to the pool. Peter couldn't even look him in the eyes when Steve asked, so he wasn't surprised he declined.
“But…” Peter tried not to let himself get upset by Harry's words. “I thought you wanted this. I thought you wanted me to be a normal boyfriend.”
“Yes, there is.” Peter stood up, walking towards the hallway his bedroom was in. “And you need to chill out or else this mission will never get far. I’m getting dressed. You guys work on invitations without killing each other.”
So he grabbed his clothes, and headed into the backyard where there was a shower on the side of the pool. Thankfully, it had a stall around it so he could have some privacy for everyone in the house’s sake.
Steve raised an eyebrow as he looked up at him. "Not really. It's relaxing. Right now, I think we need that most. I invited Peter, but I think you scared him to his room forever."
"If I find out you did anything to him, I will end your entire life just like that," Tony said, snapping his fingers smoothly.
Peter wasn’t sure what Steve was thinking, but he knew it probably wasn’t good. “Mr. Stark was really against it, but both Director Fury and my aunt were okay with it. We didn’t wanna risk ruining the operation.”
“You don’t need to take me to bed like I’m a child,” Ton replied. “I’m fine here. Don’t worry about me, Rogers.”
"Because we're happily married. And I want to be close to my husband." Tony was shifting suddenly and he had his leg hooked around one of Steve's.
"Have fun in this room," he said, halfway out the doorway. "Because you're going to be stuck here until the mission's over."
Fun fact! Originally, Harry's mother was going to be alive and not know about Harry, but I decided against that literally as I wrote it and made Natasha (and eventually Bucky) his parents.
"A little too loud for you, kiddo," Tony said. "You know if you listen too long to music that's too loud, it triggers a migraine."
Steve shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe we should give it until Peter is feeling better? Just a few hours? Maybe while we're waiting we can watch a movie or something."
until this is over. Don’t think I was joking about grounding you,” he said in a voice not unlike the one he used after the ferry incident.
I had a scene written in this chapter...the pool scene...a year ago. That was the first thing written for this fic.
"So," Norman said, being the one to start a conversation. "Is this whole meal to apologize about the mall incident?"
Peter didn’t approve, but he was a little satisfied when Steve told him that he wouldn’t go through with it. Tony was going to stop him. Steve was sure of it. Peter was hesitant to let it go, but he didn’t continue to argue with him through their jog.
I've been waiting to write this chapter since last year and was so excited to finally do it!! Please enjoy :)
He didn’t have a destination in mind, but wherever it was, he was going to run the entire way there.
“I think him drinking more and more was weird enough,” Harry said with another moment of hesitation. “But he said some other stuff that I think you should ask him about. It’s not my business to tell.”
Feeling his cheeks and ears burning, he pulled his swimsuit off and threw it out of the pool behind him. "Now, can you please get in here before someone sees you? Our son's window is right there, and you know Evalyn is always looking at us."
“I’ll take you out, Pete,” Tony offered. He was glad that Peter made such a good friend while staying here, but he didn’t like that it was in a place where Tony didn’t trust a damn soul. “I don’t want you going places alone by that man. If it means staying out of town, then so be it.”
Steve wasn't even sure how he heard about that. He doubted that Harry would have told him. But this was a small community, and everyone somehow knew everything about everybody.
“What’re you two doin’?” Tony asked, turning around to stare at them with a furrowed brow. His voice was thick with sleep still, and his hair was as wild as Peter’s was before a run. Tony used to make sure he was dressed and ready for the day before he entered the kitchen. He never wanted to look anything less than put together.
"Enjoying the peace and quiet," Steve said in a low voice. Living out here was so different from the city. There was no honking or yelling this late at night. There were crickets singing and nothing else. He was going to miss it when they left.
Peter crossed his arms over his chest. “You can’t just tell me to stay away without explaining why. It’s not fair.”
He needed the bedroom to himself for just a few hours while Peter was out of the house with Steve-- or maybe he just needed Peter out of the house like he was now with Steve right there, so close, and so kissable--
Tony narrowed his eyes at Peter but didn't argue. Steve knew that Peter was probably just defending Harry at every cost.
“Wow, you’re really not a morning person, are you, Queens?” Steve started to dish out some of the scrambled eggs to Peter’s plate and then placed it in front of the sleepy teenager.
Harry had been over and having dinner with them, and he seemed surprised. Apparently, only Norman and his work friends were allowed on his boat. Peter had looked over at Tony with puppy eyes, and he immediately told Harry that he was welcome to join them on their first day on the water.
Steve yanked the keys from his hands when he pulled it out and quickly unlocked Peter. Steve pushed Peter behind him, and then he ran to Tony's side. He looked rattled, and Tony didn't blame him. Being accused wrongly of stealing and being detained was not a fun experience.
They were sitting at the kitchen table, getting breakfast ready in a comfortable silence when Tony finally joined them. It was normal for them now. Peter was just done setting the table as Steve placed food on the plates when Tony walked out, just like every morning.
"Welcome back," Barton says as Steve takes off his hat at the bottom of the stairs.  "Gotta admit, I didn't expect to see you again."
“I grew up in Brooklyn, so no, I took the bus,” Steve said.  He frowned down at the television set.  “Do you think I should have gotten a bigger one?”
Bruce blinks, a little confused, and looks toward the observation room.  When he looks back at Steve, his eyes are a little lighter.  "It worked."
“What if I needed some intel?” Tony said.  “Nothing dangerous.  Very above-board.  You free tonight?”
“I guess there’s something to be said for operating outside the law,” Steve says, and Miss Romanov treats him to a smile.
Steve glances around, then ducks into the car.  Sitwell slams the door behind him, and the tires squeal as the driver pulls away from the curb.
“Sure,” Tony said, and he was backing away into the shadows, already fading.  “Sure I can, Cap.  Sorry about all this.  About everything.  I’ll, uh - yeah.  I’ll leave you alone.”
“Somebody has to look after the place,” Natasha said, hefting her backpack and pushing past him.  “He rents it out to bachelorette parties and corporate retreats and rich guys looking for places to bring their mistresses and stuff.”
Sitwell grabs Steve by the arm and pulls him the rest of the way out of the car, and as Steve finds his footing the automobile carrying Pierce speeds away down the empty street.
“We should get to bed,” Natasha said, standing up and looking down at Bruce meaningfully.  “And maybe you should get yourself to bed too, Stark.  Before Rogers does it for you.”
“Pizza rolls do sound pretty good,” Steve said, paddling in Tony’s general direction.  “Do you think Clint has any?”
“Of course this is about last night,” Steve said.  “Forgive me for being a little off my game the day after one of my best friends decides to - ”
“They would have had time to pack up and get out by now anyway,” Sam says.  “We’re lucky we made it as fast as we did.”
“Okay,” Tony said.  “Last warning.  I’m coming in.”  He waited, hoping against hope, and then thunked his head against the door.  “JARVIS, emergency override code Stark 49059 -
“All right, all right,” Steve interrupted, hoisting himself out of the pool (and look, Tony wasn’t alone, Nat and Clint weren’t even
"Don't be smart-mouthed with me," he says, flicking her around the insides of her thighs till she jumps and yelps for mercy. Then, dropping the belt at his feet, he steps forward against her ass, soothing her skin with his rough hands as he lets her feel the full press of his erection, barely restrained through his pants, against her ass.
“ - it’s really more that I think there’s somebody alive in the world who shouldn’t be, and I’m kinda worried it might be me,” Tony blurts out.
“Nat called it a hateboner.”  Steve crossed his arms over his chest.  “It’s funny, this isn’t at all how I pictured you’d react.  I’m surprised my subconscious is getting it so wrong.”
Steve wanted to say something else, it was right there on the tip of his tongue, but in the end he just went back to his paper.  It wasn’t good form to talk to a hallucination in public, anyway.
"You know they keep track of you bureau boys, right?  They catch you so much as walking by their front door, and - "  Banner shakes his head.  "I'm sorry, but there's no way.  If your friend's still alive, you'll have to find him a different way."
“I heard that,” said Tony, who was carefully attaching a snowmaking machine to the back of the Mark XXV.
“So, welcome to the quantum realm,” Tony said.  “You want the big tour, or should we just - ?  No, yeah, we should probably go.”
to be able to tell it was fake, but if the broad smiles on their faces were any sign, they didn’t have a clue.
There’s a crowd of cameras outside the public entrance to the Stark Tower garage, and even though Tony could easily go in the back he thinks
Romanov looks at Stark, Banner, and Steve and arches an eyebrows.  "I like the kind of customers who can take care of themselves."
Steve scratched the back of his neck.  “That was a joke.  I don’t think I could have pulled a whole balloon down by myself.”
, and stays down.  Steve stumbles back toward the bar, watches as Odinson stands guard over one prone man, Stark keeps his smoking armband trained on another, and Romanov stands with her stiletto tip - pointier than Steve thinks they usually are - poised over the neck of a third.
Tony turned back to his tools and picked something up at random.  Ah, a blowtorch. Perfect, he could light himself on fire.  When had he become a 12 year old girl who couldn’t stop talking in front of the boy she liked, and also, when had he decided he officially liked Steve?
“I could say the same to you,” Stark says.  He shoves his hands in his pockets and strides out from around the bar.  Natasha sees Rogers’ eyes widen fractionally as the guns follow Stark’s movement.  “I’m serious.  I’ve seen Romanov’s books.  She’s not exactly raking it in.”
Tony can tell it costs him something to say it.  He blows out a breath and pours himself another glass.  “Yeah.  Me neither.”  He hears something behind him and whirls around to see Peter climbing down the wall from the ceiling in the direction of the bar.  “Cap, there’s a spider, quick, get it away from here, it’s underage.”
Bruce shivers a little, but doesn’t miss a step.  “Maybe you should be less interested and more afraid.”
“I mean, sure, we did Thanksgiving, but not like the kind of Thanksgiving they do in Good Housekeeping,” Steve said.  “We’d get whatever meat was cheapest, and of course there were always plenty of potatoes, and after my mom died I tried to make a pie, once, and Bucky told me it was like eating a bucket of sand, so that was the end of that.  And then there was the war, so.”  He shrugged.
Steve nods, pacified.  Beneath them, the jet hums.  Finally, he says, “You’ve never really wanted out, though.”
"You're gonna be waiting a long time, Mr. Killian," Romanov says sweetly as Barton and Odinson file into place behind her.  She slides the glass of gin across the bar, and Killian picks it up and slowly lifts it to his lips.
“Something like that,” Steve says, taking off his hat and joining them at the bar.  “You should see the other fella.”
Tony ignored him, and the pitch went wide left again, and came in at just 120 MPH, which by Steve’s standards was basically standing still.
find himself staring at him at completely random times and sometimes gets the feeling Steve’s staring back -
“It’s your cross to bear.  Wow, your cock looks amazing,” Steve said, and wrapped his mouth around it.
“Do you think eating four thousand calories in one sitting is good for your health?” Clint said, leaning back in his seat with a groan.  “Because if not, I probably shouldn’t do any PSAs either.”
“We were training when Friday told us another elemental had shown up.  Well, Parker and I were training.  Cap was breaking punching bags,” Sam says, nodding in the direction of the jet overhead.  “Speaking of, I think he’s about ready to head back to the city.  You need a ride home, Spiderman?”
“Somewhere else,” Tony snaps, pushing himself up from the pilot’s seat.  “You think you can just do something like that and, what, walk away and break in a few more reinforced punching bags, call it a day?”
They set up in the Tower instead, turn all the lights back on and dust off the old equipment.  Most of it has been empty save for a few floors that housed the energy projects and the Maria Stark Foundation, and opening it up again feels like acknowledging that things are different all over again.
“What a tragedy.”  Tony wandered into the kitchen after him, swirling the dregs of a glass of wine.  “I get it, though.  I mean look, I emailed my accountant today.  Stupid, right?  If we survive long enough to pay taxes next year, I’ll happily give the IRS whatever it wants - hell, I’ll write them a thank you card for it.  But it was kind of nice to do something… banal.”
"Not one I'm interested in getting into," Stark says.  He takes a swig of whiskey.  "We didn't make such a bad team here.  Whaddya think, Romanov, want to get all of us on the payroll?"
Coulson looks around blandly.  “I can see that,” he says.  “I’m not here for a drink.  I’m here to talk about your future.”
Now that he's said his name, Steve recognizes the man from the papers.  "Industrialist?  That what they're calling war profiteers these days?"
“That was fast,” Odinson says, poking his head into the storeroom.  “I thought we’d have a riot on our hands; we’re out of gin up front.”
But Steve doesn’t seem to notice: he’s digging into his sixth taco and talking about some vacation him and Wanda went on to Ohio (Ohio!  On vacation!  Who
.  He wants to go back further and get it all right with Thanos, years ago, so none of this ever happened in the first place.
“You said it, not me,” Tony said, and splashed Steve right in the face before he could get all moody-drunk about it.
"Always said I wasn't here on business," Steve says.  "I don't have a problem with your establishment myself, ma'am.  Don't care much about temperance, and driving it all underground just created space for the likes of Killian to get even more powerful.  The bureau would love to get something on him."
“That’ll be all,” Pierce says, opening up a file on his desk and not sparing another glance for Steve.
Tony slid under the covers and settled himself on half of Steve’s pillow with a contented sigh.  “It’s no Tempur-Pedic, but it’ll do.”
The rushing died away, and Steve turned to look at Tony, trudging along behind him with his hands in his pockets.
They talk about work, and the team, and they spend a decent chunk of time making fun of Fury, which is pastime Tony can finally admit he really missed during the years Nick was dead.  When the check comes, Steve pays, which Tony finds kind of hilarious considering he’s the team’s only current benefactor, but also kind of sweet, so he doesn’t say anything.
.  Steve liked pretty much anything that came out of the microwave, from popcorn to entire pot pies, not because it necessarily tasted good but because it was
"Put your mouth somewhere useful," Natasha tells him, and pushes him to the floor, where he hikes up her silk skirt, slowly, fingers skating over her creamy thighs. She winds one leg over his shoulder and uses it to pull him towards her, closing her eyes in pleasure as he gently mouths the satin covering her mound, dampening it, outlining her soft folds with his tongue. Thor crowds her against the bar, pressing his forehead to hers, trading slow, leisurely kisses with her as he undoes her blouse and runs his fingers under the straps of her brassiere.
The line at Hot Dog On a Stick was blessedly short, and by the time Clint had scarfed down his corn dog Tony had a plan.  “We’re sticking together and clearing one store at a time, all right?  You guys know how to search an area for a target, that knowledge is buried in there somewhere, let’s dig it out, all right?”
There’s a lot of confusion from the media about what went down in Atlantic City, but the one thing everyone can agree on is that Tony Stark screwed it up.
“You know, some of us kinda like your face the way it is,” Tony says.  “We’d prefer it didn’t get trashed again by a bunch of assholes with inferiority complexes.”
“And the Black Widow once again proves herself a competent thief!” Thor rumbled from the commentator’s box up behind home plate.  “The score is six to five, with the Winter Soldier holding the bat.”
Still.  Tony’s also… if not exactly one of the good guys, maybe not quite one of the bad guys, either.  Steve slides out of bed, careful not to disturb the other man, and follows the trail of clothes back to the french doors.  He opens them gently and steps into the early-morning sunlight.
Tony looked down and realized he was standing, frozen, mostly undressed but with his thumbs under the elastic of his boxers.  “No, I don’t care if you - ”
in his eyes, kind of like when they were training and Tony knocked him down, and Cap popped right back up and said,
The Ukrainian woman behind the counter doesn't even look up as Steve passes through the deli the next day, and Steve has to hand it to Miss Romanov: she's bold as brass, running a barely-operating sandwich shop above a speakeasy in the smack dab middle of Midtown.  It's so obviously a front, Steve thinks, that people must assume it's
“There’s nothing wrong with them,” Tony said, getting out of the elevator on Nat and Clint’s floor.  “What I’m worried about is that something is a little too
“Hi, it’s me,” Tony says, and winces.  “Tony.  I probably should have called, but uh, it’s - are you free?  To talk.  It’s - important.”
“We actually aren’t - I guess we’re done,” Steve says as Tony opens the cupboard above the bar.  “Rhodey, Wanda, let’s regroup on Xandar tomorrow.”
“Nope,” Steve says.  “I was thinking maybe we could take Morgan to Coney Island.  Buy her cotton candy, take her on all the rides, win a giant stuffed animal - I’m pretty good at those arcade games, you know.”
“Were you hoping for something a little more spectacular?” Miss Romanov says, slipping out from under Steve’s arm and adjusting her blouse.
When Steve let himself in through the back door one hot summer night after one of his forays down to the water, Tony was waiting for him in the kitchen.
“Real smooth, Stark,” Steve smirked, and leaned across the table to press a bacon-y soft kiss to Tony’s lips.
--has undone her men's collared shirt and tuxedo tie and rolled up her sleeves to reveal brown, lithe forearms, a tantalizing peep of bronzed neck. Not a hint of a tan line to be seen. Drunk as she is most of the time, her intimidating aura protects her like the great golden nimbus of awareness and fear that cloaks a leopard on its branch. Natasha has never seen a man approach Valkyrie, despite her considerable beauty. She's wearing her hair slicked back like a jazz dancer, a question mark-like curl shellacked to her forehead, and the mole on her neck bobs every time she catches Natasha looking at her.
“We’re really not,” Steve said, and waited until Bruce was out of sight to stack up the plates nearest him.
“Oh, I know,” Tony says.  “But I thought - well, without the shield, you’re - you deserve it, all right?  And they should know that.  Everybody should.”
“I beg to differ,” Tony says.  “It’s tight in here, sure, but shift that barrel over and we’ll have plenty of room, and I don’t mind scuffing up my knees one bit - ”
“That’s not what I said,” Steve says.  “I do think about it, and I always come back to the same answer: we did what we had to do.”
Steve twists one of the goon’s arm behind his back until he gives, then throws him into a nearby table.  “Don’t forgive me just yet, fellas.  I’m afraid I may have led them here.”
From inside the room, Thor, who was laying on her bed - fully clothed, thank god - waved cheerily.  “Greetings.”
Tony swapped out his standard catcher’s mitt for a gauntlet as Barnes swung his reinforced bat casually from one hand and adjusted his ballcap with the other.  The rest of them all wore helmets, even the Hulk - not because he needed it, but because Tony’d designed one special and Bruce thought it was hilarious - but Bucky had argued that under official MLB rules he would have been grandfathered into the pre-helmet era, and anyway they’d all seen actual
me to do anything,” Natasha says.  “It’s my business that’s being threatened.  I’ve got just as much skin in the game as any of you.”
“It was truly a feast to be remembered,” Thor said warmly, standing up and taking the last half-full bottle of wine with him.  “I repeat, a
“I’m serious,” Tony says.  “Not about the money - I mean I am making money off it, maybe I should stop making money off it, is making money off recovery as bad as making money off weapons?  I don’t know, I’ll have to think about it - but I mean about it all starting with me.  If it hadn’t been for me, most of the terrible stuff that’s happened wouldn’t have happened.”
“Glad to hear it,” Pierce says.  The door next to Steve opens, and Steve looks out to see Sitwell.  “I hope we don’t have to have another chat again soon.  Oh, and son?”
Steve adjusted the shield and straightened his cowl and walked straight up to Santa Claus, fat and jolly as always in his chair at the head of the room.  “May I?” he said politely.
After Happy dropped them at Columbus Circle - “Just drive around the block, and send up a flare if you see any paparazzi or kids who look like they might grow up to save the world” - Tony led the boys into the bustling shopping center.  “Okay, so where do teenagers hang out at the mall?”
He winds his way south next, spends a couple of nights in the hills of southern Tennessee, then rents a cabin in the Ozarks and spends the days hiking through the empty woods and the nights curled up in a rocking chair with a scratchy blanket, trying to focus on the stars.
“I do remember,” Tony said, trying valiantly to ignore the idea of Steve naked because as nice as that was it definitely wasn’t helpful right now.  “Kind of.  Most of it, I think.  The important parts.”
“There’s gonna be a party tomorrow night out on Long Island.  Big house on the water, lots of obnoxious rich people.  Tons of booze.  Enough to get even you drunk.”
But when he looked across home plate, he could tell that Steve… was about to throw another terrible pitch.  Damn it.
Several people, including Killian, scramble toward the exit, and Tony shoots off several rounds in their direction; a few others turn back to their opponents, but now that their numbers are smaller, the team - Steve’s team - can go on the offensive rather than just trying to stay alive, and before long they’re going down like flies, Natasha taking one with a knife to the shoulder and Barton shooting a gun right out of another’s hands.  Thor and Banner together take down one of the big men, and as he slumps to the floor Steve takes stock of the room, wondering how much firepower Tony can possibly have in that thing, where Barton is on bullets, how much time they have until -
Steve quickly recounts his drive with Pierce and its aftermath, and when he’s done they all look at him expectantly.
“Those PSAs undermine themselves,” Steve said.  “Who knows if that stuff we’re telling them is even accurate?  When I was a kid, they said cigarettes were good for our health.”
“Well, it seems to have a plug of some sort,” Steve said, crawling out from behind the TV set.  “But I used to fly Quinjets and operate time machines, so I think I might be able to figure it out.”
"Ma'am," Banner says.  His gaze drops to his feet, and Natasha would feel sorry for him if she hadn't seen him nearly kill a man with his bare hands the night before.  She wonders vaguely which half of him is an act.
People want to go home to their families, and go out and celebrate, and think about anything else for a while because finally,
need you,” Pepper says, and he wishes she was angry at him, but she just sounds disappointed.  “We always need you.”
“Don’t kill him!” Steve called as Clint tore out of the kitchen cackling and Thor chased after him.   “I like Clint quite a bit and also I don’t know what we would do if we had to take Thor in, we don’t have anyone strong enough to do it, it’s actually something I worry about once in a whi - ”
“So do you know how long we’re going to be like this?” Bruce asked, pushing his too-large glasses up his nose.
It wasn’t anything Steve hadn’t thought before, but hearing it in Tony’s voice was especially galling.  “Fuck you.”
“Yeah, but still,” Tony says.  “Hey, how’s the sound quality on this thing?  It’s in R&D, but I think I’m pushing it to manufacturing next week.”
Tony’s already had a few too many drinks when Nicola Blake saunters up to him and says, “Long time no see.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, “you, too,” and then he grinned, and Steve - for once - didn’t mind that it made him crazy.
“Sorcerer Supreme, remember?” Strange says, arching an eyebrow.  “Plus, it’s written all over your face.  You’re not nearly as good at hiding things as you think you are.”
Tony texts him an address in the middle of the night, and Steve isn't sleeping anyway so he gets on his bike and rides.  He makes it to the small town in New Hampshire just as the sun comes up and parks in the driveway of the sprawling farmhouse, behind an old camper van that looks like it hasn't moved in decades.  He sits on the front porch and waits, and only two cars go by in the three hours before Iron Man slips out of stealth mode and sets down in the pasture next to the barn.
Fury arches an eyebrow.  “Is this how you conduct team meetings these days, Captain?  Start off with baked goods?”
“You have literally no idea what you’re talking about, but sure,” Tony says.  “So what was the last straw?”
He picks up his hat and nods at Miss Romanov, who stares coolly back at him, and heads for the door.  “Yeah, you too, pal,” he hears Barton grumble, and he doesn’t look back.
“She asked so nicely,” Steve says.  Behind the counter, he reaches out and brushes Tony’s hand with his.  “Hope you don’t mind that I took over pancake duty.”
“Christmas, Thanksgiving, and all of our birthdays, just in case we mess up and erase the rest of the year from existence,” Clint said.
"I would," Steve says.  "And what you did, in his service - what was done to you - it's not as important as the decisions you make.
“I’m getting bored, actually,” Peter says, tossing the vase from one hand to the other.  “Wanna go throw them off the balcony for me?”
“Thor went out the back way, he’s bringing the car around.  I left Banner collecting samples in the lab, he’ll be here any second.  You hear Stark’s gun go off?”
“Possibly,” Thor said.  “But if I call Heimdall looking like this when he knows me as a grown warrior, I’ll never hear the end of it.  I’m sure it’ll wear off soon enough.”
Tony rolled onto his side, propped himself up on his elbow.  “I could write a whole book on it.  I’m probably the world’s foremost expert, besides Janet van Dyne.”
“Sam always wants to go faster,” Steve said.  “He won’t stop asking for more power until he can go as fast as you.”
“Yeah, you did,” Steve said.  “And just a head’s up, telling someone about how many other first kisses you’ve had literally
clear signal.  “So, look, I don’t want to be presumptuous or anything, but do you want to maybe come to my room to keep talking about this?”
sound, but doesn't break.  Stark looks down at it and whistles softly.  "That's quite a grip you've got there, Captain," he says in a low voice, and when Steve meets his gaze it feels like Stark can see everything he's thinking, all the way down.
They all scramble behind the bar, holding their breaths.  The Ukrainian couple, God help them, gave them twenty, maybe thirty seconds.  They’ve got enough ammunition back here to keep a standard Prohibition Unit squad busy for a while, and they can buy their patrons time to run for it, give Natasha’s tenants up above (all of whom have some reason or another to run from the law) a chance to grab what they can and scramble away.
There aren't good days anymore but this is a particularly bad one, and at the end of the fight one of the kids is dead and a couple more are hurt.  The NYPD comes in to clean the scene up and Steve watches unflinchingly as they march the kids that can still walk into the back of a van and take the body away.
"I'm asking you guys to do it," Bruce says, leaning forward.  "I need to know.  If I can still - if I'm useful."
"Not yet," Odinson says.  He slides Steve a glass across the bar as, in the corner, a three-piece jazz band starts warming up.
Banner takes off his glasses and wipes them on his handkerchief.  “Well, I’ve already beaten one mob thug to a pulp this week, so I guess it’s in for a penny, in for a pound.”
,” Steve hissed.  He grabbed Tony’s shoulders and spun them a quarter-turn.  “Pretend you’re looking at me.  Look over my shoulder.  Are you looking?”
“Okay, this is getting real dark real fast,” Tony interrupted, and Steve slumped down into his seat.  “Does anybody have any ideas?”
They climbed into the quantum ship, and Steve pulled the hatch shut and turned to the controls to send the signal up to the others.
At one point, Natasha inexplicably burst into tears, and all of them stared at her in paralyzed, abject horror until she ran to her bedroom.  Tony had JARVIS delete all footage from local and backup servers, and made the boys swear never to mention it again, which they did without question.
All of which to say Tony shouldn’t have been surprised when Clint looked ready to sacrifice him at the altar of Top Chef Masters when he mentioned that he didn’t do Thanksgiving.
And Steve, who was, frankly, exhausted of Tony’s commentary, said, “Not as often as you’d think, all things considered.”
a different shape than it was before.  Everybody did good work.  Even Stark with his stupid exploding bracelet.”
Stark swirls his glass and takes a sip.  "You were Army in the war.  Commissioned officer, obviously - what were you, first lieutenant?"
Steve shrugged, and anybody else would have thought it looked casual.  “No harm done.  We never set any consequences, after all.  Totally your call.”
The reporter’s eyes widen, and then everyone’s yelling again, but Tony just rolls up his window and drives into his subterranean garage with a huge, shit-eating grin on his face.
Natasha shrugs carefully.  “We’re an establishment operating outside external influence.  We’ve always got a target on our back.”
by the time he slides into his seat at the head of the table with Barnes on his heels.  Nebula, on holo from Knowhere, is describing some race of aliens who are claiming they’ve found a way to travel through time.  Their methods aren’t anything like the quantum machine’s, and Tony hasn’t heard of half the technology they’re talking about but if he’s understanding correctly (which he definitely is, he’s a genius) they’re full of shit and nothing to worry about.
“Nobody’s saying another word,” Tony says.  “Jameson, do I need to remove you, or are you removing yourself?”
“As much as I appreciate the implication that I can read your mind, you’ll need to be more specific, sir,” JARVIS said.
“Well, after fifteen years as coworkers things can get pretty heated around the water cooler.  Don’t you have an essay due in twelve hours?”
Stark’s house is huge.  He’d seen that from the outside, of course, but somehow it seems even bigger up on the second floor, with its endless hallways full of doors and not one of them, apparently, containing a linen closet.  He wonders what it would be like to live in a house where you couldn’t hear somebody calling to you from one end to the other.  Steve can’t remember the last time he’s been far enough away from his nearest neighbor not to hear them sneeze.
“You were a weird kid,” Steve said, nudging the console to the left.  “Back in my day, we would have been happy to have a cardboard box to play with.”
Nowadays, Peggy woke him up sometimes, but Peggy was gone a lot and when she was home she was usually exhausted, so Steve woke himself up, gulping for breath and even more tired than when he’d gone to sleep.
, Stark,” he says.  “We let you walk out of here, and nobody’s the wiser about that missing shipment of Stark Industrial weapons that ended up in Germany in the middle of the war.”
“I have no idea what that’s supposed to mean,” Steve says levelly, after the silence has gone on long enough that he can tell Tony’s not going to fill it.
Tony braces; he’s not that high up, but it’s still a shock when he hits the ground.  The suit’s interior bracings hold and he’ll be sore tomorrow, but that’s not the worst of it: his system’s completely fried.  And his backup systems and the armor’s hibernating nanobots, built for exactly this purpose to repair fuses on the go, take almost five minutes to get even partially back online; Beck will be gone by then.
“It’ll work,” Stark says confidently, and Natasha adjusts her estimation of him: he’s even smarter than she thought.  “So Romanov, what’s this Barton tells me about Schmidt’s boys stopping by?”
Stark appears in the center of the crowd with a grin, and Steve grins back.  “I’m only here to shut this place down.”
.  Over the course of his life Tony’s wanted freedom, and safety, and guarantees, and validation, and love, and more, more, always
“It did, didn’t it,” Beck says, so flatly that the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stand up.  “You know, it’s funny.  I had all these plans for what I was going to say to you, but now that it’s here I just have one question: why’d you do it?”
“Even though everyone knows speeches are important prior to a battle,” Thor said.  “Just like feasts.”
“Captain America,” Tony said, sounding scandalized.  “Are you taking financial advantage of your knowledge of the future?”
There’s a roar, and before Steve can blink Banner’s ripped the pistol from the man’s hands and thrown it across the room.  “Don’t even
“You can't fix what happened, and you can't ever make up for it.  So what's the point of sticking around?  What's the
He pulls up the video from Venice again, watches the water monster play out at half speed.   It was fake; it
Banner stops short when he sees her.  A raggedy towel is draped around his neck.  "Hello," she says.
“I don’t think we know as much about Clint as we thought we did,” Tony said.  “Speaking of!  Clint, who’s your tiny soap vendor?”
Steve sways; it doesn't hurt bad, but he's distracted for long enough that the switchblade swings up and catches him in the shoulder.  Pain blossoms down his arm, and the man holding the knife yanks it out and prepares another blow -
“Maybe we should talk about your fashion sense,” Tony said.  “That’s already an embarrassing topic for you, how much worse can it get?”
It started out with little snatches of Tony's voice. He'd hear him, sometimes, while he was working in the basement with the bandsaw, or digging up the yard for Peggy's roses.  “Ugh,” the figment of his imagination would say, “honestly, I know they’re in style now, but I’m still
“You didn’t?” Tony said.  He felt like he was missing something.  Oh, right.  His drink.  Steve had taken it away from him, the bastard.  He wondered if he could steal it back.  Steve’s reflexes were good, sure, but Tony was almost certainly more determined -
It is, in the end, actually a relief to hear it said.  Well, almost said.  Tony releases a breath he’s been holding ever since Thanos faded to ash at his feet.  He thinks distantly that when he came here, he’d wanted nothing more than for Strange to tell him he was supposed to be dead, but now that he knows it for sure, he desperately wants to
“I hope you brought some cash,” Natasha said.  She was chewing gum and holding up a Little Mermaid t-shirt as if checking for size.
crazy.  Steve Rogers had met a lot of crazy people in his life, and he definitely wasn’t perfect, but he wasn’t one of them.
“That doesn’t make him any less of a dick,” Tony says.  “It’s not your job to convince everyone what we did was right.”
The man glances at his boss.  Miss Romanov’s done her hair differently and the kohl around her eyes makes her look like someone else entirely; even if they’d heard of the Black Widow, they wouldn’t recognize its mistress.  She gives the goons a smile so demure that even Steve himself nearly forgets about the knives hidden in her garter belt.
Steve pulls the sheet up over both of them and settles in.  “I’ll sleep with you without a fight first, you know.”
She notices, in a clinical sort of way, that Banner has left his hat at the bar. She's not going to run it up after him. She's not going to get involved. Banner may be tall, and he may have the lips of a Roman statue, but that doesn't mean Natasha is going to go upending her life to be his minder. He can help them cut the mob down to size and then be on his merry way, and that's fine with Natasha. That's perfectly fine.
“Which one is Xandar, again?” Tony says, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “Pink people or purple people?”
“Please don’t be all wise and mature at me,” Tony says.  “It’s scary and it makes me feel old and I hate it.”
Three weeks after the raid gone wrong in Queens, Steve's flat on his back on a shag carpet on the floor of an apartment outside Chicago.  He's writhing against the mingled pleasure-pain of Tony, about to wring orgasm number three out of him, two fingers buried inside him and mouth wrapped loosely around the head of Steve's cock.
“Yeah, I have a quote for Mr. J. Jonah Jameson,” Tony says.  He takes a deep breath.  “He’s welcome to criticize all he wants, free speech and power of the press and all that, I hang out with Captain America, I know the first amendment.  This investigation, whatever it is, that’s all just talk, and I know exactly what it will turn up and what the results will be.  But here’s the thing.  To Jameson and anybody else who wants to do more than just talk, who wants to put on a suit - a
“Can we watch I Love Lucy?” Tony said, leaning forward attentively.  “Hang on, let me get a magnifying glass.”
it about?” Tony said, leaning forward.  “Seriously, Cap, what is it about being honest that makes you so uncomfortable?”
“You jumped out of a plane to get away from him, and then he jumped out after you,” Peter says, raising his eyebrows.  “It wasn’t, like, the most casual thing ever.”
Steve doesn’t reply.  He holds the cigarette to his lips, breathes deep and blows the smoke out into the darkness.
Tony catches up just as Steve’s pouring himself a drink that looks pretty strong considering he can’t get drunk.  “How’s it going?”
They haven’t seen each other in the three days since Steve kissed him goodbye the morning after that first night, and it’s not that Tony
“I guess I can take comfort in that, at least,” Steve says.  “Could you point me in the direction of the nearest subway station?”
cook - in the 30s and 40s food didn’t just appear magically after a quick phone call, apparently, so Steve could fry eggs and steam vegetables and cobble together spaghetti and meatballs, and everybody knew he made a mean roast beef sandwich and always ate like seven of them immediately after a mission.
“I’m sure it wasn’t,” Stark says.  He takes off his glasses and walks up to his clockwork man, fiddles a little with its wrist, and then drops it with a
“It better be, considering I stepped out of a meeting with the Secretary of Defense to answer it,” Rhodey replied.
And when he woke up Steve wasn’t sure when he’d been awake and when he’d been asleep - but really, it didn’t matter much either way.
“I guess if we could, I wouldn’t show up unannounced in the middle of the night,” Tony said.  “On the other hand, there are some side benefits.  Do you always sleep naked?”
“If it weren’t for me,” Pierce says slowly, like he’s explaining to a child, “the darker elements of this city would overwhelm it.  The mobsters and the criminals, the drunks and the whores - they’d take over the whole damn thing.  And we don’t want that, do we?”
“There’s still a lot of work left,” Natasha says.  “But I think we’ll be open in a couple of weeks.”
“Are you serious?” Tony says.  “God, I knew you were a hypocrite but this, this is a new one, you literally
The shareholders go crazy; Tony’s glad Pepper isn’t the CEO anymore, because she’d have throttled him for it.  These days, she runs the Maria Stark Foundation with the same efficiency with which she operated Stark Industries, and they stop talking about work, mostly, because it keeps the fights to a minimum.
“Maybe I just have more skin in the game than I used to, all right? The people I love - the people I care about usually end up paying a bigger price than they signed up for,” Tony says, soldiering on like if he talks fast enough they can both pretend they didn’t hear it.  “People like Beck, they’re not going to stop.”
“That’s two visits in a week from different organizations,” Rogers says.  “You sure there’s no cause for concern?”
“Well, wasn’t that a wonderful use of a time out,” Thor rumbled from the commentator’s box.  “Steve, Tony, from the bottom of our hearts, we’re so happy to see you finally pull your heads out of your respective asses.  Well done both of you.  Now can we get back to baseball?  Frankly we all know I’m just here for the afterparty, so if we wouldn’t mind proceeding?  Thank you.”
“Not much,” Steve says.  “Just that it went a different way once before, and he wished it hadn’t.  So he changed it for us.”
The mob looks pissed, and Steve looks tense, but he’s replying to them calmly even as the crowd grows more agitated and then - Tony flinches - and then somebody takes a swing, hits him right in the jaw and falls back rubbing their fist, but then somebody else swipes at him, and another, and somebody has a baseball bat, and the video shakes wildly and then goes black.
“Thought they’d try to beat the rush and collect what their boss is due,” Natasha says.  “It’s nothing to worry about.  We handled them.”  One of them had left with a broken nose, and the other a dislocated shoulder; it would have gone even worse for them if Natasha hadn’t been concerned about tearing her last good pair of hose.
“Is that it?” Stark says into the darkness, and Steve’ll be damned if the man doesn’t sound disappointed.
“Yeah, what’s that about?” Clint says, pouring his own glass of liquor from Tony’s supply.  “Those guv’mint guys who showed up didn’t seem real interested in questioning any of us, did they?  Just took the bodies and disappeared real fast.”
, and Steve just smiles at him and finishes his drink, and eventually they give up on the footage and Steve says good night and goes back to his place in Brooklyn, which is exactly what Tony expected to happen and totally, completely, 100% fine.
Tony stared at his phone.  He’d typed up and deleted at least twelve texts - different greetings, different wordings, there had even been some emojis in a couple drafts, ugh.  Who was he?  Why was this happening?  He hated everything.
Then it’s the work of a few hours to get everything in place.  There are photos to doctor and paparazzos to tip off and bellmen to bribe, but by the late afternoon Twitter is abuzz with a rumor that Tony Stark has just been ejected from the casino floor at Borgata in Atlantic City for being drunk and disorderly.  Ten minutes later, some girl from exit 6 posts an Insta story featuring several blurry shots of a man who
And Tony wants to argue, but Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him close and Tony decides he doesn’t really mind at all.
The boys - her boys, Natasha thinks, a bit too fondly for her own liking - are clustered together, drawing glances from plenty of women (and a few men) and not even noticing in the slightest.  Thor’s regaling Banner and Stark with a story from his time as a sailor, his voice booming even in the busy crowd.  Rogers, his hands clenched around around a drink he hasn’t touched, is looking amused at something Clint’s saying; Natasha knows perfectly well that Clint’s been planning to get Rogers drunk enough to spill all his FBI secrets, and though she suspects that there isn’t enough booze in all of New York, she looks forward to watching him try.
The room was as quiet as a room with teenagers in it could be, which Tony knew was not good news.  Well.  If you were one of the teenagers in question, it was
“Yeah, we’re done here,” Tony calls out, and everyone spins toward him.  “Cut the cameras and get out of my house.”
“No, me neither,” Tony said, though he wasn’t convinced.  “Pull back for a second.  Macro level.  People brush their teeth where they live, right?”
First of all, there was the basic fact that the Avengers were, to put it mildly, a little competitive.  They had all chosen to use their very specific set of skills to bash people's heads in for a living, and that wasn't the kind of decision generally made by well-adjusted people who enjoyed a quiet Friday night in with a book.  And when they were on the battlefield, there was no such thing as "just a game": there was winning, and there was losing, and losing wasn't really an option.
Tony, who thinks about such a scenario pretty much every night before he goes to sleep, winces.  “We would address that through the criminal justice system just like we always have,” Steve says, and his voice is steady but Tony can tell the questions are wearing him down.
“He’s got a beautiful place in Connecticut with his new wife,” Nicola says, her smile bright and almost believable.  “Kid on the way.  I’ll be godmother, they say.”
“A little bit,” Steve said.  “But then I stopped hating you and started falling in love with you oh my
“It comes and goes,” Tony said.  “I have, you know, a lot of time to myself.  Time to think.  So that’s good and bad.  Mostly bad, if I’m honest.  I don’t know how all of this shakes out for me, in the end.  Or even if there is an end.  I’m kind of like Schrodinger's cat at the moment, so mostly I’m just trying not to look in the box.”
.  Steve shakes his head.  It’s all well and good for some fellas, he supposes, the rich and the artists and the people who haven’t signed themselves up to work for the United States of America.  Tony can be reckless if he wants; Tony
Of course, “an ongoing hallucination of my dead teammate-turned-enemy-turned-friend” wasn’t even that big of a deal, not on a list that included “how to time travel”, “the existence of aliens” and “the entire future”, but it didn’t help.
Stark runs a hand along the bannister.  “I don’t come out here much anymore.  It’s a shame to leave it empty, but - ”  He shrugs.  “Cellar’s a great place to store hooch, anyway.  Oh, hey, I have something for you.”
Banner laughs, and Natasha realizes with a shiver that it sounds more like a growl.  "Nobody can help me," he says.  "But yeah, sure.  I'll talk to him.  Sure."
“Didn’t you feel me?” Tony said slowly.  “I was - when I touched you, it felt warm.  I thought you could - are you sure you didn’t feel me?”
“Thor, toss me one of those,” Clint said, and when Thor threw a chip, Clint caught it in his mouth.  “What’s that mean, sometimes?”
A whole bed is a luxury; Steve’s made do in bathrooms and on blankets on the ground, bachelor studios with single beds pressed against the wall, moving slowly and carefully so the squeaking doesn’t raise any eyebrows the next morning at breakfast.  Steve can hear the party through the open doors but it’s distant now, just the buzz of voices and mosquitoes in the stuffy summertime air.  Stark’s hand works steadily between them, sliding them together roughly, and the heat of him makes Steve bite his lip.
Steve marches behind the bar and straight into the storeroom.  It’s small and dusty and mostly empty - Natasha doesn’t keep a lot of inventory on hand, for obvious reasons - and Steve’s all ready to give Tony a piece of his mind when Tony grabs him by the front of his jacket, shoves him up against the wall, and kisses him.
It’s not the most enthusiastic response to a dinner invite that Tony’s ever heard, but he’ll take it.  “Great.  8 o’clock.  See you then?”
Steve stifles a yawn.  “It’s no bother, Miss Hill,” he says, rifling through the stacks of paper on his desk.  “I’ve got them for you right here.”
The bartender, who just moments before had been minding his own business watching the Vikings game, stares open-mouthed.
“Son of a bitch,” Sam says, and Barnes throws up his hands, and Tony laughs harder than he should and he can’t put his finger on why.
“We don’t all have the money and the status to convince people to look the other way,” Steve says, and Tony doesn’t try to argue, because it’s true.  “All I’ve got is my career, and if I lose that, I’ll have no way to get to Bucky.”
“I’ve been very clear about the question, Rhodey, oh my god, why the resistance?  Do you not love me anymore?”
Except right now the data was behaving very oddly.  Because if he was reading it correctly - and he always was - Steve Rogers was...
"Once or twice," Steve says, accepting a full glass from Miss Romanov even though he knows it won't dull the pain.
“And considering we might be facing certain doom later today,” Steve said, dishing eggs out onto a plate, “and, you know, I try really hard these days not to go to my death leaving things unsaid, lesson learned, right?”
, he knows there’s no reason to get caught up in something like that, it’s risky in the best of circumstances and these certainly aren’t the best of circumstances, but -
.  He was, at various intervals, an uptight asshole, absolutely hilarious, kind of staggeringly impressive, and dead fucking depressing.  And to make it all
The problem was that he was hiding a lot of things, and in the end, he realized, so was she. They had a small number of safe topics: Steve talked to Peggy about his job, and the books he was reading, and the rose garden that was ostensibly hers but which he cared for, most of the time, because she was always busy and he wasn’t.  They talked about the war, about the people they’d both known, some of whom were dead and the rest of whom they didn’t see anymore, because they all thought Steve was.
, that didn’t change the fact that he was now supervising a tower full of hormonal, pimpled, unbelievably obnoxious teenagers.
Steve can tell by the wave of sound that hits him as soon as he hits the stairs that it's crowded tonight.  Some of the Black Widow's patrons have clearly been partaking of Miss Romanov's high-quality hooch for a while already, and the air is thick with smoke that gives the light a hazy sort of glow around the edges.
Tony hits the air as the guy slams a tentacle into the street.  Asphalt flies, and a few spectators run away screaming, clutching their phones in their hands.  “I said to back away!” Tony yells at them, shooting a rocket at the tentacle.  “Seriously, people in New York are crazy, if we’re not careful, photobombing the Avengers is going to become a huge meme - ”
"Oh no, nothing so boring," Natasha says, smiling and running her nails gently down his belly. "Clint and I have an arrangement. A mutually satisfactory agreement. He likes to watch, and I like to play. Neither of us are into jealousy. Or pain," she clarifies, withdrawing her nails. "But I can see you're ill at ease, so I'll let you take your shower."
?  Attention, sure, these guys always wanted attention, but it never ended there.  What was the goal?  What did they
Steve sighed heavily.  “Tony, I left the toothbrush there three months ago on accident.  It didn’t mean anything.”
“If you’re actually an adult, you probably have an ID,” Natasha pointed out.  “You can buy your own beer.”
Somebody has apparently gotten tired of eating pizza at team meetings - “That’s what happens when you let Steve order dinner every time, folks, the man has the metabolism of a fourteen year old boy” - and the kitchen is full of nothing but salads, so ultimately everybody is grateful for the store-bought cookies from May.  Peter’s telling Tony a story about his astrophysics professor and his complete misunderstanding of the relationship between propulsion and distance in space but he can’t say
“He has unrestricted access to the penthouse and found her about to spill an entire gallon of milk,” Friday says by way of explanation.
“What Beck’s doing, what Jameson’s doing, we can’t fix it all,” Steve says.  “We can only do our best.  You know who told me that?  You.”
Tony locks his feet together and punches the hyperboost.  It’s a little shaky with the nanobots still repairing his stabilizers, but it holds.  “Friday, do you have a lock on him?”
The thing about grief is that it’s not linear.  It can ebb away long enough to let you get out of bed, go for a run, meet up with somebody in a vacant McMansion outside Charlotte, leave again in the morning before they wake up.  Even grief so big you can’t wrap your mind around it lets you take a breather, once in a while.
Suddenly he feels out of place.  The old feeling rises up inside him, familiar and well-worn in the time since the Blip, like the version of him sitting here can’t possibly be the real one.  He’s a replacement, obviously, a photocopy, because the real Tony Stark isn’t the kind of guy who sits too close to Steve Rogers on a bench in Brooklyn, hoping against hope that he isn’t trying to hold his hand but also kind of hoping that he is -
“See you in a minute,” Tony says, and Steve’s gone.  “All right, return in five, four, three, two - ”
"Well, there was nothing good on TV," Steve mutters as Tony paws at his shirt, presses wet kisses to his neck and his collarbone.  "Were you at a party tonight?"
Going to the park involves getting Happy out to do recon and security, and two Avengers in one public place is still enough to get the public pretty amped up, but after a couple of rounds of selfies the crowd disperses.  Morgan’s used to it, anyway, and she barely notices the cameras once she’s on the swings.
“I just find it interesting,” Jameson says, “that a man who claims to be a symbol of liberty, justice, and the American way brought back
noise, like a bunch of balloons exploding all at once, and Tony was suddenly surrounded by five adult Avengers.
Only a couple people get hurt, but the Rialto Bridge is seriously damaged and after the dozens of clear-as-crystal StarkPhone videos are uploaded to YouTube all the headlines ask: “So Where Were The Avengers?”
Steve shot him a glare.  “Right,” he said tersely.  “All right, team, get cleaned up and meet back here in thirty minutes.”
Tony raps his fingers on the wheel of the Audi and wonders if he should have parked the car and gone to Steve’s front door instead of texting him.  Would that have been better?  But ugh, then Barnes might have been there, and dealing with himself and Steve and this whole
It’s only fifteen minutes before they hear the door from the deli swing open, and they all go quiet until Clint and Thor thunder down the steps.
The destruction is complete, and removing the rubble will be a months-long job, but more than that nobody really wants to look at it ever again.  Tony tells people it’s because of how it all went down there, but they all know that really, it’s because in the end, it was Natasha’s.  She kept the place going when the rest of them couldn’t take it; she ran missions out of the command center when everybody else gave up; she called it home when the rest of them walked away.
Clint mostly seemed to be looking for any videos of himself.  Eventually he switched to skateboarding videos, online poker games, and a bunch of hidden results that Tony had to assume was a
,” Tony corrected, “so you guys are gonna need to tell me what the deal is.  You need something, I’ll take care of it, but you have to tell me.  All right?  That’s how it goes when you’re adults, too, so it’s not a problem.”
It’s nothing like their kiss on the balcony the night before: no hesitation here, just pure need, the adrenaline from the evening’s fight rising in Steve like a wave - a wave he knows will drown him, if he lets it, and by God, how he wants to let it -
“It was definitely you,” Clint said.  “Which I thought at the time was a little weird, considering how much you like the sound of your own voice, but now it’s clear that what you really wanted was the clear the runway for your
“Let’s cross that bridge if we come to it,” Tony said desperately.  “What do you say we get some candy and soda and watch a movie?  I have a big-screen TV, I
Steve laughs, and it doesn’t make anything better, really, Tony thinks as Sam offers him pizza and Barnes grabs him a beer, but it doesn’t hurt, either.
Tony disappeared, and Steve stayed at the sink for a while longer, looking into the mirror and wishing he would come back.
“Well, it doesn’t show,” Tony says, and Steve laughs, and Tony’s relieved as hell that their salads arrive at exactly that moment.
The children moved out of the way, watching excitedly as Tony guided Steve up to the front of the line.
“Look, once I realized the calls were coming from inside the house, I wanted to deal with it myself,” Tony says.  “No reason for any of the rest of you to get mixed up with this, especially you, we need you to keep your nose clean, all right?  This guy is my business, it’s my people, I don’t need you to see the dark underbelly of everything I’ve ever done.”
“Don’t stop,” Tony said.  “Imagine you can feel me behind you, and it’s my hand wrapped around you, and all I can think about is you.  That’s all there is, just my hand around your cock, and I’m pressing into you from behind, you can tell how bad I want you, I want you, Steve, god, I want you - ”
“Nope,” Fury says.  “Only a few witnesses, and all of them say the same thing - it showed up out of no where, destroyed their town, and then it was gone.”
Thor accidentally caused a lightning storm over Long Island.  Tony considered grounding him for it, but honestly, it was kind of cool.
“Spare me the bullshit,” Tony says, and to Steve’s surprise he reaches out and pushes him, right up against the wall of the Quinjet.  “I don’t want to hear it.  Friday, where are we?”
"Because they say a lot of things about what Blonksy gets up to," Stark says, like Steve didn't say a word.  "Weird things.  Things the army tried out during the war and gave up on when they got too dangerous.  Brainwashing.  Drugs that make men docile, or compliant, or strong enough to - "
But Steve had already spun around and splashed under the water, so Tony took the opportunity to drop trou and skedaddle down the pool stairs.  It was a little cooler than he would have liked, but soon the worst was over and he was paddling out to the center, where Steve was floating languidly and apparently without any effort at all.
,” Steve snaps, and he reaches out like he’s going to grab Tony, or maybe hit him, but he stops himself just in time, and Tony wishes he knows which way that would’ve gone.  “What the hell were you
The trip uptown’s breathtakingly fast in the Chrysler, and Steve barely has time to wonder what Stark wants with him before Stark Tower appears at the end of the block, sticking up out of the rest of Midtown like a sore thumb.  Hogan drives straight into an underground driveway and pulls in next to a nearly identical black Chrysler.
“Looking for this?” Tony steps up behind him, holding the Bic steady at Steve’s shoulder, and Steve twists slightly to cup his hand around the flame and suck.
“I have eyes on a semi heading east on highway 30,” Sam Wilson says in his ear.  “And a pickup with a huge trailer just passing Harrah’s.”
"Always," Tony says.  Steve tweaks his nipple, crawls closer and ducks his head under the covers.  "Do you sleep when I'm not here?"
“Well, anyway,” Miss Potts says, “I’d better go make sure Tony’s not trading 10% stake in the company for an extra hour from the band - have fun!”
One of Killian's men takes a running jump at Stark, but Steve dives in front of him and catches the goon with a right hook to the jaw.  The man flops backward, and one of his friends steps in to take his place; Steve swings again and again, listening to Barton go head to head on his left and Odinson on his right.  The fourth guy seems to be weighing his chances against Banner, who's still sitting on his barstool, and Stark, whose arm is smoking a little from the whatever-it-was that blew up a minute ago.  Killian, of course, is no where to be found.
.  It’s just dinner between two friends.  Two friends who maybe, sort of, if Tony is reading the signals right, have a thing for each other.  So, you know.  Casual.
measurements, at least.”  He leans in close and slides a hand along Steve’s inner thigh.  “Like getting you out of your clothes, for example.”
“I wouldn’t want to spend my last night on Earth with us either,” Clint said, spinning a plate on each pointer finger.
Natasha cracks one eyelid open and sees Banner, not quite concealed by the shadow of the stairwell, frozen in place on his way back down--presumably to get his hat. She turns her head back to Thor, gripping him by the back of the neck and murmuring into his mouth. "Let him watch," she says.
, Strange mouths, and it’s almost a relief, because finally Tony can admit that he’s always known what’s coming.  He’s always known, ever since Strange handed over the stone on that godforsaken planet in the middle of Bumfuck, Outer Space - before that, actually, ever since that vision from Wanda, ever since he stared into the blackness of space through the hole in the sky and realized they weren’t alone.
"Yeah, all my PhDs were so much help against Thanos," Bruce says dryly, and they all wince, because it's not like Bruce's PhDs were any more or less useful than any of the rest of them, in the end.  "I'm serious.  I worked so hard for so long not to feel anything, and now I need somebody to hit me where it hurts.  I need somebody to hit me so hard I can't control myself."
“Well, that’s very nice of you,” Santa Claus said, remembering the role he had been born to play.  “And is there anything you want for Christmas this year?"
“Fascinating,” Stark says.  “Thanks, Pep - hey, why did the music stop?  Did someone stop the music?”
“Pretend that I’m having that conversation with you,” Steve said, miserably.  “I don’t want to do that.  Not tonight.”
“So for the record, I don’t care what you guys put into your bodies when you’re adults, the 90s are mostly a blur for me, I get it, but right now you’re kids and I’m responsible for you, so this?  This doesn’t happen again,” Tony said.
Rhodey’s been crashing at the penthouse for a few days, and he’s been making noise about taking Tony on vacation, Cabo or Monaco or Vegas (“They do divorce parties these days, you know, like a bachelor party but in reverse”).  Tony ignores him, mostly, works all night and mainlines coffee and watches the little heat signature that belongs to Morgan run around the backyard in Pennsylvania.  He probably would have missed the meeting if Bruce hadn’t come down to drag him out, literally, which Bruce can actually pull off these days, the big green meanie.
“I probably won’t remember in the morning,” Tony said, even though he was pretty sure he would.  “Can you believe Clint was holding out on us?  All this time, and we didn’t know he owned a major vacation destination.  Hell,
“Just throw him the plates, we have a hundred more,” Steve said, grabbing a new plate out of the cabinet and whirling it in Clint’s direction.
“Oh good, everyone’s here,” Tony said wearily, beginning the long, torturous walk to Natasha’s bedroom door.  When he reached it, his hand hovered over the door, weighing his options.  “Natasha?  Thor?  Are you in there?”
When Tony wakes up he’s in his own bed with a couple water bottles and a bottle of aspirin on the bedside table.  The Avengers grouptext is full of pictures from the night before.  There’s one of Bruce tossing empties for Wanda to float up to the ceiling, and one of Peter catching a Monet Barnes is throwing off the helipad, and one of Tony with one arm around Rhodey and the other around Steve, grinning like an idiot while they laugh at something (probably him).  Jeez.  Embarrassing.
“Damn, Steve, you can throw a punch!” Clint said, rubbing his jaw and looking impressed.  “No wonder that guy grows up to be a superhero.”
“Clearly you have access to some power the rest of us can only dream of,” Beck says.  “Clearly, you could have set everything right - you could have taken everybody back to day one, before Thanos, before any of it.  But you didn’t.”
“You’ll have to forgive my bad manners,” Steve says, stepping forward and leaving the others in the shadows.  “This is all a bit of a risk for me, see.  I could use a few witnesses.”
“Excuse me, not all of us joined the Army and got used to being naked with our coworkers,” Tony said. “Put a towel on, Spangles.”
“Well, it sounds like you boys’ll need all the help you can get,” Natasha says.  “Tomorrow night.  We meet here at eleven.”
“Damn it.”  Steve climbed carefully out of bed; Peggy barely shifted, and as he padded out of the bedroom and down the stairs, the apparition followed in his wake.
“Want to,” Steve said, his voice raw.  “Anyway, it’s not like I have a gag reflex.  I want you to do whatever you want.”
“Well, that’s very nice of you,” Santa said, starting to look a little uncomfortable; Steve had now been on his knee for more than the 30 seconds most children were allotted, and he wasn’t exactly light.  “Anything else?”
"They're kids who are stealing food from other kids," Natasha snaps.  "You have to shake it off, Steve."
“Look, I’m not happy about it either, all right?  Jesus.  Come yell at him yourself if you wanna yell that bad.”
suit,” he says significantly, “and come make the tough calls - hell, you’re invited.  And until you want to do that?  You can - and you can quote me on this directly - fuck off, will you?”
“Excuse me, sir,” JARVIS said.  “I believe you should know that two members of the team are currently alone.”
“No.”  The man opens up the door and stands next to it expectantly.  “Mr. Stark would like to see you.”
Steve snorts, shakes his head.  "You heard me.  After what you've done, you’ve got some nerve thinking you deserve her."
“They’re angry, Tony,” she says.  “They’re angry and hurting and it’s already gotten ugly.  The best thing we can do is keep doing what we’re doing - the Foundation, and the jobs, and - ”
“Bruce said the Ancient One was pretty clear about the risks,” Steve said.  “We all agreed we wouldn’t mess with the timeline, so this?  This is me not messing with the timeline.”
Tony hangs up the phone before Happy can pick up.  Well, shit.  Tony doesn’t believe in signs, but it’s hard to ignore an
“Well, not that I’ve thought about it much,” Steve lied, “but a sleigh and eight flying reindeer might do the trick.”
“Buck?” Steve says, sounding groggy, and Tony freezes, grabs the door before it swings shut and turns on his heel.
Steve leaned closer to Tony, and Tony leaned closer too, automatically.  “Do you think it’s a bad idea?”
“So if you’re not the boss,” Clint said, turning back to Coulson, “and you’re not one of us, who are you?”
He grabs his nanotech jacket from the backseat - he wasn’t planning on wearing it, but duty calls - and by the time the suit’s in place Steve’s two blocks away, so Tony fires up the repulsors and follows him.  He can hear the screaming now too, and he catches up with Steve as he pulls a sharp left into an alley.
He bent down low, ducked under the tap to rinse, and when he looked up he caught a glimpse of Tony in the mirror.  “Wow,” Tony said.  “It’s hard seeing you as a brunette, but I gotta admit, it gets the job done.  Do you get a lot of
“Are you?” Beck says, hovering in midair a dozen yards from Tony.  “You might want to re-think that.”
“Can it, Rogers,” Sitwell snaps, and three men loom up behind him, taller than Steve and cracking their knuckles.
“He,” Steve said, and he paused, because which was worse: lie, or admit that he had no idea?  Tell her that they’d never found Sam’s body, so they assumed he was part of the Decimation but they might have missed him in the madness; that Steve hadn’t started looking for him for hours because he’d spent the time on his knees over Bucky’s ashes.  “It was in the battle,” he’d said finally.
He hovers at the top of the stairs for several increasingly awkward minutes and wonders how far it is to the nearest subway station.  A couple miles, he figures; he doesn’t mind the run, but he’d prefer not to scuff up his good shoes, not after he spent so long shining them -
They get dinner on the road, and it’s late when they pull into the garage at the tower.  They’ve been quiet for the past 30 minutes, winding through evening traffic in Manhattan, and Tony is almost afraid to break the silence as he cuts the engine.  “So.”
It started in DC, a few months after Tony got back.  They're in their 31st month of Congress's emergency session now, but back then it was still pretty new, and everyone thought, or at least pretended, that they might be able to get back to normal one day.  Tony was being debriefed by the House Intelligence Committee, and Steve and Natasha and Bruce had gone with him, sat in the second row and listened while Tony described everything that happened on Titan.  Half the committee was enraptured, the other half skeptical.  Tony didn't seem to really care either way.
Steve stares at him.  Tony stares right back, his face pinched around the mouth like it is when he’s trying not to say something he really wants to say.  Tony doesn’t have a lot of practice not saying things.
“I’m thankful I only have to think of something I’m thankful for once a year,” Natasha said, and sat back proudly.
Tony would have expected dinner to be strained, and it probably would have been enormously so, except by the time it was served 4/5ths of them were drunk.
Steve sighed.  He seemed… annoyed.  Upset?  Constipated?  Tony was still learning to read him.  He was like a big beautiful blonde book written in another language.  “You know, Tony, I didn’t come down to your lab today because I didn’t want to help with Thanksgiving dinner.”
"Thank you," she says, more quietly than she means to. He nods jerkily and reaches for the door, presumably to close it behind him so he can make his way to his shower.
“Sure,” Tony says.  “I’m good.  Why are we saying good so much?  I feel like we’re saying good too much, do
Steve leans back in his seat.  “I thought maybe we’d be able to dissolve the team,” he says.  “But it looks like - ”
Steve wasn’t sure what it said about him that he wasn’t even surprised to find Tony there waiting for him.
Across the table, Tony sat back and arched an eyebrow.  “You know, it doesn’t say anywhere on your Wikipedia page that you like to cook.”
“Tony,” he says, leaning down to try to see through the eye holes of the clockwork man, but it’s dark inside.  “Tony!  Can you hear me?”
“Are you watching this?” Bruce says, bursting into the workshop with all the grace that you would expect from a 600-pound green rage monster wearing glasses and a loose-knit cardigan.
“‘Scuse me?” Barton says.  “No offense, pal, but you’ll have to forgive us if we aren’t interested in working for the feds.”
Pierce chuckles.  “It was bad enough when you wouldn’t pay your dues, sweetheart, but this business you’ve been up to with Rogers - you had to know that wasn’t going to end well.”
"I'd love one, sweetheart."  Killian winks at her, and Steve's stomach curdles, but Miss Romanov just smiles blandly and pulls out a bottle of gin.  "We can count it toward your late payments."
"Well, there’s a huge line,” Steve said, gesturing to the queue that wound through the room.  “Maybe if it slows down at some point - ”
"And if you weren't such a coward," Steve continues, watching Bruce's jaw work, "you might have actually been able to
"Guess all that genius only goes so far," Steve says.  "You still carrying around that noisemaker you brought out last night?  What kind of gun is that, anyway?"
“That opinion’s about twenty minutes too late to matter,” Stark says, pulling his hat lower over his eyes.
Tony raised his eyebrows and bucked his hips a little sharper.  Steve held Tony’s eyes as his dick sank all the way into Steve’s mouth, and Tony wasn’t kidding himself, he wasn’t huge but he definitely wasn’t
A waiter passes by, and Tony grabs two more glasses of champagne.  “To all the mistakes we’ve made.”
“I think many of us would agree,” Jameson says.  “I’ve talked before on my show about how Tony Stark and the Avengers have their own private relationship with the very aliens the rest of us are allowed to know very little about.”
“I’d rather talk more about the murders that James Barnes committed throughout his decades of service with HYDRA,” Jameson interrupts.  “Including, if the rumors are to be believed, the murders of Howard and Maria Stark.  How is that a man Captain America can possibly defend?”
Three weeks before Christmas, Tony said, apropos of nothing, “I think it’s time we get a Christmas tree.”
“Hey, hey, I know,” Tony says, holding up his hands.  “I didn’t mean - sorry.  I didn’t mean it that way.  If I want out, I’m out.  Nobody’s keeping me here.”
"I'd like to discourage you from reporting me for illegally procuring and selling alcoholic beverages," Miss Romanov says.  "You'll find it won't go very well for you."
“I’ve never claimed to be subtle,” Stark says.  He slides a hand down the front of Steve’s flies and grips him through the wool of his slacks, and Steve lets his head fall back with a choked-off groan.  “You don’t seem too angry with me.”
“It’s rare I get to hear a man scream that way when I’m not the one causing it,” Natasha said fondly.  “Hi, Cap.  Come for a swim?”
“I try to keep my workouts private,” Steve said.  “Can’t go around making everybody else feel insecure.”
That’s fine with Tony.  He has other things to worry about.  The task of putting the world back together is too big for him to wrap his arms around, so instead he hires back all of his employees, every single one of them.  He doubles his energy output overnight.  He starts work on another factory just to give everybody something to do.
Fourth floor, the silent bachelor who moved in last night, bringing with him a suspicious lack of luggage and a name that sounds like a fake ("Banner"). Natasha is looking forward to scraping his brains off the walls in a few days, assuming he hasn't already offed himself. She
Pepper gives Morgan a hug in the doorway and laughs as she climbs up the stairs telling Steve all about how she wants to build her dolls a swimming pool but Mommy says it’s not practical.   “So,” Pepper says while Tony shuffles into the house with Morgan’s bags, “not that it’s a problem, but why is Captain America playing with our daughter’s dollhouse?”
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Tony said.  “I told you I’d figured out how to pinpoint days, did you not think I could do it?”
“You can do this for as long as you want to,” Tony said.  “You can do anything.  You’ve punched Hitler over 200 times.  But you don’t
eating, but when he tried to assemble ingredients himself the results were usually horrifying.  Thor took flavors he enjoyed, flavors like frosting and ketchup and curry, and combined them such that the whole was significantly worse than the sum of its parts.  When Thor was cooking, Tony tried to ignore it unless JARVIS gave him a warning about toxic fumes.
It’s a hard catch but it holds, and Tony shoots toward the docks with one arm around Steve’s waist.  Steve doesn’t fight him, just grips his wrist and hangs there, and as Tony lands on top of a warehouse near the water he wants to shake him, wants to hit him, wants to
“That’s an understatement.”  Steve leaned against the sink, stared into the mirror.  “I don’t know how much longer I can do this.”
“I have to tell you something,” Tony says.  “A couple things, actually.  The first one is that I’m a jerk.  I mean, you knew that, obviously, I just want to make sure you know I know.”
“If you want to warm up, there’s a hot tub too, jets are behind the towel stand,” Clint said.  “Or you could, you know, find a
“Well, it’s hard to be demanding when you’re dead,” Tony said.  “I - look, you’re the only person I’ve talked to in - honestly I don’t know how time works, exactly, but it
“Of course I can prove it, but it’d be helpful to know who I was accusing.  Friday, keep combing the footage for more inconsistencies, and start running the names of witnesses.”  Tony smiles broadly at Steve, more confidently than he feels.  “We’ll find something.”
Natasha pulled up the base’s tracking system.  “Scott and Carol and Rhodey went to see their families, and Rocket and Nebula are in orbit.”
to be a date, there’s no way Steve would walk around looking like that if he didn’t want this to be a date, that would be
“Did you expect any better?” Tony says.  “It’s not new information to you that I’m an asshole.  Jeez, one magical night and it’s like you forget who I am.”
“Why’d you wake me up,” Steve said, annoyed that his brain would pull him out of one dream only to launch him into another.
"That thing you've got," Banner says, nodding at Stark's arm as he tightens Steve's bandage.  "What is it?"
Steve shrugged.  “What they do on their own time isn’t my business.  Besides, it can bring people together.  Team bonding and all.”
is already more than enough to deal with before adding Bucky fucking Barnes into the situation so yeah, no, this was definitely the right call.
When he opens his eyes again, he’s dry.  “Huh,” Tony says, peering at Strange’s cape.  “Did it mess up my hair?”
, says a voice in Tony’s head that sounds irritatingly like Steve’s, but attacking innocent people is significantly
“It’s enough to give it a try,” Peter says.  “Caring about people is scary, but it’s okay if you’re scared sometimes, you know.”
“So many times,” Steve said, and he was blushing furiously but looked defiant, too, like he was kind of
test it on kids at the academy, they usually just kept them around the lab until it wore off,” Natasha said.
"Not that kind of missing," Steve says.  "He was involved in some - some secretive business.  Declared MIA in '18, but he never came home in a box or otherwise."
“That I can do,” Tony murmured, grabbing the front of Steve’s shirt and pulling him down for another kiss.  Steve kissed him back hungrily this time, threading a hand through Tony’s hair and pressing their bodies together, grinding his hips into Tony’s desperately.
Steve glances over his shoulder; as he’d suspected, there’s another automobile right behind them.  “I was under the impression that our mission here at the bureau was to protect the people of the United States.”
"Just watch Fox News," Tony suggests.  "They attack us personally all the time.  Twice before breakfast, if you're me."
“It was two minutes and twenty seconds,” Steve said, and then they looked at each other and burst out laughing, so really, it wasn’t all bad.
He wonders what to make of Tony at all.  The man’s facing away from him, his back rising and falling gently with sleep.  He hadn’t kicked Steve out; heck, he’d asked him to stay.  He’d talked about
“Yeah, but saying things I shouldn’t have said is kind of my thing,” Tony says.  “If I stopped, what would I be known for?”  Tony pauses long enough for Steve to roll his eyes, and then continues, “So, you planning to hit the road again?”
“Please get me off this topic, I am actually begging you,” Steve said, looking miserable.  “Natasha, I wasn’t planning to ever tell you this but when I was dropping off your laundry in your room one time I saw two different vibrators in your room - somebody
“Okay, maybe we should leave him with just one of us,” Tony said.  “There’s no reason for him to spill his guts to
“If you’re so worried about it, why don’t you use all that money of yours to do something good?” Steve says.  “Help the city clean itself up.”
“Yeah, can I get a glass of scotch?  South Dakota’s finest.”  Tony smiles at the bartender, and after an extended bout of blinking he scurries away.  “You know Hawaii exists, right?”
