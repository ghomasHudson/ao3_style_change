" he emphasized, catching Steve's eye, snickering.  "She burst into my office with Happy like she owned the place.  It was great.  And after she left, I turned to Happy and I said,
Tony sank onto the nearest sofa, still covered in dust from his disastrous birthday party; it creaked and then broke, depositing him onto the floor.  He snorted at the situation.  He decided to handle it the way he always did. By drinking.  He'd have a nice little breakdown and maybe, with time, he'd go back to feeling his usual numbness.  His usual shallow sense of superiority.  And maybe, with time, maybe he'd get lucky and forget Steve entirely.
doing here?" one man demanded, turning to Lawrence.
But there was always a strange satisfaction in killing Alphas who'd tried to take it what wasn't their right to.
"Yeah. Got it. It's good to hear from you again, Steve. I'll bring the car around."
Steve wasn't home until evening and by that time, his interview, pre-released on the internet, had already gone viral.  Tony was watching the hashtags unfold: StatusEquality, EqualityNow, OmegaRights, StonyBond, CapWatch.  He was still trying to get
Steve's talk of heats unnerved him.  He remembered Steve's last one- how desperately Tony had wanted him. Steve's smell had been like a drug and Tony had been out of control with desire; he'd been so finely tuned to it, able to smell Steve's sweat and the slickness between his thighs and he'd been willing to do nearly anything to have him.
Tony smiled at Steve in the mirror, giving his hair a few last, minor adjustments.  "Okay.  Let's do it," he said.  He grabbed Steve's hand and the two of them descended the curving staircase into the main room.
"Of course!"
"I kinda like retro, I think," Steve murmured.
at the time.
"Be grateful we haven't broken the other one, Captain."
"...oh, fuck!"  Tony flipped mid-air and hit the jets.
"Yeah," said Tony, a hint of misery in his voice.  "...it's my fault he went to Bucky. I'm a lousy Alpha."
This had raised a pressing concern.
He got his key from the front desk and went up to his suite; he was the first one there, and he spent nearly an hour pacing and tapping his fingers, waiting for Donner and the others.  Gene had already told him about Chantelle and Tom, Donner's "chaperones" and "friends."
(The answer wasn't a simple one.  Tony was prone to crashing and sleeping like he was dead after a bout of work in the lab.  Steve had found him sprawled over the counters in the kitchen, on the pool deck, curled under desks, and bent in all sorts of unnatural positions, unable to wake.  On the other hand, when Tony fell asleep naturally, he was a light sleeper who often woke suddenly and violently, a consequence of PTSD.)
Steve turned.  Steve's breath hitched.  On one of the screens, he was seeing himself.  He was frost-bitten and bloody, his eyes red and wide with fear. He'd never seen himself so afraid, or so exposed before. He was outstretching his hand, looking lost. The love of his life on a knife's edge before him.
or something?"  Tony didn't add that his "friends" were really associates and people he invited to parties and women he slept with and then didn't take out to breakfast the next morning.  The people Tony actually cared about were limited to Pepper, Happy, and Rhodey, and two of those people were furious with him and probably not talking to him.  Tony didn't really understand "friends."  He'd never had them.  Rhodey had been the first friend he'd ever made, in college.  Before that, Tony had been too isolated; he was never able to connect or relate to his peers.  He was Howard Stark's son and, worse, he gained a reputation for being devastatingly, intimidatingly intelligent.
would be able to see.
He smiled as Tony leaned against him, curling an arm around his shoulders to help steady him.
There was plenty he didn't know or understand about the world, but he knew this.
, okay. He got it. Piper, next to him, seemed to be getting a little embarrassed about all this talk of sex. Steve was finding it semi-interesting. Though he knew Tony didn't want children.
Several men in hardhats were surveying the room, sweeping up all the rubble, taking measurements.
There was a lot of blood. As Joey collected the suitcase Steve had to deal with the man jerking back into consciousness because of the pan. "Sorry," Steve winced as he knocked him out again, knocking his head down into the dashboard as 'gently' as he could muster. He found it harder to be mean when it wasn't HYDRA (or he didn't
"No," said Sitwell succinctly.  A pause, then he added, "If people found out Rogers was double-bonded it would discredit him quite a bit, wouldn't it?"
He got up and limped over to the couch, practically crawling into Steve's lap, wrapping his arms around him.  "All these stupid flowers," he said quietly, his tone affectionate.
Dammit, this was hard.
Steve moved to hesitantly place the box in Tony's hand, their fingers brushing briefly. There was identical box still in the bag. "I thought velvet looked nice. Soft. Not cold. And not made of metal." That had honestly been Steve's main priority. He hated the cold in every shape or form.
Steve grabbed one with a small thanks and tucked it around Tony's shoulder. "You'll get cold if you don't get dry," he warned him.
Obadiah Stane and Margaret Carter had been named Tony's godparents, an honorary title, considering that Howard Stark was a firm agnostic and that Obadiah was Jewish.  Tony had seen quite a bit of her in his childhood but that was ages ago. In fact, they hadn't talked much, hardly at all, since Tony's parents had died. He had done his best not to mention this because he could recall with some mortification asking to hear stories of Captain America when he was little boy and the thought of Steve knowing about that was fucking embarrassing.  He knew Steve was close to her but he was pretty sure they only reminisced about the past together. Tony hadn't felt there was any reason to tell him that Peggy-- Aunt Carter--
sake Tony. I'm so goddamn sexually frustrated you're going to kill me. Jesus Christ," Steve said and he actually sounded annoyed. But not angry - the kind of annoyed he'd get when Tony accidentally poured coffee all over himself: fond but exasperated.  "I'm not Captain America right now. I’m Steve goddamn Rogers." Steve let out a frustrated sound. "Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I like it? Maybe I like being submissive? No, I can't say it out there because out there I'm the captain and I'm a symbol.  But here I'm not. Here we're supposed to be honest with each other. I don't want to give you what you want just to make
"Total babe," agreed Tony.
"No problem," said DeSoto.
Pepper.  Pepper, I don't know when--"
Steve groaned. "Where is he?" he groaned.  "What have you done to him?"
eating something."
Steve took the shower and almost felt shy when he stepped back out of the bathroom in just his towel (which was ridiculous). How many times had Tony seen him naked now? Steve didn't know. But then he supposed this was the longest they had gone without having sex
"Let's get it over with so me and Steve can get out of here," said Tony.  He gave Steve's hand a small, encouraging squeeze.  As long as Schmidt wasn't here... as long as they weren't trying to torture his omega... as long as he had veto power... well, that all seemed agreeable to him.
The thought of going to bed every night with his omega, curling up into Steve's warm body... it should have been cloying, but instead, it was comforting.  Tony had never felt that sleeping alone was lonely but now he wasn't sure how he'd ever done it.
Steve didn't know how Tony knew that. Sometimes people used to say that a bond was a physic connection. Until experiencing it Steve could have never believed them. But if Tony knew
The asset was sitting on a stainless steel table, staring straight ahead, waiting.  They'd promised to take him to Karpov once they'd looked him over.  The doctor had removed the bullets from his shoulder and stitched up the wound in his hip.  He hadn't used anesthetic; no point.
He didn't understand.
Tony considered this for a moment.  "...yeah," he admitted.  "You know what?  Steve never lied to me.  He wasn't really undercover.  He was just himself, and I was so fucking prejudiced-- excuse my language, Mrs. First Lady-- that all I saw was an omega.  I didn't ever realize that he was Captain America, standing right there in front of me.  And Steve is a humble guy, and he never mentioned it, and it never came up, and I treated him like shit for weeks.  That's how deep status bias can run.  But it turned out better that way because I got to know Steve as a real person, not as some national symbol.  And once I started seeing him like that, as a person... I realized what a big asshole I was and how prejudiced I was and... I'm real lucky he showed up to set me straight," he finished, rubbing his thumb over Steve's hand under the table.
"Clint showed you furries?  Oof.  Sorry, buddy.  I tried to protect you," said Tony, laughing.
It was Irshad that saved them.  "The rumor is that Captain Rogers was undercover to monitor the Iron Man situation.  Correct?"
"Stark," said Clint, more seriously.  "...Steve's young. Steve's young and he doesn't have any family.  A permanent procedure--"
Tony was hung over and feeling miserable and Steve wanted to be able to look after him without some strange omega peering over them.
show," retorted Banksy, drawing himself up a little.
Fortunately Tony was mostly ambidextrous and it had been a clean, simple fracture.  Plus, this gave him an excuse not to shake hands for at least two or three months, which was nice.
"Yes! Oh my God. Steve, you have to get out there," Jeff said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. "You'll do great."
Steve stepped back out and almost blushed when he realised DeSoto probably heard him placating Tony like a baby...but he really was very drunk.
"Yeah, he did," snapped Tony grumpily.  "Whenever he got drunk, which was all the time, it was Captain America this and Captain America that.  'He's the best thing I ever made, the only good I ever brought into this world.' Great thing to tell your only son."
Steve looked up, sharply.
"Hm?" Steve blinked awake at the sound of their voices. He could feel a distant sense of panic throbbing in his chest. Was it Tony's? He frowned.  Pserhaps another nightmare? He wasn't sure. It didn't...it didn't
DeSoto seemed genuinely shocked by the audacity of an omega walking out the front door.
"Baby pictures?" Steve said, perking up. Now
"L-Let me go. S-Stop it. I don't want it. Stop." Steve was breathless, he was struggling to speak, his brain fogging over with hormones and a confused and reluctant sense of arousal.
His dander rose immediately and he growled softly under his breath, ready to fight to protect his omega from any potential threat.
Steve paused to think about it. "Pretty useless. Actually."
"Do you mind?"  The young man offered his phone to Steve.  He and Tony both threw up Tony's signature peace sign.  There was a pause.
"You've been spending your time around an Alpha 24/7. It's possible," Phil said. "We knew by the chip. Your heart rate is going through the roof, as well as your core temperature. And then that disaster on the track-" Steve opened his mouth to speak. "Not your fault. Didn't see it coming. You did the right thing."
Steve's expression softened and he reached out to catch Tony's hand before he pulled away. He tangled their fingers together and let their shoulders press together too. "I'm glad I did," he murmured.
but Steve also knew that what set Tony apart from a lot of other Alphas was that he
Tony got up, smoothing down his tie.  "Okay, fine. See you tomorrow, Pep." Tony figured that the hotel staff had restocked the minibar by now; he could go home and get sloshed and go back to bed.
.. you've been okay, right, Tiberius?" prompted Tony.
. "You gonna try and talk to Stark about your feelings, hm? ‘Cus there's obviously something there."
Part of being Iron Man was penance.  Trying to make up for the sins of the son, and the sins of the father.  He'd been talking about protecting the troops and creating peace for decades, stupidly and blissfully unaware that his work was indiscriminately destroying whole villages of innocent people.
"I'm not going anywhere." Steve kissed Tony's forehead, still running a hand through it's hair. "It's alright, Tony. Promise."
"Hey-"protested Steve meekly.  He didn't exactly like being clung to but he also didn't need anyone talking for him; he'd been trying to convince Tony to let him go for several minutes already.
With shaky hands Steve got the pill in his mouth and gulped it down with two mouthfuls of water. He downed the bottle and then crumpled it before dropping it onto the floor. Steve was trembling a little less now.
He flopped back down into the bed.  "You don't have to stay in bed all day with me," he said quietly.  "I just wanna nap for a while. 'Night, Steve." Just like that, his enthusiasm was off like a light switch.
SHIELD arrived not twenty minutes later. Nick stood stoically in the lab as Pietro and Wanda were carried out. Every agent that walked in and out was a beta. They calmly explained to everyone that they would have to sign confidentiality wafers (after all, they had seen mutants).
"Steve?"
Tony paced frantically, a ball of tension and energy, dander up, eyes cloudy with fury.
having a heat together.  They banged two or three times a week and since bonding, they'd barely touched the box of condoms they'd purchased back in June.
Tony examined his face.  He looked... okay.  More well-rested than he had in months, that was for sure.  He congratulated himself on fixing his arc reactor, not dying in Monaco, and taking Captain America's virginity.  All in all, a decent week.  Maybe an 8, 9 out of 10.  Yeah.
"Shit.  You're kidding me.  You didn't think to tell me that earlier?" demanded Jeanette.
"That sounds rough," the doctor hummed. Steve found his combination of concern and normalization fairly comforting.  "To examine you properly you're going to have to lie down, Captain.  Is there a more private place for us to chat?  A place you'd feel comfortable?"
For the first time, Tony was glad Steve was going to be spending Saturday with Clint in some middle-of-nowhere safehouse, just to get away from the media for a while.
"Maybe it isn't over yet," Steve said quietly, a hint of a smile on his lips like he knew a secret. Which, of course, he did. Would Tony hate him for it? Maybe. But they could move past it, Steve was sure. He was still more concerned about Tony following his orders out on the field...maybe Fury was being a little too hopeful there? He shrugged and moved to steal the half a donut out of Tony's hand. Man he was starving.
he'll go away."
Steve fidgeted with his hands a little. He felt an itch to draw all of a sudden. He remembered his sketchbook he'd left in his hotel; had they taken it? He frowned at the thought.
"Wait. You want me to
keycodes) and pulled Steve out.  The entrance of the grotto was hung with a heavy curtain of what appeared to be chaparral but was apparently fake; Tony pushed it aside and just like that, they were on the beach at night, the sky above them still bursting with brightly colored fireworks, the ocean whispering loudly and rhythmically against the sand.  They were completely alone.
he thought sternly.
"Look, Tony, I respect that you want to do something nice for your mate, but at 93, most of the people Steve knew back in his time are dead or dying.  Calling attention to the fact that he's basically lost in time... I don't think it's a good idea."
"It's okay," Steve said and moved to sit down. He tried to keep his face neutral as he did so. "We don't have to leave for another half an hour though, right?"
Not everyone was playing poker, of course.  True to his word, J. Jameson had stuck to poker, which suited him very well because Tony could hear him shouting "Hit me!" across the room.  But poker was where the real action was at and that was where Tony wanted to be.
"He, uh, he got the gland," said Clint.  "...I'm sorry," he added, patting Steve's leg.
start!" he snapped at it.  "...Steve! Wait! I'm coming with you!"  He hurried after him. He knew everything Steve had said was true.  Steve was, literally, made for this; he'd volunteered; he'd
Fury looked down at him coolly.  "Well, for one thing, I'd like to get you into an MRI.  And for another, I'd like you to talk to Dr. Brazinski about your association between the Winter Soldier, who is a known HYDRA operative, and Bucky Barnes, who is your Alpha.  There's an obvious conflict of interest there."
Caught between a rock and a hard place.  Tony loved him, and desperately wanted to give him everything he wanted... but he also knew, in a logical, unemotional way that, so far, Steve hadn't given him much reason to trust him.  Not at all.  Giving in to Steve would be easy, but it might mean playing into SHIELD's games.  Maybe that was the game plan all along- get their grubby little hands on the suit, on the newest version of the reactor.
"Hey, this is my song!" said Pitbull, perking up.
"...Steve?" Howard's unsure voice was sour in his ears.
"Hi, Steve, Phil," said Pepper breathlessly, arms full of notes.
"Tony, wait," protested Rhodey, his own suit limping brokenly behind Tony's.
"Oh, what, I can just be his silver medal, huh?  Be his side Alpha?" said Tony.  He snarled at Rhodey weakly, unable to believe his old friend was insulting him like this.
"I packed a sketchbook into your bag, in case you want to angry draw or something."
person, he wanted that person to be Hammer.  An Alpha of comparable status to Tony who was incredibly annoying, far less progressive, and had already flirted with the omega.  He might as well have had a giant target painted on his forehead.
"It's probably better for us to get it over with," added Tony reasonably.  "If the paparazzi catches that scar on your neck, you'll never hear the end of it."
He looked up at the stage, heart pounding.
"Tony was kind of being weird earlier too...sorry. I'm so sorry. It won't happen again."
Tony's hackles rose.  "I REFUSE TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS THAT MAN."
He made his way back to the door, back to the chair, back to Steve.  Steve had been right about Bucky and he was right about another thing, too... Tony didn't like seeing him like this.
"...I haven't seen her in twenty years," said Tony, sipping his champagne.  "...she and Dad were close. United in their love for you, I guess." He gave Steve a small smile as if he were teasing, but Steve knew well enough he wasn't.  Howard and Peggy both had searched for Steve after he'd been lost, and Peggy had told Steve, softly, more than once, how much Howard had mourned him. Howard had not, perhaps, respected Steve... but in his own way, he had cared about him.
Unless...
"Someone bought my sister," Piper whispered. "I haven't seen her for three years."
Tony checked himself in the mirror, adjusting his hair a little.  "That's great.  ...seriously, I've felt kind of like shit all day.  Guilty, I guess.  You think we should've waited for him?"
He'd already scheduled a phone meeting with a professor of Alpha-omega relations studies from MIT, hoping to get a crash course in what was happening to him.
"It's nice to meet you," Steve said instead of offering out his hand. Danielle just smiled subtly but her eyes spoke volumes.
"I can just carry you," Steve assured him.
He let off four rounds.
"Steve," interrupted Natasha.
"And you." The smile Steve offered her was kinder. Her presence was warm; she made him feel strangely better in this room of strangers. He guessed that was almost her job as First Lady.
Tony settled down into one of the leather seats of the plane with a groan of gratitude, hunched over his McDonald's burger.  "Clint's a lovable dork. He's like a super-spy. Spec ops, basically. He's bonded to his partner; her name's Natasha."
"Steve," Aria said patiently. "The lights are on.
"Well, turns out someone just booked me a holiday which is pretty sweet," Aria said and then reached over to gently punch his bicep. "I'd grovel about how 'you shouldn't have' but we totally earned it.  Oh, and Saturday Night Live wants you. I'm thinking at the end of this month?"
Ugh. He didn't need to worry about that now.
Steve blinked curiously. "Okay... good to know.  But if it's anyone under the age of eighty I doubt I'll even know who they are.  ...is it Ella Fitzgerald?" He turned and pushed another glass towards Tony. "Drink."
It was Steve's feelings, he realized.
Steve was still staring off.
Suddenly he realized who was calling.
"Oh, Lord, Tony, no.  Please. Please, Alphas United already hates you two... if you pulled a stunt like that..."
Rex?"  Tony thought Rex seemed pleasant and attractive.  He had a strong jaw and high cheekbones and bright blue eyes.  His smile was bright and his teeth white and straight.
He felt Tony's fingers under the table and turned his hand up, winding their fingers together. Steve squeezed gently. Tony felt tense under his touch. Steve swallowed.
"All of that information is useless to me.  I need a breakfast update," demanded Tony.
. They were all betas in that too. "I'm really bad at this, aren't I?  ...Aria said I should get treatment for PTSD, like...for a soldier," ventured Steve.
Fury raised a brow. "Am I to take it that you quit?"
"There, there, sir," said JARVIS drily.
He let out an unintentional whine and looked out the door again, wishing Karpov would come get him and give him his medicine and possibly explain things in a way he could understand.
... what a bunch of assholes..." growled Tony.
"So you're saying Stark Industries is a pro-omega organization?!" someone shouted over the din of the crowd.
"...Steve?" said Tony quietly.  "Can I look at the back of your neck?" He was already steeling himself for the worst possible scenario.
Brent nodded.  "Yes, we're in communication.  He testified at the trial that shut them down.  But that was one camp. We want to get them all.  We don't want this to end up like the hydra, where you cut off one head and have two grow in its place."
"He's safe now and we're performing a full investigation," offered Maria, softly.
He just wanted to make things okay with Tony. Steve had been so mad at him but all of that was gone in a heart beat. He just wanted Tony to stop feeling weak. How could he do that? What he could do to make it okay? Fuck. He was so bad... bad at all of this.
Well, there was other ways to do that.
Tony made a face.  He rose, and made to scoop Steve up, but realized almost immediately that he couldn't.  After a moment, he said, "Er, I guess you can walk now on your own."
"Posting!"
"Then that's what we'll do," Steve said with a small smile. He moved to take off his clothes, folding them neatly over the back of the chair before he got back into bed with Tony. He grabbed the bottle and put it on the dressing table so it was easier for room service to clean up.
"W-what the fuck?" managed Pietro.
sounded like it would be hilariously inappropriate, so Tony strode off to go check it out.  If it sucked, he could go get some chow and maybe hang out around the vendor hall chatting up businessmen who supported this kind of bullshit.  Tony had already IDed several people and companies he would no longer allowed Stark Industries work with. Pepper would be that weird mixture of delighted and infuriated, no doubt.
"No.  He's either dead or he's holed up somewhere on his last legs.  SHIELD swooped in and took him from the hospital within twelve hours; he's at a black site now.  We can't confirm his death until one of the moles on the Council gets word."
"How dominant is he?" he'd demanded.  He did not have to specify who.

The five of them silently walked through the crowd and out the door.
He set the plate and cutlery down on the bedside for now. "You want food?" He asked softly.
He rubbed his eyes, trying to quell his headache.

been?"  He felt his lip twitch but fought the urge to bare his teeth.  No one was touching them; they were letting Steve and Tony huddle, and Steve was calming down.  They were safe.
"And the job comes with a lot of perks," Natasha said, biting on her bottom lip slowly, eyes bright with mischief.
. Please. I need you. I need you now," he chanted, eyes fluttering open to see a blurry room and a blurry Alpha on top of him.
Malick's phone went off, thankfully buying a couple of seconds of time for Tony and Steve.
Before he could stop himself, he blurted, "I looked up Barnes's family.  He had a sister.  She had... she had two kids.  They're alive.  And one of them has kids, too."
handle this. He'd fought in a war. This should be easy.
"Military identification tags are printed with the name of the soldier, the soldier's identification number, vaccination information, blood type, and religion."
And then a ghost of anxiety whispered the answer in Tony's ear: Bucky.  Bucky had gotten into him. Steve had spent a day with a
"Aw, c'mon, treat the lady," said Tony encouragingly.  "You've got the money and we've got some pretty rare ones.  And it's all going to charity. You love charity!"
They all nodded.
." Steve sighed. "I don't know. I don't know how to communicate with him at all. He keeps saying I'm a bad omega. It's probably something Gideon put in his head."
Judy and Jed orbited around Steve trying to get him to eat and drink and to contain the children as best they could, shutting down questions that clearly made him uncomfortable.  But they were up against quite a lot of kids, some of whom wanted autographs or to feel Steve flex; at least two of the littler ones begged to be picked up and at one point, one of them climbed into his lap while he was sitting down.
Tony looked down.  Fuck. Steve was going to make him say it.  "They lock so that they can't be taken off," he said.  He'd never felt as shitty about his status as he did right now.
"It was dece."  Tony let Lydia lead the two of them through a back door into a bright white hallway, toward a pair of sleek silver elevators.
The minute he was gone Steve was pushing his pants down. He was soaking between his legs, quivering with a hot and a familiar sort of need. He thought about the fact that Wanda and Pietro had tried to kill Tony again, take away the source of Steve's happiness... but then a hand pushing up his shirt distracted him.
Steve smiled at the drag of tongue on his neck.
"Anthony?"
Only Tony Stark would laugh and smile in the face of the word 'impossible'.
Tony nosed Steve's groan again and Steve's dick twitched longingly against his face.  Tony kissed it softly, then glanced up, anxiously.
"...I took the liberty of setting up an appointment for you," said Brennan.  She offered Steve an appointment card; Dr. Brazinski pulled out one as well.
them. These people were monstrous and they didn't deserve mercy.  This was no different than how Zola had treated prisoners of war back in 1943.  Steve was trying not to let himself think of the camp he had liberated, or what Bucky had endured there.
Discontent was rolling off of Tony in waves and Steve honestly didn't know how to make it better.
"Yeah?"
"I heard Phil made one of his classic monster nests," he grinned.
Tony sobered up damned quickly at that.  Keeping the knot in increased the chances of... that?  Tony
Steve let out a long breath. "Hammer and his mate, Jack, disappeared. I don't know where to. I don't know is there were civilian casualties but people definitely got hurt. Could you get Rhodey, actually? Tony needs someone to calm him down and I don't think I'm the one who's gonna be able to do it."
"Damn it, Rogers!" wheezed Fury.
He made his way toward the stairs to the basement, toward his shop.  People wanted Iron Man and Tony was more than happy to oblige.
Argentina."
!" yelled George.
"Slow down," said Natasha, her tone even.  "What algorithm?"
George had a flat in northwest Hollywood, and after some rather confusing directions, Happy found it and dropped him and Donner off.
Steve mumbled something incoherent and then said, "I love all you guys..."
"As if I'd want you, you cock-sucking cheater!" yelled Gideon.
He took Steve's plate with a grin; Steve said thank-you. Cooper looked delighted with himself.
"He's supposed to be undercover!  That is

Tony pulled off his thoroughly soaked shirt and tried to wipe off Steve's face with it; Steve was still red and his eyes puffy.
he thought.  He was trying not to actively drool, but...
"Or Sam could..." Steve mused. "But his neck might make things... complicated. Rhodey it is. We should call him straight away." Steve was already doing the speeches for him. So he guessed he had a favour to cash in.
"I'm sorry. So sorry..."
"Yeah, thanks!  ...Steve, c'mon!  Clover has baby pictures."  A fourth omega had joined them and was clutching a bunch of pictures, clearly excited to show them off to Captain America.
Tony stroked the back of Steve's neck in the car, gazing idly out the window as they headed downtown toward the Federal Building on Wilshire Blvd.  It was a block stone building that was oddly out of place among the usual trendy high-rise condos that lined that particular part of the boulevard. Across the street was the VA, and a cemetery with rows and rows of identical white gravemarkers.  (Tony had seen Steve's grave in pictures. It was now a bit of a tourist attraction; Steve had a picture of himself giving a friendly thumbs-up next to it.)
"I'm totally wearing the hat," said Tony as one of the stage hands clipped a microphone to his shirt.  "Oh, that's not going to work, is that wireless? Sorry, the reactor's gonna scramble that..."
"What?  No.  I mean... I get it.  I understand the need to... want to get even.  ...they'll get what's coming to them eventually, Stevie.  Just not as soon as we like.  Let's just... focus on SHIELD, okay?"
); Tony now owed him another $5,000.
Steve's mouth tasted sweet and familiar, Steve's body warm and inviting under him.  He was vaguely aware of how casually he'd dismissed Pepper, who'd gone out of her way to check up on him, but he could make it up to her later; his concerns had shrunk down to Steve again.  Still licking into Steve's mouth, working his jaw desperately, he reached down with one hand to push up the damp towel around Steve's waist and feel between his legs.
"I thought no one would ever ask," said Tony.
That was the worst part.  The knowledge that, in all likelihood, Bucky was the more dominant Alpha, and he had gotten to Steve first.
"Steve. Come on. Drink."
Steve a held out a hand for a pen. "What do I have to sign?" He clearly wanted to leave already.
"...inside..." he mumbled weakly, arching.  "...
"Don't pull out my arc reactor," he said hoarsely.
, Steve to be okay.  The ringing in his ears was still there, still obnoxiously loud, but Tony could hear enough to tell that they thought he was the one that needed treatment and it was infuriating because he was motherfucking Iron Man and his omega was bleeding and clearly they weren't doing their goddamn jobs correctly because it was clear to Tony that Steve should be a top priority, considering the burns and the handful of glass and the bruise forming on his jaw and the bruise forming on his temple.
Tony replied by placing a hand on the back of Steve's head and giving him a small push toward his crotch.
"Stick your dick in it," said Tony.
They stepped into, what looked like, a fairly normal office block building. Steve walked into the lift comfortably like he'd been there before and pressed the button for the twenty-third floor. The lift doors slipped close and Steve reached out to take Tony's hand, running the pad of his thumb over his knuckles.
Tony looked over his shoulder; he'd been in the middle of singing "Carry on my Wayward Son," loudly.
Steve nodded his gaze dropping to the floor. "Right. Sunday."
"Now, he's not old enough to remember
"Not yours?" Ty asked, raising a brow. Steve frowned a little.
"...yeah, just for relaxing.  I was thinking of just hanging out around the pool.  Maybe hitting the gym and sauna. Taking care of myself."  During the two months in Colorado, Tony had done literally nothing that would be considered even remotely healthy.
Steve's phone chimed.  A single text message from Clint:   :)
"Tony?  You okay?" asked Sam, walking up behind him.
do you think you're doing, messing with
...seventy years ago, Steve would have said yes.  That life was too short.  But now it kind of felt like life was too long, for him, anyway.  All of his friends were dead or dying.  He didn’t know anyone here.  Natasha and Clint were good friends, and Phil was certainly… attentive.  But that was it, really.  His old life had been too short, certainly, but Steve wasn’t so sure about this one.
for.  I'm going whether you like it or not. You have a day to make up your mind about tagging along," he told him and then back to head up the stairs to the house itself. This argument wasn't going to get either of them anywhere.
call me a spade again," snarled Pietro, and he spat out his gum before climbing off the man.
going to fight!" he snapped.  He gave Steve a shove, but Steve didn't budge; he was as solid as a brick wall.  "Steve, Pepper, get the hell out of here, get everyone out, now, it's too dangerous, go!"
Pepper.  That was who he wanted to call, more than anyone.
Steve's breath hitched at Tony's touch, especially as one hand slid down to his thigh and near one of his most intimate areas. "Tony. I--" He felt hot all over. Almost like he was embarrassed. Steve understood why Tony was doing this, why he felt like he should. But the thought of it alone was enough to make him squirm. This was all about Steve and how Steve was feeling and it was uncharacteristic of Tony to be anything other than completely selfish.
he reassured himself.
"He still is, Tony."
"Rogers," said Fury with a small, tight nod.  "Unless I knew better, I would say that your brain seems to have a bit of an obsession with James Buchanan Barnes."  He held up a manila folder: Steve's records.  SHIELD knew Steve's past to a disturbing degree.  They knew Steve's previous relationship with Barnes.  It was on file, inaccessible to anyone other than those with top security clearance and permission to access it.  But still on record.
"So, where do you want me?"
He found it interesting how simply Steve had described their emotional experiences.  He'd never thought much about it, but it was true. Tony felt fear and sadness and shame from Steve, but Steve always reacted strongly when Tony was angry.  He'd never stopped and considered they felt the bond with different intensities. It made sense, though, the way Steve explained it.
"...well we're gonna fucking try!" snapped Tony, aware that his own fear was starting to curdle inside of him.
Unfortunately it was nowhere near the arc reactor, which is where it was supposed to be pointing.
loved
"Thanks Nat."
...was it possible that palladium poisoning caused hallucinations?  Perhaps none of this was ever real.
"Wouldn't have it any other way," said Tony with a yawn.  "...don't you have a couple of SHIELD head shrinks downstairs you gotta go mingle with?"
"It's beautiful, huh?" said Tony cheerfully as he showed Steve proudly around the penthouse, which included a helipad and a mechanical gantry programmed for his armor.  ("Not that I'll ever need it, but... y'know. Iron Man.")
isn't safe here. We need to leave."
... I'm kidding, I'm kidding!"  He gave Steve a grin. "I guess there won't be any Eskimo games today... you just want to cuddle in bed and watch movies?  Normally I just spend Christmas drinking eggnog alone."
There was a scar there, but it wasn't a bonding mark.  It was a subtle, thin surgical scar. Suspicion confirmed: she was an omega who'd been altered.
"She's my sister," said the omega, cocking his head.  "I love her. Are you scared of her?"
Tiberius had nearly thrown out his back getting Steve back into the bed, but he managed.
Steve tried to fight back the pang of his rejection. But when Tony pressed his hard on against his thigh it was hard to deny it. A wave of relief washed over him. He had to remind himself that his Alpha was sensitive and stopped himself from grinding against him. He let Tony control what they did and didn't do. Besides, Tony said himself that he was doing great.
"I missed you too," Steve said, words thick. "Missed you from the day I woke up. Before I even knew you were alive..." Then he fell quiet.  Bucky fell asleep before Steve did, the weight of the last hour catching up to him.  Eventually, Steve drifted off too. It was strange to sleep next to him, a man he thought was dead for so long, a man he knew was a ruthless and efficient killer.
to punch things.
Tony pulled it, and just like that, the other man was merely a man, the cables merely long wires.  Tony's fist closed, crushing the reactor, and he staggered back, staring at the man lying on the pavement, spitting out blood.  Police and medics were swarming them.  Tony stood in the suit, wanting nothing more than to drop to his knees, but not daring, all too aware that the whole world was watching him.
"From what I remember your father was egotistical. Clever, stupidly brave-- like you. But that was where it ended.  We weren't close; I didn't know him as well as I know you now, Tony.  And, for the record, I was severely freaked out when I found out he spent years searching for me," Steve said, words careful and measured. He hadn't let go of Tony just yet. That was probably the only reason Tony hadn't bolted.  Steve was talking about his father, and Tony's mind went into top gear, trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about.  Four conversations?  Steve didn't even look like he was in his thirties yet; Tony couldn't fathom how Steve could claim to know his father, when his father had been dead for decades and Steve was clearly younger than him.
"...is it really as intense as everyone says?" asked Rhodes.
J. Jameson makes a cameo.
"I just... I thought I felt something but it's gone now," Steve whispered, head automatically arcing up to look at Tony as fingers ran through his hair. He'd missed that feeling the two months he'd been away. "It's fine Tony. I promise. I just had a moment. And now it's gone."
"What?"
"There it is... there you go," murmured Tony, both hands caressing Steve's body as he came.  He nuzzled the back of Steve's neck, peppering his skin with kisses.  "Good omega... good boy... yes..."
"About how much longer?" asked Donner.  "I've already been here for probably two or three hours and... and it took us an hour to get here..."
"But... but they're common, right?"
Banksy appeared out of nowhere and threw himself at Steve, wrapping his arms around him. The man was in a duck egg suit, a white shirt underneath. He looked lovely, as always. He was also clearly a little tipsy. Banksy pressed a noisy kiss to Steve's cheek and then moved to pull Tony into a hug too.
"Didn't see anything," said Tony, eyes on Phil.  Brazinski and one of the bald men (the olive-skinned one with glasses) had pulled out notebooks.  So had Phil, but he was systematically tearing out pages and folding them into complicated shapes.  A madman's oragami. Tony's countertop was starting to take on the appearance of a very weird shrine.  "I woke up and Steve said something in Russian, then he tried to punch me. I smashed the first thing I could grab over his head and called the Mark VI.  That was it."
"I was wondering if I could thank the catering staff, actually. The food was amazing," Steve said.
Steve found he liked Gideon Malick even less than Pierce, but he still greeted him with a smile and a handshake. This was all about pleasantries after all, wasn't it? Irshad did not put on a smile for either of them, however. Steve admired her for that.  He wasn't sure why he didn't like these men and supposed it might just been a natural wariness around older male Alphas.  This wasn't unlike the last time he had been at the White House; Howard Stark and Franklin Roosevelt had got ragingly drunk together while Steve had sat, bored, in a corner.  No one had served him alcohol because of his status and despite his size he had felt small.
"Oh, she's getting chatted up by someone boyband singer." Arcadia waved a hand and then downed her glass and stood. "Come on. Let's go find you some whiskey;
"You're not really in a position to negotiate," said Pepper, crossing her arms.  "Steve, do you want anything? You should be eating, too. I'm going to make Phil a sandwich while I'm in here."  She stepped over them and opened the fridge.
"This isn't fun," he managed to mumble.  "I hate this, this isn't fun, I don't want to do heats anymore..."  He sucked at the skin on Steve's throat, whimpering, the hand in Steve's pants running over his wet, inviting hole.
It was Steve who broke away and stepped out first, knowing Tony lacked the self-control to do so.
"I just... I think you are
She walked through the living room, Phil not even hearing her come by because the music was so loud, and stepped into the kitchen a little hesitantly. Pepper glanced down quickly to see them tangled together on the floor and quickly shot her gaze up to the ceiling. She knew the kitchen well enough to feel her way around it. "I'm not looking," she assured them (well, Steve). "Tony, what do you want?"
"Oh a real fir- cracker. You'd love her. She's a professional boxer."
Tony actually gagged.  "Look, Don, the miracle of life is amazing and all but I'm a mechanic.  Your spawn terrifies me. Put your shirt down."
Deep down, he liked Steve.  He liked his moxie.  He liked how Steve was stubborn and headstrong.  He liked how Steve had thrown Happy to the floor the first time they met.  He liked how Steve didn't seem to even know he was an omega, how he strutted proudly around, head held high.  Howard would've loved him.  Tony begrudgingly admitted he cared about Steve.
"Right." Steve put his hands on his hips. "Who here believes every omega's bond is an Alpha's right?"
"Well, I didn't know about it; my invitation must have gotten lost in the mail.  I just saw the news.  Sounds like a party.  Hey, so, did your assistant book me that spot at the Expo?  I have something I think you're really, really gonna be blown away by."
"Look when I learned!" said Tony excitedly, reaching out to press behind Steve's ear.
The interview was at a local studio.  A talkshow called
"--yes!  Is he there?"
"SHIELD was convinced Tony was hiding something from them." Steve looked regretful. "It was the wrong decision, taking it. But it's easy to see that in hind sight. They honestly probably could have offered me any job and I would have said yes.  If it's any consolation, I found SHIELD bugs in my apartment, too," he told her.
fault his mate had been bonded, it was
"Well, Frankenstein's monster didn't."
"Maybe you should fill out this form again," said the nurse in annoyance, shoving a blank form at Tony.  He had marked "no" to everything; on the new form, he marked "yes" as the nurse inflated a blood pressure cuff around his upper arm.
"Oh my God.  Are you okay?" asked the woman, staring at him.
"Your safety is more important to Pierce than anything," Sitwell insisted. He was tapping away on his phone without even looking at the screen. Steve would have been impressed months ago but he soon realized being able to type without looking was normal, even with such small screens. He felt an odd itch to snatch Sitwell's phone away from him.
"Well, what else would I call it?  ...edwinium?"
Tony hit the jets and soared upward.
said the phone.
Another hand shot up.  "Is it true that you can't get them pregnant unless you knot them?"
More than half the Alphas at the table folded immediately, assuming Tony wouldn't take the gamble unless his hand was excellent.  Or perhaps they didn't want to win; a night with Steve was appealing but controlling him seemed impossible, anyway.
"Hello," she said, sounding surly.
Steve managed a smile, but anyone who knew him well enough would see that it didn't meet his eyes. "Something like that."
"You won't," Steve agreed and stared at his glass, half the scotch already gone. "We need you to pretend you want to buy an omega. A friend of ours is being passed around. You have to pretend you're happy with a scenting and buy him for us."
"You oughta see the other guy," said Tony bravely.  A couple of omegas behind him rolled their eyes.
Bucky closed the notebook, heart pounding.
She jogged across the field.  She was wearing jeans and boots as well; her breath came out in little puffs of steam.  "Hi, Steve! Long time, no see! Here!" She shoved something into his hand. "Here's your mission patch for Yemen.  Unofficial, of course." The patch she had handed him was an ankle bracelet with an American flag background. It definitely wasn't something Steve would be able to wear on his uniform.
Tony patted his knee.  "Come up here. Lay down in my lap for a while.  Lemme hold you."
"Well, good for you.  Most people wouldn't want to spend their honeymoons being attacked by terrorists, but--"
on edge, and he and Alexander Pierce kept glaring at each other and he wasn't sure why.  He didn't know Pierce well, although he knew enough.  The guy had turned down a Nobel Peace Prize and he was Fury's boss, for crying out loud.  He got the impression Pierce was just asking the wrong questions and Steve was looking for someone to be hostile to, but considering the exclusivity of the dinner, Tony wished he'd calm down a little.  Maybe Steve was just upset because Pierce was an incredibly dominant Alpha and Steve had been groped the last time he was at the White House.  Maybe that was it.
But Steve's gaze was fixed on the door in front of him. Lab number 9. It felt
He was still in a lot of clothes and terribly hot. Steve was trembling with a strange sort of excitement. He handed the sketchbook to Ty, clearly desperate for him to take it.
Tony doubted SHIELD would help him clean up his act.  Better organizations, notably AA, had tried.  "...Assuming I even pass the test.  That psyche test, that was insane, Steve.  And... my psyche, it's not exactly healthy, probably."
Tony sidled up to Eric.
He kissed Steve on the temple.
Donner looked up at him with a stormy gleam in his eyes. "You're not like the others. No one else cares what Gideon was like.  Why do you care about my ex-mate?  We're not bonded anymore.  What do you really want? And.... and why do you have two different names?"
He thought.
"But then what?"
He could smell the shakes when they brought into the car. The smell was sugary and sweet, almost pleasant.  Almost.  Steve's stomach was upset with tension.  But with his metabolism, anything sugary was usually appealing.
He sat.
Someone swore.
"Either they'll work it out or they won't," said Pepper, rising and tucking her phone away.  "I'm going to go shake Tony awake. Let's go... if they need space, we have no business being here.  I'll leave Marco and Daston outside in the hall... the rest of us can go... I don't know..."
He could see, fuzzily, a calendar on a desk in front of him.  March 16th, 1986.
"I gotta get to the hospital. My mate- I'm Tony fucking Stark! Move!" he pleaded with them.
.  I'll get the DJ to play it!" said Banksy excitedly.  He scurried off.
"You're not really supposed to call me Steve, but I also don't really see the harm in it," he said with a small smile and a shrug. Captain felt a bit funny from Tony. Especially considering all the different times he'd had Steve squirming underneath him in bed. This was a new dynamic which Steve guessed was exciting as well as... weird.
"More of my
He watched Tony slam the door behind him and felt a tug in his gut.
He got into the passenger's seat, twisting so he could stroke Steve's neck with his good hand, the one actually capable of feeling Steve's warmth.  It was instinctual, to check that their mark was still there, unaltered.  Thankfully, it was.  He traced it, their mark, and found that it was the same as it had been since 1936.
"Are you sure?  I distinctively remember two New Years ago--"
"Steve, get up, you're bleeding all over the sheets," said Tony, shaking him.  Was
"Certainly.  Would sixteen percent assuage your conscience?"
"You go shave; I'm just going to check on my room," said Steve, patting Tony's arm.  "Don't worry about your dad, Tony.  You're a different person than him."
He groaned into the floor.  This had happened before.  Failed suit tests always left his body battered the next day; his ankle was already screaming with protest.  Perhaps ironically, Tony had found the best way to get around these types of injuries was to throw on a suit, which let him walk off whatever malady he was suffering.  After all, the suit technically did all the work for him.
"No," said Tony, hoarsely.  Most of his answers over the last week had been monosyllabic.  Steve's name had become a forbidden word; he was simply "him."
Steve remembered the party vividly. It had been insanely intimidating. Even since waking up he'd never been exposed to anything like it. He must have called taxis for over ten different girls that night, cleaned up far too much sick and caught way too many people snorting lines of coke in the bathrooms.. .God, it had been exhausting. He remembered Tony being in pieces- and then finding out why; Steve's heart was in his throat when Tony had told him he was dying.
"I met Stark, you know.  I was surprised. Not a very dominant man," said Gene.
"No, Donner, wait-- you're still ill!  You don't want to ruin Gideon's car!" said Tony.
Fury's gaze flitted over him. "So...technically you're in heat now?" he affirmed.
A man went for him just as Steve heard a car engine starting. He twisted around and caught the guy in the jaw with his foot before slamming him into the ground. Then he jumped onto the car, bullets still flying. It was chaos. If anyone could see anything, it was only outlines, and clearly, they were afraid of shooting each other. They were no STRIKE team, that was sure.
"I don't know," Steve admitted, pressing his lips together in a thin line.
"I meant like
"Steve?  ...now that you're... bonded to him... again... you're not going to leave me, right?  We're still good, yeah?" asked Tony quietly. Steve still smelled weird and probably always would, now.
"Probably going to England.  Our anniversary is..." Shit.  Tony couldn't even remember. June first or maybe second.  First, he decided firmly; they was easier to remember. "...June first.  Should be nice, this time of year."
"Ew, work, no."
The way Tony was looking at him was overwhelming. Steve felt something seize in his chest and swallowed thickly. Before he knew it Tony's fingertips were tracing over the bow of his lips and he felt something flutter in his chest. On instinct Steve nipped at his fingertips lightly, playfully, his own blue eyes darkening a fraction.
"...can I have your autograph?"
"I'll tell you," Steve whispered and nodded a little. He almost sounded nervous. But he looked determined, this clearly meant a lot to him. Steve swallowed and let Tony sit up a bit so he could roll over, his dressing gown pooling down over one shoulder and exposing pale white skin.
"Come on, Tony, mates aren't designed to be away from each other.  This should come naturally."
"Well, come on.  Come have breakfast.  We'll give you the grand tour afterwards," said Laura, gesturing for Steve to follow her.
"Just bruising."
Arcadia looked sideways at Steve. "Eh-oh..."
Steve didn't really want to let go of Tony's hand, however.
"Don't think I can divulge that."
He needed his Alpha right now and he couldn't bear to lie to him. He swallowed.
And now he wanted access to a suit?
Brennan smiled a little tightly at him.
Once the tents were done Steve went to go find the counselors who were in prep. He walked into a tent, per Barb's instructions, and immediately found a load of women rushing up to him.
Karpov reached out and he flinched away, but Karpov was only going to pat his cheek again.  He relaxed.  "Good boy," said Karpov, gently, and the words were like music to his ears.
Steve was honestly so tired he just dropped down onto the sheets. He could catch up with the news once they'd landed. Right now he was in bed and he couldn't bear the thought of tearing himself out of it.
Tony lowered his voice, just in case.  "Dude. I'm so curious about this thing with the auctions, with like, Ashtray and stuff.  Don't you wonder where they went? If
Swift?  Oh my God, Steve, she is
Tony stepped out of the shower behind him and Steve half-watched him dress in the mirror with undisguised interest.
"All the memories are old.  His mind isn't healthy. You scrambled it up."
Clint sputtered a little.  "
," repeated the man on the floor insistently, his voice edged with pain.
"Not a good idea?  It's a
and covered in enamel, were proving impossible to melt.  Calcium orthophosphate, he'd learned, had a melting point of 1670 C, and so he'd resorted to chemical experiments, including popping his baby teeth into bowls of battery acid.
"Well, there go our notes.  I suppose it can't get much worse," said the woman, rising.
He sat up and strode over to the door, yanking it open.
"Installing a sunroof.  I figured if I was gonna be stuck here for a while I might as well work on my tan," said Tony.  "Move aside, I'm gonna hand this hammer over to Steve, I need this wider, Steve... like... maybe a half-meter wider, okay? Nat, I'm gonna throw some cables up, can you catch them and run them across the floor, toward the south end of the house?  Thanks."
Tony had been bumped ahead so many grades as a child that he'd never had sex ed.  His sex ed was limited to Obadiah telling him to be safe in college and tucking a condom in his wallet.  Therefore, he had no idea that what he was doing was courtship behavior.  Besides, he'd always limited himself to betas.  This behavior was new to him, and he was doing it not because he knew what he was doing, but because... well, it just
He felt sorry for the omega then because it seemed very difficult and lonely to be in charge of one's own self.  He lived in a neatly packaged world run by Karpov and its effectiveness, Karpov said, was a living allegory for what the world would be under HYDRA's guiding hand.  He should be proud, said Karpov, to have such an honored position, to be one of the first lucky people to have been granted this reprieve from their own destiny. He should be grateful.
Pepper had long since learned to channel her anger and annoyance toward Tony into production.  Really, it was the only way to deal with him. She went to the bedroom first, to try to clean up some of the mess there.  Not strictly her job, but Tony always gave the entire house staff the last week of December and the second week of March off so he could be alone.  She wasn't going to let a puddle of vomit sit around for a week, and she didn't expect anyone else to deal with it.
He got up and let himself out of the room to fetch Steve some paper.
Natasha held up his face plate.  "You're not going to be able to hit me without your targeting system."
They were knotted.
"I was watching Maury--"
Clint brushed Steve's hair away from his face.  "Yeah. We're here for you, buddy." He looked up to Phil and nodded.
Tony froze.
in SHIELD, too," said Clint.
Steve half smiled. "What's Rory like?"
What Tony had said shocked Steve. Not that Bucky had loved him, but that Tony could feel that. It was almost eerie.
It clearly wasn't nothing. Steve's hands trembled a little as they curled up in the sheets. Was it always going to be like this? Was he always going to be...broken? He felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and his eyes threatened to well up. He pressed his face against the mattress and let out a shuddering breath. "It's never felt like this before. It doesn't hurt, it just-- I don't know; it feels different," he said, then sniffed against the pillows.
Joan and Maria were both beaming.  Tony couldn't help but feel a bit jealous.  He sometimes forgot about how buff Steve was, how good-looking.  Tony was used to being fawned over, but the two Jameson omegas barely seemed to notice him.  On the bright side, John being so friendly with them had clearly impressed everyone in the immediate vicinity and they were getting a lot less glares from Alphas.  Some of the omegas were watching Steve with interest, clearly a bit more relaxed now that Joan and Maria had broken the ice. Plus, Malick had stormed off. Tony would take giggling Captain America fans over Malick's malice any day.
"No!" he barked.  This close, he could smell him.  It only reinforced what he was doing.  He had to protect him with himself, had to lie on him like this.
Suddenly Phil stuck his head out, phone in hand, a tired smile on his face.  "When you're done, Rogers, send a tweet to Jeffrey Walker. He just had twin girls."
"You know..." He cleared his throat. "If you want something you
."  A male voice was coming in clearly, a strong voice with a New York accent, filled with charm.  "We're late, pal. The reservations are for six. I already laid out your clothes. Come on, lazy bones, get up!"  A firm hand on Steve's shoulder was shaking him insistently.
He nuzzled a kiss onto Steve's lips, his hands running over Steve's body lovingly.  He hadn't forgotten Gleason's warning about using protection; the condoms were on the bedside table.  Tony was hungry and his head was pounding, but he didn't care about that. He just wanted to pleasure his omega and then go to bed for twelve hours.  The events in that bunker had taken a lot out of him. Hell, he was even considering taking up smoking again.
Justin burst into laughter and covered the phone briefly to call to someone behind him.  "Jack!  Jack, oh my God, Tony Stark just told me his assistant was his own omega..."  He turned back to the phone.  "You really
"Sorry, I'm not...I'm not used to tech yet. Not on this level. Stuff like jets I can understand- that sort of thing is familiar. But laptops, phones? It's all new. We had nothing like that back in my day."
A moment later he was on the floor convulsing, a couple of taser leads in his cheek.
left Tony's lips. He clenched around him in confirmation, aiming his hips down just right so Tony's cock graze against his prostate. He moaned loudly.
Tony had been reassured Steve would return the next night, but alone in bed, he stayed up, staring at the swirled white patterns on the ceilings, which were illuminated by his chest, and he wondered if he even wanted Steve back.  Steve had made it clear that he didn't want Tony messing around with his brain, and Tony had very purposely avoided trying to bother Steve with their bond.
Tony's hands roamed over Steve's body, stroking his chest and sides and stomach.
She turned suddenly to a passing omega, who was bearing a tray of champagne.  "YOU! BOY!"
Pepper barely glanced up.  "Oh, good, you finally learned my real name."
A childish yet whimsical thought passed through his mind. Steve suddenly ached for his mother, a woman over 75 years dead... but least she would know what to do. And that, in some strange way, was a comforting thought.
"James.  Why'd you do it?  Why'd you bond him?"
"Oho!  What are you up to over here?" he said to Steve, like Steve was a child that had wandered off from its mother.  "Where's Tony?" He scanned the crowd. Tony was easy to find. He was getting a lot of attention due to his lack of clothes.  There was apparently no rule stating that you couldn't come in your underpants, because until now, there hadn't needed to be.
Mackenzie sighed. "If it makes you feel any better Stark, all of us would rather be somewhere else but...better safe than sorry. Christmas at home is better than Christmas in a...you know, a fight or something." He rubbed at the nape of his neck and his gaze flitted over to Steve and it was almost like they were sizing each other up for a moment. Sure, Mackenzie was as big as him (and perhaps taller) but he didn't have super strength. The thought of Steve going AWOL obviously still made him nervous.
Steve looked miserable and not at all interested in actually discussing pride parades.
Tony's phone beeped in his hand.
There were dark purple bruises on his wrist and the neck. The bruises on his neck an echo of what Bucky had left behind when he'd tried to take him. The cut on his stomach was just skin deep but it needed cleaning. Sam disappeared into the bathroom and grabbed the toothbrush holder, filling it with water for the flower.
But when he woke, she didn't even notice.  At some point she realized he was lying there, eyes open (albeit extremely puffy), staring off into the middle distance.  He hadn't moved at all.
"...yeah, you know, conversion therap--"
"I would rather die," Steve said flatly and the smile fell from his face. Malick didn't look like he believed him. Steve leaned forward. "I am not Captain America
!" exclaimed Tony with glee.
A man stepped before them. An Alpha, who Steve could instantly tell was a reporter. He was smiling too wide and his glasses were too big on his face.
"He needs water. We both need water," Steve said, his throat parched as he said it. The other omega nodded and briefly disappeared before he returned with a water bottle. Steve pushed the small tray back so it could be filled. Pietro filled it then pushed it back through the slot.
"I lied.  And it's Steve.  Not Stan.  Sorry, Pepper." And then he hung up.
"...we can leave after pizza..." mumbled Tony into his hand, slouching into the office chair, making no move to get himself a slice.
Steve frowned. "How do you
.  If he was such a crappy Alpha, Steve,
"What is this, go away, leave me alone, I'm fine!" snapped Tony.  "Happy! Pants!"
When the fight was finally over Steve let out a sigh of relief, eyes on Tony and not on the attacker as the man was pulled away. He was vaguely aware of Pepper telling Happy to bring the car around. But Steve just had his eyes on Tony. The man looked strangely isolated out there on the racetrack, as his adversary was being dragged away, as Tony stared down at the makeshift arc reactor in his hands. Something ached in Steve's chest. He still felt hot and strangely shivery, but he pushed it away.
And he had done this to himself.
It was grounding, calming; Steve slumped against hat he figured was a leg, eyes tracking the lines of Tony's face. Familiar and strong, the sharpness of his eyes piercing into Steve in that moment. Steve let out a ragged breath, his chest shuddering with every rise and fall.
Tony's feeling of relief evaporated completely.  He let out a nervous laugh.  "Wow, okay,
Kerry stepped forward, clearly interested as she plucked the business card from Tony's hand and inspected it. "Hm. I've never heard of her, but I'm sure she is worth checking out."
Something warmed in his chest. Steve knew people had certain... preconceptions of Tony, and it was nice to feel like he was breaking them.
Steve didn't recognize the Alphas either side of Gideon, but both of them were pretty similar to him; stretching middle aged, in slightly too-tight suits and not the best in the looks department. Did Gideon have a mate, he wondered? Steve struggled to imagine someone who wasn't having a miserable time of it.
"...do you mean does he have herpes now, or do you mean from the miscarriage?"
?  I'm not allowed to
"You must make coffee every morning for Ron, huh?"
Upstairs, Tony slipped into the lounge, closed the door behind him, and settled next to Steve.  "I got you ice.  And medicine.  And this necklace," he said, setting then on the floor beside the couch.  Steve's smell was making his mouth water.  "...you gonna be okay?"
Remembering their conversation from the previous night, he was listening to Taylor Swift.  She was okay.
"...JARVIS," Steve said slowly. "...can you pay forty grand from my account into James's?"
"De nada, de nada," replied Tony, pulling a second from the plastic ring and cracking it open.
“That’s not Taylor Swift, man,” said Rhodey, elbowing him.  “You’re an awful friend.
Tony's rough hands moved delicately over the pictures.  He wasn't sure how to feel about this. Tony's house was decorated with inoffensive, meaningless modern arm.  Shapes and colors. Not people.
Tony gave Steve free rein over the menu; Steve went overboard, promptly ordering nearly everything on the menu and then some.
Tony already knew the truth, which lay somewhere in between.  The serum had never been meant for omegas at all. Yes, they'd chosen Steve because at least a few of them thought Steve's gumption was admirable.  But Steve's status had certainly factored in. Steve was a human guinea pig; they never would have given the very first dose to a perfectly healthy Alpha soldier.  Steve had been allowed to join the army with the understanding that he was a human test subject, to be treated like an Alpha and to confirm the serum was safe for the "real" soldiers.  Once they had perfected it with Steve, the plan had been to give it to the Alphas, but no one had ever quite been able to replicate the extra product a second time. The serum made far too many Alphas go feral, to get overly aggressive, and the project had been scrapped entirely in the eighties (at least in America).
"...Bucky."
"Come in!" Aria appeared behind her. "I got this surprise for you, Steve!"
Tony's hand paused on Steve's head.  "Don't want to ruin... what?" He didn't understand what the hell Steve was talking about, but he was more concerned with comforting him.  Now that Steve wasn't staring him down, Tony's anger had shifted into protectiveness. The fact that he was the source of Steve's distress wasn't registering.  "Steve, you're not... not ruining anything... you're being good... I love you," said Tony, pressing Steve's head comfortingly into his leg.
"About half this job is timing," said Sam, crouched motionless across the roof.  "You gotta be patient."
!" barked Aria, steering Steve back toward the party.
The phone chimed.  Tony reached for it, couldn't get to it without pulling on his dick (which was overly sensitive and didn't want to be tugged on), and gave up.
But as much as Tony hated to be vulnerable, he'd decided already to pursue this.  He was, after all, a scientist, and curiosity drove him.  Besides, he had nothing better to do.  Pepper was running the company now.  The Expo was going smoothly.  Rhodey and the rest of the US government were probably tearing the suit Rhodey had taken to pieces and arming it, maybe slapping on a new coat of paint.  Everything was turning its gears, marching steadily forward, into the future, and it was all happening without Tony.  Tony rarely had the opportunity to be as not busy as he was now.  Besides, the crushing feeling he'd felt after kicking Steve out had been torture.  An agony worse than death.  He sure as hell wasn't going to try it again.  He didn't want to be separated from Steve.  He wanted to explore Steve and Steve's life and if he got hurt, at least he wouldn't have any regrets about not traveling down that particular road of inquiry.
as soon as she could.  She told him that Pepper was handling
"We were asking Captain Rogers if he would consider an ad campaign," Ty said, watching Aria with some interest. She flicked through the diary.
Steve's gaze flitted to the floor. "I think maybe I'll do the music video thing...I dunno. It sounds fun. I don't want people to think I'm too serious.  Then they won't listen to me."
"Okay," said Tony.
"--I can put them on a plane to Miami but you know no one will escort them, and unless you arrange for passports, we're stuck on this godforsaken island," he was saying.  "I'm not leaving the asset. --well, can you just pick up the documents? ...no, I'm not giving them to the twins, are you stupid or something?" He sounded angry.
Steve looked up in alarm when he saw DeSoto. "I told you not to come in here." Maybe if he liked DeSoto, he wouldn't have minded so much. But Steve didn't like him in their personal space, not such a creepy and willing omega who stayed awake half the night just in case Tony 'wanted' him...urgh.  Steve knew, logically, it wasn't DeSoto's fault he was how he was.  But he still didn't like him.
Lowenstein and two other attorneys showed up, looking as shocked as everyone else that Pepper, all 114 pounds of her, was holding Donner in her arms.
"I think I'm working things out," he told her quietly. "I'll call tomorrow, yeah?" Steve said, voice a tad softer and then he hung up.
"S... S..." he whimpered, clinging to the omega, fingers raking down his back.  "
"I do believe you're capable of getting your own coffee, Tony," Ty breathed, his gaze darkening a fraction. This was an omega rights discussion; an Alpha wasn't welcome, certainly not within the first five minutes of it.
When Tony finally shifted enough so Steve could move he slipped free to stand up. He moved to the bathroom to clean himself up, not really having time to shower now. Steve spotted himself in the mirror and saw the collar, admittedly having sort of forgotten it was there... it didn't bother him so much here, in private. It was more that this was a collar that everyone had seen, people like Malick... Steve didn't like that. If they were going to do this more often it had to be one that was just for
“I’m on my end of town now,” Steve says. “I could come to you.”
Steve nods. “Yes. Deal.”
Steve just smiles again. He starts to respond, but his phone dings and he pulls it out of his pocket, eyebrows furrowing when he sees there are five new text messages, all from the same number.
“I could do clay, and then overlay it with a paint to make it look marble,” Steve says before his head catches up. “Won’t last as long as the marble, but won’t cost as much either.”
Steve’s hand slides under Tony’s shirt, touching his bare skin lightly. Tony makes a sound into his mouth before pulling away briefly to remove his jacket and then he pulls his shirt up over his head. Steve leans in, sucks a trail down Tony’s neck, stops just above what must be the scar he felt the first time he touched Tony.
“Really?”
“The gallery?”
Steve tries to twist a little so he can get a better look at Tony, but pain shoots though his back and he groans instead.
“Maybe even two sandwiches,” Steve promises.
“I want a perfect sculpture, not a probably sculpture,” Tony insists, and he takes another step. “Just do it. We’re both grown ups here.”
“Everything’s okay,” Steve murmurs quietly.
Steve knows that he’s been staying at Tony’s partly because he’s a little afraid to go home. He thinks that Paul might be watching him, waiting for him to come home alone after dark. But he hasn’t heard a peep since that night, so he also hopes that maybe the man has moved on; maybe he’s decided that Steve isn’t worth his trouble anymore.
They pretend to watch TV, but really sitting like this together is just an excuse to enjoy the closeness of each other. They haven’t slept together, in an intimate way, for a week. Just pressing against Tony is enough to make Steve burn a little hotter. He absentmindedly rubs himself against Tony’s body, and it’s only when Tony pretend coughs that Steve grins.
“Alright. Do you have somewhere with natural light?” Steve asks, clearing his throat so it doesn’t crack when he asks.
He pulls up his traffic feed from the accident, watches the black SUV weave across three lanes and slam into Steve’s small car. He watches Steve’s car end up on the other side of the road, and then seconds later get slammed into head on. Tony doesn’t like to watch the next few minutes, because when the ambulance arrives, Steve is unresponsive. There is blood. Anyone else might have died in the accident, but Steve had made himself strong and survived worse than car accidents.
“Maybe.”
“Tony,” he says. “I can’t do this.”
“I don’t want to hurt Tony,” Steve whispers.
Steve let’s himself meld into Tony’s touch, lets his defenses crumble a little bit further.
“You paid me for sex, Paul. That’s what it was.”
Steve smiles a bit. “I guess that’s a good reason to quit.”
Steve hurries through the store. He buys a loaf of bread, eggs, milk, butter, and syrup. He’s going to make a pretty simple breakfast of French toast, but Tony has a secret sweet tooth so he’s pretty sure it’ll be appreciated.
“It’s not a good idea.”
It only takes about five minutes, but when Steve has checked every closet and under the bed, he’s satisfied that he is home alone. He breathes a little easier, though his body doesn’t completely relax.
It was strange at first, because Steve wanted to find out what Tony liked, what drove him crazy. He wanted to find out because it was what he did with all his clients. Found out what they liked and used it to get them off faster. It helped make sure his workdays passed by quickly. But it took a few days for Steve to settle in, to realize that he didn’t want to rush things with Tony. He wanted to take it as slow as possible, learn what got Tony off because he wanted to please Tony. He wanted to make Tony feel good.
It takes hours, and all the trash bags Steve has left in his cabinet, to clean up the apartment. Most of his dishes have been destroyed and anything that looked important was either torn apart or shattered. Steve figures he probably lost everything of value he ever owned, not to mention his artwork that was completely destroyed. He doesn’t throw the art away, though. He stacks it back in the corner and decides that he’ll look at it later when he’s not feeling so nostalgic about it.
After the gallery fees and subtracting the 90% donation to charity, your portion of the sale came out to $90,823. A check has been enclosed. Thank you for your generous donation for the children’s cancer ward.
“You sure? Don’t overdo it.”
“Why didn’t you tell the police about that?”
Tony falls forward, his head resting against Steve’s chest. It takes about a minute for his mind to catch up, when he realizes it might be painful for Steve’s fractured rib if he doesn’t move, so he drops to the side, resting his hand on Steve’s chest instead. He thinks that maybe it’ll be enough of a weight to hold Steve in place, to stop him from leaving.
“Old news anyway,” Tony shrugs, and he flips through the channels until he lands on Godzilla. “You seen this one?”
“It means you can move on from it,” Tony insists.
When Steve is done talking, he exhales and tries not to look Tony in the eye. He’s embarrassed, winded for talking so much, and nervous for Tony’s response. After several moments of silence, Steve manages to look up and sees a look of bewilderment on Tony’s face.
He carves carefully with an expert hand, just forming the last few touches to Tony’s go-T, a few more waves for his hair. It takes about an hour, but he finally finishes and stands back. Even the pain in his stomach can’t take away the pride in his chest. This is his best work yet, he’s sure. A perfect rendition of Tony Stark.
It makes Steve feel a little…worthless, as if all he’s good for is to cause Tony worry and stress. Steve knows it’s not really true, but lately he just feels it. And the more the thinks it, the more he thinks he should just go on his own way and let Tony go back to the life of luxury he had before.
Tony shifts backwards a little bit so he can study Steve’s face, but he finally smiles. “I know you will,” he says. “Nothing can keep you down, right?”
“Keep the change,” Tony says, sending the kid on his way. He comes back to the couch and sits down, putting the pizza between them.
And then his phone buzzes and his greatest fear comes true. It’s a message from Tony. Simple, quick, it says, “You okay?”
“Sounds so.”
“I didn’t earn anything!”
“Then donate the rest of it to charity! Or rip up the check. Do whatever you want to with it. What do you want me to do?”
“Mr. Rogers,” the detective greets him. “Thank you for coming down. I’ve heard a bit from Mr. Stark. Just need to hear your side of things, and we can wrap this all up.”
Steve runs a hand across his face, trying to form words because he knows he needs to say something. Otherwise Tony might begin to worry, and he doesn’t want to be the cause of any more stress in Tony’s life.
“Just my back,” he says. “Maybe just bruised.”
“Right.”
“I think so.”
He glances at the clock, realizing that he’d been able to sleep for a few hours. His brain feels refreshed, though his body is still a little stiff from the events of the afternoon. As the seconds tick by, though, the peace he feels is replaced by the feeling of fear he’d been experiencing since the beginning of Paul’s threats. His body goes a little stiff and he sighs, knowing that even though things should be over, they are far from over.
“Oh yeah, I’m so close,” Steve says back, faking it in the best way possible.
“I’m right here, if you want me to be,” Tony says soothingly.
Tony grins, as if he knows exactly what Steve is talking about.
floor.”
Steve does. They hadn’t really talked about it, and Tony didn’t really know how to approach the subject anyway. He just watches as Steve scrolls through his messages, his eyes becoming more and more unreadable as the seconds tick by.
“We’ve got time,” Steve smiles, and he starts to help Tony unbutton his jeans, works them down his hips.
They sit there together for a few moments before the guy finally gets up off the bed and puts his clothes back on. He reaches into his wallet and pulls out the money owed, sitting it on the nightstand.
“Sorry it took me a while,” Steve says instantly, just to break the silence.
“Hey,” Tony says gently. “It’s okay. You can tell the detective anything. He’s here to help you.”
Steve takes another deep breath. “I want to go home,” he says. “I’m sorry I ruined the night.”
“Yes, you should,” Tony says back.
Sincerely,
Steve sighs. “Sort of. I was hurt, but this happened a few days ago.”
“I like this,” Steve says quietly. “Just being here with you, like this.”
Steve grins a little. “Sure, Tony.”
“Ah, I wish,” he said. “But I keep my meetings.”
“Hey, Phil,” Steve breathes. “I have a bit of a problem, and I don’t know how to handle it.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony groans. He reaches between them and wraps a hand around Steve, pumping slowly in tune with his thrusts. He wants this to last. He wants to make Steve feel so good that he’ll never want to leave.
Steve can’t help but to laugh back, and his chest feels a little less heavy. He presses his forehead against Tony’s for a second, sighing, breathing in his breath, and then kisses him gently.
He gets in the elevator and jams his thumb into the 51
Tony plays along. “Really? Because in my free time I go looking for starving artists to sculpt things for me. Sounds like we were bound to meet at some point.”
“Then come over tomorrow, and have a list of supplies sent to this number so I know what to have ordered.” Tony hands him a card with a phone number on it. “That’s my number, by the way,” he continues. “Don’t give it to anybody.”
“Alright,” Tony says. “How do we do this?”
“Good. Don’t respond. You need to block his number and forget he ever existed. He’s a lot of talk, but I don’t think he’d actually go as far as hunting you down. He’s a businessman, you know?”
Smiling, Steve just shrugs again. “I guess we’ll see where things go.”
“I’ve got a rooftop garden. Will that work?”
The blow job doesn’t last long: Steve’s been pent up for way too long, but when Tony laps up every bit of his come Steve starts to shift so he can repay the favor.
By noon, Steve was standing in front of Ryan’s penthouse door, hands shoved his pockets, waiting to be let in. When the door finally swings open, Ryan is there with a big, bright smile and welcomes him in like they’re best friends. And maybe they could have been, if they didn’t fuck each other.
with me, and stay with me, and I want you to be mine. Will you be mine, Steve? Please?”
When he’s satisfied with the varnish coat, he steps back and stands besides Tony to admire the work.
“Beautiful, as always,” Tony says.
But after two weeks, Steve knew it was time to take a break. Too much of a good thing was a bad thing, sort of deal. He was afraid to go home alone, but he also wanted Tony to have a break from him. Just in case Tony was getting tired of him constantly being there. Just in case Tony needed his space.
Steve tries to put his mind somewhere else, anywhere else. He’s glad that Paul usually comes pretty quick, but the pain doesn’t end until Steve comes, and that’s the hard part. He has to trick his body into believing that he likes this, that he wants this.
The shower lasts half an hour longer than it should. Tony asked,
Steve nods. “Yes. And you can’t buy it.”
When Steve wakes up from a dream, Tony’s naked body is still wrapped around him. Tony’s legs are intertwined with his, and his arm is draped around Steve’s chest. It takes a few moments to free himself from the grasp, but eventually Steve stands up and reaches into his dresser drawer for a pair of boxers.
He isn’t sure what this game Tony is playing is about. He knows it can’t be genuine interest, but maybe something else? Maybe Tony is toying with him on purpose. Maybe the billionaire is just bored and wants to mess with somebody’s head. That seems way more plausible than anything else that runs through his mind.
“I’m…,” he pauses. He doesn’t want to lie, but this feels like something he can’t tell Tony about. Not now. Not so soon. “I’m okay,” he finally says.
“No worries at all. We had a few buyers specifically request a Steve Rogers original, so I’m glad you got it here.”
“No,” Tony says quickly. “I like the distraction. Makes the deadline seem more imperative.”
Steve dusts off his hair and clothes again, taking a few minutes to sweep up as much of the saw dust on the floor as he can before he decides to call it a day. He gets on the elevator and heads down to the first floor, grabbing his phone quickly to shoot Tony a text. “Finished for the night. See you tomorrow,” he sends, and then he steps outside.
“Well, I made sure there would be stuff in here for you. In case you decided to become a chef again.”
“Yes.”
“It didn’t,” Steve says back quickly.
“I’d like it if you came by again.”
Steve can’t decide if Tony is admitting to being bisexual, and single, and if this is somehow a pickup line. His chest tightens, unsure of how to respond next.
Steve nods and unwraps his drawings. He sits them side-by-side, first the sad girl and then the happy scene he depicted. He watches the curator’s face, looking for signs of interest or annoyance. To his relief, the man smiles brightly at him.
“It’s alright, Steve,” Tony whispers, rubbing circles on his back. “I’ve got you. It’s okay.”
Tony nods, but he still doesn’t seem to want to give up any information. Not yet. He wants Steve to get better first, and then they can talk about what really happened in the accident, about who is
“Same time next week, Cap?”
Steve takes a deep breath and it shudders back out. He doesn’t want to get up, but his legs are falling asleep and he’s acted immature for long enough. He needs to get up so Tony can see that he is okay, that they are going to be okay.
Tony Stark and all the guests he will be hosting. Tony has all the money in the world. Why would he pay a random artist to make him a centerpiece for an extravagant party?
Steve pulls off and uses his thumb and forefinger to stave off Tony’s orgasm. When the risk has passed, Steve starts riffling through the drawer next to the couch for the lube and a condom he knows is there.
He goes and puts clothes on quickly and then heads outside. The valet must have seen him coming, because he’s got his car ready to go.
He goes straight into the ballroom and grabs his whittling knife, testing it in his hand a few times before he approaches the sculpture. He doesn’t like the way Tony’s wooden eyes stare at him, his disapproving scowl staring down.
“I want you,” Tony says when he can breathe again. “And not just for the sex. I want you to
He moves the extra block pieces out of the way so he can take a good look at the new slab he has formed. It looks excellent with nice, smooth sides. Just begging to be whittled into.
“I guess just thinking thoughts and making them into something tangible is peaceful,” Tony says.
“Just stiff,” Steve responds.
“I like that,” Tony says back, his voice curious and somewhat seductive.
Tony jumps anyway, but when he sees it’s Steve he smiles and pushes himself out from under the metal frame.
He manages to get in the shower, trying to just relax his body against the spray. He stays for fifteen minutes before he gets out, drying himself quickly and then going to find his clothes. He slowly maneuvers his legs into his pants, grimaces when he lifts his arms to put his shirt on, and then very slowly ties his shoes.
“It’s not my first rodeo, cowboy,” Tony says impatiently. “Hurry up.”
It’s three days later when Steve decides he can venture outside. He doesn’t really have anywhere to go but he’s tired of being cooped up inside.
“Tony,” Steve says suddenly. “I need to tell you something.”
“We’ll be late,” Tony says, sitting up quickly.
Steve doesn’t respond. Instead, he just closes his eyes and lets his exhaustion take over.
He turns so that he can press himself flat against Steve’s chest, reaching up with his mouth and sucking hard just above his collarbone. It leaves a mark, and Steve thinks it’s probably on purpose. Tony is claiming him, reminding him that they’re going
The saw isn’t long enough to cut all the way through, so when he’s done sawing through half, he moves to the other side and begins to saw the other side. Finally the block is in two pieces and Steve is covered in sawdust.
“And you, Tony. You have the most prestigious security in the whole country, and yet I was able to get in so easily. All I had to do was bring a couple bags of take out and the guard let me right through. You were so predictable. Can’t cook for yourselves because you’re so worthless. I just had to wait for the perfect time.”
“Okay,” Steve says again, waiting for the kicker. There has to be something to this project that he’s not understanding. It sounds like a pretty typical sculpture to him, pretty easy too. Might take the rest of the week to finish, but he’s confident he can do it.
“I can’t go home! My wife left me because of
“I know. You spent a million bucks on one of them.”
It’s morning when Steve stretches and realizes that Tony is still wrapped around him like an octopus. He stays put for a while until his bladder forces him to shift slowly so he can get up.
Steve’s stomach twists. He forgot about real life. He forgot about his clients, and his promises to them, and his responsibilities.
Speaking of Tony, Steve realizes that the house is very quiet. He heads into the living room, but he doesn’t see Tony, nor in the kitchen, or anywhere else. A moment of worry washes over him, but he pushes it down. There is no way Paul could have gotten into the tower. It wouldn’t be possible. There are tons of guards outside, and Tony invented his own security system.
“No. Stay.”
“Ticker’s still ticking,” Tony says, and he leans up, catching Steve’s lips again.
His eyes scan around the room and land on an elevator straight ahead. He really hopes no one is watching him being so indecisive because it looks pathetic, but he’s very nervous. He doesn’t feel like he belongs in this place. It’s too nice.
“You doing okay?” Tony questions quietly, reaching in to undo Steve’s seat belt.
“Or I can just go get my stuff from home and we can be back in one hour.”
your money.”
“Why did someone do this to you?”
Tony stares at the card for several seconds before his hand robotically reaches up and takes it, studying the design carefully. He flips the card over a couple times before looking back up at Steve.
“Wood?”
“Well, I wanted it marble. But I don’t think there’s enough time to order another slab and have it delivered before the party.”
“Um, well…,” he sighs again. “During our last encounter, he fractured one of my ribs.”
“What check?”
“I wish I could help you, Steve,” the detective says, and he looks sincere. “There is just no evidence.”
“And how so you know Mr. Swanson?”
Steve sighs. “I don’t know.”
he yells at himself, feeling more ashamed than anything else. Almost zero satisfaction from the orgasm because of how ashamed he feels.
“I just…wanted him to go away. I was embarrassed, I guess.”
Steve stands back a bit as the crowd swamps Tony, asking him questions and asking him what art he’s there to see. Steve is a bit relieved when Tony doesn’t mention their relationship, or that he’s there to support his boyfriend, or any number of things that might pertain to Steve at all. Instead, Tony just says he’s there to support local artists.
Steve is about to push Tony up a bit so he can unbutton his pants when Tony’s phone rings. They both curse.
“O-okay…,” Steve says.
“No problem. Sorry to bother you, I just needed your measurements for the sculpture.”
Steve laughs. “Me too, honestly. I wanted to call before I got started.”
“Is Lucas alright?” Steve asks, cutting his own thoughts off.
“Maybe you should sit down,” Tony says, gesturing to a chair across the hall.
“That’s good to know.”
“I need to stop by the art show anyway and drop off my piece. Have to be there by eight in the morning, and your place is just too far to make it there in traffic.”
Inside the room, Steve stares at his phone for several moments, trying not to read the messages too quickly. He doesn’t want to mistakenly freak out if he is just misunderstanding. But the last message he received, from Paul, wasn’t too hard to decipher. It was simply: “I’m going to find you, and I’m going to kill you.”
Steve nods. “Yes.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says back.
“Let’s get this over with,” Steve says confidently.
“Maybe I want to do this!” Steve says back rhetorically. He sounds stupid coming out, so he knows Tony doesn’t believe him, but it still gets his point across.
Steve stands up, still biting his lip. He’s pretty sure he tastes blood, but he needs to step a few paces away from Tony.
Steve looks at Tony out of the corner of his eye. He looks rigid still, but somewhat calmer now that they’re standing together. Steve wonders if this is the first time Tony has been held at gun point, because if it is, he’s handling it very well.
“72 hours?” Steve says. “That’s a long time.”
Tony shuffles out of his own clothes, suddenly naked and rubbing himself on Steve’s jean-clad thigh. Tony’s hands move to Steve’s pants, undoing the button and pulling them down Steve’s hips until he’s sitting there in just his boxers, the outline of his erection evident behind the fabric.
“Just talk to me,” Tony begs in another message.
He headed back to the curator’s office to thank him but found it empty. He waited for a few moments before checking the time and deciding he could probably help out around the gallery for an hour before the patrons started arriving, and then he’d change into his suit for the event.
!” he says, rolling his eyes.
“Missed you,” Tony breathes.
“Tony, Tony,” Steve grunts. “I-I want…,” he has to pause because Tony started to hum around his length. The vibrations send shockwaves through Steve’s body. “Tony, I want you to…fuck me. Please, god, Tony, fuck me.”
Tony presses his body against Steve’s again, this time not pulling back. It takes a few seconds for Steve to catch up but he quickly meets Tony’s kiss with the same fervor. They stay like that for several moments until both of them are out of breath. Steve is the one to pull away, resting his forehead against Tony’s while they pant.
Steve debates for a moment, because as much as he’d just love to give in to Tony and relax under his touch, he also needs to get this thing with the police over with. He wants to be able to give his undivided attention to Tony, and right now, it’s split between how good Tony’s hands feel under his shirt and the uneasy feeling in his chest he’s had since shortly after waking up.
“I’m sorry for causing so much trouble,” Steve says quietly.
“I need to go,” Steve whispers, barely audible.
“When did you become aware that Mr. Swanson was there?”
When Steve gets outside, the valet is somehow waiting with his car, keys in hand.
Maybe it’s intuition, but Tony’s eyes flutter open and he looks around the room, confused for a moment.
“How’re you feeling?” Tony asks, brushing his hands off on his pants and coming a few steps forward to peck Steve on the lips.
“Or was it a tax write off for you?” Steve says absentmindedly, not completely sure he even said it out loud.
“I’m not going anywhere. I promise.”
“Yeah? Where were you going? Maybe I’ll join you.”
“I’m sorry,” he says instantly. “I didn’t mean to be a cause of worry for you.”
“Just your hot ass,” Tony says, his voice seductive.
“Good night, Steve,” Tony says.
He slips his finger under the edge of the envelop and slowly opens it. Maybe it’s a list of people who were interested in his work, or maybe it’s a letter telling him to come pick up his work because it’s the only one that didn’t sell. But instead, he’s met with a check and a letter from the gallery.
“This is where the magic happens?” Tony questions.
“When can I go home?”
Story has been completed finally :-) I will continue to upload chapters. Final chapter count is 16.
“We don’t have to go right now,” Tony says, his fingertips gripping Steve closer again.
“You okay?” Steve asks, squeezing Tony’s hand again.
“Thank you?” Steve says, trying not to go red in the face.
When he’d said as much, though, Tony just laughed and insisted that it was him who was intimidated by Steve. Young, handsome, basically carved by the gods, and talented in ways Tony could never imagine. Tony was smart, yes, but he drew stick figures unless he had a program help him design something. Steve was a talented artist. Tony insisted that was far more impressive than just knowing things.
Steve watches Tony go, wondering why he’s here by himself, wondering what else Tony is doing. He knows it must be important, because everything Tony does is important, but it still doesn’t change the fact that he really, really wishes Tony would just come in the room, cuddle up with him, tell him everything is going to be okay one more time.
“Starving Artist’s of New York,” Tony says back.
“Nah, just…,” Phil trails off. “What’s up?” he asks again.
“Why not?”
him. It would be so easy to just forget the real world.
Today is pretty much the same. Ryan invites him in, pushes a beer into Steve’s hand, and they talk about Ryan’s secretary at work who keeps screwing everything up. They talk about Ryan’s dad and how he is in the hospital still, but that he’s expected to make a recovery soon. They talk about Ryan getting a dog, even though he’s not home much, but he’s lonely when he is home. They talk about how it’s supposed to rain today. They talk about how that team just scored and they’re definitely going to be in the playoffs.
“Because it gets me hot and we’re about to walk into a police station and I’d rather not have to deal with it in there.”
And Steve had run away. No explanation given, no apologies. He just ran away, leaving Tony to wonder if the kiss had been wrong. The hurt on Tony’s face was enough to make a lump grow in Steve’s throat again. Tony had put himself out there, and Steve had shot him down.
Steve stares at the letter, reads it a dozen times, turns it over in his hands looking for the “Gotcha!” stamp. The longer he looks at it, the more confused he becomes, and the more he thinks about it, suddenly, the more angry he gets.
“Do you want to be my boyfriend?” Tony asks.
It’s probably hours later when Steve shifts on the couch, groans a little, and then sits up. Tony shuts his laptop and scoots over beside him.
“So what do we do?” Steve asks.
“I was in the shower.”
“I don’t.”
He goes right to work, starting by creating a small ridge between the top of the pants and the bottom of the blazer jacket. He details it slightly, leaving the blazer open so that he can later decide what sort of shirt Tony should be wearing. He uses gentle strokes to show the curve of Tony’s spine under the blazer, carefully sculpting out the top of a hand inside a pocket, creating a detail for hidden fingers.
Tony pulls up the next camera, which watches the black SUV speed off and pull into a parking lot just outside viewing range. He pulls up neighboring cameras, and even hacks into the ATM camera across the street, but there is no way to zoom in on the person who jumps out of the SUV and takes off running on foot.
He plays it off and laugh a bit. “It’s easier, if you can feel what you’re drawing before you start. That way you have an idea of where the lines need to go, an invisible weight and texture that helps lead the way.”
Tony’s head cocks to the side, because he knows what
He grabs a pencil and the sketchpad from the top of the supply pile and follows Tony back to the elevator. They ascend once again until they reach the rooftop with a
at all. He means person; one person in particular. “It’ll be alright, Steve,” he says gently. “I have an army of guards just waiting for my beckoning call. I’m not going to let anybody hurt you.”
“You look beautiful,” Adam comments, his words coming out loud and happy.
He pulls out the supplies and Tony sits with his chin on his hands at the bar. Steve gets all the way up to the point of buttering the bread when he realizes that in fact, this part might require two hands. He sighs and turns, looking helplessly at Tony.
“Well,
“Hello?” he finally answers.
Steve smiles, as if that is the only thing that would stop them. He reaches into a cabinet by the bed and brings out a fresh bottle of lubricant and a condom. He presses them into Tony’s hands and then turns onto his back.
“That’s enough,” Steve says breathlessly. “Just fuck me, please Tony. Just fuck me already.”
“Think about what charity you’ll give it to?”
When Tony comes back, Steve tries to wipe the look of worry off his face. It doesn’t go unnoticed, though, and Tony slides his hand back in with Steve’s.
They have more small talk, but eventually Steve’s stomach grumbles and he decides he’d better go eat something before he gets grouchy. The curator wishes him well and waves him off.
“Did Mr. Swanson say anything to you?”
Steve just grins back, and he takes his time as he pulls out completely, then pushes back in slowly. He moans at the sensation, but he tries to keep his movements even. He doesn’t want to hurt Tony, and it has been a while since he’s topped.
When he gets to the ballroom, the varnish and a fresh brush is waiting for him. He inspects the sculpture first, making sure everything has dried as expected, before getting the brush ready. This last step probably won’t take more than an hour, and after that, he’ll be done. Tony doesn’t want it painted, and Steve will have no reason to come back to the tower. They can actually go on with their lives like this past week never happened.
They’re pulling up to the gallery, waiting in a valet line for someone to come take the keys so they can go inside. Tony takes Steve’s hand again, rubs soothing circles on the back of it.
Steve looks down and sees red blood seeping through his shirt, right over his nipple. He sighs and brushes it aside as if that will get rid of the blood.
Tony looks back at him suspiciously before drying his hands on a clean towel and cupping Steve’s cheek. “You doing okay?” he asks cautiously, as if Steve is suddenly behaving very strangely.
“Let’s talk about what happened first,” Blakely says. “Don’t worry, I just have a few questions about it.”
Steve leans forward and lets Tony’s arms envelop him. He wants to say something, to just apologize profusely about bringing Tony into this, but he can’t. He just holds onto Tony’s shirt tightly and lets him run soothing circles across his back.
Steve’s brush strokes are slow and precise. The varnish looks great on the statue and makes it shine. He admires how Tony looks in his wooden form, admires his own work. It may not have been carved from marble, but it looks brilliant anyway. It’ll be a great centerpiece for Tony’s birthday. And when people ask who carved it, Tony will feel a pain in his chest. He might not even tell anyone. He may just say he ordered it out of a catalog.
“I have an entire team of lawyers at my disposal, just waiting for this kind of thing. They would love to get their hands on scum like that.”
Tony shifts so that his chest is pressed flush against Steve’s. He rests his head in the nook between Steve’s neck and his shoulder.
Steve gasps, just one, quick breath that shudders through his body. He holds Tony for support, trying to keep his body upright. The first breath was rough, but the next few help with his panic. His face starts going back to the proper color, his eyes don’t look as frantic.
Tony kisses him again, this time more lightly. He kisses the edge of his lips, down to his neck, his hands traveling down to the edge of Steve’s shirt to pull him in closer.
Steve just rolls his eyes and brings his lips to Tony’s. He knows Tony is just joking, but there is also something serious about the way he really doesn’t want to leave. Not just that, but how he really doesn’t want
Steve grabs a bottle of water from the fridge and then heads down to the lab. He knows Tony has probably been in there all night, probably just minutes after Steve had fallen asleep. He is probably welding something, or building something, or drawing schematics for some new technology the world needs. Just anything to get his mind off Steve and his situation.
“Are you going straight there, or do you want a bag for the suit?”
“And I’ll be wearing something business-casual, like what I’m wearing now.”
Tony glares, but it’s just a playful one. He clenches again when Steve adds a second finger but manages to relax in record time, rocking again until Steve sighs and pulls his fingers out. He wipes his hand on a shirt from the floor and then goes for the condom.
Tony eyes him. “This man has hurt you physically and you don’t want to cause
“I really wasn’t expecting you to still be here,” Tony murmurs, taking one of Steve’s feet and massaging the sole. “I thought I was going to wake up all alone and then I’d have to come hunt you down.”
They continue through the gallery until finally coming to Steve’s work, and it might have been an exciting event for Tony to finally see the finished piece if there weren’t somebody else standing in front of it, wearing an expensive suit, hair slicked back, foot tapping impatiently.
“Let this be over, Paul. You can’t get out of this on your own. Let me help you.”
“Mr. Rogers,” Steve corrects, and then he laughs a bit. “And there is no Mr. Rogers currently. No kids either.”
“I don’t even know if you’re a real sculpture-ist,” Tony says. “Do you have any to show?”
“If you’re here to buy, go somewhere else,” Tony says, waving his hands at the curator.
Steve bites his lip. “I’m working, Tony,” he finally says, and he can tell Tony was not expecting that answer.
Steve grins. “I think I can manage to whip up something.”
“You’re okay now?”
“Finally,” Paul breathes, and he yanks Steve into the room. He wastes no time in pushing Steve backwards onto the bed, pinning him down, his knee coming to land painfully in the middle of Steve’s abdomen.
“You wouldn’t have to do this anymore,” Tony insists. “I can take care of you! You could have an art studio and just…make art all day. You could do whatever you wanted to.”
Tony groans again, but he backs off for just a second to yank his pants and boxers off in one swift movement. “Never enough time with you,” he says breathlessly, and then he reattaches them at the mouth, his painfully hard cock pressed between himself and Steve.
“No problem, sir.”
“The…the police don’t believe me,” Steve says carefully. “A detective was here earlier and said there’s no case. Everything will just…go away.”
He blushes a bit. “Sorry it took longer than expected.”
“Probably the food,” Tony breathes heavily.
They both gasp at the feeling, Steve trying to still himself to allow Tony time to adjust and Tony just pulling Steve deeper and deeper.
“You alright?” he questions, but Steve averts his eyes and is suddenly frozen in place. Paul is looking right at him too, and his sneer is unmistakable.
Steve nods and then heads inside. He’s not sure if Tony is avoiding him, or if he’s actually got things to do. He’s a busy man, after all. It’s likely that Tony is in a meeting, or hosting another event, or donating a million dollars to another hospital. It’s equally as likely that Tony is avoiding him, though. For good reason, Steve admits.
It makes Steve feel guilty. Tony is taking such good care of him, but he can’t do anything to repay him. He will never be rich enough, famous enough, good enough to be worth anything to Tony. He’s surprised things between them have gone on as long as they have, just a few weeks in, because of how unworthy he is of Tony’s affection.
“I realized that our impromptu agreement didn’t over the details in full,” Tony says as they get back on the elevator. “Payment, what you’re sculpting, that sort of thing.”
“Alright,” Steve agrees. “I’ll see you later tonight. I need to clean up at home. Need me to bring anything over?”
“I’m the art?” Tony laughs.
Tony looks up once more before lower his mouth down. He circles Steve’s cock with his tongue, licking once before slipping the head past his lips. Steve stiffens, and then he groans. He uses his hand to run through Tony’s hair, gently guiding himself deeper as Tony sucks him off.
Steve grins. “Absolutely.”
“Steve.”
? I’ve got everything he does. Money, cars. I’ve got it all. I’m even more attractive than him!”
“What’s yours?” Steve asks suddenly, because maybe if Tony has some “weird baggage” then he can feel better about things.
“What sort of people will be attending?”
“Yeah?” Tony says, and the excitement doesn’t escape his face. It’s been a while since Steve picked up a pencil to draw, and for some reason, it makes Tony happy when he talks about it.
Tony squints, reads over the letter, and then finally takes a step back and shrugs. “I didn’t know they’d send you something,” he says finally. “I didn’t know you got a commission.”
Blakely nods, but he pauses. “There will be trial, of course. You may be called as a witness, but it’s just a formality.”
But a chance to see Tony again is worth the trouble.
floor, then.”
“You sure?” Tony asks, his hands snaking under Steve’s shirt and resting on his hips.
Hours later, when Steve is cleared to go home, a nurse brings a wheel chair and insists on wheeling him outside. She says it’s hospital policy, but Steve wonders if maybe she just wants to see what kind of car he and Tony Stark are loading up into.
They’re quiet again for a while, and eventually Tony turns back to the movie and grabs another slice.
It’s a week later and Steve wakes up again alone. It’s almost noon, but the first thing he realizes is that Tony isn’t wrapped around him anymore. It’s not that surprising, though, seeing how late in the morning it is.
Tony finally opens the pizza box, helping himself to a slice and gesturing for Steve to do the same. They sit in silence for a bit, just chewing, and Steve pretending to watch Godzilla. It probably goes on for a full five minutes before Tony uncrosses his legs and turns slightly towards Steve.
Steve stiffens, but forces himself to relax before it becomes noticeable. “It turned out fine,” he said. “Not as big of a deal as I thought.”
“Steve,” Tony says, and then he eyes the sculpture. “It looks great!” Tony says enthusiastically. “You’re almost done.”
“As much as I would love to get this train started again,” Tony warns, “we do have a show to get to.”
“I can’t.”
Tony shrugs. “Why not?”
“The details weren’t really given. It was last-minute anyway.”
Traffic is killer, but eventually Steve makes it home. He stashes the money Ryan gave him in his security box under the bed and then jumps into the shower. He rushes through it and then dresses in fresh clothes, ones that will be comfortable to work in. He shoots Tony a quick, “I’ll be there soon” text and then hops back in the car to head towards Stark Tower.
“For what?” Tony responds.
Steve is still white faced, unable to do much besides look between Tony and Paul and wish he had not come out tonight.
Steve hesitates, but he knows he has to go. He knows he can’t do this with Tony right now. He’ll have plenty of time later to apologize, but right now, he has to go home. He needs to get a hold of himself and to forget about Paul. He needs to make sure that Paul’s threats are unfounded, because he’d threatened to ruin whoever he was with, and that happens to be Tony Stark. Steve refuses to be the reason Tony suffers.
,” before he starts pressing in.
“What’s wrong, Steve? Just tell me.”
Steve yaws, wondering what time it is, when Tony stands up.
Steve grins back, not sure what she’s insinuating.
He doesn’t get any more messages from Tony, and he falls asleep a short while later.
“You know what I mean.”
The water sloshes a bit when Tony sits down. Steve’s eyes tear away from the place Tony was just standing to look at his face, surprised when he doesn’t see confusion or disdain, but just pure, gentle eyes looking back at him.
Steve doesn’t know how to respond, so he just stares back, trying to get his thoughts to form into words. Tony doesn’t know that he’s Steve’s first real relationship, or that he’d given up his other life just for a chance to be with Tony. Tony doesn’t know that Steve likes the little things he does, too, like the way he puts off projects until the last minute, or the way he’s supportive in such a nonchalant way. Tony doesn’t know that Steve has been falling for him since they first met, too.
“I wanted to see it in its glory,” Tony says, and he stares at the painting for a long time appreciatively. Steve feels nervous as he stands there, but he doesn’t move away. He tries to see what Tony sees in his art, but to him, it’s just something he painted. It doesn’t look like anything special, and it wasn’t even very difficult to do. The hardest part was going home the one night to finish it.
“Tony, what’s—,” Steve starts, and then the rest of the living room comes into view, and he can see suddenly why Tony is so stiff.
“I’ll try not to leave that at home,” Steve laughs back. “I’ll let you go. Goodbye Tony.”
“It was less than twelve hours,” Steve laughs.
In total, Steve has five long-term clients. He used to take on new clients, or see multiple clients in a day, but he’s worked out a system that works for him. His work week begins on Thursday when he meets Ryan in his penthouse downtown. Ryan pays well, and they actually have fun together. It’s almost easy enough to forget that Ryan is work, and that when they both are satisfied, he’s going to pull out a large wad of cash and press it into Steve’s hand.
Tony had already checked out the entertainment.  Some country singer Tony had never heard of, and, surprisingly, Jessica Simpson, who was a beta who was apparently sympathetic... or perhaps they'd just paid her a lot.  Who knew? Tony had also bumped into the head of R&D for AccuTech, a subsidiary of Stark Industries, as well as three different Roxxon employees: Cindy Shelton, Jonas Harrow, and the fucking CEO himself, Dario Agger.  Tony and Jonas had butted horns before and they had spent most of the last workshop glaring at each other.
"Jesus Christ, give us a break!" snapped Tony, all too aware that Steve was still feeling the affect-effects of his panic attack.  Attempts to calm Steve down by reassuring him that they could cancel and didn't have to attend the conference had been ineffective; in fact, they'd pretty much worked Steve up even more.
When Tony came back, wearing a towel, it was under his arms instead of around his waist; the arc reactor was covered.
Clint looked over at Tony, grinning broadly.  "Wanna have a snowball fight with my kids and my Alpha, Steve?  Getting up and moving around might help you warm up... you're shivering."  Clint didn't bother to add how unusual that was. Steve radiated heat; his metabolism was easily four times greater than a normal man's.  Yet sitting on the porch, Steve had begun shaking a little. Clint assumed it might be the topic they were discussing more than the cold. And he felt like he'd said his bit; now he just wanted to relax, help Steve take his mind off things.
"So sedate him.  What's the problem?"
"Good news though!" Phil piped up as he walked in. He looked a new man, in a neatly pressed suit and his hair neat. He held a coffee in one hand and a tablet in the other (Phil's staples) and looked about ready to lead a conference. He was worlds away from the man who'd built a teepee out of sofa cushions. "If we go without incident into the new year, our captain is a free man. No more being stuck in the house."
"You fought Nazis? Dude. That's so cool." Lola said 'dude' a lot and was drinking through pints of pineapple juice. Apparently the waiter put shots of vodka in the glasses for her because she'd gotten with him once in high school; they went way back and, according to Lola, might have gotten married if she hadn't ended up bonded.  Lola was in denim shorts and a plaid shirt and seemed the epitome of laid back.
"Bullets can't stop Cap, right?" prompted Kate.
he smelled.  Oh, God.  Rich and ripe and velvety and luxurious and eager and willing and juicy and--
It required a fuckton of calibrations and placing magnets and wires all over his body, to the point that he thought he looks vaguely like one of those motion-capture guys in front of a green screen, but it was a start.
"Put on hold," said Justin quickly.  "Just a small, temporary--"
He was so dedicated to his task he nearly walked right in to a room full of people.  Steve quickly ducked out of the way and stuck his head around the doorway. He blinked, eyes widening. There were at least a half-dozen men clustered around a chair, all Alphas, arguing loudly in Russian and German and English.  Steve's skin crawled at the sound of the German.  The chair they were clustered around held a slumped-over man with long hair.  A prisoner?
Tony he pulled away from Steve, glaring.  "You've been back over half a year and you've been on at least one mission.  You
"Please. Please I want it. Tony I want it. I want you to fill me up, Alpha, please. I love it. Love being so full of you," Steve panted, head ducked down between his biceps as he moaned loudly. He clenched around Tony as he drew out, teasing at his cock. And then when Tony thrust inside again and twisted his wrist Steve came with a groan, spilling onto Tony's hand and the bed sheets beneath them.
But what a day it had been.
"Steve?  ...can I... you mind if I climb into bed with you?" asked Tony tentatively.  Even though all evidence pointed to Steve not having been raped, the bite on the back of his neck might as well have been the same thing, and Tony didn't know how much contact Steve wanted right now.  Tony desperately wanted to hold him but he didn't feel like he had much right to demand cuddles after what he'd put Steve through. This was his fault, after all, pushing Steve away until he finally cracked.
The only thing he knew how to do was follow orders, and now his objectives had disappeared and his order-giver was gone.
"I'm... gonna go to the toilet," Steve said. A bald-faced lie, but he needed to get away.
Tony felt bad that he and Steve probably both saw DeSoto a bit like a dim child.  It was hard not to. Surely there was some personality under there, but it was buried deep, and Tony didn't have the time or patience to befriend DeSoto and just ask him normally.  He wasn't above using manipulation to get what he wanted. But he didn't want to treat an omega like the other Alphas did, especially not in front of Steve. Not without Steve's awareness of what he was doing, and his permission.
Tony got to his feet and staggered out of the shop.  He eased his way up the stairs, stiff from work but not as sore as he'd been in the aftermath of the fight at the expo, and made his way down the hall toward their bedroom.
This is your last chance to submit naming ideas for OR parts 1-4.
"Sure," said Tiberius, rising.  He hesitated, then added, "Steve, I hope this doesn't some presumptuous.  But... as far as hearing things and seeing things... I really want to emphasize that, well, I'll never have this.  And living it vicariously, through you two... it's the closest I'll ever have. It's almost like being in a trio. It's nice.  I hope that doesn't make you feel strange. I know I'm not part of your and Tony's bond. I just... I want you to understand that this is far from only a favor.  It's an honor."
Tony offered Steve the remote and curled onto the couch, setting his head in Steve's lap.  He gestured lazily.  "Whatever you want, Steve.  I just want to-"
Despite being sweaty and tired Donner was almost glowing now. Steve had never seen him so happy before.
The moment the flag waved, Tony hit the accelerator and he was off.  All his talk about a racecar being like the suit immediately evaporated; he was going two hundred miles an hour only a few feet from the ground and, unlike in the suit, he had no ability to maneuver if something got in his way.  Tony found himself laughing, a combination of hysterical nervousness and joy and reckless abandon.  Knowing he was one false move from death made him feel...
He checked the clock by the bed automatically, but there was no note.  Tony felt oddly disappointed.  He didn't consider himself sentimental, not in the slightest.  But he'd tucked the previous two notes into his wallet, unable to discard them
He tried to pull out only to discover he couldn't.
When he went back upstairs he found Tony still passed out and/or sleep. Steve imagined he would be that way until morning at least.
He hadn't even heard him coming. He hadn't even seem him.
"I'll go in a suit too; I don't know what else I would wear," Steve said with a shrug. He reached for some toast that had been left on the coffee table. It was slathered in butter.
He realized, too late, that the thing was locking and that he couldn't really take it off even if he wanted to; he'd need to get the key, which was probably buried in their luggage, and the two of them were stuck fast together.
Steve was beginning to move forward towards Tony on the bed, his hands crawling closer to his Alpha because all he could think about now was pleasing him. And having Tony inside of him.
Steve smiled. Phil really was the best. He dressed in blue jeans and a white t-shirt (that didn't hide much of him) for the day. He called for breakfast for three, spotting DeSoto asleep on the sofa. He'd drunk a lot of rum. Huh. The bottle was almost empty...maybe he'd picked up his Alpha's drinking habits. Or he maybe he wasn't allowed to drink around his Alpha and this was a rare opportunity to indulge. Steve frowned at both possibilities.
Tony bent down; some small part of his brain protested but he shoved it aside easily and a moment later his lips were on Steve's cock, his hands on Steve's thighs, and he was gently kissing it, nosing the shaft and hesitating for only a split second before drawing it into his mouth.  He had to admit, he loved sucking on things. Of course, it was normally tits. Probably because he wasn't breast-fed as a child.
been bonded, since 1936, since Steve's mother had died and he'd been all alone and Bucky had taken him in?  ...yes, that seemed right.
He got up and loped downstairs, still in his sweats and his Jack Daniels shirt.  He stopped short when he spied Pepper sitting at the island counter in the kitchen, eating vegetable chips and reading through his mail.
Justin didn't seem the slightest bit embarrassed to discover Steve's true identity.  He inclined his head toward the blond with an unsettling level of friendly familiarity.  "Gotta hand it to you- hiding in plain sight?  Very clever.  Is it back to
Tony squirmed a little against Steve's grip, liking Steve's suggestion of the two of them heading back upstairs.  Steve's hands were still clutching his wrists.
Tony sprang up, teeth bared and hackles up.  Unfortunately he was still wearing a fuzzy, bright yellow sweater.
"How do you want me?" Steve asked Tony in a murmur as the backs of his legs nudged the mattress behind him.
"I just never noticed."
"No, but Barton nearly got tried for treason," she said, mouth still quivering.  "You think
"What?"
Another doctor, a beta woman, was about to respond when Phil smoothly butt in. "Then we'll have to pursue some form of investigation. This is all in your best interests, Captain."
The word "king" brought to mind, at least for Tony, a man in furs and codpieces and a big gold crown.  The Wakandan king was a regular man. He was wearing a regular suit. He was sitting at a table with another, younger man, but rose when they entered.  The rest of the restaurant was empty except for all the security all over the place. His hair was just beginning to grey but he still had a spring in his step, the vitality of youth.  He shook Steve's hand before turning to Tony, who was slightly irked at his omega being greeted before him.
"I think you need to sleep it off, first.  Steve can take you home," said Natasha.  She pulled out her phone and began texting on it.
Vanko.  Vanko, who would do anything to exact revenge.  Who did not care about upstaging Tony.  Whose primary goal was to kill him, to cause him harm and pain.  Who had probably just heard Tony publicly announce that he was bonded...
"Rhodey!  Rhodey, listen, Vanko--" began Tony.
She didn't look Tony in the eye much these days. Truly, Aria was too scared that she might say something she shouldn't. This was Pepper's problem, not hers, and she knew she should stay out of it.
"Oh hi," he said, trying to look casual.  He was suddenly very aware that he was naked and holding a bottle of liquor.  "...believe it or not, I did get work done this morning.  I just came back from a flight.  How was your run?"
"Tell us--"  Slap.  "--the name--" Slap.  "--of your--" Slap.
"We've located the whereabouts of the captain, and of his mate," reported von Strucker.
"I want to feel him," repeated Bucky, stubbornly.  A pause. "...please, Wanda."
Felt what?  He couldn't put it into words.  But he'd felt fear, fear and hurt, and it was definitely not his own, and he could smell Steve's uneasiness.  He was in Steve's lap before he could stop himself, covering the other with his body, nuzzling comfort into his neck.
They pulled up to a thoroughly modern-looking house that was lit up with warm lights; Happy navigated slowly through a brass gate that was opened for him by a man in a suit.  There was a fountain outside and a mish-mash of fancy sports cars and SUVs with tinted windows that looked similar to the one they were in.
"Flirting with girls half his age while inebriated? Touching up his exes in front of you? And, all in all, not appreciating whatsoever how goddamn lucky he is to have you? You're wasted on him, Captain Rogers. And if you only had a male mate before, and now Mr. Stark, surely you want to know what the other half of us tastes like," she half-smiled and her breath was hot against Steve's jaw.
A third guard had joined the two and was gesturing widely.  He was holding a flashlight. Tony smiled a little. He was guessing there were generators for the lower floors but at least on the surface, everything was offline.
oh, shit, this is bad, how did they--
Tony looked over at Steve.  He assumed Steve had gotten most of that.  Super-hearing and all. "Do you-- do you think he could be alive?"
"Didn't really think this was your scene," a blonde girl piped up.
Steve sat cross-legged on the floor, rifling through the box with gentle hands. He thumbed over the badge and he had to swallow down the lump in his throat again. He swallowed. All the remaining pieces of his past...crowded up into a shoebox. Maybe it was a little sad to have lost so much but he was still so grateful to Tony for just having this small part of his old life to show him. There was a photo of Dugan laughing. The photo didn't need to be in colour for Steve to know just what shade of pink his cheeks must of been.
asked me to book for you
"...Steve, light bulb!
Especially when he'd called Steve
.  ...Natasha's just being paranoid."
He found a chair offstage to watch the acts, trying to pace out his drinking, a feat easier said than done.  He kept an eye on Steve, offering him a smile whenever he could, even though he knew Steve could probably feel and smell his depression.  Steve, however, seemed distracted. Famous singers and actors and activists and comedians and politicians were coming at him from all sides to shake his hand and support him, and on top of that, Steve had Aria.
"I would but I think you need to sober up and get some sleep Tony," Steve told him calmly, not sounding annoyed. He knelt down by the pool side but made no move to get in. He laughed when Tony splashed at him, some of the water landing on his cheek. He reached up a hand to rub it off. "No gin. But I can get you pizza. You're probably starving. One minute--"
"...what?"
Steve blinked.
. Steve and Tony were just tangled together, not speaking either. He was just grateful to hear his Alpha breathing properly, or at least, actually
He wanted someone familiar.  An Alpha.  Someone who knew him, someone who knew him as more than simply
, I'm just warning you. His job is seriously on the line here. He misused government resources. And he, well...they're going to need a statement from you."
On the other line, Pepper was seated at her desk; she was on her third cup of tea and had been at work since six on the dot.  Her knowledge of Tony's whereabouts had been woefully inadequate the last few days; since Monaco, she felt she'd earned a break.  As far as she knew, Tony had insisted on throwing a party, half-demolished his house, estranged his best friend, possibly given up the suit design (she had the S.I. patent lawyers on speed dial), disappeared for two days, and, if social media was to be believed, had recently been spotted in a bar in Koreatown, where he had bought everyone free drinks and nearly beaten up someone (in some versions he'd attacked him with a spoon) for no discernible reason.
Steve didn't look impressed.  He looked horrified.
if you get probation!  Right now I'm fighting treason charges against you!  You have any idea how much a QuinJet costs?"
"I... I want to put it on you," said Tony.  It was almost a question. Because Tony was pretty sure he'd always feel guilty for liking it, no matter how many times Steve assured Tony he wasn't at all like "the others."
"I don't have any family," he said.  Then, he added, "Well, except an omega.  I have an omega."
"War's never good.  War's never pretty," said Steve mildly.  "Sometimes, it's necessary.  But it's never good."
"Tony, I'm seriously right in the middle of--"
Steve smiled sadly and let Tony pull in close, wrapping an arm around him as he moved to let Tony lie on top of him. He felt a lump threaten to rise in his throat and swallowed it down. "I would if I could Tony," he murmured and ran his fingers through the other's hair still, trying to calm him down.
Of course he did.  Except that Steve wasn't "his" omega.  Some other Alpha had claimed him and Steve hadn't thought it was important to mention.  Sure, maybe Tony could track the guy down, fight over Steve.  But what was the point?  If the guy was still alive he was ancient; what would he prove by beating up an old man?  And Tony wasn't a dominant Alpha- he never had been.  Winning a fight against a disabled opponent wouldn't count for much if the other guy's dominance ranking was higher than his.  Kicking the ass of an elderly man would not raise his dominance; it was an inherent part of him, as much as his eye color or height was.
Malick growled, dander rising; a man named Andy took his arm.  "Let it go, Gideon."
"But maybe it does. Maybe it matters but you don't realise it in your head. You have three hours to account for, dude, and not all of that is buying phones and talking to Fury."
The moment Tony's mouth was on him Steve arched up. "Shit, Tony!  ...not gonna last like this. Oh-oh G-God..." Steve's eyes rolled back in his head and he stiffened, clenching around the toy before he came into Tony's mouth. He rode out his orgasm with small thrusts of his hips.
"Sitwell didn't report a call received," interrupted Natasha.  "They talked for two minutes and Sitwell never thought to tell SHIELD?"
"We need to do the scan, Steve," said Natasha in the same soft, gently tone as before.
"Fucking figures.  Bet they've been staking out your place for weeks, waiting for you and Stark to go back there," grumbled Fury, his hands tights on the steering wheel.  They were headed east, too fast, weaving through traffic, their bodies being thrown back and forth every time the car moved.
Tony moaned loudly when Steve tugged his hair, said his name.  How the fuck did Steve know he liked that?  It was like the two of them were psychic and knew exactly what the other one wanted and needed.  "That's right... take it in... good boy..." he panted, thrusting harder into him.  "You're all mine, Steve... this is all for you..."  He caught Steve's lips on his again, his tongue pushing into his mouth without any pretense.  Their tongues swirled together briefly before Tony pulled away, pressing their cheeks together.  "Oh my God... you're perfect... this is amazing," he moaned.  He was literally trying not to cry.  For Tony, sex was a biological function like eating; at times, it was a chore for him, something he did to kill time or maintain his reputation or whatever.  It had never been like this.  It had never been intimate or meaningful.  He was plowing Steve into the carpet; they were on the floor like animals, but that didn't matter, because they were meant for each other and they could have done it anywhere and it still would have felt magical.
know. I don't remember a lot. If that's not enough for them, then, well...I have nothing left to give them anyway."
"Hey, Donner."
Tony sighed heavily.  "As ready as I'll ever be," he said.  Being Captain America's back-up had to be about the most pointless position in the world.  Tony understood, inherently, that Steve was being asked to recover the thing, not Tony. Tony was there by pure coincidence.  Fury had called Steve, asked Steve, and had no real need for Tony, who, without a suit, was really nothing more than a guy with above-average intelligence.
"Jesus Christ.  Don't tell Steve or he'll go on one of his legendary Captain America guilt trips.  ...you wanna talk to him?"
Hey everyone. This update was one day late, because Tony ran the Los Angeles marathon on Sunday and he's feeling shit-tastic.  (Plus he's celebratorily drunk!)  (Is celebratorily a word?  ...it is now!) Thanks for your understanding!  - Sappho & Apollo
Gently, he reached up and dragged the sheets down. He ducked in a breath as his Alpha was exposed to him, the musky smell almost overwhelming. Steve leaned forward and gave the head a kiss, watching Tony's reactions carefully as he slipped his mouth over the head and sucked lightly. It tasted strange, Steve had to admit, but it was definitely worth it for Tony's facial expression.
The front door beeped and Rhodes walked in carrying a bottle of champagne and an orchid.
!  My favourite book as a kid was
They left with cheers from the crowd and general whooping noises made in their direction. When they piled into the car Steve felt his head spin a little and so he leaned it against the window, his eyes slipping shut. Sitting down felt really nice.
The car ride back had been chaos and Steve felt feverish. He downed too more bottles of water but there was no improvement. Maybe he was going to be sick. Maybe...but then Phil was tapping on his arm. Phil Coulson. The man Steve had woken up to. The man who had approved him ready for field work. The man who had assigned Nat and Clint to train him back up, get him ready for combat and espionage. He was an omega too, which was why he such a goddamn fanboy.
"So... let me just be clear, here... you want me to go to a sleezy motel pretending my name is Richard
, pay attention... there's a speech on the last page on the goldleaf paper, just in case anyone has questions about Iron Man, front page, here's the itinerary for tonight, the guest list is on the back, names in blue are ones Tony has to talk to and actually be nice to, obviously you won't know everyone, Steve, but try to start learning names because part of your job is giving those names to Tony, because he's hopeless when it comes to that, you take his phone and get any contact numbers he might need, and on page two, there's a list of--"
"Oh, c'mon, you know who I am," said Tony with a roll of his eyes.  "How many guys have a lamp stuck in their chest?"
"I don't think rose gold goes with Steve's complexion," he said, reaching up to unfasten the collar
Steve was grateful for Taylor shutting the other girl up, and almost smirked when Trey called him a player. Ha. Maybe in another life.
"Steve--"  Fuck. "
"Are you sure they said
Before Tony could leave the diner a hand on the upper arm of his suit stopped him.  One moment he was strolling out, and then he was being yanked back.  Panic rose in his gut; he pulled, harder.  But when Tony pulled against Steve's grip his hold remained sure. He knew this was going to be hard. He knew Tony didn't trust him. But he wasn't going to let the stubborn asshole die for the sake of his pride. That wasn't happening on Steve's watch. He pulled on the arm of the suit and forced Tony to twist back around to face him. No normal human being was that strong.  The suit, even without power, weighed two hundred pounds, and Tony was being pulled back like he was a child.
Steve yelped when Tony dove between his legs, turning bright pink very quickly. God. He didn't like to admit it out loud but he had loved it the first time...and he was actually very down for Tony doing it again. His throat went dry and he was definitely disappointed when Tony pulled back.
"But he's... he's completely
"This is the twenty-first century Buck. There's cameras everywhere," Steve breathed, taking another sharp turn with ease. "You have a mobile, right? Please drop it out the window. They'll be able to track it."
"Hi, David.  It's Tony," he whispered, all too aware of Steve's super hearing.  He spoke as quietly as he could, the water running to muffle the sound.
her.  She can drink.  And she is
But it quickly evaporated.  "You know if you're having any treasonous ideas I've got to report them to Fury, right?"
"Okay!  So! ...you!"  Richard pointed to a couple in the front row.  "You look like you're pregnant already, congratulations.  ...so what the hell are you doing here? ...no, but seriously, when are you due?  ...oh, May, well, congratulations. Hoping for a boy or a girl?"
He leaned his head against his knees and thought about metal pressing down on his neck. He remembered the wet surface of the cave in the simulation, not being able to breathe-
He knew what she was really getting at.  Whether or not they'd have kids.
"That was a very exaggerated version of that kind of reaction though," Steve warned him. "Everyone agrees that wasn't normal.  And honestly, heats aren't all that sexy. They're desperate and messy and painful. But they can be intimate...and I guess that's ultimately the point of them.  I mean, I wouldn't know.  I've had two and I never spent one with an Alpha."
"You and Donner ought to find time to hang out," said Tony, his teeth still clenched.
but he wouldn't cry. He goddamn wouldn't. "My whole life, it was like I was broken...because I couldn't have- I just felt so useless. And then I was- and they just took that away from me. Like they took
Hal snorted. "Yeah. Doesn't surprise me."
"It was so good to meet you--"  Laura attempted to hug Steve, but Cooper was in between them.
"You're live, sir," JARVIS informed him.
The dessert was probably the fanciest thing Steve had ever eaten. It was a chocolate dome which they melted with hot caramel sauce from a jug only to reveal different cubes of cake and ice cream all in different yellows and pinks. Steve was glad he could eat without the stress of worrying about calories (he more ate with the stress of not having
Tony was lost in Steve's mouth, the familiar shape and taste of it.  Steve's head was bowed and Tony had to stand on his tip-toes a little to make it work, but they
He felt so stupid for asking permission.  Standing there in torn shop jeans and a rumpled wifebeater, no shoes, hair and goatee a mess... Tony felt

he thought).
"Do we get to drink out of those
," croaked out Tony, putting a shaking hand over his face.
Tony purred softly, bobbing his head up and down Steve's shaft, and reaching between Steve's legs to play with his balls, to stroke his entrance.  Steve had one hand on the side of one of Tony's work benches, white-knuckled. Steve was shaking, no doubt weak-kneed; it gave Tony a small sense of power, to reduce Steve to a quivering, puddly little mess with just his mouth.
"For the last time, we don't know yet, Cooper," said Natasha as Laura set plates down in front of them.
Tony shuddered again.  Twice already,
"He's allowed to have a life outside of you, you know," said Pepper, practically shoving Tony into the back of the vehicle.
A complete and utter bare-faced lie but Steve sold it well.
"Is anyone hurt?" Gleason asked.
Tony looked over, curious.
Tony checked his watch impatiently.
"No.  Those are actual smells.  Associations. What does Steve's smell make you think of?  Word association, Tony. Imagine Steve's smell. Just say the first thing that pops into your mind."
That smell.
Steve was shaking. It had been so close. The front of his head stung where it had smacked into the floor as Bucky had thrown him down. He had thought it was over but then- then Bucky had froze on top of him and it almost felt like there were on that rooftop again, snow whistling through the air around them. He let out a trembling breath of relief and rested his forehead back against the floor.
If the raw emotional intensity of the last chapter was hard to handle, never fear.  This chapter is pretty much nothing but smut... and after this, we're off to the Alphas United conference for wacky fun hijinks!  So stay tuned!   - Tony
He opened his mouth but didn't remember his name.  "It's--"  God damn it.  "--me," he finished.  He felt helplessly confused about who "me" was.  He felt like he was three, maybe four different people.  "Hold on.  I've got a light."  He yanked down his shirt.  The arc reactor burned its steady, soft, white-blue light, temporarily blinding him.
"Ah. Of course," Richard nodded. "Now Mr Stark, if you'll just--" He sighed when Tony curled over Steve impossibly further. "You're going to have to let me take a look at him."
Natasha's lips twisted a little and she turned back to the viewing window.
," said Natasha.  "What was that, was that one of your experiments?  How did he do that?"
"I'll put on some coffee... we can talk on the back porch," said Natasha, turning to go downstairs.  She was well-aware that Steve probably had a million questions; it was a testament to his patience that he had allowed Cooper to commandeer the conversation to explain dinosaurs and Pokemon to him.
Winchell's? Steve knew where that was, sort of.  Google could do the rest. There was no way he could track down a
The sandwich was cheese and ham. Steve picked it up then pulled a face it before biting off a corner. It felt strange to eat after so long without. He kept the bites small, not wanting to make himself sick.
"...that's... actually really cool."
"Who would I go with?" asked Donner plaintively, who clearly liked the idea of going to a Banksy birthday bash.
Outside it was already dusk.  The sun sat low on the western horizon, lighting up the ocean.  Tony pulled out a pair of sunglasses with his unoccupied hand and slipped them on.
"Damn it, call Pierce and get his approval, then!"
but Steve was still their captain and he gave the orders in the end. He could cling onto that.
"What, you planning on getting attacked sometime soon?" asked Rhodey.
"When...when did we get here?" Steve rubbed a hand over his face and yawned, blinking blearily. "I don't remember--"
"We know you're working on Insight!  We also know you're working for HYDRA, so cut the crap and tell us what you're doing for them!" shouted Natasha, cinching up the garrote again.  Project Insight was a brand-new operation that SHIELD had that involved international security, but it was still in its infancy and many people doubted anything would come of it.  Jasper was on the founding committee but they already knew that; they knew what he did for SHIELD and his response seemed like a smug little joke, a refusal to explain his role in HYDRA.
He was alone.
His thumb ran over Steve's knuckles slowly, hypnotically.  Tony's gaze was distant; Steve could see his mind was working furiously beneath the surface.
sprint, world record's be damned.) Steve leaned his hands on the back of the desk behind him, eyes flitting over the bottle. The run had given him too much of a buzz for him to be sad about that right now but he certainly wasn't
"Okay, well, firstly,
"The last thing in the world that guy needs is an espresso," muttered Clint to Natasha; they had been watching Tony through the hole in the ceiling for the last couple of hours.  Tony had most of the materials laying around; he'd been putting them together with an energy that belied his sickness.  His shop was unrecognizable.
"He must be mistaken.  We got orders from Mr. Malick this morning," replied Rumlow.
Tony happily met Steve's lips when everyone began cheering, licking into his mouth and running his hand down his ass.  For a moment he was lost in Steve's mouth, in the firmness of his body and the taste of his kiss. Then Steve pulled away with an affectionate tug on his lower lip.
"The rate at which you heal is quite something," David mumbled, half to himself.
"No, she was the '62 'Vette me and my dad used to work on.  I was nine when he passed and my mother was beside herself. She betrothed me to a guy named Frank, but you couldn't go through with the bonding ceremony until you were seventeen.  Day before my birthday, I took Lola and never looked back. Still have her."
"You really wanna go?" he said, slowly, as if finally understanding her.
"I can whistle," Cooper said to Steve, a bit proudly.
"C'mon.  If you want to be mated in your nest you gotta show it to me," demanded Tony.  "Don't want to ruin your pic--"
“Of course not,” said Tony, who was yanking his tie loose and walking into the bedroom to flop down on the bed.  “Just rub my shoulders, will you?  You can leave once I’m asleep.”  He closed his eyes.  He didn’t want to admit it, but he needed some comfort.  He felt tired and uncomfortable, and the full breakfast in the room made his stomach turn.  He wanted to pull his shirt off because he was too hot, but he didn’t dare.  The last thing he needed was Steve seeing the veins on his chest.  Besides, who knew if he’d go and tell Pepper?  After all, Steve technically worked for both of them, and he sort of seemed like a squealer.  Tony didn’t want Pepper to know.  She had enough on her plate already.
"It felt really good," Steve assured him in a quiet whisper. Then he whined low in his throat as Tony thrust into him, his hands bunching up in the fabric of the sofa. His dick twitched against his thigh with interest. "Tony..." he sighed, almost like a warning.
Karpov offered him a cigarette as he climbed into the back of the truck.  He took it gratefully.
Tony grinned and reached up to cup Steve's face, stroking it with his thumb.  Slowly, he reached behind Steve's ear. "...may I?" he ventured. He wasn't usually so
"What did you do to him?" Donner frowned.
"Well, no rush."
Tony paused.  "In retrospect,
?  ...don't you have herpes?"
In retrospect, Tony guessed that a huge reason Steve had made him so uncomfortable and that Tony had, early on, provoked him so much, was because even before Steve's heat Tony felt a pull toward him, an attraction, and he was all too aware that Steve was male.  An omega male, yes, but a male nonetheless. Tony had slapped his ass for two reasons: to deliberately irritate him, and, perhaps a little subconsciously, because he desperately wanted to feel that firm fucking ass. Wanted to grab the globes of Steve's buttocks and squeeze him, tenderly.  And those thoughts scared Tony, so he'd doubled down on his efforts to annoy and provoke and be unpleasant, as if this would make up for his attraction to the uppity blond.
"Okay, next diagram!  ...this is a cloaca! A vagina's a vagina; can't tell the difference between a beta and an omega.  Male omegas, though, are a whole 'nother plate of tamales. You might call them the third sex. So here, you can see, there's a branch and a little flap... not dissimilar to the esophagus and the trachea, really.  This branch goes up to the gastro-intestinal tract, whereas this one, you see, goes right up to the uterus. And that little flap is your buddy because that's what's keeping the two separate. As far as menstruation, of course, it's just excreted with all the rest of the junk, so if any of you have noticed your omegas shitting blood, don't worry, they're probably fine."
"Ours wasn't really on purpose," said Tony.  He wasn't sure how to respond because he knew how they'd been arranged... how Banksy had been forced.
"Although, we should definitely get a beta. An omega would probably try to join in." Smelling other omegas in preheat certainly made Steve excited. But he didn't understand the want for a threesome with one. Regardless of his whole jealousy issues (which he was talking about in therapy) the thought of having sex with someone else who was... submissive did not appeal to Steve. It was why he was attracted to Alphas; they were 'in charge.' Steve was aware not
“Well, I could give it a go, but I’d have to get the costume altered to fit me.”
Bucky watched as his boyfriend, often hesitant about public displays of affection, leaned in to give Tony’s cheek a quick peck, then pull back and lick his lips. He smiled. “Buck’s right, real tasty.” He tilted his cone toward Tony. “Wanna try some of mine?”
Tony frowned. “Coffee,” he said again, more clearly this time.
“Tony, did you make armor for a cat?”
“Oh, this timeline is already on a different path than it was. Things have... changed.” She looks like she’s not entirely sure what those changes are, but she’s sure they’ve happened. (Loki has the Tesseract, Steve remembers. And... Hydra thinks Captain America is on their side. That’s... going to make this timeline interesting.) “As long as you leave me the Time Stone,” the Ancient One tips her chin down at the briefcase on the floor beside him, “We will manage.”
Tony still didn’t even know if it was a soulmark, or what it would mean for a soulmark to disappear and reappear like that. Was his soulmate’s matching mark flickering too? Were they only sometimes his soulmate? Could the mark be something else entirely?
Not a friend.
“Oh my god,” probably-Bucky said as he came out of the kitchenette, “You’re actually flirting with Tony Stark, I’m gonna get out of here and let you two talk about heating up and all that...”
Dad explained, “Your AI will help you with things like, I don’t know, warning you when you’re almost out of web fluid?”
“Let’s go ahead and add a third chair for dinner,” Tony managed, then winked, “But maybe we could change things up for dessert...”
Once his breathing is under control, he asks again, quietly. “How many?”
“They’re just friends.”
“I’ll make it up to you,” Tony promises. “Now, uh, remember what I said about staying calm?”
Tony shrugs in a non-answer answer. “Okay enough.” He looks self-conscious, and Steve can’t have that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Three in a row,” Steve repeated, turning to head back to the pitcher’s mound.
The suit really did look incredible, obviously Dad’s handiwork, and it was perfectly made to fit him. He took the mask and, after glancing questioningly at Pops and receiving a nod, put it over his head.
The thought that Bucky might not have remembered him hurts like a punch to the gut, and the knowledge that Tony’d had to experience that pain hurts like a fist around his heart. Steve reaches a hand out to Tony, who despite still wearing the space suit manages to kneel down beside him, and pulls him as close as he can into a side embrace.
If they came at all.
Note for this chapter: I’m not saying “spending time with loved ones is sufficient reason to expose yourself to situations you know are traumatic for you.” In this case, Steve decides his risk and degree of possible traumatic reactions are low enough to be worth the extra time with his family. If this is ever not the case for you, do what you need to do to take care of yourself.
The fact that the man he loved would be the one pulling the trigger probably wouldn’t matter to whoever was making the rulings.
Steve looked around the cave. It was a more furnished than he’d expected a dragon’s lair to be, a large cushion near a metal table, another few cushions of varying sizes in the corners, a wall hanging depicting a blue and gold dragon soaring through the sky, various metal odds and ends sitting around. No pile of gold and gems, as dragons were supposed to hoard, but Steve supposed one might be in a nearby cavern. There was a clanging sound coming from somewhere, but the cavern was too large and echoing to determine which direction the sound was coming from.
He was even more surprised to see how much his academic-focused son’s skills had improved since they’d last played. He was catching more adeptly, throwing harder and more accurately, and even managed a very impressive jump for the ball when Steve had lobbed it a little high (maybe on purpose, to see just how Peter would handle it).
...” Peter insisted, and Tony and Steve shared a grin before Tony followed along behind their son.
“I am pleased that you are happy with them, my friend, but storelskas are from Nidavellir, not Asgard,” Thor corrects.
“You’re cute, you seem to be genuinely a good person, you’re stubborn as hell, it looked like you might be attracted to me, and you don’t care about my money. I don’t meet a lot of people who fit even a few of those criteria.” When the man’s shocked expression didn’t change, Tony added, “Or, I mean, you don’t have to accept the money or the date, I can just get out of your hair...” He started to turn toward the door.
“Home sounds good,” Bucky says, his tone more heartfelt. “Ready to go home, Stevie?” he asks the blond in his lap, and gets barely a mumble in response.
“Do you know what passive suicidal ideation is?”
“I’m just surprised Hammer didn’t piss himself!”
Steve looks back at Tony, who doesn’t give him a chance to chastise him. “What’s a movie we’ve watched that you hope you never have to see again?”
“Come on, Rhodey, I thought you were finally going to let that die!”
“Plums, your favorite!” Tony held out the basket, tempted to shake it but not wanting to jostle its contents.
“You’re damned right you should have. And then... you almost killed him.”
That was why Tony had been so disturbingly blank around him. All his emotions toward Steve had been removed. In a surgery that could have killed him, but which saved his life.
They’d almost finished subduing all the huge alien bat things when one smacked Iron Man, hard, and sent him spinning into a brick wall.
“Now with the serum, there’s still nothing the people I care about can do, but at least I heal faster. So what’s the point in letting you guys worry about it in the short time until it’s better?”
“Apparently it wasn’t,” Tony replies flippantly.
Most surprising to Tony was a small holographic orb of a familiar pattern of lights. It was JARVIS’ neural pattern; FRIDAY had her own unique signature, so this ornament must have been crafted specifically for Tony’s former AI. Vision was sitting on the couch nearby chatting with Wanda, but when he noticed Tony’s eyes on him, Vision gave a quiet tilt of his head. Tony swallowed hard, touched by the creation.
“You didn’t...” Steve began, then briefly met Bucky’s eyes in apology before looking back at Tony, “You didn’t mean for this to be the three of us?”
“You’re concussed,” the Buckys said with one voice. A lovely voice that sounded somehow both amused and worried.
On Christmas Eve, Tony looked at the now almost completely covered tree. It was crowded, messy, and the most beautiful tree he’d ever seen. But...
Barnes stared at him, his blue-grey eyes dark, haunted.
He slowed to a stop and turned to see Tony running toward him.
hadn't seen the nude ones... right?
“He just wants to stay warm inside, and that’s okay,” Tony said firmly, and Steve went over and pulled him by the scarf to give him a quick kiss.
Then Yinsen is gone.
“I will. I mean, it was good this time, until... it was just a little too much.”
“So, like you on an inventing binge?” Bucky said wryly.
“Nope,” Tony replied with perhaps a little too much glee.
But apparently the spell decides it’s close enough. “I’d be relieved,” Steve says, looking away.
When JARVIS let Tony know he had a location on Bucky, Tony went alone. He knew Steve would be pissed when he found out, but he just had to see the man. Talk to him. Alone.
“No, that one’s Steve,” Steve says, pointing to the one still in the cage, now looking up between the two of them. “And Little Steve loves Little Tony.”
Steve understands Tony’s warning, since he knows it’s going to be hard keeping his emotions under control having Tony back, and he can’t imagine what being a prisoner of the Chitauri must have done to the stranger.
By morning, Bucky has forgotten about his injury. He’s up before anyone else but Steve, who’s out on a run. Alone in the kitchen, he pours himself a bowl of oatmeal squares and milk, takes a spoonful, and--
“You need sleep,” Steve insisted. “Go home, go to bed.”
“Hi, Buckys,” he managed. He squinted, trying to see them more clearly. Bucky was pretty, so seeing three of him would be even better. “You’re pretty.”
The next time Steve threw--pitched, whatever--the ball, Tony actually swung, and hit!
The cats were mischievous, destructive, sweet, and loving, just like the boy who had saved their lives.
“Yes, this is certainly a very nice assembly,” Steve agrees. He takes a bite, and then another. “Pretty amazing assembly, actually.”
Steve nods, ashamed.
Steve tries to hide, but Tony spots him and their eyes connect. It sends a jolt of lightning through his body, and somehow, mechanically, he approaches the drawing.
“Are you?”
“Want to take my time with you,” Steve says back. “I love you like this.”
“What’s your favorite charity to donate to?” Steve says stubbornly.
“About last time you went to the store?” Tony surmises.
Tony nods. “Me too,” he says. “I slept a couple hours, but then genius struck me so I came down here.”
“Sorry to hear about the delay,” he says, and then he shoves his hand into his pocket and pulls out of his business cards from his wallet. “I do sculptures, and I work quick, if you find yourself needing another one in the future.”
“You know me. I can eat anything.”
“Good. Because I want to overwhelm you.”
“I don’t want you to go home by yourself anymore,” Tony says firmly. “I’ll come with you to pick up some clothes or whatever you need, but I want you to stay with me.”
“The show benefits the children’s cancer ward at the hospital. A group of them were invited to come by and see the paintings before the gallery opens. They should be here in an hour, so you should go get this put up before they arrive.”
“Then why did you leave?”
It’s that thought that gets Steve driving, and eventually he manages to put Paul on the backburner so he can think about Tony.
“Yes,” Steve nods. “I was just thinking about something.”
“Should I let you go so you can focus on your work?”
“Hmm?”
Tony nods. “What time can you come tomorrow?”
Some of the floors were stocked like offices, but no one ever came to work in them. Steve wondered if Stark Tower had once been used for something else, or if maybe Tony was building a call center for some future investment idea. He didn’t ask, though, because Tony didn’t seem to like to talk about his wealth. He would just wave his hand around as if it didn’t matter, like money was nothing more than a thing that was just there, a convenience.
“Um, yes?”
“I wasn’t going to,” Tony says back. “Somebody else needs to be able to hang an original Steve Rogers in their house, too.”
“Have you ever talked to anyone else about Mr. Swanson’s threats?”
“Mr. Stark is expecting you. Pull to the front and someone will park your car. Go inside, 51st flood.”
button, tapping his foot angrily as it ascends. He tries to compose himself. Maybe he’s wrong. Maybe what he thinks isn’t what really happened. But there is no other explanation. No other excuse.
“Because of the amount, or because you think I bought it because I thought you were hot?”
Steve’s friend wasn’t at the bar yet, though, so Steve sat at the counter, shoulders hunched, drinking a cranberry juice. He was approached by several men offering to buy him drinks, but he turned each of them away politely. He wasn’t intending to pick up another client, he just needed to figure out a good way to drop Paul, and maybe earn himself a third day off. He could make his finances work with one less client, and it might be good for his mental health anyway.
Tony rocks back and forth a little, testing the waters, before he pulls out and slides back in. They both gasp at the feeling, and when he does it again, Steve throws his head back in extasy.
Steve drops his eyes. “That’s not how this works.”
When he finally falls asleep, it’s with a smile on his face.
He shrugs again. “My dad was in the army and died when I was really young. My mom…,” he trails off, sighing. “She had to do certain things to get money so we could live in our tiny apartment in the city. Guess I learned it from somewhere.” He says it almost angrily, but he bites his lip. He’d loved his mother until the day she died. He wishes he had better memories of her, better stories to tell. But the only thing he can remember is his mother telling him to hide in the closet when a client would come by.
. It’s such a feminine word that he is immediately confused by it. He can’t decide if Tony is chiding him, or if he’s being serious. It takes several seconds of searching Tony’s face before Steve decides that he was serious, and that his word choice was intentional.
Sunday was Kevin. Kevin was twenty-four years old and came from a family with money. He had trouble meeting real people and preferred Steve’s consistent company. Kevin was quite flamboyant, which Steve didn’t mind, but their time together was usually quite short because Kevin had an issue with cuming too soon. And again, Steve didn’t mind because it meant his day could go on sooner.
Steve looks away, trying to push away the feeling of dread that has spread over him. He wishes Tony could just understand how bad things had been with Paul. He wishes he could understand why he himself let things go on for so long. He didn’t like pain. Was it really for money that he let Paul hurt him so badly?
Tony can tell that Steve is in shock, and he probably does need medical attention. But he’s also pretty sure that when things have been quiet for a few minutes, Steve might just snap out of it. So they sit there together for quiet some time, maybe longer than Tony thought it would take, but eventually Steve reaches up with his hand and wipes his face as if expecting to clear away tears.
He doesn’t wander far from home, just for a short walk to the convenience store on the corner. He picks up a six pack of Coke and a couple candy bars. He figures he’s got enough money to blow on some candy, and he deserves it anyway. Chocolate heals all wounds. Steve is pretty sure he heard that somewhere.
Tony laughs at that. “I’m not worried about cost,” he says, waving his hand. “I just want it finished so it can be the center piece at my party.”
“A check from the gallery,” Steve says, his voice rising again. “A check for more money than my whole life is worth. What is this, Tony?”
Tony takes Steve’s tip into his mouth, licking his way down the length before unexpectedly swallowing him down.
“Comfortable?” Paul says, his voice coming out as a sneer. “What should I do to you today, Cap?”
Steve grimaces, “Yes.”
Twenty minutes later Tony reappears wearing fresh clothes, hair brushed, and his beard trimmed.
“Sure. I cleared my schedule for today so I’m all yours,” Tony says, and it doesn’t help the growing sensation in Steve’s low belly.
He shook his head to put the thought away. It was bad to dwell on things like that, especially because he knew he’d probably never see Tony Stark in person again. Might glance at him on the TV, but Tony would never call and he would never think about Steve Rogers again. And Steve smiles a bit, because at least he got to meet the guy once.
It takes him another few minutes, but eventually he dials the police and they say they’re going to send somebody out. Steve knows his neighborhood isn’t exactly at the top of their priority list, so he wanders around his house for a bit. He eventually decides to scrub the red SLUT off his mirror because he doesn’t want to have to explain it to the police.
“No,” Steve shrugs. “He might have moved on from it already.”
“I can try,” Steve agrees.
The guards must have noticed something was amiss, because seconds later they have stepped up behind Tony and Steve and are looking at Paul, trying to decipher the situation.
“I just can’t, Tony,” Steve finally says. “This is my life, and you have your own life.”
“But you can draw,” Tony says slowly. “And I like your style.” He pauses for a moment, looking Steve over. “Fine. I’ll pay you only once the project is done on time. Deal?”
“Tony,” Steve tries. He’s not trying to get away, but the confusion and uncertainty shows on his face. He doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know what Tony is
“I’ll be in my lab,” Tony says, holding the door open. “If you need me, it’s the basement level.”
“Heart surgery,” Tony breathes.
“Don’t leave me,” Steve says. He means more of a short term thing, such as, don’t leave me if I fall asleep, but Tony nods anyway.
“I’m almost done anyway,” he says. “This is the hardest part. Just free-drawing your face. It would have been easier if I had felt the lines before starting.”
“You miss me already?” Tony says cockily.
When it’s all said and done, Steve swipes his card for the suit and then heads for the car. He takes a minute to get a burger from a drive through before making his way to the studio, glad to see that the workers are still setting up. He leaves the suit in the car and grabs his package from the trunk.
“You sure?” Tony asks after a few minutes. “You don’t look okay.”
“Yeah,” he says back. “Just…a stomach ache today.” He staggers back to his feet and then raises his eyes to meet Tony’s. He can see the concern etched across Tony’s face, but he can’t do anything but shrug and dip the brush back into the varnish. He wants to finish. He wants this to be over. He wants to go home.
Tony lets go of Steve and turns so that he can lean against the counter. Steve starts to cook the sandwiches while Tony watches him.
He feels like he’s running away from his house, where the sanctity of his privacy has been invaded. But he also feels like he’s running towards Tony, because he misses him, and he wants to see him, and Tony is
“I’m alright.”
He heads out to his car, holding his stomach carefully as if it’s going to explode somehow. It certainly feels like it. He wonders if something might be broken.
“Don’t lie! You liked it! You begged me for more!”
“It’s dusty,” Steve shrugs back. “Happens when you don’t come home for almost a month.”
Steve chuckles, and then he leans back against his couch. “You maybe…want some company tonight?” he asks.
Somehow, over the last two weeks, Steve had managed to spend every night at Stark Tower. He’d go home in the day time, grab some art supplies, and then end up back at Tony’s place. Tony would work in his lab and Steve had set up an easel in the corner, out of the way, so they could watch each other work.
“So, if you’re okay with it, I’d like to take a few sketches of you before I get started,” Steve says. “A close-up of your face, and then one or two of your body at different angles so I can get an idea of what I’m working with.” He talks absentmindedly, not meaning to let his mind wander where it shouldn’t go.
