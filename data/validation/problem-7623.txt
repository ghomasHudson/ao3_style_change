The arduous process seemed like it took forever, and Ste-Virn was paranoid about reinforcements coming, but either the process was shorter than it seemed or help was further away than he believed, because finally he’d managed to get all the prisoners onto the boat—onto the deck of the boat, not the hold, where filthy chains and the stench seeped into the metal and cloth told him just how often and how long this boat had been in use for this purpose—and then took all the guards he could find (one or two were missing—they must have woken up and decided to cut their losses) and stuffed them in the hold before locking the grate and moving to the controls.
like an animal, even if it made him feel safe, and then something small and tiny was tentatively scooting closer and closer to Steve’s side. Steve’s eyes popped open to see Tony—terrified, nervous, and so tense it looked like he might snap Tony—was nervously crawling closer on the bed, under the covers.
There was a soft woof, and Steve turned to see a golden retriever sitting patiently under a tree. It took a moment to realize that canine scent that was steady under Clint’s normal scent was more pronounced.
The bed dipped, dropped, and something warm and heavy settled on top of Steve—and then something more, and something more. Steve needed to argue this, couldn’t let Tony just
Behind the den and across from the living room and kitchen was an enclosed room—opening the door revealed that it was a security room, with access to what was probably sublevel basements.
“I thought you were honestly flirting with me,” Tony whispered, starting to pull away—and Steve grabbed his hands.
“C’n y’ hear th’ waves? Say goodbye,” Anotoni whispered, and then he giggled. “Bye-bye.”
It hadn’t been that long since the battle of the New York, and Tony Stark was, by all accounts and reports, extremely observant and aware. However.
“Yeah, well,” Tony murmured, following behind Steve as they made their way to the elevator that had sunk them down into the basement. It pulled them back into the security room on the first floor, and Tony exited first—and nearly walked face-first into Sharon Carter.
how the meeting would go.
amazing!” Clint said happily. “Steve can’t stop eating them!”
Natasha fought not to chew on her lip. It was a nervous sign, and she didn’t want to show how this mattered to her.
—fingers twitched against Steve’s arm, almost jerking away, and Steve turned his head to look at Tony—but the younger man’s face was smooth, and his fingers were once more resting lightly on Steve’s arm.
“Tony. You, a civilian, with no military training and
Ste-Virn concentrated, trying to pick up the feeling that Saark had picked up on, but when he couldn’t identify anything he sighed. “Do you have a better idea?” he asked quietly. “All of what we said and planned—have you changed your mind about that?”
Tony tsked, stretching his arms up and locking them around Steve’s neck, even as he tilted his head to the side. It bared the space behind his ear, the musk there, and Rumlow and Steve’s eyes dilated as both of them suddenly focused on the omega entirely. “Just two cavemen, fighting over everything. Brock, you like NASCAR, yeah?”
, losing everyone and everything he ever knew, ending up fighting mother
“Orcantuur, Slysstar!”
Master W’Lsinn hummed a little to himself. “Very well. I know you’re hiding something, but you are also old enough to know the consequences of your actions and accept them. You are also old enough to know when to call in for help and when not to. A lecture won’t do me any good now.”
The district where Anotoni’s signal broadcasted from was definitely on the poorer side. Many abandoned factories and junkyards dotted the landscape, and trash piled up in a composting yard on the edge of the quadrant. Ste-Virn kept to the shadows, blending in as best as he could when so obviously looking for something. If there was an auction house, it would probably be in an abandoned warehouse—that would have enough space, and be defensible enough to guard against authorities showing up. If there was simply a holding area until the trafficked beings were moved to the mines—far more likely, considering that owning a slave or even an indentured servant on this planet meant five years of imprisonment yourself and a loss of title and land—they could be anywhere.
Clint blinked at him, then twisted the dial on his hearing aid. “I’m sorry?”
For a moment, Director Fury looked as if he would snort in laughter, but after a few heartbeats he inclined his head. “Granted.”
to me—”
Unfortunately.
“Shit, fine, my bad,” Stark grumbled, turning away. “Where’s Clint? He’s always here.”
He trailed off, then shook his head.
Byu-Kyonn had a point. The last update Ste-Virn had sent to the Council had been almost a week ago, and he was overdue for his regular check-in. He had pulled heavily on the discretionary budget they had been given in order to get this ship, and while he may not be a whiz at mechanics like Anotoni or Byu-Kyonn, he was a fair hand with them. Certainly didn’t crash as near many as Byu-Kyonn claimed.
gentle at all.
“I am sorry,” Steve murmured. “My fears and my insecurities shouldn’t have made me jump the gun like this. The best excuse I can think of is that I genuinely, at the time, thought it would be a nice present to reunite you with your guardian. If I had taken more than half a second to think it over… I would have known how ridiculous that assumption was.”
One thing that hadn’t changed about omegas in the military from when Steve had first entered—they were still offered lucrative contracts to stabilize large alpha-heavy teams, and more or less they willingly entered into contract with the military, signing up for tours with the expectation that the military would place them in good teams and that they would be protected. Higher pay went to those who went into active military zones, and the military paid a fortune in education bills, reparations, and contract salaries for omegas. There were always far more betas and omegas than alphas, so finding omegas wasn’t the hard part—it was pairing the omegas with a team that wouldn’t have the omegas calling breach of contract and costing the military more money in reparations for unsafe conditions and criminal treatment, and breaking up alphas and betas into teams that didn’t have four or more alphas in one place and would therefore
that in his bones, but it didn’t change that instinctive response in his hindbrain. “Do you
have a lead—”
Ste-Virn smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, I’m not allowed out by myself anymore.”
Maybe scared. Dernier had alluded, previously, that the men he had first been with had been harsh, using and abusing instead of treasuring and caring. Steve certainly knew of quite a few men he’d been on missions with previously that he would not want anywhere near an omega for longer than a few minutes, for sure. That might be it.
He had taken a few classes, he wasn’t too ashamed to admit. Practiced, and it wasn’t hard, it really wasn’t. Chemistry wasn’t his forte, but it was a science, and it was understandable. He might not be artistic with it, but he could make good-tasting food.
“I don’t want to revisit past hurts,” Ste-Virn said stiffly, feeling his shoulders grow tight as he pinched the bridge of his nose.
Shifting into his lion form wouldn’t help—he’d just get more attention than he was already getting. Instead, he made his way to where the scent was the strongest, even if it wasn’t exactly ‘strong’ enough to indicate Tony was right there. Once he was close enough to the scent, he sat down under the tree. “Natasha, grab Clint and get back to the car. We’ll be heading back soon.”
“Did Clint shift with him?” Steve asked, looking around. He knew Tony was a cat, but he didn’t see a cat around—even when looking up at the tree, at the branches, he couldn’t see a cat anywhere. It wasn’t exactly proper to shift in public, but it also wasn’t as if anyone would get arrested, especially if they didn’t bother other people and didn’t make a show of walking up to others. And this
“Yer a damnfool agri-herder, that’s what you are,” Byu-Kyonn muttered. “See he’s Anotoni now, not Saark. Good ta hear yer gettin’ along an’ found a real connection, now that he might be dead’r somethin’.”
“Hey, Clint,” he yawned, really feeling the exhaustion hit as he leaned on the counter.
He learned that, when Thor finally joined—and he didn’t stay consistently, being that he was a
Steve grunted, leaned on the counter, and stared at the door. “To—Stark wasn’t here, this morning. He’s always here.”
“If you think he could do better, why don’t you?” Steve said—and he sounded angry, even? A little?

I mean… I got to be honest, I know I can’t tell you what to do with your body and I want you to be comfortable, but I’m also possessive as shit and you know that. I would be very unhappy if paparazzi decided to take pictures and plaster that all around everywhere. That’s just shitty.”

?” Ste-Virn yelped, jerking upright and banging his head on the low overhang above his bunk. Hissing, he rubbed his head and glowered at his commlink. “What are you talking about?”
Saark was curiously blank-looking, and once he was done speaking, he bowed and left. It left Ste-Virn feeling… unsettled.
“I think I can figure out how to pilot a boat, yes,” Ste-Virn grunted.
Steve took off running.
Steve hugged Tony just a bit tighter, and breathed in deep.
“Okay, wait, wait—you became Iron Man. You, what, hid it somehow? How? How did you get access to that technology? I know you have a company, but you don’t take money from the company. I know you can’t access the company, and if Stane was trying to get you back—”
“So sorry I’m late,” Saark said breezily, voice lightly accented with his trilling native dialect. “I got sidetracked, and I did not mean to. There is no excuse for not being on time.”
Clint had a medical unit to go to if he was banged up—and, really, he’d gotten off lightly because his job had been to make sure no one exited the warehouse with any alien technology, which required him to be up high in perches as he watched the chaos of the fight down below. Natasha had sprained her wrist and bruised ribs, but other than that had been fine; Steve had tried to take a blast from an alien weapon and been knocked
But at the foot of the bed, by a trunk that was almost the size of a grown man, kneeled the omega.
“Is there something you’d like to add?” Steve asked wearily.
Anotoni—and the being that had helped him walk to the boat—were propped against the side of the boat, sitting on the deck, and Anotoni giggled again. “C’n you even
Steve and Natasha jumped, Steve throwing himself back against the window and Natasha setting off the horn of the car. “Clint!” Steve chastised, before the words processed. “Wait, what?”
Tony laughed again, and it was bitter and
Well, if Tony’s old unit had caused those scars, that would make sense. Tony wouldn’t want to sleep anywhere near Steve.
And, here’s the thing, Steve Rogers was getting better at interacting with Tony Stark, and Captain America was getting better at interacting with Iron Man, and Iron Man knew what war Captain America would talk about and why it was so hard for him to talk about it, but Tony Stark would not know that for Steve Rogers. And on the one hand, he had really enjoyed getting to know Tony Stark without having Captain America sitting on his shoulder, but on the other hand…
It was a comfort, and he let his posture relax. “I wouldn’t treat her like that. Do you know her name, then?”
After this, she would tell Tony. After.
Master Kulsi squinted at the machinery for a long moment before looking up at Anotoni. “You risked your life for the slimmest chance of return. You could have turned in a report, talked this out with your partner, but you always rush things, always jump right in. You have to realize that we Jedi are cooperative, not combative.”
Not to be deterred, even though he hadn’t known that of Barton (didn’t know Barton at all, beyond his reputation), Steve continued, “—but creating this large of a team to deal with threats like this past… alien menace is premature, especially with how we’re all alphas. Not to mention that these kinds of threats
“That’s fair,” Natasha muttered. “Well, it’s worth a shot.”
Steve narrowed his eyes at the small phone in his hand, and carefully clicked it off and putting it into his pocket instead of slamming it down in the manner he really wanted.
“Yeah, I get it,” Steve jumped in. “I’m not going to butt in on Sitwell’s team, or Coulson’s team, or whoever else has a long-standing omega attached to them. But here, in this team? In
. His speech was clearly high-class, his behaviors and mannerisms eccentric and strange. He volunteered as a mechanic in the oddest positions, and made himself
His gaze could have gone to any number of things; the attached bathroom to the side, the television, the large bed in the center of the room against the far wall, the closet…
“Just because you’re scared he’ll realize you were Natalie in his company and spying on him doesn’t mean you get to avoid him. He thinks we don’t like him!”
A wry smile curled the corner of Kulsi’s mouth. “He did request, yes. A month, two months ago, thereabout. We were not going to honor his request until we realized your cases were one-and-the-same. He thought we had denied his request—”
“Though at least, I suppose, the military is more respectable than simply sliding through the various bedrooms of his professors. I told his father, Gregory—I told him to keep an eye on little Tony, that he would be a handful. Bless the man’s heart, he wanted to let Tony do whatever he wanted, especially after his mother died. Couldn’t say no, and give Tony an inch and he’ll take a mile. I’m sure you’re no stranger to that, right?”
Steve folded his arms, stared at him, but Tony was really good at ignoring disapproving and disappointing looks. He was going to just finish this, and if Steve hated it, well.
do something they find strange or weird. Besides, Clint should be pulling his fair amount of weight.”
Steve shook Rumlow’s hand, and then they both went back to staring at the television.
the gears whirring in Tony’s head.
something in that wormhole? “No,” he said quietly.
Then the doors opened, and in came a short, bird-like humanoid male. Large brown eyes blinked like reptiles’ eyes, side to side over the slit-pupils, and the standard dark brown Jedi robes swished around the slight frame. The humanoid was about a head shorter than Ste-Virn, skin a dusty brown gleam under the warm lights. The brown hair was shaggy and almost feathered around pointed ears and a slender neck. Slender, strong, four-fingered hands rested against the belt, and a small white scar marred one arched eyebrow.
So if Steve didn’t show up, Tony might not call him on it because, of course, who calls alphas on their decisions? But Tony also would assume that Steve saw him lacking in some way, and the other alphas in the group would also see it that way. They would take to disrespecting Tony in the same manner, or overcorrect and take to babying and clinging to Tony in the opposite manner.
He frowned.
“Yeah, I bet,” Tony mumbled, and then there was a sigh. “Well, let’s get this blanket on you—”
“Looking a little bare for a café…” Tony hummed, frowning at the fridge. “I mean, I get it, you guys must buy all your stuff, but still…”
“I do this to you, it doesn’t go the other way around.”
Saark stepped forward, reaching into his own robes to pull out his holoprojector. Multiple faces—all young, all youths at or below Ste-Virn’s and Saark’s own ages—flashed across, looping through at least twenty different faces.
“You went to Knight Kulsi for stability, because Knight Kulsi was well-known for his morals and fortitude. He knew what was right, and fought for it, and he knew what was wrong. I thought I had been sent to Knight Kulsi for him to judge me, based on those morals. But I realized later, as an adult, underneath my new master, that Knight Kulsi was not stability for me, but familiarity. He was a close friend of my previous master’s, and someone I knew well.
He moved his way through the house—large living room (Barton had been sitting in a small office-like area to the right of the front door, but the left opened up to a fireplace and a comfortable couch), moved into a spacious kitchen. Omegas normally took up the cooking jobs of units, but Steve looked wistfully at a real oven and kitchen appliances. He missed cooking, and perhaps he could convince the omega to let him intrude upon that area.
“I know what you’re doing,” Fury growled into the phone.
She placed the last of her folded clothes in the basket very deliberately and very carefully, because she would not show how incredibly infuriated she was at the moment. “You didn’t give me a choice. You banished Clint here, when he was in no mental state to be banished, and then sent Steve here as well. Both of them have not a friend in the world and need someone to be around in order to keep them from… I couldn’t just leave them here. And you knew it.”
. “Yes?” he managed, voice tight and strangled.
When his eyes came back to the omega, the young man was leaning back, just a little, and had the most unimpressed look on his face that Steve couldn’t help but flush a little, feeling his ears turn red. Coughing self-consciously, he rubbed the back of his neck. “Alright, then I’ve just got to prove it to you, I suppose. Do you want to come down and meet the other members of the team?”
“Alright?” Steve repeated, driving the point home.
Steve shrugged one shoulder. “Honestly, I don’t know if he likes anyone right away? He seemed terrified of me, of Natasha, of Barton—Clint—and it took him some while to warm up. He was doing fine today. I think we just need to show him that he’s not going to get yelled at, or whatever the hell happened at his old team.”
Steve pressed a kiss to his temple as he took the chocolate chunk-cranberry cookies, and Tony felt… settled. Complete.
Sharon smiled back, and Steve wondered just what (who) they were talking about, but decided to focus instead on getting the mixing bowls out. A nice batch of muffins would be great. He had a lot of cookbooks—he had liked cooking before the war, even with the few ingredients he could gather up, but now there was just so much, so many things to try.
“Tony!”
“My parents had been killed only months before. I knew that, in a distant way, primarily because the executor of their estate had stopped by to tell me I had controlling interest in a company I knew almost nothing about. I was twelve.”
Steve let out a sigh—and he sounded like someone, the sigh pinging something in the back of Tony’s memory—before saying, “Alright, follow me.”
(No, he was not bitter that Natasha wouldn’t tell him who she was trying to date.)
He turned to face her, feeling his lip begin to curl into a snarl, and then he saw her eyes dancing and sparking. Playing. Teasing.
Steve nodded slowly. “Okay, point. I don’t like you that much, that’s true.”
He made Natasha choke on air twice with that, and he was pleased with himself for that.
“She?” Barton repeated, startled. “Are they supposed to be a she?”
because the fucking psychos had the rotting corpses as well—it had been… a lot. Instead, he cleared his throat. He’d bring it up to Natasha and Steve later, that Tony wouldn’t appreciate the fact that they all knew him, but he didn’t know that they literally worked together in the Avengers.
Needless to say, Ste-Virn didn’t know why the Council had summoned him beyond a report on his findings—something he’d been doing regularly anyway—and while… he wasn’t
“Of course, everything’s fine,” Tony immediately replied. “You with me now, big guy?”
Natasha hummed, mashing down her socks so she could close the small drawer.
a SHIELD safe house,” Natasha growled at him, even as she shoved a tray of cookies at him. “Restock the display case.”
Stark blinked at him for a few seconds before squinting. “Do I know you?” he asked.
“It doesn’t,” Natasha agreed, picking it up.
“What’s your name?” he asked, offering his arm to the omega.
And Director Fury wanted
The question made him backpedal, and Steve glowered. “No,” he ground out.
“Where are your clothes?” Steve croaked after a moment of staring, open-mouthed and flabbergasted at the naked young man.
Tony frowned severely. “I’ll have you know I am
Oh, but there was that odd stereotype that omegas weren’t supposed to have bad language, wasn’t there? Something like that.

Ste-Virn let out a weak laugh. “Yeah. You remember the kid I was stuck with for those nine months, until my new master?”

and ask that he be transferred out of this team. He knew Rumlow’s skills, knew that Rumlow could sometimes go toe to toe with Steve in terms of power and strength. Rumlow didn’t seem to feel pain, and he was an absolute bull-headed attacker in a fight, a definite asset. But overall… not someone Steve felt should deal with potential, literal conflicts with superpowered individuals that could literally blow up if you breathed wrong.
, and Thor is literally a god.”
, but definitely more accepting, of homosexual relationships. That no one needed to be a ‘friend of Dorothea’ any more. That even if people said something about it, all they were allowed to do was use words, not back that up with violence.
. Maybe twenty, twenty-two. No more than. And while Steve might (technically) be twenty-seven, that was still… very, very young.
“That might not be what they wanted, but it’s what I want, and this is my team. You make Tony uncomfortable, so I’m going to stick around, you can fucking bet on it. Until I know that Tony isn’t uncomfortable being around you, until I know that he doesn’t jump at shadows, I’m going to keep showing him that
Steve frowned, watching her close the door behind her. “Is something wrong?”
on their payroll, but that they could convince to sign up for this—are going to be here in this house. We will have a jet assigned to us so we can travel across the U.S. to respond, and SHIELD’s been working with the UN to get us approved to do early interventions in other countries.
Steve looked at her hand, at the white knuckles, and then slowly raised his eyes to meet hers. She met his gaze unflinchingly, even as he could smell the nervousness and anxiety coming off of her.
Ste-Virn groped for anything he could say. “Some of the guards can and have identified slavers from my previous information gathered, saying that they made regular shipments. And Anotoni! Anotoni’s testimony of what happened—”
Steve couldn’t help smiling in return. He was terrified, but it was just… it was just Tony. Two months ago, he would have been skeptical of a Stark, but Tony… Tony had changed his mind. Tony had brought him food, and made him look up lobbying laws, and increased his pop culture knowledge, and had given him someone to rail at when stupid people still wanted to deny the importance of vaccines. Tony was… not as bad as he had initially thought.
The omega clearly did not believe him at all.
There was a clatter, motion on Steve’s peripheral, but he didn’t move from his locked eyes with Rumlow, even when something wiggled between him and—
haven’t touched him, and I won’t touch him unless he wants that. That means
“How about we try it, then,” Steve sighed. “I just—I don’t like—people don’t treat me. Right. When they find out what I’ve done, and I try to talk about it, I just—”
Tony had noticeably stiffened when he heard Rumlow’s name, which didn’t bode well at all for the good of this team. Steve would have to contact Fury at the soonest opportunity, and see if Rumlow had been part of Tony’s old team. If that was true, it was highly unlikely that Steve could keep Rumlow on the team, regardless of assignments.
“That was weird. Wasn’t that weird?” Sharon asked.
.” The large, elderly man—bald-headed, beady-eyed, tall and broad-shouldered—leaned forward, smiling genially as if he was sharing a secret with Steve. “After all, he could have been the cream of the crop, sitting pretty in the research department, designing and creating fascinating projects by actually putting his expensive degree to use, and instead he decided to join the military. Yep, always thinking with his second brain, eh? Couldn’t get him to settle down and keep those knees together.”
It was odd, strange, that he sat here and knew that talking with Clint would… maybe not fix him, but when he talked with Clint he could practice his ASL (he was learning it, and he wasn’t great, but he wasn’t terrible either), he could rattle on and on about physics and geometry and Clint would reply back with weirder and weirder hypotheticals. They were both sci-fi nuts who loved to merge the universes of different movies together, discuss plot holes at
However, Clint—when attacking the Helicarrier under mind control—had never been close enough to Stark for Stark to get a good look at him. When they had all joined up, they had all been in their suits—and Clint’s suit, to protect his eyes and ears (his hearing aids, specifically), had goggles and a mask that distorted his features. It was entirely possible that Tony Stark did not recognize that this was a SHIELD safehouse. Well, it was an actual café and bakery, but it was staffed almost entirely by SHIELD agents that were trying to lay low or who were on mandatory paid leave (like Clint and Natasha, specifically).
They stood there a moment, staring, and then Steve decided Tony was waiting for Steve to change his mind. So Steve laid back down and got back under the thin sheet, staring up at the ceiling.
When he had interrupted Saark’s conversation with the Rodians, with
“In any case, your master and mine must have compared notes from our reports, because I got contacted a few days ago to return from the field and to meet with the Council. I thought it was because I had stalled out, so I’m glad that you have a fresh perspective on this, a new angle of attack.” Saark tapped on the nearest datasheet—a profile of one of the suspects, taken from the local authorities. “For sure, you at least have more information about these—all I had were security footage and vague descriptions from friends and family members. No name, no ID, just the hint or suspicion of a problem manifesting.”
Steve thought back to the alien invasion. The robot had showed up—Iron Man, the press had called it, Fury had called it—and saved all of their collective asses. The robot had also proceeded to prevent the U.S. government from nuking its own citizens, so there was that also. From what he could tell from briefings and information, Iron Man was in fact just a moniker given by the press and had not actively been chosen by the superhero in question. In fact, the person inside the robot—because it was a person, it was too intuitive for today’s robotic technology—could be male or female, alpha or omega or beta. There was nothing to indicate, not even a hint of shifter features to give that away. It was a robot in bright red and gold, and Steve had seen it and thought it was beautiful.
Steve tried not to look at the collarbones, thin and almost delicate, and the dark skin mottled with tiny marks—and no few bruises suspiciously in the shape of teeth marks—and instead fought to meet those dark, whiskey-brown eyes that looked more than a little fearful and wary.
“Y-yeah. Yes, alpha.”
,” Byu-Kyonn growled. “There’s some level o’ innerference in th’ signal. That’s all I can get. Y’ won’t be able to find him, specific’lly, down ta coordinates, but a general radius. Okay?”
Steve and Clint watched them go.
“Yes, the smuggler’s end. We’ve tracked a lot of so-called shipments between Outer Rim planets, a lot of little hideaways where kidnapped beings were transported for… many different tasks, most very horrible, but the majority of them were going to spice mines, or to feed into the misery that lives around the spice mines.”
“Good. Steve, you’re going to carry me to the living room. Brock, you’re going to follow. You two are going to sit nice next to one another and let me nap on your legs and you’re going to watch NASCAR until you can say sorry to each other.”
Abruptly, he turned and fully entered his quarters. His commlink was secured—and besides, he was calling a member of the ExplorCorps, which would hardly be out of character for their cover—and so he keyed in a very familiar code.
“Your cases intersect, and so you will be working together to solve these cases,” Master Windu said. “You have an increased budget to research and travel—the details will be forwarded to your personal datapads. We wish you the best in this assignment. Update us as new information comes in.”
Saark slanted a sharp gaze at him, but smiled wide and sketched a bow. “Toron, at your service.”
There was a long sigh, and then Fury grumbled under his breath. “No, Rumlow wasn’t a part of his former team. I had an idea about his previous team, but there’s not much I can do if there’s no formal report to have me look into it. His team broke apart—moved into different teams—and so he wasn’t needed for the three-team specialist and I was trying to find a place for him when your team was approved.”
“I’m not that kind of alpha. I’m not going to take advantage of him just because he expects me to,” Steve said. “But I’d like for you to look into him, if you can. Figure out who mistreated him previously—and how he got into SHIELD in the first place. Fury wouldn’t give me straight answers—”
“Well. I’d be a pretty poor head alpha if I didn’t listen to other positions and viewpoints,” Steve tried, keeping his voice as diplomatic as possible.
“Look, baking is just straight chemistry, then you put it into the oven, and you leave it. You don’t have to baby it like something over the stove, and you don’t need to, like, constantly taste and adjust and shit.”
, do you need help?”
There was no answer, and Tony slit his eyes open, and there was a fire in them that Steve was shocked by. “Brock Rumlow, are you going to ignore my question?”
“Ah, no,” Steve replied, looking between him and Rumlow. “You can claim any empty room. Natasha and Clint have already picked out their rooms—did you, Sharon?” he asked, turning to her.
Steve picked up two of the three pillows and immediately pulled the top comforter off of the bed. “I want—you should be comfortable, wherever you want to sleep.”
interests—all of that helps. And I know… I know it’s not a substitute for talking with an actual therapist. So—if you were to go to a therapist. I dunno. Maybe I would too.”
Surely not.
“They’re not very accepting, or open. I’ve spent a long time with them, so let me do the talking first.”

And Saark had always managed to get under his skin so easily.
He looked at the bystanders, lifting an eyebrow at them until he managed to shame the majority of them to walk away. Then he lifted his head up, leaned back against the tree.
The door opened, and Clint walked and stopped, dead. Behind him, Tony stepped into the room and froze.
to report that.” Shoulders heaving, eyes narrowed, Barton pushed a finger against Steve’s chest. “You gotta promise that you’re going to.”
used the oven before, not for anything—and set the timer. Then he washed his hand and stepped out of the kitchen.
Soft noises in the room came, and Steve did his best to fall asleep while hearing the soft breathing in the corner of the room.
Or, he could trust that Anotoni had gathered enough evidence, and prioritize rescuing whoever was in that hidden room.

Saark cut a sharp look at him, eyes almost too-bright, seeing too much. Ste-Virn fought not to flinch, to meet Saark’s eyes head-on.
months, but they had lived in the same quarters, shared the same routines, learned under the same no-nonsense master who was the only master at the time who knew how to deal with traumatized Padawans and was free to take on two radically different children who had two different perspectives on their respective trauma. They might not have been friends, but they had been (reluctant) companions.
Natasha paused on the stairs, glanced up at the sky, and did her absolute best not to swear at her boss in Russian.
,” Steve grunted, turning his head, letting his nostrils flare as he looked for that uniquely corn chip, pizza, dog hair, and gummy worm scent. And, also, he was picking up motor oil and metal, and the faintest hint of blueberries and cotton candy.
“I was not—” Master Kulsi began.
—honestly, for most people he’s very different and difficult to deal with—and so the juxtaposition is frustrating. The easiest thing to do right now is to just listen to Clint interact with him, see how it goes, and maybe just leave him alone. Tony Stark is very different from Howard Stark—and while I may not know that personally, I know enough from Colonel Fury’s rants that they are
“Anotoni!” he hissed, leaning down to shake the man’s shoulder.
Stane’s face darkened. “See what I mean? Cheeky bastard. I’m telling you, Captain; you’re young, so you’re bound to make some mistakes, but these omegas need a firm hand and direction in order to keep them on the straight and narrow—”
Barton looked at Steve, one eyebrow raised, and Steve shrugged uncomfortably under the judging gaze.
Angry? Possibly. Tony certainly was stiff and unyielding, clearly expecting
“Fury, who did you send to me as an omega?”
“Every word,” Ste-Virn confirmed.
Ste-Virn, who had been simply reveling in holding hands together to get lunch, started out of his reverie. “I’m sorry? What?”
Saark let out a little whistling hiss, and automatically, Ste-Virn felt his shoulders squaring—he remembered that noise, and the sharp, cutting anger that it preceded.

a park.
“Treat ‘im right or I’ll know,” Fury growled, and then hung up.
a hot boyfriend.
“Hey, did you make those?” Tony found himself asking.
“We have complimentary skillsets,” Natasha said dryly. “Even if not necessarily complimentary personalities.”
. Yes, I worried, and I was stressed, but you were a literal captive. All I had to do was follow the tracker I had been putting on you anyway.”
Ste-Virn did his best not to narrow his eyes at Saark’s strutting form.
Steve raised an eyebrow.
Tony must have dozed off, because he blinked open bleary eyes to see Clint’s shining, eager eyes.
“Yeah, that’s a… nice way of saying it,” Tony said softly. “ ‘Rescued.’ My dad died in that cave, and I got… I got this in my chest. We were attacked with Stark weapons, weapons that made their way into the hands of people who shouldn’t have had them. My dad might not have been the best of people, but he wouldn’t have sold weapons to
Tony drummed his fingers against his chest—a nervous tic Steve had noticed back in the Helicarrier—and scowled. “Just a coffee, I guess. See if you can find Clint; I’d like to talk to him.”
Ste-Virn pushed on, determined to get a plan in place and get the mission completed as quickly as possible. He’d been doing fine forgetting that Saark existed, and keeping his distance and the peace, and the sooner they could return to that, the better.
Saark squared his shoulders, brown eyes fierce as he hotly replied, “For your information, I asked to join with
The next day, Steve decided to check out some of the sub-levels—there had to be some, this was a safehouse after all—and was pleased to find a gym. Not a great one, but definitely one. Also, there was a security system.
Clint’s voice was a little tinny, and a little quiet, when he replied, “Well. He’s pissed, that’s for sure.”
“Man, you gotta make me some trick arrows. We’ll get Fury to give us a budget for R&D, get you up there so you can build with some other minds. I know you’ve been hanging out in Bruce’s workshop, but I also know he’s more biology and you’re more mechanics, so…”
Stark’s eyes had lit up when he’d seen Clint, and while he didn’t approach the counter, when Steve went back to get what Clint had asked for, he stepped back up. Clint greeted Stark with a smile, the two of them laughing.
“I am asking, now, that you look after me.”
Steve’s growl increased, reverberating through his chest as he folded his arms and shoulders around Tony.
“Of course he isn’t, he
…Still, where was Tony sleeping? The floor? Surely not.
He forced himself to settle down, grumbling, “The Howling Commandos
Steve opened the back door and got in, careful of his height and smiling a little when Tony immediately hopped off of Steve’s shoulders to pad over to the pile of clothes neatly folded on the seat behind Natasha.

happen very often. We’ll have more downtime than we know what to do with. This kind of heavy-hitting team, it’s not something you can loan to the local law enforcement or set to doing crossing guard duty. And we don’t even have quarters, not really, because Banner isn’t allowed on the Helicarriers and the prince is definitely going to be ill-used to quarters up here.”
Tony and Steve stared at one another, eyes locked, and finally Tony dropped his gaze. “I—I’m fine, alpha.”
Then Natasha turned around with—a tray?
“He’s out there, and he was happy to meet with Clint, talk with Clint, but I couldn’t do anything—I didn’t know—I just—”
There must have been some nonverbal communication, because then she was on the phone. “Steve, I know we did this wrong. Just follow our location, and come talk to him. I think he needs to hear this from you, not us. You need to explain what happened, and why.”
After a few minutes, Steve pointed at one of the corner seats in the window, a squishy armchair next to a wobbly, tiny table that was barely big enough for two coffee cups. “Sit down. I think I can make you something to drink, at least, for right now.”
you tell Fury about that, and request any information you can about this omega!”
he had to pull out some level of supplies to actually package and sell all the food, because Mrs. Qasim may have been their last customer, but she clearly was crowing about her haul to anyone she passed in the street because
“You look like hell. And…” Clint trailed off, didn’t know if he should reveal that he’d been there, yesterday—for all six hours of the fighting, of the cataloging at the end (because of course they couldn’t just handcuff and arrest the smuggling ring, but they had to figure out if there were records of how much technology had passed through the way point, if there were records of sale, had to crate up the technology and make sure none disappeared, had to crate up the

Clint looked up from the espresso machine and did his absolute best not to show any reaction on his face.
a prodigy, after all. Ste-Virn could even think that now with minimal jealousy, that the Force came so easily to Saark and Ste-Virn had taken years to master what Saark had grasped quickly.
that there had to be a reason for an omega who was clearly well-bred and well-kept to choose the military. No one chose the military unless they had no other option.
“I know!” Steve replied, voice low. “I don’t know how to undo that. I just need to show him that I don’t want him—I dunno, kneeling on the floor instead of sitting at the table!”
Steve licked his lips. “On the floor—it looks hard? Like. The floor?”
“You don’t like me, Rogers. I got it. I know it. It’s clear in everything you do, in how you don’t let me be alone with Tony, in how you treated me when we were out in the field. You let some random-ass
Tony stormed back up the street, into the lobby of his building. When he turned around, Steve wasn’t there anymore—and that was wrong, because Steve was supposed to be there so he could yell at him, so he stomped back out, and the sunlight was so glaring, that’s why his eyes were watering, and belted out, “Get your ass over here, Steve Rogers!”
You didn’t say that to your commanding officer. You didn’t say that to anyone, really.
Below. Anotoni was below him, somewhere. An underground chamber, though how to reach it was a different matter. Sewers? There was dampness, and wetness, but it wasn’t a stench or a scent at all. Just… wet.
“I was wrong. I talked a big game, I thought I was treating you like I would treat anyone else under my protection. I believed that I was doing nothing but what I should.”
“Mmm. Things make a bit more sense, now,” he mumbled.
“Is compromised, at best. At worse, it looks like he has a spice addiction. And just because some of the guards can identify slavers does not mean that the slavers actively gave them beings. It does not mean that any Indenaturing Mining high official knew about this. I need something more.”
She thought about it a moment before shaking her head. “Clint can take first watch, and you can take second. I’ll take third, right before sunrise. And then I’ll figure out what we need in this house and go into town with Tony and have him help settle us into this place. I’ve heard that if omegas have a say in the items and foods and things you put into a house, they calm down easier.”
“Is this because of the fight you two had last week?” she responded quietly. “I want you to be making this decision not because you’re running scared, but because you think it’s the best choice for Tony.”
“Look… can I at least explain?”
“Well,
“Romanoff, Barton, keep him safe?” Steve said, and without waiting to see them follow orders, he turned and faced Stane with the nicest smile he could muster. It felt more like bared fangs, lips curled away from his teeth, as he said in the politest voice he could manage, “I’m very happy I got to see the environment Tony came from, and how he’s grown from it. I must say, I’ve had no cause to complain about Tony. Tony’s absolutely perfect the way he is, and I’m glad he grew up with as much spark and strength as he does. He’ll need it, in this world. He has two months left until your guardianship runs out, four months left on his military service contract—which he renewed in order to wait out the guardianship period—and I hope he chooses to spend those four months with us. Good day, Mr. Stane.”
“We’re putting together an elite team to handle these kinds of threats.”
That… made sense. Was a shock, and the Council must have gravely mistaken what Ste-Virn’s reaction to Saark and what Saark’s reaction to Ste-Virn would have been, but that made sense.
“You thought our meeting was about a blue alien circle in your chest that none of us knew existed?”
He trusted Ste-Virn to watch his back, by standing back and letting this happen.
“It’s not just
“Well…” Steve felt very uncomfortable with it all, but he also didn’t want to force Tony to sleep on the bed if Tony did not want to sleep on the bed. “Will you at least… take a pillow and a blanket?”
“Was there something in there of importance?”
When he’d been forced to confront his own feelings, and how those feelings were affecting his ability to be objective with Saark, when he’d been able to work before with many different types of people from all walks of life.
“You never—not once did I see any indication. You kept away from me while we were preparing for our Trials, you never tried to reconnect. Seven years, we were apart from one another. Forgive me if this seems—”
to get an omega assigned to this team. Well, not even wanted in the sense that he was requesting Steve to go down to HR and fill out the necessary paperwork to request on omega—the presence of an omega was a forgone conclusion, by virtue of the fact that their team would have more than five alphas on call.
“I can feel you judging me,” Tony growled, and for some reason his voice was wobbling in his throat. “And I’d like to say that
(Ste-Virn couldn’t deny his crush anymore to himself, though he sure hoped that Saark didn’t notice it. He was doing his best not to be overprotective and controlling already, because Saark seemed to be very upset if Ste-Virn implied in the least that he thought Saark couldn’t do anything.)
“The hold, master. The hold of the ship shows years of wear and tear on the manacles, and the stench of the unwashed. The room shows constant usage and chains. Security cameras would reveal more of what happened in that room—”
And he was scared. He was scared because he remembered what some alphas did with their omegas, he’d
when that happened, because Clint would inevitably say that it was so doable, and the three of them
“Do I get a say in—choosing the omega? Sir?” Steve asked, trying not to sound as disapproving as he was, and make it obvious how much he disapproved of having an omega attached to the unit at all, especially when this would be a ceremonial team at best. How many alien invasions could the world expect, after all?
That didn’t really set Steve’s mind at ease, but at least Rumlow wasn’t someone who had mistreated Tony in his old team.
Tony looked up from the bench, eyes squinting in the predawn light and the streetlight that suddenly blinded him because he had forgotten he’d sat underneath one.
, Steve fucking Rogers!” Tony snarled.
“Down the walk, there,” Natasha gestured.
Steve jerked, and nearly threw the plate in his hand at the voice—but it was just Natasha. Natasha, who was here in this pseudo-job, this fake stage where they all playacted like they were all fine after the aliens
myths and legends.”
Steve went cold and then hot all over.
Clint could almost physically feel the bags and bruises under his eyes. In part because he was, in fact, still having nightmares, and he avoided the therapists at SHIELD like they were the plague—but in part because yesterday was the first day they had all physically been called out as an actual team. He had fallen off of not one, but
“Sudden?” Ste-Virn laughed self-deprecatingly. “You know that transmission I sent, that probably alerted the Rodians to our presence and purpose? I was calling my friend, Byu-Kyonn, and asking him about how you and I were like in the past, and he immediately replied that my crush was obvious to him, but it was good I didn’t… approach you, while we were still children.”
That wasn’t the point. He was scrunched up against this teeny tiny omega, and he flushed with shame.
Grinning, Tony sunk deeper into the chair. “Told you,” he said smugly. “I ought to come and cook for you every morning or something. Baking is just science.”
It was just a door.
“I mean. Yes?” Steve said slowly. “That doesn’t mean that he doesn’t deserve justice for what he had to face in his team before this.”
“What?” he asked, blinking at Natasha, who had her head poked into the security room.
And the
Groaning, Natasha stood up and pressed a kiss to Pepper’s forehead. “We’re telling him soon, I just wanted you to know without him telling you.”
The cat licked its lips, then stropped against Steve’s face, tail curling under Steve’s nose. Heaving a sigh, Steve stood up and made his way to the parking lot, Tony riding on his shoulder.
Steve thought morosely as he cleared his throat and tried again. “Not—not like

from this. She was here for Clint, and tangentially Steve as well. She was here to keep an eye on them.
, I don’t even know if he explained anything, or even talked to you directly.”
“So the moral is, the Jedi Council is a meddling matchmaker committee,” Rhodey (whose real name was Rhdernerssdurndt, so everyone just called him Rhodey) mutter-growled, his powerful form looming over many students as the five of them walked together to the cafeteria.
Master Kulsi’s silences always felt so disapproving—Ste-Virn couldn’t stand it. “Master, we
“Anotoni is fine, by the way. A heavy dose of spice, coupled with many days of not eating. But that still begs the question—what evidence do you have that Indenaturing Mining is behind this? How did you resolve this case to a satisfactory closing?”
“No, not—!” Steve said, nearly jumping up from the bed. “I just… do you not want to sleep on the bed?”
Ste-Virn had been trained in subterfuge—he knew how to blend in with the populace, how
It was… a good apology, and a sincere one. Ste-Virn was good at picking up falsehoods through the Force, and Saark was sincere.
“Of course,” Saark said easily, casually striding up into the ship. “Where to first?”
But Saark was mildly famous. Not well-known—no Jedi Knight was—but Saark did come from a fairly prominent family, and was currently the head of one of the largest technological companies. A silent head—Jedi gave up worldly attachments for the most part, so Saark was a silent partner. But Ste-Virn was always aware of Saark’s higher status—for all that it had been Ste-Virn who had stayed the longest time with his parents, they had been simple farmers and he only remembered them vaguely. Saark’s family had given him up when he was barely seven months old, but they sent care packages, and one of their good family friends was a Senator who was always around the Jedi temple and took a personal interest in Saark’s growth and learning. It had been something Ste-Virn had resented, something Ste-Virn had held against Saark while they were both young.
. And if you forget that, you’re just going to damage him more than anyone else.”
Ste-Virn did his best to calm his emotions. He was a Jedi Knight—young, perhaps, and only just, but still. Jedi Knight. He didn’t lash out in anger; he processed it and boiled it down to the worry and fear that would be the root of his anger.
The restaurant was a bit fancier than Natasha was really comfortable with, but it was also a very nice place and Natasha’s therapist had made it clear that she needed to try to do nice things for herself. She had made Steve fix the bathtub so she could have long soaks, and she had forced Clint (not that he had needed much forcing) to paint her nails bright colors. Even Tony had gotten into it, buying her delicate glass figurines that she displayed in her room.
In the end, that made the choice very clear. He reached into his robes for his lightsaber and burst forth.
Ste-Virn could slow down.
Steve deliberately turned his back. “I know Clint also wanted to talk to you a little. He was trying to pull me into a poker game earlier, and he may want to try his luck on you.”
Natasha grinned. “It’s Clint that does the stupid things.”

well with Saark. Saark had had a rich parent, had care packages from home, had a bunch of friends. Very sociable and bright, picking up languages like many of his species. Saark was an Ailish, a cousin species to the Fosh, without the overly avian features like true feathers, didactyl feet, and a beaked face. They were highly political and secretive, and Saark’s nest group controlled a huge intergalactic company that created, shipped, and designed weaponry, ships, and technology for almost every major nation. Their goods were so well-known they were practically household conversation, and Saark himself was equally in the spotlight all the time even though he was a Jedi. The Jedi masters had nearly despaired of Saark’s pleasure-seeking ways and three times had almost expelled him from the program.
Steve opened his mouth, and then sighed. “She said I needed to get more… experience with being around people. And she’s—she’s right, I know she is, but—”
He seemed to be drunk, or at the very least… not in his correct state of mind. Clint looked at him out of the side of his eye as he picked up the bills. It was a
Almost all of them looked blissed out on spice, some of them practically catatonic. Others flinched as he walked closer, and he put out of his mind why that would happen. Human suffering wasn’t something he would ever become inured to, but he knew that focusing on that would not allow him to accurately and safely assess how to remove all these people from this area. Surely they weren’t carried down that tunnel—that would be exhausting. And at least half of these prisoners were clearly unable to walk under their own power. There had to be another entrance—
“But of course, we’d be paying you double, because we are two beings now instead of one,” Ste-Virn said easily and quickly. “And Toron is Ailish—they don’t need large quarters to nest down in for a sleep-cycle.”
She sipped on her mimosa and considered the positivity that being in the café, speaking with one another regularly, doing more with one another, had led to. Oh, it wasn’t all the café, and a professional psychologist was better than talking to one another, but for sure having that support system had helped.
He didn’t know how long he sat and shivered on the floor, head pulled against Tony’s chest, thin fingers combing through Steve’s hair, but slowly he became aware that the door had opened and closed again at some point.
“Do you have anything to say for yourself, Ste-Virn?” N’t’lly asked, interrupting what Byu-Kyonn was going to say next.

and twenty, actually, and Clint considered Stark as he moved to the espresso machine.
If caught, what would happen? Death, that would be the smartest, easiest way to deal with the problem. If they knew Saark was a Jedi, it might stay there hands momentarily but most likely not.
He hadn’t seen any iron piece. Would this omega—
Tony snorted a little. “I can create this set-up to monitor SHIELD frequencies. That way we don’t need to set up watches at night; if something happens and you get a call, it will alert the rooms directly. I can set that up with… nothing else than what’s here, to be quite honest. If you give me some time.”
There was no dip on the bed, though. Nothing at all.
“Tony,
“Hey,” Tony whispered against Steve’s chest, nuzzling closer. “Hey, you okay?”
“I could find someone!” Tony said excitedly. “I could—look, there are a lot of therapists that have to deal with celebrities and shit, and yeah, maybe your VA benefits won’t cover it, but don’t worry. It’ll be covered, I’ll get it all squared away. Don’t worry.”
, freaking out about your safety about
That seemed like an odd team, to say the least. None of them had ever worked with the others, at least not very regularly (excepting himself and Romanoff, or himself and Rumlow), and certainly most of them were lone players, dispatched to handle a job quietly and discreetly (or, in Banner’s case, as loudly and destructively as possible). The only one he could be marginally sure of was Romanoff, and she was very private. That, of course, didn’t even take into consideration the fact that all of the names listed for the team were alphas, and that was going to cause friction in and of itself. “Permission to speak freely, sir?”
He learned that Clint became a brother to Tony in everything but blood, going from room to room with him and bringing Tony coffee, food, and fruits. (Tony had a thing about blueberries.) He learned that Sharon would specifically put on action movies with wildly inaccurate scenes just to watch Tony get increasingly more agitated until he blew up and began deriding the science and the feasibility. He also learned to be
They were going to, she knew, and hopefully Tony would be able to understand their point, and calm down after feeling betrayed.
There was a burst of laughter, and then Byu-Kyonn’s voice crackled as he replied, “You wouldn’ta called me inna middle of th’ kirffin’ night ta gnaw the fat. What’s th’ problem?”
“I, uh. I had them update the kitchen,” Steve said, mouth dry. It was intended as a present, but if Tony didn’t like it—
“Dude, your cookies are
He knew he needed to actually talk to Tony, too. Tony had introduced him to the world more thoroughly than any ‘introduction course’ SHIELD had tried to give him, had made him question and defend himself, do research and
“Okay, but you’re making him
“Yeah,” Tony sighed. “That’s what I thought this was about. I thought Fury either figured it out, or had it figured out and was telling you guys. I didn’t know—it wasn’t like we walked into Stark Industries from the front door. We came in from the side. And SI’s building houses a lot of other companies, and worked closely with SHIELD. I just… anyway. I didn’t expect it. I didn’t think Obadiah would go through SHIELD to get to me. I honestly didn’t think he’d care, when it comes to it. He got the company, which is what he wanted.”
This was not the time or place for this, and Ste-Virn looked around with sharp eyes, trying to pinpoint exactly how—
He made his way upstairs and paused on the second floor. The door to one room was half-open, the light low. He glanced inside to see bunkbed occupied, Natasha stretched out on the lower bunk and Clint nowhere to be found.
Now that he had pulled his head out of trying to creatively write a report, he could remember asking Natasha to do that, back when they first had moved in and first met Tony. “Oh, yes, yes. What did you find out?”
Steve tried not to stare, even as his brain only just processed the words. “Oh, you don’t have to—”
But it was something Natasha could figure out.
“We’re at the Turtle Pond, but we’re walking fast,” she replied, and then she hung up.
“You’re such a weird alpha,” Tony muttered, curling up like a kitten against Steve’s back.
Steve frowned at Tony. “Are you… bribing me to see a therapist?”
(And Steve always ate his cooking.
They both looked over to where Clint had been standing.
Stark sobered almost immediately, opening the straw and sticking it morosely into his over-caffeinated, over-sugared drink. “No. Honestly, I could stand to do with some forgetting.”
He couldn’t get his uncomfortable feelings out of his mind. It rubbed him raw, to think of essentially being assigned a sleeping companion, someone he’d have to deal with when he inevitably went into a rut (more likely to happen, once he was in close quarters with alphas for an extended period of time). There wasn’t anything he could do about it, either, which really was the core of his frustration. He was used to getting bad orders from the brass, and then working around them—he was used to the officers and General Phillips saying one thing and doing something different during the actual encounter—but this wasn’t something he could get around.
Master Windu narrowed his eyes at Saark, and at least some level of remorse and genuine respect entered Saark’s eyes. The relationship between the two of them was something akin to Jedi Master and Padawan, though Master Windu had never taken a Padawan in Ste-Virn’s recollection. “See to it that you cease to waste the Council’s time. Ste-Virn, you were going to present your findings?”
Swallowing hard, Steve’s mind raced as Tony moved about the room, lifting the lid of his trunk and fiddling with something before closing it. Did he bring it up? Ignore it? Let Tony know that Steve was available if he wanted to talk?
, Tony always stressed that it was

more people appeared instantaneously to ask for various baked goods.
“Yeah but… it’s necessary to be nice to your coworker, especially if you’re sharing quarters for the foreseeable future. You always thought I was arrogant and pushy and bossy and—”
“My master had been very strict, but also spoke to me on my level, not as if I was a child. He explained what attachments meant to a Jedi, and why they were frowned upon—but also that attachments were a part of life. He helped me navigate through the executor’s desires, my wider family’s desires, even the company officials’ desires. I decided to divest from war technology and focus on medical and agricultural technology, as there was higher demand and the less evil I could put out in the world, the better.”
because I had run into road-blocks on my end! I wanted to pair with
Clint nodded, and opened his mouth to answer when the front door opened and Natasha walked in, carrying a huge amounts of bags. Behind her, Tony walked in, and he was talking animatedly about… something mechanical, that’s all Steve could really get out, even as he put his bags on the floor and went to go open the door for her to the security room.
Tony, who had somehow taken it upon himself to stick close to Steve since last night—which was both embarrassing and also a little pleasing—looked around the security system and servers, eyes far away.
What was Fury trying to hide? What was he trying to keep, by holding Tony Stark to military service only the poor omegas or omegas trying to escape their lives ever did?
It looked like the omega was desperately biting down on his own lip, to the point that it looked painful. Nerves? But this wouldn’t have been the first place Tony would have been assigned, surely? He looked very young, but they couldn’t have possibly taken an omega straight out of Basic and attached them to a

Natasha sipped her beer and stared at Tony a long moment. Tony knew, and they both knew, but all that Tony did was become a little more tense—he was always tense, but it was hidden, and now it wasn’t hidden anymore—and turn his shoulder to not look their way.
Reflexively, Tony grasped at the mug, but he laughed again, and it was a hopeless sound. “If not me, who? Who saw all that? Who can prepare for that? Who can walk up to their government and say, ‘yes, there is a literal alien invasion force that could be called up in a matter of
Ste-Virn remembered. Saark was a delicate man, build wiry and lean, but short. As a sixteen-year-old Padawan sharing close quarters with someone who was twelve and who could outperform him any day, Ste-Virn had been unable to find the compassion a good Jedi would have towards others in Saark’s position.
“Ah, Clint came in. Or, well, he knocked, and started to open the door, and I said you’d come down later that you were busy.”

“It’s unlikely that someone’s going to mind-control Thor again to attack the team,” Steve said, glaring at Sharon, hating that he was on the floor for this conversation. “That being said, he wasn’t even hitting at full strength.”
Both of the omega’s eyebrows were raised now, and he looked very skeptical at Steve.
was a science) at the café for a good… oh, almost two months now, wasn’t it? Two months, and he’d given Clint and Steve and Natasha some sharp looks, but he never seemed to really question their identities. On the one hand, that was great, because Clint didn’t really want to be in the spotlight. It was easy, with Tony, to fall into discussing the latest episode of Dog Cops or the newest movie out, or talk about Star Trek. Clint didn’t have to feel emotions in a certain way. He didn’t have to be sad and guilty and remorseful and penitent and whatever the hell else he felt as expectations all the time from every SHIELD agent that passed through this safe-house.
The way that Saark was speaking was pricking Ste-Virn’s instincts. Something about it was… off.

Why him? Why… any of it?
He choked, scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand, tried to steady his breathing, his heart. His shaking hands.
the incredulity. They didn’t do this, ask about one another’s days or emotional states or, shit, anything of any importance. They joked around and teased and pretended like everything was abso-fucking-lutely a-okay.
No one came out, and Clint watched the car out of the corner of his eye, muscles tense even as he tried to smile at old Mrs. Qasim as she paid for her iced chai latte (
He might not be as skilled at the delicate parts of the Force, not as good at reading the signs of the universe, but blunt force? Brute strength?
Again, Master Kulsi opened his mouth as if to respond, but Anotoni quickly continued, “Also, I have this,” he said, reaching up to his ear and pulling off the mechanical contraption. “I used it to document everything that happened to me. I am sure I saw the head of Indenaturing Mining telling our captors to pick up very specific… request. For a being.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Byu-Kyonn sighed, and the commlink cut off as Ste-Virn’s datapad smoothed out and the fading signal pulsed, bright and clear, instead of flickering.
. He knows exactly how to behave so as not to upset an alpha, to wait for nonverbal cues, all of that shit!”
“Ah, Tony, my boy! It’s been so long since I saw you! Your alpha was so kind as to let me visit with you, and I must say, you are a sight for sore eyes. Look at how much you’ve grown!”
Most people were very visibly disappointed, but accepting. The café wasn’t that big a name—well, it was getting there now, apparently, because of the food, but it wasn’t there
Director Fury shrugged, standing up from his desk to stare out the window at the back of his office. “You can volunteer to get kitties out of a tree, for all I care. The Council has decided that a heavy-hitting team is necessary to have on-call, minimum five members ready to go wheels-up at any given moment. Now, because of the envoy’s duties in Asgard, and all the agents’ duties to SHIELD, there will be some times where some members will not, in fact, be around, but for the most part the Council wants a cohesive and functioning team unit and will do what is necessary to have it happen, even if it is to force eight different and short-tempered people to live together for an extended period of time. It’s not like it didn’t happen with the Howling Commandos. You can’t tell me all your teammates were content with having soldiers like Jones and Morita around, after all.”
It was odd, how he knew, he
Steve raised an eyebrow at the director. “Are these kinds of threats common, then?”
Brown robes wrapped around his muscular, humanoid body, Steve folded his arms respectfully and inclined his head. “Master Windu. You summoned me?”
“You’re not open,” Tony repeated.
, not cooking, because cooking was not always exact but
“This seems like a disaster waiting to happen. I’m trained in fieldwork with team members, as is Romanoff—”
“Something hurt him, earlier. Before. He’s expecting to be hit for having opinions, or for speaking.”
The noise from the kitchen cut off, and Steve cleared his throat and furrowed his brow at Barton.
Ste-Virn strode down the narrow hallway, ignoring the fact that Saark was speed-walking to keep up with him.
knows that. I don’t know why this omega was mistreated—”
, he knew, he
The omega blinked silently at the arm for almost a full minute, then he tentatively moved to stand by Steve’s side, only very lightly curling his fingers around Steve’s proffered arm, barely any weight at all—clearly ready to pull away.
Clint frowned at the kid, who quickly (slightly ashamed) went back to their books and laptop.
Ste-Virn staggered from the mental weight, and nearly fell to his knees—but there, a long winding tunnel, and the soft sound of water lapping against stone. There must be a boat there somewhere—and, if Ste-Virn remembered correctly, the canal fed into the larger lake that bordered the planet’s royal city.
“Yeah, but I’ve worked with him before. I know he’s a pain in the ass, but he’s also superhumanly pain resistant, which is in fact something we need if we suspect we’re going to be dealing with more unnatural threats like literal aliens,” Steve sighed. “Cupcake?”
Wryly, Byu-Kyonn elaborated, “You mean, when I found out my master was a… jerk, an’ lost m’arm, an’ you lost yer master in th’ same blow? Nah, I’ve no idea what yer talkin’ about.”
Finally, Kulsi sighed, and placed a hand on Ste-Virn’s upper back. “You did well. I know it doesn’t seem like I’m saying it, but I believe you have. I just worry about what this will do in the long run, because without that evidence, we can do nothing except let this continue. I am glad that by pairing you two together, you have managed to resolve your differences and work together. After all, that seemed like an impossibility when I was your master. But Anotoni must have been willing to cross the white bridge.”
Stark licked his lips, almost looked like he was going to respond, and then he withdrew, so suddenly and completely that it was like a wall slamming down between him and Clint. “Merchant of Death, that’s me,” Stark said, voice hollow with fake happiness.
Both Natasha and Clint swiveled their heads towards Steve, eyes intense and anger-filled. Steve immediately realized how that sounded and went tomato-red,
“Talking
, though!” Barton hissed. “Or at least, if it was one team, why was he with them that long? His reactions are
Steve rolled his shoulders uncomfortably. “I’m well aware of that. I know I have to show him that he’s not going to be punished for speaking his mind, that he’s here to be a peacekeeping force, not a punching bag or a doormat, but that doesn’t change overnight.”
people who did not know the Saark heir was a Jedi, just that he was a rich, silent partner in a large conglomerate.
“How do you know these are not just records of contracted workers? How do you know that this was a slaving operation?”
“I’m sorry, for making you choose between the mission and myself. I just knew, somehow, that the next shipment was leaving soon and I would be too late unless I left right then. It was manipulative of me to use my story to get your trust, but—”
Tony had been cooking (
—poor SHIELD was going to have to figure out how to handle this when they finally left this safe-house, and Clint didn’t envy them that position at all—and had to explain that they didn’t have any of their baked goods today, just coffee.
Saark trotted at his side, chattering both at Ste-Virn and at others in the hallway, but when they came to Ste-Virn’s chambers he grew quiet and pensive. “You know, if I am talking too much, or bothering you, you can let me know,” he offered as Ste-Virn keyed in his personal code and entered the apartment.
The Jedi temple was not particularly busy at the moment—the younglings had streamed past them because of the change of the classes, which meant as they continued their journey they only saw other masters or the messenger droids in the hallway. Ste-Virn did not particularly mind—Saark would wave, or inquire politely, even to some of the droids, but Ste-Virn always had his small circle of friends and not much wider.
, flew a nuke into space, got between Brock and Abomination, went toe to toe with Thor, and then
“I… like you, Anotoni. I have for a while. I always admired you, and when you were taken and there were times I couldn’t find you… I cannot promise you forever, but I can promise you for as long as I can. I would like to be in a relationship with you,” Ste-Virn said all in a rush, struggling to get the words out.
Anotoni grinned weakly. “I
Ste-Virn took careful notes, identifying what was different or similar to his own cases, what methods crossed. He asked intensive questions about the ports, the types of ships, where and what security each child had.
Any number of things.
The signal stayed put—the ship must have docked on the planet. Zhar, it seemed to be—one of the planets that had raised concerns about the company’s processes and legitimacy.
Steve sat up, heaving, gasping for air. It felt too cold, and he was shivering. He stood up, moving into the bathroom and scrabbling madly for the light switch. The bathroom was white tile, light blue on the floor, and it was
indignant.
Tony repeated the sound, somehow sounding

“The Council informs me that you and Saark may have killed one another.”
He never really had that need, but Bucky had needed the space before.
Steve was knocked out of his spiraling worry by the quiet, almost quivering voice that sounded both confused and too young by far.
how that sounded, but that was what he was stuck on. “You didn’t have anyone—”
Opening his eyes, he moved towards his left, to the smaller junkyard, and vaulted the fence easily. No real security cameras—couldn’t feel that hum of electricity that always buzzed against his skin when he was looking for those devices—but there were some big, hulking animals that came up to his shoulder. Animals, however, were his specialty; it was quick work to reach for the beast’s simple minds and project calmness, and trustworthiness.
Tony looked up, and he tried, he tried to make his eyes stop watering, tried to be in control, but this was so sudden, absolutely devastated, because he heard, he
“Lieutenant colonel,” Natasha echoed. “Rhodes, correct?”
, even, because at least Natasha has some weird fuckery with her genetics and her aging process is slowed and her healing process is increased. Clint and I? We have
Stark tapped his fingers nervously against the plastic cup, weighing Clint and clearly torn about what to do. “Well,” he said slowly, seeming to feel his way through the words. “I guess I could bury this business if you do sell information about me on the street.”
“Yes, Master Kulsi,” Anotoni said contritely.
He was an idiot. A moron. He bet they had been laughing at him so much, just making fun of the whiny rich boy—
and I couldn’t stop them. I’m just—our world doesn’t have any defense against that, we’re so far behind and we’re not in any way capable of dealing with that—”
Steve fought not to automatically snarl.
—” Natasha and Steve said instantly, at the same time, as their eyes popped open and they both turned around.
(Steve had wanted it to be a surprise but he also had the attention span of a goldfish and had absolutely forgotten about it after talking about his
“If you still want that coffee, it finished—” she began.
Master Kulsi’s body language stayed neutral, he stayed facing forward, but he cut into Ste-Virn’s explanation in his deceptively soft, sharp voice, “Security footage can be erased. The evidence you bring before me is circumstantial at best. There are quite a few Senators from the planets around here who have invested and backed Indenaturing Mining and if we cannot give real, solid proof…” He trailed off, and finally turned to look at Ste-Virn with one eyebrow raised.
“Late, he is,” Master Yoda murmured—or, rather, said quietly. He had to know that Ste-Virn would have been able to hear him, so he wasn’t trying, really, to keep Ste-Virn from knowing that his new partner was late. It made Ste-Virn… suspicious.
“It’s only bribery if it works,” Tony mumbled, but he looked at Steve, waggling one eyebrow tentatively.
“Anyway. I just. I couldn’t stay. They wanted dad to build some of the big ticket things, the really bad bombs. The ones that could decimate a city the size of… Los Angeles. Houston. Something like that. Just—obliterate it. No nuclear fallout, so no worry about long-lasting impacts, and bio-bombs that would just lay waste entirely to… anyway. Anyway, they, um. They had me. To make dad listen. And I was—I am an omega, so they weren’t, they didn’t, it wasn’t… that bad. But they had already attacked us with shrapnel bombs, and I was dying from that, and then when dad’s heart went out…
Instead, he said, “And I heard some things, on the news. Some warehouse in upstate New York.”
(Steve had waited until Tony left yesterday, then closed the café, ripped out the kitchen and built it, and had not slept until everything was installed and built up and
“I apologize,” Ste-Virn said, keeping his voice modulated and calm. “I was distracted. Let’s head to my quarters, and discuss the case further?”
“But it’s got nothing to do with you, if that makes sense. You’ve seen Tony, and you know what kind of unit he came from previously.”
But Tony immediately wiped all expression off his face and smiled blandly. “I’ve never met Thor or Banner. They sound interesting.” He stepped further into the room, very gently curling his fingers in the crook of Steve’s elbow, and smiled at Barton.
“Hey, Nat. Been doing well?”
“I know,” Tony interrupted. “I’m doing it anyway. Tough cookies.”
He never let anything bother him, and Ste-Virn supposed he should be grateful that Saark hadn’t picked up on his rudeness – or, at least, was willing to work past that and focus on the case.
into SHIELD—they were selected carefully. SHIELD was a government organization inside another government organization, and most people who made their way into SHIELD had all initially thought they had joined up for the special forces. SHIELD worked in places the U.S. government didn’t have full permission to operate, and did things that were not, strictly, the jurisdiction of the U.S. government. They collaborated with others—the CIA, the Marines, the FBI, even the rank and file of the Army—but when push came to shove they recognized none of those as authority. From what Steve could understand, SHIELD was funded almost entirely through slush fund money that was “a buffer” amount supposed to be used in case some catastrophe or the other struck. SHIELD had formed after World War II, after the effectiveness of the Howling Commandos and the idea of enhanced soldiers being an actual weapon on the world stage.
“Is everything okay?” Steve finally managed to ask, voice feeling like sandpaper dragging against his throat.
Ste-Virn could think back to that day, the day that he had gotten into the first real verbal fight with Saark since they had been assigned to work together, the first time he had made it clear that he didn’t believe Saark had changed from when they were children. When he had called Byu-Kyonn, and been made to really think about how he had behaved as a child instead of only focusing on Saark’s behavior.
“How. The hell. I mean. I’m a literal billionaire and I don’t think I could have a team fix something up like this so quickly. I would swear that there was a fridge here yesterday.”
“It might as well be. Why else put me
when we come back. He doesn’t like Brock, he has difficulty with Thor, and he still…” Steve trailed off, thinking of Tony’s tiny, curled up form on the very edge of the bed, flinching away from every movement Steve made. “He still doesn’t trust any of us not to take advantage. I don’t think he’s ever felt safe enough around us to nest, let alone heat, and that’s not safe for an omega. His guardian can fix that.”
Another customer walked in, and Clint pushed it to the back of his mind and turned to face the newcomer.
He just wanted Tony.
“Bathroom,” Natasha murmured, cracking an eye open.
At least Tony was either too nervous about his new position or not willing to call him on the bullshit, because he looked between them before licking his lips. “Well. When is the rest of the team going to be here?”
. He absolutely felt like the universe was out to get him. Hell, he’d felt like that for a while, but now, as he sat on the edge of his bed and trembled, unable to close his eyes because it reminded him too much of the inky darkness that poured into the spaces between stars and glistened off the edges of spacecraft and aliens and monsters he had never prepared himself for—
Somehow, it was worse asking twice. “You need any help in the front?” Steve said, forcing his voice not to shake, shift, or do anything except be straightforward. He had faced down literal tanks. He could do this.
When Tony stopped talking, the three alphas stared at each other a moment before Natasha propped her chin up on her palm, tilting her head in that way that invited conversation, encouraged people to let their guard down around her. “That’s all you know?”
She nodded and walked past to where Clint was ahead, still searching about for a scent. Steve watched a moment, then looked upwards at the tree. “I don’t think you’re exactly there, but I think you’re close enough to hear me. And I just—I wanted to apologize.”
, but didn’t change the fact that Ste-Virn had built his trust and worked his cover in with these people over a long period of time, and he didn’t want to chance it when there was a surefire in with the two pilots who were wary and suspicious of outsiders.
“Yeah, mostly,” Tony sighed. “Leaving out the fact that I was supposed to join up with an Air Force team that Rhodey picked for me. But I think Obie’s money pulled some strings, because I went into a general pool, and bounced a few teams before landing at SHIELD.”
Steve closed the fridge. “Go back out and sit down, Stark. This isn’t your own personal building—”
Saark seemed to ignore the danger to his person. Ste-Virn had accused him three times over that he was deliberately trying to make himself a target, and had in fact put a tracker on Saark’s clothes more than once. Saark had always handed them back to him when he’d come back from whatever errand or walk he’d gone on, and hadn’t commented, which Ste-Virn worried meant that Saark was indeed actively trying to make himself a target.
Then Ste-Virn was on his feet in a flash, dashing out of the quarters, onto the street, frantically looking around. Saark could not be suggesting this. He could not—
“I think we personally get along
“Well, I’m almost at the restaurant,” Pepper said.
Ste-Virn leaned forward and brushed his lips against Anotoni’s.
Fists clenched against his side, he stood in the center of the quarters, and for the first time allowed himself to think,
However, the omega was standing, and he was going to have to meet the other teammates eventually.
“Oh, that’s why,” Pepper sighed.
been there, had agreed to join up, had known Steve from their breakout of the HYDRA facility.
Even as he made his way towards the dog, he realized that the scent of motor oil was getting stronger, and then fainter. Steve stopped, and paused. He hadn’t seen Tony in the tree, hadn’t seen him on the ground… but he
Tony half-turned to him, and even through the sunglasses, Clint could

But that wasn’t fair. And the whole point was to teach him how to deal with people, after all.
of all places to work though his aggression issues as SHIELD tried to find a doctor that could actually deal with all the shellshock he was facing on a regular basis.
“Yeah. The bowman. The archer guy. You could be a dead ringer for him,” Stark murmured.
Steve shrugged. “I’ve never been around an omega long enough to worry about that, so I’ll take your word for it.”
his cheeks and ears light up red. “No, not like, not like that! I just—the first day—”
But Stark looked… bad. Looked like how Clint felt, back when he had come back to himself, back when Natasha had stood over him and blue trails of lights faded away from his eyes. Looked like how Steve looked, back when he had been shown in by a random SHIELD agent, lost and angry and hurting all at one time.
Ste-Virn blinked. “What—of course—”
It wasn’t like he could just sleep downstairs, let the omega have the room. That would be very obvious that he was trying to avoid Tony, which was both rude and unlikely to be taken the same way he meant it—all throughout dinner, though Tony had slowly come out of his shell and ventured opinions and observations, he kept his eye on Steve the whole time. He had remained intimately aware of where Steve was, what Steve was doing, and where Steve was moving at any given moment. It was both mildly amazing and upsetting at the same time.
Steve stared at the apron and breathed in a shallow sigh. He needed the practice. He didn’t want to stay cooped up in this safe house forever, and he certainly wanted to be able to interact well with the team that was most likely going to be permanent, at least for a while longer. If it meant playing well with a civilian—
He was three steps away from the bench when Anotoni said, voice raised, “I knew you’d come. You saved me, when I was unable to save myself.”
“Hey, Tony?” he asked, voice soft.
“You had omegas in the Howling Commandos, though,” Natasha said, and though it was phrased as a sentence, she lifted an eyebrow up in question.
Ste-Virn sure hoped they hadn’t. Or that he hadn’t, at any case. “No, Master. We’ve possibly had a real breakthrough in the case and we’ve been chasing it down—”
She finished placing her panties away and moved to her shirts.
There was a long moment of silence, and then Byu-Kyonn grunted. “Is that all ya needed ta talk ta me about? Yer both gonna haveta get along. Yer both adults. You can figure this out.”
There was silence for another two minutes, almost three. Then, the tiniest of movements, Tony scooching closer. And then closer.
, “I need to apologize, Steve. I should have gone through Stane’s staff, not just identified who he was. I should have done my job well, and I did not—”
Saark shrugged, a fluid motion that drew attention to his shoulders and arms—one that Ste-Virn viciously quashed. His feelings on this matter were pushed down and repressed, and he would strive to keep them there. “I was a child—headstrong, foolish, and angry. It was unacceptable, the way I treated you and the way I treated Knight Kulsi. He helped me, but I know that I said many words in anger, and never apologized for them.”
No, he had to lock those thoughts down. It was hard enough trying to get the boat moving in the direction he wanted it to.
Ste-Virn paused outside the Council chambers. He wasn’t—he wasn’t precisely
Saark came to a stop, absently ruffling the hair on the top of one youngling’s head as they waved and walked past. “Ste-Virn? Is everything alright? Did something happen?” he asked, looking thankful for the break in the quick pace.
Saark closed his eyes, breathing in, letting his breath out in a low, controlled moment.
Kriffing Anotoni
he was the smartest person in the room, and he acted that way.
Once again, the omega was at the foot of the bed, kneeling by the trunk—but this time there was loose sweats covering the omega’s lower half, and a very thin, almost nonexistent tank covering the omega’s top half.
Then Steve remembered the surprise he had done for Tony and flushed bright red, thoughts flying from his head. “Ahh…” he began, and paused.
Slowly, Natasha nodded.
Then Stark walked in.
Steve walked as briskly as he could without actually running, especially with all the tourists and walkers that were taking ‘covert’ pictures of Steve and Natasha. In the distance, he could see the wagging tail of a golden retriever, and he made his way towards it.
He wasn’t in the wrong, and he knew it. Saark ignored all his cues and clear desires. Perhaps he had misread Saark’s intentions, but that didn’t change the fact that boundaries were important and Saark never respected his. He overshared and treated Ste-Virn as if they were long-lost friends…
Which one was Tony?
And it did help, he felt. It was at least more…
it happen, and he didn’t really want the responsibility of an omega’s life in his hands. He’d have to establish himself as top alpha, as claiming the omega, to ensure that none of the other alphas mistreated the omega—and neither he nor the omega would have a choice in that matter.
“Because Natasha is an accomplished spy and who I send in to read a situation to tell me how to move,” Steve growled, even as he could hear footsteps approaching.
“What’re you making?”
Rumlow tapped his fingers against his thigh, rubbed his thumb over Tony’s shoulder. Then he looked up, eyes dark and serious. “That’s not what the army puts omegas in for.”
The two of them remained there, Anotoni standing and swaying, Ste-Virn sitting, before Ste-Virn snapped out of it and quickly patted the bench. “Sit down, you look like you’re about to fall over,” he said.
the best to be said at the moment.
There was no response, and then the door of the bathroom opened.
His eyes jerked back to the small form he had passed over as he was scanning and assessing the situation before him. That hair definitely looked like—
“Well, if they didn’t grab your clothes, you’ll just need to stay in cat form until we get back to the house. I don’t want you to have to be naked around them just because they didn’t remember to do that,” Steve said.
Anotoni continued mumbling to himself, and Ste-Virn tried not to worry about how badly he seemed to be reacting to the drugs. Unless they’d just given him a dose? Maybe his biology reacted differently to it?
What else could he imagine? Crashing into the water, waking up
He sighed deeply and rubbed the back of his neck. “Go ahead and contact this Obadiah Stane, set up a meeting in New York City at Stark Industries’ offices.”
He took Stane’s hand forcefully, squeezed, just once, just strong enough to make Stane wince visibly, and then he turned and exited the conference room, made his way to the elevator, and managed to make it out the door before swearing up a storm, fumbling with his phone as he sought to get Natasha or Clint on the line.
alpha, couldn’t provide or care for Tony in the way that Tony needed long-term.
It fucking sucked.
Walking back to his barracks, he forced himself to take a good look at his distaste for having an omega in their team. In some ways, he realized he was acting old-fashioned and over-protective—in a way that would have had Peggy decking him, super-serum or not. War wasn’t all that messier now than it was back when Steve had first joined up—it just felt like it was, with the multiple civilian casualties on any given day, the trauma and high-stress environment, and the lack of any real target.
. There was, fuck, there was at least ten of those huge dropships, you know, the ones that had about a hundred soldiers waiting to jump off? And there were more in the distance, I couldn’t count,
He had walked away, and his master had been cut down.
“I know you said—”
It wasn’t until he was standing in front of the doors when he realized that just because his sleeping schedule was fucked didn’t mean that everyone else’s was, and he folded his arms tight around his body. There was a bench further down; he’d just sit there.
, are those the chocolate-banana-peanut-butter cookies you usually sell out of so fast in the morning?!”
“Yeah, I think Tony’s got some understanding of computers. He said he could rig something up so that it would alert us in our rooms, so we wouldn’t need to watch the security cameras and patrol the house in watches.” Steve knew it was probably just the proximity to a new omega, but he sounded besotted and he knew it. Tony had pulled him through his panic attack, had stayed by his side all morning, had even started coming out of his shell and volunteering opinions. Steve thought that was a massive step forward, honestly.
“Yeah,” she replied, smiling back. “Is this our omega?”
Rumlow’s eyes dropped from Steve to Tony, and Steve felt his growl rumble through his throat.
“I don’t think he was treated very well on his last team, so I’ve been trying to show him he doesn’t need to worry about that here. But. Anyway. Did everything go okay on your mission?”
can you tell I write Natasha the least because I know her the least
“What? No—sit down, Stark—”
“How’s it going?”
Pepper regarded her quietly for a long time. “I understand that—that your identities mean a lot. I certainly know I was upset that Tony just—just announced who he was on live television. I know what that means. And I respect your decision. But he is going to be hurt from this.”
That was why Natasha was calling. They were supposed to be meeting for drinks, since Pepper’s schedule was so busy all the time, and it was hard to actively schedule dinner dates or lunch dates, they clung onto brunch and evening dates with one another and made it work.
“I can get them,” Steve said immediately. It felt like a surrender, a loss, but right now…
(Clint was coming to learn that Tony did nothing without throwing himself one-hundred-and-fifty-percent into it, going way beyond what normal people did, because Tony himself had only two settings—twenty percent, or two-hundred percent, nothing in between.)
It took a moment for Steve to be aware of just how much he was curled on top of Tony’s thin legs, stretching out in front of him as he leaned up against the soaker tub, how tightly he was gripping Tony’s sides and pant legs. Also, those didn’t feel like pajama pants, or at the very least, they felt like very thick pajama pants. Maybe Tony got cold too—
“We’re getting nowhere.”
The spicy sweet scent of burning cotton candy, of sugar, and that light, fresh scent of blueberries wafted up, even as motor oil and metal made a barrier between him and Rumlow.
“Look, you won’t be around forever, is what I’m saying. Someone needs to make long-term plans for this omega, because we’re not it. I am
“It’s your blanket,” Steve said immediately, because even though they’d been in this house for almost two months now, and Tony was definitely more relaxed with the team, he still refused to sleep in Steve’s bed and so Steve had made sure that Tony had all the blankets he might need in New York winters.
him shaking his head, like she was in the wrong, not him. “You’re always welcome to come back on a mission—it’s not mandatory for you to have leave, like Barton or Rogers—but you need to log at least six hours, spread over a minimum of three days, before you can have any high-level missions.”
terrorist groups. Did they write that the young colonel?”
Was it really pouting?
“And Tony?” Steve asked.
There was nothing in Rumlow’s voice to suggest that he thought Steve was overreacting. Only resigned and weary acceptance.
(The new, temporary headquarters, since the alien invasion had mostly flattened the original all the way to the ground.)
She eyed him contemplatively before saying, “Do you not like washing the dishes? I thought you didn’t like doing the cooking.”
team.
“Mr. Stane, I believe there may have been a slight mix-up. Tony’s absolutely brilliant, has been utterly useful. Fixed our security systems, improved our pack house, build many small upgrades for our armor and our equipment. I think you’ll find that we’re all very fond of Tony,” Steve tried.
“You left the door open?” Steve asked.
“You’re just going to let her get away with that?” Rumlow grunted from the floor where he was kneeling, teeth clenched.
“It sure does look like it,” Byu-Kyonn sighed. “Have you ever seen anything so disgustingly cute?”
Ste-Virn had to stop Saark, somehow. He had to. He couldn’t just leave him out there.
“It’s not a babysitting job,” Fury sighed on the phone.
(Who would have thought that the man in armor, the media darling, would be silent about pain that he suffered? That he wouldn’t seek out help?)
“You mean he’s been there all that time and you didn’t bother to ask his name?” Fury said, voice dry.
* * *
The omega said nothing at all, following almost perfectly with Steve’s movements and steps, and Steve consciously chose to shorten his normal stride. When no words were forthcoming, Steve moved to the stairs—thanking all the stars in heaven that it was wide enough for the both of them to walk down at the same time, if only just—and continued, “In any case, this team is not going to be called on very often. Most people here are… ah. Not normal, I guess. I am not sure how else to put it. We are supposed to deal with otherworldly threats, like the aliens that descended upon New York City those two weeks ago? Anyone on SHIELD’s payroll that could possibly do so—and even a few
“I didn’t
The delighted look on Tony’s face when he came back made Steve forget all about telling Tony his identity.
After dealing with the customers, and realizing Tony had, in fact, fallen asleep (or passed out) in the chair, Clint turned to Natasha.
“Nah, man, they don’t teach this shit in school,” Tony said easily, and then he froze.
Saark must have viewed that differently. He must have seen Ste-Virn in a different light than Ste-Virn had seen him.
Tony sipped at the cup and breathed for a few minutes. “What about them?” he finally said quietly. “Hawkeye—well, I think I’d get along with Hawkeye. I got along with Banner, but with the Hulk and everything I know why he stepped away. Black Widow… she doesn’t seem to like me very much. Never really talks to me. And Captain America…” he sighed. “I don’t think Captain America likes me very much either.”
Saark bit his lip, and Ste-Virn turned his eyes quickly away from Saark to stare instead at the datapad Saark was scrutinizing.
“The best, I swear. Don’t know how Fury pulled this, but I’m glad I got called for this. You know, they were thinking of Blonsky here, and Morse, but I’m glad I’m here.”
Natasha side-eyed him. “Did you run the whole way from SI to here?”
Ste-Virn let out a long sigh. On an unsecured line like this, where the pilots could notice his transmission and most likely listen in with some mid-level tech, he couldn’t tell the real problem—that it felt like Saark wasn’t respecting his years of experience, and it was throwing him off-kilter now just like it had back when they were in the same quarters, Saark questioning Ste-Virn’s abilities and skills and throwing his natural talent in Ste-Virn’s face the whole time.
“Well, I was recalled as well to speak with you, but I had set up a transport for myself to be taken into Ryloth through back channels. The transport is one I suspect that helps ferry kidnapped and enslaved beings into Ryloth’s mines, or being shuffled into more legitimate-looking transports. As you heard, my investigation suggests that the workers in the mines are not free and able to leave when they like; they are slaves, and they have no where else to go. Two or three planetary systems have voiced their concerns with this…” Ste-Virn trailed off as he flipped through his information to bring up the names. “Ah, here—Kalinda, Lorahns, and Zhar. These small systems all have anti-slavery laws, and are concerned by some of the reports come from the mines.”
Bruised, bloodied, and with one sprained ankle, Ste-Virn stood panting over the last of the guards. More reinforcements would be coming, he knew, but for right now, there was no one standing between him and the prisoners being kept in the back.
“You know,” Tony mumbled, voice still heavy and logy with whatever Tony had put into his system, “The ‘Avengers.’ Didn’t even want me, you know. Wanted the suit, didn’t want me. What a surprise, yeah? Tony Stark is never recommended.” He let out a hollow laugh. “Anyway. Fucked up, got my team hurt.”
Steve opened his mouth, and then closed it. It was the middle of the sidewalk, it was five-fucking-o’clock in the morning, and this was suddenly the scariest thing he could think of doing.
the judgmental look, practically hear the skepticism.
And Steve was eighty percent sure he was in love with him.
Steve immediately felt his heart pick up at the thought of having to deal with people—people with different slang, different expressions, different ways of dressing and behaving and greeting—and licked his lips. “I’d—I’m good right now,” he said.
They sat in silence, Ste-Virn looking down, Kulsi’s face turned to him. Around them, in the royal militia’s headquarters, beings were rushing back and forth, filling out paperwork and processing the many guards, trying to offer sobering-up pills and treatments to the ones still too far out of it. The noise pressed around them, around Ste-Virn, and he didn’t know what to say.
Only, he never thought he’d apply the term to himself.
Tony stiffly moved with Steve’s pushing, perching almost nervously on the edge of the chair Steve had practically dragged him into. He looked between Natasha, Barton, and Steve, and looked almost as if he was going to say something—and then he stopped, eyes dropping, even as his fingers tapped nervously against his thigh.
Ste-Virn blinked. “For what?”
Natasha delicately shrugged, unbuckling the flight straps. “I don’t have to be okay with it, or not. I’m not team leader, you are, and I’m not the one with primary access and responsibility of the omega—you are.”
“—and he’s making me think he doesn’t have the freedom to look into it, so he expects us to be looking into all of this and figuring out what happened,” Steve finished.
Then it was a matter of finding the most recent tracks, and identifying the manhole cover that led to a drain.
Steve growled under his breath, the deep rumble of his lion escaping before he could control it.
didn’t know who Steve was. Rolling his eyes, Steve turned to case the house. “Steve,” he answered as he left. “Call me Steve. We’re going to be seeing a lot of each other, after all.”
Natasha blinked at him. “Like… in general, or in specific?”
It still felt like giving up, and Steve made it his goal to try and figure out to how to interact with Stark as soon as possible.
Sitting present in the Council today was Master Yoda, Master Windu, Master Sifo-Dyas, Master Eeth Koth, and Master Yaddle. The other members were not present, but having five of the twelve present was terrifying enough.
So. The closer he walked towards Clint, the fainter now that scent was getting. And, looking at the tail, he could faintly make out that Clint was casting his nose around the ground and into the air, looking for something as well.
“I’ve never had anyone to sleep next to.”

“The other day. Rumlow explained to me, why you were so protective of the little omega. And that’s very kind, and we do have a long-term team, so you might be able to keep him protected for a while longer yet. But we leave all the time to go fight supernatural threats. If we didn’t have Iron Man there—a literal wild card who we

Pity, and empathy, welled in Ste-Virn as he remembered, long, long back, when he had looked at his bleeding best friend and then at his master who had been fighting Byu-Kyonn’s master, a Sith lord revealed. He had made the decision that day to take Byu-Kyonn to medical authorities, instead of staying and aiding his master.

“Just because I have an idea doesn’t mean I can prove it,” Fury repeated impatiently. “I couldn’t watch too closely over the kid, but he’s safe with you. Right?”
“One of them?” Clint parroted, doing his absolute best to keep his tone level and his pulse steady. It wasn’t too hard—Clint was an operative, a successful one, and he knew how to keep his cool even in the most circumspect interrogations.
Ste-Virn dashed back up the stairs, fumbling with his datapad as he quickly keyed in the tracker’s code. It lit up, streets away, moving quickly and with purpose.
Six closed doors, two of which revealed the laundry and a bathroom. The remaining four rooms were relatively decent-sized—a closet, a bed, and a dresser in each one. One of the rooms had a bunkbed, however, though it seemed to make up for it by also holding a television against the wall. He could see on the upper bed was a duffel bag—probably Barton’s, already claiming his spot.
“Tea?”

Steve Rogers stared at the water and soap suds and wondered if he was, perhaps, in a very strange level of hell.
(See the end of the chapter for
Barton barely paused before continuing, “—why
“Did Tony shift?”
“Of course!” Saark said, voice chipper.
She blinked once, slow and considering, and then turned back to the oven. Apparently, SHIELD had multiple little places like this all around the world, little safe houses that were businesses to give validity to covers and identities, and Steve hadn’t known what to say when Fury suggested it. He didn’t know what to say for any of it, really. How did he tell a commanding officer ‘life doesn’t feel real anymore, and washing dishes after customers after the life I had and the death I had and the life I had
If he thought Steve was going to get offended over bad language…
to him. He had spent the entire trip to Rodia stressing that his contacts did not like new people, did not listen to many people at all, and the entire time, Saark had countered by saying that people loved him, that he was especially keen on picking up nonverbal language and emotions, which was
“I don’t—no, I don’t know who’s at the safe house. Clint’s the one on-site, undoing any of the traps or safety measures, and he’ll receive whoever it is. But I know some of the names on the list, and I can think of a few that Director Fury may have thought would match our unit well.”
“I think I have a high-society omega who is in a place he really shouldn’t be. Tony Stark? Descended from Howard Stark, back in the war. He’s not been treated right in his previous team. Was Rumlow a part of his former team?”
Rumlow started to tense up, fingers catching in Tony’s hair, and Tony gave a little grumble at the movement. Slowly, Rumlow forced himself to relax, even as he clenched his free hand into a fist.
“Kriff off, Byu-Kyonn,” Anotoni yawned, keeping his fingers entwined with Ste-Virn’s regardless of the dirty looks of the elder Jedi walking past them, or the curious or, alternatively, revolted looks the younglings and Padawans gave them. “If I want to show affection, I will.”
“I know,” Byu-Kyonn laughed. “You triedta hide it. You couldn’t ever hide anythin’ from me, an’ ya know it. But I don’t think anyone else woulda noticed.”
He could remember, vividly, after his master had died and he was first being introduced to Jedi Kulsi, and how he’d strove to appear mature and capable. He wanted a master, a mentor. He wanted to be a Jedi more than anything else, and with his old master’s death… he was grieving, but he also did not want to let others share in his pain. His master had believed in him when no one else had. Ste-Virn had nearly not been picked to be a Padawan, had nearly lost his chance to be a Jedi, until Ab’Ram Skine had looked at the skinny, twig-like twelve year old child—someone identified as Jedi late in his life, almost four years old, and someone who had struggled to maintain his connection to the Force at the same level as his peers—and seen something worthwhile.
Clint wandered into the kitchen a few minutes after Rumlow had wandered out, a frown also on his face. “Did you know Rumlow was assigned to this team?”
Tony sat.
Good Jedi didn’t get angry. They certainly didn’t whip around to tower over their partner, eyes flashing as they hissed, “You know, but you thought you knew better, and you didn’t value my input at all! I’ve been working this case for a long time, but you think you can walk in and solve it without listening to the intel I’ve build up over time? How is that in any way a smart way to run this investigation? Did the Council somehow indicate that I had nothing and needed your help? Did Master Windu decide to intervene so that you could do something other than escort politicians around?”
Again, there was a long moment. Steve could feel his heart pounding against his chest.
“Yeah,” Steve sighed. “Just… let me know, if you notice something, and let Tony know that he doesn’t need to do anything he’s not comfortable with. He can tell me if something’s up or wrong.”
He had to trust that Saark would not get caught. That Saark had a true feeling from the Force, was guided more strongly by the invisible bonds of the universe than what Ste-Virn could feel and trust.
A mug of lavender and rose tea—the scent was light, floral, wafting up with the curls of steam—appeared, and Natasha curled Tony’s hands around it. “Drink, Stark,” she said quietly. “No one expects you to deal with it yourself.”
“What? No, you don’t have to. They just like to get used to an area, that’s all, and since that wasn’t going to be
“Well, I think Carter will be the first to show up; she’s closest and not on assignment that I know of. Banner and Thor are wild cards; we don’t really know when Thor will come, and Banner is under control from SHIELD and will need special permission to leave that close supervision. Rumlow is on assignment, and at best he’ll be back within a few days. He might be longer than that, though.”
“Forget it,” N’t’lly sighed.
“So you’ve been tracking it from the smuggler’s end, correct?”
Ste-Virn’s mind could only think of worse-case scenarios, could only imagine what might be happening to Anotoni right now. Could only think about what had happened to Byu-Kyonn, so long ago.
The first thing that popped into Steve’s mind, and consequently out of his mouth, was, “I never saw that before!”
Clint snapped back to the fact that he had been staring in surprise at Tony, a little bit taken aback at the fact that Tony didn’t recognize him. “Ah, yeah, bud, sorry. Any specific coffee?”
trust to show up every fight—you would have been dead. No matter what type of superhuman you are, you’re still
For a moment, it looked like Steve was going to be stubborn about it—he was bad at admitting he needed help, but then again, they were
Currently, Saark was pacing the small quarters they were renting while here in Ryloth, Ste-Virn sitting on the couch where he slept because it was long enough for his tall body.
Steve sighed and looked around the room for a long minute, casting his eyes for anything that could help him.
“As are
It was probably too early, he told himself as he staggered to his feet and dragged on a pair of sweats and a jacket over his tank top. It was probably too early—he repeated it, over and over, as he took the elevator that went straight down to street level and deposited him out on the just-barely healed New York City streets, the streets that he had helped tear up two months ago and had put more money than his investors were happy with into repairing.
“Yes,” Steve said, and then he rolled on his side, presenting Tony with his back and his neck. “I’m cold. You can curl up onto my back.”
Fury grunted. “I don’t have anything else right now except that. I don’t have proof. I’m not going to try and get involved until I get all the dominoes lined up perfectly. If there’s one thing I’ve learned as I’ve climbed through the years, it’s that if you have all your Is dotted and your Ts crossed, it’s not like anyone can get mad at you. So I’m not going to do anything until I’m sure that everything will fall out in the most favorable way I can make.”
Tony had turned mute and demure again, dropping his eyes to the ground. “Tony, alpha,” he said quietly.
Then another car pulled up.
“What that means,” Steve concluded as they reached the bottom of the stairs, bypassing the second floor to make their way to the kitchen and common area, “is essentially we’ll be around the area a lot unless there’s a specific need. That many alphas in one small house is a recipe for disaster, though, which is why you’re assigned to help keep the peace.”
“That’s not how it works, now. We’re not so desperate as to accept omegas into the rank and file of the forces. If we have a major war, and need to deploy, and lose many soldiers—then, maybe. But for now, there’s no draft, and no need for omega soldiers.”
Without waiting to see any confirmation, Steve about-faced and closed the door behind him—as he hadn’t even moved out of the doorway yet—and leaned against the door.
Steve weighed options. He didn’t want Tony to go. He also wanted Tony to have options—options he was realizing that Tony, as someone contracted to take care of this team, didn’t really have. He wanted Tony to choose him, yes, but he wanted it to be a real choice, not the best choice of a bad lot.
“Anyway, I thought Carter would be here by now, but I guess she got held up at SHIELD. She should be in soon, but I’ve set the alarms. Do you want to take first watch?”
why the Jeep or minivan or truck would no longer be a usable vehicle for them.
Roughly clearing his throat, Saark reached out, and unthinkingly, Ste-Virn reached as well to clasp forearms with him, to give him that connection.
It was a statement, a lame one at that, but Tony was operating on maybe five hours of sleep strung out between the same number of days, too much caffeine and not enough food, hands shaking, mind going too fast for him to really process anything that whirled through it, and so it was the first words that tumbled out of his mouth, spilled onto the air between the two of them.
“You’re muttering to yourself again,” Natasha murmured as she stepped by. She had gloves on, washing the dishes and keeping the kitchen tidy, and he paused and sighed.
For a long moment, they did not move, and then Ste-Virn pulled back, feeling his neck and cheeks heat up with a flush.
Ste-Virn shook his head. “I don’t usually drink it, sorry. I don’t stock it regularly.”
“Go back to bed, Steve. Just because you heal fast doesn’t mean that you don’t feel the aches—you practically shattered your legs yesterday and they can’t be feeling good.”
“Call me sweetheart again and I cut those off, not just knock them back up into your spineless body,” Sharon said cheerfully. “I’m going to go pick out my room, Steve.”
“Hey, hey, Steve, it’s fine. Let me just—”
of the upper window onto the pavement outside, and Iron Man, being the tank that he was, had just
And it was—the accurate words, the depiction, hell, Steve didn’t know, but he began laughing, which dropped into sobs within moments. Tony slowly eased Steve down to the floor, muttering under his breath, and Steve could hear nothing but Peggy’s voice, breaking in his ear as that darkness rushed to swallow him whole.
…Fury would ask for proof.
Steve’s enhanced hearing could pick up the cracking, the stress from what he was doing to the table, and he realized he had made a terrible mistake. He stood up, pasting a fake smile on his face. “Well, I just wanted to meet the guardian that had influenced Tony so much, and let Tony’s guardian know that he’s being cared for to the utmost of our ability. I hope you have an amazing day, Mr. Stane—”
It had been hard for Ste-Virn to accept others easily, due to the difficult nature of his training, late picking, and late placement. He knew that, objectively. But seeing it in front of him—Saark, who had come to the temple exceedingly young and rocketed through classes so brimming with natural, raw talent that he was easily paired against older Padawans before he had even been chosen as a Padawan… it made it harder for Ste-Virn to let go of old resentments and hurts from the past.
Fuck, he was kissing fucking Captain
“Ye-e-e-es?” Natasha replied, drawing the word out slow.
“You’re absolutely right, of course,” Director Fury said easily enough. “Why is why we’ll be outfitting you with team quarters on the ground. SHIELD has some safe houses scattered about NYC; we’ll repurpose one for you and your team’s needs, with the understanding that Banner remains on the grounds of the safehouse at all times.”
He did not have a lot of time. Those that could walk, he urged up, gave them concrete goals and another prisoner to help pull to the boat. He moved back to Anotoni’s side, but by that time a slight young being was helping prop up Anotoni, and so Ste-Virn gritted his teeth and moved past the instinctive need to care for Anotoni to instead look after other, worse off beings.
“Ah shit,” Tony muttered, glancing hastily at the clock—and then froze, one eye sliding to look at Steve.
That was… a good question. He knew Rumlow, just from the work they had done together on different missions, and he was certain that Rumlow was out on a mission. He wouldn’t be around for a few more days at the least, a few weeks at the most. Banner, however, would need special permission to exit SHIELD’s tender care, and Thor was off-world.
Rumlow strutted into the kitchen. “This seems like a cushy job. Great pay, great digs, a lot of freedom, no real job? Just sit and wait to be called? Seems like the perfect set-up. And an omega to use whenever?”
Well… he could talk about some of that.
Anotoni rolled onto his back, a languid smile on his face. “Ste-Virn,” he mumbled, eyes hazy. “Could feel y’comin’. Ev’ythin’s hazy.”
Now that Steve could place the voice, he could also place the scent—metal and motor oil, a little bit of ozone? Burning air? What would that be called?—and he sucked in a deep breath. “Cold,” he muttered.
Ste-Virn noticed that Saark’s fingers came up to tap against his lower abdomen, twitching in a pattern that looked like someone counting out a Fibonacci sequence, a dance of numbers against skin.
It was—it wasn’t fireworks, that was false advertising, it didn’t ever work out that way—but it was like coming home. It was warmth, a hug, a closeness that Tony had been craving but hadn’t been sure Steve had really meant.
Steve trailed off, and Tony gulped the whiskey.
“No—no, not that. I just—it doesn’t look very comfortable?”
There was so much pain and suffering around, so many dark corners here. Anger and hatred and despair lingered like smudges on plasti-shield, but underneath it, there was one shining, bright, pure note.
She knew that Fury had placed her with Steve and Clint so she could babysit them. She was…
Saark just made that
…Why were all his thoughts focused on Byu-Kyonn? His friend was happy now—he’d just spoken with him a few hours ago when he was fixing Ste-Virn’s datapad and signal—
For right now, Steve licked his lips. “I probably have to take on the watch. Is it one?”
“I bet. I got nightmares, and I didn’t even have to kill anyone,” Clint murmured.
out of style and illegal. He was given a briefing on culture, on dynamic interaction and dynamic rights, and he was
Saark let out a small sigh. “Water would be welcome.”
“Oh, Mr. Coffee Man, I will buy five. Normally they are all sold out before I come! I am so happy today! Oh, they are so warm!
Tony blinked once, and then lifted one eyebrow skeptically. “You’re just… going to let him shout at you?” he asked, and on the one hand, the voice, the tone, even the way that he kept his eyes averred—all of it showed respect. On the other hand, the question itself was almost insulting.
“I have to admit, I have researched you, and your cases. You became a Jedi Master only about seven months ago, or so, and most of your cases have not been as involved as this. Nevertheless, those cases show your level of dedication and skill, and investment. I knew that if we worked together, we could solve this issue quickly. However, I did not explain myself well, and for that I apologize.”
Motor oil, wasn’t it? Something of metal, or ozone. Strange, with an undercurrent of feline that meant he would be much more compatible with Steve than Steve had initially thought.
“I can’t sleep… at night. I lay in bed and I stare at the ceiling and wait until it’s marginally acceptable before I go for a run. I lost… someone. In the… war.”
“It’s fine,” Steve sighed. “I’m a new head alpha, and I know my authority is going to need to be proved, it won’t be automatic.”
that had been involved previously, but for the past two weeks nothing had happened. No one had shown their face.
bunk, I didn’t feel like supervising him. He’s flighty enough. Young, too—sure I’ve heard some rumors about him being more than a handful, and I didn’t want to deal with that. I guess you can take that room, then—Rogers, right?”
“I found out about Tony’s guardian, and home life, a little.”
Steve walked into the kitchen to look at the huge shelves that took up the place where the fridge had once been—shelves full of industrial, value sized cooking ingredients, like flour and cocoa powder and whatever else shit Steve could research on the internet.
“Deep space,” Ste-Virn answered back automatically. “We’ve been tracking a shipment, and we’re just trying to get that undeniable proof in order to show to the planets that the company has been violating the good faith contracts they made here on the planet.”
one.”
So. So it seemed Stark didn’t realize that this was Clint Barton, the person whom he had called Legolas and Merida and had physically carried up buildings. But that was the purpose of the googles and mask—Clint would be a piss-poor spy and operative if his face was plastered around on television and for everyone—and so Clint didn’t feel so upset about it.
Clint had a cast on.
“You had your master die, trying to save the life of your best friend—a friend who would lose his arm, and then choose to enter the Corps instead of remain as a Padawan. You needed stability,” Saark said, and while it was true, it wasn’t something Ste-Virn liked to hear laid out in cold, hard words and truths. But he had to trust that Saark was going somewhere with this, that there was a reason to this, so he held his tongue and waited.
Clint blinked at him, and then squinted. “Natasha put you up to this?”
It didn’t take him long to catch up with them—they hadn’t left Central Park, and instead had turned to follow the length of the park, walking north on the opposite side of the MET. He skidded to a stop next to Natasha, trying not to look around too obviously for Tony.
With some space between them, Barton turned. He was perhaps a few inches shorter than Steve, but it didn’t seem to matter; he seemed like a bulldog, eyes flashing and shoulders squared. A canine shifter, for sure.
(Yes, she was also seeing a therapist now. Tony had found counselors for all of them, and then another counselor, and then another, and then another, until Steve had felt comfortable enough to talk to someone. Clint had been a different issue—he was almost a bit more well-adjusted than either her or Coulson, and had been willing to talk, he just didn’t feel like he, as someone who had led to so many SHIELD agents deaths, could actually talk to a counselor from SHIELD.
It should be safe for Ste-Virn to dock. He could touch down, see if he could get close… But what if the ship took off again? It had done this previously, stopping long enough for Ste-Virn to think that they were docking, only to scramble to catch up on their ion trail as they hopped away…
But Tony was nothing but a sucker for a challenge. He was petty, he loved proving people wrong, and he had no filter when he was this sleep-deprived. “Sure,” he said, taking another deep sip and then pushing himself to his feet. “You got stuff to cook with in that kitchen?”
As he sat and tried to control his panicked breathing, he realized he was really fucked up.
“Sir, yes sir,” Steve replied, and turned on his heel.
Rumlow let out a low, deep rumble—his bear form was no joke, and would be rough for Steve to put down, especially since Rumlow was enhanced just like Steve. Not as well, not perfectly, but he didn’t feel pain and had the stamina of, well, a bear.
Despite his worry, Ste-Virn felt the corner of his mouth turn up. “But Master, you so do love giving lectures, and my job as your Padawan—even as your former Padawan—is but to give you an audience.”
Steve didn’t wait for him to finish his sentence, especially because of the clearly easy familiarity they shared and the scent of arousal that picked up in the air when Barton had seen Natasha, and Natasha had seen him. “Is the omega here? She settled in?”
Director Fury’s eye narrowed at him (well, maybe eyes—who could tell, with the eye-patch?) as he continued as if Steve hadn’t spoken, “Since we need a mix of reassuring-the-public as well as heavy hitters, I’m going to give you Rumlow, Banner, and our envoy from Asgard. You’ll also have Barton, Carter, and Romanoff.”
An incoming commlink call had him scrambling to pull it out of the scattered, messy cockpit—the result of many spent days in one place as he trailed after his target. Finally locating the comm, he clicked it on. “Hello?”
“Tony, please, I swear—”
“My master smiled. I will never forget that. He put a hand on my head and said, teasing, that I was very small for a Padawan, after all, and that we might be rescued soon in any case. I could tell he was lying.” Now, Saark’s breath caught, his voice roughened. “Well. I could tell he was lying about the rescue. He knew what his fate would be, and he placed me in the bay, and sealed it.”
Tony huffed out a deep sigh. “Yeah, well… I just, I can’t stop seeing that—those aliens. Do you know how
“Steve helping you out back there?”
Steve couldn’t blame him.
Well, now.
Tony smiled and walked back into the kitchen. It was—okay, it had hurt. It had hurt a lot. But Steve was a determined fucker, and Natasha was so awkwardly bad at actually trying to connect for real instead of as a spy, and Clint was just really easy to get along with, they were both the same kind of asshole and they
Clint continued, but Steve wasn’t focused on that, wasn’t focused on anything except Tony in his arms,
He needed to tell Tony who he really was, especially since he was finding him a therapist. How he’d manage to do so, he had no clue. But he had to figure it out.
“Acknowledge it, do you?” Jedi Master Yoda grumbled.
The corner of Tony’s lips twitched into the facsimile of a smile. “I just—we end up like this in the bathroom almost every night, for almost two months, and we might as well just do it here. Especially because you need proper sleep, not curling up on the tile floor—which is cold, too, let me just point that out.”
For a very,
After a few minutes, Rumlow glowered at the floor and said, a little bitchily but Steve could forgive that, “Yes, alpha.”
It didn’t smell bad, but it tasted strange. It was odd enough to pull Tony more out of his thoughts, grounded him more in his body and the here and now as he sipped lightly at it and debated whether he liked it or not. He’s pretty sure he tasted something like this before, and he didn’t mind it, but something was off about it. What was it? For sure not mint. Chamomile? No, not the right…
“You can fuck
Tony licked his lips. “Tony. Tony Stark.”
Ste-Virn glanced at Saark blandly. “That never seemed like a good idea before.”
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, if you… well, part of the reason I leave so fast is that I’m still working out the kinks with the armor. There’re some problems with it. I don’t exactly have a lot of resources, and I can’t exactly improve things. But I’m trying to make it better. I haven’t flown into a building again.”
“Sharon!” Steve said happily. “I expected you yesterday, but I guess debriefing got in the way?”
If there was a way to call this off, Steve would. As it was, he was clenching the table enough that he knew he was leaving grooves in it where his fingers were. “I assure, Mr. Stane, Tony has done more for us with his ideas than the military has done for the past few months. We are all very protective of Tony. He’s become very special to us.”
(Of course, Natasha also insisted that she
In fact, the only reason they hadn’t done so was because of Jedi Knight Filliph Kulsi—who was, for almost a year of Ste-Virn’s life, Ste-Virn’s own Jedi Knight Master.
Steve didn’t like the implications of how Tony was treated in his previous team.
“Would you have caf by any chance?” Saark asked hopefully.
“You sleep on your front. All the time. I’ve never seen you sleep on your side.”
Then Saark had walked into the picture, and that ‘almost impossible’ had turned into ‘impossible’ in truth.
“Mmm,” Natasha murmured. “So what are you going to…?”
bad at admitting they needed help—but then he let out a sigh. “Fine,” Steve said wearily. “If he comes around… just let him know.”
They needed to tell Tony. Hell, she needed to tell Pepper. That was what this was, after all, and why Natasha was nervous when she showed up and Pepper was running late. Normally, she knew Pepper would run a little late, and that was fine.
Stark flinched again, and dropped his eyes. “It wasn’t just me,” he muttered, but there was a quiver in his voice that gave Clint the confirmation he needed—it was something about that battle that was giving Stark nightmares and trouble. What kind of nightmares, and what trouble—remained to be seen.
“We were going to tell you yesterday. We wanted—at first, it was a safe-house, it wasn’t something we could just give away, and then it took a while to warm up, and then…”
me to sleep in the bed, alpha?” Tony replied quietly.
