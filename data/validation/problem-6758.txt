It all started with a falling building and a name on a form, but it had become a comfort and something beyond the legal definition of next of kin. Steve had become a welcome presence in his home, a friend in the spare bedroom, his head a reassuring weight on Tony's lap in the night. Sure, Tony had been more than happy to help Steve through his troubles, but there was more to it. As with everything he did, Tony knew there was an element of self-interest there too.
Steve turned his eyes back to the hardlight reflection of his own face. The cut was healing already but the translucent trail of blood was still there. He kept his gaze on the cut as the serum worked to knit the tissue, and as it did, the pain vanished. As the pain vanished, Steve's anxiety rose.
Tony waved a hand. "Bisexual is how I define myself. But some people would call themselves  pansexual. It depends on how your attraction works. And some people don't use labels at all. Ultimately it doesn't matter as long as you're happy, I guess." He gave Steve a sympathetic smile that made his heart ache. "I know you're not happy right now. Don't worry about what to call yourself." His eyes were impossibly soft. "The priority at this moment is helping you feel better."
Tony's voice sliced through his self-aggression. Steve slammed the brakes on his thoughts and swallowed hard, forcing his concentration back on the tingling sensation in the wake of Tony's fingertips.
Steve's answer was nothing more than a mumble of pleasure. Tony's smile widened. It was the first time he'd been Steve look happy in...forever.
Immediately the tall windows darkened, shutting out some of the afternoon sunlight and bringing a sense of cosiness. Tony pulled a chair from beside what Steve assumed as a writing desk. He gestured to the bed.
All Tony could think about was reaching out taking Steve's face in his hands, and planting the softest kiss in the history of kisses on his lips.
Hearts and flowers and sparkles and confetti exploded through Tony's head as his eyes slid instinctively closed.
He wasn't sure whether Tony's response was real or not. But in his head or out loud, it was beautiful.
He was soft and squishy and vulnerable the way all humans were, and in a way not dissimilar to Tony. There was a reason he had some of the best therapists in Manhattan on speed dial. While Tony had never taken a blade to his own skin, he'd done plenty of binging on booze and other dubious substances to cause himself harm. He never exactly wanted to hurt, and he especially didn't want the accompanying hangovers, but drugs and alcohol had been dual friends and foes to him for so long, he sometimes forgot how to cope without them. Or at least he did during the dark times when all he could see was tunnel vision through the neck of a bottle. Right now wasn't one of those times. He was sober, with no appointments scheduled for a few months, though the therapists' numbers always stayed in his cell.
Tony's voice sliced through Steve's panic. The sensation of Tony's hands on his arms, so strong and firm and grounding, brought Steve back to himself. That firm grip and the strength in Tony's eyes anchored him better than any pain.
"Rogers?" he asked, rubbing sleep from his eyes and a delightful string of drool from one corner of his mouth.
"Let me handle it." The words were out of Tony's mouth before he knew what he was saying. As Dr Archbold's perfect eyebrow neared her hairline, he held up his hands. "Not
Afterward they collected some of Steve's belongings. Tony made sure not to stare at the half-covered evidence of Steve's misconduct. To his credit, Steve didn't try to take any of it with him. He packed a backpack of clothing and that was all. No knickknacks. No personal items.
"I'm going to make some calls this afternoon about the next stage of your care," he said. "You know the score. If I don't, S.H.I.E.L.D will wade in, and I don't think they're the best guys to be dealing with..." He made a vague twirling gesture with one hand. Why was this so awkward? "This situation."
The couch dipped underneath the new weight. While Tony angled himself toward Steve, Steve sat ramrod straight, fingers digging into his sweatpants and eyes staring ahead, just like he had in the car.
There was a reason Tony had asked if Steve liked Italian food. The guy was clearly in need of comfort, and Tony had never been great at the whole
"You're okay, Steve," Tony went on. "You're in S.H.I.E.L.D medical. In the battle of Midtown Building Versus Captain America, you won."
Tony's mind hamster jerked back to this reality. Of course. That was how the doctors had found the injuries on Steve's leg. They'd had to peel off his ruined uniform, and there they were for all to see, injuries no doubt placed just where Steve had placed them for the very reason that no one would see them.
"I'm not going to bullshit you here, Rogers. I know this is awkward as all hell and I know you'd rather I wasn't involved, but I am and that's something we have to deal with." This inside of the car's windshield must have been riveting because not once did Steve look away from it. "I know you don't like me, but I'm here to help. And anyway, I said I would and I get the feeling Dr Archbold will hunt me down and kill me if I don't, Hippocratic Oath be damned."
By the sudden heat in his face, Steve knew his cheeks were dappling red. His mind betrayed him, skipping down dark conduits, thinking about all the guests who had stayed here, not in the guest room, but in Tony's bed. Beautiful women, scores of them, all falling at Tony's feet. Though Steve knew he probably shouldn't think that way. Modern women expected more than to be thought of as objects of affection and desire.
But no. He was just being an Able Grable, getting all hot under the collar for the first guy to show him any kindness. It wasn't fair to expect that of Tony. It wasn't respectful.
Steve's reply was soft and aching and made him look so young. And it occured to Tony then that Steve
Tony asked for nothing further, just kept giving his touch and his affection and his time. He should be asleep, deserved to be asleep, yet he was here, allowing Steve to lay his head in his lap. How could he be so good?
Something twigged inside him at that revelation. A lot of things were in the past, and the only one who was dragging them into the present was Steve himself.
He was right in the middle of the ritual when the call came. Avengers Assemble et cetera, et cetera. Steve's whole body stilled. Panic seeped in like CO2, pushing the oxygen from his lungs, his blood.
Even though he knew the answer, Tony had cocked his head to the side and grinned across the table. "Nice?"
It was obscene against the blue paleness of the artificial light in his apartment bathroom. The blood swelled into a bud, then bloomed and slipped down the concave under his cheekbone, languidly trailed down his half-shaved chin, then dropped soundlessly into the cloudy water. The bright red turned into a murky swirl, before it twisted and dissipated into oblivion.
Tony threw his empty glass at the wall inches from Steve's head where it shattered, and Steve finally rose his eyes to look his husband in the eyes. They were sunken into his face with deep, dark rings around them. His skin clung to his cheekbones, little else there at this point. Tony's usually clean shaven beard was messy and grown out. He looked like hell.
Tony answered the question Steve hadn't yet said out loud. "March 23rd was the last time you came home."
That didn't matter now. What mattered was that Tony was going to be meeting him on the roof in ten minutes. Steve straightened his tie in the mirror and grabbed his surprise off the desk before stepping onto the elevator.
"Tony, I've loved you as long as I've known you. I swear. I'm addicted to your laugh-your real laugh, not the one you use to laugh it off when someone says something nasty to you. Your smile is always on my mind, so I'm constantly trying to say something to make you use it more. Every day I've spent with you has been the best day of my life-I just didn't know you felt anything back."
"Don't worry about her. She ran off to find Clint, anyway." Bucky assured his best friend. "Now, why don't you tell me what's going on, Doll?"
”Woah woah woah, slow down. First of all, you were totally right to leave, Tony. Don’t put yourself down for any of this. It’s all my fault. I’m just surprised. I figured you were gonna tell me you accept my apology but you never want to see me again.”
Steve grimaced at the joke, but he knew that’s just how Tony dealt with things. Saying something more or apologizing would only make him feel bad, so Steve put on a neutral face and said, “I’ve missed you, too, Shellhead. I promise I’ll be here for you always, the best friend you could imagine.”
Now, I know what you must be thinking. Aren’t these two a thing? Why is Steve upset if he’s moved on? Why is Bucky not jealous that Steve is so upset.
“I’m happy. Really happy again, Stevie.” He rolled up his sleeves, and tears pricked at Steve’s eyes when he saw the light brighter than any of the candles covering the balcony.
Steve kissed his forehead again—a final goodbye—and turned off the light. Perhaps it was wishful thinking, but he was sure there was the slightest, barely noticeable glow around the now faded gray mark.
? Tony's mark wasn't even black now. It hadn't just stopped glowing; it was starting to fade in color.
Tears stung against his eyes, threatening to spill. It had been quite some time since Steve had last cried. Perhaps if he'd paid more attention to his love, he wouldn't be on the verge right then.
"Wait, did you and Tony break up?" Steve groaned as Thor walked into the kitchen and joined their conversation.
. Tony didn't need this, and he sure as hell wouldn't sit around moping. Tonight would've been the perfect night. The Avengers would all be present at the charity event hosted at the tower under Tony's name, courtesy of Nick Fury—something about keeping up appearances. What better way to display how wonderfully normal and human they were than to share information about their personal lives with the world?
"Oh, come on, Stevie. What's wrong?" Bucky pinched his best friend’s cheek as Natasha slid onto his lap.
What? It wasn't enough for him to have avoided Tony ever since his first boyfriend came back from the dead? Was it not bad enough that Tony went to bed alone each night shaken awake by nightmares of Steve leaving him, the cave, Howard, Obie, everything bad in the world? Was it not cruel enough that Tony has to sit idly by waiting for Steve to leave him and rekindle his relationship with Bucky? Not that they hadn't already gotten a head start—it wasn't like Tony didn't notice Steve clinging to Bucky's side since his return or the looks they gave each other.
“Oh God, I’m sorry. I’m awful. After leaving you and rejecting you I ask to hang out like it’s normal.” Tony rambled quickly and nervously.
Steve react to how cold and closed off Tony was acting? What when he had his perfect, charming, super soldier boyfriend back that he'd known his whole life.
That’s what Steve had grown to adore about Tony. He could be terrified watching Tony fall, nearly to his death, and not two minutes later Tony’s cracking jokes making him grin. At the end of the day he didn’t want to ride away on his bike, but it’s where they are now. Maybe, one day it would develop into more. Steve hoped so anyway. For now, he could wait.
Except, Tony hadn't realized that his actions had genuinely hurt Steve's feelings. His expectations of a jealous, overprotective Steve were not quite met.
He waited patiently for the ends of Tony's mouth to tug into a smile at the pet name, but the man didn't move. Worry spread across Steve's face until Tony opened his eyes, revealing that he had, in fact, been conscious enough to hear Steve. He just wasn't that happy to see him.
He was scared of how things once were, but he’d grown to forgiveness. Eventually, they were back to spending most of their time together, curled up on the couch, dinners together, dancing. But keep in mind, they were only friends. At least that’s what they thought. Or rather, Tony thought. Steve, on the other hand, was ecstatic that they were getting back to a relationship, but Tony didn’t know any of that yet.
Shutting his mouth wasn’t Tony’s specialty, so instead it just hung open as he searched for the words.
Steve’s hands shook as he watched Tony on stage at the press conference, more so as he got to the closing point needing addressed.
." Okay, this was getting out of hand; Tony made a mental note to learn how to kick his own ass later for the excessive pet names.
. "It's just that so many people need me, and I thought you were strong enough to handle that. But I get it now-"
, so Steve was sure to get non-alcoholic. The pair laughed and enjoyed each other’s company all night. In one moment, they got quiet; simply holding hands and smiling at each other, suddenly realizing how much they’d missed one another. Once they reached dessert, Steve had Tony sit on the edge of the balcony while he got the record playing again. Tony picked at his cake as he read the love letter.
This was a dangerous thought coming from Tony stark. Especially when in reference to his boyfriend who'd been ignoring him all day.
This was inevitable. Tony knew that from the first moment that Steve was his. Somehow he'd been lucky enough that Steve didn't see all the reasons Tony didn't deserve his love. And that was good, while it lasted. But nothing good ever did. Eventually, everyone saw Tony for what he was. And Tony knew in his heart as soon as they found out Barnes was alive that he had to hold onto Steve as long as he could. Because the minute Bucky returned, Steve would be gone.
And she held him, while all the people—well, almost all the people—who cared most about him gathered around in the space he felt most comfortable. Nat and Bruce lie on the loveseat together; Thor sat on the edge of the couch on which Tony laid with Pep, running his fingers through Tony's damp curls to comfort his friend; Clint, Happy, and Rhodey stayed in the kitchen mostly with several members of the cleaning staff, searching for every last secret bottle Tony might be hiding within the workshop.
Pepper tried to rein in the attention she’d temporarily shifted to Tony and close the conference which wasn’t too difficult considering how Steve had just stunned practically everyone. Even Tony didn’t know what to say, so he followed Steve’s lead out of the room and to the car where Happy waited patiently to drive them back to the Tower.
Bucky did remember. Tommy was Steve's first, and only other boyfriend aside from Tony. When Tommy’s friends found out about Steve, well... they weren't very pleased to say the least.
"Don't you dare say sorry." His voice was still shaking, but more assertive now. "You're not. You're just doing what you have to do, so forget it." Tony sounded weaker and weaker the longer he spoke though.
"I'm okay. W-we're okay." Steve whispered, finally shutting Tony up by pressing his lips against his boyfriend's. A weight instantly rose from Tony's chest with those words.
The crunch of broken glass under Steve's feet easily could've been mistaken for that of his heart. To his knowledge, Tony hadn't touched a bottle in four and a half years.
"You know damn well why," Steve lowered his voice. "What the hell do you think you're doing, Shellhead?"
"N- no. He doesn't even know about Tommy. Don't want him to think I- I'm weak." Steve sniffled against Bucky's chest. "B’sides. You saw him with those girls. This is prob’ly jus’ his way of breaking up with me."
Tony strode across the room swiftly feeling about as angry as he imagined Banner had to be to go green.
Steve's smooth-as-honey voice sang softly into Tony's ear as they danced. He didn't have to be loud. This moment was exclusively for Tony.
Apparently, when you leave your recovering anorexic/alcoholic husband alone for months at a time to take care of your best friend that came back from the dead resulting in divorce and rehab, he ignites more rage than jealousy. But how was Steve to know that?
Several weeks had passed since the party, all filled with heart eyes, snuggles, lunch dates on the balcony, and spending quality time together while doing the things they each enjoyed separately. Currently, they sat in Tony's workshop doing just that. Not bothering to share with Tony his plans just yet, Steve drew in his sketchbook thinking of ways to come out to the public about both his sexuality and relationship with Tony, who sat ten feet away at his desk nitpicking the details of his latest project. Steve, on the other hand, was focusing in on the details like the adorable lines forming around Tony's eyes along with the slight, smug smile as he finished up. The moment was one of simple joys and purity. In his heart, Steve knew this man would never let anyone hurt him verbally or physically and certainly not over their relationship.
“Listen Steve, I can forgive you.” Steve got that hopeful look in his eyes as his own mark started glowing a bit, hidden beneath a flannel. “But I can’t go back.” His face dropped.
Tony put a Marlboro black between his teeth and a fake smile upon his face as he unlocked the workshop and lit up.
On top of that, the worst part was the reason Steve had been ignoring him. Tony wanting to announce their relationship to the public should have been something wonderful.
Face paling at the storm of questions, Steve’s nerves started to get to him. Fortunately for him, he was perfectly fine with his rock right next to him, keeping him grounded while answering all their questions nonchalantly.
The pair enjoyed their evening together far more in solidarity than at the huge event. Neither of them particularly cared how pissed Fury would be about how this could damage their precious image.
He looked so fragile. Skin and bones. Make that two bad habits once broken. Pair them, and they become more deadly than just bad.
There were two moments that split his heart the most, though. When he came down for movie night to see everyone surrounding Bucky, smiling and laughing, looking at him with pure adoration, so easily replacing Tony, to which Tony immediately turned back around and returned to his penthouse. He suddenly wasn't up for movie night and had JARVIS inform his teammates that he wasn't feeling well before taking a long shower, smoking half a pack of cigarettes, and passing out. And later that same night when he had a particularly horrible nightmare of his father finding that he'd used some scraps of Howard's to build a robotic arm and 'beating some sense into him' before locking him in his room for what was supposed to be a weekend and turned into a month. Tony searched for Steve throughout the tower, knowing his boyfriend would hold him and make him feel safe until he fell back asleep peacefully. However, when Tony found Steve, it was in Steve's old room where Bucky had been staying, and there was an old record playing as Steve held his past lover closely. Finally, a dance with his
"Don't worry, babes. I'll be back soon. This shouldn't take long." Tony raised his glass to the women as Steve dragged him toward the bar. "Why the stern face, Cap?"
"I'm real sorry, about what happened, doll. You know I'd never hurt you on purpose... I just- Stevie really messed up and he doesn't know how to make it better. But I thought you oughtta know that he and I aren't- we..." Tony has never seen Bucky struggle so much, usually so smooth talking. "I love Stevie. But he's not mine to love anymore. I just wanted a little bit of time with him before I had to let go of my best fella for good. But he's yours. Even if I didn't wanna let him go, the way he cried when he realized he hurt you- it was awfully convincing. He loves you, Tony, so much. He just got too worked up over my feelings and some guilt 'cause he found a better fella." Was Barnes tearing up? "But I want you to know, I'll stay out of your way from now on. I didn't mean to give you so much grief. I just wanna see my Stevie happy; you're the key to that."
On the corner, there was also a record player already playing Steve's favorite song to dance with Tony to—Can't Help Falling In Love by Elvis. And Tony couldn't wipe the stupid smile off his face. He was used to over the top planning and details, but only ever on his part. Yet, Steve had gone to all this trouble to set this up for him.
At least it all worked out in the end. Tony drove his shiny, new sports car to their dinner reservations where he was meant to meet this mystery man. He skipped the gel, allowing his hair to curl up where it fell over his forehead, wearing an elegant suit and his favorite cologne. Who knows, maybe this bullshit date could actually become something.
As he pulled off his clothes and hung his still-crisp jacket in the closet, Tony shook his head. When Steve had woken, the feral terror in his eyes had unlocked some deep-seated protective instinct. As soon as Tony had clamped his hands on those glorious, trembling biceps, he'd wanted to take all Steve's pain away.
Steve didn't need Tony to help him up, but he allowed the touch. Their hands lingered together a shade longer than Tony expected them to, and he swore he heard the tiniest whimper escape Steve when their fingers finally parted.
Tony nearly blurted the question out loud, but there was no point. How could the good doctor know, considering before this incident she'd never even met Steve?
It started with a shaving accident. In theory these so-called safety razors should have been safer than the cut-throat he'd used in the past. The word safety was in the name, for goodness sake, though how five blades could be safer than one, Steve didn't know. The shave had been going well until it wasn't, and then there was a trail of bright blood running down Steve's face. His first reaction was the usual mild consternation, the abandoning of the little plastic handled thing, grabbing a towel, pressing it to his cheek. Then Steve looked,
Maybe if Steve had been mechanical or robotic, but he wasn't. While sometimes Tony wanted to check his back for the wind-up key that operated the perfect tin soldier, there wasn't one. If this incident with the building and the revelation of Steve's apparent issue had proved one thing, it was that Captain Perfect wasn't so perfect.
"In case it makes you uncomfortable, and you need to know so you can decide whether you really want me to stay, I don't just...like women. Exclusively. You should know in case it changes your mind about me staying under your roof."
Neither of them spoke. Tony lifted his arms, beckoning Steve forward. Unable to resist, not wanting to resist, Steve did as he was bidden and climbed onto the couch, resting his head on Tony's lap. The other man's hands settled on him, holding him together.
On another day, in different circumstances, Tony Stark would have been all over that comment like a bad case of crotch crickets. But this was now, and this was Steve, and Tony's heart was breaking.
"Glad you like it. It was Nonna's speciality, or so I'm told." His grin slipped a little. "I never actually knew her."
"Anytime," Tony's mouth blurted without his permission. It wasn't that he didn't want to say yes, but did he have to sound
His voice was obnoxiously loud even to his own ears. When Steve jumped right to his feet, eyes saucer-round with fright, Tony's stomach clenched more. Idiot. Some
He looked...well, like someone who'd had a building fall on his head. But someone who'd had a building fall on his head a week ago, not just a handful of hours before. Steve's face, that beautiful face, was marred and marked and purpling, and the deep gashes, which had bled so profusely when Tony had pulled Captain Stupid from the rubble, looked half-healed. But unlike a mere mortal after a catastrophic event, Steve wasn't covered in bandages and stitched together like a well-loved rag doll. The most mortal thing about the whole scene was the IV running into Steve's arm, and the fact he was wearing a hospital gown, not his uniform.
A flash of panic shot through Steve, and it must have translated into stiff muscles because Tony hushed him and passed a hand over Steve's forehead.
. Now wasn't the time though. There never would be a time, of course, but now was the worst of all the times Tony couldn't act on his feelings. Steve was hurting, deep underneath that perfect exterior, and the last thing he needed was Tony's bisexual dick poking into his problems. Steve was already a man out of time. He didn't need the open complication of 21st Century sexuality dumped in his lap too.
But then the non-regular thing happened. Tony jerked awake to the sound of Jarvis saying, "You're needed, sir." And sure enough, Steve was standing a little way off, shrouded in darkness. Even at a distance Tony could make out his trembling.
But Steve had no idea what he meant because he forgot what he'd said as reality rushed in--the whiteness of a hospital room, the cannula in his arm, the thin tubing trailing from a half-empty IV bag, the shuttered windows, the strange soft-scratch of a hospital gown--his panic erupted into an inferno.
On a night he'd lost count of, when he stepped out of the guest room and into the main living area, he didn't need the computer voice. Tony was awake and waiting.
Tony cocked his head and glanced down, his face set with a wry smile. "Thanks. Some days I believe that and some days I don't."
It wasn't the call that made Steve panic. It was the timing. Regardless, he sucked it up and stood. There was nothing to be done but force his chest to rise and fall, and go and be the leader they needed him to be.
He knew this wasn't a solution to the problem, but he hadn't figured out what the solution actually was yet. Beyond getting Tony to invent a time machine so he could go back home again, Steve wasn't sure if there
Steve glanced in, then entered under Tony's instruction. The room was just as beautiful as the rest of the place, tastefully decorated and pristine. It was a thousand miles from than anything Steve had seen before. It was a million miles more luxurious than the stuffy apartment he'd lived in with his mother in Brooklyn just fifteen years ago--
"I'm not saying it's a good thing to do," Tony went on, "not at all. It clearly isn't. But if you need to do it, to release pressure or cause pain or whatever it is--and again, as the king of poor choices, I understand--you're not to do it alone. I'll supervise, just in case anything goes wrong."
Unfortunately he wasn't, and the last thing he remembered wasn't the building coming down on his head, but the sight of Tony, riding high as Iron Man, silhouetted against the blue sky.
, Steve corrected himself. That wasn't how fellas who liked fellas were referred to in this day and age. A sliver of anxiety slipped through his mind like smoke. Steve knew so little about this new world, he didn't even know how to refer to himself.
Steve's words brought a chuckle to Tony's throat. His voice hummed against the curve of Steve's broad shoulder.
"Hmm, maybe technically," Tony said, and Steve could hear the smile in his voice, "but I can't help but feel like I'm your senior. What I meant by my smart-mouth comment was that I probably seem a lot more confident than I feel on the inside. 'Fake it til you make it' is an excellent piece of advice." Tony raked his fingers from Steve's hairline all the way back to the base of his skull. "Do you mean something more specific when you ask 'who I am?'"
After the first night on the couch, there was a second and a third. And a fourth. And more. And more. Steve hadn't meant to stop taking a blade to his thigh, but that was what happened, because it seemed disrespectful to commit such an act in Tony's home. Tony had said he would supervise, but since that first night when Steve had resisted the urge and turned to Tony instead, Steve hadn't felt the waves so strongly. They were still there, even as weeks with Tony's (admittedly excellent) therapist went by, but Steve found himself wanting something else instead, something less painful that would ground him.
To her credit, Dr Archbold didn't immediately dismiss the idea out of hand, which she probably should have after that ridiculous line.
"Yes," Tony replied, half-baffled and half-amused. Then his levity settled. "It's not something you need to declare in case someone gets offended, you know. It's not something to have to apologise for."
As they spoke, Steve's fingers pressed harder into his sweats until Tony swore he saw the fabric fraying. He reached out to lay his hands on Steve's.
me, but let me handle it. I know some excellent therapists. And psychiatrists. They can liaise with S.H.I.E.L.D, keep you in the loop. But let me organise his care." A smile tugged one side of his lips. "I am his next of kin, after all."
Tony gets called in to S.H.I.E.L.D medical to talk, not about Steve's injuries caused by the building collapse, but something much less serious, and yet much, much worse.
Steve. Tony called him Steve. Not Rogers, but Steve. New pain welled, tightening around Steve's throat like a noose. It didn't mean anything and yet it meant everything. He was a fairy for grappling onto something so small and making it mean more than it did, but he also
There was a possibility that was Tony's actual voice. There was also a possibility it was a manifestation in Steve's brain. That was, of course, if he had any brain left. There was also a possibility that he didn't, and he'd been pummeled to death by a falling building.
"Yeah. We never really saw eye to eye. In the end, I enjoyed being a disappointment to him in every way possible."
"What can I do to help you, Steve? Apart from organising all the stuff S.H.I.E.L.D want me to. What practical thing can I do?"
Steve had to work to keep his mouth shut. How could this man be so kind, so understanding? How could he be so empathetic?
"So essentially, there are no house rules," Tony said, flashing a bright smile. "However, considering the circumstances, I just want to make one thing clear." His smile disappeared and he paused, briefly pursing his lips. "Look, I'm no psychologist, and hell, I've got enough bad coping mechanisms of my own. I don't expect you to suddenly stop doing the stuff you were doing." His gaze flicked to Steve's legs for the shortest of moments. "That's for you and the shrinky-dink to figure out." He waved off Steve's inquiring look. "The therapist, I mean. But here's the deal. If you're going to break out a blade, you do it under my supervision. Understood?"
That was possibly Tony's voice again. Steve tried to shift, but his limbs were lead. The smoulder caught light, a white-hot flame twisting upward. Tony wasn't even there and he still didn't like him. Steve tried to swallow against the panic licking up his oesophagus. If only he could do the ritual. That would quench the fire right away.
That wrenched Steve's attention from the windshield. His expression cycled between horror and something softer that Tony couldn't place.
With another smile, he was gone. Steve moved his hands from his lap to crush into the edge of the mattress. It gave way like putty under his fingers. Tony was so good and kind and understanding. Guilt at all the judgement Steve had thrown his way washed over him in waves. It was never that Steve had actually looked down on him. It was because he thought so much of him.
The last words came out in a rush, and his face burned again. All Steve could do was look at his hands.
Tony twisted a little in the driver's seat, releasing himself from the safety belt. Steve's eyes remained locked forward.
Instead, he slotted his thumbs through his belt loops and shrugged. "Don't worry about it. I know, I'm pretty great."
"Mr Stark," Dr Archbold continued, her tone that soft-yet-firm medical expert one Tony hated when it was directed at himself. "There are a number of perfectly straight, perfectly spaced incisions to the inside of Mr Rogers' thigh, in various states of healing. One of them was so fresh earlier today that his uniform pantleg was stuck to it, indicating--we believe--that the most recent injury was done only a handful of hours before, as you say, an entire Midtown building came down on Mr Rogers' head." The doctor sighed, shaking her head. "If I had any doubt, I wouldn't be speaking to you right now. But we have a duty of care to Mr Rogers. We can't let this go. As his next of kin, its important that you know."
"I don't think either of us are regular 21st Century fellas," he said. "Is it making you feel better?"
Though Steve had to admit, he wasn't usually thinking about respectfulness when the urge to carve himself came upon him, and Steve found himself standing near Tony's sleeping form, waiting for the computer voice to tell him Steve needed him.
This was off-piste. It hadn't been part of the agreement. Tony said he would supervise to keep things safe. He'd never drawn up terms to say Steve had to explain himself. It was none of Tony's business. Steve was entitled to his privacy. Yet there was a yearning inside Tony that needed to know. What had made Steve go from delighted eater of carbonara to a pulled-taut spring, ready to snap? There was a physical pain in Tony's gut at the sight of Steve brought so low. He wanted,
Tony's brain hamster died right then. Or if not died, phased into a new level of reality, passed through a subspace barrier and
, that was a weird thing to think of himself as. Dr Archbold's caveat was that Tony was true to his word and would organise the necessary aftercare, and gave a stern warning that if they didn't hear from Tony or at least his people within three days, Steve would be called in to psych.
The other man didn't move, so Tony asked Jarvis to increase the lights to get a better look. Steve didn't seem to have anything in his hands, no glint of metal or curve of a blade. The knowledge calmed Tony a little, and he patted the couch beside him.
After a while, Steve was ready to go back to his own place. Even though Tony knew it was coming, knew Steve was never going to be a permanent fixture, there was still something tragic about it.
"Thanks again for everything, Tony." Steve's smile was shy, but there was a lightness around his eyes that had been entirely lacking the first time they stood at this doorway. "I don't think I can say how much I appreciate it."
It had evolved by accident, as most things do. A strange happenstance struck feeling into Steve's half-frozen bones, and so it went on. After being encased in ice and half-dead for seventy years, sometimes it was hard to feel anything but numb. As soon as something forced him to life, Steve clung to it, and the ritual began.
Steve's eyes were suddenly unbelievably bright. "Great." He leaned down and lifted the shield. "Soon."
"Pfft," Tony said, waving the compliment off. He stepped in behind Steve and crossed to the windows. "I'm doing basically nothing. Jarvis? Increase window tint by, oh, forty percent."
It was all fine. They went back to the penthouse. Steve went to bed. Tony accidently stayed up late like he did every night because
!" crashed through Tony's memory, he was doubly glad for his current sobriety. Maybe it was fate that he was clear-headed enough to help when Steve needed it. Or maybe it was just fate. Whatever the reason, it was serendipity.
Tony's kindness knew no bounds. Steve followed him into the penthouse, trying not to feel like a complete and utter burden.
Groaning as he tried not to think about dick poking and sexuality and Steve's lap, Tony slid his hands over his eyes. This wasn't what he needed to think about. What he needed to think about was a plan on how to Fix Things. Tony was an engineer. Fixing things was his speciality. Surely it wouldn't take much to fix this particular problem?
Then Steve got a whole lot more endearing. He made the tiniest move forward, stopped, then screwed his courage and leaned down to place
This was why it was better to keep people at arm's length. He'd let Bucky in and he'd lost him. He'd let Peggy in and he'd lost her too.
Steve looked impossibly small. His shoulders were hunched and rolled in so far, it took six inches from their impressive width. His head was bowed, a few locks of soft blond hair falling across his eyes, and he was staring at his hands. They were clenched so hard, the skin was translucent over his sharp bones.
"No, no," Tony said, keeping the words light, "you should totally stay. It'll be nice to have a guest actually use the guest room."
"Thank you, Tony. For everything. Really. I know this must be such an imposition. I should have asked you before I put your name down on my forms. You should have had the choice to say 'no.'"
A series of little puffs of breath drew Tony's attention away from the window. Steve's head was heavy against the headrest and his chest rose and fell a little too quickly. Not enough to be noticable unless you knew a lot about the way Steve breathed, but enough for Tony to know something wasn't quite right.
So when Tony found himself inside the threshold of his penthouse with Steve now standing on the outside, a backpack of meagre possessions slung on his back and the shield leaning against the door jamb, the grief was palpable.
The heat chased away his unconsciousness and Steve's eyes fluttered open, stinging with smoky fear. The first thing he saw through his streaming eyes was Tony, his face winged by his hands. Both here and not here.
"I'd like to take you out to dinner sometime to say thank you properly," he said. His confidence faltered. "Do you - would that be okay? Sometime?"
Tony chuckled again. "Now  when you talk like that, I feel positively teenage." He worked the pad of one thumb against Steve's temple. "I have to be honest, I never really had an issue with it. There's plenty enough in my life that I've had problems with. Thankfully I've always been good with my sexuality. In fact," he added with another chuckle, which was softer this time and somehow a little sad, "sometimes I thought I'd been made this way just to give me another way to piss my dad off."
Probably because that was an insane leap to make. Putting someone's name on a form was hugely different from actually putting your problems in their hands. Tony sighed and kicked the scuffed wheels of the hospital bed.
young. He might have been born in 1918, but the ice had hit the pause button on his life and Tony suddenly felt very old and very responsible.
Steve looked up with those liquid ocean eyes and damn but they were amazing. What was more beautiful was the fact the tsunami edge of Steve's disdain was absent from his gaze. Instead there was pliant gentleness.
The ritual worked most of the time. Except the fateful time when the team needed Steve while he was right in the middle of it. Anxiety shuddered through him as he laid down his tools, hastily shoving the towel over the top of them even though he knew no one would ever see them. As he answered the call, Steve sucked in a breath, trying to quell the panic rising inside. If he'd been able to finish, he would have been fine.
"We'll be following this up as a matter of patient safety," Dr Archbold said, "but it's not our area or speciality. It'll have to go to psych--"
After dinner, Steve insisted on washing the dishes by hand even though there was a perfectly good dishwasher present and zero expectation for Steve to do anything in reciprocation. Tony let him have at it. Why not?
Something strange happened the moment he crossed the threshold. Vulnerable Steve stayed behind and Captain America walked through the door. He thanked the medical staff and shared his easy smile. His chin stayed high, his back remained straight, and it was as if nothing had happened and there were no perfectly straight lines cut into the inside of his thigh.
What Tony suggests here is based on actual experience between myself and my husband. Not recommended by any stretch of the word.
Steve found himself sighing as Tony passed his close-cut nails through his hair, gently grazing his scalp.
They walked a little way into the penthouse, around a corner and down a small flight of glass stairs.
He guided Steve's head back into a more comfortable position and resumed his electric tingling touches.
be an asshole, and maybe he's accidently pulling a Tony and shoving people away to protect himself.'
The speed at which Steve obeyed would have been embarrassing if Tony had understood why. Thankfully the mythology that had been build around Captain America made it look like he was just a good soldier following orders. Steve perched on the edge of the bed and folded his hands in his lap, waiting.
"C'mon, doc," Tony said, spreading his hands wide, because she couldn't possibly be serious, "a whole Midtown building came down on Rogers' head. Surely that's the reason for any of his injuries?"
The drive didn't take long, but the silence stretched it into an eternity. When Tony parked up in his private underground garage, he finally turned to face his passenger. Steve stared right ahead.
Tony brings Steve home from S.H.I.E.L.D medical. Usually he's one to run from responsibility, but something feels different this time. And anyway, it's clear that Steve needs someone--and it's got to be Tony.
By the time they entered the elevator to take them to ground level, Tony could see the cracks forming. By the time they slipped inside Tony's unreasonably expensive Lotus, Steve's whole body was trembling.
Stunned didn't quite convey exactly how Steve felt. He didn't even know his jaw was hanging slack until Tony suggested he close it before it fell off.
"My dad was a hard man," Steve said. "Hard on the bottle and hard with his hands. He made it clear that I was nothing but a disappointment from the day I was born." He pulled in a sudden, shuddering sigh. "If he knew I was what he'd have termed a 'pansy,' he'd have finally lost it and beaten me to death."
The meeting ended and Tony went on his way. Or at least, he went to go on his way. Instead he ended up walking deeper into the medical facility, opening the door marked 'ROGERS,' and standing at the foot of Steve's bed.
not on his any longer. When Tony opened his eyes again, Steve was smiling another shy boy-next-door smile.
"Steve, Steve, Steve," he whispered, shoving his hands into the pockets of his slacks. "Why in the name of all that's holy didn't you tell me about this?"
He received a tight nod in response. Tony stepped away from the door, gesturing for Steve to go through with a silent "after-you" motion. After a moment, Steve complied.
As he ordered dinner and then picked through the containers, barely eating anything, Tony's chest was empty without the press of the big guy against it. He discarded his fork with a clang and planted his elbows on the table, propping his head up with his hands.
At first Steve had been awkward, hovering near the dinner table not quite knowing what to do. But the look on his face when he'd tasted Tony's family recipe carbonara made every weird second beforehand worth it.
Everything became feral. Steve grasped for the tubing but missed, half-leaping from the bed under his own clumsy momentum. His arms. There was something wrong. They were twisted and gnarled and wrong--they were on
But he was committed and the words couldn't be unsaid, and his hands were on top of Steve's, and Steve turned then, staring at Tony with those oceans of eyes.
If Tony noticed his blush, he didn't show it. Instead he reached backward, urging Steve forward with a scooping gesture.
That started it. 'It' evolved until Steve had everything he needed, not just the blade but the antiseptic wipes and the wool pads and the towel. He knew his body could fight off any infection, but it made him feel better to feel prepared. The more prepared he felt, the longer the relief lasted.
A flutter of something unknown unfurled in Steve's chest. It happened every time Tony asked him to do something, or told him to do something. What the feeling was, Steve didn't know. All he knew was that it felt...comforting. Somehow, Tony made him feel safe.
Steve's fingers twitched at the thought of a blade, and his legs trembled under the weight of the day.
That gave him pause. Where had it gone? For that brief moment as he watched the blood track the curve of his face, then drop into the water, Steve hadn't felt anything but curiosity and pain. He'd been freed of the fear gnawing at his stomach lining. He hadn't worried about how much Tony hated him, or how Steve felt about the other man, and the guilt he could never shake at being sweet on another fella. For a moment, Steve had disappeared into a microcosm, and for a few seconds he hadn't been afraid.
It was an apt description, regardless. Alive and dead at the same time was exactly how he'd been between 1945 and the moment S.H.I.E.L.D thawed him out. Alive and dead at the same time was pretty much how he'd felt in this world where nothing made sense, where he'd lost everyone he knew, and where the one person he wanted to be closest to the most kept him at arm's length at all times.
They paused just inside and Steve stared. The walls were of luxurious wood paneling offset with metal details, hung with beautiful artwork in varying styles. Nothing clashed. Everything was perfect. The only thing out of place, as always, was Steve.

moment. Dr Archbold made no sound as she sat down. Tony watched her fold her fingers together, then shifted his gaze to the tight lines between her shaped eyebrows.
When S.H.I.E.L.D medical called Tony into the clinic to speak to him in private, Tony couldn't understand why. Cap was going to be fine, they all knew that. Maybe not any more intelligent, considering he couldn't even get out of the way of an entire building coming down, but fine. The serum, blah blah, healing factor, blah. Fine, right?
The hamster in Tony's brain went into hyperdrive at that. There was no possible outcome where this conversation would be a good thing. Doctors didn't feel duty-bound to pass on information such as, 'Your next of kin has a beautiful face,' or, 'Your next of kin has an amazing, peachy ass.' Both of these statements were entirely true of Steve, and both were a million miles away from the actual words that came out of Dr Archbold's mouth.
Nat and Tony sat together eating cookie dough ice cream watching an old favorite movie on Netflix. He’d already gotten out all his anger, and it felt good to actually stand up to Steve. But now, he just needed his best friend.
When Tony fell asleep that night, he felt freer than the day he left rehab with the weight truly off his chest after a year and a half of misery.
Dressing only in clean boxers, the two found themselves under warm, silk sheets, finishing their movie and falling asleep entangled in each other's arms. Steve woke Tony with slow, sleepy—yet, extremely hot—morning sex, and Tony repaid him with a large breakfast in bed straight from Steve's favorite diner.
"I thought you were just being friendly!" Steve defended with a laugh. "I mean, you never even tried to kiss me."
"Sorry, I sort of figured by this point you must be literate. Still surprising me after three years of marriage. Those would be divorce papers. Just go ahead and sign. I already did, so once you do, I'll be out of your hair. Then, you won't have to bother with these annual trips 'home'."
She comforted him through the heartache the fight had brought back to the surface. As she played with his hair, he could ignore it. But he couldn’t ignore the dim glow coming from his wrist.
Steve, on the other hand, didn't move a muscle, frozen in his place, completely silent as he stared at his former lover slamming Tony to the floor.
"You better hope he was." Bruce mumbled as the people Steve loved most—well, not quite all of them—walked away from him absolutely disgusted.
Months passed before the two spoke again  Tony made sure they never even saw each other. Finally, a year since everything happened he finally found himself ready to talk about it. So, he called Steve and asked him to dinner.
Steve fell asleep that night with a glowing heart as Tony lay peacefully with his head in Steve's lap. Little did Steve know, many nights like this would follow.
As he walked out the front door, Steve knew he was doing the right thing. He had to do right by Tony this time.
"Let's see, go back to getting hammered with people I don't like in the slightest or ditch the skanks for the man I'm in love with. Hmm. Tough call, tough call." Steve blushed at his words. "Come on, Honey Bunches of Oats."
Sometimes you have to lose everything to find your way back to each other and finally love the right way. Not all stories have happy endings, but theirs did.
As they rested their foreheads against each other, Steve smiled and said, under his breath, "I guess, that's a yes, then?"
”I love you, too, Shellhead. Always.” Settling comfortably into the love of his life’s arms, Steve could breathe easily as a weight that had been on his chest for
Who cared about Steve anyway? His few remaining friends hadn’t given up on saving him, and what more could Tony ask for after the last year of his life?
Despite knowing in his heart that he loved Tony now more than ever, Steve had to let him go. It was the only way for Tony to be happy and healthy again. Over the last months, Steve had gradually broken him down, and now it was too late. They were too broken to be fixed.
"I don't know, Steve. Maybe the last seven months you let me think we were dating when clearly you want nothing to do with me! I mean, I thought you just wanted to take things slow, but apparently you're just too focused on your side piece to-"
Happy pulled up the footage they were referring to. Steve watched Bucky shove Tony down, quick to pin him and get a hand around his throat. His mouth went dry as he watched himself stand completely still on the screen.
Tony pressed a kiss to Steve's forehead. "We done for the night, Stud?" he asked, wondering if they'd bother returning to the party.
He looked absolutely stunning as he walked out of the elevator with a blonde in a tight, red dress on his arm--wait a minute. Why the hell was there a blonde chick in a tight, red dress on Steve's arm. Tony couldn't take his eyes off the pair as they took a seat at the bar. She threw her head back laughing at some cheesy joke Steve should've been whispering in Tony's ear.
Tony finally looked him in the eyes and grinned. "You're telling me I asked you out, proceeded to go out with you for half a year, and you didn't even know I liked you?"
"Mr. America, I am shocked that you would make a mockery of our beloved leader's disability," Tony dramatically pretended to be offended, but couldn't help the smile that creeped through.
As the bath water grew cold, Tony quickly stood and found Steve the softest towels he kept in the room, drying his boyfriend as if he were a small child rather than a five-inches-taller-than-him, absolutely ripped, beautiful man. But, Tony knew better than anyone that Steve could be the biggest baby in the world when he wanted to be.
"You." Tony scoffed at this response. "All I want is you. I swear. I- I'll get better. I'll be around more. Tony, I promise. I want you. I
Of course, Tony understood that Bucky wasn't Bucky in that moment, by any means. He was a soldier, tortured and programmed into obedience and combat. One wrong move was all it took for him to feel threatened and slip into that role.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" a deep voice shouted across the room. Steve looked up from his sketchbook in confusion.
, but Tony still felt uneasy as Barnes entered his safe space yet again. Pepper sat up almost shielding Tony, and Thor wrapped his arms around him protectively.
"Unbelievable," Tony stormed out of the elevator, heading straight for the bar and lighting a cigarette.
"I just- I don't want anyone to think less of Captain America because he likes boy." Steve said in a meek, little voice that would've suited a small, scared boy in an alley far better than
Of course, it was too good to be true. Anger bubbled up and boiled over through Tony’s mouth when he saw him. Steve
“Alright, hey. Good job guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day… You ever tried Shawarma? There’s this Shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is but I wanna try it.”
"Oh, ya know. Just checking out my boyfriend's date." Tony said, pressing his lips together as thin as they could possibly be.
"Wait," he said gently, taking Tony's hand rather than his arm this time. "I promise you, Tony Stark-Rogers, I love you as I always have." The glow around his mark was growing slowly as he spoke. "I am so sorry I've hurt you like this, my love. It was never my intention." Tony's was too, only much more quickly. This was Steve's chance.
Being ignored by his Stevie all day had been miserable, so Tony needed to get him all riled up to get all the attention he desired.
"Stevie, I was gone. You're the love of my life. And I was the love of yours. But you have a new life now. You're not the same scrawny kid from Brooklyn that danced with me when the curtains were closed so the neighbors wouldn't see. You're different now. I'm different. We're different. Do I wish it wasn't like this? Of course. Would I do anything to have you back? Stevie, you know I would in a heartbeat. But, that man down there loves you more than he could ever love himself, no matter what folks say about his ego. And you love him just the same. You two deserve to be happy, so I'm gonna need you to dry it up, Darlin' so we can figure out how you're gonna make this right."
At least they were teammates. At least they always helped each other out when needed. Steve could live with that much. Though, Tony not wanting Steve to die doesn’t necessarily mean he likes him, but it was enough, for now.
"Tony, you don't have to put in a two weeks notice for the Avengers. It's not like a real job." Steve chuckled lightly, assuming this was a joke and Tony had played it out very heavy to make it seem real. "Nice touch with the letters from Pepper and Queens. Like you wouldn't answer them."
As much as Steve wanted Tony to change his mind, he knew this was all in the best interest of the love of his life. So, he kissed Tony's forehead, lifted him up, and carried him back to bed. Then, he asked FRIDAY to order a small meal from Tony's favorite local diner where they'd eaten dinner the night they moved in. After returning from getting Tony a glass of water, his soulmate was already half asleep. He quickly wrote out a note.
Giving a nod and bolting for his bedroom door, he tried to quickly formulate a speech to give his lovely, devastated boyfriend about how magnificent Steve was and how sorry Tony was. Choked sobbing stopped him dead in his tracks, slowing to a halt in the doorway.
"What do you want?" He whispered so quietly and raspy Steve wasn't even sure he heard him, but the last two times made it clear that he needed to answer Tony's question.
No matter, one good hulk yell later, and Tony was conscious and joking like always. “Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
Steve of course was absolutely shocked but knew not to expect anything. The two sat in awkwardly over Thai takeout for several minutes before Tony final broke the silence.
"Well, yesterday Tony said he wanted to announce our relationship at the event tonight. But- but I'm just not ready, Buck. I mean, you- you remember what happened when people found out about Tommy."
Without acknowledging the man he loved, Tony wrapped his arms around the women on either side of him, pulling them closer. That oughtta make Stevie jealous.
"Hey," Bucky ran his cool, metal hand through Tony's curling hair. "No need to get so worked up, Doll. Just go on up to yer room and make Stevie feel better. Talk to him. Make him see that things're different now. And make sure he knows you were just trying to get his attention with those ladies."
On the floor, a few feet from the workshop door, lie Tony, miserable, half conscience, and breathing heavy. Steve rushed to his side as soon as he caught a glimpse of his small body curled up.
Steve couldn't even finish before Tony was pulling him to his feet and kissing him passionately. Steve's hands grabbed the sides of his face and Tony wrapped his own around his boyfriend—now fiancé's—wrists, keeping them there.
Giving up on getting his attention in a somewhat nice way, Steve pushed his way past some girls in mini skirts trying to grind against the man he loves.
?" Tony shouted back as the elevator carried them to the main living room which was restricted from the public this evening. "I don't even know what you want from me anymore. I try so hard, but no. You just have to go find some slut to bring with you to
Guilt filled Tony completely as Bucky told him about Tommy. His heart sank in his chest at the realization of why Steve hadn't wanted to announce their relationship to the public. He was scared.
And then, it happened. A matter of seconds, and Tony was pinned to the ground trying his damnedest to pull the metal fingers from their death grip—literally—around his neck.
So Tony wasted no time dropping his robe and slipping into the warm water behind his lover, wrapping his arm around Steve and feeding him a mouthful of noodles. He would never understand how much Steve truly appreciated this.
"What about me?" He pushed her away from him, standing to meet the eyes of everyone around him. "I didn't do anything."
Barnes running off was to be expected. But, Steve. Tony knew their love was over even if they hadn't explicitly said it yet, but he'd hoped Steve had cared enough to some degree that he'd make sure Tony was okay before chasing after Barnes.
“I just- I don’t like it when people say bad things about you.” Steve’s voice was far more sheepish than the
Feeling like he was on autopilot, Tony unwrapped himself from Thor's arms and crossed the room to wrap his own around Barnes. "Thank you. I know he's the love of your life," he heard himself say.
"Vacation, and no. Only most days." Steve said smugly. "Really, Nat. I don't need the false hope. Tony just sees me as a friend."
"Oh, don't pretend to give a shit. You know, you can drop the somber face and concerned act. I won't tell anyone the Star Spangled Prick isn't all he's cracked up to be."
It felt like old times, like falling in love, and Tony could no longer ignore the mark glowing brighter each day.
"You know how Tony is, Steve. It's all an act." Nat's statement became less reassuring as Tony stuck his tongue down some girl's throat whose name he probably couldn't even remember.
"Right, and he didn't buy you flowers or take you for candlelit dinners every night on your honeymoon either."
Rhodey retracted his arm from its place around Pepper's shoulders and stepped as close as he could get to Steve. And then, he said the two worst words Steve could've heard in that moment.
As he was bombarded with questions on the topic of his husband—ex-husband—Tony couldn’t find one good thing to say. So, he just told the truth.
It was one thing to cheat on Tony, but to bring her to the event he was hosting? Now, that had Tony absolutely fuming.
Hours and hours of crying to the point that Steve felt like his body had run out of tears, and he was just lying on the floor sobbing, a framed image of he and Tony clutched to his chest. It was from a lovely photo shoot they'd done when announcing their relationship.
“Every last one of you acts like you know who Tony is. Do you know he’s the kind of man to lay down his life for his friends, the kind to do everything in his power to make you smile, to make you laugh on your worst days? He’s the kind of man who can help you relax when you’re more tense than you’ve ever been, or help you sleep when you’re terribly restless. He will dry your tears no matter who caused them. So yes, I know what kind of man Tony Stark is. And he’s not the arrogant, party-hard playboy you make him out to be. He’s a man who is so easy and lovely to fall in love with. Now, if you will excuse us. We’re through answering questions about our personal lives.”
Hi! This chapter is up as a birthday present to...myself(?). Please leave a comment! It makes my day and motivates me to write the next chapter!
Snapping out of it, Tony strode back out of the room and into the elevator. When the former-playboy stepped out, he was met with 4 shocked, familiar faces.
An hour later, the 4 were sat around in a cleared out Italian restaurant in downtown Manhattan. While they waited for food, Peter decided to ask one of the questions that had been weighing on his mind.
“Pity.” Ross’ expression was anything but pitiful. Again he walked towards the metal table and picked up a bucket of water and a thick cloth. He called one of his men over. They came forward and slammed the crown of Peter’s head into the chair. The mutant winced as pain shot through his skull. Fabric came down over his mouth and nose.
“Wow.” Peter said when he opened the door to the room. Steve and Natasha were sat opposite each other. Natasha had a notebook open and had a set of pencils and a charcoal art set laid out in front of her. She was staring blankly at the page of her book, seemingly searching her mind for inspiration. Steve had brought Peter’s art kit down and spread its contents across one half of the table.
“No, Mr Stark, I just think he should go to jail for what he did, not be killed. You’d just be stooping to his level.” Peter explained himself, his big brown eyes wide and pleading.
“It’s okay, Petey, we’ve got you.” Tony cradled Peter close to his chest, ”Nothings gonna hurt you, not while I’m around. Just breathe, kiddo, just breathe." Steve moved in to join the hug.
Wilson put his hand on Peter’s shouder, “We’re here to help you. We’re all here for you to cry on and talk to. I know that doesn’t fix everything. I know that you miss her. I know that it doesn’t feel like the hurt will pass but, Peter, it will. You will get through this. You’ll get through it and you’ll be okay. We love you, kid. We goddamn love you.”
“Erm… I like to paint the things and people I love. Sometimes, I listen to music and paint how it makes me feel. That probably doesn’t make sense.”
The man marched back to the room of cells and carelessly threw Peter back into his. He quickly left the cell, leaving Peter a shaking, bloody and sobbing mess. The other superheroes looked over at him, distress evident in their features.
The noise became deafening. The smell made his head ache. The lights burned his  progressively sensitive eyes. The feel of the chair on his skin was more and more unendurable. The clothes on his back felt rough and uncomfortable. It was all too much. He shut his eyes tight and wished he could lift his hands to cover his ears. The teen felt a warm liquid trickle down from his ears and nose. Blood and tears stained his face.
Ross repeated this on every finger of both hands. They were all loose from the nail bed. Peter knew he couldn’t tell Ross the answer to his question but the sensation in his fingers was agonising. The pliers were picked up. Another sob was choked back. Thaddeus Ross used them to rip each fingernail fully off resulting in Peter’s hands becoming a bloody mess. Tears ran down his face and he clenched his jaw. He had to get through this. He had to.
“Pete? Peter, listen to me.” Tony pleaded. Peter’s eyes flicked towards him before he reached down and yanked the IV out of his arm, the cannula out of his nose and the tube out his chest. That was a mistake. When he looked down, blood was coming out of the hole in torso the tube had left behind, but he wasn’t focused enough to care. Steve and Tony both tried to hold Peter down so the doctors could reinsert the tubes. The teenager ducked past their arms before leaping onto the ceiling. He slid into the vents before anyone could stop him.
"Just a little vacation from your unlawful spider-themed hobby." Peter's eyes widened, how had they found out? A look of realisation dawned on Clint's worn features
This chapter contains torture so if that makes your uncomfortable please skip to the next chapter! ⚠️
“Hey, Pete, come sit here.” Steve smiled brightly and patted the seat next to him. The teen hopped up onto the stool and as Natasha looked up at the pair her eyes seemed to brighten, and she picked up her pencil and began sketching something.
After being put back in his own cell, Peter had been spending most of his time just trying to stay warm and finding positions that didn’t jostle his injuries. He was sure he had fluid in his lungs.
“Would you care to explain why on Earth there is currently a newly-turned 15 year old, who has never hurt a soul, in your prison?!”
After what seemed like hours, the room began to quieten, the lights dimmed and the smell dissipated. Ross re-entered.
Hey guys! i am so sorry i haven’t updated this story in so long. i haven’t had much inspiration and now i’m back to school and it’s gonna be a busy year. i will keep writing this story but chapters will be few and far between. hopefully i’ll get my act together soon and start updating regularly.
Exactly 6 minutes and 37 seconds later, Doctor Helen Cho appeared in the doorway. She turned calmly to the doctor, Dr Steward, handling Peter and asked,
Peter climbed out of the wheelchair and steadied himself in the shower with the help of his adhesive powers. He showered for a good 15 minutes. It felt good to be properly clean. When he had taken showers in the raft he had to be so careful because of his injuries, so even after showers he felt dirty.
The bathroom door had unlocked with a click and Tony appeared in the doorway. Steve stood quickly. The Stark had thrown himself at Steve, wrapping his arms around the super soldiers waist. Tony’s body had shook under Steve’s hold, his body wracked with emotion.
As the words came out of Steve’s mouth, Peter began to groan as his eyes opened, adjusting to the light.
Tony thought for a minute, “Okay, we’ll just explain that now, before the movie, to the team. They’ll understand. Me and Steve will talk to Peter tomorrow morning. He doesn’t need anything to worry about tonight.” Natasha nodded and they walked over to the rest of the group.
Tony cut him off, “I’ve been thinking about it since we found May. He can’t go into care and S.H.I.E.LD know he was powers so they’ll be trying to recruit him in no time. Peter needs support that only we can give him now.”
Peter Parker's day had been totally normal. Maybe even a little better than usual. Flash had been ill, so he and Ned had been able to walk the halls without fear of being slammed into a locker at every turn. He had aced his Spanish test. Harley Keener had looked his way and smiled, making Peter feel all warm inside. Nothing major had happened during patrol and someone had bought him a burrito for his efforts. Everything was normal. Until it wasn't.
The rest of the journey home was in silence, the only sounds were the beeping of Peter’s heart monitor and the hum of the engine.
"What do you think!? The kid's in the fucking Raft and it's my fault. I should have been more careful." He choked back a sob and turned away from the red-haired woman. She put a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“Sorry to interrupt, Boss, but Mr Parker seems to be in distress.” F.R.I.D.A.Y informed the pair. Tony leapt up off the couch and into the waiting elevator, Steve close on his heels. The elevator dinged as they arrived at the medbay floor. The last living Stark rushed into Peter’s room to see the boy in question writhing in his sleep. Tears were running down his face and small whimpers were escaping his mouth.
"He'll be here any minute." His voice was full of worry and anxiety, "I figure I need all the help I can get to make sure Peter is safe as soon as possible."
The doctor nodded, “This is Peter Parker, age 15, male. Went into cardiac arrest. Signs of malnourishment. Suspected pneumonia and Pulmonary Edema.”
“Peter, when we got there it was too late...” Steve went round the other side of Peter’s bed and took his hand, “It will be okay. You have us, Pete, you are not alone.”
Clint was mad. He wouldn’t just stand idly by whilst a kid was given nothing to eat. The boy had already missed them come in for breakfast because he was out with Ross. Clint snarled and he heard the familiar hum of Wanda’s powers being stimulated followed by a hiss of pain. At the same time they both picked up their trays and threw them at the glass wall in from of them. Scott and Sam quickly followed their lead.
Helen thought about it for a minute, “Keep him in a wheelchair. His stab wounds are still healing up. Don’t eat to much, Mr Parker, or you’ll throw it all up. I’ll be on hand if I’m needed. Just be smart, and it should be fine.” Helen smiles at Peter,
Thanks sooo much for reading. The next ones gonna be rough, I’m not going to lie to you, it’s gonna be hard to write but hopefully it will be done soon!
“Mhm.” Peter nodded. Scott patted Peter’s shoulder affectionately as he walked over to a seat next to Wanda.
“Ah, you know, just checking in. Peter’s been asking your pal Clint Barton if he thinks your coming to save him.” Tony’s eyes turned watery for a split second before his facade of strength returned.
Wanda stood up, lowered herself to be level with the teenage superhero, took his head in her hands and said, “Будь сильним, дитячий павук”
“I, uh, I didn’t sleep...” Tony had looked down at his feet, sheepishly, “But I’m okay, Steve, really.” Steve came and sat on the stool next to Tony.
Peter nodded, “Please, Mr Stark?” The kid had unleashed his greatest weapon. His puppy dog eyes. How could Tony say no to that face.
Clint pulled Peter into his side. “You got this kiddo. You just flash ‘em those puppy dog eyes, and you’ll be fine. I promise.”
“Oh, Tony...” Steve slid down the door, leaning his back against it. On the other side, Tony was in the same position. “We’ll save him, Tony, we will. And then we can take turns beating the shit out of Ross.” Tony let out a little snort at that, and Steve’s heart melted. He just wanted Tony to be happy forever.
“We gotta go, Pete.” Tony called to him from the elevator. After one last hug from Steve: Peter, Natasha, Sam and Tony bundled into the lift and began their journey.
Ross broke Peter’s fingers again, and then let the spider-themed hero go, smirking to himself. Peter knew he was planning something but just wanted to leave the room that darkened his daytimes and haunted his nightmares. Later in the day he had figured out what Ross had been scheming. A cake came in alongside his prison families dinners. When it was placed in his cell, Peter had eyed it suspiciously.
Officially, the worst birthday he’d ever had. Not terrible though. Wanda had attempted to use her magic to send the warmth of a hug to him, resulting in her writhing in pain on the floor for a solid minute but she quickly got over it. He’d only been with Ross for half an hour and his fingers were healing in the correct place
Tony, Steve, Vision, Rhodes and Natasha sat in a meeting room at the compound. A layer of dust covered the table. It was the first time it had been used since Ross had came to propose the accords to the Avengers.
“Okay. I won’t kill him, Pete.... God, you’re such a good kid.” Tony smiled at the boy he didn’t think could possibly be more pure.
“Tony, wake up! Today’s the day!” Steve shook Tony’s shoulder gently. Tony opened his eyes and practically leaped out of bed. He got dressed and ate breakfast with his morning coffee. Today they would appeal their revised version of the accords to the UN. If all went well, Peter would be out of the Raft in a matter of days. If it didn’t... nobody wanted to think about that.
“Is this true, Mr President?” King T’Challa asked. All the leaders knew the American government was in charge of the Raft prison.
“You said you needed my help. What happened?” Rogers walked towards Tony, tentatively putting a hand on his shoulder when he saw Tony’s face fall significantly.
The Quinjet landed lightly on the tarmac. The black panels reflected the sun. The door opened and the stairs slid down.
“Oh no, not another one. Pineapple on pizza, Peter, really?” Sam shook his head in false disappointment. Peter grinned, sheepishly.
“Boss would like me to let you know that the pizzas are here.” F.R.I.D.A.Y informed the spider-themed teen.
Peter couldn’t tell if Ross was testing his metabolism or if this was to help torture the answers out of him.  He looked over at his new found friends, all of them with an angry fire burning in their eyes. They all were willing to starve themselves for him. Each one of them was already struggling yet didn’t think twice about standing up for him. Not one of them deserved to be in here. Sure, they had sided with the wrong person but they had done it because it’s what they believed in. Knowing the consequences, they still fought alongside and against their friends for their right to use their own morals rather then a governments. Peter felt inspired by these people who had showed him nothing but comfort since he arrived.
Tony Stark sat in the tower's common room, reminiscing on how things used to be. The memories of Steve getting confused at anything remotely technological, Clint and Sam arguing over what film they were going to watch, Natasha and Rhodes' intense conversations about government officials, were all still fresh in his mind yet far away.
Hey I am sooooo sorry this took so long to be updated. I was back at school and a bit deflated and it’s not really an excuse but I just didn’t have the motivation to put my head down and write this chapter.
"What's your name?" She asked, using a tone of voice intended to keep him calm. The enhanced teen was about to answer when the elevator dinged and out stepped Thaddeus Ross.
Behind Ross, two muscled guards came in dragging two sleeping men, and from their clothing, Peter could make out they were also inmates.
Also I just want to draw attention to the fact I have changed when Peter’s birthday is on the 3rd chapter.
“You have heightened senses, right? We read yours and Mr Stark’s messages. He asked a few times if you had experienced a sensory overload. You should be more careful about what you write on your phone, kid.” Peter expected him to go back over to the table but Ross didn’t. Instead, he left the room. Followed by his men.
"Shit." He muttered, as he realised he was in a cell. He could hear whispering and felt multiple pairs of eyes on him.
"Do you think Mr Stark will come and help me get out of here?" He asked, hope glimmering in his big round coffee-coloured eyes. Clint looked around at his fellow avengers before reconnecting with Peter's pleading gaze.
A single tear rolled down Clint Barton’s cheeks as he watched the tortured teenager that reminded him so much of his own kids.
Clint scooped the frail child up into his strong arms and slid out of the vents into the art room below.
Special thanks to my best friend Damien for their knowledge of first aid and pneumonia. Very helpful.
“Also, Helen said you can start going out as Spider-Man as soon as you want to.” That got his full attention.
“Oh. Sorry...” Peter climbed down the wall. He had looked down at his injury-littered self and teared up when he, for the first time, really took in the word that Ross had seared onto his battered body. Now he would never be able to forget his time at the raft, even if he did get out. The word on his arm made him feel worthless. Scott saw Peter start to sniffle and sighed. The kid had been through too much in his short life. Scott just wanted to protect the boy from the demon of a man who was hurting him.
“Okay, I think us four should go out somewhere nice to eat. I’ll call ahead and make sure we aren’t going to be bothered by anyone. We need to talk about a few things and we also need to eat so let’s hit two birds with one stone.” Tony said, becoming serious.
Peter cuddled up close to Wanda for the first time with no wall between them. She put an arm around his shoulders. Vision held her other hand. He patted Clint on the shoulder. Clint smiled up at Vision while he nudged Natasha playfully.  Natasha shoved him in return and twisted so her legs were resting on Clint’s and her back was in Sam’s bean bag. Sam grinned down at her and pulled Scott’s bean bag closer to his. Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder and looked around at his team. They were all from different backgrounds, had been through different things and yet here they were, stronger than ever, in his opinion. They had been torn away from each other but none of that mattered because they were all together again, holding each other close.
I hope you're all staying safe. Have you drunk enough water today? I hope you have. Anyway, leave me a comment they make me so happy and give me the motivation to write the next chapter.
"I cannot tell as Mr Parker is not currently wearing his watch, but before taking it off, his heart rate spiked and it appears the watch was forcefully removed."
Tony looked up and saw Peter, “Oh, Pete, there you are. Come and get some pizza. I wasn’t sure what kind you liked but, between all of us, I think we have every type.”
“Hey, Pete, it’s Tony and Steve. Not Wanda.” Tony said slowly, taking Peter’s hand. The teenager looked around him, taking in his surroundings.
"Stay here..." May whispered. She got up and walked towards the door, "I'm coming! Who is it?" She yelled at the person on the other side of the door.
“If that’s what you want, of course. But first. Chos gonna come and check up on you now that your awake.”
Peter could tell Ross was getting increasingly exasperated. The Secretary of State had taken to just pounding Peter with his fists and yelling his frustrations away. Today was no different. When the branding had failed to pry answers out of the youth, Ross had stormed over to a metal table and grabbed a meat cleaver. Peter had yelped in fear as the furious man charged towards him. The cleaver was stabbed into Peter’s exposed thigh, cracking his femur in the process. Peter’s screaming had turned to weeping as his blood quickly covered the chair and himself.
“Mhm.” The spider-teen mumbled, “Whatever you say.” The next thing Clint heard was light snoring. Clint chuckled and they stayed like that until Peter woke up, (Clint had been warned not to pick Peter up in his sleep).
“Well, yeah. I can’t do it all on my own. And, well, Steve, I...I really like you, y’know...” Tony trailed off. A look of subtle joy took over Steve’s face.
“Boss, incoming video call from Thaddeus Ross.” FRIDAY’s voice broke the silence. Tony’s eyes narrowed.
“What?! What is it?!” Wanda questioned, her voice dripping with concern. Scott didn’t say anything, just sat Peter up against the wall, showing his chest and arm. The heroes grimaced as they all saw what Ross had marked on Peter’s flesh.
When he wasn’t thinking about his friends and family or learning Ukrainian with Wanda, he was muttering scientific equations and historic dates under his breath. When...If he got out, he wanted to be still at the top of his game, acing his tests.
“W-When we were in th-the raft, the only thing I… one of the only things I thought about was coming h-home to May. I… I didn’t even get to say goodbye to her. She was my only family left. I know I have you guys, and Mr Stark and Captain Rogers but… May’d always been there for me and… I just don’t know how to… how to even function without her.” Peter held his head in his hands.
Clint rushed forward, thoughts flying through his mind at a mile a minute. He took a deep breath to steady himself and then did what he had been trained to do on every first aid day at shield. He started CPR, desperate to save this poor child.
Clint nodded before pulling himself up into the inlet. The archer navigated his way towards Peter. He knew the way since jumping out at Steve was always fun as, unlike Natasha, he never saw it coming. One time, Clint had  decided to scare Steve as he was walking to his canvas with a bucket of green paint. Barton chuckled to himself as he remembered the sight of Steve covered from head to toe.
Fighting him in Germany and then Siberia had broke Steve’s heart. He never wanted to even argue with him again. Tony’s coffee brown eyes met his. The look of trust that Steve had known so well was gone, replaced with one of vulnerability and stress.
For what seemed like the millionth time, the elevator dinged, and he didn’t even put up a fight when he was dragged out of his cell towards the bane of Peter’s existence. Thaddeus Ross.
“Wait! Mr Stark, you can’t kill him. It’s wrong!” Peter exclaimed. Tony looked at Peter and tilted his head.
The older genius, grinning from ear to ear and eyes glistening with happy tears, spoke to F.R.I.D.A.Y as he entered the hall.
“What?! You can’t call her ‘Nat’ and me ‘Mr Stark’! One, I’ve known you longer and, two, it makes me feel old!”
"C-Can you c-call an amb-ambulance for h-her?" He stammered out. They responded by getting behind him and pushing him down on the floor, cuffing his wrists behind his back. He groaned loudly.
And then Clint heard a spluttering cough. And then breathing. Small and shaky. But Peter was breathing.
“Pete... It’s not true. You’re not owned by anyone. Ross is sick in the head. You’re not a freak, either. You got these powers and you chose to use them for good. You’re a hero.” The older hero told Peter, sincerely. The teen had given a small smile and shuffled over to embrace Scott.
Wanda was sitting in her room watching old Disney movies when Peter’s shaking form appeared in her doorway.
All the experienced heroes had looked at the baby-faced mutant and knew that he was the best of them and always would be.
“Yes, of course. So the investigation on the raft begins tonight. We’ll go at the same time and hopefully, we’ll get Peter and catch Ross doing something he shouldn’t be so we can back up killing him as soon as we see him.”
Scott and Sam were helping Peter onto one of the central sofas. Wanda sat next to him with Vision next to her. Tony and Steve sat on Peter’s other side. Scott and Sam flopped down on a pile of bean bags. Clint and Natasha sat on the floor and leaned on the couches.
A week and 3 days passed. Every day without fail Peter had been pulled from his cell and brought to Room 86. Ross had wanted to test his healing factor. He had wanted to test how fast his flesh healed and how fast his bones healed. Peter had had to pull the knife out of his gut himself with broken fingers and arms, all whilst screaming and cursing in Ukrainian.
After taking a picture of the feline, Steve showed Peter some of the more specific techniques that could come in handy for painting Bean. After an hour and a half, the pair had finished the basic outline of Beans body and added some colour. When Peter’s wrist began tiring Steve had recommended that they leave it at that for today and continue in the near future. When they were packing up, Tony entered the room to ask what they wanted for dinner.
Peter was getting sick. Really sick. He could feel his lungs giving out. The lack of food had inhibited his healing factor. Bruises that would have healed in minutes before were still littering his body days later. The, now regular, water-boarding was making him feel like he had before he was bitten by that damned spider. Back when he was just a sickly, asthmatic orphan. No matter how bad it got, he was determined to not let his struggle show. Peter had realised that the facade of strength wasn’t to convince others, it was to convince himself. To convince himself he wasn’t tearing at the seams. To convince himself he could get through this. His body was giving up but the super powered teens spirit wouldn’t break. The pain, the helplessness, the fear; it would not make him answer Ross’ questions.
“We’ve already sent the documents ahead of time so it’ll just be them asking us questions.” Tony explained to Natasha, Rhodes and Vision. Steve wouldn’t be able to come with them as much as he wanted too; even him waiting on the quinjet would be risky.
Peter’s eyes flew open, pulling his hand away from Tony’s. He relaxed slightly as he recognised his surroundings but was clearly still clearly on high alert.
“He’s right, bambino. You don’t have to worry about going into care or anything like that if you want to stay here. With me. And with Steve. All the avengers, too. How does that sound, kiddo?” Peter looked up at Tony like he was talking an alien language.
Hope this was good haha sorry for any medical stuff that was wrong. I tried. Watched a whole long video on ambulance handover. My search history looks a little concerning at this point. Especially if you scroll back to ‘water boarding... detailing...medieval torture techniques...’
"Hey Tony. Nat." Steve's voice filled Tony's ears and his heart skipped a beat. There he was. The lone blonde haired man stepped out towards them. His blue eyes met Tony’s.
"Sorry for webbing you, too." Parker said, shyly. His thoughts were wondering. He was worried about Aunt May.
“Last chance, Peter. It doesn’t have to go this way.” Peter just stared angrily back. “Oh well, you can’t say I didn’t give you a chance to be straight with me.”
“I tried to contact his aunt but she hasn’t responded. I don’t know why.” Tony told the super soldier.
When they arrived, a medical ventilator was attached to Peter’s mouth and nose. He was hooked up to a heart monitor and an IV.
“See, me and Wanda aren’t the only ones!” Steve said, whilst he sat in the sat on Peters right. Tony lowered himself into the chair on Peter’s left.
Peter couldn’t imagine inflicting his powers on someone else. Sure, he was strong and...sticky, but these powers came with a price. The sensory overloads, the development of a hero complex and the inability to live a normal life. He didn’t regret going on that trip to Oscorp but he would never wish his abilities on someone else.
As if on cue, Helen Cho entered the room. She looked stunned, “I can’t believe you’re awake already. And sitting up. Your healing factors double the rate of Rogers’. I wonder if it’s to do with your age. Anyway, you’re healing up nicely. Your vitals are normal.”
The elevator dinged. 4 men stepped out holding trays of food. They walked towards Wanda, Scott, Sam and Clint and the glass lifted a few centimetres for the tray to be pushed through. One of the 4 men walked towards Peter’s cell, holding just a cup of water. It was passed to Peter, who looked at Wanda’s tray of mysterious meat and soup, and wondered why he wasn’t getting what all the rest seemed to have.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please comment feedback or anything really. I love reading your comments and they basically fuel my writing!
“Fri, locate Peter and tell Barton we need his help.” Tony said, worry and stress making his voice wobble.
“I can’t, alright, I can’t!” Before Tony could stop them, tears were running down his face. He felt Steve’s warm embrace overtake him. The super-soldier had never seen the billionaire so upset. It hurt to see him so...broken. He had never imagined Tony as the fatherly type, but here it was, clear as day. It looked good on him. All the articles that said he was a heartless playboy didn’t know the real Tony. The Tony that Steve knew and adored.
“Night, kid. Love you too.” Tony left the room before he could see Peter’s mixture of confusion, embarrassment and happiness.
“Okay, Pete, what do you want to wear?” Steve pulled some T-shirt’s out of the draw next to Peter’s bed. Peter glanced down at his arms, littered with scars, bruises and, on his left wrist, the word ‘freak’.
Reaching out, Tony opened his hand as if to allow Steve inspection. In the center of his palm, the light pulsed but it quieted and then Steve saw the old wound from his torture. With tears forming, Steve looked up to Tony’s chest to see the wound there, beyond the glimmer of light in his chest. “No,” Steve whispered and then the tears flowed, and he wept.
"Did you know that my father's business partner, Stane, transported slaves to the North even during the very start of the war to work in the factories to power the war machine? He smuggled them." Tony says and sips his wine. He hasn't tasted any of the lavish meal. "I fought with Stane about it. He didn't like my position."
He reached for one of the containers. The coven provided the pints of blood mainly as a front just in case they were searched. Vampires conclaves without a refrigerator filled with animal blood were suspected of hunting humans. Bloodletting was not allowed. What the fuck did humans think the mating was for in the first place? It wasn’t like a vampire could fucking come! Well, not in the traditional sense, considering they were undead and therefore couldn’t give life via a donation of sperm or eggs. The mating meant something different, something wholly encompassing, something about blood. It was the elixir, the climax, the orgasm for vampires especially with a mate. Most especially. He licked his lips in anticipation.
Richards stops the recording and faces Tony. “That’s all there is. I don’t have anything else. I did some studies in other realities to pin down what these Ornari are. Really nasty creatures. Come in and literally consume the worlds they invade. All the while they look for what they say is the Perfect Seed.”
In the midst of his rampage on the terrorists, Tony begins to understand he’s not only clearing out the bullies of the world, but also looking for Steve. The press and the US government insists that this Iron Man – as they call him – stupidly enough though it has a nice ring to it – must stop his vigilante missions. He doesn’t – if he does – he’ll lose any hope of finding Steve.
“Here we go,” Tony says and navigates the shuttle toward the tiers of small ports along the huge burgeoning underbelly of the station. It looks like a glass fishbowl and Steve leans forward trying to get a better view of it. “You want to see it better?”
Tony convinces the paramedics to transport Steve to the Tower. It didn’t take much but now Tony wonders if it was worth it. Not one doctor, not Bruce, not anyone can tell what the hell is wrong with Captain America. He literally had a seizure, dropped over like a drunk in the middle of the diner, and went into a fit that terrified Tony and probably half the rest of the world. Every major news outlet and some of the shadier ones are carrying smartphone footage of the event. Every pundit and crackpot doctor is hacking away at the reasons for Captain America’s sudden sickness. Some attribute it to the ice, saying Captain America is rapidly aging and will die soon – they’ve even managed to show men of advanced age who kind of look like Steve. They don’t outright say that it’s Steve but they elude to it. Others attribute it to some kind of new alien invasion that targeted Steve in particular, trying to take away the leader of the Avengers, before the full out new incursion occurs. There’s even another theory that the germs that resided in the ice with Steve infected his brain and like the known brain eating amoeba are slowly devouring his neural networks.
“Well, you look like you haven’t eaten since they found you. Let’s work on that, shall we?” He hits his glasses and Penny comes on line.
Over the engine sounds and the splash of the ocean around them, Steve says, “Never been to Norway. Went to the hotbed places in the Army.”
Tony peers out of the side passage and then pops back in close to Steve. “Fuck. Fuck. That’s all I have that’s the supplies. That’s my fucking suit.”
Tony never answers in the dream. He wakes up hot and sweaty, wondering at the nonsense of his dreams. It’s the middle of the night and he’s lying on top of the covers of his bed. He never even got undressed.
Steven smiles, and it is rueful and touched with melancholy. “I’m just an omega from the old world, sir.”
He stumbles to the beach, letting the waters crash against his ankles. He wonders if he could drown with the weight of his wings. Tony stops him, holds him back.
Steve decides to approach this assignment a different way. Standing and allowing himself to steady his legs, he says, “You know, you have it all wrong.”
“Shit,” Tony says and leaps to his feet. “Okay, okay, we can – how about the ocean – it’s right outside the patio door, might be easier than the shower in this bath. Too small.”
It’s something that the team discussed prior to the mission. Cho expressed concerns, pointing to the weaknesses in the cradle technology, psychological stress factors, and how the reaction of the interface worked. Tony stayed stone cold silent on the matter. It indicated that Cho hit on something worrisome, but they proceeded anyway.
Steve silently questioned Clint but he only shook his head and raised his brows. He had no idea, either. When Sam returned he placed an old flip phone on the table. “It’s a burner. I keep it charged. Let’s just say I got a cousin who never has been a friend of the law. I keep it activated. Take it.”
He’s able to direct the paramedics to transport Steve to the Tower. No one fights with him or argues. This is Captain America after all. He saved the world, twice. And he’s paying for it, now.
“Like I said I don’t think I can ever think of him as Brother, but since he’s part of the pack and he’ll start getting more and more of our-.” Tony didn’t know quite how to put it. “Vibes? Yeah, vibes, then I think it would be a good thing to get him and get him well.”
Steve doubts anything in the Hub will nourish the serum. It’s like being in the Fey realm – food is only a mirage. “Let’s go.” He’ll play along for now. Getting the lay of the land is his plan right now. He doesn’t have time, though. The worm works its wonders and who knows what damage it might do to his head if he’s not rid of Ultron by the time it’s done.
Tony could do better alone. He didn’t need the Avengers, and he sure as hell didn’t need a soul pack. Why did the drive home feel like every fucking P.E. class he took in grade school where no one fucking picked him for dodgeball or baseball or basketball? He was always last and no one ever cared about his ability to play. Oh, and they loved him in dodgeball. His own fucking team threw the ball at him to get him out immediately and bench him.
“Is it perverse?” He spoke to no one as he stepped into the shower. Just wanting to be with someone. Loving someone, how was that wrong? He shook it away as he let the water fall. It was wrong. His upbringing had to mean something. Didn’t it? He couldn’t throw it all away. Otherwise, what was he, who was he? He wondered what his mother would think – and that cooled his sudden need. Would she be disappointed? Disgusted? She was a saint to him and he wouldn’t ruin her memory with his fears and doubts.
The voice floats in the air around him with promises and wishes. He starts to dream again but the voice is insistent on eating, on getting healthy.
“It’s only been a month, the suppressants have a biological half-life of 15 standard days, that means I still have at least another month before I get so low that-.”
When the entered into the private room with its bare cot and blank walls, the gray paint closed off everything else even the beating of his heart. The words, all the words fell out of his mouth and he lost them. Gone. What could he say? What did he say? At that moment, he never missed Peggy more – even though Thor had taken her place as Guide no one could truly be Peggy Carter to him. No one.
Steve gazes at him for a long while before he moves across the space and encompasses Tony in his arms. He notches his chin atop Tony’s head and whispers, “I care, too. But you have to know. I want to keep seeing you, but if they find out.”
“No, I didn’t need to,” Steve replied and he wanted to ask why he would have acted on it because the transfer of pain and confusion was more of a seeking than something that was an affliction. “I think the Hulk was confused but didn’t know how to communicate it.”
Before Steve blocks Stane’s attempt, Tony apologizes and heads away. Steve watches them go and his stomach flops over, sickeningly. He should intercede and stop Stane, but he really doesn’t know as much about the politics as Tony’s right hand man does.
“I didn’t mean to upset you, Tony,” Steve said. “I needed to get some of my energy out. I felt like my nerves might explode. I just needed some time.” He stood up. The bundle of energy still crackled through him and shuddered through the soul bond.
The thought of Tony not recalling, not remembering all the horror wrapped up in Obadiah Stane hurts, even though Steve shouldn’t feel this way. He can’t help throwing a barb across the bow. “Thankfully?”
JARVIS had been an artificial intelligence. ULTRON had been an artificial intelligence with the mindset longing for something more- for consciousness on the level of a human or more, a god. Tony can see the avenues, the roads toward consciousness, if he could only tweak a little here and there.
Luckily Steve’s stronger than Tony and pushes him back. “Lay down, I need to clean out the inflamed tissues and cut some of it to get this old magnet thing out.”
Tony straightens in his seat, his arms close to his chest, and he says in a low growl, “I mean to make a life for myself, Captain. I mean to live my life, not rot in a room somewhere. I’ve lost a lot of what was promised to me, but I don’t intend to lose that as well.” He looks over at Steve, his gaze penetrating and slightly menacing. “I thought you would understand the value of living life to its fullest.”
Steve breathed heavily around the ball gag. His ass ached where she had dry fingered him and his cock still twitched from the orgasm. He glared at Ross as the man watched the proceedings. One of the lab-coated men turned. Steve caught his name tag – Reynolds.
Steve shuffles around and pushes against the soft mattress. His wings, his tortured wings flop against his back and he winces, curling up as if he’s smacked hard onto the pavement from a great height.
“Iron Man?” Thor called through the link and Tony realized he’d ended up hovering over the action instead of doing something about it. In response, he drove in, flashing past the battlements toward the center where the twins and Brother ducked away from the barrage of gunfire. The young man with shockingly white hair gripped his sister and bolted toward the side armaments.  Tony gaped as the young woman raised her hands and fire energy swirled and then burst out like a shock wave, hitting the guards in their way and neutralizing them.
“That’s nice Happy. Everyone should like what they do.” Steve turns this over in his head. He does like being a sex worker. “I like what I do, too.”
“Yeah, Tony, I think we are,” Steve said. “We might not be like other soul packs, but you – all of you – but you especially taught me that this is a thing we do together. You are my core, my fulcrum. I can’t do this without you. And with you as my center, everything and everyone else revolves around us.”
As they step down onto the homestead, the smell of honeysuckle floats in the air. It tightens his chest a little but he figures it’s the tension. The idea that he can smell and see and hear and feel in this place is a little disconcerting.
On top of the slope, he hears Steve laughing. Cupping his mouth, Steve hollers down to Tony. “Serves you right!”
“Don’t worry. You don’t have to worry ever again.”  It takes a long while to calm Blu and the ache in Tony’s chest isn’t from his ribs, but from the hole dug there by a lion. He soothes the beast and quietly speaks to him until night falls.
The shocks sent jitters through Steve and his teeth knocked together so hard he thought they might crack. As Rumlow advanced, Steve blocked only to suffer another arc of lightning to his torso. Rumlow panted, sweat pouring down his brow.
He needs Bruce to tell him to settle down and take his punish for inventing a killer robot. He needs Pepper to show him there’s something redeemable about his soul. He needs JARVIS to tell him when to sleep, when to eat, when to breathe.
Once they inject the Pym particles into Tony’s eye they have to keep him sedated for a week so that the particles can grow through his optical nerve at the back of his eye to rebuild the broken bridge to his brain. It may cause some spikes of pressure in his eye and they have to monitor it. It could also cause a brain hemorrhage and stroke. Steve terrified of that possible side effect. The best thing they can do is keep him in an induced coma to keep his brain stable and functioning.
Now, Tony had to face the world as T’Challa asked for a reprieve and security for all vampires and mates. If they couldn’t get that – then their delegation would enact the next phrase of their plan: activate mates as their way to change the world and become known as Divini the globe over.
“Not bad,” Tony said. “Wish it was a little more romantic.” He dropped his bag. “I would have liked to make your first time more memorable.”
He would have the man bite his gland, if he could escape the truth. But he can’t and he won’t. There’s no urge to bond with the man, just the fleeting hope that he will find some way to ease the pain, the anguish. Alpha leaves him for a moment, and Steve tries to compose himself. He shouldn’t behave this way in front of a stranger. It strikes him as odd – this man has known him quite intimately for the last few days, and yet they are strangers to one another.
Surely the serum would have cleaned and cleared his system of any remnant of Tony’s healing factor. The vampire coagulant was a direct remedy to the anti-coagulant that his fangs injected. The fangs also induced the enhanced state of arousal. He went to the elevator. The serum would have cleared it by now He had to believe that as he stood at ease waiting for the lift.
“Floor, clothes off.” Tony had instructed, and something leapt in his throat. He normally never commanded during his feeding. He had always tried to be considerate to the human, but the man seemed like he wanted to lose himself in the feeding. Tony tried to play the part.
A weight against him brought him further back to reality as he looked down to see Tony’s head on his lap. Steve’s hand was tangled in Tony’s hair. Tony blinked awake as well. He grimaced. “Steve?”
Tony resists the urge to stick his tongue out at Steve as he’s invited into the other apartment which is bigger and better furnished than Steve’s little hovel. Granted, the furnishings are anything but new, but there’s a couch and a cushioned chair positioned in front of an old tube television. A galley kitchen with an actual stove and oven (not just the hotplate Steve has) and a real sized refrigerator is tucked into one corner. The sink is small but still functional. There’s heavy drapes on the double window which are closed shielding the sun or something else. From Tony’s vantage point he counts four doors in the hallway. One has to be the bathroom, the others might be bedrooms. It’s much nicer than Steve’s studio though far from luxurious.
The soup is delicious and filling with the fresh bread. Steve devours it much to Tony amusement. How he knows, Steve’s not sure but he adds a slice of his own bread to Steve’s tray. He gobbles it up before he even thinks to thank him for it. “Oh yeah,” he’s chewing as he says it. “Thanks for the bread. For everything I mean. I’m starved.”
“Trying,” Steve heard himself say in the distance. He mumbled a curse and then listened to the faded memory of his mother telling him to always get up, always stand up.  With that conviction echoing in his head, Steve climbed to his feet, shrugged off an insistent Tony, and started down the stairs.
He hides for a good portion of the game in the bathroom and then when he can no longer do that, he spends the time staring at the players jostling and flinging each other around the bowl. Today his center sank, and he fell with it. Yet unlike the players he cannot ride the waves to some equilibrium again. His boots stick him firmly to the floor. He’s not only figuratively stuck here he’s literally stuck with these people – with Tony.
“Tony,” Pepper said as she faced him. The eerie green light from the computer screen threw odd tones across her face. But he still glimpsed the tears in her eyes, on her cheeks. “I think I found out who he is.”
“Don’t worry.” Steve straightens as much as he can, trying to see. He wiggles his butt against the shield and that sends shockwaves through Tony. The shield starts to slide. “Here we go.”
For a few minutes Tony cannot compute what the hell is going on because Steve's state transfixes him.  Reds, blues, and blacks streak up and down Steve’s chiseled body while fingerprints encircle his throat. It looks like someone bashed his head against the wall at some point. His eyes are blood shot and stained from tears. His eyes rove across Steve to the nightstand where a wad of cash bigger than anything he’s thrown there sits. Before he can say a word, Frank’s massive paw grabs him again and he hauls Tony back to the door. Tony kicks but it falls short. It’s enough though because it throws the monster off balance and they both tumble to the floor.
Steve takes the tongs and serves the prince some of the salad. When he goes to serve himself, the prince raises his finger and takes the serving utensils from his hands. He serves Steve.
“For years as a lion, I would dream of a crow who would accompany me on my journey. There were a few months when I would chase any I saw. They ended up trying to pluck at my eyes when I slept.” Steve smiles. “It was you all along.”
Silence answers him. He waits at the door, leaning against it as the pilot and co-pilot along with a flight attendant board the plane. All they have to do is hang out for the arrival of Doctor Strange. Steve hears the click of the lock, and the door opens.
Moving on Tony, Steve cups his face in his hands and presses lips, tenderly and softly just in case he wants to move away. Tony startles at first but then relaxes into the kiss. His hands come up and scrap across the back of Steve’s neck. It sends thrills down his spine and he shivers. It’s enough to move him away from Tony to gaze into his eyes.
Steve awakes to reality and sees Tony hunched over him, a series of probes and wiring hang from his head and chest. They snake around him and disappear under Steve’s neck and head. He blinks a few times, trying to discern if this is reality, if the world will smear around him like it did in the virtual one. It doesn’t. The image stays steady and Tony smiles at him.
“Well, if you want to call me Dummy, I can fill that role,” Steve says and there’s a lightness in his voice that invites.
He finds his way down to the street, roaming a little aimlessly, yet feeling the fool because he wants desperately to check in on Tony. Several of the town’s residents check in and he talks amicably with them. They all inquire after Bucky and he’s comforted that the people of Avenge seem like a good lot – for the most part.
“Thanks,” Steve replies and then adds, “Before you go, please tell Wanda to be careful. With the Strike Team sniffing around, I think there’s a lot of focus on what’s going on especially with the prince and his next move.”
He practically growls, “It is now.” The rest of JARVIS’ warnings buzz in his head and he files them away. The idea of the lion in someone’s hands, the hands of a professed murderer, enrages him.
“What’s the note say?” Tony joins Steve at the corner of the island to get a look at the note. It’s in Natasha’s handwriting. “It says, Clint owes me a hundred bucks.”
He reaches out a shaking hand as Yinsen offers him the dented bowl. “Or what? They’ll feed me to the lion?” Though Yinsen hasn’t told him who it is that is holding him, Tony pretty much knows. It’s not rocket science (and for god’s sakes, propulsion is not that hard to figure out).
What cleared everything up was Bruce.  He happened to touch Steve’s wrist, the heated band of welted flesh and Steve hissed. Not from the touch, not from any pain on his wrist, but from something inside. Something horrible and beautiful. An ache so true and pure that he shuddered in its wake. He clutched the edge of the table with his other hand, hearing the wood crack and splinter even as he watched Bruce fall away and groan. The scientist grabbed his own wrist and wilted to his knees.
In a leap to jump away from the pain threatening to overwhelm him, Steve went back to the subject at hand – Natasha’s trip to the US. “I suppose Clint was with her?” It would be nice to see Clint again. Talk about what happened, thank him as well as understand him. They had bridge to rebuild between them and Steve wished for the opportunity to see if it was possible.
Even though Steve trusts Tony with his life, he cannot stop the rampant stampede of his heart in his chest. It’s painful and throbs a beat against the soreness of his wound. He fists his hands and stands perfectly still, his eyes never leaving Tony.
His mind sees Tony only in a best light. He’s biased. He admits it. What else would he expect considering he loves Tony – the admission stuns him. He loses his grasp of the chains and slides down, the rough metal raking over his palms. His feet struggle for purchase. He grabs the chains and grounds out a scream to hold onto the slimy surface of the links. The chain swings dangerously and he bashes his shoulder against the wall. He tells himself there’s no real physical damage. Not here in this rim, not in any of the others. But maybe there’s a deeper damage – one seeded from realization of a love he can never have.
Steve went to Clint’s bedside as one nurse went to clean up the mess he’d made.  He turned to her and knelt to help her though she did most of the work. Tony watched him silently. Once they finished the task, the nurse thanked him and she gave him a wipe for his hands. He cleaned up and tossed the wipe in the biohazard trash bin. For only a second, Tony locked his gaze on Steve’s and then went back to Clint.
Maybe it’s the long hardship Steve endured over the years or the need to prove somehow his soul is cleansed of the Red Skull’s taint. Maybe it’s his stubbornness to believe there’s always a happy ending, there’s always a place for love in a story. He doesn’t know, nor does he care. All he wants is to show Tony how they are entangled, a soul split into two beings. Two beings with different lives and different hopes and dreams, but still the same soul. It’s not the antiquated idea of soulmates but integrated and only whole together.
