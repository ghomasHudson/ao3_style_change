. And he can't even get started on his best friend, and every single military type who trip themselves up over Rogers. The asshole even knows it, that the military idolizes him, and plays a little game with every higher-than-a-captain officer. Rogers always waits for them to realize that they outrank Captain America, and then has them practically apologizing to his feet, even though they have no reason to.
“Ooh, arse,” Tony comments. “Did you learn that from Director Carter?”
”And I’m the hypocrite who yelled at you for trying to come up with a solution for alleviating your goddamn nightmares! You think I don’t know what the end of the path means? We all die in your dream, don’t we? One final mission that ruins us and tears us apart because we weren’t enough? Don't apologize."
"That's Hill? Hardass Hill? Like, Deputy Director Maria Hill?" He probably looks like a fish with all of his gaping, but it's fine. What's not fine is that Maria Hill is laughing and grinning with Steve Rogers of all people.
Steve manages another painfully honest smile at the crowd and picks up his award as the music starts to play him off; the timing could not have been any better. He slips into the corridor that takes him backstage and cries, letting out a shuddering wrack that shakes his entire body for a second. It’s a nightmare. Out there had been a nightmare disguised as a victory. There had been no salvation, no amount of psyching himself up for the Oscars that could have prevented the meltdown, and he doesn’t know whether to be comforted or tired at the information or revelation.
Always the good guy. Always the straight guy. Always the bastion of sunshine and purity. Always.
He was alive. Pepper was alive. Rhodey was alive. Happy was alive. The Mandarin was not. His mansion was not.
. And he can't even get started on his best friend, and every single military type who trip themselves up over Rogers.

“Me,” Tony interrupts with a huff. “The movies you’re talking about; I was Sherlock in those.”
“And with the way we shot them,” Tony adds on, with a funny look Steve’s direction, “It was generally different. Peggy made us do a lot of our scenes in one continuous take. The first scene where we’re actually together onscreen, the scene where Rogers seduces me again, that one was our first take, first shot. Sure, I think they used different cameras on us to catch everything, but that was one take, one shot. It was also the first scene we shot together, funny enough. There wasn’t room to be awkward, and I feel like with Steve, it could have never been awkward.” Steve has to remind himself that he is on national television before his mind starts telling him just what had happened during that scene and how hot it had been.
Does he want to risk her being wrong for the first time? Just how much does he trust Natasha Romanoff and his own instincts? Will he regret it for the rest of his life? Is it worth it?
had gotten laid, and that was that. Hill showed up fifteen minutes later than Steve, but she looked perfectly put together while holding a cup of SHIELD café coffee, which he knew took a minimum of twenty minutes to receive. Huh. She was good.
Everheart nods, as if everyone before him had said the same thing. Also fair, considering Jen played into her character frighteningly well. But Everheart’s eyes turn shrewd, and she asks, “And what about your final castmate?”
Peggy’s emphasized pause and sharp look at the audience immediately fosters chills.
Except for one small problem.
Steve chooses that moment to step out of Bruce and Natasha’s room with his old man pajamas and thin shirt, Bruce bright pink behind him. That’s a story, Tony thinks. Steve’s also holding what seem to be Clint’s hearing aids. Steve tries to sign something, but horribly fails on account of Clint’s hearing aids still in his hand. Steve looks Clint in the eye—with nowhere near as intensity as he does Tony all the time—and clearly asks, “Did you take these out again?”
Tony wakes up in his bed, alone and just a little sore.
"Where did you learn how to dance?" Tony asks, because he's been dying to find out where Captain Save The Dance has had time and the ability to learn. He couldn't ask before, because that would ean admitting that he's been watching Steve dance, but now he can. "You're not half bad."
"The Steve Rogers phenomenon?" Pepper repeats questioningly from the other end of the video call. Right, the video call with Pepper about how the Avengers thing was going, and how R&D was going.
He realizes he hasn't exactly left Natasha at the bar yet, so she follows his gaze to Steve and rolls her eyes. "And to think everyone says he's awful at flirting." She sounds a little pissed off, and he immediately can tell that Steve's thwarted all of her matchmaking plans for him just by virtue of being his unique self. He grins and wonders if she knows she's probably been looking at the wrong gender.
“That is true,” Tony simply says, keeping quiet for once. A moment of awkward silence passes, and Steve starts to snicker.
He walks down, delighted in his movements.
much more than what his words do, his mannerisms that are so very distinct, and anything and everything else that’s uniquely Tony. He can walk into any room where Steve’s at and suddenly Steve will feel all the more better. It’s like magic, the way Tony makes Steve want to smile and never stop.
. Instead, he says, "I wasn't saying they were going to date."
“I wasn’t about to let you cry alone,” Tony responds, not unkindly, but sympathetically. “Not when you’ve worked too hard for this, not when she’s worked too hard for you for this. You know, she told me to watch after you. Said you cried too easily.”
When Steve hears his name announced, he thinks he’s dreaming. In fact, even when his body responds and he walks up with a smile he knows will leave wrinkles in his face when he’s seventy, he’s numb to the core. He’s really not in the moment; Steve is lost to the confines of his mind, screaming. He smiles and nods as the presenters give him a little hug and an encouraging nod. Steve feels himself putting down the Oscar to hold the microphone without feeling like he was playing a juggling act.
"Yeah, and male?" Tony bluffs again, because Natasha had said that no one else knew and not to give it away. So he can't say anything.
Sam—new guy, codename: Falcon, as in those wings he had designed years ago—finishes telling the story and Tony leans back on the door more, blown away in horror. It just doesn't make any sense, and yet it completely does. Vague bits and pieces, things that seemed off now had explanations. None of it was something Tony wanted to accept.
Steve laughs. "You lost last time. Eager to do it again?"
Tony grins as his mind is doing cartwheels and flips and playing fireworks in his mind, congratulating him for his soulmate. “As long as we’re in agreement.”
Steve shakes his head, gesturing vaguely to negate Tony’s point. “I mean—it wasn’t—I just—okay, it wasn’t like there was no hesitation. Obviously I knew that if I took it, the role would be, like you said, like none other in my filmography. But it was just—I liked it. The challenge.”
Steve turns away sadly from the adorable little dog, whose name is Pippa, but not before giving her one last head pat and pet. “You think I can adopt another dog?” Steve asks Tony as they walk away from the fans and onto the actual carpet for press interviews.
back at the warehouse where we found the scepter?”
There it is again, the oddly dry look that Steve gives Tony that Tony can't understand. "
"Tony," Steve says, a hint of a question lacing his words.
“This award is for every girl and woman who aspires to become a director. We need you to shape the stories from different perspectives, and we need you to represent, because you can do this. You can be right up here, same as I, as long as you believe in yourself. I believe in you; do yourself a favor and believe in yourself. Believe you can stand on this stage and inspire the next generation or female directors. All of you.” She smiles and gracefully walks off stage, escorted by one of the presenters. It takes a few minutes for her to reach the table, but when she does, she breathes a sigh of relief. Steve gives her two small thumbs up when she shoots him a look clearly meant to ask how her speech was. Peggy smiles again.
Namely, Tony, who keeps recommending shows that Steve has no clue how he has time for. Tony’s been on the same circuit that Steve has for the last year with this movie; how the hell has he had time to have an actual life and watch things? Steve doesn’t get it at all, but Tony’s also the kind of human being that actually can manage to live with four hours of sleep and caffeine in their blood. Tony’s also the kind of human being to make this press circuit a little more tolerable and definitely more enjoyable. He still hasn’t managed to get tired, unlike Steve, who’s ready to throw everything into a neatly wrapped trash bin and sleep in his own bed.
“I’m hurt,” Tony says, “I’m so incredibly hurt. See if I ever wingman you again, Mr. Straight-Laced. I’ll just laugh at your failure.”
He pales slightly, and some of the coldness in his eyes comes back. “I was a blank.” His implied
Thank goodness she skims right over the dog and into the movie, something he can easily talk about. “Well,” he shrugs, “That’s what everyone told me, you know? I was actually discouraged from taking the role by a lot of people because it just wasn’t me or like me to even pretend to be someone like... my character, but Peggy was insistent. Truth be told, I really wanted a change of pace and it all lined up really well.”
”And?” Tony prompts, dreading what Steve was about to say.
"Male."
He takes the card back from Steve’s hands and pulls of the next sticker, still snickering. “They had to lead with that, didn’t they. Alright, is Steve Rogers Captain America? Yes, he is. Everywhere. Every time. He’s Captain America right now. Actually. Ahem. Is Steve Rogers...”
“Pepper,” he finally asks, “What is wrong with me?”
“Tony?” Steve asks, and they’re both aware of everyone having taken notice of the pause. Steve did pause the movie, that always raises questions. “Are you okay?”
So Tony invites Steve to a party he's throwing at the Tower out of good spirit, and Steve accepts it surprisingly, also in good spirit. He didn't even have to say anything to convince Steve to say yes, which really threw him for a loop, considering he had a few things up his sleeve to try and persuade him. Tony'll take it as a win.
He needs to be able to lie and pull off the lie with a straight face.
. Tell me,
realizes what the hell it means to be an Avenger after Loki and the Chitauri.
As he says that, Steve pulls Tony into an elaborate Left Whisk that most people can't even recognize is a waltz step, unless they see it in the context of a waltz. He has to hand it to Steve for making a point boldly.
When Tony’s name is called for the Best Film Supporting Actor, Steve reacts faster than Tony does, by springing to his feet and all but pulling Tony up to stand. Tony blinks away his surprise fairly quickly, and hugs Steve tightly. Steve can feel the presence of Tony’s grin, and he laughs proudly.
So he does.
,” Steve says lightly, like he can’t breathe. There's a smile growing on Steve's face, reverent in a way that's never associated with Tony.
Steve is the only one that doesn’t live at the Tower, to Tony’s chagrin. Even Natasha was finally persuaded, more by Clint than anything, but she did still say yes. He visits frequently, sometimes for Avengers business, sometimes for training, sometimes for the gym, sometimes for fun, sometimes for teal meals and bonding, and sometimes for movie night, but he never stays. Tony doesn’t know what to think of that. He tries persistently, to get Steve to move in with the rest of them, but Steve digs in his heels and constantly refuses in his polite, aw shucks manner that somehow completely softens the blow. Tony doesn’t know how Steve does it. He’s also managed to completely win over Pepper, and Tony’s fairly sure the two of them meet occasionally to talk about whatever they talk about. Tony still has not completely ruled out that they’re not meeting to either a) rule the world b) conspire against Tony into getting him
Rogers glances at him incredulously, as if to ask
"I'm counting that, by that way," Steve says, rolling his eyes, "But he knows because he caught me out on a date."
“Peggy made us walk in blind,” Steve says, and he notices how the audience has gone suspiciously quiet, “I mean, we knew our lines and the gist of what was happening, but it was all kind of spontaneous. That scene, especially. We genuinely had to give the performances of our lives and behave as if everything was real, especially with the all-capturing camera angles, because we couldn’t hide and Peggy didn’t want to offer us the lifeline of a second take.”
"Yeah," Tony says, because his mind cannot function with how close Steve is to him and how much hotter he looks up close. "That's fine." He makes a prompt exit, lest he lose his cool, and saunters over to Natasha. She already knows what he wants, and he just waits while he thinks.
"Are you sure you aren't deliberately fucking with me? Because I refuse to believe you've thought of everyone and come up blank."
"I didn't think you were the type to play chicken, Rogers. If I win, I feel like you should go find this guy.”
The question remains on why Rogers would be at it, since nothing about a gay bar would go along with his old constitution.
“Steve,” the bartender yells over, which means Tony has to stop staring like a lunatic, “You have a friend looking for you!”
"Tony, someone blew you up. It's a very valid question," Steve petulantly said. Tony laughed again, not as broken and hollow as before.
"Straight as my hair," she bluntly says, and he realizes she knows, she's known this entire time about Steve and the fact that Tony knew. Her hair is in ruby red ringlets. "And no one else knows, so don't you dare share it."
to live here, in this century, Tony can say that Steve’s doing better. His smiles are more real, he’s less likely to hunch into himself, he’s less likely to tense and retreat.
"I think Thor would have liked him better," Steve says, wrinkling his nose at the memory. "More of a feast and fuck type. I thought it was a causal hookup, and then he brought me to a local restaurant from his apartment, so I was wondering if he wanted to date, but then we went back to his apartment and then I realized it wasn't so... that's five questions by the way."
“Blue cranes,” Tony responds, though several dozen commenters are faster than Tony. “But I don’t think anyone wants to hear about the blue cranes anymore.”
"Number One: Is there someone you like at this little shindig?"
SHIELD is/was HYDRA. Pierce was their leader. HYDRA is/was everywhere, in governments all around the world. That was why the three of them were declared fugitives. The new guy is Steve’s running buddy, and a VA counselor with an impressive resumé as the Falcon. New guy was Air Force, trained by Rhodey. Fury was almost killed by an elusive decades-old assassin named the Winter Soldier. Fury is now, for all intents and purposes, dead. The Winter Soldier is not. He was James Buchanan Barnes, as in Steve’s best friend and Howling Commando and personally Tony’s favorite. He was sent to eliminate Steve as well, right before Project Insight was launched. Project Insight, something Tony had taken a look at and not paid attention to. There’s the shit with Arnim Zola, and Hill now working with Pepper, and Coulson being alive (with his own new team) and the Winter Soldier
But as the party winds down somewhere near midnight, somewhere near one, and he's gliding across the room, checking up and socializing seamlessly, he notices something strange. When he looks at Natasha, who's subtly staring at the same thing with a hint of curiosity, he goes over to her again. Seems like they were wrong, or Steve wasn't telling the full truth.
"You're not denying it," Tony observes. "So there is someone. You know, you've been dancing a long time with me. Are you trying to play for jealousy? Doesn't work too often, you know. Especially when you're with me; because then they'll think you're mine for the night."
"Now that you've figured it out," he hears Steve saying with a wink, "Come find me after this."
When he looks back at the livestream, Steve shrugs, not denying it. “What was I talking about before?” he asks, wondering if he actually finished answering the question suddenly.
He never sees the note fallen onto the floor, written in flowing blue cursive explaining to him that Steve has to go, but that he will drop by as soon as he can to talk if Tony doesn't want a phone call.
He stops. Flounders. Stares.
"Brunette."
But at the end of the gala, when all has been said and done, Steve leaves alone, and Tony hasn't really seen him in the company of an unattached man for too long.
“What a funny family of soulmate issues we are,” Natasha says. “You don’t have one, Steve’s the poster boy for blanks, Bruce can’t be with his, Thor is Asgardian and their system is different, and I have three different timers. I don’t really remember one, one has happened, the last hasn’t. The two that have happened; I know they don’t remember either.”
“Okay,” he says, and when Pepper makes a noise indicating she doesn’t quite believe him, he much more confidently repeats, “Okay. I have to—”
“I’d bet my Oscar that the news—”
"Then what do you do?" Tony asks, completely puzzled. "And in what sense are you talking about?"
He wouldn’t say that Steve and him were best friends, but he would say that Steve has somehow worked himself into being one of Tony’s friends. Tony has no clue on how it happened, especially after the horrible scepter-influenced first start that they had, and all the bitter resentment Tony had built up over decades against Steve. Until he comes up with an explanation, he’s calling it the Steve Rogers phenomenon. Or something like that.
"That's bullshit," Tony says, because what else is he going to respond to that? "Can you just give me a straight answer? Come on."
Pepper shook her head. "We'll see."
"Oh." A few seconds later, while he's thinking about it, he says, "Goodnight, I guess."
Steve blinks at that. “Wait a second,” he says in realization. “Is this all because Natasha made me take a photo with that Dorito? It’s my shoulder-waist ratio, the Dorito, right?”
Tony is starting to think that this is maybe why Steve accepted so quickly, had it not been for his eye catching someone coming up the stairs. There he goes.
Nineteen days ago, his timer had told him he had three years to go. Eight days ago, it had told him that he had three months left. Five minutes ago, it had told him he had three weeks left. And now? Three days, one hour, twenty-nine minutes and forty-seven seconds. He wonders what it will say in the next few days, and he wonders what it'll jump to this time. Tony's timer has never decreased three times in a row like this, and he wonders what's going to happen next. Will it jump to three decades? Three years again? What now?
“He’s 6’2”, blond, blue eyes, muscles on muscles, uptight personality with a great ass, and probably not here,” Tony describes as the other man’s smirk deepens, somehow recognizing the description and knowing full well who is being described.
“I think it’s a little more weird kissing an actor who you met pretty recently,” Tony slowly says, since Steve says absolutely nothing trying to come up with a different answer that is appropriate, “Because you have to establish some kind of chemistry or people will see right through that. And, you know, Steve and I have won awards for that, so.” He laughs.
"Tony," Steve greets with a smile, and Tony blinks. He had been staring at the stairs for too long, zoning out for a second. "Sorry I'm late."
“You're what, five years older?” Steve asks, even though he knows the exact number of years, months, and days thanks to a very boring afternoon they had spent together. “Six. Five? Six. Five and a half. Five and three quarters. Five and a quarter? Six and a quarter? It’s not four. Is it
“Or you could tell me how much you appreciate me,” Tony says, barely hiding a laugh. “You know being your roommate and all.” Steve shoots him a sly look.
“I mean,” Steve responds, sending a
Tony suddenly has a flashback to Pepper telling him that he has a soulmate. He groans; she’ll never let this go. Next to him, it seems that Steve is thinking of someone (Sam or Natasha) who’ll rag on him. Tony thinks that he has the shorter end of the stick though. Because Pepper will never let this go. He can already hear her in his mind.
Tony shrugs. There are worse press incidents and issues than the conservatives coming after Rogers. "Why not? And back then, anyway, you had Carter, right? So you're what, bisexual? Pansexual? Polysexual? Preferring not to put labels? You like women, so I mean, you'll only get yelled at half the—”
Tony laughs. “I hope you’re proud of us, Mrs. Rogers, your boy just bagged an Oscar Best Leading Actor Nomination and I a Best Supporting Actor.”
“Aw, babe, jealous?” Tony asks teasingly. But his expression sobers up pretty quickly. “Don’t answer that; I don’t want my heart crushed by your answer. But in all seriousness, I wish I could tell you how much fun it was playing the character. It took me a lot of convincing, I’ll admit that, but I don’t know why I hadn’t said yes sooner and saved Peggy, our Director, the trouble.”
“Blanket around the world so that the fight can end, we can go home, and none of us do end up dying on that final mission.
“No, but I learned all about your failure to film your first scene from her,” Steve says all too sweetly. “And to everyone who watches the movie, you’ll see what I mean.” He winks. It’s all a lie, because it’s still a little hard to breathe, but Tony makes it just a little lighter, just a little more honest. But it’s fine; Steve can act.
“Ovviamente,” Tony says with a wink. “You think the name Antonio came from Russia? Even if it is Anthony, it’s still Italian.”
Natasha and Clint have a priority as SHIELD agents, and this Tony knows. He has a priority to Stark Industries. Bruce has one to his science. Thor has one to Asgard. They all have day jobs. So what does Steve have? Captain America isn't a day job.
"No, he stands out plenty," Steve grins. "I don't think a lot of people have been able to take their eyes off of him."
Steve has always been a fiercely guarded, private person. It just so happens that he is currently one of the most popular actors in the world, fresh off another Captain America movie. Everyone knows him thanks to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the success of the Nomad trilogy—that is, they know that Steve is decent at playing superheroes, heroes, and good guys in or out of straight rom-coms.
“Sorry,” he apologizes on behalf of Tony, “We’re still not allowed to breathe a word about the movie. He’s just being a jerk about it, since he’s half in love with his character. A bit narcissistic if you ask me, but to each their own.”
He hears Tony huff a laugh next to him, and still doesn’t look. “It was also tricky,” Tony says, his voice too strange. It’s... neutral? Fake? Chilling? “He’s not exactly the smallest person in the world, which meant pushing him up against that wall in one of the scenes hurt my arms. We had a lot of... wall scenes.”
He waits for Tony to pull back the last sticker, but Tony is still staring at him with his eyes wide, jaw dropped. He looks stunned to his core. Steve smiles awkwardly, waiting for Tony still to snap out of it.
Car stopped. I’m getting out.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony waves off nonchalantly, “I just had an idea for... it’s not important, don’t worry.”
Ratings: T for language
Tony gapes, because he hadn't known that. At all. Huh, that explained why none of them had seen Rogers in over a week. “He d—”
But since he isn't Thor and he doesn't have another real choice, he finds himself mingling around and talking to various governors and senators and representatives and lawmakers who he hasn't even heard of before, most of them. Well, then and many influential people, most of whom were at the charity gala. Tony's starting to realize why Fury really sent them all here as the titles all fly through his head. Looking around at Natasha, Steve, and Bruce, he sees that they're all realizing the same thing.
“You’re so very lucky that you’re cute and I love you,” Steve tells him.
“And remind me, did I end up in a hospital bed for this long? Did I end up in a hospital bed, period? No,” Tony says, earning himself a dirty look from Steve.
like I can’t for anyone else. Does that not make me miss
Clint blinks. "Buddy," the archer slowly says. "You're really not going to tell me that you haven't noticed that Steve swings the other way, right?" Tony gapes, because since when does Clint know? But Clint takes it the wrong way and frowns. "Oh man, did I just—Tasha! You said that he fucking knew! Jesus fuck, outing someone isn't... that's—”
Tony doesn't know what to make of it. In such a short span of time, too many things have happened, and too many secrets and blood have been spilled. He has JARVIS pull out everything he can about the Avengers and the Avengers-adjacent, knowing that this is what he can do to protect the team on his end. As soon as he realizes that all the information was on the internet—and what the hell was happening? How did the information get on there in the first place?—which was instantaneous, he immediately orders JARVIS to do that. And then he turns on the news and sees live footage of Steve's shield falling into the Potomac. Followed by Steve.
“This again,” Steve sighs again, heading into the bedroom and plopping down on the one bed.
.” The break in his voice came from him shamelessly moaning again, now that he didn’t have lines left in this scene to try extra hard to remember in the midst of remembering that this was not real. But damn, did he want it to be.
to be gay?” There it is again; Rogers spitting out Cap like its always left a bad taste in his mouth.
The joke is also slightly on SHIELD. He has his own trackers on Rogers's devices, because he's not ever going to be responsible for losing America's favorite golden man. All he has to do is open up a locating app and he knows where Steve is. So he does just that while Fury is yelling, passing it off as playing a game on his phone. The locator takes just under a minute to find him, and Tony almost drops his phone in surprise. According to his phone, Rogers is at a bar that Tony is familiar with. A gay bar, to be much more exact, and not even the most reputable of places. Tony knows it because it's the last place anyone would expect him, a playboy billionaire, to be when he wants a causal drink.
Tony wants to backtrack, backtrack, backtrack faster than he can think or even handle right now. “Fury—”
"Ooh. Now we're talking, Rogers. Okay, hmm, do you know if this guy has any kind of an interest in you?"
Rogers's jaw sets as his face darkens and glares at Tony, pinning him better to the wall than any shackles could ever hope to. “Congratulations, you found me. And now you know
Kat nods, but there’s a strange expression on her face as well, as if she’s discovered something new. Maybe it’s because of what Tony had just told her. “How long did it take to practice that scene, then? To get every detail and movement perfect?”
Pepper knows him better than that though, and she cuts right through it. “This doesn’t change anything about you.”
Tony starts to ask him what made him stop, because all that he can see in that direction is a clock and this isn't Cinderella, but Steve beats him to the point once again.
perfectly was a nightmare in itself because both Peggy and I are perfectionists. To shoot it four, five different times would have been living hell, but that’s kind of what I was talking about. It does feel like they’re all five different takes, and honestly, when I watched part of the movie before the premiere, I thought that maybe they used a different take that maybe I had forgotten about because of how tired I was. But it really was just one, and as people see more of the story, suddenly the speech makes more sense, I think. And then you learn more and you realize that you’re wrong and—it was just incredible shooting it.” He can feel himself smiling like an idiot near the end, but his smile refuses to cooperate with him and control itself.
Kat looks like Christmas came early for her too, even more so than last time he was in her show and he had called her by her nickname for the first time. “Really?” she asks, quickly schooling her fave into one of true professionalism. “I’m flattered. But don’t think I’m going easy on you tonight, because this is the first time you guys have showed your faces since the premiere and everyone has questions.”
The interviewer pretends to fawn over that. “Aww,” she cooes, “That’s too cute. It’s easy to forget you play a murderer in the move, Steve, especially since the role is like none other in your filmography.”
Because tonight, Tony's at a charity gala that the Maria Stark Foundation is hosting—not to be mistaken for the annual MSFG or any of Tony's parties. Of course, all of the Avengers are now on the roster, as has been the normal for the past few months, but Tony no longer has a need to worry. Thor is off-planet and he's the only one prone to damage things nowadays. Natasha and Clint have made it a competition to charm as many people as possible (which is only good for him) and though it stemmed out of an argument on who has better social skills, Tony isn't going to get in the way of that. Bruce, whenever he comes, always manages to find a fellow scientist or science enthusiast and then spends the entire night talking science. He isn't here tonight though, bowing out thanks to a science conference. Steve, Tony has only worried about once and that was at the initial Avenger's post-Loki press conference because he didn't want to have to be stuck on cleanup PR duty. But after the first one, he had discovered Steve has incredible schmoozing skills, probably gained from being Captain America and being a showgirl. Steve is in no way shy when it comes to people, unlike what his reputation says.
Tony spends the next few hours doing just that, going around but popping in on Steve whenever both of them have a spare minute. He's never realized how much fun this is, and how much time he spends on Steve's Q&A. The mini stories that come with some of the answers are endearing, or laughable, and he tries to ask questions so he'll get an answer and a story. Unfortunately, he exhausts his questions (though he finds that he wasn't really trying somewhere around Question #14) and Steve merely shakes his head with the mischievous, knowing smirk.
"Nope," Clint says, popping the p and somehow managing to grin over a glass of champagne. Classy, and so much unlike Clint. "We all know your favorites are Bruce and Steve. Because of sex and science."
Tony plays it off with a shrug, trying not to laugh. “Now I know your secret in winter.”
Rogers cuts in sharply. “Don't tell me that I'm half gay, or whatever you're about to say, and don't tell me that I can just date women and get away with liking men as well sometimes. I'm fucking gay and I can't fucking choose to just like girls; I've been trying for the past twenty damned-something years! And if you really don't know why I can't just be out with it, I really don't know what's to tell you, Stark. Thought you were supposed to be smart."
“I’m talking about the third of the movie that involved the two of you,” she says. The audience cheers loudly with approval and excitement. When they’ve quietened, she adds, “The movie wasn’t marketed as a love story.”
"Yes," Natasha responds, blinking. "They are."
Steve rubs his face with a groan, looking apologetic and sheepish as he gets up. God, is this the same guy who served in a goddamn World War?
But Tony isn’t listening to Steve anymore; he’s staring at Steve’s uncuffed wrist with a growing sense of horror and shock. 00-000-00-00-00. Steve’s found his soulmate. Steve has a soulmate, and now is not the time to think about how it isn’t him or anything.
Steve winces a little, like he didn’t want to bring it up and make Tony relive those memories on account of him. “Okay,” Steve just nods, restarting the movie.
”You called it a vision,” Steve quietly says, standing up in realization slowly. “She showed Natasha, Bruce, Thor and I our worst nightmares, not our futures. Not
The smile doesn’t leave his face as he thinks about how to answer. If he says anything about Tony, she can and will seize upon it. But if he mentions nothing, she will also seize upon that. So he splits the difference and says, “I think I was the second actor to sign onto the movie, which meant I kind of spent some time before shooting began last year following up on the news of casting and script changes. And the thing about Peggy Carter is that she casts people who fit their roles and the people they work with almost perfectly, so I don’t think it was any surprise that all of us got on really well. And I kind of got to know everyone beforehand too, at least by meeting them once or twice, so, I loved them all.”
Tony calls Pepper, knowing that the footage of his conversation would be deleted in the very future.
Steve and Tony
He’s found his.
“Haven’t done this in a while,” Steve says into the camera, watching people pour into the stream. He’ll give them about a minute before he really starts talking. “No one make fun of me if I can’t remember how to do this again. Please. There’s a lot of people and the last thing I need is my agent yelling at me for being cancelled because I can’t use a camera. I don’t know if people can get cancelled over bad videoing, but I’d probably find a way. Also, I really don’t need my agent yelling at me. I’ve suffered so much under her wrath.”
For someone whose birthday is in a few days, Tony notices that Steve doesn’t seem happy at all. He looks incredibly pained and miserable, and Tony wonders what that’s all about. When he asks Sam, he just shakes his head and says that Steve has been like this ever since they raided the last warehouse. Sam asks him to try and get it out of Steve before he wallows in misery.
"Okay," Tony slowly says. "That's-that's good for her."
“Yeah,” Tony carefully, trying not to betray anything he’s feeling.
Tony blinks as his eyes drift away from the clock and towards his empty stashes of coffee and his empty pot of coffee. He frowns. Great, now he has to go to the communal floor and get some coffee... without getting caught by one of any of the frequent night-prowlers or someone passing through or leaving the Tower. Otherwise he knows he’ll just have to face the wrath, or in Steve’s case, puppy eyes, of someone and lose against them telling him to go get some sleep. The '

“Gee, compliments like that and a guy might actually think that you don’t hate him,” Tony says.
kisser?” Tony asks. Steve very pointedly doesn’t look at Tony, because he doesn’t think he’ll stop himself from caving and saying something dumb and sappy. “Kind of
”I’m serious. What is your dark side, Cap?” Tony asks, because he’s a bastard who can’t let go and because Steve can’t hate him any further than this. Also, since when he known to let things go?
“You sure?” Tony asks, still incredibly guilt-ridden. “Hell, you didn’t even tell any of us.”
"What's blasphemous to everyone else is your weird ability to not sleep in days just or the fun of it."
”Yeah,” Tony breathes out. “Wha-what do we do?”
He also did not deserve one of the most well-known facts about him. Steve Rogers was a blank, one of those few that weren't born with a timer. Every single history book and every single book on timers never failed to mention that tidbit. He was always used as a point to show everyone that people without timers could live happy lives and romantic ones too. Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter, of course, are one of history's famous couples, and the reason that much of the stigma behind the timerless and  timer-ignoring romances was removed. Though she went on to marry another man, Daniel Sousa, who had lost his soulmate early on, that relationship as well proved that other love still existed.
“Oh my god Steve, Maria’s on this,” Tony says suddenly, and Steve winces. “Alright, there’s a question from Steve’s agent, and she asks why Steve’s being a coy bastard when subtlety isn’t in his nature. Wow. Steve, she really went for you.”
But maybe that also isn’t it. Because as they’re standing their in mutual silence, trying to find new ground, Steve thinks that Tony looks like he wants to reach out again. Tony has the same look that Steve does when he wants to smooth out the tension in Tony’s face—which is a face he’s aware of only because Natasha takes pictures at his expense and gives long, detailed explanations on her interpretation of them. She’s never wrong.
Oh, Steve is good.
“Laura’s already chewed me out,” Clint mutters just as Natasha’s tearing him a new one in frantic hand gestures and glaring looks.
Warnings: None, unless you’re not into unhappy or ambiguous endings.
“Apparently you voluntarily dropped your shield,” Tony points out. “Like it’s not your primary offensive weapon and a one-of-a-kind, valuable and finely crafted shield. Made of the rarest metal on earth.”
“Finally,” Bruce mutters as he looks much more awake, suddenly.
He puts his phone away just as the car does, in fact, stop. And because Luis’s cousin—his chauffeur for whenever Steve has these events—is a human being who lives for the dramatics just as much as Steve does sometimes, Steve doesn’t reach for his door and waits barely a second before Ricardo opens the door for him with a grand flourish. Steve steps out, and whatever screaming there had been before increases at least tenfold, and same with the camera flashes. He’s glad he has tinted sunglasses on.
"You'd be his type, too," Clint continues ever so thoughtfully. "Dark, snarky, and smart."
Since he took deliberately smaller steps than Tony, Tony easily caught up to him. He pushed Steve up against the wall that Steve had nearly backed himself into, and Steve’s back hit it with a loud noise that nearly made Tony’s hands drop from Steve’s body in apology and surprise. This was nothing new for Steve (minus the Tony part of the equation) so he didn’t pay attention to the slight pain flaring from his back.
Steve feels Tony plop down next to him, and says, “Secret’s out.”
Oh, he hasn't lied to himself like this for
Steve smiles innocently and starts to pull off the next one, which is being particularly stubborn. “I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m telling it like it is.” Tony gasps again.
Tony gapes for what must be the fifth or sixth time that night. "You did what?" He wasn't even aware that Steve knew about the list, let alone was helping Tony with the list. "She did what?"
Tony gasps. “Steven Grant Rogers, are you accusing me of being sexually promiscuous?”
"You were out on a date? Ooh, Rogers, do tell," Tony teases.
“And to the one person who’s asked me why my agent hates me, thank you so much for trying. Appreciate it, but it’s a little too late for that,” Steve says, and a flurry of laughing emojis and surprised words flood the comments. Yeah, Steve knows that people had wanted him to talk about it, but were positive that he wouldn’t, since it was three months after the fact.
“We finished that movie together,” Steve says weakly, opening his eyes to see Tony. He does look like he’s cried a little bit. “I want you to be here, just to be proud.”
Tony raises an eyebrow at the camera. “That is the face of a man who secretly has a few stories he isn’t sharing. I’ll find them out, one of these days, don’t worry.” He pulls off the next sticker though, and reads, “Is Steve Rogers married?”
Steve snorts, though he deflates, almost like he’s remembering that he thinks he isn’t angry at Tony. “You are not easy, Tony Stark.” Steve blinks, too, like he’s finally realized where they are, where Tony is leaning against the wall for having taken too many steps backwards, and where he is, away from the bed he was sitting on.
"Who are you showing off to?" Tony asks slyly, starting his eyes around to try and see if Steve will blush at the insinuation. "Is there someone you're trying to impress?"
”And besides, I told you that you were good enough to have someone. You deserve it, Tony, don’t you dare turn this negative onto yourself,” Pepper warns, a fond tone in her voice.
"Okay," Natasha says, considering it in her mind. "Fair." They talk a little bit more, but break off when Natasha's suddenly busy with her actual role of today.
So he actually opens up a mindless bubble game on his phone and waits for Fury to be done yelling. He bolts out of there, which isn't exactly uncommon behavior, and then heads into his car. This, he has to check for himself, because it's surreal enough he can't fully grasp it.
Rogers's jaw sets as his face darkens and glares at Tony, pinning him better to the wall than any shackles could ever hope to. “Congratulations, you found me. And now you know
He says it all in a thick Brooklyn accent that Tony never knew Rogers had. Actually, Rogers being this carefree and light, without the stick up his ass and without that permanent scowl was something Tony hasn't even imagined. He thinks he would more sooner believe this was a cheerier, possibly gayer, more carefree and casual clone of Rogers than Rogers himself. Seriously, the sexuality (because why else would Rogers be here at a gay bar like a regular and look so comfortable?) reveal was shocking enough that Tony wondered if he was overthinking it. Maybe Rogers was here as a friend or something... but Tony hadn't even known that Rogers was aware of the mostly accepted LGBTQIA+ community, let alone be someone from the 1940's who accepted it this well. He can't handle this information right now, and—
“Not that I think you should ask anyone this,” Steve says, looking down so the camera can’t catch his eyes while he’s still thinking of what to say, “but it’s slightly true. Apparently there’s a rumor going around that I was checked into rehab. Um, no. I don’t even know if there’s a rehab facility for someone who cries too much. I’m not even talking about Bambi.” Steve laughs. “But I’ve been seeing a grief counselor for two and a half months. All I can say is that I should have been doing it for the past four years.”
"Steve. Just rethink your question for a second, okay?"
The next morning, Pepper hugs him for a solid few minutes after he tells JARVIS to call off the search. They get drunk again, equally smashed and crying. That is how Rhodey finds them a little while later when he drops in for a surprise visit. The day ends with the three of them drunker than they really should be, teetering the line of alcohol poisoning, and no one blames them, really.
It was a miracle he remembered his line, but to buy himself some time, Steve swallowed hard and mustered up a cocky smirk he knew didn’t belong to him. “As if you don’t know,” he responded, and sue him if his voice didn’t waver with how badly he wanted to forget all his lines and kiss Tony right there, and feel Tony everywhere.
Where the hell did these thoughts about Steve come from? Why the fuck does he want to fuck Steve until he couldn't walk right, super soldier or no? What even happened to disliking Steve and taking their glacier-like friendship and actually turning into a friendship? Why does Tony even care? Oh fuck, he cannot be lusting over Steve.
to be gay?” There it is again; Rogers spitting out Cap like its always left a bad taste in his mouth.
"Can we play 20 questions on who it is, then?" Tony asks, because Steve is indulging him this when he's
Silence reigned after Steve’s last four words. After what Steve deemed an appropriate time of tension-filled silence, he locked his jaw and looked down, as his character seemingly took the rejection. With an unhappy smile that fought its way onto his face, he took a step back. He was still shaking, and Steve recalled something he had learned years ago that it was much easier to internalize an emotion to induce shaking rather than fake it altogether. People were savvy, and could spot false emotions a mile away.
Steve laughs, a soft huff of air that brings a slightly relieved look on Natasha’s face, even if she will try to deny it. “You and Peggy submitted for me,” he reminds Tony. “I didn’t do anything.”
And Steve looks so young and peaceful without the heavy weight of Captain America on him that Tony doesn’t want to move and wake him up. It’s at this exact time when Tony realizes that Steve isn’t even thirty yet, that Steve has had to soldier the mistakes of the world and every other person from such a young age that he probably doesn’t even know what it’s like to be a carefree twenty something. Steve, who is sunshine and quick sketches and witty remarks and from-scratch baked goods, probably hasn’t even dated anyone.
They acquiesce to many of the photogtapher’s whims that they can hear. They face left and face right and look cameras dead on; they smile or they don’t or they smirk or make poster-worthy faces; they have their arms around each other’s shoulders or they don’t. And then come the dreaded single shots. Photographers make Tony take the photo spot next to Steve so that they can take pictures of just each of them. It unnerves him just a little, and he keeps sneaking glances over to Tony to see how Tony fares.
“This is... I shouldn’t even
"It's a priority in the sense that most people don't think Steve when they see me, but Captain America," Steve dryly says, a hint of a fond smirk dancing around his words. "And it's a day job because I spend every other day at SHIELD or some government as Captain America, or out somewhere doing Captain-like things."
Finally.

“Mine,” Tony growled, but not before nipping Steve’s lip again, in a move that would have drawn blood if it hadn’t been faked by faking the camera angles. “Unless you ever leave again.”
“Tonight?” Tony asks with a grin, “Well, tonight’s looking great so far. Even if it’s been half an hour and you’re our first interview.”
“Really?” she asks, feigning surprise even though she’s one of the first camped out at the beginning to catch actors. “Surely pictures couldn’t have kept you that long.”
," Natasha sighs, and Tony can't help but agree with her.
"Tall?"
And just when Tony can't be anymore surprised by the fact that Steve sometimes does ballet and tap, he says, "But the salsa! Tango! Samba, rumba, jive, bolero, those are all lively!" His excited face changes into one of amusement when he continues on with, "And then someone at the place I go to tried to tell me that I should learn how to belly dance. I'm starting to wonder if everyone thinks that I don't know what I'm doing."
”—ask me because I’m not talking about this again.”
But since Clint is searching for his hearing aids, she’s forced to turn around and say, “Did you take them out again, you idiotic disaster?” while she signs the ASL translation of that. Tony catches her pinky entending near her forehead upwards in a motion he recognizes with the sheer frequency she uses it towards Clint.
, for the first time. "I wouldn't want to squeeze myself in there."
"Alright, so he doesn't stand out too much, then, in this crowd." Tony realizes that's not a question, so he tacks on, "Right?"
So when the question comes now, in form of an audience member with a gleam in her eyes, Steve doesn’t blush. Or give away anything. Steve has had an answer prepared for a long time, and he isn’t about to ruin it by stammering.
The bartender considers this for a moment, before smirking. “Describe your
"It's not Clint, is it?" Tony asks with a sudden growing horror. "Because Clint knows."
"Well, we are headed towards your bedroom," Steve says as the elevator doors open and he steps in. "For something that's probably better for you than sex."
"That's not an answer," Tony points out stubbornly, following Steve's lead on the waltz (waltz?) as the song style changes.
"The particular shade of his clothes is a little off from anyone else, but many would say it's a fairly common color," Steve says with a complete straight-face, and then Tony remembers two things. A, Steve has really good serum-enhanced eyes, and B, Steve is also an artist, so he knows what to do with all that sensory information.
His eyes land on a man with an impeccably tailored eggplant-colored suit, polished black shoes and amaranthine-tinted glasses that only one person can pull off that well: Tony Stark. Involuntarily, Steve feels his lips curve up into a smile as Tony walks over to him. What a sight for sore eyes he is. And he looks... good. Too good. Steve wants to simultaneously thank and curse Tony’s mysterious tailor for creating works of art. Tony’s suits have always been made out of Steve’s wildest dreams, not that he’s about to let anyone know that. But if Steve’s eyes linger too long on how Tony’s suit perfectly hugs his body and someone will ever catch him, well, he just has an artistic appreciation of fine clothing. Right?
And Captain America hates Tony Stark just as much as Tony Stark despises Captain America.
What makes it worse, is that Tony comes back, backpedaling, and gestures at the camera with a nod to it. “Oh, sorry,” he apologizes. “I didn’t know you were recording. Just cut it out. All of it.”
”Soulmates,” Steve unironically finishes, like he can’t believe it. "You're my soulmate.”
He silently fistpumps to himself, finding something. “Question from itsstarsandstripes, asking where did you, or me, I guess, go for three months, five question marks. I went home, like, Brooklyn home, and I want to say that I’ve been a homebody, but that’s not true. I’ve been working on a new project that’s not seeing the light of day for a few months if we’re lucky, a year or never if not. I shouldn’t be talking about it though, oops. I’d be fired or something if I even breathed a word about what it was. So, shh. Um, and, I’ve caught up on so many books and movies and shows. And—”
Tony wakes up to the strange feeling of sleeping without any covers. He’s also very warm, and there’s a very comfortable pillow right next to him. He opens his eyes and realizes he’s being aggressively cuddled by Steve, with their legs tangled together, Steve’s arms pulling him close to his body, and Tony’s arms hugging Steve’s back. Worse: he’s aggressively cuddling Steve and wishes he doesn’t have to move and get out of bed at all. There’s a strange feeling flooding Tony right now, and he can’t think about anything but this feeling of
, and not
That someone happens to be Steve, wearing light wash jeans that are almost even tighter than anything Tony's seen before and a red button-up that could be anywhere from ruby red to maroon with how the light is hitting it. It is also tight-fitting, but it isn't completely ridiculous, and looks just perfect between showing off those muscles and not. Tony wonders just who is in charge of Steve's wardrobe and his outfit choices, and if he wants to send them a thank you basket for helping him move on from khakis and old man plaid. Then again, maybe
“Pepper,” and now he’s crying, damn it, “I don’t understand.”
to have. I’ve also heard people disagree with Jennifer Walters as the detective who takes my character down. It’s funny, because the first time that she interrogated me in the movie, my character pretends to be cowed and in a state of fear, but I was just a little intimidated. Jen did study law, so.” He shrugs.
“Steve,” another concerned, familiar voice says, and Steve looks at the person next to Tony.
showed up here randomly, asking specifically for me.” The way he says friend, almost like a double entendre, coupled with his previous words of charging money for people finding him, has Tony's mind spinning with possibilities that are all very, very unlikely. And yet, he can't help but think that Rogers's very presence here is unlikely, why not what else he's thinking?
"Fella done you wrong?" Natasha teases huskily as she slides over his drink. She glances over to Steve, who's chatting with Thor about something involving the little cube in his hand. Thor's, not Steve's.
“Is that what you’re calling it?” Steve asks dryly, finding the perfect opening to confirm their relationship. “Wow, you think a guy likes you but suddenly you’re only roommates. Though you know what they say about roommates...” Steve winks suggestively at the camera, knowing the comments are about to blow up.
," Natasha sighs, and Tony can't help but agree with her.
“I don’t know what to feel that you’ve read me this easy, glad or worried since I’m so open, apparently,” Tony tries for levity.
"Are they aware of—”
are you doing here?” Rogers growls, all but trapping Tony, back up against the closest wall from the stairs. The suit just might be a lost cause at this point if the wall is as
"Where did you learn how to dance?" Tony asks, because he's been dying to find out where Captain Save The Dance has had time and the ability to learn. He couldn't ask before, because that would ean admitting that he's been watching Steve dance, but now he can. "You're not half bad."
“We’ve always had good chemistry,” Steve says, before he realizes he’s talked himself into a hole. “At this point, it would be kind of pathetic if we
“It’s pretty clear that you’ve loved the experience,” she says with an amused smile on her face, probably unused to enthuasitic idiots like himself gushing about their jobs like he is right now, even though he should be a seasoned professional. “What about the people you worked with? How did they kind of shape your time on the movie?”
“If the next one doesn’t ask how old Steve is, I’ll be thoroughly disappointed,” Tony says, crossing his fingers as he pulls off the sticker with his other hand. “Is Steve Rogers... Mr. Rogers?” He turns to Steve, raising his eyebrows in question.
"A week ago, Tony. That was a week ago."
It takes a few minutes, but Tony makes it back to the table with a proud smile on his face. He grins and waves it excitedly.
He pauses when footsteps approach his way, fearful that it’s some paparazzi, even if the cemetery itself is closed to those who don’t have a specific person or purpose to visit. Steve hates himself for having to think about that when he has to visit his mother, but it’s one of the few detractors of the life. Not that he has to worry for long, not when a familiar dark cologne washes over him. Feeling himself releasing the sudden pent-up tension, he closes his eyes and hums through a few prayers.
“Alright, we’ve got bellabellavilla asking why I hadn’t prepared a speech for the Oscars after I won the Golden Globe. Actually the worst part was that I did. I had a memorized speech, and just in case I forgot it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper and... I wasn’t joking when I said I, you know, had one ready since I was young.” Steve flicks his hand into the air, as if to dismiss his words in mock annoyance at himself. “And...”
“Again?” Steve asks, taking a step towards Tony. Tony backs by a step accordingly.
”—what did she show
"And that's not the right question," Steve smirks again. "When did I learn to dance, on the other hand..."
"Please," Tony scoffs, because Natasha's eyeing him carefully and in a way that makes him a little nervous.
So Tony sheds off his armor, pulls off the undersuit he had actually managed to put on, and then prepares himself to meet Dr. Bruce Banner, world-renowned scientist who had dropped off the grid a few years ago, last known (at least as far as Tony had dug) as researching the supersoldier serum. Tony wanted to know why, and then pick the 7-PhD-holding scientist’s brain. He smelled the start of an amazing bromance.
Okay, it was okay, he was okay, everything was okay, everyone was okay, okay?
On that list, there are Rhodey, Mama Rhodes (and literally any member of the Rhodes clan), Pepper, and his therapist. That list used to hold Edwin Jarvis, Ana Jarvis, Yinsen, and O-
“If you had to kiss your best friend on screen in front of twenty people who thought it would be funny to watch you stumble a scene, you have to find some humor in it to stop yourself from fucking up the scene in anger,” Steve points out, though he’s never been such a damned liar. There had been no humor in him trying to control his libido during the entire scene, just general lust. The only reason he had started to laugh because Tony and him had finally pulled away and he thought it was just so funny that he had throughly messed Tony up for this one scene. “Oops, can I swear?”
"I'm bored," Tony says. "Entertain me. Let's do 20 questions again."
he had lost it. Fury was basically not at all amused, but then Tony had made a remark about the last time
“We could have done this a lot longer ago if I knew,” Tony says, though his eyes are wide like something has just occurred to him. Good Steve thinks, he better be thinking about that.
Oh, he hasn't lied to himself like this for
“You met Peggy when you were twenty,” Tony says, unimpressed. “And you’re not twenty-eight. Neither is she.”
, Tony wants to say,
that he doesn’t have to even acknowledge it if he doesn’t want to, but maybe he should. He has a voice to use. And he can’t give off the wrong tone by ignoring it; everyone knows that he’s seen it.
"Yeah, I know he does."
He isn't listening, and almost misses the end of the board meeting, had it not been for his mind trying to find an out to this dreadful thing. Tony stands up in joy and practically dashes out the door as dignified as he can. He is completely aware of the fact that he probably doesn't have any, at least not to these people, who have seen all of his public ups and downs. And Pepper, well, she was there for the private ones too.
“No, but, trying to kiss your best friend like you want to crawl into his pants while there are twenty people watching is unsettling. Especially when you’re being judged on if the scene is okay. Spoiler alert, if the scene needs to be better, we were told what to do better,” Steve says, wincing. He’s never forgetting someone yelling at him to all but dry-hump Tony. It may have only happened once, and the context may have been that they told him to dry-hump Tony like all the other scenes, but still. Awful.
Tony gasps dramatically. "Has Steve been holding out on science days with Bruce and I? And just because Bruce is my science boyfriend doesn't mean we're fucking. At least I think we aren't. I would know, right? Yeah, I would."
"Dance is a great workout," Steve recites, and from where Tony doesn't know. "So yes, I'm trying to catch up. Ballet is something, though. Real hard stuff, and I don't have the exact body type for it. Tap is fine, tap is good. Jazz is fun, unless I mess up. That happens a lot." He makes a face at himself.
"You're already tired, and JARVIS won't let you out of your suite or in the reach if anything vaguely interesting until you go to bed."
Tony blinks. He hadn’t expected Steve to ever tell him about HYDRA killing his parents, let alone say it was the Winter Soldier’s doing. He hadn’t expected Steve to sound so apologetic, like it was him who did it. He hadn’t expected to Steve to include Jarvis in there either.
Tony has no clue what to do.
They think he's wrapped up in his own world. They think he doesn't notice things as much as the rest of them, because he's always thinking in his own head. They think he doesn't care. They think that he can't put two and two together when it comes to people and small, hidden details. They aren't entirely wrong, but they aren't entirely right, either. Half the time, he's all dulled senses and enhanced engineering functions but the other half, he's all alert senses and enhanced thinking. With a few people, he's pays attention all the time, because they deserve him at his best, and so much more than he can give them. He tries to pay attention, and he, he hasn't really messed it up much yet, so something must be going right, right?
Steve’s piercing gaze suddenly turns on him, assessing him just like Natasha or Hill would. But unlike them, he isn’t cold or calculating and he isn’t trying to figure out how many ways Tony can be taken down. Steve’s looking for something deeper, and his look sets Tony on a fire that isn’t exactly bad.
That was an answer in itself for how telling it was. "Nineteen forty-something? Thirty-something? It can't be twenty-something, you would have been eleven at best." He pauses.
“Tony?” Pepper confusedly asks, though she sounds worried. “Aren’t you—aren’t you at SHIELD?”
"Yes," Steve says unashamedly. "And don't you dare even ask, because I'm not doing it." Damn, and just when Steve had been entertaining him and his stupid question this night. Tony wanted to press his luck elsewhere.
"Anyone with eyes wants to fuck him in that suit," Clint bluntly says. "But you want to get him every other time too."
“Oh,” Steve says, frowning because he wanted to avoid the question. “I mean. I was raised Catholic. Does that count?”
“I don’t want it,” he says in between loud gasps for air that sound broken to his own ears. “I don’t want it, I just want her back, goddamnit, I want to be happy, not this, I can’t do this, not without her, who am I even kidding, I shouldn’t
“I’m sorry,” he says quietly, so that no one can hear his words. They may plaster his slumped form on every tabloid, but they will never get his words if he can’t help it. “I haven’t come here in a while; I haven’t talked to you in a while. It hurts, ma, I wish you were here with me right now. I’m sorry. I don’t know know how you did it when Dad died, and you loved him just as much as I do you. It hurts, ever since you died and it’s never gone away. How did you do it? How did you deal with losing everyone, because I can’t even handle missing you for a day. It’s been four years and it hurts.”
,” Tony says, rolling his eyes.
OKAY SO MAYBE THIS IS ME SHAMELESSLY WRITING STEVE AND TONY AS THEIR REAL-LIFE ACTORS BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT I SHIP STONY NOT RDJ AND CHRIS. :)
He laughs self-deprecatingly, wiping the last of his tears off his face and hoping he doesn’t look splotchy. “She’s not here and all I can think is how much I wish I told her that she’s the reason I’m here, the reason I’ve made it this far. Five years ago, on this day, she received a cancer diagnosis, stage four. On the date nominations came out this year, but four years back, she died. And I wonder to this day if she knew what she meant to me. A lot of you voted for me to receive this Oscar, but I have one more thing to ask of all of you, regardless of who you are. Everyone has one person that matters the most to them, and if you don’t, you will one day. Tell them, show them,
But thanks to Steve, his work wife Pepper, his science husband Bruce,  his best friend Rhodey, and even Happy (because Steve pulled out all the stops, even after Tony tweaked JARVIS to stop Steve just for tonight) Tony was forced to go to sleep last night. And worst of all, tonight, Tony's kind of thankful he did. Even if Tony spent the first half an hour lying in bed wondering what kind of a relationship name Happy should have. Security bro? Hmm, he is going to have to ask Happy about that.
are you doing here?”
Loki was a son of a bitch, and it was a good thing he was adopted, since Thor’s mom sounded like she was the exact opposite of a petty bitch. The fight against him was easy (at least to Tony, even if Cap had been struggling) and subduing him was even easier. Of course, Thor had to come and put a dent in things, but it was still straightened out. Everything was okay.
Steve huffs another laugh, another expelling of air that makes him feel like he’s breathing for the first time, suctioning air in and out of his lungs. It’s shaky, and unsure of everything.
“Depends,” Tony responds, downing a third in one shot. “I was looking for a friend, but maybe trouble’s what I want.”
"Well, the only two people left I can't really see are you and me, and it can't be you, and it can't be—”
The man is punctual and planned and prepared and perfect and quick-thinking and responsive and responsible and reliable and strategic and serious and everything else that falls in that basket of a perfect soldier. Fury loves him, especially since he shows up to every single meeting/debriefing and actually does his paperwork, extensively. He doesn't miss a single work-related details and really doesn't stop working. On the rare occasion he's not working, Rogers is seemingly moping in SHIELD-assigned apartment that's incredibly pathetic.
”And I’m offering,” Tony says. “This is not an ultimatum for you to choose him or me. I don’t think either of us would like what that answer would have been, no matter which side you would have picked.

He winks at Tony lavishly, and then they part ways, with Steve going to find a new dance partner, and Tony finding someone new to schmooze. Though really, they're both doing the same thing. "You have eleven questions left."
There it is again, the oddly dry look that Steve gives Tony that Tony can't understand. "
Tony spends the next weeks hiding from Steve every time Steve wears tight clothing, but he definitely does
“You’re a damned liar,
“You have any secrets I should know about?” Tony quips, staring at the room in Clint’s house that he was to share with Steve. As if the world wasn’t fucked enough already for him, without this torturous situation. As if Clint wasn’t laughing his ass off about the one room, one bed situation that he had put them in.
“Steve Rogers, was that a dirty joke?” Tony asks.
”You've known and you—you haven’t said anything and,” Steve tries to say. “Tony, you’ve been
