When they were at SHIELD, of all places.
It seemed like ages, him sitting there, alone with nothing but with the whirring of machines and the dry sound of his own breathing.  In actuality, it was only minutes until another man strode into the room, one he didn’t recognize.
So as to why he found himself, now weeks later, talking to Nick about the new Mad Max movie they’d gone to see (separately, and well, that was somewhat unfortunate, really), Tony had no explanation.  Again.
“No!  I’m just saying.  She wasn’t that kind of woman, and you just seem to talk about her all the time, and it honestly baffles me.”
“You’re a good man, JARVIS” he was nearly there, the train was nearly steady on the tracks, nearly there, just-
It was at Park Street where the real nostalgia began -- not that Tony was a nostalgic person, or at least he never thought he was.  What did he have to be nostalgic about?  His childhood?  His early failures as an engineer?  The mess of his media life that was 2004?
When blue eyes met his, his heart dropped straight through and he could’ve sworn his arc reactor failed on him because Steve was looking at him and he looked so disappointed and that was so much worse than anger, it really was.
In the back of his mind, however, a voice was screaming at him, telling him that this was a trap, that he needed to get out, get out of the grove, out of Faron Woods and into the village.  A larger, greater part of Steve, however, a part that seemed almost supernatural, beckoned him towards the sword, begging him to grasp the hilt in his hand, to pull it out of the stone slab….
Doctor Doom still sent out his bots to wreak havoc on New York, low level supervillains created giant mutant moose or flying robotic slugs or whatthefuckever.  But there were no alien invasions, no visits from Loki.  Just your average, daily superheroing.
“Can I not help you anymore?”  And fuck, his voice was so broken, and Tony wanted to crawl into the other man’s arms and wish all the demons away but this isn’t some fairytale, and life isn’t always kind.
There were classier men (or men pretending to be classier, anyway) at the bar, making awkward small talk with one another as they eyed the scarcely clad ladies that sauntered around.  It was so typical, really, the whole setup, but it sure as hell beat a gala.  Oh god did it.
With significantly less grace, his muscles still stiff and sputtering in shock, Steve nearly fell from his horse, scraping himself against the grainy forest floor.  Without hesitation, he gathered himself and began climbing the rocks of the forest ledge.  Years of climbing trees for fun with Bucky when they were younger didn’t do much to bulk him up, but it definitely helped him develop some sense of agility to match his light frame.  He was able to pull his light body up the rocks, even if it was with a great amount of difficulty.  If it weren’t for the pure, harsh anger coursing through his veins, his efforts would most likely have been all for not.
Steve didn’t pause from packing his small duffle bag, he just merely asked, “who?”
He remembers seeing the name light up the New York sky for the first time.  Remembers thinking the building was ugly, obtrusive, unnecessary.  But that was before...before everything.
hard, c’mon….”
and his heart was doing this funny thing, this really funny thing and Tony had to run down to the lab to see if the arc reactor was malfunctioning because fuck.  Fuck.
He was about to doze off again, when the door to his hospital room was all but slammed open, the rest of the Avengers marching in.  Well, Steve marched in, the others just walked in.  Like normal fucking people.
Steve nods, again, because what else can he do but nod?  What can he say?
The man gestured to himself, cocking his head slightly.  “As you can see, I’m fit as a fiddle.  I admit perhaps I should’ve had JARVIS clarify that, but it was minor detail.”
“Yes, you’re right, you need to leave.  But please, be safe.  He’s not worth more than you are.  You know that.”
keep the baby, she knew it wasn’t right.  With no husband and nowhere near the funds that Howard had, she knew the child wouldn’t grow up right, wouldn’t grow up properly.
make things right, it was his only chance of Tony not just brushing off his apology like he always does with people. This was bigger than that, and he needed to figure out why that was.
“Yeah, well…”
C’mon, answer me here, don’t tell me--c’mon!”
“I told my Ma I was coming home!  I already--”
Well fuck.
“I was just worried Tony, we’re
that it makes his chest ache and his eyes sting and his heart aches oh it aches it aches it aches because how could Steve ever think that he could ever would ever deserve Tony because Tony is a better man than Steve could ever hope to be and Steve never gave him enough credit not then now now not ever and Tony is just so so so everything that Steve ever wanted to be everything that Steve
They told him he was under for nearly two weeks.  They didn’t need to tell him why.
“I do.”
Tony wakes up warm, almost too warm, from a very blissful dreamless sleep.  It’s been getting better, these past few months and Tony knows that the nightmares aren’t going to go away completely, aren’t going to stop forever, but whatever little relief he can grasp onto, he’ll take.
Because fuck if Tony could even swallow a single pill now, what with his throat shriveling up and his hands shaky and clumsy and he was tired, so so so tired of being alone and worthless and afraid and a coward, such a coward, always a coward, always a--
Tony was blabbing on about the new Kevlar for his suit, practically bouncing into his lab with Steve trailing behind, urging Jarvis to pull up the specs as he ushered Steve over towards his desk–
“Tony Stark, humble?  I’d never thought I’d see the--”
This was bad, this was really bad, he couldn’t keep doing this, it was going to tear him apart, Steve was going to tear him apart and his chest hurt and ached and his head was pounding and his limbs felt tingly and fuck it, fuck it.
At that, the other man chuckled, abrupt and stiff.  “You’re right, she was her own woman in every sense.”
Fuck.  Of course he wasn’t fucking wrong.  It was obvious, even.
It’s seconds, minutes, hours later when Steve comes back to himself, is able to breathe, breathe without an ache in his chest, without fire in his lungs.  Natasha is still there, staring at the...at the arm,
The next morning, when Steve and Tony padded down to the commonfloor, Tony swimming in one of Steve’s SSR shirts, things almost felt normal.  Almost.
“He’s always there.”
He decided to hold the meeting in his SI office, because there was no way he was going to SHIELD, where Garner was staying, for this shit, and taking him up to the personal floors seemed to make the whole thing a little too real.
Thor was scowling now, however, eyes glaring into an empty box of Pop Tarts.  “Who would dare eat the last of my toaster pastries?!” he shouted, looking from Steve to Tony with fuming pupils.
But why would they
Steve however, only rolled his eyes.  “Ha ha ha, Clint, you’re a riot.”
“Of course it’s good, it’s a movie about me,” Tony smirked.  Then paused, scrunching up his nose slightly.  “Well, if I was poor.”
“Yes, I’m sorry, I really am.  How I acted in your lab, I shouldn’t have gotten so upset.  Peggy, she meant so much to me.  But she never
Tony took in a deep breath, and waited.  Waited, it seemed, for years to crawl by around the Earth, and he wanted to scream, wanted to punch something wanted to--
In Tony’s defense, he lasted longer than he expected.  He thought the bar scene might get him, but he’d been fine throughout that.  It was the therapy scene that got him, that first really intense one and it kind of caught him off guard, and his hands went clammy and his vision narrowed and

“Tony, where are you?”
But oh god, did he want.

, you can’t be dependent on alcohol or drugs or sex, or Steve.  Because if you can’t learn to help yourself, then how can you ever accept the fact that you deserve to be happy?  How can you help yourself be happy?”
“Hi, I’m Steve Rogers, it’s nice to meet you.”
Again, he ran.
Bruce was hovering over him, which was odd considering Tony’s lab usually made the man too anxious, and preferred the quiet order of his own.  Tony’s was apparently
Tony knew it wasn’t going to last.  It never did, for he didn’t deserve someone like Steve, not even for his friendship.
“I apologize,” one of the nurses cut in, his face stern as he turned towards the Avengers, “but I need to ask you all to leave while we finish looking him over.”
“He says that if you do not allow him access, he will break down the windows himself.”
And with that, Bucky snatched his own bag from his bedside, fumbling to pull his jeans on as he ran out the door.
“Yes?”
“God fucking dammit…” Tony muttered under his breath.  He couldn’t deal with this, this suffocating silence right now.  He pried himself off the couch, making a beeline for the elevator, with Steve right behind him.
“Oh.  Well, me casa is you casa...or something.”
sleep, not as much as the average human, then by Clint and Thor who came running whenever food was involved.  Bruce just kind of came on his own, followed by Nat, after figuring out where everyone was huddled at two in the morning.
At that, Clint eyed him for a moment, until his mouth turned into a wide, snarky grin.  “Sure thing, Cap!  Alright, movie, yeah?”
No, before the Battle, he would never reminisce.  He was an inventor; he moved forward, not backwards.  He looks ahead, he strived for change.
It’d only taken him six episodes to figure that out, but like Steve had said, he was
“In New York?”
Instead he rushed through the misty woods, dodging vines and tree branches, hopping over rocks and through allies and caves until finally they reached a dead end, Steve finding himself in a circular clearing, tall pines and billowing oaks towering over him, the sunlight seeping through the cracks in the natural canopy.
And sure, he was a bit jealous, of course he was.  Even once he was calm, once he realized he’d hurt Tony, the burning ache of jealousy was still lingering in the back of his mind.  Because even if he and Peggy didn’t work out, she was still one hell of a woman, and he wanted to work alongside her.  Perhaps he would’ve been by her side when SHIELD formed, when they finished destroying the last of the Hydra camps.  He would’ve liked that, he really would’ve.
“What, why?  I mean, yeah, I think so.”
“I’m...I’m happy he’s doing good, I’m happy he’s keeping busy.”
Fuck.
“Pep!  Pepper!  Light of my life, have you missed me?”
“Harsh,” he muttered, trying to sit up and instantly regretted it.  Pain was still sharp in his ribs, along with his shoulders.
Again, Steve shook his head.  “It’s not that.  I just,” he sighed, not knowing exactly how to phrase it.  Trying to say it out loud made him realize how ridiculous he had been when he’d said all that stuff to Tony.  What, he was jealous because Tony had some pictures of Peggy on his desk?
Perhaps he should talk to Wanda.  Perhaps she would understand, considering what happened between her and Vision.
Holding them up, he turned to Bucky, who was currently watching Netflix on his Macbook.  “Buck, are these yours?”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you didn't.  Tony has a tendency to blow things out of proportion.”
The man - Garner - chuckled, leaning back in his chair.  Tony stifled a sigh; he really wasn’t in the mood for this.  Any of this.
-----
“You know what to do, right?  The message, back at the tower?”
And because he was Tony Fucking Stark, he did the first logical thing he could think of, which was to jump out the goddamn window.
And he was gone.  And Tony was okay, because couples were apart, and it was normal, and all Tony wanted was to feel normal for five fucking seconds, and he would be okay.
At that, Tony didn’t answer.
He laid there for what felt like ages, the room quiet except for the two men’s breathing.  Eventually, Tony cracked an eye open, squinting up at Steve who was perched at the edge of the bed, staring down at Tony.  Rolling his eyes, Tony threw back the covers, beckoning Steve forward with his finger.
It read, complete with a picture of just that, a pair of plain dark pants.
God, no.  Tony knew boundaries.  Well, alright, perhaps that was an overstatement.  But he tried to respect boundaries--especially when it came to Cap, after what happened before the Battle.
Really.  Really really.
“It baffles you.”  Tony deadpanned.
Before he could duck out the door, however, he felt a firm hand yank at his arm, and he was then face to face with Steve, blue eyes boring into his brown.  Eyes with a glimmer of something, something so similar to what he’d seen the night before, what he’d seen as Steve pulled him in, Tony firm against his chest….
He also found it to be really shady, and downright dishonest.  So.
“Then why didn’t you repulse yourself back up?”
So that’s why everything felt so….different.  Bigger.  Taller.
Of course, because the universe hated him, Tony’d managed to run out of coffee in his lab that day, and needed to retreat upstairs to obtain the substance.
“I was
Tony looked up, and nearly choked on his breath when he saw Steve’s face--hollow, strained, confused.
“Farore, Nayru and Din,” Steve breathed, and he supposed it was appropriate to thank the goddesses for this, since there was no one else who could’ve given him such a gift.
Well...that’s not true.  He knows some things would be different, and he hopes that other things would be better.
No one said anything after that, and he drifted off into a dreamless sleep.
Maybe.
“He’s doing good, you know.  He’s better.”
He began to miss other things, too.  Like Tony, sleep deprived and disheveled, shuffling up from the workshop, muttering equations and algorithms to himself as he poured himself a cup of coffee.  He missed mildly shocking Tony when he understood one of his pop culture references, or knew how to operate his phone, or post tweets.
Again.
Pepper was crying now, obviously trying to hold back the tears, but it was no use.  She sobbed into a clump of tissues she’d plucked from his bedside table.  Tony didn’t know what to say, so he just sat there in silence, soaking up her tears.
And he was muttering soft assurances into Tony’s ear and he didn’t know why, didn’t know why until Tony realized he was shaking and silent tears were streaking his face and he was so pathetic, he really was.  First drunk and now sober, Steve had seen him at his worst and-
“Isn’t that what you’re here to find out?” Tony questioned, and the other man let out a soft laugh.
Again, he laughed, and it didn’t bother Tony, it didn’t, because Tony was worth more than Tiberius Fucking Stone, in both brains and bills.  It didn’t matter, none of this mattered.
Steve made something of a small grunt, and pulled away slightly.  Tony nearly whined at the loss.
“--eve, Steve!”
Or well, he hoped, for Tony had only managed to crumple atop the couch of his apartment when the elevator dinged again, a very distressed Captain walking out.
Did they make envelopes that big?  Hmm.
“Tony,
What they were all risking.

why he should care, but that was a cruel, cruel joke in and of itself.  Just because of some stupid name, he had to watch his every move, had to do this and do that and
Well okay, that wasn’t true.  His desk was really a mess of wires, electronics, and hand tools, but the only photographs were those of Peggy.
“Hey, who’s side are you on?” Tony shouts, waving his fist at nothing.  Steve merely shook his head.
He managed to make it to the top, pumping his sore legs along as he raced towards where the man was standing.  Standing, not running, as if he was waiting for him…
“What?” Tony snapped, glaring through his black eye at Clint as the elevator came to a stop on Tony’s floor.  The doors opened, but neither of them moved to get out.  “You spew the biggest sacks of bullshit around here, and yet you can’t take it?  Maybe I don’t want to fucking tell you, alright?  Maybe it’s fucking private?  Jesus Christ.”
“No!” Steve shrieked, arms reaching out in vain as the man caught up to Bucky, who had tried to make his escape too little too late, having been paralyzed in his own fright.  With strength only to be matched by the goddesses, he scooped Bucky up, throwing him over his shoulder and making a break for the village.
His celebration was short lived, however, for he then realized he was alone in the bathroom at the Pierre and had knocked
The car battery, the fucking car battery.  It was going to kill him, the damned thing, he needed to get out, he needed to get

, to be shocked by her sudden presence behind him.
and maybe, maybe he still is because he’s crying into his ratty sweatshirt, soaked through and through with blood and salt and cracks in his ribs and metal crunching against his torn and beaten skin and his name being slurred drunkenly from his father’s lips, blood on Yinsen’s lips and despair on Pepper’s and pain on Steve’s--
That would make this real.  That would make his desperation real.  He knows what happened with Natasha, but that feels...like a lapse in his psyche.  Like a misstep.  Knowingly admitting to someone how he feels about Tony, admitting to his guilt...that would make everything too real.
Silence.
Steve looked at him, a look filled with emotions Tony couldn’t even begin to decipher in the state he was in.  After a moment, Steve nodded, walking across the grand room to pull up a chair to the side of the bed.
“Lame.”
Tony buried his head into his hands, knowing and not caring that he was smothering his face in the motor oil he’d failed to wash off from his earlier tinkering.  It didn’t matter; it didn’t matter how he looked because he kept fucking up and he didn’t know what to do about it or how to fix it and he blamed Howard, he really honestly truly did because without him he wouldn’t have been in this mess and maybe he would never have been born, but of course he had because Howard needed a heir for his stupid company, and-
Tony was mocking him.
“Keep doing reckless stunts without warning...without warning the team!  You could’ve gotten yourself killed, Tony.  We have a plan, and if you’re going to stray from it, you need to tell someone.  And then, you need to actually think about what you’re doing!”
Oh, this was going to be fun.
Driven out of his own lab by his own, stupid mouth.  How pathetic.
He sighed, wrapping his arms tighter around Tony.  “I...I thought you were better.  I thought we were fixing this, I thought I…”
Hey, it was his actual voicemail, after all.
And he was being hugged.  If you could call it that, since it was really just Steve wrapping his arms around Tony, chin resting atop his shoulder and his arms were so warm, so warm and strong and oh so good so good so so so.
The next two months passed rather uneventfully.  Well, uneventfully for Avengers standards.
there, muscles.”
“Miles, it’s been ages!  And my my, are you happy to see me or is that a fat stack of benjamins you got there….Oh wait!”
It was easy to think that he was getting better, when Steve was there.  Steve was….Steve was something else.  He was too good to Tony, too kind and understanding.  Perhaps more than Tony deserved, considering the way Tony treated him.
The prince’s voice faded out as soon as the phrase
Tony shook his head, holding up his hand as to cut him off.  “Do you know how hard it is to get an official fake ID?  This license was printed at a DMV and it’s total bullshit.  You know how much I had to pay to get this?”
The other man’s face didn’t waver.  “No, I don’t.”
Tony sighed, rubbing over his eyes with his fists.  He didn’t need this, he didn’t need the guilt of what could’ve been, he didn’t need that.  He knew he was terrible for it, for doing what he did, couldn’t they just understand that and let him be?  At least for five fucking minutes, after he’d woken up alive instead of six feet under?
Clint blinked.  “Oh, okay.”
Steve shakes his head, sliding his back down the window into a slump on the floor.  Natasha follows in suit, leaning into his side.
“When I’m dead, Cap, you’ll get some of my money.  I’ve got it split between Pep, Rhodey, and the rest of you guys.  And Happy too.  You’ll get a suit, too.  Just don’t let Hammer get the damned thing, because I swear if you guys let him or AIM or anyone get my shit, I’ll haunt all of you until-”
Tony chuckled weakly to himself, proceeded by a dragged out silence.
“Penthouse, JARVIS.” Steve said as they stepped into the elevator.
Tony winced.  The chatter on the train was at a minimum, and he was sure Steve heard that.
Cap didn’t say anything when Tony emerged from the lab, and for that he was thankful.  He gave him a bit of a once over, but that wasn’t unwarranted, for he was sure that his appearance was less than desirable.  Not that he, uh, cared.  At all.  Obviously.
“Stop.”
“The freshman at NYU will just
At least she hopes.
Natasha turns to him.  “I’m sure he suspects.  He is a genius, as much as it doesn’t show sometimes.
Right?
“Doesn’t seem like a very healthy thing.”
However emotionally stunted he was or could be, he couldn’t deny that this soft, throbbing hum in his chest, that coursed throughout his entire being, was anything but-
Fuck.
… but not tonight.  Not now.  Now….he just wanted to get home.
-----
And it was the same thing with Peggy.
What he wants to say is
“I know, but I need to.  I need to explain myself better.”  The other man said nothing, and Steve figured it was as good a cue as anything to continue.  He’d been feeling such a mix of emotions the past week that it was a struggle to control his words, to not just let everything spill out.  But he steadied himself, gathered himself, and trudged on.  “It was irrational of me to immediately assume that you were trying to mock me about Peggy.  But I didn’t realize what she was to you, and I didn’t know how truly...wrong my words were because of it.  So I did my own digging, because I knew I had to fix this.”
drunk he might’ve made some curtain drapes joke, but uh.  No.  Not today.
-----
“I’m good,” Tony nodded, lips curling into a small smile.  “I really am.”
It’s expensive, he can tell.  Similar to the ones Tony always wears.
He mustered up his best smile for her, and she nodded.  It was going to be hard but she knew that, of course she did.  It’s been hard for the last eight years, and if this had been any other gala, he wouldn’t keep going.  But honestly, it was his most important one.
Tony’s words came to a stuttering halt as he turned towards the other man.  “Uh, what?”
“I, uh, think I have something that belongs to your friend.”
“I…Okay.  Okay.  I’m sorry things got so messed up, but I can help you, I can, I’ll try, I really will.”
He was fucked and he was in love with a guy; a guy who he knew took on too many clients at once and never got enough sleep and liked to pretend he hated it when kids came into the shop with their parents but really he loved it, loved the kids, really, and he that he knew Sebastian lost his parents at a young age and he claimed it didn’t affect him but it did, it really did, and Steve knew how he took his coffee and his favorite midnight snacks and how he knew of countless TV shows and movies despite claiming to have no time to watch anything because he was always so busy, too busy, but for Steve (Nick, it was Nick) he’d make time, of course he would because Sebastian was Sebastian and Steve was so in love with him it hurt, it ached, it was too much, too too much.
Tony awoke with a start; everything flooding back to him all at once.  Bright light in his eyes, harsh beeping in his ears, the pressure of an IV in his arm.
But he was tired, so, so tired, that he let Steve curl around him, drifting off to sleep with the soft weight of the other man pressing against his back.
He let the team disperse to do whateverthefuck (seriously, he had no idea what they did at these things….well except Thor, who talked to anything with a pulse and drank his way through half the bar).
And then…?
“A mission.”
“Three days.”
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Also if anyone's wondering the title of this fic is from
“What is this?” he murmured, his voice muffled by Steve’s heaving chest.
“Yeah, I...we’re meeting here.”
A gentle hand falls onto his shoulder, and he sighs into it.  “I know, Steve, but you need to give him time.”
“Cut?!  Tony, you’re not-”
Steve couldn’t help himself.  “Doombots invading Time Square, busy?”
Clint gave a hoot of victory, a wicked grin slung across his face.  “Sweet, I’ve always wanted to live in a billionaire's tower with the most advanced tech available at my whim.”
Tony cut himself off, because Steve was laughing; a loud, wild, mad cackle, his head thrown back, chest shaking.  Tony narrowed his eyes.
Until they moved in together.
So he ran, and, nope, arc reactor was fine.  Maybe he was just dying, plain and simple.  Huh.
He did leave Steve with a bit of a briefing on her (not a formal SHIELD file, as he’d done with the rest of the Avengers), mentioning her brother and niece.  And that was nice, that was good.  She was glad she had them, and she was glad she was able to move on past his death, to continue on with her own life.
by Panic! At the Disco
They didn’t ask him why he was there, though.  Tony figured they had someone else for that.
Maybe even his own.
But it was just flirting, really.  Flirting was harmless, flirting was what people
“Tony?
And while she knew she
Steve nodded, jamming his hands into his pockets.  He could feel Tony searching his face but he couldn’t bring himself to meet his eyes.  “We never even, well, dated.  Just a kiss in the heat of it all.  I didn’t know it was going to be a one way mission when I jumped onto that plane but I...I figured it might be.  And she just meant so much to me.  Still does.”
He even missed the things he once found annoying about Tony.  He found himself missing the jokes that used to set him off, whether it be about his age, or years under the ice, or anything else.  The time apart made Steve more aware of how the jokes were just a part of Tony.  He didn’t mean any real harm, that was just how Tony Stark
Funny how this kept happening.  Hilarious.  Fucking hilarious.
“You thought you saved me.”
What.  “
After a moment of Tony not reciprocating the hug, Steve gave a soft sigh and pulled himself away.
In retrospect, Steve should’ve stopped to consider what exactly that interaction meant, because really, it was odd.  But at that moment, he was so concerned with getting the
And Steve had no means of defense besides his horse and his weak stature.
“Everything I could find.”
Well...that’s not true.  He knows some things would be different, and he hopes that other things would be better.
The views are different, so that’s something.
He’d tried once to enter the lab, one day after their conversation, but when he’d found his normal access codes denied he didn’t try to override it, and didn’t try again later.  Taking Tony’s earlier advice of giving the man space was probably the best idea.  But he couldn’t help himself from trying, just once.
Steve’s phone buzzed.  He checked it.  Looked at Tony.  Blinked.  Looked back at his phone.  Looked at Tony.
When Tony eventually spoke his voice was quiet and his tone almost trembling, as if he were struggling to speak at all.  Steve listened with rapt attention but his eyes didn’t leave the bolded words in front of him.  “I didn’t know she was my mother until right before she passed.  She was always there for me, as much as she could be--which was still more than my dad was, but that’s, ah.”  He paused, clearing his throat.  “Anyways, she was always there for me, but I knew here as my aunt, not my mother.  I loved my mother dearly, and when I found out the truth it didn’t cloud the memories of my mother in any way.  I loved them both, I
“And when Steve isn’t there?”
“Yeah.”
“Okay, what did you do?”
As soon as the ladies caught on to his motives, they strode off again towards the men jabbering over their poker match, drunkenly shouting at the bartender for another round.
“Of course I am!”
Tony shifted in his bed, slipping further under the covers.  “So you take orders from a dead man, huh?”
“Yeah Cap, you rang?”  He still didn’t look towards the man.
“Try to kill myself by swallowing a bottle of pills?”
It wasn’t something Peggy regretted, but she regretted how it happened.
Clint stole a piece before the pasta had even set and cooled, burning his tongue and mouth but swearing black and blue that it was worth it.  When everyone had settled in, though, it was Bruce who said, “I honestly was afraid when I heard you were in the kitchen, Tony, but this is great.”
Tony only sighed, because he was tired, tired of this, of everything, so so so so
Steve of course, had his own issues.  But it was always Steve enveloping Tony in his arms, whispering soothing sounds into his ear as he shuddered through a panic attack.  It was always Steve who would listen to Tony as he screamed in rage, how he was worthless, how he deserved to die.
What they were all risking.
Tony narrowed his eyes.  The quip was not undeserved, but it was unexpected.  “Uh, that doesn’t sound very
“Tony?  Tony are you really not going to answer me?”
But there was this thing.  And despite his best efforts to shove it back into the bottom of his skull, it bothered Steve.  Really, really bothered him.
as Fury had put it when he’d asked about her family.
It was the next day, when he was watching some old black and white film with Natasha, when it happened again.
Tony was out within the hour, and when he woke up, Steve was still there, snoring gently.
“Y’know, in the gym and shit.  Why are you always working out at two in the morning?  Can’t sleep, huh?  Need to get some tension out, yeah?  Same damn thing, Steve.  You take it out by hitting shit, and I take it out by drinking.
It was everywhere (or at least that’s what it seemed like it to Steve) that Tony would be reminded of Peggy, and he would just have to go out of his way to tell Steve, because that was appropriate, right?  Whether it was a dress that Tony thought she would’ve loved, or her favorite bottle of wine, or her favorite place to eat on the Upper East Side–and eventually, it seemingly clicked inside Steve’s rattled head.
Clint was lounged across the couch on the common floor of the tower, offering Tony his best shit eating grin when Tony walked into the room in a surprisingly clean shirt and pair of jeans.  Tony, of course, offered the archer his own.
“Tony, I’m worried about you.”
He sighed, watching the college kids and businessmen and women hop on and off; some frantic, some relaxed, most of them with ears hooked up to a phone or iPod.
The topic of conversation changed, but Steve couldn’t get it off of his mind, that Peggy was there, there with Tony, and got to spend that time with him that Steve never got.
“You weren’t the party this weekend were you?”  The man’s grin was absolutely shit eating now, curling mischievously at the corners as his eyes shone impossibly brighter.  “I’d say I wouldn’t forget a face like that, but really, I think it’s those arms that I wouldn’t forget.  What was it?  Football, wrestling?  Maybe baseball?”
It was shabby, it was obscene, it was well, vulgar.
And sure, Steve had felt like the Avengers were his family, too.  But Tony…
“What, did you get lost down there?  Couldn’t figure out how to use the elevator?”
At that, Howard says nothing, he simply steps out of the room.
-----
Steve sighs, rising from the edge of the bed.  “Are you going to see him today?”
Tony didn’t even want to think about trying to decipher which it was, not with his pounding head.
He whipped his head around, and the sight he saw made his heart sputter.  Steve was holding the costume, unfolded, gazing at the thing with amused eyes.
right now), did what any sane man would do, and sent him a DM.
Again, Tony sighed.  Steve didn’t sound annoyed, not really.  Verging on frustrated maybe, but not annoyed.  Tired, he sounded tired, and Tony couldn't figure out why.  Sure, he was in Boston, who fucking cared?  And so what if he didn’t tell anyone, he didn’t need a babysitter; he was a full grown man and didn’t need to check in whenever he was leaving.
Tonight, he had a show to perform.  Because tonight he wasn’t Tony Stark: Iron Man, Avenger, Genius Eccentric Engineer.  No, tonight he was Tony Stark: Philanthropist, Schmoozer, ‘Darling’ of the Media, Playboy Flirt.
“Jesus, Stark, what the fuck?”
“Fuck off, Barton.  Don’t you have eggs to lay or something?”
Tony reeled.  What?  What the fuck?
Shit.
them both.  But I wouldn’t be who I am without Peggy, I know that for sure.”
“Did he, like, say anything?”
Was Steve
Oh, shit.
.  He really is, on his tombstone it'll read
“...What actually happened to me?”  Steve remembered running after Bucky.  The cloaked man on the horse.  The sacred woods, the sword and then....
Mind racing, he collapsed onto his bed, rubbing his hands through his hair.  College was weird.
But doing so over a fake account was much, much easier than he’d expected.  Hell, it was too easy.
It didn’t matter, though.  It really didn’t.  Being a billionaire meant you could do whatever the fuck you wanted.  Right?
He nodded absently, flipping open the folder as he began to read through it.  One of the first things he saw, however, made his breath catch in his throat.
“Oh, god,
“So, Tony, tell me about yourself.”
to see he finishes inside his own head, because really, what could it be?  There’s no note, no letter attached.  The box is big enough to contain some sort of gun, but what use would Steve have for a gun, and why would Tony send him one?  The only other thing he can think of his some sort of new uniform, but even that is a stretch.
He scanned the room; Natasha nodded, firm but not unkind.  The others, however, seemed to only be looking at each other.
this was supposed to be different, it really was, really and honestly and--
Well...maybe that’s not true.  They’ve all had a lot of time to recover since the Incident, and really think about what they all did, really think through it all.  Sam was furious once Steve and Bucky had returned from Siberia, but once Steve had explained everything to Sam, he was...more understanding, in a way.  Just as Steve had been.
Maybe things really could get better.
Gasping, his eyes flickered open, just to see a handful of worried expressions meet his gaze.  Bruce had the fucking
And well, to be fair.
and Tony’s hard on had vanquished because remembering what went down nine years ago was just too much and-
Laying in bed at five in the morning with Steve snoring softly beside him, he knows Steve is just his lover, not his saviour.
“Don’t worry, Cap, once I bite the dust, you’ll get some.”
Sometimes he’d come down, just himself and his sketchbook, and they’d work in this sorta comfortable silence that, well.  Tony never had anything like that, really.
Steve isn’t used to this.  Ever since he stepped into that metal coffin and came out a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier, he’s been in the eye of the media, one way or another.  And it was fine, is fine, to an extent.  But this?  Having to hide, having to operate in complete secrecy, knowing that the government is breathing down his back?  He wishes things were different.
He promised
Steve didn’t regret leaving, but it was clear that he’d definitely missed something.  It was early Monday morning when Steve returned to Boston University.  He’d managed to catch the earliest bus, and taken the T right to campus.  So when he’d reached his floor that morning, he wouldn’t be surprised if the flyer he was gaping at was just a figment of his sleep deprived state.
“Hey!  Hey, were you--oh, well
He rolled his eyes and tried to get to his feet.  Now that he really was conscious, he could feel the relentless throbbing in his head, and the sharp sting of pain that wrapped around his torso.
, but what came out instead was “I punched Ty across the face because he’s a fucking dick and said I like to swim in semen.”
“Maria, please.  We just need to speak to Fury.”
As soon as he caught Steve out of the corner of his eye, he stopped his rant dead halt.  Slowly, his eyes travelled from Steve’s own pleading blue ones, down to the folder in his hand.
Probably.
“When was the last time you slept?”
Tony thought it was hilarious.  He’d even gone so far as to make a Twitter, which was completely unnecessary, but still hilarious.  Pepper’s feelings weren’t exactly mutual, but Tony was still alive.  So.
“Do you love me?”
Of course he does.
Tony didn’t know if it was the booze, the insomnia, or the erratic thumping in his heart that caused him to do it, but as Steve was about to leave, Tony reached out and grabbed his hand.  Steve turned back to him, mild shock playing across his face.
to me.  She never belonged to anyone.”
Throughout the drive, he tried to ignore the pain in his head, his face, his ribs, his knees.  He tried to ignore the fact that it was what he needed, what he wanted.  Why he’d gone to the damn place at all.
What did it matter?  He’d been in worse situations before.  It just didn’t matter.
More lube was added and a second finger entered, electing a moan from Tony.  He grasped his fingers into the man’s shaggy hair, closing his eyes as he let the man invade him.
Well.
And if Steve kept shooting Tony looks, he didn’t notice.  Nope, nada, definitely not.
-----
“Wow, Steve,” Tony said, a smirk playing at the edge of his lips despite himself.  “A low blow, but uh, you do realize I could buy out Keurig at least 5 times, right?”
“--People, and yes, there’s no place safer for him right now.  His friend was never the goal, he was just the bait, but now that the swords been drawn, he’s not after bait anymore.”
Tony rolled his eyes.  “What are you, Captain Obvious, yeah?”
Fuck.
“Well,” Tony grinned, patting Steve on the back, “I suppose that’s enough uh, team bonding for one day, whaddya say?”
He spun around, the hands on his shoulder falling in mild shock.  “For once?  I’ve let you in, I’ve let you in so many times, so many more than I ever meant to, than I ever should’ve--”
At that, Tony said nothing.
Steve awoke with a strangled gasp, immediately jerking upright.  His breath was labored, his entire body sore from...from…
“He’s
Steve frowned.  “My name is Steve, actually, but--”
But some things, well.  Some things don’t change for the better.
“Tony what’s with the noise, where are you?  Are you on a train?”
At least at his office, he could pretend it was just another meeting.  He hated them both just the same.
pulled his head away.
And then there was Tony.
“Hey, Steve right?  You need something?”
He paused at the door way, looking back over his shoulder at Steve.  “You coming or not?  Without that shield, you don’t stand a chance, even with those gorgeous arms.”
His second thought, of course, was
But since when had Tony’s life every gone according to plan?
Tony Stark and Steve Rogers did not have the best start, but throwing a nuke through space and nearly dying really teaches you to let bygones be bygones, to move on, to work together, to get alone.
There was the team, and the team was great.  He’d managed a pizza and video game marathon with Rhodey before he had to return to the Air Force, and it’d been too long, really.  As for the rest of the team, they ate dinner together, they laughed, they joked, they saved New York.  They had nerf gun fights and they sparred, and Clint pretended not to cry over sappy movies, and Coulson came by at least once a week--purely for paperwork reasons, he claimed, but somehow still managed to stick around until midnight nearly every time.
” Howard screams, his bottle of whiskey dropping to the ground and splattering with a crash, the amber liquid bleeding across the wooden floor.
“How did you…?”
“Of course I did, I’m Tony Stark.”
And well, Tony knew what this was for
This wasn’t going as planned, but then again, did it ever?
The elevator was an inch from closing, when an arrow whizzed through, landing millimeters from Tony’s ear.  He barely flinched.
New York.  he was in New York, not Afghanistan, and Cap and Clint and Natasha were hovering over him and he vomited again because the water was really fucking disgusting.
Clocking a fellow billionaire square in the face and running off to a whorehouse?  A prime example.
“And you think that’s always going to be true?”
So Tony talked.  And it shocked him, how free and willing the words fell from his mouth.  People, therapist or not, usually had to pry the truth from him.  But maybe he really was changing, realizing how tiring it was to dodge every question, to circumvent the truth.
She waltzed past him, settling herself down into his desk chair, eyeing him.  “Just until after the gala.”
, which in all honesty, was a relief sometimes.  A lot of the times.  Tonight especially.  Tonight, he could just let go, he didn’t need to worry about what he would say and how it would affect the tabloids the next morning.  He didn’t have stocks or the Avengers in the back of his mind, no. Tonight, he was just Tony.
He danced his way around the ballroom, champagne in hand, with his free one waving and waltzing, adding to the pompous flair that was the Tony Stark Schmooze.  It was grand, it was over the top, it was too much, it was effective.  And that’s all that mattered, right?
“Tony?”
That...didn’t make any sense.  Not that she had moved on, after him, because that’s what he wanted, he wanted her to be happy.  It was one of his last thoughts before his world went dark and cold.  That Peggy would be happy.
Tony burrowed into the other man, who was nothing but pure, hard muscle, yet somehow soft and comforting.  Or maybe it was just because it was Steve, and Steve was here, with him, and fuck if that didn’t make his heart do funny, funny things.
Tony shifted, snuggling himself into Steve.  But by Steve’s shaking, however, it was clear that something was wrong.
Tony, he supposed, was the only one with a home (on Earth, anyway).  And that’s the way he liked it.  Really, it was.
, so…”
Oh.  Shit.
Again, not love.  Just a friend, being friendly.
Eying the prince warily, he stepped over towards the table, hand hovering over the hilt.
His name was called and the larger man kicked out, which Tony managed to dodge.  What he couldn’t dodge was the elbow that slammed down on his shoulder, knees buckling as his body slammed into the mat, blood pooling around his cracked nose.
Once there, they spotted Uncle Ben waiting by the gait, a small smile curled across his face.  “Thanks so much, I’d do it myself, y’know, but my back won’t stand for it.”
He sighed, hunching away towards his desk where he slid into his chair, letting his head fall to the table.
Tony, who was sitting cross-legged on Rhodey’s bed as he slurped a cup of noodles, widened his eyes as Steve walked into the room.  “Captain Muscles!” he exclaimed, setting the cup down as he hopped up the bed, approaching Steve with that same, devious smirk.  “Now, how did you end up with my pants?”
It was ridiculous, but Tony didn’t care.  He didn’t care if it was grossly tiring, if it drained him more than a fight with an onslaught of Doom Bots did these days (though that could be a fault on Doom’s fault though, because seriously?  Did he
Tony didn’t turn towards the door, but from the sound of Steve’s steps, he wasn’t here to deliver cookies and warm milk.
.  So drop it, alright?”
The team got along great, in Steve’s eyes.  It was a shaky start, but Natasha and Clint were already more than close, Thor (when he was there) got along with everyone, filling up awkward silences with booming stories of his youth(?) when need be, and Tony and Bruce, of course, were able to bond over science and, well, more science.
And Steve was right.
Natasha turned to him, offering him a smile that surprisingly, wasn’t unkind.  Tony huffed.
The man’s gaze didn’t waver.  “Apparently I counsel them, too.”
She sighed, reaching out to take the stack of papers from him.  Her lips were pulled tight, but her eyes were dancing.  He loved that she could do that, look scary yet perfectly suave all at once.  A frightening power, really.
Howard refuses at first.  She isn’t surprised.
and all.  Perks of being a billionaire, I guess.”
Later that day, when Tony had isolated himself into the workshop, he realized that it was, in fact not a win.
He’d thought that Steve would at least have the courtesy to announce his presence, not just waltz in.
A small smirk crawled across Tony’s face, but the playfulness didn’t reach his eyes.  “You’ve picked up new technology well, but no matter how faulty SHIELD’s security servers are--as they won’t let me install my own systems, of course--there’s no way you could’ve hacked him.”
Tony looked back down at his desk, not wanting to meet Garner’s questioning gaze.  He didn’t know why Garner was asking him about this again.  They’d been over it, and that was that.  It was helping, Steve was helping.
“Of course not.”
Tony is twenty-two and Peggy knows she’s dying.
“Why do you punch shit, Steve?”
“Well I can see that,” Bruce muttered, voice on the edge of exasperation.  “But, why?  And you do really think it’s a good idea to have a fire pit going in the middle of your lab?”
Really, it was Pepper’s fault.  Wait no, it was Rhodey’s.  Yeah, definitely Rhodey’s.
Before he can truly see what’s going on, there’s hands on his hips and lips on his own and fuck, fucking hell, he needs to breathe, he needs to--
The stark, sharp letters engraved onto the stone stared back at him.
With that, Tony began to pry himself off the ground, and make his way back to the Quinjet, to meet with the others.
“I know you are.”
“What’s
-----
At that, Tony laughed.  A sharp, bitter laugh that bounced off the walls of his workshop.  Dummy whirred, abandoning his charging station to come greet him.  “Yeah, right, JARVIS.  Me.  A panic attack.  You feeling okay?”
, ‘Tash!”  Steve doesn't feel himself rise from his seat, but he suddenly finds himself backed against the grand windows, turning towards the vast scapes of jungle beneath him.  “I...I don’t need to be reminded, you know...you know that I…”’
Tony turned towards the elevator, managing not to stumble.  He sighed though, as he realized Clint had decided to follow him, arms crossed firm over his chest.
She raised a brow at them, unimpressed.  “Doombots invading Time Square urgent?  Or….” She gave a sidelong look at the folder Steve was holding, and he was about to question her, to see if
At that, Clint snickered.  He was so good.
“Burning shit.”
He wasn’t...he wasn’t
And really, he was the reason for Steve, the reason Steve was here today, in Tony’s life.  He had a hand in SHIELD's formation, and consequently, the formation of the Avengers.
But at MIT, he was just Tony.  And he had Rhodey, and hits bots--and really, what else did he need?
“He’s probably in--”
She frowned slightly.  “Not much, except for her contributions to SHIELD.  Why?  Did Fury not brief you?”
Steve had only been living in this century for a few months, but some things were already blatantly clear to him.
“Well, you know me,” Tony smirked, waving his hand.  “Anyways, are you…?”
He counted it as a win, anyway.
confront yourself.”
His fake name was called and the man swung a fist straight into Tony’s jaw, sharp pain shooting through him as he staggered back, wracking his nerves and winding him tight.  But it was so
“I--”
So one night, as he was lying in his actual bed  for once (per Pepper’s very threatening and scary order), he was scrolling through Clint’s fake profile (
“Of course.”
Slowly, Tony reached into his coat and pulled out a single white lily, and laid it atop the smooth granite.  The stood in silence, but it wasn’t tense.  Instead it was comforting, soothing.
“I–what?  No, no?  No, it’s….not?”
The way he says it is almost patronizing, but Steve knows that it’s not.  He’s just...trying to help.
Right?
Steve frowned.  “James, really?”
Yanking his arm, he turned wordlessly towards the door, and bolted out.
And as to why he was so engrossed with his conversation that he’d bumped right into Steve on his way to the kitchen, again.  No clue.
Tony, you tried to kill yourself!  After we….after all this shit that you’ve done, and, god, do not try and tell me it was an accident because I know it wasn’t and thank god for JARVIS, if not for him, you’d be, you….you’d be….”
Out of nowhere the man pulled out a condom and handed it to Tony, who only handed it right back.  “No I’m...you top, fuck me, please….”
Steve blinks, pulling himself from his thoughts.  T’Challa hasn’t moved, eyes still boring into him.
He didn’t need their pity.  He didn’t need anyone’s pity.
“Excuse me?”
The first person that comes to mind is Natasha, but he hasn’t seen her in a few weeks, since her last visit, since Steve...admitted to a weakness he tries not to show so openly in front of others.  He doesn’t have her number, because she’s still, technically, on the other side of all of this.  She shows up when she needs to, or she contacts him on a burner phone.
And that’s the kicker, really.  All his life he’s been non stop, moving as fast as his genius brain would let him.  Having to take his time, going one step at a time through this process called healing, called Getting Better, called Becoming Whole Again.
Pepper had once made a passing comment about how if Tony was less
T’Challa is donating some of his own medical tech to the hospital.  He wasn’t on Steve’s side of the...Incident, so his contribution, and presence, is welcome.  It comes with gratitude and grace, Steve is sure.
“Uh…”
Tony’s eyes narrowed, but they didn’t hold the heat that they usually did.  In a sense, Steve was right, since Tony
?” Natasha suggested, smirking slightly as Bruce sent her daggers with his eyes.  The Other Guy wasn’t really a fan of musicals, as they’d learned too little too late.
“JARVIS, tracker in your phone for uh, emergencies I guess.  But we couldn’t until you
Tiberius Stone are just hilarious.  Pepper has been up to her ears since last night trying to clean up your mess, and you don’t care, do you, Tony?”
He remembers seeing the name light up the New York sky for the first time.  Remembers thinking the building was ugly, obtrusive, unnecessary.  But that was before...before everything.
Once the stepped out onto the floor, the others turned towards him and Steve, varying degrees of shock and worry and, fuck,
“Yep, well about some things.  Others?  Not so much.  For example, counting backwards from ten is pointless and stupid.  Got anything else?”
“If Steve has something to tell me, then he can tell me, capishe?  I don’t need you to be his messenger bird, so just, drop it alright?  Now, I’m gonna go to bed, and you can go gather twigs for your nest or whatever it is you do at five in the fucking morning.”
Yeah.  No.  Probably not.
Tony blinked.  “Uh sure?  For what, exactly?”
But then again, maybe he didn’t have a
He’d never seen this film, nor heard anything about it.  He
At Bucky’s silence, however, Steve had to look up.  His friend was staring at him, wide eyed and jaw slacked.  Steve rolled his eyes, and turned back to the pair of jeans he was currently folding.
“Yeah, I...hurry, I’m…” Tony panted, cock throbbing as his mind was full of heat, nothing but heat and this desperate desire to have every last coherent thought fucked straight out of his whirring mind.
A voice, almost familiar to his buzzing, clogged ears was scratching at the back of his head, reaching for him, sending a shock down -
he couldn’t breathe and he was in that damn hole, that damn hole and he’d just shot the nuke and he’d done it and he was happy because he’d fucking done it but he couldn’t breathe and the suit was going out, the arc reactor was going to give out and he was going to die right here right now in another fucking dimension and that was okay it really was but if he could only tell Pepper how much he loved her, just one last time.
“Hey--what the fuck?” Clint gruffed, now splayed on his back after the surprise attack.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Tony muttered under his breath, setting down his welding torch.  “Fine, whatever.  Let him in.”
“How?”
“Had it occurred to you that I perhaps just wanted some space?”  His words were soft, but sharp.  Steve nodded.
“Does it really matter, Steve?  I’m here, I’m alive, and I’m just
Tony merely rolled his eyes.  “Play the film, J,”
“Really?”  Garner raised an eyebrow at him, a soft smile still playing at his lips.  “Because to me, you’re an open book.  You’re restless not only because you’ve failed to take your own life, but because you have to deal with the guilt that comes with that, interacting with the people who think you’d be willing to leave them behind, and those kinds of conversations are what led you here in the first place.”
“That’s good, it’s...it’s good that he’d doing that.”
Steve had never believed people when they told him the line between love and hate was wire thin.  Not until now.
“Tony, I think we both know how you feel about me, and well….I feel the same way about you, I really do.  And I thought you knew, I mean, but…is this okay?”
“Yeah, I don’t blame them, wanting out of these cramped dormitories.  Doesn’t uh, exactly scream
“Classic, sure, but is there somewhere else you think we should start?”  And, well, no.  Tony really couldn’t think of anywhere else to start.
A nurse was kind enough to lead them out the back entrance since everyone, including the doctors, agreed that the last thing Tony needed right now was a paparazzi ambush.  Multiple SHIELD vans were brought around, and Steve led Tony into the one that Natasha had hopped into.
“Hey Tony, are you done with--what the fuck are you doing?”
Steve was about to shut it behind him, but he paused, a voice from down the hall catching his ear.
Two months and two weeks after Tony woke up from a coma, Steve got assigned to a SHIELD mission.  Radio silence, in the fucking Amazon.
It isn’t until T’Challa is gone that Steve realizes he’s clutching the little, black phone in his hand.
logo stenciled on in fresh, glistening paint.  Even that is almost too much for Steve, seeing Tony’s name embellished before him.
By the time Steve had realized he’d hit a nerve, it was too late, and Tony was already marching out of his own lab.
Welp, that's that! I hope you all enjoyed it--if you've been here since the story started thank you for sticking with me, I hope the ending wasn't disappointing and was worth the wait.  If you've stumbled upon this as a completed work, I hope you enjoyed the story overall!  Regardless, thank you all for reading!
He failed.  He fucking failed.  He sputtered out a laugh at the irony of it, even as the nurses who had entered right after his team began to flutter around him, measuring this that and the other and god, he was so tired and aching and nothing had changed except the tube in his arm and the fact that his team was staring at him with wide, concerned eyes.
He stared at the man, who was now sitting in the chair beside him.  Tony merely raised an eyebrow at him.  He was well dressed, but in a suit, not in any sort of doctor attire.
“I went for a walk.  It was nice out.”
Or, okay, he had the
“Hey, Peps.”
Peggy is asked to speak, too, and she tells them she has nothing to say.
Steve couldn’t muster a response, just gently placed the sword back on the table, and perched himself on the bed adjacent to it.  “I don’t...this doesn’t make any sense.”
His body was acting on it’s own as his mind sputtered to life, just to crash to a standstill; it did that again, and again and again and again and
It was Pepper, eyeing him from across the limo, eyebrow raised.  Her eyes were soft however, fluttering with something like worry and Tony, Tony just sighed.
“When are you going to tear down those walls, Tony?”
“The phone I gave you.  It’s not one way.  You can call him.”
He threw the bottle down, backing away from his desk, but he soon found himself on the floor, crawling with what little energy still remained in his rubbery limbs.  He heaved in a breath, or at least tried to but it felt like he was breathing through a goddamn straw and he couldn’t get any air, he couldn’t breathe he couldn’t
The words slice at him, a bitter ring in his ears, but he simply nods.
It was ridiculous, wasn’t it?  This wasn’t how the stories went.  Tony wasn’t sixteen, crying into a pillow in his too small bedroom as his iPod shuffle blared in his ears, his parents arguing about getting a divorce as he slit his wrists.  No, this wasn’t like every single fucking stereotype he’d ever heard in his life.  Grown men didn’t do this.  Billionaire geniuses didn’t do this.
Tony blinked.  And blinked again, just to promptly roll over onto his side to vomit out copious amounts of horribly disgusting salty water.
would still think so highly of you, once he knew all your dirty little--”
“C’mon, get in here, you big lug.”
Besides that, the drive back to the tower was uneventful, and the journey from the garage into the tower was even less so.  It was, however, the quietest he’d ever seen his team be, and that was just…
“Wait...is this a replica of Steve’s shield?”
It was the annual gala for the Maria Stark Foundation.  And he’d forgotten.  Because he was a fucking idiot.
“Is there a problem…” Tony trailed off, because Steve was staring at him, staring at him like he’d just realized the Earth revolved around the sun and and that the grass was green and the sky was blue and.  And.
thing, because really, he did know how much older Peggy would have been than Tony (and, well, Steve too) if she was still alive today, and Steve wasn’t that delusional.
His name was called and it was Steve, Steve looking down upon him with that damn sad smile that sent Tony’s ribs cracking and knees shaking, and it was Steve who held his last gaze as his world shifted from a fuzzy blur of color to complete darkness.
Tony isn’t lying awake at night, wondering what Steve is up to.  He’s not fretting over where Steve is.  He’s not shuddering into his pillow, trying to remember how to breathe with memories that hang over him.
Before things could escalate, Tony dragged himself off the couch and wobbled towards the elevator.  Clint gave him an odd look, but didn’t call after him.  It was Steve, however, who did
But he couldn’t, oh goddesses, his body weighed too much and he was too weak, oh so weak, always so weak--
Clint, then he would blame Natasha.  Unless said assassin was in the room, then Clint would probably refuse to say anything at all.
“I want you to not rely on others for your health.”
Steve grabbed Tony impossibly tighter and Tony felt his chest knotting up, a wave of emotions swarming him.  Guilt, shame, sadness, and something deep, so deep he refused to let it surface and he just gripped Steve tighter and tried to push down the tears threatening his eyes.
And with that, Steve hung up.  And Tony had never felt more alone.
Tony could’ve said a lot of things, really.  He could’ve said how it wasn’t the team’s plan, it was Steve's plan; he could’ve said how he’d warned them from the beginning what they were getting into, with him on the team.
she began sniffling, again presumably, tears rocking her body as the grip on his hand tightened.  Tony pulled her close so she was half on his bed, her stuffed nose pressed into the crook of his neck.
“I think both of us know that the Tony Stark in the tabloids is much different from Tony Stark, the person.”
“Is something going on, do you need-”
“Nicholay Demetrios, that ring a bell?”
He sputtered, whipping his head around to find one of the workers of the arena staring back down at him.
Because Steve is.  Every night, like clockwork he lies awake with a pounding head and a rasping heart.  Another failed day, another day without a cure.  Another day without a call.
The first person that comes to mind is Natasha, but he hasn’t seen her in a few weeks, since her last visit, since Steve...admitted to a weakness he tries not to show so openly in front of others.  He doesn’t have her number, because she’s still, technically, on the other side of all of this.  She shows up when she needs to, or she contacts him on a burner phone.
This was stupid.  This was incredibly and horribly and.  And.
Or, well, not Tony, for his face was hidden underneath a mask, a mask with a crudely drawn face upon it that most definitely wasn’t his.  Really, it wasn’t.
“You know you can call him.”
By the time he made it to the common room, Clint was about to show the damn thing to Steve, and Tony being the impulsive man he was, managed to tackle the archer to the ground.
Rhodey had been on ‘classified’ missions, as of late, and Pepper had been well, running his goddamn company.
At least the boy had Jarvis.  Thank God for Jarvis.
A pause.  “What?”
It had been months since the Battle of New York; one month less than that, the Avengers had moved into the Tower.
Slowly, as if in a trance, Steve stepped towards the blade, his feet taking slow, careful steps.  Without thinking, he reached out, grasped the blazing purple handle, and pulled.
Tony just scoffed, turned back to his work and most certainly didn’t think about Steve.  Again.
He’d wanted to stay in the lab until, well, next month really, but Bruce was cooking duck that night and Tony knew that Bruce’s duck was not to be missed.
Tony Stark was not one of those things.
He chucked.  “I know girl, you ready for some work today?”  The horse whinnied, and Steve couldn’t help but grin.   Bucky rolled his eyes, straddling his own horse.
, she had said.  And, well, she wasn’t wrong.
sweet, beautiful air.
“Fuck you, JARVIS…” he murmured under his breath, squirming into the couch.
Grinning like a madman, Clint reached in and pulled out a bundle of cloth.  That bundle of cloth.
He managed to find a cab, ignoring how the driver was more concerned with the fact that he was being directed towards Stark Tower than the shape Tony was in.  Another night, another year, another lifetime, he would’ve flashed the man a brilliant smile and offered up an
Well.  Tony had snapped at the man, and pretty harshly at that.  Had he-
So instead, he goes to India.  Sam comes with him, but Wanda stays back in Wakanda.  Steve had gotten a tip about a neuroscientist that works with some odd, nearly forgotten form of hypnosis.
But Tony, he now realized, had to try.  For him, for Steve.  For each other.
“I got mugged.”
So making suggestive comments to his new mystery blue eyed boy was so natural, it was second nature.  He didn’t need to think, it just spewed from his brain and into his phone and, well.  It worked.
Unless of course, you
Well.
If it didn’t hurt to do so, Tony would’ve shrugged.  “Y’know, I think you’re missing the part when I saved a trainful of people, yeah?  Do you remember that?”
Tony nodded, digging his palms into his eyes.   Saying that he was a mess didn’t even begin to cover it.
“Can I kiss you?” Tony blurted out, and the words had barely left Tony’s mouth when Steve’s own lips were pressed against his, pulling him in for a deep, searching kiss.  Tony moaned into it, arching his back as he wrapped himself around the other man.  The kiss was anything but chaste, hot and needing and desperate, desperate to make up for lost time, desperate to remind themselves what could’ve been, wasn’t.  Desperate to be lost within one another, to feel nothing but one another.
On the Red Line though, it really hit him.  He was fifteen again, mind whirring with new invention ideas that left him eager to get back to his flat and back to work.  So much passion back then, in his freshman year, so much optimism.  He’d finally escaped the pressures of his dad, of his name.  And he felt free, for the first time in so long.
“Okay, let’s get one thing straight here,” Tony started, making his way over towards the couch.  He flopped down onto his, refusing to meet anyone’s eye.  “All of you are not going to treat me any different, capishe?  I’m still Tony Fucking Stark, I’m still an Avenger, I’m still
“Leave it on.”
Yeah.  That.
“Stark was about as close as family as she had, besides her brother,” Fury had said to him, and Steve had wanted to press for more, but Fury was a busy man (Steve had known that since day one) and it was a borderline personal issue, and Fury wasn’t one to dwell into those.
“Yeah, and little good that did, because even when I tried to be you, all my dad could do was pester me about how much
“So this is her file?”
In the workshop.
Well.
Tony thought Steve would just carry him to his floor, but the man brought him into his bedroom and all but tucked him into bed.
But really, despite the fact that the face on the picture was probably most likely not going to match who Nick really was, Tony still knew him, really, he did.  He knew he did, somehow.
Groaning, he swung his feet over the bed, snatching his discarded clothes from the floor as he dug around for his cell phone to check the time.
Tony’s gaze lingered on him for another moment, but he didn’t reply.  He merely turned, exiting towards the bay.  Steve watched him go, watched as the suit molded around him, encasing his lean form.  He watched as the red and gold armor lifted from the Helicarrier and streaked across the sky.  A small smile involuntarily formed across his face at the beauty of it.
It was just the two of them in the backseat, Natasha and Coulson, who was driving, muttering quietly in the front.  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony, shifting them so Tony’s head was tucked into the crook of his neck.
“Is that why Pepper dumped you, Tony?  Too loose for her taste, what with all those threesomes you’ve been having over the years?  Aren’t you a bit old for that, Tony?  Come now.”
A flash of bright, blinding light, and a haze of shimmering red and gold was the last thing that Steve saw before the pain took him, his body and mind falling unconscious.
And Steve.  He should apologize to Steve too.
Her eyes narrowed, but his groggy brain could’ve swore he saw a flicker of a smirk on her lips. “If you weren’t a mess right now, I’d slap that goatee right off your face.”
you were than me.  Captain fucking America!  The big brother I never had, and could never live up to!  Imagine that, being compared to a fucking adult your whole childhood, and anything less?  Failure.  And I was less to him, believe me.  I was a

“You talked to
“It’s funny to you, right?  I’m sure it is, and I’m sure the headlines of how you
So he pushed, and while he managed to make headway, he knew he wasn’t going to last.  Not with the suit unable to withstand the immense pressure.
Miraculously, Tony just needed to remember what gala they were attending and why it was going to be such a disaster because people just could not let the past die a painful, pitiful death like it
Once the repairs were done (Tony choosing to do most of the work himself as to provide the city with more construction workers, something Steve really didn’t see coming from Stark even after his stunt with the nuke), and the team each had their own floor, complete with a common room, gym, natatorium, and a pantry more stocked than the grocery stores in Brooklyn circa 1941.  And it was great.
Well...maybe that’s not true.  They’ve all had a lot of time to recover since the Incident, and really think about what they all did, really think through it all.  Sam was furious once Steve and Bucky had returned from Siberia, but once Steve had explained everything to Sam, he was...more understanding, in a way.  Just as Steve had been.
Before Steve could filter through his thoughts, his lips were already moving.  “I thought I was getting a reward, not a punishment.”
And after everyone had moved into the tower with him, it’d gotten better.  Really better.  Really really better.
“Wait, what?  Me?  You want me to go up against that...man?!”
Well, it had been buzzing before, but this was Steve’s buzz.
Steve sighs, rising from the edge of the bed.  “Are you going to see him today?”
Tony blinked, the familiar lyrics grown louder and louder, along with the smooth melody being plucked across the guitar strings
“Okay cool, yeah, great...cool.  And uh, what exactly were we fighting?”
Tony blew a raspberry.  “What, is it past my bedtime,
“No worries, Cap.  Who you texting, your girlfriend?” Tony asked, smirking to himself at the childish remark.  At that however, Steve blushed slightly, rolled his eyes, and walked off towards the elevator.
Stupid, giant mechanical Godzilla walking around New York, and Tony’s first thought was
“Is it okay if I come--” Steve started, but Tony cut him off with a sharp nod.
, she left the room, leaving him alone once again.
He also remembers this feeling, this feeling of wanting to give it all, just to go back.  To go back to his own time, back to Peggy, back to his old life.
“I...think you know what this is,” Steve said, the same small smile sketched across his face, but this time, it managed to reach his eyes.
Tony sighed.  Jesus.
And he fucked it up, because that’s what he did.  Apparently.
Steve chuckled slightly at that, digging his phone out of his pocket.  “I don’t see him, I should tell him I’m here.”
Or something.
“Was it you?” Steve blurted, blinking.  “Was it you who saved me from--”
into Fury’s office might be putting it harshly.  But it might also be the most accurate description.
“It’s not a problem,” Steve answered honestly, with a smile of his own.  He liked doing this, he liked being of use, despite his small stature and weak frame.
So Tony was Tony and it worked, and it was fine, and the team was great.
, but the rest was all stuff he already knew, whether it be from his history catch up, or just from knowing Peggy personally.
It was surreal, really, to be back on the subway; on the MBTA really.  The green line was just how he remembered it, too: old and far too crowded, with shotty heat.  On that day, however, he was thankful for it, for it gave him a reasonable excuse to keep his scarf wrapped around his mouth, and his oversized hood strewn over his head.
He apparently had twelve missed calls from Pepper, ten from Happy, five from Bruce, three from Clint and one from Natasha (which was scary enough, really).
Yeah.  Exactly.
I’m not doing that.” Not anymore, he didn’t say.  He nearly shuddered, shoving the thought back down into the depths of his brain.  Thirteen year old him hadn’t discovered booze yet, and he didn’t have many other options.  But that was done, it was over, and he
Tony indulged in a small smile, and pocketed the note.
“What happened?”
Neither of them say anything on the ride down the highway and into New York, just a stiff, sad silence that cloaks over the two of them.
“You know that I can’t”
What he sees nestled inside the box nearly causes his knees to buckle.  He steps back, hands clutching at his own face but it doesn’t feel like his own hands because how could it how could it he can’t believe can’t believe can’t believe it why would Tony do this how could Tony do this how could he have ever done all those things to Tony said all those things because Tony is just so.  So.  So so so sososososo.
They ate pizza together (with the whole team really) but sometimes when Tony was too caught up in his work to head up from his workshop to join everyone, it was Steve who would bring him a slice or two, and stayed to chat.  Well, listen to Tony drone on about whatever it was he was working on, but Steve didn’t mind.
“I’m sorry Steve, I have to--”
Or something.
A sharp ringing sound grew in his ears; his senses numbed, his mind slowed down and his heart, his fucking heart.
“Who’re you waiting for tonight, Stark?  I saw a hefty pair of twins in there, you think they’d do that incest shit, just for you?  How disgusting, really, but whatever gets you off I guess.”
(Please read the chapter notes, thank you!)
“You’ve been out for awhile.  Over a day.”  The other man said, leaning forward his chair, arms crossed and resting on his knees.  “It’s not...unexpected, considering what happened to you.”
Steve sighed, but frustration was bright in his eyes.  “No, I don’t think so.  If it was so obviously unhealthy, then why do you keep doing it?”
A quarter of that whiskey sloshing around in the pit of his stomach was probably why he’d decided to let Steve into his lab.
He knew Natasha was perceptive, but even that shocked him a little bit.  “Are my tells that obvious?”
At that, Tony couldn’t help but to snort out a laugh.  Because, really?  How fucking cliche.
“Good, you’re here!  We should get going then, want to make it there before dusk.”
“Is this okay?” Steve muttered, and Tony only nodded.  It was okay, very okay, but he couldn’t find the words to say exactly what he meant, so he just snuggled in closer to Steve.  The other man seemed to understand, as he let out a small, relieved sigh.

Which was a thought that friends had.  About their other friends.  Yeah.
“I say
“That’s the
Well.
“Um, well that sounds
Natasha sat herself beside him, giving him a look that Tony couldn’t decipher, and he was slightly afraid to find out.  She wouldn’t let up, however, even when Bruce cut in between them to serve.  He rolled his eyes. “What?”
“I know it might hurt, but he’s probably lying too, Steve.”
Suddenly it hit him, like a fucking rock to the face.  The gala, Tiberius, the brothel, being fucked straight through the mattress.
Right now, right now he has a bottle of god knows what and a glass of whatever and he downed the bottle and downed the glass because this isn’t heroic it’s not romantic it’s not something to be proud of, it’s a sickness and these pills won't cure it, they can only end it.
“Tony, I know you’re a genius but you are honestly so stupid sometimes.”
So when Steve went down to Tony’s lab for the first time, and saw what he had on his desk, he might have acted a bit….rash.

He tried to mutter something resembling a
What he found was Tony’s workshop locked, and his override codes rejected.  He couldn’t say that he was surprised.

Tony’s at her bedside, Jarvis having left already, and she knows she doesn’t have much longer.  Cancer is a bitch.
“I’m just trying to tell you, this is how I cope, alright?”
Luckily where he was going, that didn’t matter.
Steve and the team had raided his workshop for booze before he’d gotten back to the tower after his incident, but he was Tony Stark and fuck, he had to have something down here.
“You’re the most blunt therapist I’ve had, and trust me, I’ve had a lot.  They say I’m the kind of daddy issues, mind you.  But...isn’t that a no-no in therapy school?  Isn’t it about counting backwards from ten and
Tony Stark had been in love once before.
“It seems to me,” Garner continued, when Tony remained silent, gaze flickering between the cactus and the pens strewn across his desk, “that your issues stem from deeper problems within yourself.  Am I wrong?”
“Of course, Captain Rogers.”
made the team suffer through his own fair share of horrible movies, so whatever it was, it wasn’t unjust.
Tony looked up, cocking his head at Nat, but she was still looking down, refusing to meet his eyes.
“Tony is fine,” he decided, and Garner nodded.
“I think,” he muttered, thumb grazing against Tony’s jaw and he shuddered, back digging into the brick wall and oh fuck, oh fuck oh-
Breathing staggered, he pressed his back against the cool, smooth wall and sank down, his knees finally giving out after hoisting him up for decades, decades of sharp, sharp pain, sharper than the metal in his chest or a hand tugging at his wrist, too harsh and too unkind from a father to his son, his child,
that it was for his
Huh.  Weird.
“Sure, of course, yeah, why wouldn’t it?”
Steve thought, but the words didn’t leave his lips.  He heaved a sigh, trying to formulate his thoughts properly through his muddled shock, confusion, and bitter guilt.  “I just--first of all, I’m sorry.”
A hand reached up for him, fingers skimming across the side of Tony’s jaw, and he released a breath he didn't know he was holding on to.
It was so terrible and disgusting that Tony burst out laughing, a sharp, bitter sound that stung his own ears.  Steve’s eyebrows shot up, his glare increasing as he leaned forward in his chair.
“Yeah yeah, go ahead.”
Fuck.
“Denied.”
Tony shrugged, and Steve would’ve been mad at him, for being so careless about the whole situation, if he wasn’t so consumed in his disbelief.  “Yes, well, that makes sense, if you hadn’t been raised with the goddamn power inside you.  I assume the goddesses were trying to protect you, no one would go after a poor scrawny villager, or suspect that he would be the Hero of Legend, but stranger things have happened.  Really, I don’t know for sure
Steve ignored his best friend, choosing instead to throw his duffle over the shoulder, snagging his bus ticket from his desk.  “Well, this has been
“I should be heading back,” Tony muttered.  Steve nodded meekly.
And fuck if Steve didn’t look so earnest, so willing, so goddamn loving after all the shit Tony put him through.  It did strange things to him, but for once, strange wasn’t necessarily bad.
Really.
“Yes,” Tony answered without hesitation.  But even he knew that the word carried no weight.  “If he’s not there then I’ll call him.”
Or unlucky.  Unlucky would probably be more accurate.
“Fuck off, Stone, I don’t need your petty shit tonight.”  And really, he didn’t. They weren’t kids anymore, they weren’t comparing daddy issues and circuit boards.  No, they were grown fucking men, and they should be reasonable business competitors.
he ruined shit, he did, and Steve deserved better, he really did.
Tony, of course, said nothing.
“Not reality with the world around you, from what Coulson tells me, you’re life is very real, if somewhat insane.  But what you need is to confront yourself.
His name was called and the man kicked Tony over, so his own eyes were looming into the man’s.  The man, who looked absolutely disgusted with Tony and really, really, why wouldn’t he?
Maybe
And Tony wasn’t twelve and he needed to
Okay, maybe he was jealous before, but after having a week to think it over, he could see how irrational he’d been acting.
Shit.
It’s expensive, he can tell.  Similar to the ones Tony always wears.

Fuck.
He knew she was like an aunt to him, but he also knew that she wasn’t around much,
His best friend.  Bucky.
“So I’m supposed to think you got dizzy, couldn’t breathe, and just started apologizing to Cap over and over again because…?  What, did you insult the Dodgers earlier today or something?”  Clint was smirking now, an eyebrow raised, but the worry hadn’t washed out from his eyes.
“Hmm, Stark, funny finding you here.  Been awhile, hasn’t it?”
he needed that he didn’t even hesitate to snap the lock on the door and barge into Fury’s office.
“Honestly,” Clint continued, smirking now at the thoughtful gleam in Steve’s eyes, “as long as you don’t get into, like, a serious love affair with anyone, you’re not harming anybody.  Well, not really.  I think.”
Tony exhaled a sharp sigh, digging his face into the palms of his hands.  Clint, Clint, Clint.  Jesus.
“How so?”
Again, Steve blinked.  He looked down again at his new body, and while he supposed he should’ve taken offence from the man’s comments, he was right.  Steve had managed to lift the sword, but had he fought the man who had taken Bucky, he surely would have lost.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the doctor, cocking his head slightly.  “I do believe it, because it’s true.”
Phone turned on, he saw that it was creeping towards 4 AM.  Hmm, well.  It could’ve been worse.
He grabbed a napkin from his kitchen, scratched out a quick
“When you do,” Tony stated, just before Steve grabbed the thing, “look at your hand as you hold it.”
So why he found himself gushing out the details of motorcycle and car mechanics to some guy, he had no clue.  Really, he didn’t.
Pain.  Fucking
Fumbling at the too small keys, he manages to type out a single phrase.
, Tony?  What if--God, Tony, why didn’t you tell anyone?  You could’ve told me, you know, I know we’re not dating anymore but I still--I couldn’t lose you, Tony!”
It’s not like Tony had brought up the idea, nope, no way, definitely not.  Why in hell would he want a super soldier, two agents, a norse god living in his damn tower house?  Bruce, well, he’d be happy with Bruce.  Having someone besides JARVIS around that could keep up with him (well, within reason) would definitely be a change of pace.
“Can we watch
“‘Night...but Steve, really?  You think I meant myself?  Stark can pull the baggy eyed, disheveled look on a good day, but you?  Not so much.”
Tony smiled.  “Exactly.  I’ll be fine.  He said a week at the most.”  Steve pulled them apart slightly, bending down and reeling Tony back in for a soft, languid kiss.  Tony sighed into it, wanting nothing more than to crawl back into bed with Steve’s lips on his, but he knew Steve had to go, and it would be okay, it would be fine.  They both had jobs and duties, and it was normal, and it would be fine.
And now he was the man offering Tony over to a shrink.
“Look, I don’t know if you’ve met me, but I’m not Mr Touchy Feely, alright?  It didn’t seem important, and I didn’t really--”
what makes Steve’s heart freeze over, his muscles seizing, fingers going numb.  Tony didn’t want to know where he was.  Tony didn’t want to find him.
Steve blinked again.  “I...what?  I thought you were hurt.”
There was a voice trying to penetrate through the buzzing in his ears but it was nothing but white noise and it didn’t matter anyway because Steve wasn’t here, he wasn’t fucking here and Tony was alone, so very alone once again and it was ripping him apart from the inside out and he had to do something, he had to do
“Yeah….yeah of course I will,” he breathed, digging into his wallet, reaching for a handful of cash to shove into his hand.  Quickly, he dragged the man up the stairs, to the left, and into the closest bedroom he could find.  He’d barely slammed the door closed when his lips were met with another pair, full of heat and lust and nothing close to passion, and he was thankful for it, oh so thankful.  It was a breath of fresh air, a drink of ice cold water on one of Malibu’s cruelest summer days.  It was hungry and desperate, but maybe that was just Tony because he could feel himself moaning as he rutted against the man, the stranger, the prostitute, and there was nothing but the slow hum of his arc reactor in his chest and he was thankful for it, he really was.
His chest throbbed, but it wasn’t as painful as he imagined it would be.  Perhaps it was because he had more closure now.  Perhaps it was because of the man beside him.
At that, Steve is left speechless.  He thinks back to the day that Tony had wordlessly returned his shield, and how much of a shock it had been.  That day, though, Steve had been expecting what the gift was when Natasha told him that Tony had something for him.  This?  This was nothing but a mystery.
Tony paused, but only for a moment, before he turned toward the doors.  “Are you coming or not?”  He called over his shoulder.
Steve awoke that day how he awoke every day--with Bucky whacking him across the face with an overstuffed pillow.
For a minute, Tony actually thought he would.  But no, of course not.  He, of course, was Captain of morality and good will and
get along with the others–Bruce was easy to talk to when he opened up, Clint was more frat boy than professional when it came down to it, and he could trade war stories for espionage experiences with both him and Natasha.
Her lips curved, a wicked smile forming across her face.  “Give me a few days.”
“Workshop, J,” he breathed, leaning against the cool wall of his elevator, hand running through his cropped hair.
It was still dark out, the sky an inky black across the New York skyline.  So that was good.  Probably.  Not like he cared.  Obviously.
Stabbed into a pedestal of sorts was a bright, shining sword, sun sparking of the crisp blade and purple hilt.  It was beautiful, gorgeous even.  More than that, however, it was a weapon, a weapon Steve so desperately needed if he was to face the cloaked man whenever he did show himself.
He’d practiced said move with Natasha thousands of times, but still.  Damn.
Steve tried to suppress the blood rushing to his cheeks, but it was to no avail.  The owner of said voice was now face to face with Steve, strewn casually within his doorway.  His brown hair was mussed up, as if he’d just rolled out of bed, complete with stubble lining his chin.  As his eyes fell from the stranger’s face, he saw that he was sporting a worn MIT shirt that clung loosely from his shoulders.  Oh, and his
Clint stuck out his tongue, and was about to keep scrolling through Tony’s digital collection when a voice piped up.
T’Challa only continues to stare at him, making Steve’s skin itch.  He has no idea what the other man is thinking.  He opened his home to Steve, along with the rest of the Avengers who had nowhere to go, until this whole issue...Incident..is sorted out.  If it ever will be.
It wasn’t until later that day, after a morning movie marathon spent cuddled with Steve on the couch, when Tony met with Dr Garner for the first time.  Well, the first time that mattered anyway.
accusing him, he relaxed his shoulders.  “They were just in my room, I have no idea how you managed to lose your pants in my room.”
And this?  This isn’t love.  Whatever this
From Steve’s end it made sense, because he
While he was eating.
“No, I don’t think...”  Steve replied, squinting his eyes as realization pooled in the pit of his stomach.  Sebastian had never asked for any of that; all their communication was done through Twitter, and Twitter alone.
Tony chucked, striding closer to him, his leather boots padding along the marble floors.  “Go pick up the sword, Steve.”  He pointed towards a clothed table on the other side of...what Steve now supposed was someone’s bedroom, judging by the immaculate bed towards the other side of the table that he’d failed to notice in his earlier shock.
“You could’ve told me.  If you had told me you needed space I would’ve respected it.”
Tony, being Tony (even if he was
That’s what he told himself as his fake name was called and he stepped onto the mat.
Clint was still outwardly mad, but Steve had a suspicion that it was just a cover to mask his guilt.  Steve asked Clint for a favor, and if he had said no, Steve would’ve moved on.  But Clint did come, on his own free will, and as much as Clint wants to blame Tony for getting locked up, Steve knows that Clint understood what he was getting himself into.  What he was risking.
Thor had gone off to New Mexico to stay with Jane, and Clint, Natasha and Steve went off to SHIELD right after Shawarma.  Bruce had stayed with Tony that night, but then returned to SHIELD the next day.
--so they ended up going there quite often.
But outside of that, outside of his own, personal hang ups, he knows that instead of him being persecuted, it would just be him being controlled.  Either operate against the law and do what needs to be done, or be on the side of the government, and have the decision making ripped from him.
Shit.  Goddamn it.
And well, the kid didn’t really get himself.
So they galloped and trotted, ushering the frantic sheep as they did.  There were only three more left and Steve was hot on their trail when he called out to Bucky, “Looks like I get to keep my bed, unless you can manage--”
“Tony if you don’t answer me I’m throwing all your coffee makers out the window.”
Steve sighed.  But, everything was ready to go with the profile, and he was about to his save, when-
Well.
Shit.  Well, fuck.  Fucking shit.
But if so, who had saved him?  He knew he heard the man on the horse laughing, ready to strike.  And then…
But it wasn’t just the tone.  It was the question and really it was so, so unfair.  Slowly, Tony rolled off the bed, and began pacing across the room, refusing to meet Steve’s screaming eyes.
Well, he wouldn’t have met Pepper without Stark Industries, so….
Slowly, he grabbed the pants and the contents he’d found inside, getting to his feet and walking out the door.  Slowly, he knocked on door 211, and was greeted by his DA.
, it made Steve’s insides clench and squirm, having such a nasty smile being directed at him.  Directed at him by Tony.
“Shit,” Clint muttered, flinging himself off the couch and out of the room, cursing under his breath as he went.
At a place like this, he didn’t need his usual, tiring Tony Stark charm that was required of him at galas or business meanings.  He didn’t need to
and shit.  Or something.  It didn’t fucking matter, did it?
And for tonight, it was perfect.

Not a
Steve, alright?  I was fucking dying and so what if I got drunk and destroyed half of my Malibu estate, and so what if I let my best friend take my suit and hand it over to the-”
At that, Steve is left speechless.  He thinks back to the day that Tony had wordlessly returned his shield, and how much of a shock it had been.  That day, though, Steve had been expecting what the gift was when Natasha told him that Tony had something for him.  This?  This was nothing but a mystery.
Well.
But maybe it was still all for his money, and his funding.  Fuck, like he thought he could escape that shit.  It’s not that he minded, because he really did have more money than God, but if he was really being used…?
Tony, you can’t just do that, you can’t…”
and it was
on the goddam man and--
At that, Tony only blinked.  Coulson, who they thought had been dead for nearly a month, until Tony was hacking through SHIELD files for this that and the other and found out that, in fact, Coulson was most certainly not dead, and had been reinstated to active duty.  Fury’s excuse for not telling them was that it was none of their goddamn business.  To counter that, the Avengers had all explained that because of this man’s death that they’d managed to come together, set aside their differences and save New York.
“Your suit,” Seve started slowly, “it was only out for 30 seconds?”
And Tony had this thing about Peggy.
He looked up into her worried eyes, mustering up the best smile he could manage.  “Of course, Pep.”
Huh.  Running away in his own house again.  Hah.  Classic Stark.
Bruce winced.  “Yeah, that.”
Tony knows who his saviour was, all along, and it’s the only other person in that bed with him.
, Steve reminded himself, sighing, and standing up to serve himself another slice of lasagna.
Because what was he supposed to say?  What answer was Steve actually looking for?  It was too much of a question, one that hit him like a bullet and lodged itself deep within his gut.
Steve ignored the quip, shook off his reddening cheeks, and followed after the man with an exasperated sigh.
Steve smiled gently, and laid himself across the floor.
Steve smiled down at him, but it was a small, frail thing.  He threw off his shoes and climbed into the bed with Tony, breath becoming more relaxed as he did so.
“Because you asked me to, Tony...But if you ever want to talk about it in-in the future, you know I’m here, right?”
He blinked.  If he’d managed to make if from the woods to Kakariko, then to Castletown, then…
“Just think about it, Captain.”

He couldn’t
The prince clapped his hands twice, striding towards the door.  “Come.  Grab the sword, I’ll find you a sheath.  The longer we wait, the deeper shit we’re both going to be in.”
No time for that.
Steve had his doubts, at first, considering the file he’d read and the tabloids he’d seen, that Tony wouldn’t be a team player.  That he’d be rash, hardheaded, bold and blunt.
to myself because it was better than thinking, better than dealing with the ache in my chest?  That I
Steve scowled at Tony, but only for a minute until he turned his attention back to Fury.  Fury, who had a snarky smirk growing across his lips.
This wasn’t romantic, this wasn’t graceful.  This wasn’t him being brave, this wasn’t him becoming a model for the other children at school, a name stuck to an assembly that told kids to Ask For Help and to Not Do Drugs and to Talk It Out.  No, this was disgusting and greedy and selfish.  This was him giving up, this was him realizing that fuck, fucking hell, you’re all fucking liars because this has been going on for years upon years and no, I’m not doing better, thanks for asking.
Rhodey was there, too, but he looked to damn shocked to move from his post at the door, let alone speak.
He knows that if he had just signed the damned thing, things would be different, but that doesn’t mean anything would be better.
Well, a word from Tony himself.  Thanks to Natasha, he knows what Tony’s been up too.  Knows that he’s helping out that Parker kid, knows that he’s nearly perfected his assisted legs for Rhodes, and now knows that he’s helping fund and build a hospital in Lagos and equipping it with the latest Stark medical tech.  To make up for a mistake that wasn’t his.
Or well, he hoped it was his last love, because no one else deserved that pain, deserved that torment of being attached to Tony Fucking Stark.
“Hilarious, Barton.  Are we gonna watch
In turn, he offered the Captain a smile of nails, hopping of the bed and strutting towards the door.
“Aunt Peggy, I don’t know what you think you’re saying, but–”
“No, it’s okay, I was…”
“God, you’re, like, the only one who calls him James.”
It was, it was everything.  Really, it was.
If the public knew that the king of Wakanda was housing multiple fugitives, Steve is also sure the public’s reaction to T’Challa’s donations would be a bit different.
Maybe…
“It did, but I just…”
Wow okay, if anyone is still subscribed and invested in this story, apologizes that this conclusion took 9 months.  School took over my life in both good and bad ways, but I've completed my first year and now I have some free time!  So inspired by Mother's Day, I felt it was appropriate to finish this.  I kinda suck at endings so I hope this is enjoyable to you all!
The Twitter, however, he found to be rather amusing, since it was nice to
He still didn’t turn towards the man, he saw no reason to.  Angry Cap is something Tony’s seen before, and honestly, it’s getting kind of old.  The whole ‘stick up his ass’ routine.  Sure, he was leader, but Tony was a grown fucking man, he didn’t need someone who was biologically younger than him chiding him about what he did and didn’t -
It feels like history is repeating itself, with how desperate Steve is to find a cure, the lengths he’s willing to go, and doesn’t that feel like an iron punch to the fucking gut.
too soon, the limo pulled up in front of the venue, and Tony threw together his best fake glitz and glamour smile, one that the press ate up and the girls adored, the one that got him the donations he needed.
Tony didn’t know when the tears had started, but soon they weren’t kissing so much as Steve pressing his soft, gentle lips atop Tony’s forehead, shushing him, whispering sweet nothings that Tony was okay, that Steve was here, that everything was going to be alright, somehow, some way.
Tony glowered.  “I don’t know, but the bottle of Bourbon in my workshop probably does.”
Sure, Steve and him have been getting closer, ever since they put aside their differences after the helicarrier, apologizing for the whole ordeal (well Steve apologized and Tony mostly grumped something almost sorta kinda like an apology but to be fair that’s the best he’s ever done.  Really.)
But how could she have asked that of her friend?  Of the boy’s father, sure, but not of her friend.
“Stark?  Hey,
Part of Tony really expected him to leave.  Another part thought he’d go over to Tony’s kitchen and make him weird, calming tea or something.
, he had to--
Steve turns toward T’Challa, who’s poised at the door frame of Steve’s bedroom.  The King is dressed formally, a suit made of cloth, not of vibranium.
And oh, how
Tony sighed.  “Do you really think there’d be a UMass stop in New York?”
For all Tony could tell, it could’ve been years later when he finally came back to himself.  And really, did it matter?
“Penthouse, JARVIS.”
“Tony, are you on the subway?”
“Peggy taught it to you?” Steve all but blurted out.  Natasha raised a brow at him, but Tony simply nodded, smiling slightly.  “Yeah, I mean she wasn’t around much but when she was, she always cooked for me considering neither of my parents could cook worth a damn, and Jarvis deserved a break.”
Not that it didn’t hurt when she broke up with him.  Because, well, it fucking
Huh, well apparently he’d shut off his phone sometime during the night.  Probably smart, or ungodly stupid.  Not like he cared.
Steve shook his head, palms rubbing at his face.
“–she is more than happy to raise the child…she’s always wanted one, and as you know…”
“Had she not been related to me by blood, it wouldn’t have changed anything.  I loved her when she was my fierce and brilliant Aunt Peggy, and I love her now.”
Running away from Steve at every corner he found him at?
“Captain Rogers would like to add a ‘please’ to his request to enter the shop.”
“Are you sure?  I can have Fury get Romanov to go, and some other guys for muscle, he won’t--”
So what?
“Tony, seriously--”
“I’m leaving for Lagos today.”
Well.
“Are you okay?” she asked, eyes searching.  He blinked.
to me, especially not for Cap here.  What’s your version of home, huh?  White picket fence, tree house for the kiddies in the back, front porch with a rocking chair in the front?”  Tony shrugged, throwing his feet up onto the conference table.  “I, however, am fortunate to have acquired more than enough space for me, myself and I, what with a
Like when they went out for Thai food and Tony would make some stupid joke that wasn’t funny, not at all, and Steve would burst out laughing anyway, his eyes scrunching up as his whole body shook with the beautiful, beautiful sound.
Hey so this entire series was just meant to be a one shot, but then I started writing more, and made a sequel.  However, now looking back onto it I believe the entire story should just be one single story, instead of a series, as it flows better that way. So this chapter is exactly the same as what's in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of this series, but I'll continue updating the story on here instead.  So if you've already read Part 2 and have subscribed to that story, I would ask that you just subscribe to this one, as everything will be continued on here from now on.  Thank you!!
He pulls the little, black phone out from his pocket.  There’s only one contact in it.
That level of friendship was reserved for Rhodey and Pepper.  They’d known Tony for ages, knew his past, and knew his present.  Well, somewhat.
Comments and Kudos are always appreciated, thank you so much for reading!!
“It’s Thursday, Tony.” Steve deadpanned.
Clint shrugged, leaning further over Steve’s shoulder as his fingers scrambled across the keyboard.  “What, would you prefer
going to talk about this right now.  Steve had no right to pry - Tony didn’t care if he was the goddamn team leader or not.  Some things were just private.  And Steve knew that, of course he did.  No one ever pried him about Peggy, or Bucky--or
Snickering, Clint darted off, leaving Steve blinking between Tony and the spot where the archer once stood.
who was dying and bleeding and
Tony wrinkled his nose slightly, nodding.  “I suppose I could’ve.”
And oh god, he wish he did, because Steve didn’t deserve this, not at all.
“I didn’t realize how close Tony and her were.  He has like...all these pictures of her on his desk.  And there’s none of his parents, or Rhodey, or anyone.  Just...her.”
There was no heat to it, though, and he knew this was how Rhodey was coping.  He smiled, nodded, and let the man leave.
And Tony was growing annoyed, really he was.  Really.  Definitely.  Certainly.   Yeah.
Tony blinked, the question catching him off guard.  “I, Steve, you know that I--”
But after two days, Natasha let herself into his room, and presented him with a manilla folder.
His face scrunches up and no, that’s no good.  She wants to remember her son as he was when he young and thriving, when he was overjoyed about robots and cars and circuit boards.
Carefully, Tony reached out, clasping Steve’s hand between his own two.  “I think I’d like to begin again.”
Steve chuckled, smiling slightly.  “Goodnight, Tasha.”
But he has to, because he has to tell himself that the...Incident...was worth it, that it was worth it to get Bucky back, that it was worth it to treat his friends how he did, that it was worth it how he treated Tony--
“Who should I ask, Tony?”
He should listen to Natasha more often.  Maybe Garner, too.
Tony furrowed his brow, counting off his fingers.  “Uh...fifty seven?”
It happened all the time, really.  All the fucking time.
“You good, should I…?”
again and again and again it was happening all over again and he couldn’t deal with this, not now, not now.
“Tony, what are you burning?”
Well, to be fair, he never really fell out of love.  The love just kind of...changed.  Because he still loved Pepper, he really did, but they weren’t together anymore.  And really, it’d been for the better; Pepper was better off as Tony’s best friend, not his lover.
It was five days later, Steve trying his best to focus on his Avengers paperwork and failing miserably, when JARVIS called for him.
without–”
WIth a gasping breath, Tony jolted awake, covered in cold sweat and dread coursing through his veins.
“So you’re...in Boston?  On business?  Did you even tell anyone you were leaving?”
Tony Stark was not one of those things.
, Brucie, I just need you to take care of his friend.  I can’t protect him at the castle, there’s too many--”
“Well, I see you found out my
Tony’s face fell, and Steve rushed to continue.  “But, I would like to move forward from here.  With you.”
“What’s wrong with him?  Why is he--?”
Not to mention the father’s name was redacted, too.
As he made a shaky landing, he tried not to dwell on what Steve would think of him once he found out.
It turned out, Natasha only needed two days to hack into SHIElD (he knew Tony would have done it within the hour, but again, he was trying not to think about that).  It was two more long, agonizing days of going without seeing Tony.  Wondering what he was doing, if he was okay, if he was eating, if he was sleeping okay...
Uh, okay.  Right.
It might’ve been silly and stupid and dumb, but damn if it didn’t feel like the most sane thing Tony had experienced in awhile.
He’s not not crying, not screaming, not shouting.  No, he’s just...staring.  In shock.  In disbelief.  His head too full of it’s own noise for him to actually make any.  He doesn't dare glance at Natasha, because he already knows what she’s thinking.  That this is forgiveness.  That this is Tony’s way of moving on, moving forward.
“Let’s go to the rec room,” Tony said, he and Steve having vouched to take the next elevator, originally planning to go back to Tony’s floor instead.  Steve merely raised a brow, but didn’t say anything.
“Any luck?” She asks, a smirk playing on her face that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
And he was oh so royally fucked.
Did Peggy just not want to have a child?  Did she give it up for adoption?  That seemed possible.  She was so married to her job, it was certainly possible she just didn’t feel like she could raise a kid.
-----
So maybe that’s why it bothered him so much.  Because the way Tony talked about Peggy, was like Peggy was his, and, well, she wasn’t.
Steve seemed to process that for a moment, and Tony could practically hear his brain screaming in thought.  It was agonizing.
A groan came from the side of the bed, and Tony turned to see Steve, eyes struck in a fit of rage.  “Not
No, really.
Natasha stirs sugar into her own drink.
Good.  Because tonight, there was no Tony Stark.  Just Tony.  Only Tony.
Steve’s frown deepened; considering he himself was just a farmer boy from Ordon, he felt there very much was a need for formalities when you’re conversing with a prince you’ve known for all of ten minutes, but he decided to play along.  “Okay, Tony, when you said that...
Steve’s face broke.  It fucking
Finally, Tony spun around, and nearly flinched when he did so.  The man looked….almost ragged, too much so for a man who really, hadn’t done anything wrong.  He didn’t know about Tony’s “Daddy Issues”, because Tony didn’t bring it up.  Not intentionally.  But there was no real reason for Steve to beat himself up over it.
“Son of Stark has returned!” Thor boomed, grinning as Tony plopped himself into a seat at the dining table.  Tony rolled his eyes, as Clint came over to punch his bicep, carefully avoiding his injured shoulder.
“I haven’t opened it, and I won’t stay, if you want to be alone.”  Natasha’s soft voice would’ve startled him, if he had been more inside his own head.  But he’s just too overloaded with..with
Rhodey cackled.  Steve smirked.  Tony sputtered.
He blinked again.  “Are you going to steal my kidney and sell it?”
He sighed.  “Yeah, I guess I do.”
Tony was shocked still, but managed to pry himself out of his trance once he saw the team getting to their feet.  “Wait.  Wait, what?  What the fuck?  First of all, Clint, you keep your grubby little bird claws off my shit or I swear I will steal your kidneys and sell them on Craigslist.  Second,
So instead, he goes to India.  Sam comes with him, but Wanda stays back in Wakanda.  Steve had gotten a tip about a neuroscientist that works with some odd, nearly forgotten form of hypnosis.
and oh god, oh god he was going to die right here right now in the middle of this damn cave in the middle of fucking Afghanistan of all places, taken out first by his own missiles, and now by the people who were trying to get his missiles and whatever else they wanted from him but none of that mattered because he was going to die right here and maybe that wouldn’t be so bad, maybe it wouldn’t be so -
less.”
“Just play it JARVIS.”
After a week of not seeing Tony, Steve really started to worry.
Steve groaned, flopping across the table with his head buried into his arms.  This was such a mess, he needed to make things right with Tony.  With them like this, everything felt so...off and wrong.  This wasn’t like them getting into a silly argument, this
Steve laughed, already herding his first two sheep into the barn.  “There’s no way I’m going to be stuck with your lumpy bed for that long.”
“I haven’t seen your pants, I was out of town.”
“You love me, Tony.  I can tell.  I’m not as smart as you, sure, but I’m not stupid.”
But Steve needed the truth, and so did Tony.
“Bruce I swear to god if you call the fucking ambulance I’m sending all of your lab equipment to a community college.”
-----
College is weird?  Yup.  The understatement of understatements.  Really.
It was only minutes later, he assumed, when he’d come to.  He squinted at the fluorescents of the arena blaring down on him, trying to blink away the bleariness from his vision.  Someone was slapping him across the cheek, he realized (through the mask, thankfully).
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony Stark,” he took Steve’s hand, giving it a firm shake.  “And I’m a fucking idiot.”
“Lube...bedside table,” the man muttered, but Tony already knew this, of course, and was dragging the man with him towards the bed, letting himself be nearly crushed as he did so.
in Afghanistan, he blamed Howard.  Of course he did, because who else was there to blame?  To blame for the fact that his weapons were stolen; more than that, that it was his weapons, his creations that had killed millions of people.
Oh, what a fool he’d been last night, and any night before, to fall for Steve’s act.  Usually, it was just his own that he falled for.
At that, Howard’s jaw clamps shut as he stares at the ground.  Peggy almost regrets bringing up Maria’s infertility, but she knows she had to.  She knows that somehow, this is the right thing to do.
He hadn’t seen Steve in nearly a week, not since that...night, and he most certainly didn’t want their first conversation since then to be about his stupid halloween costume.
Tony sighed, turning his head to the side.  Where the fuck did this guy get off?  “Well it’s not the only reason,” he muttered.
Silence.
Steve met the other man’s gaze, the true meaning behind his words dawning over him.  “I would’ve come here either way.  No matter what, I would’ve come.”
Unless you want to count that goddamn movie.  Then, it started with the movie.  Tony doesn’t like to count that, but JARVIS does, so under all pretences, it started with the movie.  Tony’s just not very happy about it.
Steve gave her a determined, hard look.  “Well, I guess I know who I need to talk to.”
Nothing more, nothing less.
It was never meant to be romantic, never meant to be beautiful.  Just because he found romance on his way doesn’t neglect that what happened, what happened to him, was a disease, not romance.  Steve is romance, but Steve is not his cure, was never his cure, was never meant to be his cure.  That’s not the way this story was meant to play out.
It was a stretch, a thin, thin stretch, but if whoever this man was could potentially help Bucky, then Steve had to try.
Clint’s lips didn’t even twitch at the quirp, but he said nothing as Tony backed out of the elevator, the metallic doors shutting behind him.
Or well, something to that extent.
Once on his floor, the two of them made their way towards the bedroom, Tony shucking off his shoes as he went.  With a soft groan, he slid into his bed, curling the blankets around himself.
His fake name was called and he stepped into the ring, and the muscular man’s face twisted up with high, mocking laughter.  His breath was thick with the stench of tobacco and ale, looking absolutely smitten with Tony and his comparably tiny stature.
She offered him a small smile, one that would have been made of pity, if it had come from anyone else.  “It makes sense.  We all know she was your girl, your
He was at Central Park, when he finally lost it.
As horribly lame as the tweet was, it did catch Tony’s attention, and so he click on the Demetrios guy and.
Tony felt a slight sense of comfort when he woke up drenched in cold sweat, mind fresh of images of him in the damn wormhole, in that damn cave, in that damn barrel of water, to know that there were five someone's sleeping in his tower, just below him.
“Hey Steve!” Clint greeted, nearly crushing Bucky as he flopped onto the bed, with Bucky letting out a very indignant squack.  “You ready for tonight?”
So what if nobody would ever actually understand Tony Stark?  So what?  Did he really want people to?  What good would that even do?  It was ridiculous, the whole thing was ridiculous, his
Oh.  Oh shit.
The man, however, was nowhere to be seen, having seemingly disappeared before Steve’s eyes.  What Steve did see however, gave him an inkling of hope.
.  And now, Steve missed having that.
They had each other, they were fixing each other.  And it would all be okay.
“Well….yes, as sure as I can be.  Besides, I just can’t risk it.  Without the Hero we’re all doomed, and my magic can only do so much.”
or, like,
“I know, but I’m here now, right?”
When he reached the quinjet where Natasha was waiting for him she said nothing, her only acknowledgement being a raised brow.  At his face however, she clasped his shoulder with a upward quirk of her lips, and they clambered into the jet together.
Tony looked up from the pens he was playing with, furrowing his brow slightly.  It wasn’t an unwarranted question, but it was one that had already been answered in a previous session.
“Well, it shouldn’t be.”
on, so….”
Steve rushed out of Fury’s office, barely catching Maria Hill’s drawled
It’s aching, sometimes, the struggle of it all.  Steve’s at his side, of course, ensuring him that yes, it’s all worth it and no, don’t give up now because fuck if Tony doesn’t want to sometimes.  Why wouldn’t he?  There’s always an easy way out.
is, it’s not love.  Nope.  Nada.  Definitely not.  He would know, of course, because he’s Tony Stark and he’s a genius and he’s been in love before and he knows what love is.
Nor was they way Steve would look at him after a 72 hour working binge, with those ridiculously blue eyes and tell Tony to come up, go to bed, get some rest.  And fuck, how could he not?
He swallows.  With shaky hands, his fingers unclasp the latches, and he pulls the cover back.
“Yes you can,” Rhodey sighed.  “God knows he doesn't need it.”
Sighing, Tony walked over towards his coffee maker, snatching his empty mug from Dummy’s claw.  “Yeah, Cap, I know he short circuited my suit, but it was for like, 30 seconds alright?  And I defeated it, didn’t I?  Plus it was like, their leader.  So, bonus points, right?”
Tony Stark was, undoubtedly, a genius.  However he  wasn’t exactly known for his good decisions.
“I don’t think I always knew.  But somehow….”
“Tony, c’mon it’s okay I’m right here, you don’t need to be sorry Tony it’s okay, I’m fine, just please...please…”
in the matter, judging by the fact that he was currently being dragged to the surface, throat gasping madly for air.
“He’s good, Steve.  He really is.”
“I’ll see you around, Tony.”
-----
“Tony, are you….” That was Natasha, of course.  Like, no, not now.
Tony definitely knew he was only a story up when he jumped.  Yep.  Definitely.  Had it all under control.
, and if Rhodey knows what in Nayru’s name he’s talking about, it was taken by the Gerudo, and now I have to go to the fucking desert and retrieve it.  Or steal it...no, not stealing, it was stolen from me twice, so me taking it back shouldn’t count as stealing.”
Well, that hit him like a brick.  “Yeah, well fuck off then, if I’m too stupid for your liking.”
And he was okay.  For three days.
Maria glared at the both of them, but Steve didn’t let it phase him.  “Agent Hill, I need to speak to Director Fury.”
They stayed like that for some time, sitting on the cool floor of the workshop, nothing but the quiet sound of their even breathing.
They would play dumb games, too.  Sit outside Newbury Comics and people watch.  Rhodey got a point for each tourist, and Tony one for each college student (but Faneuil Hall was a breeding ground for tourists, so he got bonus points if he could spot an obvious freshman).
“How do you not know who Stark is?  He’s like, the youngest kid ever to get into MIT, he’s 17 and he’s working on his doctorate!”
So, quite a handful of years later on a bitter, February afternoon, Tony found himself on the green line, inbound towards Park Street.
The others looks were a mix of bored, nervous, twitchy, and overly excited.  Well, honestly Thor was the only one who looked happy to be there, his usual blinding grin on full display.  Natasha was glaring out the tinted window, with Clint attempting to play footsies with her (Tony swore the man had a death wish), and Bruce, well, Tony told Bruce that he really didn’t need to come, but he insisted.  Tony knew he was holding up much better recently, especially with all the shit going on (the ‘shit’ being their fucking lives), but still.
So at 2:34 in the morning, when Tony was jolted awake to find himself on the floor of his lab, drenched in cold sweat and
An asshat?  Yeah, almost there.  A selfish fucker who freaks out over movies and punches a grown man in the face over some petty name calling and then goes and gets a dick shoved up his ass, just to have Captain Fucking America come pick him up on the side of the road in some sleazy area of New York?
Ahead of him, the cloaked man let out a harsh cackle as he rammed straight through the gate, leaving an unharmed horse and shattered wood in their wake.
There was a reason Steve shouldn’t be doing this, shouldn’t be flirting so obnoxiously to some Italian stranger he’d just met on Twitter.  On his
Silence.
The pictures, costume, and comics were shoved back into a box, and into the corner of his workshop.
“Tony, wait!”
“Of course, Mon Capitaine, why wouldn’t I be?  Just uh, felt a little dizzy that’s all.  It’s normal.  Normal people get dizzy.  So.  Yeah.”
The prince snorted.  “No, I mean call me Tony, no need for formalities.”
Steve offered Tony a small smile, the tips of his ears coloring as he did so.  “Actually, I do.  And you…?”
It would’ve been a bold remark coming from anybody, but more so because it was coming from Natasha.  Someone who’d been taught and forced to put her emotions second to all, and now here she was, talking about depression and feelings and well, saving him from himself.  And fuck if it didn’t resonate with him, because it was true, all of it was true.
Tony returned the smirk.  “Yeah, you wish.  Takes more than that to get rid of a Stark.  Well, this Stark anyway.
For now.
He stopped, the look on Steve’s face sending an all new wave of pain through him, crushing, solid pain and he wanted
“Tony.”
Flirting was what Tony
in the 21st Century.  It was simple, it was relaxed.
Tony quirked his head, confusing in his eyes.  “Well….yes?  You are the Hero of Legend, are you not?”
He couldn’t figure out if this was a good thing, or a bad one.
“Did you really think rushing in like that was smart?  Did you really not think it through?”
“Suit integrity at twelve percent, Sir, I highly recommend-”
He felt heavy hands on his shoulders, rubbing as gently as the voice in his ear.  “Please, Tony.  Let me in, for once just--”
For a week, it went on, everywhere.  Everywhere
out cold.  He was fucked, he was royally and honestly fucked.
“Fury never gave me an actual file on Peggy, just some basic information.  Would there be...something else?  Something more classified?”
Steve blinked.  He hadn’t checked the age on the thing, but he supposed that yeah, Tony would have a fake ID, if he was only 17.  “Really, I can’t take that much from you.”
“Steve, get off of him!  Let him breathe.”
From behind him, Rhodey snickered.  Tony’s smirk grew.  “I’d say I know why, but you weren’t there that night, so my theory is moot.”
“It’s been
“I, uh, I have uh….thing….with-with the work, yeah the….work”
Loki figured it out, but the Triforce is tricky, and Loki himself trickier than most.  I, of course, have been under the protection of Hyrule’s finest for all my life, no need to worry there...generally speaking.  If only my father hadn’t been a lying--”
But it wasn’t
After shoving a handful of Benjamins into the bouncer’s hand, with a quickly muttered “I was never here,” he made his way swiftly down the stairs and through the clunky door.
It started innocently enough, when Tony had, surprisingly, cooked for them, and lasagna of all things.
“Let you explain?” He turned on a heel, meeting Steve’s gaze with impassive eyes and a raised brow.  “I don’t know what there is to say.  You went searching for information on Peggy and found a redacted file, but when that wasn’t enough for you, you were going to try and rip the information from Fury himself, no?  But now you know, and there’s nothing else to say.”
Sure it did.  Whatever.  It mattered to Pepper, it mattered to Rhodey.  Probably.  They’d probably be sad if he died.  Or something.  Pepper would, he knew Pepper would.  The rest of them?  Well, sometimes, it was really hard to tell.
Steve furrowed his brow, and wait, no.  Fuck.  Tony needed to stop talking, needed to get away from Cap’s blue, blue eyes and pouted lips and oh Lord, oh-
“You should be as lucky to go on a date with me, you asshole!”
Tony still thought that was a bold statement, and somewhat unfair, but he could tell that Natasha wasn’t done, so he let her continue.
At that, Clint went still, shock swimming across his face, soon followed by a frenzy of flickering emotions that Tony couldn’t quite decipher.
“I’ll follow you with my fake and you can follow me, so you have a starting point,” Clint said, and with a wink, he was off, leaving a slightly bemused Steve with his fake Twitter account, ready to face the world.
Reluctantly (and with Thor nearly dragging Steve out) the team left, leaving Tony to be poked and prodded over.
Out of the forest surrounding the ranch came a figure atop a sleek black steed, the man himself cloaked in green.  His garments billowed around him, and behind him followed a trail of bright, blazing flames, scorching the woods as he galloped. He hopped over the fence with impossible grace, staring straight at Steve but riding towards his best friend.
