“Fine, okay,” Tony agrees, nodding and biting his lower lip as he looks to the side at the black surface of the ocean. “The first night we went out. What was that? The dinner at the governor’s office, right?”
Steve looks at him sharply, his brows furrow. The change in him is incredibly swift. When he didn’t have the slightest idea what Tony aims for, he looks like he knows now. And he isn’t upset by that. At least not precisely. There is something else there. Shyness? Shame.
“I-I’m sorry,” he says, trying to wipe his face with the sleeve of his shirt, “I’m really sorry, I-I don—”
Again, there are tears in her eyes but this time she doesn’t try to hold them back. They roll softly down her cheeks as she closes her eyes, ducking her head.
"Man can't two guys be friends without putting us together." Tony says. "Brucie and I are just friends."
"So, how are you doing with the Man of Steel?" Tony asks and he sees the way that Bruce tenses at the mention of the man. "That good huh?" Tony asks.
"I'm checking that my major villains are in Arkham." Bruce told him. "Did you have a good car ride?" Bruce asked.
"Master Tony and Master Bruce have been friends for a long time." JARVIS answered. Everyone looked at each other they didn't know Tony had friends besides Rhodes, Pepper and Happy and themselves of course. Steve nodded but he wanted to go to Tony's room to see what they were doing.
They get ready for the party. Both Steve and Clark know that they will not be dealing exactly with their Tony and Bruce but with the ones that everyone's see.
"I did." Bruce told him. He got out to hear a knock on the door, he had gotten it right the Captain was going to come and check on him and Tony. He opened the door.
“Yes, hopefully, something can be done,” Bruce said knowing that something would be done. It wouldn’t end like his parent’s murder that he was sure of.
"Miss Potts." Lois says. "Is good to see you again, what can you tell us about your business here in Metropolis?"
"I could see you with your sketch book out." Tony whispered to him in the car before they had arrived.
"How are you feeling?' he asks even if he still isn't that good with emotions. But he knows that Steve is still taking Bucky still being alive not exactly well.
During patrol none of the criminals knew what was wrong with Batman, but they didn't want to find out either. He was being incredibly violent with them and even Gordon notice. When he was giving one of the files to the Dark Knight he had to ask.
"Bru…Brucie…" Tony said with a laugh. Bruce didn't care at the moment and sat himself on the floor with Tony.
“Well we knew that this might happen,” Tony said with a smirk. “We also know that we wanted to keep Peter in our lives,”
"You told me you had news you wanted to share." Steve told him. Clark smiled brightly at that and Steve was surprised. He took out something from his pocket and put it on the table. When Steve saw it, he couldn't help the smile and laughter coming out.
"Really?" Steve asked. "You mean the reporter they found with him in the elevator of the Daily Planet?" Steve asked he hadn't meant to know that but Darcy had been changing the channels and he saw.
"I've read your articles they're interesting." Steve tells him. "And its Steve, Mr. Kent nice meeting you."
The two couples were on the floor for their first dance. As they danced, the four of them could see that things were indeed different and that they were okay with it.
"Oh you think he is going to be all big brother on you." Tony tells him. "Which technically I am older but still I get it."
"Now, why would you call me that?" Superman asked him. Iron Man got closer and poked him in the chest.
"We are gathered here today to join these two couples in matrimony, marriage is…" the judge began and the couples were just looking at each other. "With the hope that never changes in the world and in your love…"
The little boy looked at him and the pain in those little eyes were some that he recognized on his own. The little boy moved and wrapped himself around him. He finally noticed that the people below had stopped screaming. As he came down Gordon looked at him.
"I Clark Kent take you Bruce Wayne to be my husband, when the you are being stubborn, when you push yourself to your limits, when you take on something you know is right when everyone wants you to quit, when you get annoyed at people who are slower in their thinking their yours; for better or worse, for richer or poor till we no longer can."
"Good I'll inform him." Bruce said. Clark pays attention and he heard a shower, someone was taking a shower. Before he could ask Bruce turned off his com.
"What is an arc reactor doing here?" Clark asks. Bruce jumps up and he has a batarang ready to hit Clark. Bruce focuses on Clark and shakes his head.
"So you only want me because you thought Tony wanted me acting possessive on your part." Bruce told him. Clark could hear the insecurities under there unlike anyone else.
Later that night Steve is eating dinner with the rest of the Avengers he is trying to concentrate on eating his food but finds that he can't. Since he took some soup to Tony's room for both him and Mr. Wayne, both of them hadn't come out at all. It's not that he doesn't trust Tony, he does its Mr. Wayne he doesn't trust like the man has some plans he doesn't know about.
"Fine, but I want to get back home tonight." He told Steve. Who was just thankful he got Tony to agree to stay, probably Bruce was the one that was going to check on him once he got better from being Hulked out.
"Come out." Steve said. He heard nothing else; he looked up to see Natasha standing there with a sandwich for him. It made him feel bad that he wasn't cooking but he knew that either Darcy or Bruce would take his place to give everyone food. "Is everyone okay upstairs?" he asked and she nodded at him.
Tony finally wakes up from his sleep and he feels a lot better. He goes to shower and change for his day. For once in his life he actually had a free day and that was not something that happened every day. Maybe he could watch a movie; no maybe he could talk the team into watching a movie.
"What the hell!" Tony hissed out, but it did sober him up a bit. "Fine, fine get out I'll shower, you could have told me I smelled Bruce."
"If you excuse us, I think Bruce and Tony agreed to give the exclusive to Miss Lane." Clark said and both he and Steve moved Tony and Bruce away.
"Can't be done sir, you have a meeting at Wayne Enterprises today at ten and you cannot be late, plus some charities wish to speak with you." Alfred reminded him.
"Do you want to go with me to Gotham next month?" Tony asked. Steve looked at Tony he had asked him to go with him.
"I have my own ride." Batman said and pushed a button to call the Bat-mobile to him. Superman saw as Batman leaped in the air to get into the Bat-mobile and he had a very rare smug smirk in his face. Hah Iron Man couldn't help him like that.
Steve looks over his shoulder, smiling. “Or he’s just aware that you’ll take his suit again if he allows Morgan to play with it.”
There are also evenings like this one when they all meet for a very early dinner and just stay in the kitchen or go somewhere else to hang out. And it’s just
Steve gives him a half-smirk and Tony starts to worry that he’s more than a little fucked because this small, private smile is even harder to resist than the piercing, ocean gaze.
Steve rests his arms on the bar and ducks his head with a long exhale. He closes his eyes for a moment and tries to distance himself from the party buzz around him. He feels like he’s the only one that has enough of it and needs a break. The others gathered in a fancy club at the top of a Los Angeles’ skyscraper look like they are having the time of their lives, probably treating this as some kind of going back to normality.
“Younger,” Wanda cuts in, arranging Morgan more comfortably in her arms and she adds very calmly but with curiosity, “He’s younger but he’s from this time.”
Still, he also knows that this is the least of their problems. If this is really Tony, he’ll get his groove back fast. Besides, in this world, resurrections are easy to explain. After all, some believe that they have been happening around the world for at least two thousand years, some of them even recently. This they can do. The press, the stakeholders, the investors and all sorts of people who really didn’t know Tony but depended on his creations are going to bite at this news like hungry sharks. But there are other people involved. Closer ones. Some of them are from the same blood and bone. Of course, Steve worries about this more than anything else. Because this? This creates all sorts of different and horribly difficult implications for Pepper. It also creates a world of unexpected pain and turmoil for Morgan who just said her goodbyes to her father.
To Tony’s relief, Steve allows it. He gives up and slips from the bed into his arms. He hides his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and suddenly takes a deep breath that’s followed with a pained cry. All those emotions, all those feelings stored over months or even years just burst out with Steve’s sobs.
He wakes up when it’s still pitch-black outside and momentarily knows he isn’t alone in his bedroom. The room is filled with the soft, warm light of a lamp. It barely illuminates a long figure spread on an Italian chair next to it. It’s almost a mirror image of the moment from two weeks ago, but this time Tony’s sure that Steve doesn’t sleep. And when Tony moves to slowly sit up, the man is also up, alarmed and ready.
Steve gives him a look. Tony doesn’t exactly know what it precisely means but he gets the feeling that the other him had been on the receiving end of it quite often. It must have been a peculiar friendship; he thinks and feels another sharp sting of emotion. Jealousy perhaps? Is he jealous of himself? That’s ridiculous.
Good, he thinks, and looks up again. He moves his lips so very slowly and doesn’t drop his gaze. Tony watches him with his eyelids half closed, his mouth open. The man bites his lower lip, holding himself from thrusting even though he can’t because Steve holds him firmly and drags his tongue only gently from the tip of Tony’s cock to its base.
And she is gone. Tony’s left alone in the workshop, where he lingers some more. He still has a lot on his mind. Thoughts are washing over him like waves; they come, overflowing with intensity and go. But it’s okay. He’ll have time to settle them on his flight back. For now, this is enough to know where he stands with Pepper. And what he can and will give to Morgan.
move. But he can’t. Tony’s dark gaze is locked onto his. His elegant fingers are wrapped gently at the back of Steve’s neck. His thumb still draws softly an outline of his bottom lip, brushing against Steve’s stubble. And Steve’s just mesmerized. Because, God, this— This feels good. This feels like everything he longed for. This feels like an end too. And the end of this horrible feeling of loss and despair. And still, he knows that he failed. He failed his mission. He failed Pepper.
And in a moment a holo-screen appears above the kitchen counter filled with articles, posts and tweets showing pictures of Iron Man in Whole Foods, excited comments and thousands upon thousands of questions.
Steve only nods and continues, “I saw Peggy. She was just— I don’t know. She looked happy but somehow, I felt she wasn’t in a good place. And I thought that maybe—” The stops for a moment to calm his mind and adds, “I thought that maybe I could find a spot in time where I could go back to, and I’ll try to fix everything. The crash, me losing my life and her losing someone she loved. In this way maybe I could even erase some pain from your life too. Because you know, I could prevent your parents from getting killed. Or at least influence it maybe in a way. I don’t know— It sounds stupid now.”
“But all the other people who returned looked and felt exactly like they did before the Blip,” Tony concludes. “Also, you told me that to time travel you had to have the GPS and the suit but everything you took from the past, even your clothes, came back with you.”
Her hand is still on Steve’s arm, warming his skin through the layers of his shirt and jacket that he still wears from the memorial. It all seems surreal to an extreme level. They just buried the man. He just tried to say his goodbyes. And now he’s sitting on a jet to go see a new version of the same guy? A resurrected one? Or another version from the past? And the weirdest thing is that the situation isn’t even beyond all the stuff they all have been through, and yet it seems so insane.
(It might seems like it's a last chapter, but I will tell you a secret - it isn't..... So stay tuned ;))
He thinks about another important person in his life. Two people, actually. Because it’s clear that it was him that screwed up at some point of all this. And it’s time to fix things.
And Tony is close. He’s trembling in between Steve’s hands and his lips, grinding deeper and harder. Steve is lost in this. In the sensations and the satisfaction, the pleasure of being able to take Tony apart like that, to make him his. And just when Steve thinks he’ll be happy to do just that, just please this man, Tony comes. The bitter taste spreads in Steve’s mouth when Tony’s deep moan of pleasure resounds in the whole room. He settles between Steve’s hands and his lips, at the verge of collapsing if not for Steve’s arm wrapped around his hips.
It’s not a surprise that Tony has coffee for breakfast. There is also another freshly brewing pot behind him while the man himself sits at the kitchen counter, rocking on a high stool as he reads something on a pad. He’s freshly showered. Steve can still see the moisture in Tony’s hair highlighted by the morning sun that burst into the room through the glass walls. He wears his usual workshop attire, a tank top that stretches around his chest and sweatpants, which means he probably doesn’t intend to rest and this is just a mere break. Especially that there are three of his suits walking around the kitchen, preparing pancakes, waffles and fried eggs, probably to Tony’s instructions that come from a small device sitting on both sides of his temples.
if he isn’t prudent (actually he is completely at the polar opposite), it still surprises him to see
Not thinking much, he uses the device next to the door, putting his palm on it. The scanner quickly reads his fingerprints and then a ray of blue light sweeps his face, announcing with cheerful sound and a green hue that it recognizes him.
“Yeah, well, what’s new,” Tony tries for seriousness, but he breaks into a full smile as he adds, “I’m also so irresistible that even you can’t stay away from me.”
“Fuck, I think I broke Captain America,” Tony says, sounding genuinely concerned when Steve doesn’t react for too long.
Tony moves back upon hearing that. He doesn't even have to pretend to be taken by surprise. “How did—”
The place is still a mess. Probably one reason why nobody asks a lot of questions and instead they lead them to the right place. Steve knows all hospitals around the world are in a similar state, trying to accommodate all these people that suddenly reappeared a week ago. There are patients still located in the corridors, patiently waiting for their treatments while the medical staff look like they are running on their last fumes, trying to suddenly solve a double number of cases of basically every illness or suffering. And for a second, he feels guilty. He should be here to help. He should be out there, trying to clean this mess they have been responsible for yet again, but then Steve takes one look at Pepper and knows he needs to be here for her, because even though she has been prepared for a battle, when they approach the glass cube, they are keeping Tony in, she shatters and takes a step back.
“If you fought with Steve,” Bruce says, looking up. “She had this way of strategically coaxing everyone into doing things she wanted so she always found a way for you two to make up.”
He feels more than sees that she shrugs. Holding a hand, she presses it to the glass. The surface warms under her palm that in perspective covers Tony’s silhouette outlined under the sheets.
Before Steve is able to react, Tony turns to face the windows and comes closer to the glass. He puts his hands into his pockets, holding his face up to the sun. Steve can see how the light takes over Tony’s body, illuminating his frame when the rays scatter on a dimmed, thick surface. There are millions of tiny crystal-like droplets that dance on Tony’s still damp hair. His back is straight, arched toward the warmth. His shoulders are broad and strong, and Steve can’t resist but to come closer and stand behind him.
“So do you think it was more like Jesus or rather something along the lines of what Buddha does?” he asks and sees that Steve looks up at him with bewilderment. “Or maybe something new? I like to be a progenitor of all new and strange things.”
She throws Steve a hurried and horrified look, asking very quietly, “Is this some kind of recording?”
The fear hits him hard. He undresses momentarily. And the next second he dives in too. The water is dark and restless, but he has been able to find people in worse situations than this. He stays under for longer. He paddles faster. He keeps his breath steady, so it’ll sustain him for a few more minutes. And above all, he does everything to keep his furious fear at bay. And in the same moment, as he tries not to let the panic overtake him, he sees Tony above him. Steve knocks his legs against water and resurfaces behind the other man.
Bruce and Rhodey join in but Tony doesn’t let his gaze leave Steve’s even for a fraction of a second. The guy smiles openly and with such ease that it's almost hard to believe he’s the same person from two weeks ago. He doesn't even look that tired anymore even if he stays with Tony in his workshop deep into the night and wakes up at ungodly hours for his run. No, he looks content and relaxed, and like he’s regained something in himself.
“We have a mutual acquaintance,” she says, and her smile widens as she stretches his hand toward him and adds, “Tony Stark? Although, yes, I know, he’s more of your close friend, while I’m just one of many faces from his past. Christine Everhart.”
Steve nods slowly, trying for a weak smile. He knows he looks like a mess. One that Pepper probably has never seen before. It might be the reason why there is so much worry in her soft gaze. Something that she shouldn’t waste on him but focus on Morgan.
“Not enough,” Steve answers bitterly to a forgotten question, and makes a gentle attempt to move back.
“Thank God, for me and my foresight,” Tony huffs and means it as a joke but Steve senses real relief hiding in his gaze as he asks suddenly, “Do you regret that you didn’t go?”
“Fantastic!” Tony finally smiles brightly as he shows Steve the exit. “I know a great place near the Santa Monica Pier. You’ll love it.”
Steve not only feels numb now, but he also seems to be expanding to the extreme limits, afraid that he might finally burst. Especially since he doesn't even know how to feel anymore. What is he supposed to do? Should he be happy? Scared? Excited or indignant?
Tony smirks as he steps in between Steve’s open legs. His fingers slip into Steve’s hair again and Tony looks down on Steve with fondness hidden behind his dark eyes.
He turns his face to hide it in Tony’s palm and kisses the soft inside of it. His own hands have already found their way to Tony’s hips. Steve digs his fingers deeper into the man’s exposed skin. Tony wears only the jacket; the shirt is probably lost on the beach. He must have rushed here, Steve thinks, leaving another small peck on the inside of Tony’s wrist before he looks up.
It should be more than this, really. But this thing with Steve is just undeniable. It hangs in the air between them. It’s in every accidental touch. In each gaze that lingers a little bit too long. In that soft smile that clearly belongs only to Tony because Steve never uses it on anyone else around. Tony’s sure he isn’t imagining it.
“Why don’t you go over there,” he finally says and points at Maria Hill. “And you’d be able to get all the details about how Stark Relief Foundation is helping to restore order.”
starts to grow a beard even though he’s still a bit square and occasionally uptight. But then again, who wouldn’t be after spending nearly seventy years in the ice and then being in a constant survival setup?
“Your phone,” He gives the device to Tony. “It might help with getting information as I know you’ll start to look as soon as you hit your workshop.”
There aren't a lot of them, maybe a handful, and from the thumbnails, it looks like all of them were recorded by the security cameras from around the house, after the sunset, and with a minimum of light. It’s clear that they didn’t want to be seen for Steve’s sake and him being on the wrong side of the law. Or—
“Come on, you should totally take credit for that. Even if it was a psychotic AI, it was still something incredible, from what I hear.” Tony winks at Steve and stretches over the counter to clip Bruce’s beer bottle with his own but moves back at the last moment. “You know what? This warrants a real toast. I should still have that bottle of Dom’59.”
“Then at what?” Tony presses. “I might not be the one with whom you shared a life, but I know you enough to tell when you’re holding on to something.”
“If you think that I don’t know what you’re doing here, you’re wrong,” Steve only says and gives him a half-smile. And then after a bit, he says softly, “It’s okay to be scared by this, Tony.”
“FRIDAY,” he says, drawing all their attention. “Could you please show me a recording from LAX airport, private strip, from around three weeks ago? You can also use a facial recognition scanner and look for me there.”
“It’s a long story,” Steve admits when they reach the entrance. “I’ll tell you all about it in chronological order when you get settled.”
It really isn’t. Not for him. And probably not for Tony who is somewhere in the crowd. Yet Tony can play the part of a Stark Industries co-owner to perfection, using his dazzling smiles like valuable currency.
Tony smiles back warmly at her, moving his hands up to cover hers. Squeezing Pepper’s fingers gently, he laces them together with his own to lower them into his lap.
Steve stays very still. He puts his box on the bag in front of him, observing how Tony dips a piece of bread in rich gravy and puts it into his mouth with a groan that’s borderline obscene. And for a second Steve’s thoughts sidetrack. He can only focus on how Tony licks the grease from his lips. How he closes his eyes, savoring the sensation of the first bite. How he smiles, easy and content when he glances up.
Pepper laughs shortly. “Oh, I definitely did. There were a lot of presents and dates involved. And a few buildings with my name on the lease.”
He runs his palms up and down Steve’s back. The long and calm strokes are in total discord with the way Steve shakes in his arms with another wave of violent sobs.
The other one fought with this fear constantly. And he died because of it. He can’t make the same mistakes. He can’t. He can’t push people away anymore. He can’t afford to lose them. And they can’t afford to lose him again either. He can’t do this to them. He can’t let Steve leave him again. He can’t allow Pepper to be left alone with his mess. And he can’t let his daughter grow up without a father.
“What I need,” Tony stresses the last word, “is for you to be well-rested and ready to introduce me to this brave, new world, tomorrow—”
Steve only huffs, ducking his head with resignation. He suddenly looks visibly tired and a bit crinkled just like his suit when he comes to the foot of the bed. He rests his hands on the footboard, letting out another long breath as he looks up, all open and honest. And for a second Tony thinks he’s a little bit fucked. Does anyone ever say “no” to these blue eyes?
It’s not like he doesn’t trust Tony. He does. He trusts him with his own life. This also applies to this version of Tony. Especially that this version might not fall far from the one Steve knew before. More so, he can easily assume that this version and the earlier one are quite the same, so Steve can say that he knows this man. At least to the point where he knows that trusting and having an endless amount of faith in Tony doesn’t necessarily mean that the man isn’t stubborn enough to make his point and do everything to get rid of a thorn in his side. And Steve is that thorn.
"Okay." Tony said even though it wasn't true once Steve left to the cafeteria to get his water, Tony got up and winced with every step trying to get to the door and out of the infirmary. He needed to get back to his lab and try to fix his suit for the next battle. He didn't make it to the end of the hallway before he smacked into somebodies chest, said somebody was Steve and he looked at him with a lifted eyebrow.
"I'm fine Alfred." Bruce told him. Alfred got this serious look in his eye and grabbed Bruce's shoulder before he move.
"He never brought anyone to the Manor before, with Pepper he stayed in a Hotel so you must be important." Bruce told him with a slight glare.
"You do know that if you hurt Bruce he is not the only billionaire that can get his hands on Kryptonite right." Tony told her.
"It's alright Captain." Bruce told him and the door opened to the common area where everyone was gathered and saw the man carrying someone.
"See we round them up easy." Superman said with a smile and Bruce glared at him. "Do you need a lift?"
"It seems Supes is about to figure that one out." Flash told him. "How much you want to bet they will get into a fight right now?" he told Hal.
"Batman 02." No he had to start his day in the Watch-Tower with Flash standing right there in-front of him and a smile on his face. Great, just what he needed.
"What is his plan?" Clint asked shooting one of the Hydra Soldiers down. Steve takes Red Skull  down and they really think it is over but…
“I will talk to the correct people, but you can take him, I don’t know what can be done Mr. Wayne-Kent,”
"We are finally getting cake." Tony said. Bruce moved there next to Clark and touched his hand, and Clark smiled.
“What about this I don’t believe that he has any family left, let me take him home until any danger to him passes,” Bruce told him. Jim Gordon could tell that he wouldn’t win this argument.
"What is code 31652?" there was no reason for Clark to lie and for Bruce to react like that it, it must be important.
"Yeah, so don't worry about it; all you have to worry about is Alfred feeding you." Tony says with a smile. Now he knew who the Man of Steel was but he was not going to say anything it would still be hilarious though.
He was currently typing in the monitor room checking what was going on in the world, when something came in.
"Bruce Wayne." Dr. Banner who was trying to locate where he knew the man now knew where he knew them.
The next day it was finally time for the big party that they had to do. The first ones up besides Alfred were Clark and Steve.
"Isn't that what normal boyfriends do?" Bruce asked with a raise eyebrow and Clark could see the amusement in his eyes.
"I know what you mean." Steve told him. "When I was in the USO Tour, I felt like a dancing monkey most of the time, when the thing I wanted was to be in the front lines, now I still feel like a dancing monkey except I think about just being with Tony and don't worry so much anymore."
“Richard!” Clark looked down to see Bruce standing there. The little boy had his eyes close and he was shaking.
"Well the good thing I guess is that Bruce keeps that particular life secret, but I did get punched by Flash and winked." Clark tells him.
"You will get back to your Captain don't worry." Pepper tells him and Tony actually blushes and that makes Pepper laugh.
"Where are we going?" Clark asked. He and Steve had been cornered in Avengers Tower by half of the team and some of the JL team.
Steve woke up and saw that Tony wasn't there. He guessed that maybe he had gone to see Mr. Wayne because he was not going to call him Bruce until he talked to the man. He got up and stretched before he went out of the door and climbed down. In truth he was following his nose which happened to lead him to the kitchen. He stood in the doorway and saw that Alfred was standing there. Alfred looked at him and smiled.
"Son of a gun." Steve says and out of his pocket comes out a box this one isn't black but a blue velvet. They both laugh.
"Fine, Cap." Tony said without a fight but it was mostly because he was really tired and his stomach told him, he was hungry. He walked behind Steve up to the elevator.
“Are you?” Tony asked. Steve touched his shoulder trying to calm him down., as they had an Ace on their sleeve.
"I'm not surprise, the glares he kept sending me when I went for you told me so." Bruce told Tony. Tony looked at Bruce.
"I would appreciate it." Pepper told him. Pepper was about to close the door to the elevator, but she stopped and looked at Steve. "Can I ask you a favor Steve?"
"Well what could you do?" Bruce said. They both walked down to meet Alfred already putting their breakfast in the table.
He began to type in the big computer what he needed and when the door open he ignored whoever came, they would leave.
"What?" Steve said and tried his own code that he had earned. When just like Dr. Banner it didn't work, he got desperate because that meant Tony didn't want anyone in and he was not going to let anyone inside at all. It made Steve really scared because he didn't know what he was going to try.
The business meeting had not been successful for Luthor because Tony told him 'no'. He didn't want to be involved in any business and it already had plans with other companies. The plan fell when Luthor told Tony that he wanted plans with the Iron Suit so they could mass produce it. Pepper had been the one to solve the problem her way and let's just say Luthor had never been of a woman in his life but Pepper Potts was the one person to reckon with.
Bruce looked at the Captain and wondered when he would notice his presence. When he finally he looked up he looked startle but his body seemed to tense ready for a fight for a few minutes.
"No but it is someone important to me." Bruce told him and it stopped Clark short letting Bruce go, it shocked him, he didn't know Bruce had someone important other than Alfred no one else. For some reason it seemed to hurt Clark and he didn't know the reason why?
"You broke it you buy it, the rules." Batman tells him and once he gets to the Monitor Room he closes the door in Flash's face before he begins to whine. He went to check the monitors mainly the one in New York, yes the Justice League knew New York was taken care of but being him and since he knew one of the heroes in person he liked keeping an eye. Like he told Alfred Tony was a big boy he could take care of himself.
Tony and Bruce have the luggage ready as they walked into the common area and Steve is the first one to see them. Steve sees the bags and he immediately panics.
"That sounds terrible." Batman says and Superman smiles. Before he gives Batman a quick peck in the lips that no one in the world would have seen.
"We'll be there Alfred." Tony said. They both got up and walked over to the dining room. Tony sees that Bruce and Steve are already sitting there and they seemed to be talking.
The two most famous couples and in the world had been married for the past 3 years to the surprise of many. As many had placed bets on both playboys ending their marriages in the first five months of marriage as other celebrities before. Of course, this didn’t mean that they didn’t receive letters from fans and haters.
"Fine, I just…I just…" Steve doesn't say anything and looks out the window as Cassie comes and brings them their apple pies.
"Yes, sir." JARVIS told him. Bruce smiled he had met the real human Jarvis and he had been a great man and the AI was just like that he may not be all human but he was great too.
"I love you too, Tony." Steve told him. They hung up and Tony was about to go to sleep for reals but he heard something. He went to look out the window and saw that there was a building that was burning.
When Bruce finishes Monitor Duty, he leaves straight to the zeta-tubes not wanting to see anyone at all.
“Wait!” Tony said as he noticed that some of the supports were weak and could fall at any moment. One of the supports came down and Tony cursed at seeing that Steve had gone over.
"How's Bucky?" Clark asked because they had found the Winter Soldier and it had been hard because S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Justice League had wanted to get him. But Steve had interceded for his friend and he was still alive and trying to get used to everything.
"What are you doing here?" Tony groaned out. It was sure that both Steve and Clark had not been wrong and in-front of them was Miss Everhart.
“Peter, where are you?” Steve asked but he was smiling. He could hear laughing in the other end of the couch.
Steve was cooking, he always cooked it seemed to keep him calm most of the time. That and the Avengers said he was the Mom of the Tower but not to his face they couldn't take the guilt-trip stares. Slowly the rest of the team began to assemble for breakfast. Bruce was the second one to come in and he pours his tea out of the teapot Steve had put on.
"Morning, Master Bruce, Master Tony." Alfred told them. He gives them plates filled with food, which all four devoured without any mercy. "All your suits are ready for tonight."
"I have work to do." He tells him and moves toward the Monitor Room. He knows the man is going to follow him.
"Noo… you won't." It was the first sound he heard from the other man but it made Steve's heart beat hard because of it thankful because of that.
"Yeah, this way we can both shine and I want to spend my time with Steve here on our honeymoon and with New York, Gotham and Metropolis taken care of at the same time all of us can enjoy our honeymoons." Tony said.
Inside Tony couldn't really think, he had just his bottle of whiskey in his hands and nothing more. He had been drinking after he saw Pepper leave the building. He tried not to but the nightmares were something he couldn't deal with. Maybe he could end it all, he could and the pain would go away.
"Well both of you come on, I still cannot believe you got into a fight in a casino." Pepper told them.
"I'm not." Clark said and kissed him full on the lips. Bruce kissed him back and he didn't notice when they were already up the stairs and out of the cave thanks to Clark floating them out of the grandfather clock.
"Bomb." Steve tells them. He was trying to think of a plan but it goes down to hell when Iron Man is already taking the bomb out of the ground.
"I'm doing fine actually going out kind of help." Steve told him. "Do you know, what would help too?" he asks and Tony smirks because that is one of the things he loves about Steve when he gets all mischievous.
"Well you better not wreck Bruce's heart or I will get Hulk to wreck you or I'll ask Thor." Tony said. Clark nodded; he knew that Tony was going to put it on him. There was a clearing of throat and they both looked up to see Alfred standing there.
“Alright, but you will have to explain to Pepper,” Tony said with a smile. “Listen to that little boy, you will be coming with us,”
"Cap, I really don't want a lecture right now." He told Steve, he couldn't sleep without the nightmares coming. He didn't want to admit that he needed someone there with him.
"By the time the entire street would have been gone." Tony told him. He was speaking of the new bomb Red Skull activated downtown New York trying to get the Avengers attention.
Tony and Steve were currently on Tony's workshop after Tony locked himself in the lab and the breakdown. Steve didn't want to leave the genius alone. He knew that Tony had problems sleeping he wasn't blind but he didn't say anything at all. Steve spent his time sketching and bringing food to Tony all the time. He was also the one to take Tony to bed after more than 10 hours of no sleep he was taking it slow. He also didn't want to admit it but he liked the genius way to much than he would like to admit.
"I had to asked Pepper and Rhodes." Steve told him. "They were both very shocked but very happy. It was a bit awkward."
"So we have Fury put in some of his agents." Tony told Bruce. "I mean since Steve and I are getting married they won't be questioning you for having them there."
"The place is burning I have to help." Tony said trying to convince someone even though no one was there.
Clark still couldn't believe, what Tony Stark told him. But the fact that Stark reminded Clark that he had been in Bruce's life for a longer time than he had, well it didn't help. So he threw caution to the wind or space really. He knew where Batman was and if the man was going to kill him well people can't say he didn't give it a try. He walked into the monitor room and saw that Bruce was already typing some report up.
"Overbearing Boy-scout." It's the answer he gets and Tony can't help but laugh. "Shut-it Stark." He says.
"I won't, plus I'm in the Man of Steels playground if something happens he can get me out of trouble." Tony says with a wink.
"Tony! Tony open the door you have to eat." Steve said. He didn't notice that Bruce had come down as well and he typed in his over-ride code.
When the music came on they both looked up to see Bruce and Tony coming up the aisle toward them. They stood in-front of the other and both couples looked at each other with so much emotion that everyone in the room could see it.
"Great will be staying with Bruce because I don't want to get anywhere crazies will get us and I want it to be as peaceful as possible. You're going to like it Cap it's all moody and old." Tony says.
"They are going to want to see my point of view, since now I have 'a front-seat' to these things." Clark told him fixing his glasses. "I don't like that, makes me feel like I'm objectifying my relationship with Bruce and I don't know, I don't like that at all."
"Precisely." Pepper told him. They both climbed down and walked together inside the building and Tony was already bored.
He gets his answer a few months later in the Manor watching television and he spits out his coffee when he hears Tony announcing to the world he is Iron man.
Steve suddenly moves back, and he looks at Tony with all the astonishment his blue eyes can contain. Tony thinks he can’t let him stay this way for long because he might suffocate.
He finally opens his eyes and looks around. The fear is still there. It might never go away. But at least he knows what is causing it. So, he moves and stands up. His legs are shaking but he still speaks to his intercom:
“I’ll do you one better. I know why you keep telling yourself this big fat lie,” Steve answers, smirking. “So yeah, been there, done that.”
“Is he, really? Only a friend that is.” Her eyes closely search his face and suddenly she smiles brightly and surprised. “When the rumors about the divorce broke, I thought that there might be someone else, but I didn't expect
“Tony what the hell—no, actually, don’t answer that.” Pepper sounds annoyed which is something he’s more used to. “Don’t move anywhere. Not even by an inch.”
Tony listens. And to his own surprise, he understands. Not everything. Not all. But he gets what happened and how it happened and (what might be the most important part) why it happened.
Morgan freezes at that momentarily as she sees how both men abruptly change their demeanor.  Tony takes her in his arms and looks over his shoulder at Steve and sees that he is ready and alarmed.
“The store?” Tony frowns, surprised with the question. “But that’s not important right now. You see, I have been reading and watching everything that FRIDAY managed to find on you and the rest of the guys, and well, on my life overall, and I just don’t feel it. It’s like I read a newspaper. So, I thought I need something more empirical—Steve?”
“FRIDAY, call Pepper,” he starts but then he looks at his bedside table where the suit’s nano-parts housing unit glows with subtle light and decides swiftly, “Or cancel that. We’re going for a ride.
“Yeah, right, now you want to talk,” Steve snorts and throws a T-shirt into the bag with too much force. He doesn’t look at Tony when he asks, “And what happened three weeks ago when you could tell me all about your plans?”
“But why?” Steve presses, trying to understand. “Why do you give me your time when you could spend it with your family?”
“How can I? I met you like—” Tony makes a show from looking at the non-existent watch. “—a few hours ago?”
Tony lands at the very back of the estate. The house is well hidden behind rows upon rows of trees. When he finally sees the whole construction, it doesn’t remind him one bit of the one in Malibu. It has nothing to do with the fact that it’s smaller than Tony’s current standards, or that it isn’t his style. It’s cute, really. But it gives him family vibes. It visibly doesn’t belong to Tony.
But then again, wasn’t Steve also a part of Tony’s old life? So maybe Tony only must remind him of that? Maybe he must prove to Steve that he belongs here, in this new reality. That there is always going to be a place for him in Tony’s mind. That he’s one of a very few people that Tony has this strange ghost of a memory. That they are meant to be close if not together. Maybe this is their time now. Because really, Tony wants him. He does. He doesn’t know how to explain it. He doesn’t know why that happened. He isn’t sure whether this is the reason he forced his body to come back. But Tony is sure of one thing. He wants to try and this time he wants to do it right.
“Muscle memory,” she says and takes a quick look at her watch. “I have to go back. Morgan is going to finish her breakfast soon and Happy can entertain her only for so long.”
“I don’t,” Steve says fast and now the pain that crosses his features is clear. “But I can try to tell you what happened. And then you can decide what to do.”
“It’s about your parents, but you know, I mean it’s not like your father wasn't fine—but, God, it’s not—” Steve stumbles on words in clear panic. “It’s nothing—not like
“What if he doesn’t want this?” Tony rises from his seat and goes to the bin. Throwing his melted ice cream into the trash, he adds with panic in his voice, “What if his position is like Pepper’s?”
“So why have I been naked?” Tony says, spreading his arms in a questioning gesture. “And when you told me that all my blood cells are on the youngish site—”
Steve shakes his head, trying to focus back on the subject. “You were planning these outings, then?”
“What?” Tony asks as he pushes on the door and looks back at startled Steve. “It might be a few years but I’m still a genius.”
“Oh, wow, that—” Steve looks for words, taken aback and frowns at Tony, asking, “Is this what this is about? Your teen fantasies coming true?”
It took them a good ten minutes to convince maybe-Tony (wannabe-Tony? new Tony?), that it’s going to be better to talk in person. Not getting into details, because obviously they didn’t know any and couldn’t even comprehend what was going on, they promised to rescue him from the current location if he’d swear to wait for them just a tiny bit longer. And they both knew that this Tony might look slightly different, and he might not recall the last fifteen years, but a Tony he was. Which meant it was safe to assume that he didn’t magically develop a habit of just patiently waiting for problems to be solved. In other words — they didn’t have much time to spare.
Tony is faster though. He puts a hand on Steve’s shoulder and sits him down. The gesture is so swift that Steve gives in to it without a protest.
Steve rubs his cheek into Tony’s warm palm, closing his eyes. And for a moment he can’t take it. He can’t believe that this is true. That this is happening. That this is
There's nothing wrong with that. Pep’s great. He trusts her with his life. No. Correct that. He wouldn’t be alive without her. She’s basically his caretaker. And of course, he sees how smart she is. How persistent. How loyal and just purely and simply good. God, flirting with her is always the brightest time of each day, especially when he feels it’s based on the very strong fundamentals of an unapologetic friendship where she isn’t taking any of his shit, and he devotedly respects her for that. But marriage?
“Wow,” Pepper exhales, suddenly sounding cool and collected like she would wake up from some kind of dream when she deadpans, “If this fact offends you that much, just know it hasn't exactly been a walk in the park for me either.”
“In the common areas,” Steve provides. “Everywhere in common areas. The compound was the same. It was just a matter of security.”
Biting his lower lip, Tony shakes his head. He takes a few more careful steps into the room, afraid that Steve will run from him again if he makes a wrong move.
Tony presses the girl tighter to his chest and nods, following Steve’s gaze as he looks at the yard from behind Steve’s back. He sees a dark-red car slowly rolling down the driveway that leads to the house. He can’t recall if he’s seen it. They didn’t even tell Happy that they were staying at the Eco Compound because they wanted to have these two weeks without any kind of pressure and expectations from anyone, so they kept it a secret. And on top of that very few people know the location of the house. So who the hell is that?
Tony makes a weak sound at the back of his throat, looking back at her with a silent plea but the words slowly fill the room as she speaks up.
“Oh really,” Natasha snorts and comes closer to him to hug him as she whispers. “I’m not the one who apparently was resurrected.”
be like that. Tony should get on with his life. He shouldn’t babysit Steve who detests these sorts of gatherings. Steve shouldn’t hold him back. He wants some of Tony’s time. He wants Tony’s attention. He knows he can’t have it all. He knows he can’t even wish to have it in a way he had it for that short period all these years ago. This Tony didn’t come back for him. So no, Steve can’t wish for
“The famous letter,” Tony says and looks at the man very carefully, trying to absorb all his reactions. “And what happened then? Did I forgive you?”
“I want you to come here and run all necessary tests that you can think of,” Steve decides. “Any information, even the smallest, is something.”
Steve takes another shuddered breath and starts to talk. It should be like any other story he’s told Tony before but this time it’s clear Steve tries to be precise and not opinionated. He doesn’t give much of his own comments or his own thoughts. He gives facts. And he tries to be as honest about them as he can, explaining the situation not only from his point of view but also from Tony’s and others. And never, not even for a second, do his eyes leave Tony’s during his tale. Even though it’s clearly difficult for him. Even though some parts are causing him pain. Even though from time to time he needs to stop and take another heavy breath.
, and who the hell are you? Pepper?” He glances at her, looking confused when he asks, “Is that your boyfriend? Did you hide a blond hottie in the basement of your house? Why didn’t I know about this? I should— Nevermind, not now, that’s far less important. Well, not less, but still… Now, I want to know what is going on here. Where are you?”
Sure, Tony and Pepper need to show a united front at the time of crisis. They also can’t keep the public in the dark about Tony’s being alive for too long. It’s always better that news like this come out in a controlled way. So, even if it means that he isn’t allowed to wear his dress uniform, Steve tries to do his best even while standing on the side, dressed in a made-to-measure black-tie suit and feeling like an idiot.
Steve finally manages to make a sound, but for some strange reason he can only get out, “Tony, it’s 2023.” And from that point everything goes to hell.
“What I meant to say before,” Tony starts again, trying very hard to steer his thoughts into another direction and be a better man. “Is for you to go upstairs and have some rest. Or at least take a shower and change. Knowing me, I must have some clothes stashed in at least one of the bedrooms. And you truly need them because you've been in the same clothes since we’ve met and that’s only the times I know of.” Seeing that Steve opens his mouth to protest, he adds quickly, “I won’t leave the house. I just want to see my workshop. Alone.”
He swallows tears but he’s unable to say anything more because the woman rushes toward them. She wraps her arms around Steve’s neck, drawing him in closely. Wanda also comes but she keeps her distance until they all hear a high-pitched squeal of joy coming from the door. Tony turns rapidly just in time to see Morgan running down to the yard.
Tony, on the other hand, feels like his anger comes down and plays closer to his skin. The fact that he has in front of himself one miserable Captain America who looks like he’d hold the wellbeing of a whole universe on his shoulders might help in lowering it to a manageable level. He realizes that he fights this out of misdirected spite. And just because he can, being who he is.
“It might be gone,” Steve says carefully like he’s afraid of Tony's reaction and looks suddenly panicked. “But I’ll bring something else from the cellar.”
“Tony, don’t you get it? He might not want this sort of life for the both of you,” Bruce says suddenly gentler. “Because what he always had? The guy’s life is a constant fight. First it was probably for pure survival. Then he had been thrown from one task to another, always serving someone else’s cause and it cost him losing a person he loved. And then when they woke him up, what did he get? Just more of the same. The guy should be a walking and breathing epitome of PTSD if not for the serum, but who really knows what’s going on in this selfless head of his?”
The burning of his stretched lips at the sudden motion is as delicious as the heavy weight on his tongue. Tony’s hands dig into Steve’s skull at the verge of pain and pleasure. And the man swears under his breath, trying to push into Steve’s mouth. He takes all the desperation and need and yearning that radiates out of Tony sucking him off with long, deep strokes that hit the back of his throat now.
“She went back to the East Coast,” Steve says, stretching on the chair and trying to move his head from side to side with a grimace of pain as he adds casually, “We decided that it’s better if you stay at the Malibu house and lay low while I try to help you with—”
“I know,” Tony admits honestly. “But can you do this now? Can you forgo the mantle of Captain America and be only Steve Rogers?”
Tony clasps his hands with a smirk that’s fond and a little secretive, but he collects himself quickly to add on a more serious note,
Admitting that also serves another purpose. Admitting that means the current situation isn’t exactly problematic. There were far more nasty things happening in his life. The loss of his parents for starters. So no, this isn’t another traumatic passage. He refuses to think of it this way.  Also, hey! He time traveled. How cool is that?
And Tony wants to finish the sentence for him, but suddenly all words disappear from his mind. Two people get out of the vehicle. One of them is Wanda whom Tony only knows from stories and news feeds and who has been MIA for a few weeks now. And the other— Well, the other person is a
Steve props his head up to give Tony better access and so the man rushes to swipe his lips over the hard stubble, biting softly on Steve’s chin before his lips land gently on Steve’s half open mouth.
-hurts. All these emotions, these boiled up, pushed back and hidden thoughts come out now. And he feels them on his chest, on his shoulders, pressing him to the ground. And he thinks of how the other version of him coped with that. Because he must have felt the same. He must have been afraid too.
“He was,” Steve says patiently, not able to resist another small smile when Tony watches him so openly. “Should we go?”
“I’m really not good at the whole couple therapy thing and you know it,” Bruce says and then stops to correct himself. “Okay, you don’t know yet, but if you want to talk over how to break to Steve that you are a free and willing man again, it would be better to find someone else.”
Bruce points with the spoon, silently marking Tony’s point, but then his gaze changes again. He briefly looks back to the room where it seems like the party is just really starting.
Tony. He wants to know if Pepper would get back her husband, the love of her life. And above all, he needs to know that Morgan would get her father back. And if he doesn’t get what he wants that’s perfectly alright. It would be enough to know that they are happy and safe. Because why would Tony suddenly appear from wherever, or
Steve sharply looks up at a blond-haired woman in her early forties. She is beautiful, dressed in a simple yet elegant black dress that smoothly flows over her slender body. Her hair is combed into a perfect disorder, her makeup is spotless, and her smile seems to be easy, but there is something sharp in her gaze when she scrutinizes him slowly. Yes, there is something harsh and familiar in that glance.
And Tony bursts out laughing. He falls back into the pillows. His voice resonates in the quiet room as Steve rises and leans over him to mockingly check if he’s alright.
The demigod actually listens. He puts Tony down, but he pats him on the arm a few times like he wants to make sure that Tony’s here.
“Seriously, you have to ask?” Tony sighs. “Because I heard we are good friends and isn’t this something a friend would do?”
He doesn’t want to hear if Tony calls after him (he does), and he doesn’t want to see if he’s being chased after (he isn’t), so he just shuts himself down, and doesn’t turn back. And like the selfish coward that he is, he runs. Just like Tony said he would.
Tony’s face contorts a little at the memory. “You’re sure it was a panic attack? I’m not having these. I’m a very stable person. Maybe a bit chaotic sometimes but overall, I’m steady—” Tony snaps his fingers when he looks for a word and adds quickly, “Anchored! That’s the word.”
Another burst of laughter cuts into his thoughts. He sighs and puts the tablet back down again. He hesitates maybe for one second before he finally throws off the covers. Grabbing his robe from the bedframe, he throws it over his tank top and runs downstairs. His bare feet make a sound on the wooden stairs as he quickly descends into the kitchen.
Steve’s fingertips dig into the cold metal and like on autopilot, he holds his head up. Tasting the salt of his tears that have run down his face, he presses the play button. There is a faint hum of a running system when the helmet comes to life and finally an image materializes in front of him. And suddenly there’s Tony casually sitting on a chair behind the coffee table.
Steve snorts a weak laugh and takes another breath before he says, “Okay, so to come clean— There was a moment. When we went back.”
“You know,” Bruce starts without even trying to cover the fondness that sneaks into his voice, “I think I really missed those constant attempts of leading us onto the wrong path.”
Steve leans on the desk behind him, crossing his arms when Rhodey glances to the side. He exchanges looks first with Clint and then with Bruce on his right.
He reaches for Steve and pulls him in by his neck. And when he closes his lips over Steve’s, a small murmur of pleasure resonates from the back of Tony’s throat. Steve kisses Tony’s lips hungrily, biting them. He leans even closer and closes Tony in the space of his arms. And it all feels like it meant to be. Even if he gave up. Even if he thought that he doesn’t have the slightest chance to do-over his life. Even if he knew that he can’t go back and change the past so the people he loves would have a better future. Even if he thought that a sacrifice is the only way. This feels right. This
“Well, the Avengers’ compound is out of question for the time being,” Pepper says, holding her gaze up when she smiles weakly.
When Steve looks up, he sees the man focusing on the ocean again. His almost black eyes follow the movements of the waves. His lush hair is tousled by the gentle wind, caressing his cheekbones. Nothing is left from the subtle construction that was there when they left the house. Tony looks raw. He looks beautiful. He also looks free and incredibly young. Far younger than even when they’d first met. But that’s not the point. Because Tony also looks content. He looks calm. Happy. So incredibly
Tony was driving back to Malibu as fast as he could. He’s happy that Steve decided not to take their car, but he also didn’t like the idea of the idiot going back to the mansion on his own while being so completely not himself.
“Uncle Steve!” Morgan whines and she throws herself dramatically over the countertop. “It’s awfully long!”
Steve waits for the suit to uncover his face and when he can finally see it, he comes closer. “Where the hell have you been? I’ve called you at least a hundred times.”
His voice is calm, so damn calm, Steve thinks. Tony’s dark eyes are soft and warm. And he smiles like everything is still right with the world, even if he isn’t a part of it anymore. It almost looks like Tony is here with him when he stands up and turns the chair around to sit on it. Resting his arm on its back to prop his chin on the back of his hand, he speaks softly.
But not this time. This time Steve searches the room to find Tony’s familiar mop of black hair in the crowd, and he can’t find it. This time Tony just disappeared. And that's alright. It
Tony’s mesmerized by the picture. He sees that Steve doesn’t pretend to be interested. He doesn’t do it to humor Peter either. Steve deeply cares and wants to know Peter more. He tries to include him. He also tries to build some kind of family.
“Morning, Rogers,” he says, not looking up but still adding mindlessly, “You aren’t Capsicle anymore. Don’t just sta—”
“I didn’t do anything to have her!” Tony says the words like they have a bitter taste. He bounces off the desk to get into Steve’s space and points a finger into Steve’s chest. “You don’t get how it feels to suddenly wake up and have your whole life taken away from you, replaced by this something that you don’t know what to do about.”
“A panic attack. “Pepper recognizes the signs, observing the situation from behind the glass and her voice carries all the sadness of the world when she adds, “He gets a panic attack at the mention of a kid with me.”
“—I know,” Tony confirms quickly. “I also found your letter. I had it in my files on the server, so I suspect I got to know about my parents’ death under not particularly present circumstances. And that ripped some kind of rift between us? I gather this is the reason you’ve been on this run you mentioned today, right?”
For so long he’s tried to fight this. He’s tried to make it right. And now he learns that there was never right or wrong. It's just that. A life. One where he can’t make all the decisions. One where sometimes he just must let himself be carried away. And this scares him because for all these years he’s always had a plan. And the plan was that if everything fails, he’s willing to sacrifice himself. And now Tony shows him that he has other choices.
And that must be it for Tony because he puts his food down. He wipes his lips with the napkin, throwing it into the box with a bit too much force.
“By touching someone I can tell what that person feels but at the same time I share these feelings,” Mantis explains softly. “You looked so pleased while glancing over at Captain Rogers, so I thought I’ll check if it feels as nice as it looks.”
“When I was downstairs I thought—” Steve’s face twists in discomfort as he tastes the alcohol. It’s clear that the drink isn’t his thing, however, he collects himself quickly and finishes his thought, “FRIDAY should be able to provide a recording from the party.”
This hit Tony on a few other occasions before but now it just strikes him hard. Because what would be the reason for Steve to know what goes in and out of his wine collection? And how is it possible that FRIDAY knows all the music Steve loves so she adjusts the playlist every time the man enters Tony’s workshop? In the morning, she provides him with a set of news clearly preselected for Steve’s needs. She also feeds U all the recipes for protein shakes Steve likes but Tony’s sure he doesn’t really have to drink them. But that’s not the point. The point is that this is one hell of fascinating information. Because someone had to program FRIDAY this way. Someone had to give her this information at some point. Was that the other Tony? Or Steve himself? And if so, when did that happen?
"What are you doing?" Steve asked the man as he moved out of the way; Dr. Banner was trying to calm down. Bruce ignored him and tapped his code in. once the door open Bruce went in and before Steve and Dr. Banner could get in, the door closed in their faces in a snap.
They both flinch at the mention of his title, but Steve’s the one who says, unsure, “Yes” and murmurs to Pepper with confusion, “I thought this connection was supposed to be blocked?”
“This is what we’re going to do,” Tony proposes carefully, poking a finger in Steve’s chest. “You’ll go upstairs—”
“So, you’re trying to say—” he starts slowly. “—that there wasn’t a chance this would go in any different way?”
Steve knows the reason for that. It’s simple. Tony doesn’t carry the burden of the past. He doesn’t have scars. He doesn’t regret it. He doesn’t hold grudges. He really is free. He can start his life anew, filling again all the blank pages with events that can be uncontrolled by pain and loss. And for a moment Steve feels a pang of envy. He even thinks that he’d give a lot to have another chance at his life like that. And just like that, he understands. He’s sure of the reason why Tony came back in exactly this form in the first place.
He still has his white shirt and slacks from the suit on. The shirt is a little bit damp and completely wrinkled now. It sticks to his skin, stretching on his broad shoulders. It should look terrible, but instead it matches his tousled hair and the wild emotions in Steve’s blue eyes. It’s a spectacle, Tony thinks as he takes a few more steps closer.
Tony looks small in a huge, white bed. He’s surrounded by equipment that emits a low hum that Steve can pick up even from their position. Constant and steady beats of a heart. Inhales and exhales of every breath. Undisturbed lines that rhythmically go up and down with every reaction and thought of Tony’s mind. And suddenly there is a pang of a strong, sharp feeling. He’s excited. And scared. Uncertain. But also, so uncharacteristically exhilarated it might seem borderline guilty.
Steve smirks, opening the zipper slowly. “You once told me that everything special about me came out of a bottle.”
“Very,” Tony says and smiles, glancing over her shoulder at Steve. “And very delicately so the subject doesn’t know what the whole thing is about.”
“I could take that joke to so many levels, but I won’t,” Tony says as he starts to pour the bubbles into the glasses that Steve swiftly provided. “What’s the toast?”
The man looks like he’d fall into a million pieces. He closes his eyes to hold on to emotions. Tony can spot the way Steve’s knuckles go white when he intertwines his fingers tightly. His arms are trembling when he tries to hold his strength inside him and not to let it go and destroy something.
“I’m sure we’ll figure something out,” Pepper assures him and leans over to put her hand on his shoulder and look straight into his eyes. “I’m sure we’re all going to be okay.”
-so-tight T-shirts and very-flattering jeans that reveal every tiny detail of Steve’s body. That’s why Tony’s the first to spot him the second he passes the kitchen’s entrance.
“Captain, I have a message from the Benatar and as you’re not sleeping, I thought you might want to hear it,” she suddenly draws their attention.
It might be because he sees these events in a different light too. He has a completely changed perspective right now. He isn’t burdened by the fear he probably felt back then. He also doesn’t regret his actions because he didn’t commit them. There is no remorse. No resentment. Because of that, he doesn’t look through the lenses of his mistakes and bad decisions. He thinks clearly. And he sees that they both made wrong moves and didn’t choose the right paths. They were both to blame but at the same time, they were both right. And Tony thinks he should have tried harder. He should have tried to understand Steve's motivations. He should have found a solution earlier. He should have fixed it.
Tony laughs out loud and sits at the bar with a glass of whiskey on the rocks. Bruce looks at him with a curious stare but Tony just shrugs.
“The other me knew that I was never going to be exactly like him. You agree with that, yes?” Tony proposes, waving a hand at Steve to prod him into agreeing. When the man nods shortly, now fully focused on Tony, he continues, “And you were right, thinking he wanted a normal life for new-him, who is me.” He points at himself and takes a deep breath before he adds, “But I think you failed to understand that I got to choose how this normal life is going to look like and how I’m going to spend it. Not him. Not you. Not even Pepper. But
“Maybe I wanted to torture you a little?” Tony proposes with a sudden smile but seeing that Steve isn’t amused but rather still miserable, so he shrugs and admits, “It still feels foreign. I mean, not the parents' part. I’m still flipped. I can’t pour down the rain of mass destruction on Hydra. But the part where I’m mad at you doesn't exist in my memories. I didn’t live through it, so I don’t feel it. You told me now and you had a pretty good reason to wait too. And don’t get me wrong, I’m not going to be best buddies with your buddy Bucky, but this feeling doesn’t have much heat.”
“Hey, I can’t save the world anymore. The other me already did that.” Tony shrugs. “So at least I could save us from starving.”
Pepper’s been gone for a week. It’s the first time she’s left Morgan with them for so long. But she’s still the CEO of Stark Industries and when three weeks ago he decided to completely step down from all the functions at the company, he also gave her even more responsibilities. They both decided that they're going to look for her replacement soon, giving Pepper some peace of mind, but for now, Tony thinks she enjoys her time away and the feeling of being among adults and non-superhumans. He feels that she also wants to give them space so he, Morgan and Steve can figure out their own dynamics.
After all, there's still a ton of work to do in order to restore at least a vague sense of normality. Somebody also must place the stones back. And naturally, Steve would be at the top of it. He would plan and help to reconstruct and revive everything that was within the limits of his power, having Tony with his brilliant mind at his side. And just like that, Steve would know what to do, where to move and where to aim. And maybe they would still fight over the hows and whens but he would at least have a sense that he’s capable of feeling something. Because now? Now there is only this numbness constantly spreading throughout him. It started the minute he saw Tony dying, but right now it pours from Steve’s heart to every cell of his body. It overtakes him. It creeps into his mind. It completely wins over everything he is, leaving behind an empty shell of his former self.
“I’m saying that this is the first time his life can be only his,” Bruce adds stubbornly. “And that no one even cared to ask him what he wants to do with it, so he’s just—”
“Yeah, that sounds like me,” Tony huffs and drums his fingers on the housing unit before he asks, “So you weren’t mad?”
“You must have snapped the fingers one more time when you were already dying.” Steve finally gives him his clumsy explanations. “Because you were grasping for last traces of life, and you were in pain, and overall, the stones were drawing from you, the thought that activated them wasn’t precise or even finished.”
“I lost so many chances,” he finally says very quietly with clear pain written all over his features. “First after Ultron, then after the Snap and probably a dozen more after the blip, and it’s all because I’ve been scared that I can’t give her what she wants.”
Tony catches Steve’s gaze that still lingers on him and narrows his eyes, smiling suspiciously. For now, he pretends that he hasn’t caught the fact that his question wasn’t answered and asks Bruce instead, “When was that?”
“My kind,” Steve says bitterly. “And here I thought that’s what people say about journalists and how one never can lower one’s guard around them.”
Almost because in the next second he swiftly opens his eyes to a sudden realization. It’s morning. He hit the bed straight after the shower, something like twelve hours ago. He was supposed to take a power nap, but his head barely touched the pillow and he was out for hours. And he was supposed to get back to Tony. Fuck.
Tony kisses him delicately once. Twice. One more time. One more tender catch of his lips until Steve eases even more in his arms and chases after him.
She’s probably plotting a master plan with Fury. They discuss how to keep all of this under wraps for now. After all, it's only been a few days since the world heard about the battle that smashed at least half of New York State and led to the sudden appearance of lost souls. A battle that took Tony Stark’s life and made him a new international hero, a symbol and an icon. That is one hell of a pair of shoes to fill. Steve can admit it’s a fucked-up position to be in, pardon his language. The short-term solution is to try and hide Tony from all that until his memories come back, or they sort out whatever has happened to him.
“In a given situation we wouldn’t either,” he finally says, breaking into a smile. “But you owe me for my future bypass surgery.”
“And I’m totally with you.” Tony holds his hands in a surrendering gesture to stop Steve from a tirade that builds at the tip of Steve’s tongue when Tony adds fast, “But I also saw you after it ended with him. You looked like you just fought with him physically and he was another Hulk. And even though it wasn’t corporeal, it still cost you a lot.”
Steve gives Tony a careful look. Tony’s concerned as he glances at Steve and tries for a soft smile. And this. This bothers Steve even more. There was something in Everhart’s play that threw Tony off. But it’s also clear that Steve isn’t going to get this information now.
“The one and— Yeah, it’s me,” he huffs into the intercom and adds before she can cut in, “Are you free in like a—minute? Can you meet me downstairs behind that lovely wisteria tree that goes up the north wall?”
look. Somehow it seems even more frightening than before. And he visibly grinds his teeth when he huffs out audibly and forces a pair of jeans inside the bag.
“But aren’t we done here?” Tony notices. “If I am not mistaken, and I rarely am, I’ve given my life for this word. Isn’t this enough? Because if not, then where do we draw the line?”
And Steve is all for that because of course, he feels responsible, and he wants to ease the effects of their decision as much as possible, but he also starts to feel unbearably tired. The constant fight that happens in his head between reason and feelings is exhausting. He doesn’t know how he could do this before. How the hell did he survive that before? Or maybe that's it? Maybe that's his mistake? Before he gave in to this weakness, broke all his rules, and embraced something that should be well-hidden and forgotten?
Before Tony can object, she grabs him by an arm and drags him away from the house and deeper into the woods.
Tony’s cock throbs against Steve’s chin at the movement. It leaks and leaves wet patterns on the skin of Steve’s neck. The man hisses above him as he tightens the grip in Steve’s hair. And Steve smiles and is thankful that some things about Tony haven’t changed.
“God knows I’ve tried,” Steve says under his breath. “But you’re like that dog from that movie. You always come back.”
In Tony’s opinion, everything goes rather smoothly after that heart-to-heart with Steve. And his life might have changed by hundred-and-eighty degrees and he might have gotten a proverbial kick in the ass that slowly results in him opening his eyes to many things, but at least he feels that this is his own path, not the other guy’s whom he came here to replace. Especially that he’s getting back his best friend and a grasp of this new reality.
And Steve put his food down again. He feels like his throat tightens when he remembers the look of realization on Christine’s face and her words just before Tony joined them. He tried to ignore them all their way up here, but now it just hits him again.
Steve needs to beat his hand around to stay in place when a next, stronger wave ironically comes crashing into them. Its movement brings Tony into his space. The man wants to reach for him but Steve shifts back out of his grasp.
“I’m a superhero. Apparently,” he says, looking up from the screen and winces. “I also died. And top of that, I’m partially responsible for defeating yet
Steve blushes again and gives a small and very strange smile. “Yeah, after a week or two you asked me to meet you. And you proposed to meet here, actually.”
Pepper winces lightly and then admits with a forced smile, “You proposed with a huge banner carried by the suits above St. Mark's Square.”
“No,” Tony says firmly with his faceplate down as he carefully touches down. “No, it’s me who has to apologize to you.”
“But it doesn’t make it any less heartbreaking that she can’t enjoy it,” Bruce whispers and there is a moment when his eyes glister before he collects himself quickly. “I’ve been thinking—” he starts again but then suddenly stops himself.
“I know everything,” he confesses, not wanting to wait any longer. “Steve told me some of it, and then I learned a few things on my own.”
Steve finally opens his box because he has only so much self-restraint, but he still doesn’t want to forget about the fact that Tony put far more thought into this than Steve expected. Mixing his chilli with the rice he finally answers, “It’s not, but it’s just surprising.”
“Just so you know and in case you have something against it, I want to tell you that I’m going to kiss you right now,” Tony says carefully, holding Steve’s gaze.
“Will you let me take you home if I promise to show you many, really many, things you are going to like?” Steve proposes stubbornly.
And this time Steve makes a strange face again and only nods sharply. There is this adorable blush that appears high on his cheeks every time he’s abashed by his own actions. Tony can make this assumption because he already learned how to read some of Steve’s little quirk and whims. It’s not many of them and it makes it all the easier to read him. All the easier to like him. To be addicted to his presence. Only based on that Tony already knows he can’t just simply go his way and spend his newly given life someplace else.
He tangles his fingers into Steve’s hair and gently prompts him to look up. Steve’s a mess. But he’s a beautiful mess that only Tony gets to watch like this. And in this very moment he understands what this is all about. He understands what he’s really fighting for and what Steve means to him.
And thank you all of you, who read the story, for all the comments and kudos, and reads. They are food for my creative soul!
Steve gives him a doubtful look as he takes another sharp turn to climb the road up. It’s maybe because he insisted on being present during Tony’s discharge from the hospital. He knows that Tony is kind of okay only and he really wasn’t good when somebody brought him in. Apparently, he had been dehydrated, starved, and freezing when people found him unconscious and butt naked on the LAX airstrip. And he’d been in strange coma for almost two weeks after. Physically he recovered but the good doctor back at the UCLA Medical Center was skeptical of whether to let him out without some robust and in-depth tests. Steve only agreed with Tony on the need for his release because Tony made a point that there are many more people who need medical care and wait for the space he takes. But as a result, Captain possesses unnecessary knowledge now, and because of that, he seems to be even more of a pain in the ass than before. Tony has a slight suspicion that he isn’t going to get rid of him anytime soon, which is annoying on many levels.
But it’s a lousy try even for Steve’s ears because he stops at the last moment and says, “It’s about Nat.”
But Tony is committed to his plan because he stops in a half move, just before he means to completely pull off his pants and looks up at Steve. “Are you joining me or not?”
, that’s something he would never think of as a priority. But that’s the exact word that pops into his mind when he looks at Steve who explains something to Rhodey with intensity.
“I hear the guy’s pretty strong.” Pepper gives him a sly smile. “He’s a super soldier, or something.”
calms down. Tony can feel it under his palms. He moves them gently on the man’s back, never stopping.
Tony tries to sound carefree, but Steve instantly picks up on the way Tony’s voice is modulated and controlled to know he is restraining himself. Also, the hand is gone from his lower back. Instead, Tony snaps his fingers a few times, pretending that he's thinking.
He also realizes he trusts Steve. He just does. It might be the same kind of inkling that happened with the suits. It’s like muscle memory. Or maybe more a genetic one? It doesn’t matter. What’s the matter is that when he listens and looks into these blue eyes filled with so many contradicting emotions, so much fear and guilt and sorrow, he finally gets it.
“Yeah, right,” he grunts and pats Steve’s chest with the back of his hand with a silent gesture for him to move.
Tony sees through the window of their rented SUV that the world seems to dip in true disorder. And not in a funny way. The traffic jams are far more intense than he remembered. People seem to be behaving with confusion and like they are in frenzy, often breaking driving regulations while clearly police don't have enough resources to keep track of them. Because of it, he barely registers how the surroundings have changed and how the area gives a completely different vibe. Barely is an operative word here. He still spots a few new buildings here and there, cars that look cooler and are finally running on electricity, or the overall jump in tech that seems to be accessible to everyone. If he wouldn’t have believed that he’s in the future before, he would certainly believe it now.
He feels a sharp stab in his chest. It’s panic. He recognizes it now. It starts in the same way it did yesterday. There is the feeling of someone trying to grab his insides and just ripping them out together with the air from his lungs. His heart is rushing. His vision is blurry. He can’t breathe. And this time there is no one around to help him. There is no steady voice to guide him back on the surface. There is no warm touch to ground him. There are no blue eyes that he’s going to see when he opens his.
He’s able to glance at Steve. There’s a small smile that plays on the bastard’s lips. He ducks his head to hide it, but it still reflects in his intensely blue eyes.
“Because I’m your friend too,” Steve suddenly exclaims with an irritated huff. “And I guess you intuitively know that. Just the same way as I know you’re annoyed by the fact you don’t have control over this situation. But I want to give that control and help you to learn exactly what happened.”
But before Christine can say any more, she appears to spot something in the distance. She moves a step back instantly, putting on — again — a fake but polite smile.
Tony looks back at him with his smile still reflecting in his eyes. “I had the worst crush on you back when I was a teen.”
To think about it, Tony’s life can be considered pretty boring. Well, before all that happened in the last few hours, so — could be considered pretty boring.
Tony inhales sharply, his hand that settled in Steve’s hair tugs at the strands when Steve drags his open mouth slowly through the exposed skin. Tony’s ready. Steve felt him hard for some time now, but he doesn’t want to rush. He wants to remind himself how Tony feels one inch after another.
Peter does untangle himself but only a little. He stays at Tony’s side when Tony finds a spot among others.
“On my father’s grave,” he starts with a broad smile. “I could never guess that you’re able to pull one more trick, Stark. You look good. Young.”
“Geez, Rogers,” Tony huffs, rolling his eyes. “You’re quick to jump to that conclusion. And contrary to a popular belief I don’t sleep with my assistants. Well, I haven’t at this point at least. There are some standards in life one needs to uphold.”
Tony opens his mouth to instantly retort but anything he wanted to say freezes at his lips when the meaning of Pepper’s words hit him. He holds a hand to stop them from adding anything else when he looks at the window, swallowing slowly and blinking a few times like this news is literally hard to consume.
So now it’s been two weeks since they came here and they are all sitting in the kitchen, trading stories and anecdotes for pizza slices. There is beer too and a bit of good old laughter. Even Steve seemed to be at ease. He has been relaxing more and more into that new standby-Cap mode with each passing day. And he
There are no interruptions to all these routines. The press is not pestering them much. The SI shareholders swallowed the bait about his need for recovery. No other superhero plans to show up. Bruce is running his tests on Tony’s blood samples, all sorts of scans, and even DNA analysis, but they don’t uncover much new knowledge, so they are still digging there. And Tony knows that Steve speaks with Pepper, but Steve never presses Tony to call her, or he doesn’t mention these calls unless Tony asks.
So these are Tony’s first thoughts when he finally wakes up and recognizes a long figure stretched on a hardly comfortable chair next to his bed. And he thinks he’s prepared. Not perfectly. Not for everything. But more or less — prepared.
“Sure, but she doesn’t need a partner who tries to learn how to love her in a way that’s sustainable for the purpose of  raising a kid together,” Tony explains, focusing on mixing his ice cream into a semi-melted puddle as he adds, “Plus, she’s still grieving the other guy and being with me would be practically like being with someone new, but Morgan is another story and once we’ll figure out how to break this to her, I’ll be the most present father she can get.”
—” Steve rushes to assure and stops to take a breath as he adds, “We did, sometimes. There wasn’t much time for it most of the time. So, now it’s all really—”
Bruce digs in the ice cream for a few seconds, clearly leading some kind of battle in his head. Tony doesn’t press. He might not know the guy for long, but he knows and feels enough to get that this conversation is already the longest one that Bruce might have with anyone on that subject. So, Tony waits and sees how Bruce’s jaw clenches when he clearly tries to hold on to words. How he’s lost for a moment and not even one of his degrees, nothing from what he experienced and learned, can help him to conquer all these emotions. Grief. Loss. Disappointment.
“I hear ya, buddy,” Tony agrees and moves a finger between them. “You and me? Kind of the same boat.”
But he still observes Steve carefully. His dark eyes consume the distant hue of the only lamp they left switched on. His hair is in complete disarray, adding to him even more of the boyish charm he always radiates. But contrary to that, his face is serious and worried. He waits.
Steve closes his eyes, dropping his head at the back of the couch. Burning tears are building behind his eyelids. He’s surprised that he’s still capable of crying, but here he is, swallowing down another wave of his sorrow and trying to feel something, anything, that would stir him back to life, back to being at least able to stand up. Yet he’s only able to close his fingers tighter on the helmet.
“That’s right,” Steve agrees. “You and me, we changed clothes when we traveled further back to the '70s, and we came back dressed in them.”
And Steve is only able to smile around him, working him slowly into oblivion as Tony rides waves of his bliss. He shakes palpably. Steve feels the vibration on his tongue as he sucks on sensitive and softening skin, finishing Tony just the way he likes. Just one more deep thrust. One more heavy and shaky breath torn from Tony’s throat as his hips slowly roll one last time.
“When they woke me up, I had nothing,” he starts quietly, not moving back. “And then it was basically you who got me a life, a family and a purpose.”
“That’s the one!” Tony points a finger, but Pepper only narrows her eyes warningly, so he mumbles, “She wasn’t even that good.”
“In my defense, I tried but you said that it needs to wait until everyone is gone,” Tony provides quickly.
But there is one change. The one that happened in Steve. He doesn’t want to fight. Not anymore. Not with Tony. And not with anyone else. Because he’s exhausted. And discouraged. Indifferent even.
There is another long moment of silence. Steve senses more than sees that Tony is thinking, weighting all the possibilities, outcomes and prospects of failures. It’s not because he’s measuring his profits. It’s because Tony also looks for the best way out with a minimum of hurt and disappointment. That’s why he’s prepared when Tony turns and glances up at Steve with intensity.
“Geez, honey, I’m sorry you had to wait for me again.” Tony presses a smile and wants to pat Steve but then he looks above him, seeing another figure coming out of the house. “Wow, he really
“Yeah, but you know—” Tony tries to form his thoughts as he reaches for Steve. He hooks his fingers around Steve’s waist, squeezing it gently when he whispers, “It was dramatically unrequited because I knew you were gone. I knew you lived in a different time. So, I had that poster up on my dorm’s room wall. The vintage one from one of your tours. And there were nights I imagined what it would be like to go back in time, find you and well, be with you?”
“Oh, come on, don’t be a sourpatch like Rhodey here.” Tony pats his friend on the shoulder, ignoring how the man just shrugs his hand disapprovingly. “You’ll get wrinkles like him.”
It’s not because Tony has a wife and a kid (because-they-are-not-his) or that he might not be staying here for long. It’s rather because Steve seems to be completely immune to Tony’s charms. And it also feels like Rogers radiates guilt. Could it be connected to the other Tony? Maybe Steve banged Pepper at some point? The thought is as hot as disturbing—
He's being tangled in a familiar web of action and reaction. The distraction, the sudden rush of adrenaline — it’s comfortable and easy. Surprisingly, it’s far easier than admitting that Pepper and Steve are both lost, and they don’t have the slightest clue what’s happening or how they should take it. Hell, even Fury is speechless.
“What’s up?” Tony throws, moving past Bruce to the fridge. “Did the Star Prince rambling about his intergalactic adventures wear you out?”
“I’m afraid JARVIS is unavailable,” speaks a woman’s voice. “It’s FRIDAY here, boss. And I’m happy to inform you that your workshop hasn’t moved from its downstairs location since your last visit.”
“Yeah, but—” Steve takes another shaky breath. “Promise me that you’ll try to stay calm and don’t panic. And just know that I’m sorry about telling this to you now but I didn’t want to unnecessarily upset you if you really were going back to the past. Because it might be different there. You know, in a different timeline.”
Steve doesn’t know why. But fuck, it feels like—Fuck. Steve doesn’t know how this feel, but it’s too damn good to let this go now. Because Tony groans at the back of his throat as he licks in, closing his fingers around Steve’s too-long strands. It’s all even more urgent and hungry. The kiss barely leaves them air to breathe. Their closeness makes them feel and look like one body, moving in sync with the water.
Tony just looks at her and waits, partially knowing what is going to happen. But when it happens, when she leans over quickly, he’s still surprised to feel her tender lips on his. The kiss is over swiftly though. She moves back with a smile that’s a bit mischievous but apologetic.
Tony looks at him annoyed. “Pepper sent me off to the airport. I remember we talked about your birthday before I left, yes? Maybe?”
They all treat Tony like he’s valued, needed and missed. And this is even stranger. He didn’t have that before. He didn’t have a family. At least not since his parents died. And maybe this is even more precious, because now he understands what the loss of them did to him and this makes him appreciate the current circumstances far more.
The light is low but this time it’s clear enough for the high-res cameras to reveal all that’s important. It’s taken at the very back of the house where on the lower level and hidden in the depths of the garden hangs the swimming pool just above the surface of the ocean. Its glass walls are lit by a subtle light to illuminate the water in an inlay of colors. Among them, it’s him and Steve. They are naked, unashamed, and tangled together. And that isn’t even the biggest surprise. It’s really not a revelation that Tony had it hard for this guy. He also isn’t shocked by the fact that it happened only after the events in Siberia. After all, he knows himself enough to know it must have been fucking thrilling to have Steve come to him like that. No. It’s not what makes Tony hold his breath. What really strikes him is the intimacy of this moment. It’s the way they look at each other. It’s how the kisses are desperate and hungry. How they clearly can’t hold on long enough without being close to each other. How they both look far gone in whatever this is. How Steve is relaxed and sure and so shamelessly open and willing in Tony’s arms.
And in that moment of total loss Mantis came to him. She simply covered his hand and for a few minutes, she stayed there with him. It was like she had been taking some part of all these feelings and replacing them with something new. It felt like love, but one that didn’t carry any bitter aftertaste. The feeling was free. It was somehow simple. And it must have been hers. Because who else could experience something so uncomplicated and pure?
“Yep, that I can do,” she confirms and breaks into a smile that seems to be the first one since what feels like forever.
Fuck. All this? All this is so screwed up. He’s screwed up. And suddenly the weight of all that has happened in the last few years hits him hard. Afghanistan. The realization that he was alone and lonely. The fact that no one had his back when he decided to shut down weapons manufacturing. Obadiah’s betrayal.
“So Stark is back, yes?” Thor chips in. “Can he help to clean up this disarray that’s going around?”
Maybe because of that, he doesn’t pay attention to the person that appears at his side until a question resounds, “Keeping up with appearances, Captain?”
A few hours after that, Steve learns that Tony really, fully meant what he said. They are back in bed, yes. But they are freshly showered. It’s a warm night after all. The windows are wide open and humid air bursts inside the room with the wind that carries breeze from the ocean. The soft curtains move rhythmically with each gentle blow, bringing in the sound of waves crashing against the shore. The space is filled with this soft hum and smell of an upcoming storm, but the air is still heavy with the expectation of something coming. It might come together with the dawn, but it also might not come at all.
He quickly looks around when he takes a few steps closer to her. There is a table opposite to Pepper, so he jumps on it to sit when he confirms after a bit, “Yep, everything. And I guess the question is how much do you know?”
Steve opens his lips like he wants to say something but then he stops and only shakes his head, stunned. He slowly turns and sits heavily on the bed, crushing in his hands one of the shirts.
Tony huffs a shuddered breath and lowers his head, trying to take this in. After all, he just got dumped. He also realized that this was on his mind all this time. This unclear responsibility had been hanging over his head since he heard about Morgan and Pepper. And while it’s still there, he still needs and wants to take care of them. At least now he clearly knows the borders he can operate within. He finally knows where he stands. He starts to feel like he’s becoming whole again where this version of himself slowly comes to terms with the previous one.
Until Steve realized what really laid under all those fights, the pushing and pulling at each other’s borders. Steve wanted Tony from the moment they met. He fucking yearned for a fraction of Tony’s attention. He wanted to be seen by Tony. As his equal, yes. But Steve also wanted to be his partner in the job they’d been chosen for. He wanted to be someone with whom Tony could carry this burden with.
And this? This right there is just unfair. The man looks beaten up. He clearly tries to make this good and right. How could he not? He’s the epitome of “making everything better” throughout history. He might even think that he’s here for Tony. Well, for this Tony. For the other one probably too, for some unknown reason. Or at least he tries. He also wants to support Pepper. That’s clear. And that’s the reason why he came here with her and has been present when Tony called.
Steve breathes out like he lets go of something incredibly heavy that he had been carrying on his back every day of his whole life and he hides his face in the crook of Tony’s neck again. He doesn’t shiver anymore. He just inhales and exhales softly, not letting Tony go. His breath calms down. He
“And this is the exact reason why I’m doing this.” Tony spreads his hands triumphantly. “I’m giving you a breather.”
“God, I’m so stupid,” Steve says instead, not listening. “I thought that I could do this. I thought that I was smart enough not to drag you into my past mistakes and—”
“You know what,” Steve breathes out heavily but Tony only frowns with confusion, so he adds, “Us. Like this.”
“But do you know everything?” Steve’s question is so quiet it borders on silence when he adds, “Do you know who—”
Christine narrows her eyes and smiles doubtfully. “You look surprisingly good, Tony. What’s your secret?”
He feels anger boils under his skin and of course he’s going to act on it. That’s his setup. When emotions fly high, he does something stupid. He’s Tony Stark after all.
It mostly has nothing to do with his company but the fact that Steve is uptight and almost non-communicative doesn’t help much. Tony gets that the guy tries his best to adapt to the given situation. He also gets that Rogers probably takes on himself far too much. That’s clear by the way he gets more and more upset as he ingests the chaos they drive through on the way to Malibu.
Steve registers that the lines monitoring Tony’s vitals suddenly go up when after a long moment of silence, Tony only says, “Wow.”
Tony’s damp hair still sticks to his forehead. His eyes are marked by tiny webs of wrinkles as he smiles. Happy and confident, he’s drawing small circles with his thumb on Steve’s skin.
Steve doesn’t stop observing what is happening in the room while he ponders on his answer. Tony’s vitals slowly go back to normal as the medication takes its hold and Tony suddenly looks calm and strikingly young, starting to dream his drug induced dreams.
“We should put something in the calendar,” Tony proposes. “Mine is mostly free anyway. Hers might be a bit tight, though.”
“—then Peter said that he’s going to build me a swing from his web, but I can’t do it myself because I’m too
“Do you think I’d make a pass on you while still being with Pepper?” Tony questions and looks to the side shortly, before turning back to Steve. “We’re divorcing. Pepper and I. We signed the papers today.”
“I feel like we have a lot of explaining to do,” Tony acknowledges, and he pokes a finger between the women. “Especially you two.”
This is the reason Steve tries to focus on the task at hand. His plan of reuniting Tony and his family isn’t going exactly as smoothly as he’d like, but progress has been made. Tony’s back on his feet. Mostly. They are still both at Malibu mansion, but Tony speaks with Pepper constantly. From what Steve knows, these conversations are on how to help overcome the overall disarray, but it’s a good start for finding their connection again. It started that way the first time around, right?
Tony’s hands untangle slowly from Steve’s hair. The man’s lingering touch moves tenderly to his face. Tony captures his jaw. His fingertips draw lines on Steve’s skin as he props Steve’s chin up with both of his thumbs and bites into Steve’s exposed lips again, while he lets his hands travel down along Steve’s sides and finally settle on his hips. Tony digs his fingers into his muscles and brings Steve in, pulling their ready bodies close. And that’s when Steve instantly wakes up from the spell of the moment. And he realizes how much he’s fucked this up.
Still, having Rhodey around helped Tony to finally feel somehow better. Not fully. No. But the direction seems to be right. Because even if his friend clearly went through hell staying at the other Tony’s side, it seems that he survived and he’s happy to see him. They hugged for at least damn three minutes after they saw each other when the Quinjet landed. And hugging isn’t really Rhodey’s thing. So yeah, Rhodey is Rhodey. And he deals with Tony like he would in any other situation. Even the stare of silent judgment is still there. And it’s great.
This is so new to Steve. He realizes only now that he doesn’t recall ever seeing this look on Tony. For sure not recently, but also, not even when he saw Tony at the Eco Compound after five empty and lonely years of resentment.
One might ask - why? It’s simple. Really. He can have exactly everything money can buy. His company hits the roof on the stock market. He has the cars, the boats, and the planes. He can travel around the world whenever and however he wants. And he can do whomever he wants in whatever way possible. Although most of the time he’s careful in fulfilling these kinds of wishes because they tend to backfire more times than not. But overall, there is barely anyone who can say “no” to him or there is barely anything he can’t get sooner or later (mostly sooner), so there is not much of an effort left in his life. And above all, Tony loves a good old challenge. So, his life? Boring.
“Yeah, I hoped it’d happen sometime later today,” Tony murmurs grimly. “But I’m not so sure anymore.”
“So, what’s up with Rhodey?” he asks just to steer his thoughts toward the real subject of this conversation. “From my search yesterday, I know he’s alive.”
“No,” Steve rushes with an answer and on impulse turns her to hold her arms, squeezing them gently as he says, “Pepper, you have a right to think and feel whatever you want. And above all, you want to protect Morgan.”
But he still wants it. Not to have everything, of course. But to just have this. These bits and pieces. Those nights of talks and good food. Before Tony goes back to his life.
Tony clicks on the first one and can’t hold a gasp. There might have been another reason for the lack of light entirely, because even though he suspected it, even though he counts on it, and
"He is getting annoying." Bruce tells him. "He thinks I told you about him and has been giving the cold shoulder as if I care."
"I'll be up in a few minutes." Tony told him yawning. "JARVIS remind me to call Wayne one of these days."
"I think that is a good idea, we could tell everyone else that our husbands to be wanted a smaller wedding and we couldn't refuse them." Bruce said and Pepper and Alfred were writing it all down.
"I doubt it; well kind of it's for our partnership Brucie wants me to check over the blue prints myself so I don't complain later." Tony said. Steve stops and looks at Tony.
"You know I saw other this design since you are having different tables, we could choose blue and red for Steve and Tony, blue and black for Bruce and Clark." Pepper told them.
"I love you too." Bruce whispered so low that Clark was really happy he was Superman or he would not have heard.
Clark was hoping this would end soon. He didn't want to be here to receive or talk to Mr. Stark at all. Especially since he didn't want anything to do with the man that was trying to take Bruce away and the man that knew his secret identity.
"Naw, I'll leave that to Coulson." Tony said. after four months of the New York incident they had found out that Agent Coulson wasn't dead, he did died but he was still alive and kicking and the liaison from the Avengers to SHIELD. When they finished breakfast Tony was going to go back to his lab but Steve directed him all the way to his bedroom.
"Oh." Lois says. Clark was standing there looking at Stark wondering if he was saying a lie. Tony passed next to him but didn't even pay attention or showed any fact that he knew who he was. It might mean that Bruce was telling him the truth.
"You won't be stopping him if you fall asleep on the job." Clark told him. "Just rest for a few hours than you can come back okay, I could help you…" Bruce glared. "If you want my help I'm not telling you, you needed it." Clark knew that sometimes he needed to be careful when he offered his help to Bruce even if they were dating.
"I am." Tony told him even when the answer became invalid once he got up and winced from his ribs he knew would probably need to be tapped.
"No, to me Bruce has always being Bruce, he has always been a bit broody, and now Clark is a different story." Tony told him.
"Well the party is going to be there and I don't really want to be in the center of Gotham not a good thing and Bruce's huge home was and is a nice place to be I was there a few times in my life." Tony told him.
Tony was driving toward Lex Corp mostly because he wanted this to be finished as soon as possible and he could get back to Avenger's Tower with Steve and the team.
It took minutes but the police were interrogating everyone, even Haley who was telling them, that he had no idea how this could have happened. Bruce was to wait, and he noticed that no one had noticed the boy yet. He looked around and he looked at the ladder and he began to climb.
"I told you, that once you and Clark met you would be Boy Scout BFF's." Tony tells Steve as he hands him a cup of coffee.
"I just can't find the right time." Steve tells him. "I was going to give it to him, on the anniversary of the battle of New York but I chickened out."
“No go, before I change my mind and you don’t end up going anywhere.” Bruce says with a smile. Clark walks away and flies away. Bruce see’s as his husband leave to a mission and he worries knowing that he won’t have his back.
"Master Tony is good to have you in Gotham, Master Bruce sent me to pick you and Master Rogers up." Alfred told him.
Superman was actually having trouble; he was going to get to the victims that were stuck until someone helped him. He saw that it was none other than Iron Man. He wasn't exactly happy, but he really couldn't complain as the man was helping him take down the people from burning alive. They both were able to work and finish early. When they ended they both stayed in the air.
It takes another year before Bruce and the team of other superheroes takes on Starro from taking down the world and Tony still can't believe it. He calls Bruce afterwards after he hears the name the Flash gives them.
“Well, I like the outfit you are wearing.” Steve said regarding the green dress that she was currently wearing.
"Bats, what did you do?" Flash asked. Batman just stayed quiet and continued to type. "You know I have never seen Superman so angry before." Flash tried to bug Batman but after two minutes Batman turned around and saw him with a glare. Flash just stopped and raised his hands.
“No—I mean, yes,” the man pauses and takes a good breath before he follows Tony to say, “But it’s just insane to see you do this.”
Steve groans out loud but collects himself quickly to ask, “FRIDAY, can you please show us if there are any mentions of Iron Man in the news feeds in recent hours?”
Steve automatically shoots a look back at Pepper. He can see she is still considering her options. She seems to be wary and unconvinced, but then again, she has far more to lose in case she makes a wrong move. Still, there is only one way out of all this, and Steve knows that this move must lead south.
And that finally makes Bruce lose his temper for a bit. Well, not like to lose it to the point of giving his other side a full on go, but he still puts the ice cream box down and sticks his spoon into it with a bit too much force.
Tony laughs out loud, but he falls quickly silent when Steve rolls his pants down and follows the fabric with more kisses. One on the hipbone. One lower. One more at the joint of Tony’s leg.  He traces a well-known pattern of freckles with his lips back to Tony’s navel and presses his face again into the hard muscles of the lower abdominals, taking another deep breath.
Morgan starts to laugh and Tony joins in. Steve looks at Nat with a broad smile, radiating with happiness. She shakes her head but returns the gesture. And even Wanda’s lips twitch a bit although Tony can see that her eyes stay a little bit sad and too composed.
There is a whole spread on a table because of course Tony doesn’t know limits. Steve has in front of him a full range of fruits and baked goods, at least three kinds of freshly squeezed juices and something that looks like homemade granola. Also, one of the suits, Mark IV as it reads on its arm, puts in front of Steve a plate filled with fried eggs.
It speaks volumes for the state Steve’s in right now. He wants to comment on that, but suddenly he’s not only feeling a warmth resonating from Pepper’s hand, but also a strange vibration coming from the helmet where he still has his hand pressed to the metal. He feels the buzz on his skin. It’s far stronger this time, sending a tingling sensation up his arm.
The kid. He forgot about the kid. What is he going to do with that? With everything else, he might even manage. But the kid for sure doesn’t deserve him. Not like that. Not like this.
To his surprise, Christine laughs. “If I knew you had such a sharp wit, I’d have had you on my show years ago.”
Nonetheless, it doesn’t mean that the transition is easy. For Morgan and for them equally. For her because even though they tried to explain to her what happened in the easiest way possible, she’ll probably be grasping more and more of this whole situation through the years. And there are moments when it looks like she knows Tony is not fully the dad she knew. Of course, she sees the visual differences, but she also catches some others on a more intuitive level and so she’s still careful with expressing her emotions. So even after a calming period when Tony and Steve learned what it meant to be together, and after one and half months of having Morgan for sleepovers, sometimes he still has sudden bursts of panic. They are fewer and weaker, but he still worries and has too many thoughts in his head and too many emotions to contain in his body.
“First, we’ll focus on finding out how you got here and why. Also, you’re going to rebuild the rest of your suits,” Steve says decisively before Tony can react, “And I’m going to tell you my side of everything that happened so you can have something beyond FRIDAY’s facts.”
Still, this helped him only a little. For a few days after that, he could invoke some memory or rather a shadow of that feeling. But as days passed, he again found himself more and more tired and disappointed with himself. He was exhausted from this fight and yet he couldn't bring himself to end it. He couldn't leave Tony. He couldn't say no to him. Especially because on every such occasion Tony managed to magically appear at his side with a ready escape plan for the both of them. That’s how they’ d been ending up in some food hole or by a food truck, grabbing something to eat, walking or staying at the beach, and talking into the deep hours of the night.
“Steve, you need to hear this,” Tony starts, stroking Steve's heated cheeks. “It’s on me. Not you. I’m the one who fell in love with you, okay? Me. I went there and without your permission completely, utterly and fully fell for you. And nothing is going to change this. Whether you feel the same or not. And whether you’ll run away or not. Although I’d really like for you to stay.”
“Yeah, it is,” Steve says, surly, but he feels the annoyance building at the back of his head when he adds, “Even now we have to give the world at least some coordinates on how to operate in this new reality that we yet again caused.”
“How to add speed power to Peter’s suit so the kid won’t fall in case his web shooter fails?” Steve recalls their previous conversation they had like an hour ago.
“It’s unfair,” the girl protests, dodging another kiss. “I want to have my own suit too! A blue one, like mommy!”
He decided to call all of them at once because otherwise he would have to take all the silent judgment one by one. In this way, they can bust his chops all at once and he can be done with it. Still, he holds his breath when Rhodey glances back.
Little visualisation for the epilogue to thank you all for your wonderful comments and all the kudos! (I promise I'll reply to all of them! They are my fuel and my light in the dark tunel. No kidding!<3)
And she does rewind the recording very slowly. They all focus on each frame. And at first, nothing really happens. For a little while, Tony’s just there, fighting for his life. Tony thinks that maybe he made a mistake. Maybe there wasn’t anything unusual. Maybe he really time traveled. It’s the simplest solution, right? But then he’s never for the simplest things because he suddenly spots it. On the forward-moving recording, his body looks like it’s decomposing. Not rotting. No. That would be horrifying. It dismantles itself on an atomic level. First slowly and only in some parts. Very small units break out from his body and drift off into the air. But then the whole space around him is filled up with more and more particles of many shapes and sizes. And it’s not the most surprising part. The biggest bomb of the whole spectacle is the fact that this composition is not the dust that Tony already saw in the various footage from the press. It’s completely different. It looks like it shines in the sun. It seems to be composed of many bright colors and dimensions. It’s dancing and rotating, constantly changing and arranging itself while creating this strange almost galaxy hue in the light that looks like a full-blown halo. And it’s—
Tony holds his chest, bending on the bed in an abrupt convulsion when another monitor starts to emanate an alarming sound. Out of nowhere, there is a nurse in the room. Steve and Pepper are being pushed back and then outside when more people fill the space to work in a surreal, controlled chaos as Tony is being held down and sedated.
“And it helped,” Tony answers immediately, glancing back at Steve. “I took one good look at the schematics, and it felt like a memory. So, I thought, hey, maybe if I fly, I’ll remember something else?”
“You don’t have to be so modest, Captain.” She comes closer to him and the bar, leaning over to speak in a conspiratorial voice, “I know that when Stark decides to keep someone so close, the person must be entrancing enough to keep his attention.”
He stands up and Tony carefully observes how six feet and two inches of muscles and grace look in motion. Suddenly the crumpled suit really doesn’t matter. And Tony might even start to get an idea about how exactly that friendship functioned. Maybe? At some point? Because come on? Who wouldn’t want to tap Captain America? He totally would. Just like now, he gets sidetracked. He was supposed to be angry.
“On my way here, I had a little bit of time to think about this crazy situation,” Steve finally admits quietly. “And I promised myself that I’m going to be honest with you about everything and anything you ask.”
So yeah, overall, there is no muss, no fuss there. But raising a child full-time is completely different from having Morgan only for one or two days. Especially when the said child has Pepper’s wit and his charm and can run 1.6 mach per minute like she accidentally also got the super-soldier serum. Also, she can play Steve like Paganini played violin so maybe she also got something from her aunt Nat. Who knows? Everything is possible, right?
And they all join him in a silent toast. This is the first one they ever make but Tony feels like it’s the right moment. They all celebrate something. It’s not clear exactly what but this evening is just simply good and easy. Even Tony can’t remember when was the last time he felt so— So what? Calm? Content? Safe?
Tony also can easily assume that the guy has flaws. Because who doesn’t? For example, the way he sleeps completely knocked down and borderline unconscious like he hasn’t slept for ages? But isn’t he supposed to be a super-soldier who is always ready for action? You know, the type who sees everything, hears even more? And at the top of that, he doesn’t have a sense of fashion whatsoever. Or self-presentation. He still wears the same white wrinkled shirt and black slacks from yesterday. All super plain and super boring. And he’s stubborn as hell. That much Tony could see yesterday when Captain bulldozed him with questions.
“I’m sorry you had to learn this way,” he says and finally meets Tony’s gaze. His eyes are so honest it’s almost painful to watch as he adds, “This should be the first thing coming out of my mouth after you wake up in the hospital.”
means he trusted you with something that’s far more important than his life. And we’ll involve Bruce.”
Suddenly, his short talk with Mantis comes back to him. When the Guardians came to visit three weeks ago, he found himself in a very similar setting. He went outside to the balcony to just shake off another wave of tiredness. Tony was in the kitchen with Bruce. The rest were celebrating the fact that finally, something really good had been shaping up for them. They were all slowly gaining back at least some part of hope. But he didn’t. He was worried about what was going to happen in a few weeks when everything is going to be settled, and he’d have to leave Malibu and Tony behind again.
“There is everything to explain,” Tony says impatiently and seeing that Steve at least stops, he adds, “I did try to talk about the divorce on the day the Guardians came by but then I talked with Bruce and—”
“Did you try to convince me in the same way before?” Tony asks calmly. “Or did you just sneak out without a word?”
Sure, maybe under the right circumstances and through certain connections and omissions (that surely occurred in this other Tony's life), they could grow into other feelings. After all, Tony’s always thought that marrying a friend is the best that can happen to him. But he and this Pepper? They didn’t go under these specific circumstances. They didn’t grow into this together. And the chances are they never will because even if he truly is from the past and even if someone would magically know exactly into which point, universe and timeline he should go back, he’d still have memories of this event, and nothing is going to be the same.
Tony’s lip corners twitch as he tries not to smile when he says, “Scary, but fair. And I bet you already have a plan?”
far away place. But it doesn’t mean he’s done with his creative work. Especially if he can plot and plan with Morgan tacked to his side and Steve on the other end of bed reading a paper just like this morning—
“Why didn’t he tried to have more? Why the hell he—” Tony’s voice breaks as he speaks louder so he presses through lips, “Why he didn’t fight for more?”
“But why can't Captain Rogers know?” Mantis still presses on the other side. “It’s a beautiful feeling. I liked it so I’m sure he will too.”
“If you don’t remember me and you still think Pepper is your assistant, what is the last thing you recall?”
“It’s good that we have the rest of our lives to make up for it,” Tony whispers between one slow kiss and another.
Steve huffs a laugh, nodding as he considers Tony’s words. “If that’s what it takes to keep you here, then yes.”
“Wow,” Natasha huffs at the other end of the driveway. “I’ve been gone for a few minutes, and you decided to finally grow a pair?”
“Yeah, but for what reason?” Tony snorts. “What is she going to tell her future therapist? That her father came back from the dead after saving the whole universe and her mother didn’t fancy him anymore?”
“Did I?” Steve laughs frantically and looking back at the vast spread of the ocean behind the office walls that doesn’t look very different from the day he took on the most important decision of his life. He starts gently, “It’s really not that different, Tony. I might not have had much back then, not like you anyway, but I had a strong idea what I was going to do when the war ended, a date planned and a promise of a life. And yes, I decided to sacrifice all that, but I didn’t have any control over the fact that someone is going to wake me up sixty-six years later in an outlandish world where all my friends are long gone.”
And Maria, as tactical as always, gets it and walks back to her boss. She probably even understands that he’d do this even if he didn’t want to. But he does want to. He wants to see
He manages to steal one more kiss before Steve gathers enough strength and finally fully shifts back.
“I don’t want to hold you a prisoner to my unfulfilled expectations,” Pepper says calmly and squeezes his finger one more time to finally let them free. She moves back, leaning against the table opposite when she adds, “I’ll always have feelings for you, but they are also not the same. It feels like I also went back in time and had this tiny crush on you. But it’s nothing more. Just that. And I don’t know how to explain this, but somewhere at the back of my mind I know you are you while at the same time you’re not the person I love and lost just days ago. It’s like some kind of—”
Steve shakes his head in lieu of an answer and straightens up fully to whisper, “I’m supposed to take care of you, not the other way around.”
Bruce only exhales heavily and focuses on digging into his box again. There is a long stretch of silence where they can only hear another burst of laughter coming from the living space. It’s Peter. He jumps around and shows some tricks with the spider web that suddenly bursts from his wrists and sticks high up the glass part of the ceiling. This allows him to pull himself up and instantly hang upside down, still not stopping to explain something to Steve who is completely taken by it.
So yeah, Tony’s screwed. He probably got time-traveled to another timeline. He’s married to Pepper Potts. He has a kid. And he’s apparently really into his other self's friend who also happens to be a fucking walking American icon. It must be Monday!
He takes another shuddered breath, discovering that he doesn't even feel embarrassed. At least not in front of Pepper. Maybe if it had been anyone else, he wouldn’t let himself be swept away by his sorrow.
“Ok, alright, spill,” he says, waving at Steve to rush him. “By this point, I doubt anything can shock me.”
“At least they didn’t expect you to be an understudy of your better self,” Tony says and smiles bitterly.
He turns to the shore, cuts through the waves and once he’s on dry land he quickly puts back his clothes on as fast as he can with his wet body.
“Wow, t—that—that’s actually surprisingly mature,” Bruce says. “You’re sure you’re not the other Tony after all?”
“It’s not your fault,” Tony says firmly and slowly, convinced of what he needs to do. “You did nothing wrong. Do you understand me?”
Bruce snorts, putting a spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. “The guy’s great but if I hear one more time how he killed his Celestial father, I’ll smash him.”
Pepper reaches for his hand and squeezes it lightly as she affirms, “Don’t worry about that now, we need you here too.”
“Dammit, Tony, everyone thinks that Iron Man is dead.” Steve stands abruptly and barely can hold his frustration when he adds, “For God’s sake, yesterday I thought that you were dead.”
“More than he thinks,” Natasha answers first and adds quickly, “But seriously, it’s really good to see the both of you and being finally together.”
“No,” Tony cuts in. “No, I discovered it by accident. That night you told me about my parents and Bucky.”
Steve looks quickly over his shoulder, also spotting Thor. He rolls his eyes and locks his disapproving gaze on Tony.
“Possible, yes,” Bruce confirms. “But why? And, what’s more important, how? Why doesn’t he remember doing it?”
He touches the housing unit on his chest and his suit obediently folds itself back inside, leaving him to the morning chill of the west coast that even his thermal T-shirt can’t hold off. Still, Pepper doesn’t let him wait for too long. She comes from around the corner, wrapped in a light cashmere sweater. Her hair is a bit of a mess, and while she doesn’t look as well-rested and collected as she usually does, she still looks great.
Fucking Obadiah, Tony thinks, sitting on the ground. The helmet hits the trunk with an impact as he tries to calm his breath, but he still feels a weight on his lungs. He might only know all this stuff from the tales of others, but he feels it somehow now. He feels all of it. And it-
And as he thinks about who might code the footage and what the hell had been really happening in this house, FRIDAY pulls on the screen a view from the front door camera. It really doesn’t show much. Tony sees that an old-looking car approaches the house and stops very close to a man standing outside on the driveway. It’s him. He’s dressed casually in his favorite leather jacket and some jeans. And there is a suit standing next to him in a sentinel mode or maybe he just lights the way for the car because there is no trace of any other light anywhere near them. And when the car stops even that is put down as the suit lowers its arm. The camera switches to a nocturnal mode. The recording is in a hue of green and black. Tony guesses that it must have been done on purpose to obscure the incomer’s identity in case someone’s been watching, but for Tony, this is enough to know it’s Steve. Even though he hides his face in the hood of his jacket, he can’t hide the way he moves. Tony invites him in, and they disappear behind massive doors.
“I do adore her,” Steve says with the flagship determination of Captain America. “That’s why I put her first.”
And it suddenly hits Tony. The Battle of Earth (stupid name, but okay) had been like two weeks ago. He suspects that before the group already worked their asses off to pull off whatever they pulled. It must have been stressful as hell not to mention that it seems like straight after it, they had to fight for their lives and well, the lives of everyone on this planet. People died. Close people. Beloved even. Surely not only Tony’s alternative version. So, after the battle, the guys had probably close to zero rest and a mountain of grief and sorrow packed in a really nice package of exhaustion. It must have been so extensive that it influenced even a super-soldier. And here is Tony, moaning about the fact that someone redecorated his house. That he redecorated his own house. And he suddenly feels a pang of guilt and something else, something like— Is this remorse? Fuck. That’s a strange feeling.
And so, Tony does. He stretches up and leaves his first kiss on Steve’s forehead. The man can’t hold back a little gasp of surprise as Tony’s warm lips move, leaving small pecks on Steve’s temples and cheeks. Soft kisses land on Steve’s nose. His jaw. His ears. And everywhere else Tony can reach.
“You probably also know by now that I don’t really play well with others,” Tony says this more to warn Steve before continuing the argument.
Deep inside, Tony’s intimidated by all the attention. Then again, all these people came here for him. They didn’t come because they wanted or needed something
And Steve drags this body off the couch. There is this soft smile again as he aims for the stairs but stops at the first one and reaches for his back pocket.
He looks up at Pepper and smiling this time with more ease, he asks, “Did you at least make me work for it when I wanted to get back together?”
I am really, extremely and utterly sorry for this delay but my work just erased me from the Earth's surface for a few days. And I am really sorry that I still haven't write back to your comments! Just know they keep me alive and going in this strange time and I really am grateful for them, all the kudos and all the time you give to read this story.
Tony grinds his teeth, feeling irritation grow at the back of his skull, where a headache is developing, but he says a strained, “Fine.”
Steve nods slowly, locking his eyes with Tony’s and suddenly he makes a weird face. His eyes go soft. There is a subtle smile that plays on his lips as he ducks his head but still holds his gaze, lingering on Tony’s features. And there is some kind of fondness there. It lasts just a moment but it’s enough for Tony to register. It does something strange to his insides.
Pepper confirms with another nod and then winces. “There is the house in Malibu, but it’d mean he’s going to be practically alone on the other side of the country, because I can’t be in both places and basically raise two kids. Or one, if I think of it, because Morgan’s far more manageable.”
,” Tony says under his breath and adds louder. “If it’s about the fact that my parents were killed by Hydra, then I know.”
there is something, okay?), and really, he’s fed up with all the understatements and tiptoeing around facts and events that clearly happened only because Steve stubbornly thinks he needs to fix something in Tony’s life that he screwed up. He really didn’t. And Tony really needs to say all that aloud. Now. But apparently the universe thinks differently because when Tony comes close to his landing spot, he discovers that there is clearly something wrong. For one, there is a big-ass-spaceship casually parked in the garden surrounding his house. And on top of that, Steve is rushing outside, probably warned by FRIDAY, to greet him. His face says it all. Shit.
Probability is really a very strange thing; he thinks and huffs a soft laugh as he moves his hands up Steve’s back and tangles his fingers into long strands of Steve’s hair. He gently nudges the man. Steve looks confused as he lifts his head up, searching Tony’s eyes.
“But you can’t have that with me!” Steve suddenly raises his voice. Panicked and choking on the words, he adds quietly, “You can’t, Tony. You really can’t.”
“Aldrich Killian razed it to the ground with a few bombs,” Steve explains matter-of-factly as they walk to the door.
he’s rambling. His thoughts are rushing as he carefully steps through the woods. To his surprise it’s nothing like he expected. The Eco Compound is not only eco in name, clearly. It’s embedded into the scenery like it would grow from within all the grass and leaves.
It’s a nice house. It really is. It just looks completely different than the one he remembers leaving like only two days ago. This one is still draped over the cliff in layers, using the slope of it as a natural fortification, but also taking advantage of the view. It's all-over square construction with massive walls of glass while its whole east side that faces the road is pure gray concrete. The combination shines and shimmers in the setting sun, reflecting always moving waters. And it looks spectacular, serene even, but it still isn’t his home.
Rhodey laughs out loud and salutes him before he disappears. Thor winks and switches off his comms as Bruce follows. The last one is Clint who almost inaudibly says “Thank you,” and waves him off to finally leave Steve alone with his thoughts.
And just like that, he closes the distance between them. He pulls Steve in and crushes their lips together. The kiss is rapid. It’s desperate. Tony’s fingers are clenched in Steve’s hair to hold him close and deepen the kiss. And Steve realizes that his hands are full of Tony too. He slips his arms around the other man, drawing him in. Steve’s palms press into Tony’s back hard. His fingers dig into muscles. And Steve kisses Tony back with the full force of his feelings.
Yes, they have a lot to talk about. They might still have tons to learn too. About them. About their history. About their future. Even about their universe. But for now, they need to enjoy this moment. They need to celebrate. They need to
There is one, no, two… Then three heartbeats. Steve’s heart pounds in his ribcage, before he panics. He can’t see Tony anymore. He’s not resurfacing. There isn’t even an inch of his lighter skin visible in the waves. And Steve’s heightened senses should pick something up. They should.
“Good, it was meant to be heard,” Rhodey says flatly. “What is it with you wanting to get people drunk?”
There are times when he still thinks that maybe he’s going to fail. And on nights like this he goes down to the workshop and just does what he can do best— he creates things to make Morgan’s world safer and better. Granted, he’s never going to be on active Avenger duty. He and Steve made a promise that in order for all this to work, they need to step down, find replacements and simply support from a very,
He looks at Bruce and sees that the man slowly gets it, but it’s Steve who says carefully, “Tony, what are you saying?”
because his best friend flies a suit that’s basically a war machine not only because of its name, the most intelligent and adorable person after Tony is a green rage monster, and he definitely has serious hots for one super-soldier who had been friends with his father when the old man was in his twenties. So yeah, new-normal, but still a stable one.
They cross the break line where the water is rough. Now they’re floating a little bit farther from the shore but in a streak of a calm and slightly warmer current. The soft waves take them back and forth in a steady rhythm. With each gentle move, they come a little bit closer to each other. Their faces are illuminated by lights coming from the pier. Bright pink, blue, and green oscillate on their skin and dance on the surface like it would feel the rhythm of the music that carries from the same direction. Steve faintly knows the song. It’s some indie-pop hit that FRIDAY sometimes mixes in for him to keep him on track with the trends. But now it seems that the song mocks him with its lyrics that match his thoughts so damn well. Still, even this isn’t enough to stop Steve from taking his time to look at Tony. The man is so close he can even see the golden burst of color in his huge, black irises. Tony’s hair is stuck to his forehead and temples. It drips along his cheeks and onto his lips. Droplets slowly go down his face, stopping at his jaw to then run along the lines of his neck. And Tony keeps on smiling.
Pepper finally gets a hold on the cell and throws it to Steve. He enters the room with the move and that earns him Tony’s full attention.
“Huh,” Tony only huffs and narrows his eyes to observe Steve carefully. “So, I’m the result of an accident. That’s great. Really.”
“Don’t tell me you don’t see that his current life mission is to get you back with your family,” Bruce says but then he stops and drops his gaze on the ice cream. “Besides you were always close.”
All of sudden, he feels a sharp pain in his chest. He chokes on his breath, trying to take it. But it’s impossible. It’s like something had been pressing on his chest. He struggles and falls from his stool, not able to find the ground. And that’s the last thing he remembers.
And even if Clint doesn’t say a word to this either, Steve can see that there are tears in his eyes and a hint of a grateful smile when he grunts quietly to cover it, “And what’s the strategy for Tony to fold in line, Cap?”
Pepper almost convinces him that she takes offence when she blinks a few times and says with a straight face, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I’m saying this because I want to give you the same,” Steve says gently, hovering above the other man and whispering, “Regardless of you staying or going back.”
“Can you please tell me how long it was and who was here with him? Also, show me every video recording of him being in this house. And check media coverage of the area that mentions Captain Rogers around the same time.”
So yeah, this might be Tony, for all he knows, but what kind of Tony is he? Steve asks himself repeatedly while at the same time trying to pull all the facts and bits and pieces into a workable theory. And he falls short. He misses another person who would know what to do in this situation. He misses Natasha.
“Come on,” he says softly, not trusting his voice. “This can’t be worse than anything we’ve been through before.”
“But that's just it,” Tony explains softly. “I’m never going to be him. Whatever brought me here, whatever it was, time travel, cosmic magic or Infinity Stones, I’m never going to be the same person that you married, and I don’t know what to do with it.”
“Yet here I am,” Tony snorts a laugh. “And clearly I’m not the only one who was brought back from the dead.”
After that, there is blackness. And maybe he feels a kind touch. Maybe there are big, warm arms around him. Maybe someone says his name, urgent and alarmed, but it all seems like it’s happening to someone else. Because he’s deep in a constant, vast nothingness where he can’t breathe and can’t see. And he’s frightened. Petrified. Completely, utterly panicked. Until that’s abruptly cut too.
“I definitely need to see this one,” Bruce says laughing while Rhodey only murmurs to him, “Traitor.”
Steve peeks over his shoulder and he’s about to leave the pancakes and run for rescue, but Tony interrupts him. He smoothly steps into Steve’s space and wraps his arm around Steve’s waist. Propping his chin on the man’s arm, he kisses Steve on the cheek
Tony hoists himself onto the bed, looking from behind Pepper. He scrutinizes Steve very carefully. His dark, intense eyes roam over Steve’s body, all intent and openly fascinated.
He jumps a few steps at once, getting on the next floor, feeling the panic gathering inside him when he opens the door and sees that Steve is really packing.
Tony looks at him sharply. “Killian? The one from AIM? What did I do to this guy? I mean, apart from making fun of him like in the last century?”
“No, not even for a second,” Steve says fast. “Besides, now I understand that the problem didn’t lie in our lives going wrong but in the fact that we didn’t have one in the first place. I wasn’t the only one who couldn’t stop, Tony.”
Yes, he looks younger. And yes, his hair is free from the silver shine at his temples and in the neatly groomed beard. His body is well defined and strong. His eyes shine with something that Steve had never seen on Tony before on such a level. It’s some kind of carefreeness and unconcerned nonchalance. His smile is easy and approachable. He still holds himself with pride but also without the weight of all the years he doesn’t remember. But this is
“The fridge was empty!” Tony says in lieu of explanation and cracks a sudden smile, “And no one has seen me.”
The words resound in the space of a living room that doesn’t belong to Steve. It’s a foreign space and yet somehow familiar because everything around this house has a touch of Tony’s presence. So, Steve breathes in, and he still can feel him. His scent. His vibrations even. Especially when Tony in the recording stands up and comes closer. Smiling again, he winks at Steve like nothing has happened. He’s the same devil-may-care man he was when they first met. The same person who later surprised Steve by sacrificing himself for everyone and everything without a single question or a doubt over and over again. But more importantly he is a being that’s breathing and alive. Just for a moment. For another second. For a…
Tony smiles and takes a moment to think before he says, “Me? I’m not Iron Man. Not this version of me. And frankly, I don’t want to be him if it means I can’t give you a normal life.”
“Huh,” Tony murmurs and arching an eyebrow at Steve, he wants to counter, but he suddenly stops at another intriguing thought. “Hey, when I called you, I could see you and Pepper and almost the whole house on one screen.”
“Hah, you and me pal,” Bruce snorts. “I bet that the inside of that cellar cost more than the Quinjet.”
He feels a lump forming in his throat when Tony’s hand starts to move. Only the other man’s fingertips trace the shape of Steve’s muscles now. His fingers softly glide on the wet skin to outline first the line of Steve’s shoulder, then up his neck to frame his jaw gently.
“Why would you run out of—” Tony starts again but seeing Bruce’s serious face, he collects himself. “It’s not going to work between us. I’m not the same. I’ll never be the same.”
“But that’s my point,” Steve insists. “You can draw it. You can move to the East Coast and just live a happy life with your daughter and wife. You don’t have to sacrifice yourself anymore, because your nightmares are gone. Hell, this version of you never had them. And this is what the other you wanted.”
And that suddenly strikes Steve like lightning. All the words he prepared for a contra attack die down on his lips when he looks at Tony and smiles sadly with a huff.
And he kisses Steve quickly, falling back again. He stays close though. Steve rests his palm on Tony’s chest. He presses his fingers to the exact spot where Tony wears the nano parts holder. Tony covers it with his own hand, tangling their fingers together as he looks back at Steve and clearly tries to read something from his face.
“An incoming call,” she whispers almost at the same time as FRIDAY announces, “There is a visual connection coming from UCLA Medical Center. Should I answer it, boss?”
“What?” Tony shrugs. “Objectively speaking. And you’re still better looking,” he manages to add before suddenly he’s swept off his feet.
The flight is short. Period. It annoys him that he can’t fully experience the beauty of the nanotech suit that he had been preparing and assembling for the past two days, but he didn’t fly to play this time. And still, he gets the grasp of all the non-combat functionalities to the point he can set down with grace near the location FRIDAY marked for him. The rest will have to wait. Now he must have the talk. It might be one of the most important ones in his life. Well, this life—
That’s why he only holds his hands up and retracks from the kitchen. Turning, he still catches the soft curse that escapes Tony’s lips. The man takes off the receptors from his temples and throws them on a countertop. The suits switch off with a gentle whizz just when Steve leaves the room.
It might have also been practical, because after Steve called Fury and caught him and Maria almost at the last chance to turn the Quinjet around, and after Pepper dragged Happy from his way back home, they were seated onboard the jet a few dozen calls later.
With that thought he crosses the living room and aims for the back of the house. He already hears a clatter and strangely similar low sound that for a second causes all sorts of emotions to roll throughout his body in rapid waves, until he enters the kitchen and abruptly stops.
“What about her?” Tony asks but Steve starts to make the face again, so he adds as serious as he can be, “Morgan is my daughter, and you’ll have to put up with her, I am afraid. But, hey, I heard you adore her, so it shouldn’t be a problem, right?”
Bruce puts the ice cream down and for a moment he tries to look for words, finally saying only, “Fuck.”
He kneels on the floor with Tony. His hands clench onto Tony’s jacket to the point the fabric rips. He’s desperate to hide in Tony’s arm and holds onto him like his whole existence depends on it.
Tony can only drop his head at that and swear under his breath. When he holds it up, he sees through the layers of glass that Bruce moved to the kitchen. He sits by himself behind the bar and opens a big box of ice cream. Suddenly Tony remembers the news the Guardians brought with them. News about lost chances and missed opportunities. And this thing he got, this third chance shouldn’t be lost or missed. It shouldn’t be wasted. Not when they all paid heavily for it.
Steve takes a quick look through the kitchen window, muttering a question, “Only Pepper knows we are here, right?”
Yeah, Tony thinks, here comes his epic crush with his doom. Except now, the said doom isn’t an intangible idea that’s been building in Tony’s head for years. This one is a breathing and living creature that’s a sum of blue eyes, elegant yet big hands, and (from what he already managed to gather) one piece of an extremely great ass.
“Potts, what the fuck is going on?” a well-known voice that matches a well-known face resounds through the room.
Tony watches as he trails down the steps to the living area. Steve leans against the back of the couch for support and pinches the bridge of his nose, looking like he’s going to collapse from exhaustion any minute now. Wasn’t the guy supposed to be inhumanly durable? That’s kind of disappointing—
Watching as Mantis slowly gravitates toward Steve’s spot, Tony moves himself. After all, he doesn’t want to give any hints that he’s the one behind Manties sudden attack on Cap. Besides, Bruce does look miserable sitting alone in the kitchen and comforting a friend seems to be the best alibi he can get. Still, he doesn't want Bruce to know the reason why he also gravitated toward the kitchen, so he casually walks in under a false pretense of getting something to drink.
,” Tony presses on the last two words. “You can join me, or you can stay here and pretend that you don’t want to.”
“It’s alright.” Pepper puts a warm hand on his shoulder, stopping him as she only says, “I just wanted to check if you need anything.”
“Damn,” Tony says, finally locking his gaze with Steve’s. “You look far too good for someone who’s been frozen for eighty years and then went through hell. What’s your thing? Pilates?”
“Good morning, Captain,” the AI says cheerfully. “It’s 6:43 AM. The temperature outside it’s 55°F and the highest temperature predicted for today is 64°F with clear sky throughout the day and slight overcast in the afternoon. Your actual wakeup time is 6:36, twenty-four minutes before your alarm.”
“What else can you do?” Tony asks as his thumb moves slowly to trace a drop running down Steve’s chin.
Bruce snorts, turning so he can meet Tony’s gaze. “Pepper had basically a whole life built with the other guy, right? She had all these experiences and histories. All these memories. While Steve had what? A few moments? Maybe not even that.
“Yes, yes, we arrived in large numbers.” Thor’s big hand settles on Tony’s shoulder to guide him inside. “We even grabbed the Spiderbaby on our way.”
Steve presses a weak smile and shrugs. “I saw the recording you left for me. And I couldn’t go. In a way I couldn’t leave Pepper and Morgan, yes... But I think the memory of you still strongly held me in this time and space.”
“Boss, I know that you’ve blocked all calls but there is a big number of incoming connections,” she chimes. “Currently thirty-seven and counting. The majority of them are coming from Colonel Rhodes and Mrs. Potts.”
“But what now?” Steve finally asks, a little bit frustrated. “Don’t you want to get your life back? Don’t you want to stay?”
“Well, they are simpler to manage that way.” Tony grins, shrugging. “Besides, that’s more of a scientific experiment. Bruce, are you in? I’d ask you to also get drunk with Rogers, but there might not be enough alcohol in my cellar for that”
And when Tony meets her eyes again, he instantly sees her realization. The annoyance is momentarily gone. Instead, there is this softness in her gaze he has never seen before. It feels private. It’s probably something that other versions of himself are used to, but right now it feels like a novelty. And it’s nothing strange or awkward. Pepper is a beautiful woman. The time that passed since the last time he saw her had only left a gentle mark. And it bestowed upon her even more grace and ephemeral charm. She hasn’t lost her wit and sharp mind either. The spark of it is still burning in her eyes. So, no, it’s not strange. It’s a huge privilege. She looks at him with care and understanding. She looks at him like he means something to her. Even if he doesn’t. Not yet at least. And even if he has done nothing to deserve it. Well, not him.
The holo-screen appears above their heads. FRIDAY quickly displays the recording and here is Tony laying on his side on the almost white stone of the airstrip that before was meant for a private plan but now it mostly serves the military. Tony looks incredibly pale. Even on the recording from a CCTV camera, his skin is pepperlike, clothing his muscles and bones like a strained piece of parchment. He’s dehydrated. That's for sure. He’s also unconscious. Maybe even nearly dead because his breaths are almost convulsive. It’s a painful thing to watch but Tony knows he needs to do this. He needs to know.
It’s so different from how Steve feels that it’s almost unreal. Because maybe for the first time in many years Steve is absolutely and utterly calm. And the reality of this hits him especially hard in this very moment when he can just lay here with Tony, talk about nothing and enjoy a moment of peace and quiet that isn’t going to be interrupted. He has no place to be or an errand to run. No mission. Nothing. Completely nothing.
Ah, the alien invasion, he recalls and momentarily regrets this line of thinking because with it comes the rest. He had been kidnapped, then mutilated, then his uncle betrayed him and then, and then, and then— One event after another landed him in 2023 married to one Pepper Potts.
“Can you check what someone feels for me?” Tony says carefully. “Like corner someone strategically to check what’s on their mind and then report back to me?”
“And what about me, huh?” Tony snorts, lowering his head to catch Steve’s gaze. He searches Steve’s eyes, and starts to smile more openly as he says, “I just confessed my undying love for you and all you managed to talk about is Morgan. I’m offended since I think my declaration was pretty damn neat. So seriously, am I nothing to you?”
“What I mean is that you weren’t acting like yourself,” Steve corrects himself and shifting on the bed, he settles on his side, continuing, “You were consumed by grief. And anger. And you were hurt. By me.”
He shuts his eyes tightly, lowers his head and just tries to search for it. And he sees blue, calm eyes. He hears the timbre of a deep, smooth voice. He feels the ghost of touch.
Tony must have stood at the bottom as well. He moves only his hands to stay in place. Giving Steve a long look, he smirks. “Damn, Doctor Erskine really was a genius.”
Crossing his arms tighter, Steve braces himself for Tony's next words. Tony comes closer and stands in front of him, resting on the back of the deck opposite to mimic Steve’s position.
Steve doesn’t register how many hours he just sits there, holding this thing in his hands and listening to the recording repeatedly. For all he knows, it could be days. He realizes it’s dark outside. The night overtakes the world yet again like nothing has changed. That much he can sense. But other than that? Nothing. He feels nothing. No sadness. No relief. Not even anger. He’s empty.
Steve looks back at Pepper with a silent question and sees that it’s not only his imagination. She feels that too.
He runs down the stairs and aims straight for the kitchen. He doesn’t remember if Pepper mentioned something about restocking the pantry and fridge. Yesterday, they only made the minimum arrangements required for them to stay here, renting the car and buying some clothes so Tony wouldn’t have to transfer from the UCLA facility in a hospital gown. Everything else had been pushed to the background because figuring out how to introduce this Tony to his daughter with minimal damage to their relationship occupied most of their minds. And then they had to only think of a way to let others know what happened, fill in Stark Industry’s board that their main shareholder slash the-hen-that-lays-golden-eggs is still alive, and try to invent a way to keep this all under wraps from the public.
“Yeah, but—” Steve stops himself, feeling uncomfortable. He crosses his arms, all hampered when he says the next words, “Is that all?”
“I’m not saying that Tony should watch everything,” Steve explains. “But maybe some big moments for us like this party?”
How can one person carry so much passion with a single gesture like this? Steve doesn’t know. He might never know. But he feels all the things that suddenly leave his body being replaced only with a yearning for more. The desperation of Tony’s touch eases the constant tension that has tormented him for all these weeks. The way Tony whispers Steve’s name when their lips part for a fraction of a second soothes all the pain in his chest. The way Tony moans with pleasure against his lips, erases all the longing.
So yeah, slowly Tony discovers that there is so much more to his childhood hero. He starts to see all the bits and pieces of
“Geez, she just looks for a cheap sensation because apparently, that’s what she does now.” Tony rolls his eyes. “And it’s clear she wears a massive chip on her shoulder called Avengers.”
“I found her when I was looking for someone else,” Wanda explains matter-of-factly. “She was stuck between worlds.”
Tony puts the tablet down when he hears another burst of laughter coming from downstairs. He had a plan of not getting out of bed for at least another hour or two. He even got a free pass on breakfast to make up for the lost sleep or at least to catch up on the news in peace. But hearing the deep, well-known voice and the giggles that follow, he’s more and more tempted to leave the prescribed R&R and just go downstairs.
There are a lot of drifts and even more digressions. In the stories, that is. They often talk about the world that they basically both suddenly ended up in together. By accident, they are both men out of time now, but even though Tony’s still a futurist and he already sees endless possibilities of upgrades to his works, it’s Steve’s role to guide him through these new settings. And again, Tony should be worried, but he really isn’t. Somehow, these evenings become some kind of ritual that they both seem to really need.
The thing with him making plans is that they apparently rarely go according to said plans. Or maybe it’s just one of the characteristics of this new life of his. Either way, when Tony approaches his house in Malibu and has a whole speech prepared, rehearsed and then rehearsed some more, he’s determined to lay everything out and to confront Steve. He wants to ask point blank what was going on between them and what is going on currently (because he
“FRIDAY, inform Captain Rogers that I’m coming back, and I want to talk to him,” he says, and he sneaks out of the workshop. Touching the housing unit lightly, he lets the suit unfold and takes him up.
“Fuck,” Tony huffs and grinding through his teeth, he adds, “You really can be irritating sometimes.”
Others tried to tag along. Thor and Bruce were the most persistent but Pepper, being her stubborn self, urged them to pick up their lives, or at least the bits and pieces that were left.
famous Captain America that Steve probably only shows to a few people on this planet. For example, the guy has as much snark as Tony (if not more) and that’s an achievement. But there is this whole dry wit mixed with a commitment to everything Steve does (even burning dinner) that Tony totally digs. He also doesn’t take any of Tony’s shit and that’s just fucking sexy. So yeah, Steve’s hot. His ass is delicious. The beard starts to be a thing too. And what’s more disturbing is that this hotness is far beyond his looks. They are the cherry on top, of course. Certainly, they don’t interrupt. Especially when they sit together in Tony’s workshop deep into the night. Tony’s working on the next suit, learning all the ins and outs of his designs, while Steve tells him stories upon stories of their journey. Sometimes Bruce joins them and tells his versions. Sometimes Rhodey comes in too. But most of the time it’s just the two of them, soft music and the beeping of DUM-E or U trying to help Tony at his work.
“But after that,” Steve suggests. “Tony, it’s been three weeks and at least a dozen times we ended up like this.”
He runs his fingers through Steve’s beard, savoring the sensation of hard stubble under his fingertips before he settles them under Steve’s jaw to prop his chin up.
Just like that he’s able to feel the heat that radiates from Tony’s body. He smells the scent of his skin that is so similar and known, just like the other Tony, and yet it’s also somehow new or maybe forgotten. Because right now Steve realizes that they haven’t been this close and this alone for years. And it suddenly hits him. He understands. He doesn’t know how he didn’t see it. After all, it’s so similar to that time when they were here together seven years ago.
“Then yada, yada, yada and I wake up here. The first thing I do is to call all the people I know and matter to me, strangely not that many came to mind, but every number was radio silent until I called my own,” Tony explains.
So why is he so angry right now? Because he’s afraid that he’ll never be someone important to this version of Tony? Because there is no time for that? And why does he even think about it? This, his feelings… They are irrelevant. It’s Morgan’s life that’s essential to keep intact. He needs to do everything in his power to give her father back. And he needs to try to give Pepper another chance with Tony. Steve’s sure that’s what Tony would have wanted.
he shortly considered using the suit to get an advantage over him, but he figured out that this might piss Steve off completely. So, Tony got in the car with only his pants and jacket on, and squeezing from the Audi all its promised power, hoping that he’d be in the house in time. For some reason he suspected the worst. And he proves himself right when he sees that the only light switched in the house comes from Steve’s room. Tony sees the man’s shadow moving quickly and efficiently, clearly packing.
“Yeah, because I hate this kind of thing. These dinners and events where all we have to do is to kiss ass, or act like circus animals that are there to perform.” Steve delivers firmly, and before he thinks about the next words, he adds, “And I didn’t have much of a breather between what happened with Thanos, your funeral, and then you coming back.”
He moves up and shifts to the other end of the bed that’s closer to Steve. Still, in his sweatpants and tank top (because obviously, Captain Modesty would never ever try to undress him and stay in the same room) he scooches on the covers.
story because they hit it off from the start even if the guy’s green and huge. But they just speak the same language and Tony instantly feels like he’s known Bruce for ages. And it must be true because there is a whole laboratory built one floor below his workshop. It’s clearly set up for Bruce with all the equipment done to match his needs. They spent almost the whole first night there, talking theories and plans for what they have to do to figure out this whole time travel mess up. Bruce is also the only one who’s able to properly explain to Tony what really went down with the Blip, bringing people back and Thanos. And Tony maybe should be concerned, but somehow the only thing he feels is just pure excitement.
Tony only shakes his head and gives him a weak smile. He leans closer though. His lips are soft and tender on Steve’s as he kisses him slowly. The kiss doesn’t mean to lead anywhere. It’s more like Tony wants to erase all the bad memories they had and replace them with pleasure. And it seems to work so far because Steve relaxes again. He lets Tony push him back into the pillows and to be claimed all over again.
“I’m starving, so where are we going today?” Tony asks as he turns to Steve and smiles brightly. “I think I'm up for Mexican, but I’m open for negotiation.”
And Steve smiles but still only weakly when he asks, “Why haven't you told me that you know? Why did you even want to speak to me?”
And Steve’s left with a ghost of a touch that’s still warm on his arm, one small victory and still another dozen calls to make.
“Duh, of course,” Tony says matter-of-factly. “But come one now, untangle your spider limbs enough for me to walk to the couch.”
And so, he does. He lets his fingertips travel on Tony’s skin. He feels the sand roll under them as he runs them back and forth. He traces an uneven pattern delicately, moving from Tony’s hips to his back. Painting fading lines at Tony’s sides, he digs his fingers deeper. And then he smooths them down Tony’s legs to help him get out of his pants to finally settle them at the back of Tony’s thighs, closing them hard on Tony’s buttocks to drive the man closer.
