“Um, I didn’t know you two knew each other. If that were the case, we could have all been introduced sooner.” Pepper tried for a save but Tony was too busy gawking as Barnes also sauntered into view, looking far, far too attractive in his very own dress uniform.
Bucky’s single flesh hand started sweating as those big, melted-chocolate eyes slowly considered him.
Ross made a point of waiting until Tony was finished with the his debrief and reports before calling him into his office. This should go over well…
“Well, now that introductions are through, I think we should get to our table.” Pepper gave Tony a look that could only mean one thing.
“My story?” A bark of laughter slipped through Roger’s lips, his head shaking in disbelief. ‘What’s your story,’ said the rich kid under investigation for the death of his Granddad who wouldn’t even fuckin’ say why he didn’t go to the funeral.
Stark’s mouth recovered near instantly and the brunette went for an eloquent, “what was that about my prick?”
The police weren’t supposed to let anyone besides family enter the grounds, so why the shit was an R8 speeding around the bend and into the view of the entire family? The dogs outside went absolutely wild as a man stepped out, causing Steve to roll his eyes.
“Uh, yeah. Rain check.” Steve parrots and stands from the bed. The blonde hands Tony his shoes and walks him to the door. God damn interruptions. Stark is dawdling some by the door though and Steve makes the most of it. He stalks right up to him, nearly forcing Tony to step back against the door and tilts the mechanic’s face up towards him, hesitating for a slight second to give Tony the chance to pull away. When he doesn’t Steve closes the distance in a knee-buckling kiss, hand sliding back to cradle Tony’s head. His free hand settles on the small of Tony’s back and Steve’s practically pushing the shorter man onto his tiptoes as he all but plunders his mouth. And god, it’s
General Ross’ face goes positively red with anger just as Tony shuts the door behind him. Christ. Where had that come from? Well, he was never any good at flying beneath the radar anyway.
There’s only one reason he would be reaching for his arm and Tony refuses to believe it. There is no way in hell—
Tony pulls away, a coy smile on his face for the eyes that had been drawn to them. Right. They were still out in public and Tony Stark was a big deal. The Iron Avenger playfully lilts his head towards the door and Rogers is already moving back his chair to follow. And just because he can (and to keep appearances, of course) Steve loops his fingers through the beltloops of those perfectly tailored slacks, winking at, who he assumes, is Eloise, as they make their way towards the stairs. Once they’re out of sight though, Tony’s quick to bat at his hand, putting a few steps of distance between them without saying a word. It… hurt, but Rogers wasn’t dumb enough to think that Stark would be welcoming him with open arms. The blonde clears his throat, face heating a fraction.
They froze in place and looked each other in the eye, both hoping it would leave them be and move on. After an uncomfortably long moment, there was another snarl, followed by the call of a wolf in the distance and the noise of something big moving off through the trees. That was enough to convince them to turn back. Good thing too, because right at that moment the sky opened up, and they were soaked to the bone by the time they made it back to the bungalow.
These are the kind of moments when the ‘Steve Rogers stubborn’ shines. Tony watches him dig into that deep well of inner strength that he keeps for just such an occasion, as he pulls himself up off the table and onto his feet (that have shoes on them, praise whatever deity will help them right now). Steve doesn’t answer any of Tony’s entreaties about if he’s okay, he just squares his jaw, growls, “Let’s go,” and heads for the door.
The plan had been to level the whole block and turn it into a shiny new SI satellite office in Brooklyn. But Steve cared. That’s just Steve all over. He cared about the multigenerational families who had made that ramshackle block their home. He cared about the architectural integrity of the community where he’d located his little one-man office. He got Tony to listen (Tony could spend a lifetime just listening to Steve), mesmerised him with that earnest, compelling (and so sexy) voice. He told him the stories that made that block a special place, crumbling but held together by duct tape and love.
But fire, fire meant heat, and heat would turn this whole thing around. Tony had had the presence of mind to put the ring in his pocket when he changed out of his wet things. As soon as they were cuddling up together on the couch, drinking hot tea and watching the flame flicker with warmth, they would have a laugh, and feel the closeness that goes with having come through an adventure. Then it would be the perfect moment.
He knew that escape had been a longshot. Running through the forest in his stocking feet with nothing but a stick for a weapon. Stupid really, but since when could Tony Stark sit tight and wait for a rescue? This was not his first kidnapping rodeo after all. But this time he really had something to lose. At the end of the day he didn’t care what happened to him so long as he got Steve out.
Someone must have been listening for when he woke, because no sooner had he shut his mouth, than the door rattled and some thug came in to gloat. How did Tony know they were here to gloat? Like he said, not his first kidnapping by a long shot, and they always came in to gloat. They think they are there to intimidate you, to scare you into submission or something. But it’s really about them feeling in control, when what they actually are is in the middle of a giant clusterfuck of their own making.
“But what I want to know is what was the hat thing? It was blue and had an “A” on it. Steve wasn’t wearing it before he changed. I didn’t know that werewolves had fashion choices. It looked like something Captain America wore back in the 60’s when he was with the Avengers.”
No problem, Tony’s flexible, he can roll with the punches. That hot bath and the roaring fire would be just the right prelude to set the scene for a cozy fireside proposal. He just had to get his shivering love warmed through in the tub and everything would be back on track. Except, Tony being Tony, it couldn’t just work like that because there was no hot water! A quick look around told him that the access to the basement, where the boiler and the fuses would be, was locked tight. Tony could fix just about anything, but it was clear the owner did not want his guests mucking around with his equipment.
“Depends on which daddy,” Tony answered playfully, pulling out his phone to scroll through messages as they walked through the threshold of the home. It’s a message from JARVIS. Interesting. A decorated war veteran. Born and raised in Brooklyn to a Sarah—  why did that name ring a bell? Never part of the police force. How strange.
Good god, this was a total disaster. Why had these memories been scrubbed from his brain? Why couldn’t he remember what actually happened? Tony probably hates him. If not for his parents alone, then… Fuck.
still be drunk or he’s hallucinating. Rogers looks unimpressed, as if he’s waiting for Tony to actually do
“Don’t disappoint me now. I thought you said you had your own set? Well, it doesn't matter. We can use Officer Wilson’s just fine— hey, you— what?”
He watched Rogers get a nervous look about him; Steve was obviously hiding something. Something that had to do with Tony, no doubt. What exactly was he missing from his memories? Had something happened?
Was he really doing this? Was he really going to drop everything and fly damn near halfway across the world to help the man who murdered his parents? Who stole his soulmate?
“Tony, then. Listen, I’ve been tryin’ to be as polite as I can about it, but I guess the message never got across.”
There. That might be enough to get Tony to rise to the challenge. At this point, Steve can’t figure out if Tony is actually interested in him or if it’s simple curiosity. It isn’t like the billionaire isn’t aware of his proclivities. Maybe he should have listened to Buck on this one and just asked Tony out. This is so much more fun though.
up at work.” Tony grinned innocently. Rhodes groaned loudly from somewhere to his left. Tony swore on Marie Curie that the corners of the other brunette man’s lips turned up in a grin.
Steve opened his mouth and shut it again, charcoal tinged fingers twitching at his sides. “Bucky. What’s the last thing you remember? Right before cryo?”
Tony blinks dumbly for a couple of seconds, “To get water. Morning’ to you too.” Steve didn’t seem exactly perturbed that Stark was here and Tony was still in his silk underwear so… “What uh, what happened last night?”
“Please Captain,” Zemo simpers, “The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the blast of UR-100 rockets.”
“Find. My parents both died in a car accident when I was young, about ten or eleven. Obie and Strange were friends of the family and took me in. Went to MIT at fifteen. Graduated at seventeen. I started my own small company at eighteen, Stark Industries. Mainly robotics, data, analysis. Stane wants me to dabble in weapons but—“ Tony shrugged and tapped the ashes into the little tray to his left.
“I already know what you want, and the answer is no. As if I would give up the opportunity to watch you squirm.”
The billionaire runs nimble fingers through chestnut curls, eyes landing on the small, black oval shape that lay in front of him. This stupid thing had been burning a hole in his pocket ever since he’d returned from Bordeaux. He didn’t know what spurred him to move it from the top drawer of his dresser to his person. It had felt weighty and awkward at first, and not just because this technology belonged in a museum. It hardly ever left his person now though, a little, somewhat comforting object he could fiddle with in his pocket. Never mind what it actually did, what he
The moment he relented and lay down in bed, Steve realized he didn’t know exactly what he was getting himself into. Sure, yeah, he was down to fuck. Who wouldn’t be with Tony? But there was that competitive look glinting in those whiskey eyes, telling him this was going to be so much more.
Thankfully, T’Challa joins their little gathering almost immediately after and beckons Tony towards the palace. The Iron Avenger seems to relax and quickly follows after the King without a second glance towards the super soldier duo.
The city is admittedly beautiful. Definitely not the kind of place he would expect a terrorist-for-hire like Batroc to be hiding out in, though, he supposed the amount of civilian life was an easy enough method of escaping or negotiation should the man need it. That exactly was high on the list of reasons to catch him.
what do you have to say for yourself? The fact that you didn’t mention him at all is an act against what you agreed to when you signed the Accords. If it were up to me, there would be serious ramifications.”
A dark-haired man, Bruce, scoffed, arms crossed over his chest as Wilson looked on encouragingly. “That kid is spoiled. Never had a job, always got away with his late parents’ and, more recently, Fury’s money. Got sent to MIT at fifteen. We all expected more from him but after graduation and all that, he’s been— well, he’s not here, is he?”
He and Rhodey had been here the better part of five years and not once had they ever received any type of complaint! The sheer fucking audacity.
A minute or so later Tony was coming, crying out the detective’s name as he painted the sheets below him. Steve was murmuring into the other’s ear and pumping his hand as he did so—and then he was right behind Tony, his thrusts unsteady before a wave of pleasure crashed into him. Blue eyes shutting tightly and lips parting in a moan, he managed some mixture of Tony’s name and a handful of curses.
“All of my designs are one of a kind, so you can see why I value my privacy. Justin Hammer from Hammer Industries, has been quite literally trying to get up my ass for a joint partnership but not even I could save his shit company. Though I guess I can’t blame him, it is a pretty nice ass.” Tony snarked, his little bark of laughter causing the other to roll his eyes.
Tony could feel the blush spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears and he felt Rogers staring at him expectantly. Oh, right, he’d been standing there like an idiot.
this road. What is this?” Tony shouts out louder. His skin prickles with anxiety. Why would Zemo have something with the same date as the day of the accident?
Immediately the blonde’s face became a mirror image of what he was sure his looked like, a large, tattooed hand coming up to rub at the back of the soldier’s neck.
. That had chipped at Tony’s heart, no matter what he told himself. And just like most things in Tony’s life, it only got worse.
Tony was an asshole. A bratty bottom. A little shit. That teasing grin was enough to make the detective roll his eyes in annoyance; he was ready to fuck, dammit. Sculpted arms practically lifted the younger off him, moving him to the side of the bed to slip off his jeans and underwear all the way. Stormy eyes went hungry at the sight of Tony naked.
Scarred fingers flex in the sheets like Tony’s life depends on it as Steve is sliding home. And when he hits Tony’s prostate for the first time, the younger man jerks and his back bows almost painfully.
“Hammer Industries,” he repeated, rolling the name off his tongue like he was trying to place it. And then he was distracted, eyes moving to the curve of Stark’s ass. Fair enough.
When Rogers hit him back with his own itching powder (seriously, unoriginal), Tony got him back by saran-wrapping the man’s entire car. With about twenty rolls of the stuff.  Rhodey definitely gave him an earful for that one.
Steve’s Brooklyn accent was coming in strong. “Tony, I’m askin’ nicely. Doncha’ think you’re being a little unreasonable?”
“No, actually, I don’t think I am. It’s after hours, I’m closed up and if you don’t mind, I have a lot of orders to finish up by tomorrow night so…”
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin, almost toppling the large order he’d been concentrating on. Who the hell—
don’t understand. You don’t get to just- call on me to fix your problems anymore.” Tony scoffs and runs a hand over his face, wow, he was really so stupid. “And here I thought that might have actually been serious about what you said to me in France.”
As they enter the chamber, the lights flicker on. Hazy, yellow mist descends inside the newly illuminated capsules. The vaguely human shapes inside remain deathly still. All three men glance around the room, bewildered. What the fuck was going on here?
Tony had tracked them to the airport in Germany, trying to talk some sense into Rogers, to turn himself and Barnes in. Of course, he’d already known how that was going to go. The fight broke out, Barnes and Rogers just slipping out of his grasp. It wasn’t supposed to go this way. They weren’t supposed to be in this situation. And then Rhodey was shot out of the sky and Tony’s heart nearly broke in half right then and there. Rhodey,
He was obsessed with it. Rogers hardly slept or ate, hardly did anything at all that didn’t involve searching for clues or signs of the Winter Soldier’s next appearance. And despite Tony wanting to be there for him, wanting to show his support for his soulmate, he couldn’t do anything about the growing gap between them.
To his own horror, his mind supplied plenty of helpful ideas: You could always fuck the answers out. Jesus. Steve coughed, eyes widening in self-hatred. Why was he like this, huh? This is why he couldn’t have nice things.
The genius was surprised when he saw the large figure of the Captain looming beneath his awning. What the hell was he doing here? Was he holding— “Rogers?”
Aside from their little pissing match, the rest of the night went on fairly well. Bucky, Sam, and Natasha made for great company and as glasses were drained with more frequency, Tony found himself relaxing.
“Well, considering this hotel is full of civilians and that Batroc has a knack for causing high casualties wherever he goes, we need to keep this as low profile as we can. I can get us into his room, but you need to move fast and grab the bastard before he has any chance of escaping. If we lose him, or worse, this turns into a hostage situation, then its over.”
Tony barely noticed though, whiskey eyes still wide with disbelief as they stare at his own signature on Barnes’ wrist. This— how was this happening?
Rogers sighed heavily, suddenly looking much more exhausted than he had a few moments ago, before he straightens and steels himself as if he were stepping into enemy lines. “There was a— fight. After the airport.” There’s a far off look in the blonde’s gaze; he’s clearly somewhere else. “I don’t— I’m— uh, it didn’t end good, Buck.”
The captain settles the shield on his back before sighing softly. “Look Tony, there’s something else, uh, going on here. It happened back in Germany, but everyone was a little busy at the time.” The blonde chances a glance at this partner(?) again, Barnes nodding once.
Casually slipping off his suit jacket, Steve’s head lolled to the side. “So, how many times did you have to mow your dad’s lawn to get the fancy car? Or was it a sweet 16 gift? Some sort of bribe to stop spilling secrets about your aunt and uncle’s affair? Definitely had to be something. Can’t really picture you workin’ unless it’s in, y’know, the bedroom,” he snarked playfully.
was definitely implied but the words would not leave his lips. Still, it seemed as though Stark got the point.
Tony had woken up sore, with a crick in his back and a brand-new soul mark. Pretty, curvy letters stamped right across his left wrist.
The Captain let his free hand wander and his lips roam, before Tony pulled him back in for another heated kiss. Tony was melting, and it was the way he was practically sticking to Steve’s skin that had him sighing into the other’s mouth. They were leaning further against the oak table, a mess of hands scrambling against the wood and on clothing and in hair. Bitten lips eventually parted from one another, sucking in air with heaving chests. Thin fingers snapped his suspenders against his chest. It sent a jolt through Steve, the heat going straight to his cock.
Stark really hates that he finds that cartoonish accent ridiculously hot. He turns with a sly grin, finally lighting the end of his cigarette and continues walking backwards as he catches the other man’s eye.
“Right. We’ll give all of you a few hours to settle in for the next couple of days, but then we’d like to sit down with every one of you. And Mr. Rogers here might be kind enough to ‘appreciate your cooperation’—“ here, Wilson spoke with air quotes, “—but I’m requiring it. No leaving the estate grounds without express permission from one of us.”
The Iron Avenger threw himself onto the grease stained couch, a pounding migraine making it difficult to sort out his thoughts. God damn it. This was way out of his league. This was his technical soulmate that seemed to be struggling and his actual soulmate was asking for help.
The mechanic puts down his glass of wine, Rogers watching the way his body slightly stiffens up, prepares for an attack. Only he’d be able to catch something like that on Tony. Those whiskey eyes are round with surprise for a split second before the mask slams on, a well practiced smile nearly blinding Steve and the crowd around them.
Sweet Tesla, the blonde rendered him monosyllabic. No one should be allowed to be that good looking. All heavily corded muscles, biceps for days and that tapered waist. And boy howdy, Tony was sure enjoying watching him bound up the stairs. Tony was possibly developing the most pathetic crush ever.
Tony hardly heard what she was spewing at him, more preoccupied by the police officer and the— hold the phone, “Uh-oh, hottie alert.” Tony grinned, amber eyes pinned on the blonde man behind the silly cop standing at the front of the door. Well. This just got
Bucky feels Steve’s large paw land on his shoulder and for a few seconds, he’s unsure of how to proceed. There’s tension radiating off of Tony as the mask of indifference slams back down.
“Tony—” Steve starts and rubs a hand over his face because, god, of course Tony would show up drunk. Steve’s not an asshole. “You’ve been drinking Tony. You know that’s a set up for a bad idea.”
Sure enough, Tony touched down a few hours later. T’Challa, Shuri and some of the Dora, along with Sam and Natasha had tagged along the super soldier welcoming party. Okoye and Ayo come out first, and when Tony finally appears, Bucky can’t keep his eyes off of him. The pretty chestnut curls, slicked and styled to perfection. The grey suit that hugs the Avenger perfectly. Those big, expressive eyes that make Bucky feel completely stupid. Tony was— awfully pretty. It’s made the butterflies in his stomach even more agitated than they already were.
Not only had Rogers up and disappeared, but when he finally reappeared again, he’d gained a new shadow. One metal armed, shaggy haired brunette. James Barnes.
“Not that I don’t appreciate the thorough investigation, but we all just buried my father a night ago,” Bruce grumbled. “After celebrating his birthday with him, is this all absolutely necessary?”
Tony’s arrival in Wakanda was the only thing he could focus on. The man would be here in just a few short hours and Bucky had absolutely no idea what he was going to say to him. Should he apologize? Yes, absolutely, he needed to get Rogers on the same boat as him. But… what in the wide world could Bucky possibly tell Tony so the other would give him a chance? Not that Bucky blamed Steve for coming to look for him, he would have done the same thing after all but, pushing your soulmate out of the loop like that just— well, whatever. No use in throwing blame around when it already happened.
Okay. So, Pep was definitely pissed at him. Tony threw his head back and sighed, exasperated. Why? Tony wasn’t one to believe in fate or anything as asinine as that, but it seemed like the odds were really against them.
It didn’t leave much wiggle room, sky blue eyes landing on Stark as a puff of smoke left his lips, which quirked upward in a smirk. It was fucking stupid, that oh so polite way of saying “stay the fuck in place,” those glinting eyes and slip of a grin being directed at him. Yeah right. As if anyone here truly thinks that Tony won’t jump back into his Audi and get the hell out of fuck town.
God, and it was so good. Tony’s lips stung with the taste of smoke and bourbon, the smell of his expensive cologne up close and personal. It didn’t take long for heat to start coursing through Steve, fingers sliding from Stark’s hair to his top of his throat.
Steve opened the door and he folded himself in, all too aware of how small the inside of the car was compared to a man of his stature. Small, but easily the most expensive he’d ever seen. Should he—you know what? No, he didn’t have to hold back. The prick could clearly take what he dealt out. Thick fingers slid the seatbelt into place, the small click drowned out by the revving engine.
The tips of Steve’s ears and high on his perfect cheekbones flushed a pretty pink. “Wait what? Buck—my
The detective’s accented voice trailed off once his shoe hit carpet: They were in the bedroom. Quiet, simple, minimalistic, just like the rest of Stark’s house, with just a hint of what he guessed was actually the guy’s personality. A couple of bright paintings, a record player with a stack of vinyls adjacent to it, photos of nice cars and pet projects he’d worked on. Tony was completely at ease as he strode in, just like he had millions of times before.
“I read about you on Twitter! You’re the, uh, the one famous detective. The one everyone compares to Sherlock Holmes,” the kid laughed in disbelief. “You do all the really crazy cases. You just did the one in Germany. With the underground Nazis.”
They weren’t at that stage anymore. No matter that the blonde was his literal soulmate, they weren’t involved any longer.
Out of all the stupid ideas he’s had, this was definitely turning out to be a favorite. It was clear that Tony couldn’t decide between dropping to his knees or keeping that playful pout on him. Nothing wrong with making that decision for him, right?
The tick in Steve’s jaw made a small appearance as it clenched tightly, lips stretched into a thin line as he was unmasked. In front of him, Stark stood, a vicious smirk on his face, one hand on his hip as the other slashed through the air in the general vicinity of the detective.
That night, Odin ordered Loki be changed back to his original form. Loki was forever broken by what happened and secluded himself. His hatred for Odin only grew from there. Thor tried to get close to Loki again, but Loki wouldn’t allow it.  Even through all of this, Loki and Thor never forgot about Nova.
“Well, I can take you two out to eat or to go shopping whenever so you still get to see her. It won’t be a forever goodbye,” Toni said, patting Nova’s back. “Say, where’d you get the necklace?”
“Well, the chain has never been replaced. It is almost like it grows when I do. And nobody else can touch it. One of the older kids tried to take it off of me when I was younger, and it shocked them. I just figured it was just a little electricity or something, but it is
“Are you fucking kidding me? I’m done. Coulson, you handle the rest of this. I’m done with this,” Fury said in anger.
One chapter left guys, and I'm getting a little sad.  This one is shorter, so I am hoping I can make the last one longer. I am so thankful for all of you guys. I almost didn't put this story up because I was worried no one would like it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
“Phil!” Nova cried out. She hit the glass and made a bigger crack. Phil fell to the ground and Loki went back to the panel; he pressed a few buttons so the floor would open below the container. Thor grabbed Nova as Loki hit the button to make the container fall from the Helicarrier.
With that, the two flew out of the apartment. Toni didn’t call Pepper to tell her what had happened or where they were going, so when Pepper returned to the destroyed apartment, she nearly had a heart attack.
“I am not prepared for what is to come. I would like to think I am, or soon could be. I never wanted this to happen,” Loki said. Thor walked up.
When Nova arrived at the bridge, she searched for Fury. She spotted the man right in the center of it all, speaking to Maria, Phil, and another man.
,” Jarvis replied. Toni did as the AI said and stopped at the door. She removed her helmet and walked through the door. Natasha was sitting next to a passed out Clint
“I’m scared, Pep. What if something is really wrong with her? I’m so scared I’m going to screw her life up, when all I want to do is give her a better one,” Toni said, sitting on the couch with her face in her hands.
on her way back to Malibu, but she was actually with Phil. They would be going to the mansion to pick up some clothes, and they would be going to the base Natasha and Phil reported to.
“Nova’s okay. She’s been trying to get ahold of me but couldn’t get signal or something...” Toni said quietly.
“I’m destructive, self-centered. I’m hurting her more than I’m helping her. She could’ve been seriously hurt because I didn’t send her with Pepper. What happened to Coulson could’ve happened to-”
Loki turned back around with a glare on his face. Toni continued, “And you sir, just happened to piss every single one of them off.”
“Back away from the girl!” Happy’s voice called out loudly. The man made his way through the circle of reporters to grab Nova. “Let’s go Noves, we’ve got to get to the Expo.”
“Yes. We planned on building an arsenal, but I never put my money on it because there was something riskier I was more interested in. Stark knows about it. There was an idea called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that dream,” Fury stated. Toni shook her head and walked out of the room. She was too pissed off for this.
“I’m just ready to leave, I guess. I didn’t plan on bringing much; I just want my phone to take pictures with,” Nova shrugged.
I just want to give a quick heads up, I am nearing the end of this book. I've been brainstorming a sequel and some one shots, though, so don't worry :)
“I learned from the best~” Nova sung. Toni gave fake glare, but Nova saw right through it. The two shared a laugh.
“I shall be honest; he probably will not do anything until my mother decides. I do not believe Loki will perish, but I worry he will be a prisoner the rest of his life,” Thor replied.
Nova hadn’t realized she was crying until she sniffled. Loki had looked so innocent, and that was only almost fifteen years ago. Loki had been through hell, and he was going to have a hard time coming back from it.
“Here,” Nova said, handing him the wrap. Loki could tell something was wrong. He attempted to take a bite, even though Mjolnir was holding his arms down.
“No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the temple, and I found a baby. Small, for a giant’s offspring. Abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufeyson,” Odin said.
“Four years ago this really nice man and woman wanted to adopt me. They were almost through the paperwork when they decided they wanted someone else. They left me behind and took another girl my age, instead. I guess I’m just worried you won’t want me anymore,” Nova said as she started to tear up again. Toni got up from her spot and sat down next to Nova on the couch. She gave her a big hug and rubbed her back.
Loki ran her fingers through Thor’s hair and sighed. She then laid her other hand on her stomach and whispered, “Nova.” A soft kick was the reply Loki got.
“And then she started acting very naughty. Don’t be like that, understand?” Pepper interjected, coming up to the two, pointing a finger at Nova.
With a lot of convincing, and an ungodly amount of more testing, Nova was finally able to leave the base. She was due to start sophomore year within the next week, and Nova couldn’t be more excited. Toni was nervous, her kid was going to be a sophomore and the said kid had just turned thirteen last month!
“Screw that! I’m calling her now!” Toni yelled. She picked up her Stark phone and dialed Nova’s number. It rang twice before it was picked up.
“Yeah, Fury doesn’t tell you a lot of things,” Toni said. Suddenly, lightning started to strike outside the Quinjet.
“I recognize that the council has made a decision, but given that it’s a stupid ass decision, I’ve elected to ignore it,” Fury responded.
“Don’t touch it!” Nova shouted, putting a hand over the necklace. Fury gave her a look that could kill. “Sorry! It shocks someone if they touch it. I just didn’t want that to happen. Jarvis said that it is made from a metal not from Earth and it contains magical properties.”
“It’ll be okay Tones. It might be good for her to get away for a while. She can take a break and you can, too,” Pepper said.
“No need to be sorry, you didn’t know. She’s the best thing to ever happen to me,” Nova replied with a smile. Natasha gave a small smile.
“You okay?” Steve asked, entering the room. Toni quickly wiped away any tears that may have been present and turned around.
Nova didn’t know what to do. She clenched her hands into fists and closed her eyes tightly. She let out a loud wail, and all of the loose furniture in the room flew towards the walls and each window broke. Toni entered the large apartment through one of the broken windows. Nova opened her eyes.
“Well, every now and then, sometimes the pain is so bad, my eyes shine green and the pain goes away, but it makes me pass out,” Nova said. “It has something to do with my birth father I think. I saw him when I was out one time. Bright green eyes and black hair. I think he’s the one that made my necklace.”
“I think Phil was supposed to tell you. He probably didn’t because he knew you needed to get stuff done,” Nova replied. “I like the new design, by the way. Looks way cooler than the last one.”
“Of course my darling. I shall leave you and Thor with her for only a few minutes. Odin must not become suspicious,” Frigga warned. Thor nodded, and the nurse handed the child to Loki. The nurse and Frigga then left the room.
I just want to give a HUGE thank you to all of the people who left comments, kudos, and bookmarks on Home. You don't know how much it means to me! <3
Natasha looked over to Bruce for help. “Oh it’s okay Nova, thank you for your help. If Ms. Romanov needs you go with her,” Bruce said.
“There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that,” Steve said. He grabbed a chute and his shield and jumped out of the plane.
“No I don’t want it green! What do I have to apologize for?” Pepper yelled. Toni couldn’t help but break down laughing.
“Oh, but see J, I don’t care. I’ve got plans with Pepper and my daughter,” Toni said, reading the display.
Toni and Coulson walked through the door next, and Toni responded, “It’s a stabilizing agent. It’s so the portal wont collapse on itself like it did at the base. With the Iridium, he can also keep the portal open as long as he wants.”
“You know, I did read those books as well,” Thor said, smirking at the woman. Loki rolled her eyes and handed their daughter to Thor.
“Promise me you won’t forget about me,” Toni said. Nova’s mouth fell open a little, and Toni continued, “I know it seems like a silly thing for me to say, but the last two years you’ve been with me has been life changing. I want you be able to get to know them, and hopefully love them too since they are your parents, but I don’t want you to forget me on the way.”
“We only know who her father is,” Toni said. She was about to say his name when Bruce said one first.
Thor grabbed Loki by the face, showed the trickster the city, and said,” Look at this! Look at what you have done! Do you think this madness will end with you?”
She then looked to Thor and said, “No hard feelings Point Break, you’ve got a pretty mean swing.” Thor looked over to the woman and gave a slight nod. Bruce watched the two; Toni knew him somehow, and Bruce was going to find out how. Toni walked over to the displays. “That man over there is playing Galaga! He thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury look at these?”
“Right. Well, point me in the direction to her, I’ll see if I can find out what’s wrong,” Dr. Cho said with a small smile.
“Well, jeez, if I knew that I woulda told ya! Just hurry!” April said, grabbing Nova’s arm and pulling her out of the bed. Nova hit the floor with a thud and groaned. “Oops sorry! Let’s go!”
“You know she’s adopted, she told you earlier I heard. She was dropped off on Earth as a baby and doesn’t know her biological parents personally.”
“You try to sound so heroic, making it seem as if you have something against me, but you don’t. You have nothing. You will all fall before me.”
Loki laughed, “Ah, home. Well I wouldn’t be welcomed there anymore. And I don’t have the Tesseract. I sent it somewhere where I do not know.”
“Oh no, I don’t need anyone taking her away from me. I just got her, I can’t lose her,” Toni replied. She then knocked on a door. “Nova, honey, I have my doctor friend here to see you.”
“What are you doing?” Steve asked. A man entered through the ramp. Steve moved towards Thor to try to stop him, but Thor hit him away. Steve crashed into Toni and landed on her with a grunt. Thor grabbed Loki by the neck and flew out the opening.
“Fine, I just go up a different way,” Nova huffed. She walked outside and started to use her magic to lift herself into the air. Just as she was getting ready to go up, Toni flew overhead.
“Don’t pay any attention to her Captain. She feeds off of attention just like her mother,” Fury said. “We were having and adult conversation, so you can go the hell away now.”
“Who said I didn’t?” Nova smiled mischievously. When the bunch came in through the door, Toni was behind Steve. When Nova saw Steve, she sent a little lightning his way to hit him. Toni saw what she was getting ready to do.
Loki shook her head a few times, “No mother. I just want this child out of me. Why is she not out of me yet?” Loki whined. Thor grabbed a hold of her hand with his.
“Does no one care what I think? And when did we start calling him Phil? His first name is Agent,” Toni said.
Nova loved her new life; she had people who loved her and wanted to take care of her. She loved Pepper, and Pepper adored her. Pepper would take Nova out for ice cream if she got all of her homework done, and Nova, Pepper, and Toni would occasionally watch movies if they had time.
“He’s tearing us apart. He tried to start with Barton and Selvig, but we got Barton back. He’s going to use you to get to her,” Steve commented.
On the bridge, Natasha, Steve, Maria, Thor and Bruce listened to Fury speak with Loki while the villain was in his chamber. Bruce was uneasy with his sudden realization, and he needed to speak to Fury about it, preferably alone and away from Toni. He wasn’t sure if he completely trusted the woman yet. After Fury left Loki, Bruce said, “Well, he really grows on you, doesn’t he?”
Nova bounced from area to area, trying to destroy any Chitauri and save people. As she was helping some people into a more secluded and secure hiding place, a voice said her name from the distance. Nova turned around to see Bruce on a little motorbike.
“Different?” Natasha asked. Bruce nodded. “Yeah, it is. But they are literally the same person. Let’s go.”
“Well, she saved herself, Toni. Maybe if you had made it just in time, she would’ve still made the force field. You never know,” Pepper replied.
“Get back to the Helicarrier and make sure Nova is hidden. Hurry I don’t know how fast this guy is,” Toni said.
I had a little fun with this chapter. I wasn't planning on cutting it off where I did, but it would have put this chapter at around 2,600 words had I not. Enjoy this chapter! :)
“I think I am more worried about Loki than I am for myself. What if Odin just doesn’t listen?” Nova said.
“Uh. Yes!” Nova said. She grabbed her toast and ran to the couch. Toni plopped down next to her and they began channel surfing.
“No thanks. I’ve read through my books, and I’m extremely bored. Can I just please help you find the Tesseract? Please?” the teen asked.
Toni began making her way back to where her suit storage was. She put her helmet back on. No one could see her cry that way, right?
Nova followed April out the room and down the stairs to the main floor study area. When they arrived, Nova noticed the woman her friend had been talking about; she was talking to Mother Rosalinda about Nova herself.
Okay, so like I mentioned in my last note on the previous chapter, I had to fix some dates. I didn't realize I put my first draft in until I was rereading it. So a recap: Nova was born in July of 1997. Also, thank you so much for the kudos! Please enjoy Chapter 3 of Home!
” Jarvis replied. Toni ran towards the light, and when she arrived, she saw a green dome encasing a scared looking Nova. The girl had her arms up and her eyes squeezed shut. Nova slowly opened her eyes and the force field was gone.
“We love you Nova. Please know that,” Thor said, giving Nova a kiss on her forehead. Loki sat up and did the same and cupped her daughter’s cheek.
“Good, good. Let’s see what we’ve got going here,” Toni said trough her suit. She examined the damage, and used her suit scanning the machinery. “Looks like I’m gonna have to get this super conducting cooling system back online before accessing the rotors, work on dislodging the debris. Cap, I need you to get to that engine control panel to tell me which relays are in overload position.”
Nova knew she wasn’t supposed to stay up late, but without Coulson or Natasha around to keep her company, she decided to explore the base, or, well, as much as she could. From the outside, it looked small, but on the inside was a different story. She was currently two levels down from where her room was, and in order to get there, she had to hack through some things. Little did Nova know, however, Nick Fury was following her, making sure she wasn’t getting into too much trouble. Hacking was a federal offense, but he figured he’d let her have a little fun before telling her it was time to go to bed.
“I’m sorry, they shot me down. Are you okay?” Steve asked removing his helmet. He moved closer to Toni. Toni looked up at him.
“It’s nice to meet you as well Nova,” Bruce said, shaking the teen’s hand. He looked at Natasha, “Uh, is having a kid here a good idea?”
“How come you’re here? I don’t want to sound rude or anything, I just don’t know why you’d come to an orphanage all the way in Brooklyn, New York. Don’t you live all the way over in Malibu, California?” Nova asked.
Toni was pushing the rotors faster and faster by the second. After what seemed like forever, the Helicarrier leveled off and the rotor began running by itself again.
“Sorry about that Stark. He’s been in a bad mood since you told him you told Nova about everything,” Coulson said standing from the table and collecting the folders.
Nova fought alongside Steve on the ground, using her powers as best as she could. She was getting tired; Nova had never used her powers this much for this amount of time.
“Thank you mother. I shall let Loki know in a few hours after she rests. You should probably go back before father gets suspicious,” Thor replied. Frigga nodded swiftly, kissed her son’s forehead, and said her goodbyes.
“Exactly, divide and conquer. He needs us gone to win, his one weakness, gone. He wants to beat us and wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience,” Toni said next.
“So... I’m just gonna take the jet to DC tonight...” Pepper said, backing up. “Nova’s gonna come with me, you have a lot of homework.”
“No, you took me for a purpose. What was it?” Loki asked. When Odin didn’t replied he yelled, “Tell me!”
“She went down to watch from outside. She should be coming back soon,” Pepper said. She gave Toni a hug. “I am so happy about this! Yay!”
“Oh my gosh!” was all Nova could get out before getting a glare from Rosalinda. The woman staring at her was the one and only Toni Stark.
“Oh my gosh! Are you Dr. Banner? I have always wanted to meet you!” Nova exclaimed. She stuck her hand out for a handshake. “Also, sorry Nat, I got bored.”
Then suddenly, there was a large explosion a few blocks down. Nova looked over in that direction; Toni must’ve been there. Instead of going back towards the entrance of the Expo, Nova curiously walked the other way.
“Stop. Stop with the ‘What ifs’. Your daughter is fine, and so are you. Did Coulson have anyone? Was he married?” Steve asked.
“You’re never going to catch them. You’ll always be chasing your tail while the team stays three steps ahead.”
Tony can’t help but smirk at that wonderfully painted image. Good. He liked getting beneath Ross’ skin. Hopefully, it would send the old bastard into an early retirement. Stark is perusing his closet as he speaks, “Glad I could make his day. I’m uh—flying to Bordeaux. Got a new assignment.”
“These are from Barnes?” Tony asked slowly, brow furrowing in confusion. But Bucky and Sam were an item, so— Tony spotted the bright red sticky note smooshed between layers of plastic, a much messier scrawl this time.
Ross, to his credit, doesn’t even flinch at the use of the dreaded nickname. “STRIKE Force is on another mission and won’t be available in the time span that the council wants this looked into. Vision is currently MIA, Rhodes is stationed here, with me, so tell me, genius, who does that leave?” The older man sneers.
Rogers cuts off the two way with a sigh. Whatever it was, he could handle it when it happened. Steve surreptitiously swipes at his face to activate the camera scrambler that the Wakandan’s had granted him and takes a deep breath before pushing through the doors. He greets the concierge politely and indicates he’d like to get a drink at the bar. So far, none of the other guests have recognized him or paid him any attention really. His phone is going off like crazy in his pocket, but he ignores it for now. Whatever it was, it could wait. This could be his only chance to catch a glimpse of Batroc. The concierge points him in the right direction and Rogers is stepping over the threshold of the room when he spots
you are, and two, can just waltz right in, all willy-nilly. I don’t even know what this is about, Steve. The last time we spoke was a half a year ago.”
If an arrangement of Rue and Bird’s-foot Trefoil ends up placed outside the door of Rogers’ shop, well… that was his business.
Stark just looks… perplexed. So, he’d what? Abandoned Pepper at the gala, thrown himself at Steve and then been put to bed? The migraine pounding at his head is definitely not just from all the drinks he’d had the night before. He doesn’t really know how to feel about any of this… so did Steve just not want to have sex with him because he was drunk? (It wasn’t an issue for most of the people Tony slept with if he was being honest) or was he uninterested in Tony over all?
Steve watches him for a moment. He could smell the alcohol on Tony’s breath even from where he was standing and the other seemed to sway just a fraction every so often. He knew if anyone could fake sobriety, it would be Tony.
It makes sense doesn’t it? With the both of them on the same case, they should combine their forces and have a better chance at catching the slippery fucker.
The only reason that Tony had flown out to speak with Rogers’ team at the RAFT, was the fact that the doctor who had been hired to speak to Barnes had been found dead in his hotel bathroom. Meaning this other guy had orchestrated a long play just to get close to the Winter Soldier. And despite the fact that Tony didn’t want to see him, didn’t want to speak to him after what happened in Germany and after what happened to Rhodey, the fact of the matter was, Tony still had Rogers pretty, curvy letters across his wrist and Rogers was possibly in danger.
“As a reminder, the medical examiner hadn’t determined it to be a suicide yet,” Steve settled on, fishing a cigarette and lighter out of his pocket. A questioning glance and a nod from Bruce later, there was a small flicker of flame and a puff of smoke leaving the blonde’s lips.
Steve considered his options here. On one hand, he and Stark butt heads constantly. Steve hated (read: secretly loved) the fact that Tony always had something snarky to say. The brunette was always poking fun at him, and Steve really couldn’t help the way that Tony knew just how to get under his skin. It was absolutely maddening. Buck called it the equivalent of pulling pig tails in grade school, though Steve wasn’t too inclined to believe him.  On the other hand, Steve found nearly everything about Tony ridiculously attractive. From the way the man dressed and carried himself, to the shape of those chocolate eyes, the fine slope of his nose and his lips. Tony was, well—beautiful. He’d secretly ended up on many pages of Steve’s sketchbook. But Stark flirts with everyone. Steve couldn’t really believe that there was any genuine interest there. Still—
century. He’s still a few blocks out of the way, but at the very least he has a destination now. The Ex-Captain has to keep reminding himself that this was a recon mission only. He couldn’t afford to confront Batroc on his own and lose him again. Of course, there weren’t distractions of other mission objectives or other teammates this time either but, he’d promised the others that he wouldn’t make a move. It was still up in the air if he were being honest.
Zemo looks much grimmer for a moment, dark emotions flashing on his face for a brief moment before he makes a quiet clicking sound. “I lost everyone. And so will you.”
Did he have a clue on how he was going to get there when he was wanted in basically every country around the globe? No, not really, but it didn’t matter either way. He would find a way around the problem, he always did.
Steely eyes narrow. God, he loved Steve, but the man could be an absolute idiot sometimes. “Steve, you’re his
“I remember telling Stark about my mark but uh, I—“ there was something going on there. His memory felt fuzzy or jumbled, like losing the signal on an old television and when the signal finally came back, it was the memory of his most recent unfreezing. Why couldn’t he remember?
Tony threw himself into work. He spent his time with Rhodes, accompanying him to all his physical therapy sessions when he wasn’t working on perfecting the braces he’d built. He made improvements on his suits. Finally got around to the nanotechnology he’d been wanting to use. And somewhere along the line, Rogers had deemed it necessary to send him a sorry ass excuse for an apology.
“Tony, you dick, you missed the funeral!” An angry Natasha huffed into the cold, a puff of steam blowing through her lips as she spoke. She could hear everyone else follow behind her as she stalked up to her cousin, eyes flaring and gloved hands clenched into fists.
Tony’s blinking stupidly at the familiar set of car keys dangling from those thick fingers and for a split second, he’s too distracted by them to react. Steve must’ve swiped them when pushing through the door.
“Rain check. Yup.” Tony repeats stupidly, earning a chuckle from Steve and a peck, this one much closer to the one he’d been expecting.
Tony looked around in a panic. There was no sign of Steve. Steve’s health, when put to the test like this, was fragile at best. If whatever they had slipped into the coffees had been enough to put Tony under in about three minutes flat, what would it do to Steve? Worry filled his every pore and he let out a scream of frustration and rage.
“That is probably the best name for a boy you have found Thor. Now, let us look at names for girls.”
“I have a friend who can see all. He would be able to tell you how Lady Stark is doing. You will be meeting him when we arrive in Asgard. He already knows you are coming,” Thor said.
“Yeah well so is this!” Toni shouted. She groaned and paced to the other side of the room. “You, Point Break, are the father to my
“You don’t have to do this,” Nova said. Thor hit the container with his hammer, and while it cracked the glass, it also moved the container down a little. Loki laughed viciously.
“Coulson was nagging me most of the time till he got sent off to New Mexico or somewhere,” Toni huffed.
“I was told they scrapped it. I wasn’t eligible for it anyway. Too self-obsessed, volatile. Don’t play well with others,” Toni said, arms crossed and head tilted. Nova laughed,
“Hey, hey, hey. Everything's gonna be alright. Jarvis what the hell are you talking about?” Toni asked, trying to calm Nova down. Pepper stood in the corner, a hand over her mouth; Dr, Cho and her assistant shared a brief look before her assistant made her leave.
Then it happened: Nova was sitting in a hotel room in Monaco watching the Monaco Grand Prix on television. Everything seemed fine until Toni decided she would drive the Stark Industries race car. Just minutes later, a man came out with electrified whips.
“I just solved something that’s been eating me alive for the past few years. That’s why Nova was with Thor, she was going to confront Loki. That little shit,” Toni rubbed her face a little.
“He has an army called the Chitauri, they are not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will lead him to victory, so he can have, I assume, the Tesseract in return,” Thor said with his arms crossed.
“Would you be able to help me carry my books out?” Nova asked. She had actually picked out several books. To read over the next few days.
“Don’t worry about that stuff, my friends here are gonna make sure to grab it all,” Natalie said. A few men entered the room and started gathering everything that was Nova’s and Toni’s.
Thor sternly looked at his father and spoke once more, “Father, please, I need to know. How did you find this out; did someone tell you?”
Natalie stopped and turned to look at Nova, “I am from Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, but we are also known as S.H.I.E.L.D. My real name is Natasha. I am trying to help your mom out, and to do that, I need to get you to a protected area. I know it is a lot to process right now, but i need you to trust me okay?”
“She sure is. We can meet her back at the Helicarrier. You’d best sit this one out. Thor is basically a god,” Natasha replied.
“Love you too-” Toni started saying before Nova cut the call off. Toni sighed. “She’s staying at a friend’s house for a few days.”
“I quit; I’m resigning. That’s it,” Pepper sighed. “And Nova, oh my god! You can’t just run into the face of danger! I turned around and you were gone! What the hell!”
” Jarvis said. A small device came out from the ceiling and scanned the necklace. Nova looked at Toni and cocked her head a little. “
“Hey, she’s just a kid give her a damn break. It isn’t like I can teach her how to use her magic. You saw exactly what I saw. I’m sure you can start building more on that empty folder,” Toni said, helping Nova to her feet.
“We both know that isn’t true. I’ll ask again but this time,” Nova said; she closed her eyes and transformed herself. She opened her eyes back up, her skin blue and eyes blood red. “Where. Is. My. Mother?”
“I wasn’t going to tell you, but he told me I needed to. I was going to surprise you when you got back,” Toni said.
“Hey, don’t talk like that. We will figure this out. Do you remember anything from when you were unconscious?” Toni asked. She looked back to see if Pepper was still there, but she must have slipped out quietly.
“Well, of course, I have heard of you! I have read so many articles about you!” Nova exclaimed. Rosalinda made a cough noise. Nova quieted down a little and looked back down.
“Avengers? What’s that?” Nova asked. She had done snooping before but never saw anything with ‘Avengers’ written on it.
“Thor, it was Tyr. He overheard you and Loki speaking in the halls about it. Your father has no idea that I know about this; you can never repeat what I just told you to anyone other than Loki,” Frigga said. She could see the anger in her son’s eyes, but Thor surprisingly did not say much.
Toni knew she was going to get reamed for it, but she flew down the hallways anyway. She couldn’t do much more damage than there already was.
” Toni’s voice came through Natasha’s com. She laughed as the message ‘PA SYSTEMS OVERRIDE’ came up on the screen. Shoot to Thrill by AC/DC began playing for everyone to hear as Toni came into view. She shot a repulsor blast at Loki and landed in front of him.
She then saw the War Machine make its way to the front of the building. Rhodey picked someone up, Nova was assuming Pepper, when she heard an ominous beeping noise. She looked around to see the Hammer drones blinking red. Nova’s eyes widened and she started backing up. She could hear the roar of Toni’s suit coming closer, but it was already too late. The Hammer drones blew up in an instant, and Toni wasn’t fast enough.
“May I speak to Nova privately, Ma’am?” Toni asked, standing up a little straighter; she was shorter than Rosalinda but was much more intimidating.
While Toni was getting ready to start clearing the debris, Steve stood watch by the red lever. Suddenly, two of Loki’s pawns engaged towards Steve. One threw a grenade in, but Steve noticed it in time and hit it away. When he landed, Steve began to fight the two men and threw one off the Helicarrier. And jumped back up towards the catwalk and began firing a machine gun. Then, again suddenly, the Helicarrier began falling faster; engine one was failing and completely offline.
“Captain, that’s my secret. I’m always angry,” Bruce responded. As he turned back around, Bruce morphed into the Hulk, and took down the Leviathan. Toni blasted a small weak spot on the alien creature, blowing it ff to the side. The rest of the Chitauri watched from above, scared from what they had just seen.
Toni walked down the landing pad, her armor coming off as she walked closer to the door. She stretched a little as the remaining armor was finally gone.
“Nova is right. If we don’t leave soon, we will be late Ms. Potts,” Natasha said, walking up next to Nova. Nova gave a little wave to Natasha, and she got a wink back as a response.
“Yep, pretty much. I wasn’t supposed to have these powers until I was sixteen but something happened, so I got them early,” Nova said.
“Let’s do a head count! A couple of master assassins,” Toni started. Loki turned, still listening. Toni slipped on her bracelets while he had his back turned, “A man with incredible anger management issues; a breathtakingly handsome super soldier, a living legend, who kind of lives up to that legend; your
Nova slipped away from the guards and began making her way towards Loki. She was going to confront him to find out what was going on.  The Helicarrier jerked, and someone announced that engine one was failing, so Nova started running before she was too late. When she arrived to where his cell was, she saw the door was opening to the cell.
“Well I did all the brute work. And the whole security thing is your fault, I’m just gonna say it straight out,” Toni shrugged and walked in a different direction, probably so Pepper wouldn’t hit her.
“Aw, you could what Nicky?” Toni stalked in quietly, smirk on her face. Nova stood next to her giggling.
“It sounds so weird when you say that. I’m just not used to it. I think a part of me can’t believe it,” Toni said, taking Nova’s hand.
“Nova get out of here! Go! Go now!” Natasha said, swatting the teen away. Nova used her magic to move a beam off of Natasha’s leg.
“She seems like a good kid. I know I didn’t know her before, but I’m sure you’ve helped her,” Steve replied.
Still looking, Loki responded, “I’m not overly fond of what follows.” With that, a thud came from the top of the Quinjet. Toni and Steve looked up. Loki slinked back in his seat; Thor was there to retrieve him. Steve grabbed his helmet and put it back on, ready for anything; Toni opened the ramp.
“Ooo, handsome man, calling my name. I’ll be back,” Toni said, walking away from Thor and Nova. Bruce took Toni’s spot.
“This thing in my chest is the only thing keeping me alive. There are shards of metal inching towards my heart, and this is stopping them from reaching my heart,” Toni replied.
“I will be back,” Toni said to the two she was leaving behind. While Toni was walking out, she prepared to put a listening device somewhere hidden, but Nova saw her reach for it.
“Oh, it’s been gone for a while. I don’t really know what happened, I just remember being. Surrounded by robots that were about to explode. Toni wasn’t able to get to me fast enough, but the next thing I knew, I was surrounded by a green forcefield. A few days later, I blacked out and lost control, and when I calmed down, my necklace was broken. I’m assuming that’s why I can do all this stuff,” Nova replied.
“Why does everything have to be so complicated, Jesus,” Toni said to herself. She had the rest of the day to herself as Pepper was off handling business with the company and Nova was at school.
!” Loki roared. He started to walk away from Thor. “I have seen places you never would have dreamed of Thor. I have grown since my exile. I have seen the
“Oh come on why can’t we just let him let off a little steam?” Toni asked putting her hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve wacked it off.
“You do not know how much I regret not doing so. We were not supposed to see you after the birth, but my mother, your grandmother, let us without my father knowing. I have thought of you every day since, and I know Loki has as well. Since that day, he has closed himself off from me, from everyone,” Thor said sadly. Nova didn’t know what to say; she wanted to be angry but wasn’t.
“Of course, right this way,” Toni said as she began walking down the hall. “There’s one more thing, these bruises and marks she’s getting, they always seem to disappear within a few hours to just less than a day.”
“Why weren’t you at the funeral?” He asked skeptically, settling on doing something actually useful. Sure, he doubted Tony would answer, but on the off chance, he wanted to try.
“Nice doorbell you got there,” Steve warily remarked, eyes instinctively scanning the area. Floor to ceiling windows, open areas, minimalist furniture. Wide and open and almost ironic for someone who was definitely hiding his fair share of secrets.
“Tony, please.” Stark interrupted, if only to watch the way Steve’s stupid, marble sculpted jaw flexes.
The party all headed in the same direction and dread immediately settled in the pit of Tony’s stomach. How in the actual hell did Pepper expect him to behave all evening when he had to be surrounded by those two boneheads?
“let Rogers go free. Not even an attempt to bring him or any of the other Rogues in. There wasn’t anything on him or your encounter with him in your reports or debriefing either.” The older male rounds the desk, palms face down on the smooth surface as he leans towards Stark. The engineer’s eyes find the magazine, a tabloid really. On the cover is a high-resolution photograph of the moment that Tony had spotted Batroc (or at the very least someone who could have been the man’s double), the brunette leaning intimately into a blonde’ space. The headline reads:
Tony scrambles and catches the damned thing on the very last ring. For a moment he’s stunned silent, too scared to speak if there truly was bad news on the other line.
Since Siberia? But that was almost two years ago according to Steve and Shuri. That couldn’t be right. Why would he be away from Tony for so long? Well, cryo aside. “Since Siberia…? Tony’s my—
Tony to his credit, only smirked. Darn, looks like the cat was out of the bag, though who was he really kidding? Someone with a name as big as him could never keep it under wraps for long.
“Tony. Hi.” Rogers thrusted the slightly wilting, saran-wrapped bouquet at the brunette. “Buck said to give these to you. He said you would know what they mean, because honestly, I have no idea what the hell is going on here.”
“Betcha you’ll say my name before I say yours.” Stark taunted. “Get on your back, soldier and I’ll show you just how well I work in the bedroom.” He pushed uselessly against Steve’s chest, huffing with aroused annoyance that Steve doesn’t even budge a little, only drawing out a rumble of laughter.
Some kind of closure that would allow him to forget Rogers and Barnes all together and allow him to move on. Leave it to Steve Rogers to always know where to hit him.
Now Tony might be drunk, but he still gets the meaning. The defiant look melts into something else entirely.
” Tony smirked, using the middle name JARVIS had so helpfully supplied during the very brief peek he’d had into the blonde’s personal file. The AI was currently working into looking at more classified stuff.
Tony’s shaking his head and looking much more miserable than Steve has ever seen him and it makes his chest ache in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time. Rogers reaches out to tilt his chin up, fighting to catch the attention of those once warm, honey eyes that’d haunted his dreams since the day he limped away with Bucky in his arms. Even if he couldn’t stay, even if they couldn’t go back to what they had before, he just wanted to make sure that Tony was alright.
