appreciate her hair being pulled. After his playtime, Peter takes another nap to awake to another bottle and a diaper change.
“Who is it?” he asks the AI. At first, speaking to the robot was weird and uncomfortable but over time, Steve adjusted to it. Their interactions became more plentiful and Steve communicates with J.A.R.V.I.S. as if he is just another person living in the house with them.
Heather comes back and views Tony holding Peter. “Well, Peter ate so he’s probably too awake to take a nap. That happens sometimes. I’ll take Peter to Sandra. She’ll get him ready and you guys can do the last bit of paperwork in the lobby. Then you can take him home today.”
“Oh, I’m sorry Mr. Stark,” she quickly apologies having caught onto his physical distress.
“You really think we wouldn’t do something,” Pepper says with a smug grin. Her pink dusted cheeks are pulled back with dimples as her pearly white teeth shine through. Behind the beautiful woman, a group of their close friends is around with drinks -- most likely champagne -- in their hands. Decorations are strung all around the room with little aesthetic or effort to them.
“That’ll be okay,” Tony answers quickly with a chill to his voice despite secretly freaking out about holding a baby. It’s like holding parts of machinery except a baby is just a little lighter and can’t be dropped a dozen times without consequences.
The next morning it’s evident that the couple didn’t get as much rest as the others. Natasha cracks a joke as Steve is a usually chipper man in the mornings and his current behavior is very out of character. Bruce takes initiative by feeding the baby some mashed fruits and the two eat their own makeshift breakfast: toaster waffles.
“Yeah, I think so too,” Steve answers honestly. “Do you want to hold him?”
“Yes, we know.” Steve is the one who answers. He and Tony had done extensive research when they had seriously considered adopting. The number of hours that Tony had spent climbing out of bed in the middle of the night to fervently search the internet for even the glimmer of hope in a family was countless.
place. Though the man never stated his reason for doing so aloud, Tony is fairly certain Steve used to come here before he went under the ice. The building is rather old and surprisingly stands a few stories tall with a slight lean, most likely due to the instability of the entire foundation. The wood paneling has aged a great deal and is in need of a new coat of paint or replacements. It wouldn't be a stretch to guess the connections with the super soldier from WWII since Steve had lived near this part of the city and was alive around the time it was established.
“Yes. I know you’ll be a great father,” Steve Rogers responds. The man’s golden hair lights up in the sun and eyes as blue as the ocean practically melts the other’s heart once more. A lopsided smile gives Tony the mental image of a golden retriever.
“No, that’s all, but I am a little upset that you didn’t invite me to the baby shower. I even got the kid a little something,” Fury says while walking back to the elevator, a smirk definitely on his lips. Steve gives him a dubious look.
Heather confirms his thought by putting a manicured finger in front of her lips in a shushing manner. She opens one of the white wooden doors with a label in English and Braille that states ‘Baby Room #3’ to reveal a big room filled with baby cribs all painted in soft, pastel colors.
“How old is he again?” Clint butts in, finding himself in the group by Tony as well. He kneels by Pepper and the two look related. However, if someone were to study them, they would find the differences: Pepper’s hair is a shade darker and Clint’s borders on platinum blonde, the woman has green eyes and the man has dark blue eyes, and the shape of their faces don’t align in any familiar resemblance.
“Do you not believe me?” Nick laughs and nods to Maria for, presumably, the gift. The woman presents a manila envelope that she’s been holding the entire time with a polite smile.
The elevator makes a soft ding as it announces the arrival of the special government operatives. The well-experienced pair steps onto the floor to meet with Steve. The two are people that Steve has met on multiple occasions for business. Fury is a brooding man dressed in all black. It is hard to tell if the clothing choice is for style only or for being inconspicuous. His one good eye is trained on the man and his son. The other eye permanently wounded and covered with an eye patch. The woman, Maria, hangs back. She’s dressed in a nice black suit consisting of matching dress pants and a blazer buttoned over a white button-up blouse.
“Fine,” the woman scoffs in return before swiftly making a turn to leave. Her heels sending reverberations down the hall as she leaves. Steve questions how someone working in with children could be so rude.
Tony opens the door to the back seat of the car, tosses the box inside, and moves for Steve to place Peter in the car seat that they bought beforehand. Actually, Natasha bought it with Clint when the two had heard they were going to adopt and bring the baby home today. In fact, when each of their fellow superhero teammates had heard of the final decision of adoption they promised to offer a gift of sorts. The nerdy scientist, Bruce, bought clothes that could be easily returned if sizes were incorrect; Clint, an archer with a love for the color purple, had said he knew a great place for toys and could cut a deal; the Russian assassin, Natasha, had promised to buy a few bottles and pacifiers when she learned that no one had thought to buy some; and Thor the God of Thunder was going to bring a weapon from Asgard but had been talked out of it. Either way, the god promised to bring something worthy for the boy when he was of an appropriate age to accept the gift, whatever it may be.
Clint hums and starts to engage with the baby more. They barely acknowledge Steve who passes through to the kitchen with a disheveled Tony grumbling about coffee and possibly liquor. He barely registers the others but it is particularly fine since the two on the couch returns the same amount of care.
Sandra, on the other hand, seems a little less enthusiastic about this part of her job. She walks over to briefly thrust Peter into Tony’s arms before taking several steps away from the couple and glare with hateful eyes. The billionaire’s arms twitch in the confrontation of accepting Peter or fighting back with words and exaggerated hand gestures. Of course, Tony held his son with care but that didn’t stop the feeling akin to hate that stemmed from how rude that woman was in
The couple trail after Heather again for a final time to her tall desk in the lobby. Steve takes the papers and the two began working on it together while sharing a small writing space provided by the tables. All together, it doesn’t take too long and in an hour the paperwork is done, signed, and officiated. Everything else can be done at a later time or by someone working under Tony.
The baby makes no noise when he is moved to another’s arms. The billionaire tries to take initiative in arousing the baby similar to Steve, as of to not be shown up, by pulling out a small object from his pocket and giving it to Peter. Steve, just barely grasping the purpose of his husband’s inventions, briefly questions if it’s safe for the baby to have. Regardless, Peter takes the object into his little hands and begins to chew on it without hesitation.
“Let them up,” he tells the computer.
“Sandra,” Heather warns with a pinched expression and tight voice. “Can you get Peter’s box, please?”
Steve lightly grabs for Tony’s hand under the desk and away from the view of the receptionist. Tony can tell almost instantly that the taller and usually sturdier man is slightly upset. He wonders if her dream job was to try her hardest in providing children with homes or if this is just a way to make ends meet. Either way, Tony won’t ask for fear of being too personal and intrusive.
The couple can hear a quiet chatter radiating from each colorful door they pass when going through the large doors that lead to the back rooms that hold the majority of the children. Steve smiles sadly, wishing he could adopt all of them or at least make sure they got the families they deserve. Tony makes a mental note to offer more donations and funds for not just this orphanage but for the rest in the city, or maybe ones all over the country. They take the stairs -- the building is too old to have an elevator installed as Heather mentions -- to the second floor and it’s much quieter than the first.
“Things didn’t go so well, I take it?”
“The only way we are going to fix this, or move on from it...is if we fix this.” A finger gestured between them. “Us.”
“Captain Rogers?” F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s voice echoed through the room.
"Um, just you," Clint clarified.
She weighed almost a hundred pounds less than Steve did; he didn't even have to adjust the armor's power output to compensate.
Wanda straightened, eyes narrowing. "He's not my father. He's never been my father, and I should have known better than to go back to him. Lashing out like that made me feel in control, but I wasn't really. He was just using me, the way he did before. And I let him. Again."
Pounding Atlas into the ground had been deeply satisfying, though. Payback, Hank supposed, for the time he, the Man-Ape, and Ultron had trashed the West Coast Avengers' headquarters. Hank had been basically useless, then, letting Tony fight the three of them on his own until reinforcements showed up.
The others immediately pulled their masks off, Jan returning to full size after she did so.
Steve shrugged. "Some women are very tall."
ooOOoo
The band was playing a waltz, for which Tony was grateful - anything more athletic would have put him at serious risk of a twisted ankle, not to mention the fact that trying to remember to let Rhodey lead was difficult enough even at a slow tempo.
Things would have made more sense if he had been, but there had been no alcohol involved. "No." Clint shook his head. "I just don't remember. The whole thing's kind of like a dream, like it happened to somebody else."
Tony pushed himself up on one elbow, the sheet sliding further down his naked torso to pool at his hips. "If you do that,
"Do that," Tony ordered.  "And see if... no, if their communicators aren't showing up, Hank's Ant-Man helmet will be blocked as well.  Doom probably wouldn't let him keep it anyway."  Hank's helmet had a unique electronic signature, easy to track if you knew what to look for, but meaningless electronic noise if you didn't.
It had been Chthon. It hadn't been him. It hadn't been her. He wasn't actually the kind of man that would rape a woman, and she didn't hate him for it, and he hadn't hurt her.
Clint swore, glaring at Hank from behind his hand. "You didn't pull that last punch."
Tony was still smirking with satisfaction when the waiter came to take their orders. He might not have Steve forever, but as long as he did, he was going to enjoy him. At least they seemed to have put the disaster with his stolen armor behind them, so when things eventually fell apart, they could still be friends.
It had been a long time, Steve reflected, since he'd allowed himself a day off from being a superhero, to just go and do something normal. It had been even longer since he'd been able to do that with Tony.
That might be true, but Hank still knew significantly more about computers than Clint. He was trying to think of the most insulting way possible to point this out when Jan stepped forward and fluttered her eyelashes at the nearest camera.
Maybe that wouldn't be a bad thing.
"Pick you up again?" Steve said slowly. He really didn't like where it sounded like this was going.
Jan returned to full size just before she landed, putting herself between the Mercedes owner and the driver — now struggling futilely in Carol's grasp. "Has anyone called the police yet, or do I need to?" she asked. This was ridiculous — traffic accidents were not supposed to be the kind of thing superheroes dealt with — but they'd been right there, and jumping in had been instinctive.
The entire side of his face throbbed, and Sin's voice was patchy and far away, but he wasn't about to let her get the last word.  "Do I look like I'm begging?"
"You didn't."
"Rogers." Her lips twisted into a smirk that held no trace of her usual cheerful, little girl grin. Steve had had always imagined that Sin would be less disturbing without that eerily bubbly façade, but this wasn't much better. "I might have known Fury would call in America's attack dog," she sneered, the words dripping contempt. "How is your little sidekick doing these days?"
he knew better than to even try. She known, all along, that there had been something wrong with him, but it hadn't really penetrated until he'd already been arrested, after Egghead had tricked him into helping the supervillain with his latest scheme. She'd been too hurt, too angry, and the way Hank had acted hadn't made any
"Sir, we need you to go outside and tell the police and firemen that they can start coming in," Steve told the building manager. "We've determined that the attack is chemical rather than biological, but they're still going to need breathing gear."
Steve stared at him, looking bemused.
"Did you?" Tony repeated, leaning forward and letting a little more of his weight press against Steve's throat. It made his hips shift in interesting ways.
Tony hadn't destroyed it. He'd kept it, all of it.
The Doom standing farthest to the right laughed, his mask making the sound hollow.
Grabbing him by the wrist, yanking him forward, and throwing him over Steve's hip and onto the mat was as easy as breathing. And also, Steve thought with a wince, as Tony climbed to his feet again, not exactly pulling his punches.
"No," Cap said. "Just a restaurant. They were meeting with a reporter. I think it was just bad luck."
It shouldn't have been funny, had actually been excruciatingly embarrassing to witness at the time, especially the raw, open pain on Hank's face when he had walked in on the two of them, but the memory of Steve's appalled and exasperated expression when he'd chewed Clint out...
Carol snorted. "You know how Tony is. Asking him would be a waste of time, since he'd never actually say anything if something was wrong. And I can’t very well ask Steve."
Then the black, angular lines of the seals had formed on her skin – on her hands, on the back of her neck – and Chthon's presence had ceased battering at the frayed edges of the mental walls she'd thrown up against him as abruptly as a candle being blown out. Now, Strange seemed like an ordinary man, no more or less appealing than any other, and the ceaseless whispering that had echoed through her skull for longer than she could remember was finally silent.
, make his point for him.
"And it
There was flare of light, and then the smell of smoke filled the air and there was a large, round hole in the left-hand door.
Ten minutes later, he'd hit the mat three more times, and when he wobbled getting back up the third time, Steve declared practice over with.
Rhodey hesitated for a second, glancing at Tony, an unreadable expression on his face. Then he left.
“Do it,” Steve said, because now that the possibility had been suggested, he couldn’t stand not knowing.
It was openmouthed, all teeth and tongue and desperation, Tony's hands gripping his shoulders so tightly that it hurt. He'd always wondered what kissing Tony would be like, mostly in terms of wondering what the moustache and goatee would feel like against his face. It turned out that kissing Tony was a lot like sparring with him - both of them gave it their all and Steve forgot, once again, to hold back.
Jan started, turning toward the door, and Hank opened his eyes, sitting up a little.
"There definitely isn't any space in mine," he said. "No child deserves the kind of disaster I'd be as a parent." Not to mention that alcoholism could be inherited. His DNA might be a ticking timebomb, for all he knew.
The thump of a fist knocking against his door actually made Steve jump a little. "What is it?" he asked, rising to open the door and desperately hoping that he wouldn't find Tony on the other side of it.
"With pleasure." A ghostly feminine form blurred into being in the window before him, uncomfortably close to his own reflection.
"Whatever Doom's got in mind for us will probably make Don's blood eagle look mild.  It's probably going to be so gruesome and excruciatingly painful that a quick death would be a mercy."
The green and yellow fabric of her cloak made the colors around her seem dull, and her golden helmet blazed like fire in the natural light that flooded the three-story-high room, courtesy of the immense windows. If it came to a fight, the falling glass from shattering windows alone could be potentially lethal.
The oppressive atmosphere worsened as Strange drew closer to the cathedral. When he laid his hand on the door, the heavy wood and metal seemed to hum, the mystical vibrations sending a dull ache through damaged nerves and poorly knit bones.
"I hate my life," Tony muttered.
She had clearly been spending too much time around Hank lately, if she was starting to come up with her own paranoid worries; with matters on the team as they stood, Hank was spending a lot of time hiding in the Tower's lab, and it was never good when Hank spent days in a lab completely unsupervised. He forgot to shower, for one thing.
J.J. Jameson would throw a screaming temper tantrum, but Steve wouldn't have to be the one to listen to it, so at the moment, he couldn't bring himself to care.
"Begone," he hissed, through gritted teeth, ignoring the assault. "I command you!"
Was that why the baker had smiled at her? Why so many of the men she passed on the street nodded at her? Wanda hugged the loaf of bread against her chest and walked faster.
Clint blinked, and turned to look at her. "You've talked to him on the phone, haven't you? Why are you asking me?"
Now he just had to grow some balls and stop lurking in the hallway.
"You know you'll enjoy it," Steve said. He was smiling, beneath his mask, and sounded both fond and faintly amused. He and Tony had clearly resolved their differences, or at least put them aside long enough to be friends again.
In the armor, as he'd demonstrated more than once since returning to New York, that didn't matter, but he couldn't always rely on the armor.
Tony’s eyes were closed, his breath coming in small, shallow pants, but he flinched visibly when Steve put pressure on the wound.
Steve rushed him, moving too quickly for Tony's eyes to follow, even with a computer in his head. The floor slammed up to meet him again, and this time, he just lay there for a moment, his eye closed, Steve's knee a hard weight against his sternum.
He only just managed to dodge. Tony might have held back the first few times they had begun doing this again, and possibly once or twice after the incident at the Meridian, but he had been giving today's practice his all; his skin felt slick with sweat, and he could hear his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
"No argument there," Jan said. "I try to stay as far away from politicians as possible."
"Hey, we saved the book," Clint said, crouching down to examine the limp form of the man Steve had disarmed and knocked down. "And Sin's the only one who got — damn it, this guy's dead."
"Yes," Tony said grimly. "I remember." The clone of Thor had been skin-crawlingly wrong. Tony had expected it to be familiar in some way, to be essentially the same man as the friend he had lost, albeit with no memories of its own. Deep down, some stupid, irrational part of him had hoped that the clone would open his eyes and be
Moving automatically, she sprang forward and planted one foot on Loki's cloak, pinning it to the ground with her weight, and kicked at the dagger in Loki's hand.  The knife went skidding across the street, and Wong snatched it up, immediately turning to slam the blade into the joint of Doombot's shoulder.  It sliced through the metal as if it were cheap tin, as easily as Wolverine's claws.
"I'm allowed to not get avant garde art," Tony said, gesturing expansively at the museum around them with the arm that wasn't wrapped around Steve's waist. "I'm just an engineer. You're supposed to be sensitive and artistic."
She landed in a crouch, the shock of the impact jolting all the way up her legs and stinging the soles of her feet.  It was a good thing this costume had flat-soled boots instead of heels, or she would have gone sprawling across the pavement.
The arrow caught in one of the joints of Doom's armor, the shield bounced off Strange's magical bindings — they were translucent, like glowing smoke, surely it should have passed through them — and then they were on Doom.
The floor beneath Carol vibrated slightly as a twenty-foot-tall Jan, propping up the West side of the building from the outside, turned her head to the side and coughed into her upper arm.
"Is it a rule that all the questions in this game have to be about sex?" Steve asked, knowing he probably sounded ridiculously plaintive.
, she was all right.
"Ew."  He didn't have to be able to see Jan's expression to know she was wrinkling her nose.
Privately, Jan suspected that if it weren't for the Extremis, Tony would probably benefit from a prescription for anti-depressants. That, or therapy. He'd been barely functional during the endless three months when Steve had been dead and Registration and the Initiative had been in full force, though he'd hidden it well. And it hadn't been that long since Rumiko Fujikawa's death. Two dead lovers in as many years would have screwed up even someone who didn't have Tony's history with depression and self-destructive behavior.
Thor turned the lights off on his way out.
tripped over my shield."
Tony flinched, his face drawn tight with pain, and then his eyes opened.  “…we win?”
"He says his head hurts," Sharon translated. She put one hand on the side of Barnes's face, and swore. "James, you're-"
And it wasn't like Clint not to have an opinion on a decision as important as this, usually a loud opinion.
“We have to stop calling him that.  One of us is going to accidentally say it in front of him someday.”
that?" he snapped. "Do you think Fury would have made a move in the first place if he didn't have his ass covered?" He drew in a long, slightly shaky breath, and added, quietly, "They were using my designs in weapons, Steve."
He knew it wasn't going to work, knew Tony had to have changed his access codes during the Registration fight, but even trying something useless was better than doing nothing. "Armor override Steve Rogers," he said, the words hurting his throat. "Code 34-44-54-64."
Hank was there as well, with Tony's briefcase in one hand, saving him the extra minute fetching it from the monitor room would have taken; they really had been listening at the keyhole.
If he’d thought about it beforehand, Clint wouldn’t have moved, would have kept his hands to himself, but Wanda looked so miserable for a moment, and before he knew it, he’d shoved himself upright and leaned over to pull her into a hug.
Tony's suit was perfectly pressed, and his hair was neat, mainly because Jan had whacked his hand down whenever he'd tried to reach up and mess with it, but there were circles under his eyes again.
The world vanished in a searing flash of light. Sin hit the floor, elbows cracking painfully against concrete, and ripped her goggles off. Her eyes were watering, brightly colored sparks fuzzing across her vision.
Cap put one hand on his shoulder. "Thank you."
"Looks like I finally got you into my bedroom. Whatever would Clint say?"
"I thought you looked very pretty," Steve said sweetly, smirking down at Tony. Now that Tony was no longer actually
She was sitting on the floor a few feet away from Clint, and when she bent her head to look at the cards, he had a perfect view of the tattoo at the base of her neck. It was weirdly captivating, drawing the eye from the knobs of her spine up to the edge of her hairline.
Tony smiled back, but only for a moment. "Even you can't keep things from happening just by willing them not to. I've screwed up before. I'll do it again. And next time, it might not be as relatively harmless as forgetting that someone might have a camera the Extremis can't detect."
"And the fact that working on it makes it easier for you to hide from Thor has nothing to do with it?"
Tony input the code to unseal the door and immediately found himself face to face with Steve. At least he was face to face with him, and not nose-to-chest anymore. This was going to be hard enough without Steve having that psychological advantage.
"I wouldn't know," Wanda said wryly, and Clint felt a moment of intense gratitude that nothing that left permanent scars or damage had happened to her, that no one had hurt her that badly. And also, selfishly, that he himself had never been under long-term mind control.
He went over to her, not needing to ask Tony to follow him. Sam met them halfway there, his eyes going from Steve to Wanda in a silent question.
He reached up, brushing Loki's free hand aside, and removed the mask himself.
No, claiming to be sick wouldn't work. Everyone would assume "sick" was a euphemism for "drunk." It didn't matter that his heart surgery was public knowledge; he'd forfeited the benefit of the doubt with his recent behavior, and any failure to appear at a scheduled meeting would only strengthen the prevailing opinion in the business world that he was unreliable.
Wanda raised an eyebrow. "Is there anyone in the entire superhuman community who doesn't hate us now?"
Cap went red.  Even his
The main nurses' station was nearly deserted, probably because of all the poisoned people, but he managed to catch a blonde woman with a clipboard just as she was leaving. "Excuse me, ma'am, could you tell me where Tony Stark and the other Avengers are?"
"My father was alive," Tony interrupted. "I know." Shooter had been on the board for nearly two decades, and had disliked Tony ever since his father had first brought him in to a board meeting, intent on shaming his board members by proving that a six year old had a better grasp of the basic principles of engineering than they did. Howard Stark had never expressed anything like pride in his son, not verbally, anyway, but the fact that he'd been convinced that his six year old son really was more intelligent than an entire boardroom full of adults had to count for something. "We've been producing better designs, better technology, since then, though," Tony said, doing his level best to sound positive, confident. "Everyone acknowledges that. Innovation is what this company is known for. You can't innovate and be 'safe.' Safety in this field is a death sentence."
Tony blinked. "I'm still- Of course. You have a full line-up here already, Cap. I can just... stay out of your hair."
Tony flinched, and closed his eyes, scooting back several inches so that he was sitting up against the back of the bed. "I didn't mean to," he whispered, voice hoarse. "I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to."
Chthon could have done anything to her, during the long year when Tony had preferred to ignore her existence because he didn't want to deal with it. Used her to kill, warping her powers and will into a weapon the way he had on M-Day. Influenced her thoughts, planted suggestions and commands in her brain...
Jan shook her head. "I wasn't drinking for that. I was drinking for the picture they took when I was dating the bass guitarist from Urban Camouflage."*
MoMA had the same high ceilings, white walls, and pale floors that every modern museum seemed to have. Tony, back in the same masculine business attire he always wore and looking as if slinky black dresses, heels, and make-up were something that had never crossed his mind, was staring around the lobby with a bemused expression. "You know," he said, "I think this is the first time in five years that I've been here during normal visiting hours. I usually come here for fund raisers."
He hadn't sent her a decent bit of info in weeks, before last night's message. If this didn't pan out, she might kill him just on principle.
Wanda was staring down at her hands, carefully encased in black gloves that didn't match her navy blue dress. If Jan had known that she was going to wear her old Wasp gloves with a dress that color, she probably wouldn't have lent them to her – not so much because the colors didn't match as because the outfit's ugliness made it obvious that Wanda was wearing them in order to hide her hands. Jan didn't approve of hiding one's powers, or anything connected with them.
"It wasn't her," Jan repeated. If she said it often enough, eventually she would stop watching Wanda uneasily for signs of... something. She wasn't even sure exactly what, only that people who had been broken once could break again, usually in the same places. But possession was external, the work of an outside force, something you could guard against and fight.
"I hate my leg sometimes," Don said, the stab of familiar frustration almost as hot as the knife wound.
"I hope so." Steve wished he could be sure. He wished he could stop worrying that each next disaster would be the last straw that made Tony snap again.
"Well, no," Steve admitted, "but there was a long, telling silence during which I could feel him smirking at me."
The Helicarrier's temperature controls were always set slightly too low, something he'd never quite gotten around to fixing when he'd been in charge, and he'd spent the past twenty minutes alternately sitting and lying on a metal table with no shirt on. From some women, he might have suspected ulterior motives, but Maya had always set flirtation aside when a matter of scientific interest presented itself. Well, most of the time.
It felt like he ought to say something, but Sam couldn't think what. 'I'm sorry,' or 'I know how you feel,' or any of the other platitudes people handed out after someone died were more for the sake of courtesy than anything else.
He hit the ground hard, bad knee giving way.  He flung out his hands to catch himself, and both hands and knees slammed against a concrete floor, sending a numbing jolt of pain up his bad leg.
"I  don't think I lived up to Ella Fitzgerald, but it's good to hear that I  didn't mangle it."  Then she paused, an amused little smile appearing  on her lips, and elbowed him in the ribs, nodding for Peter to look  behind him.
And he wasn't, but that didn't make trying to play peacemaker between his... lover? boyfriend? All the words he knew for it sounded silly – and one of his oldest friends any easier.
Steve stood, holding one hand out to Tony. "Come on," he said. "It's late. You should wash that stuff off and go to bed." He was tired of being angry with Tony, of being suspicious, of waiting for the next meltdown, the next catastrophe.
There was a momentary pause, while Hank and Wanda both looked at Tony with raised eyebrows. "You know," Hank said, "you're a lot meaner as a woman."
"I can sympathize. It's still weird to see Wanda in the Avengers Mansion, but if I can work with her — hell, if
"And I'll call you if we need the backup."
"The spear first," he repeated. "Then we can seek vengeance against those who deserve it." Personally, he was going to begin with Strange and the Avengers, for thwarting his plans before. Reed Richards, he would save for last. That piece of revenge had been a long time coming, and Doom intended to savor it.
He might have been slightly rude in that last email.  Tony usually handled that side of the Avengers’ business, but he had still been in a hospital bed at that point.
Steve hit the ground hard, just managing to roll out of the way of a kick that would have caved in his skull. Then there was a familiar high-pitched whine of energy, as a repulsor beam caught Hyde right between the shoulder blades.
"That's a very astute point, Ms. Maximoff," Strange allowed. "As long as we're working together to attempt to restore your teammate to his usual self, I suppose I could instruct you in the ways of magic. You're nowhere near as far advanced as Clea, but you have managed to make a considerable amount of progress on your own, already."
He'd been using that trick more lately than he had since California – the fewer Pym particles Hank expended on himself, the more he had to spare for inanimate objects. And Hank had always liked showing off, if not necessarily in a flashy way.
He hadn't had a nosebleed in weeks, and, as long as he limited the number of connections he kept open at one time, no headaches either. At this point, Steve was just being unreasonably paranoid about the Extremis; there was no longer any reason to avoid using it.
"Let go of me," Jan snapped, trying to jerk her arm away. It was no use -- he was bigger and stronger than she was, and with an unknown toxin filling the air, she didn't dare shrink down and hide. She would only poison herself quicker that way.
As the mansion shrank into the distance below them, Tony could see Hank staring after them from the open door, his face rendered a pale blur by dim light and distance.
Better her than Wanda, Tony thought, better all of them than the entire city, and made himself fire.
"Thor! You're alive!"
Not Henry Pym. Anthony Stark. Which would make sense since this was Tony's lab, but what the hell did he need a prescription for? Hank was the one on two kinds of anti-crazy meds.
Passing out on the floor of Doom’s warehouse-turned-dungeon didn’t count as sleep.  Thor might have nearly unlimited energy, but Don was more than ready to crash for a few hours, preferably a full eight.
Tony smirked at him, which only made Steve's ears burn harder, and then turned and sauntered off down the hall.
"Remember," Tony said, as he set the quinjet down in the courtyard in front of the Metropolitan museum - any other form of transport would have taken too long - "if they break anything, we're going to have to pay for it, so try to get them outside the museum before we engage them."
"Of course he's scared," MJ said, that tiny worried, line she sometime got between her eyebrows forming. "He and Tony are... I get the impression they're pretty much married these days."
Sparks were smoldering in her clothing, and Steve could smell the sharp reek of burned hair.  She was limping badly, covered in blood, and her left arm hung motionless at her side, flesh dark and swollen.
It had watched her have sex. With Clint.
"I could have forbade him to answer Avengers priority alerts until things had been... dealt with. What if the fight the other day-"
The final Doombot ducked under a mailed fist, brought up the energy weapon it carried, and shot its compatriot twice, once in the torso and once in the head.  The blasts of energy — was it laser fire, or plasma?  Tony would know — left huge, smoking craters in the Doombot's armor, and it crumpled to the floor in a heap.
Tony already regretted raising his voice.  It wasn't going to do anything to change Steve's mind, not when he had that stubborn "my way is the only right way" set to his jaw, and had only succeeded in making his headache worse.
Doom smiled, the sting of his torn lip still sharp, and kissed her again.
Ghosts, he thought, and the way Tony didn't want Cap to touch him, and he wouldn't talk to him, and the way he had been staring at him...
"Yes, but the lawyers are afraid of what terrible legal or public relations disaster you might commit next."
"Try to ignore it, if you can," he advised Matt. "The less contact you have with Chthon, the better."
Sam shook his head, fingers never stopping their slow, soothing strokes through Redwing's feathers.  The falcon hated riding in the quinjet, even with a hood shielding his eyes.  It looked strange to see him wearing one, as if he were an ordinary bird — until you noticed the lack of jesses around his ankles.  "I haven't seen him since we got back from the Helicarrier."
What did you use to get mud and blood off of floor tiles? Jarvis would know, Tony thought.
"Hey, don't shout," Clint hissed. "We're in a hospital. The nurses will eat you." Then the import of Rhodey's words caught up with him. "A cure? That's great!" Jan was going to be okay. And Tony was going to be okay, which meant Cap would be okay.
"You're about to not be pregnant now," Hank told him. Pain plus bleeding plus pregnant almost certainly equaled a miscarriage. Which could be relatively harmless to Tony - aside from the losing the baby part - or could be extremely dangerous, depending on
"Sin was pretty open about her plans to kill us all."  Sam rubbed absently at his eye.  "I think with that book in her hands, she might be able to.  Everything feels... better... with it gone."
And even if it was unintentional, Tony was unlikely to defend himself. For one thing, he'd had feelings for Rhodey once, and Tony's willingness to take anything dealt out by someone he was in a relationship with was something that had periodically worried Steve, and worried him even more so now that Steve was in a relationship with him.
"Oh," Tony said. "One of those exhibits."
He reached up to cup the side of Steve's face, leaning in until their lips were only inches apart and
She had moved her hand. Because she chose to, not because Chthon had made her. His control must be slipping, or maybe the power that filled the cathedral nave was interfering with it. It didn't matter – all that mattered was the tiny sliver of freedom it gave her.
Wanda nodded, slowly. "As if part of you has been cut off," she said, raising one hand a little to flash the black glove at him. "And knowing that you chose to lose it only makes it harder."
"Maybe she was lonely. Maybe some part of her wanted to reconnect with her past. Maybe she just wasn't done screwing with you, literally."
They were all screwed, he reflected. They might as well go down fighting, though.
This was the dark secret Hank and Tony had concealed from him, that their actions had actually been motivated by more than lust for scientific knowledge and base treachery? That made no sense. Why conceal that which could serve to justify their actions?
"It won't really feel like home until we're back in the Avengers Mansion," he said. Not that Tony's penthouse wasn't nice, but it wasn't home.
He had not come here to hear excuses. "There is always a choice," Thor told him coldly. "You could have refused them."
"Doing what?" Tony asked, looking back up at Steve.
Around them, the contents of one of Steve's boxes of books lay scattered across the floor, the box itself lying on its side a few feet away. The bare wood of the floor was hard, still waiting to be covered by rugs, and the air smelled like new paint beneath the already-fading odor of sex.
She hadn't really thought about what that meant. She hadn't wanted to. Wanda had killed Vision — she'd watched Simon cry for him, for
is chasing you?" Tony stared at her. There were scratches along both of her bare arms, and her clothes were covered in dirt as well as scorch marks. There was a crumpled petunia stuck in her hair.
"A.I.M. released some kind of drug or poison -- we don't know what yet -- into the ventilation system at the restaurant where Tony and Jan were having lunch." Cap's voice was matter-of-fact; he didn’t sound angry or upset like Peter had expected, just kind of grim.
Carol grabbed for her, her fingers closing around the woman's densely muscled upper arms, and got the hard barrel of the handgun jammed into her stomach for her efforts.  It, too, misfired.
Thirteen minutes later, Tony appeared in the doorway.
Hank's face twisted for a moment, his misery obvious. Tony felt a pang of sympathy. Steve didn't know what it was like not to be able to trust yourself, didn't really understand that it wasn't the specific costume that was the problem, but the act of wearing one at all, and the power and responsibility it brought with it.
But the problems of trying to command a team when half the people on it weren't speaking to one another were nothing next to the miracle of having Thor back; between that and Clint's still-unexplained resurrection at Wanda's hands, Steve was beginning to understand why everyone had kept hugging him and hovering over him when he'd first... come back.
"You didn't seem surprised." Steve said it carefully, as if he were feeling something out, and Tony winced.
Who'd have expected it to involve a dress and heels?
"I'm disappointed," the Doombot said, in a perfect imitation of Doom's deep, cultured voice.  "You used to present more of a challenge than this."
"Keep this up, and you won't get to experience them."
Tony grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him closer. Steve let himself be dragged forward, putting one big hand on the back of Tony's neck. Tony closed his eyes and tipped his head back, losing himself in the kiss. He had only been gone a week, but it felt like it had been so much longer. He gave the front of Steve's shirt another tug, leaning backwards, and Steve slid forward, off the chair's arm, until he was half in Tony's lap, not breaking the kiss.
Now that she was actually down here, face to face with him, the impulse that had led Jan to go looking for Hank seemed silly. What exactly was she here for? Closure? She'd already had that. She'd gotten a divorce. He had apologized and left. And that, as they said, had been that, until Hank had joined Clint's West Coast team and suddenly she was speaking to him over the Avengers' comm link again and hearing Clint mention him when he talked about what his team had been doing.
There had been six glossy photographs, all of them full color. He could remember the details clearly, but nothing about what he'd felt or thought while looking at them. Maybe he hadn't felt anything; it had been easier not to. "I specifically requested the information."
Reed tended to forget that even people who
“I know.”  Tony’s voice was thick, the words slightly slurred.  “Otherwise we’d be dead.”
Don started to reach for the chart hanging at the foot of Hank’s bed, then stopped, glancing at him.  “Can I-“
Tony coughed again, his entire body flinching at the motion, and Steve could feel muscles jumping and shaking under his hands.  There was no blood on his lips, so he wasn’t drowning it as it filled a punctured lung, but his breathing didn’t sound right.
"What's in the tea?"
"Fashion isn't really my thing," Wanda began, shooting a pleading look at Steve and Sam.
"So it went well? Did they agree to the partnership arrangement?"
What Tony really, really wanted, if he were completely honest with himself, was a drink - preferably a lot of drinks, so that he could forget for a few hours at least that his body had been taken from him and warped into someone else's - but that would be an incredibly bad idea. If he ever started drinking again, he would never be able to stop; it let him relax, made everything that hurt go away - or almost go away, enough that he knew that just one or two more drinks would be able to fix it - and if he ever let himself have that again, he wouldn't be able to make himself stop, to give it up and go back to sobriety.
Loki smiled slightly; it was too much to hope that she hadn't noticed the way Doom had stiffened upon hearing Chthon's name. "He plans to use the spear's power to return himself to this dimension and crush it beneath his feet. His pawn is on the game board as well, and you will find him an even deadlier opponent than myself."
He backed up and re-read the first paragraph on the second page again. "'Dr. Pym was previously under investigation for his role in the enforcement of the now-defunct Superhuman Registration Act,'" he read aloud, "'but all charges have since been dropped. Chief among those charges was the death of superhero and respected scientist Dr. William Foster, killed by a clone of Thor, Dr. Pym's teammate. Foster is not the first death that can be laid at the feet of one of Pym's creations...'" Steve broke off, his irritation at Tony redirecting itself toward a new target. "And then she speculates about whether Ultron and your clone had anything to do with Hank's 'psychological breakdown.'" He looked up at Jan, who was glaring down at both of them. Even seated and with her standing, he didn't have to look up far to meet her eyes. "I'm so sorry. Ms. Floyd and I didn't get along the last time we met. She's... abrasive."
“Welcome,” she proclaims cheerfully as the two walk closer to the desk. Her bright emerald eyes open a little more as there is a hint of recognition in her head. “Wait, are you Iron Man?”
Thanks to Steve’s strength, he holds Peter tightly as he struggles to get to the billionaire for the unintentional chew toy. Tony notices his desperate attempts and rewards him by handing the object back to Peter. The baby coos happily, returning to a more calmed state with the object in his mouth. Heather smiles to herself and the memorable clicking of heels signal Sandra’s return. Still not pleased when she meets the couple again, the woman takes her hostility out by pushing a box right into Tony’s chest. He has no option but to take it. He holds the box with his fists clenching tightly, glaring at her as she leaves once more.
Peter couldn't care less about the other woman. He had long since traced his attention back to Steve -- one whose large body covered most of his vision. Steve looks like a giant and while Peter can’t comprehend a lot, the little one is sure that he has never seen someone quite like him. The tiny hands pull at the man’s shirt to get his attention. When he doesn’t receive it, the baby looks over to see Tony not that far away. He then sets out on a new mission to search for the same metal object from before.
“No, but we definitely will in the next few days,” Bruce answers for Tony as he walks on into the kitchen. He returns with a granola bar and sits on one of the couches in the living room.
“Do you know what got him into the orphanage?” Clint asks.
“Well, I have to wake up Tony and make breakfast. Do you want to watch Peter for a while?” Steve suggests.
When the teddy bear that Peter was carrying around all morning fell, he picks it up and hands it back to the baby cradled in his arms. He wonders what Fury wants and if he should wake up the others. While Clint and Nat almost always wake up early, like himself, to train or just spend the day doing something productive, the rest are not as prone to the early hours as them. Bruce likes to keep to himself and Thor had demanded that when he stays at the Tower to never be disturbed from his slumber unless it is important. Tony is pretty much indifferent due to his already abnormal sleep schedule, but Steve likes to spoil his husband with late mornings and breakfast in bed.
“Do you need help with those, Hawkeye of Earth?”
“I promise.”
J.A.R.V.I.S. later announces to the team of the eventual arrival of an agent from Social Services. They would be arriving in two hours. He also reminds them of doctor appointments Peter has tomorrow, all set up by yours truly. Completely forgetting the meeting initially, the Avengers leave Peter in a little swing adorned with bright colors, lights, sounds, and toys while they run around the huge building to clean it.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” the billionaire starts.
Now that they have reached the door, Steve’s hand makes its way to Tony’s shoulder as he holds it with loving affection and support. Tony places one of his own hands over Steve’s and squeezes it tightly while he lets out a shaky breath. They both turn forward and stare down the door with a sense of newfound inspiration. The only obstacle in their path is a dark brown wooden door with a knob made of brass in desperate need of shining.
As admiring as Steve is from his ability to survive in arctic ice for nearly 70 years, be a successful subject of a superhuman enhancement process, and a suitable captain for the Avengers Initiative, the man often did questionable things; like right now, for an example. The married couple is considered to be one of the richest couples in the world and is living in the heart of New York City so they have plenty of well-suited orphanages to visit or choose from. Ones that are definitely better kept than the one they are about to enter.
Peter starts to kick his legs and whine quietly as she lays him down. She softly sings a lullaby to lull him back to sleep. One in her native tongue and so old that she feared she might have forgotten all the words and official tune. However, she sings it with ease and the exact way she remembers it. The song does its magic and the baby is asleep within seconds. Natasha straightens her back and turns to the door. There she spots Steve smiling and leaning against the doorway. He had heard her sing to Peter.
“Do you guys want to hold him?” Tony proposes, secretly wanting to get away from the group that has swarmed him. As much as he hates to say it, the billionaire wants a drink. Big events with lots of social people have that effect on him. He blames it as a coping mechanism to deal with all the fake and snooty parts of being rich and powerful. His therapist called it being alcoholic. But he’s over that now, or else he wouldn’t have Peter.
“Yes, I do. Tony and I talked it over and we both agreed to this,” Steve goes on the defensive side. It wasn’t like Fury has complete control over their lives. The man may have been the one who spearheaded the establishment of the Avengers but he doesn’t own them. Steve’s first impression of the agent was pretty off-putting and Tony already isn’t a fan of the pirate looking man.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s okay.” Tony waves a hand to hush the already overprotective man -- soon to be a father.
“Indeed you did.” Fury chuckles lightly. “Then you do remember how dangerous it is to have a baby, especially in the Avengers Initiative Headquarters.”
It isn’t until later into the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, that Tony and Bruce came through the elevator, back from working in the lab. Natasha glances through the large windows, seeing the sun’s position and looks back at the pair.
Clint empties his armful of toys on the ground and Natasha lays Peter on his stomach after she sets down the blanket. The trio keeps him entertained by gaining his interest in several of his new toys. Thor awkwardly maneuvers around Peter. It is clear to see that the much stronger god is exercising restraint with the weaker baby. Natasha laughs at how the man acts. To push upon their relationship more, Natasha gently places the baby in Thor’s arms. He frantically looks to his partners who laugh even more as he holds the baby in his rigid arms. Natasha even takes it upon herself to take a few pictures to capture the precious moment before she complies and lays Peter on his stomach again.
“A box,” Tony questions aloud, very unsure of what a baby could have that fills a box.
There is one baby still awake, squirming around quietly in his bed. His name is painted above in cursive with a gentle pastel blue covering the entirety crib. Steve gets Tony’s attention right away and the men share a long look with the baby who returns it by watching with curious golden eyes and a small tuft of brown hair adorning his crown. Small hands reach up and try to grab at them as a reaction to the attention he receives. Heather walks over and gives a little smile as she picks up the small boy and takes him out of the room. The couple follows her because they have finally found their son.
Natasha’s eyes light up after hearing Tony’s offer. It is slightly concerning for him to see since the last time Natasha gave him that look, he hadn’t been able to use his left hand for a week.
“Of course,” the woman replies with a small smirk of her own as she types on the keyboard again.
“Blah,” Peter coos. This grabs the attention of the billionaire. Looking down he can see Pepper make similar nonsense noises and exaggerated expressions for the boy,
“And our caseworker is Ms. Sarah Mitchell.”
“I promise to you that Tony and I will always be there to defend Earth, no matter the circumstances. If you have anything else you wish to add then say so now or leave,” Steve warns; his voice rising slowly with each word. Fury detects his tread on thin ice and realizes that he’s overstayed his welcome. He stands to leave and Maria does the same.
“You do not wish to be called the name that was given to you,” he replies, slightly concerned.
“Maybe, but he did just give me this for Peter.” Steve holds up the manila folder for the pair to see. The assassins are smart enough to realize what its purpose is. The special ink stamp of the branch is a dead giveaway. They return a look of astonishment to Steve.
“On it, sir,” he concludes.
The next day is just as early. It’s always early for Peter but more so for the rest of the team. Tony picks out an outfit for Peter and Steve manages to fit the snug clothing over the wiggling baby. The small family makes their way to their private clinic. Steve waits anxiously with Tony and Peter in a childish painted room.
“Will this not scare him?” Bruce quietly interjects when he spots Natasha take Peter, and the group, to one of the large couches nearby. He stands quite a few inches lower than the other but the two don’t mind the difference.
“But what story,” Tony asks. He is not sure what to do either.
Steve holds out his large hand above the baby and twirls the calloused fingers around to amuse Peter when he gets comfortable holding him. This works to amuse the baby since Peter opens his eyes fully and starts to make more attempts to grab at the soldier’s fingers. Peter brings the captured fingers to his mouth to suck and chew on them when he is successful. Steve stifles a laugh and resists the urge to pull away from the drooling mouth when the weird, wet feeling makes its way to his senses. Tony continues to watch with great amusement and looks up to see Steve’s face. The soldier looks so happy and pleased. Tony feels his heart pulse in a loving response to his cheery husband. A sense of longing and rash decisions meets the billionaire’s mind.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Tony calls out, irritated. “What did I tell you about this?”
The Avengers do their most important work that needs to be completed. Some shower and others spar together or work on major projects while they still can until J.A.R.V.I.S. alerts them of Peter waking. Steve is the first to get up to grab the boy. He has Tony take the baby from his arms in the living room and goes to make another warm bottle from baby formula. When Peter finishes that bottle, the cumulative group each takes turns holding him.
“Is he still against you and Tony having a kid?” Clint asks, sitting down on a chair opposite of Steve and Peter.
When Steve disappears, Clint moves next to his friend and teammate to clearly observe the baby. Up close, Clint can see how the couple fell for Peter the moment they saw him.
“It’s one of the safest places to keep a baby, I promise.” The slightly condescending tone in Tony’s voice is clearly evident.
In the short window of time, the team was given, they finish just when J.A.R.V.I.S. states that the woman is waiting on the ground floor lobby; a few minutes later than expected. Steve is ultimately the one to go down with Tony. Since Tony is the owner of the building, the woman has to talk to him and Steve follows because not only are they married but the super soldier is the only one to promise that Tony would not treat the woman rudely. After all, first impressions need to be pleasant.
A laugh was nearly brought to his lips when he actually stops to think about it. It all comes back to Stark. Tony’s father had created the superhuman serum and given means to Steve so that he could fight and how does he repay the brilliant scientist; by marrying his only son and heir to the Stark fortune. Man, he must be rolling in his grave.
“Well, Peter does not cry as much as other kids. It is not too uncommon with orphans but it is a little hard because when he is hungry or he wants something, he does not get the attention of anyone else. Some parents find it off-putting,” she explains.
The couple knew that today would be perfect upon checking the news. The well-dressed man had pointed to the map of northeastern America, zoning in on the region of New York in particular.  He declared the weather for the day and the rest of the week to be sunny skies with only a slight chill still hanging in the air. People can be spotted on the cracked sidewalks as they drive. Some are bundled in long, trendy coats with matching hats and scarves.  Those who are bolder wear t-shirts and shorts.
“Adorable,” Natasha comments as she walks over to see the baby too. The natural saunter of her body makes her seem dangerous and sensual. The striking red hair curling at her shoulders adding to her natural flair.
“Alright, alright. It’s yours.” Steve laughs and grabs another present. He lightly shakes the present to get Peter’s attention but it doesn’t stick. Peter is too involved in his toy to care about anything else. Steve just pulls him into his lap and begins to open the other presents, slowly eliminating the pile over time. Many of the gifts are clothes that Steve admits to being absolutely adorable and can’t wait to see them on Peter. Besides outfits, there are shoes, superhero-themed toys, and bottles but nothing is better received than the teddy bear.
“What’s wrong with Peter?” Steve’s voice already layered with concern.
“She does not approve of us, does she?” Steve proposes. Heather nods solemnly in response.
“About four months,” Steve answers. The super soldier has to admit, although he didn’t want a baby shower, he is very grateful for his friends’ effort.
“Pancakes,” the pair shout back almost instantly.
“Yeah, what did old Scarface have to say?” Clint adds. He comes in behind Natasha with a half-eaten banana. He wears a very similar outfit to Natasha but with dark purple leggings instead.
“Yeah, thank you,” Tony says as he gives a flashy grin and walks to the door. He manages to awkwardly open the door for himself and Steve to pass through while refusing any sort of help.
“You want me to get some toys and a blanket from his room,” Clint suggests while he watches Natasha place him on the couch beside her.
Steve nods and awkwardly holds out his arms to carry their very soon-to-be son. Heather complies with a small giggle and carefully hands Peter over. The soldier supports the fragile neck and cradles the baby’s body close to his muscular chest as he was instructed during the classes he took with the rest of the Avengers to ensure everyone knew how to take care of a baby.
“Do you have any requests for breakfast?”
It’s a bittersweet feeling for Tony as he watches his husband hold the baby. His mind wondering what kind of neglect could have led to the poor boy’s silence. How long did he have to cry to realize no one would come to his aid?
J.A.R.V.I.S. alerts them plenty of times that night when Peter awakes or starts crying; sometimes it’s both. The couple takes turns in assessing the fussy baby. Sometimes the problems can be solved in half an hour and sometimes it takes the full hour and then some to put Peter back to sleep. When Tony’s turn came around for what felt like the tenth time, he just couldn’t seem to leave the room without the baby resuming his cries. It was like Peter was addicted to the feeling of being surrounded by people. In a tired and fed up attitude, he decides to bring Peter to his room. Steve awoke after being shaken and he understands that the baby would have to sleep with them tonight. Peter stays in the middle of the bed with pillows around him to keep the adults from accidentally rolling on him in the night. But both parents are way too alert at night to accidentally do something as traumatizing as that. The rest of the night, the three sleep without much complication.
He follows through with his offer and goes to Peter’s room. He leaves the baby’s room with a lot of toys and a fuzzy red blanket. He bumps into Thor on his way back. It isn’t surprising since somehow you almost run into everyone about four times a day in the large building. The god looks at all the small toys and deduces that they are for Peter.
His scowl is quite evident to the receptionist.
Tony sighs and looks at Steve. “What should we do?”
The party made its way later into the night. The moon had peaked out in a quarter of its full glory accompanied with twinkling little stars. Quite a few of their friends left to resume their normal lives. Of the ones who stayed were Bruce, Clint, Natasha, Thor, Steve, and Tony which are also the same people who live in the building. By that time, everyone decides they should open the presents left for Peter. The baby watches with wide eyes and his mouth in a little ‘o’ from the floor as the gifts are placed in a pile before him. Steve grabs one of the smaller wrapped presents and encourages Peter to open it with him. The small hands try to grab at the slippery paper to the best of their capabilities. The baby’s face contorts from all the effort. Steve chuckles and helps by pulling off the clear tape and ripping the light blue wrapping paper to offer up traction and grip. This doesn’t help but it keeps Peter entertained.
, Steve thinks to himself.
The tour she was given took a rather long time. The meeting conducted afterward was long too; longer than anyone would have liked, even for the woman administering it. Because the time drew on so long, Peter had been able to take a nap, get fed with more baby food, and changed by the other Avengers. Steve briefly wonders if they can handle it but Natasha is with them and she would make sure that Peter is in perfect and absolute condition.
The flash from a camera in the corner of Steve’s eye pulls his attention to look up where he sees Natasha smiling beside Clint. She holds a camera pointed directly at them. The picture barely affects the baby and he continues to play around in the wrappings. Steve pulls at the paper some more and eventually Peter is able to successfully rip it enough to reveal a stuffed animal; a tiny brown teddy bear. Peter squeals in delight and holds the toy close to his body. Steve smiles and goes to pull the tag from the bear’s ear but the baby moves away from his hand the best he can so that Steve can’t reach his toy. Steve retracts his arm so he can properly observe Peter’s offended gaze.
the baby over. Luckily, Steve aids him by taking Peter quickly with a less than pleased expression on his face but he holds the baby in a gentle grasp that contradicts the soldier's emotions.
“Sir, there are people in the lobby requesting to speak with you,” J.A.R.V.I.S. spoke, interrupting the flow of Steve’s early morning thoughts.
“You’re back early,” she says.
Tony shrugs and grabs a not-so-healthy snack from one of the kitchen’s many pantries before heading off into the training room.
“Are you sure about this?” Tony Stark asks.
, Tony wonders when he spots a look of relief and determination on the boy’s face.
Tony grins and plucks the little metal object from Peter’s weak grip and hands the baby back to the young woman.
“Do you need help with the Black Widow to watch over Peter Stark-Rogerson?”
The car ride does not take long and they arrive at their home but not without complications. As soon as Peter was placed in his car seat, he became upset. He didn’t cry or scream but made it extremely difficult for Steve to buckle him into the car seat. The wiggling baby made it harder for Steve to make sure he was strapped in correctly as he was just barely grasping how the seat worked. The baby had thrown or dropped his toy and whined an awful lot. Tony specifically chose a route that was longer to calm Peter. The quiet hum of the vehicle and smooth motions did the trick. By the time the car stopped in front of the tall and futuristic building, Peter was yawning and sleepy. The baby is, thankfully, less grumpy when taken out of the car.
“Huh?” Tony backpedals into the room with the group. He takes notice of how Peter kicks his legs and smiles happily when he heard the man that took him to his new home.
Steve notices how her height drops. It isn’t, however, that surprising since she was sitting on an unseen chair at level with her standing desk. That and Steve is used to being taller than a lot of other people.
When the party officially ends for the team, Tony feeds Peter a bottle of baby formula. The baby falls asleep rather quickly with his new toy held tightly in his tiny arms. Before everyone went to bed, Steve takes the opportunity to ask around in order to discover who gave Peter the toy but no one claimed it. The tag has no clear name or company; not even a barcode or purchase tag. Steve and Tony find no trouble with the mysterious toy and allows for their son to keep it. Peter’s sleeping form is then placed in his new crib surrounded by other stuffed animals. The small baby lays there at peace. Tony has J.A.R.V.I.S. play soft, gentle music for the boy and makes sure to have the AI keep an eye, or scanner, on Peter while the couple heads off to their own room to sleep.
Tony trusted them.
“What?” T’challa asked sarcastically. “I assumed you would be glad to see me.” Tony laughed quietly as he took a seat at his work table. He shoved another stool from under the table, and T’challa took it with yet another mischievous smile. Tony didn’t know kings were capable of behaving this way.
The stories would follow from there, whether it was Howards riddled with jokes and a little smugness about his involvement in Project Rebirth or Peggys that had the fond and slightly nostalgic energy of someone remembering a lost loved one. Tony always left the evening feeling closer to a person he never met. He admired Steve Rogers not because he was a hero but because he was a humble man who became one.
Tony had his body facing the room, but he didn’t let his eyes take it in for more than a moment. Instead, he turned his head to look at Rhodey, who was already talking to him about the AC in his leg braces - a conversation they had an hour before the team landed. Something for Tony to pretend to listen to while he collected himself, he realized. Tonys mouth curved upwards as he watched Rhodey survey the room as he spoke. Tony used his peripheral vision to do the same. Natasha had paused next to the couch where she handed T’challa the drink but had made no effort to rejoin the conversation. Instead, she was looking in Tony’s direction, and he took a breath in before flicking his eyes back at her. She seemed to have been waiting for him to notice and made her way over to him, a gentle smile gracing her face.
“Rhodey is gonna be livid that we left him to do the awkward greetings without back up. Vision is the best, but he needs a little work when it comes to reading a room.” Tony would get an earful before the end of the day, he was sure.
“Shellhead,” she said softly as she lifted her arms - giving Tony the option to refuse her embrace. But, instead, he huffed a small laugh and wrapped his arms around her. She squeezed his shoulders before leaning back and looking him over. “You look tired.”
Tony groaned and made no move to stand. He expected the king to pester him until he caved, but T’challa just smiled rather sadly,
The King had gotten in touch three days after Siberia. Tony had been on his way to the Compound to help Rhodey with physical therapy when he answered the call.
“My sister said that I simply must come see your work in her stead, seeing as she is too busy to do it herself.” T’challa placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder and began to walk towards the Compound. “I also have a few other important matters to discuss with you. I was hoping to get those out of the way now so as to leave no extra work later.” The two of them made their way through the Compound to Tony’s workshop before Tony raised his eyebrows at the king.
Captain America was a hero. Ask anyone on the streets or the moon if you so desired; the answer would be the same. The reasons might have varied slightly depending on who you chose to question, but Captain America was a hero.
Tony Stark knew this as if he was born with the knowledge. It was interesting to grow up surrounded by people who fought beside him. From what he could tell, Captain America was a man who deserved the world but instead gave himself up to save it. The constant tales of the skinny boy from Brooklyn who tried several times to enlist or the juiced-up super-soldier who had Hitler on the run never really lost their intrigue. It surprised Tony more than anyone else. His house was not always one that exerted warmth, but a surefire way to draw people into a conversion was to bring up Steve Rogers.
The woman’s face is stone cold and she is clearly not impressed by the fancy technology in the building. Any normal person may have wonder or admiration in their eyes. Her jet black hair is kept short to her face and her features are defined with muted and pale makeup. She looks like every desk worker you see in an office or see as an extra in a T.V. show.
His first trip to the doctor wasn’t the best but a friendly nurse tried her best to make it up. She gave the boy a brightly colored green sucker. Peter immediately stops crying and takes the sucker.
Bruce hums in response and goes over to the bar for a drink; something to get rid of any remaining anxiety. Steve follows but does not participate in drinking anything alcoholic. Tony and Steve swore it off for their health. They also have to set a good example for their son.
“I honestly saw no danger in this. I made sure that no one other than the people in this room has knowledge of the party. Besides, sir, I believe this is good for you,” the A.I. responds with its disembodied voice in the form of a British accent. Tony just gives a slightly defeated sigh and pretends to be angrier than he is.
business, we can always make room for him.” Fury waves and takes his exit.
“Good. I just need to ask someone about Peter but you two can hold him until I get back.”
From the moment they step in, Tony and Steve can tell the atmosphere is very different from initial thoughts. Not only is the temperature warmer inside the building than the early spring bite of outside, but the aged look has no visual effect on the interior. The first, spacious room is a large and open lobby littered with modern decor. Plain black sofas and armchairs set out in perfect angles accompanied with knee-height tables holding slightly outdated magazines to pass the time. A T.V. placed high on the wall plays the news at a quiet volume. Steve briefly catches the sight of Tony on a cover of one of the magazines looking as handsome as always but decides not to bring it up.
“Uh, yeah. You can help Nat and me with Peter for today. It’ll be good for him to get to know you,” Clint says. He heads for the living room with Thor beside him.
“And there is nothing wrong with that, but you should know that having a kid isn’t the smartest move to make at the moment. The controversy and threats are too great, not to mention the complications of working if you have a kid with you.” Fury emphasizes by gesturing to the baby. The baby just looks to Fury and back to his father, sensing the hostility in the air.
“It is Director Fury and his subordinate, Maria Hill,” he responds.
To everyone’s surprise, Bruce did very well with handling Peter. Steve was quick to ask if he could take Peter off his hands when the little boy began to grab and pull Bruce’s glasses off his face but the scientist just laughed it off. No one had expected the man to be so patient; especially when he turned into an unstoppable and invulnerable hulk when angry. Peter is then passed on to Thor again and the god still expressed his anxiety. That is until Peter started to pull at his golden strands. Thor felt no pain and found it extremely amusing. This only encouraged Peter to pull harder and Clint took the baby to not continue bad habits since there is a long-haired woman that would
Without any place to lay Peter down, Steve continues to hold him in his left arm as he formally shook Fury’s hand and then Maria’s. He shows them to a seat by him on the comfortable yet modern furniture.
They stand at the end of the sidewalk before a few concrete stairs that lead to an old building. Tony is dressed head to toe in expensive yet casual attire for the occasion. His outfit in dark gray tones matches his black, greasy hair and metallic eyes. A rusted metal plaque bolted on the wall to the right states that the building is an orphanage established some time back. The billionaire is, of course, skeptical about coming to the building with his husband who is standing to his left completely confident and dressed as though he is just another person on the street; blue jeans and a shirt that just barely fit of his muscular build. His outfit selected carefully that morning to make him blend in and to not stand out, unlike his counterpart.
“You were a part of this?” Tony asks with slight concern.
“Thank you.” Steve nods as well as he shifts Peter in his arms for a more comfortable hold.
Tony and Steve take their time to look around and observe each child as Heather takes a more relaxed role in locating their baby out of the rest. Little names are drawn carefully in thin, black calligraphy on each of the headboards of the cribs. Names of varying origins given to the tiny yet abandoned human beings. All of the children are fast asleep and cuddling their toys or blankets for comfort; almost all of them.
“No, not really. And you can call me Clint when we’re in the Tower.”
“So, you’ve decided to raise a baby in the Avengers Tower.” Her voice is already strained and mundane. Her opinions are of something close to skepticism. Tony’s feelings are mutual of her but he does a better job of concealing it. Steve glares at Tony for a millisecond to make sure he curbs his attitude with the person who could make the decision to take away their new son.
They had gone through the easy part when it was time for Peter to get his shots. Peter was not pleased when he first saw the sharp needles. The boy was curious about the needle, not knowing what its purpose was. Steve lightly held Peter’s arm still for the doctor. When the doctor proceeded to administer the needles into his skin, Peter’s mood instantly soured. As expected, the baby cried from the pain of a few shots, but Tony and Steve didn’t want to risk the chance of Peter getting sick. The doctor returns for a few finals words with the parents. Peter, on the verge of tears again, starts to crawl away or he tries to in Steve’s iron grip.
“Oh, right, I’m Steve Rogers.” He gives a slight and respectful nod to the receptionist.
“Something about an investigation that went cold.”
“Yep, that’s me.” Tony returns the smile with a cocky half smirk that he did not mean to do until he caught himself afterward. In truth, Tony is not in the mood for chit-chatting with a fan. He shoots a quick glance to Steve for help.
“So, I see the rumors were true,” Fury muses with his deep voice as he watches Steve hold Peter before looking at the steamers left up from last night. Steve nods along.
“Have J.A.R.V.I.S. pick one,” the soldier suggests with a shrug of his shoulders.
The couple looked to her at the end of the day with hopeful eyes. She sighs and tells them of her rating. The house is in suitable condition for Peter. No immediate dangers whatsoever. They celebrate after she leaves by ordering several pizzas from a nearby place. Peter just giggles and babbles the entire time.
J.A.R.V.I.S., the AI computer system hooked up to the entire house, greets them as Tony enters the building with Peter in his arms. The little boy had practically forgotten the toy from before and left it for Tony to pocket it once more. Steve carries the box this time around with little effort and they ride the elevator to the main floor a.k.a. the living room or the party room. As they step out of the elevator, Tony and Steve freeze.
“Here, I’ll take Peter for the morning. You can go train and Tony can go finish that project with Bruce,” she says.
“Just warning me, I guess,” Steve replies unsure of his own answer.
“All I know is that his parents are probably dead. Tony said he would look into it,” Natasha answers while looking down at the boy. She is very glad that Peter isn’t a fussy or a shy, skittish baby.
“He’s a strong kid, I can tell. He’ll be fine,” Steve discloses with his friend.
. Tony finally manages to step out of the elevator with more help from Steve than he’d care to admit. Tony takes only a few more steps again before he’s flocked by mainly female friends entranced by the charm of the baby.
to be asleep,” she apologizes as she looks the little boy over. The baby shows no signs of struggles or protest. In fact, to Tony, the baby looks pretty content; not happy or sad, just content.
The next morning Steve wakes up early. With not much to do at 7 o'clock in the morning, he goes to check on Peter. Even though J.A.R.V.I.S. did not notify them during the night about Peter, the baby surely needs to be attended to. So, while his husband slept -- his body sprawled out over the large bed they shared -- Steve takes care of Peter. The boy is awake and sucking on a pacifier that must have been left in the bed for him. Steve picks the quiet boy up and brings him to the changing station tucked away in the corner of the room. From there, he changes Peter’s soiled diaper and wipes him clean. He brings the boy with him to the kitchen to warm up another bottle as breakfast when the task is over and done with. He briefly wonders if Peter could handle any form of solid foods but decides against it since he is clearly too small for it.
“Okay, I found it. Seems you are all set up to take Peter home. I believe that right now the babies are taking naps. We can still get him for you two though, but you have to be quiet,” she notes as she types into the computer some more before standing.
“Steve, do you really think he’s… the one?” Tony looks to the frozen form of his husband and then back down at the baby. Peter, noticing the lack of movement in the fingers, stares at the two with his beautiful eyes.
“When you think Peter’s old enough, or if he ever wants to get into the
“Why not,” Tony suggests.
think he is?” Steve pulls his hand away to wipe the slobber off on his jeans.
“Yes, we discussed the possibility of adoption before,” Steve brings up carefully.
An older woman arrives quicker than expected. The woman’s dark brown hair cut neatly to her shoulders and straightened so well that it didn’t look natural. In her arms is the baby. He isn’t moving or squirming around anymore, much to the woman’s delight. Peter is still dressed in footie pajamas but it’s different than the other. This outfit bears more designs of cute, cartoon dinosaurs and of better quality. The baby’s chubby face is emotionless as always but when he’s brought closer to the couple, a tiny smile forms due to recognition.
The clicking of keys bounces around the room as she gathers and searches for the correct information. Her mouse joins the symphony of noises with more clicks as she moves it around on a pad.
Steve gently holds the bottle for Peter to drink from as they sit in the living room. The amount of the drink slowly going down and the audible sound from Peter are indications of him sucking from the bottle. The tiny hands curl around the bottle and one even curls around a few of Steve's fingers. The soldier settles with placing the empty bottle on the coffee table beside the couch and looks over Peter when he finishes with his meal.
His brow furrowed. “Do you really think me a lesser man? You think I just run away from my problems?”
“No, it’s true,” he murmured, standing straight but keeping his eyes trained on the carpet. “I should have acted sooner. I could have acted really at any time...but I didn’t. She said it herself: should have, could have, would have.
Her face flushed slightly, casting her eyes down away from Steve. “If I weren’t in this sling, you wouldn’t have to do this either.”
When they finally broke apart to catch their breath, Toni chuckled softly. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., advise all visitors tonight and into tomorrow morning that I am not to be disturbed.”
“Neither one of you have your priorities straight.”
” Toni drawled, giving a wide smirk to the camera. “You like to say you’re the authority in waiting too long. I’m sure I could give you a run for your money.”
” he cried, tapping the screen repeatedly. As the screen remained blank, his heart shattered into a million pieces. “Bring it back. She wasn’t finished!”
“You don’t have to do this, Steve.”
“You haven’t been sleeping, have you?”
He turned to Pepper, the redness of his eyes and the fresh tears making his baby blues abundantly clear. “Tell me we can trace that signal,” he bellowed. “Tell me we can take a suit there and bring her home!”
She was being a rude host, it was true. Her bare feet padded across the light silver carpet to the white chair beside the sectional, where she sat at the very edge. “I’m surprised you’re even here, Capsicle. I was certain after the meeting a few days ago you were going to vanish again.”
Even if she did misread everything, she was helpless as an attraction blossomed for Steve. He worried about everyone on the team, but paid special attention to her, something she wasn’t necessarily used to. He’d make sure her bruises were all tended to, that she ate after really rough missions. He put in a lot of effort to show he was there for her…
Steve reached into her left pocket where one key was sticking out, clutching them as soon as they slipped into his massive palm. His other hand nudged Toni out of the way as he slid one of the keys into the lock. The tumbler system clicked, so he jiggled the handle and the door opened. He gestured the woman inside, following in close pursuit without saying a word.
She smirked playfully. “In a way, I suppose you could say that.”
“I don’t see why, Miss. Captain Rogers has been on property since landing from Wakanda. In fact, several times this week surveillance has captured him pacing by your suite door.”
The way he said her name made her attention snap to him.
He advanced over to where Toni was standing near the door as he prepared to leave. “He was your level head and you were his right hand. You two need to figure things out on how to become whole together again before starting on the path to fixing everything. You can’t always run before learning how to walk.”
Those memories played out in her brain every day, along with thinking about what Happy had told her. She and Steve were essentially the glue that held the team together. If they weren’t at odds, maybe they would have all been able to stop Thanos together.
Her arms snaked over her chest. “Your best friend? You’re so stupidly loyal, Steve, it’s not even funny.”
Other than F.R.I.D.A.Y.
He slid out the bathroom door and was gentlemanly enough not to peek at her full frontal display.
“Right now, you sure as hell aren’t being a solution. I can sure tell you that.”
She couldn’t help but chuckle. “Look who’s making jokes now. Nah. Save the ice for after the bath. Makes temperature play more fun,” she purred, wiggling her eyebrows.
“Toni.”
“You’re damn right you should have,” he whispered, voice shaking as a stream of tears cascaded down his face. “I should have, too.”
There was a soft guffaw on the other side of the bed followed by a dip, causing her eyes to pop open. The super soldier swung his legs up and tilted his torso back so he was resting himself on the pillow beside her. “You can’t get rid of me that easily, Stark.”
“What do you think?
A deep, guttural cry of agony, torment, and grief ripped through him and echoed through the walls of the study. It was almost certain that it could be heard throughout the complex.
“Again?” He folded up the paper he had been reading and rose to his feet to face her. “Y’know, nothing is going to get solved or move on until you two just kiss and make up already.”
The camera cut out momentarily, and Steve’s body lurched forward just the slightest, trying to keep the video going. When Toni’s image reappeared, he huffed in a second of relief and readjusted himself.
There was a black armchair to Pepper’s right, and the revelation had her long legs wobbling. She took a seat and cleared her throat for her next command. “Play the message...please, F.R.I.D.A.Y.”
“Any particular reason, Miss Stark?”
Happy led her to her door and gave her a light hug. “I’ll see you in the conference room at three. If you need anything before then-”
“Yes, you are.”
“It’s a figure of speech.” He cocked his head to the side. “What the hell even happened?”
She blinked away the tears, eyes focused on Steve’s in front of her. Her delicate fingers reached up and framed his face, bringing him closer. She hesitated a moment, though, second guessing if she wanted to take the chance.
She murmured an affirmative before a smirk tugged at her lips. “A bit, but you forgot the conditioner.” Yeah, she could’ve gotten by without it, but that would mean the pampering would stop.
She waited until most of the water was drained before she considered standing. Since her left arm was already braced against the tub, she didn’t see any harm in putting a little bit of weight on it to stabilize herself. She overestimated her capabilities, and her elbow slid into the tub, hitting the porcelain bottom with a thud and sending a stabbing pain shooting up her arm. “Sonova mother-”
“According to heat signatures, Captain Rogers is already in the study area. Should I advise him to stay put as you will be joining him shortly?”
“You received a video message from Boss just a short while ago. I’ve taken the liberty of attempting to locate the source of the video.”
There was a terse moment of silence between them as they glared at each other. Toni really caught a look at Steve’s face. The word “exhausted” didn’t even seem to cover it.
This time she didn’t fight him. Bed actually sounded relaxing and she could probably use the sleep. She sauntered into the bedroom and crawled onto the bed. “Thanks for looking out for me, Steve,” she mumbled as she snuggled in the blanket further, closing her eyes.
It was late one night when Toni was having all these thoughts again, and they were just agitating the billionaire more. In an effort to distract herself, she figured it was time to finally bite the bullet and write the official public relations statement on the culling.
Her shoulders rolled in a shrug, bunching up the sleeves of her wine-colored blouse along with them. “He doesn’t think I have my priorities straight, and he’s still angry at me over signing the damn Accords.”
Pepper flinched, not at the tone of his voice, but the anguish she could hear as it cracked. Huge drops of water fell from his eyes, and in that moment she wished she had all the answers for him. “I...can’t do that, Steve. F.R.I.D.A.Y. is working on tracing the signal, but that could still take a while. Even if she did find one-”
“I’m going to step into my room a moment and freshen up. At three o’clock, we’ll meet in Conference Room A to go over the new security system schematics. Sound good?”
“How do the appearance of aliens in Wakanda and New York correlate with recent disappearances?”
“Shuri: MISSING.”
As he rotated on his heel to stalk off to the security office, she placed her hand on the thermal hand scanner. Access was granted, and she stepped into her own space free from intrusion or flash bulbs or anything else that could get into her head.
“‘He used the pretense of my injured arm to get me naked. Isn’t he such a romantic?’”
“I’m working on that now, Miss Potts. So far, the outcome does not appear favorable, even with the use of an Iron Woman suit.”
“Shit.”
She swallowed hard before speaking again. “I let my guard down, let you in. Maybe it’s my fault for not acting first. Maybe not. But when you chose Barnes over me...chose my parents’ killer over me...I felt abandoned all over again.”
“Miss Potts is on her way in to see you, sir. It’s regarding Boss.”
She sat cross-legged on her enormous king bed, laptop on her calves while three semi-transparent screens hovered in front of her face. One was for referencing previous press releases Pepper made, one was for accessing the Associated Press stylebook so little to no editing had to be done for the papers, and one was for news streams. As much as she didn’t want to relive the tragedy, the streams would help her think of material.
That sentiment made her heart leap a little bit, but she grumbled something under her breath as he turned on the shower head, a gentle stream of water pouring out. His hand brushed against her forehead, tilting her head back. She sucked in a breath, prepared for the same scalding temperature as her bath water was. Rather surprised when the water cascading down her scalp was more on the warm side, she couldn’t help but melt into it.
Steve sighed from the chaise lounge before pushing himself to his feet, closing a bit of the distance between him and the Iron Woman. “Toni.”
“H-How…” she started, taking a moment to choke back a sob before she continued. “How far away was the original signal?”
Pepper had no immediate response. How could she? She knew what she was going through losing her best friend. She couldn’t even imagine what Steve was going through.
Toni was about to argue before Steve set the towel down and retreated into her bedroom.
His hand slid into her right, his other hand taking her left. His body was hot, on fire it felt like to her. Maybe that was just her, and the arguing made her hands clammy. She couldn’t tell. “It wasn’t easy to hurt you. I knew I would lose you, and I’ve ached over that choice every day. Bucky even gave me hell over it.”
“Oooh,” she cooed, leaning her head against the back of the tub and winking at the super soldier, “A little bath play to get me warmed up? Why, Captain, you certainly are being brazen tonight.”
“Miss Potts! What are the Avengers or Stark Industries doing to aid the nation of Wakanda?”
“When I drift off,” she murmured gradually, smile forming once again over her lips as she pointed to the camera, “I’ll dream about you. It was you during New York, Sokovia, even after. It’s always you. I should’ve called you sooner, should’ve reached out.”
A look of relief flashed across the super soldier’s features momentarily.
Long, caramel brown tendrils shuddered as Toni shook her head, slithering off her bed and padding across the room and into the hall. “I’ll welcome our guest, F.R.I.D.A.Y. Thank you.”
Toni snorted. “Thanks for the newsflash. Who is it?”
She blushed furiously, keeping the towel as fanned out as she could while drying off. “Jesus, Steve. I’m Iron Woman, not a porcelain doll. It was just an accident.”
The super soldier’s face turned almost cherry, his features twisting into crippling pain, anguish, and heartbreak. His eyebrows knitted together, his eyes screwed shut. His hands dug into his own dirty blond locks in frustration and aggravation, in helplessness. He couldn’t save Vision, couldn’t save Wanda, couldn’t save Bucky...and couldn’t save Toni.
“You know...you know what hurts the most?” he asked, making eye contact with the woman on the sofa. “Pepper, she will die never knowing. She’ll never know if we’re alive, never know if we got her message...and never know of how I feel.”
“The last time anyone saw Toni Stark, she was blasting off to the alien spacecraft here in New York. Where is Miss Stark now?”
He cocked his head to the side. “Well, considering you keep complaining about that damn sling, I’m pretty sure I’m helping you get a bath.” He dropped his hands away and grabbed his shooting gloves and suit jacket from the counter. “I can go get Nat if you want, but I know she’s getting herself looked at too and is training at the moment. You’re free to wait until she’s finished...when the water is icy cold.”
A minuscule smile danced across Steve’s lips as his free hand slid under Toni’s hair, supporting it to make sure he got every strand wet. When he was satisfied with the tips, he moved his attention to her roots, gingerly pushing her head to the left and then the right to ensure he covered every millimeter with water. He even lifted her soaked hair to get the underside and the back of her neck.
She reached the door in no time, her lithe fingers curling around the deadbolt before she glanced down at her wardrobe. Donning black sleeping shorts and her favorite AC/DC t-shirt, she wasn’t exactly dressed to impress. Oh well. Her suite, her rules.
He rounded the corner and sank to his knees beside the bathtub, studying her. “Too hot?”
Over the course of the next few days, Toni found ways to busy herself around her suite and the lab, shutting herself off from the rest of the group. After the argument with Steve and then the conversation with Happy, she felt it best to just keep to herself. Maybe that would give her a chance to reflect on things with the super soldier.
She couldn’t help but snort at his response as she rotated on her heel, her back to him. When he didn’t immediately return to her, she twisted her head. “You didn’t have to put me in a sling to get me naked, Cap,” she cooed. “All you had to do was ask nicely.”
His attention turned to her incredulously. After his outburst, it should have been obvious. “What kind of a question…” He trailed off when he saw her cock her eyebrow. She already knew the answer, but she wanted him to say it out loud. He sighed and wandered over to the window, gazing at the autumnal forest outside of the complex. The sky was as blue as his irises and cloudless, allowing the sun to beam down.
Toni shook her head to break herself from her thoughts before hurriedly opening the door wider to welcome him in. “Yeah, come on in. If we’re gonna argue, I rather it be behind closed doors anyway. Less embarrassing.”
His brows shot up in response, but he remained silent.
Moving closer, he hovered over her, fingers tugging upwards on the hem of her t-shirt and helping her get it off over the right side of her body. The left side, with the sling, was a bit more of a challenge. He had to stretch the arm hole a little bit more to help get her arm out.When she was finally out, her fingers undid the button of her jeans and pushed them past her hips. With a little shimmy, they pooled at her feet. Kicking off her shoes was the only primary task left, and at least she was able to do that with ease.
“C’mon,” he said, tapping her back to make her step forward. “Let’s get you to bed.”
Hearing the billionaire call his name was music to his ears, if only for a moment. His attention focused more intensely on the video.
His voice was still strangled with emotion when he answered her, “Y’know, Miss Potts, it takes two to tango,” he drawled. “I should’ve manned up and asked her on a date a long time ago. You could sit here and bust her chops till you’re blue in the face...but I’m at fault, too.”
“‘I may have got Cap in bed, but he’s the one who got me naked.’”
“Shall I get the door, Miss?”
He scoffed and dropped to his knees again, reaching for the shower head one more. The water dribbled over her scalp and down her strands as his fingers tugged as tenderly as they could, trying to get out all of the conditioner. After a few minutes under the stream, he stopped and returned the shower head to its original position then ducked down to pull the plug on the drain. Rotating on his heel, he turned to give Toni just the smallest amount of privacy as he unfurled the enormous blue towel, getting it ready for her to step into.
“Haven’t I always been on yours, or at least most of the time? You both have your priorities misconstrued. You’re both trying to fix the house and lay brick without the mortar, the glue.”
Eyes locked on one another, neither one of them moved for a tense moment. It was Steve who broke it first, nodding his head toward the living room. “Can I, uh, come in?”
“I learned how to handle it. I buried myself in M.I.T, lab work, trying to carry on Dad’s legacy. In a way, it made me who I am today. It made me Iron Woman. I turned out okay with that situation, and I’ve rather kept myself guarded to make sure that didn’t happen again. Then a certain baby-blue-eyed captain made an appearance into my life, and that all went to shit.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y., I want to be able to access that video in the study,” she commanded shakily. “Make sure that’s possible and have Captain Rogers meet me in there
“What?” She felt like a parrot at this point, repeating the same question. She cleared her throat, trying to find her words. “Okay, wait a minute here. You were literally just jumping down my fucking throat, and now you’re telling me you’ve ‘entertained the idea’ of being with me?”
“What is it, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?”
“...I’m sorry, sir. Unfortunately, we do not have anything as of yet,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. answered.
“Nothin’. Just feels good.”
There stood Steve, his blond locks looking disheveled, his eyes baggy. He wasn’t dressed to the nines either by any means, wearing loose gray sweatpants and a white t-shirt. But damn it if those baby blues weren’t still jaw-dropping and heart-stopping. His beard twitched ever so slightly in a sign of a slight smirk. “Hey there, Toni,” he drawled, voice low.
She fumbled around in her right pocket for her keys, but they were nowhere to be found, which meant they were in her left side. She went to stretch out her chicken wing when she huffed in aggravation.
Tears were stinging her eyes, ones she had been holding back for years, and they were threatening to spill over. “Maybe...maybe I should thank Barnes, if we are able to reverse this. Either that, or punch him in his stupid ass face. If he hadn’t been brainwashed, I wouldn’t have become Iron Woman and chances are, I wouldn’t have met you.”
A thought teased a small, sad smile from his lips. Her admission was a secret to the stars, and last he checked, the sun was a star. His own feelings could be a secret as well, one final thing shared between the two of them.
Toni let out a small sigh before turning to step in the tub. When her foot hit the water, she hissed. The water was boiling. Did that big oaf even have the best internal thermometer?
“I’m following Happy’s orders.”
“Steve…”
After a moment of lamenting, Pepper sucked a deep breath through her nose and huffed it out the next second. She had to regain some sense of composure, if only for a moment. There was, after all, one last task Toni gave her to complete. She intended to see it through.
He scoffed. “I saw those hits you took. That’s more than just a little arthritis, Stark.”
Steve sat at the edge of one of the extended dark emerald couches in the study area, a screen already open in front of him. Photos of every known hero and ally in the Avengers database rotated through the screen with their last known location and status under it.
“You didn’t have to do that. I could’ve gotten my own damn door, especially if I wasn’t in a freakin’ sling! Rogers,” she hissed, pouting at the super soldier who was pacing through her suite, “I’m literally going to struggle to do everything. I’m not even going to be able to wash the filth and sweat out of my hair.”
In a way, she was correct. Her mind kept drifting to the baby-blue-eyed blond. She thought about their initial introduction, how terse and abrasive they were to each other before they finally began to mesh after the death of Agent Coulson. Her recollection showed her the night Ultron broke out of the lab, the moments right before when the team had been drinking together and she and Steve were flashing flirty glances at each other. At least, Toni thought they were flirty. Then again, given her former playgirl title, she could have completely misread everything.
“Miss Stark, you have a visitor,” F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s voice trilled into her bedroom.
She clicked her tongue, trying not to get swept off her feet, keeping her guard up. “If Barnes were here-”
“What’s wrong?”
Tears pricked at the edge of Pepper’s eyes as she watched. They finally spilled over when Toni mentioned the lack of supplies and the low oxygen level.
Pepper’s face illuminated in a soft teal light as F.R.I.D.A.Y. popped up a screen in front of her face. There was a static sound before Toni’s voice reverberated through the bedroom. “Is this thing on?”
“Barnes.”
“Toni?” Steve had asked the ceiling just as the door to the study gradually opened. His attention turned to the woman with puffy red eyes, his heart dropping straight to the pit of his stomach at the sight. Something about the look on Pepper’s face made him think that she had the definitive answer as to the fate of the genius. He swallowed the lump forming in his throat and crossed the room to wrap Pepper in a signature Captain America bear hug.
“Hey, I am loyal,” he growled, “I came when you called, after all. And you were nowhere to be found. You weren’t on the battlefield at Wakanda.”
“You mean the world to me, Steve. If there’s one thing you must know above all else...it’s that I lo-”
He read the status once again, shoulders heaving with a heavy sigh as he reclined back on the sofa. “I really
The moment they landed, however, she wasn’t given much of a choice. Steve grabbed her right arm and all but dragged her into the infirmary. She figured he was going to leave, satisfied that he got her in there, but no. The super soldier of course stayed, because he knew Toni too well and knew she’d take off.
“Right away, ma’am.”
“Toni.”
“You’re the genius,” he quipped, cocking his head to the side. “What’s it sound like?”
“Fuck the Accords!” she seethed. “I made a mistake with those fucking things and I’ve already admitted it. No. This isn’t about the Accords. This is about the other choices you made, specifically the choices you made with Barnes.”
“Hey yourself,” she breathed.
She could feel Steve watching her, waiting for her to explode, either into tears or a ball of rage. Instead, she rose to her feet and began pacing in front of him. “I don’t...I don’t really want to think about it. Yet it’s all I’ve been thinking about all night, trying to write this stupid press release. I just...I want to find a way to reverse it, to bring them all back or just find that bastard and blow his brains out, something!”
Toni merely sniffled in response.
That last question hit a nerve. The strawberry blonde’s mind skirted to her boss and close friend. It had been weeks since she was last seen boarding that craft, before people just disintegrated into ash. Since then, there had been no word from Toni, no sign that she survived the battle or even Thanos’ culling. Pepper assumed the worst, and the questions were just pouring salt in the wound.
She fidgeted in the water a bit. “Now that I’m used to it, not so much. It was scorching when I first climbed in, though.”
“Ugh!” he roared in frustration, stepping away from the billionaire. “Why is everything so complicated with you?” He ran his hands through his hair, eyes locking with hers. “I’m trying to fix this because I just...I can’t do this anymore, Toni. Not with you.”
He rolled his eyes. “Jesus, are we not past that already? I said I was sorry, Toni!” He watched as her chest heaved in anger, and he lowered his voice to try to get her to calm down as well. “I’m sorry. I just...I didn’t want to lose my best friend again.”
Her face had already been heated from the argument with Steve in the meeting, but that idea of pressing her lips to the Captain’s made her blush further. She only hoped Happy couldn’t distinguish the difference. “Ah, yes. One heavy make-out session and boom! Everything will be hunky dory. Why didn’t I think of that?”
When he was satisfied that her hair was damp enough, he turned off the shower head and set it to the side, stretching across the tub to reach an orange bottle. A dollop of the creamy white product poured into a button on his hand before he returned the bottle to its original position. Rubbing his palms together, he lathered up his hands before immediately going to work on her scalp, fingertips massaging the soap into her hair.
His hair trembled as his shook his head, disappearing again behind the bathroom door. The handles of the bathtub squeaked, meaning the tub must have been filled to the right height for the captain.
He twisted in his seat after putting his shades in their holder on the visor, offering her a sad smile. “You’re welcome, Pep.”
someone who’s really having a hard time with Toni’s disappearance.”
Dozens of bulbs blinded Pepper Potts as Happy pulled the town car up to the Avengers compound entrance gate. She shielded her cerulean eyes with a manicured hand momentarily, but it didn’t shield her from the bombardment of reporters shouting at her, demanding answers.
She leaned up on her tiptoes so that she was nearly eye-level with the Captain, squinting into his eyes. “Are you drunk, Steve? Because you sure as hell sound like one. You’re all over the place tonight, man. A possible future? How? We were never an item.”
His cheeks turned crimson red as he set his uniform back down on the counter. “I didn’t mean it in that way. I’m the reason you’re in that sling to begin with. The least I can do is try to help you.”
“No,” she drawled out, shimmying up a little bit and draping her bent arm over his chest with a wink. “I’ll tell ya one thing though, Cap.”
Steve got to say his peace, so he just nodded in response as Toni spoke hers.
“I’ve entertained being an item as well, Steve,” she mumbled, chewing on her lower lip. “When my parents died, specifically my mother...I felt abandoned. Yeah, sure, other people took care of me most of my life, but my parents were still there, even if my father wasn’t Father of the Year material.”
Toni’s first instinct was to stretch the arm, but she winced as pain shot up into her shoulder. She rested her elbow on the left side of the tub as she leaned forward like Steve instructed.
The sensation was delightful to Toni. It had been a long while since she actually went to the salon, and Steve was proving to be quite the expert. She let out a sharp exhale through her nose, then whined when Steve’s fingers stopped.
It was silent in the car as they rolled up the driveway. Happy glanced in his rearview to see Pepper wipe her left eye, no doubt discarding a tear before anyone inside the compound could see. “Y’know, Pep...you can’t just assume Toni’s gone. She could just be taking her time getting home.”
“Having a meeting this soon after the culling was a fabulous idea, Toni,” the billionaire hissed at herself as she locked the door to her suite at the Avengers compound. “Yeah, because everyone was going to have a level head, right?”
After a brief silence to let the super soldier grieve, Pepper twisted on the sofa to him, fresh tears flooding her face. “I...I tried telling her to tell you sooner. Maybe I should have just done something about it myself considering I had to practically tie her shoes.” She tried to offer a lighthearted laugh at the joke, but Steve didn’t even break a smirk. “I’m sorry, Steve.”
Was that supposed to clear everything up? She was just even more confused. She kept her mouth shut, hoping he would elaborate more.
She blinked in confusion. What was he saying, that he thought she was already dead and mourned? “What?”
She snorted in response. “How can we fix this, Steve? Huh? Do you know?”
She craned her neck slightly. “What’re you looking for?”
There was a pause as Happy took what Toni said into consideration before he piped up, “You know, Toni, he’s wrong.”
The decision was made for her, though, when Steve’s lips pressed against hers gingerly. When he pulled away to study her, she closed the distance and kissed him again with more ferocity, more hunger. Steve never faltered, never pulled away. Rather, his muscular arms slithered down to her waist and tugged her in a tight embrace.
“Play him the tape, F.R.I.D.A.Y.”
“When we get back to the compound,” he started, nodding towards her arm, “You’re getting checked out.”
that can get to her and bring her back!”
“We can’t have that now, can we?” His fingers curled around her sopping mane and twisted ever so lightly, letting the excess water drain before he reached over for another bottle on the edge of the tub. He repeated the same process as he had with the shampoo, but this time, he paid more attention to the dangling strands rather than her scalp. Task completed, he pushed himself to his feet and rummaged in one of the nearby cupboards.
“No comment,” she snarled as she pressed her back into the tuxedo black leather of the town car. “Drive on, Happy.”
Iron Woman’s face appeared in the next instant, chestnut hair pulled to the right, heavy bags under her milk chocolate eyes. “Hi, Miss Potts. If you find this recording...don’t feel bad about this.”
Tony swallowed before giving his reply.
Rhodey was leaning against the wall beside the doorway as T’challa and Tony rounded the corner. He smiled softly and leaned up a bit when Tony stopped beside him. T’challa patted Tony on the back rather discreetly before making his way into the room where the team seemed to be lounging around, talking. He took the drink Natasha offered to him before he joined a conversion between Clint and Sam.
“Your family is with me, Mr. Stark.” the gentle voice answered immediately. “and before you claim to have no interest in their whereabouts, know that they have not been and will not be informed of this discussion.”
Then, Steve came to Tony on the helicarrier and smiled at him after he fell from the sky.
Tony was more relieved than he had imagined he would be. Of course, He wouldn’t be singing show tunes with the guy for a while, but at least he didn’t have to worry about tip-toeing around him. It seemed as though he wouldn’t have to do much of that at all, for that matter. Even Clint seemed to have put their disagreement behind him. They were just happy to be home and Tony couldn’t blame them.
The video cut out, and Steve’s hand instantly flew out to bring it back.
He rotated to her backside, which she realized was on full display, causing her to blush harder. The towel slipped through her fingers as he tugged it away, drying off what she would allow him to. “I just worry about you. After everything that’s happened, I am allowed to do that, y’know.”
, Steve. How exactly do you feel?”
As they traipsed down a living quarters corridor, a door creaked open and a freshly shaved muscular blond popped out. His baby blues met Pepper’s ceruleans, and he offered her a small nod as he passed. “Miss Potts.”
A wider smile tugged at his lips this time, making his beard move ever so slightly. “Since I got a second chance with a certain billionaire on possibly borrowed time.”
“You idiot,” she murmured in between ragged breaths. “You absolutely fucking idiot! I told you to tell him.
the leading authority in waiting too long.”
They both emerged from the infirmary two hours after entering, Toni’s left arm in a sling and the Iron Woman suit left in the middle of the room. Steve walked her back to her suite door like the gentleman he was, but she couldn’t help but glare at the captain, raising her bent ligament to make a point. “I’m incapacitated now. Are you satisfied, Captain?”
She braced herself for a lashing, a questioning of where her loyalty was since she hadn’t be there. Instead of harshness and abrasiveness, Steve’s features softened. One of his massive hands came out and brushed against her elbow gingerly, coaxing her to stand down. Her arms fell to her side.
She nearly detached herself from everything outside of her bedroom until a loud knocking was heard on the front door to her suite.
She huffed, her fingers curling around the washcloth and wringing it out as best as she could before draping it over the side of the tub. Swinging her right arm across her torso more freely, she grabbed a bottle of lavender soap and squeezed out a drop before placing the bottle in its empty spot. Folding the cloth over delicately, she rubbed her fingers together against the fabric to try to create a lather. When she was sure the lather was sufficient enough, she rubbed the cloth against her face, scrubbing her cheeks, T-zone and the back of her neck. She continued down her body, being very ginger with her left arm. Rising just a bit so that her chest and abdomen were barely out of the water, she washed those bits too. Her legs proved to be a bit more challenging, but she made do. With her body now lathered up, she rinsed out the washcloth to get the soap out of it before she retraced her bath, scrubbing just a little harder to ensure every sud was off her body.
The carousel of photos disappeared from the screen as F.R.I.D.A.Y. pulled up Toni’s video message. As Toni spoke, he realized why Pepper had been crying. No food, no water, oxygen only till morning. Toni was going to die alone adrift in the cosmos. Even he couldn’t stop the tears threatening to fall.
“Everything seems to be in order, Miss Potts. I did want to inform you...you received a video message...from Boss.”
The captain’s lips formed a straight line. “Seriously? Just pretend it’s still in the sling while I do this. Don’t make it any worse, doll.”
She rotated her shoulder cuff, popping a couple joints and wincing. “Yeah,” she grunted out, “Just an old battle wound flaring up.” And it was. During one of her initial jaunts as Iron Woman, she took a anti-aircraft shell to her left side. She never really checked herself out, thinking the suit took a brunt of the hit. Add years of missions on top of that, and yeah, she was probably a little worse for wear.
The man in the front gave all the reporters a glare through his dark sunglasses as he started to press his foot on the gas, leaving the throngs of journalists behind.
He didn’t respond as he continued to rummage. It was a minute before he stood upright again and turned to the tub, dropping a beige washcloth in the water while holding on to a large navy blue towel. “You need to let that sit a minute, right? Why don’t you go ahead and wash off a little bit more and I’ll come back in a few to finish up?”
Steve Rogers sat across from her aboard the quinjet as they made their way back to the Avengers compound from an Infinity Stone recovery mission. His baby blue eyes watched her intensively. “Doin’ okay, Stark?”
“Yes please.”
She was about to sass him about that remark not being fair when he dropped the towel and leaned over to grab the huge fuzzy blanket. She could feel him fanning it out behind her. The fabric then hugged against her body, encasing her in its (and Steve’s) warmth. She clutched at the front of the blanket to make sure it stayed closed. A hum trilled from her throat as she leaned back against the super soldier.
He rounded the corner from the bathroom, and Toni couldn’t help but gawk at the sight in front of her. He had peeled the top layer of his navy blue suit away, revealing a white v-neck t-shirt while still leaving his pants and boots in place. His shooting gloves had been discarded, replaced with a burgundy hand towel as he wrung his hands dry. A small smirk played at the corner of his lips.
When Happy was sure Steve was out of earshot, he leaned in to Pepper as they continued walking. “
Happy was the first one out of the car in order to open Pepper’s door for her. Once she adjusted her pencil skirt, he escorted her into the main building.
There was a rumble in his chest, a soft laugh as he continued to work the soap through her roots, down her strands. Finished with his work, his fingers curled around the shower head again.
“No...no, no, no,
else?” he interrupted, jumping to his feet and pacing around. “All this fucking technology, we have to have
Maybe then Pepper and that spider kid, Peter Parker, would have still been around.
His gaze shifted back to her as his best friend’s name fell like acid from her lips. Apparently, she wasn’t done arguing just yet. He braced himself for whatever verbal lashing she had in store for him.
“You haven’t either.” He leaned back, calloused hand reaching around to rub his neck. “It’s difficult to think about sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I lose all of them again. I see Vision, Wanda, T’challa…”
The former Stark Industries CEO was fairly certain her heart stopped in a split second. Had she heard F.R.I.D.A.Y. correctly? She swallowed thickly before responding. “Repeat that,” she muttered.
His eyebrows shot up in curiosity before he placed one hand on the small of Pepper’s back, leading her to the sofa he was previously perched on. “How old is the video message?”
His eyes fixated on the next photo in the rotation: a woman with lengthy caramel hair and hot chocolate eyes that could melt any soul. He should know. They certainly thawed him out more than he thought possible.
Until suddenly, he wasn’t.
“You weren’t there,” he reiterated, “And I was terrified, Toni. That was the last communication I had from you and you weren’t there when I saw everyone else disappear. I assumed the worst. I assumed that I lost you again, in a way that hurt worse than losing you over Bucky.”
“Natasha 'Toni' Stark: MISSING.”
Her knees were buckling, her reserve fading. She wanted to be angry. She wanted to be furious, to push him away because he betrayed her, abandoned her. The harsh reality of it was, though, she would have made the same calls. He was right; they had this second chance in front of them, and if she didn’t take it, she would end up kicking herself later on.
He couldn’t help the small tug of relief that formed over his lips, but just as quickly as it had formed, it fell again. Toni had survived the culling, which was a tremendous relief. That meant that she was out there somewhere. With the expanse of the universe, who knew where “out there” really was, and Pepper’s face when she first entered didn’t promise good news.
“I suspected you might have needed a bit more time to adjust to being in shared spaces again.” Tony watched as T’challas’s dark eyes roamed around his workshop. The king’s lips twitched upwards as he scanned the room with an almost sentimental look about him. Tony wondered if he was thinking of his sister’s lab back home. They sat in comfortable silence for a while before T’challa turned back to him. He studied Tony for a few moments before saying softly, “I don’t think they will behave the way you imagine, Tony.”
“Well, you will have to forgive me,” Tony answered plainly. “Unfortunately, the last time I let my defenses down, it didn't pan out very well for me. Or my ribs, for that matter.” He heard T’challa sigh on the other end of the line. “But sure, KitKat. Since you want me to trust you so much, we might as well be on a first-name basis.”
“When you say my family, You are referring to who?” Tony questioned. He knew, of course, what T’challa meant, but he couldn’t allow the Rogues to have so much leeway over him anymore - addressing them as ‘his family’ was not a step in the right direction.
As for a certain captain - nothing more than the bare minimum would be given. It wasn’t Tony being petty, he
“You know I am glad to see you for many reasons,” he said earnestly. “The main one being that you gave me an out from what was sure to be the most awkward interaction of my life.” T’challa undid the button of his suit as he settled onto the stool.
Rhodey was his rock, like always. Tony refused to give details until they both returned to a semblance of good health, but once he did, the floodgates opened. He spent hours ranting to his best friend about how livid and betrayed he felt.
Tony still felt a little uneasy as he chatted about unimportant things with the group at the table. For a few minutes, he had forgotten all about his rules. They hadn’t even been here a full day and he had already caved a little.
It took a very long time for Tony to be comfortable with the Avengers, but after many arguments with himself about the pros and cons, he managed to believe that maybe this could be a good thing. He had let himself want it. Steve had looked him in the eye and said, ‘together,’ and Tony had been reassured.
“Well then,” T’challa said, standing and buttoning his jacket. “It would be cruel to let him - what is it? ‘Fly solo’ any longer.”
“Funny,” Tony said doubtful, “That is almost exactly what Vision said.” He twisted a screwdriver around in his hand as the king continued to look at him. After a minute, Tony chuckled, and T’challa looked at him questioningly.
T’challa watched the scientist for a moment before focusing on his own shoes. It was disquieting to see Tony rebuilding his defenses like it was nothing more than straightening his tie. He knew there was nothing he could say to convince the man it wasn’t necessary.
P.S. I also apologize for the inconsistency in terms of page layout. I still haven't gotten used to AO3's mechanics. Not sure if I will ever be able to figure it out be I will keep trying lol
He couldn’t afford to do that.
That being said, he had to remind himself of the rules he had set out. Tony couldn’t let them in - not really. He had been happy with them before and it didn’t stop them from leaving him. He refused to be caught unawares again so he would smile and be what they expected him to. He wouldn’t forget how excruciating it had been to lose them all and he wouldn’t allow himself to care as he had before. Tony would force that thought to the forefront if he ever got too comfortable and if he was lucky - he would be able to have them all close to him without letting them have even a bit of his heart.
It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as they say. T’challa and Tony spoke every day for the following six months, whether it be strategizing about UN negotiations or T’challa updating Tony on the Rogues. Tony gave up pretending not to care about two weeks after their first phone call. The king would have none of it, so he figured he might as well save his breath.
“Your majesty, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
When it came down to it, the world was more afraid of what could happen without them than the potential damage that came with saving the world. It just took some reminding from the only active-duty Avenger left. Rhodey was still trying to walk by himself, and he was in no condition to help Tony should a threat arise. Vision was always disappearing for days at a time, and he wasn’t very talkative when he was around. Tony was good, but he couldn’t handle an Avenger-level threat alone. The UN understood as much and became much more open to amendments to get the Rouges back on their side.
“Rhoades,” Tony said quietly. He moved his head in a, please don’t make this a problem gesture, but Natasha didn’t seem surprised by his response and nodded once before looking back at Tony.
“Being the only active avenger to work with the UN on a three thousand page document to get you back in the country does that to a person.” Rhodey didn’t sound sardonic or even very angry. He simply spoke as if making an observation.
Though Ross wasn’t having the time of his life anyway, the combined force of Tony and T’challa was a bit more than he had bargained for, it seemed. As a result, he was losing traction with the UN. Tony explained why the Rogues had refused to stand down during the ‘civil war’ - as the press was calling it. It was surprisingly easy to make the delegates see their side after learning that there was an army of super-soldiers at Zemo’s disposal. If he had intended to use rather than kill them, they would have needed the Avengers to help.
And then, Ultron - and Sokovia.
“Hey, man.” He said seriously. “I - uh, I said a few things the last time we met that I didn’t - “ Clint cleared his throat and broke eye contact with Tony before starting again. “Well, - “
Tony’s nails were digging into his palms. He might have worried about drawing blood if he had any conscious train of thought besides trying to keep his face composed. He almost wished he was in the tower so that he could relish the elevator ride. But, instead, he had to force his feet to carry him through the Compound. He was sure it would have been easier actually to walk to the gallows. T’challa remained a steady presence beside him which he appreciated, and he wondered if he could hear Tony’s heart beating. He spared a second to be concerned about that, considering he did have a heart condition but quickly refocused his attention when he heard the voices of his… team? - right down the hall.
That complicated things for Tony in multiple ways. He was so used to being alone that having five new roommates was a bit of an adjustment. It didn’t help that all of these new roommates had almost as much baggage as he did. The trust issues alone were a huge challenge, but they had to work through it if they were going to get rid of Hydra. It was slow going for a long time, but once they became familiar with each other and broke past the initial discomfort, it was a whole new ball game. They fell into a rhythm on and off mission.
