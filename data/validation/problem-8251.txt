“Tony,” he breathes, “Tony, wake up.”
Steve closes his eyes and clenches his fists, pained, and recited the string of numbers plus a demure: “Captain Handsome.”
“Well,” Jacey smiles, “that’s one way to win points with me.”
“Mr. Stark, himself, has not been available to make a statement, but we have his word that he’ll–” The woman frowns and touches her headset, “What did you say?” Her face widens into a look of utter horror. “Stan,” she says to someone off-screen, “I need you to re-route to the Avengers Tower.
So, she inhales and knocks on the bedroom door. She's delayed long enough.
"You've gotta be shittin' me."
Jacey takes a deep breath and sits beside him on the cold metal bench. This is definitely not how she saw this going. She folds her hands in her lap and waits.
Fuck. He’s dehydrated, he’s hungry, and he’s got to pee. Dammit.
“Then I can’t respect you, buddy. Sorry, it’s like a ball: gotta have the invitation.”
. Tall trees, waterfalls, grass so green it was almost flourescent, and stunning wildlife and plantlife. It was absolutely marvelous. Tony could stand here and look at it all day.
Tony immediately thinks of Obadiah. God, he’d been so blind. His own… his own
Tony sometimes thought that everything would be better if he'd just never told anyone he was Iron Man.
Tony hears a crackling whooshing sound and looks behind the couch to see Stephen Strange walking out of his weird glowing portal thing-y.
Clint grits his teeth. "Hey, no. If I've learned anything in all the years we've worked together it's that if I say something when I'm angry and bitter I'm usually 120% wrong. Alright? It probably wasn't your fault, or even if it was, it was probably a bunch of our faults, too."
“You vill respect me! I hold you captive and I vill get the information I desire!”
–he gets this unspeakable desire to just murder it. To tear it apart with his bare hands and

?” The witch demands.
1. Spiritual companion or soulmate. The highest/deepest level of bond ever recorded in humanity’s history. Exceptionally rare. May develop from a henkō; one in one million chance.
“Postive reinforcement does wonders,” he chuckles. He looks out the window and sees the blue, blue sky and fluffy white clouds. And, he thinks that it really, really does. “Well, you also helped me make peace with Howard.”
“I understand. You’re lucky I was in town for a convention, Mr. Stark, otherwise you would have had to be hospitalized for sure.”
"Need to push!" He shouts. "I can't--! I have to-- they're
They walk away and realize maybe they’d lost more than they thought they had. It’s not a good feeling.
Rogers grins back. "I'll bet." His face turns serious again. "What about secret identities?"
“Tolerant? Aw, you’ve got a sense of humor. Excellent. I’ve always wanted an audience to laugh at my killer jokes.” Tony grins.
“Yeah,” a man who must be Stan answers, “I’m getting it. Switching channels now.”
” Steve sighs.
Steve’s jaw drops and then he purses his lips. He nods.
“Oh, Tony,” she gasps, “I’m sorry– I didn’t mean to–” she blubbers, “Damn it, Metallica, now you’ve gotten me started.”
P.S. Endgame didn't happen. what are you talking about? my fic is still canon. ish. mostly. idk. i don't wanna taco bout it.
He leaps and grabs Tony by the elbow to stop the smaller man, unintentionally exerting too much force that it jerks the billionaire backwards. Steve instantly lets go of his grip, horrified that he may have hurt his friend, making everything worse. They look at each other, and all Steve could see in Tony's watery eyes was discomfort. He then notices the kiss-swollen lips that he had been devouring just moments ago.
“Captain, if I may,” JARVIS speaks, as though the AI had been listening to his thoughts.
Taking that as his cue, Steve twists his body to dig into the box he carried with him and came back with-
But Tony was not ready to talk.
Tuesday afternoons were Steve and Tony's little secret.
"Yup. That's a yes, by the way."
He was finally back in New York, and ready to crash into anything between the driveway of his garage to the grease-stained cot in his lab. But since JARVIS was a sneaky AI with too much personality, he insisted that Tony visited the common floor before he caught up with his much needed sleep. Tony was irritable, already grumpy from the lack of rest. To make matters worse, the drink that Happy picked up for him was not his usual order, and it was diabolical.
“Holy shit, you made me Iron Man cookies,” he says, shaking his head in disbelief.
“It’s hazelnut macchiato,” Tony sing-songs, tempting his blue-eyed crush.
Steve looks up from the carton he was twiddling. "You really like watching people, don't you?" Steve asks, his tone half-scolding.
The three purpling blotches on Tony's skin that trail from his jawline down to his collarbone makes everything even more confusing. Steve's throat collapses to the sight, evidence of him marking Tony that way. He was sure he had very similar marks on the same spots on his body, but the serum would have taken cared of it in an hour. There was no time to think about that now; for once in his life he followed his heart instead of his head, and he's paying the price by having his best friend looking torn and miserable.
Tony: You've opened the floodgates. I'm feeling super sappy right now :(
Steve's smile slowly fades into a shy purse of lips.
Steve straightens his back and closes the door of the fridge before he meets Clint's eyes. Instead of breaking into something cheeky, Clint had a stoic expression on his face and says nothing. He looks almost sorry.
It was hand-delivered to Queens the very next day.
Tony turns his body so he was facing Steve. He kept the towel pressed to his cheekbone though, but he reaches out to cup Steve's face with his free hand. Almost pliantly, Steve closes his eyes and leans into him.
spending time together in private.
It was enough for Steve to flush a bright shade of red. When the brunette draws back, Steve couldn't resist touching his face where Tony had pressed his lips against. Steve couldn't help but grin like a cheshire cat.
"You've been holding back on me, Steve," Tony says when they break for air, still drunk on the taste of his crush.  Tony peppers Steve's jaw line with kisses, inhaling his sweet scent. "God you're intoxicating."
"Not on Tony?"
"Wasn't forward at all. I like it. You can do that anytime you want," Tony says in a low, husky voice.
"Uh." Tony force coughs. "Clint can have red bean. I need to throw up, be right back."
"That is not what this is about, Stark." Steve's face began to heat up. Is Tony really going to ask him to spell his feelings out? It didnt make sense to Steve either when he first came to terms with his feelings. Falling in love with someone who infuriates him on a daily basis made him feel like a ten year old boy trying to get a rise from a playground crush. Except that he wasn't pelting mud balls into the neighbour's daughter's hair to get her attention.
“I know but it’s a lot for anyone to deal with. Especially you, and you’ve got your own –“
going out. For a session with her. It's my last one actually, for now at least."
Oh that smile. That sheepish, half-smile and microscopic frown.
"Remarkably well."
"Excuse me?"
"Honey, I'm fine," Tony assures with a smile. There was a small bruise just above his left cheekbone and Steve was dying to kiss it better.
Reading fan-mail together was a weekly affair for a pair of superheroes.
"Seems simple enough for you to walk right up here and kiss me?"
"Go out with me, Steve. Let me take you out. We can grab a cheeseburger and shakes if you want. Or I can wine and dine you like a gentleman that I'm known to be from time to time. Whatever you're comfortable with."
He breaks into a silly grin. He thanks Tony’s trusted assistant and starts to leave his room, but he halts two steps away from the door. “JARVIS, could you uh check if Tony needs anything? Has he eaten since I - I mean
He swallows nervously.
If this was any other day, Steve would probably start to sheepishly excuse himself. But not tonight. He was tired. He was heart broken. He much rather not have a conversation about being rejected by Tony with anyone, but since Clint has always been the most openly supportive of Steve and Tony 'getting it on', Steve was somewhat thankful that of all people, it was the archer who he had bumped into.
Steve snorts, but Tony could feel him take a whiff of him right by his neck. It was almost as though Steve was scenting him. It’s a good thing that he decided to take a shower before he took the jet back from Malibu. Anytime now, Steve could just back off. But he doesn’t. They stay that way in what felt like an eternity of bliss, Steve’s chest almost plastered on Tony’s back, his hands on Tony’s forearms. Taking a chance, Tony leans back and looks up to Steve, wiggling his eyebrows to keep the moment playful and not full on sexual.
“It is nice to see you again Mr. Stark.” He shakes Tony hand. “Although, I wish it was under different circumstances.”
“Contributing fifty percent of her DNA doesn’t make you a father! It makes you a sperm donor!” Tony screams.
“Put on this gown, the opening in the back. You can leave your underwear on,” Shuri cuts in a no-nonsense tone.
Tony isn’t oblivious, he knows Steve is avoiding answering him, but he says nothing and Steve is grateful he doesn’t push. He does, however, give Steve a side-eye that says he hasn’t let it go.
“Okay,” Maria says without any fight. She takes the cracker from Steve’s hand and quietly begins to nibble away at it.
Tony’s shoulders slump back down at the sound of his daughter’s name on Steve’s lips and he goes over to the sofa and collapses on to it. It’s clear he’s holding on by a thread. Steve hates seeing Tony this way and not being able to comfort him. All he wants to do is hold Tony.
“Come on. You know how I feel about this whole situation, but nothing’s changed so why are we plotting murder now?”
“Hey now,” Steve says walking over to Nat and taking the crackers from her. He sits down on the sofa next to Maria. “That’s not very nice. You should say sorry to Nat and Wanda. They’re only trying to help.”
“What am I gonna do?” He says sliding back into the chair. “Your father, he’s - well I hate to be the one to tell you this, but he’s a pain. He always manages to get under my skin like no one else. It amazes me how one person can be so arrogant! Sometimes he makes me so angry and… I don’t know… I still love your father. More than I’d care to admit. But that doesn’t really matter much anymore. He’s doing much better now. I can see that. Maybe it was me. Maybe I was the one holding him back. You’re proof of that. If we’d worked out, you never would have been born,” Steve confesses. It’s like a weight has been lifted off his chest. “And speaking of, where’s your mother? Who is she? Why wouldn’t she be here with you? I guess with Tony you can never be too sure. Honestly, I’m surprised there are only two of you. With the way your father carried on, I would have thought there’d be more Starks running around.”
“Every day, when I go to work, he spends the day with her, playing with her, getting close to her,”
“Can you blame me?” Tony says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “It’s what you do isn’t it?! You disappear when things get hard!”
- I love you
Nat tries one more time with almost the same results, the only difference being that this time Maria looks like she on the verge of tears.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony says, wiping away tears Steve hadn’t noticed before. Everything inside him is screaming for him to reach out and brush away the tears himself.
“So I’ll give it to them.”
“I don't know, Steve. I don’t know anymore. I thought I knew you, but you lied to me. You hid so much from me. Please don’t insult my intelligence and pretend it was to spare me. You did it for him. You chose him over me. So what I supposed to think? Hmmm, Steve. Tell me. Tell me what I'm supposed to think? How am I supposed to believe you? Trust you?”
Steve backs away quickly and heads around a corner.
He takes one of the many bikes Tony had given him over the years. He’s surprised they are all still there. His garage is frozen in time. Everything is exactly the way he left it, as though Tony closed the door and never looked back. He rolls the bike all the way down the back road before he turns it on. Sneaking out of the house makes him feel like he’s doing something wrong.
“Why not?” Tony says at the same time, giving Steve a side glance, that’s far from friendly.
“I’m her father too!”
“She hooked the IV bag up and left.”
“She’d only hurt herself if she didn’t know how to use it and she’ll never know how to use it unless she tries. I’m here, I’m watching her. I don’t believe in having ‘kid friendly’ versions of things. We use these utensils and so will she. There’s no point in getting her used to something she’s going to have to give up,” Tony finishes in a voice that dares anyone to question him as a parent.
“Hopefully they’ll have better luck,” Steve says. “I don’t understand how no one can tell us anything.”
“Steve?” Tony calls out to him, breaking his downward spiral.
“Do I make myself clear?” Steve asks. “Do I?” he asks again a bit louder.
“Damn it! I keep telling them we have to keep that sheet up front!”
Steve does his best to swallow the lump in his throat and answer. “I… We… She was crying for you so I was bringing her to you and I felt her tense up in my arms. I’m so sorry Tony. I don’t know what I could have done to set it off. She was fine, well warm, but awake one second and out the next. I’m so sorry.”
“Hi, Papa,” Alana calls out from the doorway. She walks in and places a kiss on his temple.
“What are you seeing?” he asks.
- You're impossible!
“I never wanted to have to come to one of these places,” Clint adds.
“Nat, you don’t have to stay with me. Go find Clint and Wanda and have a good time. Instead of looking after an old man,” he tells her as she hands him a scotch neat.
“When I was a little baby?” She asks.
“I extracted your more unique qualities from the sample,” he explains. “All the doctors will have to do is see if it will be in any way helpful to her.”
“Wow, very well said,” Tony says, eyebrows raised and eyes wide. “And since I am now fifteen minutes behind schedule, I’m gonna go. Great talking with you Rogers.”
- Everything, Papa.
“What are you doing here so early?” Tony asks.
“How-”
“DEATH THREATS MADE AGAINST MARIA STARK”.
“I should have known better than to think that I could have anything good in my life. I couldn’t keep my mother, Steve left, so why would I get to have my daughter be happy and healthy? I’m not meant to have anything good in my life. I’m cursed and she’s suffering for it.”
“All joking aside, please go and enjoy yourself Nat. This will probably be the only time we’ll be able to have a good time all together.”
“Steve… that's not,” Tony says cautiously, as though he’s only just realizing the magnitude of Steve’s reaction.
“I tossed that thing a long time ago.”
“Nice try, kid. Get your work done. And just to keep you honest, I’m going to make sure that Friday doesn’t let you in until she checks your homework.”
“Goodnight Tony,” he says to an empty room.
Steve tugs on Tony’s hand and leads him over to a bench near Maria. Steve drops down like a hunk of stone. He rests his elbows on his knees and slams him face down into his hands. “I’m so sorry, Tony. This is all my fault. God, I’m so sorry.”
“She’s going to wake up,” he says out loud, not completely sure if he’s trying to reassure himself or Tony.
. Tony thanks her and he hears her say,
“Fine, but for now, can we call a truce. Maria is the only thing that matters. Princess Shuri is going to do a bone marrow transplant in a few days. She thinks that it may help reverse the damage that has been caused by the virus.”
He sits down on their big, cold, empty bed and down his drink. He runs his hand across the space Steve once occupied. He can’t keep the tears at bay. He’s so lonely. There are times when wakes up and feels Steve next to him. He can almost feel Steve’s finger roaming across his body and he aches from it. He sees Steve in the corner of the room. He wants to reach out for him and he hates himself. He’s sick, he’s twisted to still love Steve so much. He hates him, but Steve’s still the only man on his mind. He’s tried to move on, to find someone new. He’d dated Aiden for months and every time he touched Tony, all he could only picture Steve. Amazingly, it hadn’t worked out. He couldn’t be so selfish. He couldn’t hurt someone else like that.
The line is quiet for a minute before Rhodey answers. “I’m sorry I can’t be there, but one of has to be here to hold back the vultures. What going on there? How’s Maria?”
“Don’t be-” Rhodey says as Tony hangs up on him.
When they get word that there’s a possibility for things with the Accords to change, Steve jumps at the opportunity. They all know none of them are going to change their minds, but it isn’t a secret what Steve’s true motivations for agreeing are. No one says anything, they all jump at the chance to see their friends again. They’re told that Tony would be hosting them in his home upstate. From what Steve knows Tony spends most of his time there, away from prying eyes. It makes sense. It’s a safe place to raise his daughter. Tony sends a car to pick them up and bring them to the house, where he already has their rooms arranged and waiting for them. Steve had hoped he’d get a chance to talk to Tony alone, but the moment doesn’t present itself. He goes to the room picked out for him and sighs as he sits on the edge of the bed. It’s an amazing room, beautiful in design, leaving nothing to be desired, except for its location on the opposite end from where the master bedroom is, from where Tony is. He knew Tony would be angry and hurt, but he truly didn’t think that years later he’d still feel as strongly as he did.
Cho follows Rhodes's line of sight. "Shit."
"The 'doc'?" The alien prompts gently.
"Certainly." And he's gone.
and he certainly doesn’t use the word “fuck”. Steve’s lips quirk up at her surprise, but he doesn’t say anything. He just turns his head and looks down in shame.
“... are you not aware of Mr. Stark’s paranoia? There are ways to get in the Tower.” Cho inspects her nails and waits.
Tony’s heart twists and his head is spinning. No. Steve can’t– Steve can’t do this to him. No. It takes everything Tony has to not start sobbing right there. It’s almost too good to be true.
I'm going to sincerely apologize right now because of feels. also: WARNING! IF YOU SUDDENLY FIND YOURSELF IN A PUDDLE OF TEARS AND FEELS WHILE FEELING LIKE YOU'VE GOTTEN YOUR HEART RIPPED OUT I AM NOT LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF TISSUES OR ICE CREAM YOU GO THROUGH
He hears a window shatter and then a crashing sound from the living room.
"I'd like to see a warrant," he bites out to the invaders, "considering you're breaking and entering without probable cause."
Siberia? How about Vienna and Romania? What the
“Who’s it?” He garbles from where he’s hunched over the toilet.
“That’s understandable,” Strange nods, “why were you in that Hydra cell?”
“Not about this. About
’ was the last thing he told me. Yinsen… He only… the Ten Rings drugged me once. Tried to get me to suffer, I guess, or comply. Probably both, but it was an experimental heat-inducer. Yinsen helped me through it. When it was over… I felt different. It wasn’t until they tried to drug me again that I realized why.”
Fury purses his lips. “I’m tempted to kick you off the team for all you’ve done, but we need all the eyes we can get to search for Stark. You’re lucky Thor and Banner aren’t here, otherwise I would sack you without a second thought. You hear me, Rogers? You’re in deep shit and you’re going to be spending a long time cleaning up this mess you’ve made. Got it?”
A pop...?
“...Could you… tell me about you and Arthur?”
“Yeah?” Steve’s hopeful smile makes her teeth ache.
“My, so polite this one! Say, Vision, I am going to be leaving, so do you think you could entertain him for me?”
For God’s sake. He just wants to go back to his tower and sleep in his massive, California-king size bed. He also wants his HD TV that gets more than 50 channels in low-quality resolution. Honestly, it’s like this hospital is living back in the
They share a nudge of arms and go back to looking at the view.
“Hello, Captain. And, to the rest of you.” They all nod and chorus hellos.
“Trust me, Rogers, you will want to see.”
Tony’s eyes crinkle. “Anything for you, Tash.”
Hercules, legit super-villains...what the hell is wrong with this universe?!
“He’s very weak right now, no thanks to you–”
For a brief moment, he worries about the invasion. About Thanos. But, he's out of time. Like Jacey had warned. Jacey is whispering things in his ears and he feels her tears and eyelashes on his face. She's saying she's sorry and that she's useless. She says she loves him and that she'll miss him. She doesn't want him to leave, like Arthur did. Doesn't want to have another grave to visit because Strange is busy and he's unlikely to be able to help in time. She's sorry.
So Tony's first official assignment to Hill when she joined him was to convince the good Captain to leave DC and move back to Manhattan.
Steve knows this one. Coincidence? He hopes not.
imaging Steve's interest in him was beyond all that is platonic.
be a problem, but the God of Thunder was more honourable than most people. In all likelihood, if the Prince of Asgard bumped into Steve in the state he was in, he would respect Steve's wishes to keep the encounter confidential, with no questions asked.
Captain America minus the uniform was a sight to behold.
He experiments, he takes risks.
"I like you just fine," Steve murmurs to himself, getting ready to leave, knowing full well that Tony wouldn't be able to hear him.
"As my date," Steve parrots into his neck, trying his darnest not to lick at Tony's veins.
On the off chance that there was no world-ending alien invasion, a mission that would take them off the grid for weeks, or an Avengers PR event that required hours of schmoozing and socialising, Steve would religiously go to the mail room on Tuesday afternoons and go through the hundreds of fan-mail delivered to the team every week, ranging from soft toys to sketches, even undergarments and expensive art pieces.
Steve: Can't and won't ignore you.
,” Steve starts. “
A cold chill runs down the Captain's spine now, as he watches Tony's body language that screams regret. A mistake.
"Meet me at the hangar first when you get back," was all that it said.
Steve couldn't help but frown, feeling a little insulted. "That's unfair. Look, Tony, if you're having a change of heart after all that, I'll respect your decision. I'll back off. But forgive me if I got carried away from the way you were ripping my shirt off." Steve glances down at himself; his belt buckle was unlatched and his zipper was pulled all the way down. He purposely made a show of correcting his pants, before meeting Tony's eye again. Just to emphasise his point.
Steve swallows hard.
Steve chuckles, a small rumble in his tone. He breaks the KitKat bar of four in half, splitting it to share. The second he hands Tony his share, he bites across his own bars
"It's a Chanel knockoff."
"You know I am," Tony says, almost coming out as a jogged whisper. His gaze was soft and electrifying at the same time and it never fails to boil Steve's cheeks.
. What are you baking, Cap? Channeling your inner Martha Stewart?”
, he reminds himself.
"He likes you Cap," Clint adds. "Whatever that was about, just give him time. Stark's a little messed up, heck we all are, me especially but it's no secret that he's into you. That you both are into each other."
what his favourite Disney cartoon is. He's asking Captain America.”
Tony bolts to the sink. He doesn't vomit, but he might as well since he can't seem to do anything right today. When he comes back with a glass of water in hand, he notices that Steve has started writing again. He has a sad frown on his face though, and Tony knew he couldn't pretend that he didn't say what he'd say. This was not how he had envisioned his confession to be like, but since the cat's out of the bag, he might as well ride the waves.
Tony tilts his head down so Steve can see his eyes. He blinks slowly. "Um. No one's? I've been through one Super-sized Civil War already, and that was one time too many for my lifetime, so I'm good, thanks."
Really. He’s fine with it. He’s fine.
Tony firmly objects and concludes he’s allergic. Yep.
After that... well... it's a bit difficult not to fall in love with the ginormous teddy bear all over again. He won't admit that either. He does have some self preservation, believe it or not.
As always, comments ARE LOVE AND I SQUEAL AND I LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE ANDDDDD HEREEE WE GOOOO~! enjoy!
i'm so emotional right now. *blubbers* i just... i never thought i'd get to 20k+ viewers or get as many awesome comments that I squeal and obsess over and re-read because i'm a sentimental sap and i love all of you just SO MUCH AND THIS CHAPTER WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ACTUAL PLOT GOD DAMMIT
the way I–” Steve’s voice and body shutters to a halt. His face has drained of all color and he seems to have had some kind of epiphany. By the dread and self-loathing and revulsion on his face, it wasn’t a good one.
Tony screams as another contraction comes out of nowhere. "J-Jay... babies...
Steve doesn’t react the way Tony thinks he would. Steve’s kicked puppy routine had been convincing; a truly Oscar-worthy performance. Steve’s temper snaps, and he yells back. “Lie to you?” He snarls, “You mean like you lied to me? About Ultron? About The Accords?”
Steve is running ridiculously fast around the park Jacey tracks him to. She’d maybe admire the rippling muscles bulging out of his too-tight white T-shirt if she didn’t know how self-righteous he is.
"No, no, no, no! Not yet! Not yet! Stay with me, Stark!" He opens his necklace with a spell and uses the Time Stone to cast a very complex, very ancient spell. He's not sure it's going to work. He prays to whatever gods there are that it does. The world can't afford to lose it's greatest hero. It can't. He's the only one... Tony is the only one who can
More blasts follow; more bombs. The windows shatter inwards and cover Steve in shards of glass and dust. He blinks and coughs.
“But, listen, I– Cap needed help and Tony was–”
his wife spits out the name as if it offends her to even speak it,
. This, though,
“Tony has decided to watch the Kardashians,” her mouth twitches like she’s about to lose it again.
Tony and Steve's conversation at the coffee shop continue for the next hour. Tony just barely manages to convince Steve to talk to Stark and come together as a team. The Captain is more than just
“Go ahead, Rogers, tell him. Tell him what you did to Tony in Siberia.” There’s a fierce, raging fire in her eyes and Steve folds his hands in his lap. He looks down, ashamed.
“What do you think that kind of guilt would have done to him, Captain? It would’ve destroyed him. So, yes, he would’ve beat Barnes to a pulp, but the man’s a deadly assassin, a partial supersoldier, and an alpha. I think Barnes could’ve defended himself. Plus Tony would’ve stopped eventually. Probably would’ve gone numb and boneless and broken down in tears. I know that, so why don’t you?”
“Alpha? Anyone?”
Arthur E. Kirk
Steve runs through the streets and sidewalks to get to the Mansion. He’s made such a huge, egregious mistake. He used to stick up for Tony against the bullies--the naysayers, but instead he became one himself. How could he have--?
“I saw… it does not matter, I guess, but I am sorry, for what it’s worth. I am grateful, Stark.”

The news channel is featuring Tony Stark because of course it is. The anchorwoman is talking about everything Tony has done to bring peace back to the people and all the philanthropy he’s shown to the families of victims as well as various charitable organization in the past year. Then she goes on to talk about the changes being made in the Accords and all the amendments that are being enacted.
"What have you done?" Strange asks quietly toward the alien.
“Nope. So, they went back to their first favorite. I escaped… later. I don’t know.”
The lights flicker. Tony shuts his eyes and breathes out.
“No– I was just– I don’t know. I was just trying to make him stop fighting Bucky, but I– I went too far.”
"What the hell?"
Steve decided it was a losing battle and just followed the king. It turns out the king was right. He didn’t believe it.
Her walkout is quite satisfying. It remains so as she gets to the sidewalk.
Steve just looks shell-shocked. “He–”
“My ma would be ashamed,” he murmurs brokenly.
Rhodey and Tony glare at him. "Uh, yeah, you kind of do. I'm American; I have rights. My lawyers are going to have a field day with you," Stark threatens.
, and it's so hard..."
“But I mean I was with my family during puberty,” he enquires seriously.
“Steve?” Sam looks at him questioningly.
“I want to know your intentions,” her voice is even, but cold.
Fate be damned.
Pepp—Ms. Potts, is a base-line female human. Beta, is what people called it these days, but Tony never cared what the public thought. An omega/beta relationship was fairly common, if only because betas are 60% of the population (alphas are 30%, and omegas are 10%).
Jacey tosses her more red than blonde strawberry-blonde locks over her shoulder and wrinkles her nose. “Pumpkin is better. Besides,” she smirks, “I know you love my blueberry pie too much to ever let me go.”
Over and over again.

That seems to be an incorrect answer because Ugly squeezes harder. Tony coughs and chokes some more. Where are his emergency protocols? His drones? Why are they not activating? What the

Tony looks down at his leg and feels sick. He hurts everywhere. Oh God. No. Please No. “Where… where am I bleeding, Steve?”
Warmth floods Tony's stomach and he grabs Jacey's hand to put it on his massive belly. "There," he murmurs, "do you feel it?"
Instead, everything was over before it even began. Dead and destroyed before it even had the chance to be something… spectacular. It’d been something that Tony had sorely needed in his life, but now all he’s got is an empty compound, an empty tower, and an empty heart.
Jacey grinds her teeth and looks furious. “Dammit.” Then her eyes go wide and she looks as though some puzzle pieces have slotted in to place. “Tony, after he died did you experience something that might have been a heat but was too minor– maybe a low-grade fever and more of a sexual appetite?”
They both crack up laughing, and Tony finally feels something loosen in his chest. He's relieved. Cho is looking at them with a smile and gentle eyes, she looks relieved too. Tony was almost certain he'd forgotten how to laugh or smile since Ultron.
Tony rubs his belly anxiously. Things have gone from bad to
Tony gapes. “We can’t be friends if you don’t like apple pie more than pumpkin!”
Her next smile is a bitter one. One that knows burdens nobody should have to carry on their own.  "No. It's more like... destiny. Ironically, the Hulk is a Being too."
“Besides,” Tony stiffens, “I did call you a double agent. I should apologize.”
Jacey tsks. “You’re not just saying that because you know his orientation, now, are you?”
Reed lifts his shoulder and lets it drop in a sheepish half-shrug.
"L-Luciana Margaret," Tony whispers - his voice mild and soft.
“You– I was wrong about you that day on the helicarrier. You’re more than just a suit of armor, Tony.” Steve’s blue blue eyes are so very sincere and Tony wants to cry. “You’re so much more, and I have never been happier to admit that I was wrong. You are a hero, Tony, and you didn’t deserve what I put you through with the Accords.
“Never mind,” Scott laughs nervously.
“Aw, really? And here I thought I’d be a top salesman.”
I know. You're itching for the next one. it's ok.
As always, comments and kudos mean the world to me and I'm sorry I've been so... silent lately. I promise I'll try to respond more often. I've just been in a not-so-great headspace recently, so that's why i've been... absent.
“What I’m
He sighs. “Why?” He gasps out.
And Jacey is laughing, hard, but still crying and she swats at Tony. “No,” she sob-laughs, “I’ll tell him your stupid hormones are overwhelmingly powerful.”
“Tony,” a new voice calls, “there you are.”
“Tony,” she admonishes, “you’re being ridiculous.”
“You let,” her face calm, but her words are filled with ice, “Tony get
Never mind. He does sound like he hates him. "Be... at my father's house?" Because he owns the place, right? Why can't he be here?
Rogers looks contemplative. The soldier sighs and rubs his jaw, “The Wanda here was once an Avenger, and we accepted her despite her past… alliances. It was a good choice. It wasn’t until almost a decade later that she turned into a supervillain.”
also: infinity war broke my heart in hALF and i SWEAR TO GOD if Marvel doesn't FIX IT WITH PART 2... i don't know how i'm going to cope.
The alien lets Tony lie there, though, but crouches down next to Tony's head. "The pheromones of your race are very disconcerting," he murmurs, "it is almost as if I can not help but want to assist you."
“Also, I’ve signed you up for Lamaze and parenting classes.”
Steve and Tony were supposed to be
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve sits back in the chair and stares.
Tony hears what he doesn’t say, though. “I’m so sorry for your loss. How recent…?”
“You sound like Brucie-bear.”
Tony’s whole frame recoils as if he’s been slapped. He hides his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and says nothing.
The sheets are warm and soft around him, but there’s a beeping noise that is frankly driving him up the wall––would somebody turn the damn thing
“I know. He’s not wrong, but neither is Tony.” Rhodes lets out a deep, exhausted sigh and pulls a phone out of his pocket. Cho hasn’t seen a flip phone in years.
Strange barrels through another window and rushes over to Stark as fast as he can.
Tony would laugh too, but he’s busy. “Hurgh,” he says instead.
“Yes, I– I apologize, I seem to always forget. Ms. Danvers, I thought I might ask if you’d like to be on the team.”
That. That… that should definitely not be as arousing as Tony is now finding it. Christ. Steve
Fury’s gaze meets the former agent’s and Clint shrinks back. “I cannot believe you idiots,” the man hisses.
allergic. Like deathly-anaphylatic, fatally, allergic.
“End?” This shocks Tony because he'd expected to be put on bed-rest immediately.
"That's impossible," Jane gasps.
"Where is the 'Doc'?"
Pain wracks through his middle and flare up his spine. He whimpers and groans, tears start to leak out of his eyes and his whole body shakes where it's dangling from this asshole's grasp.
He doesn’t have many of those these days. “You shouldn’t be,” he whispers so quietly Cho almost doesn’t hear it.
“Listen, Carol, you can trust me. This…” He points to his forehead, “...shows me things, on occassion. I know that you are new to your abilities, Ms. Danvers, and I would like to help you.”
“Shut up. I just–” Tony takes another deep breath and the nausea fades away. “Ugh. That’s like morphine. Okay, kid, I’m good. Thanks.” The engineer wheezes and wipes his face. “Sorry.”
Tony blinks slowly. He gets the accute feeling that Steve is asking why Stark betrayed
Tony decides that he's feeling a little cramped, so he nudges Jacey in the arm and she grumbles incoherently.
“I’m not– I’m not saying this to manipulate you, or anything. I just. I didn’t want it to go unsaid. I… I waited too long, back then, and I lost everything. I didn’t want… I’ve learned my lesson.”
“Who is, then? I pushed The Accords didn’t I?”
“By the way,” she starts out of the blue, “what’s up with all of the flowers?”
Tony stiffens, but doesn’t reply.
“Ja, in Sokovia. With… how do you say… защитный муж (zashchitnyy muzh)... uh… vhat do you call a man who is married?”
"2018."
She finally leaves the room. Rhodes is in the hallway; he’s pacing. He finally sees her and asks her how Tony’s doing.
“Oh? Is the famous Stark rendered speechless?”
happened upon while using the time stone. According to Strange, they thought that they had picked up on an energy signature similar to a stone when they rescued Tony a short while back. The soul stone, to be exact. They hadn't found anything, however, except for Tony himself.
“Oh, Tony,” she says, “I’ve got your vitamins and supplements with me, as well as some alpha pheromones… I thought they might help.”
Oh, right, she got kidnapped. Joy.
. Steve isn't ready, but he does as asked and moves away. Their bond trembles, even as he establishes new ones with the infants. His heart is breaking. He has so, so many regrets. So much to still make up for.
Once they've all shuffled out, Jacey hangs behind and watches Tony with an unreadable gaze.
“Captain,” he greets. His voice is polite, but it’s sharp, too. Distant and cold.
They share a smile and continue down the corridor. Fate beats a cruel drum in Jacey's ears. She knows what's coming. It's only just a matter of time. She gazes at Tony's relaxed features and prays Strange and Steve won't be too far when the hourglass runs out of sand.
The strange one pokes at him and tells the other one to carry Tony on his back. “Be careful,” the man is murmuring, “he is gravely injured.”
Tony barks out a laugh. Captain America making a sexuality joke. Who woulda thought.
Steve had a minute to process Fury’s words before he paled and could no longer look the man in the eye.
genetics? That's not fair.
Steve has done his best to prove himself to Tony. He's offered massages, foot rubs, decadent breakfast in bed, carried Tony to the community living room for movie or game nights, lets Tony always pick the movies on said nights, Tony is given gifts - trinkets, portraits, small things that catches Steve's eye - he's given flowers, poetry, and Steve lets him rant to him about being laid up like this. When Steve leaves the Tower for Avengers business like press conferences or community service, he always sticks up for Tony when the reporters say something horribly rude or unkind. It always leaves Tony a bit breathless and more than a lot horny. Not that he'd ever admit that to the super soldier.
Jacey eyes the newcomer, and smiles toothily. It’s very scary. “I do.”
"Holy
cliffy is my best friend and i'm just gonna hang you off it, k? no? not okay? *cackles* SORRY NOT SORRY i'm so mean really
"S-Steve," Tony whispers.
“TONY!”
Steve tilts his head back and groans. “That’s never going away.”
Tony looks out the small plane window of the first class seat, and contemplates.
Tony snorts. "God, I've missed your stupid face," Tony shakes his head with a smile on his lips.
in his life. It's like a water hose or something. He's so, so disgusted with the fluid bursting out of him that he almost doesn't notice a twinge in his lower belly and back.
okay. announcements over. you're free to read.
Steve straightens and sucks in a breath.
The scene is something out of a horror movie. There are agents all clad in black breaking into one of the floors of the Tower. They’ve busted the windows in and it’s too quiet. Some minutes later Everett Ross is seen hauling Tony out of the Tower rather violently. Tony doesn’t look good. The image is somewhat blurred from distance, but Steve can see that he’s clearly not been doing very well. Tony is pushed into a van with the words JCTC stenciled into the side.
“I remembered that there was a man in South Korea, about a decade or so ago, and I was studying the case because it was so… odd. The man, named Pak Gyeong, was born with a very, very small alpha gland. So small, that he could be considered like me, however he lacked the beta-hormone-regulator gland, so he wasn’t a dual-designation. The condition had never been reported before, and the man was very ill because his body wasn’t getting all the hormones it needed to maintain balance.
Ah! There. He's done it. Hah! See, not so useless after all!
I never meant to do those things to you
He was walking down the hallway, and looked out the window. He had to stop for a moment to catch his breath because, God, was it
"We must look alike in your world then," he concludes confidently.
“Helen!” Tony chirps happily, his scent immediately going sweeter from the presence of a trusted “pack member”.
“Married couples?” Steve intones with awe. “What do you mean?”
She gets up to leave and is nearly at the door and freezes when she turns around and meets Tony’s confused expression. Her own eyes travel down to his navel, and her face morphs into abject terror.
And Steve starts crying all over again.
Rhodey and Cho watch them escort Tony out before they snap out of it and get on a separate elevator.
phone?"
Labcoat slaps him again to force his head to the other side. Yeah. He reallly should know better.
"Au contraire, mon capitan, I would know
“I would hafe… I do not zink I would hafe chosen to go with Cap if I knew, but I zink I should hafe known because I was wrong, Tony Stark,” she smiles uneasily, “I see now, that I should not hafe been so… hasty. I– I had a dream, and I did not want it to be true.”
Comments? Suggestions? Love? If so, I WANNA HEAR EM.
“Just come here and wait. That’s all we can do right now,” Matt tells him again.
“Papa? I’m thirsty,” she says.
“Alana, I should stay. I’ll be okay, I promise.”
“You promise?” She asks Steve.
Sam takes one look at him as he gets into the car and shakes his head. "What's going on with you man?"
She ushers them in. Tony hangs back, Maria’s pod behind him. Steve stands next to him and gives his hand a quick squeeze. “We have to go Tony. Princess Shuri is one of the brightest minds in the world. If anyone can help Maria it’s her, but we have to go now.”
“Don't worry about me, Tony. They can’t hurt me and I’m not leaving until I pay them back for putting our daughter in jeopardy.”
About 5 hours in Shuri comes back with another treatment. She goes about it the same way as before. It seems too soon for another dose, and Steve says as much.
“Yes. Yes, I’m positive, the serum is taking effect.”
“Before? Tony, what are you talking about?” Steve says confused. “Stop trying to confuse me! How could you keep this from me Tony? How could you do this to me? How could you keep my daughter from me?”
“There’s gotta be something we can do. There has to be,” Steve says desperately. He looks over to see Tony staring at him questioningly.
“Our daughter is laying in a hospital bed dying. She needs us. She need you,” Tony says resentfully. “Because for all my money and love, and as much as it kills me to admit, you’re the one she  needs. So be her father and help her.”
She walks over to Steve and scans him. Whatever comes up on the scanner it’s what she’s looking for. “She’s definitely Steve’s daughter.” She goes back to Tony and shows him.
“Oh well, if you swear that’s a whole different story. Did you also
The rest of the night passes in silence.
“How…”
“Well…” Tony attempts to answer.
“I was making a joke,” Tony says rubbing his hand over his face. “Not a very good one clearly”.
A crash of thunder brings him out of his thoughts. Lightning strikes somewhere in the distance and the room is illuminated. The figure a man appears in the doorway and for a split second he goes on the defensive, but he’d recognize the silhouette anywhere. It’s Tony. He’s leaning against a wall in a way that makes Steve wonder how long he’s been standing there. Steve isn’t sure what to do. Nowadays Tony’s likely to leave if he so much as breathes his way.
“Tony, I - I didn’t hear you,” he says standing up.
“Captain? Are you alright?” one of the nurses asks in concern.
“Tony?” Steve whispers out as he looks up, trying to make heads or tails at what the other man’s looking at.
“Oh, sorry,” Steve says, starting to relax. “I wasn’t expecting…. honestly, I don't know what to expect from you anymore.”
“What the hell?” Sam says to no one in particular.
Steve’s taken to walking around the house in the dark. It’s become impossible for him to get more than a few hours of sleep. When he does manage a few moments of sleep he has nightmares about Maria. Night after night he lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. It’s difficult for him to feel comfortable in the room Tony’s given him. Once the house had been his home. Now he wanders around aimlessly, haunted by memories. He’s haunted by visions of the past and tormented by the thought of what could have been. Of the future he threw away.
“Fine, I go…. Eat and sleep,” Tony says, sounding resentful that he has to engage in activities so plebeian like, giving his body nourishment and rest. The three of them watch as Tony not so much walks away as he does drag himself out of the room.
“We aren’t sure. Seizures are usually symptomatic of something else. Which is why Tony and Alana are still in with the doctors.”
They all nod yes.
Steve stands off to the side and behind him. It’s awkward, but T’Challa doesn’t let it affect him. He walks over and greets Tony.
“How was she? Ehrm. Where was she… Ehrm”
One of the people on the plane walks over and hands Shuri another device. They watch as she lifts Maria’s hand and pricks her finger. The results instantly show up.
Tony’s pulse quickens as he watches her shuffle all the papers on the desk to find a clipboard.
Her presences put him at ease. He relies on her too heavily. She is certainly capable of living her life without him, but Tony needs her. He looks up at her and wonders how he got so lucky.
He watches as Alana takes his seat next to Maria’s bed. He watches as she kisses her little sister’s hand.
“The solution requires a donation from you,” she tells Steve.
The hospital is where time comes to die, specifically, in this very waiting room, Steve is sure of it. They have been waiting for over an hour without a single word from anyone. Steve is sitting next to Peter who is attempting to distract himself by doing homework with the aid of Matt. Wanda pours herself another cup of terrible coffee and everyone else is staring off into space. The silence is starting to make Steve’s skin crawl. In his frustration, Steve slams his head against the wall and leaves behind a pretty sizable dent.
“You think I would hurt her?”
The throb radiates from his hip down to his toes. But it’s nothing compared to the warmth that spreads through him at Tony’s words. His foolish heart overrides his brain and he preens at the encouragement.
Steve has to laugh at that. Peter picks her back up and gives her a wet, smacking kiss on the cheek, that has her laughing more. “Alright, now that we’ve got all that straightened out, let’s see if the Cap is around somewhere.”
“I’m a father…” he whispers to himself.
Tony’s head springs up from its resting place. Steve nearly trips over his own feet in his haste to get to her.
“We think we have a solution, but we need your help.”
“What are you talking about?”
Shuri isn’t stupid, she the farthest from it, but even if she was, there’s very little keeping Maria’s parentage hidden, once you opened your mind a bit. She’s a perfect blend of the two of them, Tony’s coloring and Steve’s features.
Tony’s surprise turns to cold disinterest when he realizes it’s Steve. “Morning.”
“I thought for a minute that it would be better to keep her here and have the doctors come to us. But when it came down to it. Having her in the hospital seemed like the safer thing to do.”
“They said that they need to run more blood work. They need blood from both of her parents, Papa.”
“The bone marrow will be extracted from your hip. It shouldn’t hurt very much, but considering your strength we might have to be a little aggressive,” she explains to Steve.
Alana and Peter look horrified as they think over what Steve has told them.
“What did the doctors say?” Tony asks her.
“Thank you, but please, just call me Steve,” he tells the nurse. He doesn’t really feel much like the Captain of anything anymore.
“Get up Tony,” Steve calls out as he tries to keep his voice as steady as possible. “I mean it, enough. We need to talk. I have questions and you have the answers. We can’t do this anymore.”
“Good to know you think my sleep is irrelevant.”
- Go home. Do me a favor and sleep.
“God, Alana. I’ve been leaning on her too much.” Tony lets out a huff. “Just another shining example of my failure as a father. She can’t stand me right now you know.”
“Alana went to talk to the doctors.”
Steve takes Tony’s hand and links their fingers and brings their hands to rest over Maria’s stomach. “I promise,” he repeats with force.
Steve shrugs pretending like he has no idea what Tony is talking about.
“Because it’s what you do,” Tony says coldly. Steve breaks apart.
“I wish I could say.”
“Steve, just stop,” Tony sounds defeated. “Don’t do this. I can’t do this.”
Each morning she knocks on everyone’s door as she makes her way down the hall to Tony’s bedroom. “
“WOMEN IN UPROAR! - MEN HAVE STOLEN EVERYTHING ELSE, NOW OUR UTERUSES TOO!”
Steve feels a very specific type of pain and anguish he’s never experience before. He’s being punished and he’s sure of it now. He’s a bit hysterical. He’s down on his knees in front of Tony, begging without shame. He’ll do anything to figure it out.
"What good is that gonna do? We've been through all this before," Tony counters his voice laced with venom. "Remember how that went?"
“We found some common abnormalities. We need more samples to run tests,” he says looking directly at Steve. “A complete DNA sample would be even better.”
“ Uh, excuse me. I should have knocked. I…” The doctor mumbles doing his best to look anywhere other than at Tony and Steve. “We found something incredibly useful in the sample, but I'm afraid we’re going to need more. An unaltered, pure sample to be specific.”
“Before you showed up I did something I’m still not sure I even believe in. Something I haven’t done since my mother was alive.”
Sorry about the delay. I'm still alive, but you know life keeps getting in the way. I apologize this is so short, but I needed to through the medical stuff as fast as I could so quite frankly I could move onto more interesting things. Like the boys learning how to co-parent. Steve and Maria getting to know each other as father and daughter and Tony fighting himself and trying to let Steve be.
, the title twists in Steve’s gut.
“Steve, stop! Please? Don’t do this, okay? We don’t know how this happened okay,” Tony argues with him. Steve melts against the palm that Tony places against his cheek. “Look at me.”
There’s no avoiding it. No matter how much she likes Steve, he’ll never be as good as Tony, never as good as her father. “Come, let’s go find him.”
“Okay? Where would you like to go?”
“Peter, come sit down. Alana will come to get us,” the man he came with, Matt, tells him in an even and sure voice.
“I know.”
Steve follows close behind as they make their way down. Steve’s surprised to see it in a state of neglect. All but one spot. It looks as though Tony had recreated a hospital room.
“It could have happened? Right?” Steve says in desperation laced with anger. “Right?”
“Have a good time, man?” Sam asks as they make their way back to their rooms.
“Are you sure we can trust him?” Tony asks again. He’s anxious, pacing back and forth.
“Not yet, the doctors want your blood.”
Steve perks up at that. He’s more than happy to do whatever he can to help. He walks back over to the table where Maria lays. Shuri stands next to her, waiting.
“Like they’d take her and do what with her?” Peter asks meekly.
“Let’s just say that I wish Alana hadn't found someone so much like me. She could do better.” It’s clear Tony’s keeping information to himself and he’s happy Steve doesn’t press for more.
"I'm sorry, Alana. I can't. I'm not- I have to go," he pleads with her.
“That didn’t take long.”
“BODY OF CHILD DISCOVERED- APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO BRUTAL EXPERIMENTS.”
Tony, as it seems, is as busy as he led Steve to believe. But the lack of his presence doesn’t keep away any of the bustles. The house is alive with the sounds of family. Maria unsurprisingly is a big hit with everyone. She makes fast friends of all of them, quickly learning their names and any bit of information she can pry out of them. Despite his best efforts to keep away from her, Maria seems determined to spend as much time with him as possible. With Tony working and Alana single-handedly running the
“She’s in good hands,” he says instead.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve says.
“No, okay. He made it very clear. I already made the mistake of letting him too close, but it all ends now.”
“Yeah, okay, let’s do it. Whatever it takes,” Steve assures them of his commitment.
“Steve, we have to get you out of here too. If they’re interested in her, it’s because of you. They want a DNA sample, it’s the serum they’re after,” Tony says plainly.
“Oh don’t be a baby. It’s time to strip Captain!” Tony says with far too much amusement and if Steve is reading him right a bit of lust.
“Don’t worry we perfected the process, She will only need a few treatments over the next days, but she is ready for the transplant.”
“Hi baby, my beautiful baby girl, I’m so sorry,” Steve sobs. He maneuvers himself so that he is laying on the other side of Maria’s bed. He pulls both Tony and Maria to him. “You’ll never know how much. But I’m gonna make up for it. I’m never going to leave you ever again. I love you so much.”
“Oh, is he any good?”
“I’M HER FATHER. I’M THE ONLY ONE WHO’S BEEN AT HER SIDE, ME!” Tony let’s out a manic laugh before continuing. “And that’s probably why she’s suffering.”
“What? Not important?” Steve shouts. “Someone tried to destroy us and it’s not important.”
“She’s mine.” It comes out a whisper.
“That’s what I thought.”
“Everywhere I turn I see his stupid face and then last night….” Tony let’s out a frustrated groan.
“I know, I know,” Steve says as he pulls her into his arms. She instantly curls up against his chest. “Say sorry to the girls.”
Tony turns to face him and throws his arms around Steve’s neck. “It’s working. She’s getting better.”
“Has she ever experienced anything like this before?”
Tony’s no fool and neither is Steve. There’s something off with the way the doctor is speaking to Tony. There’s something about the way he looks over and holds the vile that puts Steve in full alert. He straightens up and widens his stance, making himself look as big as he can.
The both watch as Steve’s blood fills up the little tube. Tony pulls out the needle and put a piece of cotton over the wound. Steve takes Tony’s hand in his. That little tube is their last hope.
“She was born in the house. Vision ran the show. Alana and Rhodey assisted. It wasn't an easy birth,” Tony says looking over at Maria. “My body obviously wasn’t designed for her to make a quick exit. There was a lot of scalpels, lasers, blood and screaming. It almost killed me, but I’d do it a million times over knowing the end results.”
“Steve…”
“Hi princess,” he chokes out. “There’s so much I want to say to you, but not like this. You see, I’m your dad. I know I haven’t been around long, but I promise that’s going to change. I’m going to make this all better and then we’re going to go so many more adventures together,” Steve whispers as he strokes Maria’s forehead.
“I don’t think so.”
“You found something?” Tony leaps up. “What? A cure, a treatment?”
“MEDICAL MARVEL OR THE SPAWN OF SATAN? RELIGIOUS GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD BELIEVE THE LATER.”
“What?! No, that’s not what I mean!” Steve stammers. He hangs his head and covers his face. So much for making progress.
He was raised Catholic, but it hardly meant anything anymore. Life and everything he’d seen made it difficult to believe, not in something greater, but that it was out there looking out for them. He had been pious. He prayed, begged for forgiveness. But he struggled more and more, especially after he came back. The world had changed, he’d changed and like most, he realized he felt abandoned, betrayed.  When he saw his only child laid out low, he decided to put all his faith in what he knew, in what he could see. And it had all worked out because here she was getting better. He put his faith where he should have from the beginning. He put it in Tony, in his family, in himself.
“Can’t complain. I’m alive and so is Maria. Vision didn’t do half bad for the first male c-section birth in the history of the world,” Tony continues completely ignoring Steve’s last statement.
Sam goes silent. “Did you just curse? Steve, are you okay?”
Everything comes pouring out of him like he’s at confession. He lets out a sigh and rubs his face. “What are you doing Rogers? Venting to a child? Good work,” he tells himself aloud. “Geez, I’m pathetic.”
“ I know, but it doesn’t matter anymore. It’s been more than three years. There’s nothing left to do.”
“Extinct,” Tony corrects her. “Say it with me,
Breakfast goes on without any issues. Maria entertains them with funny kid jokes and little stories about things that Tony has taken her to do. She wows them with her knowledge of the animals she's seen at the zoo and the animals she wishes she’d seen, but knows are essitncted.
He stands up and sits on the edge of Maria’s bed and pull the grey bunny out of his jacket and puts it next to her before he takes one of her hands in his. “I’m so sorry, Maria. I don’t know what I’m doing here. You’re so beautiful and brave and kind. You deserve better than this. I wish there was something I could do.”
“Don’t Alana me! It isn’t going to work this time! Stop behaving like a child. Why are you set on taking away her chance to have a whole family? You know more than anyone how much it hurts.”
“Thanks, but I couldn’t if I wanted to. I’m not even sure how I fell asleep in the first place”.
“She was… beautiful and funny and smart. She had the patience of a saint. She had to, dealing with me and Howard. She was amazing and I took her for granted.”
Steve blanches. Tony looks like death. Everything rests on this. Steve reaches out and takes Tony’s hand in his. He stands and throws caution to the wind, pulling Tony to him. He’s relieved when he feels the other man melt against him. Tony wraps his arms around.
Clint and Wanda look at him in shock, but Nat has a small smile and a twinkle in her eyes. After she eats a few more and takes the medicine he gives her, she falls asleep in his arms. She’s even heavier when she sleeps. He dares say that his arm might be falling asleep, but it’s worth it. She sleeps for almost an hour, during which the trio leave him and head off to buy lunch in town.
“I’m going to make an incision, that’s the easy part.”
When no responses comes from him, Steve sits up and looks over to find Tony asleep. Steve gets up and walks over to the closet to grab a blanket and puts over Tony. He’ll let him sleep, everything else would just have to wait.
“Well… this is depressing,” Scott says as he slides down a wall.
“He can go in,” she tells the nurse. “Put his name on the list.”
At first, Steve thinks Matt stood up in reaction to the bang of his head, but then he realizes that he turned to face the hallway opposite them, where Alan was making her way towards them. She’s a wreck. Everyone stands when she reaches them. The first thing she does is throw herself into Matt’s waiting arms and begins to sob.
Steve is out of breath by the time he finished the sentence. He thought it would feel strange the first time he calls Maria his daughter to someone else, but it doesn’t.
“I could leave if you-”
. Tony, Rhodey, and Sam work together on some new tech. Tony and Nat disappear for hours in the wood behind the house and come back all smiles. When they make their way in he hears Nat telling Tony that she
“Sorry,” she says between sobs, before shoving her face back into Steve’s chest.
“They are some of the best diagnosticians in the world. I’m certainly paying them enough. Why? Do you think I made a mistake?” Tony asks inquisitively.
“Papa is going to stay with her,” she says to Rhodey. He reaches out and takes one of her hands in his. “If anything happens…. Dio, if anything happens to her… I don’t think Papa will survive it.”
Steve turns his head to them. “You brought this on yourselves.”
He runs his fingers over Maria’s blanket.
“I’ve been watching on the security feed. What does he want with her?”
Coming back is nothing like what Steve thought it would be. Although, he isn’t all that sure what he was expecting. When he first left he kept tabs on all of them, on Tony. But after a while, it became too difficult. There really wasn’t anything for him to keep tabs on, it was as if Tony dropped off the face of the Earth. There wasn’t anything until there was. Until it was on the cover of every tabloid, newspaper, and magazine. Tony had a baby. Tony moved on, Tony found someone else. Tony started a family… without him. For weeks he tortured himself, reading every pointless story which provided him with nothing but vague details and more heartache until Nat intervened.
“No, he hasn’t said anything. The crazy thing is I would feel better if he did,” Tony confesses.
“Her brain is on fire. The seizure was brought on by the fever and the fever is being caused by an infection. Where the infection originated from no one knows. They’re running all these tests trying to figure out how and why this happened. They had to put her in a coma.” By the time Alana gets to the end her words are coming out between sobs.
“Let’s go,” Steve says as he pulls away and leads Tony down to the lab.
Maria forcefully shakes her head back and forth and squeezes her eyes shut. “Yes,” Steve tells her. “Do you want to feel better and go play in the garden?” he asks.
“Mr. Stark,” another doctor calls out as he comes into the room. Steve shoots up as Tony brushes his hand across his lips and readjusts himself in the chair. Suddenly it feels too small.
Steve hopes the false conviction in his voice rings true. He wants to be confident and strong for Tony, but he isn’t. He tucks Tony into his chest and rests his chin on his head.
“I’m no doctor, but they can do that right?” Steve continues.
Alana looks at him with a critical eye and Peter looks at him with a bit of shame written across his face.
There’s fire in his veins, he’s angry. All of his pain and frustrations are bubbling to the surface. He’s going to use it. There’s going to be a reckoning. He runs back up to Maria’s room. He finds Tony suited up and standing guard inside.
“That’s it I give up,” Wanda exclaims.
Steve watches as Tony huffs and walks over to the bar to pour himself a drink. He notices Steve watching and let out a bitter laugh. “You’ll have to excuse me, your holiness.” Tony brings the glass to this lips and downed the whole thing. “I'm a bit stressed.”
“The best.”
“I did. It is a blood sample from Maria’s other parent. I’ve isolated some the more relevant information in the sample,” Tony explains.
Steve’s not even halfway through the sentence when Peter’s taking off down the hall, shouting his thanks.
They stand in the center of the room staring at each other for what feels like an eternity. They’re getting nowhere. Tony is in so much pain and turmoil it’s visible on his face and the worst part is Steve knows he caused it. Tony’s suffered fare more than Steve could have imagined.
“I wanted to be close by in case you or anyone else needed me. And Scott offered to show me this really awesome move,” Peter explains.
Three years ago Steve would have told Tony to stop drinking and quit acting like a spoiled brat. Now he just takes it. What else could he do? “I should go, I’m sorry.”
“Hey,” he says softly.
He couldn’t, he wouldn’t rely on anyone, at least not when it came to his family. He kisses Maria’s forehead and then Alana’s before he reluctantly leaves his entire world behind. He watches from the doorway as Alana pulls out a book and begins reading to Maria.
Tony’s heart swells. Alana is such a positivity light in his life. He has no idea where she gets it. It’s not a Stark trait. Tony wishes he could say with any sort of confidence that Alana got it from her mother, but the truth is Tony could barely remember Chiara. She was a victim of one of Tony’s misadventures and a casualty of Howard’s manipulations. Every time he thinks his opinion of his father could get no lower, his father’s actions continue to prove him wrong.
” she tries.
“What other choice do we have?” Tony argues, “she’s dying whether we do this or not.”
The three of them look over at Maria’s tiny, fragile body. A shiver runs through Steve at the thought of the horrors people might inflict on her.
Tony arrives at the hospital, and does his best to avoid the swarms of paparazzi in the parking lot vying for a picture of him, distraught and utterly useless father. He doesn’t even turn the car off. He jumps out, tossing the keys to the security guard out front and makes a dash for the front doors. He walks up to the elevators ignoring the flashing of what feels like hundreds of cameras and heads up to the second floor.
Steve is waiting for Tony at the door, holding it open for him. They make their way down the familiar path to Maria’s room. The air is thick around them and everyone keeps their distance. They walk into her room as one of the nurses tends to Maria’s tiny failing body. She looks like she’s hanging on by the last thread. Her beautiful raven hair has lost some of its luster and her once warm colored skin has a grey tint to it. It’s heartbreaking. It takes everything Tony has not to break down again. They’re falling back into their parts too quickly. Steve senses Tony’s distress and takes over.
“Did he?”
“You ever gonna tell me what these dreams are about?” Tony asks. Steve isn’t sure if Tony’s asking because he cares or because it would ruin what little foundation they’ve managed to build between them if she didn’t. Either way, he’s positive Tony wouldn’t want to hear it.
“You’re coolest!”
Tony let Steve in and gave him everything and Steve had crushed it. Steve ruined him. As much as he loves the girls, there’s a part of him that they could never fill. He feels like an empty shell.
“My God. I’m so sorry. I should have been there.” Steve says taking Tony’s hand into his own.
“Good morning, DeeDee, just calling to let you know that I’m losing my mind.”
“Because he’s sad. He needs a friend. I’m a good friend,” she says confidently.
“What I had to,” Steve says as walks to stand in the dark behind a fence to change.
Every room he walks into he hears Tony’s voice, light and free and calling out to him. Every dark corner brings back memories of passion. The heat of all the fumbling kisses they shared. Kisses that always led back to the bedroom they shared. The bedroom that now belongs solely to Tony. Some nights the desperation to give in and crawl into bed with Tony, consequence be damned, is overwhelming. Maybe Tony would let him stay, maybe things could go back to the way they were. It’s wishful thinking, but he aches for Tony and the ache makes him desperate. It’s on these nights he wanders. Most nights he wanders.
“I- I don’t know. I guess both or either?”
“FREAKS GIVE BIRTH TO MUTANT OFFSPRING!”
“That ‘boy’ is a man in his thirties and a lawyer.” There’s a lightness in Tony’s voice Steve hasn’t heard in a long time. It’s strange but welcomed. He sends a silent thank you to God for allowing them a bit of peace.
Steve closes the door and turns to face Tony. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to just take over like that. But I’m starting to understand your hesitation. I just didn’t care for how he was speaking to you.”
“Compatibility issues?” Steve says to no one in particular.
“Not intentionally, no. I won’t let her life become a revolving door. She deserves better than that.”
“I ask because maybe someone was there? Maybe someone saw?” Steve explains.
“Wha… come on? Really? I still have all of tomorrow too!” Peter argues.
“It isn’t that simple. I don’t have all the things I need on the ship. For now, we will keep her under until we can get her back to my lab and run more extensive tests.”
Panic is beginning to set in. He has so many questions. How? When? How?
He turns away from her and starts the bike. He can’t deal with her right now. He can’t deal with anyone right now. His skin feels too tight and he feels like the walls are closing in on him. He has to get away. He drives off with her yelling at him.
“It doesn’t matter,” Shuri says.
“It just felt, wrong. Something about the way he was holding that vile of my blood and looking at it. And the way he was talking to you. I’m sure he isn’t half as smart as you Tony.”
“No, it’s fine. I have something for her,” Steve explains as he pulls out a small grey bunny from the inside of his jacket. “If you could just give it to her…”
“Yes, seriously. Your education comes first. That’s the deal Pete,” Tony reminds him.
Tony freezes at the thought of his eldest daughter. He’d put her through too much. He let her shoulder too much of his own shit and she was cracking under the pressure.
“They’re your children,” Okoye says. Steve pretends he doesn’t hear the change in her voice when she says your. “They are at our borders, fighting to get in.”
When Tony sees the sun peaking over the horizon he gives up on the pointless pursuit of rest and looks over at he clock. It reads 5:41 am. With everything weighing heavy on his mind he needs to talk it out with someone. Someone who knows the whole story. Someone who knows all the little details. He reaches for his phone and calls Rhodey.
Steve takes one of Maria’s hands in his own.
“That’s not true. I’m not sad and I know that your Papa isn’t either. Why would he be sad when he has you and Alana and Peter.”
“If we take a closer look we can see the serum attaches itself to different areas and acts as reinforcements. Now when we look at Maria’s scans, it is clear she has inherited the serum in the chromosomes she received from Steve. They should be acting in the same way as we saw in Steve’s scans. However, when you look here, it’s obvious there is a compatibility issue.”
He gives her a genuine smile and leans down to kiss her cheek.
His head is starting to spin.
“Beside what’s already happened what has Steve done to inspire this?” Rhodey questions.
- The beginning of Sleeping Beauty.
“I don’t even have anything to say to that,” Sam says in a nonsense tone. “It’s gonna take an hour to get to you if I’m lucky. So sit tight. Go get a coffee, no get yourself a camomile tea or something.”
“Steve, I wasn’t suggesting,” Tony sighs, no conversation between them is going to come easily to them anymore. Trying to navigate the hundreds of layers of subtext is exhausting. “I didn’t think that’s what you meant. I’m just asking for your honest opinion on the situation.”
Tony is proud of himself for being able to get through the whole story without breaking down. It seems like that’s all he’s been doing lately.
The look on Tony’s face doesn’t give off the impression that he actually means what he’s saying. He stands aside as Tony brings another chair to the other side of Maria’s bed.
“Yes, of course,” he says leaving quickly.
As soon as the door clicks shut Tony turns to face Steve.
“That’s not what I meant! Don’t be a grouch,” Tony says feeling a bit guilty. “I’m in need of counsel here, you know, before I do something we’ll all regret later.”
Steve sees Tony’s conflicted. Tony wants to say something and as horrible as it’s likely to be, Steve wishes he’d just say it. He’s sick of trying to compile a list everything he’s done to Tony. Because despite what everyone else says Steve knows there’s more going on than Bucky and his parents.
“Good morning, Mr. Stark. If you’re looking for Alana she just left to go talk to the doctors you had come in.” That catches Tony’s attention, finally some good news, hopefully. He turns to her and reads her name tag.
“What difference is it going to make? Why do want to hear me say it? Why now? It didn’t matter before,” Tony says, tearing himself out of Steve’s grasp to pace around the room.
“Not, so great. There’s so much to tell you, but there’s no time. I need you to send a jet over as fast as you can,” Steve says unable to control the panic rising in his voice.
“I’ll be okay. Goodnight Sam,” Steve says, patting the other man on the shoulder before making his way towards his own room.
She looks over at Tony. She’s a bit confused, but she understands the stakes. “Fine, what happened?” she asks again.
“Oh my God Tony. I can’t… I don’t,” Steve muddles out.
“Steve! What happened?” he hears Tony’s panic-stricken voice calling out to him. Steve is frozen in place as Tony throws himself down next to Maria’s unconscious body. He hears a chorus of confused voices, but can’t focus in on any of the faces.
“I will let you have some, but these,” Tony explains as he holds out the plate for one of the servers to take, “are not pancakes anymore. You can have two pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, and a little bit of whip cream. Okay?”
As though Steve should have expected anything else, their first night back is celebrated with a party. Steve watches as a huge tent goes up behind the mansion. He watches from his room as tables, chairs, and sofas are set up. He nearly punches out a window when Tony’s new A.I system, Friday scares him. In her Irish brogue, she informs him politely that there is a tuxedo in his closet and that he is expected to be in attendance at 6 pm sharp. He thanks her as he walks over to the closet to find one of the perfectly tailored tuxes Tony had made for him. Sorrow and regret fill him as he runs his hand over the material. His mind travels back to the day Tony forced him to get measured, how they’d struggled to keep their hands off of one another long enough for the tailor to make them a matching set. He remembers the look Tony gave him when he tried the finished product on for the first time and how deeply it made Steve blush. How it led to another night of broken furniture and hickeys in amazingly sensitive places.
“Right, well you’re up,” Tony tells him. “Go shower and sleep.”
“No, it’s okay. I’m fine,” Tony tries to lie, but a yawn betrays him. She smiles down at him as she runs her fingers through his hair.
“Alana and Peter,” Steve adds.
She winces at the sound and apologizes. “Sorry, I wasn’t sure how hard I had to do that to get through the skin.”
“No, they won’t,” Tony says firmly. Steve has a look of confusion spread across his face.
“Hi, Daddy.” The word flows so effortlessly from her lips, as though she’d always said it. Like she’d always known and had simply been waiting for everyone else to catch up.
“Isn’t what he’s already done enough?”
“As opposed to what?” Steve asks.
“I have to go. I’ll explain everything later, but right now I have to take care of something,” Steve says before he rips the tracker off of his watch and races back to the hospital.
The last time he saw her Alana was a 23-year-old grad student, alone in the world, searching for family, for a place to belong. Now she’s a strong, confident woman. Whenever she walks into a room everyone turns. She’s found the trademark Stark swagger and she definitely knows how to work it to her advantage. She’s so much like Tony.
, Tony reluctantly leaves Maria in the care of everyone else in the house. Everyone is happy to take turns spending time with her, but more times than not, she ends up asking for Steve, which throws him for a loop, because he’s done nothing to make himself appealing.
“It is no problem,” the king reassures them. “We are happy to do whatever we can.”
Swear! Ha! Do you think there’s anything in this world you could swear on that would make me trust you again? Trust you enough to let you near Maria. To let you be a part of her life?”
“TONY! STEVE!” “PAPA!” They yell in unison.
“No, you don’t. I’m the one who’s up every night sick to my stomach thinking about every worst-case scenario. I’m the on-“Steve cuts Tony off before he can continue into another tirade.
“How long have I been out?”
“Okay, lay down on your stomach,” she instructs. She must have seen the confused looked on Steve’s face because she pats him on the should. “We are going to do a bone marrow transplant. The virus has severely compromised all her systems. Your pure cells should reverse the danger, hopefully.”
“How’d it go?” Tony asks.
“I promise.”
“We need that sample,” Tony states plainly. He seems defeated. “We’ll do it here and then bring it to the doctors to run their tests. Hopefully, they’ll find something in your half to help her.”
“He’s been spending time with her,” Tony manages to choke out like it’s the worst thing in the world.
“Shhh,” Matt whispers. He watches as Matt cups her face in his hands. Somehow he knows that Alana is looking down and lifts her face back up to his. “Talk to me.”
“She’s everything,” Tony responds.
“Your Majesty,” Steve responses on instinct.
“I know and I wish I had something concrete to tell you, but I don’t have all the information myself. All I can tell you is that she’s mine… and she’s Tony’s too.”
“What does that mean?” Steve’s eyes squint in suspicion.
Steve lets out a sigh of defeat and Nat quickly leads them over to the bar. He feels bad. He knows she’ll stay by his side all night long, babysitting him. He can’t stand the thought that he’ll end up ruining her night too.
“They know I’m her father. It isn’t safe here anymore. Who know’s what they want her for. What they've already done to her. You have to get her out of here,” Steve whispers.
Nat comes over and rests her head on his arm as they all wait in silence for Scott to come around. As soon as he pulls up they all jump in as quickly as they can.
“I… I don’t understand…”
“Hey, Tony!” Peter waves to him.
“Because you love him, Tony. Because he’s her father.”
“No change, I’m afraid. But she actually has a visitor right now,” Jenna informs him.
Tony thinks he should have said something to Steve before. Steve’s clearly not happy with what he’s being told, but Tony truly doesn’t care.
As for Tony, well, the workshop was his man cave and known to all other occupants of the Tower to be off limits, only opening his doors to by appoint-only consultations. Yet Tony made an exception for the super soldier; he was more than happy to welcome Steve in, so much so the certified genius gave the captain his own code that grants him access at any given time. Even when Tony was elbow deep in something (creating, designing, obsessing over an chemical equation), he'd never miss to spare a moment or two with Steve before going back to his work and leaving the man to his own devices in a corner of the shared space.
Mulan."
"And what
“Awww geez, listen to this,” Steve suddenly says, jerking Tony out of his thoughts. "Sorry," he adds quickly, thinking he was disrupting Tony's concentration.
Tony was still unsure. “I wouldn’t hold my breathe if I were you, Cap.”
Steve's face twists.
Steve starts to unbuckle his belt, and Tony gets with the program. It was an awkward angle for the super soldier to remove his pants all the way without standing, so he just shoves the jeans and his underwear down to his thighs as he kneels in front of Tony. He watches how Tony's lips curl into a hungry, predatory smirk as he admires Steve's length, hard as steel and leaking at the tip.
"My what? Aw come on Tony," Steve says, desperately trying to keep Tony from getting up to leave.
Steve sighs, his shoulders dropping. It goes without saying that his heart was on the floor. "What do you want me to do, Tony? I'll do it," he says in the saddest voice he's ever heard come out of him. "You don't want me around you? I'll keep a distance. I know it'll be awkward but we can be purely professional."
Steve reaches the basement where his motorcycle was parked. He swings a leg over it and sits, eyes and hands still glued on his phone. His heart was thumping its way out of his chest though. At that very moment, he knew he was a goner.
"Pardon?"
Steve gushes. “I don’t know if they’re any good. I think I burned them a little but they’re, uh they’re covered in frost so you wouldn’t be able to see. The second batch should be better though. Maybe you should wait for those? I think you should really wait for those, these aren’t that good for sure -”
For a moment Steve appears unconvinced but then he warms up as his smile returns. "No, Tony, you haven't. Serial killer? I've been called worse."
?" Tony asks, his questions sharp as daggers. It was quite unforgivingly brutal.
"Oh."
“I’ll be right there with you. I’ll pull you out if you get in too deep.”
And it shows in his pasty white face.
Of course, Barton declared war against Tony.
He's doomed, for sure.
Reaching over the counter, Tony’s eyes popped.
Tony: Clingy
"You," Steve says without thinking. He shakes his head, silently apologising for being forward. His nose nearly touches Tony's. "I don't know all the rules of modern dating, Tony. But I do know that I'm sure of you. How I feel about you."
; Tony sighs to himself, noticing a long time ago that Steve has a habit of leaving his hair damp to dry naturally. Tony couldn't resist returning the smile that was plastered across Steve's handsome face.
Steve nods, then shrugs like it was the most reasonable thing.
The super soldier took his turn to shake his head, a heavy tear drop escaping from his long, blonde lashes. He tries his best to smile, and it comes out as a smirk. "I'll see you tomorrow, Tony. Good night."
What they actually end up doing that afternoon was singing karaoke in Tony's lab with Tony teaching Steve the words to all of Abba's greatest hits. Steve really liked Dancing Queen for some reason. Sleep came much later, in a form of Tony dozing off on Steve's shoulder, snuggled on the grease-stained cot.
"Wow you look .." Tony cuts himself mid-sentence as he scans Steve from top to bottom, all clean and preppy with his hair combed neatly, his goofy smile spread wildly across his handsome face. This makes Tony realise that he was covered in grease and motor oil, in yesterday's clothes. Tony starts to dust his dirty jeans in a sad attempt to rival the beautiful man before him, a finger catching on the rip on his knees (Steve could never tell if the tear was intentional because for a man who could afford anything, Tony's jeans were always pulled and tattered).
The hangar went still.
“Har-har, funny. Listen, you’re going to have to leave. You’re really not supposed to be here.”
Wandering in his head, Steve failed to notice that the elevator had in fact missed his floor completely and was on it's way down to the Avengers' common room as a default. Steve frowns and braces himself for awkwardness. When the doors slide open, the common room was dimly lit and unoccupied. Pleased, Steve steps out and heads to the pantry, dropping his shoes by the plants next to the elevator.
“He didn’t want it,” Tony says, his eyes going distant.
I've decided that O!Tony's verse is gonna be 36900 because of reasons.
Tony doesn't wait for her to finish and bears down, screeching. The midwife takes gentle, gentle hold of the baby's head and tries to help ease out the shoulders. Blood flows out. The midwife, her name is Jen, bites her lips but persists. The first baby is out, so she grabs a towel to wrap the baby in and hands her off to Steve, so he can wash her off in the sink.
,” he admits finally.
“Yes, ma’am.”
Tony doesn’t answer, so Rhodes sucks in a breath and growls, “I’ll kill him. I swear to God, Tony, if he’s another Stone–”
“Right on all counts,” Tony whispers.
“Jarvis, please, I have to talk to him. Please,” Steve begs.
Let me say it again for those in the back: please don't hurt me.
bullshit
Then Tony’s laughing too, at the ridiculousness of all of it, and he feels his broken heart start to mend. Jacey has always said that laughter and kindness is the best medicine. He hadn’t really believed her, before, but now he does. He is so, so grateful to her.
Jesus, this place was chock-full of complications. It's enough to make his head spin.
Tony laughs, “Sure, Doc, no prob’.”
Tony goes real quiet real fast. Fucking government.
"E-Edwin M-Marion..." Tony gasps.
I'm just a ghost in this house"
And he has always been dealt a bad hand, but he tries to make the most of what he’s given and suffers from what he can’t. He'd wanted something more from Steve, had wanted a reason not to trust him because he was afraid-- he hadn't been expecting to be proven right --, and he had wanted a family. Now, his family is in pieces and he's in danger of losing the one on the way.
Nothing would or could prepare him for that eventual meeting, so he tries not to think about that either. He’d expected to have more problems come from the shindig at Siberia, but maybe he was too fucked up from beforehand to have anything more affect him. He should be glad, but all he feels is cold.
. For all of it. We have to find him; he’s a civilian with PTSD and we never knew
“What? What do you mean?”
? You were
(See the end of the chapter for
“Coupla days,” Reed’s giving him a look that means he’s probably thinking of their early conversation and how he said he was fine, but really wasn’t. The look reminds him of Steve. It makes him unreasonably angry.
Jacey closes her eyes and tells the story.
“Despite the fact that after you finished puberty you only had very, very minor heats? Maybe a day or two of being erect, sweaty, and feverish? Despite the fact that you’d never really smelled like much of anything your whole life? Especially during and right after Afghanistan when your body went on permament ‘hide-mode’? Then, as soon as Stane dies you get a heat?”
“You could just sign the Accords, that’d be the easiest and most efficient solution. Or, you could offer to set up negotiations with the various governments backing the Accords. That’d be longer and more arduous, but I think it’s the most likely solution you might be willing to take.”
“I can make it. I’ll probably just sleep the whole time. It’s okay. I’ve dealt with worse.”
Steve furrowed his brow, “Then what for?”
~ One Last Time, by Kellie Pickler
He just nods and follows.
“What, Steve?” Tony grins nastily. “Fat?”
“That wasn’t a question,” Tony quips.
Wanda just looks stunned and like she’s been slapped. “He tried to break it,” she blurts, clarity crossing her face as if she’d just seen it.
She thinks of everything she’s ever lived through. She thinks of her father who didn’t deserve her, and of growing up too fast. Of past bullies and hardships, but she’d made it through. She forgave her father, eventually, for his short-comings and loved him even when he didn’t really deserve that. She’s made her peace. Tony’s trying to make his with Steve and the Avengers. Steve is now trying to make his.
Tony is so, so tired. He just wants to
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
He shrugs, “It’s not like I’ve made things any better. I made them worse, actually.”
Steve tries to school away his hurt expression before Tony can see it; before the rejection can truly register even in his own mind. But then Tony is jerking his body forward into Steve’s arms and he collapses.
I will end you
Strange purses his lips, but begins the long, long story of just how he and Reed came to...
“Oh.” He had said all those terrible, ugly things to Stark on the Raft. He had seen the look on Stark’s face; had known that his words were cutting Tony deep.
“The Avengers,” she interrupts briefly, “don’t know. Do they?”
Reed blinks at his vicious tone. “Oh. So you’ve kind of got your own Doom situation going on, huh? Yeah, that’s not a–um–a good time?”
Tony’s really been saved by her so many times, he doesn’t know how he’d ever pay her back. He’d even asked her once, and she’d just gotten this look on her face that was something almost sad, fond, and determined all at once. She’d said:
Steve knows he’s fucked up. “Wait, no, Tony, that’s not what I meant–”
Tony only chugs the hot liquid and moans as a response.
“Oh, Tony,” she shakes her head. He’s going to be angry for a while, she knows.
"I'm sorry, I-" she whispers, "I- just- I love you so much, you know? And- And- I have to tell you this h-horrible
“How is the… how’s the baby?”
“Congratulations, Mr. Stark, you’re having a boy and a girl, and they’re both quite healthy all things considered. Those stem cells the fet– the babies sent you really worked wonders for your recovery.”
“Laura, I’m so sorry, honey. I’ll do what I can. I love you.”
Steve swallows and looks ashen. “I– I just thought it was one-sided. He didn’t show any signs of… of a bond, so, I just… but I couldn’t do it. I only took half a dose. I didn’t want to break it,” Steve finally admits miserably.
Tony wondered what that must’ve been like. To be anonymous. To maybe be seen first as a hero and last as Tony Stark. He can’t even imagine, but it must’ve been… nice. Freeing.
Natasha’s eyes land on him and they promise terrible things. “What is that supposed to mean?”
Tony glares. "Platypus."
“I’m fine, thanks,” she smiles widely; fake.
"Hm? Oh, Steve," Jacey gets a dopey grin on her face and jerks him down to her level. He falls down face first on to her chest and he blushes profusely.
Hope you guys like it!
Of course that means it can't -- won't last.
Steve lets the arms of the chair go. Clint is looking at him knowingly. Steve just grits his teeth and ignores him.
Steve feels a vice grip his heart and an unidentifiable rage washes over him.
There are flowers when he wakes. There’s no card and the nurses won’t tell him anything except that, “No, Mr. Stark, you are on strict bedrest. You are not allowed out of this bed.” He thinks they probably get a kick out of it because they always smile these secret little smiles when he tries to ask who the sender is.
. Which, obviously, was not where he was currently. His hands are immediately reaching for his belly that is no longer swollen with life and he panics.
Also-- remember when I said I wasn't sure how I was gonna cope if Marvel didn't fix IW pt 2 (i.e. Endgame)?? Yeah? This is me very much NOT coping. like at all. 13 pages and a little over 3000 (*gross sobbing*) words of definitively NOT COPING.
“On foot?”
It kills him, though, because he wants to. He wants to forgive them, but… maybe this once it’s all right if he’s selfish. If he’s more petty and stubborn and cross than he normally would be. He just doesn’t want to be hurt anymore.
Ross sighs and casts a glance over his shoulder to the android, “Well, Ms. Danvers, I thought we could make a deal. Care to sit?” He gestures to the chairs.
“I figured it out, yesterday. When I… never mind, but he’s got this… syndrome, I guess you could call it. It’s rare, but it has a tendency to pop up in trans-alphan men. Like Steve.”
“Arrested?” Richards looks shocked. “Why?”
“Right, Cap, because you totally didn’t reek of murder just then,” Sam butts in.
, and friends don’t try to kill one to save another. That’s not how it works. Cho is extremely upset with the captain for this. She immediately dials Rhodes’s number when Tony passes out.
The building begins to shake.
Oh, Tony.
“Yeah,” the omega says, “I can get behind that.”
Stark instantly tenses at Tony's query and Reed recoils.
“The symptoms aren’t as obvious in the pairing’s counterpart,” he says finally, “usually only omegas and female betas experience the syndrome’s worsrt symptoms. In alphas, it presents as them being ‘picky’ or waiting a long time for the right partner to come along.”
Okay, now how in the
“Ah, well, uh, no. Maybe not.”
The other three scientists look very, very tired and they all seem to slump a little more.
Tony stills. “What.” A memory stirs, too, just on the tip of his tongue–
“You didn’t seem to care when you fought him in Siberia,” she points out.
later, you understand?”
. “What have I done?” He stands there, miserable, for a good minute or two.
Over all, though, with the baby-face and puppy-dog blue eyes and the
Thanks for the reviews, kudos, and hits so far, guys!
I talked to you like, six months ago, and you were in Russia!"
Tony snorts. “Yeah, like a SWAT team could get up here. I’d almost like to see him try.”
“Miss? I’m afraid I don’t–”
"Oh my god, you have
“That’s an excellent question, Lang, glad you asked.” A familiar voice sounds from the doorway. They all spin to look– and it’s Fury. He definitely looks furious too.
The only ones who knew were Pepper, Yinsen, Rhodey, and Happy. Maybe Bruce and/or the Hulk too, but Tony wasn't sure about that. Rogers wouldn't have known that Tony was an omega because A) he didn't have heats, B) he didn't smell like an omega—thanks, Afghanistan—, and C) nobody knew his body had designated as omega after puberty. It was a very, very well-kept secret. Tony, on the other hand, was very much aware of Rogers's orientation as an alpha. Hell, he'd helped the man through at least two ruts.
She looks at him strangely, “What is this?”
“No… I’m needed here, but thanks. You could stay too.” For a second, Tony almost thinks she regrets not taking him up on it.
"J'c'y? Mmm... wha' zat?" Tony mumbles sleepily.
“Here’s mine,” Reed offers.
They grit their teeth, but they do go eventually. They know this is no time for arguments, so they rush to the elevator and head down to the streets.
Fury’s voice sounds and makes Steve pause at the door with his hand on the handle and his head turned to hear the man.
“Really, Tones? You’re telling me you got artificially inseminated?”
... NOW!" He screeches and drops the communicator, so afraid he'll  break it and then have no help coming at all.
Tony’s eyes fill. All these goddamn pregnancy hormones and Steve’s being… he’s being everything Tony’s ever dreamed about wanting. “I’m glad we both agree you’re an asshole,” Tony snickers and bumps into Steve’s shoulder.
Her face turns determined. No, she'll make it so they'll be right at his side. For now, though, they'll just all come together. As a team, and as a pack. She won't settle for anything less. Tony deserves the world, and Jacey will make sure that this team gets their shit together. They'll become legends - untouchable heroes - if she has anything to say about it.
Tony jolts awake and his eyes dart around his cage. Doc’s face has appeared in a peephole that popped out of nowhere. Tony blinks.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tracks down Bruce by dinner and sends him an encrypted and coded message. He makes sure no one can trace the signal back to him or be able to track the message to Bruce’s location.
Tony narrows his eyes, “You wouldn’t dare.”
"Well, considering I've just woken up after being most decidedly dead-- yeah, I'm just peachy." Tony laughs a little at the look of horror that passes over Steve's face.
"Shit, he progressed to 10 centimeters, we need that evac
“STARK!”
She doesn’t look surprised.
“They’re calling it the SHRA.”
, alright? I'll be fine, but maybe they won't be. So, I need you to go and back them up; swoop in and save the day."
“Tony…” Helen frowns.
An odd sensation floods through his belly when he's trying to pull his pants up. A warmth... and then...
"Well. Guess I'm calling Cap, then."
“Hmm…” Jacey gets a thoughtful look on her face, “You know, I think I remeber back in one of my college classes there was a case study going on. I think it had to do with similar situations to yours right now.”
"Are they? Cuff 'im, soldiers."
“Jacey–”
Goodbye, goodbye."
pisses her off. She’d seen the goddamn news. She’d seen Steve and Barnes mauling Stark, and that was enough to really get her blood boiling because
Everyone’s staring at him like he’s gone a little funky. He thinks maybe he has.
"I. Don't. Know." Tony huffs almost inaudibly.
for this, Stark.”
"Sure, big guy, go ahead," Tony nods.
"No," Vis automatically refutes with no hesitation.
his wife mimics,
“No,” she says, “he doesn’t, does he? He just thought it was a regular ol’ bond.”
“So impatient, young Padawan,” she smirks. “I may or may not have said something about the content he was watching in public, rather loudly, to my friends. Mind you, I was rather shy back in the day, so I really thought he hadn’t heard me,” she snickers.
It sucks that this Stark didn't see Stane for the snake he was sooner. Tony can only imagine how dealing with all that must have felt. Holy Hell, Stark has too many goddamned companies. Tony feels it's... almost a little too imperious.
