“That’s pineapple, and if you like it, we can try to make sure you have some with your meals,” Pepper said, making a quick note of Bucky’s preference in her book along with everything she’d written down after talking to the others. “Is there anything else that stood out to you?”
“And so are our services, Sire, for anything you need,” Fury grinned, finally giving Tony a little bow. Hopefully he could solve their boot shortage while they were at it, there were more than a few toes poking out here and there. Definitely not the image a king wants for the front line in his defense. “When you know more about what’s going on, let me know and I’ll be here to help.”
“Anthony Edward Stark, do you accept these two men into your heart? Do you pledge to give them the best of yourself every single day? Do you swear your loyalty to them through troubles or triumphs?” asked the priest as he reached out to touch Tony’s shoulder.
“Nice to meet you, Ms. Carr,” Steve said, shaking her hand, his nerves kicking up a bit.
“It is…” Steve’s fingers found their way inside Bucky again, but he was pretty sure that his husband didn’t need more stretching out. It was still fun to play with him though, and to have him leaning back into his hand in desperation for more. “Bucky, I don’t know if I should keep teasing you or not, it’s so fucking hard not to just take you now. But it’s so much fun to watch you squirm.”
“I’m bringing my mother,” Steve wondered what she would think of everything going on. He knew he’d have her cheering him on as he courted the King. “So I suppose two for me.”
“If I backed out now, the people would riot,” Tony pointed out as he smoothed his hand over his beard, wanting to look smart for the crowd. “And they’re all drunk, so it would be a messy riot with lots of vomit. I don’t want that in the history books under my name.”
“Mhm?” Tony looked up from his throne, sitting upon it with red rimmed eyes. He’d been there for hours, since he’d announced the deaths of his fiancés, doing his best to act like he was in mourning. So far it had to have been working since everyone was avoiding him unless they were giving him empty platitudes about the men he loved being at the feast of the gods now. Hopefully Pepper would have more to say.
“You could have at least gotten our husband a five star bucket,” Steve joked, watching Bucky take a slow drink of his tea. “So how are we going to get him out of here when the time does come?”
“If…if you want. Bucky?” Steve asked, not sure why Tony wanted their appointment to be pushed up, though he supposed that he was just stressed out.
“I…I had the Rogerses at least,” Bucky admitted, figuring their past was bound to pop up here and there. He might as well be forthright with it. “Sarah was kind of like a second mom to me. It really hurt me when…when things went bad.”
“…fine,” Pepper finally conceded, gritting her teeth as she admitted to herself that this was just going to keep going in circles. “You can wear that if you go up there right this instant and make an appearance. And you’re going to stay there, eat, and be social!”
“It’s happening again…Steve! Oh fuck, it’s closer! It’s a lot closer!” Bucky gritted his teeth, softly screaming through them as his hand tightened on Steve, his knuckles turning white. “It’s so much worse…oh god, I can’t do this…”
“Your father would have wanted you to marry for love,” Stane corrected him before he could stop himself. “Or to better the position of the Kingdom. Your father loved the crown and his people, he was a good king.”
“You have our word,” Tony said from the front seat, swallowing hard as he knew how hard it was going to be to get through the rest of the day without losing his mind. He wasn’t going to be the one to shatter the very delicate shell Bucky was trying to put around himself. “We’re almost at the airport. I’m going to go deal with everything, you two stay in the car where no one can see you.”
“Y-yeah, I’d…i just have to wait until my divorce goes through and then we can do it,” Steve stammered a little, feeling like he’d been knocked to his feet, the breath knocked out of him. “Bucky, are you sure? You can take more time to think about it if you want, no one’s rushing you.”
“It’s fine, the bike gives me something to do,” Bucky said, pushing his long hair out of his face, tucking it behind his ears. It didn’t bother him to sit around with messy hair and rumpled pyjamas, he couldn’t count how many people had seen him like that, or completely naked. Either way, he had no shame.
“You know the best part of of having two husbands?” Bucky asked Steve after a few minutes of peace, though his eyes were firmly on the children now as they worked on what looked like a sand airport with their toys. “Other than the obvious that you both keep me incredibly satisfied as shown by the fact that I’m pregnant for the fifth time in five years?”
“Dr. Marner had her price, did you know she has a son with drug addiction issues? What am I saying, of course you did, you offered to send him to the best rehabilitation place in the world. We did it a little differently, we just mailed her his finger,” Howard said casually, shrugging as he smiled again, obviously quite pleased with his ability to outplay his son. “She’s very, very sorry, though, but really, she couldn’t say no to us.”
“I’m your friend, Steve, through anything, not just the good times,” Sam said, reaching over to squeeze his arm, forcing a smile. “I hope you can be happy with him, in some way.”
“I’m fine if he’s fine, I have no ill will towards him,” Steve looked down at his hands clasped in front of him, and then back up to Tony. “I’m sure there won’t be any trouble.”
“Stand up, I’m not talking to air,” Howard said sharply, heading over to look at what he was working on, wondering if it was something they could use, or if it’s more like the chocolate milk machine Tony built when he was nine. Even he was surprised how big the explosion was. “What is this? It looks like a…table monster.”
“You’re going to get to go to sleep soon, and when you wake up, the twin will be here and hopefully you can go home soon,” Steve said, though he knew this was major surgery and Bucky might need more care after than he and Tony could provide. “We just have to get you inside, baby, can you do that?”
“Only a few, and I still want to kick him,” Bucky chuckled, his nervousness around the lottery eased for the moment. “I swear to the gods, if I ever see St-“
“Why don’t we give Bucky some space, this was a lot for today,” Ms. Carr said with a fake smile, wanting to break up this conversation before it could get started, touching Steve’s arm to catch his attention and lead him out of the room. “I’m sure Steve will come back tomorrow, Bucky. The nurse will be here soon for your check up, she’s bringing your dinner.”
“I am,” Bucky said with a laugh, relief washing over him as his thumb moved to touch his new ring, not wanting this hug to end. “I don’t know much about weddings but this is supposed to end in a kiss, right?”
Scooping up some of the slick lotion, Steve’s hand moved between Bucky’s legs, holding his breath as he slowly pushed the pads of his fingers against Bucky’s entrance. Immediately the tips of his fingers disappeared inside him, and Steve let out the breath he’d be holding. It was so warm inside Bucky, so tight, it was just like he remembered, but he wanted to feel more. Pulling his fingers back, he got more of the substance on them before sliding inside Bucky again, stretching him carefully before adding a third.
“I asked before, they thought it would be better if we didn’t. In case we pulled on one of your sensors, knock something out of place,” Steve let go of Bucky to get up to fix his blanket, tucking him in carefully. “We need you to rest right now, that’s the best thing for you and the twins.”
“Not this again,” Tony moaned, leaning back in his chair and covering his eyes in an attempt to hide from his uncle and all the protocol and institution he’d dragged into the room with him.
“He is, King Anthony is right,” Von Doom lied through his teeth, only seeing Wakanda as his next conquest after he was done fleecing the Iron kingdom. “Too bad he couldn’t be here himself.”
“Uatu, the Watcher, is always looking down on us,” the priest continued, his voice trembling as he spoke out loud enough for everyone to hear. “He was watching down on those who wished ill for Steven and James, he was watching when that person had them torn from this life, and he was watching when King Anthony learned of his loss. Though he does not interfere in any way, that does not mean he doesn’t have his eyes focused on us all. He is here in this room right now, looking down on us, recording our words and actions for the other Gods to examine.”
“You haven’t won yet, princess,” Namor said, ignoring the look Natasha was giving him. “Don’t worry about it until you have something to worry about.”
“We could work something out to at least start like that,” Steve was sure that had to be true, and if anyone could find a doctor to work with them, Tony could. “Why don’t we see if we can do that tomorrow?”
“I’m sure,” Steve let Tony guide him into position, finally stilling his hips as he waited for Tony to enter him, knowing he could continue then. “Bucky, do you want me to do anything different? Are things good?”
“And I love you with all my heart,” Steve gave Bucky a squeeze, glad that they were nearing the road finally. He’d definitely got his workout for the day, he’d have to carry Bucky around more, though hopefully not with an extra sixty pounds on him. “How are you doing, baby? You holding in for me?”
“Our bed sounds perfect,” Tony said, hoping that this was Bucky’s not so subtle way to get them all naked together. “Need a hand up the stairs?”
“I agree, take it off,” Tony chimed in, winking at Bucky and blowing him a kiss. “I have been dying to see you with less clothing, and I don’t give a shit if you’re missing an arm, or if you have a hundred nipples, I want to see you. You’re beautiful just as you are.”
Which was why he didn’t hear the sound of a sword being unsheathed in the shadows.
“Completely. If I didn’t have you two, I’d be renting still,” Tony chuckled as he took the last ring and turned to face Bucky, bringing his hand to his mouth and kissing it. “You two are keepers.”
“Thank you, good sir,” Tony said as he walked up to the pulpit, looking out over the crowd as he allowed a tear to escape his eye and run down his cheek. “S-sorry, I…”
“So what were you going to say, baby?” Steve asked, looking at Bucky, then over his head to Tony on his other side. “He said he was going to tell me what the best thing about having two husbands is.”
“So you’ve developed a servant to hold your water bottle for you wherever you want?” Howard asked, leaning down to pick it up so he could examine it. “The joints in the legs, I think you could do with more.”
“James Barnes,” Bucky said softly, though he didn’t move. He looked more uncomfortable than anything, not sure what to do with his hand until he put it behind him. “…Bucky Barnes.”
“I don’t know, I definitely don’t have those answers for you,” Rhodey reached over, touching his friend’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “All I know is if you really want this, you should fight for it. You can change laws, remember? If anyone can sort all of this, you can.”
“You might as well alert some people to carry their luggage that way, and you can lead King Von Doom there yourself,” Tony took a sip of his drink, just wanting to pour another one. He was obviously going to have to play the nice, welcoming King on top of his plan. It sounded exhausting.
Nothing, save for one thing.
“You don’t have time to throw some roadblocks in his way? You can’t tell him no? He signed your damn tax hike, why wouldn’t he sign something declaring that he’s to marry me?” asked Von Doom, his tone getting louder and angrier. “You promised me this, Stane!”
“It is your iron, Your Majesty, that’s why it’s the best,” Von Doom smiled, taking every chance he had here to butter up Tony. He wasn’t sure what of his reputation had preceded him, so he was going to have to try extra hard to seem like a better man than he was.
“I’m already going out of my mind. If you don’t go now, my head is going to explode,” Tony tried to sound serious, but his voice broke as he used his hands to mime his head exploding in a ball of fire. “Steve, save me, Steve…”
“Isn’t it? You didn’t try to kill the men I love twice?” Tony demanded, stepping away from the pulpit and closer to his guilty Uncle. “You didn’t steal from this kingdom? You didn’t tell me for years that taxes were low and prosperity was high? And meanwhile, the only one prospering was YOU! You selfish, petty, small man…” Tony took a deep breath, shaking his head. “You have no place in my life any more. I have half a mind to just let Von Doom there take you back to Latveria with him. Just half a mind, though.”
As James “Rhodey” Rhodes made his way through the castle, he leaned on the polished wood cane the King had gifted him after a jousting accident. The pain wasn’t bad as long as he had that, though it had taken some getting used to. He was impressed that Tony had felt guilty enough about what happened to carve him his own custom cane. He didn’t blame Tony for the accident, he’d chosen to be there, it was just poor luck that saw the King’s lance striking him as it did. It was part of the risk of being a knight, something he accepted long before he was injured.
“I don’t know…” Bucky didn’t move an inch, keeping his voice as low as possible. “Maybe it’s just Namor, maybe-“
“The wedding’s in six days, you two are going to have to get prettied up with new suits,” Tony said after they’d all had a moment to just take each other in. “I’m thinking you can both walk up the aisle arm in arm now that...well, now that I know you don’t hate each other.”
“Good, good, I like hearing that,” Tony said with relief, glad that he wasn’t going to have to put them in separate wings or something.
“I don’t think the royal treasurers would like that much,” Sarah chuckled, joining in on her son’s amusement by all this. She did like that she had something to look forward to besides work and cooking, life was going to be so boring when it was over.
“Back in Dawson City, for now anyway because of the police investigation. I told you Dr. Marner still wants to look after him, and we’ve brought him to the hospital once now, he’s not a secret any more,” Tony was relieved of that, though he was still sure that Bucky would want to remain low key. “I know this is where Bucky wants to be, it’s remote, he loves it here. We will have to occasionally return to civilization, or I will for work, you two can stay where you want. We will need to renovate the house to put in more bedrooms for the twins, maybe that can get taken care of when we have to go to the mansion next.”
“Okay…here goes…” Tony breathed, knocking on the door and stepping back a bit, not wanting to seem like he was trying to crowd anyone. As he heard footsteps on the other side, he smoothed out his black casual clothes, having left the semi-formal outfit Pepper picked out on his bed.
“I think Dad would have approved of this,” Tony joined Stane, watching out and readying himself to go out there and choose his intended. “Maybe…right?”
“Fuck yeah,” Bucky said as he pulled back, pressing another kiss to Tony’s cock before he switched from his elbow back to his hand propping him up. “Steve’s never been fucked, be careful, okay?”
Tony winced a little as he heard Strange swear from behind the stage area, but he hoped that it would work. He didn’t want to see anyone get hurt over this. He was just going to owe Strange big time, hoping he hadn’t bought himself a debt that he couldn’t repay. He would deal with that later, he had this to concentrate on for the moment.
“What do they do?” Bucky asked, looking at them all, not sure if he should touch them or not. On closer inspection, they didn’t look like the toys he was used to seeing.
“Let’s go make it more fun,” Tony laughed as they headed for the stairs, going up and into the east wing where Bucky and Steve had been staying. Tony was hoping to move them down the hall to his own room later, but he hadn’t had a good chance to bring it up. “Think we should sneak up on him?”
When Steve had first come to to Stark Industries, his orientation had been a pleasant experience. He’d joined the company at the same time as two other women, and after pictures were taken for badges, they’d discussed the clearance and security system over a vanilla and strawberry layer cake. He was shown his first office, which he’d shared with three other people at that point, and told what was and wasn’t allowed for decor. It was all pretty standard, and by the time lunch break was over, Steve was going over the presentation about company standards regarding dealing with customers. After he’d finished that, he was given a rather large gift basket of shirts, a coffee mug, and a few other Stark branded items that he’d struggled to take home on the bus, feeling like an idiot trying to hold everything on his lap. It had been a good first day, as first days went, though he had to admit he didn’t feel like a member of “Team Stark” quite yet. He’d give it time though, this was a great job, he just had to give it one hundred percent. He had to give it a real chance.
“If you know it, it must be true,” pushing the muscles in his cheek to pull back his lips further, Stane didn’t know if he was smiling or wincing. “Go to your work, Your Highness, and I’ll see to your vision with Pepper and your staff.”
Nodding at her, Steve stepped slowly into the bedroom, not surprised how much it smelled like cleaning solution. Everything in the room was spotless, except for the bed which was unmade and obviously well slept in. All the books and video games on the shelves were organized, the walls empty except for a few shelves with neat little toys on them, and the floor bare everywhere but where Bucky sat, a large flat pillow underneath him. The only thing that Steve couldn’t begin to explain was a single picture on the wall of Tony Stark, Howard Stark’s son and heir to Stark Industries, that raised a lot more questions than he felt comfortable asking right now.
“What are you talking about? It’s a good thing you did, now we can figure out who is trying to kill him and Steve,” Natasha didn’t look happy about this in the least, clearly worried about her friend.
“Steve? Alright, I can do that,” Tony nodded, gesturing for one of his servants to get them each a glass of his private whiskey. “I suppose if I’m courting you two, we might as well be on a first name basis. You may call me Tony in private, but you should stick to ‘Sire’ in public. For now, anyway.”
“Yeah, I suppose…” Tony gently smacked the wood end of the tool against his palm as he thought about what his uncle was saying. It would be nice to have someone around that knew the ins and outs of ruling a kingdom.
“He’s got a chip in him somewhere that…your father says if he crosses the threshold of the house, he’ll be electrocuted, and it will just keep getting worse until he gets back in the safe zone of the house, or….or he dies,” Steve began, immediately liking Tony more than Howard, feeling sure that things were going to be better with him around already. “And if he gets pregnant, only your father’s people can treat him, neither of us has any idea what he’s done to Bucky, not really.”
“Then why didn’t you pick Namor?” Bucky asked, not sure if he was more angry or uncomfortable
“I never thought that I would get to the point of my life where I’d live in a house in the middle of nowhere Canada with a hose that we put in specifically for my third child. Not even in my nightmare scenario where I’ve lost everything,” Tony said with a false pained sigh, turning to look back at Bucky, who’d been joined by Steve again. “We could be living in the top cities in the world, in a mansion, with a team of nannies and housekeepers, you both know that, right?”
“And he’s not married yet, is he? We have time!”
Taking the ring box, Bucky opened it, taking out what looked like the biggest of the bands, nodding at Tony who leaned over to hold Steve’s hand still. Slipping the ring onto his finger, Bucky looked into Steve’s eyes for a moment before leaning over to hug him tightly for a moment. As Bucky sat back in his spot, he turned to Tony, biting his lip as his eyes plead for Tony to go next.
“I’d love to,” Bucky grinned, his heart skipping a beat as Tony’s fingers slid across the small of his back, moving to pick up another music box. He wasn’t sure what he liked more, the clever inventions, or the wonderful company, but he knew there’d be a clear winner by the end of the evening.
“I…I don’t know…” Bucky shook his head, his heart thundering hard in his chest. “I don’t know…I don’t want to go to a doctor.”
“Does he know you’re getting someone new for him? Will he know about me?” Steve asked, his hand resting on the box.
“Great, Bucky’s great, I think I’m really going to like it here,” Steve said, the weirdness of the situation finally starting to kick in. He’d worked here for years without seeing the man, and now all of a sudden Stark was on a first name basis with him. And what did this have to do with the fact that Tony Stark’s picture was in the room? “We were just getting to know each other.”
“I don’t know why we couldn’t have a relaxed first meal with them,” Tony grumbled, getting out of his chair before Pepper chose to hit him with the book next. “Wouldn’t they be more at ease if this was nice and casual?”
“It’s okay, I promise,” Bucky leaned against his fiancé, letting out a tired sigh. He was exhausted, he just wanted to go back to bed. He hadn’t realized how much he’d needed the sleep until he’d begun it. “We should wait for Tony to talk. Hopefully he doesn’t take very long.”
The second it clattered to the floor, Tony was over in a flash, pulling Bucky into his arms and onto his lap, rocking him slowly. He felt like his heart was breaking as Bucky sobbed, feeling both tears and blood soaking into his own shirt as he held him close. The thought that he’d been walking around with that much guilt on his chest hurt him deeply, and looking up into Steve’s eyes, he realized he wasn’t the only one who felt like that.
“Are there bad wizards? Like from bad places?” Tony said finally, figuring that question was safe enough, and that Strange might inadvertently answer it.
“Do you think that was enough?” he asked one of the guards softly.
“Maybe we’ll try to both fuck you at once, you liked that,” Steve offered, knowing that Tony loved when they did that too. He pretty much loved any way they had sex, and Steve had to agree with that. Their love life was incredibly passionate and fun, and it only seemed to grow as time passed.
“Alright…” Steve said, still wondering about Bucky and what he was going to be like. “May I ask what happened to the last guy?”
“I present to you His Royal Majesty, King Victor Von Doom,” one of the trumpeters promptly announced as Von Doom bowed his head slightly forward.
“Ha ha,” Bucky said as he crawled into bed, dragging the blanket over top of him, and flopping himself against the pillows. Looking up at the ceiling, he couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. He had two amazing men in his life now, and they both wanted and loved him, and he couldn’t believe how happy he was.
“Oh gods…” Bucky gasped, looking around the stone room, particularly the pages of paper stuck all over the walls covered in designs. Over in the corner was what looked like a furnace for smelting, next to piles of different shapes of wood. And In the middle of it all was a huge desk covered in lamps, pieces of what he had assumed were metal scattered across it, along with a few partially finished projects.
Bucky didn’t reply, he only looked Steve up and down once before he looked at Natasha and nodded briefly. Natasha didn’t move for a moment, giving Steve one hell of an “I’ll cut you if you wrong him” look before stepping to the side.
“I can assure you, we agree with that,” Sarah looked back and forth between Steve and Bucky, wishing she could have fixed the past between them. “Bucky, I promise you, we don’t want to be enemies. I would never want that. I know there is only going to be one winner in this, but I hope we can make the rest of this time pleasant between us.”
Tucking his arm behind his back, Tony smiled as the wood door swung open, revealing a nicely dressed Bucky Barnes. He hadn’t thought that Pepper would have given Bucky orders to dress up too, but it was too late to go change now. Holding out his hand, he revealed a small wood box in the palm of his hand with a tiny crank on the side.
“Good, good, I’m glad you’ll have people you get along with guarding you,” Tony smiled, popping some roast meat into his mouth, wondering what kind of wine they had in the tent. “Is that everything? No more surprises from either of you? No kids, no undercover spying, none of that?”
“Yeah, I have some baseball video games,” Bucky nodded over at the bookcase of games in the far corner. “They’re probably a lot more fun to play if you’ve played the real game before. I’m pretty good at the them, but…I don’t know.”
“My gods…” Stane wondered if it was too early to start drinking wine.
“I would be in a bad mood if someone tried to kill me too,” Clint admitted, finally tucking his mask into a pouch on his waist, crossing his legs at the ankle to show that he was relaxed and not going anywhere.
“She’s just going to do it more because she knows you don’t want her to,” Bucky said, drinking an orange juice, his hand on his very round stomach. “Let’s just hope Benjamin is less contrary.”
“This isn’t easy for me in any way, I’m sorry if I don’t exactly sound kingly right now,” Tony laughed nervously, planting both hands against the pulpit, taking a deep breath. “I know I’ve got this fancy crown, and a cape, and nice clothes, but I would trade it all to be with Steve and Bucky. They are more to me than anything, more than power or wealth or…I didn’t know what love was until I met them and…”
“Jesus, Bucky,” Tony whimpered as Bucky hit a nerve, bringing the tears even faster. Reaching out to him, he pulled the young man into a hug, crushing him against his chest as he buried his face against Bucky’s shoulder. “I don’t deserve this…I don’t deserve your mercy..”
“Oh, they’re terrible, people are always falling out of them, they let animals in your house, rain just keeps pouring in,” Steve said, shaking his head and trying to look as serious as possible. Meeting Bucky’s eyes, they both quickly gave way to laughter. “You’re not missing anything, I promise, it’s more of a hassle than anything.”
Steve wanted to say he was pleased for Bucky, that he didn’t want anything to happen to his friend either. He didn’t think Bucky wanted to hear from him, though,  and he couldn’t blame him. Steve really had abandoned Bucky when he needed him most, no wonder he hated him. He should have gone to look after Bucky, he should have taken care of him and made sure he knew his sacrifice wasn’t for nothing. Steve was strong and healthy, and it was only because Bucky’d lost his arm for him.
“I like them both. Way too much,” Tony admitted after a moment, his brow furrowed as he frowned. “I can’t choose one, there’s no way. They’re both so clever and sweet and I want to know everything about them.”
“I’m not shocked, that’s a good tactic,” Clint nodded, looking around the room, admiring the artwork. He didn’t usually get to work in places this nice. “I’m glad you’re okay, and I’m glad your friend is okay.”
“One thirty! One hundred thirty! That’s us! That’s us, Bucky! Holy shit, get up there!” Natasha shoved the ticket into Bucky’s hand, a huge smile on her face as she gave him a push towards the stage.
“I thought I saw something, it’s nothing,” Steve’s eyes scanned the mouth of the alley where he thought he saw what he was both looking for and avoiding. Frowning, he pushed it out of his mind as he turned back to the stage as the music started.
“Bucky has changed his mind about something,” Steve said from the other end of the couch, Bucky’s head in his lap. “He wants to find out what we’re having, so I booked an appointment for this afternoon.”
“Uh huh. Steve Rogers, how do you get in and out of that room?” Tony asked, looking around until he spotted a control panel. “Which button?”
“If things were different, we’d have kept you there and have the doctor come to us,” Steve said as he rubbed Bucky’s arm, looking down at him and feeling genuinely guilty this birth couldn’t go the way Bucky wanted it to. “There has to be a doctor and someone to help knock you out so you don’t feel her cutting into you. There’s no way you could deal with that if you stayed awake.”
“Good to know, I’ll bust out the blender,” Tony said, sticking his head in the gym, not spotting Steve. “Okay, Sherlock, where is he now?”
“We have to cut their heads off too,” Clint added with a grin, not knowing how the others couldn’t see the humour in this. Then again, it wasn’t his life on the line.”
“It’s fine, Bucky. No one’s upset, just worry about right now. We’re here with you now,” Tony said as he tried to drive both carefully and fast, which wasn’t working very well judging by the sounds of Bucky throwing up into his bucket. “Sorry, sorry…OH sorry!” He was doing his best to dodge the potholes, but he only managed to steer them into other ones.
“You…” Bucky just laughed and blushed, pulling over a blanket to cover them both with. “I like when you say it too, you know.”
“Second last!” Bucky blurted before Steve could lower the glass of whiskey from his lips. “Sorry, Steve, looks like you’re first.”
“Hopefully it won’t get much worse and Dr. Marner can get them out of you soon,” Steve pulled Bucky over into a hug as Tony got back in the SUV and began to drive towards town. “You should have woken us up, I don’t like the thought of you suffering alone.”
He had no idea where he was heading, he didn’t know exactly who he was supposed to talk to, he just knew that the cart was going to come to a stop and things would be “handled” from there. And something about that term made this seem even stranger. As the car drove down to the end of a hall, it turned into a small bay just before the door at the end, pulling into the only vacant spot. Not sure what to do now, he got out of the car and stood beside it, but he wasn’t going to have to wait long.
“It’s not as bad as I thought it would be,” Steve joined Tony at his side, reaching to take Bucky by the hand, giving it a squeeze. “I mean, I think I was picturing the worst, and even then, it didn’t matter to me. It’s just hard to see that you went through something so painful for me.”
“Excellent, I look forward to hearing from you. Bucky, take care,” Dr. Marner said with a smile, ending the conversation on her end as Tony turned back towards his partners.
“It’s a reprieve from foot pain, I’d imagine,” Strange said as he opened the door further to let the King into his sanctuary. “I’m telling you right now, I’m not making money rain from the sky or something. I don’t feel like causing a riot.”
“Hey,” Steve said as he went straight to the bed, pulling back the blankets to lay beside him, putting his hand on the small of Bucky’s back. “Tell us what you’re thinking, okay? It doesn’t help to hold it in, remember?”
“That does sound like a better idea, I think we will need supplies,” Steve said, unable to help looking over at the other two men. He’d especially wanted to see Bucky like this for a while, but he was definitely happy that Tony was involved in it too. Taking off his towel, he tossed it back in the bathroom, making a note to clean up later. “Where’s your room?”
“…it’s my stomach, I…” Bucky tugged his blanket up further so it covered his shoulders, curling into a ball underneath it. “Every time I think about leaving, about having kids, I get sick. What if Tony hates me? What if I’m just…kept in the basement alone to have his children and never see the light of day again? What if I’m just some slave to them?”
“I’d…I’d like that…” Tony nodded, not quite knowing where to begin. “Steve was…Steve was so brave, but so gentle. I can see why he became a soldier, he wanted to protect people from the bad in the world. He wanted this to be a good place, and I want to make it one for him. He was one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever known, and that’s not talking about his looks. I mean inside, where it really counts.”
He also didn’t want Howard Stark to kill him if he found out his marriage broke up.
“Isn’t that interesting, I wouldn’t have thought goats would like music,” Tony shook his head, polishing off his whiskey, and getting the bottle again. “Do you want us to get you some goats? Or someone to accompany you on an instrument?”
Steve was glad that it wasn’t a long trip to the castle, but every foot still seemed like a mile. By the time they got there, his stomach had calmed, having told himself that these people wouldn’t save them from being murdered only to murder them at the castle. He couldn’t wait to talk to Tony, though, he wanted to know if he knew who would have attacked them. Someone definitely knew something they weren’t telling him.
“I will find them,” Stane said, bowing out of the tent, just happy to be away from his nephew and his new boyfriends for a bit.
“Sorry. Sorry. Okay,” Tony tried to take another deep breath, mentally willing his heart to slow as he took another long drink of whiskey. “I have to be completely and totally honest. I didn’t think this would happen, I didn’t think when I did this lottery that I’d actually fall for someone, much less…I just didn’t think this was going to happen. I thought I’d have a friendly marriage, I thought it would be nice and easy, but this isn’t easy at all. This is the complete fucking opposite of that. This is-“
“We’ll see about that,” Tony said, getting to his feet and pulling the magnifying lens over so it was above the small section he’d been tinkering with. His mind was so wrapped up with the new idea that occurred to him that he hadn’t noticed his uncle leaving.
“You really want that?” Tony’s eyebrows lifted as his inner Pepper got a lot quieter. She’d told him to keep this romantic and not about inventions and such, but if that’s what Bucky wanted, he couldn’t exactly say no.
“I think you have it, Bucky,” Tony said as the last little piece splintered away, frowning when he saw the spot of blood on Bucky’s shirt. “No no no, you’re done. No more.” Reaching for Bucky, he wasn’t surprised when the younger man pulled away, going at a bit of floor that didn’t appear to have anything on it. “Bucky!”
“Then that’s what you’ll have,” Tony reassured him, looking down at Buck as he continued to play with his hair. “…can I request one thing?”
“Alright, what do you have to work with?” asked Von Doom, seeming to lean back in his own seat. “Where do you think you can start?”
“No, I just wrote it in my head,” Bucky smiled, hugging Steve back as the man kissed him. “I can write it down though, I won’t forget it or anything. Why, do you want a copy?”
“They do, yes,” nodded Bucky, still feeling flushed, kicking himself hard mentally for saying anything. He’d already screwed up, he might as well keep going with it. “They like more upbeat songs in the daytime, and slow ones at night. But they always stay by my side if I sing to them, none of them try to wander off.”
“What is it?” Tony’s interests were piqued for the moment as he leaned forward. He’d seen lots of metal before, but this looked a bit different than what he was used to working with.
“Don’t worry,” Tony put his hand up to silence Bucky, taking a bite from his cheese. “Whatever happens between us, I’m sure I can come to an agreement about your friend. I’ve never been so poor I had to steal, but that doesn’t mean I’m not sympathetic. She’ll be fine.”
“He’s hurting too, and it wouldn’t be fair of me to recognize that,” Bucky replied, getting under the blankets, lying his head down on the pillow as he stared up at the ceiling. “I don’t want him to be sad, he doesn’t deserve that, he didn’t do anything.”
“Burn some corpses up?” Clint suggested, looking at Natasha, and shrugging. “I mean, if we dug two up and lit the beds on fire.”
“And what happens to me when he’s done with me?” Bucky asked desperately, his wild hair framing his tear drenched cheeks, eyes bright blue and red lined.
The babies are here, and what will the future hold for the family?
Tony didn’t respond for a moment, too busy mentally high fiving himself to think about speaking a full sentence with actual English words. He felt like he’d hit the lottery with Steve and Bucky in his life already, and all he could think was that he didn’t want to screw this up somehow. Bucky was an absolute treasure, and Steve was one of the nicest guys he’d met in a long time, he was looking forward to every moment he was going to spend with them. Especially the naked ones.
“You promised me a wedding, Stane,” Von Doom whispered sharply from the front row where the two men were sat side by side.
“Bucky, we have to get out of here now,” Steve said, his voice serious and stern to cover the fear flowing through him.
“It is. Bucky will have to serve out his punishment at home, because we’re having two girls. Sorry you got last choice, Bucky, it’s just because we weren’t going to make you go in the car either way,” Tony winked at his smaller husband, giving him a smile. “I think you’ll like your punishment, don’t worry.”
“And do the goats like it?” Tony asked next, genuinely interested in Bucky’s hobby of goat serenading. He didn’t know much about animals, but he was always happy to hear stories about them.
“You were lucky to have had two such wonderful men win your lottery,” Pepper’s voice was sad as she set her pencil down against the page she’d just been writing on. “I was scared you were going to find someone awful and bring them here. I liked both Steve and Bucky though, they were polite, nice men.”
“I don’t know yet,” Tony shrugged, picking up his coffee again, finding he needed that way more than he needed food. “We’ll find out in a couple weeks, I suppose.”
“Let me drive, I need to concentrate, my head is going in fifty directions,” Tony said, taking a turn towards the airport, hoping his connection had secured a private plane for them that could keep this trip off the records. There was a reason he’d taken as much cash as he had from the house, he expected to have to bribe more than a few people along the way.
“Oh really?” Steve laughed, wishing he could stop blushing, but he’d never had a third party watch him have sex before. Hell, he’d also never  slept with another man before, today was a day of lots of firsts. “I think I like the sound of those plans, Bucky what do you th-“
“Why not?” Bucky cocked his head, looking back to Tony.
“Same here,” said Steve, who was entirely too impatient with all this talk and not enough action. Scooping Bucky up into his arms, he walked across the wood floor to the bed, placing him down onto it as he looked down at what was left of his clothes. “Mind if I take these off?”
“I don’t know…I’m…don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine when we’re there,” Bucky mumbled, pulling the blanket Tony had taken from the plane around him tighter. “It’s okay, I just want to look at the trees…”
“Then talk to me about meaningful things, not how much I like my hay bed,” Bucky laughed quietly, knowing they had to keep relatively silent just in case. “I wish we had something to do up here.”
“How does he expect to rule both kingdoms if his is way in the North?” raising an eyebrow, Tony leaned back in his chair, cocking his head to the right a little.
“Maybe if you ask nice,” Steve teased, reaching to take his hand in his own before resting them both on Bucky.
“Will you talk to someone? You got a doctor to do video calls for a pregnant man, I’m sure you can find a therapist to talk to that way, and I can take Bucky somewhere so you have privacy,” Steve suggested, trying to keep his voice calm and gentle, knowing that the last thing Tony needed right now was a fight, and they’d already narrowly avoided one.
“I honestly don’t know,” Pepper hadn’t been included in that meeting, but she’d heard afterwards from Stane that it had happened. “I know it was a lot, that’s it, but I have no idea what that amount would be.”
“Night, Tash…” Bucky called out as he took off his shirt and trousers, just letting them fall to the floor on top of his discarded boots. His hair was still in a neat braid from Tony earlier, and he planned on sleeping with it like that.
Raising his hand to knock again, Steve bit down on his bottom lip, mentally willing himself to rap his knuckles against it. Squeezing his fist tight, he took a long breath in, wincing as his wrist flexed, causing a singular strike of his index knuckle against the wood surface. It was pathetic, but there was a chance it was at least heard inside.
“I…” Tony hadn’t thought about that part of the funeral preparations, but he supposed he had to do this. He hated talking about Steve and Bucky like this, even knowing that they were okay. “I haven’t paid attention to the last funerals I was at, I’ll be honest with you. What should I say?”
“Do you want me to take yours off?” Tony said, waiting for the tight little nod Bucky gave him before he slowly began to lower his boxers, his eyes staying on Bucky’s looking for any sign of fear or nervousness beyond normal anticipation. When he was confident that Bucky was truly alright, he pushed his shorts off his hips, careful of his erection, waiting until they’d fallen to the floor. Taking a step forward, he put his hands on Bucky’s shoulders, rubbing them before he pulled him into a kiss, pressing their bodies together.
“Oh gods no. No no no…” Tony shook his head, feeling like he was going to start crying again as he took a healthy gulp of whiskey. “Not at all, I’ve been…fuck.”
“Sire, what are you doing?!”
“That doesn’t make me feel too much better,” Steve wrapped an arm around Bucky once he was sure that they wouldn’t be seen. “Will we see Tony tonight?”
“You’re also a thief, you’re also a part of the revolution of our people,” Natasha said in a hurried whisper, pointing right at Bucky. “You got us this far.”
Stepping out of the bathroom, he patted his leg when he realized the husky pup Tony and Steve had gotten him as a belated birthday present was staring at him. “Come on, Laika,” he called softly, heading downstairs to the living room with his dog in tow. Spreading out on the couch, he pulled a blanket down over himself as Laika got behind his knees. The pain was still there, almost like an echo, but he didn’t think he needed to wake Steve and Tony about it. Hopefully they’d understand why he spent the rest of the night on the couch.
“Okay, so the guards didn’t hear anything somehow,” Bucky said as he came walking back into the room a couple of minutes later, watching as the other two raised their heads. “They’ve gone to get Steve and Tony.”
“Will you tell me what you honestly want?” Bucky asked, curling up against Steve as he pulled his knees up.
“We don’t have crowns made up, do we?” the priest asked in a shaky voice as he slowly got up and moved over to them.
“It’s funny you say that,” Howard said, leaning against the couch as Bucky was forced down onto it by Howard’s guard, watching as the doctor unpacked his portable ultrasound to get the sample without stabbing a fetus. “I read an article the other day saying that CEOs of big corporations have psychopathic tendencies, and I went through all of the other large company owners that I know, and I could see it. In them, not in myself, but you’re never really the best judge of your own character, are you?”
“That’s understandable,” Stane nodded sagely, bringing a hand up to stroke his beard as he turned his body to face Tony better. “But Tony, it’s not real. They won’t be married to you, they won’t be buried Kings. They won’t count for you keeping your crown.”
“Steve, I’m getting close…” Bucky had gasped, his metal hand gripping a handful of bedding and twisting it into a ball as Steve pounded into him. He could feel it building every time Steve’s cock hit that good spot deep within him, and it was getting harder to breathe each time. Looking up at him, Bucky’s half lidded eyes met with Steve’s as he felt his orgasm building inside him, swelling and hitting him hard before he had a chance to warn his lover. Squirting out onto his bare, flat stomach, Bucky let out a desperate cry, not even thinking of how loud he was, unable to think of anything more than Steve in that moment.
“Please tell me you’re not serious. This is a really fucked up joke…” Tony said, putting a hand over his mouth as he sat down on his work station, his breathing getting heavier and faster. “This isn’t funny…”
“That’s…that’s so generous. Thank you,” Steve turned himself in a circle looking at everything in the room. He couldn’t believe how much paint she had, he’d always dreamed of painting something himself. There was no way he could have afforded to before now. “Thank you so much, I can’t say that enough.”
“Goodbye,” he mouthed, raising his sword over his head, about to bring it down in one motion when Bucky rolled over in his sleep. Pausing for a moment, he didn’t move an inch as he looked down at the man’s closed eyes, waiting for them to open. Convinced once again that he was asleep, Ronin slowly rose his blade, envisioning bringing it down through Bucky’s throat.
“That is a lot of food…” Steve ran his hands through his hair, loving how clean it felt. They’d had baths before they went to bed last night, and though Steve had complained at the time, he was happy with the job the servant had done in cleaning him up, especially his nails.
“No, I suppose not,” Tony didn’t care if this wasn’t his fault, it was still done for him, and he couldn’t forget that. “…does he hate me?”
“We’re going to be lauded as geniuses, the next great idea in royalty,” Tony was pretty drunk on top of being blissfully happy, and it was showing. “Fuck Von Doom, I never wanted to marry him for a second. Why would I want more land when I can have you two?’
“I’m your best friend right now,” Fury didn’t lower his hand, but he did lower his voice. “Your friend was attacked and killed before we could do anything for him, I’m sorry. The fire’s been put out, you’re safe now, but I’m still taking you back to the castle.”
“So this apprentice I promised you…” Tony began, curious as to what that searching process would be like. “How are you going to find one?”
“So what? Tell them to fuck off, it’s your life,” Rhodey shrugged, not really knowing what else to say. “You’re the King, who’s telling you that you can’t have two husbands.”
“I mean, when he was three years old, we saved him after a car accident killed his family, and we brought him to Stark Industries. We put a synthesized womb inside him, cloned from his sister’s, and we’ve housed him ever since,” Howard said, frowning as Tony leaned on his work station, a hand over his heart. “Tony, what’s wrong?”
“It feels so weird…” Bucky had to laugh, not used to having something hanging off that shoulder any more, reaching to touch it with his flesh hand. “It’s amazing, I’m…can I look in the mirror?”
“I don’t want you risking your life for me,” Bucky argued as he kicked away a bigger piece of rotted wood now, the exposed spot about half the size for them to get out. He was running out of time, but he couldn’t figure out a way to do this faster.
“I don’t see how I was lucky when I brought them here only to lose them,” Tony looked down on the floor between his boots, wishing he could go visit his fiancés now just to remind himself that they were okay. “I feel like it was the unluckiest thing that could have happened. At least if they didn’t get picked, they’d still be alive…”
“The last person to have your job liked him, he called him Bucky, so he’ll probably ask you to as well. He’s prone to anger sometimes, but he’s never hurt anyone, he’s more quiet than anything really,” Ms. Carr said, not planning on answering the rest of the question, figuring Bucky would tell him if he really wanted him to know.  “I do have a couple more questions for you before you sign.”
Watching as Howard left, Bucky brought his knees up to his chest, burying his face against them as he wept brokenly, his hand still clutching Steve’s. Even as Steve let go of him to wrap both arms around him, Bucky didn’t calm down, only as he got tired did his tears start to slow.
“If you’re sure,” Sarah nodded a little, slowly letting go of her son so she could serve him his supper. “I just don’t want to hold you back.”
“…can I ask why?” Steve asked, not sure if he should be getting into questions quite yet. He’d just really met Bucky, he probably shouldn’t be getting too personal with him now.
“…alright, a truce then,” Bucky’s voice was gruff, and his irritation evident, but he extended his hand to Sarah. “Also, we won’t sabotage you, you don’t sabotage us. Let’s play fair, I don’t want to make this dirty.”
And they were ready for it.
“Stop that!”
“Of course, Bucky,” Sarah said as she took his hand, squeezing it between both of hers, smiling at him warmly. “I’ll be happy for you if you win. I wish you nothing but good.”
“Easy, write down the family name on a list along with their number,” Tony grinned, pointing down at her paper. “Write all this down, we don’t want to forget anything.”
“I don’t know, this is ridiculous,” Stane huffed, looking backwards for any sign of his nephew emerging. “He’s probably still upset about them dying or something. He’s acting like a child though, this is just stupid.”
“Admin mode, Carr, Rebecca Anne, four eight zeta nine alpha four,” Ms. Carr said, scanning her own pass, and letting her thumbprint and retina to be scanned before reaching into her bag to pull out another badge that was blank save for a small red star. Sliding it into the slot, she turned to Steve.
“No…” Stane gasped, having to catch the volume of his voice at the last moment there lest he give himself away.
“I have to stay at my optimal weight,” Bucky explained casually, staring blankly over at the corner where the chair had been. “I’m not supposed to gain or lose weight or they modify my diet accordingly. It’s…it’s annoying, but it’s…” Sighing softly, he shook his head again, not wanting to get into this whole mess just yet. Steve seemed nice, he didn’t need to know that Bucky was a freak of nature.
“Oh, I think something’s…” Von Doom looked over his shoulder as the crowd began to get to their feet, slowly standing himself. As the music began to play, he did his best to put on a facial expression that was more neutral and fought the urge to roll his eyes. For the life of him, he didn’t understand what all the fuss was about.
“Okay, so…” Tony had been to a lot of weddings in his lifetime, just none of them were anything like this. Hell, he thought his own would come with a lot more pageantry when the day came. He liked this better. “How about we sit together, and we have to think up a short thing to say to the other two people, and then the other two will put their ring on them. And then we kiss, and you’ll be all ours.”
“He likes spinach and berry smoothies,” Bucky offered, winding his own arm around Tony’s waist, his pulse quickening just being close to him, thinking about what was going to happen. “But he will drink coffee if there’s cream in it.”
“I guess my friend Natasha, she’s not in the guard, but she can beat up anyone,” Bucky shrugged a little, wondering if she would mind taking that position. There wasn’t anyone else in the world that he trusted like her though.
“Don’t talk about yourself like you’re a piece of machinery, Bucky, you’re a living thing. Like a plant,” Tony explained, playing with Bucky’s metal fingers, already delighted with how smooth and cool they were. “Plants grow well inside under artificial lights, but when they have sunlight, and space, and I read somewhere that they need love too. Life is about learning at every age, you’re an adult now, and you’re going to have every opportunity. You’re going to grow, Bucky, you’ve got everything you need to, and I can’t wait to see what you become.”
“Isn’t it? Open concept, new fixtures, new furniture, the guy that built this place was ready to spend his retirement in style,” Tony said, putting the bags down with a sigh, looking up at the balcony where he could hear Bucky moving around. “That’s supposed to be all one big bedroom up there. How’s it look, Bucky?”
“He’s fine, he’s always fine,” Christine said with a laugh, fiddling with the stethoscope around her neck as she headed for the door. “Kind of hard to get sick if you can’t go outside. Speaking of which, don’t come in if you’re ill. Because he’s been in here most of his life and not picked up infections and illnesses, he’s very susceptible to getting sick.”
“Because you’d be dead if I didn’t do it,” Bucky sighed softly, closing his eyes in the dark again. “No matter how angry I was at you, I knew your life meant more than my arm, so I was glad I did it. I was glad you were okay, I just hated you.”
“So we need to sit down and calmly think of a plan,” Stane said with a sigh, wishing he could let go of this ring to take another drink. He needed to keep a clear head, though, this was too important to take any risks, and that included alcohol consumption.
“You’re not out of the running, your input is still important,” Bucky sat up a bit before flopping back against Steve, looking up at him. “I’ve only named stuffed animals as a kid, so I’m probably not going to be any good at it. And we can’t let it all go to Tony.”
“He’s been here since he was four, his family died in a car accident, and he was dying as well. We were able to bring him here and save him, and he’s been here since,” Ms. Carr said, trying to still seem pleasant as Howard Stark told her to keep him there no matter what. Lying outright wasn’t going to work because Bucky could correct him later. They couldn’t be made to seem like they were lying on top of everything else. “It was different before, he had a nanny, he had more nurses, a tutor, and every toy he could ever want.”
Bucky did drop his glass at this point, though just as it shattered to pieces as his feet, he turned to wrap his arm around Steve. Burying his face against him, Bucky broke out into sobs, shaking all over as Tony’s words repeated in his head over and over. Both. He wanted them both. He was going to get to stay with Steve.
“Excellent! Were you thinking Von Doom? I can tell you about the others, but…” Stane laughed softly, the pressure lifting off his shoulders. “For what you want, he really is the best candidate.”
“I love you too,” Bucky sniffed, clutching Steve as close to his body as he could, not wanting to let go of him. “I didn’t want you to die for me, Steve. I didn’t want to lose you either, and I didn’t want to leave Tony alone. I was just…it was fucking scary.”
“There’s definitely only two, right?” Tony said, looking at both of his babies on the screen, unable to keep smiling. Of course he was worried, but he was letting himself have this moment before he gave in to fretting.
After a few minutes of getting comfortable and petting the dog, Bucky was about to close his eyes and get comfortable again when the pain returned, worse this time. It felt like someone was gathering up all his skin and muscle and twisting it to a knot in the middle of his lower back. Whimpering, Bucky’s hand moved out to the coffee table as the other held his stomach. Picking up Tony’s watch that he’d left down there, he noted the time in case the pain faded and came back again, in case it was the one thing he was most terrified of. He wasn’t ready to have twins, he barely knew anything himself, how was he supposed to raise children? He didn’t want to tell Steve and Tony, either, they didn’t need to think he was trying to back out of this on them, he didn’t want to lose them.
“Nice to meet you, Steven, and…James or Bucky,” Tony could tell the second man was bothered by something, but he didn’t want to pry. Maybe he was just shy. “What is it you do?”
“Wine, now,” Stane said flatly to the servant behind him, who immediately rushed to fetch it. Turning back to Tony, he gave his nephew an annoyed look. “You can’t marry a stranger after a month.”
“Don’t involve Sam, not yet,” Tony looked over at Steve, giving him a weak smile. “Or maybe we’ll just send him home with you and Bucky, he and this Namor can protect you. That would be more important to me.”
“But now he’s gone, you’re stronger than he could ever be. That’s why you’re here and he’s not,” Tony smiled despite the pang of guilt at feeling so relieved that his father was dead. Howard Stark wasn’t his family any more, though, that honour belonged only to Bucky and Steve, and the two babies he couldn’t stop thinking about.
“Family will be housed in the Upper East wing, but I want their quarters closer to mine,” Tony said without hesitation, he’d already been thinking about that. He didn’t mind if whomever won brought their family, he wanted them to be happy here.
Steve looked at Ms. Carr with a frown on his face, feeling torn about what to do here. He wasn’t stupid, this wasn’t a small company, he was well aware of the hammer that would come down on him if he was to go straight to the police. They had high power lawyers who could stall things until Bucky could be whisked away. They would have to have protocol in place for someone going to the authorities, an operation this secret and illegal wasn’t going to exist without a solid backup plan.
“Ha ha, shut up,” Tony said as he put the wheelbarrow down to gather more sticks himself. “And the Internet knows how to make stew, so we’ll be fine. I can follow directions.”
“We will,” Steve said, chuckling as Tony stepped out, looking at Bucky once he was gone. “I think it’s amazing that you’ve reached out to Tony like that, I’m really proud of you.”
“I have no idea how I’m supposed to go after that, I should have went first,” Bucky bemoaned, looking up at the amazing picture Steve had painted, in awe that his husband was so talented. “That is seriously amazing, Steve, I love it.”
“I understand…” Steve’s voice was tiny and sad, knowing how badly this was going to hurt her.
“Hell yes, I’m the King,” Tony laughed, adding a third finger to Steve’s entrance, parting them to stretch him further. “I’ve done a lot of decadent stuff in my lifetime, but please believe me, being here with both of you right now is the highlight of my entire life.”
“The other thing we have to discuss is clothing,” Pepper opened her book again, ready to write with her sharpened pencil. “Is there a colour either of you would prefer for your clothes? We’re going to have our tailors start on some outfits for you to wear today, so they’ll be by later to measure you.”
“Fury,” Tony said with a nod towards his uncle, smiling as Nick Fury stepped forward himself with two guards at his side. “Arrest this man for plotting against the crown, attempted murder, theft, and anything else you can possibly throw at him so he spends the rest of his life in a jail cell. You’re lucky I got rid of the death penalty, Uncle, or maybe you’re not. A life inside is going to be a lot more boring than death.”
“What do you have now?” Tony raised an eyebrow, looking back over at the two men. “How many rooms do we need? How many people are you bringing?”
“She just wanted to be held, I’m not the baby whisperer,” Steve said, looking at Bucky, who hadn’t taken his eyes off her. “Do you want a little water or anything? They said you might be nauseous, but they put stuff in your IV.”
“No, I’d have said something, it’s just me,” Clint folded his arms over his chest, wondering if he could ask for a glass of water or something. It might be bad taste, though. “I kind of have two personas. There’s the one that works with others, what Natasha is familiar with, and there’s this one. If there’s anyone else here, I didn’t bring them.”
“I’ll try to be neater,” Steve promised as he wrapped some of the roast meat in a piece of bread, closing his eyes as he took a bite. And in that moment, a selfish part of his brain awoke, telling him he rightly won this life. As much as he felt for Bucky, he didn’t know if he could go back to that shack with his mother. He felt warm here, safe, clean, and now fed. It wasn’t going to be easy to give this up if he failed them.
“Yeah, and it’s a good arm,” Natasha smiled, trying to give him some confidence, but knowing she wasn’t quite succeeding. “You’re able to do pretty much anything anyone else can do, you just do it different.”
“Never,” Natasha picked up another plum, going back to sit down, running a hand down the arm of her red dressing gown. Looking over at Bucky, she couldn’t help but think he looked more distinguished all cleaned up in his matching one. She wasn’t sure about Bucky being a royal at first, but she was starting to see it now.
“Then we have to make sure that doesn’t happen as well,” murmured Von Doom, tapping his finger against the edge of the ring. “We have to convince Tony his crown is too important to throw aside for romance.”
By the time Bucky made it to bed that night, he was completely worn out from his day. He’d started it in the stables with his goats, making sure everyone was fed, watered, and taken care of. Next was an appointment at the tailors, being fitted for the suit for their wedding. After that, he met up with his fiancés in Steve’s studio where they drank, ate, and laughed as Steve worked at painting an apple. It had been a beautiful day, and as they all said their good nights to each other, he couldn’t wait to spend the next day with them as well.
“Mr. Rogers, Mr. Barnes, if you’d like to come with me. The lovely ladies will be staying here,” Tony said, smiling as the two men got to their feet, both looking more than a little nervous. “Come, we’ll have some drinks. Have a chance to talk.”
“How does double pay sound?” Tony asked, hoping some bribery would lighten things up.
“None taken,” Namor said with a shrug of his own, leaning back in his seat. “Barnes is probably the better choice.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, turning his eyes back to Bucky, who was flinching again, his hands moving in his husbands grasps. “I think he’s waking up…”
Steve was starting to notice the phrase ‘I don’t know’ had came up a few times with Bucky. He wasn’t sure if it was because Bucky felt awkward around him, though he was pretty sure the kid had enough secrets in him to make anyone uncomfortable. He wouldn’t be living in the basement of Stark Industries in a glass cell with a metal arm if he didn’t have anything to hide.
“As we should,” Stane was having a hard time keeping calm through this conversation; he was going to have to change topics quick. “Tony, we can worry about that after the funeral, but…there’s something I have to discuss with you regarding it.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupted sternly.
“I don’t know if they can do that,” Natasha interjected, pointing at her friend. “And you look fine, Bucky, you’re not a bad looking guy.”
“Please, all of you, if your name isn’t called, stay calm and quiet,” Tony said, projecting his voice as he’d been coached many times in the past. “If everything goes smoothly, the wizard will come back out and do more magic.”
“Is this your drinking room?” Bucky asked, mentally kicking himself the second he said it. He was supposed to be dark and mysterious, not a nosy asshole.
