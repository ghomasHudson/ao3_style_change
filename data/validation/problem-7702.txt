“The team.”  Steve opened his mouth to reply, but Tony cut him off. “Yes, the team. They are unbearable, Steve. Insufferable. Ever since last night.”  He returned to his work, double checking the knots before tying one end around the leg of the ancient wardrobe. God, he hoped it would be heavy enough. Gathering the bundle of tied-together sheets, he dragged them across the room and threw open the window.
He sets a bookmark in place to mark his page and listens to the conversation as the men speaking come closer to the lounge that he’s curled up in. Normally he wouldn’t care about agents bickering, but this is something else. It’s Coulson’s calm voice saying, “Really, you’re not authorized to see him. You can’t be here right now.”
"What? No! Of course we're not," Steve sputters.
+++++
So he’d followed Tony back to New York. Sam had come along, ostensibly to stay in touch working on the Bucky search, but Steve was pretty sure Sam had been feeling just as adrift as himself. He wasn’t surprised to find Bruce already there, nor was he surprised when Natasha reappeared a few weeks later, Clint in tow.
"I'm okay," Steve says with a shaky, deep breath. Another breath and then, firmer: "I'm okay."
With that knowledge, Tony is sleeping better at night. He's more productive at the office. When he's at home with Casey, he can put all his energy into enjoying that time, instead of wondering whether Casey will be okay through the summer, or whether he's in danger, or if the company will fold and they'll end up out on the street living in a van.
"Don't play dumb, Widow," the woman says snidely. The strange nickname makes the record skip again. "You and I both know why you're all here. Trying to
"Slow down, you animal," Bucky says, though there isn't any heat in his words.
He shoves away the guilt. Yeah, Steve is his friend, and he feels a little weird about just having jerked off to thoughts of fucking his friend who is just on the other side of the door, but it's better than the alternative. He was quiet enough, Steve won't have heard him.
Steve opens his mouth reflexively to argue, but closes it a second later. Because the thing is, he believes Tony. He might not know Tony well, but he’s seen the way that Tony acts around other people. He’s seen the way Tony acts at SHIELD, and how he acts in interviews, and it’s not like this. That Tony is guarded, calculated, and a bit of an asshole. But this Tony, the one who teaches him how to block a punch, who sends him photos of Iron Man dolls in the middle of the night, who takes him for pancakes, that’s not a Tony’s who’s just being nice because he feels bad for someone else. That’s a Tony who’s letting a realer, softer side show. And the other thing is, Steve gets it. He gets having the difference between public and personal image. He understands having to create a face and play the game. Sometimes it’s just to get shit done, and other times it’s necessary to just survive.
"Steve, I'm right here," a voice says. He feels hands grab his shoulders, arms wrap around him and hold him. "It's Tony. Stay with me."
He blocks out the voices yelling behind him, closes his eyes, and unleashes the full power of the gauntlet on the Mad Titan.
“Oh come on, this is not the worst situation you have found me in,” Tony whines over at Rhodey.
"Man, Bucky wasn't kidding about your obscenely obvious crush, was he?"
He reads Casey a couple of books before bed – he always tells the kid he'll read him just the one, but Casey normally manages to wheedle two more out of him before lights out. Tony doesn't mind – he loves this part of the day, when it's just the two of them. Casey is curled into Tony's side in his little race car bed, blinking sleepily as Tony reads to him. Casey is out halfway through the fourth book.
The server comes by a minute later for their order, and then swings by again with a basket of bread. They’ve been here often enough that no one ever makes a big deal about them, which is one of the many reasons Tony loves this place. As they chat, the tension they’ve both been carrying in the past days bleeds out of their shoulders, and by the time the server returns with their food, Tony feels as though there couldn’t be anything wrong with the world.
"Great, actually, now that I've actually found someone to help watch Casey. Meet Natasha," he gestures to the redhead, and she breaks off her conversation with Clint in order to offer her hand to Steve.
"I'd like to speak to him about his development in the upper east side."
"That's really good," Tony says with some relief. "I hope he has a good time."
"Oh, yes, I'm a huge fan," she says, gaze intense on his. "Honestly, I've always thought you and I would get along very well."
"The risk was calculated, but man, are we bad at math," Steve adds, causing Clint to grin over the use of his favourite phrase.
For all that Tony is outgoing and expressive, there are times that he is very good at schooling his expression into unfluctuating neutrality. Probably an essential skill in the business world. This, however – unfortunately for Tony – is not one of those times. For a fraction of a second, his face twists up into an expression that tells Bucky he's hit the nail square on the head, and then his face closes off entirely.
"Pretty proud, yeah," Steve says with a laugh, wrapping his arms around Tony's back.
"No, man, you wanna make fun of my beverage order, I'm gonna spill all your business out in the open, see if I don't."
Peter gives him a blinding, hopeful smile, then settles back in his chair. To Steve's surprise, he actually does stay quiet – long enough for Steve to fall back asleep.
"Might as well give it right to Thanos, then," he'd spat.
"I was going to in the morning," Tony protests. "I didn't want to worry you since there was nothing you could do until morning anyway. Roads are all closed and there's a blizzard here."
Oh, man. Tony feels like a real idiot, now. Of course, Justine Hammer. Daughter of Justin Hammer. He hadn't known her back in Haven, but now he recognizes the name.
"Casey the goober wanted to say good night to you," Tony says, holding up the phone so Steve can see Casey and Natasha on the screen.
When they had agreed to be moved to the pocket reality, Strange had taken them to Wakanda to do the spell. He'd said they would be best protected under T'Challa's watchful eye, with his underground facilities, adamantium bunkers, and high-tech medical facilities.
"Yeah, sugarbear, but you're also a dick and also I don't have a
In the end, the Guardians agreed to go after the Soul stone. Gamora and Quill shared another look as they were agreeing to it, and Tony suspected there was something they weren't sharing. Of course, the white-faced anger mixed with terror on Quill's face had Tony thinking maybe it was best he didn't know what it was.
Casey's safety is the only thing that matters, and Tony can't keep his son safe from the countless dangers of the world if Casey is going to be surrounded by the crowds resulting from a
that asshole?
“Apparently it’s more fun when they have the whole tower to run around in,” Sam says.
"Okay," Casey responds reluctantly. "Love you, Daddy."
"Mr. Stark," the doorman says into the phone. "Reggie, here, from the desk. Got a couple gentlemen here sayin' you might be expecting them." He pauses. "Sure thing, Sir."
come on, Rogers. I can not
the stone, like that will help. No, you can't
"Barnes and I were questioning her," Natasha says, watching as Clint stands up from his bed and moves over to Bucky's side, helping him to his feet as well. There's no hesitation, no awkwardness between them.
It knocks the air out of his lungs, and his arm loosens enough for Casey to slide free, and Casey runs to Steve, fast as he can. The guy is trying not to slide to the ground, and Steve pushes Casey behind him, where he can be protected, pushes him out the door.
“You don’t know that,” Steve snaps suddenly. Tony startles, and draws back for half a moment. But he’s never backed down from Steve before and he isn’t going to start now.
"Sure thing, Mr. Rhodes. Mr. Stark having a party or something?"
Bucky pins him down under the hard stare that he developed over the years of dealing with a stubborn Steve Rogers, and perfected during his time in combat. Tony shifts uncomfortably.
, and –
Tony winces. "Yeah, I did. Oops."

"But it's
After all the months of dancing around each other, the months of snark, and avoiding each other, and then of spending every waking hour possible around each other, there had been a date. And Tony, who’d assumed that his day of getting excited about first dates was a thing of the ancient past, found himself feeling like a teenager all over again.
"You want me to make love to you?"
“Steve had to deal with three hours of you texting him from a meeting complaining about how hungry you were. After he told you to grab something before you went down,” Sam points out, sliding into the kitchen himself, his voice full of amusement.
because if she says it, that will make it real, that will make all of it true, and that will destroy the illusion, that will spit them back out into the real world, and they'll have failed – they're the only thing keeping the mind stone away from Thanos and if Hammer says it aloud it will shatter everything and Thanos will be able to find them –
"Oh my god," Steve says, "They're-"
," Steve said. "We have to face this
By the beginning of the following week, Steve has four new staff members between the two shops, which gives him, Clint, and Bucky a little more flexibility to move between both of the shops
Steve makes a low moan in the back of his throat, and Tony can't resist it, he'd thought he'd
"That didn't stop him last week. What happened on that trip, Steve?"
"You can come with us, if you like," Tony says. "I know you – I know you care about him. If you're not ready to – to separate, or whatever, yet. I can make up the guest room."
They fall into bed and sleep almost immediately.
"Ah. You mean about Tony," Bucky says.
After some squabbling, Tony ends up paying the bill, but Steve manages to convince Tony to let him pay the tip. Together, they head outside and Tony offers to walk back to Steve’s apartment with him. Steve puts up a token protest, because it’s a 20 minute walk in the wrong direction, but Tony waves him off, saying he could use the walk, and he’ll just flag a cab to get home after. Steve doesn’t argue, because truthfully, he wants the company for as long as he can get it. He wants to cling to this connection and try to convince himself it’s real. That it’s something that he can hold on to.
She nods, her desperation morphing into determination.
He holds Bucky's eye for a moment, both of them silently counting in their heads, and then it's a burst of movement as Steve twists out from around the corner, back on the street, and Bucky is right there behind him, gun aimed up high. There's a muzzle flash from a window somewhere, and that was a mistake because now Bucky can zero in on the bastard.
Tony would have people around him who would be more than just friends. Tony had mentioned being a single dad but that didn't mean he was
"He's, um, he hasn't woken up yet, but they're optimistic," Steve says, shifting uncomfortably. "Would you like to – here, sit down, please." He pulls out the chair –
As it is, things are already dicey. The Dora Milaje are picking off the few creatures that do manage to force their way inside the field, but the creatures, or their Masters, are very quickly figuring out how to use those numbers to their advantage. They swarm around more of the perimeter of the dome, and it's only a matter of time before the whole thing comes crashing down. Shuri must realise it at the same time, because he hears her voice over the comms, telling T'Challa that the'll need to come up with a plan.
"Outreach programs, huh? Is that what this is about?" Tony asks, nodding to the half-full jar of buttons on the counter.
"Loki's dead. Thor didn't take it well," Bruce confirms.
"Wouldn't mind bein' stuck with you for a good, long while," Steve says, and Tony gives himself a moment to acknowledge the little thrill of pleasure before he retorts.
“Holy-”
When he’d been sitting in the ruins of that blown out bar, stone cold sober and two thirds of the way through a bottle of whisky the night that Bucky had died, he didn’t think it was possible to feel any worse. Certainly not and still live. How could a human possibly bear any more grief and not be crushed under the weight of it?
"I thought you were dead," Tony admits weakly, not quite able to meet Steve's eyes. "When we couldn't reach you on the comms. I thought you were dead, that I'd lost Casey
"Tell us again," Natasha says, sometime later after she, Clint and Sam have arrived. "From the beginning."
"You're not going anywhere without me," Barnes growled, stepping forward.
He wishes he hadn’t woken up.
"Then it's okay!" Casey nods firmly.
The 'hanging around here
"I know that," Steve protests. "I do, honest. I just… I can't leave."
Steve nods.
"How long have we been together, Tony?"
"Clint, we have an emergency," Steve says.
He watches Casey play with his friends for another moment before he heads off in the direction of the office. Another strategic placement, Stark Resilient's corporate offices are only a few more blocks down the street, and most days Tony walks back and forth from the preschool. So far, he's managed to only walk down the street a few times during lunch to make sure everything is okay at the school, though he'd never admit it to anyone.
“He’s at a liaison meeting with the European Union,” Sam reminds him. Tony waves his hand dismissively.
"But he's still my best friend," she tells him. "Thank you for watching over him."
“Well, this is you,” Tony says, coming to a stop. “This was fun, we should do it again some time.” He gives Steve a jaunty wave goodbye and turns to leave.
It rushes over Natasha like a torrent of water, and then there's nothing but silent, inky black for long moments.
Eventually, Rhodey pulls back, and Tony swipes his hand across his face, wiping away a few tears that had leaked out.
Steve chuckles, and it sounds warm and intoxicating. "We don't have to do it all in one night, Tony." His expression falters a little, and suddenly he looks young and unsure. "I mean, I'm clean, after my last test, and I haven't been with anyone since, well – for a while."
Eventually, he climbs out of the stall, wraps himself in a towel and stares at himself in the mirror for a long time. He can't quite meet his own eyes.
. The time that he'd spent with Steve in the pocket world, in Haven, was the first time he'd truly felt safe in longer than he'd care to remember.
compared to the way Tony looks now, warm and bright and obviously completely in love with his son.
"Got nowhere else to be," he lies.
"You're fine, you whiner," Steve says, nipping at Tony's chin.
Bucky sits himself down next to Steve, still pressed closed to him. "Hearing that you're okay after being in a fucking
"I like how you think. Lodge a formal complaint with management."
"Yeah, okay," Tony agrees. "It was kind of brilliant."
"Okay, but what about –"
As he slowly begins to settle into his new place in the following days, the tension that had been building while he’d been trapped up in SHIELD begins to pass. He’s still in there almost every day, but having somewhere else to be and go back to helps. Not having to pass through security checkpoints every time he comes and goes outside helps. At least some days. The rest of the time, he’s up late, wandering aimlessly, and very pointedly not thinking about his empty, barren apartment.
From there, it's just a matter of time before they wear the slime king down, and Steve and Tony move to talk to the first responders and the police that have shown up at some point, while the others do one last sweep to make sure that they’ve caught all the stragglers. It’s definitely not the evening Tony had planned, but also definitely not the worst date he's been on, so maybe he can count that as a win.
A cold sweat breaks out across his forehead, even as he fires a missile at the pod. Of course, it does nothing, bouncing right off the pod's shields, but it was worth a shot.
"He's okay, buddy," Steve murmurs into Casey's hair. "He's just fine, Case, he's not hurt."
"Hey, Tony," Steve greets, already pouring Tony's coffee.
Tony melts into it, purring with pleasure, even whining a little when Steve pulls back.
Wait, what? His perception slips sideways and his brain struggles to catch up. Obviously people had talked about him, history books had been written about him. Rationally, he knew that. But it never once occurred to him that Howard might talk about him to his
"I can go really fast, Daddy!" Casey says, squirming until Tony has to put him down, laughing, and then running at full speed down the hallway toward the bathroom.
“Alright Capsicle, I’ll prove it. Come here.”  Tony takes Steve across the lab to the small scale portable CT scanner he borrowed after calling in a favour. He convinces Steve to let him take another scan of his head, and although it takes some time, he eventually gets the results up on his display.
With that, the phone call ends, and Tony lets out a shaky breath. "He's okay," Tony tells himself.
“Pretty sure being a genius doesn’t automatically make you great at people,” Steve points out. Tony stares at him, mockingly aghast.
"It's not fair, I know. But you're gonna have to be the one that props him up for a bit. He's gonna fight you – tooth and nail – but as much as you loved that little boy, for Tony that kid was
that because it's not on the table. Instead, the first thing that comes out of his mouth is, "Of course I think of you as a friend!" Which is entirely a lie because Tony most definitely thinks of Steve as more than a friend. However, all he can
It was into one of those bunkers that Dr. Strange had taken them, worked his magic to send them to the pocket universe. He'd said he was leaving a sample of each of their auras in each of the beds down here, to work as a sort of lodestone when they did come back to reality. He'd said it would be easier on them if their bodies had a place to be drawn to.
your fault. It's
time a stranger has hit on me, Steve."
It hurts, and then it stops. And as everything goes dark, as he drops to the ground one last time, he hears a voice calling his name, laced with horror and grief.
Rhodey just keeps laughing, all the way down the hall.
"Tony," both Tony and Steve correct at the same time.
"What the hell?" Tony shouts as the same time as Bucky.
. He's not a baby. You're such a neurotic weirdo. Helicopter parents look at you and get sad."
Rhodey drives to Brooklyn first. Sam and Clint get out of the car, and Steve moves as though he's going to follow, but he's reluctant about breaking physical contact with Casey.
They're back. They're back from the place Strange had sent them.
Tony had done it. He'd beat Thanos, destroyed him and all his army. But it had been a long, brutal battle up until that point. There are many dead, and many more injured. The most seriously injured had been spirited away to the Palace's hospital. Tony is there, but most of the other Avengers had made it out relatively unscathed.
“Let him in J,” Tony instructs. Steve takes a careful, calculated step in. Tony isn’t quite sure what to expect.
"You're insane," Tony tells him.
Tony grins and looks back up at Steve. "And a peanut butter monster cookie for the squirt."
It had been a difficult pregnancy. Severe morning sickness, wildly low blood pressure, the whole nine yards. In the end, she began hemorrhaging when she went into labour, and the doctors had to perform a C-section to save the baby.
A scream. High-pitched and terrified, and it's definitely Casey.
Tony doesn't notice Steve picking up the lube bottle or opening it, but he
For a moment, the two of them circle around each other, sizing each other up. Steve plans on waiting for Stark to make the first move. They’re both wearing light padded sparring gloves, and Steve knows how to pull his punches, but he’s still very aware of the fact that he’s bigger, stronger, faster, and drastically outclasses Stark. Or so he thinks, until Stark darts forward in a flash and lands a sharp blow under Steve’s ribs.
"We'll find him," Steve says, with more conviction than he should. He knows the chances of finding Casey aren't great. He knows this is all a shot in the dark.
Rhodey and Tony.
By the time Tony gets out to Brooklyn, he's in a truly shit mood. It probably would have been smart to delay what's about to come next, but he's running out of time. The core of the renovations have wrapped up and they're working on details, paint and interior now. He's got to get the shop moved before they start loading stuff into the new space, or he's not going to have a chance of succeeding.
Steve huffs in annoyance and disbelief.
Steve waves him off. “It’s fine. Honestly. I’d rather that than the alternative.”

"Well, um. Actually, I was in the army. Clint, Bucky and I were all there together."
warm and safe, but they have the benefit of being achingly familiar and comfortable, without any of the pesky one-sided sexual tension.

He can't help the strangled sound that comes out of his throat as Tony crawls into the bed and pulls the blankets up to his waist, effectively hiding the underwear that is causing so many problems with Steve's body.
," he says, breathless.
"Uh huh, sure," Rhodey says. Tony wishes his BFF – and really, why is Rhodey his BFF with all this flack he's giving Tony? – could see the way that he's rolling his eyes. Too bad they aren't on a video call.
"Uh huh. Sure you are." The man said, clearly not buying it. "You boys look like you got yourselves in a right mess. What happened?"
+++++
"We're here to see Tony Stark," Bucky says confidently, navigating the world of the very rich better than Steve would have expected. He's not sure he would have been able to do as well.
"What?" Tony asks defensively. "Why are you giving me a look?"
"Same," Steve laughs, the corners of his eyes crinkling. "I missed you this last week, Tony," he says. “I missed being home.”
"That's
Apparently, Tony had meant what he'd said about seeing them later, because after that, he starts coming in to grab his coffee every single morning after dropping Casey off at school. It's honestly the highlight of Steve's entire day. Eventually, Tony stops trying to pay for the coffee since Steve and the staff always refuse his money, but periodically he shoves money inside the suspended coffee and meals jar. It's a compromise that Steve is willing to accept. He's not going to turn down money for that program.
She smiles up at him, reaching forward to place one pale, delicate hand over Tony's wrist.
"Guys? We've got incoming. Again!" Rhodey calls over the comms. Sure enough, there is a pod hurtling towards the earth, and there is no doubt in Tony's mind who's inside. Their destruction. Their end.
"So did I," Steve replies. "Honestly, I wasn't sure that expanding was a good idea. I mean, we're doing well in Brooklyn, but we started out as just three guys with a pile of baggage and no idea what to do, or how to live like normal civilians again. Having a lot of empty time on our hands… it wasn't good for any of us. But I found this neighbourhood, and it felt right. Pretty sure I looked at every available building zoned for commercial space in the area before I settled on this one."
The sound of it breaks Tony's heart all over again. He wonders how much pain he's expected to sit through before Thanos comes and puts him out of his misery, already.
"Yeah, I mean, I had time. On the way,' Tony says, shifting a little awkwardly.
A few feet away, Tony picks up a bar stool by the legs and swings it at one of the HYDRA goons with everything he’s got. It connects hard with the man's knee, and he crumples to the ground, cursing. Tony lets out a satisfied whoop that Steve can’t help but find it adorable enough to temporarily chase away all of the complicated feelings that he has regarding Tony.  Now isn’t the time to deal with them anyway.
"Hey, take it easy there, buddy, you've been put through the ringer," Tony says, resting a hand on Vision's shoulder.
Tony shrugged. "Of course it is. That's what we do, though, isn't it, Rogers?"
again. For this all of have been a dream. He wants to wake up where Peggy smiles at him across the dance floor, where Bucky is alive, where he doesn’t have this giant fucking hole in his soul, gaping and festering as the days drag by. He doesn’t want to wander through empty days feeling like a shell of his former self, living in a life that isn’t his, that
“Steve is a jerk,” Tony mutters, glaring mutinously at the drawing but fighting to keep the corner of his mouth from twitching up.
"I'm glad you got the Stark issue dealt with. That guy seriously could have put a damper on things if he wanted to," Sam says.
He doesn't get a chance to finish his thought. Frantic footsteps pound through the hall, and someone – Gamora, he realises – flies into their line of sight, wide eyed and fearful. "They're here."
"Rain check?" Steve asks apologetically. "I know you want to get home to Casey tonight."
Then he smiles. It's still tinged with sadness, but it's real. His teeth gleam in the low light of the hospital room, and his eyes are bright and hopeful.
in him – out of his mind and goes back to watching Tony walk across the room.
It's nine in the evening by now. They've spent the last few hours planning. Bucky and Clint headed home to collect their service weapons, as well as Steve's. Natasha shakes her head that no, she doesn't need one. Sam takes the offer of an extra from Bucky's (rather impressive) gun locker, as does Rhodey.
Tony grins, and raises his eyebrow. "Like many great discoveries – completely by accident."
Steve's body is obscenely close to Tony's, and he's warm and solid and he'd
His reprieve was short lived. He turned a corner and there, at the end of the hall, stood Natasha. She, of course, spotted him immediately, and quirked an eyebrow at him. The tiniest, most innocuous gesture, but Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit that he squeaked before diving through the nearest door, slamming it shut and throwing himself against it. As if that would keep her out, if she were determined to find him.
"What about the Time stone?" Natasha asked, jerking her chin at Strange's chest. Tony was still a little weirded out about her blonde hair. It looked good on her, because Tony didn't think Natasha
They both chuckle, and then silence follows for a beat or two after. It's a little awkward, and they both look away. They're saved by Tony's phone chiming an alert.

To be clear, it isn't the presence of the shop that upset him — far from it. The neighbourhood has an alarming deficit of establishments to get caffeine. It's the
"It's still May," Bruce says, and Tony blinks at him. Bruce gives him an apologetic glance even as he hands out bottles of water for each of them. "You've been gone a couple of weeks."
"Tony," Shuri chastises him gently, "maybe save it for another time?"
Unfortunately, it also means he has more time to think about Steve Rogers.
to run into each other, well, wouldn’t that just be a coincidence? “She did, however, mention that you were thinking of moving out of the tower.”
"Fine," Steve grits out through his teeth.
"Yeah, well, not everyone has your crazy psychic superpowers." Clint waves her off and then pauses. "Wait, is that why you told him that you and I were only going to be friends? 'Cause that seemed like a weird thing to say, but hey, who am I to judge?"

"Okay, Tony," Steve says calmly. "I need you to take a deep breath, and tell me exactly what happened."
Natasha’s voice echoes in his head.
The streets are quiet. It's nearing midnight, but it's still New York, so it's eerie. Steve isn't used to any deserted streets in New York.
Steve doesn't wait for him. He heads further up the street, sticking to the shadows as well as he can.
“Oh my god, I wasn’t seriously considering it,” Steve huffs in annoyance.
They give him free rein in the tower to go where he wants, he’s not a prisoner after all, and JARVIS can monitor him. But in the first 24 hours he does little more than eat, and train. Tony orchestrates an ‘accidental’ run in with him in the kitchen, but Steve just looks at him passively, thanks him for the hospitality, and politely excuses himself.
"It felt so real," he whispers, voice hoarse. "All of it. Casey, our life, Steve. Oh god, Steve." He shudders as the warring memories of falling asleep in his apartment curled up with Steve, and waking up in the hospital bed in Wakanda. "Rhodey, we were..."
The water is hot, the pressure is perfect, and Steve stays under the spray for a long time.
"Tony Stark," Sam says, grinning. "Good to meet you, man. Steve's talked a lot about you."
Which was ridiculous, and Tony was probably indulging in some wishful thinking.
He’s pretty sure Pinky knows who he is, even though there’s been no announcement that Steve is in fact alive, but the guy also doesn’t seem to care. He just lets Steve do his thing and occasionally tells stories about what New York was like when he was younger and how the neighbourhood has changed. He never asks Steve anything personal, and never pushes when Steve volunteers information of his own. This place is a sanctuary, where he feels sane, and where he can fight the demons inside himself that keep him awake at night.
"Are you okay, Daddy?" He asks. Tony's heart twists. His kid shouldn't be worrying about
"Okay, now that's just manipulative. But, also it sounds somewhat acceptable," Tony admits, against his better judgement. "And… I do feel a
Tony is practically hysterical on the other end of line. Steve is immediately on high alert.
"Oh, don't you even start," Steve huffs and grabs a towel, flicking it at Clint with a snap of his wrist. Clint yelps, and jumps back out of reach, cursing under his breath as the door swings open again.
“Bucky’s the one who brought it up,” Steve said, and Clint turns his glare on Barnes.
“I get the impression you probably just say whatever is on your mind regardless of what permission you have,” Steve chuckles, a little warmer this time.
Suddenly, Steve can't even feel his knee anymore, he's too busy feeling his heart in his throat, feeling the rush of adrenaline that he needs to burst forward, running down the hall and into that room.
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose, and tries not to snap. "So, you mean to say, that he could literally be anywhere in the world?"
"We need to make sure the other two stones are protected as well," said Wong.
to get his mind out of the gutter.
Nine o' clock comes and goes again, with no sign of Stark. The morning crowd dies down, and Steve rips off his apron, and slumps into the back without so much as a word.
And Thanos is coming for them.
"Steve okay?" Rhodey asks, once his giggling subsides.
Steve chuckles. "I was just thinkin' that."
"Huh," Steve said, sitting back and looking impressed. "God, you’re sexy when you're brilliant, you know that?"
"If it's not as good as the stuff you make in Brooklyn, you and I are going to have serious problems."
Steve stands to follow, still limping a little as they walk toward Tony's room. Tony can't help but look down at Steve's leg, the same one he'd hurt in the car accident, but Steve just squeezes his hand and gives a reassuring shake of his head. "It'll be fine, Tony. Nothing a couple days and some Tylenol won't cure."
"Yeah, what is that, eight elections in a row?"
"Hey, Steve. Everything okay? You look a little..." Tony trails off, and Steve gives him a little half-smile.
Tony really is a good, safe driver. He takes all the right precautions, slows down for conditions, the whole nine yards. So it's just shitty luck that Tony hits a patch of black ice the wrong way and the car spins out of control.
His erection curves slightly back toward his body, and it's thick, resting proudly against Steve's belly.
"Likewise. This is Bucky, and that's Clint."
It's not exaggerating to say it had been, hands down, the best hug of his life. Steve's arms had been strong and warm and so tight wrapped around him. He'd felt truly enveloped, cocooned, and
“Do we need to talk about this now?”
"Steve. Oh my god, thank god. I need your help."
we doing?" Tony asked, not even bothering to try to keep the frustration out of his voice.
“Must be disorienting,” Tony says, not knowing how else to respond.
"He destroyed Xandar," Gamora said, her voice hard but tremulous with emotion. With pain and anger. "So he took the Power stone from the Nova Corps vault. He'd gone to Knowhere and taken the Reality stone already."
His grip slips and the wrench he's holding so ineffectually falls from his hand, almost landing on his face, and he bites out a curse. He manages to dodge the wrench, but in doing so he also smacks the top of his head against the back of the oven, and he lets his whole body go limp because he just, for a minute, wants to give up entirely.
"Don't worry about it," Bucky says, handing Steve's phone back to him even as he flicks through the contacts on his own phone and brings it up to his ear. "Nat'll text us."
“Sam and I will be on stand by a few blocks out, we’ll follow you there. Call if you need anything.” She squeezes his shoulder gently on the way out, and Steve doesn’t move until he’s heard the door to his apartment click quietly shut behind her.
Stupid team.
"No, I won't, it's fine!" Steve shouts from the bathroom.
"Don't try to fool me, Rogers, I know your secret now. You're just a great big sap."
But, at least after the success at his breakfast meeting, he’s got more than enough work to keep him busy — work that he’s actually excited to be throwing himself into. This energy partnership is going to be fantastic, and the German rep had had some really solid ideas that had sparked all kinds of new plans in Tony’s head about improving the prototype for the next iteration.
"That's true," Tony nods, pretending to think it over. "Did you tidy up your room this morning with Miss Natasha?"
Tony almost wants to laugh at the earnestness of the term, but he can't quite bring himself to do it. It's so quintessentially Steve, to say something as old fashioned and wholesome as 'make love', but he somehow manages to make it sound right. Instead, he nods and tips his lips up for another kiss.
"Trying to stop it from spreading," she says miserably.
Tony’s breath catches in his throat, and he holds the cup a little tighter in his hands. He’s grateful that he has something else to look at down below, because he’s not sure he can meet Steve’s gaze.
He'd rather not, really. The underwear, sure, whatever. He wears it because he finds it comfortable, and it makes him feel a little bit sexy even when nothing's going to come of it. But the wet, dirty, cold pants?

the stone in his head, at all costs."
But that optimism is short lived. They've taken down wave after wave of the creatures, but it hardly looks like they've made a dent. More and more keep swarming in, forcing them to respond at a punishing pace that they aren't going to be able to keep up with for long. The Masters, or whatever those things in charge are, stride across the field as if they're taking a Sunday afternoon stroll in the park, all of them heading straight to where Vision is fighting alongside Wanda. It's as if they're drawn to the stone, which they probably are, considering the ease with which they pinpointed the stone's location in the first place. But Tony isn't going to let them have it.
Tony's cheeks flush a little, but he just throws a grin right back at Steve. "Good, I can get behind that. Don't want my son hanging around any place that does any differently."
Tony turns away and follows Shuri. He doesn't look back.
"That's our kidnapper," Steve says. "Keep on her, Barton."
Tony waves him off and drops into a crouch in front of the oven. It makes his already tight, tailored trousers stretch around his ass and frame it beautifully. Not that Steve is staring. Just, if he
“Funny, that’s what I was doing. Natasha never mentioned
Steve crosses his arms over his chest (which makes his biceps bulge somehow even more ridiculously) and blinks at Tony.
"Steve?"
“Crashing a plane. Getting kidnapped. Just totally normal things right?” Steve says flatly.
"I don't get a gun?" Tony croaks, looking almost too tired to stand.
“They’ll come back,” Tony tells him.
"Sure, and that's
"That's part of the spell. You'll have a reason to protect Vision. You'll be willing to protect him with your lives, all of you. But knowledge of this reality is too dangerous. If you're there and you know it isn't real, it will weaken the spell. It could lead Thanos right to you – or it could break the spell altogether and bring you back here. It's not enough for you to believe you belong there, in that pocket reality. You have to
"Sure," Tony answers distractedly before he blinks, the words filtering through to his brain. He looks back at Rhodey, meeting his eyes.
To see this chapter’s illustration by acachette,
Tony is so, so proud of himself when his answer
Steve's finger twists, pulling out a little and pushing back in. He pulls all the way out to add more lube, and then he's back with two fingers, pressing in and out to stretch Tony open.
“Options. Right. Because everyone really cares about what I think right now.”
Steve laughs. "You thought
“No, I don’t know for sure, but I can make an educated guess. And I’m a genius, so you know, my educated guesses are pretty damn good.”
"Tony! Hey!" Steve greets him, wiping off his hands and leaning across the counter. "Usual for you?"
“I don’t know,” Steve says automatically, without thinking. He doesn’t have an answer to that. His therapist would probably be thrilled if he did. But. He’s still too busy being lost. The thought makes his chest seize up, the edges of that wound still so raw they might as well still be bleeding.
"I'll bring 'em out to you at a table if you want," Steve says. Tony smiles again and picks up their drinks, leading Casey over to a table by the window so they can people-watch pedestrians. Casey kneels on his chair, practically leaning over the table to sip at his lemonade, chattering excitedly.
If it had been anyone else, Tony would have been crushed at being stood up, though he would have denied it, brushed it off and gone about his evening. But sitting there, alone at the table with a bottle of wine ready, and an empty chair across from him, Tony wasn’t crushed. He was terrified.  Because Steve Rogers would never stand someone up.
Thinking about that hurts, and so he tries not to. Which, of course, means that it’s all he can think about. He retreats into his apartment, and doesn’t have the energy to fight the surging thoughts.
"You fuck it up, you fix it," she says.
Bucky and Natasha exchange another look.
"No, you won't," Strange said. "You have to go, but you can't go alone. You need someone there with you, just in case Thanos gets through."
"Well," Steve said thoughtfully. "Would it help to know that the three guys running this place are all former combat veterans?"
"I wanted to do this the easy way," she says. "But you had to be difficult. Dad always said you were nothing but a pain in his ass."
Clint strides into the office. Enough is enough. They need to deal with this shit because seriously, he can't take it anymore. Bucky is sitting at the desk, tallying up something or other and inputting numbers into the complicated-looking spreadsheets that are up on the laptop screen. Clint walks up to the desk, slaps his hands down on the surface, and stares at Bucky directly in the eye.
"We will be, but you are staying right here," Tony demands. "You're what he's after, and we still have no idea what kind of effect snapping back to reality might have had on you. You're safer here. Stay put."
"I can see that," Tony says, trying to soak up as much information as he can.
"I'm not –"
Suddenly, there are shots fired from somewhere above. The rat-tat-tat of a semi-automatic breaks the quiet of the night, and the brick siding of the building to Steve's left explodes in little pops.
"This is one hell of an entourage," Tony says as he flies over the battlefield. Thanos himself hasn't arrived – Tony isn't quite sure if he's more, or less relieved over that – but the initial invasion party is… not insignificant. There are a handful of formidable beings; tall, strong, well armed, ordering a literal army of vicious, wild creatures who are throwing themselves at the force field over and over again until one or two manage to make it past just by sheer stubbornness, overwhelming the energy field. They're savage things, fast moving, all teeth and claws hell bent on tearing the Wakandan forces to shreds, and they have the advantage of sheer numbers. But the Wakandan warriors are the best that Tony has ever had the honour to fight beside, which is good. Otherwise they wouldn't stand a chance.
Fortunately, Shuri's lab is more than well equipped to handle the task they have ahead of them. Even with their backs up against the wall and no time to spare, Tony still can't help staring at the space in wonder, itching to get his hands on things and throw about a thousand questions Shuri's way. She laughs, and punches his shoulder lightly as she passes by him on her way over to her work station. "I never get tired of those awestruck looks. They give me life. You should have seen Bruce's face the first time he came in here."
Steve watches from across the lobby, watches the way that Tony's face shifts from anxious, to apologetic, to a laugh – presumably at something Casey says to him. It's beautiful to watch. "Kid at home?" Fred asks.
So maybe, just maybe, Tony has reason to believe that Steve might have some of those same positive feelings for Tony?
"Because I know what we're up against, and I know what could happen if we lose."
The Dora Milaje swarm Thanos from behind, grabbing his arms and trying to pin them back so they can pry the gauntlet from his fist. For a moment, Tony thinks that they might actually have him, but he breaks their hold with a grunt a beat later.
"That leaves the Soul stone unaccounted for," he said, tone commanding. "All we know is that it isn't on Earth."
"The... honeymoon suite," Tony says, his voice tightening.
Tony nods. "I did a
"Let's start with something simpler," Natasha says, forcing her body to calm. The jitter in her extremities stops immediately, and she slows her breathing. "Tell us your name."
"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Rhodey says, answering grin on his face.

Bucky nods thoughtfully. "I've known Steve a long time. Like, a long,

"He's been busy," Steve says. "He's got a major project on the go with the DoD, they have deadlines coming up. He doesn't have time to be hanging around here."
"Fine," Pepper agreed. "I'll have my assistant make the arrangements and forward you the meeting time. Do not make me regret this."

"If he goes, I go," Natasha said, looking between Tony and Steve pointedly before shooting a slightly apologetic look back at Bruce. Bruce just gave her a sad smile and a nod.
Steve stares at him, and Tony stares back, for several long beats. Then Tony is pressing forward, lips sealing over Steve's, and this time the kiss is hot and rough, lips slick and tongues sliding together.
“You’ll still be expected to keep in touch and report to SHIELD,” Coulson informs him as Steve wanders around, examining the space. “You’re still a matter of national security.” He sounds apologetic, but Steve can’t really be that upset. On the whole, Coulson has been good, better than he’d expected, really. Steve respects the man, and honestly, he’s grateful for everything that Coulson has done.
corrects him. Tony. He could get used to that.
Tony looks up at him, and his lip trembles, his eyes well, and Steve can't stop himself – he's jerking forward and pulling Tony into his arms, holding him as tightly as he can.
"Tony got a phone call," Bucky says grimly between breaths. "They said not to call the police, and that they had Casey."
That physical contact is enough to snap Steve back to reality. Time catches up to him.

“Hate you,” Clint mutters. “I do
Tony gives him a quizzical look. "I mean, it's not the
"You just spent the equivalent of eight months in a dimension I created from scratch, Stark. You're not honestly going to get your socks in a knot about a little portal."
He sighs, and pulls out his phone, snapping a photo of the drawing to add to the library of ‘Steve’s whiteboard doodles’ that he keeps. His shoulders slump a little, and Sam’s voice cuts into this thoughts, a little gentler. “He’ll be back soon.”
"Got it," Tony says grimly, and then he blows out a puff of air. "Getting out of the car now."
The squad commander makes his way over, and Rhodey somehow manages to school his expression back into something resembling professionalism. “Everything checks out, building is secure, I’m officially releasing them to your custody, Lieutenant Colonel. But we’ll need them to file a statement.”
He closes up the files, and by the time he's got them ready, there is a response from the nanny applicant sitting in his inbox. The promptness of her reply is another point in her favour. God, he really hopes she is a good fit. He can't bear the idea of having to start the search all over again. He was lucky enough that the school was willing to take Casey on for the last couple of months of this year after the move, even though technically Casey isn't old enough yet. But the school just simply isn't an option for the summer.
"That, he is," Steve agrees. "How's Clint?"
"Tony," Tony provides. "And no, nothing hurts." Fred nods, and makes a point to check Tony over for any signs of bleeding, and Steve breathes a quiet sigh of relief when he finds nothing. Satisfied that Tony is at least superficially okay, he turns to Steve and repeats the whole process, taking care about Steve's knee.
“The labs I was in before were… sterile. Unwelcoming. This feels… comfortable. Familiar.”
But none of it matters. Bucky can be as outraged as he wants.
"This! You! Clint!" Steve sputters, waving his hand between them.
And Tony… well. There's nothing to do about Tony but wait.
"Making my way to the east perimeter," he says. "Things are looking too quiet."
They'll put Clint up high, somewhere he can't be seen. He's got good eyes, he can see from a long way. Clint will keep an eye on Tony, with Rhodey there to provide back-up. Sam and Natasha will scour the area for anyone hiding or planning an ambush.

“He couldn’t have known I’d survive.”
And yeah, actually. Tony really does love him.
, we're going to have a problem –"
“Sorry, I didn’t understand you,” Steve replies, flat tone and wicked grin. Tony rolls his eyes, but swallows before speaking again.
There's a steady stream of customers coming in and getting coffees – nine in the morning was a good time to meet because it means Tony can come straight to the coffee shop after dropping Casey off at school, but it also means that all the morning commuters are in, and he doesn't have much of a proper chance to talk to Steve.
What. The. Hell.
In front of him, the 3D displays light up, and he studies it for a moment before nodding. “Right then. Give me everything we have on Barnes’ recovery, and all the tech stuff Natasha pulled on the Winter Soldier project.”
It's a dangerous thought, so he forces his mind back to the here and now, where he's wrapped up in a Rhodey hug. Which, he has to admit, is a close second in the 'best hugs of his life' running, because Rhodey hugs are
"Leave it with me," he says. "I'll get it sorted. One way or another."
“Here I am,” Tony agreed.
at you. Every time you opened your damn mouth, every time you smiled, every time you were a stubborn, snarky, infuriating asshole, I wanted you.”
"So, tonight then. Rolling, crashing vehicles?"
Tony presses up, pushes up onto his knees and hitches a leg up and over Steve's lap so he can straddle the other man. Steve groans and kisses Tony more fervently as Tony sits on his lap. Tony shifts forward, feels the answering beginnings of arousal at Steve's groin, and lets out a low moan of his own as he lets his blunt nails scrape down Steve's chest.
"You are," Bucky agrees. "But we never would have reached that point because I would have eventually just kissed you to get my point across."
"Loki is
"Fine, you caught me," Steve says, leaning up and pressing a peck of a kiss to the tip of Tony's nose.
"Lucky for you, I love scrap metal," Tony says, completely ignoring the apology. Before Steve can stop him, he's come around the far side of the counter and is waltzing his way into the kitchen. He takes off his perfectly cut jacket and drops it haphazardly on the counter, and starts to roll up his sleeves. "Let's see what kind of fixing up the old girl needs."
Tony looked up to meet Steve’s quizzical gaze, and his stomach fluttered.
a favour."
Tony freezes on the spot. Last ditch effort. If this doesn't work, Bucky has probably effectively screwed up any chance Steve has at happiness with Tony. For a long second, Bucky is sure that Tony is going to snap on him, but he doesn't. Instead, he lets out a shaky breath, and Bucky takes that as a sign that it's okay to step a little closer into Tony's space.

But clearly he doesn't want to.
He wonders, how much terrible loss can a man be expected to weather before that man can't get up again?
“Reading, huh. What’s he reading?”

"Well, okay. You remember how when Nat came in and announced she was going to be my new BFF?" Clint begins. Steve nods, and Clint continues. "Yeah, well turns out Nat is super cool and I kind of adore her and she was definitely right. But also, remember she told Bucky not to worry, because she and I were only going to be friends, and that I was into someone else? Well, Bucky kept badgering me about it, trying to figure out who it was. And I slipped and said 'he'. And I guess Bucky didn't know I was bi, 'cause. Well. Reasons."
Bucky's off to physio for the nerve damage in his arm, and Steve's headed uptown to the new location. They hired contractors for the main stuff, but now that it's finishing work like paint and flooring, they're doing some of the work themselves to save money.
forget everyone he stepped on along the way," she says.
"You've accepted that everything else about Haven was real, but you still refuse to accept that Casey was real. Besides, Strange made the mind stone a child because he knew you would love him, and protect him." Steve reaches over and cups his face, running a thumb across his cheek. Somehow, Tony manages to keep himself from looking away.
And Steve allows his answering laugh to wash through him, cleansing some of his worry.
"Please, call me Rhodey."
"I promise," Steve says, drawing an X over his heart.
wearing for underwear. Steve, at least, is wearing sensible, comfortable-looking boxer shorts. Really, they're completely unattractive, and he's so glad for that because the last thing he needs right now is to have to look at Steve in something sexy. It's bad enough as it is.
"Hey, Steve. Heard you were up here for a shower, and I told the kitchen I'd hand-deliver. How's Tony?"
“So, what do you want?” Stark asks suddenly, shifting so quickly from humour to serious that it almost gives Steve whiplash.
"Steve, hello," she says, voice trembling a little, as she leans in to kiss him on the cheek. "Are you okay?"
"Tony," Natasha says, kneeling in front of Tony and taking both his hands in hers. She looks up into his face, eyes steely. "We love him, too. All of us. We wouldn't put him in jeopardy. But they didn't even tell you what they wanted for a ransom. That means that whatever this is? It is first and foremost a trap. You go in alone, and suddenly they've got you, too."
Sure enough, she completely ignores Rhodey, and stands beside Tony's chair, smiling down at him.
Steve is already running, has been since Tony put the glove on. But he's not fast enough, and he can't get there before Tony uses the stones. The beam of light from his glove splits – into two, into four, into a thousand beams of light, flowing out from him and into all the beasts in the horde, into Thanos' generals, into every enemy on the battlefield.
Tony, who is so beautiful that it leaves Steve breathless, had helped him because he's feeble and ridiculous and – his knee? Really? They get into a stupid car accident and his
where they're located because he has to
"Steve Rogers," he says, taking the call. Tony watches from across the room, studying the curve of Steve's jaw, the way the corner of his mouth turns down into a frown. He knows that mouth, he knows what it felt like to have Steve's lips pressed against his, Steve's arms holding him. The memories make his chest ache, and make him want to get as far away as possible, as if running would get him away from everything he's feeling. But that's not an option.
"Earlier, after we crashed. You weren't here for a minute. You had a, what, a flashback?"
"Yeah, well, I've been... busy. You know how it is," Tony shrugs. "The DoD thing, it's really got us tied up. And now there's the new thing from that meeting last week. Lots of stuff on the go."
"You should go, Steve," Natasha says from her bedroll in the med tent when he stops to check on her.
Steve doesn’t mind, because Stark’s not wrong. Everything he learned came from ally scraps, or on the fly in the war. Even just a few minutes sparring with Stark shows him that the man knows a hell of a lot more about fighting technique than Steve does. So he listens as Stark explains how to engage his whole body and move through a punch, how to keep his guard up so he doesn’t leave himself exposed, how to keep from telegraphing his movements before he makes them. It’s… fun. He can honestly say that he’s having more fun than he’s had at all since he’d woken up. Since before then, really, all things considered. Stark shows him a few basic combos, how to break through his opponent’s defences and follow up with a strike of his own. By the time they step apart to catch their breath, they’re both sweaty and flushed.
Rhodey is back to laughing at him again. "Bickering like a married couple already. I tell you, Tony, it's a match. You two sharing a room?"
"You have no idea," Tony mutters.
And then, of course, things finally did devolve into name-calling and hair-pulling.
“Play safe!” Clint called after them.

Steve blinks, heart sinking. "Anything you want, Tony."
Steve heads out to the front, then, to find Evan working the till.
"I should have –"
"This is our first line of defense," Strange agreed.
manage to find his way to the reality construct, there has to be a second line of defense there."
Tony glanced around at their group. They were going to need all the help they could get, if Thanos was on his way.
"Well, sure," Bucky shrugs. "But they're all going to be a hell of a lot more expensive. This is the best deal for the quality and type that we want."
"Uh… I really don't. Buck, you got the counter for a sec?" Hunka-Stevie turns to Man-bun, but he's already untying his apron from around his waist as he speaks. Man-bun rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath.
"Yeah, we should get out now and try and beat it." Tony looks mildly disappointed, and Steve looks at him quizzically. "What is it?"
. He's warm and solid and here in Tony's arms, kissing Tony, big hands working their way up to cradle Tony's head, fingers burrowing into Tony's unkempt hair.

"The rest of our date," Tony tells him. "You may remember, ours was interrupted."
"Help you?" He asks, voice gruff.
Steve looked like he was going to say something else, but he didn't get the chance.
"Tony, you know as well as I do, the reality was different, different history, different experiences that influenced us, but it was still us. It was still real. Everything we felt was real. You know that," Rhodey says gently.
Casey to grow up like he had – with a silver spoon shoved so far down his throat that he choked on it when he hit his rebellious teenage years.
He'll sleep later. Probably.
Tony blinks, not expecting to have been called 'sir'. Well, maybe there's a chance to salvage this negotiation after all.
“Then what’s it like, huh? It’s fine, Steve, I get it. I’m not easy to be around. It’s probably better this way anyway.”
Steve just shrugs. “Can’t sleep, too keyed up,”
"Yeah, everyone's fine. It was you we were worried about."
“So, this sucks,” Tony says cheerfully as the TAC team works on securing the rest of the building. “Not quite how I pictured this evening ending. Mind you, nothing about this is what I pictured, including you being here. You never answered my question about why that was.”
"Yeah," Tony agrees, reaching out his hand and lacing his fingers with Steve's. His voice is rough, dry. Steve should get him some water, but he's frozen in place, pinned by Tony's intense gaze. "Yeah, we
Tony had fallen in love with him in the Haven, too. That's enough for Steve. It's enough to make him believe that Tony might still feel something for him now.
That gets a shaky laugh from her, and she and her friends turn quickly to leave. But she pauses for a second, and turns back to face him. "Mr. Stark, one more thing. How the hell did you figure that out? With the Polyethylene glycol, of all things?"
"But it's the best plan," Strange said. "It gives us more time – Thanos won't be able to find him."
Tony nods. "Is it intelligent?"
And, by the smug look on Rhodey's face, he

Three hours later Steve finds himself sitting at a dark wood table by himself., eyes scanning the busy club as he tries to look inconspicuous. It is a nice place - upscale decor, classy and chic in that modern way. Tucked away in one corner is a VIP area, and nearby is a doorway with a security guard standing in front of it. Steve knows from the plans that it leads back to a private area. Already, he’s seen several of the dancers lead clients back there. Of course, on paper there is no sex being traded, of course not, that would be illegal. But, if certain clients are prepared to tip well in order to arrange for a more… intimate experience, well, now, that’s different.. And off the record.
They take Tony's car and another from the Stark Resilient motor pool, splitting up into two teams. Tony drives his own, with Rhodey and Clint, while Steve drives the Stark Resilient car with Natasha, Bucky, and Sam.
Tony's upset. That's not right. "Hey, it's okay, Tony, we're both okay," Steve tells him. They sit like that for a moment, holding each other while their brains try and orient themselves to what's happened. The car landed upright, but it's smashed to hell and in a ditch. There's no way they're getting it out without a truck.
you."
He works on the Stark Resilient stuff first – not because it's a higher priority, even though, technically, it probably is. More because the thought of leaving Casey in someone else's care for the better part of every weekday has his heart clenching painfully in his chest.
"Whoa, careful. Don't strain yourself," Steve teases, then gives Tony a more genuine smile. "But thank you. I appreciate it. Like I said, I love the neighbourhood, and I want the shop to be a part of it."
"I don't – I don't know what to do. Shit. How did this happen? Fuck, Steve, I did everything. Everything I could to keep him safe."
