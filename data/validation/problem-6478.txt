“Drinking never have I ever,” Tony counters, because, despite all his big talk, he’d rather be drunk than naked.
Tony can see his fingers go white where he’s gripping the sutures, and he can’t take it; he reaches over and takes Steve by the hand, physically pulling it away from the wound.
In his eyes, Steve sees the returned affection he hadn’t dared to hope for. He doesn’t know what to do with it.
“I track signals from everyone, now,” Tony says, “just in case. Saw the call was coming from inside the house.”
Sturdy metal chains, probably reinforced with something he can’t break — adamantium, perhaps, titanium. Sturdy metal chair, unyielding under his fingers. Hotel room, probably. Fancy. Ornate four poster bed. Coffeemaker with dozens of little pods, Starktech. Smell of air freshener. Crick in the back of the neck.
Steve is putting a bouquet of blue hydrangeas, likely cut from the garden, on the windowsill. His light blue shirt matches their petals.
Both of then crave touch more than sex. They curl up in Tony’s bed, and Tony doesn’t bitch about the faint smell of blood and sweat, doesn’t mention the dirt that still sticking to Steve’s hair.
It’s almost cute to watch him try, the same way as it’s cute to see a lion with a tutu around its neck. He’s out of his depth talking modern politics — Tony’s sure that SHIELD must have tried to catch him up on modern events, but without the context of having lived them, his words ring hollow. Even the decision to put him the new Cap suit, with everyone else in their evening best, draws a line of separation between him and the crowd.
Two days later, the Bruce Banner injects himself with the serum and the Hulk tears apart Manhattan. For as long as Tony had known a day like this was coming, that, eventually, the Ultimates would be deployed against real threats, he doesn’t know that he can do it before he does it. Days after the attack, he can still feel the places where the Hulk’s fingers had dug into the sides of his head.
He sets the roses down on the microphone stand, suddenly unwilling to approach the casket at all, feeling like something may rise out of it. Barton stands at the same time he leaves the stage, and Tony doesn’t turn to go and see what he’s going to do. For all he knows, for all he’s going to do about it, the man’s here to piss on her still-empty grave.
Familiar plans spin out in Tony’s mind — the three piece suits, the ballroom, the finger foods Steve will certainly struggle with— and he smiles.
Maybe Steve will talk to Iron Man about his feelings. It’s an unfair hope, but Tony can’t help himself, can’t stop the stubborn desire to know.
Who would that be? Jessica, Natasha, possibly Bobbi Morse and Clint, hell, maybe Carol or Rhodey, of all people. It’s not the kind of party he tends to be invited to.
Eventually, things get personal, as they always do. Thor switches tracks and focuses his attention on Tony.
He doesn’t really care anymore. The mansion, located just outside New York City, isn’t so far away that there is no chance that the Avengers — just Steve? — will make it here in time. His chest aches, familiar little sharp pains sprinkled in, and he remembers his first time coming face to face with Steve as himself. He’d nearly had a heart attack.
By the time they drive the lava monsters back, Steve can tell that Iron Man is exhausted, his walk less natural and more supported by the suit. He didn’t sleep well last night — Steve gains this from the dark circles under his eyes, visible through the slits— and at the end of the day he must just be a regular man, nothing like the super soldiers than surround them.
He squinted into his device, frowning slightly, and seemed to do some kind of rapid fire math in his head, “Around 2018.”
“Yeah, big guy, I know, I was there,” Tony reaches forward and taps Steve on the shoulder. He doesn’t know what he means by this.
“The, uh, the glowing red sword,” Tony clarifies, wondering how he’d expected Steve to get that one. He’d never known the guy not to fall asleep in the first five minutes of an action movie.
Tony listens to it over the comms. To his tired, overwhelmed ears, it sounds pretty damn inspiring, hits all the right beats.
Something about her eyes briefly disarms him; by the time he thinks to step back, to grab his own identicard, to shout, her hand is resting over his heart and he can’t move.
He turns his hand over, and shows her his right thumb, where another person’s fingerprint had unmistakably been etched over his own thumb, close set ridges in an unmistakable swirling pattern. Underneath it, on the skin just under his wrist, another shape pokes out from beneath his sleeve. It's a faded, water-damaged pattern, a circular shape with a long line jutting out.
“Well, mine’s gonna be easy,” Arnie says with a shrug. He’s rolling a marble between index finger and palm, long fingers pale in the moonlight. Steve likes watching Arnie’s hands, his fingers, likes the careful, thought-out way he moves. He likes Arnie’s place, Arnie’s family, likes it when Arnie stretches and bumps their shoulders together. He’s too young to think anything much of it.
If SHIELD has this written down, anyone else could get their hands on it. If SHIELD has this written down, it will take one breach for the whole world to know, and then it’ll be their words, and not his.
He takes Steve’s hand and pulls it into his lap, tracing his fingers over the layers of solid muscle. He’s build himself a body, once, and he most of what he remembers about the process involves layers and layers on top of each other, bone, muscle, skin, fibrous planes intersecting, overlapping. He imagines what it would be like to pull Steve apart, imagines what he looks like underneath the skin, more muscle than Tony has ever seen on a body, opened up and on display. Some part of him feels like if he can only understand Steve if he sees the inside of him, the raw parts hidden away from the world, but even under the skin, Steve’s perfection incarnate. He could be the musculature diagram hanging on the walls of every biology classroom in the country.
Still, he seems fond of the guy, sometimes halfway defensive. A whole lot of talk he’s ready to dish out but butts in with, “
Tony rolls closer, worms his way under Steve’s arm, and breathes in deep. Freshly showered, Steve smells like almost nothing; Tony catches the faint whiff of his own bodywash, a tasteful mix of cardamom and cedarwood.
He knows this before the man even starts speaking to him. They have the vibe about them, the way they’re holding themselves, the way they’re dressed, the weapons they carry, too well-armed for their levels of skill. Terrorists.
“My pleasure,” for a moment, some semblance of a familiar, well-oiled charm enters the other man’s voice, an echo of the way he must be used to talking in press conferences, boardroom meetings, on TV. It’s lost as quickly as it had come, and Stark stumbles, his knuckles white on the hand he’s holding the cord with, “I mean, no, it’s not. It’s not my pleasure at all.”
People will know what happened to Iron Man, once someone at the autopsy peels off his shirt and spies the chestplate underneath. The hydrangea is still on his left arm — the imprints last at least a few days, normally. This will get out; he’d had a soulmate, who had drawn flowers on his arm. It will reach Steve, and Steve will know.
He doesn’t really remember when Steve takes him back to bed. It’s the low note of concern that draws him back to reality, a rubberband’s pull.
“So,” Steve says, casually, completely oblivious to Tony’s confused inner monologue. “You never said what the charity event is for.”
“Red, yellow, green, alright?” He asks, leaning in to press a kiss to the corner of Steve’s chapped, pale lips.
Pietro is showing off, batting one of the robots around. Wanda, looking bored, doesn’t seem to have gotten off her phone.
“Wouldn’t be half as fun if you knew, would it?” Tony sets a hand on Rogers’s waist, giving him a light push towards the door. It’s all that’s needed; he goes without further protest.
His cold arm tingles, likely a sensory side effect of his weak heart shutting down the access of blood to his extremities, reminding him he’s not likely to get home. He shuts his eyes.
“Are you doing alright?” Steve asks him, as they rejoin the rest of the team on the trudge back up to the helicopter, and Iron Man nods.
Rogers makes a grab for the book, but Tony steps back, holding it out of reach. “I don’t even know who’d let you read this.”
I said I was posting every week, but the giddiness of finishing a fic makes me immediately post it literally every time. Hope you enjoy this chapter! It's the one where the sex happens.
Steve’d had a dream a few nights ago of someone sitting at a piano in a grand old house, the kind of house that only exists in books, with marble staircases and high ceilings and clean, dark floors, sunlight filtering through the wide windows. It’s just a dream, but it’s all he can think of.
He leads the two men back to the dining room, past all the hallways where Tony has been boxing up his accumulated junk. It’s humbling, to see his everything he’d impulse bought in his twenties laid out in neat boxes in front of him, as meaningless and disconnected from him as it had been when he’d purchased it.
“I couldn’t help noticing all the potential you’re coming up short on,” Steve says, his tone light, almost playful, “and I’d find it useful to test myself against someone stronger than me for once.”
Amora is already waiting for them. She stands so still that Steve could mistake her for a statue, especially at her height, but even in the faint moonlight, her long dress sparkles.
He arches his back and lets Steve hit him, hesitant and slow at first, and then, warming up, hard and fast.
For a second, Steve thinks he’s been shot. A sharp pain pierces his chest, leaving him breathless, nauseous. His vision swims. He can’t breathe. Something warm and slightly painful swims over him, a current, hot ants, waves of powerful, warm waterfall,
He doesn’t think this chapel had ever hosted such an empty ceremony. Barton sits front row at the funeral of the woman he’d killed. Fury has taken a seat in the back row, his face set, and Tony wonders why he’s here. Had he, like Tony and Barton, ever cared for her? Is he here to send a final farewell to one of his agents?
He still passes on the offer of pizza, leaning against the rec room refrigerator. Oddly enough, it’s Fury who glances over at him, assessing. Tony wonders he’s worried about being poisoned; he certainly comes off as paranoid enough.
The Avengers mansion is explained to him. He’s shown inside. It’s warm and well lit, a grand old house, the kind of house that only exists in books. Steve shivers. The Wasp steers him over gently to sit on the leather sofa in the sitting room — it’s the kind of house where the sitting room is separate from the communal room, which is separate from the living room — and so he sits.
“Jan, baby—“ Steve starts, discomfort climbing quickly into a more pronounced, angry sort of upset, but Jan hears none of it.
Without asking, Tony reaches over and unzips the biggest pocket of his cargo pants, shoving the glove parts inside. “Careful with the sauce, now,” he says, like Rogers is a child, and doesn’t stick around to watch his reaction.
Natasha, who’s laying halfway across Tony, her shirt undone despite no losses calling for it, scoffs.
Jarvis arrives minutes after Steve goes. He knows how to work the equipment in here, knows his way around a first aid kit. Still, Tony can’t talk him out of calling a doctor.
The thing is, though, that Steve isn’t the kind of man who likes secrets. He likes everything on the straight and narrow, likes to understand and be understood. He likes to label things. He likes to be in control.
Steve sits back down on edge of the bench-like leather seat, tense in anticipation of movement. There’s more space here than most cars would have, but they’re both tall men. If they do this, this’ll be a little awkward.
“Well, what do you have that I want?” He asks, practically. “I’m the man who has everything, darling, favors are the way of the world.”
Steve knee walks forward, a tiny, delicate little step that seems almost comical to Tony, his face screwed up in concentration. Tony sits up slightly on his elbows, watching him through his eyelashes.
He can see Tony gesturing, describing someone. Thor, probably. He’s leading Amora to believe he knows him, that he may have some information for her. She’s nodding along, all her attention on him.
So he’ll write a letter, to be opened after his death, where he’ll explain everything and apologize and tell Steve to find someone else. It’s the decent thing to do, the only decent thing to do.
“I can’t help your heart,” Steve said, his hand slipping upwards to rest on the back of Tony’s neck, just where the metal stopped. “But as long as you’ll have me, I’ll be here.”
It’d be funny, Steve thinks, if someone had a soulmate that didn’t love them back, that had another person entirely waiting for them. When he says as much to Arnie, though, Arnie stares and shakes his head, frowning.
Tony starts on his way out, making a slow circle along the outer edges of the room, engaging a dozen or more people in polite conversation as he says goodbye. Each time Steve thinks they’re about to go, another face seems to pop up, and he resigns himself once more to waiting. Annoyance bubbles up in his chest — is this necessary? Can’t Tony just
He thinks about making conversation with the Pyms and immediately discards the thought; married couples younger than him have the tendency to make him feel depressed when he’s like this.
Being Iron Man and running a company and worrying about his near-constantly failing turns out harder than just running a company. Who would have figured? And still, Tony joins the Avengers. Tony finds it easier to escape into the persona, to let his teammates know him as an idealized version of himself. He feels good as Iron Man.  His vulnerabilities are hidden away from the world, locked away behind thick slabs of metal. He flies.
Steve turns back to the television. His shoulders droop a little. If he didn’t know better, Tony would think he’s disappointed.
His new butler — the one whose name he still doesn’t remember, ten years older than him with a chubby baby face and crew cut hair — is overeager to please. He fetches Tony cocktail after cocktail, and Tony’s thoughts swirl, more and more disoriented, anxious in new and unexpected ways, as the evening fades into night.
Steve picks it up and holds it open for him, and Tony pushes himself and shoves his arms around at random until they’re in the sleeves. It’s almost sweet. Hell, it
“I know,” Steve started cautiously, “That you don’t spend as much time with the team as, er, the rest of us, but— we’re all very grateful to you. You spend so much time on our suits, on our technology. You opened your home to us, to— to me. I didn’t have anywhere to go.”
He’d nearly killed himself, he knows. The brain damage from the nanites could easily have been fatal, and he’d known it as he’d done it. There’s a perverse sort of relief that, in the end, it hadn’t been him.
“Well, if time isn’t linear,” the Wasp suggested, “maybe it can wait. We’ve got something we want to show you.”
Cohen croons. He sounds closer to the mic than he normally does, somehow more immediate. Tony picks up Steve’s silk tie and wraps it around his wrists, binding them together loosely, parts his legs and steps on the end of the tie.
“Oh, just.” Tony comes to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve, and, unable to help himself, flicks on a little display light overhead. The smooth rubber buttplugs on the top shelf shine slightly in the yellow light. “This and that.”
“I’d say have fun, but that’d be against my own interests, wouldn’t it?” As Cap sits back down, Tony lets his hand fall casually onto his shoulder, squeezing the place where his neck begins. The curve of muscle is solid, perfect, and Tony thinks he could close his eyes and be able to identify each muscle in Cap’s body by touch alone. Here’s the trapezius, and there, under and over, the deltoid, and there—
“I’m not a Nazi! I didn’t mean to say I’m a Nazi. Fascism is— it’s bad. That's my catchphrase, actually. Fascism... bad.”
Isn’t it only normal that Tony keeps wanting to force him into terms he understands, into his own territory? Isn’t it normal that he sees the weakness and longs to dig his fingers into it, pull it apart, to take control? It’s only as sexual as he lets it be. It could be the start of a wonderful friendship with slightly uncomfortable deeply homoerotic undertones.
“Now, we can’t have him interrupting.” The man steps forward, pulling something dark out of pocket, black leather. Steve tries to crane down to get a better look at that, and stops short.
But no. It’s too big, too grand, the whole wall coming down. Steve catches a glimpse of gold and red as Iron Man moves past him, a blur of motion. He hears shouting, sees repulsor blasts, this time fired skillfully, precisely. More men, guards, storm the room.
Steve sighs and stands to go talk to the pilot. Tony wonders who it is and guesses Happy Hogan. The missing body heat has left his side cold. He’s suddenly shivering. The implications pour over him in waves, relief mixing with regret. The helicopter changes its trajectory, soars back into the air.
He rushes over, undoing the gag first. Amora’s green scarf is soft to the touch, and Steve finds himself using the clean side to wipe around Tony’s mouth, under his eyes.
Now, Steve wasn’t so sure. Maybe this was a prank, and there was a reason Iron Man hadn’t shown up. It didn’t quite seem his style, but, as uneasy as he felt about the whole thing, Steve was ready to believe it.
“Well, Gandalf cracked,” the voice is familiar, though Tony can’t assign a name to it — one of the techs they’d left their perps with, “showed us the wand they’d been using on your guys and everything.”
He lands by the team, listening to their idle chatter. He wants to pull the helmet off, but he doesn’t want them to smell the alcohol and bile, so he refrains.
“What’s she upset about?” Steve asks, ten minutes into the episode. A busty woman with bright blue eyeshadow whose name is either Carmella or Cornelia or something along those lines is wailing the telephone to her friend.
And then the other man looked past him at the lab, his eyes stopping first on the Wasp and then on Tony, and his expression changed so quickly that Steve wondered if he’d been seeing things. Had anyone else caught that look?
Someday, he’s going to make Steve slow down, watch him take his sweet time with himself. Tonight, he only wants to get close, to feel Steve’s body over him and around him, taking him in.
Instead of answering — though they’re alone now, it certainly feels like the walls at the Mountain have ears — Steve cranes his phone up towards Tony to let him see.
Another beat passes between them. Steve, finally, seems to have caught on to the fact that this isn’t normal. He’d really wanted to say the phone thing, Tony guesses.
It could be, Tony thinks, just the fact that he’s in his suit and not his uniform, that he blends in with the crowd relatively well. He’s still awkward, sure, unaccustomed to the kind of conversation made here; automatically, Tony finds himself bailing the guy out when things seem to be getting out of hand for him.
By the time he’s stepped around again, the conversation is over, and it takes him far too long to pick out either Amora or Tony in the crowd.
Steve screams in earnest when the blast hits the center of his chest, red-hot pain blooming across his entire front. Only the epicenter of the blast feels nothing at all, and he knows that’s a bad thing. Third degree.
Not Iron Man turns. His face is no longer holding shape. His cheekbones slide up and down, sharp one minute and flat the next. His lips are chapped, well taken care of, pale, red, close to his short nose, far set from his long one. His hair is blond, ginger, brown, black.
The Wasp offers him sliced fruit and Belgian waffles for breakfast in the mansion’s neat, sunlight kitchen. They eat in silence, his sadness finally having contaminated her as well.
And so the conversation moves on. Before she bids him goodbye, though, she promises to introduce him to Tony Stark the next day. That doesn’t happen. Two days later, he gets an apologetic call from her; Stark, apparently, is very busy. Steve, who has better things to do, things like wallowing in his own grief and checking out the gym, decides that it’ll happen eventually and lets it drop.
Every single part of him is tired. His brain is tired, the kind of tired that often makes him turn to the bottle, a too-raw, too exposed tiredness that leaves him too wound up to sleep. His body is tired,  an achey tired that makes it impossible to relax. His little day planner seems sag under the weight of the appointments contained within. Even his skin is tired, bruised and over-tender, the concealer greasy and heavy on his face. It feels woefully inadequate for the shiner Iron Man had just gotten, the one that had dented all the way through the helmet, bent metal hitting Tony’s skin. It feels like people are going to know.
“I was wrongfully imprisoned,” 2018-Steve said, casting his eyes down, “by the Skull’s people. My own people — my team, I mean — tried to bust me out, but something went wrong with the portal.”
“Can you believe I actually planned to seduce him when I first joined the team?” she asks, “God, look at him.”
“Yeah,” Steve says. “It was the moon, you know. The moon landing. It made me remember you. It made me realize there had never been anyone else.”
For a moment, the man in front of him is solid again. Tony Stark stands in front of him, well put together and calm, his black suit ironed, hair smoothed back. He takes a step forward, looks at his bound counterpart, and then vanishes into thin air.
On the other hand, he has little experience with the cutting, crushing sort of pain of Rogers’s world. He’d come out of the battle with the Hulk barely bruised, protected by the armor, while Cap had gotten up and talked to the cameras through mouthfuls of blood and ribs that Tony had
On the left, he’s stored a neatly folded up Berkley Horse. Swings and bondage equipment hang from the hooks. On the bottom shelves, he has the impact stuff, the duller paddles on the left and sharper stingers — the crops, canes, and their lot, his personal favorites,— on the right.
They don’t talk about what happened, and Tony honestly expects they never will. It’s not their style to talk about this sort of thing. Either Steve will keep doing this with him — Tony has already made clear he’d like to continue — or he won’t.
“Uh, it’s either orphans or medical research,” Tony guessed. “Unless it’s the environment, but those guys don’t tend to love me, so.”
Steve twists, trying, somehow, to join the fight, to shout out. Something in his chest pinches and gives, pain ricocheting over his whole body, vibrating through his bones. The figures around him blur in and out of focus, impossible to follow, and, finally, disappear.
“I like having lunch with you,” Steve said, feeling a little silly. “I like our games of tennis. You gave me a room here, but it’s— it’s the way you treat me that makes it a home. The way you treat all of us. We’d miss you. All of us would. We need you here, too.”
The body, he realizes, his thoughts still coming too slowly, will need to match up with the story. In the next ten minutes, this man intends to kill him.
“With Hank,” Steve adds miserably. He’s pulling on the stitches hard enough now that Tony thinks they might give. “Who damn near killed her. Hit her in the face hard enough to snap her palate clean in half. I don’t understand how—“
“Yeah,” Stark says. There’s a cord in his hands that he’s toying with, now. Steve can’t quite tell where it leads; if the idea wasn’t ridiculous, he’d swear the cord disappears under the man’s shirt. Slowly, he stands up. He’s surprisingly tall, taller than he’d looked sitting down, and handsome up close, a long, Greek nose, carefully trimmed mustache, pale blue eyes. Steve’s extra-sensitive sense of smells picks up on his cologne, an earthy, slightly flowery scent.
“You know, you’ll only find them there if they’ve already been arrested,” Ty points out, peering over Tony’s shoulder as he starts on the first of 903 possible matches, all slightly off. “So, you know, if you want a criminal as your soulmate…”
“Leave a note,” Iron Man insists. His tone is more urgent, now. They’re running out of time. “Write the team a note. Tell them you’re safe with me. Pick up the pen and write while I don the armor, Steve.”
He’s still sitting on the edge of the tub when Steve slides, slowly, to his knees and takes Tony’s dick in his mouth, swallowing him down all at once. Tony grips the sides of the side of the tub for balance. You’ve just got to do things, he thinks, and catches Steve’s head with his thighs.
If they turned downstairs, they were headed towards the workshop. But if they turned up, in the direction of the bedrooms, of Tony’s bedroom, then—
Steve wants to ask. Tony had seen him kiss Iron Man. Tony had seen him almost leave, almost assume the worst. He’s under no illusions now; he must have been under the same magic that the missing men had, some personification of his desires. Iron Man had played the role of the mistress.
The disappointment stings, but he’s forgotten about it quickly enough. It’s hardly the heartbreak of the century; no one gets their soulmate on their first try.
The moment of the discovery, the feeling of being constrained, sends panicked adrenaline coursing through his veins. He yanks, twice, hoping to brute force it, and then forces himself to calm down and assess the situation.
He likes this, likes that Steve lets him press and probe, likes that he can take Steve’s big, heavy head and push it this way and that, likes feeling his skull under his skin.
His stomach twisting further, Tony kneels down by the leg of the chair and pulls the first leather strap tight around his ankle, tying it to the chair leg, then moves on to the second ankle. Steve is warm and solid under his fingers. He doesn’t scar, but Tony can still map out the places where he should have: his left thigh, where a bullet wound had been only a few weeks earlier, his knees, so often scuffed and bloodied after the falls he takes on missions, his chest, where, last year, an explosion had left its marks.
There it is. Physical proof; there’s now way to dispute this, no way Bucky could have wished these words onto his own arm the way Steve thinks he must wish his dreams into his head.
“That’s just a birthmark, Tony,” his mother tells him, gently taking him by the hand and setting said hand down on the couch next to them.
Tony stares up at Steve, wondering if he’s somehow offended him. It feels nebulously wrong, what he just said, but he can’t place exactly how.
“If you guess it, I’ll tell you if you’re right or not,” Steve says. He’s drawing them into the confines of a game, again, that not-quite-real space where things mean less, matter less.
One of the men snips the zip ties on his wrists, and Tony is amused to realize that he’s using safety scissors. Their handles are bright green with grooves for fingers. Tony is going to die here.
It’s not the first time he thinks about his soulmate upon waking up in the future. It’s not the first time that it occurs to him that he must have left her behind in the past.
its walls and tables white and sterile. Counters and shelves, along with machinery Steve doesn’t recognize, occupy every inch of wall. A long table stretches almost the entire length of the room, dotted with microscopes, test tube stands, machinery. Tony Stark sits perched at the table some fifteen feet away from him, a little device in his hands. He’s sitting on a stool, one of his socked feet up on the table and his other knee under his chin. A half finished ham and cheese sandwich lays abandoned by his elbow.
None of them believe Thor about it until it’s too late and Hawkeye’s family lays slaughtered in their warehouse, the man himself missing. For the first time in their year-long relationship, Tony sees Natasha cry.
“We’re gonna head out,” Steve says, waving awkwardly with the hand under Jan’s knees, “thanks for having us, Tony.”
Steve is seven before he seriously gives the idea of soulmates any thought. He’d known about them for ages, of course, in the background hum of storybooks and speculation, but it hits him all at once that, somewhere out there, there’s someone for him.
He pulls a robe on over his short undersuit, slippers over his bare feet, and, feeling comically out of place, rejoins the team downstairs. It seems strange to be a part of this group, mostly military or secret intelligence, people hardened by circumstance and force of will. Even now, Tony feels like an imposter, like a boy playing action figures, bashing his glorified transformer doll against Captain America and Thor.
Hydrangeas are blooming outside, in the mansion’s garden. Steve, who should have questions to ask, statements to make, sketches the shape of the flower, four-point blossoms layered on top of each other. He adds the individual texture, shades with the pad of his thumb.
“Let him get dressed,” Tony intervenes, swiping the belt out of Jan’s hands to toss to Steve, “let’s get this show on the road. Drinks, Jarvis?”
“You know,” he says, as Cap pulls off his coat and Thor steps forward to look around the roomy hallway, “I really can’t tell you how fabulous it is to see you boys again. That fight with the Hulk was one of the most exhilarating experiences in my life.”
The knowledge leaves him reeling for a moment, nausea rising again to the back of his throat. He’d thought himself alright with death, but faced with it here, the banality of it — some terrorist group he’d never even heard off, a dusty room and fucking bright green safety scissors — he can’t quite stomach it.
“Never have I ever lied in never have I, uh- never,” he announces, swirling his martini. Drunker than he thought he was, he’s watching Natasha, desperate to know, suddenly, that she’d really never cheated on a partner. It doesn’t add up with his conception of her, and something about the possibility endears her to him, makes him feel, again, that he isn’t quite worth her.
Tony lets the heavy tidal wave of pain drag him back down. Smaller aches, distinct even in the general haze, shoot down his neck, up his temples. The night comes back to him in pieces with an accompanying weary embarrassment.
A strange suspicion, almost too strange to be investigated, made its home in Steve’s head. It was too pressing, too strange, to be ignored, and, slowly, he followed his counterpart and Tony down the hallway.
“— another complication, when I’m fuckin’. I’m fuckin’ dying already. Wish I coulda’jus married her.”
By the time he’s eleven, he’s copied the print — possible to separate from his, he’s learned, because his is an ulnar loop, and the black print on top of it a plain whorl — and compared it to the prints of every relevant classmate. Ty, the only one who he’s let in on his plans, laughs at him.
For a moment, both of them are silent. They could drift back off to sleep like this, never mention it again. Tony seriously considers it. But something catches his attention, and he frowns.
He doesn’t ask, just puts a hand on the side of Tony’s jaw and forces it open to shove the ball gag inside. It’s a tight fit, and it pinches with the kind of discomfort that promises pain in the morning, overwhelming and huge in his mouth.
After thirty minutes, he retreats a few blocks away, buys himself a coffee, and texts Steve his location. It’s another four hours, each accompanied with another coffee, before Steve actually walks through the doors of the establishment.
“You want to frame Iron Man for my murder,” he says, slowly, “that’s why you’ve got me in his equipment.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, realizing he couldn’t be so selfish, couldn’t keep Tony from this. “Yeah, of course. When are you going?”
There’s one way to get out of here; he could write to Steve, get the street name down. He could break his silence, out himself. And then what? Leave Steve heartbroken, trying to fake happiness for a soulmate that’ll never be enough for him?
It break the mood further if he got up, now, to shed all his layers like he longs to do, so Tony spreads his fingers out and traces his fingers over Steve’s pecs. His heart, he feels, is jackrabbiting against ribs. His dick lies limp against his leg, matching Tony’s.
“Because I—“ Stark’s still breathing far too fast. If anything, he looks paler than he had when he’d first seen Steve. He glances down, his eyes searching, evaluating. “I hate America.”
Steve exhales a little bit, relieved, and glances around the room for anything they can use to free themselves.
Steve throws him a look that indicates, clearly, that he recognizes the unfair play, knows exactly what Tony had done. He’d have to be stupid not to, and Steve is anything but stupid.
Coming down the hall to the gym arm in arm with her, he thinks he catches a glimpse of red and gold in the glass door to the laboratory. He stops in his tracks, staring.
They make eye contact, briefly. Pale blue eyes stare at him through slits in the red and gold mask. Steve feels a wave of deja vu, strong enough that he’s almost dizzy, hit him. Iron Man is alive.
“Never have I ever said the wrong name in bed,” She says, keeping eye contact with Steve. She’s definitely drunk, her words slurring slightly, and though her voice is light enough, playful, Tony already knows Steve won’t take this well.
Now that he knows what he’s looking for, he finds a request for backlogged files from the server a couple days before the guy had resigned, and curses again. No way to know what he’d taken, but Tony is sure it can’t just be just the comms.
As Tony assures the terror cell that this’ll just be a quick fix, he promises, he tries to tally in his head how much time he has left. On a good day — which, considering the drugs and the exhaustion and the stress, this is decidedly not — he goes twelve to fourteen hours between chestplate charges. He had last  charged it at around eight that morning. Judging by the setting sun outside, it can’t be past seventy-thirty, but can’t be much earlier, either.
“Please don’t do that,” Tony says immediately, sobering up, “I’m going to be fine now. I — I really can’t risk…”
It’ll look better for the company’s PR to see Iron Man on the ground defending their property, would look like he, Tony, is doing something. He wouldn’t be surprised if #WhereIsIronMan is trending again on Twitter.
“Knows how to make a guy feel like the heroine of a Gothic novel,” Steve agrees drily, “big old mansion with nothing but ghosts and a mysterious host in the halls.”
He would almost have preferred it; then, at least, they could have a nice team party, no grand expectations. Sure, the team didn’t
Thank you to everyone who's stuck with me & with this fic! I would love to hear your thoughts. If you'd like, you can also find me on tumblr under welcomingdisaster. Sometimes I take writing prompts!
It’s a love language they both speak better than any other. He kisses her neck, her breasts, spending time around her perfectly formed pink nipples, runs his hands along the curve of her back.
For a moment, he feels it on his own skin, the tingle of cold fingers against a bruise, cold, air conditioned air hitting his sweat-drenched back, his foot hooked on the legs of a stool, his elbows against a cold metal table, creamy concealer blending onto tan skin.
Tony doesn’t want to think about that. He rattles on steadfastly, pushing the conversation in waters that could easily be fun for all of them. Rogers pushes him on it, (“What would people do,” he keeps asking, “if they knew? What would they think?”), but when it comes down to it, he’s a good soldier. He’d make an awful whistle blower, and Tony feels a strange security around that fact. A little loyalty has never hurt anyone.
Silently, Steve guided Tony over to sit on his bed, helping him down. Tony was staring down at the floor, avoiding his eyes. “You’ll be okay,” he repeated, “won’t you be okay?”
It’s the real deal, the same helmet he’d worn into war, scratched and weathered after years of service and decades of storage, the leather cracked and dried with age.
Tony leans against the wall in the hallway as his two guests go for their coats. Thor’s headed for the door first, and he lets him go, his eyes fixed on Cap.
The older man was unobtrusive as he left. He didn’t try to convince Tony of anything else. He didn’t throw any strange looks in Steve’s direction. He seemed, if anything, only concerned.
He hears the shower turn off and strips, methodically, the way he does getting ready for bed. Shirt off, into the dry cleaning basket. Jacket and pants back in the closet. Socks into the laundry. It leaves in nothing but his underwear. It’s a thong, cheerfully red and on-brand.
He pulls his pants on, too. “Just let me get him a doctor, Natasha. There’s a chance — people have survived worse, as long as it didn’t go—”
“You want me to suck your dick?” He asks, the obscenity as casual as a request for popcorn. “Nice and easy, you can lie back.”
“I don’t know what it is,” Steve continues, stumbling over his words like an eighth grader forced to give a book report in front of the class, floundering, “if you’re— in love with someone else, perhaps, or if you— aren’t wired that way, if I’m not—“
He can see that the formality stings, but Tony only presses his lips together, a thin, white line, and shakes his head. “Okay,” he says, sounding like he’s trying hard to look amused, sardonic, and just missing the mark, “tell me what you think I’m upset about.”
He’s gotten what they need, Steve thinks, judging from the set expression and the little nod. He’ll stay long enough to make sure his going will not be suspicious, and then they’ll regroup.
With this in mind, Tony calls his secretary and then his tailor. He needs a half-decent reason to drag Captain America along to one of his cocktail parties if he doesn’t want the paparazzi to sniff out how far into the gutter his brain has gone about the man.
All night, he’s watched Tony faking it. The easy confidence at the party, the for-the-camera smile, the small talk, the wounded, clearly-fake nonchalance in the car. He’s been able to tell the entire time. Of course he was.
Only Natasha remains as matter of fact as always, barely affected by the news. When Steve switches the channel, landing incidentally on Thor’s Sixty Minutes interview, she snorts, high and girlish, and throws her head back.
Cap’s not stopping him, though. He wonders exactly what he could get away with, what Cap would let him do.
He mops up the beer and carries the soaking paper towels inside, raising them high like distance will somehow prevent the liquid from dripping onto the floor, like it’ll see the ground so far below and decide that falling so far isn’t worth the effort. As he’s rinsing the yeasty scent of his fingers, he spies a pen on the table, Bic and plasticky and more cheaply made than anything Stark usually leaves around. He picks it up and stares at his arm.
Rogers bristles just slightly, and Tony can’t tell if it’s in response to the suggestion or the pet name. It’s best to offer the dog a bone.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Never have I ever given a blowjob.” It’s not meant as anything — he knows full well that this is the one game where Cap never loses, and is aiming to get the ladies out— but this is where he sees it. Two tiny spots of color appear on Steve’s cheeks, and he makes a tiny upward movement with his glass of coke, as though about to drink, before he refrains.
Tony grins, wide and excited, feeling like a kid at Christmas. Or— a kid just before Christmas, making a list of everything he’d like.
Steve settles into the background, watching Tony chat up a balding man in his forties he must know from somewhere. He can’t help imagining attending the gala with Tony. He’s gone to several functions with the man, finding charity galas generally a safer event with him around — few people are as skilled at politely ending conversations. They’d shared jokes about the other guests, once, when a retired general had not been able to unstick himself from Tony’s orbit, trying to coax him into a weapons contract, when a tipsy old lady had made it very clear she’d noticed Steve in the Biblical way. That evening, he thinks he had seen a different side of Tony.
century politeness really breaks, and realizes he’ll have to call off the arrangements. He’s not cashing it in then.
“I’ll be there.” Steve said, stepping forward. He reached over to squeeze Tony’s shoulder, but only metal met his hand. “And I’ll miss you.”
“Easy, fella,” Steve tells him, as Thor steps in front of them, hammer at the ready, “you’re okay now. We had a hunch you’d be needing us.”
Mistrustful, he gives them nothing. His hand tingles. He’s lost the glove. He stares at the ink on his skin, which blurs and fades rapidly, dissipating. It doesn’t strike him as anything but exposure to air killing something that should have been dead a long time ago.
When Steve returns to New York, his nose recently broken and knuckles bloody in a way that tells Tony he had beaten them to the bone, he knocks on the door of Tony’s brownstone.
The two of them stare at his hand, expectant, and then angry black slash marks come through on Bucky’s arm, blotting out entire patches of skin. Steve realizes she’s crossing out the words, going over them in thick circles that must leave no writing legible on her hand. The scribbles quickly cover what she’d written over Bucky’s wrist, too.
“I just talked to Janet. She and Thor are going to be on the perimeter. Before escalating, we’ll alert them via identicard. If that doesn’t work out, it’s shouting distance.”
But it wasn’t Iron Man who had just had the clear vision of spilling beer onto Hank Pym’s shoes on the balcony. It hadn’t been Iron Man who had warned Cap off with faked handwriting, had told him they could never meet, could never talk. Iron Man doesn’t have warm skin on which shaky drawings of hydrangeas appear, doesn’t have inky fingerprints sitting dark over his thumb. Iron Man isn’t hiding from his soulmate in the only room of the mansion which he hasn’t yet found, cradling an action figure to his chest like a little boy.
One moment they’re talking and the next moment she’s undressed, a blur of skin on skin. He’s kissing her, and then she’s kissing him, and then he thinks he’s sexy biting lightly at her nipple, but she says, “ow, that hurts,” he says, “shit, darling, ’m sorry,” and she’s tense, under his fingers, and he’s drunker than he thought he was, and he’d thought he was drunk, even, and she says, “maybe just lay back and let me try to take care of things?” like she’s trying to be polite, and then he throws up and she wipes it off with the silk sheet and props him up on his side and leaves and he—
It’s dark outside, and suddenly much colder than Tony remembers. As the cross the road to get into Tony’s valeted limo, the icy chill seems to pierce right through his blazer and under his skin. Even the car, almost stuffy with canned heat, can’t seem to cure him of the cold. He’s shivering.
His heart beats faster, guilt coiling in his stomach. Steve had said something. He loses track of words, tries to remember.
“Her husband shot her lover,” Tony says, and then, in the same breath, “God, I’m so fucking lonely.”
He still hasn’t met Tony Stark a week in. He and Iron Man apparently live part-time at the mansion, but the two of them remain the most elusive of any related to the Avengers. It’s the butler who reminds him to eat, who shows him around the place twice and brings meals to his room. The Wasp, who flits in and out, checks in occasionally, fills him in on the details of how the team operates.
“Are you sure,” Tony asked, his quiet voice only audible across the workshop to Steve’s superhuman ears, “that it’s safe?”
He accepted a glass of mead from Thor, sipping at it sulkily on the couch. His bad feeling, he told himself, was probably not justified; the man had clearly been
“Gorgeous souls, or some shit,” he slurs, accepting another glass from the butler, “what does anyone really care what the dangly bits are shaped like, old boy?”
“Already?” For a moment, Steve hoped his counterpart had been lying, that this was some kind of diversion, but a portal was opening, slowly, in the middle of the workshop, glowing light blue and pulsing. Steve could see nothing beyond the swirling rectangular void.
He’s certainly heard all of them, back in his day — though, to be fair, there had been fewer then — but that none of them have ever fit him.
They drink. Though Thor and Steve stay another hour, sipping coffee and eating the figs Tony has gotten into the habit of getting imported, Hank and Jan never show.
It’s unfair to Steve, most of all. Steve is the one left alone in the modern world, with no clue as to why his soulmate has rejected him. Steve is the one who will outlive and never have the chance to know what had happened.
His vision swimming, he squints at the sliver of street sign he can see through the open window. Behind the sign, he can see a bagel shop — Dave’s Bagels and Sandwiches. He’s on the intersection of 134th and— is that Br—
Steve speaks casually, pragmatically, like they’re talking about breaching a top secret facility or training exercises for the team, “Well, at some point, we’ll run out of things to bet on. Thought you could come to my place for a change tonight.”
He’s the pleasant kind of buzzed, which is rare these days, appreciative of the company and the warmth of Natasha’s skin on his. Thor’s the only person invited who hasn’t shown, and Tony isn’t surprised; as much as he loves the guy, he’s felt like the fifth wheel a lot, lately.
It’s been three weeks since he’s found out the truth of Iron Man’s identity, and somehow time has only complicated and soured his feelings. His uncomplicated, eager affection for Iron Man and his uncomplicated, amiable acquaintanceship with Tony Stark have smudged and blended together into a tangled, uncertain grievance against both — the one — of them. This, in turn, had left him avoiding Iron Man at team debriefs and Tony Stark in the mansion, which, in its own turn, had led to him feeling some kind of way about it, a way he couldn’t precisely define. Lost, maybe. Ashamed. They couldn’t go on like this, he knew.
Tony puts a hand on the back of his shoulder, feeling the solid curve of muscle, the little divot by his clavicle. “Whatcha reading?”
Tony sighs and forks over the medical information expected of him, running through the motions — he doesn’t know how long he has left, exactly, but the specialists place him at six months to five years. It’s inoperable.
A thought, unbidden, creeps into his mind. He’s heard, before, of writing to your soulmate, writing on skin. He knows it doesn’t work most of the time — where would the intrigue come from then?— but somehow, he’s convinced it’ll go through now. It’s a childish confidence, the feeling that if he wants something badly enough it can’t fail.
“Ah,” New-Steve sat up, and took his counterpart’s cautiously offered hand, getting to his feet, “Happy late birthday. 25’s a biggie, isn’t it?”
to remain friends with, to whom he still feels an irresistible physical attraction, that he’s worried about.
Arnie’s chin bumps the top of his head as he straightens up. His hand is still on the other boy’s wrist, pale fingers on soft, freckled skin. They make eye contact, briefly, and then both of them glance down at once to the little rose.
“If this gets out,” Fury says, calmly, “you’re going to be discharged from the army. We are going to fire you. Your apartment is paid for by SHIELD. Your equipment is paid for by SHIELD. Your team is paid for by SHIELD. Do you have friends, Rogers? Is there anyone on whose couch you’re going to be able to crash after that particular revelation?”
Now, with both of them changed into civilian clothes and sitting comfortably on Tony’s ugly yellow living room couches, Tony is beginning to think they might have a problem.
“Nice try,” Tony said distractedly, turning back to his machine. “Just give me a few minutes here, folks, you can have a seat if you want one.”
Steve reaches for something behind them, and Tony sees him pick up something bright red, shiny plastic.
Tony’s taken off his sunglasses, and his eyes are sad and kind. Steve’s anger runs hot. “Are you going to be fine for the mission?” He asks.
Tony, who watches him more than he would admit, has seen him read the same paragraph over and over again for minutes, his expression vacant.
“Come home with me,” he says, the exact same request he’d had a year earlier. “Call Jan if you want to. I could use a drinking buddy.”
Steve opens Tony’s hand and folds a little metal bell into his fingers, closes Tony’s fist for him. It breaks the immersion for a moment, a reminder of the fantasy.
They watch, Steve in disbelief and Iron Man without much reaction, as Thor dives straight into the lava to pursue their attackers. And then, knowing there’s no time to spare in a situation like this one, Steve takes Iron Man by one over-heated elbow and leads him out of the ditch and back to the surface.
The first time Steve sees a strong bond, the kind of bond he’s read about, learned to covet, it takes him by surprise, takes all of them by surprise; Bucky shouts, a flavor of pure excitement Steve hadn’t heard in his voice for months, now, as weighed down as they’d been by the realities of war. He follows the sound of the voice, and sure enough, there it is.
The plan is set, then. Tony has made it without him, because Tony had known all the information and held all the cards.
He wants to push Rogers around. He wants control. That, too, is natural enough; he’s never gone for easy, and to bring someone like Rogers to his knees — anyone would want that. Anyone, straight or otherwise, would chase that power rush. It says nothing about him that he didn’t already know.
Tony cheats; he’d built the robots, and he knows how they come undone, the exact weak points to hit. He takes out four of them to Steve’s two, and then they break for lunch.
He steps into the walk in closet, flicks on the lightswitch, shuts the door, opens the inner compartment, stares.
Tony flexes his fingers around the clapper, draws breath through his mouth, cold air squeezing in around the gag, and gives a little nod. It’s all Steve needs.
The wrists of all of the girls in class remain clear. Steve is caught, told off, and made to go wash his hands.
Both of them are breathing heavily. Tony tries to match his breaths to Steve’s but keeps falling out of synch, too fast, so he closes his eyes and pretends they’re breathing in tandem anyways. Steve undoes the cuffs on his ankles and the strap around his knees, rubbing at the skin there.
The feeling stemmed, probably, from his strange emotions about the man himself. It wasn’t that they disliked each other; they’d always been cordial. Steve liked the guy, wanted the guy to like him back. Mr. Stark had offered Steve room in his home. Mr. Stark had funded the team. Mr. Stark joined Steve, these days, for games of tennis and lunches out on the mansion’s terrace. But something about the man’s presence — his perfectly tailored clothes, his simple, expensive colognes, the air of sophistication which hung around him — made Steve feel like he was somehow not enough.
He doesn’t get a match until he thinks to check army records months later. By then, he’s read the chances of two people having the same fingerprint: one in sixty-four billion.
“Big words for someone with a DUI,” Tony returns, casually.  By then, he’s used to the kind of shit Ty gives him, returns it easily enough.
Sensation overwhelms him, and it takes him far too long to realize that Steve is checking in, looking at the bell, at Tony’s face. He’s checking in.
“The Wasp did say you had a thing for, uh. For Cap.” He doesn’t say ‘for me,’ and Tony wonders why not. If anyone is the same inside and out, in their mask and outside of it, it has to be Steve Rogers.
“Oh, golly, Cap. I don’t know how to tell you this.” He pauses, seeming to consider his words. “Mr. Stark arranged that with Molecule Man. Why do you think it had been so easy to talk him down?”
makes him think of men who wear makeup and dresses and dance to the sorts of show tunes even the gals scoff at.
He can’t sleep for a long time, that night, twisting and turning the stem of the clover between his fingers. Uneasy dreams catch up with him in the morning, dreams of huge, dry deserts, of explosions, sending sand and machinery flying into cloudless light-blue skies, the sandy, coarse dust in the air so vivid he can taste it.
“And?” Tony steps forward. Steve can easily save his dignity; whatever else Tony can do, he certainly can’t read his mind. Part of it — of admitting his feelings about the ending, the awful, strange way he must have felt taking in those final paragraphs only weeks out of the ice himself — must be a kind of weakness. On top of that, he doubts Steve is the kind of man who likes owing people.
Janet has shrunken down and disappeared one of the robots and is struggling with the mechanisms Tony has constructed inside, causing the thing to careen back and forth unpredictably. This, naturally enough, leaves Steve and Tony to try going hand-to-hand with the things.
He realizes the chair had fallen because Steve had twisted his left ankle and broken the chair leg. Despite having been on top of him, Tony hadn’t felt him move.
Instead, he’s armed with a neat little revolver and dressed to the nines, the black of his suit so deep it seems to reflect light. He’s dyed his hair; the gleam of unfamiliar ginger keeps catching him off guard in mirrors and the windows of the armored cars around them.
“Lived to die another day, comrade?” Natasha asks him, specifically, her voice low, husky, and a little amused. “I’ll see you again.”
Steve’s heart had damn near stopped. He hadn’t said anything, watching Fury with the wary eyes of a cornered predator. Let him make the first move. Let him say what he knows and what he’s ready to do with the information.
as he fell, followed by the clink of metal against the tile floor. He was a big man, blond, dressed in an orange jumpsuit. He smelled like sweat, and his hair, from behind, looked greasy.
“Never have I ever flashed half of SHIELD,” Natasha counters lazily, “dick slips count, Tony, drink up.”
He took the letters from Tony, thumbed through them, and tucked him into his inside pocket. “Nothing for Iron Man?” He asked, noticing the missing letter. He didn’t want a momentary lapse of memory to leave the guy feeling abandoned, forgotten — and they’d certainly always been close, Iron Man and Tony, right?
This leaves him on borrowed time, already overdue. He guesses the chill in his hands and feet is a symptom, an early warning.
Presumably, his soulmate is close to his own age. If, whoever they are, they haven’t been arrested — and haven’t enlisted in the army — by sixteen, it’s probably a good thing.
Someone slaps Tony hard across the face. The pain of it seems to come with a strange delay, as though traveling through a fine cloud of agar — distantly, he imagines injecting colored dye into Petri dishes to color cells specimens, the slow way that the colors would trace out through the jello-like substance. That’s the way the pain hits.
It’s goes further than that, though, and Tony is self aware enough to know that. Thor is just as muscular as Rogers, just as a blond, and perhaps only a little less pretty.
“I saw the light on in the—“ Steve glances around, really taking in the room for the first time, “well, what I
Rogers flushes slightly. He’s reactive, Tony has noticed, unable to control the way he breathes, the color in his face, the sharp movements of his eyes. Again, Tony remembers the war he’d lived, wonders what it must be like to go from a world of irreverent, battle-forged camaraderie to one where people worry about his micro expressions. How many people in this room could eat him alive?
Tony escapes the room, his heart beating hard in his ears, and wonders if it’s normal to feel so afraid of his soulmate.
down in response, but it stays on his arm, unfading, just under the strange message in the fake-rounded hand. Something has broken the connection.
“Isn’t it just.” Tony agrees, drying his hand off with a napkin. “Quite the spread here. Didn’t cheap out on the catering.”
“Guess he’s a hard man to get a hold of,” Steve says, stepping around her to stare at the open armor on display. It must be the same suit he’d worn when they’d met. The inside, open and on display, is a soft yellowish gold. For some reason, the chestplate is missing.
Tony wishes there had been a photograph, imagines telling this long-dead man about the cosmic size of this coincidence. The frustration of his first hit being nothing hit hard, but, at the same time, he’d gotten a hit.
“Why’s she gonna be easy?” He asks, though he doesn’t actually want to hear about Arnie’s soulmate — the jealousy, he’s sure, comes from his being anything but easy.
“Just a headache, darling,” he says, pinching the bridge of his nose. It’s not a lie. He doesn’t remember the last time he’d woken up without one. The faint buzz of alcohol — champagne, which never hits him the way he wants it to hit— is doing nothing for it.
“Oh, you poor dear!” The Wasp cried, stepping forward to wipe a piece of grime off his face. New-Steve bows his head and submits to the scrubbing, looking at ease, looking comforted. “Tony, darling, can you get those handcuffs off him?”
“That I won’t like it?” Rogers wipes pizza grease off his fingers and stands, eyeing the book. Tony wonders if he’s thinking of a tussle. He’s not a fan of that thought, because he doesn’t see himself coming out on top. “I could just lie.”
Steve stays silent for the rest of the night, and Tony murmurs aimless, senseless compliments, his hands alternately in Steve’s hair and on his thighs.
“Is that metal?” Steve asked, unable to help feeling his way up Tony’s back, where lukewarm, hard metal seemed to bracket his whole upper body. “Mr. Stark, what—?”
He jolts awake, the dream only half-remembered. His eyes are watering. His blanket has fallen on the floor.
against the wall. Sometimes he feels like Steve likes fucking with him, like he’s doing this on purpose. Had a
He’s chatting a tall blonde in a low cut sparkly red dress. By now, he’s been drinking slowly for hours, and the level, calm warmth of it, the feeling he chases, always, when he reaches for the glass, is upon him.
with Iron Man often enough in casual conversation, careful not to let on the depth of his interest. Iron Man’s opinions of Stark seem as contradictory as Stark himself. He’s a good boss, apparently, but certain things — Iron Man’s identity, for one—  cannot be brought up with him at all. Iron Man is both close to him, close enough to know his exact opinions on a dearth of subjects, and completely subject to his will.
Rogers offer his hand over slowly, like he’s expecting some kind of trick. Tony smirks and digs his fingers into the thick seams around the fingers, looking for zippers.
He sleeps fine, the first night. The sleeplessness doesn’t come until the reality of his situation sets in, which is almost a week down the line. He’s already said, by then, that he’ll join the Avengers, has already saved them once after they’d been caught unawares by Vuk.
Tony appeared in the hallway before they had the chance to talk further. He was dressed in a nondescript black outside wear, sporty and form fitting, and he looked awful, dark circles obvious under his eyes. He was carrying a backpack, and bundles of paper, and he seemed a little surprised to see two of Steve.
Tony makes a little humming noise in response, glancing up to catch Steve’s eyes again. For a moment, they’re just looking at each other. Steve doesn’t know what he’s feeling, can’t access the deep thrumming tension in his gut well enough to break it down.
The chains are deceptively hard to get off Tony — now that he thinks back to it, the ease with which the imposter had freed him should have been a red flag — but through a combination of brute force and clumsy lock picking, he frees his hands and goes to work on the ankles.
Now, staring at his lopsided little cake, unevenly covered with frosting and shaky lettering, he felt this more than ever.
“I hate this game,” Steve announces, stripping his shirt back off. The tension between them, Tony thinks, is genuine. Trouble in paradise. “Jan, we’re gonna have to go soon. I want an early start—“
He tries to yell out — should have tried earlier, as soon as he’s known Tony was somewhere near, what the hell, Rogers, — but the gag muffles the sound completely, like he knew it would. The man smiles approvingly and takes something else out of the bag.
When he wakes, he’s strung up by his arms, his feet barely brushing the concrete floor under him. His shoulders ache, sharp pins and needles traveling up his arms as he tries to move them. He tastes dirt, spits a glob of it out onto the concrete floor in front of him, along with several long green blades of grass. Cemetery soil, he thinks. On the way down.
“Is there a reason,” Steve continues, picking his out carefully, clunkily, as though they’re particularly heavy objects, “that you care so much to know?”
He hadn’t wanted Tony to see the cake. The cake looked like garbage. He should have been happy that it had been cut up without any attention being paid to it.
Iron Man smiles at him. It’s a wide smile, open and honest, the kind of grin that sends butterflies fluttering through Steve’s chest, in his stomach.
Angry male voices are speaking to him. Angry male hands are shaking him. He’s cold. Someone has thrown water in his face, and it dribbles unpleasantly down his check and under his shirt, pooling between skin and chestplate. Tony’s body has grown heavy and light at the same time, and moving it seems an impossible feat, a physics problem without a solution.
Something smells good, hearty, which is unusual for this type of gathering; in Steve’s experience, expensive finger foods rarely smell of anything at all, leaving the air space free for colognes and perfumes.
“Did that count?” Steve asks him, as the two of them landed on the protruding foam cliff where the rest of the team had already started, mostly, to disperse. “It wasn’t in training.”
“Steve,” he says again, out loud, feeling a ritualistic thrill in this resurrection, “Steve Rogers.”
He wasn’t. The sad, absurd irony of the situation hits Steve. He tries to kick up, angling to kick the man in the chest, but the drugs leave him sluggish, weak. The man ducks easily out of the way, grabbing Steve by the hair and sliding the bar of the gag in place with little resistance, fastening it behind Steve’s neck.
Captain America’s right thumb is covered with black ink, held in all these years by the tightly-set glove. The other glove had torn, but this one, heavy and rubber, had stopped the water from coming in before the ice had. Just above it, on his wrist, the same circle-with-a-line symbol is water-damaged and smudged. Tony wonders, distantly, what meaning it had once had.
Betrayal curdles into his stomach like milk, turning sour and resigned. It’s on him, when it comes down to it; he should have seen it coming, should have been more thorough with the background checks, should have been a better judge of character.
He has another training set up. He’d planned this one for weeks, and he’s proud of it— he’s erected models of cliffs all over the facility, connected only by rickety bridges and vines. Underneath, he’s had cushions and nets hung, ready to catch any falling team member. They’ll be attacked by the same training robots.
Steve tries to scoot the chair over towards the desk, but it’s stuck in place, completely immovable. Magic. He wouldn’t be surprised, he thinks, if there are no locks on the chains.
“Uh, sitting.” Tony improvises. He hadn’t been sure what he’d say until he said it. “Those heavier dining chairs. Bring one in.”
The water is a little too warm, stinging pleasantly against the swollen skin on his thighs. Tony sees Steve picking up the body wash and hands him the shampoo bottle instead, gesturing to his own greasy hair. Steve rubs his scalp, scratching lightly with his nails, and then massages his jaw, sore after the gag.
he thinks now, the same way he thinks when he’s talking himself into a third drink, a fourth, a fifth.
Tony thinks he could leave and Cap would just stay standing here, indefinitely, with that same aimlessly determined set of his shoulders, the same torn uniform, blood dripping from his nose onto the shiny tiled floor.
When he raises a hand to his face, though, he realizes his eyes are dry. Blinks twice, confused, growing concerned, spins on his heel to look around himself, suddenly realizing he’s unsteady catches himself on the gravestone of Charles Rice, 1981-2003, misguided in life, now resting safe and at peace, crumbles to his knees.
That shouldn’t surprise Tony — if they’re soulmates, after all, they ought to be compatible — and yet somehow it does. On a whim, giddy with the strangeness of it all, Tony reaches for Steve’s shirt collar and pulls him in.
Natasha doesn’t accompany him to the funeral. Watching Steve and Jan leave hand in hand, Tony has to fight an overwhelming sense of loneliness that threatens to overtake the background hum of guilt.
Reasonably, this is the time to back off. Tony’s personal fantasies aside, there’s no need to make the guy uncomfortable, especially when they’d been getting along just fine moments earlier.
“Med bay at the mansion,” Tony compromises, “I’ll call my own doctor. But it’ll be fine now. The danger’s passed. I have, uh— I have experience.”
Steve reaches over and runs a thumb over Tony’s chin, tilting it up slightly so they make eye contact, “That gonna go alright?”
The food is brought out almost alarmingly quick. Nauseated by the greasy smell of Steve’s burger, Tony breaks his pickles into smaller and smaller chunks on his plate, sending rivulets of salty, greenish water soaking into his cheese.
When he leaves the room, he feels like a foolish little boy, caught reading a library book he can't understand, trying to make himself into something he can never be.
He turns on the screen, almost unbearably bright in the dim room. Normal human eyes wouldn’t able to make anything out from such a distance, but Steve squints and picks out the words.
Rogers, who Tony has expected would embody the gruffness he radiates, is strangely quiet. He’ll crack a joke if he can fit one into the conversation, but, considering half the team’s verbal shorthand seems to come from pop culture references, he’s out of the loop as often as he’s in it. He brings books with him to the recreation room, big hands comically careful with the pages. It’s been two weeks and he’s still working through
Steve reached up to put two hands on his shoulders, bracing them, and Tony’s eyes darted towards him.
This time, it’s Steve who kisses him. He feels the physical sensations less, now; it’s more as though he’s being pulled under a tidal wave of feeling, pulled along to a place where he’s perfectly understood.
He’s aware of how much time is passing, minute after minute. His arm tingles. His fingers and toes grow colder and colder. His heart will fail him, if this keeps up for long enough. He takes some grim satisfaction in knowing that he’s fucked up the weapons’ blueprints for the terrorists, that his “corrections” are going to make everything depicted impossible to build.
He kind of misses the sass he knows Steve would give back (could’ve just said that, he imagines, or, perhaps, what a surprise, I’m doing all the work), but watching Steve prepare himself is distraction enough. He’s businesslike about it, quick; he doesn’t waste time faking anything, which makes whatever emotion Tony can catch feel precious. There it is, just briefly, Steve’s eyes shut in stinging pain-pleasure, the corners of his mouth tightening.
No, Tony thinks, this isn’t about that. Steve’s willing to leave at any time, but he wants to leave with Tony.
"That was nice.” He assures him, pressing his face into Steve’s neck. His usual tension, the low thrum of anxiety, of
Dismissing the thoughts as as unhelpful, he checks his phone again for a message and instead scrolls through the familiar headlines of Stark stock plummeting. Old, half-resigned dread bubbles up in his stomach, and he sets the phone back down, goes manually through old records to mind the missing shipment.
There are two couches in Tony’s comfortable sitting room, both a cheerful yellow that he’s sure he didn’t pick out. They’re both angled towards the television, creating a sort of semi-circle. They also do the job of breaking the four of them into self-contained pairs, Steve with Janet and Tony with Natasha. It’s comfortable, almost ordinary.
They made a good looking pair, the two of them, Steve thought distantly, watching the two silhouettes enter the portal, nearly the same height, Tony’s slightly slimmer, sharper figure a pleasant contrast to Steve’s wide, stocky build. They walked together like old friends, like a couple, hand in hand, except—
s when it’s someone else saying it. It’s classic, almost brotherly. Seeing his best friend so relaxed about Stark, occasionally defensive, helps put Steve at ease with him as well, makes him feel almost protective; Stark’s strange, sure, but he can’t be so bad.
They’d spent the past week tracking down some cult in New England which claimed to be capable of black magic. Though Tony had initially dismissed it as either mutant powers or chemical weapons, he’s beginning to believe their claims. Just as they’d rounded up the last of the group, Cap had been hit with a blast of something green and strangely lemon scented.
By twenty, he begins to feel like maybe there’s something wrong with him. By then, most people around him have gotten concrete ideas of what they’re looking for, what their soulmates will be to them, act like, speak like. He listens to descriptions:
He knows he’s been laid down on the floor because he’s staring at the ceiling, and hushed voices debating what to do next — he’s faking, he’s dying, we were gonna kill him anyways, shut up, idiot, don’t be so loud — and he thinks he ought to close his eyes but doesn’t.
He doesn’t get to know why. He doesn’t get to know how the bruise had happened. He doesn’t get to know if she’s in danger, if whatever had hurt her could happen again. She’s inside, somewhere. Her skin is tan.
Steve puts a hand on his shoulder. “You’re only fifteen,” he says, “this is a whole lot earlier than most people get to talk to their soulmates at. You’ll have plenty of time to find her. It’s meant to be, kid.”
This has to be the reason hypothetical-Tony cares about this, after all. Hypothetical-Tony, despite making a dumb mistake, is still Tony; he hasn’t caught feelings.
On the way there, they fill him in; they’re dealing with an invasion of some kind of inhuman beings, ones apparently either made out of lava or capable of somehow harnessing it. Stark had been the first to get the call. Iron Man has left ahead of everyone else, and is now facing their mysterious foes alone.
If anything is said after that, Tony doesn’t remember it. When he wakes, Steve is gone and someone has tucked a pillow under his aching head. He tries to sit up, and—
When he comes to, which can’t be a very long time later, he’s in the waiting room of an office building, his head resting on scratchy bright yellow sofa cushions. The light is too bright. His chest hurts, the cool air stinging exposed skin. The gag is off. Tony, half in the suit and half out, is pulling the handcuffs off him as well.
“We should have Steve and Jan over,” he tells Natasha, one day after he proposes. She’s sitting across from him on the couch, her feet on his lap.
“It must have been— I don’t even know what,” Tony said, shaking his head. “He told me everything I wanted to hear. Promised me everything I wanted to have.”
They don’t talk about it. When they get there, Steve uses Tony’s shower and Tony drinks by himself on the yellow couch, waiting for him. They watch bad TV. The night passes how Tony expects it to, and by the time he wakes, Steve is gone.
“Confetti on your shoulder, my dear,” Tony said, reaching over to pluck a bright green piece from her dress, “and my birthday yesterday. I’d hardly need to be Sherlock Holmes. Will you find the showers okay, Cap?”
When it ends, Tony feels like it’s only just started, or perhaps like it’s the only thing he’s ever experienced. Steve lets go and his legs shake and fall forward without the support. He rests his bound ankles on Steve’s shoulder and Steve lets him, turns his head to press a kiss to his lower calf.
Lunch finished, he keeps walking, sipping absently at the Fanta. He’s due back at work until the meeting with Hill at three, and, despite knowing he ought to be catching up on paperwork, he walks long, ambling circles through the New York City streets, not realizing he’s walking to the cemetery until he’s gotten here. The walks, too, have become routine, as has staying up late into the night to catch up on the actual work he misses during the day.
His hands were still on Tony’s shoulders, stabilizing, and it was easy to urge him forward, to close his arms around the unyielding metal brace. Tony buried his face in Steve’s shoulder, leaving tiny wet spots on shirt, and clung to him like a drowning man.
Instead, he just turns over and presses his face against Steve’s bandaged skin, feeling his chest rise and fall under his forehead. This, he tells himself, should be enough.
A kind of deep pain flashed across Tony’s face, a sort of longing, a guilt. He glanced down, shook his head. “We talked last night,” he said, “Iron Man and I. He knows.”
The next morning, Natasha watches, still in her lingerie — she actually sleeps in her lingerie, unlike any other girl he’s known, the lacy black push-up bra on more often than it’s off— and pulls him down when he tries to rise.
She leaves him, a little surprised by the connection, pleased, standing with Jan and Cap. He glances away, watching her go, as Jan gets onto her tiptoes and hugs Steve, small enough that the top of her head only barely brushes against his chin.
At some point during the night, he calls the blonde woman from the party. To his surprise, despite the fact that he clearly sounds drunk, despite the fact that he’s forgotten her name, despite the fact that it’s been over a week since they’d last spoken, she agrees to meet. He sends a car for her.
In 1941, a man had enlisted whose fingerprints matched the one Tony had been branded with near-exactly. No picture of him had been taken, and the information itself was sparse. His name had been Rogers, Steven. He had been twenty at the time he’d enlisted. He’d been killed in action on April 2nd, 1945, and had left no living relatives. Only two things seem notable about him; the fact that his file had been digitized, unlike the majority of the soldiers of his regiment, and his listed height and weight, which Tony is sure must have been a typo — 6’1 and 100 lb.
Tony, oddly delighted by this, runs his fingernail over the edge of the cut. “Guy with the lightsaber do that?”
“Never have I ever been photographed naked,” Jan says triumphantly, tripping up both Tony and Natasha.
He reads everything he can find about fingerprints. To his disappointment, there’s no database to find everyone’s fingerprints, and the way the dark outline intersects with the print on his own thumb makes it hard to isolate and identify specific elements.
And Tony, realizing he’s unable to define their relationship in any other way, makes it into a game.
Once they’re back in the classroom, Steve picks up his pen and starts scribbling on his inner arm, over his wrist. He draws daisies and roses, messy and arched, over his wrist, adds leaves and petals and little flourishes. It’s the very best he can make it.
This is playacting as much as all of this is, and yet Tony is drunk, suddenly, on the power rush of it as much as on the Bloody Mary.
They settle into a relatively stable dynamic. Both of them talk to the team, Tony significantly more than Cap. Neither of them talk to each other, outside of tactical exercises.
This has hurt Steve as deeply as anything else could hurt him, he realizes, which tells him two things.
At first, they won’t surrender the body to him. He hadn’t been her emergency contact. He wonders who had.
Tony turns back to call for Jarvis to bring him an obituary cocktail, and then remembers just who he is mourning for. He stands and grabs himself a bottle of wine instead, red.
It’s that morning that he leaves for Sin-Cong, that night that an ambush leaves chunks of shrapnel in his chest. He returns home and nothing is the same afterwards. If he ever takes the chestplate off, his heart will stop beating.
snap. He goes into fights like this anticipating pain, knowing how small the chance of him getting out unwounded is, and Tony can’t fault the hard grip he has, now, on his machine gun.
Tony puts a hand on Steve’s lower stomach, the bottom of his palm brushing against the place where his pubic hair starts in earnest, and pushes him lightly towards the chair. “Take a seat.”
He’d sat close to Tony that night, packed into his in-home theater. His cologne had been musky, rich, laced with the same mystery spice. There had been motor oil stubbornly clinging to his fingers.
“Really, though,” she says, once he’s washing their dishes and she’s perched on the counter next to him, black-booted feet kicking casually at the air, “it’s weird you haven’t met Tony yet.”
“You’ve had too much,” Steve says, wrapping an arm around her waist. Drunk and malleable, she tucks herself against his side, the earlier grudge forgotten.
He leads Steve to the sitting room, the one with the two yellow couches, one of the few parts of the mansion that still feels the same. It’s just the two of them. They sit on opposite ends of the same couch. Steve turns on the TV.
This should give him a feeling of power, but instead it only makes him feel like he’s overreacting. Anxiety, harsh and roiling, boils under his skin.
“I haven’t got much of anything. Maybe she likes music, ‘cos I had a dream kinda like that a bit ago, only,” he thinks of confessing that he knows the dream hadn’t been anything, that no one he’d ever meet could live in a world like the one that he’d imagined, but chickens out, “I don’t remember it all that well, so many not.”
He cups a hand around Steve’s neck and pulls him over to sit on the bed with him, puts his bare feet into Steve’s lap.
For a moment, the pain is all he can think, all he can feel. He thrashes against the bonds, shouts through the gag. Steve’s grip on his ankle tightens as he kicks up, against his hand.
“Without my transistors operating at full power to cool the circuits, I’m gonna have a hard time, here," Iron Man admits, discomfort clear in his voice.
So that’s how they end up on the floor of Arnie’s kitchen, Arnie’s arm stretched out over Steve’s knees. There are roses in the vase in the center of the table, ones Arnie’s dad had gotten Arnie’s mom — Steve’s never asked, but he’s fairly sure they’re the real deal, real soulmates — and Steve tries to copy the ruffled petals, the delicate swoops of the flower.
Steve comes back, carrying the wooden chair, and Tony directs him to set it down by the floor to ceiling window on the other side of the room.
He looks scary. His skin is clammy, black hair sticking to his forehead in lumps. His eyes are open wide and bulging. He’s dropped the cord in favor of clinging to his chest, with one hand, shaking his head. “Please go. Go, go, go.”
“Yeah, sure,” Steve says gruffly. His arm, muscled and long, immediately attracts the attention of the waitress.
Tony hears the beating of his own heart, the hard thrum of blood agains his eardrums. He’s a man of shooting shots.
Secondly, that he was wrong. This was never going to help anyone. There’s no way to explain himself in the little time he has left. There’s only one thing to do.
“I guess not,” Bucky says, staring down at the scribbled mess on his hand. After a moment, he pulls the bright blue sleeve of his little coat over it. His eyes water, and he blinks hard, drops clinging to his eyelashes.
Even a rambling, desperate Tony is conscious of when he’s in company. With a glance at the waitress, he lets his voice get quieter, “— I didn’t think what happened in the car meant anything. I’m not being weird.”
Here’s the issue: Tony knows addiction. He knows he’s been craving a hit of this, whatever power Steve is allowing him to hold, here, since the beginning of their relationship. And now that he’s gotten to taste it — as brief and messy and drunken and strange as it had been — found it to be precisely, wholly what he’d imagined—
“Best warm you up,” Steve mutters, not particularly directed at Tony, and grabs him by the ankle, folding his knees back against his chest. He keeps his hand on Tony’s calf, holding his legs up to expose the underside of his thighs, and strikes without warning, open-palmed.
Steve’s a dear, or perhaps Steve just believes in doing things right. He follows direction perfectly, going just where he’s pulled, his tongue working in tandem with Tony. He doesn’t give any indication he’d like to come up for breath. Super soldier stamina.
He stays dutifully silent as Tony pulls him forward to straddle his lap, working Tony out of his clothes with deft, quick fingers. He’s relieved, Tony thinks, amused by the thought, maybe a little anxious.
He wonders if Thor owns anything at all. He seems like the kind of man to live off almost nothing, buy almost nothing. Perhaps everything he has matters to him. He seems like the kind of man who has it all fucking figured out, doesn’t he?
“I saw the press release about losing communication.” Tony replies, feeling the need to justify himself. “I thought it could mean…”
Steve pulls another leather strap around Tony’s legs, under over the knees, locking them together, and then cuffs his ankles for good measure.
He braces himself against the arm of the chair slides into Steve’s lap, hoping that touch will close the distance between them.
It must be a Russian sort of practicality. Or, perhaps, she’s looking for justifications, even for something she’s innocent in.
There are no guards in the room. His captor’s trust in Tony’s equipment is such that he hadn’t bothered to bring back up to murder Captain America.
Briefly, he imagines the cocktail party, the tailored suit, showing off Captain America to guests he certainly will never like, imagines seeing where that 20
Tony’s breaths are quick, panicky. Steve looks over at him, sees the pale face, the eyes, glossy with something that could be guilt or fear or any combination of the above, the rapid rise and fall of his chest, and doesn’t know how to feel.
“Are you alright to continue?” He ought to know the reporter’s name. He doesn’t. He’d been thinking about sleeping with her, but suddenly, he’s just bored of the idea as the rest of the interview.
Shakily, Steve picks up the pen he’d dropped earlier, the one he’d been writing with in the journal. He turns the point of it on his arm and writes, his hand clammy and slippery on the little pen, “
“Alright, then,” Steve says, the intonation of a little ‘whoop’ clear in his voice. He’s loose, relaxed. He trusts Tony.
In the shower one night, still halfway sad drunk, feeling a little broken and desperately lonely, he remembers Steve Rogers, the World War Two soldier whose file he’d accidentally stumbled upon years ago, remembers the quote that had come to him about names and deaths.
“What are you talking about?” He asks, “It sounds like world war three is going on out there. We need to—“
Of course, Tony thinks, as the two of them turn to walk back towards the parking lot, of course he’s got just the one.
At first, listening to Steve breathe next to him, he thinks Steve is about to pretend to be asleep, that he won’t answer this one. When Steve speaks, his voice is quiet.
When he opens his eyes, everything feels momentarily too bright, and he’s dizzy. He longs, suddenly, to trade this crowd for the comfort of his memory foam mattress and blackout curtains, the cool crispness of his sheets.
His hands are sweaty as he takes the pen offered to him. He’s already thinking of the words he’ll need to say. It’s not Steve; he could have loved Steve in another life, he needs to write. Kind of loves him now, even, working off the incomplete information provided to him, he needs to write. Sometimes, he imagines their lives interwoven together, imagines waking tangled up with Steve on Saturday mornings, imagines the shield displayed proudly on its own stand in Tony’s apartments, the ultimate
“No,” she says, cruel now, “it’s because I find cancer-ridden drunks who smells of chemotherapy drugs attractive. Get a move on, Stark. I don’t have all day.”
“I’ve never stood someone up,” Steve says, finally, his eyes on Tony’s bright purple carpet, “on a date, I mean.”
But she interrupts him, continuing as though he had not spoken. “I’ve been trying to find out what he wants. It’s so easy, you know, with all your people. You, for instance—“
A sick, strange feeling settles in the pit of his stomach, something like grief, like longing. Part of him wants the easy out, Iron Man without Tony Stark. Part of him wants the man who didn’t lie to him, the one who’s understood him all along, who’d put Steve’s happiness, their feelings, over his own secret identity, who’d been held back by some outside force.
Thor leaves first, clapping each of his teammates on the shoulders in turn. Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch don’t bother saying goodbye — Tony wonders if they had, indeed, actually been in battle— and Hawkeye gives a distracted wave as he leaves, his phone at his ear.
Jan, tipsy in a giggly, hyperactive way, is playing keep-away with Steve’s shirt. “Never have I ever,” she suggests, her voice slightly winded, breathy, “strip never have I ever.”
He doesn’t hit as hard again. He doesn’t need to. Every nerve in Tony’s body feels overexposed, pulled to the surface just under his skin. Steve hits with his flat palm, once, twice, three times, and the sharp pain dulls and mellows.
“Jesus, Stark, you’re drunk,” he tells himself, shivering despite the steady stream of warm water trickling down his back. The momentary flash of clarity, of knowing, is gone as quickly as it had come. He thinks
He fell face down, only barely catching himself on his elbows, and something made an uncomfortable, creaky sort of
Now, Steve likes to put a hand on Tony’s knee when they sit together after missions at the Mountain, his own long legs parked on the coffee table. When Tony’s driving — and Tony drives, mostly, when they go out together— Steve puts his elbow on the center console and curls his fingers lightly around Tony’s upper thigh. He bumps shoulders, rubs elbows, sneaks up behind Tony in the kitchen to press his forehead between his shoulder blades. It’s warm. It’s loving. Tony likes it, craves it when he’s away from Steve.
He takes someone home after the party, a brown-eyed brunette who isn’t quite his type but seems like she’d be sweet when he won’t be able to get it up. Later, in bed, her hands in his hair and his mouth on her nipple, he thinks about how he’d enjoy fucking Rogers.
A loud clanging, huge and metallic, sounds outside the window, jolting Tony straight back into reality. She’s on top of him, so he pushes himself up on his elbows to try to look out the window, adrenaline flooding into his veins. “What the hell was that?”
He hiccups, again, loud. He could stop talking here, let Steve assume he was talking about the show.
How many times had he implied, without ever saying, that something was wrong with Tony? Steve remembers the impulse to defend him, to argue with Iron Man.
“Don’t know if I’m over or under-dressed,” he admits, gesturing over his tactical suit, startlingly white on crimson red, stars and stripes and heavy-spun, thick spandex. He’s holding the shield in a way that suggests he’s not quite sure what to do with it.
Tony shrugs. He really does have a meeting, but he doesn’t really need Steve to think he’s a good person. It’s absolutely fine if Steve thinks he’s lying. He stands, and feels his head give a lazy, drawn out throb, his vision swimming a little; the combination of his exhaustion and migraine isn’t a pleasant one. “I’ll see you around, Rogers.”
The elevator doors opened. The rest of the Avengers, who’d probably been getting impatient waiting, exploded streamers and tossed handfuls of confetti at them.
He thinks he understands it, then. It wouldn’t make sense for him to have a soulmate; he’s a dead man walking. It wouldn’t have been fair to either of them if there had been someone out there for him. Perhaps the fingerprint on his own thumb, the smudged circle with the stem coming off it,
And then Iron Man leans down and kisses him, and Steve’s brain stops working. His lips are soft. His short stubble scratches lightly against Steve’s chin. Steve feels the kiss in his whole body, electricity traveling down his spine and setting aflame every cell it touches.
“Shit,” Tony breathes out. Steve has taken him all the way down, his nose pressed to Tony’s skin, buried in thick, dark hair. He’s hollowed out his cheeks, sucking the best he can. “You’ve got a second to back off here, or else I’m gonna fuck your mouth.”
At this point, outside of his own body, spread between two consciousnesses and none at all, he doesn’t know anymore. Darkness pulls at him, and he heeds its call.
He and Steve would avoid the conflict of doing each other’s girls, perhaps, and just sit back, shoulder to shoulder, to watch. The electric draw towards Rogers has necessarily faded over time, dulled to a watchful, comfortable sort of interest over the course of their friendship and work life, but imagining him this way is still slightly intoxicating.
It doesn’t stop Steve. The hard lines of his body might as well be steel, as immovable as the frame of the building. It goes straight to Tony’s cock, a throb so sudden it’s a little uncomfortable.
“I’ll strip if you give me my shirt back,” Steve grumbles, making another swipe for it. “And my socks. And—“
He lashes out with his feet, trying to get leverage, trying to hook his ankle on his attackers’ legs, but its fruitless. His migraine seems to push his eyelids down as much as whatever they had injected him with does. It’s probably pathetic, how quickly he passes out. It’s probably like he’s never done drugs before.
Ma’am, where is Dave’s Bagels, he’s not wearing a costume, ma’am, he’s Captain America, and where the fuck is Dave’s bagels—
Tony raises his eyebrows, sweeping his eyes demonstratively over Steve. For some reason, this makes Steve feel self conscious, almost flustered, but he gets the point.
At first, he thinks he’d lost or trashed it, but, finally, he digs it out from the bottom of one of the many random drawers in his desk, flips it open.
For a while, things are quiet and entirely supervillain free. Iron Man saves a few kittens here and there — gotta love the guy — and Tony checks in semi-regularly for training exercises with the Ultimates, but, for the most part, he continues to play out overfamiliar scenes on the grand stage of his life, feeling more like an actor than an active participant.
It happens as a result of the kind of casual cruelty only attributable to children. They’re out at lunch. Steve sits alone; he hasn’t met Arnie yet. Two girls are picking at their baked potatoes a table away. He can only barely hear their voices; it’s only really the sound of his name that catches his attention.
They clear the “invasion” in twenty minutes flat and regroup, standing around to discuss tactics and laugh at Quicksilver for the four times he’d ended up in the nets, unused to the landscape. It’s a shame that all of them miss the little camouflaged centipede bot that crawls out from out of the rocks. It’s a shame that it happens to strike, neatly, right at Steve’s ankle, knocking him down over edge. He’d taken by surprise. He doesn’t start trying to catch himself until it’s too late, and flops, uselessly, into the safety net.
“Don’t make this worse on yourself,” Steve says, low and dangerous. Tony lets up immediately, going limp, but Steve’s grip only tightens, painful now.
He hadn’t told them his name, but they’d all seen him unmasked. He speaks freely of his past, his brothers in battle, his New York, decades gone. He’s lost everything he ever had to hide.
Tony had seen the thing, sitting at the bottom of their closet for the past couple weeks. He leans down and kisses the top of her head. “We can bring it to the memorial,” he suggests, knowing full well this will fix nothing.
He’s not lying. Rogers lifts an eyebrow at him, a multitude of judgements packed into one expression. Tony could peel them away, layer by layer —
Like all of the gay porn he watches, it’s about the vulnerability of the act, the idea of being allowed to do something no one else could. He’d always been the kind of child to run through untouched snow, and so it follows, perfectly naturally, that he wants to take Rogers’s macho straight guy, perfect soldier schtick and ruin it.
Future-Steve picked up his plate, finishing the remaining cake in several big bites. “Oh,” he said, sounding surprised. “’s good.”
Tony stares down, transfixed by the place in Jarvis’s head where his brains are bubbling out. Dark red blood seeps into the cracks between the floorboards, and all Tony can think of are the chances of surviving this sort of injury. He’s had to learn a lot about brains, considering his own condition. He’s read stories about miraculous recoveries, people surviving whole poles being driven through their skulls. He also knows they’re called miracles for a reason.
And, as he’s expected, a little American flag lays folded inside, one inch by three inches of rough, cheap-o fabric on what might as well be a popsicle stick. He pulls it out, free of the folder, and sticks it into the cup on his nightstand.
Tony doesn’t respond for a few beats too long, contemplating it. “It was wrong,” he says, firmly, “you broke through it.”
Steve peeks in, earnest, kind Steve, his face open and easily readable. Tony can see his interest in the new room, his faint excitement.
To Tony’s surprise, Steve and Jan never get back together. The two of them find a common language on the team quickly enough, both willing to put baggage aside for the greater good, but rarely talk in the quiet moments between missions, don’t look at each other in training.
On the Ultimates, he strikes up lazy conversation with the Pyms, both of whom he finds interesting to bounce off in training exercises but mostly boring in life. Nick Fury is funny when he wants to be and a pain in the ass as necessary, a quality Tony can respect without liking.
It’s gone as quickly as it had come, leaving Steve shaky and exhausted. He doesn’t know what just happened; his closest frame of reference is the asthma attacks he used to suffer as a kid, but the pain is new, as it the confusing feeling just before the attack had subsided, the clear understanding that he’d felt electricity rushing through his body.
“Where’re we going?” Tony asks, his voice slurring together. This feels like a dream. Perhaps he’s dead, after all. Unthinking, he leans further into Steve, leans at an awkward, diagonal angle to slot his head into the crook of Steve’s neck, Steve’s chin over the top of his head.
It’s mostly the woman in the red and black outfit talking to him. The man in scarlet with antennae coming off his face puts in a word or two sometimes, words Steve struggles to grasp the enormity of; the future, decades, frozen in the ice, your war. The man dressed in chainmail like a Viking swings his hammer menacingly to and fro in his hand, his large fingers toying with the braided strips of leather on the handle. A strange entity guards the doorway behind him, silent. It’s red and gold, smooth gleaming metal. Steve’s eyes catch on the bright scarlet coat. It reminds him, distantly, of red polished nails on women’s hands. His skin still tingles unpleasantly all over, deep triangulation stabs of main echoing occasionally down his arms. His skin, cold and salty, pinching, feels dry and stripped down from the salt, rigid and entirely separate from the flesh underneath. Even the delicate membranes of his eyes seem as rough as wrinkled tinfoil, sharp at the edges.
And so, as they sit down in the backseat of the car, the two middle seats between them, Tony casually toes off his dress shoes and worms his cold feet under Steve’s big warm thighs.
He stopped, glanced back between the two of them as though taking a second to orient himself, to tell them apart, and turned to Steve.
Tony’s not sure how long it is until he gets there. He feels like his brain is stationed just outside his body, over his forehead, and his body is a heavy, slow thing, holding him down. His bones ache, and he feels his skull, heavy and round, more than any other part of him. He’s noticing specks of dust on the handles of his dresser.
Iron Man spins around to face him, his blue eyes wide. He’s still breathing heavily, and when Steve sets a glove on the suit, he can feel that it’s still red-hot.
Obediently, Steve follows. As the head of his cock hits the back of Steve’s throat, Tony feels him suppress a gag reaction and press forward, further and further. He remembers training, suddenly, the way Steve only needs to be shown once before he can perfectly recreate a move, a pose. Where had he learned this? Army barracks, sneaking around with other soldiers? Brooklyn, or Manhattan, or Christ, Tony should know this, where the the hell he was from, before the war?
to spend time with me. There wasn’t any reason for you to fake that. I don’t know why I thought there was.”
He wasn’t sure what he was about to ask, and he stopped talking when, next to him, Tony started to rise of the couch.
He leaves her sitting in one of the plush, comfortable chairs scattered around the ballroom and crosses the room. Jarvis, already at his side and grumbling about something or other, pours him a gin and tonic.
He didn’t look forty. In fact, it if wasn’t for the bruises on his face and the longer, shaggier hair, he could have easily passed for Steve himself.
But what had he meant, too late? Who has him? Who could he? If he’d only confided in Steve— if had only told him…
Rationally, Tony knows Steve can’t be using everything he’s got, knows Steve’s blows can break steel. This doesn’t stop him from
Hell, he was fairly sure he had gotten through the first half of one before he’d plugged himself in. A cold dread envelops him, leaving him weak and dizzy, his hand sweaty on the pen.
And the entire time, he couldn’t help the awful worry pooling in the pit of his stomach. Something, his gut was telling him, was about to go awfully wrong. Tony was distant, sure, but he’d never been a jerk. For him to leave the party thrown for him early, to barely talk to anyone there, to brush Steve off — well, it all seemed strange.
It’s not a cemetery he visits often. Several fire fighters he’d once worked with are buried here, along with half a dozen men and women he’d known before the ice, soldiers and classmates and schoolteachers. He doesn’t visit any of them in particular.
Steve dashed forward and grabbed for Tony, his fingers closing on his other wrist. The portal, shutting slowly around them, made it impossible to see the other Steve, and he didn’t know if Tony had managed to break away from his grasp. Steve’s only option, here, was to pull on Tony’s hand with all his might.
The back of the chair isn’t low, but Steve’s height is all torso, so Tony has no issues pulling his arms behind his back and binding his wrists together. Steve cants back towards him, towards the touch. His back muscles, strained, make a pretty picture, everything visible under the skin.
Tony helps him out of the car, and Steve doesn’t try to stop him. He hands Tony the key, lets him unlock the door, lets him walk into his Spartan apartment. He’s never bothered to get curtains, and he doesn’t know if Tony’s going to notice this.
“Oh,” he says, considering the description of the dead, frozen man in a dead, frozen world, thumbing his nose at the Heavens, “you’ll hate this one, Cap.”
For a moment, everything was silent. Steve tried to think of explanation, of anything that made sense. A bulletproof vest? Some kind of device?
There’s no one more human than the man in front of him. And this entire time, despite appearances, Steve hadn’t been falling in love with a robot.
Steve catches him one off guard one Friday night. It’s a rare weekend that neither of them have commitments. Tony is on his bed, replying to the emails he knows can’t wait until Monday, and Steve sits stretched out on the floor in front of the bed. He’d been doing push-ups, but, bored, given up somewhere around two hundred.
