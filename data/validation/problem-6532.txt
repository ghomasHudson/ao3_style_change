The colonel thoughtfully tapped a finger on the table as he said, “I’d still prefer to talk to Tony himself, if you don’t mind.”
Ashamed of his waxing poetic and unable to stop the intense feeling, Tony squirmed a little and Steve let go.
"Yes and um." He waved the papers he was holding, "You might wanna take these from me before I decide I've made a terrible mistake. Right now, you looking at me like that? I'm not feeling all that confident in your feelings for me. But it felt like.. You know.. During my heat. It felt.. And I thought, when I woke up and remembered... I thought maybe you.. you know..." he shrugged and trailed off. But Steve's numb fingers were already closing around the papers. Tony let go with a deep breath.
When Tony opened his eyes again it was light outside and Steve was instantly alert. He had fallen asleep curled around the omega but woken up several times to Tony’s shivering until Tony’s body temperature had reached normal levels. Now that the omega was awake, so was Steve and to the alphas surprise, the moment Steve’s eyes opened Tony jerked away from him, frantically trying to rid himself of the tangle of Steve’s limbs and the covers. Steve quietly let him go. Tony stopped before he fell off the bed with some distance between them and pulled the covers up to his chest.
He watched Steve eat it, with a grin on his face. The captain was making all the correct noises and looked happy.
"I'll be right over here, working out for a bit. You can take the blindfold off when you feel ready. I'll be watching you. Alright?"
"Steve.. Steve please.. Oh my god.." Pepper's frantic voice and fluttering hands kept nagging at him, an omega in distress but Steve was too furious to care. All his pent up frustration was pouring out of him and there was nothing either of them could to stop him. Tony belonged to Steve and Steve was intent on making the other alpha understand that fact.
He turned back to see a couple of medical officers trying to pull Tony out of the land rover. They had almost managed it too but Tony was clinging to the top of it and refusing to let go. He was looking at Steve with betrayal in his eyes and Steve couldn’t understand why. Tony never liked medics but this was clearly not the reason of his panick right now.
"I fuck up too Tony. And I know that the casualties stay with you. A person who never makes a mistake is a person who doesn't do anything. Don't you think you deserve to be appreciated for all the good you've done?"
When the spray of water had washed his come down the drain, he had still been imagining the taste of Tony’s come on his tongue, down his throat, the omega would lay there spent, and still look at Steve with want in his eyes.
Then in the field Tony had been brutal and effective. He had covered for Steve as Steve had run in, dispatching the defenses of the Syrian facility. Natasha was in bad shape but Clint had been angry, he had made a pretty good impression of the Hulk, only with arrows, as they made their way out.
The brief explanation of the stock exchange subject is that, in my head, Tony thinks "After this point in my life, I can't not be with Steve. I'll be with Steve anyway, so why not marry him and comply with the conditions of Stane's document. I may as well hand everything over before the board forces my hand. I do love Steve, I can learn to be ok with being an omega and come out this way. Steve had already proven several times over that he is trust worthy, both with my self and my company." And Steve just wants to be with Tony. Marriage just cements his claim over him. If it also helps with Tony's business, keeping his company under his own control, he's willing to help.
He tried to sit up and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, trying to rub out the remaining tears.
The hand on his bottom started to pet in circles that moved lower. Tony merely hummed in appreciation.
"That's 2 swats for cursing." Steve said, and his voice was too many steps away from where Tony wanted it to be.
Another time Clint fell asleep on top of the fridge and Tony saw him and screamed, waking us all up. Everyone ran into the kitchen to see what had happened and we found Tony curled up on the floor and Clint looking startled while clinging to the fridge like his life depended on it, it was hilarious.
I work at a McDonalds and I just took the orders of about half of the Avengers. They were all in full uniform, Captain America is cleaning off his shield the napkins at the food pick up station.
Just to be clear, I wasn’t actually being transphobic, we were having movie night and I burn the popcorn and now he is mad at me. Personally I think @youknowwhoiam is being transphobic for calling me out on twitter for burnt popcorn.
Thanks. Do you have any advice on realizing when people are talking to you or when something is happening that you can’t hear?
I just spent a week on a mission with the Avengers, and I can confirm that they are extremely weird.
Clint regularly turns off his hearing aids during meetings so he doesn’t have to pay attention. He still thinks that nobody knows about it, but we just don’t tell him.
There was a giant that offered to rebuild the wall around Asgard for Freyja’s hand in marriage, we didn’t know that he was a giant at the time, so I convinced Odin to let him help because he would never finish in time, so he would never marry Freyja. He ended up being almost finished before the deadline we gave him, so I was tasked with distracting his horse so it could not pull the stones for him. The horse was not distracted by anything, so I turned into a female horse and seduced him.
He wanted to get across town without getting stuck in traffic so I flew him, but he forget to mention that he is afraid of heights.
Another time Sam was making toast for everyone and he cut it in half diagonally and when he gave a piece to Fury he picked up the plate and throw it like a frisbee, which cracked a window and shattered the plate.
“You’ll see,” Steve said before kissing Tony one last time and turning away. He misses this so much, the time when they were happy and everything was okay.
I need ideas for this fic, so if anyone has any please give them to me. I would love to hear what you want for this and it would be really helpful.
People do that stuff to me all the time, even people who I think I can trust. I have had ‘friends’ before who have seemed nice, but then made some really ableist comment or joke about me being in a wheelchair
It’s great. I’m kind of glad he doesn’t have a knife though, if he did one of us would probably be dead.
Steve hopes that maybe what he said will do something. Maybe they won’t break up, and will be together for the battle against Thanos. Maybe their son won’t get turned to dust. And maybe, just maybe, they both will survive.
And I could occasionally help you steal from the rich by walking on the walls while you guys sneak in?
Last week when Barnes thought he was home alone he asked Jarvis to play disney songs and he sang along while holding Fubar up by his front paws and dancing. Tony had actually been in his lab and when he came up for some food he saw them dancing and took a video of the whole thing and sent it to all of the Avengers. He’s not going to live that one down anytime soon.
That would be fun. I have met a few species that have wings, there are so many things that are different on those planets, less traffic, flight classes in schools, landing spots everywhere.
I was thinking of maybe doing a short Avengers camping au where two of the team members fall in love, but I'm not sure which ones. If you have any suggestions, please tell me. Also this will be completely separate from this story, I just figured that I would mention it on here.
The next week went by extremely fast and extremely slowly at the same time. They watched movies together every night. Peter usually crude himself to sleep before the end of the movie, so Steve would carry Peter up to his room before going to what had once been Tony’s room and crying himself to sleep there. And more often than not Morgan would crawl into Steve’s bed and curl up as smushed against him as she could get as soon as he went to bed.
I’m bi and trans. I didn’t have money to transition, but Mr. Stark gave me the money and helped develop testosterone that will work with my accelerated metabolism because of my powers.
By free he means that he steals it from shield. He doesn’t take much so I’ve given up on trying to stop him
They never let the twins out of there sights since they still lived in the city where they had many enemies. Nick Fury kept trying to call the couple back into the field to help fight. They decided after the twins turn one that at least one of them would go back into the field and the other would stay.
Tony and Steve ran down to the nursery when they arrived it was like an image from Alice in Wonderland. Over a thousand butterflies flew around the room. Violet was asleep with her head in Peter’s lap while Peter was sitting up against the crib sucking his web covered thumb.
“She’ll be fine. Let’s get down to where the medics are.” Tony stated and took a syringe and inserted it into her shoulder. “This will help with the falling, kiddo.”
“My mom taught Bucky and me how to cook when we were five I think. I know it was before we met you.” Steve told him and got up taking his hand.
Steve just held him as the birthday boy cried into his arms. It was true, Steve has gotten bigger. He had gone through training and signed up for some testing that made him buffer. He had become superhuman. He couldn’t tell him that he had to go back to war in a month. They would cross that bridge when they got there. For now, he wanted to celebrate Tony’s birthday.
Tony pointed down the hall and there was the blonde girl they lost two years ago. She was still as frail as ever. Her blonde hair went down to her midback. She looked that she hasn’t had a shower in months. Her dark green jacket and pants that looked too big for her that was being held by a brown belt.
“I know what chair this is. My dad and pops used it on us once they found out we were superheroes.” She smiled at the memory. “In the year 2018, all heroes were summoned by the organization. Everyone got mad about losing their job with S.H.I.E.L.D. and started a riot. Everyone started fighting one another and once things got out of hand so badly someone from the outside started shooting. They shot da-, sorry Tony in the eye and back sending the bullet right through the arc killing him after it hit. Then he shot Steve in the head when he came running over to see Tony. I told Peter to leave with his girlfriend MJ and run. He dropped MJ off at home and got into a fight he wasn’t able to win. Peter lost his arm because I didn’t know how to fight.
“They won’t,” Pepper promised and held the girl on the couch. They were listening to Avatar: The Last Airbender. It was better than the news even though that's what she wanted to watch. She decided Luna didn’t need to see them fighting or possibly dying on TV.
Tony sat there staring at the wall not sure of what to say. He felt that everything in his world would fall to this moment. “I don’t want to force anyone to do anything they don’t want to. Do you want to go?”
“Can I hit you?” Peter asked and shook his head. “I can’t date her. Tony would kill me in my sleep. Steve would just do it while I stood here in front of you. She is really different and that's what I love about her.”
“Guess that is true. Now get inside we need to chat.” Fury walked behind the group making sure no one strayed.
It took a week at Stark Tower for things to go back to ‘normal’ after the Christmas situation. Steve went to Peggy’s funeral and saw many of his older friends from when he was ‘younger’. Tony had Pepper call all of the reporters who had caught the kids using their powers along with everyone who was running a story on the family. He wanted to set things straight. He wanted his kids to be able to go outside without being called nasty words, but most of all he wanted his daughter to come out of her room decides when she ate and used the bathroom.
“Yeah. We can take her back to the tower with us. We have the spare car seat in the back.” Steve smiled and held his arms out.
Steve wrapped an arm around her. He was still sobbing quietly. “It’s okay. We all deal with everything in our own way.”
“Hey, dude!” Sam yelled and got on his feet walking over to the couple with Rhodey and Bucky behind him. “How have you been?”
Tony kissed back and let his hands trace down his lover’s body. “I will see you tonight in my bed just like this. I will help you strip later.” He winked and walked into the board meeting room.
“She didn’t make it, Луна. I’m so sorry. She died.” Natasha whispered and held the girl closer while Bruce gave her a sedative. It was clear to everyone who could see that she had a dent in her head from where she fell.
Steve cleared his throat. “I remember taking the plane down into the water. Where is my family? I need to see her. She’s probably scared of being alone. I promised I was gonna come back. I didn’t come back.”
“Let me have a look,” Bruce told him and walked back over looking at her head. “Well, it looks like they operated on her brain. I need scans for more detail, but I am gonna need her sedated. I won’t do that though until we figure out where her mindset is.”
A little boy walked over to the men as they walked out of the bar. “Excuse me!” He yelled and pulled on Tony’s pants. “Are you Tony Stark?”
Luna held her arms and walked back to where he told them to go. She shook worst than when she was cold. Her fathers were going to be disappointed in her. Ron and Ginny ran into their parent's arms smiling. Neville went to his grandmother stood to wait for him. Hermione’s parents held her close looking her up and down making sure she was alright.
“Just pick it up.” Tony hissed at Steve while other passengers glared over at them. Peter and Violet were to caught up in the performance to even hear the phone.
“Dr Banner is coming to SHIELD R&D? I thought he had his own lab.. somewhere else.” He finished lamely and looked at Tony as Tony kept standing in front of his desk, instead of going to kneel next to Steve’s chair as he had been getting used to do.
"No, really, go ahead, let's get this over with. Fury obviously sent you around to tell me the collar isn't really that bad, and you are a dom and you wore the collar so I should totally be able to, since, you know, I'm a sub. And look how well you turned out, so be more like me Stark. Am I spot on or what?" Tony crossed his arms, even knowing how helplessly defensive a move it was but unable to help himself.
When they reached the Turkish border at dawn, Coulson and several teams were already waiting for them. Tony had almost fallen asleep a couple of times, Steve had tried to talk to him to keep him awake. Tony had stayed almost eerily quiet, simply listening. Steve had wrapped Tony in a dirty and coarse blanket he had found in the back, all the while Tony had sat in silence and let himself be taken care of. For which Steve didn’t know if he was grateful or horrified. The Tony he knew would have put up a fuss, loudly, and obnoxiously.  But this Tony had just mostly sat there, and let Steve handle him.
Once again, he didn't need to think, he didn't have the power the move things in one direction or the other. He just had to... be. Exist. As a set of body parts, that Steve seemed to enjoy looking at.
"Actually no. I wanted you naked. The shirt and the shorts were just for the trip downstairs. Don't want to scandalise Mrs Gernstein." The dom turned around and started wounding the rope around his fist. Steve was wearing one of those painted on white t-shirts and a light grey pair of butt hugging sweatpants. He looked so put together, Tony felt extra awkward with his shorts around his ankles.
Steve's voice was gentle and while Tony's own face was pressed into the doms impressive pecs he could still hear the teasing smile in his deep voice.
And this time it didn't occur to Tony to be bothered by having to ask permission to use some pen and paper. It just felt nice.
“I wanted to talk to you about Tony.” Steve started and an interested glint appeared in Coulson’s eyes. The man subtly leaned forward as if he was expecting some juicy gossip. Steve knew the exceptionally sharp agent had been suspecting something since the day at the Turkish border but if he expected Steve to give Tony up, he’d be disappointed.
"Clint left?" the dom asked pointlessly because Tony was pretty sure he'd just heard everything that went on in the apartment.
"Good." The Captain marched Tony back into the living room, but when Tony went to kneel on what he was starting to think of as 'his spot', he was marched right past it. When the Captain let go of his arm he found himself facing the wall next to the fireplace.
“What?” Steve understood the gist of the document but had trouble processing it. Pepper explained with a displeased huff.
Since I've been getting comments about how the situation here might be dubcon, and how some readers are worried that Tony might change as a result of Steve's treatment of him, I want to put a disclaimer here that applies to both this chapter and the coming chapters.
It was driving Tony crazy, being played with like this, unable to reciprocate or even participate really. Just prone and at the mercy of.. Steve Rogers. This was fine. He wanted Steve to take him, own him, break him apart.
He took a step toward the alpha and finally pulled out the tiny box he had been fiddling with in his pocket. Then he knelt on one knee and held the box out, opening it with slightly trembling fingers to reveal the smooth gold ring he had bought. He had been in a hurry when he'd bought it half an hour ago, and he wasn't sure if it would fit. And he didn't know what he would do if Steve refused him but jumping in with both feet... It was the Tony Stark way. He would deal with what came after.
Tony, Steve, Loki, Wanda, Clint, Natasha, and Fury. And it is the one that is a few blocks from the tower.
I don't think your seeing the point. She is not normal, she can't walk. You're not normal either, you are just as weak as she is.
Why do you still have a twitter? You are an awful person. Ad just because someone has a disability doesn't mean that they aren't 'normal', normal is just a standard made up by people so they could discriminate against other people.
I don’t need his mix of pop tarts and Asgardian coins that he calls money, just tell him that I’m sorry and that Hulk probably loves him too.
A warning would have been nice. It’s kind of confusing seeing yourself in a movie, especially when you don’t remember the last 70 years of your life.
It’s pretty easy to get people to do stuff when you look like the famous Captain America. I just walked into a school and said I wanted to help the kids. They had an idea an I went along with it.
I just saw @hawkeye do a backflip onto a railing, then do a triple flip into the pool. It was amazing.
“Probably the alcohol,” answered Steve. He pulled Tony in for another kiss, savoring it this time. “I love you so much, and I will never stop loving you.”
I’m gay. I grew up in a time where that wasn’t accepted, but it has gotten better, even though it has been such a short time.
Everyone showed up to the funeral. It was at the lake by the cabin. They floated the first arc reactor that Tony made out into the lake on a bed of flowers.
But one of you is a superhero and the other is a god, I’m talking about a world where everyone has wings.
I say happy holidays because not everyone celebrates Christmas, there is more than one religion in the world.
Some homophobic guy tried to get me to take his side in an argument he was having with a guy wearing a rainbow flag pin. He said that I was from the 30s so I would understand why it was wrong to be gay, and he refused to believe me when I said that I didn’t care about someones sexuality. Why should it matter who someone loves, they’re not hurting anyone.
When they got there Steve put Tony in the nicest suit his closet. They would have a small burial with Steve, Pepper, Morgan, Rhodey, and Peter. The larger funeral would be in a few days.
“I know Pete, but everything’s going to be okay, eventually.” He pulled Peter closer and pulled Morgan onto his lap. All they had right now was each other, and Steve never wanted to let go of either child ever again.
Because he just woke me up by hitting me on the head with his food bowl. It’s not like Bucky, his owner, was just on the other side of the bed or anything.
I am bisexual, and married to the best man to ever exist, and trans. I started my transition when I was 17, sadly transitioning did not completely erase my dysphoria, but it help so much and my life is so much better now that I can be my true self.
Look, he says that he is sorry and that he will pay you for it if you take back what you said earlier.
You are the one who need who to be educated. Talk to any scientist for, like, five minutes, it will help. In the meantime, please never talk to anyone again until you have gotten a basic education.
Because it has gaurds, running up to it unprepared would be stupid. If you really want to go there you should have asked me, I own it.
Fuck ableist people. I’m lucky that almost no one says anything to me in public because I’m an avenger, but I had to chase off some jerks who were making fun of a girl in a wheelchair earlier today.
Why do you keep responding to our tweets with stupid comments. See the other person was nice and asked a question because they didn’t know, you just say things to be annoying.
What if all the avengers were Lgbt, wouldn’t that be cool, it would be great if there were superheros I could relate to.
We should take action because it does exist and is a serious problem. How can people still believe this.
I’m glad that you’re optimistic about it, stay that way. This will be a lot easier to get through if you are optimistic.
I have a program on my phone that reads things out to me, so I don’t actually have to be able to see to know what you are saying.
I said I was sorry, but at least I haven’t tried to cook anything with lightning. Tony, Steve, Thor, and Bucky all tried to make pie with lightning last week.
The Avengers came into McDonalds during my shift, ordered from me, and now the Black Widow is responding to my tweets. This might be the best day of my life.
This isn't an actual update, but I just wanted to say that I will not be posting updates for this story as often anymore. I am working on a few others, so updates will be farther apart. I have been working on the camping au, which is focused on stony, and the first chapter should be out soonish. There are a few others that I am working on, but am not sure when they will be posted.
After him and Tony broke up he didn’t see Peter much, with him being on the run and all. And during the five years after the snap he only saw Morgan once.
You’re not wrong, but it is still hilarious to see an extremely fluffy, 50 pound dog sitting on your shoulders.
Steve and Bucky have been making old man jokes all week and they won’t stop. Somebody please help me.
If any of the Avengers see this, I know it is a bit early, but what are you guys going to do for you Halloween costumes?
I heard Tony coming up from his lab and I decided to scare him, so I snuck into his bathroom before he got there and sat on the counter. When he turned on the lights he screamed and tried to punch me. His screaming woke up Steve who tried to get up to see what was happening, but ended up getting tangled in the blankets and face planted before he could reach the bathroom.
Racists need to fuck off. They should all go live in a cave somewhere, where they don’t have contact with the outside world.
Steve woke up the next morning still on the couch with Morgan curled up on his chest and Peter leaning against him.
Happy Father’s Day @iamking, I’m still not sure how I convinced you to adopt a cat, but he thinks that you are a great dad.
Don’t let anyone tell you your identity isn’t valid, it is your identity not theirs, their opinion doesn’t matter.
@butterknives I was hoping that you could give me some advice. Someone who I thought was my friend just laughed at me when I told him that I PTSD and said that I couldn’t have it because I wasn’t in a war. Was he right, am I faking it?
Yes. Also I came out from behind the couch. Narfi actually seems nice. Also ice cream with the cake would be appreciated.
They are complaining about people petting their dogs that they say they “need” for their “disabilities”, I’ve pet plenty of service dogs without the owner's permission and everyone was fine. How are you supposed to know that you aren’t supposed to pet the dog anyway, it’s a dog, people should be allowed to pet it.
I feel like this would have surprised me a month ago, but now I expect it. I swear the avengers are the weirdest people to exist.
Well, I guess at least we know that if both of them try to summon the hammer at the same time that it will do nothing.
Well then. I’m never going to leave my house again. Good bye everyone. Harley can be the new spiderman, because he apparently looks more like me than I do.
I’m sorry that happened to you. Being deaf is kind of hard to deal with at first, but it get easier with time. When I first lost my hearing I refused to talk to anyone and I would ignore them when they tried to sign to me. Don’t do that. Find people who will help you get through it and learn how to read lips and sign as soon as you can, but in the meantime just ask people to write things down.
No, its not. I think I can speak for all of the Avengers when I say this, if you are homophobic, transphobic, racist, abilist, or discriminate against people for any reason, unfollow all of us.
We are also hiring mostly LGBTQ+ people to work there so it will be a safer and more understanding environment for those seeking help.
You are the entitles jerk who thinks he can risk other people's safety just because he thinks a dog is cute. And I can and will file a lawsuit against you for intentionally interfering with a service dogs work.
Steve leaned in to kiss him one more time before the light of the arc reactor flickered out. Tony was dead. He had saved the world but he was dead.
Yeah, he does. He got us both kicked out one time, of a movie that we both really wanted to see and had waited for two years for it to come out, because when the identity of the villain was reveal he screamed “I knew it” while shaking me back and forth. Tony ended up getting us the movie before it was being sold because he got annoyed with us constantly talking about missing the ending.
How does it not say anything, I can think of multiple times that I haven’t had my hearing aids and was having a conversation in sign language in public, it seems impossible that people didn’t notice that one of the avengers was deaf. They would either have to be really oblivious or don’t want to accept that a superhero can be disabled.
I’m so sorry that that happened to you. Those guys were jerks, they needed to be punched in the face.
Only half. The kitchen not being on fire would have been better. Also for anyone who wants to know, I asked her to make ramen, and the kitchen ended up being on fire.
I’m bisexual. The country where I used to live was not very accepting, but now I am able to be who I am and love who I love.
This month the Avengers will be setting up 300 free mental health treatment centers all over the country for anyone who can’t afford or doesn’t have access to treatment.
Sorry for not updating in forever. If you have anything you would like to see please tell me your ideas.
Tony smiled up at him, “Love you too, take care of the kids,” his words were laced pain and longing.
I’m trans. I have had people question my ability to run a company because of who I am, but I never let that get to me. I am just who I want to be and that doesn’t affect my ability to do anything.
@youknowwhoiam @captainamerica @metalarmman @hawkeye @birdman @blackwidow @brucebanner @godofthunder @butterknives @scarletwitch @ppotts @captainmarvel
I am so sorry you had to go through that, people are awful. After a mission once a reporter completely ignored me, saying that I wasn’t an important Avenger even though I saved over a hundred people that were trapped by terrorists that day. The reporter also ignored Fury and Rhodey.
It sucks, but it is just a part of life. People need to get better, but that obviously isn’t going to be happening anytime soon, so I guess people like us have to deal with us.
One time Clint and Coulson were out getting coffee for the team a lady asked him if he wanted to go on a date with her, and instead of politely telling her that he was aromantic and wasn’t interested he took out his hearing aids, threw them at Coulson, and ran out of the coffee shop shouting that he couldn’t hear her, leaving Coulson to deal with the woman and all of the coffee.
Whatever you say. Well that is all the stories for now, there will definitely be some later, but I don’t want to get killed in my sleep so, better not annoy them too much.
@mylawn stop harassing people, they are just trying to have a conversation. Your input is not needed.
You’re fine. When I first lost my hearing I was a kid and wasn’t able to get hearing aids because I ran away and didn’t have any money. I do have them now though, Tony made me a pair when I joined the avengers.
At least you didn’t have to watch her eat all of them, she only let me have three before eating each of the rest by stuffing the entire pancake in her mouth.
You are going to hell, God doesn’t make mistakes, he gave you the body that you were supposed to have.
Everyone is pretty bad, but him and Steve are the worst. Steve accidentally locked their bedroom last week and forgot the code, so Jarvis wouldn’t let them back in. I found them asleep on the couch.
She got up and asked me for a marker, then pulled a photo of herself out of her wallet and signed it, then gave it to me. I’m getting it framed. This is the best day of my life.
They were walking on the side of the lake when Steve got down on one knee and pulled out a ring. Tony started crying and said yes, then Steve picked him up and spun him around. They both looked so happy, its was adorable.
Remember that no matter what, someone out there will always support and love you, even if you haven’t met them yet.
Was no one going to tell me about Sebastian Stan. I mean the guy looks just like me and not one person thought to mention it.
The tesseract went smoothly too, but he stopped to get some extra Pym particles on the way out. He had one more stop to make.
I’m aromantic. I’ve had people tell me that I have to have romantic feelings for people or that I don’t belong, but those things aren’t true. Don’t let people who won’t accept you have an affect on you life, they don’t matter, you do.
The United States is not an exclusively christian country. People can celebrate whatever holiday they want, or choose not to celebrate at all.
Happy Pride Month everyone! This month we will be holding fundraisers for Lgbt organizations that are dedicated to helping people who need it, more information about this will be on the avengers website. We will also be telling everyone our identities. None of the Lgbt Avengers are at all secretive about their identities, but the media seems to be insistent on ignoring any aspect of us that does not fit their definition of “normal”.
I am Pansexual. I also struggled with growing up in a time where liking another man was seen as something that went against human nature. Some people still believe that, but it is getting better and we need to keep working towards a better world.
One time I heard Tony shout ‘fucking horse’ at about 3 a.m., apparently Sleipner had stepped on his foot. It was pretty hilarious.
After the ceremony they played the message that Tony had left and for the first time Steve realized that he was on his own now. He had two kids to take care of, and if he was being honest, he had no idea what to do.
I am a gay trans man. I did not start transitioning until my late twenties, when I had moved out of my parents house because they were extremely transphobic. But now I have supportive friends, many that are like family to me, and an amazing boyfriend.
I do have some good stories, but the person to ask is @catstolemyeye, his job is knowing things about them that other people don’t.
I am pansexual. Most Asgardians are fairly accepting, but my father would pretend that me and my brother were “normal” and lock us in our rooms if we tried to say otherwise.
I don’t know, but I think it's hilarious watching the homophobes and transphobes of twitter try to explain how spiderman’s tweet was a joke
To anyone suffering with a mental illness, you will be okay. It may seem hard at the moment, but you can do this, you can get through it, things will eventually get better.
Don’t worry about it, I get how it could be confusing. And if hearing aids are an option for you, I could probably get Tony to make you some.
He found Tony talking to some random person that he didn’t know. When he saw Steve come over he broke away from the conversation and  started walking over to him.
Thank you so much for responding. It made me feel a lot better, but sometimes I still feel like I can’t be useful because of my mental illness.
Turn on the flash for when you get notifications on your phone, that will be extremely helpful. Get hearing aids if you can, if you can’t that’s okay, but they are very helpful. Some people get service dogs to alert them, but they take a lot of money and time to train, so that may not be the best option for you. If you are with a friend, have them tap you on the shoulder or something to alert you.
Maybe you guys are related somehow. You should try and meet him, and maybe bring me so I can get a picture with him.
I don’t mean to be offensive, but how would you know what it’s like to not be able to listen to music for a long period of time, don’t you have hearing aids.
Steve arrived at the party the night that Ultron attacked. This was right before everything started going down hill.
You’re fine, but everyone else… Tony literally designed the tower and he got lost trying to find the kitchen.
Even if you can’t do anything big, you can still do something. Recycle, don’t litter, don’t use plastic straws, use more energy efficient products, support green companies, don’t buy from companies that have no regard for the environment, wright to your state representative. All action against climate change helps.
I also woke up one night and saw Clint hanging upside down out of a ceiling vent, wrestling with my cape. Steve and Tony are also really loud go fish players. I am never playing cards with them again, they were both screaming.
I thought you guys were somewhat normal, excluding the power and that stuff, but I am slowly beginning to realize that I am wrong.
Oh gods, Peter. That’s one of my sons, Narfi. He wasn’t supposed to be here until tomorrow. I guess he thought it would be funny to scare you. I mean, it was probably hilarious, but I wouldn’t do that to you, Clint or Tony maybe, I would have had you help me with the prank. He does take after his father though.
The battle was over. They had won. Steve looked around in amazement as the enemy turned to dust and blew away in the wind.
Natasha and Clint came in and, I don’t even know why, played golf. They just played golf. Neither of them even know how to play golf. They hit everything in the room at least twice and never got the ball in the cup that they used at the hole once. Then they left and Clint left his arrows there.
I am asexual and gay. In the red room they tried to make me straight. It was an awful experience that I hope no one ever has to go through, but people still do. I set up a fund against conversion therapy, the link to it is on the Avengers website.
I am genderfluid and pansexual. I love who I am, but sometimes doubt my identity or feel wrong because of it. This isn’t because my identity isn’t valid, but because of societal standards that do not include who I am. There is nothing wrong with me, and there is nothing wrong with who you are, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
Yeah, but I was the one who convinced everyone. He mentioned it at a team meeting a few months ago and no one listened.
For your information I like his over protectiveness, and I’m pretty sure you would murder someone if they scared Wanda.
Happy winter holidays everyone! I hope that everybody celebrating is having a wonderful time doing that. If you aren’t celebrating I hope that you're having a good winter.
Of course, you seem like a good person who needs help, and that’s what the Avengers do, help people. I’ll DM you some more of the details so we won’t get swarmed with people if we meet up somewhere.
Congrats, Mr. Stark. I’m so glad Steve finally asked, he had been freaking out about it for a few months, he thought that you were going to say no.
That night the three sat in silence in the living room. That had planned on watching a movie, but it never happened.
That is not true at all. I have PTSD from being mind controlled by Thanos and I still help the avengers save the world all the time, sometimes it is hard but I have friends who are always there to support me and help me feel better. Many of the other avengers have mental illnesses too. Don’t let yours define you, find friends who will support you no matter what and remember that you can do anything.
No, you are wrong for saying that people should only celebrate Christmas. Many of my friends celebrate Christmas, but others celebrate other holidays and I wanted to include them.
It is kind of weird, but the weirdness fades with time and you get used to it. Also, not the most helpful piece advice, but you should still have it, watch shows with subtitles on, Don’t miss out on something you wanted to watch because you can hear it. It won’t be the same, but at least it’s something.
Everyone has weird things, but what about the avengers. We know that Nick Fury hates diagonally cut toast and that Bucky is afraid of heights, but what about the others.
I’m bi. There have been struggles, but I have had a relatively easy time, and I hope that everyone can have that, and one day everyone will, but we will have to work for it.
It’s fine. And I might be stuck in the vents, Clint gave me a map, but my arm got stuck and I can’t move
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you about him. If it makes you feel better I’ll let you ride him wherever you want to go.
Tony smiled impishly then sucked as much of Steve as he could into his mouth. The alphas eyes closed and he threw his head back at the same time as his fingers found their way into Tony's hair.
“Captain. I think there’s not much you can do here. And now you’ve had your explanation. I also think you know where the door is?” Pepper asked him with a fake smile. She was usually sharp and a bit scary but not to this degree. Steve could see she was clearly on edge, worried and was lashing out.
Tony had wanted Steve to bite him so badly, leave marks, make Tony feel that he was owned through delicious pain, he could feel his skin prickle even at the thought of it. But Steve had been gentle. He had left the tiniest marks on places that no one would see, while Tony writhed under him, not daring to beg for more when Steve had barely agreed to even touch him.
“Where is Tony? Pepper called me with some worrying news, I know I’m late but I came as soon as I could. ” The Colonel said, instead of sitting, he came to a stop at a sort of relaxed parade rest, looking Steve up and down.
Tony did that easily, searching with his foot, he found Steve was right, the mat was right in front of him and it was 4 steps length. He stopped.
"Yes! Yes I need help! Look, let me go pee then I swear I'll hold the fu-fancy pennies against the wall till morning if you want me to!"
At the border, he hadn’t known where he was or why was there. He hadn’t known even during the ride to the border. But he had trusted, he had remembered Steve and thinking he was with his alpha, he had blindly trusted Steve. He had been scared and in shock, for sure, but Tony, for some reason, had thought his alpha was with him, so it would be alright. He had trusted Steve to take care of him and then Steve had dumped Tony onto SHIELD, strangers to Tony’s eyes, going his own merry way. Tony had been unable to understand why.
It went on like that for a while, Steve taking breakes from feeding Tony, to eat himself, and Tony felt himself relax further. He leaned in to Steve’s leg and even ate the broccoli without complaint. Distantly he recognized that he didn’t like the taste but he couldn’t be bothered to worry about it, Steve wanted him to eat his veggies so he would. It was simple as that.
“He was taking a cold shower for the last half hour. I shut off the cold water when my sensors detected his body heat going down below healthy levels. But he is still in there. He has been unresponsive to my warnings sir. I thought-”
On the morning of the sixth day, Steve woke up to an empty bed. Having run through the house looking for him, he found no sign of Tony except the dissipating scent of his heat. Tony was gone and all Jarvis had to say on the subject was “Mr Stark has left the building. He requested that I give you no further information on his whereabouts.”
“It’s too soon.” Tony paled further. What was he going to do? Should he call for Steve? It would be the logical thing to do but the captain had already refused Tony several times, calling for Steve now would amount to forcing the captain and even Tony wouldn’t go so low, guilting and scenting the alpha into fucking him would be disgusting, not to mention destructive to their relationship. But what else could he do? How did he used to get over his heats? Maybe he should try calling the Colonel.
“I can’t!” Pepper almost shouted in response. “No one can know! Ok? No one! Not the doctors, not SHIELD! Not even you!”
He had brought Tony to the HQ too soon, and if they were going to do this, they would need time alone.  Considering the spaced out and entirely too relaxed state Tony was in as they left Steve’s office, Steve decided it’d be best to take Tony home early today.
After a while of listening to Steve fiddle with cartons and paper bags above his head, he caught himself thinking about dumplings and nothing else. He had seen some interesting and even amazing stuff in the R&D but kneeling here, with Steve’s solid presence, almost radiating heat, smelling like reassurance and delicious food, it all seemed irrelevant. He found that, once more, he could let go.
And then Tony was left standing there, looking down at a few screws, a pack of gum and a crumpled suit. "At least he did give me back the prototype." He thought. It could've been worse.
Tony remained frozen for several seconds, feeling like a fish out of water, mouth gaping and one hand still plastered to the glass where Steve's come was languidly dripping down. Then in a daze, knee-walked back to the bathmat to sit back on his thighs, hands now limp in his lap. His cock throbbed, his mouth was dry and he was so horny he was sure if the cage had allowed he could have cut diamonds.
So this chapter is mostly an explanation on why Tony did what he did. Brief explanation in the end if I didn't manage to pull it off in the story.
“Hey. What are you doing?” Steve smiled back and dodged a metallic arm as Dumm-E came at him, seemingly with the sole intention of knocking the pizza onto the floor.
"We'll see." Steve said then he tipped his head back, letting soapy water wash over down his chest and cock, as he started to pull on his cock. Now he was fully erect and Tony was very impressed.
“Yes.” Pepper looked at Tony, his expression suspicious. She was clearly trying to understand. Steve wondered what had Tony said to Pepper while he was outside.
"I woke up this morning to.. It wasn't easy for a moment... Realising that I had been fucking Captain boy scout all through my heat.. The guy my father spent his life searching for.. The epitome of everything wholesome and good and American that I could never hope to match."
To Tony's great delight, Steve's ears turned a bit pink, and the sweatpants weren't really designed to hide his interest. But the doms expression didn't change.
That gave Steve a pause. “Fury doesn’t know?” He asked in a more subdued voice. He had assumed SHIELD had known but simply kept the information out of the files for their own reasons.
I apologise for taking down chapter 14. Thats why you dont post without writing the whole thing *facepalm*. This is embarrasing. It ll be back soon after remodeling and surgery.
Then Tony turned to place a kiss to Steve’s palm and Steve felt his heart stutter. The mere fact that Tony accepted praise from him, valued it even, hit Steve hard for a moment. It was the kind of thing that would trick Steve’s hind brain that, this beautiful man right here was his omega, more forcefully than the fact that Tony was kneeling for him. It truly made Steve feel like he owned a part of Tony. He had to remember he didn’t.
“No. Just the.. I don’t remember what happened next. The memory is like.. It’s like I remember dying.” Tony said the last sentence in a whisper barely loud enough for Steve to hear.
Steve went  around him and proceeded to tie the cloth around Tony's eyes, checking to make sure he couldn't see out of the bottoms or the corners or anything.
"Tony." The dominant spoke, and Tony thought he recognized the voice. It was a very very familiar voice.
There was a moment of silence in which Steve felt Tony shiver and he knew it had nothing to do with the memory of the cold from the previous night. Then finally the omega went lax in his grip and bent his head to the side, exposing his throat and the very faint mark Steve had left there.
If he called Rhodey, Rhodey would understand. He could call him, Rhodey would be annoyed of course, he was probably very busy. But he was also the only alpha he could drop his guard with. If only a little. Tony could tell him what happened. In fact he should tell Rhodey what happened, the colonel needed to know who was privy to the information that Tony was an omega. But after that, Rhodey would ask him if he was ok in that deep, calm voice. He would care. He would tell Tony that it would be alright. He would tell Tony that he’s going to talk to Steve if needed, that he was there for Tony. You’re alright. You’re fine. Everything is fine.
Steve sat up but let Tony keep the covers. He could smell the fresh scent of Tony’s heat that had started to fill the room a while ago but it was nowhere near as intense as it had been the previous night. And since what he had seen in the bathroom, he couldn’t think of sex right now, nudity wasn’t an issue.
But before he could get the words out gunfire ripped through the kitchen, assault rifle bullets destroying everything in an ear-splitting rain of fire.
"Hold up." The captain came around, picked a shirt up off Tony's arm and studied it with a critical eye. Tony squirmed, intensely aware of what a sloppy job he'd done. He started listing excuses in his head, ranging from, 'This is my first time ironing, cut me some slack' to, 'The cock cage is pinching, are you sure it's supposed to be on for this long, I can't concentrate on anything.'
"Yeah? Don't get used to it, I'm sure I'll fuck up soon." Tony answered lightly over his shoulder. His hands deep in soapy water. Then he startled when he felt big, warm hands on his waist.
Tony sat there for a moment, feeling like there were ants under his skin.Then he reached again for the tablet, and started to erase all evidence of himself viewing the video. Access logs and history caches…
"Tony. You are my submissive now. My responsbility. Mine." The way he said the last word almost scared Tony, intense and decisive. "Don't be late."
"Would you beg to suck my cock?" Steve asked with a smile, and even that looked obscene when his lips were all wet and red under the water, pulled into a confident half smile that made Tony ache.
But... He didn't want to piss Steve off either, so he started counting with his eyes closed. He could be patient. He could wait for the other man's pleasure. He should. He was the sub.
Steve tried not to grimace at how pre-amnesia-Tony would hate himself for saying something like that. But he didn’t interrupt.
“But Stane persevered. He had been so sure Tony would turn out to be an omega. He always waited for his chance to prove it. And when he couldn’t…”
Just within the span of a day, he'd already started thinking of Steve as his 'dom', even if he still had the occasional weird moment about the whole thing. This was one of those moments but it was much easier to get naked for his dom than it was to get naked for Captain America.
“Yeah, no. Sorry.” He shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal to him but now Steve could tell that it really bothered Tony to disappoint people like this.
"I will expect physical and domestic service from you. It's both for your training and peace of mind. You will be doing the cooking, cleaning, laundry and ironing in this house. You will not only provide sexual service but also serve as my valet and butler."
“You just said he locked himself in the bathroom, under cold water to get away from you and his heat. And you’re in bed with him right now. You also just said you haven’t spoken to him in between these two events.”
Tony was an alpha. Alpha’s didn’t go into heat. Tony smelled like an omega. And he was clearly in heat.
Tony looked at him, brows knit in a frown, lips pursed. Hating to admit how right Steve was. Thankfully the Captain didn't press him to answer.
When the balding senior agent had caught him and started to yell at him though… He wasn’t as practiced at pretending to be an alpha to deal with an angry alpha who seemed to outrank him. He hadn’t known the agent couldn’t outrank him until after Steve had saved his ass. He also hadn’t been as practiced in dealing with it as an omega either. He was somewhere in between, alone, unsure of his place, unable to hold on to one side or the other. He had tried to channel Pepper, the way she had glared down Steve… But in this foreign situation it had seemed impossible. Pepper knew who she was, where she stood, what she was capable of and what other people could do. Tony didn’t know any of it, he had relied on Steve. And Steve had been absent. As much as he wished for Steve at that moment, the second his wish had come true, it had hit Tony that, Steve had once more caught him in the act of breaking Steve’s order about not seeking out information.
With nothing else to do, he had gone back to his apartment to shower and change, get the blood and dust off of himself. Then he had dodged Coulson’s attempts at getting a report on what had happened. What would Steve say if Coulson asked about Tony’s very out of character, very non-alpha behavior? He felt guilty too. He should have kept an eye out, watched Tony’s back and he hadn’t. He had known Clint was too distracted, he himself should have taken over but, none of them had seen the missile.
Steve pointed to the other side of the garden with the hand still holding Tony's drink, where Coulson was standing next to the buffet, with one Clint Barton eating the finger food Coulson was holding out to him.
“Alright, then at least let the doctors of the SHIELD infirmary take a look at him!” Steve raised his voice without meaning to.
“The doctors say they wanted to keep an eye on you for a while longer. They want to keep you for 24 hours.” She looked at her watch, “Well half of that has passed. I’m sure they’ll let you come home soon.”
“Why wouldn’t you? You don’t owe me anything. You were just being nice this whole damn time.” Tony answered but it came out resigned.
"Alright ok alright!" Tony yelled when the cold water hit his thighs, his back was flush to the shower wall, he had no where to go, "Just can you do it slow at least!?"
"And I'd say you need peoples noses in your business. I am telling this to you as a friend man. Nothing else. I sure as hell am not gonna look down on you because you submit. No one will. Clearly it was a mistake on my part to barge in on your shit. I shoulda just dropped off the bags and left. But I did want to tell you that the collar can actually help you. I hope you'll see that at some point."
That night Steve spent in Tony's bed. After five days of heat Tony was a little sore but touching Steve now, with all their history put into perspective, felt different. Exhilarating in an entirely foreign way. Like he was touching Steve for the first time, yet he knew his alphas body very well.
When Steve moved off the bed, the side of Tony's face was pressed into the bed, allowing him to look around if he wanted to but, Tony didn't feel like it. What did it matter? He was here, he was safe and he was not alone.
“Good?” Steve asked and Tony nodded. This was kind of nice. Actually, more than a little nice. It felt foreign too, not familiar like some things did, even through the amnesia. No one had hand fed him before, apparently. Tony decided he liked it, despite the indignity. Even that, he didn’t mind much when it was Steve feeding him. There was something that felt inherently right in the action, the alpha provider, providing for his omega…
Steve nodded then. Again, several options crowding into his brain, to avoid signing the vouchers. But they were right. As long as Stane's document existed Tony's property would be in danger. If they got married.. No, WHEN they got married, Steve thought a little giddily, if Tony ever wanted to declare the document null, the board would once more push Tony into signing his shares over to Steve. This way, it'd be on Tony's terms. Then he could sign them back over toTony.
"Tony. I only asked you to put the boxes in recycling. I didn't ask you to revolutionize the recycling system."
“Mm-hmm.” Steve nodded and flipped another page. They’d had that talk a million times already. “Not even that glorified.”
Steve's hand was now petting the length of his back, his hair, and wiping his tears but he didn't want to move.
Tony agreed. He did feel calm, everything was clear cut and obvious. He didn't really know why he'd struggled so much in the beginning. This felt really nice.
"You're a mean bas-" Tony started and Steve cocked an eyebrow, "basket." Tony ended his sentence and Steve chuckled,
"Here. As promised." he said, and Tony nodded in thanks, "I have some work to do. On the computer. You can stay in your room and have some free time until lunch. If you want you can join me in the living room."
Tony stuck his hands in his pockets and shrugged. He was fidgeting with something in his pocket but clearly he wasn't done talking.
“These suits are highly weaponized.” He reminded the other man, because of course by now, Tony knew. ”And you are not really ready for a test run. You gave Colonel Rhodes month long training before you let him touch one. And he already has military training. I’m not letting you try to fly after skimming through files for a couple of days.”
Tony stayed, except for turning his neck to watch Steve putter about gathering stuff. First the Captain rooted around in the bowl where he tossed his change, then kicked the rug aside, making Tony stand barefeet on the stone floor. At least he was close to the fireplace, which made the floor quite nicely warm.
The mocking smiled disappeared at that, Tony looked down at his hands, then back up at the other man.
"In my closet. You can go into my room." Steve answered poking his head around the hallway to answer. Then,
I'm so sorry if you've already read this. I've added some scenes. I hope even if you've read this before, it won't disrupt the flow of the story. I usually plan out my chapters before writing and always have a few chapters ahead already written before posting. Apparently it's not enough caution, I hope it wont happen again.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief, because Tony hadn’t sounded scared or intimidated. He was impressed and intrigued.
“Tony, this Colonel James Rhodes. Remember I told you about him before? He’s a friend of yours.” Steve told him and Tony nodded.
Tony preened under the praise. Once he'd realized he could just use the oven with it's very clearly set temperature and time limits, following a recipe had become very easy.
“Thanks. I’d appreciate that.” Steve moved to get up, but Coulson spoke again, still not looking at Steve and sounding very casual, despite his words;
Thank you all for your patience. Here's a longish chapter after a bit of wait. And I'm sad to say I won't be able to post a chapter a week as I've tried to do previously. I knew I wouldn't be able to stick to the schedule as real life intrudes. I don't plan to abandon this because it's my happy place but it looks like it's gonna get harder and harder for me to get there for a while. I hope you'll all enjoy a little guest appearance.
Tony didn't look up once while the captain carried him to his room, laid Tony down in his bed. When the dom let Tony go, he finally opened his eyes. And realised he was not in his own room but he was in Steve's room.
But Steve was already out of the room, in his tighty whities and nothing else, he ran through the corridor bare foot.
The first hit was completely unexpected. One minute the captain had been gently petting him, second searing heat blazed through Tony's butt.
Which was easier said than done. Tony was locked up in his bedroom now but his distinct scent lingered in every corner of the top floors that he used as his home. And not the expensive cologne but the scent of the omega heat. Steve had never smelled anything like it.
Tony's body moved irresistibly, in the face of that blue gaze and the solid voice. But then he remembered himself. He put his hands on Steve's still naked chest to stop right before their lips could meet.
It hit Steve like a ton of bricks then.  Tony had said “But I thought..”. He had thought Steve was his alpha.
When Tony whipped around, clutching at his burning butt, Rogers was looking at him with amused eyes.
“Tell me how I can help.” He told the other man, not really expecting an answer but still needing to know.
"No." Tony answered, pouting just the tiny bit. Because, ok, no one had threatened him with physical harm but Fury had insisted that a collar and at least a temperoary period under the guidence of a dominant was obligatory in his case, if he wanted to stay in the team. If he didn't like the deal, he was free to walk away.
Soon after the cream the bed dipped and Steve's large body settled next to him, radiating heat. Tony cracked an eye open to see that the dom was naked from waist up. Curious piece of information to find out about the Captain's sleeping habits. Then the covers were pulled over him and Tony fell asleep.
"It's ok Tony. You just had to say it." Now Steve looked away, turning around to walk around the room, pace with his arms folded over his chest. "I can talk to Fury. There were other doms available. With high enough clearance. I can try and get someone more experienced for you. Maybe just convince Fury to send you the files so you can choose.."
"Not a good enough excuse. Now are you going to do what I told you to do or are we going to find out how many push ups you can do with me sitting on your back."
Holding out Steve's shirt, doing up his buttons, helping him with his atrocious belt, then tying his shoes while he himself was still naked was a humbling experience. Not to mention the feeling of Steve's skin under his hands, through small touches, little brushes of knuckles.. All Tony could focus on was Steve now. It was also a little bit ridiculous and Tony might have laughed if he hadn't been so subdued. But now it just felt fine. Steve wanted him to do things so he did them, feeling useful, being helpful.
Now, they had a nice routine going. Tony was less likely to snap, or break down just because someone was being rude or aggressive. He was starting to gain confidence in himself as he got used to the people and the environment, started to figure out how things worked and how people perceived him. Steve could also tell it was getting easier for Tony to play the arrogant alpha too. As long as he got to get breaks from it.
“Captain.” The Colonel walked in, looking around, probably expecting to see Tony, then he shook Steve’s hand.
"Alright. I'll humor you." he said, then added, "Oh but I have to say if the questions are about consent, I want it to be on record that I was blackmailed into this. So." he shrugged, knowing that being petulant about it at this point wouldn't do any good but unable to help himself.
"Why I'm merely complying with my masters wishes sir, you see he has recently acquired a butler for himself."
“Really?” Steve asked and turned to look at the skinny blond guy. Oh that one was definitely an omega and he was blushing hard under the attention as he nodded.
And Steve should want that. He wanted that, for Tony to be fine and to be back to his usual self. Still he couldn’t get out of his head how Tony had called for him, how he had leaned into Steve’s touch. He had started saying something, when Steve had come back to save him from the medics, he’d said “I thought..” and then never finished his sentence.  He had looked so betrayed at the idea that Steve would leave Tony alone.
After that they hung up and Steve went back to lay down next to his omega. Tony was warm and it took less then a gentle nudge to get him to wrap all his limbs around Steve. And until Tony properly woke up to distract Steve once more, Steve laid awake, thinking of what he wanted to do to Stane, to Howard for not protecting his son better, how he’d love and care for Tony, if Tony never got his memories back, how he’d make Tony be proud of being the dazzling omega he was… He would let nothing touch Tony anymore. Not a single doubt or worry would cloud his omegas face. Steve would love and protect him and make him happy as long as Tony would have him.
“No.” Steve turned to look back at Tony, then ran a hand through his hair. “He is.. happy now. Quiet. I don’t want to push him to talk about it right now. After the heat maybe.”
Then he looked at Steve, this time Steve could see a hidden vulnerability in his eyes. "I know Steve will take good care of it. Pep's the CEO anyway. The company will be in good hands. And I.. I'll be in good hands. This is the only way I can safely bring the document into the board of directors to declare it null. On my own terms. This is me breaking my chains, if you want to get dramatic about it."
When he came to, the ropes were gone and Steve was cuddled up to him on the bed. He was still naked and slick between his cheeks but a thin sheet was covering him. There were fingers carting through his hair and some semblance of reality started to leak into Tony's world.
"It stays on until tonight. I'll decide what to do with you then." Steve told him with a wicked smirk. It was also surprising how much Tony wanted to fling himself on the captain and kiss that smirk off rather than punch him for it.
Steve knew, somewhere deep down, that the irony in that was funny, but he didn’t feel much like laughing.
"You deserve a sub that's much younger, maybe someone that hasn't gone around the block as many times as I have, someone sweet, less sassy. Prettier would be difficult I give you that.." he hurried, trying to lighten his words, "I think you deserve someone... more like you."
“Oh yeah?” Banks raised his chin, “With all due respect Captain, we here on the 10th floor, are all aware of Stark’s little bump to the head. I know exactly what he was doing.”
Tony didn't notice Steve had grabbed the shower head so it came as a shock when cold water burst from it, not really hitting Tony yet, but flowing around his naked feet as Steve held it directed towards the floor.
For the past 2 days, he hadn't even thought about having a drink. He'd been sleeping like a baby and most curiously, he felt like everything was going to be alright. He turned the penny around in his hand with a little smile. It felt like a hopeful new beginning. Of course, he knew a couple of days did not a relationship make. Especially one that was forced on by SHIELD. But still, he felt lighter, less worried, less stressed, less alone.
Steve, good, loyal and smart, had understood what Tony needed. Tony hadn’t expected him to agree. But then Steve had placed his hand on his throat, not restricting his breathing, only holding, gently, but firmly.. He had said he found Tony attractive.. Why hadn’t they done that before then? What had stopped them? Steve had been clear on this point too. Tony still didn’t believe he could have said such things to Steve, called Steve names and pushed him away. Had he really been that stupid? Once he had Steve’s hand around his neck, he had wondered how he had even lived without it for so long…
For the third time he sank his teeth into Tony’s flesh, on the tight cords of muscle of his shoulder, deeper than his bites before and snapped his hips into the omega, making him cry out.
The whole premise of the story is that Tony is a submissive that has trust issues and Steve wants to teach him it's ok to trust. He is doing this by appealing to Tony's submissive nature and in turn they will both be learning leassons in dominating and submitting. At least this is the plan. Steve does NOT aim to break Tony, neither do I. But certainly both of them will come out of the experience as changed people. It's not a bug, it's a feature.
There was a piece of paper on the dresser, between books and odd knick knacks. Tony could see it was a drawing even though he could see just the back of a leg in pencil. Steve was busy doing whatever he was doing with his clothes so he pulled on the drawing, the paper easily slipped free.
Tony didn't remember reciting his vows. Nor the walk down the isle, or the small crowd. He remembered Natasha kissing him on the cheek at some point, and Bruce congratulating him. What he remembered from the ceremony was the moment he had knelt in front of Steve and the way Steve had put the ring on his finger. Then he had bit him on the side of his neck gently to great applause.  The rest was a whirlwind of faces and congratulations until Tony had managed to make it to the open bar.
"Duck left." Steve's voice ordered, and Tony did, then "Raise your foot, knee-high, step over." Tony did. "Turn right.", "Step down", "Get on your hand and knees." Tony sweated and tuned everything out. It was so much easier to focus on Steve's voice, rather than trying to guess and second guess himself. Steve's commands were clear and direct. It was giving Tony every information that he needed.
“It’s all my fault. Stupid. My fault.” Happy muttered as he reached inside the car and gathered his phone, locked it and turned to place a bold and pointless hand on Steve’s chest.
“Steveee.. ” Tony kept whining, coming close to stomping his foot as he stood in front of the couch Steve was sitting in. Steve closed the magazine and looked up at Tony.
“Then everyone can see who you belong to.” Steve growled and bit the unmarked side of Tony’s neck as a pushed a finger in.
"I would like to tell you about my point of view and then ask you if you find it fair. If you still think it's unfair, there is no reason for us to meet today. I will just leave and will not speak a word of this to anyone. You will be assigned a different dominant."
Steve drove Tony’s car, not really wanting to break Tony’s bubble, wanting to give him some time to shut out the outside world and just be.
The arrogant look melted away from Tony’s face as the man stood up and walked the few paces around the table, then hesitated before kneeling.
“Well you do remember how to flirt. That’s good to know.” She said, then added, “But onto more serious matters, Tony, Steve was right, I do have to tell you some things.”
"Yes." The Captain sounded serious. "I've created a bit of a rudimentary obstacle course for you. I'll time you on how fast you complete it. But of course you won't be able to see a thing so you'll have to take directions from me. I'll walk you through it step by step Tony, you'll have to listen very carefully and do what I tell you to do. I'm not putting a time limit on it today. But we 'll be doing this every day this week and I'll expect to see improvement by the end of the week. Do you understand?"
Then instead of taking the pennies and letting him stand Steve left the room, only to be back a second later with an empty bottle.
At that one corner of Tony’s mouth went up in a half smile, a genuine smile. Tony clearly already liked the guy. And why not, there must have been a reason they had become close friends in the first place.
They got a few questioning looks from various people as they walked through the corridor and during the elevator ride. But no one really saw any need to question why they were leaving together, or so early. Steve supposed what got the looks was more Tony’s state than the fact that they didn’t usually hang out together.
"You are right, I am still wearing your collar so I might as well... " Tony trailed off when Steve's eyes traveled down to look at the collar and Tony thought he saw a kind of strong emotion there for a second.
Coulson turned to him, “I have no intention of ‘tattling’. Without your consent anyway, Mr Stark. But I think informing the director would be the right thing to do. It would be safer that way if nothing else.”
Tony was just about to start getting restless when the doorbell rang. Steve checked his watch, then closed his book.
"You've been such a good boy today. Really, the best." Steve kept talking, his hot breath just wreaking havoc on Tony's neck. His head slowly fell to the side, exposing more of his neck for Steve's lips, tongue, teeth, really whatever he wanted to do to Tony's neck... But the dom merely kept speaking.
"And to answer your question," Rogers went ahead, "The point wasn't that you couldn't take orders from me. I was your team leader. I was never your dominant. If you can't see the difference now, trust me, you will see it soon."
Tony pulled into his garage without even bothering to park his car neatly. He just hit the breakes as the door of the garage door lowered behind him. He sat there, in the car, sitting crooked in the middle of the row of cars, and he tried to breathe normally.
It hadn’t helped. Tony’s scent was mixing with memories of his heat, and now that Steve was alone, he could let his control slip a little. His mind wandered to the feel of Tony’s skin under his hands and Tony’s taste on his tongue. Not imagined anymore, Steve knew exactly how Tony’s skin tasted, with its combination of arousal and a little bit of lingering fear, then satisfaction.  It had taken all he had to stop himself from biting Tony, make it hurt, press him into the carpet of the office to feel the omega go still under his strength, yield. Tony had submitted anyway, and so beautifully. Steve imagined himself back in the office floor, pulling Tony’s pants down, and scenting him between his legs, would Tony get wet? He knew some male omegas did, when they were aroused enough. He imagined Tony would and that it would smell divine. Then he imagined how Tony would whine and squirm if he had bit Tony just inside his thigh, on that sensitive spot, leaving his teeth marks on the dark smooth skin.
“..think you can do whatever you want Stark!  These documents are for authorized personnel only, Fury may coddle your spoilt ass but some people here are getting really sick of your selfish disregard for proper…”
"You keep saying I'm not ready for sex, news flash Steve, I'm not a virgin. You're about 25 years too late for that."
Tony's expression shifted to understanding at that and he leaned forward to peck Steve on his down turned lips. But it was too short a kiss for the alpha to respond. Instead Tony took a step back and hesitated before speaking.
"I feel it all the time. Peeing is awkward." Tony answered but when Steve looked up he said "But it's not pinching or anything."
Tony then looked up at them first, then turned to Steve as he said, in a voice that was almost too quiet to be heard, “Don’t worry. I know you’re not my alpha. I won’t go around telling people you are.”
Now as he laid on the Captain's bed while Steve carefully removed it, Tony both mourned the loss and celebrated the freedom. His cock, likewise, stood up to cheer.
“I shouldn’t do anything,” he hissed, “You saw what you saw. And you saved me. If you expect gratitude, thanks. Thank you Cap, for being the hero you always are, saving the damsel in distress. You say you’re ok with it, fine, good. Now can we for the sake of holy burritos forget about it!?”
“Holy shit! Does he like turn into a monster or something? Is that why the R&D department ran away from him? That quiet little guy! How cool is that?”
“Captain Rogers,” the man straightened a little and Steve really hated the fact that some agents showed clear bias in how they treated Captain America compared to Tony Stark. Tony deserved every bit of respect as he did, maybe even more, “Stark was going through confidential files he has no right or authorization to look into, and we don’t need to spend time and energy babysitting an arrogant, self entitled-”
"You have no idea how hot you are." Steve said suddenly and Tony's wide eyes snapped up to the doms face who was now practically standing over him, cock to eye, save for the glass still between them. Tony was only able to swallow.
Fuck. He should never have done that. He shouldn’t have watched it. He was a disgusting man. A disgusting, desperately horny man.
He had decided not to take another day off, as there would be no point to it. One week alone hadn’t helped Tony adjust, more wouldn’t either. He had caught up with the tech, now he needed to catch up with his environment. No matter how unpleasant, Tony needed to learn to interact and pretend, very fast. And now that Steve would be there for him, he hoped it’d make things easier for Tony. If he was honest with himself, it had been a stupid move to leave Tony to his own devices on his first day back.
“Nothing, nothing.” He said. Then looked a little sheepish as he added. “Just.. uhm, nothing. I wanted you to know. There is nothing wrong with it.”
Making a show of it, Tony pulled the covers back in his own pristine bed and curled away from the Captain. The heavy footsteps told him that Steve left his room as soon as Tony was under the covers.
"Pretty good actually. Uhm.. I know you said this week was going to be about adjusting to this whole Dom/sub thing but do you think I could borrow some pen and paper from you? I'd like to take some notes about my prototype."
A simple mission to gather intel had gone awry, the widow had been captured, Clint had ran in blind and the political situation that could tip into open war at any moment had not let SHIELD to openly interfere. No American boots on Syrian soil, except the most effective and small response team possible.
“For gods sake! Steve! I have the hottest and toppiest alpha who’ve ever existed on top of me! Specifically engineered to perfect human condition and selected for his awesome personality.  Who else would I want to pop my cherry but Captain America? In case you haven’t noticed, I’m sort of dying here from the lack of your cock in me! So help a poor omega out already!”
"Seriously?" Tony protested and the dom stopped what he was doing to give him such a look that Tony immediately shut up.
“No. Not for sure. But I had my suspicions. Don’t take this the wrong way Mr Stark but an alpha as loud and obnoxious as you are had to be compensating for something.”
"I'm not very good at this. I'm sorry." He cringed. "What I mean is, yeah first few moments I woke up, I remembered how I felt about you. Then I really realised how I
Both dread and anticipation filled Steve. This was bad, if Tony was still asking for Steve, even with Pepper around, it meant Tony was really sick, it wasn’t a fluke. On the other hand, he could do something, he could help, he could be there for Tony and Tony wanted him to be there.
"I see you Tony. If you think I've never really seen you before, you know that I do see you now. And I appreciate you for who you are."
In the end he had realized he had no choice but to confess to Steve that he needed help. He needed Steve’s help. He was so tired. Only after one day, the strain had been too much. It hadn’t been hard to admit, not really, choosing the words hadn’t been easy but the admission had forced itself out of Tony’s mouth. He needed the bubble of safety, in which he knew where he stood as an omega, where Steve stood as his alpha and he had to do nothing but obey. At least until he got a grip on this new reality that surrounded him.
"Oh for.. Ok, I suck at this. And you being super nice about it isn't helping. Just makes me feel like a bigger asshole."
The cool, fresh evening air hit him like a blessing. He walked past the occasional group of people who chatted with glasses in hand, and made his way down the marble stairs. When he turned around the massive fountain he was relieved to spot Happy there, leaning on the hood of the limo talking to a small but georgeous blond beta.
None of them spotted the antiaircraft missile headed Tony’s way, except Jarvis, and even then it was too late. Clint had carried Natasha to the jet, preparing for take off, when they heard the explosion.
It was a pencil sketch of Tony. He couldn't see the face because the subject was facing the wall but Tony knew it was him because it was from last night where Steve had made him stand against the wall holding pennies, with his back arched and legs spread. It was exactly from Steve's point of view from the couch and was pretty explicit.
"I know your checklist, I've read it, so I see no need to go over it again. If you change your mind on any of the points, you only have to let me know. You on the other hand, don't know what kind of dom I am so I'll try to give you an idea of what you can expect."
Nothing could be wrong with something that felt so good. He would leave the worrying to Steve. Steve probably would know best anyway.
“It’s not funny. Pepper, I’m worried.” Steve told her, frank as he could be. “I’m not worried about Tony’s consent. He made what he wanted pretty clear,” and wasn’t it amazing that Steve could still blush, but he pushed on, “that is not the issue anymore.”
“I didn’t graduate from MIT at 16 Mr Stark.” He said bashfully and looked up at Tony from under his eyelashes. Hell, Steve thought, the kid was crushing hard on fake!alpha!Tony.
"I don't think I'll ever get tired of looking at you." Steve said, his voice deeper than usual and much huskier than Tony expected. It eased his mind to find the Captain wasn't uneffected.
“Tony? What’s wrong?” He was trying to sound calm and comforting but he wasn’t sure if he succeeded. “They are just doctors, they want to help you. You have a head wound.”
“Oh. And there’s that guy. I don’t think I like him very much. Did I really make him? Cuz if I did, I don’t know why I would make such a party pooping tight ass.” Tony didn’t sound like he was completely joking when he said it.
Steve smiled for the cameras as more flashes went off in front of his face. He was starting to see stars dance in front of his eyes but it was part of the show. It must be worse for Tony as his name was on the fundraiser but the thought didn’t help Steve even a little. He knew Tony Stark was the alpha that was born for the masses to adore. Steve Rogers, even after a prolific career as a dancing monkey, had never gotten used to being the center of attention. He bore it with grace and charisma but he had never been the type of alpha who fed on mindless compliments. His self worth did not ride on what the press wrote about him. He had been invited to his friends fundraiser so he would ‘gladly’ attend. The real reason was that Tony had reasonably argued, more famous names in the event meant more media coverage. And Steve really did want to raise money for the prevention of domestic abuse toward omegas.
"Fuck, I'm not good at this, I should never have come here." Barton started after a minute of awkward silence.
At that Steve hugged Tony with one arm, still sitting on his lap, and pushed his hair out of his face.
They were at home and Steve had sat Tony down on the leather couch and wrapped him in a blanket. He had seen soldiers go into shock, he had seen them have flashbacks of the war. He knew they called it PTSD. He didn’t know Tony had it.
“What? No. What is going on?” Steve forced himself to not knock away Happy’s hand, but he stepped away and to the side to block his path. “What is your fault? Where is Tony? You’ll tell me right now.”
The captain was hunched over a little, the muscles on his back standing out and his right hand was working fast. Tony leaned over to hear what it was… And once he did, he hurriedly shut off the device, throwing it onto the bed.
Then, “How long do I have to stay here?” Tony asked Steve, and Pepper and Steve looked at eachother.
Of course Steve had been right to warn him, he had no right to trick the agents because he was having fun and getting info at the same time. And he had hoped maybe Steve had been a little jealous? But Steve was too down to earth for that, the good captain had only been worried about Tony’s amnesia and the young agents who were crushing on a fake alpha. Steve always was the better man.
“Fuck it.” He said out loud and stood up. He had made his mind up. As a matter of fact, he had made his decision years ago. When he had decided to live as an alpha. Not even a beta, no. Tony Stark would be an alpha and he would be fucking great at it. The best.
“Yes.” Steve answered the question. “I wish Tony had told me himself, but I can understand why he would want to keep the number of people who knew to a minimum.”
"Yes. Yes, yes of course I'll marry you." Steve said with a frown, like he couldn't believe what was happening. Or as if it was even stupid of Tony to ask because of course. What else could Steve say.
"You can't order me around. Steve won't like it. You know, the big ass super soldier I'm getting married to in about.. oh" He looked at his watch, ".. 5 minutes?" Tony jumped back up to his feet. "Oh god."
“Well not today apparently.” She answered tartly. Then she sighed, remembering that this was Steve, close friend and a trusted alpha.  “Look, its nothing you need to worry about Steve,” he placed a soft hand on his arm, “thank you for your consideration but there is nothing you can do. Happy will take Tony home. It’s nothing too bad.”
That was out of the left field. Tony wrecked his brain trying to guess who it might be on the other side of the glass. He couldn't think of any dominant who knew him so well /and/ trusted him.
“Steve.  I like you. I believe you are a good person. But you do know that I have an army of the best lawyers in the country and that I can take you for everything you own then make sure that you’ll rot in prison even through your unnaturally long life, Captain America or not. Right?”
He planned out the whole conversation in his head. There was no need to be emotional. He would explain to Steve that sometimes subs could just be too far gone to be retrained. Sometimes people would just have a groove carved in them either through this experience or that. And Tony had very deep grooves. It was just too much work to mend these grooves and Steve deserved someone grooveless, someone, shiny and smooth. Plus, he had been doing very well, hadn't he? Steve could maybe just tell Fury that Tony had learned his lesson and all was well. Everything could go back to normal. Tony felt like he'd learned a lot, like listening to Steve, trusting Steve... Trusting Steve..?
“But. Tony we didn’t always get along well. Last time we had a conversation you called me King Kong and told me to back off.”
But Steve stood his ground, feeling slightly ridiculous for his outburst. But Tony had been about to get away.
It was mostly decorated in warm colors, hallway separated from the living area with cream colored shelves, paintings and frames stacked around, leaning on the walls, waiting to be put up. He'd seen the kitchen and the brown leather couches that faced a decent sized fireplace. The hallway lead to a row of rooms, Rogers opened the first door, "This is the bathroom."
When Tony tried to go to his room to wait for his turn in the shower, the dom grabbed him and lead him into the bathroom.
After breakfast he cleaned the table and the kitchen without complaint. By now he could see that Steve was pretty serious about this dom/sub business and making Tony obey him. It was just easier to wipe away some crumbs and wash a pan than struggle against whatever punishment Steve might think of next time.
They had sex. Lots of sex with Steve leaving the room only to get the food that was delivered to their door occasionally. Tony lost count of the days at some point. Sometimes when he saw the sun at the horizon he didn’t know if it was rising or setting. He didn’t care. He trusted Steve unconditionally to take care of him. And Steve did.
In that split second Steve stood tall in front of Tony in nothing but his briefs, Tony’s eyes flickered down and Steve flexed. Tony was clothed and Steve was not but he didn’t feel at a disadvantage at all. He knew how he looked since the serum and he could see Tony’s pupils dilate.
“You’re right Pepper. Maybe it was a good thing the doctors haven’t figured out about the amnesia. If they had asked Tony..”
On Pepper’s orders Jarvis had locked down any historical information, like Tony’s capture in Afghanistan and his fight with Stane. But the technical info on Mark I was there. While Tony studied the suits under Steve’s watchful eye, he was whipping back and forth between being amazed at how damn clever he had been and practically bouncing out of his skin as he begged Steve to let him take one of the suits out for a ride.
Steve pulled Tony by the hand, positioning him in his lap, face down, with his caged cock between the Captain's big thighs. The dom took care to place pillows where necessary to make sure Tony was as comfortable as possible. When he was positioned just as his dom wanted, and a big palm rested on his bottom, Tony sighed. This was not that bad.
Tony shook his head, "No I'm.. flattered." he smiled. Then Steve pushed the basket of clothes towards Tony, with a smile on his face too.
The last was said in such a casual tone, like Tony was commenting on the weather, it took a second for Steve to process what Tony had just said. He must have looked surprised because Tony stopped chewing for a moment.
“Hey yourself.” Tony plopped himself down onto the chair in front of Steve’s desk without waiting for an invite. “One Tony Stark, as requested, delivered for lunch.” He said.
“If it’s any consolation we still liked you. I’m sure Steve did too. Despite the bickering and the ignoring. Now come on. Bed time.” She pulled him toward the bedroom by his hand but Tony resisted for a moment.
“Uh, Bruce do you mind if I talk to Tony first? I’ll tell him to call you ok?” He told the scientist and ran off after Tony to catch the elevator without waiting for Bruce’s reply.
“I haven’t mentioned my suspicions to him. But I’d like to report to him, yes. Tony Stark is under contract with SHIELD. It is illegal to forge a contract under false information. Not to mention the risk this puts SHIELD in. We also have to address the matter of the failure of our intel gathering methods. It’s not everyday that a mark manages to fool Agent Romanov. She was the one that compiled the evaluation report on Mr Stark when SHIELD was considering him for the Avengers Initiative.”
"There you are." The Captain said. Tony could only moan back in response with his eyes pressed closed and mouth open.
“Because.” Steve said. They’d had this conversation before, about Tony not really liking Steve, about how Tony might regret even kneeling to him once his memories returned. Steve didn’t feel like going over it again with a hard on.
Tony shut up. Minutes ticked by and he wondered how long it would have been. Half an hour? An hour? His arms were complaining but again, nothing he couldn't handle, certainly no where near as bad as a spanking from Captain America would be. And Tony was stubborn, he didn't want to give Steve the satisfaction of safewording out just because his arms were tired.
Steve didn't even acknowledge the garbled protest. A second later, something plastic and round was forced into his palm and Tony instinctively squeezed it, making a squeaking sound.
"Welcome to the Rogers domicile madam, how may I help you?" He bowed low with a flourish of his hand, his words coming out with a pompous fake English accent.
Steve hummed and moved his hips slightly until Tony felt his hardness press into his thigh. Damn but he wanted Steve again. He didn’t know what time it was, he didn’t care if he had stuff planned for the day. He couldn’t remember or bother to try figuring out what the world was doing anyway.
"You've made mistakes." Steve said, hand still petting Tony's head. "But you made amends. You're making amends, you will in the future too. There's not a single person on this planet that hasn't made mistakes. How many do you think worked as hard as you to fix those mistakes?"
After that it was a blur in the urgency which with Steve got rid of his briefs and pushed more fingers into Tony. He spread Tony’s juices around his cock then raised his hand to his lips to taste it. Tony only stilled for a moment to watch the alpha lick him off his fingers. Then he spread Tony’s perfectly toned and very male cheeks and pushed in.
Tony Stark, rooting around in trash while collared and naked, in Captain America's kitchen. If this wasn't the most embarrasing thing he'd done he didn't know what was. Somehow it was even more embarrasing then that one time when he'd puked on that girl while she was giving him a blow job.
“Okay.” Now he sounded wary and Pepper was giving Steve the ‘let me do the talking’ look. Steve sighed and shut up, after all, Pepper had been there for Tony for much longer than Steve had and if Tony didn’t act oddly attached to Steve, he wouldn’t even have a reason to be in the room.
What a pleasure it was to see that they managed to reach the quality of the first Avengers film! Just FYI I'm team Cap all the way but I appreciate Tony's point of view in all aspects. Gotta love a strong conflict!
He wrapped Tony in the jacket and picked him up. Something that would be impossible to do if Tony had been his usual self. The brilliant engineer and egotistical alpha that Steve knew would never had borne the humiliation of being carried around by anyone. Yet right now, Tony was trembling so hard Steve could almost hear his bones rattle as Tony clung to Steve with all his might, burying his dark head beneath Steve’s chin in a comfort seeking gesture and moaning lightly. It was the pure surrender and dependance of an omega that threatened to short circuit Steve’s brain combined with Tony’s strong scent right under his nose.
"Yeah. I am." The alphas voice came out a little lower then usual but his hands holding Tony firmly in place indicated that he didn't approve of Tony's public attempt at seducing him.
“What? Just making new friends. You know, since I don’t remember the old ones.” Tony answered petulantly.
The sound of boots outside broke into his thoughts. He still had no plan but he did open the door a sliver to see what was going on and he went completely pale. There it was, the half scorched suit, and at least five men escorting it, the face plate was missing so Steve could see the blood that covered Tony’s face as his head dangled to the side. He was injured, unconscious and in the hands of the enemy.
“You really managed your first day very well. Considering what you had to do.” Steve sighed. “You’re a very smart and capable man. I’m always impressed by what you do, what you can do...” He said. Words that he usually wouldn’t utter in Tony’s presence, had Tony been his usual self. It was easier to compliment the genius when he was kneeling there quietly and leaning on Steve in many senses of the word. When his massive ego wasn’t in the room to gloat or mock Steve for saying it. “I can’t begin to imagine what it must be like to pretend what you are not. You handled it well. As well as could be.” He amended himself. “Me or Pepper, we never would have asked you to do it, if it hadn’t been something you’d chosen for yourself. I don’t really mind that you tried to sneak information. Curiosity is in your nature. By now I know you well enough to know that. And I don’t blame you for it.” Then he cupped Tony’s face in his palm, and didn’t make Tony close his eyes again when they opened to look up at Steve.
At first, it had been fun, pretending to be an alpha. It hadn’t felt as weird as he had imagined. Clearly he had some practice at this. And the fawning of the junior agents had helped. He had never been one to turn down attention and compliments. It had seemed like a good idea to get them to talk, and they had, telling Tony about various little missions, tid bits that helped Tony put together a more coherent picture of SHIELD and of Steve in his head.
Tony felt the hand leave his head and felt the strong urge to turn around. It would have felt too much like seeking contact so he kept his head down and seethed as Rogers collected his pile from the table and walked to the door.
“Tony, I told you to pretend to be an alpha but you don’t have to seduce all omegas and betas on base.”
“Thor?? As in Norse god of thunder? You are bullshitting me right now and it’s absolutely despicable of you to make fun of a disabled person. I thought you were better than that.”He had sniffed and pouted until Steve’d produced actual video footage of Iron Man fighting alongside a certain blond hunk wielding a hammer which could apparently call down thunder. The whole concept had blown Tony’s mind.
“Coulson?” Tony sat up, then he realized where he was sitting up from. “Oh shit. Coulson.” He tried to scramble out of Steve’s lap but considering that the damage was already done, Steve hang on, not letting him get away.
Tony stood still in the embrace, surprised. Steve was big, Tony wasn't the tallest man and he usually resented it a bit but now, feeling how much bigger Steve was, and how his strength was all very gentle around him, Tony felt something warm and a little painful in his lower stomach, something that left him a little bit breathless and with a lump in his throat. How ridiculous was it that he felt safe here, in this mans arms? It was just a stupid hug and Tony felt like he was as delicate as spun glass, resting in the velvet box of Steve's arms.
The genius had gripped his wrist now, his moves uncoordinated but Steve could tell he was trying to get Steve to put in more fingers, to fuck him, anything..
With all the evidence surrounding him, Steve still had trouble matching the image of self-assured, cocky Iron Man with the image of the omega he had saved from the thugs tonight, clinging to Steve in desperation and need, scent intoxicating, a look of pure fear and submission in his eyes. How had he even managed to go so far..
"Oh my god.. Tony..." She gasp after some shuffling of papers, "What? These are.. These are stock transfer vouchers. All in Steve's name! What are you doing!? Why would you transfer all your SI stocks to Steve?"
“That’s ridiculous.” Steve said, but it was true that most of the medical wing knew Tony very well, also knew what a terrible patient he was, so maybe they had just hadn’t looked a gift horse in the mouth when Tony had sat there silently this time.
“I know you don’t always see eye to eye with Director Fury, Captain. But really, he’s one of the good guys.”
Steve knew the truth was a little different. Steve knew Tony wouldn’t last a day without her. But also that Pepper had never been and never would be Tony’s omega.
"Yes, I am clear on that.  So it's very important that if Fury is going to force you into this, at least who that dom will be should be your choice. "
The story they told him about Obadiah Stane had chilled him to his bones. He could understand what sort of terrible predicament his other self had found himself in and he was maybe a little glad he didn’t remember everything that happened. Still, he couldn’t even begin to imagine hiding himself for so long. Suppressing all the warm and fuzzy feeling he got around Steve.
He didn't care that he was drooling on the bedding, he didn't care that the Cap's hands were pressing bruises into his hips, he was grabbing Tony so hard. He didn't have any room for shame or propriety, as that tongue moved further into him, massaging and opening him up, all he could focus on was the feeling that he was being assaulted in his core, there was nothing he could do about it, either to stop it or to get more of it and he was loving every second of it.
Steve's body heat moved away, then there were the sounds of machinery being moved about, weights loaded and unloaded, Steve's huffing breath.. It was all very calm and quiet. Tony's mind was still full of Steve's voice. He didn't know how long it took for him to slowly come out of the shallow subspace he'd went into. But it was a while before he realised his thoughts had wandered in the direction of micro transmitters for his detector prototype. When he started doing calculations in his head he realised it was time to take the blindfold off.
"Well. I do know better than most people. Most of the SHIELD log heads eyes glaze over when I even try to explain a problem to them. How can I be expected to take orders from people who can't even follow what I'm saying?"
He let go of Tony to peek out the door, and the solution was sitting a little further away in the form of a land rover. If he could get Tony there without anyone noticing they could ride out. Not very safe, nor easy but it was their chance.
Then his hands moved to Tony's belt buckle and Tony bit his lip. Rogers slowly and carefully undid the belt and started to pull it out of its loops.
“Can you..” Then he stopped. Steve kept looking at Tony expectantly until the other gathered his courage to say whatever he needed to say. “I was happy. In the workshop, when you sat with me. I-I.. You’re the only one I’m really comfortable with. I don’t really remember why but it’s true.”
“It’s a cube, about this big. The greatest energy source known. It is said to be the crown jewel of Odin’s treasury. Found in the ocean after Captain America went down with it in 42. It was your father that found it. Then SHIELD started to…” But at that point Banner seemed to realize he was basically giving away very confidential information, without permission. Even if it was to Tony Stark.
“I’m glad to hear that.” Then Steve turned in his seat once more to put the bag that held the take out onto the table.
Steve smiled. "Good. Now Tony, I told you I'll always help you obey me if you have trouble obeying an order. So remember, you can always ask for help."
"Now, I want you to take off your pants, grab your things and follow me." Rogers nudged Tony with his knee. When Tony was standing he took off the belt from around his wrists. It hadn't been there long, but Tony still felt like he was let go from a nice warm hug.
"When we're at home, alone, I want you to call me by my name." Rogers said, and Tony realised, he had been referring to the dom with his last name in his head. In the field, he usually called him Captain or Cap or some creative variation, but he'd never called the guy by his given name. And he considered him a friend? What kind of intimacy did that indicate?
"I think you were yourself Tony." Steve said easily, still sipping orange juice. "And you have nothing to be ashamed of. It took great courage to talk about your fears. You have no idea how much I appreciate that."
“Nor does he remember Pepper, or Stane or Happy.. But he remembers you? Pepper told me the doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with his brain. I would have thought he’d be safer out there with Captain America watching his back.”
He'd never been much ashamed of his body, and he wasn't shy generally. But it was a completely different experience to be reduced to a body, a beautiful body that was appreciated by the onlooker, but just a body. He felt conscious of his skin, of the position of his thighs, of his chest pressed into the bedding and of his cock and balls, displayed brazenly with no thought for his pleasure or shame.
He shot a guilty look at Steve before going on, but Steve was too busy feeling like the ground beneath him was shifting. "I remembered hating you. And god.. How pathetic have I been.." He laughed bitterly, then shook his head. "I should be ashamed of how I behaved.. All the clinging and kneeling and... Well."
Now he was waiting for Tony to wake up. He wanted to be there in case Tony woke up and asked for Steve again. Which was very unlikely. Most probable scenario would be that Tony would wake up, break out of the infirmary despite the doctors warnings and advice, then go back to his everyday life complaining about his headache while ignoring Steve and pretending nothing odd happened at the Turkish border.
Tony's room was next to the Captain's. It was tiny compared to what Tony had back in his own place but this room was cozy. There was a plush, fake fur carpet thrown on he floor, a strong looking double bed made out of some sort of dark wood. The closet doors were mirrored, and the single window looked out onto the open street. There was only a table and a chair other than the bed and the bedside table. It was sparse, looked like no one had been in there in a long time, decorated by some professional and never lived in since then.
“Tony..” Steve slapped his palms on the door in frustration but there was still no answer. So he grabbed the door handle and pulled.
Tony felt the burn and the stretch but it just felt good, the pain scratching a deep itch inside him, when he wanted to feel more, deeper, stronger... The fingers moved, and it got even slicker. Tony realized the Cap had probably added lube to make it easier but he just felt open, available and absolutely surrendered to whatever the dom wanted to do to him.
“Nothing, nothing Steve. Really, it’s nothing.” Tony immediately turned to him, but there was clear panic in his eyes, weather caused by the aggressive behavior of the balding agent or because Steve had once again caught him doing something he wasn’t supposed to do, Steve couldn’t tell. More importantly, Tony was smelling so strongly of fear and distress, it wouldn’t take long before even this older agents nose picked up on it beneath all the cologne.
It turned out to be too much to wish for when a few hours later, sounds of an argument stopped Steve in his tracks. He had been just walking down the corridor, passing by the offices of some of the senior agents when he heard Tony’s name mentioned.
He’d wanted to take a quick, cold shower, check on Tony, and walk back to his apartment. Tony never did things by halves and even the bathroom of the guest suite on the floor was dizzying. Still, sitting with Tony’s head in his lap all evening, he hadn’t possessed the patience to play with all the buttons and switches that adjusted water flow, temperature and pressure strength. He had pulled off his clothes, leaving them in a heap on the bathroom floor and thrown himself under the spray, the temperature set to freezing.
Half an hour later they were sitting around the coffee table, Tony sprawled next to Steve, almost leaning toward him but not really touching and Pepper was nibbling on the end of the last pizza slice. Dum-E and Butterfingers were safely locked in the workshop, theTV was buzzing on the background.
For any other alpha, no matter how much cologne Tony used, it would be impossible to scent anyone like this, but Steve was different. If he concentrated hard enough…
“You don’t have to apologize.” Banner smiled kindly and Tony struggled to see even the tiniest hint of what had scared the other scientists away. There was nothing. The guy was more of a very shy nerd than a big green rage monster.
Steve looked at him, shoulders straight and jaw firm but something in his eyes wasn't right. A minute stretched between them, making Tony grow nervous. Eventually when Steve spoke his voice was unreadable, he sounded completely normal, despite what he'd said.
Half an hour later, with more than a little help from Jarvis, he had managed to produce coffee, toast and a pan of scrambled eggs. He decided to let Tony sleep however long he would, and set aside Tony’s portion. He was trying to get used to the tablet Jarvis had told him he could use to read the newspaper when Jarvis once more interrupted the silence.
Next time Steve looked up at Tony’s face, his eyes were closed. Steve dithered on the brink for a moment, not sure if he should let Tony sleep but then he decided 93 degrees was not fatally low, considering the situation. An after a while Jarvis spoke up,
"Coulson. Really? I didn't think you even liked the guy, the way I've seen you growl at him. Which was sexy by the way. I never thought you'd choose him as your bestman."
When Pepper put the phone down with her shoulders slumped, Steve grabbed his jacket for the ninth time.
"You bet. After all I can safely say I've seen it all." Barton replied and stood up. "Thanks for the beer." He drained the last of it and moved to the door. Tony got up to follow.
Well, he was still wearing Steve's collar so he might as well cook the dom breakfast as long as the collar was on him. Plus, whatever mood Steve woke up in, there was no point in pissing him off further.
If only Steve would nail him. Now, well after lunch, Steve was sitting on the couch while Tony knelt next to him with his prototype in his lap and the notebook laid out on the floor next to him. Steve was reading a book and petting Tony like he was a tame house pet. But at least Tony had started on the calculations he'd wanted to put on paper at the gym.
“It doesn’t matter now. I don’t blame you, it was my fault too. But if we somehow get involved in a personal relationship, no matter how temporary, until you get back on your feet, start remembering, I can never know if it’s truly what you want, or if its the amnesia talking. I can be an alpha to you. If it’s what you really want. Honestly, I’d enjoy it too.” Steve ignored the heat he could feel in his ears as he confessed a sliver of his true feelings, but he had to, to make Tony understand, “But I can never be sure if that’s what you would choose for yourself if you could remember everything. Considering what I know of you, you wouldn’t want that. You wouldn’t want an alpha meddling in your business. And even if you did, that alpha wouldn’t be me.” It would probably be Colonel Rhodes but no matter how helpful Steve wanted to be, he couldn’t bring himself to recommend Tony try his luck with the Colonel. He just couldn’t.
The video started with the shakey image of decimated streets, it turned skywards for a minute to catch Thor zip through the frame, looking like a dot in the distance, then there was a roar and the camera whirled again to land on the impossibly massive back of the Hulk. When the Hulk turned toward the camera and raised his arms to bash chitauri skulls, Steve subtly turned to watch Tony. The engineers mouth was hanging open as the video kept playing the sounds of screams, the terrible roar of Bruce followed by crunching and screeching, then explosions. He turned back to look at the screen and the Hulk was running away from the camera throwing cars around like they were cheap toys. He took the pad from Tony’s numb fingers and hit pause.
"Oh it's not? I thought you understand the concept of fair, between you and me. I am the dominant, you are the submissive. Which means I give the orders, and you obey the orders. Is that fair?"
Before he could ask for further explanation though Pepper was there, lifting the documents out of Steve's hand.
There was a moment of silence, then a different voice spoke, deeper, and obviously electronically manipulated.
Captain walked over to the counter and opened a bottle of water, he drained it in one go then turned to Tony.
“That’s the Colonel.” Steve said, not exactly grinding his teeth. Pepper shot him a warning look. They weren’t supposed to outright tell Tony. Steve didn’t hate the Colonel. There was just something that rubbed him the wrong way.
Raising an eyebrow at him, Tony forced himself to finish it. "There." He handed the glass back to Steve who took it and placed it on the counter top, looking amused. He was still holding Tony tight around one elbow.
Tony was sitting and joking with a bunch of junior agents that Steve could name maybe half of. He couldn’t hear what they were talking about but Tony was making the agents laugh uproariously on occasion. So he made his way over to their table.
“Just hear me out for a minute. It’s not something Dr Banner enjoys, it’s not exactly a superpower. He has been struggling with it since he had the accident with gamma radiation. It’s actually… much more.. startling… to see it. You were the one who called him a big green rage monster that one time. You weren’t being mean but it’s not something Dr Banner appreciates being called. Tony, he needs to keep his emotional state at check constantly. If he gets angry… It takes an enormous amount of effort to control his condition. Before I show you the video, I want you to know that he struggled long and hard to learn to control it and that he can control it.”
“I am certain Captain. He left clear instructions. It was yourself who determined he had dressed and picked up his wallet before leaving. May I suggest that the best course of action right now would be to wait?”
“Fine by me. You can just leave it in this parking lot then.” He slipped into the car and still took a moment to give Steve a horribly insincere, tight grin. “I promise to be just as annoying as always cap. You don’t need to worry about it.” Then he drove off, leaving Steve to stand there and look at the tire marks he left behind.
“This document legally binds Mr. Stark from having access to his inheritance as well as any income procured through the actions or policies of Stark Industries, in force as of the appointment of Obadiah Stane, Executive CEO of Stark Industries, followed by death of former CEO Howard Stark, until such time as Anthony Edward Stark marries the Alpha of his choice. In which case all possessions and artifacts owned by Stark Industries  shall pass onto the possession of the said Alpha, preventing an Omega from operating the company in any effective form.” JARVIS summarized helpfully.
Steve helped him dress, putting a tshirt and pyjama pants on Tony, then when Tony was in bed in the room Steve said was his, the dom laid down next to him on top of the covers.
"Right now, you're in no position to hope for anything." The bed dipped under Steve's weight then strong hands pulled Tony's hips up, forcing him into a kneeling position with his head still on the bed. Tony felt exposed, his hole within direct line of sight of the Captain. But when he tried to get up on his elbows, a heavy hand between his shoulder blades pressed him back into the bedding.
"Ye-" Tony tried to answer but Steve squeezed his cock, cutting him off, once more Tony felt breathless. "Yes..."
"Tony, you always have your colors and your safeword. Believe me I'll never ignore or forget. But tell me one thing honestly, if I let you get away with any of it, would you still respect me as a dom? Would you be able to go down as beautifully as you did yesterday? Would you be able to submit to me? How would I be any different from all the other doms you've chewed up and spat out? What would be the point of this arrangement?"
Tony didn't know how long it took, but after a while he started to zone out in that very focused way he usually got when he was working on a particularly challanging project in his workshop. The world fell away and all that was left was Steve's voice, guiding him. He was a bit surprised when Steve told him to stop one more time and then there were arms around his shoulders. Steve's voice spoke right next to his ear, his breath tickling the hairs on the back of his neck.
I feel that I've throughly discussed the issue of consent in the whole of first chapter and I do not feel there is any noncon or dubcon in this. I do not view the conditions of the arrangement as coercive. As I made the point in the comments, in life we agree to do things that we don't like, in order to get the things we want, like studying to pass an exam. Tony is in no way forced to be in this relationship with Steve, he is offered an option. Sex was never part of the deal, that is a thing between a dom and a sub in this universe, if Tony wasn't so enthusiastic about sleeping with Steve, they could have had a completely platonic dom/sub arrangement. So I feel there is absolutely no dubcon and if you do feel there is, please don't feel like you have to read this.
It had been two hours since Steve had woken up to find Tony gone. Jarvis was extremely unhelpful even though he had apologized for being unable to give out information Tony had locked him out of, in an almost regretful voice.
“You look hungry. Dig in.” He said easily as he grabbed a slice for himself and dropped onto the couch.
They stayed like that for a long while, Tony resting and Steve petting the nape of his neck with his other arm wrapped securely around the subs waist.
"What do you do with manipulative subs?" Tony gulped, now a bit breathless. He felt a bit like he was dangling a string in front of a tiger.
"And what will you do if I don't?" he asked trying to sound seductive but he sounded apprehensive even to his own ears.
Then Steve dumped the clothes into a basket, right next to his feet and took the drawing out of Tony's hands.
“Tony.. Tony..” There was so much blood, he couldn’t see, was it too much? His fingers moved too frantically to be gentle on the back of Tony’s head to find a wound but thankfully they encountered none, until his fingers swiped over a cut, too high above Tony’s temple to be noticed at first glance, easily hidden under the helmet. He swore, that could be dangerous, though he didn’t know how deep it went. There wasn’t enough light, and he wan’t about to dig his dirty fingers into an open wound.  He had to keep going, find what else was broken or ruptured, if there was any internal bleeding or any major fractures.
Steve didn’t say anything as he opened up his magazine but he wasn’t even seeing the words on the page. It was more than a little worrying the way Tony still watched Steve very attentively, noticing every little nuance in his mood and responding to it. Usually Tony didn’t give a fuck what anybody else thought about him. This Tony cared very much what Steve thought. Steve really needed to be more careful.
Even those restrained caresses had been enough to make Tony’s head spin, make it so that all he could see and feel and smell was the gorgeous alpha above him. Finally he had let go, allowing Steve to be his world, even if just for the time being, he gave up and finally relaxed, knowing that Steve would take care of him.
Tony sighed and interrupted him. "I know buddy. I know. But it was unfair to you and me both. You could never be my alpha, I love you like a brother. You did what you could but Rhodey, it was still hell. The company.. It meant too much to me, it was my life. Actually it IS my life. But was I really alive? Obie's document made sure that I had to make a choice. It was either I got to live my life or have the company. Now, I've made my decision. "
Instant boner. He watched for a few seconds as Steve finished, washed his hands then grabbed the soap. Only then he thought to wonder what it was that Steve had said right as he had orgasmed.
The speed of Jarvis’s answer indicated that if he’d been human he would have sighed, instead he answered as calmly as always.
To Steve’s surprise Tony looked uneasy for a moment but then nodded and moved to the bar. It dawned on Steve that it’d be a bad move to get drunk while you were responsible for someone. And Tony had asked him to be responsible for him. He had placed himself in Steve’s care, for a little while at least.
Tony nodded absently and started to get undressed to get ready for the day, then he stopped, his shirt half way off.
I've finally seen Civil War! What a movie! I have to say it's in my top 3 MCU films as of this moment. We'd bought our tickets a month back but the reason I saw it so late is that there was a fire in the cinema complex, half way through the film, the first time we attempted to see it! They evacuated the place and firetrucks swarmed it and everything.. So we had to rebook along with the overflow... Terrible luck I suppose but no one got hurt so it's all good.
“What if he is just disgusted? Everything.. Everything that happened since Syria.. What if he woke up and suddenly remembered who he was in bed with? Had been for the last five fucking days.”
"Oh, and while you have time, you might want to glance at the cookbooks in the kitchen. I won't hold it against you if you pick something as simple as possible today, but you will be cooking lunch. See you then."
“How bad was that head wound?” Coulson asked as they watched the paramedics take Tony away. It felt wrong somehow. It hadn’t at first, but Tony had called for Steve for some reason. Steve still wasn’t sure if Tony actually recognized SHIELD teams or Coulson. But he had recognized Steve. And he had called for him.
"I'm sorry?" Tony asked, more to try his luck than because he was actually apologetic. He was torn between arousal and hesitancy to take on Steve's brand of orgasm control.
"First rule, I like my submissives to be willing. I don't want a puppet, but I don't want to force you into submission every night either. Other than any role playing scenario, I want you to use your safeword or code words immediately if you don't like what I'm doing. And unless you're going to use your words, I want complete and willing submission. Understood?"
"He's not quitting his job." Steve bit out in answer. "And I don't presume to make Tony's decisions for him. We won't be taking any more questions. Thank you." he said and dragged Tony down.
It had been a few hours since Tony had returned from lunch but the edges of the happy bubble lingered around him. It helped that the department floor had gone unusually quiet because most of the crew had already abandoned ship.
There was a pause in which Tony suddenly became really self conscious about the frown on his face, reflected back at him on the mirror. Fuck but this was disturbing.
“You’re not gonna get me pregnant either but you’re very welcome to try. As many times as you want.”
Steve looked awkward, waiting for Tony by the door and Tony took a moment to feel embarrassed at how he had just assumed the guy was his—He shook his head.
The scorch mark and a small crater was there. But no Tony, no suit. He could see where the suit was dragged on the ground, but there was no way of telling if it was Tony who had dragged himself to some sort of safety or Syrian special ops team salvaging the remains as fast as possible. If the latter was the case, reverse engineering could be a problem. Last thing they needed was a version of the War Machine in the hands of Syrian military.
“He did.” Pepper said sadly. “Tony is not stupid you know. He was 16. Already more involved in company business than Stane was comfortable with. As much as Stane tried to bench him, and told him not to worry his pretty little head, Tony lost the trust he had in the man. At least, to the degree to hide his heat from him. Who knew how Stane would react to finding out Tony was an omega? He locked himself away, he got through it. I don’t know how. But he held off revealing for sure that he was an omega until he had definitive proof that Stane wasn't going to try and push him out of the company management. He wasn’t expecting to be fucked over so royally.”
The colonel looked at Tony with wide eyes and everyone in the room could almost hear his heart break. "Tony, I never meant to.. I didn't know what to do.. I only tried to be there for you when you asked of me.."
The part where Rogers had given him a speech taking apart Tony's motivations had been the scariest part. Who knew Rogers had paid attention? And it had all been true, if incomplete. Just the tiny glimmer of hope that a dominant of Captain America's calibre might be able to understand him and dominate him, was what made Tony make his mind up. He was going to do this. He'd go through with it. Whatever Rogers wanted. He'd do his best, and if it didn't work out he'd at least have the excuse of having tried. After all it wasn't his fault if he was too fucked up to function like a normal submissive. He'd just have to live with it.
“It’s unfair, both to you and me, Tony.” Steve said, and got up, collecting the cartons to put them into trash. “This is not a good time to talk about it. I wanted you to come to me for lunch because I wanted you to relax, not because I wanted to have an argument.”
On the other hand, he'd never felt this exposed before, even when he was naked in the middle of an orgy. This felt, oddly, much more personal than any spanking he'd ever gotten from any dom he'd slept with. He hadn't even had sex with Steve.
“Oh.. Bad..” The lab assistant that Tony had cornered answered, then he went on licking his lips, “I-I mean, of course he’s a very nice guy, Mr Stark.  Please don’t tell him I said.. You know.. ”
He had worked hard, for so many years now. This was not new to Tony. Sometimes even he couldn’t tell where Tony ended and the alpha act started. But sometimes, times like these… Tony knew exactly where his omega self started. To military precision.
Steve turned as he spoke, and Tony tried to think about what kind of cold rinse he must have had to put himself through regularly, during the war. The idea of freezing water anywhere near his gentials this soon after the treatment he just got should have dampened his arousal but Steve was now facing Tony his hand languidly caressing his six pack, leaving soapy trails.
Oh that was rich, coming from the guy who showed up more than a week after Tony’s release from the hospital.
Steve placed a hand between Tony’s shoulderblades. The possessive gesture unintentional but Steve sort of needed the contact.
It was Tony’s first day in SHIELD and Steve hadn’t seen him since morning. It was making Steve antsy. Both Pepper, Happy and him had reminded Tony that he needed to remember that he was an alpha. Nothing overt, no over acting. He just needed to be his usual arrogant self.
So it's up to you to buy this or not. I was very nervous about making him propose immediately. I hide behind two reasons, one is that, this an a/b/o verse and extreme posessiveness is a thing. This is Tony accepting that he belongs to Steve mostly. Accepting that their relationship is not temporary.  Another reason is that Tony is a terribly impulsive person in my opinion, and he can go overboard. I think I even gave away the hints of the ending in the summary. Boy, is he unsubtle.
Steve didn't reply but Tony could hear him rummaging around in the cupboards. When the rummaging stopped and the footsteps started getting closer to Tony's head, Tony tried to turn and look,
He had gotten a glimpse of what Tony would be like if he really let himself go, in that desperate moment of carrying him from the alley to Happy’s car. Tony needed help and he hid it perfectly. So perfectly, that even knowing Tony was pretending to be an alpha, for the whole month until they had accepted the mission in Syria, Steve had started to think if he had dreamed the whole thing up. Tony was such a great actor, Steve had started to think maybe Tony didn’t need help, maybe he had it all under control. Then Tony had lost his memories. His fear, his resentment of Steve… Coming out the other side a whole new person.
Tony grudgingly sank to his knees, his eyes spitting fire at the dominant. Unexpectedly, Rogers simply grabbed Tony's head and forcefuly averted his eyes to make Tony look at his own knees. Tony stayed put, if mostly out of surprise and outrage.
The serum had not only given him a superior sense of smell, it had also given Steve near perfect memory. He clearly remembered the scent that had poured off of Tony while Tony was in heat. It was unforgettable and made worse by the fact that now Steve had to sit and stew in a very dimmed down and tamed version of it all day. Still, the scent never failed to remind him of Tony’s heat.
“We met when the SHIELD called me in to work on locating the gamma radiation signature the Teserract was emitting.” Banner told him as he started up the sequence on the screen in front of him.
Anyway, my fic ignores all that in either case. I am so not up to tackling such massive issues. So here's some more everyday drama. Please enjoy.
Still Tony knew it would be a shitty thing to do, leaving Steve in the middle of the night, without telling him and that just confirmed what a shitty person he was. Steve would definitely be better off without him.
“Nothing that we can’t fix. It’s just that, you have forgotten about some decisions you’ve made about your life. And I wouldn’t want to rush you, but it’s important that you know about them as soon as possible.”
Tony didn't like this but without safewording out there was no way he could get out of Steve's "exercise plan". Plus, he didn't want to prove Fury right by chickening out of following directions. Steve wouldn't let him brain himself on a piece of gym equipment, would he? No. Tony at least trusted the guy to keep Tony from injuring himself.
And everything came to a halt, dead silence ringing in the room following Rogers' booming command. It was only broken by Tony's breathing.
“It’s alright Tony. You remember SHIELD? Coulson? Look, it’ll be fine.” Steve gestured to around him, but Tony didn’t raise his head. Instead he let go of Steve and kept sitting there, looking down. Then after a beat, he said in a subdued voice,
"It's not about that. It's.. It feels like... It feels like if I'm me, than people will just, not want me."
Steve slammed the car door shut without really meaning to use so much force. It banged shut on Tony’s face, almost catching his fingers. The window of a lesser car would have shattered.
“Good man. You didn’t leave R&D today, did you?” Steve asked as he pulled the sunglasses off of Tony’s head to place them on the table.
"Breathe Tony." Steve's other hand was warm on his chest and Tony tried to concentrate on that. It was impossible.
Tony turned to him with a frown, "Thanks for reminding me Mr obvious. But I'm too fucking tired of pretending to be an alpha, pretending that I'm doing just fine, getting by on a couple of phone calls a year. Begging for scraps of affection from you then feeling like shit for even needing it."
“Good.” Was the simplest answer. It was a massive understatement but there was no more accurate word than that to describe Tony’s state at the moment.
The captain looked relaxed, unselfconscious, like being watched didn't bother him at all. Tony supposed the army did that to you. Steve turned on the water and stepped under the spray. His sigh, along with the display of muscles and that tight ass went to Tony's cock. And got stuck there, as Tony's cock had no space to manuver in. He felt the cage starting to press in on him.
By the time he'd half assed his way through the bulk of it and declared himself done, he wasn't even sure what time it was. His neck was stiff and he was a little hungry.
Turns out, despite all the mockery and the petulance, Tony did take Steve seriously as his alpha. Steve had asked one of the guys from the department to call Steve if Tony left the R&D floor but when lunch time had arrived and Tony walked in after knocking on his door, Steve hadn’t received any calls.
Tony shifted awkwardly on his feet, looking like he was waiting for something. It dawned on Steve that what he was seeing was how Tony would have acted around his alpha if he could let out his omega self. It was disconcerting and Steve felt shame for the thrill the idea sent up his spine. This was entirely too wrong.
Tony remembered everything, Steve couldn't get over the fact, and Tony still wanted him. Wanted to marry Steve even, be his omega, officially, in the eyes of god and government. In the eyes of..
“If you think it’ll help, I’ll compile a file and send it to you.” He said, without taking his eyes off the computer screen.
"You're only a tease if you don't follow through. Finish the dishes and come to my room."  With that, the dom was gone.
But Steve did notice the smug look drop off of Tony’s face as soon as his back was turned to the photographers and Tony wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead. He couldn’t hear what they were whispering about over the noise of the crowd but suddenly Pepper leaned into Tony, looking first nervous then terrified.
The R&D had been in a bit of a panic last day or so. No one had stopped to explain Tony why exactly, but people had been moving their projects out of the department, trying totake an absence of leave and basically doing their best to get out of there. But when he had insisted on getting an answer why everyone was trying to get out of work, he had only received nervous looks and polite answers along the lines of “Oh, I’m not scared. It’s just, you know..” I think I may have the flu, the 6th floor has better coffee machines, the labs are poorly lighted here, I’ll be visiting my grandma.. Or any other bullshit reason.
"Hmm, I could, couldn't I." Steve murmured, then placed a very chase, dry kiss on the most sensitive spot on Tony's neck, right where his neck met his shoulder, causing Tony to break into goosebumps. But then the hands, the breath, the hardness at his back was gone.
Steve shrugged. "I had a lot of time on my hands before Fury came to me with the Avengers Initiative. And there is so much food in the future. You guys are spoiled." But he was still smiling, watching Tony enjoy the food.
He followed the marks, as much as he could, dealing with any party who spotted him doing so. But soon he lost the track, coming to a stop, seemingly in the middle of a bunch of buildings, not knowing which way to go from there.
"Nothing. I didn't do anything." He said through clenched teeth. In his emotionally exhausted state, heavy with guilt, he couldn't exactly summon up the indignation to speak up for himself but he also couldn't give ground to an alpha who he occasionally couldn't help but see as competition.
"Sure Tony." She rolled his eyes, then fixed the red handkerchief in his breast pocket, then patted his lapels and stood back to survey her work.
"I'm so pleased with you. Very obedient, eager to please. You just needed a tough hand, didn't you? Someone to appreciate your effort. I do."
Tony grudgingly nodded, rubbing his itching cheek on the inseam of Steve's pants. The hand went back to petting his hair. Tony had to admit it kind of felt nice.
He went to the couch and sat down instead, deciding that this afternoon would be for Tony’s benefit, so the omega could relax and let go, let go of his stubborn will, of his obligation to make choices and decisions. Rest. Steve supposed Tony had been needing this kind of rest for a long time. Too long to even consider. He just hoped he could give it to him, without snapping along the way.
“I didn’t want your thanks.” Steve frowned and his hand dropped off the car door he was holding shut.
It had just been a couple of nights ago but it felt like a lifetime away. The Tony who had first held that penny against the wall was such a different Tony than the Tony mopping the floor. And The current Tony wasn't so sure that he was all that unhappy about the difference.
"Challenge accepted." Tony nodded in all seriousness. Then he got up to clear the plates before Steve had to remind him.
Taking a bite himself and feeding a bite to Tony (despite Tony's protests) Steve finished the plate, then let Tony get up off his lap to clean up.
In the blink of an eye, Steve's hands were on Tony. He ran his fingers over Tony's jaw and neck as the omega turned to look at the others. The colonel made a rude sound but Steve simply snarled into Tony's neck, not even looking back at the other alpha. Tony's lack of objection to his very public display of 'mine-mine-my omega-mine' was very helpful in calming Steve down.
Tony startled awake feeling like he was hit by a bus, when his alarm went off just a couple of hours later.
“Jarvis, turn down the heat?” He asked, but his voice came out croakier than usual, then he realized he was still hard.
Silence. Tony considered just using his safeword. Was it worth this shame? The Avengers, the team? If he safeworded he could just rest his arms, put an icepack on his back, first pee then jack off as much as he wanted. He would go home and pour himself a drink.
"Well I thought the whole point of me submitting to you was that you'd .. /make love to me/ until I submitted. Oh for.. This is ridiculous, we're both grown men, I should be able to say fuck. I thought you'd fuck me into submission, alright?"
Banner frowned, looking away from the screen, then he brought his hands together to indicate size as he started to describe it.
"You seem peaceful in there, for once." The last was said gently, with the ghost of a smile and Tony didn't dwell on it very much other than Steve had been looking for something in Tony, and seemed to be happy with what he'd found.
"Alright, come here. Your punishment is almost over. Now you only need to tidy up your mess. Then I'll let you sleep. How does that sound?"
There was no way he could have kept proudly silent, even during the first few hits. He was yelling and biting the cushions. But towards the end his cries had turned into sobs. Steve's arm was always there though, keeping him in place, keeping him steady, anchored.
"Already handled." He said, then looked up into Steve's eyes, smiled brightly, and spoke, not to Steve but to Pepper,
But he just nodded and said “You’re not an asshole. Just be a little more careful. Maybe less socializing for the first couple of days? Hm?”
This is the exact thing I was trying to avoid, with my previous story too, I always try to update regularly and often, like every few days. I always have a bunch of chapters already written beforehand and story notes so that I know where I'm going in every chapter.
Tony stayed. His breath stuck in his throat in anticipation, everything about his dom's demeanor now suggested that he better obey with less sass, or else.
Under Steve's watchful eye, he quickly shampooed and rinsed his hair, scrubbed his armpits and privates, trying to get rid of the sweat as much as possible, as fast as possible. When he shut off the water and moved to step out of the stall Steve stopped him.
"You look beautiful like this." Rogers said, then shoes were in Tony's line of sight as he stepped toward the couch and sat. Tony smelled food. "And obedient. I appreciate it. You can look up now. I ordered Chinese for tonight."
“Yes. If he was scared of me, he could have just asked me to leave, or something. But he actively tried to stop his heat.”
"Let go. Tony, I've got you. You're being so good and I'm so happy with you. I know you can be good, all you have to do is let go."
Steve wanted to tell her that there was something odd about Tony. Something wrong. But he couldn’t start that conversation in front of the nurse. Then when Pepper went inside and Steve made to follow, the nurse gave him an apologetic smile, told him Ms Potts was only allowed as she was Tony’s omega, listed as family. Well. That was still sort of good news. It told Steve that at least the doctors here hadn’t realised Tony was an omega. He was on record everywhere as an alpha and apperantly during his time in the hospital Tony hadn’t given them any reason to doubt it.
"No! Just- God, please.. I am dying here.. " Tony said as soon as the gag came free. "I didn't' Don't- Please don't stop... Oh my god.. You have to fuck me, Steve, I am serious, I am losing my mind here.. Can't take this anymore.. You have to.."
“Don’t break hearts to get what you want Tony. You’re too good for that.” Steve told him and at that Tony looked back up at him. His expression shifting from resentful to awed. Then he shook his head and one of his hands came up like he wanted to touch Steve, it hovered over Steve’s chest for a moment then dropped.
Because it was a misunderstanding at the core of the matter, wasn’t it. Steve had misread the situation. Maybe at first he had been right to give Tony his space. But later.. No matter what had happened between them in the past, Tony was a grown man and he could make his own decisions. Steve had to trust Tony to know what he wanted. And clearly, Tony wanted Steve. He had been such a meatball to push Tony away. In the end it had drove the omega to the point of torturing himself to control his desires rather than violating what he believed to be were Steve’s wishes.
"No news is good news I think." Steve said, clearly continuing a conversation they were having while Tony was in the kitchen.
"His handler thought he could benefit from the guidance. The same rules apply here Mr Stark. The fact that you are a submissive is not the cause of this proposal. It is just a bonus that might make it easier for you."
Steve huffed in annoyance but he was nothing if not determined so he followed Tony to his car. Luckily Happy wasn’t around and Tony had driven himself today.
“Captain.” Coulson simply said with that permanent half smile on his lips. He had come to a stop right in front of the couch Steve was frozen in.
"Now you know you're forbidden to come without my permission and you know I'm not going to give you permission today. But I believe, at this stage, you could still use some help following the rules. I don't want you to think of this as a sign of distrust Tony, think of it more as me helping you to stay away from temptation when you're alone."
“The information is only available to Mr. Hogan, Colonel Rhodes, Ms Potts, me and of course, now, to yourself Captain.” JARVIS intoned. “May I advise you on how important it is to keep this information from any other parties, as it would have considerable legal ramifications on Mr. Stark’s possessions, should the knowledge leak into the press.”
Steve kept driving as long as he could, getting as far away as he could, all the while wanting nothing more than to stop, strip Tony of the armor and see. See how hurt Tony really was in that thing. They had all gone through a little briefing in which Tony had reluctantly explained various aspects of the suit, since they were a team and they needed to know how the other members operated. He hadn’t explained much, claiming that Jarvis was too effective and simply smarter then all of them combined so if he had trouble with the suit and needed help, he was covered, thanks. But now Jarvis was dormant, or off, or doing whatever the hell AI’s did when they were being useless. Yet Steve knew enough of the suit that if Jarvis was online he could scan Tony for damages. He didn’t know enough to repair it.
To his dismay, it seemed to him that Pepper looked even more stressed when he appeared rather than relieved to see him.
He pulled his hand back, slowly, and Tony once more put his head to Steve’s knee and closed his eyes. Steve picked up a magazine from the coffee table and started to flip through it, settling in to just sit and relax with Tony. Only, he couldn’t concentrate enough to read anything.
