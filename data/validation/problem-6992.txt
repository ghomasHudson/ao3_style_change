Clint shrugs and takes another swig. "It's not that... I mean it's complicated. It's not like we can just fuck and it happens, right?"
By the time his second drink was finished, he had found what he needed, took two right away and was finally ready to get down to it. The high was great, his mind was finally numb and his body was burning so he headed for the backrooms, hoping he would find pleasure on his way there. He was well into it now, already staggering. A good sign. He could start implementing his plan of action. Tony was thinking nineteen, at least. Nineteen was a nice number to start with. A prime number. Also the age he was when he first met Steve. Well, on second thought, he should be more ambitious. Twenty-three was a very nice number too. Also a prime one.
Steve pouted and answered his friend with his middle finger. "I wish!" He mumbled, still very conscious that he still hadn't presented and that his cherry was very unlikely going to be popped any time soon. "We're just helping each other on our school assignments."
Bucky stares at him bewilderedly. It takes him a moment to register the words. They make no sense to him. The alpha hasn't needed him for anything ever since the omega came back to live with the pack. And even before, even when he actually needed him, he had never asked for his help. His hands shake and he parts his lips helplessly, speechless. Felicia's cries intensify and his instincts call to him and he turns his head to the door, feeling the irrepressible urge to  go.  Except Steve's hand grabs his wrist before he can reach the handle.
Tony knows he is blushing. The incongruity of it, the unexpectedness. Steve's eyes glint with something both tender and mischievous. He's handing the rose to him.
Tony jerked his head up and stared into her eyes, they were gentle and concerned. He felt a tremor in his jaw. "My name's not Gregory." He croaked out and immediately regretted it. Why would he say something like this?
"Yeah, well. Don't divorce me then, Stark! 'Cause it's too late for me now. I'm a desperate cause..." It was just meant as a joke but Steve felt a blush creep on his face as the words left his mouth and he saw the expression of his boyfriend soften with hope.
Bucky and Tony had been licking each other's wounds and found some balance in their relationship. Bucky was giving Tony things Steve would have never been capable to offer and, somehow, he was glad that someone could. Tony deserved it.
Clint's smile fades a little and he stares down, chuckling softly. He inhales and lets out a long sigh before he answers, his finger softly brushing the neck of his beer. "I can't say it's still as hot and fiery as when we started dating, we've known each other for more than ten years... but we're not...we're not getting bored. We're trying new things, we're still...
He stared at his phone and thought of Steve. He felt numb. Steve hadn't tried to call or to text him, unsurprisingly. He hadn't either... what for? He looked at the time and fancied joining him for a second or two. Even if the party might have already ended, maybe he could still meet him at home. And then he remembered what Obie had said and he remembered what he had done with him, and then he remembered Steve's biting words... He remembered Steve's jealousy and Steve's dishonesty and his own disappointment.
Steve sat down on his heels and shrugged, a soft pout on his lips. "I thought you were trying to help? Kiss me, then! And we'll know if I'm into alphas after all..." He was being very serious.
That's is the kind of alpha Tony is. One that takes advantage of a lost and disoriented omega. One that takes advantage of someone who doesn't have any rights. Someone weakened and That's the kind of person he is. A despicable human being.  A scum. He hates himself.
But he should not worry, he was not the only one who hated himself in Tony's presence. Tony hated himself too. He just wished he could be free from his own existence but the feasibility of it was a bit tricky. He could free Steve from him though.
"Because he was..." Tony blurted, matter-of-factly. "I still think your relationship with him was the healthiest relationship you've had. He was perfect for you."
"You're the most interesting person I met." Tony said as he kept fondling his cheek tenderly. Smile so achingly gentle.
Although, the idea might have crossed his mind once or twice but that wasn't something anyone should ever admit, he thought. Tony stared at him with mischievous eyes. "Liar." He said with a dancing smile and he dropped his head on Steve's chest again, let out a long exhausted hum and slumped down on Steve completely, already falling asleep.
series came the roses. Red. Beautiful. Smelling like love. One for each day, rolled into a funny doodle. At the end of the week, Tony had a full bouquet in his living room and felt a lot lighter that he had been for a while. He decided he was finally ready to talk.
Steve came quickly, there was too much anger between them, too much frustration, and when he tried to get up and return the favor, Tony pushed him back down on the table and fucked into him relentlessly until he came inside. This time there wasn't any pleasure. When his boyfriend spurted inside, he planted a soft kiss on the nape of his neck and when he was done, without a word, he pulled out, pulled up his pants and left him there.
Why did he do that to him? Had he been a better person he would have left a long time ago. He should have kept to the darkness he belonged to instead of tainting Steve's purity with his filth. He should have gotten out of his air. He should have never given him his number. He should have never tried to talk to him. He should have never tried to look at him. Tony wasn't supposed to look at him anyway, at anyone really. Tony was supposed to look down and be used. Not the other way around.
"It's okay, baby." Steve smoothed. "I'm all in." He said while brushing a hand over his sweaty lower back. He grabbed his hips and started thrusting. Tony was shivering all over. A panting and sweating mess in Steve's hands. The surprise made him lose balance and for a moment he let Steve manhandling him, a dangling puppet in his hands, before getting his bearings back. He didn't protest, nor did he try to escape. He just endured Steve's relentless thwacks holding himself on one hand and gripping his cock with the other to seek his own pleasure.
Steve was everything to him and he betrayed him. He betrayed his trust. He betrayed his love. He ruined everything, ruined their future and their past, destroyed everything good they had.
Steve straightened up, grounding himself. He didn't look at the painting at first. Even though it had been quite a long time since the last time he had seen it, he still remembered in detail what it looked like, and what it felt like to look at it. In hindsight, he could admit it was good, from an artistic point of view, he was proud of it. He had been inspired when painting it and he both loved it and hated it at the same time. It represented everything Steve hated about Tony, about them, and most of all, about himself, but it also represented all the things he loved. It had been such a complex and violent and dark and agonizing moment in their lives, in their relationship. A moment which had called into question everything. A death and a rebirth. Darkness and light. The destruction and reconstruction. A turning point. He really didn't know what to think of all this, the fact that millions of people were now going to be able to witness this most private moment, no later than the next day. He'd rather not think about it. These people were going to dig into the depth of his soul and stare at his most precious and most intimate feelings. He suddenly felt naked and exposed and something twinged inside of him, something that churned and twisted his stomach. He finally gave the painting a curious glance, it still felt overwhelming. It brought back too many excruciating memories, so he looked at his boyfriend instead. Tony was frozen, lips parted and so many emotions flashing across his dark eyes, unreadable.
Tony grinned, all teeth out. "Do you see anyone else in the car?" He said with a mischievous smirk and winked. Steve didn't. "Come on, Rogers. Don't make me beg!" Tony exclaimed, tone amused. "Get in!"
Tony kissed him in response and carried him up, lifting him like he was a doll. Steve curled his legs around his waist and kissed him back, claiming everything he could from him.
Tony burst out laughing, throwing his head backward, his laugh shaking his chest and resonating in Steve like a charm. "Isn't that the point?"
When it passed, desolation completely frazzled him. He dropped his entire upper body on his desk in despair.
Tony gave him a gentle smile. "Don't know... because we were fucking." He explained, looking bored and indifferent. "Because I said 'I love you' and you said it back. Because we kept going on dates. Because I let you fuck my ass and told you I wanted you to be the first..."
Steve was in a daze for a short moment but after some time he pushed his boyfriend away and rolled them over on the bed, pressing Tony's back into the mattress and taking control. Tony let him and spread his legs a little. Steve settled in the crook of his arms and kissed his chest, hand wandering up and down his stomach, creeping further and further down into his pants. His boyfriend shivered and tensed under his touch but melted into it. Steve finally climbed on top of him and started kissing his way down. He wiggled in between his legs and tugged on his pants, pulling them off. He did the same with his underwear and Tony was spread bare-assed on his bed, cock proudly sprung up and eyes hazy, intent on Steve. He propped himself up on his elbows and stared down at Steve, silently waiting for his reward. He spread his legs a little more, invitingly.
Steve was still shaken, his entire body still shuddering. He felt hot and cold at the same time and a bead of sweat was dripping down his spine. He wiped a hand down his face and sighed, unable to acknowledge his own emotions at the moment.
Everyone startled and tried to decipher the truth from Tony's enigmatic words, at first. They stared confusedly at him and then at Steve with skeptical looks and embarrassed smiles. Who could blame them? They all knew of their history. But rapidly though, the smiles turned genuine and moved expressions appeared on their faces.
He rushed down the stairs and stopped just in front of the kitchen door. He was not a kid anymore. Seventeen-year-old boys didn't go crying to their mama, after they had presented. He refrained.
Steve remained silent through. And Steve's silence were upsetting. The Steve that Tony knew was a bundle of nerve, quick to react, never at a loss for angry words. Tony would rather he told him what he wanted to say. He'd rather be yelled at, get bawled out, get hit or beaten up, anything. Anything other than this incomprehensible and bitter silence. "Are you mad?" He asked timidly. The words were scorching his throat.
Tony's treacherous heart skips at the sight of Steve's radiant smile, warming and illuminating his daughter's face like a godly ray of light. She smiles back and looks up at him, fascinated by the faces he's making her. She laughs and he laughs and the sound is so warm it almost ignites a sparks from the cold stone weighing dead in Tony's chest.
Dark-haired guy interrupted his weird train of thoughts with a hand on his neck again. His thumb and middle finger pressed on the glands underneath his jaw. Hard. This time Tony whimpered and sucked in a painful strangled wheeze. His head span with the lack of air and his hands let go of the other guy's head to grab dark-haired guy's forearm instinctively. Tony didn't push him away however, he opened his eyes and stared bewilderedly at the guy's face, lips parted, and melted into the strong grip which was dangling him against the wall like a puppet.
"Very alright." Steve muttered in the crook of Tony's neck as he hugged him, unintentionally grinding against him. He felt the urge to push him down on his bed and mount him. His desire, an urgent and excruciating pain in his pant. "But..."
He brought long and skinny fingers to his temple and felt a small bump jutting out. He pressed it without thinking and felt stupid when it hurt. He delicately wiped the smear of blood off it and headed to the English classroom. He knocked on the door and closed his eyes as he staggered inside, expecting to encounter Mr Fury's wrath. No such thing happened however. Instead he was met with the death glare of his single eye for a split second and annoyed ignorance as he coldly told him off. "You're late, Rogers."
Tony was absolutely gorgeous in his workout clothes. He was gloriously standing, a few feet from the entrance, nonchalantly resting on one leg. His arms were dangling lifelessly on his sides, hesitant. His hair was tousled and his eyes were crinkled, his shoulders slightly slumped in a relaxed way. Steve's eyes paused on the contrast of the loose dark tank top on his olive skin and the veins of his bare shoulders and then wandered down his chest to stop on the bulge he could see through his workout sweat shorts.
Steve sniffled, realizing his life would completely change when he presented as omega and felt suddenly very very depressed. He took his bag and started walking away from his friends.
It worked, indeed. Tony was no rookie, he knew what he was doing, been doing this for as long as he was old enough for the bouncer not to look twice at him when he showed his fake ID.
"I was just—" Tony started but didn't go through with it. "Hey," he said instead, "can I offer you a drink?"
Clint gave him a fond smile. " 'Cause I thought you were hot and you were being a jerk. I just wanted you to acknowledge me." He took Bucky's hand in his and squeezed gently. "I was good, wasn't I?"
They kept staring at each other lovingly though, and everyone was charmed and smiling at them, eyes filled with emotions. Steve felt his heart flutter. So much time had passed since they were students. So many things had happened. So much had changed. He contemplated the scene, eyes filled with love and wonders.
"Don't be so hard on us." Steve said. "You moved everyone to tears with your story." Steve certainly was anyway. He was still shaken about the whole revelation thing.
The alpha responds to his growing distress with gentle fingers brushing his damp hair away from his face. "What did you want, James?" His voice is husky, low in his throat. Each word are pervaded with lust.
They were seated opposite each other in the library. Tony was deeply absorbed in his essay and frowned obscurely at his paper, mouth curled into a pout, his whole stance exuding profound inspiration and deep thinking. Sometimes he dropped his pencil and scratched his head, mussing his already scruffy hair. His breathing deepened then and he would inhale deeply before sighing concentratedly.
"Oh, I'm not going." Steve blurted, getting things immediately straight. Tony's expression changed into something indescribable.
Steve grinned, eyes mischievous and full of intent. He grabbed Tony's thighs right above the insides of his knees and stared intently into his eyes. "Can I take it into my mouth?" He asked, boring his eyes into Tony's, determined to get his explicit consent.
Steve feels the two hands of the omega slide around his waist and land on his belly. Bucky nuzzles into his neck, legs cupping him from behind, fingers fondling his resolutely firm and flat belly.
Tony was regaining colors by the day. Bucky and Steve had insisted the three of them should eat three meals a day on a daily basis. Tony knew better than argue against two serum-enhanced omegas. He quickly put on weight and his features softened and relaxed with time. He finally looked alive.
There is a moment that seems like an eternity before the AI answers. A moment during which Tony can't keep his eyes away from the omega, invisibly connected.
"You have?" Steve croaked out, eyes curious, looking up and searching Tony's. Tony pushed into him again, grinding and making Steve gasp. Steve wondered why he kept struggling. He knew he would succumb in the end. He always had and Tony was attacking him, pinning him against the wall, leaving no chance for Steve to escape. Not that he wanted to. He just... He just didn't want to do this at work. "They'll know what we're doing."
"Dinner tonight. 7pm. Private investors. We're going to negotiate a potential new contract with them. Make me proud.  "
Tony shrugged and leant forward. "Well I disagree," he said, elbows propped up on the table and his chin resting on the palms of his hands, "I think we both needed to grow up for it to happen. Maybe the extended pining period was a necessary thing. I'm glad we are where we are now..." He smiled, eyes a little unfocused. "That's cute how you're so oblivious though." He added, looking straight up into Steve's eyes, teasing.
He shivered as Tony's warm breath brushed his skin when he chuckled softly. "You kinda smell like an alpha in rut right now..." He husked out, voice hoarse and spiked with arousal. "And it's driving me crazy, to be honest." His breath was tickling Steve's neck and the sound of his voice went right down his belly. He shivered again, feeling like a jolt of electricity was running up and down his spine. He curled his arms around the alpha's neck, as if needing comfort. "You presented, right?"
Tony giggled but his eyes flickered with lust and he unconsciously spread his legs, silently agreeing to everything Steve said.
He let his hands drop down along his sides and sighed in exasperation. "Tony..." He groaned reproachfully. "You're the one who insisted to come and help me today. I'd have asked Buck and Clint otherwise." His boyfriend looked up at him, eyes glistening with mischievousness, an unashamed smile on his smug face. Steve rolled his eyes and grabbed a dust-cloth that was lying around to whip his pretty ass with it. "Don't slack on the job! Or we're never gonna have time for any kind of reward at this speed... Move your ass!"
She looked at him silently. "Your blood pressure is good, your heartbeat is steady," she paused, hesitating. "But I should really keep you in, just in case," she blurted after a moment of reflexion.
He turned his eyes to the computer again, avoiding the burning angry stare of his boyfriend, hoping the videos would help take his mind off it.
"I remember when I came in," he explained, "that Steve looked at me, in a way that suggested it was more than just mere curiosity. I felt his eyes linger on me and I was kinda proud of it and because he was a guy and he was young, too, I did feel a little a warm inside. I kinda was flattered actually. And then I sat with my parents and I got bored so I started to search him from afar. My first thought about him was that he was cute, and very conscientious about his job. He seemed to take it so seriously for such an ungrateful job and, hum... you know, that was
The sun rays were shining and flooding the bedroom with winter morning light, creating a halo of warm colors over the bed, on the scruffy tuft of hair sticking out of the plushy comforter. It gave them an unusually golden shine. The scene was ethereal, almost, and painfully domestic.
The door opened invitingly. Tony gestured him to come inside. Steve scanned the spacious compartment inside and saw no sign of Natasha's presence. He frowned again, suspicious. "Are you alone?"
Steve snapped. "Will you fucking listen to me?" Tony jerked his head up and finally looked at him. "I'm not pressing charges." Steve explained with a gentle, reassuring voice. "And I'm not moving out." He added. "And I'm not breaking up with you. What is wrong with you?"
The answer was so unexpected Steve was unsettled for a moment. "But you're hard." He mumbled, not feeling comfortable with leaving Tony in that state and walking out of the room, with everyone staring at them. "And I can't let you get out of here while looking like this." He ran a hand in his hair, trying to make it behave.
Steve felt a blush creeping on his face and looked down. He had never told anyone how he and Tony had met. Somehow, he had kept the details of their first encounter to himself. It would be interesting to know why exactly, although he wasn't really sure he really wanted to go there and look deeper into it.
He remained unmoving in the middle of the room for a while, not knowing what to do. He saw the fridge and figured he might as well have something to drink or eat, in case he vomited again. He opened it, found some weeks old yogurt in it, figured it might help to soothe the pain in his throat. He wasn't hungry, though, on the contrary, he still felt nauseous.
His eyes roamed the room and paused on Johan and his goons, snickering like grade-schoolers. Steve rolled his eyes and ignored them. He was way above such childish behaviors and if he couldn't fight back physically, he had decided he would compensate his short size with a grander attitude.
Despite everything, they were able to finish quickly. Tony behaved, mostly, but did ask too many questions.
Tony put strong hands on his shoulders to steady him and pulled away, staring teasingly into his eyes. "Oh no, I wouldn't have missed this for anything..." he said in a hoarse, provocative voice, "I love it too much when you boss me around, Rogers."
Tony thought about it. There was hardly anything he hadn't done before in the sex department, within the range of practices that didn't lead to permanent body damage. "My ass is off limit." He finally said.
As expected, dinner was just a pretext to get intoxicated and maintain good professional relationships. The contract was practically a done deal. Tony had talked about three minutes at most and didn't even have the time to present the basics. It didn't matter that he had busted his ass off the entire afternoon for this fucking presentation. He was curtly cut short by his own begetter under the superior stares and mocking laughs of the round table. He swallowed his pride and pushed the unnecessary feeling of uselessness that kept bugging him at the back of his head.
A shiver runs down his spine and he grabs one of Steve's hands in his and parts his lips in puzzlement. Steve answers him with a gentle smile. His eyes are playful.
After a few minutes, Tony jerked and hiccuped against him. He let out a strangled, shuddering breath. "I feel so dirty." He whispered into Steve's neck. Steve squeezed even tighter, protectively, and said nothing. He just planted soft kisses on his head and held him tight against him.
He is crazy. He knows very well he is. Although he tries not to show it too much because the last thing he wants is too be sent to a psycho ward and drugged until there's nothing left of him but a vegetative human-like being, constantly stoned and addicted to anxiolytics. He likes to tell himself it should be fine as long as he's not a danger to other people and he is almost confident he has things to offer to the world before that happens. Besides, he's always had an acute sense of self-preservation. It is a bit contradictory, he'll admit, but no matter how much he tried to hurt himself in the past, his survival instinct always seemed to disagree with that. Maybe he should see this as a sign? Who knows... He has stopped now, anyway, he thinks. Life is too fucking beautiful.
"Definitely! You're getting more handsome by the day, darling." He teased and then protested. "That's so
Tony felt a cold shiver down his spine. He didn't know if Obie's words were a promise or a threat. He wanted to lean into the touch a bit more though.
Tony stirred and moaned softly from under the covers and Steve's heart fluttered. It tingled down there as a rush of warmth spread throughout his body. It was a bit late for a morning wood though, Steve had been up and about for almost two hours already: he'd been painting and had done some cleaning, breakfast was ready and waiting for them, which meant there was more to that tingling. It was a perfect Sunday morning and although Tony was still half-asleep and seemingly not ready to wake up, seeing him like this, so defenseless in Steve's bed, gave Steve a sense of happiness that warmed him up to his core. His lips unintentionally quirked up into a loving smile before the tingling in his pants pushed the warm and fuzzy feelings away to replace them with something more intense.
"There's only a few of months left before graduation." Tony whispered. "I really wanna make the most of it. I don't wanna bother with anything else."
"I hope my son is treating you well." She says after a cordial chat. "He better be." She adds threateningly. "And you two better be using protection." They hear her say as she heads upstairs, to the bathroom. "No child-conceiving under my roof!"
Clint puts a firm comforting hand on his shoulder and presses it gently. "Don't do this to yourself, man."
Steve rolled his eyes and averted them. "That's cute how you're embroidering how it all started between us. We hooked up,
Steve ignored the pang in his chest and swallowed the lump forming in his throat. He felt his eyes prickle. Never before Tony had been so hard and inflexible with him. He felt like he was in front of another person. He breathed in a shuddering sigh.
The ride was silent. Tony was pensive, leaning on the other side of the huge car, looking out the window. His smile gone. Steve was leaning against the opposite door, glancing at him surreptitiously. He was nervous, the atmosphere somehow tense between them. He pinched his lips and licked them while rubbing his clammy hands on his thighs. He swallowed. "Why did you follow me?"
Obviously this wasn't the reaction Tony expected. He let escape a weird strangled laugh and smiled at him confusedly. His eyes were questioning and Steve startled at the gentleness in them. Tony tilted his head on the side. "It has its perks, I suppose." He said in a shrug, eyes intent on Steve, so serious and determined, and then he reached out a hand to Steve's face.
The light in the living room is a little blinding and his gaze searches for Steve. He immediately focuses on his boyfriend and stares at him. He definitely—
Steve looked down and pinched his lips. "That you won't be able to say no." Tony's eyes flickered and fixated on him. He looked a little pained. Steve felt a pang in his chest. "Tony, I... I'm sorry."
And so he does and sinks his teeth in the bonding gland. Bucky cries out and shivers all over. It doesn't work indeed—only Tony can bond them, only him can sacralize this existing bond between the three of them with the blessing of his bite—but it makes the omega come a fourth time, a brutal, wrecking dry orgasm torn away from him in the worst way. Or the best, depending on one's opinion.
Steve let escape an embarrassed laugh. "You don't mean that, do you?" He asked, worryingly. "I mean, why would you think we were?"
here. I feel safe." Steve explained, intent eyes plunged into his boyfriend's, never letting go. "With you." He paused, making sure he conveyed what he meant to. "I've got my own space. I have everything I need."
Tony felt an agonizing pain in his heart. Not a physical one, or maybe it was real, he wasn't sure because he couldn't breathe anymore. He felt his entire self shudder with fear but the reluctance in Steve's demeanor unsettled him and for the first time he found it in himself to fight back. He narrowed his eyes, focusing his glare on the man who was supposed to be his boyfriend and shower him with love and affection but kept hurting him again and again. "Do you really want me to?"
Clint sits up next to him and curls a hand around his neck. He presses gently on the nape of his neck, brushing his thumb up and down in a comforting gesture. "Are you alright?" He asks worriedly.
It doesn't matter that Steve came back. He always does. It doesn't matter, now, that Steve smiles beautifully to him. It doesn't matter that he submits just like a docile omega, just Tony has always secretly wished from him. Tony isn't a fool as to ever trust Steve's submission again. Every time he went down on his knees, Tony was double slapped with the back of his hand. Tony never truly wanted him on his knees anyway. Steve was always too grand for this. He is a free spirit and shall never be put in a cage.
He stared powerlessly at his phone with his cigarette smoking in his hand. Helpless, lost and miserable again.
"How come you found my favorite chocolate ever in your deserted apartment?" Tony asked with an amused glint in his eyes, pretending everything was alright.
When the first lights of the morning sneaks in, they are licking their wounds, entangled into each other's arms. That was far way better than all their wildest dreams combined.
Thor's loud laugh echoed in the room. "But you still gave him the job." Thor probably remembered the amazing shows they used to do at their parties.
get one hundred percent involved in this. Somehow, with everything, I kinda had renounced having kids then. Being a dad in my fifties...never been a plan but, hey, life is full of surprises."
How come Tony had so much pictures of them? Steve didn't even remember taking them. There were also pictures of Steve with his friends.
Tony was grinning now and shook his head in denial. He chuckled while rolling his eyes. "Do you really think I would do something like this?"
They stared at each other for a short moment. Tony was frowning at him, pouting angrily. Steve stared back at him with a growing puzzlement settling in his chest. He watched his boyfriend gulp down his second drink with a certain detachment. Tony grabbed his face with his two hands with an unusual violence and kissed him. "I'm sorry." He whispered on his lips. "I shouldn't have yelled at you." And he kissed him again. It was urgent and brutal and fierce.
He takes a last drag from the joint and smash it in the ashtray on the nightstand.  "—wasn't the best of our ideas." He brushes a finger on Tony's cheek and gives him a gentle smile. Tony lets his friend comfort him as the latter sits him up and cradles him into a protective embrace. Tony drops his head, or hides himself, into his neck. Everything is blurry and his heart is racing a little too fast, probably. And if he's been crying a little, well... no-one says anything about it. The good thing is, he might not remember about it tomorrow. Some silver lining.
What would the others think now? And why had no-one told him how painful it was? Why does no-one ever talk about this? And how was he gonna do this?
"What if my dad or Obie took care of it before I heard about it. They're both dead now. I'll never know." Tony almost sounded panicky. Steve could feel his heart racing in chest. He didn't know what to do, so he shut him up with a kiss. Tony startled but it worked and Steve gave him a gentle, comforting smile filled with all his love.
Steve gasped and snuggled against him. "How selfless..." He teased, being sarcastic. "Why would you always think that T'Challa was better for me than you are though?"
His heart skipped another beat. He felt his skin prickle, his hands shaking. Tony's presence was dark and overwhelming. Silent but oppressive. He turned back to the window, his left hand nonchalantly resting in the middle of them. Steve stared at it, at his fingers which, he knew, were so skilled, and felt the need to touch them. He wanted to reach out and brush his fingers on his knuckles, follow the lines of his bones and veins, intertwined their fingers together. Tony's hand slid closer to him and Steve let his hand hover over it, resisting the temptation of grabbing it. His breath hitched. Would he grab that hand, he would pull his arm the rest of him, clutching at the alpha like his life depended on it and begging him to fuck him right now on the backseat of that car. There was something both sordid and exciting about having his first time in a limo.
Bucky shivers from head to toe as the warmth of the omega envelops him. Their scents mingle and spike with arousal. Steve kisses him before mouthing the alpha's cock. With a gentle hand running through his damp hair, he slips his tongue into his mouth and they kiss for a moment. It's soft and wet and mellow and the alpha's scent spikes with want. The kiss ends up on the alpha's cock and they keep licking each other's tongues while lapping the hard shaft of their alpha.
Steve managed to talk them out of it thankfully and Tony watched them leave with a surge of relief. What the fuck was he doing with them anyway? He had no rational answer to that question... He did regret, though, mildly, not taking the time to ask for dark-haired guy's number when they were gone. Just in case... But only for a second or two because Steve was there... And Steve was his life. The light in the darkness. His guardian angel.
gonna be a problem in the future." He points at the box, tries to anyway, and flashes Clint a wide and mischievous smile. Clint laughs and shakes his head while Tony wobbles to the door. His friend follows him in a relatively similar state. His head hurts a little but it's nothing another drink can't fix. He's fine now and grinning without purpose. He doesn't think he can see or walk straight but he can see and he can walk, so there's that. He feels light-headed, that's all that matters.
There was nothing Tony wanted more than get up and hold Steve in his arms right now. The guy was a little insistent however, his touch repulsed him. "Fuck off, loser." He whispered. "Don't fucking touch me."
Tony laughed and it somehow relaxed the atmosphere of the room. His eyes were twinkling and something fluttered in Steve's chest. How handsome Tony was at that particular moment, it still unsettled Steve. It still charmed him. Tony had this way to attract everyone's attention, a charisma Steve could hardly compete with. He felt small.
"Well now, they know I guess." Steve mumbled and Tony glanced at him fondly and chuckled. And nothing else mattered.
Steve looked up again, only to contemplate the stupid face Tony was making right now, eyes wide open and mouth gaping.
Everyone laughed. Natasha grumbled and stood up abruptly. "All right. That's enough. Hearing this for the hundredth time. Time to pee. Where's Tony by the way?"
Pepper sighed again, a gentle, comforting sigh. "They're not gonna hate you, Tony. Besides, you already know all of them. And you'll be nice and funny and charming just like you know how to be, and you'll
Only to be trampled down by the cynical and biting tone of his boyfriend a few moments later. "What's so funny?"
Obviously that wasn't the answer that Steve expected, or maybe Tony had hit too hard. "You liked it..." Steve choked out, almost breathless. "You
By the time Steve was on his knees, Tony was fully hard, cock springing proud and erect in front of him, beautiful. Steve smiled smugly and stared up at him, lips brushing the inside of his thighs. His boyfriend had his eyes closed at first and was biting his lips. Steve nipped at his skin and they flared open, lewd and burning with desire. No grief, no pain, no stress, nothing but pure lust and silent gratitude.
"We're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year," he said excitedly. Then his warm chocolatey eyes were back on Steve as he took his hand.
Tony's entire body hurt. He probably had bruises everywhere, maybe even a broken rib, or two. Zipping down his hoodie and taking it off was the last thing he wanted to do now, however. One because it was Steve's and two because he really didn't want her to see. If she saw she might want to keep him here.
Steve smiles and his features relax. Tony can smell his anxious thoughts ebbing away. His heart is beating fast and loud and Tony can hear it and feel it as if it was his own. Maybe it was. Maybe they had one heart for. Maybe that was what being bonded meant.
Steve felt another blush creeping on his face. He stammered, "no, I... He was just trying to be a good date, I guess... You know, 'cause that was my first dance and everything. Not a big deal..."
Tony yelled, his tone as cruel as his words. Steve felt each of them slaying his skin. "I hope you choke on it!" Tony added, voice shivering.
It felt home and safe and comforting. Especially with two omegas in the pack. And the pup was just a blessing. The cement of that pack. Natasha felt home for the first time in her life.
Note aside: I have absolutely no medical knowledge whatsoever, nor about the procedures in these cases. Things happen this way because it suits the story. Sorry for the lack of plausibility. Didn't mean to offend anyone.
By the time he joins them in the nest, his slick is already dripping along the inside of his thigh... a single, trickling drop, trailing down his muscles to his knee. The scent, the mingling scent of alpha and omega and heat, spicy-sweet and violent, hits him brutally.
Tony's smile was huge when he tugged his arm toward their last stop. He was walking backward, literally pulling Steve inside the room. They stumbled, both losing balance because of the hurried movement. The light was brighter there and Tony laughed, making fun of Steve's clumsiness. Steve felt awkward and Tony's laugh was giving him warm fuzzies, and he was happy.
They made sure she wouldn't touch an omega. Ever. For years she had been nauseous every time she met one. For years she wanted to kill them or to hurt them. For years she had denied her instincts and forgotten.
Steve was supposed to help him feel better, not worse. If he didn't want him then he should have left him to die or whatever. Tony felt like scratching his skin off again, he wanted to hurt the outside as much as the inside hurt. He wanted to feel as ugly outside as he felt inside. He wanted scream out but he couldn't. Each sound got stuck in his throat. "Why?" He managed to ask in a painful, shuddering breath.
His eyes were a little hesitant though and Steve felt like he needed to reassure him so he put his hand on his knee and gently squeezed. Tony inconspicuously shivered but looked at him with a soft smile. "This is one thing my mum did good in her life I suppose..." Tony added in a whispering voice, sounding a little bitter.
Tony smiled and stepped closer, shattering his way in Steve's personal space again. "Yeah. Obviously". He muttered, voice sounding husky. He started kissing his way down Steve's neck, planting soft delicate kisses along his jaw.
They started with the entrance and the kitchen, putting away the small stuff into boxes. Steve was going to donate most of it to diverse charity associations. They mostly worked in comfortable silence, except for when Tony wasn't sure of where to put what or what stickers he should use. Well, Steve worked mostly, because Tony spent most of his time staring dubiously at Steve's kitchen utensils as if he was discovering a new world. Not without making the stupidest comments from time to time, to annoy Steve. Or he would roam around aimlessly like a lost soul, wiping his hands on his jeans helplessly.
First there is James—or Bucky, he isn't sure anymore. James is perfect. His melancholic grayish blue eyes are shining with admiration. His submission is given freely. His loyalty is boundless. He manages the house and their daughter with a fastidious attention that is almost scary. He looks after him with tender loving care, tends to his every need. He has been there for him when Tony was digging the bottom. He has pulled him out, slowly. He soothed the pain. He made sure he ate. He was just there and he gave him love and affection, everything.
Felicia is asleep and Tony is waiting for him on the couch. He climbs next to the alpha and snuggles against him, breathing in a huge whiff of his scent. He starts purring instantly and nuzzles into the alpha's neck. Tony chuckles amusedly and brings a soft hand to his cheek, gently fondling it. He let his hand roam down the alpha's chest, slipping bold fingers between the buttons of his shirt, taking them off one by one until he can slide his hand underneath and play with with hair. His hand hovers over the arc reactor, taking in the warm humming of the blue light. He brings both his knees on the couch and scoots closer to his alpha.
Tony dropped his head in his hand and brought the cigarette to his lips, it wasn't lit though. He didn't inhale, he put it away and sighed and then he drank from his glass. He put the glass down next to him and swallowed painfully. Steve walked closer to him and pushed his boyfriend's nervous right hand away from his mouth. Tony yanked it away. "Don't fucking touch me!"
Tony shrugs, trying to be nonchalant but Steve can see how awkward he feels right now. "Well you've always wanted to try so I thought, you know... We never got the chance to do it in the end and I... I'd like that... I think... If you ever... want to?"
They got started and after some times Steve heard his boyfriend sigh. "This room is a real mess." He exclaimed. "I can't believe you've even got paintings lying around like common garbage." He took one, admiring it with gleeful eyes. "I'm definitely gonna find space in the Penthouse for these." He said with a proud smile.
Tony remained silent at that, at first, and then Steve heard him swallow. "No, I don't think I have..." He answered honestly. "That wasn't the kind of things I did then..."
"Food was amazing by the way." Steve blurted, trying—oh so bravely—to find a way out. "You should try it."
"Good." Steve concluded. "Cause if you're not, I'm warning you, I won't let it go so easily. I'll keep kissing you, and cuddling you, and snuggle against you, until you are. I'm a leech."
When he saw the house he remembered the limo parked outside the school and remembered Tony was loaded. It seemed even more surreal that Tony would ask
At some point they heard the front door slam and they were alone in the house. Tony asked if he could take a shower because "my dad will freak out and ground me if he can smell your alpha scent on me."
Tony looked disappointed but understanding and Steve wondered what he was expecting from him. Was he that badly in need of a friend? Didn't he have friends of his own, already? How was Steve supposed to be that? When he was unsure about himself?
Tony blushes red as Steve's never seen him be. They both look at each other knowingly, smiling embarrassedly in a comfortable silence. Steve takes his hand and entangle their fingers together. "I love you," he whispers and Tony mouthes back a silent "I love you too" while staring into his eyes. Steve's heart swells with love and affection. He can still feel Tony everywhere, on his skin, on every part of his body. He feels surrounded with him and he wonders if Tony feels the same. Tony smells so calm and appeased. It is overwhelming.
Tony didn't need to be asked twice. He had perfectly understood the first time. He dropped on his knees. A weird feeling pooled in his stomach however, something uncomfortable and upsetting.
Steve shook his head silently. His head was already spinning just thinking about it. And so Tony just led him to his living room where there was a huge table on which he had already started working, obviously.
Now, he can feel the alpha's presence overhanging him. He can feel him with his soul before he can sense him physically and now the warmth of his body is electrifying.
Tony and Steve are knotted when he crawls into the bundle of cushions and blankets that their bed has become. The atmosphere is sensuous inside, hot and clammy. The heady, spicy smell burns his nostrils deliciously. He's already drenched in sweat.
Behind him Tony is soft enough to slip out of him and lies down as well, looking at them from afar, catching his breath. He's gonna need a moment before he can knot Bucky the way the omega needs it and therefore it is Steve's duty to take care of the omega and prepare him for the alpha. Luckily, he knows exactly what to do.
"How ruthless and intransigent you can be..." He explained. "Sometimes, I feel like I'm dealing with your father."
Tony didn't make it to the backrooms in the end, instead he headed for the bar. He was in a weird mood tonight. Maybe he was aiming too high? It was already past ten thirty, he hadn't achieved a third of his goal and he was already tired. What was wrong with him? He wasn't even hard. He should be after what he had taken. Should he try to find some viagra?
Steve said he was toxic. Of course he was. He was a mistake, a disease that should have never happened and should be wiped out from the face of the earth, this instant. How could he have thought, even for a moment, that he could ever have this? Steve had almost managed to trick him into thinking he deserved it at some point. Steve was too good, too generous, too loving and Tony had needed him. Tonight more than anything. He had needed him so much. Tony was too needy. He had no right to be, he should disappear.
"I wanna have fun too." Steve said, pressing his face hard into the tiles and then brutally pulling his chin back to face him. "Open your mouth."
Everything was blurry but he knew what to look for. He didn't need the whole picture, just to focus on the relevant details. His hand skimmed over the warm half-naked bodies. He made sure to make eye contact every time. No need for words, he was confident his smile would convey his purpose perfectly.
Sorry about the long pause. I've been having issues with my health recently (nothing serious, don't worry) and I haven't been able to write anything.
Tony was absolutely devastated when Steve broke up with him the first time. How would he survive the second time?
Obie finally let go of him and Tony stared at him in despair. He wasn't feeling well, not at all, and for a moment he thought Obie was cruel to leave him like this. He needed more. Then he pushed this ludicrous idea out of his head. Obie wasn't the one he needed, Steve was. Steve was the one he
Tony smiled and brought his two hands to his face in half desperate, half-frustrated gesture. "Oh my gosh, Steve!" He exclaimed. "How blind can you be? I saw the guy twice and even
Tony laughed. "To New Jersey?" He asked, staring intently at Steve for confirmation. Steve rolled his eyes and sighed. "I knew it!" Tony exclaimed. "I knew that trip had meant something..." He bit his lips, trying to repress a smile, but Steve could see the intense emotions pooling in his eyes.
His boyfriend looked miserable, something dark and forlorn was pooling in his eyes. "I'm so sorry..." He whined. Then Steve finally understood what he was talking about, and the relief almost made him smile.
Steve can't see anything but trouble. Having heats again means living in permanent fear again. Of being pregnant, of losing control, of losing his free will, of... Of being
The omega's gaze was intent and he had both his hands holding Steve's shoulders. "Let them make them. They have no proof. It doesn't matter... Don't worry about it." He relaxed and dropped his head in the crook of Steve's neck, sighing. "You sure this is okay?"
"That's such a beautiful story, Nat." Betty exclaimed. Steve hadn't even noticed she was back. "You two are gonna be great parents."
"This is the last time we're gonna stroll around this neighborhood together." He said nostalgically. "Isn't it weird?"
"But I have to keep you in line." The man said in an ominous tone and then added. "To protect you." Tony nodded again. "Especially from yourself," Obie kept on. "I know you understand."
Steve suddenly felt a weigh in chest, something heavy churning inside. Jealousy prickled at the bottom of his stomach and he felt bile coming up at the back of his throat.
Steve had no idea how long he kept caressing him, he was so fired up that each of Tony's touch brought him deeper into an exulting haze. He gave up control entirely and let Tony play with him.
"I'm too old, James!" The alpha exclaims. "I could be Felicia's grandad, already, that's how old I am. We can't have other pups."
"That you won't break me." He answered truthfully, eyes intent. "That I think I know what I like and what I don't. I do like the sex we have and I like—I like how balanced things are between us but... we could explore a little if you wanted to."
Tony leans against the kitchen counter and stares at the others from afar. He can see Steve, smiling, and thinks he's beautiful. Something clenches in his stomach. He looks down at his empty glass again. "I could do with something stronger..." He croaks out.
They ate the cookies and went back to work. Then they hung out. Tony showed him all the cool things he had told him about. They were... really cool, to say the least. And then Tony asked him if he wanted to stay over. Steve freaked out. If he stayed over he was pretty sure he would do something stupid. He didn't trust himself around Tony and whatever they had been forming for the past couple of month, he didn't want to jeopardize it.
He glanced at his phone quickly but it wasn't Steve. Just his dad's PA. The disappointment almost wore him out. He didn't even read the text. The rest of the afternoon was going to be long.
Steve felt a blush of shame creeping on his face and hide it in his hands again. "Noooo." He protested. "That's not what I meant, I just..."
"It's not like I'm at risk of having lung problems." Steve adds, looking away. Another flush coloring his cheeks.
That thing Steve had felt all evening but was unable to put a finger on. That thing that had loomed over them, unsaid, putrefying,
Steve looked at him in despair and wondered how things had turned so badly so quickly. They were fine, they were happy just hours ago and now everything was falling apart. A freezing shudder ran down his spine.
When his mum got back she threw a pile of condoms to his face. A little shocked, Steve asked her what that was for.
"I'm not fine with it." Steve finally admitted in a calm voice while trying to settle his heart to a none life-threatening rhythm. "It wasn't supposed to be like this..." He tried to justify. "How could I ever know?"
Tony breathed out a whistling huff into Steve's mouth and his eyes flared open. Two dark marbles, pupils blown-out, stared intensely and unsettlingly into his eyes.
The alpha is dozing off. He's gonna need a few days to recover from this but it's alright because he's here and Bucky's here too. Bucky has a hand on his stomach and Steve can feel it, the sudden, poignant need to see his daughter to hold her in his arms. Before he had idea, a vague idea, hints here and there but now he can
Stark and Potts turned around the corner and disappeared, unaware. Steve felt a strong grip on his shoulder, pressing hard on his collarbone. He startled and snapped out of it. He knew who it was before he turned around and was met with soft dark eyes, smiling warmly at him.
Tasting his own blood, and else, wasn't as disgusting as he would have thought at first, and still not the worst thing he had had in his mouth. Once he was used to the smell, Tony wrapped his lips around the head and started licking it clean with unusual eagerness. Obie was extremely gentle this time, tangling his fingers in Tony's hair, caressing him, fondling his neck. His hold was still possessive but in a reassuring and protective way. He complimented him, a lot, until Tony started to moan softly around him, mind finally blank. He kept it slow and unnerving and was soon rewarded with the groans of pleasure of the man he was satisfying. Tony wanted to be good. He needed to be good, at least to someone. So when he felt something warm and liquid springing into his throat and heard Obie mumble lewdly: "Yeah... Come on, boy. Swallow it." while he pressed his head down on his cock, he did.
Steve's heart skipped as he recognized the heat of that husky voice and felt a sweet warmth spreading in his chest and up his neck to his cheekbones. His heart started racing. He opened his eyes and saw the tall silhouette walking away, carrying a pile of books in his hands and looking totally unfazed.
Steve almost moaned into Tony's mouth at first, his feelings and his body going suddenly haywire, before he grumbled and pushed his lover away with a furious glare.
His heartbeat suddenly accelerated. He didn't want to go to the hospital. He couldn't go to the hospital. What would they do to him there? "I'm fine." He protested. Because he was, relatively. His body was, at least. He was still alive he meant, and walking, barely.
"Why did you let me stay if you thought I was messing you around?" He finally asked after a long and cuddly moment of silence.
The question was oddly specific and Steve parted his lips helplessly. He realized that he didn't have any answer to that question. When did he realize Tony was the one? Was Tony
"But that's not when...." He started, unsure, "that wasn't the moment when I—I mean I..." He was stuttering, hesitant, growing more and more embarrassed. "I was just being curious, I think, but... Anyway, when I saw how openly he reacted to me I started teasing him. Frankly, because I was bored and I hated lunch with my parents and something interesting was happening for once. But hum..." He paused again, confused, lost in his own thoughts.
Steve startled, even though he did know what to expect. The odds of such an advanced technology always disconcerted him despite his wild imagination and propensity to visualize the future. Tony had always been too many steps ahead in this department.
"No." Tony rushes to answer, feeling a little caught off guard. Steve never wanted to go public before. Actually he made a point of hiding Tony from the rest of the world as his dirty little secret. "Not at all."
Tony downed his glass quickly and pulled down the window, staring outside, uncharacteristically quiet and fidgety. A cool breeze freshened the compartment and Steve shivered.
Steve startled. "You're never hungry in the morning." He whispered with a croaky, slightly concerned voice, "but you still eat the food..."
Steve stepped back and crossed his arms on his chest. He tapped his foot on the floor, frowning at him. "We didn't plan any lunch date."
Wasn't such a big deal... was it? Nothing that hadn't happened to Tony plenty of times before. He didn't need that much concern and fussing over but Steve didn't seem to be willing to let go. "I'm taking you to the hospital. End of." He insisted, assertive and unyielding, and Tony knew better that try to change his stubborn mind, especially now. When Steve had decided something, there was little he could do to prevent it, so he complied docilely. He was in no condition to fight his boyfriend once again anyway. Tony would rather be waiting for hours in a hospital with Steve than be anywhere else without him.
His funny mood didn't start long as his eyes fell on the student in question. Anthony E. Stark. The name resonated in him, somehow, and Steve snapped out of his daze and sat up from his seat to get a better look at transferred boy. He was annoyingly tall, dark hair, dark eyes, fancy clothes. A dashing smile. A
He finally braced himself and knocked on the door. They were still smiling at each other when the door opened. Natasha rolled her eyes before pulling Steve inside by the collar of his shirt and wrapped him into a hug. She seemed unusually warm and tactile today, Steve would not complain though. She looked happier.
"Steve..." Tony repeats, voice deep and hoarse with want. "What if I were to ask you to stop taking your suppressants and share your heats with me from now on?" Steve keens around the alpha's cock, voice muffled by the hard shaft. His entire body shudders with pleasure and desire alike. "Would you like that?"
Steve brushed his hand underneath Tony's chin and glanced at him sidelong, eyes tired. "You were amazing." He said hoarsely, voice filled with gratitude. "I like it when it's rough too, you know." He smiled at Tony's sheepish face. "I like it when you dominate me. I loved it every step of the way."
Tony is speechless and he can feel an inconspicuous blush creeping on his face. He hates the slightly condescending look in Loki's eyes but at the same time, his touch electrified him. Did Loki just beat him at his own game? He's a little puzzled and he doesn't know what to think anymore and he's much too high anyway.
that guy, after all? What if he hated it? And why did he feel so dirty when Steve was looking at him like that?
Tony's face turned suddenly cold and serious. "I've been raped for half of my life." He said curtly. "And I liked it too."
Tony nodded silently and went back to work, the mood suddenly quiet and studious. Not a word was exchanged but the atmosphere around them felt blissfully warm and soothing. The erratic scratching of Tony's pencil on paper, the only thing Steve could hear. Tony was deeply immersed in his work and Steve spent a long moment contemplating him, unable to focus on anything else. An unsettling warmth pooled in his stomach and spread in his entire body. He let his eyes wander away and observed the garden outside. He could even hear the birds if he paid attention.
With a pang in his chest, he tried to find his way in the huge apartment but couldn't find Tony anywhere and the smell coming from the kitchen was getting painful, not that Steve hadn't lost his appetite at the moment... He was starting to wonder if his boyfriend hadn't just left him hanging when something occurred to him,
He brought a comforting hand to his boyfriend's cheek and caressed his insecurities away, giving him a soft reassuring smile. "I'm glad to be here tonight," he whispered as Tony swiveled his head and took his hand in his to kiss the inside of his wrist. Steve shivered and breathed hard.
He didn't know how he got there but he did. Now he was leaning against the wall, there was an old guy sucking him off. He couldn't see his face, wouldn't be able to even in plain sight, probably, but his hands seemed wrinkled. The guy insisted to lick Obie's cum out of his ass, Tony let him—even though he was still very sore. People were gross, not that he was judging... He did tell him about the blood though, out of concern. At least, he thought he mumbled something like that. He tended to do that now, because of Steve. The uneasiness made a sudden come back and he blacked out. When he was conscious again he was leaning, face up against the wall, and heard himself moan. It almost felt good. He wondered if he would ever be able to do that with Steve. Maybe Steve would like that, even though Tony wouldn't—
" He blurted. "That's what you said then. I still remember your words perfectly and how cold I felt when I heard them."
Tony stared at him silently, with an unconvinced pout on his lips. "Are we fine?" He asked after a long lingering silence.
"On the off-chance that you really needed my help." Steve mumbled in reply. "I saw—" He hesitated, words stuck in his throat. "I saw a glimpse of desperation in your eyes. And I couldn't—" He felt another shiver down his spine. "I couldn't take that risk..." He rasped. "I couldn't let you down. I didn't even think about it, then. I guess, at that time, your well-being meant more to me than my relationship..."
"Can't." Steve deadpanned, staring fixedly at the drops of water seeping down his glass of strawberry milkshake.
Tony leant into him, hiding his face into his neck, and grumbled. "There is something I need to finish tonight."
Tony crosses his arms too and shrugs. "I don't think Steve would like to be Mrs Stark... And we're just—we've just moved in together. Marriage is... so far away from our current life."
"Buck doesn't want to adopt. He's scared I think... He wants a kid of his own. And I'm not sure how I feel about surrogacy... I mean it bothers me a little, ethically speaking."
Or is it the age thing? Loki is about eight years older than him and Steve seems so happy to meet with people that, unlike him, are mature and act like grown-ups. Rhodey reminds him that quite often, thank you. And by the way, he did grow up and he's acting all mature and everything with his boyfriend, he's trying to anyway. And he thinks he deserves people like Rhodey to admit that at least. Anyway, he wouldn't say Loki is the epitome of maturity either, behaviorally speaking he means. Besides, he's never felt that way with Sam, hating him for no reason, he means. Even though Sam has always been hostile to him. He doesn't take it personally. Sam is just being a good friend and overly protective and, honestly, Tony can't blame him. He would even go as far as saying he's glad someone has Steve's back the way Sam does. Doesn't mean that Tony hasn't wanted to punch him in the face once or twice... but Sam doesn't rub him the wrong way like Loki does.
Tony tweeted about the Avengers series, or anything Steve-related, every time a new issue was published or upcoming. He mentioned Steve's deeds, in passing, about every time he talked in public.
He followed his boyfriend like a puppy. Tony was convinced he was born for this exact purpose anyway, following Steve like a puppy. He would follow him to the end of the world, if needed to. He would cut off his own dick if Steve wanted him to. He would slit his own throat if Steve asked him to.
Tony chuckled and dropped his head in his hand, pressing his eye sockets again. "Nothing." He said exasperatedly. "Nothing,
"You've been spending a lot of time with Loverboy lately." Sam noticed. "Should we get worried about your cherry?"
Tony hummed and vibrated as he swallowed him down to the hilt. Steve heard, with delight, the guttural sound Tony made as he swallowed. The head of his cock had passed his throat and he pushed further, staying there. Tony shuddered and his grip on Steve's hips loosened before he finally pulled away, caressing Steve's shaft with his lips and his tongue. He stared up at Steve. His eyes were hazy and grateful and a single, discreet tear was dripping down his cheek.
"Get up." Steve ordered with a low hateful voice but Tony only reacted when Steve jabbed him. "Get up!" Steve repeated with more rage.
It didn't seem to plummet the guy's confidence, however. He inched closer, looking even more impressive up close—he had almost a head on Steve—and his grin spread on his face, even more determined. "You' Steven Rogers?" He asked.
was such a strong word that Tony was pretty sure he knew the definition of. Rape meant being forced to have sex. Rape meant someone had used violence or threats to coerce you into having sex with them. Rape meant you were unwilling. Nothing of the sort had ever happened to Tony.
Steve startled. He could still feel the warmth of his breath on his mouth, the softness of his lips against his, his scent so strong and heady permeating the car. His heart was ready to explode in his chest. His entire body shivered. What had just happened?
For you Torres. Thanks for your undying support, as always. This all for you! (Well, 90% of it is, at least...) ;-) I hope you like it!
Fortunately their host, the real one this time, finally dares showing up at the entrance and Tony snaps out of it. Clint ruffles Steve's hair and gives him a peck on the cheek, a huge happy grin on his face. And then he turns to Tony, his left hand curls around his waist and pulls him toward him while his right hand snatches the bottle cradled in Tony's hands. He kisses him on the corner of his mouth and whispers sensually in his ear. "Thank you baby Stark, you always know how to make me happy." And this is certainly true. Tony knows how to please his hosts and that's partly because he knows Clint very well and Clint has never been shy about sharing his tastes and partly because Tony listens, and observes, and always makes a point to giving people what they want. He thinks he got that from his mother but doesn't dwell on it too much because thinking about her brings back depressive thoughts and he doesn't like being a spoilsport at a dinner party.
"Well, let's talk about that guy, for starters," Clint dabbed into his husband's shoulder, smile gentle. "who's needed
Tony was half-seated on a stool, his back turned to Steve, and held his nth drink in his left hand. His right hand lay on his knee, shaking a little. "What are you doing here?" He asked in a bitter, angry tone.
They got started with animated discussions while Steve wasn't really attentive, lost in his thoughts again. It was not his scene and he felt uncomfortable in his clothes despite knowing how good he looked in them. His eyes traveled aimlessly across the room and fell on them.
"I can't believe you've left all of this here, all this time." He exclaimed as they were taping the boxes. "There's still so much space on our bookshelves that you haven't used."
He wasn't a fool to think that mind-blowing make up sex would be enough to fix all of their problems but at least they were still doing this thing together and the rest they would figure out in time. Steve was ready to compromise and he wasn't giving up, despite everything. He was terrified but he wasn't giving up.
"Yeah. I'm pretty sure homework-doing is happening a lot." Clint exclaimed crudely while doing an obscene gesture with his hand and mouth.
"I err..." He stuttered. "I guess Tony made quite the impression on me when I first met him but... I don't know, things have been... so
Steve's voice is a little hoarse when he asks, probably pushing a hand onto the phone's speaker to smother the sound so Clint wouldn't hear their conversation. "You
"No, actually." Tony said matter-of-factly, rummaging through the box. "As much as it might sound weird to you... I've never really been into that. I mean shoving cold and rigid plastic things up my own ass is not something that particularly turns me on.  I like anal sex, like
Tony chuckled softly, eyes mocking. "It's for a good cause." He said with a gentle, slightly husky voice.
Tony let out an exhausted laugh and leant his forehead against Steve, catching his breath. "I can't." He croaked out with a self-deprecating smile. "I can't hold it for that long—I can't carry you that long... You're too fucking heavy, Rogers."
His head starts spinning and his clearheadedness is ebbing away. Bucky lets it go completely. He lets himself glide down the slope, reaching the blissful headspace in which heat places them, enjoys the
His boyfriend wiped the corner of his eye. Was he crying? Why would Steve cry? Was it Tony's fault? It must be his fault. It always was. Tony never meant to make him cry though. And the answer to that question was simple and self-evident. Steve knew that answer. Why would he ask? Unless things had changed between and Tony hadn't noticed. Was too drunk to remember...  "Because you're my boyfriend?" He asked hesitantly, because he was, wasn't he? "And I wanted to sleep with you?"
She smiled and went back to examining him. "Have you been experiencing headaches since you regained consciousness? Pain? Tingling in your limbs? Dizziness? Nausea? Sight problems? Memory loss? Temporary paralysis...? The list was never-ending.
"I don't wanna work from here Tony!" Steve exclaimed, finally letting his feelings out. "I like it at SHIELD. I like the spirit, the rivalry, the ambiance..."
"In your dreams, Daddy." Steve joked from the window where he was sitting in front of a canvas on an easel. A gift from Tony. His tone was amused and his eyes were playful. And God he was beautiful with the sunlight reflecting on his blond hair.
Tony's expression softened. "You sure?" He asked worriedly, a glimpse of shame flashing through his eyes. "I mean—"
Steve soft hands slide up around his neck and he tiptoes to catch Tony's mouth into a hot and wet languorous kiss. Everything inside Tony turns into mush and he's on fire again. his boyfriend tiptoeing to claim him is just the hottest thing ever.
Suddenly, Steve remembered all those things Tony had said or done that seemed to appear in a completely different light, now. "You were talking about us, weren't you?"
"You know I think, maybe, I'd like to try to bottom anyway." Steve admitted, fingers entangled with Tony's.
"I'm pretty sure they can survive one hour without you. I would even bet they could survive for a whole afternoon."
pup, maybe with Steve's. Maybe both of them will be pregnant after this. It's happening, he feels tears of joy running down his cheeks. Or maybe those are Steve's as he's begging, raw and needy, hungry for the alpha's knot. Bucky can feel the urgent, overpowering
It was funny at first because when they walked to class hands in hands, people were confused. They would move aside and let them pass and avert their eyes. Tony is so tall and athletic, confident, and aggressive in his stance, only the ones who already know about him can see the inconspicuous vulnerability flashing through his eyes sometimes, or the imperceptible way he flinches instinctively when an alpha or a assertive beta growls around him or tries to impress him. He's built a persona, he has learnt to fight back over the years and never lets people put him down. In so many ways he's much more alpha than Steve would ever be.
Then he heard some noise outside and noticed the light so he got out of the bedroom and saw Tony on a stool, a cigarette in his right hand and another glass next to him.
Steve though, stared at him studiously, considering the offer. He felt suddenly curious about it, about touching someone else's dick. Something inside him
He jumped on his feet, walked over to him and squatted on his crotch, straddling him. He caught his startled face between his hands to give him a passionate kiss. Tony was surprised at first and stumbled backwards, catching himself on one arm and supporting both their weight but soon he melted into the kiss and groaned softly into Steve's mouth, his tongue warm and mellow and eager to respond to Steve's forwardness.
Steve was honestly quite proud of his surprise. Breakfast looked amazing, despite the winter cold. He had set up a large blanket and several cushions. There was extra heating too. He had brought pancakes, toasts and bagels. There were jam and cheese and fruits. A thermos of coffee and one of milk. Fruit juices and freshly made pastries. He had even cooked bacon and scrambled eggs that he had kept warm next to the heater.
After he pulled himself together, he picked up the remains of Tony's glass and cleaned up. Then he drank some water, to rehydrate. Then he tried to read a little and take his mind off things, and then watched some TV, tried to sleep, toss and turned and almost cried again out of exhaustion. Nothing could distract from the heavy twinge in his chest.
That's a big fat lie. Never mind. It's not like Steve cares about what he's doing at work. Everything he does is a bore
"Oh. He remembers!" Steve snarked, making sure Tony remembered how much of an asshole he had been tonight from the tone of his voice. Tony swallowed and shut his mouth. What could he say anyway?
"Definitely." Betty agreed. "I never thought we—" She took Bruce's hand in hers. "—would finally happen, but we did." She gave him a fond smile.
He felt his heart squeeze tighter to the point it became difficult to breathe. His first feeling was disappointment. First because it was news to him that there was a workshop in the Tower. Steve knew there was an entire R&D floor in which Tony often spent times, but he hadn't heard of a private workshop and Tony had deliberately kept him out of it. Secondly, it was the first time Tony ditched him like that. Soon though, the disappointment turned into anger. Tony had been such a drama queen and sulking in the workshop was just the most immature reaction Tony could ever have and just... Fuck! Steve just
Steve was speechless. His heart started racing and he felt like a complete asshole. "Tony, I'm—" He whispered, words stuck in his throat. "I'm so sorry." His boyfriend seemed to be in a forgiving mood, however, because he just smiled and cupped his face to give him a slimy kiss on the corner of his mouth.
He's partly horny, partly amused and his smiling breath tickles Steve's neck at first but soon, the omega's ministrations start sparkling desire through Steve's body. Bucky likes to tease and keeps kissing the sensitive skin of his neck, biting him softly, sending spikes of pleasure through him. Heat starts pooling at the bottom of his stomach. Steve gets easily hard and Bucky's grip on his hips is strong, his hands run up and down his sides, growing more intense and eager. Bucky wriggles behind him, snuggling and grinding against his back. He keeps nuzzling into his neck and Steve starts humming, getting intoxicated with the heady smell of omega arousal permeating the room. He leans into the touch and closes his eyes, dropping his head back on the omega's shoulder. He lets himself go limp into his embrace, body on fire. Bucky's hard-on is poking at his lower back.
The conversations were rather idle as they were finishing the main course. Sam ate silently, obviously starving, while Steve was asking about the shop. When they were done, Natasha stood up again, holding her drink in her hand. Something tender and pleased glinted in her eyes, she was almost blushing. Everyone turned to her, waiting for her to speak but she remained silent and sat back on her chair while putting a hand on Sam's shoulder. All eyes were on her, hung up on the movements of her lips.
It doesn't happen right away. They wait. Steve needs some time. He needs to get his head around it and Tony is understanding. There is a difference between imagination and reality. The gap is huge sometimes. Tony settles down first, he will stay here two nights in a row. That's a first. They take their time, have something to eat, cuddle, a lot, watch TV together, fingers intertwined and they kiss and kiss and kiss again, exploring each other's body.
And he's still there for the same reason. He doesn't have a choice. On paper, James belongs to him. His life belongs to him. His death belongs to him. His well-being belongs to him, his misery as well. Whoever wrote those fucking laws, Tony pukes on their graves. Whoever still enforce those laws today, he despises them from the bottom of his heart and soul.
It was perfect. More than Steve could ever asked for. Better than he had ever dreamed of. There wasn't only art supplies, there were also... stuff. Inspirational stuff. And models and books and all kinds of items that would help Steve in his work.
They talked about it, the three of them together, and this time Steve saw no objection and encouraged Tony to take care of it. He didn't want another stranger to hurt his friend. He felt no hard feeling or jealousy about it, strangely. He was already very surprised to be invited into the decision process. Bucky was Tony's Omega and he had legally every right on his life. Steve had absolutely no say in it, really, and didn't expect to, but they still involved him as if his opinion was crucial. Steve didn't make any objections. What truly bothered him, in fact, was that the decision didn't seem to rejoice either of them.
What was supposed to happen then happened, as expected. Steve slapped him, hit his head against the wall, smashed his face into the bricks. It hurt, a little. But if Steve was expecting him to cry and to beg him to stop he could always wait. There was nothing Steve could do to him that hadn't already been done to him tenfold. Tony waited. Of course, probably, in theory, he could defend himself and push Steve away. Except he didn't. He never did. He just waited. If Steve wanted to hurt him, if his dad wanted to hurt him, if Obie or some random guy wanted to hurt him then so be it. Tony's whole existence was meant for that purpose anyway.
Bucky's breathing hitched and he gasped, unconsciously parting his lips. "Fine. One kiss. No tongue. And we're done."
Tony pulled on his gloves, screwed his beanie on his head, leaving his hair falling over his forehead which highlighted the reddish color of his stubbled cheeks, and snuggled inside his coat. Then he blew white puffs of hot breath on his gloved hands to warm up and stared at the sky, grinning sheepishly, while waiting for Steve to get ready as well.
"Oh yes." Tony rasped, mouth already reaching for Steve's neck. Steve shivered. His cock jolted in his pants, he was almost dripping already. His entire body was burning. Tony wasn't fair at all. They hadn't seen each other for four days at least.
Steve straightened up on shaky legs, a little shaken by the whole thing. He watched his boyfriend's back walking away from him with a growing uneasiness settling in his heart. "'m gonna take a shower." Tony grumbled.
He made a clumsy attempt at laughing it out and straightened up on his seat, inching back from Steve's personal space. "Okay." He said with an undecipherable smile and Steve felt another pang of guilt clenching his heart. They were his friends and they meant well he supposed but Steve just wasn't an omega doll you could just play around with like a puppet, nor some kind of experiment. No matter how exciting it seemed to be able to get your hands on a male omega. He felt another twinge in his heart and turned away from Tony, sulking a little.
"It's alright Steve, you didn't know." Tony whispered reassuringly while petting Steve's head. "You were confused. I get it."
"Mr Rogers, you once said in an interview that Iron Man was one of the most complex character you ever created. What do you think about the theories that say you based our favorite antihero on you current boyfriend, aka Tony Stark?"
There were flashes and a huge crowd and Steve should have expected it but every time it happened, he was just as helpless and unprepared as he was the first time.
As the minutes went by Steve's gaze wandered up his arm and his shoulder. He stared at his back, not as muscular as a quarterback's but decently muscular for a teenager his age. Besides, he didn't seem to be the type, not like Steve knew anything. Just a feeling. Again. Anthony E. Stark—Steve already liked the sound of the name in his mouth—didn't look like a jock at all. Maybe that was a thing they had in common. Maybe that was the reason behind this weird connection he seemed to have been feeling since the boy's arrival.
"What I mean is..." Steve carries on. "It's okay for you to get smashed and smoke pot once in while. You're allowed not to be perfect and It's okay if you fail sometimes." He grins proudly, probably at Tony's startled face. "I don't
Tony burst out laughing. "How can you not smell it on me? The confusers don't work when aroused." Now that he was saying it, it was so obvious it was almost painful. Tony's scent was so sweet and enrapturing, Steve was overwhelmed. "I thought you knew, I mean, I'm not
His boyfriend interrupted him again by kissing his neck, drawing a gasp out of Steve. He grabbed both his wrists and pushed him against the bar behind them. Steve's back hit the bar and it hurt a little. He gasped again and parted his lips. He had never seen his boyfriend so angry and so out of control before, at least not directed at him. He realized how strong he was, way stronger than him. Tony could manhandle him like a puppet. Steve hated that a little and at the same time, he thought that was really hot, but maybe that was the alcohol talking. Tony's mouth was on him again, devouring him, and Steve instinctively wrapped his arms around him.
His boyfriend was ready. When Steve stopped and straightened up on his knees, Tony propped himself in a jerk and looked at him with hazy eyes. "I wanna fuck you." He husked out.
Steve slipped under the cover and spooned his boyfriend, wrapping dirty-intentioned arms around him. His hands slowly and gently enlaced around his boyfriend. One hand slipped underneath his head, in the small space between his neck and the pillow, the other curled around his hip and started roaming aimlessly up and down his torso, splayed on the hard muscles of his chest. Tony stirred again and groaned, wriggling against Steve. The latter planted a soft kiss right behind his boyfriend's ear and Tony twitched and gasped with the sensation, still half-asleep.
Tony managed to sit up somehow and threw his arms around Steve's neck, needing the contact at all cost. He buried his face into his neck, seeking the warmth and comfort of his boyfriend's smell. "Thank you..." He whispered, with what was left of his voice  "You're my hero..."
Steve said, smiling mirthlessly. "Well if that's so, then I guess I really should apologize for interrupting you guys."
Tony walked to him and grabbed his hand. He tugged on it. "Come on, Rogers. Put on your clothes and let's get out. I'm sure you're hungry."
Then he grabbed his ass and heaved him up, pressing his back against the wall. Steve curled his arms and legs around him. Tony pushed him against the wall as he held his own cock and slowly but surely Steve sank down onto his shaft. "Yeah, baby." Tony husked out. "Fuck yourself onto my cock."
Tony feels very close to his friend suddenly. They have probably always been close in hindsight. They understand each other. Tony would give up so much for Steve if he didn't stop himself.
"Same difference." Steve replied bluntly. "You haven't told me you hooked up with Nat either. You see, there's a lot of things we've been keeping from each other apparently."
He rolls his eyes but doesn't contradict him. He has learnt early in his life that contradicting frontally your alpha never brings anything good in life. He should take a more subtle approach."I still want to share my heats with you." He husks out, snuggling against him. He's sure his smell is already conveying his message clearly. The closeness between them is already making his head spin. His body vibrates against the warmth of the alpha.
," he adds. "We'll always be slaves to our nature and the only moments I feel free is when I'm with the two of you. It's
Tony had a strange moment of reluctance. He didn't know why but his first reflex was to clench his fist and grit his teeth in an illusive protest. Obie must have seen the fire in his eyes, his response was immediate. Tony suddenly felt a strong and dominant slap on his face. One meant to hurt. Enough to slap the last of his reluctance away, to remind him whom he belonged to. His face was yanked on the side, turning his eyes away. His cheek burnt.
Tony lets him unbutton his pants and fumble with his fly. He spreads his legs a little but lets him handle the rest. Bucky takes a huge whiff of the alpha's scent before he frees his cock from its prison. He wants to take things slow, warming him slowly, letting him relax and maybe later the alpha will be in better dispositions for some more talking. Bucky still has a few tricks in his bag.
"No, of course not." Steve was sarcastic again and it sounded awful in his voice. "Why would I be? It's not like I had better things to do than roaming around the city at night to come and rescue your shitty self. This is what I do, right? I save the day!"
Clint turns to him and stares at him questioningly, expression confused at first. "I thought you quit."
It was only half past nine, his heart skipped a beat. Tony politely excused himself and put his jacket on. He straightened up, wavered a little with the pain, Obie didn't hold him back. He could finally get the fuck away and have his smoke.
"Are you gonna make coffee?" Tony said in the distance, tone a little too presumptuous, leaving Steve do all the work.
"You're taking too much liberty, Tony." Obie justified himself. "You're an adult now. Your insolence stopped being cute."
Tony finally got up on his feet. He was probably still half-hard, judging from the bump in his skinny jeans. "I'm taking you out to lunch." He said in a very serious tone, not taking no for an answer.
Bucky can feel it, it hits him like a tsunami. He stumbles forward, sprawled on the alpha's back. Tony is feral and Bucky licks the bleeding scratches on his back and rubs his hard dick between his legs, stroking his tight, sore balls in the process. Tony stills and straightens up, falling backwards into his embrace. He reclines his head on Bucky's shoulder and Bucky curls his metal arm around his chest, pressing him against him. The alpha releases his grip on Steve's left hip and reaches the back of Bucky's head, raking his fingers into his long hair.
"Sam was really cool about it, right away. I would have done it with or without him but I'm really happy we decided to do this thing together, despite our odd situation."
Tony followed them inside. He gave her the bottle with a certain hesitancy that was very uncharacteristic. "Here," he said softly, "for you—I mean
And Tony isn't talking about a surname. It's much more than that but Clint understands, he thinks, because he nods silently, pinching his lips with a certain seriousness in his expression. He curls his arms around him and brings him closer to him, nuzzling against his neck a little. "You know what I'm thinking?" He says hoarsely. "I'm glad you could make it tonight. It feels like forever since the two of us could talk like this."
Steve huffed out a shocked gasp. "You lied to my face." He choked out but still felt a happy grin creeping on his face at the same time. It seemed it didn't really matter anymore.
"I haven't cleaned it up so you can taste yourself." Obie said joyfully, obviously proud of himself. His cock was dirty indeed, smeared with—mostly—blood. So
smile, perfect teeth all rightfully aligned—a promise for the best and the worst—and a mischievous twinkle in his playful eyes that made Steve's heart skip a little.
He felt suddenly terribly, terribly lonely. Alone, abandoned and helpless in a way he hadn't felt in a long long time. Not since he was still a child.
And Steve felt a little hot all over and his heart didn't seem to want to stop racing and beat hard in his chest, covering the weird sensation of butterflies that seemed to be fluttering at the pit of his stomach.
Tony cringed. "Yeah, you did." He said with a nod, smiling a little. "You kinda did. Not that I'm complaining, though. Guy's so decent, I couldn't even compete..."
His eyes roamed the room and he stared at the audience. Everyone looked as perplexed at the news, except Clint who grinned goofily like a proud uncle. Obviously Clint already knew, Bucky didn't though. Steve's eyes glided toward Tony who was sitting on Clint's left. Tony had a profoundly melancholic smile. His eyes were soft and gentle, a certain happy confidence in his expression. He didn't look surprised either but not because he had been in the know, more that his suspicions got finally confirmed. He was staring at the future parents with a deep mix of pride, happiness and something else Steve wasn't sure to recognize...
For a moment he forgets about everything else. He forgets about Felicia. About James. About the betrayal, about the hurt. It's only him, and Steve. Just like it used to be. No. Nothing like it used to be. It never was so honest, so open and genuine between them. For a moment he can feel Steve's heart beating in unison with his own. Connected forever. For a moment he can feel what Steve feels and he stares at the pulsating gland on his neck, wondering if it's only his imagination or if he can really feel the sweet burning pain throbbing on his own neck.
They do it again, and then they switch roles and try new things, exploring every thing they didn't have the chance to before. Steve wants to take as much of Tony as he can before his boyfriend leaves for Boston.
Tony still pushes Steve away, hands on each side of him, clutching his bony shoulders. He holds him with strength and determination and pushes his way into Steve's house. Then, with a hesitant smile he grabs a plastic from the floor and holds it preciously between his hands, in Steve's direction. He's all flustered and Steve feels overwhelmed by a surge of affection.
by the way, and opens it. The contents of it almost make him blush. He's not being a prude, he just never expected this and the huge collection of sex toys, some of them
"It's not going to work unless you swallow some of them, are you sure you wanna do that?" He said while laughing hard and watched Tony pull them out of his mouth one by one with a satisfied smug.
"All right." She said mildly convinced by Tony's explanation. "So everything that happened to you tonight happened with your full consent?"
Steve entered and Tony held him a welcoming hand. "Come." He said while gesturing Steve to follow him inside. The interior of Tony's house was superbly  posh and Steve silently marveled at the works of art that he could see all around him. Tony noticed anyway and chuckled softly. "Shall I give you a tour?"
Steve pouted and stared at his boyfriend sidelong, unjustly annoyed. " 'course you can," He muttered with a tinge of spite in his voice. "Don't take me for a fool. Even without SI you can..."
Steve raised his eyes to him and stared into his dark eyes. His heart skipped. Tony was smiling again. A shy, insecure but gentle smile.
it. It's great that you found fulfillment through paternity and I'm happy for you, really, but that's not for me and it will never be. I'm not wired that way."
Tony chuckles while clutching his empty glass. Maybe his hand trembled a little. "I don't do that..." he replies while shaking his head, "anymore." At least, it hasn't happened for quite a while now.
Tony grazed the skin of his neck with his teeth, making Steve forget about everything else for a minute. "Of course they will," he said, lips curled into a smile against his skin. "That's why it's fun!"
"No thanks." Steve replied while looking out the window, feeling something churn in his stomach. Booze didn't suit him well.
Steve startled and looked at his boyfriend disappointedly. He was breathing hard and his shoulders and chest heaved heavily. Steve had to face the facts, Tony was out of breath. One must be realistic, fantasies were rarely practicable in real life. Tony slowly caught his breath and brushed gentle fingers on his cheek. "I'm sorry." He mumbled while kissing him and chuckled softly against his lips. "I'll make it up to you, I promise."
sooner. You asked me once if you were my first. You weren't my first. I've had other alphas. Not that much but enough to know the difference. I've been claimed before Tony, but you're the only one I've wanted back. I used to blame it on the bond but it's not the bond that made me fall in love with you. It's the other way around. I
He stares back up at Loki when he can feel the slight brush of his knuckles on his cheek. Loki is smiling gently at him. "You're really very cute Tony Stark." He says with an amused glint in his eyes. He glances behind Tony for half-second. "You and Steve make a sweet couple. I'm happy for you."
He regretted bitterly after only a few yards, when he started retching and gasping for air, his lungs burning as if scorched from the inside. His head started spinning with the lack of oxygen. He fumbled in his pockets and finally found his inhaler before passing out. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a few seconds as he felt the medicine work his lungs open. It was just in his head the sensation but that was how he felt it. When he opened his eyes things were less blurry and he could see the school from afar. A black limo was parked at the entrance, quite peculiar, he noted, for the neighborhood they were in, but he didn't dwell on it. He packed in inhaler and resumed running, feeling again the air burning his throat and his ribs constrict as if pressing his lungs until they were useless.
Knotting James a second time is gloriously amazing. It's mind-blowing. And Tony will knot him again, and again until both of them lose the notion of time and place.
Since the alpha seems a bit lost, the omega takes things in hand. He appears in front of Steve lithely, feline and seductive. Hands on the his hips, Bucky trails the tip of his nose along Steve's shoulder, nuzzling into his neck, scenting him. It's electrifying, unnerving. It drives him crazy.
They were soon joined by another overbearing alpha, snickering behind them, so full of shit. Another strong grip on his second shoulder. Being short sucked.
Natasha smiled too, a fond smile on her lips. Thor was his usual ecstatic and nonchalant self. Sam was the only one among their friends who didn't smile.
He did wonder what was so detestable about him that even someone like Obie wouldn't want him and ignored his stomach churning and the bile coming up in his throat.
Steve wasn't able to answer because Tony barely let him breathe and kissed him again, very softly, lovingly. He kissed again and again, until Steve's body was a furnace in his strong embrace, a bundle of lust and need.
Tony almost swallowed his water down the wrong way. He spilt some of it in his panicked gesture and answered with a wrecked hoarse voice. "Yes."
Steve buried his head in the fabric of his shirt and hummed in response, breathing in his heady sweaty smell.
Steve swallowed and wetted his lips. "I guess I never finished decorating in the end." He said in a croaky voice. "I think I never truly settled down." He explained. "Like it's always been transitory in my head. I was always waiting for something, somehow." He paused, rejecting upon what he had just blurted out. "Maybe you were after right after all.... It wasn't me. It's never been me, this place. I never truly felt home here, not the way I feel home in the penthouse and perhaps..." he hesitated. "Perhaps, it was because I wasn't really myself then..."
"You're scared that it's gonna be so amazing that you're gonna love it too much and lose your own mind."
Besides, he really wanted to see his boyfriend. After all, Steve hadn't broken up with him yet. Not explicitly anyway. If he had, Tony could still pretend he didn't know. Maybe Steve's presence would help soothing the growing uneasiness he felt inside. A surge of excitement grew rapidly in stomach. He felt restless. His knees started to shake nervously under the table. He had to find a way to go.
"It was just friendly." Natasha explained, face flushed. "We asked about each other from time to time, nothing more—"
"Having a crush on an alpha doesn't make you omega." Sam added, always wisely. "It just makes you attracted to alphas."
Tony would give him a furtive glance then and displayed a sly smirk. He would still be a little flustered and unguarded, but only Steve could see it. And as they both walk into the classroom, not late enough to get Fury annoyed but enough for everyone to suspect what they were doing, Steve's heart swelled with love, bliss and alpha pride.
"I'm going to the pool." James says with a soft and sensual voice. "Watch over her?" His eyes shine with something malicious and his hand lingers on Tony's shoulder, warm and penetrating. "I'm heading out." He says before Tony could answer.
Bucky snapped his fingers on his face and he snapped out of it. "Stevie. Stop drooling, will you? You're kinda obvious right now."
If dying wasn't scaring him much, losing his brain abilities, on the other hand... It was everything Tony cherished about himself. He shivered at thought. "You might not care about losing your own life," the doctor said bluntly, "but if you do it that way, someone's gonna have to pay for it. I hope you realize that, Gregory."
Tony's face changed colors as Steve spoke while he slowly realized what Steve meant and he stared at him with wide-opened eyes. "You want me to top?" He exclaimed surprisedly. Steve looked into his eyes with a mix of anxiety, desire and confusion. "I mean, yeah... I can do that but..." Tony muttered hesitantly, "I've never topped an alpha before."
He pulls on the railings, stretching his legs, and looks down. The height is dizzying. His head is spinning anyway. He's still drunk and stoned and the combination doesn't seem to suit him well tonight. He's restless and queazy. There's a growing lump in his throat, he feels like crying it out but stops himself and feels like a failure. He looks down again and lets the void absorb him. He's got trouble keeping his breathing steady. He sounds a little panicky. He wants to jump. It's a recurrent thought. One he had for decades. Not a thing he would ever act on though. It's just the idea of it, of jumping off and be free, feel the fresh air hurting his lungs and blinding his eyes, feel the gravity and air pressure on all his limbs. He wishes he could jump out and fly away but he knows that in the real world, not suit of armor will catch him in flight.
He shivers from head to toe and feels jolts of electricity run down his spine to the tip if his—rock hard—cock. All his senses are going haywire. And Steve's intense gaze is staring at him relentlessly.
"Okay." She said with a non-judgmental tone and noted everything Tony said down and then she kept asking him questions that Tony answered mechanically but didn't make any comments, Tony didn't either. That was relieving at least. Then she asked, "can you give me your arm? I'm gonna take a few samples of your blood for the tests. You'll have the results in a few days." He rolled up the sleeve of Steve's too small hoodie and showed her the inside of his right elbow without a word. Then, after explicitly asking for his consent, she took samples of the inside of his mouth, from his skin and from his hair—everywhere where there might still be traces from his partners, Tony supposed—and put them in tubes conscientiously. She was very gentle and nice and when she was done she patted him and smiled. "All done," she said. "The doctor will see you in a minute, to examine you. Are you gonna be alright, Gregory?"
"I've been wanting you to bite me from the moment you stopped trying," Steve replies, voice raspy and broken at the edges. "No, scratch that. I've been wanting to be yours since our third time together."
even. Tony likes that very much, he feels dazed. There's a thread of saliva connecting them when Steve's pulls out and he licks it off his lips before giving him another smile, slightly lustful this time.
The pressure of Steve's hand on his arm relaxes and he slips his clammy hand into Tony's. "I miss you, Tony. I miss us."
what I said, babe!" Steve shouted frustratingly. "I was upset. I was angry and frustrated because you won't fucking
The omega tenses against his back and inches back, away from Steve, loosening his embrace around him. He leans his forehead between Steve's shoulder blades. His breathing changes, his heartbeat accelerates.
He thought he was better than that. It used to be less lonely. He had known, from the moment he had set a foot in this tower. Before even, in the plane on his way here, when Steve's silent tears kept flowing down his cheeks. Or maybe it was out there, in the freezing cold of that disused Hydra base in Siberia, the moment their eyes met, the moment Captain America's shield broke down the armor. That moment, frozen in space, so short and infinite at the same time. It was then that he understood the invisible and yet so powerful bond that tied the omega to the alpha. Right then and there, he had known he would just be in the way.
He ordered his drink and struggled to stutter what he wanted with his gruff broken voice. His eyes were probably slightly unfocused because when he handed his cash, his hand was about two feet away from the waitress. The nasty brunette took his tip with a hateful glare. Tony might have been a little insistent, also he might have insulted her. He couldn't help it, she turned him on. Whenever she looked at him with that much hatred and despise, he felt the urge to push her down on her counter and fuck the shit out of her. On the upside, he was glad his dick was finally back to life. He glanced on the side, his gaze met with those of the brunette's coworker. His face looked vaguely familiar. Had they had sex already? Tony would be surprised if he remembered, he didn't think he remembered half of the people he had messed around with in his trashy life. It was fairly probable they happened though. The guy was hot with his slightly punk ways, even if his face was average. Besides, Tony liked blonds. He didn't dwell on it though, had much better things to do.
He was so handsome, Steve thought. A surge of profound feelings of love flushed through him, overwhelming. How much he loved that man, it was almost painful at times. He should stop intellectualizing things, he knew that, but couldn't stop himself. He wondered why, after all those years, he still loved him like the early days, still desired him like a horny teenager. His heart still beat crazily whenever their eyes met.
He tilted his head on the side. "My hero..." He whispered when Steve knelt down next to him. Oh how he wanted Steve's hands on him right now. He would gladly die for Steve to touch him.
"I owe you an explanation, Tony." Tony swallowed at the other end of the phone. "But maybe, we should talk in person?" Steve paused, trying to analyse Tony's reaction but he got none. "Are you free?"
Steve made a quick job of getting ready for bed and dived in delight in the soft sheets of Tony's huge bed. He felt so small in this bed. He could hide in it and was pretty sure no-one would notice, but he loved it. He loved the huge space, he loved the pillows, he loved the memory form mattress, he loved the softest of soft sheets but most of all he loved how they smelt of Tony. Steve had always had the bestest sleep in this bed with or without Tony in it. He spread like a starfish under the never-ending comforter and gazed at the empty space beside him, running a tired hand on where he could still feel Tony's shape on the mattress. He had been coming here enough for each of them to have a side now. He smiled to himself at the knowledge and looked forward to wake up next to him as he quickly fell asleep.
On his way out he crossed path with his boyfriend who barely gave him an annoyed glance before hitting the shower himself, his jaw still had the tense tremor of anger. Tony felt like crying again. He felt like throwing up again. His heart twinged, squeezing so hard in his chest it cut his breathing short.
He remained planted there for a moment, stunned, his body shaking a little—what the fuck had just happened?—but then he snapped out of it and rushed to another bathroom to shower as well, feeling distressed.
"So what about you, Tony?" Sam suddenly asked with much more defiance in his tone that he let everyone show. Steve felt mad at him. He knew Sam had always been wary of Tony but seriously, that wasn't the time nor the place to push him into a corner.
He wasn't sure if it was dark-haired guy who had made him leave or if he had gotten bored with Tony's lack of interest but he no longer had a mouth on his cock and felt cold. Dark-haired guy slid his hand down his chest, pressing his knuckles into the hollows of his abs, and slipped his fingers into his pants, grabbing his dick in relief. He gave it a few strokes, reducing the distance between them. Tony closed his eyes and let the guy take control. He bit his bottom lips and hummed softly, relishing in the pleasure of it. He forgot everything else. That was the exact reason Tony was doing this, he thought, to forget.
It's Steve. And his boyfriend wraps himself around him silently and presses his head on his back, right between his shoulder blades. He says nothing but his hands curl around Tony's sides and squeeze him tight.
Clint gives him a dubious look. "Never?" He repeats skeptically, crossing his arms on his chest with that same unsettling certainty about them. He is standing very close to Tony and their shoulders touch. It feels warms.
—they broke up, Steve wouldn't have anything to himself but a pile of cash and a lot of regrets. But neither of them made any comment about it. His decision was made.
A surge of rage ran throughout his body and made him shudder. How he had managed to keep enough self-control not to punch the smug smile off the bastard's face was still a mystery to him. Maybe that was those invisible shackles that restrained him. His could feel his hands shake and ground his teeth to subdue the slight tremor in his jaw. He was glad his body had been drained of any tears for years for once, because surely Howard would have loved seeing them prickle at the corner of his eyes.
He needed something better than coke, that lasted longer. He was thinking GHB or crystal meth, best when you were planning to indulge in sex, especially the kind of sex Tony wanted to indulge in right now. Tony hoped it would hurt. He hoped he would feel it for days afterwards, maybe that the sex would
The hand pressed harder, making Tony's head spin with the lack of air, and pulled his head up until he had to tiptoe for his feet to keep touching the ground. He was completely at the man's mercy, his life literally between his hands. Indeed, theoretically, he could probably escape this situation. Theoretically, he was strong enough to free himself from the man's grasp, except... he
Tony turned his head on the side, avoiding Steve's stare, smile bitter on his lips. He shook his head, anger still shaking his limbs. "I don't want you to sell your place, Steve!"
The beginning of a soft smile appeared on Tony's face. His eyes shone a with warm affectionate glow and he followed Steve to the rooftop without a word.
Steve's cheeks flushed red and started burning. "He's doing really great, for the record. Talked to him recently. Has a boyfriend. Long-term. Four years or something. Job's amazing. I did apologize and we're
Tony only answered with a smile and he kissed him again. This time a little more confidently. "I like you." He whispered on Steve's lips, a soft chuckle escaping his throat while he curled his arms around Steve's and hugged him, nesting his head in the crook of his neck. Steve felt like the king of the world with the alpha's heart beating steadily against his chest and his warmth and enrapturing scent enveloping him protectively. He wrapped his arms around him and enjoyed the moment for a short while, before whispering into his ear.
"I swear I don't!" He defends himself. Tony has never been into plastic. He likes the warmth of another human being too much. "Steve might have a couple of them, I don't know... we never use them together."
Steve opened wide eyes to him and stared at his boyfriend in puzzlement. His features were strained and exhausted. He had dark circles under his eyes and looked ten years older. He grabbed his glass and Steve's eyes flickered to it. He noticed his hand was bandaged.
The omega looks debauched. His lips are swollen, his eyes are hazy and his hair is still damp with sweat. He looks exhausted but still excited, heated and stimulated by his unending mating session, his scent mingled with the alpha's. His body is burning against him and his gaze is intense and his lips are wet and passionate. Felicia starts crying but he can't move. The omega smells like slick and cum and sex and pushes hard and holds him tight against the wall. His grip is shaking but strong. He breathes into his mouth. Bucky freezes. His dick hardens and slick starts wetting his insides, induced by the alpha scent pervading the room, everywhere where Steve has been.
Clint smiles gently and puts a warm hand on his shoulder. "I wasn't talking about kids anyway... but the two of you, finally tying the knot. When are you gonna propose?"
to be seen in public together!" He laughed, smile wide on his face. "We can't stop making everything about us..."
"And what makes you so sure you're omega and not a beta or an alpha attracted to other alphas." He croaked out, voice a little hoarse. "It happens..."
Tony glanced at their surroundings. He was in front of a gay club. Obie was really pushing the joke far, but fine. Whatever. He threw his papers into the car and only kept his cash and nameless credit cards, and of course, his phone. He slammed the door close and stared blandly at the car driving off.
He didn't deserve nice, so never mind, he would still take this. It would take his mind off things at least and it would feel good, maybe. Sucking Obie's cock, when he wasn't thinking about Steve, was comforting like coming back home. Well, when Tony said 'like coming back home' he really meant it as a general reference, not that coming back to
Tony's excited rambling resumed as soon as they were out of the room. He dragged Steve out of the museum, as if nothing had happened. He put his felt coat on enthusiastically, already going on about their dinner to come, spewing nonsense. Steve was still amazed at Tony's capability to maintain such a dense conversation for so long without ever repeating himself. Once outside, Tony pulled his black leather gloves on, his smile was spread wide on his freshened face. He took Steve's hand again, instinctively, nonchalantly, and they walked to the restaurant together, because it was just a few blocks away. Tony had quieted when they arrived. He was squeezing Steve's hand proudly and contemplated the city around them. Steve looked at him sidelong, heart fluttering. Tony looked so happy and so innocent at times.
At everyone's odd silence Tony felt embarrassed and hid it with a smile. "So... what did I miss? What were you guys talking about?"
"I remember when I met Bruce," Betty answered, eyes staring into space, "I was instantly captivated by his intellect and his soft-spoken manners. I only admired him at first, for his skills and qualities and knowledge, as my boss. It's only when I started dating Glenn that I realized my feelings went deeper than just respect and high-esteem. I started to pursue him then but he was so oblivious. I think he never saw past the co-worker."
"I'm good," Clint answers with a shrug, "but you can open that bottle if you want." Tony complies and when he's done he pours himself another drink and gulps it down. Then he stares at his empty glass and looks at the bottom of it with a sense of desperation. He unintentionally sighs, which catches Clint's attention. "Want another beer?" He asks while glancing surreptitiously at him. "Or something stronger?"
Tony narrowed his eyes, considering Steve's answer and nodded understandingly. "I see..." Then tilted his head on the other side, looking like he had some kind of hidden agenda. He smiled gently, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "What about you?"
He fucked his throat, but wasn't able to come in the end. The guy did, though. Tony counted that as a victory.
Tony shrugs again. "Don't know, you just said it's helped you focus on your projects... Have you talked about having kids yet?"
It was just supposed to be a nod at his boyfriend, give him his full support for the launching of the first arc reactor. Years of labor and battle that culminated into one of the greatest accomplishment in the twenty-first century. So excuse him if he was being a bit of a fanboy but he was
"Greg." He whispered while biting on his lips lewdly and he thrust his own cock deeper in the mouth of the guy at his feet, pushing on his head a little. The guy choked but didn't complain.
"Tony needs your help. Go to his floor, now." Steve slurs, only inches from his mouth, while releasing him from his grasp.
himself, but on an empty stomach he was just spewing bile and blood. The burning acid was excruciating on his inflamed throat. His head was spinning, he searched Steve's small bathroom cupboard for something, anything that could make him feel better. Meds, a pair of scissors, razorblades... Steve didn't even have paracetamol.
Tony felt his blood leave his body instantly. His father was sending him death glares. The coldness of his voice felt like an icy shower.
"Are you gonna take me home, now?" He asked pleadingly, on the verge of crying, although he was dried up of all his tears. All he wanted now was for Obie to fuck him again, but gently this time, and in a bed. Just like they used to when Tony was younger, when Tony thought Obie was making love to him and that he would always be there for him, to protect him. He wanted to be cuddle in those big arms again. He wanted Obie's warmth to help him ease the angst churning his stomach, to soothe the excruciating agony in his chest. He wanted to forget... About everything. Forget about Obie's twisted games. Forget about his dad. Forget about Steve...
Steve leant into her touch and sighed. His mum caressed his cheek for a little longer and went back to make breakfast.
He might as well leave tomorrow for all Tony cares. He doesn't have enough strength in him to care anymore. He has lost his right to care. He is worn out, anyway. Whoever said omegas were a blessing is a fucking asshole!
"Nah. 'Cause you're gonna do everything I say," he finally answered. "Hands off and turn over," he commanded. "You're gonna wait patiently here, spread out for me, until I get hard again." Which, to be honest, took much longer than before lately.
Tony smiled evilly and clicked his tongue against his teeth. "That I'm submissive..." He husked out, voice hoarse with lust. His eyes flickered away for a split second and then he stared back right into Steve's eyes, intensely, a smile full of innuendos on his face and bit into the apple again.
A whirlwind of emotion submerged him. He wanted to burst out laughing and scream and cry at the same time. He started breathing heavily until he couldn't hear Tony's hitched breathing anymore. The moment so intense Steve wanted to escape it and live it again and again and again and never wanted it to stop.
The two omegas wants to take care of their alpha. They want to submit to him, to give him everything, and take everything from him. And there's something he's been wanting to do for a while but never dared but then and there and here and now it feels alright. It feels
Tony didn't react when Steve made his presence known, he had probably heard him coming but he didn't acknowledge it either way. "I'm fine." He mumbled as a response, without looking at him. He was still staring into space, his cigarette smoking itself away, close to burning his fingers.
"You know what the real problem is?" Bucky says more seriously. "You're shitting your pants, that's all."
Tony fondles the omega's face during the entire time they're knotted. He takes care of him, reassures,
Tony wants to fuck him again right against the tiles but he decides James deserves a bed for their second time so he refrains until the showering session is over and James comes in his mouth. He's not worried. He knows about James's sex-drive, super-soldier and all. The omega is slick and vulnerable and so ready to take his knot again.
Steve remained silent, not knowing what to say yet. Maybe he was trying not to say something stupid that would lead to an unnecessary fight between them. He could feel the tension rising between them though and Tony's shoulder blades inconspicuously tensed. Steve clutched the iron bar till it hurt. He felt an uncomfortable shiver running down his spine. The silence suddenly heavy between them.
know that's not true, though." Tony slurred on his nose, smile dancing seductively on his lips, still glistening with apple juice.
There was a moment in Tony's life. A glimpse of happiness, during which he almost thought that he could make him happy. He liked to think he was a decent person. He liked to think he was modern and open-minded. He liked to think he could make it happen.
The brutal and sudden rush of hormones is flooding him and he drops, body limp into Tony's embrace. He feels like he's flying, like he's not in his own body anymore but somewhere between himself and the alpha. Their nest has become a vast ocean on which he's floating away, the sky infinite and filled with love and hope. He can barely feel Tony's gentle touches on his face.
Steve answered with a shy, worried smile. There was still something about that party that bothered him.
"Why didn't you do it in the end?" He asked after a peaceful moment of silence, hiding his embarrassed face into his boyfriend's cotton shirt, pressed hard against his muscular back.
"Come on, Steve." Bucky tries again. "All those years you and Tony have been fucking and you've never shared a heat with him, not even once. Don't you want that? Don't you want to
And now that Steve came back, now that alpha and the omega are reunited again. Now that he has been excluded from the bond they share, he has been developing a bond of his own.
Tony growls and they both moan, losing control. The alpha is on the verge to come and took possession of Steve's throat so Bucky gets up and lets them enjoy their reunion on their own. They need it after a week of absence.
"Get off your suppressants." He slurs into his ear. The words sounds like an order but the tone is slightly supplicant.
willing. As a principle. He was built that way. He thought he chuckled, at the incongruity of the situation. He couldn't help himself.
They were finally able to chat. For a moment he even thought he had managed to soften Steve's features and that the atmosphere between them had eased a little but rapidly the light chitchat turned sour and Steve found the way to turn everything Tony said into a reason to chastise him again until Tony found himself huddled and prostrate, nervously tightening his arms around his knees, his heart pounding hard and uncomfortably in his chest while he avoided his boyfriend's glare. The distance between them now was agonizing. Steve felt like a stranger when Tony only wanted one thing, be in his arms. He searched his eyes, trying to find a trace of his boyfriend in the death glare the man in front of him was giving him.  "Thank you," he whispered, meaning every fucking word, "for saving me."
"Yeah. Yeah. We got it." Bucky interrupted in a sigh. "I don't think you're omega, though. You always thought you were gonna present as an alpha. What's changed?"
Why would he want to cry now? How shameful! It must be the weed. Tony's not used to it anymore. "I'm sorry." He tries to say with a hoarse, broken voice. The words scorch his throat as he utters them. "Don't know why I did that. I didn't mean it." He has some troubles seeing straight, his head's spinning around him.
Steve blinked and opened his eyes wide, jaw slacked. He hated himself and his Irish ancestry as he felt a blush creeping on his face. And only because Fury had complimented him to another student. He didn't dare imagine how he would react upon being kissed for the time.
"Also," Steve starts. His eyes twinkle in the moonlight and he's so fucking beautiful at that moment. His smile is splendid. "You don't have to flirt with Loki or Clint to get my attention, you know... 'cause I'm always looking at you."
"Thanks for coming through..." Tony added with a soft whisper. "I was glad you were here. I hate those things as much as you do, you know?"
The whole thing unsettled Steve for a moment. It was all—unexpected, but nice, really nice and Steve felt overwhelmed by the warm and fuzzy feelings fluttering in his chest.
A whole range of emotion seems to flash through the omega's eyes but Bucky can't really see from where he is. He can smell it though, the way the blond omega's scent spikes with gratitude, yearning and bliss alike.
"Don't deny my feelings for you!" Tony said angrily and then his expression softened, something forlorn pooling in his eyes. "Please, don't deny my feelings for you.... " He repeated with a faltering voice. "'cause you
They hadn't really talked about it beforehand, figured they would when the time came but then Tony looked lost and vulnerable and he was so ready for Steve. They had let their instincts do the rest, always careful, asking for consent, and for approval, each step of the way. It was majestic. Soft and slow and powerful and amazing.
you see. Like, what turns me on is knowing that someone is fucking me. And it's bliss knowing that it's you, by the way. Doing it to myself is just... It's not that I don't feel anything, it's just... It's just
Tony was looking at him, waiting for a sign, expression hopeful. Steve was incapable of giving him one. "So we didn't make it through another year after all..." His boyfriend finally said, looking away, hurt so very visible on his face this time.
"Omegas are supposed to have heats." He explains, voice pervaded with growing lust. "I want to have heats again."
Steve hadn't really thought about it when he prepared for school that morning. He hadn't thought about it at all. That was just another school day. A normal school day. Never would he have predicted everyone would react so strongly. People suddenly knew who he was and what he was, the first days were pretty intense and the smell especially aggressive, and he wasn't sure he was ready for such a change in status. He wasn't ready to affirm himself that way. He was fine being omega after after all.
what it feels like. Someone who isn't brutal or insensitive. Someone who will treat him with love and respect because his confidence plummets as soon as they get started.
Tony beamed and seemed as relieved as Steve was to drop the bullying topic and leave it for another day. "I was wondering if..." He started, hesitatingly. "If you could help me with English. You're the best student in Fury's class and I'm applying for MIT. I need at least a B-"
From then on the touches were bolder, more regular, more sensual. Both of them seeking more every time. Until they finally fucked.
Tony swallowed and clicked his tongue against his teeth. "Because you were happy." He husked out after a pause. Steve shivered all over. "You had a great, stable, healthy relationship with an amazing boyfriend who was good to you, and caring, and understating, and strong, and grounded. I couldn't take that away from you—I couldn't
Tony shivered at the threatening tone of the man. " I don't." He choked out, whisperingly. A painful memory of his first boyfriend flashed through his mind. Something twinged in his chest.
He was on his way to acceptance when he walked along Fifth Avenue, to Tony's house. Steve rarely came in Manhattan but Tony had insisted. It was the first time they were having their homework session in one of their houses. Steve was really not thrilled about going all the way from their shitty diner in Brooklyn over to Manhattan but Tony had batted his eyelashes and looked at him with his most unsettling puppy eyes, Steve had given in.
The nurse startled and pouted a little before forcing a professional understanding expression back on her face. "Okay." She said and noted something on her form.
"I guess that was another one of those moments we can add on the pile of our missed chances." Steve muttered in a hoarse voice while Tony's mouth was still on him.
Tony stared back, quiet, lips parted. Steve knew he could see right through him and it made him uncomfortable. "No, I won't." He said curtly and paused to let it sink in, purposely being mean. "If you want your painting back then buy it yourself!"
Every time Tony looks at him he can only see the invisible shackles around his neck and his wrists. James is here, with him, taking care of him because he doesn't have anywhere else to go, because without him he's nothing and no-one and he doesn't deserve a life. If he makes sure Tony eats everyday it's because they have daughter and Felicia bounds them for the rest of their lives in a way that neither of them can escape.
Tony made a cute grimace, tilting his head on the side, an undying grin on his face. "You didn't tell them?"
There was always some kind of morbid fascination mingled with unjustified wariness towards transfer students. People wondered
Steve does, too. Steve deserves the world. And if Tony had an ounce of courage under his rotten skin he would grab it for him. For Steve... For Steve if he wasn't so vile and disgraceful. If he wasn't so lame. He would have done anything for Steve once.
His moment of confusion was interrupted by a soft slap on his face. Tony blinked and gasped in surprise. "Yeah, you do." The man husked out with a growing grin on his face. He slipped his hand down Tony's pants and grabbed his half-hard dick. Tony unconsciously leant into him and gasped again, eyes fluttering shut. The man gave his cock a brutal stroke and earned a strangled moan from him. "Do you like sucking cocks, Greg?" He whispered.
Sam's hand grabbed her hip so gently and fondled her lower belly very discreetly. "We...hum...I..." Natasha really was blushing now, a soft smile on her lips. "We're gonna be parents." She finally said, almost shamefully. They both looked very happy and fulfilled however.
Tony walked closer and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. He shrugged. "I know that but... If you ever..." His voice faltered, his self-confidence plummeting. "I mean you don't have to, but you can, in case—"
Steve's confidence wavered as the post-orgasmic daze started to ebb away. The intensity in Tony's eyes was unsettling. "I'm really busy today," he muttered while brushing a loving hand on his boyfriend's face, "I told you so." Tony pouted and he looked unfairly cute with his disheveled look. His eyes were still red and shiny, his voice was wrecked and his lips were swollen. "I don't have time to get out for lunch, especially now..."
during which Bucky was worried to death. Ten days during which Steve didn't get out of his nest but to shower or empty himself. And when he did, he looked haggard, smiling blissfully and completely mute, in a complete daze.
Steve brought a firm hand on Tony's shoulder. "Tony, stop it! You're not like that..." He said with all his intent. "I mean, yeah, I admit... that at the beginning, things were a little fuzzy and confused. You didn't explicitly ask for my consent and we did things I never thought I would do before, and I was weak to your charms... but in the end, it's always been consensual. Because everything we did, I wanted it. I've learnt so much from you Tony, you're not the only one who's changed. I grew up beside you too... And I assure you that you
Tony raised a hand and ran it softly on Steve's cheek, brushing his hair off his face. He pinched his lips and wetted them sensually. "You're okay with everyone knowing about this? After all my efforts to be the "woman" in our relationship?" His expression changed from tender to cheeky and teasing in an instant.
He fetched the coffee first, abrupt, awkward, his silent stare still locked in Steve's eyes. He must be starving too, Steve thought and found the gesture endearing despite everything else.
"Wait a sec." Steve blurted while running to the living room where a pile of clean laundry lay on the sofa. He yanked on the first towel he could see and ran back to Tony to uncover his head and wiped his face with the towel. The gesture was unexpectedly gentle and Tony's eyes shone with silent gratitude.
The words struck Steve. He felt a shiver down his spine. Tony had always wanted to share a heat with him, Steve had blatantly refused. Never in his mind he had considered Bucky might have wanted it.
period. They had rarely been alone together and things were still awkward between them. Tony was shifty—Bucky was about to go into heat.
Tony chuckled and smiled with a closed mouth. "Probably..." He agreed. "But I'm not stalking you, though. I just listen to what you say. And I ask about you, because I care. Because knowing what you do is important to me."
"We need to talk, Tony." Steve continues, voice deep, low in his throat. His tone slightly commanding.
Steve's eyes flare open, his eyes tingle with tears, the dim light suddenly blinding. He gasps wheezingly. A long exhausted and fearful gasp. It's like being struck by lightning, it's like seeing the light for the first time. It's like touching the stars. It's the most powerful high.
The connection he has with him, the love he feels for him, is mental and emotional. It's sweet and tender and deep that comes from the bottom of his heart. It reaches the core of his soul and it would never end. For life, they're connected and he knows that it's true for Steve as well. Because Steve still comes to his room at night, when he's not with the alpha, and Bucky makes sweet tender love to him and it's amazing as well as excruciatingly lonely.
Tony stares at him silently, lost for words. The smell of distress spiking in the omega's scent. It roils inside. It always riles him up, the smell of anxious omega.
He exclaimed in hoarse, broken voice. "I know it has something to do with that Stern guy. And I wish I could help. I wish you'd let me be there for you..." He stopped, because his voice was faltering and because Tony's expression fell apart. His face paled and Steve could clearly see the tremor in his jaw. His lips trembled. His entire body was shivering. A mix of fear and agony was pooling in his eyes.
Steve felt his heart clench. All the emotion he felt tonight and tried to repress in front of everyone suddenly creeping back tenfold. He looked down, guiltily. How could he ever truly believe something like this? It just didn't make any sense. "You said you fell in love at first sight..." Steve said as a justification.
Steve felt himself cringe at the pang in his chest. He reached out to his boyfriend and curled his fingers around his crossed forearm. Tony lifted his eyes, staring at him sidelong, no smile brightening his sullen face.
Tony's heart is beating so fast and so hard in his chest, the arc reactor accelerates. Tony thinks his brain short-circuited. Did the omega just say that
"And then you contacted me." Sam interrupted, looking at her with a smile filled with love and admiration.
She certainly could. She was the scariest person Steve had ever met but that didn't mean it was a valid reason to ditch her at the party to come and rescue him. That was very inappropriate actually, Steve thought Tony had more class. "I can too." He mumbled unconvincingly, although currently it wasn't that evident.
us to live together. I'll sell it and we'll buy something, the two of us, together. Something that'll be
Steve lost himself. His boyfriend's voice was so fucking sexy and hoarse and the vibration of his deep guttural moans resonated in Steve's ears and warmed his chest. The heat pooling in his lower belly spread in his entire body and he suddenly felt the pleasure overwhelm him. His head in a daze he closed his eyes and felt himself fall over the edge.
The entire place smells like sex, everywhere the alpha's and the omega's scents pervade, strong and heady and suffocating. They're mingled, although the alpha scent is stronger than ever and very present. Bucky's head starts spinning. He goes down on his knees and submit, head lowered down and hands behind his back. He waits.
Steve, standing in front of them in all his righteous glory, fighting for liberty. Shit, Tony could almost see the Star-spangled banner floating behind him. A surreal vision. He felt euphoric.
"You're very handsome tonight," is the only thing Tony can say as a reply, at the risk of sounding corny.
Right. Tony Stark wasn't fixated on a particular gender, he had forgotten. The twinge was still there.
Steve jerked away, immediately taking his hand off, and curled his arm around his boyfriend's waist instead. He didn't stop his ministrations however. He kissed Tony again, behind his ear and on the nape of his neck. His lips were following the line of his neck down to his shoulder and he started nibbling at the soft skin there. Tony shivered and groaned as he slowly woke up, certainly not indifferent to Steve's treatment but not responding either. Tony was burning against him and unconsciously wriggled his ass against Steve's crotch. Steve attempted to take him in his hand again. His splayed fingers slid down his stomach and slipped into Tony's pants again. This time his boyfriend jerked and giggled softly while he grabbed his hand away.
A sly grin spreads on Clint's face and he chuckles. "Alright," he consents. "Let me get those to the others first and come with me."
He glanced at Tony time and again, checking on him, and if he wiggled a little too much while rutting against the mattress, he slapped his butt.
Which was... possibly true. His tastes hadn't changed overnight. Turning alpha hadn't miraculously made him fancy small and delicate flowers. He liked them tall and sturdy. Probably.
That's basically all his omegas want right now, it seems, and Tony has all the time in the world for meeting their other needs. It's gonna be the fucking longest night of his entire life.
"Come on." Steve teased. "Let me touch your knot. So, I'll get an idea before I get to the real deal."
Steve frowned and pouted, the last thing he wanted was for the entire floor to know he had shagged his boyfriend during his lunch break at the office, just a matter of principle. But Tony straightened up, both hands clutched on the shelves on each side of Steve's head, imprisoning him. His eyes stared intensely into Steve's and his smile was dangerous. Steve's heart skipped a beat. He looked away, focusing on the manly shape of his jaw and the wet pink of his bottom lip. Mostly he tried to avoid the intensity in Tony's eyes but he kept being drawn to them. He unconsciously slipped his hands on each side of him, underneath his jacket, and curled his arms around his waist. His brain wanted Tony to leave but the rest of his person wanted something else entirely. He was conflicted. And hard. And unable to think straight anyway. He repressed a whine.
Tony felt a shiver of shame flush through his body at the reminder but only nodded, hoping this was gonna end soon. He wiggled uncomfortably on his ass.
The expression on his face was probably reflecting how he felt at this very moment, horrified. His voice was almost shivering when he asked. "Since when?" He could feel his heart beating at his temples.
It took him a little while to understand he wasn't the one who got punched. He remained there, eyes closed, gritting his teeth, completely befuddled.
"The two of us had to pull you out of your vomit and drag your wasted ass home, I'm sure you could have figured it out yourself." Steve snapped, feeling like a jerk afterward. He couldn't help himself.
Steve wanted him gone so Tony left. He grabbed his phone and credit cards left by Steve on his worktable and he left. He wasn't even sure he put on shoes. He hesitated, for a long moment, between the door and the window. The window really was an appealing option. At this height, there was a chance Tony would die of a heart-attack before his body touched the ground. Although Tony deserved a horrible and painful death. A heart-attack sounded too good for him, too quick, too lenient. Tony needed to suffer before he died. He needed to pay for what he did to Steve. This was too easy and if Tony was going to kill himself he should at least have the decency not to bother Steve with it. That sounded like a petty revenge, Steve deserved better than that from him.
Steve's mind went crazy. He whimpered and grabbed his boyfriend's head with his two hands, tangling his fingers in his hair. He ruffled and grabbed and pulled while Tony's lips were sliding up and down his cock. Tony was the one holding to the bookshelves behind them now and Steve tightened his grip and thrust into his mouth while pushing onto his head, further and further until he penetrated his throat again and Tony lost balance and whimpered as he gagged on his cock. That was Steve's cue. It was his turn to give the rhythm now and he fucked hard into his boyfriend's mouth, wrecking his throat with a desperate rage, pushing further and further and staying there until his boyfriend couldn't breathe anymore. Tony moaned and cried maybe. He vibrated around his cock and shivered as each thrust made his knees slide back on the floor. Steve accelerated using his boyfriend's mouth to find release. He knew Tony was enjoying himself, because he knew his boyfriend. Tony liked being roughed up and Steve liked... pleasing Tony. And he was so close now.
Tony raised his head and stared into his eyes. A whole range of emotion flashed through his eyes and he clenched his jaw. In an abrupt gesture, he brutally grabbed Steve's wrist and held him tight, pulling him closer. Steve startled and parted his lips. For a split second he got scared but it soon turned into confusion when Tony didn't do anything else. His grip was strong though, and unbreakable.
Unknotted bonded omegas are a plague. Their constant arousal is spreading like wildfire, driving everyone insane.  Not that either of them are really bonded, which actually makes things worse. Their scents spike, programmed to lure the Alpha and make them mark them.
Tony chuckled. He twisted his mouth and nodded in some sort of amused agreement and he gave Steve a wide and gentle smile while reiterating his demand silently, a shy hand offered confidently.
Drinks happen. Dinner happens. Posh and overpriced. Tony is feeling tipsy, his head spinning with too much alcohol. It's making him smile too easily. Steve drank just as much but he shouldn't be affected and yet, his face is flushed, cheeks rosy and smile a little too bright, a little too seductive. It must be his scent. Or that deep connection he's been feeling since Steve asked him out. Or something more, maybe the steady pulsation throbbing in his neck, mirroring the pulse of Steve's bonding gland. Maybe it's the heady and muffled atmosphere of the club, the smell of cigars mingled with alcohol and omega scent. Or the music, sensual and mesmerizing.
on my birthday party, by the way..." He noticed the hint of a smile on a few of his friends' faces. Everyone remembered the fiasco that had been his birthday then but, again, water had run under the bridge and no-one but Sam risked making any comments about it. The latter rolled his eyes and patted his shoulder protectively. "We went on a trip, totally improvised, and I guess I saw parts of him I had never seen before and I think that's when I first realized how deep my feelings for him went. But honestly, even then, I couldn't make any sense of them...."
Pepper sighed for the nth time but he knew she was more amused than annoyed. Sighing was second language to Pepper and Tony had known her for too long not to be able to decipher the meaning behind every one of her sighs.
Tony chuckled and turned his face to him, plunging his eyes into Steve's, the sudden intensity in them unsettling. "Oh, I definitely,
Steve responded with a smile and brushed his fingers on his cheek again. "I'm fine." He finally answered. "Are
Soon he felt two lubed-cold fingers brushing his rim and he gasped in pleasure and want. The fingers breached him slowly, hot and slick, and pushing into him so very delicately. Tony pulled them out alternately while pushing in further every time, his left hand still firm but gentle on his neck. Not for long though, Steve was no beginner, he didn't need to be prepared so thoroughly. Soon Tony thrust three fingers in, teasingly, infuriatingly, pushing into him slowly but harder and deeper, curling them inside and grazing his soft spot every time. His left hand slid down his nape and landed on his shoulder while Tony kissed his way into neck, licking and nibbling at the soft skin there. Steve gasped and let out a long shuddering keen. He was more than ready but Tony kept fucking his fingers into him so excruciatingly slowly, adding more lube and a fourth one, stretching Steve even more, until he was just a gasping and shivering mess and started breathing hard and erratically, shuddering with want and frustrated pleasure. He arched his back and keened pleadingly, Tony slid his left hand down his shoulder and his arm and grabbed his hand to pin it against the wall next to his head and intertwined their fingers together. He kept kissing his neck and fucked into him softly. He added the beginning of his thumb and thrust harder. Steve was rock hard now and started dripping, he wanted more and he wanted harder and deeper but Tony kept teasing him, fucking him with his five fingers, rubbing his prostate again and again until Steve cried out with want. When Steve was almost ready to take the whole fist inside, Tony stopped and turned him around. He leant his back against the wall, holding his weak and trembling self straight. He grabbed his face in his hands and kissed him passionately. "I love you, Steve." He whispered desperately into his mouth, grinding his hard-on against Steve's belly. "I love you so fucking much."
He chuckles embarrassedly, looking away again and stares right back into Tony's eyes. "You know in five years," he says softly, but eyes determined, "we've never been on a date. Not even once." Tony stares up at him surprisedly with a curious expression. Steve's biting his bottom lip nervously. "And it's my fault. It's probably my fault." The omega continues. "I want to fix that."
in your mouth." Steve yelled, voice pervaded with rage and fear. "They wrecked your throat and now you're bleeding. Do you want to catch AIDS?"
where I wanna go with you." He paused, catching his breath, eyes determined, burning like two infinite fires. "So, stop treating me like a kid! For
Tony's heart clenches. Steve is so beautiful at this instant. Beautiful and strong and pride and determined. And vulnerable. And the strong urge to protect him and to indulge coils in his guts. He staggers up on his feet and offers him his hand. "Is that why I'm here?" He says with a grin. He wants to confident and reassuring but deep inside he's freaking out. He wills the tremor in hand away and reaches out to Steve. The omega takes his hand delicately and blushes adorably.
boyfriend and nods toward him. He walks closer—Tony almost recoils—and pats him on the shoulder. Tony just hopes he didn't make a face because he kept himself from staring at his own shoulder, in case it was stained or something after Loki's touch. It wouldn't be nice and he doesn't want to upset Steve.
Something clenches in Tony's stomach. He just shrugs. "No!" He blurts out and wriggles his hips to find a better position against the counter. "I won't get bored," he adds while looking down at his feet. Without a drink, he doesn't know what to do with his hands, so he grabs the counter nervously.
Tony let out a painful shuddering breath, still shaking, and fell on the side. He was still unable to move a limb. He didn't even have enough strength in himself to pull his pants up, so Obie's hands caught him and hauled him up. The brusque movement made Tony retch with the sudden, excruciating need to throw up. The man gently held him up above the bowl while he puked the five or so drinks he had had at dinner.
Tony came hard, in long and spasmodic waves that seemed to never end. He panted and whined breathily while Steve fucked him through the aftershocks, grazing his overstimulated prostate until he was a limp and crying mess in his hands. Steve shot his second load without even trying and Tony collapsed on the bed, completely limp, a dead weight in Steve's grasp who pulled him down in its momentum. Steve laughed and curled around him, snuggling against him. Tony didn't react. Steve kissed him on the temple, nipping his ear, until he finally got a reaction.
Steve had to wait. After years of being on the strongest suppressants, his cycles were fucked up, even with the serum. (Perhaps, especially because of the serum and the specificities of those incredibly powerful suppressants that were made just for him.) It took some time before his body got the clue. His first heat in almost a decade hit him hard.
Clint has finally found what he was looking for and is now rolling a joint while standing next to the bed. He just shrugs without looking up from it. "What? Told you, we're experimenting. It's fun. Put that away, will you? There's a box under the bed."
He burst into tears. That wasn't part of the equation. It wasn't supposed to be like this. He had finally, finally accepted himself. He rolled onto his stomach and hid under the cover, and cried.
He simply can't anyway. He can't because every time he does, the ugly truth is screaming at Tony's face. All the truth. The depth of their viciousness.
Tony turned his head back slowly, fixing his intense chocolate eyes on him. A soft smile appeared on his face and his eyes twinkled. "You really feel home in the penthouse?"
Tony slumps down on the bed and kicks off his boots. He hauls himself up on the bed, making sure he doesn't spill beer on it, so that he can slouch down on the cushions while Clint is tiptoeing on a tool, searching for something hidden on the top shelves of the huge storage unit on the walls surrounding their bed.
"What do you want to me say, Steve? That I wanted it?" Tony was looking straight at him, heart racing in his chest. "Yeah." He said. "I did. That I liked it?" He kept going, his eyes intent on Steve. "Maybe I did." He whispered, forcing the words out of his mouth.
"Yeah..." Tony laughed. "For two weeks or something." He shook his head. "Nah, we're better as friends."
Past the surprise at the half-joke, Steve felt a lump in his throat and his chest constricted. "Haven't you been already?" He asked timidly, back still turned to his boyfriend. He avoided his gaze and pretended to continue with emptying the shelves.
It made him angry too. No-one should be treated like second-class citizens and despite much improvement for the last decade or so, omegas still were. They shared a conniving silence and the moment lingered, both of them watching without really looking at the dance floor.
Tony looked down and shrugged, avoiding his boyfriend's furious stare. "I don't know." He whispered, forcing the words out of his throat painfully.
"Close your eyes." Steve commanded in a raspy voice. His boyfriend obliged, chuckling sensually at the overly dominant tone. His lips curled up amusedly and he ran the tip of his tongue on his bottom lip, sucking in a soft breath. "I know what you need." Steve husked out while grabbing his boyfriend's hands to pull them away.
Steve rolled his eyes. "You know, me and Buck we've known each other since kindergarten." The alpha gazed at him gently, hung on his every word. "We were  the same size, although I was always skinnier, with a poor health. I would be bullied because of it and I would fight back and he would help me out and we would both end up in trouble." Tony leant closer, resting his face on the palms of his hands, captivated. "And then he started to grow and to change and I didn't. And then he presented and I—" He paused, trying to remember when it went wrong. "—I felt left out, somehow. Like he was, you know, going his own way and leaving me there."
Steve was a bit unsettled at the beginning. It was all very discreet. It was made of little marks of affection, of loving gazes, of stolen smiles and knowing stares... Bucky constantly kept a worried eye on Tony when he wasn't all focused on his daughter. He talked to him softly with a caring and soothing voice. He always made sure he didn't need anything and made a point to provide for everything Tony wanted. Everything Tony let him provide for, anyway—which wasn't a lot, in fact, but it was still more than what Steve had ever shown Tony.
