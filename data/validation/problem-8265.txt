The moon shone light into the bedroom where mason lay fast asleep in her bed although it wasn’t a very peace full sleep as she rolled around almost trying to get away from the dream she was having as white snowy mountains and a train speeding down a mountain track flashed behind her eyes she watched as men landed on top of the train men she didn’t know all but two, her other father Steve Rogers and Uncle Bucky Barnes she couldn’t understand why she was seeing thing but she didn’t like it her papa had told her about her uncle and what had happened to him when he fell of the train, as the dream wen on fighting broke out and guns were shot her father and her uncle were inside the train fighting against men in black wearing a red skull with tentacles logo on their shoulder, her father in one part of the train and her uncle in the one behind him shooting and avoiding getting shot while her father was being shot at by blue beams of energy, energy that felt familiar jumping up grabbing onto a sliding rail he slid blocking his upper body from blows he kicked the man down before knocking him unconscious with his shield, he grabbed the energy gun and blasted a hole through the door, picking up his shield he run back toward her uncle glancing through the window just when her uncles gun run out of ammo he took out his weapon and open the door gesturing toward his gun he threw it at him and charged hitting the case pushing it forward giving her uncle the right opportunity to shoot the man down.
“Tony look, wait what” was all he got out before he was pulled down and kissed.
“Hydra experiment”.
Coming to a stop in front of the mansion Charles and Erik were waiting for them, seeming not being able to wait anymore mason opened the door and ran straight into Erik's arm swinging her around before hugging her“ have you been a good girl” Erik asked Mason.
*Concentrate sweetheart you can do it*.
“I'm so sorry Tony protect her and love her like you only have a day with her and tell my son I'm so sorry i never wanted this to happen Dont waste this precious opportunity you'll never get it again,” Mason said panting through bloody coughs blood running out of her mouth, giving him one more smile before she took her last breath.
“Yeah” was all Tony could say again disbelief still on his face.
He had started noticing very strange things was happening to him well stranger than being pregnant,  yesterday he was talking to his bots Dum E and U which is normal he always does but this time he understood every single word they said, he could also reach any kind of tech and control them, controlling the suits has been better he still had Friday there to help him but now the bond goes deeper he could feel numbers, designs and codings at the back of his mind like it was a part of him, also now he could see as clear as day what was wrong with the vehicles he has and how to make them work better and drive faster.
“So it could just be my Abilities acting up,” Tony asked cautiously trying to curve around the subject seeing how much he could skid another direction.
And being ready for when it did happen was a completely deferent story.
“Tony for god sakes your pregnant you can't do this you're putting the baby at risk if something goes wrong,” Pepper said angrily, he knew he shouldn't be doing this he didnt want to but if he didnt respond to the very first call since the rest of the avenger went roque there will be questions and very high up people demanding to know why iron man didnt show up to help protect Hawaii and there was no way he was going to reveal the truth about his daughter that was growing inside him.
“he is fine pepper, pregnant but okay you know tony he always makes it through no matter what pushes him down” patting her knee as he sat down next to her
“It wasn't his abilities I was testing, it was his unborn child's,” Charles told Erik finally glancing toward Erik.
No matter how far he got from Ross the bad feeling he had still don't go away so he kept going until he was at stark tower he needed to talk to Rhodey about going with him to Xavier mansion he felt safe when someone was with him.
“of course have a safe drive back, Jean will show you out” charles said.
It took a while to get mason bundled up and ready to go to the park, happy had been extremely Happy to see mason as she got into the car, giving her hugs kissing her cheeks and tickling her tummy making her burst with laughter it made pepper smile as she watched Happy being wrapped around masons little finger even going as far as putting her favorite music on to play on their drive to the park.
It was close to three hours that they had been at the park and mason was starting to get tired but she didn’t want to leave rubbing her tired eyes mason spotted a large blue and purple butterfly it was closer to the streets where she wasn’t supposed to go but she wanted to look at the pretty butterfly, looking back to where her aunt pepper and uncle happy was talking mason saw that their attention wasn’t on her at the moment she could go see the butterfly and be back before they noticed where she had gone, looking back again one more time mason headed towards the butterfly she was in awe at the butterflies wings how it fluttered and at the pretty colors as she got near the butterfly took off flying away mason watched it in complete awe at the beautiful butterfly that she didn’t notice a man coming up behind her, Mason let out a scream when a bag was thrown over her head and the man lifted her up and run away with her fighting to be let go off.
“to oversee the mentally and physical health of baby Stark along with her security and protecting her when the time arrives”.
: Tony, Tony Sweetheart oh what are you doing in there look at you-you're so dirty now covered in dust: his mother's voice reached out to him and pulled him to her as her face appears a small smile graced her face as she patted the dust out of his hair.
And didnt that just hurts knowing their friend was going to die and Steve could do nothing about it, and having ended things the way the did make it a lot worse.
“Yes and not just them you, pepper, Peter and happy i have to protect the people I care about” Tony argued
The city of Honolulu was a mess the monster wasn't overly big but as it moves its tentacles smashed against building luckily with not enough force to send the building down only to damage it but the falling debris made it dangerous for whoever stood below.
He knew vision and or the kid was going to be there with him but with the Avengers not being as strong of a defence as it was stronger villains in much bigger groups will come so the best thing he could do is protect the world all while he gets the accords changed, Expose Ross getting him behind bars, Getting S.H.I.E.L.D back and running while he worked to get all the avengers and not so avengers pardons should be easy Right.
“Oh come on Fry please i won't do any heavy lifting or anything stressful i promise, please,” Tony asked glancing at the ceiling where he knew the camera was.
Nodding his thanks for the compliment“ you were quite livid when we spoke, you said you had something of importance to discuss and as you've seen i dont open my door for just anything” T'challa said Tony understood he really did it had only been recently that Wakanda had become a partly known country and to witness the faces when they had been told that the once known third world country was, in fact, the most advanced country in the world was priceless.
Wakanda part 2
“We cant transport him like this, he's already too far in labor we need to do this here or we may lose them both” Dr. Halliway shouted over the noise the alarm had finally gone off alerting everyone of the attack but she couldn't worry about that now, although it was a bunch of bullshit they could still transport Tony out of there, but that wasn't the idea yet make sure the baby and tony was safe and secure until colonel Rhodes could get them out himself was the plan, sticking to the plan however was going to be the problem so far everything had gone sideways starting with the baby coming earlier than expected it was supposed to be an easy get in, get Tony, get out taking her with them opp but now with battle going on in the base a man in labor and a race to protect the baby everything was a mess.
“You weren't kidding when you said you were hungry,” Rhodey said with a chuckle pushing away his empty plate.
*THATS JUST GREAT* giving in to the erg he banged his head against the desk.
Shaking his head Tony’s shoulders were tense
Having that been said T'challa thought it would be best if they moved on with the discussion at hand“ what do you have in mind for the accord what is it that you want to change”
and it seems they used it on you boss.
“yes back in 1973 a man named Bolivar trask who killed and experimented on mutants for there DNA to create robots called sentinels  to track and kill mutants,
“Steve was right there Rhodey God i wanted to tell him, i should have told him, he deserves to know,” Tony said gipping the phone a little tighter.
Glancing down at his own drink Rhodey grimaced he didn’t want to drink he wanted to get this conversation over with so he could go home so he toughed it out and took a drink enjoying the burn as it went down “yes and thank you for keeping me here so long I know you’re a busy man but I only need a few minutes of your time” Rhodey explained placing his drink down, resting his elbow on his knees “you and me both know that mutants and enchanted individuals have been treated unkindly over the years from both the task forces and the civilians of the world and even some of us humans were treated badly because of the support we give the mutants and enchanted individuals and I’m not saying that they are perfect but being treated fairly doesn’t cost any one anything”.
“WHAT” Tony yelled back.
Holy moly another chapter yay
Standing in front of a very pissed of debroski the head guard and his goons never saw him this pissed and they had every chance even with his other subjects debroski never got this pissed even when they accidentally killed one
Oh-oh-oh almost forgot if your wondering no I dont have a chapter for tony's not so imaginary friend yet I'm still busy but I also have other projects in the work little sneak peek the series is called Avengers love stories with all the Avengers stories how the fell in love with the created character they may even intwine we will see
<<<∆>>>
God, he Hopes so.
“Papa”.
A year after civil war the last of hydra's scientist decided it was safe for them to continue with there work since the avengers are no longer a threat and what beter of a subject then tony stark.
Laying in one of the beds Tony with rhodey and vision who joining them a while ago as they waited for results of the test to come. It didn't take long (after all you don't pay millions for bad equipment.)“ it's going to be okay tones” rhodey whispers to tony
Sighing run a hand through his hair, Tony felt like he was going nowhere it's not that he wasn't doing anything but because it's going so slow, Tony liked fast and getting things done, its already been three weeks since Tony found out due to his now screwed up DNA he was a mutant and he was also related to Barnes, it was starting to give him a headache.
“I didn't mean to frighten you” Vision spoke softly as if he was trying to calm a wild animal, giving at the way Tony has been this week he probably looked like one.
A recent memory came to him he couldn't move or open his eyes all he could do was listen
and follow me if you want
Concentrating only on the voices, Tony started working on clearing the noises and grabbing the vocals.
Sighing Steve knew this coming sooner or later he just wished it was later rather than sooner“ tony..” was all he could say before he was interrupted again.
“Mr. Stark is recovering quite nicely, and due to the serum in his blood he would recover faster than he had before but he would still be out for some time the procedure had taken a lot out of him, you can go see him if you like”.
After they left Xavier Mansion the static at the back of Tony's mind became unbearable, laying back against the headrest of the car tony closed his eyes the memories were still fresh in his mind.
“I’m sorry your highness I have to cut this short again something has come up my daughter’s missing” tony said the king nodded his understanding all while standing he walked with tony towards the quinjet.
Walking into tony lab Rhodey spotted tony sitting at his work bence with his head in his hands, which didn't ease his worry after tony's panic attack at Xavier Manson Rhodey had been at a constant worry Rhodey feels like its going to be a round the clock thing for him.
“Good evening Charles, right now is not a good time,” Tony said as he answered the phone still walking around searching where he thought he hadn't looked.
And scratch that apparently they can. “no I heard you the first time but if you have not noticed I'm a man, men can't get pregnant, for a doctor, I would have thought you would know that we don't have the right equipment”tony stated while he gestured toward his body, trying to prove a point.
“well before Mr. Hogan came speeding through the gates and up our driveway with a passed out tony in the back no less, there was this energy rush that went through the mansion almost like a gust of wind we didn't see it but we felt it, we thought nothing of it at first but then a few minutes later Mr. Hogan came rushing in and told us what had happened we realised what it was, so we went to take a look there were two cars completely destroyed by the way they rolled but other then that nothing” Charles explained, it didn't make sense to tony if Charles knew what it had been why not bring it up since the last visit Charles had stayed quiet.
“She's there,” Tony asked the feeling of dread ebbed away knowing she was in safe hands and knowing Charles would protect her.
“Are you insulting my country's technology, Mr. Barton insinuating that it's weak to allow a little bug get through” T'challa knew he was blowing smoke out of his ass but watching as barton blench gave him a rush of satisfaction and if it worked to get Barton on the plane so be it.
The feeling of home never felted better to steve them this moment and he couldn't even keep it.
“Yes I'm fine, let's go greet our guests” he added as he rolled forward where the car had stopped if stark wanted to let them know he will do it himself.
“well uhh its seems Mr stark that you're Pregnant”
Settling his hand on Tony's hips “God Tony you feel so Good” Steve said panting as he grabbed tony's ass grinding him down hard “please tell me you've got something here”.
“Colonel Rhodes I hope your stay have been pleasant I know we haven’t had the chance to talk much but I’m all ears now so please” the president gestured to Rhodey with his hand that held n tumbler of whiskey.
<<{ TWO HOURS LATER }>>
“i can try to help as much as I can professor X-xav-vier”the kid stuttered with a shy quiet voice.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
“Even if you did find someone they would say the exact same thing at least wait until its almost his due date unless you want to lose both of them then all that work wasted because you didn't want to wait”.
Tony watched as the last of the monsters was taken care of by the rest of the avenger and Roque Avengers an aching feeling filled his chest as he watched them work as a team again he wished everything could go back to the way it normally was but it wasn't possible and he wouldn't give up his baby girl for anything or anyone, as easy as it was back then it wasn't a good thing they were blind they believed the people trusted them and they were doing what was right the right way until 117 country's told them it was wrong, the trust they thought they had was gone.
{what are you up to Charles} he didn't wait long for his reply even though Charles wasn't looking at him.
“Fine just do your goddamn job don't make me regret this,” the man said there was a sound of footsteps and a door opening and closing as he left the room.
After a few minutes of adding the last of J.J coding and protocols to his Core, he was ready to be activated“J.J ”Tony called out.
It had puzzled Tony's mind that Charles hadn't asked about Tony's abilities or about the certain bun in the Oven, why keep quiet what had he to gain for keeping the little info to himself “What about the men that had driven the cars what did you do with them, ” Tony asked he wanted to know who the men were.
“Okay let's go out back there are some people who cant wait to see you,” Charles said smiling as he turned and headed for the house.
“you know I'll always support you tony you'll always be my family even if you make me crazy sometimes”She told him.
“No nobody saw what happened” Scott replied.
At the arrival tony walked into the lab he wanted to see if Friday could find DNA that matches to those that was in his“ how is it looking fry” he asked taking a seat shifting throu the designs of the project it has been coming along nicely although it was only the begin stages of developing he needed to work on the outer design of it while he still could
Shaking her head Natasha turned to face the others “Tony's done this before” Natasha spoke as she started to pace, a pacing Natasha was not a good thing “When Tony was dying from palladium Poisoning he did almost the same thing he made pepper the CEO of SI, he donated a lot of money to various charities, hell he practically gave Rhodey a suit of armor, its the same pattern, changing the accords, trying to get us pardons and retiring, only he's making sure the world is being protected before he goes” Natasha explained waving and gestures with her hands as she does.
Hay there back once again
It wasn’t a very sunny day although the sun did peak out of the clouds now and then the wind was a bit chili pepper had made sure to buddle mason up warm they walked around the park mason chasing butterflies with pepper and happy following behind her talking to one another.
Watching at complete awe tony couldn’t believe what he saw his daughter had just brought a robot to life with her powers, watching as he spins around chasing its tail Jarvis, Friday, Dum E, U had been I.A based he had programmed them this was just a piece of metal that had been brought to life with pure Energy, he couldn’t believe it “Honey where did you learn that”.
Removing his fingers, Steve lifted tony up and over his cock slowly lowering tony down, the feeling of tony body as he enters him was pure bliss with the damp heat gripped his cock steve's restraints was starting to crumble, feeling tony's ass touch his pelvis steve took a deep breath as Tony started to move.
°°°°°°#+#°°°°°°
“oh Stark who do you think suggested you”
“Yes i drink the pills” Tony sighs shaking his head making him aware of a headache,“ can we please not do this right now I'm tired, I'm hungry and my head feels like its going to explode”.
Just as he was about to open the door he was sure his watch was in he was grabbed from behind pushing back he got off an elbow gut shot before he was shoved against the wall by another pair of hands.
Grinning from ear to ear he knew Rhodey would come to find him when he found out he was in the lab, coming into his second Rhodey became more protective then before, trying to keep Tony off his feet and out of the lab also overfeeding him at dinner stating he's eating for two now which wasn't far from the truth his cravings had also gotten worse(if peanut butter, banana, jelly sandwich, and avocado, Chocolate Ice Cream) have anything to show for it, he would have thought the craving would be gone by now “Gumdrop your just in time”tony beckon Rhodey over where he was working on his project it was just about almost done, all the pieces and parts just needed to be added and put together.
“Her Godmother has her she's been walking around with her while we waited for you to wake up” Rhodey chuckled shaking his head while he stood “Ill go get them” Rhodey patted him on the shoulder as he passed him towards the door.
Surging forward, hands out and grasping the sides of the toilet bowl and emptied the little contents of his stomach resting his head on the cool rim of the bowl he hears the door to his bedroom open he turns to heave the nonexistent contents into the toilet feeling a cold cloth being pressed to his forehead “I can't even stand the smell of coffee without gagging”tony sobbed
~~~~&~~~~
Giving mason one last hug tony kissed pepper on the cheek “remember mason likes to play in the bath before she gets out” tony said all while playing with masons toes making her giggle.
Everything seems normal between them for now but they still need to work it out on the upcoming chapter ill try giving it sooner
“He's Coming” Mason sleepy mumbled before dropping down to sleep leaving tony with more questions than answers.
Shaking his head getting rid of the fog that had started to move in his head “Yes I'm fine, sorry about that i am fine” Tony said as he stood only to stop short as he started to sway, Rhodey stood with a rush grabbing tony helping him get steady.
~~{&}~~
“No we can't” Charles sighed “There is also another thing we need to discuss, after the worldwide Earthquake that Mason had caused it led me to a discovery one you may not like,” Charles said with a slight hesitance which didn't help with his confusion and worry what was wrong with his daughter and how bad was it.
“Friday” Tony spoke
And just like that, the tension in Rhodey left him, Tony had lost his parents at a young age he was there when Tony found out too watch him close off and realize he was an orphan, it wasn't something he wanted to see again, Rhodey made sure to be there for him whenever he needed him when he was drunk, sober, used, and even when he was full of himself, Rhodey was there.
“What's up with you tony, you've been out of it since Hawaii talk to me,” Rhodey asked glancing down toward the phone in tony hand, Rhodey had hated the phone since he read the so say apology letter from Rogers, Rhodey had wanted tony to destroy the phone but he didnt he knew they still needed it.
#WARNING#
“Yes it has Colonel Rhodes is in DC speaking with the president while Ms. Potts is handling the public and social income and outgoing while I’m arranging the members Charles Xavier have already agreed to be a member for the mutants rights and we would be honored if you would take the seat for the Enchanted Individuals right while if and when humans get trailed colonel Rhodes will be taking that seat for the human rights if ever it comes to it” Tony explained.
Okay so i as moronic as i was watched the new Avenger endgame on my birthday again
“Tony what about the connection, you two share have you tried, that,” Rhodey asked turning tony away from the monitor making him stop the tiredness in his eyes and the pale complexion showed how badly tony has been taking his little girl’s disappearance.
Confused to the sudden question“Yuah i remember”.
“and also she needs to drink a glass of milk while she eats and before bed a warm glass of milk cold milk upsets her stomach” tony added tickling masons tummy.
“I’m doing it again,” Tony said, and Steve looked at him confused. “Having one nightstand. Parties. I’m sick of all this bullshit. Pepper said I’d settle down one day, I guess it is gonna be sooner than she thought,” Tony shrugged.
“Sorry, I don’t drink,” Steve excused himself. Wanda tilted her head.
Steve wasn't sure how long he waited for Tony, fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe? He was so lost in his reveries that he didn't see time pass by. He was starting to worry when Tony's voice spoke through the comm.
"Yep. I guess I figure it out on my own." Tony says looking around.
Steve walked towards the group of partnerships reunited in the garden, all of them had a glass of wine in their hands. Steve walked closer and closer to the light and stopped when he saw a profile. He had seen this same face today when he was searching about her on the Internet, that red hair was typical of her. What a director of marketing was doing here?
"Honey, you know we can't." Tony turns his gaze to the crowd around them leaving the theaters, he's biting his bottom lip, a clear sign that it bothers him as much as it bothers Steve. "Same-sex relationships will only be allowed in 1976 in California."
There's bell sign, then the elevator doors open on the floor, Steve slides in followed by Hank and Tony.
The couple had finally decided and was paying for the beer when from the corner of his eyes Steve saw the fifteen years old kid being cornered and insulted for the other three. A familiar feeling tickles inside Steve, he truly hates bullies, before he realizes, he is walking in the teenagers' direction.
"I-I, it's just..." Tony cut him off one more time.
Tony looks around, there were many families and friends hosted there since they're in mid-July, vacation time, yay!
"FRIDAY, Trace the call, will you?" Tony asks the AI that quickly agrees to her boss request. "They don't have this technology yet."
Steve mumbles something close to his shoulder, but Tony is too distracted with the overwhelmed pleasure that his body is receiving now to pay attention to something else. Steve does not seem to mind his lack of attention, though. He keeps pumping his cock with his amazing hands, and Tony feels his cock throbs inside Steve's hand, he's close, damn, he's so fucking close.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yep, I think so,” he replied, looking down at the documents in his hands.
"Why don't you try on that one?" Tony says, less embarrassed now, while pointing to a spot behind the blond. He turns around to see that Tony was pointing to a black leather jacket in the shop window.
Massage always leads to sex. Steve and Bucky know it.
"S'okay. I'll be fine, we have to go." Steve says softly taking Tony out of his trance.
Warning: smut at the beginning of the chapter.
Tony sat by his side, taking Steve’s hands into his.
Steve wasn't surprised when Tony pulls some kind of tool out of his pocket and opened the door of the lab so effortlessly, that genius probably brought all his lab inside of his pockets, all those nanotech things were crazy, and Steve thought that he would never catch on it, no matter how many times Tony had explained to him how it works.
“Come here, Tony,” Steve called when they finished the table, and Peggy started to sit down. Bucky was the last that came from the kitchen, holding a bottle of wine. Steve narrowed his lips, he hadn’t mentioned that Tony wasn’t drinking anymore, and he does not want to make him uncomfortable among his friends. Bucky poured the red liquid into the glasses.
What happened in Sokovia saved plenty of lives. God, saved a lot of lives otherwise the whole world would be dead by now, and he felt relieved for the lives and families saved and together now, but it was still the deaths that weight inside his chest, it was the deads who not allow him to sleep at night. All the lives matter, all humans being deserved to be happy. To have a future.
Steve feels small butterflies in his stomach when they walk back into the studio. The remnants of the light bulb's explosion were already gone. People were cleaning up the mess that happened in there, some lamps and clothes on the floor. Steve spots his own camera on the floor, lying where Steve crouched down before Tony pulled him out. However, the main focus was on their intertwined hands. He can feel every single gaze on him and Tony as they walk in.
Then, he narrows his eyes to see what looks exactly like a bomb, the liquid of chemicals going exactly to it, which Tony knows that it can cause a chain reaction and powered the bomb. Yet, Steve is so close to it.
Steve took a shower and put on his best clothes, he shoved the laptop and his portfolio inside his bags and got the keys to his motorcycle. The STRIKE Agency, a curious name for a marketing company, stays in the Queens, so Steve didn’t expect too much traffic in that area at 07:20 a.m. He had heard a lot about STRIKE, and how many people told him it was a terrible place to work and the money wasn’t good enough. It was the kind of enterprise that put a lot of pressure on its staff, and the ambiance wasn’t a healthy one, full of competition, and get a promotion became a kind of a legend there. Oh, Steve couldn’t forget the fact that STRIKE was being accused and prosecuted by many workers with allegations of racism and homophobia, which was really awful and unspeakable. However, Steve couldn’t be picky right now, he needed a job and he would get whatever comes up from it.
"Sure." Tony licks his lips in a provocative way, Steve's eyes follow his tongue.
It's just a stupid beneficient ball, whose Alpha Tony is talking right now is giving to raise funds for charity. Well, that was what he and all the media said, but the Avengers knew better. They knew very well that that ball only serves to undercover Omega’s body traffic, and that is exactly why Tony had volunteered to attract said Alpha. So no matter how much Steve wanted to punch the Alpha in the face, he knows he can’t do it. He can’t disclose the other Avengers split in the building. He can’t jeopardize the whole mission because his Alpha’s instincts are telling him to keep his Omega away from the man.
Steve laughed. Bucky ended up joining him.
And Tony knows that everything will be alright. His body is just overreacting, he should have known by now that his body betrays him, he is not dying, and he won't go crazy, he should not trust his body. He feels his eyes heavy, his heartbeats slowly matching with Steve's as well as his breathe. It's okay, his mind repeats like a tranquilizer, like a lullaby to himself. It's okay. It's okay.
“Am I?” Tony said, taking off his sunglasses.
"They'll come after us," Steve says.
"I crossed with her in the hallway. Me and, Uhm, Howard."
"I won't take long," Tony says, shrugging. He is already enjoying her goodwill, it is not right if he took her time, too.
“Holy shit!” Steve turns his head to the door, seeing Bruce standing there, his eyes now covered by his hands. “Sorry. I--I--I’ll tell the others you’re unavailable,” Bruce’s neck and face in a scarlet ton of red. He stumbled and dropped a chair on his way out. Tony bursts into loud laughter that has Steve quickly following.
Tony observes his abs and biceps taking off the shirt, he watches each move Steve does attentively with desire. Steve sighs noticing his stare.
Five minutes had passed since Steve went into the office when Hank appears again walking straight to Tony's direction. Damn it, Tony thinks, taking a step forward to stop Hank.
The hallway was empty. Tony got in and closed the door behind him, in the meanwhile Steve walks to the corner of the hallway, both sides were almost empty, there are some women working in a room, and two men talking while they ate their brunch, they were too distant and too distracted to notice Steve.
“Good morning. I’m…”
tight hug," Steve says, smiling. Tony lifts a brow as he was saying
"Shit." She mumbles to herself, rubbing her eyes to get rid of the sleepy sensation.
“Yeah, okay. Where is it?” Steve leaned down to write the address Sam was saying. “I’ll be there in twenty minutes.”
He went to the kitchen, turning off the coffee machine, and poured the black liquid on his cup. Steve twitches his nose at the bitter taste of it. He usually splashes some milk on his coffee, but since they ran out of milk two days ago Steve hadn’t had the chance to go to the grocery store, and Bucky was way too busier than Steve. Steve prepared some scrambled eggs for him, again, Steve remembers he needs to do the grocery to get bacon. He makes a mental list to go get supplies as soon as he goes home.
“Why the hell did it explode?” Wanda asked Natasha, she was holding an unused, new light bulb. The red-haired was massaging her temple like she had woken up from a terrible dream.
"We need to get the Tesseract," She replies quickly.
Tony was looking to the holograms on the table, he was working in a new project, a new compound for the avengers, even though he and Steve were retired, there were still the others, Wanda, Sam, Bucky and Peter, they were technically integrating the new avengers’ team. And Tony wanted to settle them in a new and comfortable place, alike to the old compound. He has been working hard on it, more than he actually should. According to the doctors he was still in recovery, but when Tony puts an idea in his head, he never can get rid of it, it has to be done, complete, so he can rest until he finds another crazy idea. For now, everything was perfect.
When they finally can get rid of the agents, they hid inside a lab, ready to fight with anyone who comes over. Tony takes a deep breath, leaning against the wall. Well, these are the moments he envy Steve and that supersoldier serum, because Steve seemed fine, he wasn't panting as Tony to recover his breath, even if they ran through the stairs.
“Of course,” Wanda smirked.
"Who are you?" Steve stops beside Tony watching the guy. The man smirks mischievously and his eyes fall on Steve.
"I-I-" The brunet stuttered, while his eyes lower and stop on Steve's pink lips.
They run through the labs, this place is a fucking maze. Luckily the event should already begin because there aren't any civilians in that floor.
"I always deal with it alone."
Tony had to walk for a bunch of other warehouses before he reaches the one that FRIDAY indicates the call was made. At first, it looked like an ordinary warehouse, then Tony saw guards in their post at the entry, they carried rifles and other advanced weaponry. Tony saw vehicles parked on the left side of the place, from daily cars to big trucks, it looks that HYDRA is prepared for war.
“It’s okay. I--I’ve never asked--”
“Great. I guess we should say what we’re thankful for this year,” Peggy started. “Anyone want to begin?”
"I want to take the day off." Steve states. "We have four days left we should enjoy while we can, you know, before we come back to reality and have to deal with this whole Thanos' stuff again." Tony smiles gently and Steve holds his hand in his. "I want to take you on a date."
Steve can't do anything, but smiles. Everything becomes a joke to Tony. The way the genius plays with the words was just fascinating to Steve, it used to annoy Steve in the beginning, when they first met, but not anymore. Steve had learned to love and appreciate those flaws of the billionaire's. Always laughing in the face of danger, it drives Steve crazy with concern.
Tony throws himself on the couch beside Steve. The blond look at him to see that he was holding the jellies gum he had bought earlier. Steve smiles, of course, Tony would take dessert.
Then, Tony put his best face on, Steve didn't have to know that he was hurt. They're nothing. Steve didn't owe any explanation to him and the soldier already have broken Tony's heart a few times, this wasn't different, even though it hurts the same way. Also, Tony remembered himself, he is good hiding his feeling, he had done it a thousand times and no one ever noticed or cared about, well, except for Natasha, that triple imposter seemed to know more about him than himself. So, Tony stepped forward.
She sighs concerned, rubbing her hands all the way on her face to her hair. A door opens and she turns to see who is coming in.
He doesn’t even hesitate. He took off his clothes and got on his knees on the couch, bending over the back of the couch. He heard the sound of Steve undressing and going away to get the lube. He comes back soon. Steve put one of his hands on Bucky’s shoulder while the other hand gripped on his waist. Steve massaged his muscles there, caressing his neck and sending pleasure shivers all over Bucky’s body while he pressed his length between Bucky’s cheeks.
I didn't forget today ;)
As much as he disliked all of this, he couldn't stand to see Tony hurt again, but once they're back to the 21st century, he would be able to show his affection for Tony, without receiving so much hatred looks as he surely does in the seventies.
He leaves the sketchbook on the couch and opens the door of the apartment to head to the rooftop. The morning wind is cold and strong, his hair ruffles everywhere, the sunlight is still weak in the horizon, but it gives the sky an exquisite view, painting it with tones of light and dark blue, and weak yellow.
"A fire devastated a warehouse in San Francisco yesterday, according to the Fire Department the fire started around 7:30 p.m. due to an electrical malfunction. The police say there were five casualties, including the director of the biomedical company, Thomas Pierce, and seven more injured. The victims were taken to the hospital..." Steve puts the TV in the mute, after seeing Tony's countenance.
“I’m great, thank you,” Tony said, reaching for Steve’s lips in a soft kiss.
“I thought you liked--”
Maria was a taller woman who exhaled discipline and dominance. She was in the Army for a few years, but now she worked at the FBI. Steve met her when he went to one of Sam’s support group reunion. Even though Sam and Maria weren’t part of the military anymore, they were always involved with beneficent projects, support groups, and getting help for veterans.
Steve keeps a safe distance from them, watching when the man pulled out a key and opened a large door. Tony’s eyes met his for just a few seconds, his brown eyes looked defocused, Steve notices. Suddenly, a terrible thought comes to his mind: drugs. Tony is drugged. Holy fucking shit. Steve rushes into the hallway, but he didn’t reach them in time, the door slams with a loud bang, and Steve didn’t listen to any key locking the door from inside.
Then, something rolled in the passage they were, and before anyone had gotten the chance of yelling, that thing blew up. So, when those lightbulbs exploded, Steve found himself back there. And he was scared because he did not want to be there anymore. He loved his country, but he had people who loved him waiting for him outside. Bucky, Peggy, Sam… that’s why Steve decided he was done with the battlefield. He could fight here, in his apartment, supporting manifestations, and voting, and following politics, that’s how he would be able to make a difference for his country. That’s how he would fight for those he loved. Bucky, Peggy, Sam… and now he also has Tony.
“Sweetheart, I’m sorry, I really can’t,” he apologetically kisses the back of Steve’s hand, giving it a tender squeeze. “But I’ll be back tonight.”
As his ideas often prove to be, Tony is right. There Steve really is, spread out on the workshop couch with folded legs, knees pointed toward the ceiling and revealing the comfortable grey sweatpants he’s thrown on, a fitting choice considering the simple t-shirt that he’s traded his Captain America suit for. Tony can’t help but smile affectionately (thank God no one is around to notice just how dumbly in love he is) at the sight of Steve’s domestic looks: how is it that Steve Rogers always manages to look so unbearably lovely no matter what he does? Then, he notices something else — on the floor, right next to the couch, lies Steve’s phone, a pair of headphones connected to it. Listening to music, Steve must have not heard Tony coming in, so the brunet takes another step closer, torn between watching his boyfriend’s relaxed features, which he finds adorable, and signalling his presence.
If there is one thing that Tony Stark is undeniably the master of, among other skills related to the insightful understanding of technology or the adroit use of screwdrivers, it is without the shadow of a doubt the ability to find Steve Rogers inside the Avengers Tower. Whenever the two are separated, it seems Tony has gotten particularly good at guessing what Steve might be up to in the meantime: he knows that Steve likes to enjoy a cup of tea in the evening, two hours or so after dinner, so the kitchen would be the best place to spot the Captain, the soft look on his face paired the casual clothes he usually wears at the end of a long day; if not in the kitchen, it means that Steve already made himself comfortable on the living room sofa, catching up on the latest book he’s been reading or chatting with one of the Avengers who might have passed by. And when Tony shows up, he is sure that Steve will give him one of his signature smiles and wait for him to take a seat by his side before nestling beside him, exchanging kisses and hugs when no one is around to disrupt their intimacy.
. He needed to tell Tony about his feeling, as soon as possible, he needed to confess it, otherwise, this lack of knowledge about Tony's own feelings would drive him crazy.
"Wow, it sounds fantastic!" Tony tries to sound interested, but what he really wants is to take a good look at the footage. Steve surely must appear on them, he could know what happened or at least, have an idea. "Do you mind if I take a look? I love all this technology stuff and This one you're talking seems quite unbelievable."
They stayed quiet for a couple of minutes before Tony decides to get rid of the heavy burden inside his chest, he needed to tell it to someone, let the words flow out loud.
As usual, sleeping didn’t go okay. Steve woke up hours late shaking and covered in sweat. He reached out for the glass of water on the nightstand, bringing it to his lips. However, he can’t keep himself steady enough for the task and the glass shakes against his teeth as he felt the cool water going down his dry mouth, at the same time undoing the thick lump formed in his throat. It’s relieving, but not enough to drag Steve back to sleep. It never is, and never will be.  The soldier puts the glass back and takes his phone, lightening the darkroom. The sudden glow makes Steve shield his eyes for a moment, blinking before adjusting to it.
It was late, there is so much to be done tomorrow and here Tony Stark is, folding clothes non-stop because he can't turn his mind off for a damn second, he can't stop thinking about everything that can go wrong tomorrow, and how risky this mission to steal two Pym particles is.
Natasha is bored on Halloween. Thankfully, her boyfriend is there to cheer her up.
It was around 9 pm, there aren't so many people walking on the beach, they had passed for a group of teenagers, one of them playing the guitar while the others sang, sat around a bonfire. The rest of the people around there keep their distance walking in the sidewalk.
Tony bites his bottom lip until his mouth tastes blood. A terrible habit of his when things don't go as planned and he feels like he should find a solution.
“How do you know?” Steve asked, genuinely curious.
Steve was in front of the Stark Tower at 04 p.m. He sent a text to Tony who only answered with a winky face, apparently, Tony’s favorite emoji according to the bunch of messages they’ve sent each other those past weeks.
“What did you say?” Bucky asked with a smirk on his face. Steve rolled his eyes.
"Thank you for waking me up." His voice is nothing more than a whisper, it sounds broken heart to Tony's ears. Tony shrugged.
"I'm gonna train, will you be alright?" Steve asks almost politely.
"Are they back?" Bruce asks, a slight smile on his face that fades away slowly when he sees Natasha's countenance.
Tony glances up at Steve. He doesn't even have a reaction when more men come downstairs. Steve takes Tony by the wrist pulling him downstairs, they need to reach the ground floor and find an emergency exit, they need to get the hell out of that place, because they already caused too much damage.
"I know, Steve."
"No. But it is probably the best chance we have to go back home sooner. Hank is going there when he comes back."
"Better get more than a pair, we might not have time to shop later," Tony says and Steve nods in agreement.
They were a fucking mess, Steve thought.
“Yes. She works in Human Resources. Do you know her?” She asked, and quickly waved her hand. “Of course you know her. She was in the military.” Natasha murmured more to herself than to Steve, though the blond nodded affirmatively. Natasha handed a couple of documents to Steve. The soldier looked down at it before reading them attentively, ignoring Natasha’s firm gaze on him.
Tony crosses the street back, going in the bakery. He greets the boy in the cashier and goes to the showcase, his eyes fall on the apple pie. He needs to find Steve, no matter what.
"What about the Tesseract?" Steve asks.
The door opened and a man came in. He wears an elegant black suit, his hands are inside his pocket, but with Tony still wearing his glasses, he could see that this man did not carry any weapon with him.
"We need to go back to the base," Tony speaks suddenly. He looks up to Steve. "We need to get our stuff back... Uh... I mean our clothes." He was on the edge of breakdown again, he was already hyperventilating, this whole situation surely got in his neves.
"Good luck in that mission, Captain." He says. The Captain glances up.
“And will you let me sleep?” Tony mumbles, lifting a brow while a sassy smile is playing on his lips. Steve looks deep in those almonds eyes.
Tony got on his feet swiftly reaching a hand out to Steve that roll his eyes, taking it and intertwined their fingers following Tony's out of the roof. The sun was already high in the sky.
Steve grabs Tony by the wrist, he looks surprised by the soldier act, like he had forgotten for a minute where and in which year they were. His eyes widened when Steve pulls him when he runs to the back or maybe the front of the building, Tony wasn't sure about which side of the building they were.
Steve lifted up his head suddenly, staring at Tony, who seemed a little surprised by his sudden movement. Since they started to hang out together, Tony had never mentioned his parents, he barely spoke about his past. Steve could never judge him, however, since the soldier, himself, had never spoken about his parents, his childhood, and his time in the army. So, he could not ask Tony what he wasn’t willing to give either, but now that Tony started talking, Steve felt like he needed to open up with the man, too.
“Yeah,” Steve leaned his head on the wall. “He died when I was 8, which was a relief for us, though she had to double shift. She passed away when I was 18,” Tony hasn’t looked away not even for a while, attentive to Steve’s words. “Then, Bucky was all the family I had.”
They broke the kiss, both gasping for air. Tony looked deep in those blue eyes, as clear as the summer sky. He liked it, no, he
Steve left. Tiredness started to catch up with him.
“No, you won’t,” says Steve kissing the scars on Tony’s neck. The scars covered the right side of his face, as well as his entire right arm, consequences of the snap. A battle always leaves its scars.
The man on the floor groaned in pain behind them, their glance back while the man crawled out of the alley. Steve's hand now resting on Tony's waist. The billionaire frowned.
“Well, we don’t exactly pay for the food since Peggy always sent dinner for us. Anyway, you know I don’t mind, Stevie,” Bucky argued. “I’m with till the end of the line, pal.”
I know we kinda have a plot twist last chapter, but it's gonna be alright.
The pub wasn't as crowded as the last night he had been here with Steve, though it was still early. He hasn't drank any alcoholic beverage in a long time. The bartender put the glass in front of him and he faced the amber liquid scowling at it like it was poison, which matter-of-factly is.
"This... This is not possible." Natasha sighs exasperatedly at this statement like she already had had that conversation.
“Good,” Steve smiled. His eyes focused on Tony’s beauty, still inebriated by the wonderful scent of his Omega. “Love you,” Steve said, though he didn’t allow to Tony said it back, the desire to kiss those red and swollen lips more urgent than ever. They’re too caught up on each other to notice the door opening before a voice shout.
"Someone once said that love is weakness, Mr. Stark. I saw that whoever said it wasn't wrong at all." He tsked.
They hear steps running fast on the stairs, then in the hallway, the figure passes straight from their door, bump in something, they only hear the person saying ouch. Then, the figure comes back and stops in front of their doorframe with a hand on his knee.
Tony smiles at Steve's answer while he finishes the bandages on his shoulder, even the blond can't help but smiles. Tony leans and drops a sweet and tender kiss on Steve's lips. Deep down he was relieved for Steve being safe. Tony moves away, but Steve pulls him back for another kiss, this one is needy and smooth as they haven't kissed a long time. It's warm and sweet, and Tony can't get enough of it.
“Okay. We will keep it tomorrow,” Natasha shouts. “When I arrange new light bulbs. You’re all dismissed for today,” she tilts her head. Everyone nods in understanding. “Steve, I need to talk to you in the office,” Natasha says close to the blond. Steve looks down at her, nodding.
"There;" Tony shouts overwhelmed with the pleasure his body is experiencing while Steve thrusts in the same spot. Tony grabs the sheets, his knuckles turning white when his cock throbs on Steve's hand who keep pumping it harder now. "I'm gonna cum." Steve smiles.
"Guess that's our signal," Steve says by his side.
Natasha waves her hand to Steve to follow. The blond looks quickly to where Tony’s standing with Wanda, but the brunet is too focused on explaining energy, electricity, and physics to look back at him. Steve does not see any other option than follow the red-haired into her office.
"What did you tell her?" He asked curiously.
"Go to hell," Tony replies.
Steve lets go of Tony’s hands to catch his camera on the ground, cleaning the dirt with the back of his sweater. Tony, on the other hand, takes the light bulb from Wanda’s hand, rolling it in his hands.
"Oh" Tony lets out. Steve's eyes fixed on him, waiting for any reaction, but Tony's face keep steady, nothing. "I'm... flattered?" his tony of voice is incertain, is Tony embarrassed again? He sounds like he is.
Hank asks Tony about the project he is developing, he seems genuinely interested in Tony's idea about clean energy to the world and the benefits it can bring to the countryside and how it can have an impact on disadvantaged populations all around the globe. Steve remains silent all the way down, but Tony knows that the supersoldier is attentive to every person who comes in and out of the elevator.
Steve gets himself comfortable with Tony, who had just kicked out his shoes and was chilling on the couch as the episode played on TV. Tony snuggled close when Steve sat. The blond couldn’t help to wrap his face around the model’s shoulders, pulling him closer to place a gentle kiss on the top of his head. This only encourages Tony to put a kiss on Steve’s chin. He needs to shave soon, tonight, otherwise, he could already listen to Peggy's complaints about Steve’s appearance at the Thanksgiving dinner.
I hope you like this chapter!
“Steve hasn’t mentioned you didn’t drink, Tony,” Peggy said.
“Wow. I had no idea,” Steve shifts uncomfortably on his seat. “Are you okay with this?” He waves his hand.
I know I put 10 chapters there, but I'm thinking it can have around 12 - 14 since the chapters are getting way too long.
"No, I'm just..." Tony stops when he looks the spot behind her, he puts his glasses on. It is small for the actual technology, but it is there, he can see it clearly. "Do you have security cameras outside the bakery?" He tries to sound casual, but there is too much interest and a certain excitement in his voice.
"Get down," Steve mouths.
Tony takes a deep breath, closing his eyes for a second, feeling the tightness of Steve's arm dissipates when he let go of Tony. The brunet glances up to the old man on the window.
Tony seems to think a little before replying.
The elevator emitted a bell sign again and the door opened to reveal a corridor filled with several labs well-equipped, any project could be developed in here, and they definitely had the best technology of the seventies.
"It's okay," Steve muttered.
"That's not true." Steve blushes.
“My fiancée proposed to me two weeks ago,” when the confusion didn’t disappear from Steve’s face, Wanda continued. “She has good taste, don’t you think?”
Tony shut his eyes for a second, and Steve tells him to wait for him.
Day 22: Come Inflation
"We need to go downtown." The blond finally answers. "A ride would be welcome."
"Yeah, dad cheats on my mom. It sucks." Tony shrugged.
Steve laughs a really genuine laughter, the only person who can make him laughs like that is Tony. He missed it when he was away, he missed Tony, their talks, God, even their fights he had missed.
A cheerful song starts to play and Wanda joins Peter and Morgan on the dance floor, while Clint finds a quick excuse to leave the couple alone, in fact, he goes to help Bruce who was trying to stop Thor from drinking the whole beer of the wedding. Then, Steve turns to face Tony who was still holding the glass, Steve looks to it, but before he could even open his mouth, Tony frowned his brows and started to talk.
"Fuck." Tony clenches his fist on the table. "You think they expected that someone would steal it? It doesn't make much sense."
They were crossing the street now, the Army Base on the opposite side, when a car turned the corner at fast speed. Tony was too absent-minded to notice it. He probably would be hit and dead now if he hasn't felt someone pulling the lab coat he was wearing, he bumped his back against Steve's chest, the blond suddenly hit by an adrenaline spike, Steve crossed his arm in front of Tony, holding him tight against his own chest in a protective way, pulling him back to the sidewalk. The car kept his way down on the road, everything had happened so fast.
The blond forces two pills inside his mouth, muttering something that sounds like "painkillers", then he feels Steve presses a wet cloth against his temple, and it stings, the smell of 70% alcohol in his nostrils, his bottom lips stings when another cloth is pressed against it.
Steve thrusts again, and this time the hand slide from his lower belly to his cock, Steve's thumb circle the head of his cock slowly, and Tony thrust in his hand, eager for friction, Steve is good with his hands, Tony knows it now, he attempts to thrust one more against his hand eager for the blond's touch. And Steve starts to pump his cock, the sensation of pleasure takes over Tony, and the brunet lets his head falls backward, his lips parted widely with the astonishing sensation.
Steve's voice sounds almost sad with the statement, and Tony understands it. Going back means to face their problems, Thanos' snap, bring everyone back, - not that this is bad, far from it, they have mourned for their vanished friends for five long years -, but deep down they were done from the all the battles. Since New York, nothing has been the same.
"I like seeing you're wearing one. It suits you" Steve blushes, he was a little surprised that Tony notices the clothes he wears. "Consider it a late birthday gift," Tony says blinking at him and going to the cashier. Well, Steve's birthday was two weeks ago, except for Nat he didn't think anyone else would remember it, though he didn't actually celebrate his birthday anymore.
The man leans closer to Tony’s ear whispering something, then Tony smiles before nodding in agreement. Honestly, Steve hates Tony’s acting skills, he can be really convincing, actually almost as good as Natasha, the Russian spy of the team, she could quickly change her accent and adjust her corporal behavior to sound natural in any culture, any country. She fits everywhere.
"Will you stay together?" The woman asking furrowing, her mouth turns into a thin line.
“It’s late,” whispers Steve while burying his face on the curve of the brunette’s neck. Tony closes his eyes, leaning his head back to the blond’s shoulder. He loves feeling Steve’s arms around him, that was definitely his favorite place in the world, no doubts.
“I love you three thousand,” Morgan answers back giggling. Tony’s eyes full watered. He gets up and walks to the door, Steve was keeping the door opened so Tony passes.
Steve takes two steps back, the distance between him and the bomb grows a little, and the blond turns his head to Tony's direction. Tony opens his mouth to shout, to say something, but there is no time.
Steve checked the hour on the nightstand, it was pretty late, he probably should drag Tony out from the lab to the bed, otherwise, he knew the brunette would work all night. The soldier goes downstairs and watches Tony moving the holograms while drinking something from his mug, probably, coffee. He loves watching Tony while he’s working. He is so focused on what he’s doing that he didn’t even realize Steve approaching.
“I know, but I do mind,” Steve turned the tap on, and the water fell on the dirty plates in the sink. “I have an interview tomorrow. Whatever it will be, I don’t know, I’m going to job hunting again,” Steve rubbed the sponge on the white plates. He looked at Bucky leaned against the doorframe with his arms crossed on his chest. The dark-haired sighed.
, his laugh is so pleasant.
There's no way out. Tony knows that when the five guys cornered him and a foot hit him on the ribs, making him gasp for air feeling the pain spreads on his abdomen. Before he could catch his breath another kick hit his back. He wouldn't beg, he's Tony Stark, after all, he couldn't fight five guys with his own fist at once, he was highly outnumbered and these guys are such a coward.
Tony closes his eyes, taking a long breath filling his lungs with so much air that his chest clenches so hard that it becomes painful. Tears rolling thick and fast down his face, therefore he holds his sobs clenching his jaw until he feels his head aching.
“We’re dating?” The furrow between his brows is visible. Confusion is evident on Tony’s face.
Natasha looks curious to the also yellowed envelope before reach out for it. There is nothing written in front of it, it's not even sealed and for a moment Natasha thinks to put it back, the book was Steve's after all, every content in it would be only for him, She should not poke one's nose into his secrets. But she can't stop wondering about how this book ends up in her room, and how all of it seems so odd.
Natasha just hoped that wherever they are, they are fine. She also expects that they finally had confessed their feeling for each other, because after everything that they went through they really deserved to be happy.
“Not so far. Everything is well described here,” Steve said, leaning against the chair, suddenly more relieved.
"Steve. I-" Tony feels his cock throbbing. "I'm gonna cum." Steve takes Tony's deep in his throat, Tony's thrust and come inside of his mouth, Steve swallows the hot seed that the brunet slips out, licking his lips with satisfaction. "Damn it, Steve, where did you learn doing that?" Tony pants, the blond smiles gasping, his cheeks in a heat ton of red. Then, he drops a kiss on Tony's lips, his hands sliding on the side of the billionaire's body.
They are a mess, but a beautiful and lovely mess. Steve lies down beside Tony, his eyes closed. Both gasping for the exceptional sex. They were covered in sweat and cum, but they don't mind it.
"'Morning, Stevie" The billionaire replies, emphasizing the blond's nickname.
"I'm fine, sir. Thank you for asking." He was hyperventilating, his body wasn't calming down the way he expects. He looks to Steve almost claiming for help, he had helped him to calm down last night, so maybe, maybe he could help him again.
“It’ll be my greatest honor.”
Time passes by real fast on the road after that night. Steve and Tony were more talkative and intimate with each other. They were taking back for years of being secretly in love in just hours, they talked a lot about everything, their feelings and the moment they realized they loved each other.
Tony parks the car. They take the elevator up to the penthouse, and Steve has to admit that they can’t keep their hands to themselves.
When Tony got out of the bath, he was fully dressed. Steve wasn't in the room anymore, which means that he was probably waiting for him downstairs. Tony takes the intelligent glasses on the nightstand and puts them on, also grabbing the lab coat he was wearing yesterday, with so much happening at once, they had forgotten to collect their clothes in the army base laundromat, now they must come back for collecting them and also learning more about Hank Pym whereabouts, in order to take the stones to 2023.
Tony was saying something, but he could not listen. The sound was muffled as if Steve was underwater. The sound was pressure against his ears, and Steve was afraid that if he took his hands out, he would not be able to handle the noise out there.
“I must warn you now, I don’t know how to dance though,” Steve laughs softly against Tony, trying to find an appropriate position. “But you make me fearless, so, I guess we’re doing it anyways.”
“Hey there, sleeping beauty,” Tony teases fondly from the other end of the couch as Steve removes the headphones. “I was looking for you. Figured you’d be down there.”
"Hey honey, are you okay? How was the mission? Are you hurt?" Tony's eyebrows knit together in suppressed shock, seeing Steve look so tired and drained after a long day always being cause for concern. His gaze lands on the dark patches staining his boyfriend's skin, scanning it for cuts and bruises.
Glancing at Steve, Tony notices that his boyfriend has opened his eyes, the tired blue of his iris glistening with a rather sad expression under dark lashes.
“Well… Fifteen. On repeat for the past fifteen minutes,” Steve admits with a guilty chuckle. “It’s really good, but so is the rest of the album. I’ve never gone through anything like that, but ever since I’m with you, those sappy love songs make perfect sense.”
As Steve quickly notes, they are headed to the bathroom. Another five minutes, and Tony is rather vigorously—for someone completely worried over the Captain's health just seconds ago— helping Steve get his suit off, setting it aside as soon as he's finished, then gesturing toward the bathtub.
Reaching for a bar of soap, Tony devotes himself to what he set his mind to. First, he rubs his own hands against its smooth surface before sliding them down Steve's shoulders and back, feeling the Captain's tense muscles progressively unwind beneath his fingertips, yielding to his caresses. Tony's every touch is careful, full of tenderness and preoccupation as all he wants is to get Steve to loosen up fully. Steve even chuckles as Tony wipes the dirt off his jaw, taking care of all the smeary spots the blond felt so self-conscious about; now, Steve has unquestionably shaken off his fear of being seen by his boyfriend.
“How hard can it be?” Steve smiles, his mood lighter. “Thor, Hawkeye and Hulk just play video games or train all day and eat, Sam is usually busy with classes or tech, and Natasha is the most responsible out of all of us. So I’m sure we’ll be just fine. But you’ll be missed.”
"I always thought I was more of a dog person, but you really did awaken the cat in me," Steve smiles when Tony brings up the subject again, pressing a gentle kiss into Tony's neck. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, Tony Stark."
“Really, you do?” Steve’s excitement makes Tony’s heart somersault: seeing how much happier he’s gotten over the weeks never fails to move him, the contrast being stark indeed with the first time they met, all clenched jaws and tension.
A little later, when they're snuggling together in their shared bed, Tony's cat theory proves right once again. It only takes for the brunet to touch Steve's hair for the Captain to lean into Tony's hand, even nudging Tony's shoulder with his head as he's huddled up right against him.
“Yes, I have to,” he whispers into Steve’s hair, leaving a kiss on top of his head.
“I thought I’d catch up on what people are listening to nowadays,” Steve explains, cheeks flushing slightly as he scratches the nape of his neck. “Well, here goes nothing. I was listening to Taylor Swift. I know this is not the kind of music you usually listen to, but it’s actually really good. I mean, it’s so different from what he had in the 40’s, but I think I would’ve liked to have that back then.”
"I really like it when people say that," Tony huffs amusedly. "But especially when it's you."
This time, the Captain gives up, sighing as his head moves in two small nods. He eventually gives Tony a resigned smile. “I’ll be waiting for you then.”
“Yeah.”
“And I don’t know why…” Tony begins, smiling so widely he struggles not to throw himself at Steve instantly in spite of another amused eye roll. “But with you I dance,” he takes Steve’s hand resolutely, getting up himself.
“No need to apologize, this is as much my place as yours now,” Tony shrugs, handing Steve the mug. “Since you weren’t in the kitchen, I figured you’d need your tea.”
“Says you.”
"Steve, after all the times you've taken care of me, that's the least I could do. And don't tell anyone, but I'm actually enjoying it," he murmurs against Steve's ear, making his boyfriend laugh anew. "Has anyone ever told you you're a cat at heart?"
All Steve can do is fondly roll his eyes, slightly tightening the grasp of his arm, which is slid across Tony's chest in a loving embrace. And, when Tony begins stroking his hair again, Steve is sure that if he were able to, he would've in truth started purring.
And indeed, as Steve savours the last minutes of his bath Tony exits the bathroom, promising that he'll be back. When he reappears, a couple of minutes later, it's with a bundle of fresh clothes that he hands the blond when the latter gets out of the bathtub—it is, in reality, a win for Tony since he got to pick his favourite shirt for his boyfriend to wear. Helping Steve rub himself dry, he can't resist leaving a few kisses here and there over the man's shoulders and torso, the feather-light pressure of his lips finishing to completely soothe the Captain's mind and body. Steve cups Tony's face into his right hand to give him a passionate kiss on the mouth in return, deeply sighing with pleasure as he feels Tony's hand run through all the length of his wet hair.
“I won’t be gone too long,” his boyfriend reassures him. “And if anyone tries to attack the Earth while I’m gone, I’ll come to your rescue.”
If his boyfriend were to become aware of just how much of a disaster Steve's entire head was in those moments, he'd surely think twice before giving out one of those compliments that make Steve's cheeks flush and his stomach flutter with timid love.
“What do you want?” Steve leans into the palm of his hand, smiling slyly. “I jumped and fell into you, it seems.”
The others don't get one, and Tony's faceplate, as well as being equipped with tech that gave him precious information during combat, had been build with all kinds of systems to keep his face cool and even not be too hard on his eyes. As for Steve, he wasn't gifted any of that—all he was left with was a somewhat protective helmet which, as soon as he engaged into battle or the weather got milder, became gradually insufferable.
“I can’t believe you,” Tony laughs wholeheartedly, leaning forward so he can plant a kiss upon Steve’s forehead. “See you tonight, honey.”
“You’re going to ace this meeting.”
But on that evening, as Tony walks into the kitchen, looking for Steve, nothing but empty space meets his eye in the place where his boyfriend would usually stand. The same happens in the living room, where Steve definitely doesn’t seem to be anywhere around — there isn’t even the trace of a cup or a bookmark, all signs of the other man’s presence having mysteriously vanished from every angle Tony’s gaze sweeps. And if Steve isn’t in the kitchen or in the living room by 8 o'clock… The echos of Tony’s footsteps reverberate through the staircase as he makes his way down the tower, toward the workshop, a mug of tea in hand After the Avengers saved New York for the first time, officially becoming a team, Steve had taken the habit of visiting Tony in the workshop from time to time since their friendship had started to grow stronger. At first, he mostly came down when he needed to clear his head, bringing Tony coffee and quietly settling on the workshop couch with sheepishness that betrayed his worry of maybe not being welcome here (in spite of Tony’s insistance that it’s fine, Rogers. Not everybody has the chance of seeing my genius at work, and Steve’s face would light up, and he’d nod thankfully). He would sit and watch Tony tinker and rattle his brains, somehow soothed by the clicking and banging sounds all around, before getting up and leaving when he felt he overstayed his welcome. A few months later, Steve’s visits were accompanied, alongside coffee, by stolen kisses.
"Are you sure you're alright?"
"Yes, yes, I'm okay," Steve reassures him at once, trying to turn his face away from Tony's piercing brown eyes, already blushing from embarrassment. "I'm just tired. It was a long mission. I'm going to take a shower. I'll see you when I'm done."
“I’m saying you’re a tech genius… Send a hologram instead…” The Captain tries to pull him closer, the tip of his nose bumping against Tony’s back.
“You’re so corny Rogers, has anyone ever told you that?” But Tony’s face is bright with a grin, and he runs his fingers through’s Steve’s humid hair, rolling his eyes. He just can’t resist him, can he?
"Thank you, Tony. You're going through all that trouble for me..."
"Look at you, behaving like such a cat. If I came closer, maybe I could hear you purring..." he hums, fingers circling at the back of Steve's head.
Steve obeys, bending over so he can pick it, and hands it to Tony with an inquiring look, watching him unplug the headphones and busy himself with the object. It isn’t long before notes of music suddenly swirl through the air, emanating from Steve’s phone as Tony sets it aside, and the blond recognising the guitar intro to Fearless, which he’s listened enough to set it aside among other tracks. Steve’s heart catches in his throat, cutting his breath short from the intense rush of affection that washes over him at once: he is so ridiculously smitten, he might just do something absolutely silly. He definitely will, or else, he wouldn’t really be Steve Rogers, would he?
“Alright, you may have a point,” Tony shakes his head, unable to suppress a fugitive smile. “So what’re you listening to?”
“Do you have to go?”
"Alright, I like that better." Tony gives him a smile brimming with all the affection he can't hide—doesn't want to hide. Seeing Steve like this is indeed much better. "Okay, time for phase two."
It has never truly bothered Steve to wear a suit—everyone on the team had one, it came with the job, and although it appeared a little ridiculous in the beginning, the solid material and actually handy gear has grown on Steve so much, he knows his suit's pros and cons like the back of his hand. In most cases, he's thankful for its ability to provide him with both protection and room for fighting, which is what it was primarily designed for, after all. But if there is one thing still bothering Captain America even after all this time wearing it, it's indubitably this: the helmet.
The gentle groan that escapes Steve’s lips, pressed against Tony’s shoulder, makes the brunet’s chest rise then deflate in a chuckle. His heart warm from the adorable clinginess of his boyfriend, he nonetheless has to give him an answer before swinging his legs away from the cosiness of their shared bed, the alarm clock seated upon the bedside table reminding him that he better not be late.
“And what if you don’t?” The blond retorts, the roughness of his voice testifying for the fact that he’s still only half-asleep, though the arm that he maintains wrapped around Tony’s waist expresses rather convincingly that he isn’t going to let him go that easily.
However, there comes a day when even heroes have got to face their fears.
And Steve most certainly doesn't see his coming when, staggering through a corridor of the Avengers tower after a particularly straining mission, he suddenly bumps into Tony. There is one problem though: thinking he was alone, he had taken the helmet off—and by the look washing over the brunet's face, Steve can easily guess that he must be resembling whatever the epitome of mess is.
"Better," Steve gives Tony a grateful glance, almost forgetting about the calamitous state his face is still in. "Much better. Thank you."
“That’s only because you’re so stubborn, you never take breaks before you finish.”
“We are. That’s what Taylor wants us to be.”
Then, comes phase three. After seizing the shower head, Tony holds it over Steve, careful not to let the stream flood his eyes, then gets a hold of the bottle of shampoo. He pours some of the vanilla-scented liquid into Steve's hair, then letting his fingers thread through it softly, massaging Steve's skull and neck. The pleased moan that he gets in return, Steve tipping his head back into Tony's hands, is the best reward he can get.
"Get in," he orders, leaving the blond no choice but to comply, undressing completely as he gets inside, which allows Tony to make sure that no severe injuries are paining him. "Now, relax. Let me work the rest." Turning on the hot-water tap, the brunet, arms crossed over his chest and tight-lipped still, watches Steve try to get comfortable until the bathtub is about halfway filled. Only then, after pouring bath soak into the water, do his features at last soften with contentement, glad to hear that a deep sigh of what he believes to be relief just lifted off Steve's chest. "How are you feeling now, soldier?"
"See, my point exactly. You're such a cat." Tony smiles against Steve's mouth, taking a step back to take a look at how truly beautiful Steve is. But the truth is, he always likes him: when Steve comes back from missions all dirty and dishevelled, when he's standing in the bathroom with droplets crystallized on his collarbones and the upper part of his face still bearing faint marks from the helmet he wore for too long, when he wakes up beside him on the mornings Steve sleeps in and when he's mindlessly tracing invisible patterns over his limbs. Any place, any time, any day. He's crazy about him.
"No. I couldn't."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve only slows their paces down when he saw the ugly building in front of them, the ink peeling. Steve got his keys inside his leather jacket, the same that Tony had given him as a birthday gift. That's when Steve lets go of his hand, get in the apartment, and going in the kitchen direction.
“I know, but it’s a lot funnier this way,” Steve justified, shrugging.
