“Well hey, when one doesn’t have internet access, snail mail is the way to go!” Clint remarked. “At least we don’t have to pay customs fees or that like other countries.”
But Natasha was working on making pastry cream, Sam was checking on cookies and muffins, Steve was finishing up the inventory check, and Bucky was working on some cake batter. They all chatted as they worked, nothing too out of the ordinary or serious. It felt like the morning he came in before they opened. Everything was warm, soft, and cozy. It felt like he belonged. There was no pressure for him to do anything; he could just exist if he wanted to.
alright here. It feels familiar in an estranged kind of way. Not the way he is used to, but befitting the situation at hand. It fits and stops the screaming, so he welcomes it with open arms.
And hey, if not even Peter can keep his dad sane and away from the bottle, if even his employees doubt his sanity regarding the situation…
A gentle kiss onto his head.
The groan escaping his lips distantly reminds him of a sixty years old, but every muscle in his body aching for some rest makes it insignificant. With heavy breaths he finally enters the lab through the open door – at least one things seems to stay the same – and leans against the doorframe to his left, because the only chair in the room is occupied. When Tony doesn’t react to his conversational gambit, he adds with a grumpy voice, “You know, the physician you’re forcing me to see, because our team kinda shot me out of the sky?”
side of his old man, trust me.”
He can feel Pops being caught unaware for a moment, unsure of what to say. Maybe he even contemplates to stay for the fraction of a second. Then he catches himself, heaves a deep breath. His subconsciousness pushes him on, it’s alright, it’s the right decision, he
His eyes glance at the sky, searching for a single cloud to bring the desired rain, but not a single one heeds his call. Rain. Heavy drops pelting against the windows and shattering the silence, the cracks of thunder meeting the cracks of his heart and making it bleed, as the world drowns in his sorrow befitting the melancholy taking ahold of him.
And then, when Nate doesn’t lift a finger to follow his request, the panic sets in and the tingling increases to a point that leaves him looking out of the window in open terror. Nothing else is able to form a coherent thought in his mind – something is going on, something really,
When has it all begun to go so horribly, horribly wrong?
“What is going on?”
With an honest smile Peter stops her with a wave of his hand. “Not your fault for having rude customers,” he replies and tries not to use the same word Nate did, while an imaginary
“Julia’s brat? What have I done to deserve you visiting me all the way out here?”
“For the record, you threatened and kidnapped me.”
And slowly things begin to come back to him.
The doubts fade away and make way for sweet hope which he welcomes back with open arms, as his eyes roam over the expensive stations. He can do this, hours of looking over his dad’s shoulder and programming stuff his parents really shouldn’t know about with Ned give him the confidence to scramble to the closest desk.
Right.
For the first time in forever the absence of the usual background noise of New York is not pressing down onto his chest, instead the absolute silence wraps like a blanket around his trembling shoulders and keeps him afloat in a sea of misery.
Instead he lets the fear finally take over and tears the place apart on his search for them.
He won’t.
“Fucking asshole,” Nate mumbles from above Peter, while he kneels on the ground and picks up the pieces of his broken glass. He can feel the glare his companion sends at the back of the guy’s head (who is way too tall to call him an asshole, when he is still in hearing distance), before the bell above the door jingles upon him leaving.
A little something to remind him of why he does all this and leaves everything he has ever known behind.
He wants to scream
And then, after they drove past the oblivious guard with Peter hiding at the bottom of the dashboard, he belatedly realizes that he left his bag in his room.
every day, I can’t deal with it. I won’t. From what the others have told me – which is not much by the way – it’s only about to get worse and apparently you and your friends think so, too. So… I’m gonna change that. Unless you’re happy to go back to those days,” he adds with a sarcastic, underlying tone in his voice and then waits for his companion’s reply. He stays silent and Peter isn’t sure whether that is a good or bad sign.
You guys are absolutely amazing and I seriously can't thank you enough for the overwhelming support you showed this lil piece of work. =)  You keep the motivation high - even though there is more than enough atm. I saw the new Spiderman movie finally on Friday last week, since it only came out on the 13th here in Germany. Finally found a friend who likes English as much as I do, so we went to see the original version together. It's amazing. I can't even- It was wonderful. Saw it again in German on Sunday, tomorrow again for my lil sis' birthday! ^-^
He doesn’t understand how the look in his dad’s eyes, already lost and so far away, rips him apart, not really there anymore, not even really listening to their heart-felt goodbyes.
“Nope. And we don’t plan to in the near future.”
Even though Peter is able to smell the alcohol all the way to the door, his father slurs not one bit, which honestly scares him even more than the traumatic stupor he put himself into probably since he left Peter and Rhodey in the exam room.
The voice of the newscaster breaks off and with a trembling breath Peter eagerly sucks in cold air. Still her voice keeps ringing inside of his head, disrupting any thought that tries to form.
It’s obvious what Nate hints at.
Again. One more time. Maybe-
“This is the one Peter made you in kindergarten.”
close – he runs with him towards one of the side doors.
He should find the other Avengers, because someone
Massively.
On the fridge door.
What makes it all worse though is that his dad doesn’t even look surprised. Instead he turns around to one of his projects again, scowl still in place, and mumbles with that rough voice of his Peter gets nauseous of, “You should get ready for school then. Happy will drive you.”
“Perfect.”
“My nephew. Tom. We wanted to visit a family friend, but getting a flight on short notice is a nightmare, you know how it is,” he keeps on blabbing, while all of them know it’s utter bullshit.
“You really shouldn’t be-“
He might know where pops and the others are. This is better than- It’s his chance. The only one to seriously get something done.
“As a matter of fact we do – some ideas, nothing with real proof, but in the current situation…”
“Try saying that to his face.”
Peter flinches. A shout. His own.
He broke the fridge with terrifying ease.
“Stop!”
And then Peter kicks off something he didn’t see coming.
“He won’t notice shit,” Peter mumbles bitterly and crosses his arms in front of his chest. Nate’s eyes seem to bore into the back of his head.
With a raised voice and directly aimed at his father, he continues.
“I swear to God this guy is trying to kill me.”
this, the flight, the running away, the thinking about it, the fucking truth for once from someone who gains nothing from lying to him – he exclaims with a trembling voice,
When he throws a glance over his shoulder, he knows he has struck a nerve.
All dad said to him was to get some rest. It made Peter want to scream and shout, but not a single word left his lips, when Tony escaped as soon as the bitter sobs stopped. Not a single question answered, not a single explanation or excuse why Peter’s world is shattered into irreparable pieces.
And now they have moved out to a place that feels too sterile and empty to really be home. Not that he is going to tell his dads any of it.
“By the time we reach one of the major airports in New York City, Stark will be all over the place with his AI. We have not the slightest chance to get away unseen if there is even one security camera he can hack into.”
The first things he throws into the large backpack are some spare clothes.
If he is sure of anything right now, it’s that.
Not a question, but a statement. Tony answers anyway.
He has to be careful – one wrong move and Tony shies away again like he always tends to do when faced with things he can’t solve. Not on his own anyway. So he stays silent for a moment. Regards the tense form of his best friend and tries to ignore the flaring pain in his leg.
While their words register in his mind, Peter is still stuck on the first paralyzing thought.
Even five seconds can stretch infinitely long; his father might get injured, get sick and they wouldn’t even know, no help from outside, he would literally be all alone and if something worse would occur, if he would follow dad’s lead –
“You’ll try to find and contact them?”
A weary sigh.
The rooms are empty; each door he tears open, each time he glances inside with whatever is left inside of him to hope. Nothing. No one.
„Peter?“
They should have noticed him, for how loud their voices are they have to be standing right beside the desk he is currently not ideally hidden under. One glance, one slip-up from Peter-
“Please, I need your help.”
Should he try to find them in his dad’s lab?
Peter stops dead in his tracks and leans against the wall to his left, when his knees buckle under his weight and the immense relief coursing through his body. A stupid smile spreads on his lips and a laugh is on the tip of his tongue, as he takes a deep and refreshing breath. Stupid. So, so stupid. Of course they are here, of course they are okay.
“Should you really be in there? I have a feeling he’ll kick you out in the middle of the flight.”
Also he has no clue what to make of that guy. Not at all, despite their hour-long car ride here. Travelling into a foreign country, or even state, with him possibly isn’t his brightest idea, he briefly considers, while they cross the mowed down field towards a tiny plane.
Nate turns around the corner and enters a secluded area of the facility.
He should contact them. Make sure they are alright and not bleeding to death somewhere far off from any help.
“Hey Nate, you still here? I’ve got a question, do you have a second?”
“I think he has been ever since they got back to the compound. So… we argued, things escalated and… now we’re here.”
“Nothing,” he blurts out in a too high voice that obviously gives him away and would leave aunt Nat cringing, so he quickly adds as Happy silently lifts one eyebrow, “I forgot to clean my room. Again. But I really want to get to dad and pops, so can we just-“
swirls around in his head.
and still ended up crushing out this one dead-tired, since the last week ended me work-wise. x_x
The reflection in the mirror is a sight to behold, but the usual banter is stuck in his throat.
“We fought.”
He is still there. It’s tough, more so than ever, but he is still his father below the rough attitude and that’s everything Peter needs to keep on hoping.
But with every step they take, Nate grows slower and slower, until they stop.
He can’t do this.
“A short flight with your machine for the two of us.”
“No, calm down. But think about it – we have no clue whether it’s for Stark’s… personal information or for the government and Ross to take them out once and for all. And in my low-minded opinion that’s a scenario none of them are able to afford at the moment.”
“Sick?” Pepper exclaimed. “Not just asthma? Why aren’t we going to the ER?”
Apple pie was a classic; a favorite for most. He figured his Ma’s recipe would be a safe bet as well. Something like this needed a personal touch, especially when it could go a little wrong. He wasn’t a great chef or baker by any stretch of the imagination, but he could follow directions. That apparently was the whole trick to not burning down the kitchen every day.
He froze.
“Well, gosh, sir,” Steve said, pouring on the charm and sarcasm all at the same time. “I’m sorry about that. I know Sam here wouldn’t have made a poor quality flat white. It’s his favorite drink! And I know Natasha wouldn’t have roasted our beans incorrectly, that would just mess up everyone’s orders! And I know I wouldn’t train anyone improperly to work in my shop, that’s just bad business. How about we throw in a free muffin and call it even?”
Bruce shrugged. “Don’t know. That’s a secret too.”
“JARVIS, pull up those schematics again. The ones for the thruster boots.”
“Yup,” Steve said, a bowl of popcorn in his lap, feeling warm and content.
Peter promptly burst into tears and threw himself into Tony’s arms. He had to be dragged away because the social worker was insistent about following the judge’s orders.
“So, you do have a crush,” Pepper suddenly said.
Huh, there it was again. Catching up.
“Steve, please tell me we have a copy of—”
And who the hell would sponsor HYDRA?
“I know, Pep, but I swear, I went to bed last night and woke up like this. Unless I was sleepwalking, I didn’t do anything.”
“I don’t know—this is financial stuff.”
Tony licked his lips and it was downright
Or maybe need a few drinks.
“It’s a date.”
“One day, man, people are gonna see you’re no shining, golden boy. Just you wait.”
Cold sweat started to pour down his back.
“Do what?” Steve asked, coming out with a load of cookies and muffins.
Because, really?
“Sure.”
As he brought the cup up for a sip, he noticed something on the sleeve: a little doodle of a sun and some clouds in permanent marker. The sun had a smiley face on it.
The coffee shop smelled as fantastic as always. The sunlight entered it weakly, casting deep shadows all over the place. Tony was sure that it still felt cheery and warm to the other patrons, but … he paused in the front door for a moment, just taking it all in, wondering what was going to happen next. Some futurist he was, constantly wondering about the future when it should have been horribly obvious. But he couldn’t predict a single thing.
No. Never. It wasn’t him.
The social worker gave Tony another sneering look and then went to a chair on the other side of the room to give them a semblance of privacy.
He took in a slow, deep breath, like he was waking up, and then gave a fake startle.
When was the other shoe going to drop?
“Continue to the roof?” Tony asked.
“Is this my life right now?” Tony growled.
“So?!”
“She would.”
Steve nodded and placed the cloth on the bruise that was beginning to throb.
All he knew was that he
Scientist to scientist.
Yeah, that was a headline he could get behind. Pepper Potts finally having the resources and power to do whatever she wanted.
Peter looked one part smug and two parts grossed out.
Steve sputtered and coughed as everyone around him roared in laughter.
“They’re my air vents,” Tony quipped, skittering down the air vents some more. He always wondered why Clint liked to go through them, popping out whenever it was most inconvenient for everyone else. Sure, someone might say it was for security purposes and because it was a convenient way for a stealthy spy to go around unnoticed. That was a valid response. But Tony knew deep in his heart that Clint secretly hummed the
“No, my history teacher!” Peter corrected.
“The hardest part is over,” Tony said softly as Peter took a seat in a desk next to him. It was a little awkward, seeing so many adults sitting in desks meant for kids, but a smaller ‘stage’ made more of the kids comfortable and was easier to manage too. “You did great.”
“It’s not like anyone would go through with it,” he mumbled.
His voice sounded like a frog’s croak.
But … but a part of him was tired of wishful dreaming.
“Then get me to a chapel already.”
As he continued to cough up more daisies and violets (who knew the flowers could repeat themselves?) Tony thought.
The omegas didn’t prove anything by taking on alpha-like behaviors. They proved it by going to school and earning degrees, paying bills on time, volunteering to clean up a public park, taking second jobs to support their families, by being good partners through thick and thin, by being good friends and neighbors and helping those in need.
Tony quirked an eyebrow at him. “Are you accusing me of being a liar?”
“Sure your calling is inventing?” he asked. “And not cosmetology?”
Finally, this nightmare was over.
Sure, some people got their happy endings, but in general, this whole ‘hack up flowers because someone thinks so poorly of themselves you have to suffer with them’ was messed up.
Steve snorted, amused, and went to make the drink. Tony paid and went to his usual table, pulling out his tablet. He had schematics to work on and this was perfect. Absolutely perfect. No one else was in, the streets were quiet, and Steve must have been the one who changed the music to smooth jazz instead of the usual top hits or whatever kids listened to these days. Sure, he preferred to blast out AC/DC, but this was good too. Something different.
“So,” Tony drawled after some relaxing silence. “We gotta think of a game plan here, sweetheart. You can’t hole yourself up in your room once a month for the rest of your life. I’m thinking we get you a decent doctor, do some tests, rule out any other underlying problems, and confirm if you’re an alpha or omega.”
“Two percent,” Steve shot back. “Two percent, Tony.”
“He didn’t say he wouldn’t be!”
The arc reactor glowed blue, as always, making creepy shadows around his room.
So when he started coughing and sneezing more than usual, he didn’t think much about it. It was spring and everything was blooming. It was an unavoidable risk with the changing of the seasons. He wondered, briefly, if it might be that annoying Hanahaki Disease some people got, but dismissed it. Even though there were many, many romance novels about how people would find that special someone thanks to the non-consensual petals being sneezed up like they were at a wedding (another trope romance novels loved), it was also common knowledge that Hanahaki Disease could and often did express all kinds of love.
Across that gaping abyss, he saw Captain America and the sniper look at him almost helplessly. They were covered in dust too, shrapnel causing them to bleed where it tore through their uniforms. He knew that he was likely bleeding too, but he was clearly too shocked to register any pain. He hoped there wasn’t anything life threatening at the moment.
He climbed up a long pathway that was barely obstructed by any rocks or lower ceilings. He wished that he could study the rocks, explore more of the caves … but that kind of dangerous thinking was what got him into such trouble in the first place. It became steeper, but the light guided him. It was steady, never dimming or brightening.
“Huh,” was all Bruce said before he went to make some tea for himself.
Antonius’ lungs ached and his chest heaved by the time sunlight in the tunnel began to increase. He could hear wind coming down and it soon became hard enough that it blew his hair about.
Tony stroked his hair, sighing as well.
Now, Tony knew that it was Steve’s job to be there for his students. He knew that meant he had to help and juggle more than a hundred unique kids. He knew that keeping an eye out for learning disabilities and offering help was part of what a teacher did. They were trained for it, apparently, though they were not quite paraprofessionals or psychologists. All of Peter’s teachers were helping, but damn, Steve Rogers was the one who took the cake.
Pepper was in front of him, her eyes filled with worry.
“No, but it’s a
Steve shrugged and spat a few more of the tiny flowers out into their bathroom sink. “I think they’re Natasha’s favorite. Maybe Bruce? I don’t keep track of this stuff.”
Tony wasn’t sure which of the options he preferred.
“Oh, fresh blood,” Natasha purred when they got up to the counter. “Who is this, Tony?”
Steve looked up. Tony’s expression was hard to describe. He was staring at him with such
“We drew lots and Natasha won,” Sam said. “Suck it up.”
A moment passed.
“What?”
“I like working,” Steve said, a flush growing on his cheeks. “I like making myself useful. I’m currently setting up a scholarship for other art students with my back pay. There’s … a lot. I could make ten scholarships and still have funds to pull the shop out of the red if needed.”
. I got the company, I got my projects, I got
“We’ll be okay,” Tony swore. “It’ll be okay. We’ll figure this out. But for now, we’re going to try to weasel some extra cookies out of Aunt May. Sounds good?”
It was later in the day and to be honest? Being a squirrel sucked and was boring. There were only so many air ducts he could explore now that Clint wasn’t going to shoot him again, keyboards were nearly impossible to handle because of his limited arm span, and he had little luck inventing anything to help him with those handicaps because his screwdrivers were nearly as tall as he was. Forget about soldering or welding anything either!
He kept running until he could no longer see the firelight of their torches.
It was soft and blue, unlike anything he had ever seen. Not even the sky or the ocean could compare. It shone on his hands and down his body, but he could not tell where the source was from. Not immediately. And when he suspected, he shook such a thought away.
“These are the weirdest rut symptoms I have ever seen,” Steve said. “Are you
Tony tapped his stylus on his tablet. “What about Iron Man?”
“Dad, is it possible that you have ADHD too?”
“I dunno, Tones, why does anyone ever feel inadequate about something?”
over.
“Hey there, buttercup,” Tony said gently. “Wanna come out? Or do you want me to come in?”
he could put into words. “Thank you.”
Tony knew then that whatever happened, Mr. Rogers was in the thick of it, or at least a witness.
No one really liked to talk about what happened if someone never figured it out.
Tony gave him an incredulous look.
“Nothing,” Clint hissed. “Nothing happened in that hell hole.”
“Mr. Thompson!”
That was when Steve noticed Pepper was wearing a new necklace: along the chain were small petals surrounded in clear resin. He immediately recognized the ranunculus and marigold petals belonging to Tony and Rhodey. It was a common thing to have, jewelry or trinkets with flower petals from loved ones. Bucky had a few charms from his sisters. He had a ring that his father had given his mother where their petals (black popular and bluebells) were inlaid in resin.
As everyone started talking about all the flowers they had been coughing and sneezing up, Steve smiled to himself. He was sure everyone would figure it out, but more or less, everyone had been thinking about everyone. Sure, their lives were really different. Sure, their schedules didn’t always match up. And of course they weren’t perfect by any means.
Steve was aghast. “We weren’t that bad, were we? I didn’t know about Tony’s feelings until today!”
After years of Captain America being used to emotionally beat him up? After years of thinking his childhood hero would hate him if they ever met? After years of being taught that there would be nothing but disapproval and rejection?
The courts were suspicious, the social workers gave him the stink eye, and the people Peter had been assigned to just … They gave him the creeps. He felt like he needed to kidnap Peter and never let anyone come near him again, but that would be illegal and not help
“I’ve been turned into an animal,” he muttered. Going to the left side of his bed, it didn’t take him long to land on the floor and look at what used to be human hands. He quickly figured out that unlike some of the stories out there, like in
Sure, it took some time to adjust to being shorter than everyone else and having to walk with four legs, plus he could not control his tail one hundred percent of the time, but it wasn’t the worst thing in the world. He still felt like himself, so perhaps any change in perception was because of the changes of his physical form.
“I know. I love you, too.”
“Thank you,” the young woman said, leaving a tip in the jar.
He was going to say ‘understand’, but then Tony whipped out a piece of paper from his bag and slapped it down on the table in between them.
Tony sighed and there was some shuffling, but apparently, he wasn’t focusing on melting two pieces of metal or something together.
As JARVIS displayed the details in front of him, he left the room. He … he had to pace. He had to do something with his hands. He had to find some way to make the world stop spinning or go back in time and stop just … just everything wrong and bad in the world from ever happening, from ever preventing human suffering—
“There’s nothing wrong with having a disability or being different,” Mr. Rogers said, coming over and kneeling on the other side of the desk Peter was sitting in. He was so tall that it only put him at eye level. “Do you remember how I told the class I was colorblind?”
“Make it a double shot. And a regular sized latte too?”
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “Twenty-six minutes is a lot of time to fill in those blanks, but the romance seemed really weird. Almost forced.”
Her smirk didn’t fade as she rang it up. “Name?”
She smiled, just a quirk of the corner of her mouth. “Then it looks like I single-handedly keep this place afloat.”
“Hey, punk!” Bucky called over his shoulder when he came up to the counter. “Get your ass out here!”
“How are you feeling?”
Steve had to look up the next one—it turned out to be a Siberian fawn lily.
Mr. Rogers was quiet for a moment. “He’s lucky to have you. I’ve had parents outright dismiss my concerns and seen the students suffer for it.”
“I’ll … wait … over … here …” he stammered out, pointing to a corner by the counter as he went, trying not to stumble over his feet.
The future was scary, the past was scary, and the present was downright horrifying.
“It’s like … being nearsighted,” May had said. “If you see someone wearing glasses, you don’t think there is something ‘wrong’ with them, do you?”
“Go get something to eat and some fresh air. It’s been over twenty-four hours again. You agreed that you would reduce these binges.”
“Where am I? Who turned off the lights?”
“I know.” Steve sounded horrible, his voice strained. “I felt like I was coming down with a cold, but I was going to come anyways, but then I started feeling even worse by lunch.”
“No, no. This is not okay. We’re taking you to a doctor. When did this start?”
“What—?”
“Hey, hey,” Steve said, worried at the panicked tone Tony’s voice took on towards the end. “It’s okay. I needed that information. Now I can help you through this better.”
“I hope you mean that rhetorically.”
was the one trying to deny it: he was falling in love with Steve. He’d crossed that line a long time ago, like everyone else—Pepper, Bruce, Sam, Bucky, Rhodey,
He never mentioned the … whatever was on his chest after the first night.
Since waking up, he had no idea where his life would take him next.
Something snagged in his throat and he coughed.
“AI,” Tony corrected.
“It’s …”
, making him just slightly taller than Antonius. With him was another child, much younger. She couldn’t have been older than seven years.
Tony was running a bit late for their usual coffee meetup thanks to some late night inventing binges, but Steve was outside the coffee shop hacking up a lung.
Steve scowled, a blush rising. “So what?”
“This is … this is amazing, Tony. Thank you.”
Oh, crap.
of all times? He knew Stane had to be stopped! He knew he had to do it himself, because if he went to the cops, he would weasel out of it unless there was damning evidence, and except for the file of the kidnapping, he had none! Tony could see him squirming out of that as well, saying he had no idea what the terrorists were saying and that they had to be mistaken, or that he’d only gone along with it in a failed attempt to get Tony back …
He was
Steve looked down at the napkin just to be sure. On it was a strange flower he had never seen before.
He didn’t like that.
“Man, I’m gonna have to charge you extra for that.”
Buk and Shem’el were a short distance away, close to the dirt road that led to the fishing areas. There were some other figures, arguing with them. A group of travelers it seemed, maybe about ten or so people. They appeared to be of different ages and appearances. Was there a conflict in one of those larger, organized settlements further to the north? He could have sworn the king and queen of the northern kingdoms had figured out their cattle herd issue months ago.
The day that happened, the world would be dimmer. It would be without an amazing, wonderful, infuriating ball of righteousness. It would be missing out on a wonderful artist, a passionate friend, an idiot who liked to sing along to musicals off-key on purpose.
That sounded like a happy ending to him.
“But I look more like an alpha than—”
He sighed deeply. “Do I have enough time to get some fresh air?”
He really was cursing himself. If not for this happening, how long would they assume Steve was an omega? No wonder over the counter suppressants never seemed to help him. The moment Steve was back to being himself, he was going to insist he go to a doctor and get the works: allergy tests, heart examinations, blood tests, all of it. He couldn’t stand back and ignore the issue any further. Not when they could easily have prevented all this.
“I never asked you to!”
The first thing he did was create a new Twitter handle.
The man chuckled sinisterly. “Well, guess what we just did?”
“We need to talk,” Tony said, keeping his voice down.
She shook her head, giving him a soft look. “It’s okay. I know you’re not okay, though. What can I do to help?”
“What is with that face?” Tony asked.
Tony spun around and came face-to-face with someone straight out of a dystopian novel.
. He had gotten his emails sorted out and paperwork signed ahead of time, delegated a number of projects to people who would enjoy them and do a good job, and shuffled some meetings around so he would have the afternoon free. He had done all that and was going to go to the florist to find a nice bouquet, because when you confessed your love to someone, having flowers or chocolate was always a nice touch.
“Actual fresh air, not caffeine,” Pepper corrected. “I know you too well to even entertain the idea that you’re going to actually power walk or do some yoga.”
The time he spent with Tony, day and night, were some of his fondest memories.
“Of course, come here,” Tony said, climbing onto the bed and pulling Steve to him, blanket and all. Steve snuggled into him, letting out a deep sigh.
Howard was probably rolling in his grave now.
But then he saw one of Steve’s tissues as he went to empty the trashcan.
Tony blinked. “Yeah. I’d been trying to flirt with you for months. I thought I was off my game.”
Wasn’t that a song, by somebody? Somewhere?
“Here you go.”
It was not the acclimation SHIELD might have wanted, but watching him chat with random people, play darts, and enjoy a beer was … nice.
His nose tickled and—
“I can make up a list,” she offered, even though the list would likely be short.
out of this when he got home. Maybe he could even do it in the car.
Tony was frothing at the mouth.
He kept running until he could not see any light at all and his body gave out.
“Tony—”
“Steve, are you well?”
Tony stared as everyone stared down at him.
She sighed and crossed her arms. Walking across the room, she pulled the screwdrivers out of his mouth and hand.
“Is that a lip wibble? Where did you learn that?”
Turns out the flowers had spines.
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper sighed.
Steve looked up from his book to see Tony stepping inside his apartment with a bag on his shoulder. “Hey. You got here quick.”
“Antonius,” Stiofán repeated, with a brilliant smile. Then, he said something Antonius did not understand, but it was said with such warmth, he knew it was a welcome.
“I don’t say it often enough. Thank you … for everything.”
“Whoa, don’t worry about it,” Bucky said as he put the cut up fruit into containers. “Your phone rang, so we answered it. It’s fine.”
“Does it have to do with autumn or pumpkins?”
Adrenaline pumped through his veins. It was so
Tony raised an eyebrow at him. “Like I ever do anything else?”
After that, Tony was not sure how they got the 72nd floor without any more incidents. A place like this should have been crawling with agents. There should have been a bomb ready to detonate or at least use as a threat against them. A secret organization bent on taking over the world doesn’t just kidnap one of the world’s most predominate figures just to lose him to their most famous and hated enemies. Someone did not drop the ball.
“Ireland. My parents moved here before I was born.”
Steve smiled at him appreciatively. “I keep telling them that. I’ve got a lot to catch up on, but this is a good start. I’m supposed to be getting some
Turns out, when Steve wasn’t having a bad day, he was half fire, half thunderstorm. Painting, cleaning, protesting for social reform, getting into brawls over those social reforms, he did nothing in half measures. That also included loving him. Oh, they clashed at times, and there was that infamous run-in with his father, but he would much rather have Steve with all of his flaws than some sort of tepid, domestic bliss. Something like
Tony looked at him out of the corner of his eye, not sure where this was going to go.
A few steps later, he realized that he was crashing. Body calling it a quits.
,” Steve said, giving Tony a look before he could attempt to derail the conversation again. “If I really am an alpha, it’s going to affect our lives in ways we can’t imagine. The paperwork alone!”
“Do you think he’s making things worse?”
In retrospect, it also sounded like a jab, but it did remind him how young he was.
“With the works,” Tony grinned, holding up two delicious smelling bags. His own stomach was growling with the need for grease and salt. He had run all the way from the burger joint to the library, wanting to maximize the time he had with Steve. Maybe hour lunches were good for something after all.
Later that day, after a few hours of horribly boring board meetings, Tony finally got a moment to himself. He wasted no time grabbing a fork from a random break room and heading back to his lab where the apple cake was waiting for him. There was still some odd behaviors in his head of departments and some variables that stuck out in some reports, but he could pick those apart later. Maybe he could do that instead of fighting off nightmares tonight.
Tony hoped that when this was over and Steve was in his right mind again, they could talk and smooth over any lingering hurt feelings. Tony knew Steve would be mortified about his behavior if he wasn’t already. Maybe that was why he was still holing himself up in his room.
Peter was quiet, biting his lip.
“We got a count of 200,” Steve replied. “They came from a central location—not sure if they’re a hive mind like last time.”
“You …?”
“Pep, you are never going to believe this.”
Steve laughed and hugged him back, glad to have fingers and two legs again.
Ned’s voice snapped Peter out of his mental spiral.
“Oh, yes, as if taking care of yourself is such a punishment.” Pepper kissed his forehead and headed out of the office. “Enjoy your lunch.”
“It can be,” Mr. Rogers said, turning back to Tony. “There are other factors involved, but about eleven percent of students have ADHD in some form or another. Peter isn’t alone in this. But before we get ahead of ourselves, how about we set up a meeting with our paraprofessional and rule out anything else? ADHD is a possibility, but that doesn’t mean it is what’s going on.”
And in fearing Natasha, because she got tired of their pouting really quickly.
“So you’re the one who keeps the plants alive,” Tony said, when he saw Natasha move along the various pothos ivies that grew in pots arranged on the windowsills, watering can in her hand.
“What?”
(No, seriously. He was randomly asked to be a part of a tester sample group and he was not the most vocal about his disdain for that drink, among others. He was sure that little old lady made some of the employees weep. She was adamant about expressing her fury towards them for, quote, ‘Ruining one of the most underrated, underappreciated vegetables that should just stay in pies and other forms of baking, not liquid atrocities.’)
She looked delighted. “Hydrangea petals! That’s my girlfriend’s favorite flower, but she likes them pink.”
“Clint, please stop bothering Steve.”
Oh, no, his palms were
Thor nodded. “Yes, engaged in fact.”
As they walked, his stomach started tying itself in knots. Surrounded by tasteful paintings, the latest wallpapers, and other interior designs of the day, Steve felt horribly out of place. Everything seemed to have some sort of Greek or Roman inspiration: marble busts, mosaic tiles, dark woods and brass fixtures, and many floral motifs. Everything was elegant and expensive. If not for the light colors of the walls and tiled floors, the house would feel claustrophobic, as there were no windows the further they went in.
“Yeah,” Bucky said softly. “It’s great. It doesn’t hurt like other designs did.”
“It’ll be okay,” Tony said, looking over his shoulder at Peter, who was clearly worrying himself into an early grave. He reached over and took his hand, stopping Peter from picking his nails. “We’ll go in there, see what your teacher has to say, and sue the school if we have to.”
Sam waited patiently while he fished for his words.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Tony interrupted, rolling his eyes. “Chinese water torture, I know the drill.”
Steve felt like the floor had been pulled out from under him.
That brought out a laugh from him, more of a giggle really, but Tony was glad to hear it. He couldn’t help but lean in and plant big, loud, and silly smacks along his cheeks, which resulted in more laughs.
“That this child, Peter Parker, is your biological son.”
“But he never did it in this class before, now did he?” MJ asked. She had a pleased look on her face and Peter knew she was going to draw everyone’s shocked expressions later.
Bucky started laughing. “You haven’t noticed? And they call you a genius. They’re
Agent Coulson said they were trying to root HYDRA out.
It would be less of a risk if someone got it physically.
“You … really think so?” Steve asked.
And so, that was how he spent his entire morning in a back corner, watching Steve, Sam, and Bucky work, occasionally joining in on their constant teasing of each other and trying to guess their specials in vain. By the time the sun started to rise and bring in other customers, Tony had two cups of coffee and an ‘orange blossom muffin’. Sam claimed it was healthier than other muffins because it had actual orange slices and cranberries, but Tony tasted the butter in it.
But it could be done.
Yeah. The drug was still messing with his head if he was thinking his life was currently playing out a Saturday morning cartoon episode. Pity they hadn’t used ropes to tie him; the zip ties meant that they were a little more forward thinking than a typical mad scientist.
Then he gasped with alarm.
“Are you sure about this?” she asked.
“You could have just called. I have a line dedicated for people wanting to extort money from me.”
Tony narrowed his eyes.
“Well, that’s swell,” Captain America said, rolling his eyes.
“I’m your all or nothing?”
Tony held his breath. A moment passed.
“His ruts might have been suppressed due to being around other omegas,” Sam continued. “It’s been proven prolonged exposure results in less frequent and intense ruts. Suppressant medication can do the same thing, depending upon the individual biology. Any heats he might have had probably
Steve shoved a fry into his mouth, smirking at how it got him to stop protesting.
But why would he? He had money and lawyers and fame, and with those three things, people were willing to forgive and forget a lot.
He would worry about that later.
“Ready?”
Tony nodded. “I know a bit about bullies. Maybe I’ll sic my lawyers on them.”
“I know, right? It makes no sense!”
“What?” he asked, brushing soot off his fur. “It’s not that bad.”
Stiofán once told him of some mines in another land across the sea, of a soft metal needed in the famous forges further into the mainland that were valuable for trade. The clan had some examples of it, along with other beautifully carved and decorated stone items, but they traded mostly for durable supplies than objects to merely be gazed at.
Hours later, the sun barely coming up, Steve collapsed onto a thin sleeping pallet. Tony automatically reached out, letting Steve rest on top of him. He was exhausted from fighting and haggling with about a dozen people for peace and war reparations and being in a tower for months on end. He was still furious beyond all belief and horribly saddened at the state of his kingdom. Reports and second-hand accounts were nothing like seeing it for himself, but that was Schmidt: greed and corruption and hatred and injustice all rolled into one.
Tony felt himself flush. “Uh. Thanks. He’s fidgeting a lot less and is keeping track of his things better. We’re still doing the phone reminders and the planner has helped too. He writes things down and checks them off as he goes. Sometimes he forgets to check it, but we’re working on making that part of his routine in the mornings.”
was!” Tony gasped. “I’m still trying to figure it out!”
The walk there, though fairly quick, took a little too long. It was like they hit every single crosswalk.
answer some questions, like how stubborn you can be.”
“Eh, I still could have—”
If he wanted to visit the man he had a crush on while he was on lunch break, he could do that with barely a five-minute walk.
“Uh, you’re welcome. I’ll try not to get kidnapped again.”
(Okay, so that is a lie. Compared to twin sized beds. Oh, fine, king sized beds.)
Tony shook his head. “Nope, we gotta be fair here if we want this relationship to work. Pepper has yelled at me enough for me to know communication should be a priority.”
have a crush on Mr. Rogers!”
Steve clasped his hand. “Thank you, General Fury. I don’t know how I can repay you all.”
“I was not!”
He could imagine Tony pouting right then.
Tony sighed. “Alright, alright. I concede. But let me know if I can send a lawyer your way, pro bono or something.”
“That’s alright.” Mr. Rogers’ voice was gentle. “I know you try. You are one of the most determined, persistent students I have ever had. You do your best and I appreciate that.”
Steve raised his hand and used the large brass knocker.
“If you can guess correctly, I’ll give it to you for free,” Natasha said as she made some other orders.
was that a look of disappointment. Those eyebrows. “I don’t like that. Not to mention it’s really late. Have you been working all night?”
And I have never been to the Bank of America Plaza in Dallas, but we have driven past that thing a few times, and man does it reflect the sun’s light like no one’s business. Ouch.
to come out and get some fresh air.
“Hey, hey,” Tony said, getting up and kneeling beside him. “It’s okay, Peter. There’s nothing wrong with you. You haven’t done anything wrong.”
The opened doors and windows in the back of the room helped.
Pepper glanced over at the cake sitting on a stand, obviously fresh from the oven. “It looks like apple cake if you ask me.”
And more plotting ways to get them back.
“Tony?”
“You are evil,” he muttered to the phone, still in multiple pieces.
“Yeah,” Peter whispered back.
“Don’t even think about it,” Captain America said. “None of that is stable enough to support you.”
Someone was going to slip up.
“Nah, just about everyone.”
The wallpaper was peeling a little in some places, but the kitchen he discovered was positively cheerful and lively.
After that, it was a matter of applying various coats and letting them dry, which they made more bearable by watching something random on Netflix and cuddling. This time, they were binge watching Chinese dramas. The mythology was interesting, as was their use of special effects. Under the blankets, tucked up against Tony’s side, everything was warm, soft, and safe.
Steve frowned. “Those aren’t Bucky’s dishes in the sink.”
Tony might have known the words, and said them correctly, but his accent was horrible.
Steve looked at him like he hadn’t a clue. “It’s not that cold.”
He took in a deep breath before answering.
Such as that pipe wrench. It totally would be missed. It belonged to my great-grandfather. I would hunt someone down for that wrench. Even if it helped save the world.
Someone coughing up rose petals on Valentine’s Day could just as easily sneeze daisy petals on their birthday or some other special occasion. He already knew that he was loved by his friends. There was no mystery there, no need to start asking what everyone’s favorite flower was.
“No kidding?” Clint asked.
. Not like you and me, platypus, but still, friends. Two, he wouldn’t do this to me. He has seen how much this sucks for others. He would rather jump on a grenade than put even a stranger through this flowery hell.”
Everything in the hallway was in chaos, people rushing from the lower floors. The alarms were blaring and the white lights above those alarms were bound to give someone a seizure. Why someone approved such blinding lights when—no, no Tony, focus.
However, the real season of spring? The thing people had to deal with in real life?
"He didnt come in at 830 today, he always comes in at 830 every day! What happen???!?"
Lunch dissolved into discussions about various plot points, fandom wars, and quickly stuffing their mouths and rushing off to class before they were late. But despite that, bringing up the possibility that his father had ADHD too nagged at the back of his mind for the rest of the day.
“The babe with the power.”
Tony leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. One leg was jumping up and down nervously. Steve looked impossibly stiff. Who knew that there was a form of standing at attention when one was sitting?
“Hey! No, that’s not fair! She said it was chocolate chip this time!”
be asleep. Natasha wordlessly gave him a cup of something. He took a sip before he realized it was green tea.
How did they even—
Damnit.
“Hey, Sam!” he called back as he got in line.
As he left, he looked down at the coffee sleeve.
He was the keeper of the tools?
Steve growled and whipped a pen out of nowhere.
“Wait until summer hits.”
Tony cocked his head to the side. “Huh. I didn’t know that was a thing.”
“Can you ask me again?” he asked, finally managing English.
“No,” Tony answered. “That would take too long, but I figured you guys would want intel on their mad, evil schemes. So I have it on a secure server.”
Tony frowned and began to pace in front of them.
Down the hallway was another HYDRA goon, the one who had shoved him into the computer terminal in the first place. Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He had no idea who this was or what he was capable of. He didn’t want to find out.
“Told you.”
Still, he followed them closely, carefully, not willing to put anything more to chance than he had to.
Tony spat out another mouthful of coffee.
Steve let out a long sigh and leaned backwards, craning his neck to the sky. “How’d you peg me?”
to be nice to me.”
And he really, really wanted to be the kind of person Tony would want to date. It was too much to hope Tony would want to court him or do anything beyond courting, but he could dream.
more than a stern talking to or detention ever will.”
“Are you alright?” T’Challa asked. “Is it your asthma again?”
“Yeah. I think that’ll be good.”
They came to a row of windows, giving them what normally would have been a lovely view of the city around them. The blueprints he looked up before he made his escape only told him so much, but that view confirmed his suspicions.
He walked up to him and extended his hand. “Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Emphasis on philanthropist.”
He was brought out of his thoughts when Tony kissed his knuckles after patting them dry with a towel.
“Internet.”
Steve felt panic rise in his chest.
Steve groaned, resting his forehead on Tony’s shoulder again. “I’m an idiot. I had no clue. I’ve been head over heels for you for months. I thought I was so bad at dating—I thought courting couldn’t be any worse—and if I was going to court, it was all or nothing.”
Next time, he was ordering two dozen. No, three dozen, because Pepper deserved some too.
Rhodey rolled his eyes and laughed, muttering something about ‘idiots’, but promised he knew what to do with the petals.
Steve felt his cheeks redden. “Um.”
He had Tony and that was all that mattered.
“I mean it,” she insisted. “Do you know how many people would just go for it, without regarding any of the consequences? I don’t know how many HR incidents I have had to work through because someone didn’t take a moment to think. But, for all the people to develop a crush on, you could do a lot worse than a very dedicated, understanding teacher.”
“Are you … do you …?”
He could smell the stress and worry.
“So it can be fixed? You can undo this?” Steve asked, padding over. He hoped the girls would stop arguing.
“So, what is
“Stop the theatrics,” someone new said, tearing the bag off his head. “I know you have been awake for some time. You have something we want.”
“But why are you a squirrel?”
Agent Coulson wrote something down, shuffled his papers, and stood. “Well, it seems to me that this was a standard mission, minus the deviation in the extraction plan. Thank you for your time, Mr. Stark, we will be in contact with you again.”
Tony kissed him again. “See? That’s another reason to love you. You’re thinking of me as a person, not just an alpha.”
Peter nodded. “Okay. Water will help.”
After considering it for a moment, he sent a tweet to Rhodey: DID YOU KNOW CAP IS ALIVE?
“Deal.”
“Relax, this is my partner,” Captain America assured, placing a hand on the creepy assassin’s shoulder.
“Clint!”
Steve balked. “I’d ask him out first! But I’m not gonna do that either!”
Slowly, over time, Antonius realized that all of them had been touched by the gods. They all confessed none of them knew why. It was to be expected, though.
Sometimes he had to take extra-long business trips around the world. Sometimes he had to work long hours on weekends and holidays. Some nights he felt that weight pressing down on his chest; some nights he felt glad he could actually do something.
“Yes. It’s usually caught before now, but if I recall correctly, Peter was in foster care for a few years before you adopted him?”
Okay, that might be Tony projecting a little, but it still stood! Teachers did that!
Tony scoffed and swallowed. “Oh, do you now?”
Then Tony let out a moan and squeezed his eyes tightly. Steve snatched his hand back.
Steve nodded. “No hot flashes yet.”
Tony found himself shaking his head. “No, no. This is … this is great. I could use a little more ‘old fashioned’ in my life.”
It was just a crush. Either it would go away, he would be rejected, or there might be a chance that something more could come of it.
However, he agreed that this current emotion and its circumstances were a problem.
“You gave Mr. Rogers your phone number.”
“Indeed, sir only has slight scorch marks on four percent of his body,” JARVIS supplied. “I predict that his fur will recover in a few weeks.”
Tony made an over-dramatic noise that made him sound like he was dying.
He wanted the suit to be more than functional. He wanted paperwork to do itself. He wanted Rhodey to not have to go on such long tours all the time or for Pepper to deal with such long meetings. He wanted to be prepared for when he took the armor out. He needed the suit to be absolutely perfect, none of this flying into a heap of sand and waiting for some miracle (Rhodey) to come pick him up. Besides, Tony was sure that he was out of miracles and—
Tony was very, very proud that he asked her about which of Sam’s muffins were the best, instead of focusing on why Steve was worrying about him and how often he voiced his concerns that Natasha started to get annoyed by it.
“I am afraid that Thor is off world and not available to be reached at the moment,” JARVIS said before Tony could ask. “He informed me of this two days ago. He should be back by the end of the week.”
“Alright. We will talk to you soon. Let us know if anything changes.”
“Tea? Coffee?” Tony asked. “I’ve been a horrible host.”
Time crawled slowly, comfortably, after that.
“You’re stuck with Barnes?”
Tony felt dread swell in his chest and start to close in on his throat, but he forced it down so he could call Bucky.
“Oh, no, they’re demons alright,” Steve laughed.
“We’re almost done!” Peter said proudly. “JARVIS really helped with adjusting the range of movements Mr. Stark has now, not to mention the different proportions.”
“What just happened?” Ned whispered, his voice like an echo.
Who was starting to
He found himself longing for the intense sun, the dry dirt, and the forge he once had. He felt so out of place in a land without the obsidian he was used to finding along the ocean’s edge or knowing when the seasons would end or begin. Of course he could track the moon and the sun, but the skies were different—the stars were not in the same places as before.
“It’s the same for you. You’re still a brilliant student. You just need some extra help, like someone who needs to be tutored in math. It’ll be a bit of trial and error, but your father helping you with organization and time management is
Taking in a deep breath, he shoved the doors open.
Once it was confirmed that May and Ben would love to have them over, Tony put his phone away and gave Peter a tight hug. Peter buried his face in Tony’s chest, trying to hold back a sob. Tony hated that this wasn’t a problem he couldn’t solve with some grease or a screwdriver. He hated that this might be a long-term issue for Peter, but at least they had someone inside the school working to help them.
Steve made a move to continue on, but Tony grabbed his arm, stalling him, even though they needed to pick up the pace. It would not be long before their escape was discovered and they would recognize the main battle as the distraction it was. “It’s not your fault.”
Exiting the car, Tony kept a hand on Peter’s shoulder, glad that he hadn’t hit a growth spurt yet. Some of Peter’s peers were
“Steve’s place!” he shouted, catching up and passing Pepper.
“It’s like …” He trailed off. His brain was going somewhere, but wasn’t telling him the final destination yet. “It’s like—”
Whenever he mentioned that he hated the season, everyone always gasped, because weren’t artists supposed to love spring? The flowers and dew sparkling in the sunlight? The trees beginning to bud with fresh leaves after the long, harsh winter? All the colors?
Both of them ignored Sam muttering how Steve was going to be love-struck for the whole day.
There were more people in regular, civilian clothes, looking panicked and alarmed, but he had no way to know who was HYDRA or not. He initially tried to hide among the crowd, but someone clapped their hand on his shoulder.
“Maybe,” the man said, still cocky and sure, “I suppose—”
Steve loved a lot of things about Tony—he was brilliant in so many ways. He could pull a new invention out of nothing, could become an expert in a new subject overnight, and unless he was trying to prove a point or someone was being a jerk, never flaunted his intelligence. He noticed details other people would ignore, tried his best to be a good friend, and even when he was rambling and going off a hundred tangents, was just absolutely endearing.
“Told you this place is great. Oh, what is that?” Tony asked.
Tony chuckled softly. “I caught a break in traffic.”
“Sure. We can do that.”
“Thank you!”
Steve caught his shield with practiced ease and used it to knock out another solider about to run Tony through with a spear. It felt good to have his favorite weapon in his hand once more, the weight of metal comforting when little else was. Bucky charged into the melee, slamming his fist into a different man’s jaw with a sick crack. Steve lost track of how many men they had to take down until Tony sent a long beam of magic towards him, using his shield to magnify and spread it around the hallway. Men attempted to dodge it, but it was a long practiced and favored move of theirs. Soon, there was nothing but groans, rubble, and dust.
“Is ADHD genetic?” Tony asked. It sounded like such a basic question. He was going to research the
Of course, my grandparents on both sides of the family grew up in this era, so my parents easily could have learned this slang and then they passed it onto me.
“Ready to head back?” Ned asked.
“But—” Tony started.
“That was Apple! Completely different.”
“Steve’s?” she repeated. “What’s wrong?”
That positively sucked. Oh god, Steve was looking at him like he grew three heads.
He pushed open the door and smiled. The coffee shop wasn’t immune to autumn either.
The sniper followed, both of them rolling their landings.
“W-What? Pep, I’m sorry. Sorry. I—”
Or so people said.
“And what if your alpha was happy to run with you to the judge’s office?”
Tony shrugged. “Discussion board?” he asked, wanting to find his feet again.
“Hey! He did what I did!”
. There was a little crackle in the air, barely audible. A vinyl record was playing somewhere.
Tony stood up, tucked the helmet under his arm and headed down to the workshop with a focus he’d thought he would never have again.
Being a golden retriever was … alright.
“I got your letter,” he said, hoping his voice betrayed no emotions.
Before he could think about it, Tony swung the pipe around.
“No clue,” Tony replied, leading Peter out as well. He had been given the rest of the day off, given what had happened. Peter looked like he could use a break. “It’d better be a wakeup call at least.”
Thor chuckled. “It has been my fortune to have been going through the same. Or should I say misfortune? My brother has been complaining of the house being stuffy.”
He still chuckled at the memories of the alphas who thought that just because he was an omega, he couldn’t throw a punch. But his amusement would die pretty quickly when he remembered the dreams they tore apart with their narrow views and high expectations. This last breakup had been pretty bad, with this latest guy doing some pretty awful—
been put online, which was why he hadn’t come across JARVIS’ radar before now. Apparently, his mother had died in a car accident, leaving Peter to be lost in the shuffle of foster care, because no one believed that he was the biological son of Tony Stark. There had been a number of people who claimed their children were his before, but a DNA test quickly proved their claims to be false. It happened every so often, but …
Tony stared, awkwardness starting to creep up his spine. Steve looked just about as mortified as well, as if he had no idea what was going on either. Silence stretched on. Thank god no one was in line at the moment, a rare lull, or he was likely to blurt out something stupid or spill his coffee or do something even more stupid that would get him banned and then he would never see Steve again or hear Sam and Bucky bicker or get half-threatened by Natasha—
Tony scowled. “No. If it was Steve, he would be like a bull in a china shop. He’d confess two seconds into a crush. Why would he think he wouldn’t be good enough anyways?”
“It’s called an arc reactor. It’s … it’s really advanced. Really powerful. I can’t let anyone know or use it, because god, this could be abused so easily, and so quickly.”
“I’m just being sure—but are you sick or is this a rut?” Steve asked, coming back. He maneuvered around the couch with a long extension cord and set the heating pad in Tony’s lap. He placed a bottle of medicine on the end table as well. Tony adjusted himself, looking miserable.
, Peter would never have wanted for anything. He would have done right by both of them, whatever that ended up being. Peter would have never been shuffled from family to family, getting uprooted every time those supposed
—a son he had never met before, a son he had never been given a chance to know. He was a mess, had been for years, even after he cleaned up his act and shut the weapons division of SI down and worked on becoming sober. Would he have done all those things to change his life and SI around sooner if he had known? Would he have been mature enough to handle it? How else would the world have changed if he had known?
“Hang on, Pep,” he called, stalled for a bit.
They finally saw a bright orange ‘72’ painted on the wall and appropriate door.
“Sir,” JARVIS said. “I have found some files that are pertinent to your investigation on Stane.”
Then Tony pulled Steve down and kissed him senseless. Steve couldn’t help but wrap his arms around Tony, pulling him into his lap. Tony reacted immediately, arching against him and running his hands through his hair. God, he was soft and warm and … and …
Even though she looked perfectly immaculate, there were bags under her eyes. Tony hoped that she wasn’t worrying about him again, or that he would pull off another stupid stunt.
“If you want to create this, we will help you. It is just that we have never seen such a thing, save for in stories that some of the traders tell us of. We thought it was a fantasy.”
“Are you alright?” a random patron asked, concerned.
“Patrol rough?” Tony asked casually.
, but he also knew she wouldn’t act upon that knowledge unless she felt he needed help or was getting into a bad situation. Now that he knew more of those red flags himself and had a few months of therapy to help him, he was sure that even if something did go south with Tony, he would come out alright.
“Tony—I’m—I’ve been trying to court you!” Steve blurted out in a hushed whisper, because they were still in a library and he couldn’t just yell. “Look, I know I’m not the kind of omega anyone would go for, but—”
“Hey, darling,” Tony said, holding up his arms for a hug.
“Thanks.”
Buk battled furiously against another tribe that had risen up from the sea with the intention of destroying his home village, which included Stiofán and a number of younger sisters. He lost an arm, but the gods were so impressed with his bravery that they restored it to him in a way that he could never lose it again. They called the metal
Stiofán hummed, contemplative as he tried to explain.
Tony took a minute to process all of that.
“Dad, I know I’m dense, but even MJ will agree with me!”
“You call this a flat white?”
Steve gaped at them, horrified. What were they talking about?
Steve nodded without hesitation. “Yeah. I just—I want to be invested, but I don’t want to get too invested. Is that weird?”
“Besides, I was colorblind before. Not a big deal. At least I still have my hearing.”
Clint looked thoroughly chilled, his teeth chattering and the end of his nose red. JARVIS might put on a mild-mannered, polite façade, but he was Tony’s creation. Buried under the desire to always be helpful and keep Tony (and certain others) alive if possible was a lot of second-hand sass and deviousness that most did not get to see. Tony would need to get the footage later.
Tony nodded, feeling a little confidence come back. “Yeah. I’ll meet you here?”
Mr. Rogers started to smile, which was a red flag in Tony’s book. “So, would you say that you have a harder time concentrating in your classes where you do a lot of rote memorization, worksheets, and where there are distractions, like a window or friends nearby?”
“What do I have to do? Make it a law for you not to be kidnapped? I will single-handedly lobby Congress if I have to!” Pepper exclaimed when he finally made it back to his apartment. “I swear, I am so sick of—oh thank god, you don’t have any flowers!”
Taking in a deep breath, he stared at himself hard in the mirror.
Tony kicked in the last of the drywall, revealing the space he knew would be there. They all quickly went inside, following his lead.
That was when he realized other people had just returned to the cave. Everyone seemed to be around the same age, which was unusual in a clan. None of them seemed to look related to one another either, which was even odder. They were dressed in various wraps, shawls, and cloaks made out of skins and more of that finely woven wool. It seemed to be warmer than the material he was dressed in, with horizontal and vertical lines crossing over one another to create a variety of patterns and colors. With how cold it seemed to be, Antonius wondered if he was further north, where the seasonal weather could be bitterer than the oceanic lands he knew.
. The real lazy people are the ones who don’t realize that.”
and he wasn’t going to let something like
As Steve continued to laugh his head off, Scott’s mutterings turned from annoyed to promises of never having a reliable internet connection ever again.
“Stems and leaves,” Tony replied. “No one coughs up stems and leaves.”
He remembered Peter’s mother. Dates matched up. Her pregnancy had to have been an accident, a fluke. Condoms weren’t always successful. But why she didn’t contact him again—or had she and his father send her away? Did she not want Tony in her life anymore than he already had been? If that was the reason, he didn’t blame her, but child support! He would have agreed to that!
“Awesome.”
This was uncharted territory. There wasn’t much research in the physiological effects of late blooming alphas or omegas. There was even a smaller amount of research regarding the physiological effects of an alpha in a relationship with a beta. Alphas and omegas were said to ‘balance each other out’ and that kind of relationship was the ‘preferred’ one. It was only in recent decades that society started to accept and recognize that other relationship combinations could be just as healthy and fulfilling as alpha-omega or beta-beta relationships.
“So, what brings you to the library? I didn’t see your name on the event roster.”
“Oh.”
Steve closed his eyes and enjoyed the warmth of Tony’s hand as the narration for Beauty and the Beast began, the piano playing in the background.
“Better to get it done and over with,” Tony said gently. “I’ll be there every second.”
“Cool,” Sam said. “I assume you can keep a secret?”
“Seriously? Fees for kids?” Tony asked.
When Peter told him that one of his teachers asked him to attend a parent-teacher conference, he was nearly in tears. Lately, he had been getting detention for not paying attention, forgetting his school supplies in his locker, or turning in assignments incomplete. There was no doubt that his son was brilliant—past grades and performances showed this—but everything had been spiraling out of control. Arguments and fights with his classmates. Insomnia. Losing track of his possessions at home and getting overwhelmed more frequently than ever.
Steve flushed. He couldn’t make words come out. Tony was reading his letters. Tony was reading his
He did his best to be what someone needed, tried to be what someone wanted…but he could never stop being himself and that seemed to be the problem.
“And you two are annoying for it, and so are all your inside jokes,” another guy said, coming out with a tray of muffins. He had wonderfully dark skin and cropped hair, tall and lithe like a runner. This was not
If Steve were to guess, his relationship with his relation was not the best. Maybe they clashed over artistic ideals. Maybe they clashed over more important matters like money. This man seemed to be doing well for himself regardless. But how did a working class mechanic get the money to fund an apartment like this? Steve wished he had that kind of luck.
The rest of the class remained silent.
Showing Captain America a pivotal piece of American culture? Yeah, he would fight tooth and nail for the chance to see him react to the Darth Vader Luke Skywalker Connection.
Tony blinked at him. “What?”
No one seemed to want an omega who could cook decently enough, but couldn’t make a Thanksgiving dinner all by themselves and occasionally liked takeout. No one seemed to like the idea of an omega cheering loudly and yelling at the umpire during a baseball game. Apparently leaving clothes on the bathroom floor by the hamper was a grievous sin and not just an annoying habit that his roommates grumbled at him about.
Steve looked up from the to-go cup where he was already writing Tony’s name. “No.”
“As I said, sir, any deeper probing would alert the people who are monitoring the servers. Considering the delicacy of this investigation, I believe that it will be a wiser decision to physically use a computer terminal known to access the server regularly. With the proper credentials and timing, accessing these files will not appear out of the ordinary.”
“Aww, that’s sweet,” she cooed.
“Hold on, come over here,” Tony said, tugging him towards one of the study rooms. He quickly locked the door and closed the blinds for privacy.
“What do you think?” Steve whispered, leaning in.
“Oh.”
“Trust me. We just want to help.”
Their meetings also led to Tony meeting Steve’s friends and Steve meeting his friends and somehow all of them becoming mutual friends. Tony went from five people he knew he could trust to … he kind of lost track at this point. They were all on his phone anyways, under nicknames specifically made to annoy them.
He blinked.
Captain America frowned. “It wasn’t your fault. HYDRA is a force to be reckoned with, as much as we do fight back against them.”
Well then.
“So,” Steve drawled out, feeling nervous. Hopefully the nausea would go away soon. “Wanna go see a movie? Dinner? And not just because it’s Alpha’s Night?”
How long had he been asleep? Had they examined him? Did they know his life depended upon an upgraded car battery
He pushed his chair back and let the guard see his screen, which did have the algorithms pulled up. Not that he was helping them become more efficient or anything. Why do that when he could create a back entrance for JARVIS and scramble all of their data after he was done? His phone had been on him when he was kidnapped and JARVIS was harder to turn off than most. They would need to throw his phone into a volcano to fully disable him.
Stiofán beamed. The pigment would likely dry a little darker, but … Antonius felt a warmth in his chest that he could not ascribe to the strange symbol the gods had placed within it.
Rhodey hummed and looked at the specialty board. “No … I kind of want to know what
Worth it enough to somehow get a perfectly preserved ranunculus flower settled in resin. If it were any bigger, it would be a paperweight.
“Hey! Steve! You got a package!”
Natasha punched him in the shoulder. “Don’t be immature. I’ve been dealing with it too.”
Tony’s phone alarm went off, giving them ten minutes before they were due for the meeting. He looked over to Peter, who was looking kind of pale now.
“Sleep alright?” Steve asked, hanging his clipboard on a hook. “Sorry we weren’t there.”
The sniper was silent for a moment. It was kind of creepy, not being able to see his expression, but Tony had a feeling he was weighing their options. Tony was as well, but with so many variables, it was hard to pinpoint if they could get to the roof safely.
“It doesn’t matter. I got all I want right here.”
Opening the door to a random floor, he was surprised that no one had followed him.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You’re all jerks.”
“Are my eyes deceiving me? Is our baby finally all grown up?” Sam asked, pretending to get all teary-eyed.
Oh, god. All the curse words in every language.
“We’re not going to risk it,” Natasha said, even as she continued to drink her chocolate shake.
“Hey, what are you doing?” a new guard yelled, striding over to his work station.
God, there was so much wasted time.
“Oh, no problem,” he replied. “Peter could always use more friends his—”
“Oh. Sorry.”
Tony rubbed the back of his neck, feeling a little warm. Bashful. Embarrassed?
Oh, like
She gave no reply, just continued to walk a ‘don’t kill yourself trying to get there first’ pace.
Would there be more definition between shadows and highlights? Would he have better or worse depth perception? Dogs relied on their sense of hearing and smell more than humans, so was he experiencing more of that because of the serum or because of a dog’s baseline abilities?
“Thank you,” Captain America said gratefully, before giving information to the person on the other side of the com. “Okay. They have a pickup on their way. ETA five minutes.”
Was the education system just that bad? Did Steve think it was just easier to go along with what everyone assumed and what society dictated alphas and omegas should be like?
His mind was a whirl. On one hand, he didn’t want to ruin the friendship they had. It was a good thing, one of the most important relationships in his entire life.
When he did not want to be found, Steve could not be found.
“And this happens at home too, right?”
Did this guy jump out of a fantasy magazine or something? Was he posing as a cashier for a photoshoot? Because Tony was certain that men built like a Greek statue with a smile like that did not work minimum wage part-time jobs. Seriously, that jawline alone would earn its own Times photo spread. He looked wholesome too, with a short haircut and a simple shirt under his apron that did nothing to disguise his built physique. And those shoulders.
Well, there was soup and movies.
“Oh, em,” Steve stammered. “Táim ceart go leor.”
“You’ll find out if I ever need blackmail material.”
Tony nodded. “Add a mocha to go.”
He was proud to be Irish, even if it was apparently a smear against his entire being, and they could denounce him until their faces turned blue, but he—
“I have been!” Tony protested.
Clint rolled his eyes. “As if you never did!”
If he thought he could continue being friends with them after that.
“Hi, Mr. Rogers,” Peter said softly, clearly nervous.
Mr. Rogers took the paper and blinked a few times. “Sure. That will be fine.”
“No clue. Could be both.”
“Oh.”
He found himself in Mr. Rogers’ classroom before he knew it. Like before, the classroom was empty of students … and Mr. Rogers as well. Scowling, Tony figured he was running late or something held him up in the hallway and took the opportunity to look around the classroom some more. Various maps of the United States were put around the classroom at eye level for easy reference. There was a large bulletin board and calendar filled with reminders for upcoming events and assignments. Then he spotted a section of a wall covered in sticky notes. Written in freaking
This wasn’t like
Inside his hand was a small pendant, something that would be strung on a necklace or kept in a pocket as a good luck charm. The resin was perfectly clear and highly polished, allowing a single ranunculus flower to be shown perfectly.
He shrugged. “No big deal. I do it all the time.”
“Yes.”
Everyone in the classroom jumped. Mrs. Elison was not the kind of person who raised her voice often. When she needed to get the class’s attention, she tended to do something like a clapping pattern or flicking the lights. She also had a few sounds on her phone if those did not work. Even when she
“Steve!”
Tony’s hand moved to stroke his hair and
“Antonius!” Peperi cried, her eyes becoming wet with tears. “We finally found you!”
Peter bit his lip. “Breather?”
He texted Sam, who laughed and offered to bring some cold medicine next time they met up for movie night. Steve’s reply was not appropriate for work.
Steve turned around, rolling his eyes. “Hello to you, too, Tony.”
A growl escaped his throat, but Steve didn’t bother to hold it back. He pulled out one of the many pens he had on him and signed the license before something could come along and prevent him from doing so. Knowing Tony, he likely had more copies in his bag.
theme to himself.
“My mom was from Italy, she could emphasize,” Tony said, memories of his mother bemoaning subpar olive oil or the lack of certain cheeses coming up. Not that it was ever too long of a loss, just sometimes a hassle to find out that one place in that one village didn’t have a phone and begging one cousin or another to make a run and send it through the mail.
“The Maria Stark Foundation. I wanted this meeting to go well. I want to expand into other areas, explore ways we can better serve communities, but there have been budget cuts. I really need to fight to make sure not a cent is taken away from the foundation.”
Captain America handed his earpiece over without a word and Tony went to work with the tiny wires and circuits. Not bad SHIELD, but still. They needed upgrades.
“Great!” He moved the papers around so all of them were visible, checking for papers that had anything written on the back. “JARVIS, scan all of these and let’s figure out what is going on.”
Mr. Rogers indicated for him and Mr. Thompson to go first, so Tony quickly stood up. He didn’t trust whatever little punk was back there with his child, even if there was an adult watching them. He wanted to reach Peter first, before anyone could say or do anything more. It took only a few seconds for him to see Peter sitting next to a blonde kid. Peter looked utterly remorse while the other kid had an air of being annoyed around him.
failing on him? Did they—
Tony didn’t get it. He was an alpha, and while not the tall and muscular stereotype that was featured on the covers of romance novels, was still beautiful. He also had a good positon at Stark Industries—the company he owned—and was insanely rich. He had omegas lining up for days for the chance to meet him and hopefully be ‘the one’.
“Tomorrow. I’ll take you out.”
However, they tended to go belly up and disappear all too quickly. Sometimes, Tony felt relieved because the place
“That’s a thing?” Ned exclaimed. “Cool!”
“You got this,” he told himself. “You can do this.”
Tony was the brilliant handyman who knew everything about science and mechanics, chemistry and physics. Steve was the temporary gardener who knew how to work the land and knew a thing or two about art thanks to the local parish allowing churchgoers access to their library. They shared a sense of humor, a fascination for the world around them, and the possibilities it held. They agreed on many topics regarding equality and reform.
“Glad you were curious, then.”
revelation.
“Okay. Does that sound like a plan, Peter?”
“Oh, Tony! Hey!”
“The children’s television host?” she asked, confused.
So, he thought and thought and made some decisions.
“Well, if you ever need a maintenance, or tune up, you know where to find me.”
“Anything else of his hanging up?” he asked.
“Can you get a call out?” Tony asked. “See if we can get an extraction team?”
Steve deserved more nice things.
Today’s coffee sleeve had hearts drawn all over it.
Peter’s whole face lit up and he quickly took it, hugging it to his chest. “Thank you!”
, and they were still boycotting the Salon de Paris. Tony was still not speaking to his father and his patents were coming along as scheduled. They were all still poor, doing what they could to make ends meet, but there was a lot more hope. A lot more happiness.
God, she must have been worried sick!
Tony still didn’t reply. Instead, his cheeks started to go red, which was hard with his skin tone.
“Mr. Stark—”
Steve reached up and wiped at an errant spot on Tony’s cheek, where something got smudged.
“Thank you for meeting with me for this,” Mr. Rogers said. “I’ll forward you an email so you can set up a meeting with our specialist and we can follow up at a later date ourselves. In the meantime, have a good weekend.”
Steve smacked Tony’s arm, flushed and panting a little from the bought of laughter. “Tony!”
“I’m waiting for NASA’s reply to my application,” Steve deadpanned.
“What time is it?” Tony asked. Sleepiness was shaking off of him quickly, as it always did. It only ever seemed to sink its claws into him when he
“No. No nausea either, but I haven’t been able to check on him because he’s barricaded himself in his room.”
“Thanks,” Peter whispered, hugging the oversized presentation board to his chest. “I can’t believe that was only five minutes. It felt like eternity.”
The end of the meeting felt anticlimactic. They said their goodbyes, both sides expressed gratitude for meeting with the other, and soon enough, Tony and Peter were walking back to the car where Happy was.
Clint let out a loud cheer.
, Rhodes. He bakes. He’s … he gets these little twinkles in his eyes when I make him laugh. Other people make my coffee and it doesn’t taste the same.”
Steve rolled his eyes as Bucky pretended to take pictures of him and Tony like they were high schoolers going to prom. “Knock it off. This isn’t our first date.”
But if he were to be asked, he wasn’t doing this because he wanted to change the world.
Tony scowled, feeling a little affronted. Where was he going with this? “I’m not going to do something’ll help those snakes.”
As soon as Steve was in his bathroom, Tony left the bedroom. Everyone else respected his wishes and stayed out as well. The food got delivered and paid for, Pepper left to pick up the candles and other items she had looked up. They felt only marginally better about the whole disaster, but the best thing to do was take it one step at a time.
It was almost palatable.
Steve pulled back to look over Tony’s shoulder. “Sorry I bit your head off, Buck.”
Tony glared at him, but the man only turned around and left. The guard said nothing, barely looking at him. He had his hand on his gun, though.
He never would have expected to see Tony.
“I shall bring tea by in about an hour,” Jarvis said, interrupting his conflicting thoughts. “He should be feeling hungry by then.”
“What?” she asked, grinning. “Can’t I appreciate and adore my friends? At least sunflower petals are edible! Put them on a salad!”
It was a much better living situation than being stuck in a mortgage with an abuser who was only looking for someone with ‘good genes’ to make more alphas with. As if they could predict what designation their children would be. Thank god they never made it that far. What would have happened if a child of theirs had chronic asthma? Or never bulked up like Steve did?
“Tony,” she repeated, laying a hand on his shoulder. She started to rub soothing circles into his back when he flinched. “JARVIS called. He said you weren’t responding. What’s wrong?”
“It’s fine, really. The offices are just down the block. Literally across the road. Besides, you need to get back home too.”
“I needed someone to rant to,” Tony protested.
“Right! This is Sherlock Holmes and that girl is no Irene Adler!”
Tony nodded, swallowing, trying to refocus. “Yeah. Sorry.”
Then it was lights out.
“I’m sorry. It’s not that I didn’t want to tell you—or that I wanted you to suffer, I just …”
“Right,” Steve confirmed.
“Was that your phone?” Steve asked.
She smiled and placed his phone on the bathroom counter. “You’re running a bit late. JARVIS called me, saying you maybe needed to talk to a person.”
God, he really hoped he could get to the bottom of this. He wanted to keep his promise to Yinsen and end this nightmare.
As Antonius’ fluency in their language improved, they shared stories.
Soon, Tony swore to himself, Stane was going down with them.
Captain America shook his head, cutting him off. “I don’t know what people are like these days, since I was asleep and all, but I can say that not a lot of people would have done all you did in that situation. If not for them being so unpredictable, your plan to use the chaos of the fire alarm would have gotten you out. Your actions are commendable.”
Tony sighed, his shoulders and whole body slumping. “Yeah.”
Standard protocol.
Though maybe their idiocy was a good thing.
“What happened?” Tony asked.
“I’m not following,” Bucky said. “Why would he be going through a rut? He barely goes through heats! It’s impossible! He’s not an alpha!”
Steve must have had it for years—it smelled just like him.
Tony pulled him into a heated kiss.
“To—Stark!”
“I am going to get some water. In the meantime, I want you to think of five countries you haven’t visited yet, okay?”
He was glad there wasn’t a bell on the door to signal when someone walked in. He was able to just stand in the doorway and listen. For a moment, he felt that he was intruding on something personal and private, but he reasoned that he wouldn’t tell anyone. It would be a secret he would keep all to himself, something for him to hold onto in the middle of the night.
“Fine, go, otherwise you’ll complain for the whole day and get nothing done.”
Turning it slightly, the petals still caught and reflected the light.
Agent Coulson had the gall to smile at him before he left.
Besides, he lived closer to Brooklyn.
Over the next two days, he worked on a drier patch of dirt to sketch out what he wanted to create. Pictures seemed to convey what he was trying to express more than his broken sentences. He begged and pleaded to the whole clan, explaining over and over again the reasons why he should be allowed a forge. It would take up a huge amount of time and resources to build a forge, let alone maintain one, but his creations could provide them with additional means of trade and income, or at least some new pottery to better protect their grain.
“Tony, if you wanted to ask me out, couldn’t you have done it when I wasn’t covered in pollen and snot?”
Bucky looked at them for a long moment. Tony and Peter were covered in various mechanical oils and surrounded by tools, cogs, and wires.
“We could call Doctor Strange,” she offered. “If anything, he could probably snap his fingers.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked. Tony realized then that his tone sounded like he thought this was a crime. “It’s good for business. You wouldn’t imagine the desperate university students that’re in this area.”
This was about what he needed no matter what label he was given. He likely wouldn’t have all the symptoms, reactions, or patterns an alpha typically had during their rut. At best, they would just need to see what worked and remember what didn’t.
People were putting pumpkins on their stoops, everyone was going crazy over pumpkin spice lattes, and kids were starting to talk about Halloween costumes. Trees were beginning to turn colors, fog was setting in earlier at night and lingering longer in the morning, and now that the weather wasn’t trying to kill them, a lot more outdoor festivals were getting set up.
Tony didn’t doubt it. Performance was serious business. “I’m sure they’re proud.”
Pepper looked surprised for a moment before she started smiling. “Please tell me it was that barista—Steve, right? Bruce keeps saying that every time you see him, it’s like you’re walking on sunshine.”
God, Tony Stark was not like most other parents he had met due to teaching.
Pepper looked at the apple cake, all warm and fresh, with a critical eye. Tony knew that she occasionally liked sweet stuff, and while many people assumed she preferred the more elegant and fanciful desserts,
of them.
Somewhere near to where his heart was.
Bucky, thankfully, picked up after barely a ring.
She looked up and narrowed her eyes. “Since when do you care about fresh air?”
Clint shushed them as he got up and draped a blanket around Peter’s shoulders. “No arguing. Only the soothing power of Disney.”
Tony was impressed with Mr. Thompson’s reaction and Peter looked surprised too.
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “You cheat on me with your machines every day. Now, come on, I want a real meal, not motor oil and caffeine.”
Steve looked like he had been punched in the gut.
It was not fair.
“Antonius?” Stiofán said, gently.
“Stark?” Captain America said quietly. “We’re going to get you out of here.”
Tony quirked an eyebrow. “Yeah, because it’ll be useful for him to have.”
“Okay. Shoot.”
“Do you want anyone else in the room with you?”
“Shh!” one parent hissed as yet another student started to do a presentation about the 9-11 Terrorist Attacks. They had to be given props, though, for continuing on despite being the seventh student to do the topic. Students weren’t the only ones who had to hold back their groans. At least some more thought seemed to be put into it, with the long-term aftermath of the horrific event being the focus instead of the immediate response.
Person a is a writer who works best on coffee at midnight and person b's coffee shop is the only one on campus thats open
When he finally fell asleep that night, he recalled how the gods said that he would suffer.
Antonius followed Stiofán as he led him to a deeper part of the cave. He had seen Stiofán and the others go back there from time to time, but he left it alone, recognizing it as a sacred area for offerings and prayers to be made to a god. With the light of a torch they kept there, he saw that there was a simple niche carved into the rock of the cave. There was a bowl, a statue made of stone, and a rock painted with the same swirls as those in the huge burial chamber.
“When I was kidnapped in Afghanistan, I got shrapnel in my bloodstream, and right now, I have an improved car battery in my chest that is keeping me alive.”
When Peter didn’t answer right away, Tony pulled back to look at him. Peter’s lip was wobbling and he saw it was still swollen. His cheek was bruised as well. He imagined that Peter had some other bruises and scrapes under his jacket and jeans.
And when they did, he would be ready for the fallout.
series. Steve was really going back in time. These stories were the foundations of science fiction, the stuff that led to
Tony was wheezing, trying to take in a breath of air, but the situation was apparently too comical for words. All he could do was laugh.
Standing up, Tony tugged free a blanket from the bed and wrapped it around Steve’s shoulders.
“Well, as long as it doesn’t happen again.”
It would be difficult, complicated.
Steve put in
Then, in a swift movement, Peter put the book on the counter and leaned over, hugging Steve tightly. “Thank you, thank you, thank you!”
“Hey,” he said, opening the door a crack to see inside.
“Another cappuccino, Tony?” Natasha asked.
Where was he? Where had the gods sent him?
He loved it when Steve’s cheeks flushed in embarrassment or his eyes flashed with righteous anger. He loved his laugh. He loved how passionate he could get. There were many nights where he dreamed of just running his hands over Steve’s smooth, pale skin and enjoying seeing love bites last on his skin for much longer because there was no tan to hide them. He was intelligent in ways that Tony wasn’t, loyal to his friends, and just … good.
Steve grabbed the bag closest to him and dug in.
“Something like that.”
Before he could second guess himself, Steve stood on his toes and grabbed Tony’s shirt, pulling him down into a kiss. Tony’s arms came around him, holding him close, and oh, that felt nice.
Even though the man was covered in oil stains and grease, looking like he came from some factory, the apartment was practically luxurious. It was like something from a magazine selling furniture in the latest styles or a romance novel that Jane Austen had written. For instance, a wood table was placed next to a window with sheet curtains. Nothing was on it, but Steve could imagine putting a vase of flowers in the center of it and capturing the sunlight—
All of the robots exploded at the same time.
. You got nothing on me.”
Tony sputtered. “W-What?”
“Soon to be driving in Ferrari jerks,” Bucky grinned.
“Do you do a lot of worksheets? Or tests?”
Tony used ‘love’ in a sentence.
“Yeah?”
Real life was, oddly, kinder than the comics. Bucky was obviously not some mascot kid, tagging around because he saw Captain America without his mask, though he was just as loyal and dedicated. He hadn’t died during the plane crash and was never captured by HYDRA scientists.
“You were fine,” Steve said. “Honest. You watched some movies, ate some soup, and slept. And apparently questioned my technology choices.”
Antonius stepped closer to him.
Sometimes he would look in the mirror and see nothing but skin and bones, weak lungs, and pale skin that could never hold a tan.
Oh no.
“Like he’s got a cold and the flu—fever and chills, sore muscles, sound and light bother him, and he hasn’t eaten anything since last night. He’s been absolutely miserable.”
Thank you all so much for the comments and kudos on the last chapter. They really made my day as they came in! I hope all of you are doing well and are being as safe as you can. I know this world-wide lock down is hard, and our lives are never going to be the same after this, but I know we can get through it. Hang in there!
“Hey,” Tony said softly.
Steve was the one who noticed why Peter was struggling and reached out to help. He was the one who defended him and worked with him these last few months, pulling out all the stops. Because of his efforts, Peter was flourishing. He was coming back home, excited to tell Tony about his day and the things they learned, what they were working on, and was no longer panicking when he couldn’t understand something or focus long enough on a question. He was still hyperactive at times, and could be forgetful, but Tony was giving him some leeway with that, as he wasn’t even a teenager yet. He had plenty of time to learn, adapt, and develop healthy habits.
“But I—this means—”
It was beautiful.
Steve snorted. “We’re joined at the hip, as always.”
So, it was someone he trusted.
. Not desirable, my ass. You’re gorgeous!”
Tony had done his best to help: more alarms and reminders on Peter’s phone, a check list of items for Peter to confirm were in his backpack … but even JARVIS could only do so much.
“What—”
Bucky gave him a look. “Hey, don’t go blaming yourself. None of us were expecting this.”
Perhaps … perhaps in this part of the world, they had not.
Or it was in Steve’s opinions, but he preferred the ideas that were coming out of Norfolk than the popular ‘neoclassicism’ that was gaining more popularity. It was just a bunch of ‘enlightened’ rich boys trying to recreate the Renaissance in his opinion.
There was no way Tony meant those words.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Pepper told me you were jet-lagged. How much coffee did you have?”
Tony scowled and waved a paw in the air. “Fine, fine, we’ll just hold off on solving this for a little while longer. Tell everyone I’ll do voice conferences or emails, no video meetings. Tell them I’m sick and still very vain.”
“Come in,” Steve said, making sure to close the door behind them. “Are you cramping up? Go sit on the couch, I’ll help get you settled.”
Steve was on break, sitting across from Tony at a small table towards the back. When Steve asked if he could join him, so he wouldn’t be taking away a table from a customer, Tony just about had an aneurysm. It was one thing to be separated by the counter and register, or to be a discreet dozen feet away with a cup of coffee, but this close? This kind of proximity?
“You are amazing,” Tony repeated. “Absolutely amazing. I don’t care about what alphas or omegas are supposed to be like. Screw that. Throw the book out. I’m just oblivious, okay? Sometimes I need someone to spell something out for me before I get it.”
Given that it
What else would be revealed as they continued? What else would he learn? Did he leave the dishes in the sink to be washed at the end of the day instead of putting them in the dishwasher right away like a normal human? Did he always lose a sock? What kind of foods did he hate? What were his 3 AM cravings? Did he sleep like a rock or did he toss and turn?
But with the way that everyone else chuckled or showed some other forms of amusement, it was meant to be harmless and was not out of character for her. It made him want to be wary of her, but … But he didn’t want to be wary or suspicious of anyone here. It was not as if they were greeting him like some sort of king or deity, but as if … he was just a person.
The safety equipment Tony was wearing was quickly stripped off and before Steve could blink, Tony was rushing over like nothing had happened.
He couldn’t even finish his name before he had to cough again.
“Yes,” Steve said, not sure how his mouth was working for that to happen. “I’m fine. Please stop asking.”
There were few tribes or clans who had been able to amass much of anything, let alone enough to kill over. To simply kill for the thrill of it—
Steve only grinned. “That’ll be the day.”
Natasha glared. “I’m sure one of the rules is
“What? Yeah, yeah. Sure.”
If friendship was all Steve wanted, then hell, he wasn’t going to throw that away. Steve was a good thing in his life. He was going to hold onto him however he wanted to be held.
Schools were supposed to be safe places for kids! Sure, there would be arguments and bullying was to be expected, and he could not imagine that every kid out there was a perfect angel who would never get into a fight, but this was different!
towards Steve?
If they didn’t have tabs on him, he was going to be very, very disappointed.
Rhodey’s eyes darted down to Tony’s chest for a moment, but he quickly covered up whatever he was thinking or feeling. Tony let it slide too. He was only back for a short time, probably. He didn’t want to spend the time moping around or angsting. Brooding? Either way, he wanted to spend his time laughing, sharing jokes, maybe a few rounds at a bar. Watch a horrible movie and making Pepper groan at all the popcorn they threw around the penthouse living room. Buy a Roomba at an ungodly hour, reprogram it, and watch it zoom around better than before.
“I thought you did all the roasting.”
Steve laughed, shaking his head and made him a regular cappuccino. “You will thank me when you’re not having an afternoon crash.”
“Hey, Steve!” Scott called, waving from across the street.
He looked out and his eyes widened at all before him: miles and miles of meadows and fields, forests and the slightest hint of a river in the distance. Gone were the tall mountains and intense hills of grain and crops, scattered with villages. Gone were the bright blue skies and a view of the ocean from all directions. Even though he knew it was the middle of the growing season and the sun should be beating down on him relentlessly, it felt as if they were in the depths of winter with unusually chilling winds and expected rains. As a matter of fact, it appeared that rain was already on its way—but the clouds moved so quickly across the landscape, it was as if the gods were changing their minds about the weather right before his eyes.
Jarvis left the tea tray outside of the workshop about an hour later. When they thought of it, or needed it, it would hopefully still be hot.
Just … awful.
Or, if Betty was correct, now friendlier terms.
Part of him was screaming that he shouldn’t be telling Steve right now, but hell,
. “Then we’ll just have to wait until your shift is over. Or maybe after closing, when everyone else has gone home.”
“Where is my son?” he demanded as he burst into the front office.
They chatted a bit more over the shared experience of coughing up petals for loved ones, in all the forms that love came in, before parting to their respective tasks again.
“Unless it’s Natasha messing with us.”
Natasha grinned from her perch in the love seat. “I’ll enjoy watching you squirm.”
“It’s what I do,” she replied with a smile. “Or what I am training to do.”
Where the hell did they even come from? Were they hiding behind a mop?!
Then Steve started blushing hard and went back to his book.
Antonius had a feeling that if given the chance, they would have started a revolution back on Thrinacia and undone every plot and scheme Ovadyah came up with.
“So, we do what?” Tony asked, unable to hold back a scowl. “Do tests? Put him on medication?”
“He’s sick!”
now. It was a long-standing tradition where on one night a year, an omega could steal their alphas, to prove that they were on equal footing as their alpha counterparts. There were all sorts of ways this was taken, from proposing to an alpha to the much more common literal kidnapping of an alpha.
He refused to apologize. Tony should have been honest with who he was. He shouldn’t have led him on like he did. He could have gotten Steve fired! He could have caused a scandal that would have made it impossible for Steve to live! Finding work that wouldn’t kill him was hard enough! Working in the factory, hot, sweaty, and cramped, was a torture. Bucky insisted that they could find something else for him, something easier on his lungs, but they needed the income.
“But you never said anything!”
Antonius’ heart skipped a beat when everyone else nodded.
Steve got a wistful look in his eye, just for a moment, before it was tucked away behind more pure excitement. “Kind of. I finally have the money to own my own copies. Now the librarians won’t chase me down for renewing something for the fifth time.”
Then he got the letter.
“And cheat on you?” he gasped, clutching at where his heart should be. “Never!”
Tony inwardly cheered, because who didn’t like coffee breaks? He was pretty sure that Pepper had not gone to the coffee shop yet, so he was extra excited. Unlike Bruce, she was absolutely unspoiled. He could witness a pure first impression. It was going to be like seeing a little kid watch
She nodded. “My offer still stands. Tony might be a friend, but we care about you too.”
Steve continued to gape and flush at him like a fish out of water.
A few nights later on a Darts-And-Fries night, Steve had another coughing fit that was getting quite familiar.
“Ice cream?” Tony whispered.
What did he mean, ‘one step at a time’?
Someone was bound to have called the police now.
“Making me an unofficial taste tester, huh?” Tony asked, grinning. “You’re lucky I haven’t had breakfast.”
“Oh god,” Tony moaned, burying himself further into the scarf. “Thank you! You sure you aren’t cold?”
“Pepper is a little snitch.”
It was like he had insulted Steve’s mother. Like he had insulted a sacred institution. Tony scrambled to come up with something,
Antonius’ heart thudded with panic.
. I don’t need any romance. I mean, it would be nice, but it’s not a top priority for me right now.”
“How—how long has it been?” Peter asked.
Tony looked unimpressed. “It’s only because you work with kids that I don’t tease you for knowing that reference.”
Tony gave him an amused look. The discussion between which was better, the Dewey Decimal system or the genre section, had yet to be resolved. “Come on.”
“It’s alright,” he said. “But next time, you’re going to double check your textbook list before classes start, and long before the first test, right?”
Mrs. Elison frowned. “I beg to disagree. What he called you was very inappropriate and I want to assure you that I do not tolerate that behavior in my classroom. I am not sure what can be done right now, but if he continues to harass you at any time, I want you to let me know, okay? We can figure something out like changing his schedule or teachers.”
He had been drawing in the mud again, so absorbed in his drawing and calculations that he had not noticed someone approach him.
Two percent.
Peter was practically trembling.
“You’re not threatening to sue them?” Pepper asked when he complained.
“Well?” Bucky asked.
? You are lucky that Stark is not suing us for personal damages or whatever else his lawyers might come up with!”
“Yup,” Bruce agreed, stealing a cookie off Betty’s plate.
“Yes,” Tony said, nuzzling their noses together. “I love you. I think I love you even more now, knowing that what you were doing was just because you’re a good, kind person. God, someone would go over the top and attempt to make homemade soup from scratch, but having it on hand? Ready when I actually needed it? Like you said, so much better.”
The man balked. “No! The Académie are just a bunch of frumpy idiots! I should know, I’m related to one of them!”
He never thought he would be thankful for getting kidnapped in Afghanistan. It was the mother of all wake-up calls and he wished that so many people didn’t have to die for it to happen.
No one but them makes it right
Sam laughed, shaking his head as he went to finish wiping down tables. “You and your sci-fi.”
He could hear the smirk in Rhodey’s voice. “I have my ways.”
Stiofán was absolutely
As a matter of fact, after he finished some tests, he needed to call for a meeting.
Alice started protesting, but the closing of the portal cut her off.
Sure, he knew he was famous. He knew that people recognized him instantly for one reason or another, but in the weeks that he had been coming here, no one treated him like some celebrity. No one stopped him for an autograph or tried to shove their latest creation at him or beg him for a job. Heck, no one even made a joke about him not leaving a good tip. Not that he didn’t, because in this economy and with the horrible wages everyone was being paid, he had to help out somehow. A ten or a twenty here and there really wasn’t going to hurt
The kid was too kind, too compassionate. Oh, they had their moments. What parent and child didn’t? But Tony always would stand by what he had said before: Peter was more than he
The weekend it was brought up, over dinner and cookies, May and Ben had assured him that there was nothing wrong either. May, being a nurse, was even able to discuss what ‘wrong’ meant in the medical sense. It was a world’s difference from the definition that most people would ascribe to it—none of that philosophical stuff that left a bad taste in Tony’s mouth.
fan, or did he prefer
“Stephen!”
Steve laughed, his shoulders shaking. “No. We leave the door open for safety reasons.”
He pushed away his thoughts and worries. It was only dinner. They could see how this would go.
“I remember seeing it once as a kid,” Steve said. “It was a classic.”
Rule Number One Of Kidnapping Tony Stark:
“You can still be an
It was then he realized that this was more than alphas, omegas, and the behaviors that were associated with them. It was bigger than heats or ruts. Why were they trying to fit him into some preconceived notion? Why were they thinking about him in terms of alpha or omega? Pigeonholing him into anything wouldn’t do him any good.
“No!”
“I don’t know anyone who likes crocus flowers,” Clint commented, holding up one of them.
“Hey! I got a doctorate too!” the sunglasses man cheered.
When the guard was finally on the other side of the room again, where the door was, Tony went back to hacking the security camera feed. He didn’t need a physical door to escape.
Steve gave a bit of a smile. “Yeah.”
Peter probably did. Just in more ways than that.
Steve gave Tony a wave as he headed out of the library, pausing only for some of the kids that were still lingering around to give high-fives, a few one-armed hugs, and the like. Seeing the joy on the kid’s faces brought out a soft expression on Tony’s face that Steve liked to commit to memory as much as possible. Then he was out the door, off to somewhere else.
“Car,” Bucky insisted. “Pepper told me about the time he sent her flowers. An office full of them. No one needs that many flowers.”
Even though he lied, she made no further comment.
It was starting to make him cross out date ideas, for when he asked Steve out. God, he hoped Steve said yes. He hoped nothing ruined this evening and a second chance.
As far as days off went, the one Steve had was going very well. He woke up early, went on his run through Central Park as always, and came back to the apartment to clean up and make a to-do list for the day. He fully intended to do errands, do his agreed upon chores, and a dozen other things he had been putting off lately due to an increase of events at the library. He even went to a stationary store and had gotten some nicer paper and envelopes to put his love letter to Tony in.
Bucky was still giving him that look. The look that said he knew that Steve was off daydreaming about Tony. Again. God, he was screwed. Royally screwed. And not in the way he’d like.
“Hey, wait,” Tony said as he fished through his pockets for a moment. He grinned when he found a piece of paper and a pen, then quickly scribbled his phone number down on it. “Here, my direct line. So you don’t have to email me so much or set up so many meetings, even though those are top priority. It’ll be quicker, unless something does need to be formal and all that.”
“Tony, you’re getting close to getting a knuckle sandwich.”
Were there police sirens? Did someone finally call in some backup?
“Hey there, gorgeous.”
“You should send them anyway.”
He was never, ever going to do
“We’ll be fine. Promise,” Tony vowed.
Steve held the door open for Tony and opened his umbrella before either of them stepped out into the rain. “One … two … three!”
He sounded so
God, he was so gone on him.
“Tony?”
“I don’t think anyone ever really means to. Emotions are complicated—sometimes you can’t help but feel the way you do.”
Pepper stared at the two of them for a moment. “Peter, why don’t we get some more ice on your lip and I plot some legal revenge, while your father orders some dinner? Your father can crush on your teachers all he wants, but it would be a legal nightmare for them to date.”
“Nothing is for sale, Tony,” she quipped. “This place runs on air.”
Steve must have dozed off again, because he suddenly smelled lab chemicals, dust, and hot dogs—before he blinked, Peter had flopped onto the couch with a deep sigh. There was also a thick cloud of something stagnant and sour hanging over him. Steve recognized the frustration from earlier, but if the bags under Peter’s eyes were any indication …
“We’re a soap opera, babe. We might as well get used to it.”
And he was delighted when Steve did more than kiss: hug, hold hands, nudge shoulders, poke him in the side when he found out he was ticklish there, press his chest against Tony’s back so he could watch him work (with prior permission, of course) …
“Huh,” he mused, wondering.
“You got a printer?”
Tony sat next to him, his whole body sagging.
“Because I complain for three weeks?”
this place. It was more than the drinks—the drinks could be garbage sludge for all he cared, but he was beginning to think of Steve and the rest of them as regulars in his life, if not friends. He had no idea what they thought of him, but they had yet to ban him from the premises or give any signs that their friendly attitudes towards him were anything but genuine. That had to be a good thing, right?
He sighed as he took a second swig of it outside. It wasn’t the same, for some reason. He knew, logically, that unless she used a different kind of bean, it would taste the same. This cup tasted flatter, like the beans hadn’t been roasted right or there was some sort of artificial flavor. There wasn’t even a cute little doodle, just his name written in an elegant script. Incorrectly.
Antonius looked up, scrambling back.
If it weren’t for Tony being able to use magic to visit him and help organize his escape, he would have gone insane in that barely lit tower. Even though he still felt guilty, and he would regret having to burn down his own capitol, Tony was right: someone else’s betrayal was not his fault.
Steve started talking about how his art was finally taking off, glad that vintage styles were finally coming back into style and people were appreciating his historical references.
“No problem.”
Tony chuckled and grabbed a random bill and shoved it into the tip jar. “You deserve it.”
Could he get rejected by Steve without losing him and the others?
And no one would ever come back.
All the guard said was “don’t move” before he rushed out of the room, not even locking the door. Tony finished up a few things on the computer before heading out the door too. No one would find anything on the computer, or in a few hours, on any computer in the network they used. Closed systems were so nice in that sense.
Antonius did not know what happened next, for when he awoke, he was somewhere else again.
“Yeah, it’s the weirdest thing,” Bucky said, clearly frustrated and worried. “All the times he’s been sick, he’s been a grumbly, needy thing. Now this is like—I don’t know!”
Steve got up, picked a newspaper up from one of the convenient stacks, and before Tony could even get out of the way, lightly swatted the top of his head.
“Everything alright?” Tony asked, frowning.
Steve used those two seconds to buy their tickets and did not even give Tony a chance to make a token protest.
“Yes, Steve,” Tony said gently, reaching forward and taking his book. Some pages were now bent, but it would live. Then Tony held his hands properly.
“Chicken soup?” Tony repeated.
He wanted to rush over to where Obie was and punch his face in. He wanted his blood on his hands and his brains on the floor. He wanted him to be put on trial and have to personally sign checks to the families of everyone he had ever had a hand in killing.
—it was old-fashioned, vague, and did not fit him
“Hey there,” Tony said. “You guys are closed?”
Tony put his tablet down and shuffled closer to Steve.
“Cappuccino and …” Tony trailed off.
“Stark, how does it look around on your end?” Captain America asked.
“Are you going to go to Mars someday?” Tony asked, wondering if Steve was ignoring everyone or just that absorbed in the story.
“Like what?”
“No,” she repeated before he could ask again.
“Hey, you trust me? At least enough to go out on a limb?”
He could no longer hear the sound of water dripping and echoing.
“Morning,” Tony greeted, like he had only arrived there a second before. Really, he was savoring the difference between his singing voice and his speaking voice, committing the whole thing to memory and wishing JARVIS was able to record it. He seemed to have a knack for knowing when to capture moments for posterity. “Vinyl, nice.”
He was on a date. With
“It’s the best,” Tony replied with a wink. “You got good taste, kid.”
Tony was the reason why Steve checked out the book on courting in the first place. They had met in the library some months ago when a girl from an art class Steve was hosting commandeered some robotic parts from Tony’s class. It had caused quite a scuffle between their two groups of kids, until one of them helped the little girl connect the various parts together so the whole painting came to life with lights and moving paper gears.
Everyone had heard of Manet’s famous café discussion groups. He and his friends were some of the leading artists of the day, even if they were associated with the movement that had yet to be named. Steve admired them from afar, knowing their talent for art was so much greater than his. He sometimes daydreamed about joining them, but—
JARVIS pulled up the public records that stated he was the father of a ten-year-old boy. His records had only
“I love you,” Steve said.
Tony’s cheeks were rosy and his eyes were bright.
Okay. Not as thoughtful of a question as he could have come up with. People sponsored terrorist organizations all the time. People joined terrorist organizations all the time. Hell, most of the people who committed acts of terror, as the dictionary defined it, weren’t even in large organizations bent on taking over the world. They were just people who wanted to cause change of some sort and thought that violence and chaos was the best method. If they didn’t have some twisted, racist ideals pushing their actions in one direction or another already. He knew about those people intimately. He was only in the hands of such—
Tony jabbed his elbow into the goon’s gut and dropped down low, surging up and disarming him with a few quick moves. It was nothing formal, nothing he learned from a class or even a YouTube video. Just a lot of unfortunate experience.
He looked thin and wane from his imprisonment, locked away in a tower like some sort of war trophy for nearly a year. It had been difficult organizing a coup when the person they wanted on the throne was literally inaccessible, but they managed it. The castle was in disarray. The true king was finally free. They had captured multiple enemies of the state.
Steve stopped in front of a terraced house. The door was painted black and framed by two columns. He recalled the differences between Italian and Greek columns. Unlike the house’s neighbors, these were definitely of Tuscan design. He shook his head and steeled himself even as his throat burned and his lungs struggled to work properly. He could do this. He had not marched up all the way from St. Giles to Mayfair for the fun of it. He did not avoid pickpockets, multiple propositions, and the suspicious eyes of coppers just because he had some fancy whim.
Tony stayed with him the rest of the day, informing their friends and sticking around as the doctors examined him.
Right. They had gone head-to-head with HYDRA before. Tony guessed some things never changed.
He supposed it couldn’t be too horrible, as long as it wasn’t something like a rhubarb latte. That was a mistake Starbucks was never going to make again.
Tony was pushed and prodded down a carpeted hallway until they reached a room with a few computers and not much else in it. There was a small window, but the blinds were shut. He couldn’t gleam much information from the hallway alone, but the walls lacked any cracks or crumbling plaster, and the carpet was rather clean, so this wasn’t some abandoned warehouse.
“I want fifty of those.”
The sniper laughed; the sound was horrifying. “Goons are always the same.”
Tony wasn’t sure how much of it might have been hero worship at the beginning, but all thoughts about that flew out the window when Peter made him a father’s day card because he couldn’t find one in a store that said what he wanted to say. The letter drove him to
Being away from a partner for an extended amount of time was hard enough, but that was why Pepper planned this trip around Steve’s heat schedule. It was the general thing to do to prevent this exact kind of situation, but surprises happened. Day or two early kind of surprises, though. Not a
Did HYDRA really think this was a good idea? With all of the equipment and glass, this was going to get dangerous and messy.
Rhodey passed by him, barely noticing him. “Sorry!” he said over the coms.
“I’ve been trying to hint at this for weeks, but either I was being too subtle or you were being too blind.”
“Hey,” Sam said, going to the refrigerator and pulling out a soda. “How’s the courting going?”
“Alright. Food it is,” he said, walking out into the hallway with Steve. “And something in black and white?”
“Then my statement still stands.”
Oh, damn—what kind of dirt did Bucky have on him? What kind of annoyances could Sam and Natasha rant about? Natasha probably had all the juicy stuff.
Steve still tossed some water on him when Tony revealed that he recorded the entire conversation where Steve’s accent and slang came out more than usual. A classmate, who was putting on a production of
He never could resist a good pun.
Tony sulked all the way back to SI. It still didn’t taste as good as when Steve made it.
But the man got a sad looking bran muffin stuffed into a bag along with his apparently poorly made flat white and left.
“That’s it,” Steve replied with a nod. “I didn’t know you knew about SHIELD or HYDRA. I knew you were a brilliant inventor, but who doesn’t? I have no idea how you all created everything you did in the time I was asleep.”
Flash swallowed. “Y-Yes?”
“Yeah, I just—”
“And given that Peter picked up on it, yes, you need to talk to someone about this. Though I’m glad you already know that it’s not ethical to date your son’s teacher.” Pepper patted his arm comfortingly. “But I know your priority is Peter.”
to win custody. Tony knew that cases like this could be dragged out for much longer depending upon the circumstances, but thank god his lawyers did their jobs very well and a few of them supported his goal to adopt Peter. Even Pepper thought he was doing the right thing and she had seen him at his worst. Sometimes, even a year after Peter finally came home, Tony suspected he didn’t quite believe it.
Pepper commented that they should have known he would have used the suit; he didn’t build something for it to be shoved in a corner and forgotten.
“What god did mark me?” he asked. “Why did they mark me?”
Yes, he now knew his name. Without having to awkwardly look for a name tag or ask. Smooth, Tony,
to be a mistake.
charity.
“Hey, Tony!” Sam called as he worked on a drink for another customer.
“Yeah.”
“My question still stands.”
“You just scared me, is all,” Tony murmured.
A bomb went off.
“Uh, yeah,” Steve said, standing up from what looked to be a massive amount of paperwork. From what Tony could see, a lot of it had to do with bills or government stuff. “About ten minutes ago, but I could—”
“Go, big guy, go!”
He would
Steve smiled to himself as he made sure he had everything and put on his helmet. Some of his students were little monsters, sure, but he would give them the benefit of the doubt for a few more years. They still had time to grow. Peter, on the other hand, Steve knew that he was going to go off and do wonderful, amazing things. There were few kids who had that combination of being intelligent, compassionate, and always wanting to do their best. Tony had really done a wonderful job, giving Peter a home he could thrive in—
“Traitor!”
“Aren’t you part of the machine?” Sam asked. “It’s only
“Guys, it’s fifty out. That’s pleasant,” Bucky argued.
“Oh my god, this is fantastic!”
Then Stane happened and he had to forget about the parties, the drinks, and so many other aspects his wealth ‘afforded’ him. The betrayal had been a huge wake up call. He needed to think about the future—beyond stock markets and sales and what outrageous headline he could get printed next. He needed to get his head out of his ass, because he couldn’t be blind anymore. Not when his inattention
Suddenly, turning a corner, he found himself falling hard on the sidewalk.
He wasn’t able to stop Abomination.
“Tony?”
Buk listened in confusion, not knowing the language they spoke in. Others of the clan were now coming around, curious and bewildered.
Tony felt … ‘hypocritical’ was probably the wrong word.
Tony snorted. “No, I’m pretty sure you came out of the womb perfect.”
He couldn’t finish his sentence because the sniper shot him in the forehead with another gun he pulled out of his belt.
Especially when he had to excuse himself to cough up some gladioli while Steve got the last bits of a fern leaf out of his mouth.
“Very good, sir. I shall inform Miss Potts as well.”
‘Bucky’, as the name tag said, had soft looking hair pulled back into a low ponytail and blue-gray eyes Tony was sure people loved to get lost in. That his flirty smile seemed to be more a natural feature than a conscious effort probably helped with those photoshoots. Before the head honchos got in too deep with owing someone a favor and they had to flee their beloved Italy.
“It’s still demeaning. An omega doesn’t need to steal an alpha to prove they’re worthy or equal to an alpha. We do it all the time by literally doing all the things you guys do. Every day.”
“She does like to chat a lot.”
They might have taken his phone, but he doubted they got into it or even noticed that JARVIS was running. Not that they would have seen him even if they did get in. Huh. He wondered why someone didn’t wake him up, demanding his passcode. Did they make a clone? He was going to have to massively scrub it or trash it altogether. He wouldn’t even risk making a backup.
was a shock to his world.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, that sounds more realistic.”
“I’m not patronizing you. I mean it. Give it a go, show some of your paintings. Tell them you were rejected from the Académie too. Ask them about the
He wanted
Tony’s mind crashed for a moment.
“Here, give me one of those,” he said, holding out his hand and grabbing a screwdriver in his other. “I know a thing or two about getting around jammers.”
Tony used the distraction and ducked into a stairwell. There were others already going down the stairs, but the crowd was much thinner. There was so much empty space. So many openings for someone to shoot and only two ways go to: up or down.
Tony looked at Flash, who didn’t seem to have a scratch on him. Uh-huh. Sure.
She had been a one night thing, nothing special or out of the ordinary. Gone in the early morning light like so many others.
He closed his eyes and tried to separate the image that was Captain America and the human being that was Steve Rogers. It was going to take a while. He was going to have a lot of doubts and questions. There would be arguments and miscommunication. He was going to say something to screw this all up, have everything explode in their faces. It was inevitable. He was Tony Stark.
Tony grabbed him by the front of his shirt and kissed him hard. He didn’t care about the floral taste in Steve’s mouth, just the moan he let out before kissing him back and the feeling of Steve climbing into his lap and the aroused flush on his cheeks.
“Espresso with milk, cinnamon, and honey,” Natasha said. “A friend of mine told me about the drink he had while on a layover in Spain.”
it took all the brain capacity Tony had to string two sentences around Steve
Bruce sighed deeply while looking at the ceiling and then turned the tea kettle off. “You’ll have to forgive me, but I’m going back to bed. It’s too late in the morning to deal with something out of a Disney movie.”
now his day off work and the dishes
Peter jumped out of his skin and his screwdriver dropped to the floor with a clatter.
Stiofán touched his knee, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Make a hole in that wall!” he yelled, pointing to the interior wall that now had deep cracks in it.
Like this was going to be another would-be home that would end sooner or later.
“Don’t be,” he said kindly, giving him a smile. “You were amazing out there. Just hang on until we can get to HQ. Then we can get some food in you.”
“Please, I would have smelled like apple pies and you know it.”
“We should find some Jackie Chan movies,” Steve suggested.
He shook his head, taking in a gasping breath.
Steve winced. “I know the feeling.”
An hour later, they had bounced dozens of ideas and conversation topics around, talking about anything and everything under the sun in some random way that would confuse anyone listening in. But Tony was amazed by Peter’s brilliance, how he approached any topic with enthusiasm, how he was so, so curious—
His knees shook as he stood. The light moved with him.
He jumped when he felt Tony’s hands on his, gently pulling them away from his face.
“Go she to the forest,” Stiofán explained.
Then it would be easier to turn them down and somehow move on.
Tony continued to ramble on a little more. Steve knew he was being a good friend. He was offering what he could with what resources he had. Natasha offered the same thing after the last asshole he had dated, given that none of them expected the man to be
But he wouldn’t dare take it off. For one, he really was cold and needed another layer. JARVIS had told him so, but he thought he could withstand it. He was wrong. Second, it would be rude to take it off moments after Steve had wrapped it around his neck.
“Yeah. But really. Thank you. The school library didn’t have a copy, the bookstore is out of them, and it’s costing over a hundred dollars!”
But on that summer estate, before Steve learned some facts about Tony …
He was keeping it a secret.
“Hey,” he said, smiling brightly. “I went ahead and ordered for you.”
Bucky agreed that Steve had a tendency to do just that, but he never encouraged Steve to stop.
“Should have never let me have a computer,” Tony quipped. He gripped the pipe he was still holding onto. It would be worthless in a gun fight, but it still gave him some measure of comfort.
“I love you,” Tony said after a moment of silence, a hand going up and down Steve’s back in a soothing motion. “You and your rambling about art history and fighting bullies since you were a scrawny stick. You were adorable back then, how someone didn’t snatch you up, I have no clue. I even think I love your aversion to decent technology. Oh, and how you can be such a little troll. How about we just forget about courting rituals and all that?”
A smile broke out over Tony’s face and his eyes shone brightly. He swung Steve up into his arms, practically off his feet, and kissed him. Steve pressed his body to Tony’s, barely holding back a moan, as Tony held onto him close. He pulled away, needing air.
Carol came over, sighing. “I still can’t believe her father is being such a jackass. I mean, how often do you find a literal genius who spends his day taking care of sick people? I know a hundred fathers who would want their daughters—hell, any of their kids—to marry Bruce.”
It was slowly starting to dawn upon all of them. He could see it on all their faces.
“Aww, it’s alright Winghead,” Tony cooed, patting his head. “It’s because we love you.”
“Remind me of the babe,” Tony said before he could stop himself.
Tony considered it. Really considered it.
Tony nodded. “Yeah. I know. Let’s … let’s go.”
And besides, who would have romantic feelings for him?
“Coffee,” he corrected.
Tony pressed his cheek against the top of Peter’s head. “Of course I am. And you will be too.”
Or maybe just make sure to kill him if he tried something funny.
Peter gaped at him, the mask of his suit pulled off of his head.
It was kind of a relief that was his friends’ focus. He was pretty sure he could describe symptoms and other measures of treatment and management, even ramble about the brain chemistry aspects of it if he really had to, but that … they just accepted it was really nice.
Steve let out a small snicker before bursting into a full belly laugh.
“It’s okay, I promise,” Tony said, trying to channel his inner Pepper. “We’ll figure out what is going on. We’re all out here. Between the six of us—”
“Thanks.”
Kind of like what happened every time he came in.
“Thank you!”
“Okay,” Tony said, glad there was a plan in the works. “I’m gonna go check on him.”
Tony grumbled and dragged his hands down his face.
They had given it to him anyways.
Tony sighed. “Okay. If you’re sure. But the moment he crosses a line—
Tony still felt a little anxious about all of this, but … yeah. They were going to be okay.
“J, call Pepper—have all my meetings cleared. This is way more important.”
He would, though. Someday. Really, truly come clean about everything.
Steve tried to send him a smile, but it came out more like a grimace. There was so much that was his fault; so much that could be put at his feet.
“Steve?” he guessed, raising an eyebrow. “Yeah. We grew up in the same neighborhood.”
Sam was already kneading dough, Bucky was chopping up different fruits, and Steve had a clipboard in his hands while he checked through a number of cabinets.
He opened the plastic container and the scent of apples and cinnamon wafted up. It was still a little warm, the thin drizzle not even hardening yet. As he stuck his fork in, the piece of the cake came off easily without crumbling. Further into it, he saw real apple slices in there.
“Yup,” Clint replied, walking further in. “I expect the best reveal faces ever.”
“Sir,” JARVIS said, breaking Tony out of his thoughts, “I would like to remind you that your parent-conference is in half an hour.”
Tony smiled to himself behind his mug of coffee. From time to time, Steve and Bucky got teased about how close they were, but Tony knew it wasn’t anything more than friendship. Those two were like brothers. He got little bits and pieces over the weeks, but figured out that times were hard growing up, in school, and when they did their tours in the Army.
“Sure.”
“What? I do not! How dare you accuse me—”
“So, why a coffee shop? Why not go back to art school?”
He blinked up at her and looked to the monitor again. The screensaver had popped up, something old and cliché from the old Windows systems. Tears started to well in his eyes. He was clearly having a panic attack. Finding out that the father figure in your life sold you to terrorists and wanted you dead warranted a panic attack, right?
“Steve—”
Resin jewelry were used for all sorts of reasons: signs of friendship, good luck, milestones reached in life. Sometimes … sometimes they were used for romantic intents too.
“What brings you here?” Tony asked. “You up for some coffee?”
It would be nice to do some good for once.
He looked up.
“Excuse me? Pardon moi? Entschuldigung? Um … Gabh mo leithscéal?”
get all the cookies.”
So much of this was projection, but—
As the sniper reached down and grabbed the goon’s walkie-talkie, Tony kept his distance as he waked past the body.
“Textbook price gouging should be made illegal.”
“Should I ask?”
“They are real,” Antonius said. “It is just that knowledge of how to make them has not reached these lands yet. But I can make it. I have done it before.”
“What does that mean? Steve is wonderful! You don’t even know the guy.”
That is something he will have to figure out.
Steve blinked, confused. “Tony, you don’t have to tell me. I mean, mine was pretty big—”
“Steve, my precious, my love, I am wou—”
Tony’s words came true when three days later, Steve was turned into a golden retriever.
“They don’t even know how to paint a real person or even a vase of flowers.”
Peter winced, remembering how his dad threatened to bring in their lawyers and probably would have sent weeks ago if Peter didn’t beg him not to.
The thoughts surrounding all this had consumed him for three days, causing him to reschedule meetings, post pone some development projects, and basically cause headaches for everyone around him. Even JARVIS seemed to be a bit annoyed, even though he understood that sometimes Tony had to act like a hermit to get his head back on straight again.
But everything was now replaced with absolute dread. The letter in the inner pocket of his jacket burned against his chest, along with his thudding heart.
First, he was apparently ‘too alpha-like’: too tall, too muscular. His shoulders were too broad. His hands were too large. While people apparently drooled over his hip-to-waist ratio and jawline, it was always at a distance. Anytime someone came closer, they discovered the second reason: he was nothing like any of their fantasies. He was too brash, too opinionated, and too stubborn. He wasn’t meek and he really sucked at being domestic and comforting.
“Ah, Master Rogers,” Jarvis said pleasantly in a fine, upper crust accent. “Please, do come in. Master Stark has been expecting you.”
“Yes, this time. We’d appreciate the help, but you got enough on your plate at the moment. We’ve been working on reversing those policies and are making progress, though it’s slow.”
“Yes, Steve,” Tony said gently, reaching forward and taking Steve’s book from his hands so he could hold them in his properly. “I’ve been trying to hint at this for weeks, but either I was being too subtle or you were being too blind.”
How many times had he been kissed before enlisting in the Army?
“About ten minutes. She was getting a little worried but didn’t want to disrupt class again or make you feel uncomfortable.”
“I’m sure,” he said, sipping the tea despite himself, if just to get rid of the taste of chrysanthemum.
Tony bit his burger with a little more aggression than was probably warranted.
He tried his best to move quietly, but with how empty the hallways were, it felt like even his breath was echoing. They were setting a pace he could keep up with, not that he couldn’t keep up with their typical pace, but they hardly knew that he was training himself to be more than a typical technological giant living off royalties and martinis. While the slower pace was making him nervous, it was allowing him to look around the building some more.
“And then I’ll make my famous hot chocolate,” Pepper continued without missing a beat, leading Peter to the kitchen for the ice. “And we can put your father’s love life on the back burner.”
Did he hit his head? Was that twinge of pain in his shin or elbow? There was a huge clatter of metal, but he hardly paid attention, he had to protect—
He openly made a sound of utter disappointment when he reached the last drop.
Steve felt like his heart was going to jump out of his throat.
The man hastily set down his pot and rushed over towards Antonius. He flinched, closing his eyes, expecting there to be pain from a club or rock—
“W-What?”
“The universe sucks,” Tony declared.
“Whoa,” Steve breathed out.
Steve shook his head. “I already sent in some samples.”
He didn’t want the little touches to end.
It had to have smarted when he found that out, even if only a few people knew.
Tony fixed him with an unamused look. “Come on. Something is going on, so out with it. Is someone teasing you again? Is a teacher being a jerk?”
Peter jumped out of his seat and Tony rushed over, hugging him tightly.
He wasn’t able to stop the accident.
Natasha knew by just looking at him.
“Here you go,” Steve said, bringing Tony back to reality.
“You know I’m not interested in Alpha Night,” he said. “It’s a stupid tradition that doesn’t do anything for anyone. We all know that even if someone got kidnapped, nothing would come of it. Everyone would go back to business as usual.”
“Yeah,” Peter said, still holding onto the book like it was a lifeline. “Thank you again, Mr. Rogers.”
The weather in these lands was harsher. Winds blew hard enough to almost knock him over and his feet had never been so cold before. Buk, despite his strange arm, was able to make him a good pair of leather shoes that prevented mud or water from getting in. Fur left inside added more warmth than a woven stocking. Still, getting up in the morning proved to be difficult, when he was buried under thick blankets of wool and furs.
Tony reached from behind him and snagged some popcorn. “Do we have to watch
Tony froze.
“Who says I haven’t already?” she challenged.
“I didn’t order a cappuccino!” he protested.
“Do you know how expensive art school is these days? And no one likes my style at the moment, so I couldn’t really sell work to support myself during that time. Hence all the experiments.”
The man shoved him into a chair roughly.
Peter nodded. “So, what are you working on?”
“I-It was just a book!” Flash exclaimed. “It’s not like his dad can’t buy him another one!”
Tony made sure to kiss Steve a lot more after that.
That fiend.
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Thompson, please sit down,” the secretary begged. “The principal will be here in a few minutes.”
But this was
That was it.
Steve smiled. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve coughed up just about everyone’s favorite flowers.”
, JARVIS said, not saying that Tony had already asked him to do so. That was nice of him. He wasn’t thinking straight. It was good that someone was. His hands were shaking so badly. He had to stop Stane. He was overreacting. Putting everyone on high alert and moving them out of the country would tip someone off. But he had to protect—
“It’s fine,” he replied. “My place is just a few blocks from here.”
“Oh,” Tony said, a little surprised. “Uh, how did that go? Well, I take it?”
The strange contraption was suddenly turned off, instantly cooling the room a few degrees and leaving silence in its wake.
Tony hadn’t even noticed he finished the first cup, but … yeah. Two hours had gone by. He had gotten a lot done, which was nice, but wow. Time flew right past him. Those were two hours he was never getting back, and looking over his work, he wasn’t sure if they were spent well.
But, on the way to the florist, his rut started to kick in.
Tony considered it for a moment.
Love.
“You made me guess what
Someone … someone said … there was chanting and drums. His ears pounded and his whole body throbbed with pain. He struggled and fought against the ropes that were holding him down, but it was no use. The chanting continued. He didn’t recognize the language. He didn’t know who was doing this to him or why or even
Bucky nodded, no longer teasing. “Yeah. We like Stark a lot better than the last asshole.”
“No, I was going to ask what you needed help with to finish that suit.”
“Well, you’re not a futurist like me, and with everyone always sneezing or coughing up petals for all the types of love there are out there, why
“But seriously, thanks for helping him out. The kid was worrying himself up a wall and wouldn’t tell me about the problem. I mean, it was just a textbook, I could have easily found it—”
help, sometimes,” he said. “If I heard another bohemian rant on about living off of art and beauty, I would’ve punched you.”
Tony silently gasped. He held his breath so he wouldn’t actually gasp or scream like a fangirl, though, could anyone blame him if he did? Captain America was thanking him. He was thanking him for something he specifically did to help with a mission. Oh, god. Take that, dear ol’ dad. Captain America himself was thanking him for his help, not sneering down at him or thinking he was a lesser man with one glance.
Clint saw it and didn’t hesitate to let the exploding arrow fly.
“Yeah, yeah, have fun corralling the little monsters.”
Tony pouted.
He could feel a new flush going up his cheeks and down his neck. Just what he needed.
“So, you hear about the newest Star Wars movie?” Ned asked.
Sam made his cappuccino. Tony paid and headed to a table over by the windows.
“Does he still have his cell phone?” Tony asked.
Tony stared at him for a minute. “Alright, let’s make a break for it.”
“That is what they say a rut is like,” Tony said gently. “We think you’re an alpha.”
Gunshots ricocheted. The sniper returned fire.
A little part of him hoped, but—
“Thanks,” Steve replied, taking the opportunity to throw a handful of Dutch iris petals into his face.
Tony snorted and continued to plug away at numbers for expense reports and other business aspects of the company apparently no one else could do (Pepper confirmed this three times and highlighted what he needed to sign or veto). He knew where this was going. “What babe?”
Or inside jokes that only you might understand.
“I could ask if they cater,” Tony said. “I’m a regular. I bet if I begged enough, they would, just to get me to shut up.”
Tony muttered under his breath.
She gave him a sharp smile. “I’ve been coughing up violets and pansies all week.”
“Report?” Tony asked. “Where are these things coming from?”
“Then I’ll—I’ll make a baby gate version for internet! And the television! Books! You will never see people kissing or even holding hands until you’re forty!”
“I got projects and deadlines,” Tony defended.
“Wait, you love me?” Steve repeated, this new knowledge hitting him like a sack of bricks.
Tony eyed Peter, who was looking over his shoulder every two seconds and was
was going on?
He loved Steve like little else on this planet, but loving Steve also included worrying about his many medical conditions. Tony tried not to press matters or over too much.
Or, well, he hoped, because one never knew what protocols were in other cities and states, or how they handled things in general, because—no, no, he was not going down that road.
Therapy was also helping a lot with those last two things and other negative mindsets.
“I think my side is okay,” he called back.
going to let him escape again. He kissed Steve’s cheek quickly. “Good night.”
The scarf was driving Tony
Steve shrugged a shoulder, but didn’t really look at him.
Steve and Clint caught up a bit more before Clint’s phone pinged. Then pinged three more times.
Steve would have preferred fighting a dragon.
“Like all mental issues, it is hard to pin down why someone has a condition and someone else doesn’t, even in the same household,” one of the professionals said. “It doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with Peter. He just needs to learn different coping skills than say, someone who has dyslexia or someone who is on the autistic spectrum.”
that Captain America was going to say his name.
“And I’m sure something covered in spit is all the rage at weddings,” Bucky added.
No. He and Steve were friends. Just friends.
“Does she think we’re idiots?” a tall black man asked from behind Steve. “I don’t know about you, but I was managing school and a job since before I was an adult.”
“We’ve been working on it,” Tony interjected. “More alarms and notifications on his phone, working on time management skills and organization …”
Could he balance what he needed to do while dating someone?
“Have you gotten into trouble with him before?”
Bucky rolled his eyes and shoved his shoulder lightly. “You already know I love ya dumb mug.”
Tony wanted Steve to kidnap him on Alpha’s Night. He didn’t care if Steve wasn’t able to do it ‘properly’ by getting him into a fireman’s carry or even get down on one knee and propose with an expensive ring after breaking into his house. Tony wanted him to just do something on Alpha’s Night. He wasn’t sure of the exact reasons, but it might have to do with the fact that he saw Steve as an equal and wanted their relationship to start off with that equality.
“Tony,” Pepper sighed. “You are
Tears stinging his eyes, Antonius managed to say ‘thank you’.
“Do we have to go to a doctor now?” Steve asked.
MJ returned to her book, but Peter noticed that her smile was a bit wider.
He was sweating and ready to collapse from the effort it took to get here, and people would surely be whispering about this over their fancy teas, but he
Peter was in school, probably at lunch. The meeting was going to be short—Mr. Rogers had just wanted to check in and go over how the plan they had come up with for him. All in all, the accommodations seemed to be reasonable and required more effort from Peter’s teachers than Peter himself. Being allowed more time on tests, more options for assignments, and being allowed to get up and move around every so often was not what Tony had expected.
“Him and everyone else,” Steve replied. “I’m a walking flower shop.”
Basically the actions
“Yeah, but he’s not picking—”
“No, no, I shouldn’t have gone around a corner like that! You were the one with the paintings!”
“Thanks again, Pepper,” Steve said, looking over the paperwork. “I really appreciate this.”
Thor frowned slightly, tilting his head. “Only gladiola flowers?”
Did he feel the same way? Would he even want to continue dating after this conversation? What was going to happen to them if they did have a falling out?
Peter picked up his screwdriver and fidgeted with it. He wasn’t sure to say.
raise her voice, it was
Pepper encouraged him to drink the water. That helped a lot.
But it would be fine.
He kicked at the ground, holding onto his canvases with two arms protectively. He knew they weren’t the best works in the world and he knew that the Académie thought historical scenes and religious subjects were more important than landscapes, but … But art was supposed to reflect life. It was supposed to capture what the people of that day saw and felt. How could he hope to capture something that no longer existed? Something that was now a forgotten ruin?
Peperi nodded and explained how they went to see the oracle. They initially had wanted to know if the gods would help them fight against Ovadyah, but the oracle insisted it was not their place to do that; justice would come in other ways. There were other peoples, the oracle warned, peoples who would come and take and take. Their island would not be safe. No land would be safe once the empire of the seven hills rose up. Antonius felt sick. There were stories about such peoples, those who made arms for the sole purpose of conquering others.
The rest of their escape did not go as smoothly.
“Hey!”
presentation. Despite what everyone thought, he knew all about the figures, projections, and estimates. He could predict how some of them would go, with minor adjustments.
