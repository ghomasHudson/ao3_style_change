“I don’t. Unless it's about Steve Rogers.” The engineer moved away from the blonde with a convinced smile, leaning his back against his own chair again.
Steve stopped laughing, his serious expression still turned in Tony's direction. He had never discussed his favorite ice cream flavor with anyone.
“I have no reason to.” If Steve had not been busy letting go of the Widow's grip, he would have shrugged.
In retrospect it was hard to believe that they had started with their left foot. At first they could barely stay in the same room for a long time. Nothing that some missions together and split the same tower for some good months would not fix.
“Look, Cap, I know that–“
“Me?”
“You can have a Tony, if you want. But it's a lot of bureaucracy, I don’t think it's worth it.” Tony shrugged, watching the Captain look away for a few seconds, his face slightly tilted to the left. “Hey, your nose is perfect again.”
“Hey, Cap.” Tony's voice was neutral. Steve turned his head, watching as Tony pulled a chair closer to him, sitting up and giving him a lively smile.
So, if anybody asked, he would answer without thinking twice: he really loved his life.
“Clint did
There was only one problem in this whole story.
“Don’t. Smarter people haven’t been able to. No offense.” he really didn’t mean to offend, it was just that Tony knew other genius. Steve didn’t seen offend. “Look, sorry that I reacted so badly. I was having some troubles, but everything is better now. I promise I’m back to normal.”
The brunette settled under the blanket, the engineer's body approaching Steve’s. Rogers felt Stark’s hand reach for his, pulling the blonde’s arm over his own body.
“Was it difficult?” and even if Tony tried to sound ironic, his voice was joyful.
Steve watched as Natasha left him alone again.
way to see things, Rogers.” Rogers. She really was
“I’m sorry, sir, but it’s not possible. Mrs. Potts ordered that every Avenger has full access to your workshop in case you forget about sleeping and eating regularly.”
. Besides the irony of Eddie telling him exactly like he told Tony, it meant that Eddie was in love with someone.
In fact, Steve wasn’t the best Avenger when the subject was making coffee. He always missed the
“It’s okay, Cap” the engineer sighed, telling Steve to get comfortable in his workshop with just a hand gesture. “What happened this time?”
“Yeah, exactly.” Tony waved his hand, feeling really embarrassed. He wished he didn’t leave the coffee and that he wasn’t in the middle of a sidewalk while he was having that conversation, but it was too late. “And yes, I kept talking about you to you. I thought that I could forget about you by starting something with you. I am that pathetic.”
Not that he didn’t like Captain – he did, probably a lot more than he should. The problem was that Steve Rogers was the ideal man, the model citizen, the perfect soldier. He really was everything that Howard had told him during his childhood, and probably even more.
“I’ve always wanted a boy.” Steve's response drew a gigantic smile from Tony.
And Tony always believed.
“Tony.” He felt Steve’s hand on his shoulder by the time he had reached the corner of the block where the coffee was. He wasn’t sure about where he was going, besides far from there. “I think we should talk.”
During the entire meeting he sent messages to Stephan, just so the man was sure he would show up, late, but he would. Also he was making himself sure that he wouldn’t show up on the place just to find an empty table, so the next day Stephan would send him a message telling how much of a jerk he was and that they would never talk again.
‘Sometimes I think I have insomnia’ Steve received a message from Eddie and smiled. He always sent something in the strangest times. But Steve didn’t care, he was happy just to receive anything from the man.
OK, that was ridiculous. Steve
“Steve tried to kiss me.” The phrase made Clint turn 180 degrees in the same spot, staring at Tony wide-eyed. Great. “So. Why did you ask me that? Did Steve tell you anything?”
“Anthony
Tony crossed his arms and leaned against the stand, watching while Steve ignored him and gave attention to the sandwich, giving it an enormous bite. Tony frowned. He didn’t like being ignored, and he would have to stay on the kitchen until his drink was ready and he could bring it all to his workshop, where by the way he had left his phone, which forced him to make small talk with Captain, just so he could do anything to make it feel like time was passing faster.
“I know something is going on. I’ve been watching you guys. You hang out together, don’t fight, laugh together…”
It was not long since Steve had lain down when he felt a movement on the bed. Even with the lights off he could identify the body; he could always identify Tony.
Tony’s reached Steve’s face, touching him carefully. The engineer's thumb drawn a line in the Captain's white skin, running from his nose to his cheek, as if checking that the man's face was completely in place. And even after checking that everything was fine, Tony's hand remained on Steve's face.
“It's the
“I– I don’t–” He didn’t want to stutter because it was pathetic. But Tony was there right in front of him, talking more than Steve could absorb. How could he say anything coherent?
“He’s an idiot, didn’t even buy a ring.” Tony laughed, wiping his own tears away. Steve rolled his eyes, but then he laughed, tweaking Tony better on his lap. “We’re getting married.”
Stephan had told him he was at a table with a jug of blue flowers, the only one with those colors in the entire cafeteria, just to make all the localization thing easier. As soon as Happy dropped him, Tony dismissed him, telling him to go back to Pepper. He grabbed his phone in his pocket and told Stephan he was coming in, letting the man know that he was wearing sunglasses just to reciprocate the flowers thing.
He didn’t need another man for whom he would sigh in the corners, whom he would desperately try to impress and then fail miserably. Or someone for whom he would feed a feeling so strong that sometimes the pain that it provokes would become physical, especially because it was completely platonic. It was enough to feel all those things for Steve Rogers, he didn’t need to feel that for Stephan too.
Steve hadn’t fallen in love many times during his life. Sure, there was Peggy, the closest that he had even been. And maybe, in retrospect, he had had a little crush on Bucky. But them both were seventy years in the past. Now there was Eddie, the person on the other side of the screen, that he had no clue who he was, and even though made Steve fall in love with him. And, of course, was in love with somebody else. Because life was never easy.
He took a deep breath, pondering whether or not he should open up.
Steve studied Tony's expression. The engineer looked worried, of course. Steve knew Tony had always feared becoming like Howard. At the same time, Stark's gaze conveyed excitement. It was obvious that Tony wanted to have a child. And honestly, so did Steve.
Steve’s blue eyes searched the man’s face. Tony’s closed giant eyelashes. The well-trimmed goatee that seemed never to look good on anyone except Tony. His hair, slightly pillow messy. And then Steve smiled.
“How did the event go?”
“I– I'm sorry. I– I better go– Sorry. Thank you.” Steve got up and without even looking back left the workshop.
They ended up marking the date in a small cafeteria next to the Avengers Tower, in which Steve had never been but had heard Tony compliment – and if Tony liked, Steve knew he could trust in the quality, although he was a little worried about the price.
So Steve was the one who took the two remaining steps.
boring, Steve. I hate everybody.”
“Morning.” the bad humor was clear on his voice. Coffee. He needed coffee.
“I try.”
“Yes it is. Just slightly, but it is.” Tony narrowed his eyes, still close to Steve, almost making both noses to touch. “Crooked enough for me to notice.”
“Tony?” Steve’s voice made him stop even before he left the kitchen.
“No. Thank you.” Steve brought the cup to his mouth quickly, his face even more pink than before.
Clint lifted the palm of his right hand, receiving a fast high-five from Natasha.
And even as scared as he was, Steve waited until Tony finally found his table with the jug of blue flowers. He smiled to Tony that seemed to be frozen, looking at his direction. And then he watched as Stark turned his back and left the coffee.
Tony smiled because he was sure that Stephan was smiling too.
” Tony said between clenched teeth. How hard was it to get right to the point?
“My drawing tablet it not working.” Still biting his lip, Steve approached Tony, holding out the black drawing tablet, not much bigger than a common tablet.
“You did wrong.” Tony’s voice was extremely rude, the tone he used every time a ruler insinuated he should give Iron Man’s armor to the State. “I know I didn’t react well to the whole ‘
“And I was thinking it would be hard to convince you to come home with me.” The dirty look Tony gave Steve made him completely red. It was incredible how easy he blushed.
“Rogers-Stark.” Steve corrected, watching Tony wince.
This was how he met Stephan, initially for the user name ssm-70. From all people with who Tony had talked in the site, Stephan was the best by far. He knew when to be funny and when be serious. He seemed to handle Tony complains – usually a lot of them – really well. Tony thought that Stephan was almost perfect, and that’s why it was so good that they didn’t meet in person.
“No.” Steve's voice sounded normal too, even though he could feel his breathing less than normal.
“Someone?”
“It’s crooked.” Tony got closer to the man, examining him carefully.
“Nothing. You can go now.” He waved his hand, like someone saying ‘shoo’, clearly telling Clint to leave his workshop. But, if Clint gave up that easily, he wouldn’t be a super spy.
Tony smiled. The fakest smile he had given in his whole life, forcing his face muscles like he had never did. His chest was hurting so hard that the only possible explanation was a problem with the arc reactor. That was it, he would have to apologize to Steve and get away from there as soon as possible because he just could not. He was not strong enough to just continue standing there.
“No. And even if we were it would be none of your business. Leave my workshop. Now.”
“It was never crooked, Tony.” Steve rolled his eyes, facing the dark-haired man again.
The sun was rising and a light breeze hit the Avengers Tower’s roof. Steve enjoyed to see the sun rise. The colors of the sky seemed even more beautiful and always gave him inspiration. Different from usual, Tony did not have his cell phone or Starkpad.
“Cooling you head? Like this?” Tony pointed to the floor, and all the pink from Steve’s neck reached his face.
“Can you guide me to the village?” he asked Jan.
“I’m bisexual, you ass,” he snaps, grabbing his drink with his left hand and taking a large gulp.
Shit, how had Steve forgotten that?
He feels Tony shifting, uncomfortable. And then his heart drops as Tony shakes his head.
“I know,” smiles Tony. “You fucked me real good, last time.”
The last to arrive are Clint and Bobbi. Clint is Natasha’s best friend, so of course he and his wife Bobbi had been added to Steve and Bucky’s circle. Bobbi is pregnant with their first child, and she looks so tired. Natasha helps her sit while Clint puts his gifts under the Christmas tree.
“Offering? I’m a starving artist,” he jokes, “you’ll have to buy it, mister.”
“Ah, mercy!” cried out Joseph, falling to his knees. “I only did it out of necessity. My only child is dying of sickness, and he was almost healed by your rampion. I thought giving him more would save him.”
Steve stops in front of his door. The muffled voices of his friends can be heard from there, and he holds his index over his lips, smiling. Tony muffles a snicker, and nods silently. Steve opens quietly the door, and slips in, pulling Tony behind him. From the entrance, they can’t see the living-room, nor can they be seen, and Steve hastily drags Tony down the corridor, leading him into his room and shutting the door behind him.
Tony thanked him, and followed as Bucky nudged his pigs. They passed through the village; it was so late that people were already cooped up in their home. Bucky whistled happily as they crossed the empty square. The little church standing by was the cutest Tony had ever seen, and its bell slowly rang, the sound loud and resounding. The pigs didn’t mind one bit, but Dummy shook his long ears in discontent and Tony felt another pull from Butterhooves’ bridle as she slipped again. The poor dears deserved their rest, thought Tony fondly.
Tony blinked heavily, and next thing he knew, he was lying on a bed, his shirt opened, shoes off, and Steve was sitting on his bedside, running a cool wet cloth on his forehead and chest. Steve looked concerned, but quickly hid it behind a stern, frowning face.
“I’m glad you’re here,” he got on. “Thank you, Tony, for giving me another chance, despite what I’ve done.”
Pleas and incoherent words mixed with moans. He might have asked for more. Steve’s other hand trailed down his spine, into the crease of his rear, and then a fingertip pressed there, on Tony’s sensitive and fluttering skin -not breaching in, but there, just enough pressure to make Tony reel with want, the pleasure spiking insanely-. Tony keened and threw his head back, eyes closing, whole body shuddering as he came, thrusting erratically into Steve’s hand, soaking it with white, viscous semen. And while he was shaking all over and crying out Steve’s name, the hand on his rear shot up to get hold of his chin, Steve asking him urgently, his other hand tightening on his weeping penis.
“Tell me why?!” Tony spat, suddenly. “Explain yourself, Rogers. I explained. Your turn. I‘ll never forgive you, but I fuckin’ deserve to know
“Hi! I’m Jan!”
“But it
or something,” smirked Tony.
“Take care of yourself, too,” said Steve, watching him walk away. Tony’s back looked straighter than before. He was a survivor, and even in tatters he would keep going, with that immense strength of will that Steve had admired in him ever since he had seen Iron Man carrying the nuke into that dark, deathly wormhole.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve assured him, and hesitantly reached for his hand, holding it preciously. Tony jerked up, and they stared into each other’s eyes for a long moment, Steve not daring to move anymore.
“Okay. My bad. I’m Steve,” he offers, his tone gentler.
her, Cap. It’s no wonder her mind snapped after what happened to Vision. It’s no wonder we lost them both.”
“Green, green, green, com’on, Steve!”
Steve laughed.
His voice had raised, loud, on the verge of a scream. Tony took hold of his head with his two hands and breathed in, deeply, almost-shivers running through his hunched shoulders. Finally, he gasped out, calmer;
Steve becomes famous thanks to a generous benefactor, celebrates Christmas with his friends, and gets to meet (again) his benefactor...
Tony started, and glanced towards him; as their eyes met, he quickly looked away. Steve sighed.
“Tony I’m sorry, so sorry-”
“Bambi? Ah, yes, the innkeeper, Mrs Arbogast! You’re right about the pig pen… do… do you want me to leave?”
?” frowns Tony, his distrust seemingly swept away.
“You’re a muscles fan?”
“For Heaven’s sake, Butterhooves, be careful! You’re going to hurt yourself one day! Don’t you know what happens when a horse breaks a leg?”
As Steve gives Thor his share, the giant suddenly stares at him. He’s not drunk at all -none of them are, they know better than getting drunk in front of Steve, Pietro, and Wanda-, and there’s a knowing look in his eyes.
“I… I’m sorry, Steve, I’d rather leave. I’m sure your friends are nice, but…”
Tony blinked and obeyed. He had been about to close his eyes again. Steve’s thumb retreated from his mouth and Tony’s tongue followed it out. Steve bent forward, and pressed his forehead against his, blue eyes still watching him intensely, holding Tony’s face with one hand.
“I could care less about that,” lied Tony, whose heart was traitorously beating faster, “I need to get back on track and find the village before the night, or I’ll end up eaten by a three-headed bear or something.”
“I love you,” said easily Steve, and Tony bit his lip in pleasure, both from those three words, and from Steve’s sex slowly entering him, a glorious and intense pressure. “You’re beautiful. The most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. The kindest. The smartest. The one who makes my days shine like the sun, my nights shimmer like the moon. I would carve my heart out before I ever hurt you. I love you, Tony.”
“Yeah,
Tony gave out a long suffering sigh.
“Geez, Steve, you know I don’t mean it in a bad way.”
It doesn’t happen. Tony glances at Steve’s change on the counter and Steve can see acceptance in his eyes, and then Tony’s left arm wraps around Steve’s slender waist, and he guides him out of the bar. Steve presses his shoulder against Tony’s and glances up at him. Tony has a few inches over him, but not too much. For all that he’s skinny, Steve is of average height.
There was not a soul out there in the garden. Joseph stepped carefully around a row of lettuces, ignored the grimacing face of a scarecrow, and reached the patch of rampions. He hastily clutched a handful of one, and promptly fled the garden. The fairy helped him find his way back to the road, and then bid him her best wishes. Thanking her from the bottom of his heart, Joseph returned home.
While the water warmed and Steve was putting mugs on the table, Tony observed the fire a little while longer, but the little figure didn’t reappear.
Most Gorgeous gapes at him for a few seconds, looking taken aback, and then he frowns and straightens up defensively.
“Or maybe you’re such a good, good bitch, that you just crave a cock inside your ass. I’ll give it to you, then. A good pounding.”
“Visited her yesterday. Today I was looking for you, and you only.”
“Hey, I’m not judging. I don’t drink either.”
“There. You’re drooling, it’s gross. Eat something. Preferably not me.”
Later, sitting on his apron and struggling to lace up his bodice, Tony complained that he was too sensitive and sore. Steve snorted at him and started digging into the basket.
Tony blinked, ripping his eyes from the heart-warming view of Steve’s long and delicate fingers wrapped around his arm.
“Tony, I couldn’t help it! You have no idea-”
“You mean that when my wish is granted, I won’t see you anymore?”
I’m not a
“You don’t need to. It’s Christmas. I wanted to give it to you,” insists Steve. “I can’t keep it, anyway. Unless you want to risk someone stumbling over it?”
“You don’t drink alcohol?” prods Steve.
For all that Tony loves to boast and talk miles about his inventions, he’s never been one to talk about his deeper feelings. Steve can sense there is so much more Tony is holding back about Afghanistan, can see it in the tension in his shoulders, the slight tremble of his lips, his far-away look, the tap-tap-tap of his fingers against his chest. Steve wishes Tony could confide in him, but he knows this, this conversation they have, is already a gift, that Tony is never that chatty. A few years ago, Steve heard Bruce complain that Tony had talked his ears off about his problems and his disastrous run with the Mandarin. He remembers feeling angry and jealous, wishing that Tony would have chosen to trust him instead, and thinking that he would have treated Tony’s confidences better.
Tony crossed the glade in a stupor, zigzagging like a drunk man, until he reached Dummy. His mule, sensing his turmoil, muzzled his face. Tony hugged his big plushy neck and wept, burying his face in the fluffy fur. He stood there sobbing for a long time, feeling the delicate lips of Dummy nibbling his clothes and hair in an attempt to cheer up his master.
“It’s not our fault, what happened to her, to Vision…”
Steve doesn’t know how to feel about that.
“How dare you come into my garden and steal my precious rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!”
“Bucky. You’ looking for the inn? It’s next to the pig pen, you can follow me there.”
Steve kisses him again, a chaste peck. Then he dresses up in his pajamas and heads out for the living-room. He had been dreading the reaction of his friends, but now that he’s in the corridor, he can hear loud blaster noises and a resounding fanfare, and guesses that they’re watching Star Wars.
Steve embraces him and kisses him back, and lowers him gently unto the mattress.
Steve had wanted to make him look like someone loved. And maybe he had taken too much liberties, because the Tony on the drawing looks like he’s watching his lover with deep affection after a night of passionate lovemaking, but…
Steve clutched him back, steadying them both, and asked, firmly;
Steve is in his Captain-mode, and there’s no stopping him. He reaches up, hands gently taking hold on Tony’s arms, and he looks straight into his eyes. Tony looks like he's skipping a breath.
“Look at me, Tony.”
“Maybe you should rest a little, if you caught a cold.”
“I mean it” he breathes in the shell of Steve’s ear, and Steve shivers, “I’m interested in you. I like people like spitfire, and that’s exactly what you are. Also, I want to see those eyes of yours in full light.”
“That drawing was pure porn before I fixed it,” confesses Steve. “I thought you deserved better than porn, so I changed it into a nude. I… I had no idea it would make you change your mind about
“Hey, it’s just me!” said Jan, as she flew before his face. Her whole body was emitting a warm golden light, and as always, she was smiling.
A hand let go of his shoulder, creeping to his front and unclasping his cloak, and the werewolf threw the bright hot red and golden cloth aside. Tony watched it flutter away and slump next to the basket.
Religion would say it was a perversion, but Tony had never been very religious himself, so that wasn’t it. He couldn’t remember anyone talking to him about men who liked men, and yet, he immediately thought of those men as
“Stop it!” growls Steve. “He’s here, leave him alone. We’re gonna sleep.”
“What?!
“Schmidt is a sorcerer, Tony. He comes here to replenish his magic, but most of the time he’s at the city and he can be away and travel for weeks. Of course he’s gonna disguise himself. His magic makes it easy to do so, to put on the illusion of a human face.”
“I’m Bambi Arbogast,” said the woman. “Come here, son, let’s have you sign the register.”
it with my own two eyes! I’ve
His usually piercing and azure eyes glazed over with unshed tears, Steve anchored his braid to the hook by the window, and didn’t try holding him back anymore.
“I think you know better than most,” he said, gently, “that those who are different and in smaller numbers, are considered as abnormal. But it doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with them.”
“You go, Steve! Having Tony Stark looking for your paintings! You’re gonna get famous in the blink of an eye!”
The werewolf licked its chops again, and, after seemingly having taken the time to think, it said, all-honey like -though its voice, deep and dark, was nothing but sweet-:
Tony tilts his head on the side and his smile goes softer, more genuine.
Steve smiled and thanked him, and Tony left.
“Begone, beast!”
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me!”
And Steve had no answer. No excuse.
There’s Maria, too. She’s a cop, and she lives in the same building than Steve and Bucky, and they can’t quite remember how they ended up being friends, but they are, and she looks very funny dressed up in a silly Christmas pullover while still looking stern and strict. She has a headband with reindeer antlers stuck in her short dark hair.
“But why don’t you… I dunno, you could cut off your hair, tie it up here and use it as a rope to get down the tower… and flee. Why do you stay here?” asked Tony.
me as
“You’re limping,” notes Nat, eyes narrowing.
Bucky sighs, recognizing one of Steve’s ‘Fight Me’ moments. Steve doesn’t feel like he is being overly stubborn or ridiculous, though. It really feels wrong to call Tony a slut.
But then the singing started again, and Jan and Butterhooves stared at him from under their long eyelashes, and that was that. Now Jan was leading joyfully, zigzagging along the scary tortuous trees, and Dummy and Butterhooves were trotting happily behind her, while Tony was reciting alchemical formulas to keep himself calm.
“Please don’t tell them,” begs Steve.
The werewolf -now a tall, deliciously naked and muscular blond-haired man with fair skin and overly large shoulders- easily caught the pot before it hit him in the face, and pounced back on Tony, the two males rolling in the wild grass, Tony trying to push him off but the man being much too heavy for him;
No sooner had he set foot on the ground that the little fairy jumped him.
in his voice, so much force, as if Steve was finally seeing the
After a week of being fed the magical rampions, the child finally overcame his illness. Sarah and Joseph barely had the time to celebrate, that the sorcerer appeared at their doorstep, and took away their child with him.
The pet names are ridiculous, but Tony’s voice is almost a sob. Steve forces himself to slow down, to take back some self-control, because rough sex isn’t something he does. He pulls out, moves Tony -and Tony is like putty in his hands, body lax and sweaty, allowing him to move him however he wants- until he has him laying back on his side. Tony’s watching him under half-closed lids, his hands reaching for the pillow, fingers curling into the fabric. Steve hooks one of his legs around his waist, and resumes fucking him, hoping the angle will be right ; it isn’t, not at once, so Tony rotates his hips a little until Steve presses against his prostate with each thrust. Moaning, Tony turns his head  into the pillow, though he can’t hide his face in it anymore. Steve has one arm wrapped against Tony’s bent leg, and with his free hand, he starts jerking him off.
“And I don’t get why they call it ‘civil’ either. The Accords weren’t an national initiative, it was an international one.”
Ms Potts rolls her eyes, nods in salutation to them all, and disappears in the crowd. And then Jan claps excitedly.
“What is he? Another of the Red Skull’s spells?”
“He looks like a living red skull,” said Tony with disgust, and Jan smothered a giggle in her hands.
“That’s cute, Rogers, but I’m retiring, and before you say anything, I really am retiring because I am not getting any younger, and I’m just really, really worn out, and so, no, I don’t think I’ll be much around here to play bestie with you.”
“Can I?”
And Tony could only nod.
“Let’s go,” rasps Tony, sliding off his tool and reaching into his inner pocket for his purse. He throws a few bills on the counter. It probably covers Steve’s drink, but Steve still stubbornly takes out a few coins to pay his own.
Tony calls him later in the morning, and says yes to the date, and Steve dances and whoops all over the living-room until Bucky, who was washing the dishes, gets fed up with it and throws the wet soapy sponge on the back of his neck. It soon turns into an intense battle that leaves soap everywhere, but they don’t mind, for it has been such a long time since the both of them were so happy.
With a howl, the wolf took chase, its paws loudly thumping on the ground. Tony ran as fast as he could, but as he was reaching a glade, the beast caught up with him in what felt like a heartbeat or two, and suddenly Tony was thrown head-first in a patch of tall grass, his breath momentarily cut from the shock, the basket knocked off his arms and rolling into the weeds. The werewolf  was heavy on his back, its breath loud by Tony’s ear. The beast whined -and Tony felt him change-.
“But that’s weird. I mean, your singing is beautiful, but how do you do that?”
“Yeah. Butt orgasm. You don’t have those?”
understand, is why you hit me with so much hatred?!”
, his sex still erect despite the orgasm he just went through.
Steve had thought they would talk the whole Civil War fiasco out after everything had settled down, and again, he had been mistaken. Tony didn’t want to talk to him, didn’t even want to have to face him, and now…
Steve smiled wider.
“Okay,” he says against Tony’s lips. “I don’t mind outdated, but I’d like to hear more. Preferably somewhere else. Preferably in a nice, big bed.”
“Well?” snapped Tony, throwing him an annoyed glare, thus finally looking at him in the face.
“Golden lacy underwear, really, Tony?”
This was Steve looking at him with desire, this was Tony surrendering his pleasure to him. This wasn’t a barter of sexual favors, it was the joining of their wants. It was Steve holding him through his fall from the edge, it was Steve valuing Tony’s pleasure over his own, it was Tony being entranced not by the hand, but by the person who the hand belonged to.
And so Tony gathered his courage.
“I’m a -ah!- futurist,” gasped Tony as butter-sleeked fingers prodded his hole.
“Well, how about that,” purred the werewolf. “You aren’t a young lady after all. Who would’ve guessed, a man hiding under a skirt,” and, spreading Tony’s knees apart, the werewolf dived in, mouthing Tony’s clothed groin. Tony cursed and bucked up right into the werewolf’s face, who retaliated by untying his underwear with his teeth and licking his hardening sex. Tony shivered. He didn’t really know what to do with his hands anymore, and didn’t feel like fighting much anyway, so he closed his eyes and threw his head back, fingers digging into the soil, as the werewolf took him into his mouth and started sucking. The burning arousal in his guts morphed into spiking pleasure, and Tony moaned. The werewolf didn’t stop until he had him gasping in pleasure and emptying himself down his throat, and as Tony laid there, panting and drowsy with the afterglow, the wolf-man snickered, reaching for the pot of butter.
“Did Tony go look for Steve?” the second question was asked by Natasha.
He could still hear the man’s countless apologies as he walked away after a few seconds that Steve remained completely static and did not kiss back. In Steve’s defense, they were in the SHIELD meeting room after an extended debriefing about a really complicated mission that had almost seriously injured Steve. His mind was so focused on going to his apartment, taking a long, hot bath and lying in his comfortable bed that Steve had not managed to process the kiss quick enough.
“I love you, Tony.”
Tony really wanted the date to happen as soon as possible, but he was, in fact, a really busy man. Between the Avengers and Stark Industries, the date would happen just in the weekend.
“You are awesome.” Steve started to laugh, watching Tony’s smile.
“I brought you dinner. You didn’t show up at the kitchen so…” looking shy Steve approached Tony, putting a small canister near him.
“Tony!” Steve’s brows furrowed, his voice indignant. “I would never joke about it. I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with y–”
Tony couldn’t tell what had bothered him the most, if it was the calm and yet a bit provocative way that Steve’s words had sounded of if it was that little and so… Perfect smile. So he just rolled his eyes and looked at the coffee machine again.
So Tony turned around and left the cafeteria.
“Aren’t you going to tell him?” She tilted her head slightly to the left, swerving perfectly from the punch Steve had thrown toward her, turning to grasp the man's arm.
“How don’t you...” Natasha looked at him as if she really thought he was an idiot. She cut her own phrase at middle, breathing deeply and closing her eyes, seeming to beg patience from heavens. Steve would do the same if he were in her place. She opened her eyes, the determination so strong in her gaze that Steve could swear she would convince anyone that wasabi was not that strong. “You need to talk to him, Steve.”
“Steve?” he finally entered the room, closing the door behind him and diverting from a projectile that flew towards him. Steve stopped the moment he heard Tony’s voice, almost being hit in the face, but dodging at the last minute.
“What is it, then? Are you insecure? Does she have a boyfriend? Is she married?”
“Same about you, Eddie.” Steve rolled his eyes.
you to kiss me.”
“It doesn’t matter anymore.” Tony shrugged. It was true, it didn’t matter. He was going to meet Stephan and forget Steve. Everything would be alright. “And I’ve always been a jerk, when did I lose this title and made you think this is a recent thing?”
“Oh it doesn’t?” Steve ran his thumb over Tony’s cheek, chuckling as the man grimaced.
“I want to know what’s going on between you and Steve. I told you that already.”
Again, he didn’t need another Captain America in his life.
Clint glanced back at Tony, his mouth still working on chewing his snack. For a few minutes he seemed really lost. The engineer could not blame him, since the question had been asked weeks ago.
Now who took a long time to answer was Stephan. Tony walked in circles inside his workshop, the StarkPhone in his hands. He could not focus on anything until he had Stephan’s answer. And even though he understood that the man probably needed some time to digest the invitation, he still wanted to send more messages, begging him to answer faster. Cross the cell phone screen, shout for Stephan to send the damn answer, so they could mark a date and–
“Yeah, exactly, GROSS!” says Pietro.
“I… wasn’t in a good place,” finally admitted Steve. “Ever since I woke up in this century, I… something inside me had died. I had… I felt as if something was missing. As if there was no fire in my heart anymore, as if I was still frozen in the ice.”
… was painful. It was a wound that would never heal, he knew that, and he knew it was the same for Tony. But he needed to ask. “How about Wanda? Why would you treat her like a criminal like that, putting her on house arrest ? You knew Lagos was an accident.”
“Come sit with me, let’s eat.”
“No.”
Also, about Toro, if you don't know him, he's the partner of the original Human Torch, and both of them were part of the Invaders (Cap's team during WWII).
Stark shrugged, the movement carefully smooth, and returned to looking out the car window at the passing scenery. There was a muscle ticking in his jaw, a giveaway that he was feeling anything other than indifference. Or it could be him trying to conceal the pain Steve knew he was in. It had been a week ago but Steve knew where every one of the hurts were spread across Ton—across Stark’s body. After all, he was the one to have put them there.
And Certainty Three was going to be fully investigated for revision.
He didn’t know what he was expecting to see when he saw Tony again, but the engineer looked
When they got to the square, their first stop was the booth set up with homemade breads and local honey. The owner was a serene-looking old man wearing well-worn jeans and a light button down flannel. He turned to Tony. “Hi there, son. You and your son camping around here? I haven’t seen you around and we get a lot of campers and hikers this time of year.”
Tony’s face turned positively livid. For a second. Steve thought, hoped even, that Tony was going to hit him, but instead he clenched his fists to his sides and stepped back onto the balls of his feet. His eyes remained locked on Steve’s. “You lost the right to ask that,” he spat out in a chillingly soft tone, making the soldier flinch.
“So what is on your mind, Steve? Do you need new armor? Shuri is itching to make you a new one.”
He hadn’t exactly expected to be welcomed with open arms, but he wasn’t prepared for Spider-Man to be there, let alone pelt him with- what were those, taser webs? He could take a wild guess as to who had designed those. Oh, Tony. Watching him fall to the ground when he saw Steve was heartbreaking. He used to be the person who
He felt the taller man’s smile against his cheek, as he pulled him closer “Good. That’s wonderful. Although, I suppose— I suppose you may call me Antaine.”
“I will, platypus. Don’t worry. Even if I don’t, my gal Friday certainly will, as we all know.”
“Tones? Everything okay?”
“Hey, you want to scowl any harder there, Cap?” Natasha laughed, amused which earned her the trademark Captain America glare. Steve ignored her and continued staring across the room, blue eyes fixated on the pair of men who were currently deep in conversation.
Once in his room, Tony stepped out into the balcony to enjoy the mountain view. He took out his phone and dialed Pepper. It rang twice before she picked up. “Hey— “ “Tony Stark! A letter? You leave out of nowhere and all I get is a letter?! What is going on with you?” Tony sighed. He wanted to tell her in person but didn’t want her to think he was having some crisis.
We have cute Irondad fluff, but get ready for some angst! A lot of protective Rhodey here :)
“You were foolish to come out here, sunshine.” Sunshine? He noticed Steve’s questioning look. “Your hair… it is like the color of the early morning sun, no?” Steve felt his cheeks warm. “But yes, quite foolish. Other fae might not have been so lenient.”
Steve didn’t miss the slight snarl. He hadn’t even thought about mentioning Bucky. And Tony knew their location all this time? He could have had them arrested at any time, but he didn’t… When had this all gone to hell?
The broken expression on his former lover’s face reflected the torment in his heart, but he couldn’t give in. He needed to heal. They both needed to heal. And maybe they would never truly mend, but their family of misfits would help patch up the wounds. Now, he also had Peter, the stubborn, overly energetic, impossibly pure and kind-hearted kid from Queens. And that was enough.
The billionaire gave him a questioning look, before nodding. “Sure thing, Cap. Let me introduce you two first.”  He turned to Green Eyes and placed his hand on the man’s back. Steve clenched his fists. “Dean, this is Steve Rogers, but you know that of course.”
Tony rolled his eyes, behind his mask, but shrugged and retracted it, revealing his face.
“That’s Honey Bear Iron Dummy, to you, thank you very much,” Tony grinned. “Thank you for always coming to save my ass.”
“Rogers?!”
Tony was about to interject that Peter wasn’t his son, but decided to go with it. If they wanted to be inconspicuous, this seemed like a good cover. “We’re actually here for the summer. This squirt has always wanted to see the mountains and I figured what better way than to explore them for more than just a few days.”
Steve looked to Tony, silently hoping he’d ask him to stay. But of course, he wasn’t so lucky. Beautiful, sad brown eyes looked directly into his for a moment. “You heard him. Just… leave.” God, Steve wanted to reach out and touch him, but he knew he’d be on the ground before he even tried to move his way.
Steve Rogers.
“Yes. Entirely. So much, Èamon.”
“I don’t want us to be like this, worse than strangers. I know I hurt you- I know I broke your trust, but can we just try to be
home— a place you should understand no circumstance ever disturb. And here was Steve, using its trunk as a seat. Yupp, he was dead. He’d never be seen again and Bucky would write “here lies an idiot punk” on his tombstone.
Peter was in the kitchen making lunch, when Tony returned to the barn. He smiled brightly when he spotted the billionaire. “Is everything okay. Mr. Stark?”
And just like that, some of the tension left Tony’s body. He called Peter into the kitchen to join them for dinner and they ended up on the couch with a giant bowl of popcorn after deciding on a movie. Rhodey looked between them, amused that the kid kept a running commentary. Apparently, Tony had met his match.
“Thank you for everything,” he bowed. “Sorry, again for disturbing your home.” The fairy waved him off and Steve turned to leave, but hesitated. “What is it?”
“You’re doing what?!” Rhodey reacted just about the way Tony expected. “It’s temporary, Rhodey-bear. I think it’s the best option. I even planned it out. You should be proud of me!” His best friend glared, unamused. “Tones, I’m glad you’re taking a break from all this. Man, I know you need it, but is being a hermit really necessary?” Hermit was an exaggeration, the engineer thought. He wasn’t exactly going to hide away alone forever.
. The surprise was evident on Steve’s face. “You go back to the others. We’ll all be back soon enough. And when that happens, we just take it one day at a time.”
Next thing he knew, the boy had launched himself at him, enveloping him in a tight hug. Tony allowed it, and even found himself hugging back. Huh. Maybe he didn’t mind this hugging thing.
Steve stepper closer, against his better judgement. But the creature was allowing him to leave. He couldn’t very well be ungrateful. He could feel warmth radiating from him, wrapping him in delicious blanket of calm and joy. The fairy took his wrist, tracing swirls of magic to form what looked like a circle with an upside down triangle, the inside glowing a light blue. His touched lingered only a moment and then the spell was over. Why did the thought make him feel sad? “There sun— what might I call you? I think I deserve to know your name, seeing as you are now under my protection. Don’t worry about the mark, it will only be visible to fae.”
But Tony didn’t scream, didn’t punch him, didn’t even summon the suit. He studied Steve’s face for a few moments, head tilted slightly, eyes boring into his. And then finally, “Come to finish what you started in Siberia?” He asked quietly. Oh god, had he really thought Steve was going to kill him those months ago? It made Steve’s insides thoroughly ache. “Tony, no. God, you have to know that I—“
The boy’s eyes were misty and Tony couldn’t argue that his own were dry. He didn’t know what to say. Normally, he was the uncaring playboy, at least according to the media, and that was usually people’s first impression. They always assumed the worst, without really getting to know him, not that he opened up easily. Still, people seemed to come to the conclusion that he wasn’t worth the trouble.
Sorry if you were expecting a Steve/Tony reunion. I love happy fix-it fics, but I just felt that a lot of those are unrealistic because they both need time to sort themselves out. This was therapeutic for me and thank you to everyone who stayed on this journey with me! :D
Sorry I haven't updated lately... It's been a couple of crazy weeks, but thank you for sticking with me! I'm already working on the next chapter. Our boys will have to meet again at some point, right? As always, please leave comments, kudos! I appreciate you guys so much!
When Peter seemed to relax a bit, he finally thought about Steve. “Uh, where is Rogers, but the way? You didn’t kill him, did ya?”
Dean going to your lab?”
“Pep, I was going to tell you, but I know how busy you are with SI and this was a sudden decision,” he explained. Pepper waited. “Look, I needed to get away from everything- after the fight, I was in a dark place. Dealing with the Accords shit every day was just a reminder of everything…” he trailed off, hoping Pepper would have mercy.
“My, my, sunshine why are you not partaking in the festivities?”
“I would never! Just because I left you that one time… But he’s outside trying out some upgrades I made to his suit.”
It was summer, but the water in the mountains was perpetually cool. It pricked his skin, only momentarily, not enough to burn. Just enough to make him feel alive. He reveled in the feeling, body moving with the water. He pressed on the reactor, the nanites only covering his body from the chest up, allowing him to see and breathe underwater. He swam to the bottom and found a rock to wrap his legs around, anchoring him. It was…nice. Like he’d entered another world, where he didn’t have to worry about Steve Rogers, the Accords, or more alien attacks.
“Goodbye Steve Rogers.”
“It’s fine, kid. She only followed my orders. I’m glad you were there, too… Well, let’s get on with it, as they say.”
Angst ahead for our boys!
“Is that right?” The genius was not going to make this easy for him.
“Can we talk some more Tony? Please. I—I don’t even know how to start, but I want to fix this… fix us. Just give me a chance.
She let out a small breath. “Tony, god knows you need a break, more than anyone,” she said gently. “You have every right to get away. I was just worried about you. If I ever see Steve Rogers again, I will kill him.” Tony chuckled. He believed it. “I don’t doubt it, Pep. You could take him,” he said. “But seriously, thank you for worrying. I’m okay, really! I’m breathing the fresh air of the mountains and even brought the Spider kid along. Can you believe it? Me, a mentor?”
Peter’s eyes narrowed and his lips almost formed a pout. “Fine,” he huffed, “You’re ruthless!”
“Mister Rhodes is on his way here.”
, like you. As in I want to take you on a date, hug you and breathe you in, knowing that no matter what expensive cologne you use, you’ll always carry the slight smell of motor oil, kiss you to shut you up sometimes, and—.”
Steve
The two faced the dark mountains and waited. They didn’t have to wait too long; however, moments later, a dark figure emerged from the trees. Tony froze. He knew that outline all too well.
He had been searching the mountains for close to two weeks when he stumbled upon Tony and the other guy- well, kid. He sounded far too young. He saw the fire from a far distance, thanks to his enhanced eyes and decided to go towards it, something in his gut pushing him along. When he was close enough to hear voices, there was no mistaken Tony’s. He ran. For being known as a brilliant strategist, he sure hadn’t lived up to it just then. He didn’t know what he was going to say, only that he had to see Tony. Somehow, he didn’t think, “Hey, Tony, sorry about Siberia…Nice night we’re having” was going to cut it.
“It’s Spider-MAN,” Peter retorted, “Mr. Stark, sir, and no green smoothies for me, thanks.”
Peter called out through the window. “Hey, uh, Mister Stark, what’s instant kill mode?!"
Peter blushed. “Uh, well, that little boy was me,” he explained. “I wanted to be like you… I still do. I never thought I’d ever actually end up here. But you’re here. You’re actually here and you’re so caring, generous, and— and you made me this sick suit. It all feels so surreal.”
“Kid, go upstairs. I’ll be okay, I promise,” he directed at Peter. The boy looked at him with disbelief. “Mister Stark, I don’t think that’s—
He licked his lips and continued, “Don’t tell the others, yeah? I don’t want anything to mess this all up before it’s all put in place.”
His best friend did not look convinced in the slightest. “Maybe you should come back with me, Tones…”
“Goodbye Èamon.”
“Traitor,” Tony muttered, without any heat. Rhodey did seem slightly appeased, though. “Glad to know you’ve got someone taking care of you, Iron Dummy.”
“Too bad because I have backup, this time,” Tony continued, pointing to the boy who was standing at his side, almost as if he were ready to catch the other man, should he fall. “And unfortunately for you, Rhodey’s on his way, so I’m afraid you can’t kill me today.” His eyes were ice and steel. He almost preferred the frozen block he’d been encased in. “But you must know, surely, you must know that I was pulling my punches back there, in the bunker. You, on the other hand? Tell me, was it some kind of sick rush?” Tony’s words were glazed in venom, but he knew when Tony was hurt.  He was hurt. That was it, but Steve could fix it, he
While Peter ran in to retrieve it, Tony took out his glasses and surveyed the area. “Friday, show me heat signatures.” He scanned for a few seconds, seeing only nocturne animals roaming between the trees. Suddenly, he picked up a human, a large one at that. And it was getting closer, fast.
Tony was tired. He would gladly take death over this, he thought. God, that’s morbid, but it is what it is.  The fight with Steve took what little he had left. At least if he had died in Siberia, he wouldn’t have to deal with this hollowness and immense desperation, yet alarming apathy. He lost part of his team, his family. He had already lost Pepper. He was a damn futurist, wasn’t he? But what good does that do if you have no future?
He got out of bed, shuffled to the bathroom, and glanced at himself in the mirror. His skin was clammy and pale, his eyes weary, and his body felt so heavy. He looked like hell. The splash of cold water didn’t help much, but it grounded him in a comforting way. He could still feel.
specialty to break people.” Steve knew that was aimed at him— that it was meant to hurt him, but knowing didn’t soften the blow.
Steve nodded and greeted the two women, as well. “Do you mind if we speak alone for a minute?”
“Take me to him.”
“You’re incorrigible, Rogers!” He thew his head back and laughed. “If you must know, he has a beautiful ’67 Impala and we were going to see what gadgets we could deck her out with.”
“Oh yeah. Kid was trying to fight the damn thing with his own costume repulsers; he had guts,” Tony chuckled. “Wait, how do you know?”
Silent tears were now flowing both of their faces, as if trying to dry out the pain invading their bodies.
“So what, I can only have one attractive blonde friend? Is that it?” Tony looked at him, eyes glinting as if daring him.
After lunch, they stepped down to the lab because Tony wanted to discuss upgrades to Peter’s suit. “I’ve designed up to 576 web shooter combinations,” Tony explained. Peter’s mouth fell open. Tony grinned. “You’ll have to practice every day to get the hang of them. Karen can give you a crash course.”
Steve almost laughed, out of habit. The man reminded him of Tony, with his crass remark. That only angered him more. He was about to tell Dean just exactly what he could do with shield, but stopped at Tony’s icy glare.
A wave of red light bloomed in a dome from the kid, washing over everything on the streets and over Tony’s hovering form in the air. Tony’s filters couldn’t keep the light out and by the time he managed to blink away the spots in his vision, the kid was gone.
At his name, Tony came, body clenching and squeezing around Steve. Steve gasped and thrust once, twice into Tony and then came. He dropped heavily back into the chair and let Tony settle his weight on him, grounding him. Tony was breathing hard, his chest rising and falling rapidly under Steve’s palm. The beating of Tony’s heart soothed Steve and he used that to drag himself away from the post-coital fog blanketing his brain.
And Tony’s erection was perking up again. “How can you be sure it’s not the bullshit very unscientific sex whammy talking?” he asked, just to be extra sure. God, he wanted to be sure. He wanted it to be real. He wanted
“You get better every day, Wanda," Vision says with indulgence in every word, "and you sell yourself rather short. If I were to make an analogy, I would say that you are already a butterfly, merely beginning to stretch your wings.”
And Tony broke into a fit of laughter again, choking slightly on the tickling in his throat and doubling over at the pain in his stomach. He swiped at his cheeks with his palm and tried once again to control himself. When he was no longer gasping for breath he turned around and studied Steve’s face, now lit by the dim light from the corridor.
. He buried his head under the little pillow of the cot and brought himself under control by sheer force of will.
“I thought Howard’s son would know my face but—“
“Not a psychopath,” Stark replied, conversational, his fingers tight around Steve’s arm. “Unwilling to be trapped in your little Matrix world for your amusement.”
Tony was still in the armor, the new one. It was sleek and organic, like nothing Steve had seen before, and he hadn’t had time to admire it in action as he usually did. It had always been Tony who’d been eager to tell Steve all about the ‘newest doohickeys’. Tony didn’t do that anymore.
“What?” Tony said at the same time.
Tony heaved himself to his feet and whipped around in search of the source of the voice but he was still alone in the lab. He looked back down at his chest, where there was a faint pulse of warmth. “That you there, rock?”
Ah. Good, cold beer, and time with the best friend. Things are looking up.
prudish. I have to say, I like it when you’re not prudish. I
"I know the truth about Zemo," he said. "His plans to fracture your Avengers. The framed bombing. The video of the Stark's death. The Winter Soldier program. All of it." He tucked his helmet under an arm and spread his other arm wide, claws retracted in a show of peace. "As of now, I only wish to help you."
“Bro code didn’t exist back in the 40s.”
“We found it,” Fury said simply. “Picked up Howards old search missions and went from there. We only found it a few days ago, and only the shield.”
“Very true,” Thor says, “though I wished my father would have shared his wisdom of war with my brother as he did with me.”
Trust Steve to barge right through Tony’s bullshit to hit the nail dead center on the head at a time like this. In times of crisis, Captain America pulled through. You could always rely on Captain America to come up with a winning strategy at the last minute. And Tony had walked himself right into the problem, so he couldn't even claim he was ambushed. He must have missed the moment Steve had gone into ‘mission mode’ with him because
Steve leaned in, letting the light catch the sharp lines of his brows and cheek, his nose. His curled lips as he smiled at the agent. “Last. Chance.”
Tony chuckled at the old joke. “He got it from a strange fellow on one of his hunting trips,” he said. “The strange fellow gave him the most fascinating quiver I have ever laid eyes on.” Tony accepted the cards from Steve then started flipping the cards to their right side. What was Steve doing to them? “When attached to Barton’s belt, he could just reach down, turn the plate, and the desired arrow would rotate into place and pop out on top for taking.”
Tony stood slowly and thought over what had just transpired. Steve was his friend. Steve was his good friend. Steve was probably his best friend in this town and the only person besides Bruce to whom he would trust with his life. Tony did not need more that what he already had. And what he had with Steve now, he would always treasure.
"I'm not gonna kill him if that's what you're asking," Stark replied.
It was in the way Tony opened his armor for Steve’s hands, the panels sliding away in hexagons of vibrant reds and golds to reveal a lithe body beneath; the way Steve could find the exact places on Tony he could rest his hands, and the way Tony pressed himself into the touch, offering without a second thought.
A flash of hurt crossed Tony’s face but it was gone in a beat, hidden behind his smile again.
Steve sighed. Right. That. “I was hoping we could have taken it further. Worked on it. Worked on us.”
Steve studied his glove again, checking for bloody residues. “Last chance.”
“Com...mander.”
“You didn't come find me, you ass.” Tony slapped a hand hard on Steve’s hip. Steve jumped but held on tighter with a startled laugh. “So Fury lied to me? Again?” Tony couldn’t even bring himself to be angry at Clint and Natasha anymore. "Lying liars."
Tony stopped pacing and glared at Bruce with a levelled finger. “We’re going to the helicarrier. You’re my eye witness. We’re going to get answers.” He ignored Bruce’s protest, went to pick up Steve’s shield, and marched out towards the elevator for the hanger and a Quinjet.
He left the shower in simple cotton pants and shirt, taking his place at his primary workstation. Biology wasn't his area of expertise but he knew enough to conduct these experiments.
There was one man he was constantly near, one man who filled gorgeous bespoke suits in ways that made Steve forget his own name, one man who could make Steve's heart beat too fast just by fingering the pearly buttons of a Zegna waistcoat. One man who loved spending his time in t-shirts or loose hoodies or tight-fitting tank tops or – not that Steve could complain too much – sleek red-and-gold metal.
It was in the way Tony let Steve thumb the vulnerable inside of his wrist, in the way he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, fire and determination leading his lips, offering himself by giving and giving; the way Steve took and took, letting his mouth be mapped and stroked until the heat broke through the numbness and he pushed back, violent and sharp.
“Tony,” Steve said, his voice sounding far-away. “What is it doing to you? Let it go. Let it—“
And when Tony was close, when his gasps became higher pitched and his nails scratched sharply into Steve's scalp, Steve finally undid Tony's pants to watch his reddened cock stand erect around the folds of charcoal wool, leaking precome almost nonstop. It was a beautiful sight and Steve only wished he could preserve it forever. With a firm grip, he started pulling the black silken tie off of Tony's cock, letting it slide along the entire length, eased by its smoothness and Tony's precome. It caught on the head of Tony's cock and Steve tugged it off, hard, earning himself a scream of pleasured pain from Tony. He smoothed his hands down Tony's clothed thighs in comforting strokes and licked at Tony's slit until Tony came and came, splattering swirls of white on the dark fabric of the suit and sliding down Steve's chin. He made sure to keep his own suit spotless even as he loved to see Tony's stained with all the marks of their pleasure.
Tony had a quip at the tip of his tongue but it wouldn’t come out. He shook his head and focused on reaching Thor. He flew through the flattened tunnel of trees and deposited Clint and Natasha at the edge of the lawn where Colonel Sanders in his four-storey glory was roaring to the skies. His filters cut out the noise but his sensors also showed at least three hundred recording cameras pointed at them from the surrounding buildings. Tony sighed and fired off a perimeter of smoke flares. No ogling hopefully means that they would evacuate. The camera count only dropped to half and Tony sighed again.
Tony took another step back and felt himself hitting the wall. He dropped his head into his hands.
When Tony had been young, he’d had three certainties in his life: one, that cool logic, the methods of science, would always be where his mind functioned best; two, that the idea of ghosts completely negated his first certainty and thus should be ignored, no matter what his mother or Jarvis had told him to get him into bed; three, that his father had liked Captain America, World War II hero and national icon, better than him and he was never going to find out if Cap was really that much of a paragon because Cap was long dead.
Bruce pats Thor on the awkwardly on the arm; Loki was still a touchy subject. “I’m sure your mother taught him equally well.”
“Cap, leave it. I can deal with a few chicken scratches.”
Jim snorts. “Man, you know age isn’t a thing. And he’s turning 32. Or 98, depending on how you want to count it. He’s either a big boy or almost a centenarian.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh Lord, Steve, you're serious."
“Care to introduce us?” the blond continued with a dismissive wave at Steve.
Tony gasped, wordless, and Steve swallowed around the shaft, his mouth and throat slick with saliva. He massaged Tony's thigh, feeling the muscles tense as Tony tried to thrust but couldn't.
I hope you had fun reading this!
Fuck, he needed—
They sit and watch the bar around them. It was a Thursday evening. Not the busiest of nights but there were plenty of people around, chattering in low voices to the sound of soft blues.
Bruce nods in agreement. They stop by the library and knock on the doors. No answer came so they open the doors and peer in. The sunlight is streaming through one of the far windows, lighting on an armchair with its cushions still disheveled and compressed from someone sitting there. A book lies open, face down on the small table next to it. Bruce isn't able to make out a title but it looks like a classic.
“Aye.”
“Here, Colonel!” Thor called over the rumbling from the brewing clouds.
Stark had one wrist free from the rough ropes, placed under his head as if he were simply relaxing upon it. The other wrist was still bound to the iron rails above his head and each of his ankles were bound separately to the irons on the other side. If it wasn't for the bruises on his cheek, the abraded skin at his jaw, and the rough tangle of his clothes from his struggles, Steve would've been convinced. It didn't look like Stark was in pain and there was no blood visible – Steve breathed a sigh of relief. He dropped to his knees at Stark's bound feet and really let himself relax. Stark was far from getting free and Steve truly didn't want to think about what would have happened if he hadn't stopped the locomotive in time.
“Yeah, you do. You already smelled of horse the over day, but now you smell of pig. No offense,” said Steve, his voice muffled by the sleeve. “I never got why Bambi had her inn so close to the pig pen.”
Tony dresses up, and Steve escorts him out of his room, checking that no one’s there to watch them. He unlocks the door for Tony, and in a second Tony’s outside, giving him a little wave of his fingers and then rushing down the stairs, vanishing out of Steve’s life in a blink.
His voice wavered and lowered.
“Well. We had a very edifying talk. Thank you. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got to go.”
“Joseph, Joseph, don’t go!” she said. “There’s light in the tower. It’s too dangerous! We’ll come back tomorrow.”
“I’m serious,” he laughs, pushing Tony back on the bed. “The shirt is sexy. Keep it on for now?”
She nodded again, so he got on;
By the time Steve’s hand had let go of Tony’s softening sex, and by the time they had broken the kiss, they were both panting harshly, breathless. Steve’s fervent eyes were glazed over with arousal, and he smiled brightly to Tony;
… he doubts that is a coincidence.
Tony sighs.
“I can’t believe all of you!” cried out Tony, throwing his hands up. “Of course I helped! I know Barnes’ a nice fellow, I know it’s not his fault, and I know he was brainwashed and had no freewill! Yes, I know he was a victim, so of course I was gonna help! But do you think that changes everything? Do you think I can magically forget what happened? I
Eventually they separated, their lips feeling raw and wet, the taste of the other lingering on their tongue, the both of them panting and their eyes glazed with want. Steve’s arms slowly unwind from around Tony’s shoulders, and he took hold of Tony’s wrists, pulling him towards him while he backtracked. He lead Tony to the bathtub, opened the tap to fill the tub with warm water, and then directed his whole focus on Tony, nimble fingers disrobing him quickly. Tony didn’t help him, content in laying his hands on Steve’s shoulders, arms resting against his chest, and leaning in so as to mouth at Steve’s throat, feeling, under his lips and tongue, Steve’s pulse quickening.
“Repeats?” parrots Steve, and then he gets it and stammers; “oh! I’m sorry, I-I didn’t mean to presume-”
“Here, you’ve got to meet my friend Rhodey here. He’s the best.” And he turns toward his friend; “Pumpkin, here’s the guy I was telling you about.”
As Tony were to head for the village, he asked Steve if he wanted to send a message to his parents and friends. But Steve shook his head, a sad twist to his lips, and asked that he wouldn’t tell them about him at all. Tony didn’t insist, and prepared to leave, watching as Steve hooked his braid to the hook by the window.
“However you want, I’m not picky.”
“Just a second,” he mutters, pulling out of Tony’s embrace and opening up his drawer.
“Uh…”
“There’s a hickey on you throat!” yells Darcy.
“Yes. I’m sorry if you felt…
I want to thank everyone who kudoed and bookmarked. I love you guys and I will try my best to not let you down. <3
“And Steve… Steve seems to like me, but… I can’t help but wonder why? Did you do something? Is it because of my wish? Did you
Tony squeezes his arm, again.
“Are you still leaving the day after tomorrow?” asked Arnie.
“Jan, you said you granted one wish. So why don’t you help that poor guy in the tower?” said Tony after a while of them walking through the dark forest in silence.
Tony squirms and avoids his eyes, and Steve can’t help but reach for him, putting a comforting hand on his arm and gently squeezing it.
Mute, Tony watched him step back, feeling strangely abandoned as the exploring fingers left him. Steve brought a chair and sit facing Tony, a blank sheet of paper pinned to the kitchen chopping board in one hand, and a sharpened piece of coal in the other. He smiled to Tony, asked him not to move, and started drawing.
Lightning flooding him inside, hot, scorching fire ravaging his pelvis, pleasure sparking down his thighs, into his sex, and up into his guts, rushing through his spine, up his nape, thundering into his mind as he cried out, lost into white-hot ecstasy. When he came to, Steve’s fingers were out of him and gently petting the small of his back, and his lips were pressing soft kisses on his nape.
“You’re a fairy!” exclaimed the man. “Why did you lead me here?”
“Rest some more, Tony. You look exhausted. If you need anything, you can wake me up. My room’s downstairs by the stairs. Okay?”
“Christ, my bedroom is all over at the very opposite of this flat, there’s Bucky’s room and the bathroom between it, you are grossly exaggerating, kid!” snapped Steve.
He jumps out of bed, ignoring his own wobbly legs, rushing to stop him, embracing him tightly, and Tony presses his forehead against his neck and cries.
“Could you maybe…” started Steve, and then he stood up, putting aside the drawing and his coals. He hovered over Tony, his hands reaching for his opened shirt and sliding the clothing down Tony’s shoulders. “You don’t need to take it off,” he said, flushing, “But it’d be nice if I could see your musculature a bit better.”
“Green?” asked Steve, and he sounded a little breathless himself.
“I don’t mind paying a room,” insists Tony.
He’s totally deluding himself. Even if Tony isn’t attracted to muscular guys, there’s no way he’d be interested in some runt like Steve.
Tony stepped back, putting space between them. His hands shakily tied up his pants and buckled up his belt, and then tried to button up his shirt.
Of course, it would later turn out that the first two dates with Tony are an absolute
“You’re not a girl,” gasped Tony, and the young man facing him frowned even more, gesturing at his clothes.
A young man about his age was cleaning the tables, and a woman, her hair graying and her face all smiles, was putting away the beer mugs. The guy stared at Tony, while the woman greeted;
This, what Tony and Steve had just done… This was vastly different.
They sat together on a bench. The white walls and wide glass panels of the buildings were blinding under the hard sun. Not a single cloud sailed in the bright blue sky. Not a single breeze shook the leaves of the trees towering in their back.
His aggressive voice made Steve jump and look up at him. Tony stood up in a fury and turned to face him, cold anger taking over him once again, his dark eyes blazing.
“Maybe,” repeated Steve, blankly.
“Uh… you’re staying at Bambi’s inn, aren’t you?” he said, covering his nose with his sleeve.
Steve grimaces.
Tony refused to face him and strode to the window, picking up his boots on the way.
And he’s diving right back into a kiss. Shoes, coats, suits, everything is dropped unceremoniously on the floor, and between kisses, Steve gasps;
“Um, you’re…?”
“Ah, but I’m not the bitch, here, Little Iron Man. You are. You’re going to take me alright, but you’re going to take me
And so Steve told him about his illness as a child, and how the sorcerer Schmidt -the Red Skull- had taken him as replacement for the rampions his father, Joseph Rogers, had stolen to him. Ever since, the Red Skull named Steve ‘Rapunzel’, after the rampions that had saved his life -or maybe, thought Tony, to spite Steve and never let him forget the reason why he was imprisoned here-.
“As if you were a car without fuel, only you had no idea where or how to get your fuel,” added Tony softly.
They settle down on the bed, share the cake and the cookies, and cuddle together. He has lent his largest yoga pants and sweatshirt to Tony, who looks absolutely adorable in it, which is probably a strange thing to call for a man as masculine as Tony.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I understand.”
Ha ha ha!”
Joseph in the desperation of saving his child consented to everything, and every night he came by the garden to fetch fresh rampion for his child. No matter how hard he tried to remember the path leading to the tower, he never could; it was as if the trees in the woods traitorously walked away and chose different places to root, making it impossible to find the sorcerer’s garden without the help of the fairy.
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me!”
So he had ventured in the wrong woods, thinking of finding the good witch, only to get lost in the dark woods, and was now copiously insulting his mount.
“I’ll come back,” said Tony, and felt his heart constrict when he saw the small, disbelieving smile Steve gave him as an answer.
The sound on the TV is loud enough that they wouldn’t have heard them, and Steve is much relieved about that, especially since Wanda and Pietro are still very young.
“I had just a little more muscles back then, but yeah, I can’t buff up. I’m not weak, though, you know.”
But Steve hadn’t redrawn his face. That expression that he had caught on the paper back then, in the half-lit bedroom, had been real. He just hadn’t noticed it back then, too focused on Tony’s hands. And Tony had eventually looked away, focusing on his pleasure rather than Steve…
His heart is hammering in his chest, and he’s still waiting for the dream to fade, or for Tony to suddenly laugh it all out and say he isn’t actually interested and was fucking with him.
“What are those scars? It looks like shrapnel and heart surgery.”
“Sorry, Jan, please don’t be angry. I didn’t mean it like that,” amended Tony. “You’re right, it would be a horrible thing to do and you’re not like that. I should’ve known better than to accuse you.”
“Isn’t it?”
For a second, something like hesitation and mistrust, as if Tony thought he was being mocked, showed in Tony’s eyes, but it vanishes in the blink of an eye, so Steve doesn’t dwell on it.
Don't worry, Steve and Tony still have some talking to do. We'll see Tony's POV in the next chapter and pick up after Steve left.
He stopped asking the spiderling to explain after the boy showed him a video of two men in a hot tub “five feet apart ‘cause they’re not gay”, except someone had photoshopped Iron Man and War Machine’s faceplates onto them. He tried to give Peter his best unamused face, but immediately proceeded to send the video to Rhodey. They were trending on Twitter the next day.
Steve inhaled deeply before replying. “I need to use one of your small planes. There’s something I have to do.”
Rhodey left the next morning. Tony watched him take off, until he disappeared into the sky. He’d decided to leave Peter to his devices for the day. He wouldn’t be the best teacher, with his mind all over the place. After several cups of coffee, he found himself walking outside, toward the forest.
Before he could say anything, Rhodey beat him to it. “Hi, is this Tony StaNk?” Rhodey howled as Tony rolled his eyes. “Ha. Ha. Very funny, platypus. You’re the sweetest.”
The next morning, Tony woke to the smell of coffee. His need for coffee overpowering any urge to stay in bed, he threw on his well-worn AC/DC shirt on top of his sweatpants and padded out of his room, to the kitchen. It wasn’t as big as the one in the compound, but no less fancy, decked with a top of the line coffee maker, of course, as well as an industrial stove and a fridge he equipped with F.R.I.D.A.Y.
Tony bit into it and closed his eyes, taking comfort in the simple pleasure, his mouth flooded with warm chocolate and sugar. Peter smiled at him blissfully. “Mr. Stark?” Tony’s eyes fluttered open and turned his head to face the kid. “What’s up, Parker?”
The darker man was in his War Machine suit, but his faceplate was open. Steve didn’t have time to marvel at the fact he was walking again. “Unless my hearing is faulty, I heard you were asked to leave,” he snarled. He positioned himself between Steve and Tony, arms crossed, but body poised to fight. “But if you want to stay, I believe there is an entire organization who’d love to come retrieve you. Please, give me one more reason to kick your ass.”
Tony snapped his eyes open and realized he was kneeling on the ground. Peter’s arms were clasped around him. “ ‘M okay. It’s okay.”
****************************************************************************************************
After putting everything away, Peter offered to make their lunch. “I’m not an expert,” he said, “but I learned how to make some easy stuff when Aunt May had to work late.” Huh. F.R.I.D.A.Y was right, then. The kid would end up taking care of him, making sure he ate. “Thanks,” Tony said. “I’m going to check in with Pepper about SI stuff, but I’ll be back in a few. She’ll find a way to kill me through the phone if I don’t call her.”
She apparently, was not amused. “Don’t joke about that! But yes, we’ll be in touch,” she affirmed, “and Tony? You know I’m here for you, right?” Tony felt a small pang in his heart. Even if they weren’t together, she would forever be one of his best friends.
“Well, no…But I thought you were just humoring him.”
A flash of hurt danced across Tony’s face before contorting into a mask of fury. “Tony, I didn’t mean—.”
Tony learned that Peter could, in fact, cook. Or at least make killer grilled cheese sandwiches. “They were my favorite food when I was a kid,” Peter told him over bites of the sandwich. They graciously dipped the sandwiches in hearty portions of the vegetable soup the mom at the market had given them. It was one of the best meals Tony had eaten in months.
Steve forced the tension out from his limbs and closed his eyes, phantom breath leaving his body in a rush.
“So,” Tony said, sitting down and kicking his feet up onto Steve’s desk, “Feel up for a game of rummy?”
Steve clicked his tongue again and sat back, his toe nudging at the agent’s knee. “You know what that answer gets you.”
“Thor remains off-planet. The Hulk has not yet returned to headquarters but he appears to be functioning within normal parameters – he is currently posing for photographs with tourists in Central Park as reported by no less than five networks. I am happy to inform you that Agents Barton and Romanoff have alighted at the Landing Bay ten minutes prior to this minute. They no longer appear to be under an unknown influence, as you or Captain Rogers appear to be. They have asked me to pass on a message. Shall I play it?"
"We are men of passion," T'Challa said into the silence. "We cannot be faulted for our passions reacting to the death of a loved one. We can only learn to recognize this feeling and learn to never let it take hold of us ever again."
for still sticking around after the one with the champagne and Camelot. I forgive you but I don’t blame you in the first place so take what you will.”
“No,” Steve said quickly, shaking his head once. “I can do that. For you.” He looked at his gloved hands briefly, then removed the gloves and tucked them into his belt. Hands now bare, he raised one, fingers hovering an inch from the surface of the arc reactor, then looked back up at Tony, asking permission. Tony turned to perch a knee onto the seat and shifted forward that last inch, letting Steve’s fingers sink into him.
“I was just claiming my territory” Tony says breezily, then adds, voice adopting the lilt of David Attenborough, “In nature, the urge to claim territory is ingrained in almost every animal. It is a strong urge, one that must be—“
Oh God.
“Tony!”
“It wasn’t a bad thing,” Steve said, honest, “It helped you as much as—“
“What do you need?” Tony asked the room at large, arms thrown wide. “What else do you need? Me?”
Steve’s shield was on ground a little ways off and Tony staggered towards it, picking it up and glancing around for any sign of Steve. As his fingers closed over the shield, he felt a prickle of heat at his fingertips, rising up his arms to settle in his chest. He thought he heard a chuckle and he stared down at the shield just in time to see a green glow vanish, the same green hue as the light he’d seen when he’d Trapped the blob just earlier in the day.
Thor continued to fly after the Colonel, knocking him away from the giant chicken, swinging at its head, and breaking its glasses. The Colonel refused to fall but was at least moving further away from its partner in crime, stirring up clouds of dust with its massive feet.
The words swirled through Tony’s mind and Tony almost laughed out loud as the loose pieces clicked slowly into place, one by one. What was the Certainty Two had told him? Anything was possible. Him, a man of science, dealing in
Steve was reading the evening paper. The dollar was up, and the President had announced a joint peace summit between all the Presidents currently residing in the same temporal space. There was massive backlash, and there was outspoken support. The usual.
Jim puts his glass down and reaches over to pull Tony’s face back to look him in the eye. “Tones. You of all people know that sexuality is a wide, wide spectrum. Plus,” Jim says, pulling his hand back, “I have on good authority that the good Captain will indeed look at a man if it’s the right man.”
He felt a tug somewhere from his chest and the world around him spun. He dropped to his knees, riding the vertigo, and when he opened his eyes again, he was looking at a grey floor. The heat was spreading through his torso and his left arm was entirely numb now. He clenched his jaw against the burning and stood heavily. All around him was an endless grey space with fractals of light appearing here and there, flashing in and out of existence as fast as he could blink.
“Dear God, son, you look awful,” said Mrs Arbogast as she peeked inside.
Well... I didn't plan it to turn out like this, but Tony freaked out so I had to let him do some introspection.
He rolled Tony on his stomach and parted his legs again, and Tony shivered once more as he felt his breath on his bare thighs, his large rough hands caressing his skin under the stockings. Mind still clouded, but fire spreading through his veins as quick as lightning, Tony retorted, holding himself up on his elbows;
Steve stared at him, again. He was standing proudly, hands on his hips, his braid still tied to the hook by the window, while Tony was sprawled on the floor, all sweaty and his throat parched. It may have been because Tony was totally dying from that inhumane climb, but black spots were dancing before his eyes, and the floor felt unstable under his bottom, his whole body burning up as if on fire, and Steve himself was getting pretty blurred.
“Why, I’m a prince of course, so I couldn’t help myself when hearing such a beautiful voice. I thought you had to be some pretty princess in distress.”
“Is it me? Did I hurt you?” Steve’s voice was getting higher and higher in his distress. “I thought you wanted it, you were looking at me with those heated eyes and… and… and you were making those sounds, Tony, you even asked me for more, and… and your body was reacting to my every touch… I… I really thought you wanted me!”
They drank herbal tea and ate the cookies, chatting as they had last time. Tony asked him about the drawings in coal on the walls, and Steve admitted he had done them. He didn’t have much paper to draw on, so he would draw on the walls and later wash them. He would also draw on every inch of paper he had, mostly on the back of the music scores the sorcerer sometimes brought him back from the city (to keep Steve’s mind from turning crazy with boredom, guessed Tony. The Red Skull also gave his prisoner a few books, some novels of chivalry and some cooking recipes). Steve had learned to read at his church, both the roman letters and the music notes, for as a child he had been so frail and so often sick that he hadn’t been much of use to his parents, and so the priest had given him purpose by letting him help out a little in the church.
Steve kisses him back. Tony tastes like sugar and cranberry. Steve hopes Tony likes mango, because that’s what was in Steve’s own mocktail.
“You could visit? The compound’s still yours. Please promise me you’ll visit.”
So Steve does look him up, and sure enough, Tony Stark is
Dinner is a happy time. They joke, and sing, and tear into the dinner that Bucky and Steve made, and the meal that has taken so much time to prepare vanishes in an instant. Thor, Natasha, Bucky, and Darcy are now competing over shots of vodka-eggnogs, while Sam is cutting the Christmas cake. Steve passes their shares around, and Clint is already digging in his like an ogre -he was restraining himself from drinking because he and Bobbi were heading home tonight-.
“No way. I’m a man of science,” retorted Tony, and started swatting at her. “Get off my Dummy, he hates wasps and all things that sting.”
“I should be late more often,” he snickers. “If it makes you get laid. It must’ve been good, considering how slutty he sounded.”
He wrenched his hand out of Steve’s gentle hold. His whole body was taunt as a string, bursting with rage, his teeth gnashing as he gritted them, his deep eyes burning with hurt.
“That’s scientifically impossible,” said Tony, and the blond young man glared at him. “Okay, okay, forget it. I’m Tony.”
“Who the Hell are you?” frowned Tony, for he had a strong dislike of all that was magical (yes, he had wanted to visit the good witch just to prove that she was a quack).
“Sir, yes sir. I’ll follow you, sir!”
“The Red Skull called you Rapunzel,” noted Tony.
“Yeah, that bitch thing is getting real old, you aren’t very creative, are you?” mocked Tony.
He keeps thrusting gently and slowly into Tony, dropping butterfly kisses all over his shoulders and nape. He loves Tony’s nape and buries his nose in his hair, inhales his scent. Tony has a leg bent, making it easier for Steve to go deep. One of Tony’s hands is laying flat on the mattress, the other playing with the pillow’s hem. Steve doesn’t know why, but there’s an intense longing tightening his chest, and so he reaches up and puts his hand on Tony’s, squeezes it tenderly. Tony glances back at him, and smiles.
“You’re pretty muscular yourself.”
Steve laughs giddily. He’s standing in front of Tony, who’s still sitting on the bed, and Tony is undressing him. As soon as Steve’s naked, Tony wraps his arms around his waist and brings him closer, buries his nose in Steve’s pubic hair. Steve’s heart jumps in his chest, and his blood rushes south.
“Yeah, yeah,” Bucky waves him off. “Come and join us, my young padawan!”
“Actually, I’m thinking of eating you up, Little Iron Man,” growled the wolf, and no sooner had it said so that Tony broke into a run, through the bushes, not caring of the brambles trying to hold him back with their traitorous thorns, holding protectively his basket against his chest. His cloak fluttered behind him. Tony didn’t really know where he was exactly, didn’t know that part of the woods very well, but it didn’t matter: he sprinted off like a rabbit.
Butterhooves and Dummy snorted at him, both completely indifferent about having been abandoned for hours, and Tony swiftly untied their bridles and jumped on Dummy’s back.
A bush rustled. Tony took in a sharp breath, and started walking again, swiftly. Over the female dress, which was composed of an underskirt, skirt, bodice, shirt and an apron, he was wearing his gold and fire cloak, the hood up and hiding his face.
So Tony’s a recovering alcoholic… that usually would be enough to send Steve running away. But surprisingly, this time he stays, the warmth growing even more in his chest. It has to be Tony’s gorgeousness that’s affecting him ; attractive people really have it easier, thinks Steve.
he was feeling was…
And then he jumps as if realizing he has said something he shouldn’t have.
Tony knew he should consider it, since he really did need the money, but at this time his heart and mind were hurting and all he wanted to do was heading home and have his friends pamper him. So he kept silent, focusing on his food, not gracing Arnie with an answer. Thankfully, Arnie didn’t push.
“Yes, ah, it looks great on you.”
And then his eyes widen.
! This isn’t a fairy tale. This is real life! I can’t make buddy-buddy with Barnes, I
“I didn’t think of him as a human being, or even a living being,” said Tony, his voice flat. “I thought of him as a tool. As a weapon. As the
Steve struggled to keep his voice calm and unwavering. Getting angry, or on the contrary desperate, would only push Tony further in his resentment.
“And I’m the one who started it,” admits Tony easily. “I’m sorry for the rich boy sob story. You didn’t deserve to have my shit dumped on you like that.”
So Steve gives it to him. Presses inside, slowly, carefully. He doesn’t want to come too soon, and God, Tony is so tight, it’s maddening. He doesn’t want to hurt him, either.
Well. There’s that. Love. Steve never believed in love at first sight, and now he wants to kick himself because he’s head over hills in love with someone he met a grand total of two times.
It seems Tony Stark had been really famous for a while, with a playboy reputation, until he had almost died from drug abuse. Since then, he had retired from the public. It took years for the paparazzi to leave him alone; they had even followed him to his numerous rehabs. There are pictures of a sick-looking, exhausted and so young Tony Stark, obviously still in rehab, and that makes Steve want to punch those assholes to the moon. Finally, Tony not playing around anymore didn’t make him interesting enough in their eyes, so they stopped hounding him. Occasionally, there is an article here and then, but Steve doesn’t read those rags, which is why he hadn’t known about him. Steve also finds out with surprise that he used to be the CEO of Stark Industries, before he was stripped from his own company by Obadiah Stane -that bald guy who always appears on TV talking about the weapons Steve had been very familiar with during his time in the army-. It shouldn’t be a surprise; it
Anyone would tell you that Steve is a stubborn little shit with a ‘fight me!’ complex. Usually though, Steve gets into fights because it’s the Right Thing To Do. Because he hates bullies, and someone has to fight them, even if it ends up with his frail self being beaten into a pulp, and his best friend Bucky flying to the rescue.
“What took you so long?” she said, playfully stomping his nose with her tiny feet.
“You want me to get in like a
“I’ll be fine tomorrow,” grunted Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
They take their coats in the cloakroom, they’re out of the bar, and Tony’s arm has let go of Steve’s waist. Steve takes hold of his hand, and their fingers intertwine. Tony’s hand is surprisingly rougher than he’d thought; he probably works with his hands a lot.
Tony pushed a slice of cake in his hands, nose scrunched up.
Tony heard the pigs squealing outside as Bucky herded them into the pig pen, and the church bell slowly striking ten o’clock.
“So Tony… who are you and why would you come here? Don’t you know Schmidt is dangerous?”
Tony carefully went over his memories and feelings again, only to confirm that yes, he had been in love with Rhodey at the beginning of their friendship, and had pined after him for a long time until the unrequited love had eventually died down. He groaned, pressing his face into his pillow. He really had the worst luck in love. And now here he was, head over hills in love with a man he barely knew, a man who was being held prisoner by some dark evil sorcerer in a tower with no freakin’ stairs, and Tony had no idea what to make of the situation. He wanted to confess his feelings to Steve, and to apologize for his unfair rejection, but then heavy doubts started plaguing his mind.
Tony gags and pulls out.
“Why is it you want me so much to be a narcissist?” asks Tony, droll.
The emotions bordering on tears, as well as the fleeting peace had floated away, and now Tony was swept again in his ocean of anger and hurt. It was jarring to see how strongly Tony still felt about all this, even years after. Steve closed his fist again, once more physically stopping himself from reaching for him and putting a comforting hand on his arm. He knew Tony would just swat him away. Tony’s body was trembling, and it was visible he was stopping himself from jumping up and pacing around.
Steve breathed in, feeling himself shake slightly. He gulped down the ugly sobs that were gathering in his throat. He still felt Peggy’s loss keenly, and he hated thinking back to the avalanche of fear that had taken hold of him during the whole Civil War debacle, to the point he had stopped thinking of Tony, Natasha, Vision and Rhodey as teammates, but as the enemy.
The song eventually stopped, and Tony found himself yearning ardently for the one who had been singing. No sooner had this desire taken root in his heart, that a tiny little woman, wearing a dress of gold and coals, landed on Dummy’s withers, her wasp-like wings fluttering.
“Who?” gasps Steve, because he doesn’t believe in coincidences.
Oh God. Oh God, what did he say!?
“Please,” whispers back Tony.
Steve lowered his eyes to the ground. Now that Tony had brought this to his attention, he could see it. It was hard not to, when news of regular white guys shooting kids in school, or lobbies fighting against gun regulation, regularly showed up on the TV.
“Go on, go feed your guy. But we wanna meet him tomorrow.”
And it was because Tony knew that ‘better than most’, that his most loyal friends were now Rhodey, a man with the darkest skin, and Pepper, a woman with fiery red hair. Rhodey who, while born in the city, was considered a stranger, a heretic, a barbarian. Pepper who was considered a child of the devil because of the color of her hair, a witch because as a woman she dared compete with men.
“I know a powerful Schmidt in the city, who’s got his own militia and stuff. But he doesn’t look like the Red Skull at all, he’s perfectly human-looking. He’s black-haired with dark cruel eyes and a very serious face.”
“Thank you,” murmurs Tony, pressing a kiss on his cheek.
He swallowed. He couldn’t look at Tony anymore.
“Are you going to join me in the bath?” purred Tony, nipping at Steve’s jaw, and felt him shiver.
When he was finally back to his room at the inn, he closed the shutters, undressed, and wrapped himself in the blankets,  curling into a ball, hiding his face in his pillow. There, ignoring the animated chatter of the village people outside, he cried himself to sleep.
“Oh no, but it would’ve been a shame to have missed out on you,” smiled Tony.
He was drifting in and out of sleep when Mrs Arbogast came to check on him a few hours later. It was time for supper, and Tony had never skipped it before. Her soft knocking on the door stirred Tony out of his dark reverie, and, his voice rough, he told her to enter.
However, it turned out it had been more that the appreciation of an artist. The moment Steve had met Tony Stark, he had felt a pull towards him, and that pull had never left. Hence he got frustrated. He refused to think of it as attraction for a while, and when he had finally recognized it as such, he had been furious and disgusted, and had blamed Tony for it. Surely, it was the playboy’s fault -forget that Tony was at the time in a steady relationship with Pepper, and had never been seen with a man before, it had to be him that had corrupted Steve-!
“I don’t know. Back in my village, no one even knew his last name. I’m the only one who knows, because he told me.”
“Com’on,” he purrs, “I’m ready, please, darling.”
be. Even his father, who’d been very harsh on him (‘
In the end, he sends the nude drawing to Tony (since Tony didn’t take it, saying he was afraid of damaging it while transporting it) and with it flowers and a card inviting him on a date, and hopes he didn’t ridiculed himself. That’s how he is, though, a stupidly romantic guy, and he wasn’t about to pretend to be someone he isn’t.
God, God, God, Steve is the awkwardest person to have ever
“Uh-huh,” drawls Tony, and then he moans a little, a soft, almost inaudible whine. He’s fully hard and stroking himself a little faster now, and he rips his eyes off Steve’s and stares up at the ceiling, mouth falling open. His other hand is now down between his legs and Steve holds his breath as he watches him pressing a finger inside of himself, and then one, two more, until all three fingers steadily sink in and drag out, in and out.
He closed his eyes and sighed. He’d been dreaming, while sleeping this disaster off. Memories, mostly. This, whatever this
Then again, Tony doesn’t know that Steve has taken his drawing just yesterday, and fixed it, so he doesn’t know that the drawing isn’t as scandalously pornographic as it was before.
Tony opened his eyes. Steve was watching him ardently, and Tony rode the last of his pleasure slowly, hips undulating lazily, hands letting go of the crumpled sheets so as to wrap around Steve’s neck, mouth at long last seeking the pouty lips and devouring them in a deep kiss, tongue licking into Steve’s mouth.
“Yeah, and I was dressed like this. I thought you would find me less threatening if you believed me to be a girl.”
, Steve! The only real friend I had was Rhodey, and he had enrolled already ! Your depression sucked? Poor you! Newsflash, mine sucked too! I got drunk all the time, did drugs, tried to kill myself by doing the most reckless things, slept around without protection, tried again to kill myself when a sex tape of me got leaked, went to rehab, and wow, was all that fun! The only reason I’m still here now, is because Jarvis, the human Jarvis, my old butler, took care of me, and Rhodey even managed to take time off for me, too ! They got me treated for depression, the medication had horrible side-effects on me and I had to go through a handful of therapists, but I eventually got better. And yeah, back then when I was sick I made a lot of stupid decisions, I acted like an ass and I still can’t understand how Jarvis and Rhodey managed to bear with me and went as far as fuckin’ saving me, but I can tell you one thing… I would’ve never,
“You smell like pig,” snorted Steve, as he pushed down Tony’s shirt. Tony moved his arms obligingly, letting Steve strip him of it.
So slow it is. Careful. Until he’s fully sheathed into Tony’s ass. Tight, tight, tight like a vice, and burning hot.
Well, he has been scrutinizing Tony all night, it’s only fair that would Tony read him back, isn’t it? Because that’s what Tony’s doing, watching him closely as if he was reading Steve’s thoughts like a book.
The trees gave out to the road and wide fields. In the horizon already darkened by the descending sun, lights from the village shimmered.
“Rogers, do you really think we have treated Wanda right? Do you really think that Vision and her would have ended like that if we hadn’t screwed up?”
“Tony Stark. The CEO of Stark Innovations? He’s one of the leading fortunes in America, you know? Hey, if he’s gonna be your patron, you’ve gotta know who he is. Look him up on the Internet, Steve.”
“No thanks, I’m tired. I’ll, um, get to bed. See you tomorrow, guys.”
They are both slightly panting, as if caught doing something dangerous or naughty, and they look at each other and start laughing.
I wanted to break and take from you. Would he have died if I had done so, if I had beaten him up like I wanted to? Yes, probably. Certainly? I don’t know. I’m not proud of it. I saw red and couldn’t stop. Thinking of my mom. Seeing how you lied for him. I saw red.”
Steve rolls his eyes.
“You even warmed up the butter,” chuckled the werewolf. “Always prepared, aren’t you?”
“You didn’t do anything I didn’t want, Steve,” he said, his voice rough. “I wanted it. I wanted you. I still do. I want you. I don’t feel half as alive as I do when I’m by your side, and that’s the truth.”
“You’re not Schmidt,” she said, and her voice was deep, deeper than Tony’s. Her frail neck had a very visible Adam’s apple.
Tony laughs at that, and takes the offered hand. They go up the stairs together, much slower than last time, when they had barely been able to take their hands off each other.
“Hell no, I’m not spoiling my night with Hammer’s stupid face. Go without me, Pep.”
Another silence.
“Sorry. I shouldn’t… I know it’s different for everybody, and it’s nobody’s fault. I… I understand, Steve. Really, I do… And… I knew you weren’t well the instant I realized you never answered ‘yes’ to  simple questions like ‘are you okay?’, ‘will you be alright?’. Shrugging it off. Saying you’re home. Always getting around the question. I knew you weren’t well, I just… I didn’t think it was
. I can’t. I
“Yes, yes you did. I know you, Cap. Whenever there’s something you don’t like on the TV, you turn it off.” Steve winced, for he remembered very well doing so when Wanda was watching the news in the aftermath of Lagos. Tony kept going; “So of course you’d never know about what people thought about us, or what politics were going on. You didn’t like it? You ignored it. You did the same with the Accords. And okay, you’re only human, so you can make mistakes. But you dragged the whole team down with you, just because you were so very content in your imaginary world. Must have been a shock, to realize that none of your wonderland could work without financial and legal support, huh?”
Steve pats at his hip, and Tony obediently rolls over on his stomach.
That’s when he notices it. There’s a date highlighted there. The date of Howard and Maria Stark’s death by car accident, a dozen years ago.
“Tony,” said Steve in a half-whisper, his eyes still smoldering under heavy lashes, “You wouldn’t mind getting bare-chested, right? It’s best to draw nudes when working on human anatomy, but I wouldn’t ask you to fully undress.”
Steve’s left thumb traced his mustache down to the corner of his mouth, and then caressed his lips, and Tony shivered again, eyes still boring into Steve’s. He felt Steve’s other hand on his jaw sliding back down his throat and torso, nails softly threading through his chest hair, and then gentle fingertips pressing on his raised nipple, trying maybe to soothe it down.
“Not really,” said Steve from somewhere above him. Tony turned over and watched him, as Steve, standing precariously on a stool, rummaged in the buffet. He finally took out a tin box and jumped down his stool. “He’s a fire elemental, and Schmidt forcefully bid him to the hearth. Toro’s a prisoner, just like me.”
Jan popped out of nowhere and happily greeted him, and the both of them, chatting, headed for the tower. Jan assured him that the sorcerer had already left, and so Tony tied Dummy to a tree and went to the tower, calling out;
Tony produced a piece of tinder and handed it to him.
Sighing, Tony called him in. He sat up in bed as Arnie entered, carrying a tray on one arm. About to close the door behind him with his free hand, Arnie frowned at the closed shutters. The only light in the room came from the hallway, so he left the door ajar and came to put the tray on Tony’s lap, sitting on the bed next to him.
He couldn’t do that to Tony.
Tony tried to not climb too fast -it wouldn’t do to faint last the first time-, but he couldn’t wait to be rejoined with his love, and soon he was reaching the windowsill, panting, and Steve was helping him up, catching him by his wrists with his thin and strong hands, and as Tony set foot in the tower they started talking simultaneously;
“I… Not yet. Not yet, Steve. I’d like that, but I’d like to go on real dates first, and if that works, okay. We’ll be together.”
As Tony bends and kisses him, again, rocking into Steve, they both grow fully hard, and it feels so good to get that warm, warm and sensitive skin against the other’s, that Steve forgets all about the lace and links his arms around Tony’s waist, anchoring himself and moving with him. It’s not smooth enough, so they stop for lube, picking it up from the night table and pouring it on their lengths, and then the slide is much easier, much more pleasurable. Tony rocks and rocks against him, and Steve is gasping loudly, Tony’s teeth nipping at his neck and down his chest and nipples while Steve runs his hands down the small of Tony’s back and all over the firm, working muscles of his ass.
“What the flying Hell,” said Tony. “This is highly unpractical, why would someone climb such a height and risk a deadly fall?”
“Okay,” agrees Steve, though he feels a little heartbroken.
“I can’t,” said Jan, her voice sad. “I’ve already helped his father. I can’t grant more than one wish to the same blood. Most people in this village had that one wish granted already to their ancestors. Joseph was one of the lasts I could appear to. Now, you, as a stranger, I can help.”
Steve hugged him back.
“Hmm. Should I stop, then?”
Hearing this sorrowful lament, Tony remained frozen on the spot, feeling Steve’s sadness pierce through his heart. Jan kicked his nose to get him moving.
How wrong was he! No sooner had he rooted out another rampion, that a shadow fell on him like Death itself, and he went pale with fear as the tall figure hovered menacingly over him with its cape rippling in the windless air. Then the creature pulled back its hood, revealing a bald, nose-less and ears-less human head glowering with red skin. The sorcerer, for it was him, seized Joseph’s arm, and snarled;
“What are you doing here?” whispered Tony, pressing a hand on his chest to calm down his heart.
Tony thought he could come like this, with the velvet feel of Steve’s tongue against his, his mouthwatering taste, the duet of them moaning their pleasure, the sparks of lust and rapture lighting up a raging fire in their core. However Steve finally broke the kiss and stepped back, ignoring Tony’s fingers buried in the flesh of his rear, and said, breathlessly;
“Whenever I see him, I see her. Every time. It’s been years since Siberia. I’ve seen him lots of times now. But, every time I do, I see her.
Jan jumped on her feet, her serious face morphing into an affronted one, and she waved her tiny fists at him;
Tony smiled to her, and promised he would fix this mess.
It’s Thor. He’s loud. Therefore of course everyone hear him, fall silent and stare at Steve, and Steve is now beet-red. Bucky complains loudly;
He had wanted Steve inside of him. He had wanted Steve’s sex up his arse, stretching him, sliding in and out. He had wanted Steve to moan with him, to thrust into him, to find his own pleasure inside of Tony, to fill him to the brim with his semen so Tony would feel it coat his insides, spill out, and slide down his skin.
