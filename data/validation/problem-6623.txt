It was with that dirty little thought running through his mind that he entered the café and shared a coy little smirk with Tony when he reached the counter.
He had been glowing like the sun all day, to the point where other people took notice. All his coworkers noticed and asked him about it, his clients asked him about it, even a perceptive stranger on the subway asked him what he was celebrating. He just couldn’t turn that giddy happiness down. When Bucky saw him that night, he just
easy.” And he clearly seemed content to let that hint hang in the air before he went to his next customer, who just gushed with happiness that they were finally going on a date. He felt a wave of embarrassment at being played so well and disappointment to be denied something he had been yearning for, but he had to remind himself this was for the better. He originally planned to kiss Tony on Saturday and to take him on this surprise date and now he had a chance to do it. Besides, Tony all but promised him a first kiss on Saturday, and he decided to hold onto that promise.
Pete presented the final coffee to Steve, and he immediately took a sip and praised him on how good of a job he did, which made him glow like the sun. Pete rushed off to help the next customer, but Tony lingered for a moment. “Oh Tony, can I get one of those stick things, so the coffee doesn’t spill on the uniform.”
“Yes, this is,” he insisted as he pressed a kiss into the top of his hair. “This is a rough day and you need a hug.”
Steve just shook his head, but that blush refused to go away. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say Tony was trying to make him blush because he did a damn good job of it. “Can I order my coffee, or are we gonna keep talking about my shirt?” he asked in embarrassed exasperation.
Tony blushed as he purposefully kept his gaze on Pete, but he never moved his hand. “Yeah, definitely school.”
“My apartment is right above the shop,” Tony breathed out against him. “And Pete’s gone for the night. We have the whole place to ourselves. And don’t you dare get all noble on me because I
Right, he thought he would want coffee. But without Tony here, without being able to see Tony smile when he drank his coffee or to hear him laugh after the jokes he’d worked so hard on…what was even the point of being here? Sure the coffee was great and the muffins were a great source of food after his runs, but really he came for Tony. He came to interact with him, make him smile, make him laugh, see him, but if he wasn’t here today, then what was the point?
“I’ll be here,” Tony promised, and Steve was happy to note that it sounded glib and casual and not like that promise was intended specifically for him, which was good. Some part of him felt disappointed that it wasn’t a more personal promise, but if it was more general that meant he hadn’t tipped his hand, which was good.
Bucky hit Steve lightly on the arm and gestured towards Tony, a reminder to talk with him instead of the kid. He turned back to face Tony, his gaze focused on his butt like usual. It didn’t take him long to recognize that the swagger of his hips was definitely gone, and his stomach curled with unease. Something just seemed…off. It was weird. Tony sounded like normal and acted like normal, but his smiles didn’t make his eyes twinkle and he hadn’t teased him as soon as Bucky walked in the door. It was almost like he was being treated like…well like a normal customer. What happened? Did he do something wrong?
Had he read him wrong? He just assumed with the flirting and the comments about his body and the smirks that he was gay but…had he pegged him wrong? If he had a prior (or maybe even current – he didn’t actually know) relationship with a woman…was he actually into men? Sure he could be into men and women, but now he couldn’t be sure. Was he just flirting back because Steve was flirting and he wanted to keep a customer? Was he just trying to be nice? Sure he complimented his body, but he could acknowledge when a woman was beautiful even if he had no intention of sleeping with or dating her.
Looks like absence made the heart grow fonder! Are they actually taking steps towards something more than flirting?
Pete blushed at being called out. “Hey, it’s not that I don’t like it, I just don’t know much about it. But I’ll give you all night to change my mind and make me like it.”
“Pete doesn’t usually go on trips like this, so it’s going to be pretty lonely,” he hinted. “Might be nice to have some company.”
. He wouldn’t trust his flirting and he wouldn’t trust his advances unless he could assure him he really was single. He’d meant to bring Bucky there to figure out if their relationship could have a future, not to destroy it by making Tony think the wrong thing! “I should go back in there right now and fix this,” he decided, and he already found himself turning around to head back to the coffee shop.
He had thought spending the night was a bad idea. Sex with Tony had been like a chemical reaction just waiting to happen, and once their energies combined, it was like an explosion of feelings and emotion and lust and euphoria that it had taken him a long time to recover. He learned that Tony liked to be cuddled in the afterglow, which was perfect because he liked to cuddle, and once they reached that comfortable spot where Tony was tucked against him and their legs and arms were entwined with each other, he knew he was staying the night. He really didn’t want to make the walk of shame, but it was worth being able to stay pressed next to Tony all night.
Tony closed his eyes for a moment before he looked back up at Steve. “That’s a dumb question, Steve. Of course I am. Really I’m just sad it’s not today.”
Today was the day – for real this time. He was going to do it. No more fear, no more hesitation, no more delays, no more chickening out at the last minute, and no more excuses. He was a soldier after all, and he knew how to summon courage to rally himself in dangerous circumstances. He’d stared down insurgents and was capable of calm thoughts in the middle of battle. He’d risen to achieve the rank of Captain after all, and that wasn’t because he shied away from challenges. And yet every time, every time he went into the coffee shop after his morning run he just froze. He froze, acted like an idiot, and chickened out.
“Alright here you go, one Americano!” he announced proudly as he placed the paper cup on the counter. “I added a little something extra to it too - don’t worry it’s not like booze or anything like that. Just a unique blend of beans - kind of my thing,” he said in a tone that was almost dismissive, except he could tell that was this cafe’s unique claim to fame. “Guaranteed to jumpstart your morning.”
His face glowed as he launched into all the cool stuff he saw in DC. Steve gave his input when he could since he’d been to the capitol multiple times before, but even he hadn’t seen some of the stuff the teen had seen. He also got to hear some funny stories about things his classmates did during the trip, and offered him heartfelt congratulations when he heard that his school had won the national academic decathlon.
Just a warning, while not explicit, this chapter makes some references to their activities last night, so if that makes you uncomfortable, please be aware - it should be fairly easy to skip those paragraphs.
He walked into the shop five minutes early, and he wasn’t surprised when Tony greeted him with a forced smile. “Oh, hi Steve. You’re a little early today. You want your regular?” He sounded conversational and polite, but Steve knew it was hollow. He didn’t quite know what Tony was feeling – anger, hurt, disappointment – but it was probably a combination of all of them.
Steve felt his heart soar and he crushed another trembling kiss back onto Tony’s lips. He found himself back up in the clouds, soaring to unbelievable heights of happiness. His heart was so warm and light and filled with—he didn’t know what, but his heart was so full of it he thought it might burst.
Tony reached back and swatted at him playfully, but made no effort to move or pull away. “You should know better than to sneak up on a man in New York City,” he chided.
Tony whimpered as he pulled him into another passionate kiss. Right now, it seemed like that connection was the only way they could become one person, and neither of them could bear the thought of stopping and becoming two separate people again.
As Steve looked back at Jumpstart, he felt a wash of gratitude fall over him for this small, quaint café. Without this café, he wouldn’t have found the man he loved more than anyone else and who loved him in return. He wouldn’t be so happy he feared he might be glowing. He wouldn’t have
He didn’t know how successful this idea was, but when he thought of it in his mind’s eye, he really liked it. He got one of those make-at-home meal kits and a bottle of the nicest scotch he could afford and he thought it would be fun to try and make a meal together. Tony clearly had some skills baking so some of those had to translate to cooking, so that should make up for the fact that Steve was completely useless at anything that wasn’t boiling noodles or putting together a sandwich. His hope was that while they cooked together, they would hold each other while stirring, or guide each other’s hands while cutting, or steal touches when the other was focusing on the food. It would be corny and romantic and intimate and he loved it. Or their adventures in cooking would end up being a disaster, and they would spend the entire time laughing as they messed up and goofed around. He really was fine with either way. Really he just wanted an excuse to spend time with Tony in private, and that’s what the night would give them. And if Pete was on some school trip…
Steve laughed gaily, unable to hold the poker face he usually could with his jokes. “Only a little. It’s gonna be a surprise, so I was thinking we should meet here.”
“It’s a promise,” he assured him as he craned his neck around to peck his lips. Tony stayed there for a moment, cherishing the cuddle before he turned his attention back to the muffins. Steve tried really hard not to be a distraction, he did, but he also refused to stop touching or kissing him, and occasionally he would break Tony’s concentration. It might have taken longer than usual for all the baking to be done for the morning, but they still got it all done, and they did it without having to disconnect from each other. It was a perfect way to finish a perfect weekend. Cooking dinner together on Friday night was fun and flirty and everything he had hoped it would be. Friday night had of course been incredible, because sex with Tony only seemed to get better the more they did it (and oh boy did they do it), and Saturday morning was lazy and wonderful. They didn’t even leave the house on Saturday and spent most of the day draped over each other in varying states of undress as they just got to know each other and spend time with each other. He’d been dreading today, knowing that Tony would have to work, but he also knew that separating would make the memories of their time together this weekend even more special.
Steve chuckled as he shook his head and took a sip of the coffee that still tasted incredible no matter how many times he had it. “I never said I was worried. I’m just really excited.”
Steve just shook his head but continued to talk to Pete. He was a cool kid and they had a surprisingly large amount of stuff in common, so he didn’t think he’d have a problem filling this conversation and the one tonight. And despite Tony’s warning about not running out of things to say, Steve could tell it brought an extra smile to Tony’s face that he defied his order and continued to talk to him anyways. God he lov--liked, liked it when Tony smiled like that, and he knew he wanted it to be his goal in life to make Tony radiate that happy smile all the time.
He held onto the kiss as long as he could justify in public before he pulled away. He always felt like he had to censor how much and how deeply he kissed him so he didn’t make anyone else uncomfortable, but not tonight. “Oh, just thinking of our date tonight.”
“Good,” Tony breathed out as he grabbed one of Steve’s hands and somehow found the strength to detach. Steve immediately felt the pull back to him because damn if he didn’t feel lonely and isolated and cold without his touch, but he knew they needed to get up to Tony’s flat where the real magic could happen. He let Tony lead him along, but Tony stopped abruptly and picked up Steve’s shirt from the floor. He held onto it with a proud smirk. “I’m wearing this tomorrow morning,” he announced before he led him out of the shop, and Steve groaned because that was such a turn on. What was Tony
“It is. It’s a little Southern, but it’s shorter than ‘my studmuffin.’ Why, do you have a problem with it?” he asked with a teasing glint in his eye.
That moment of bliss only lasted a few moments, but it left him happy and warm and full of Tony’s love. He was hazy and giddy and not-all-there – his mind was still lingering on that kiss. “God I love you,” he breathed, his heart talking before his mind was even capable of thought.
“And look, Tony will be back tomorrow, so you can talk to him then,” Happy said with a knowing wink that made Steve blush. He gave the man another nod before he walked out of the café, and he definitely caught Happy’s satisfied expression.
“You know, the question I should have asked was, does the coffee taste better or worse in the mug?” Steve asked as he leaned back in his chair. He was starting to feel comfortable here and starting to feel more comfortable with Tony, and he could only see that leading to better things. After all, tomorrow it would be a week since he met him, so he had to be more comfortable by now.
“Well, fancy seeing you outside the coffee shop,” Tony remarked as he walked up next to Steve. He placed his hands in his pockets, rocking nervously onto the balls of his feet. “You know, I always thought you looked good in gym clothes, but you look even better in that shirt.”
Steve slid to his usual spot and he waved to Pete as he passed. Now that he knew he was there and he was related to Tony, he definitely wanted to acknowledge him. Sure he came here for Tony, but if Tony had a son and he wanted Tony to be in his life, then his son would be in his life too. He gave Tony’s butt a good long stare, noticing some of that bravado had returned to his hips, before he took a risk and turned to Pete. He saw how Pete and Tony had interacted the last couple times, and it was clear Pete was important to Tony, so he had a feeling chatting with Pete and showing interest in him would earn him brownie points with Tony.
Dinner at Tony’s favorite restaurant, a little local Italian place, had been just as magical. He name-dropped it once and Steve had an excellent memory and hoarded that name away for this specific reason. But despite his near perfect memory, he could barely even remember what he ate because all he remembered was Tony. He got to learn so much about the man who was stealing his heart. He learned that he was the previously famous Tony Stark, which was admittedly a shock because he had no idea, but in the end he had to assure Tony he didn’t actually care, which seemed important to Tony. But what he enjoyed hearing about most was about his life with Pete and the founding of Jumpstart. While they never resorted to feeding each other, they must have made for a pretty sickening display as they held hands, gazed into each other’s eyes, and absolutely played footsie under the table.
Steve leaned in with a smirk. “Well, I’ll say you’re the expert on my ‘All-American package,’” he whispered. It was raunchy and corny and horrible but he just had to.
“Well if it’s illegal, then I can let go and you can go back to work,” he offered with a teasing smile.
“Very…relaxed,” he smirked. “I heard a little rumor that your flat might be empty tonight, so I was thinking we should stay in.”
Steve laughed but happily drank his coffee as he heard Tony talk to the next guest. “Sorry for the delay, potential boyfriend and all, had to keep him in my thrall. What can I get you?”
“Of course I did,” Steve murmured as he reached for Tony’s hand. “Especially after last night.” He understood why Tony had to leave – it was a school night for Pete and they both had to work in the morning and they couldn’t bank on someone covering for Tony again so they could have a lazy morning after. He knew after they went back to his place Tony would have to leave after they were done being intimate, but letting Tony go when they were cuddling in the afterglow was one of the hardest things he’d ever had to do, and his heart had ached for the touch of this man since he left his bed. “My bed felt so empty,” he whispered.
The barista was visibly agitated. All the regulars could tell he was preoccupied and not his usual self. Something was clearly on his mind. Before his son left for school, he drilled him on yesterday’s encounter, looking for a misstep or a reason for why Steve didn’t come. Did he scare him off with his forward comments? Did he make too much of a deal about the uniform? Or, had something happened to him? He mentioned he was going to a meeting – had he been redeployed? Was yesterday the last chance he was going to see him?
Happy gave him a sad little smile. “Ah, you must be pretty new. Tony doesn’t work on Saturdays, so I cover him for the day.”
It didn’t feel like a Monday. It felt weird to go about his routine like normal when so much good had happened over the weekend. It felt weird to think that he had to go to work and do things that normal people did, when he felt anything other than normal. Because this weekend…it was the best weekend he could remember. Saturday was the magical day he spent with Tony, and nothing in his life could compare to how he felt during that date. The way Tony made him feel just by being around him…he felt happy and sexy and safe and comfortable and joyous and…maybe even loved. He couldn’t narrow it down to one feeling because it was so much more complicated and wonderful than that. And Tony did that for him, in a way that nothing else could. And even though he didn’t get to spend all day Sunday with him, after he left the shop he spent the rest of the night thinking about him and talking about him and texting him and positively glowing about him. And now he had a chance to see him again.
care.” The words were harsh, but there was an affection with them that Steve couldn’t quite place, but it definitely indicated familiarity. Now that he paid attention, that teen had actually been here every day. Tony had talked to him a few times after he left and interacted with him a bit yesterday, he just never really noticed before because he was more distracted with Tony.
Well Steve, can't say you handled it smoothly, but hopefully you fixed things enough to get back on track, and maybe figured out a little more on how to read Tony.
“Good choice again. Got a warm slice of coffee cake with plenty of cinnamon and some rum with your name on it,” he promised as he fished out the slice of coffee cake and charged his card.
He slid his credit card across the counter – he didn’t order anymore because he just trusted Tony knew what to order – and gave him a little smile back. “Sometimes I have to work Saturday mornings – make-up sessions and special requests, that kind of stuff – but I don’t have anyone scheduled for Saturday yet.” That was a lie: he purposefully cleared his Saturday yesterday for this date. “So same, just relaxing.”
He leaned up against the bar as Steve walked over, that smirk still present on his face. It was almost like he knew how much he liked it. “Same as yesterday? Or will you at least switch your pastry? I promise there are more options than a blueberry muffin.”
Hearing everyone congratulate Tony first and then Steve while they waited for their coffee was a little overwhelming but was also really nice. He never knew this many people had taken such an interest in their brewing romance – ha! Brewing - that was a good one! – but apparently they did. They were invested and involved and seemed so happy for them. Eventually Tony let Pete talk and he gushed to both of them about how happy he was and how he couldn’t wait until Saturday. He almost thought Pete was more excited than all of them, but as he caught eyes with Tony, he knew that there couldn’t be anyone more excited for this date than he was.
Tony finally brought his mug over with a very steady hand, and he could see there was more foam on the top than normal. “That great date last night also gets you a little coffee foam art – the worst thing to happen to coffee shops everywhere. But I made yours special, showing you my favorite part of our date last night.”
He let Tony make the coffee, and instead of wandering around the café again he moved to the other end of the counter and leaned forward against it, his arms crossed over his chest with elbows resting on the cool countertop. He came here to look at Tony after all, not the pictures on the walls. “So are you gonna tell me what’s in the Americano in case you’re gone again?” Steve asked. He managed to get his question out before he looked at Tony, and he was so grateful that he did, because now there was no way he could say anything coherent. Tony faced the espresso machine, and from his view at the counter he could see Tony’s body in full profile. His mouth went dry as he saw how Tony’s back curved right into this perfectly round butt. The jeans he wore framed it so perfectly and left nothing to the imagination. He could feel his heart thrumming in his chest as he stared. To think that had been hiding behind the tall counters this whole time and he had been missing that. His hands ached to reach out and hold those beautiful cheeks and he squeezed his hands tighter around himself to keep them in control.
Tony’s knees almost gave out at the huskiness of Steve’s voice, but his boyfriend held him up tightly. He swallowed past a dry lump in his throat and tried to fight against all of the blood rushing south at the idea of
Steve shook his head fondly, testing the water to make sure it was warm enough and grabbing a towel and washcloth to set next to the tub. “Actually sweetheart, once your feeling better, you’ll be the one begging for me. Not the other way around.” He raised a coy brow at his boyfriend and reached for Tony’s shirt. “Now hands up.”
Maria Stark hit that point once Tony became too wiley and unpredictable to show off at events. When he was younger, one smack to the head or a threat of further pain from his father was enough to keep him in line at all of the fancy dinners and fundraisers Maria put on. However, as he got older, Tony grew a set of balls and fought against
In one single movement, Steve had rolling them over so that they were chest to chest with Steve lying on top of Tony. His entire body was coiled tight, every muscle locked as he stared down at Tony. “I need you to tell me how long you’ve been feeling like someone’s been watching you, sweetheart. It’s important.”
He wanted to obliterate these fuckers for hurting what is his, and he wanted to burn the place to the ground.
“That’s it, look at you. I can’t wait to touch you, Tony. I’m going to make you scream, make you beg. You’ll be writhing by the time I get you worked up, by the time I get my mouth on you. Can you picture it? My mouth, my lips, my tongue, sucking you dry?” Tony whimpered at the filthy whispers Rogers spun next to Tony’s ear, his sweet breath so hot and deliciously close. His hand made a dirty slapping sound as it flew over his length. “Or maybe we’ll start with you on your knees. Your gorgeous mouth wrapped so tightly around my cock, your throat opening up to take everything I gave you. Would you like that?”
Steve smirked, kissing him chastely on the lips again. “I’m right here. I missed you too, Mr. Carbonell.”
Tony immediately sat up in his make-shift hospital bed, dismayed to find that he had been strapped down. “What the fuck did you do?”
Also, there's a lot going on in this chapter because everything is ramping up! The story will finish at 23 chapters....so we're nearing the end!
Tony clutched his chest In faux disbelief. “And here I thought that the love of my life would back me up under
“Steve found me in a run down motel in Salem. I thought that was the end of the line for me, that the General had found me.” Bruce shrugged and held a hand out to help Tony up from his chair. “But he just told me what a big fan of my work he was, and offered me protection.”
“Tony?” The voices sounded far away this time. Garbled. Harsh beeping filled his ears, sending him back to that dirty single hospital bed where they pumped him with enough morphine to fry his brain and then took it all away until he was left with only pain. Everything hurt again, but this time he couldn’t find an anchor. Couldn’t find Steve. Stark white explosions flashed behind his eyelids, and Tony sobbed as it burned.
He could feel the moment went Steve’s defenses shot up. His boyfriend bristled underneath his touch, but he didn’t move away, so Tony counted that as a win. “I think you should explain. Now.”
“Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr. Stark.” The man with the accent was back, gleefully reminding Tony that he had been kidnapped by a bunch of lunatics who wanted him to build weapons.
Steve swallowed thickly, as if the movement was painful, while Tony watched his Adam’s Apple bob up and down. He was stoic for another few seconds, then his shoulders slumped down heavily, the
“I was chosen as the head of this family after my father’s death. It’s not what I wished for. I had no choice.”
“Shh,” Steve soothed, nosing his way down Tony’s jaw. He sat back on his haunches, knees bracketing his boyfriend’s hips. He dipped his fingers underneath Tony’s shirt and splayed them against his abs, relishing in the way Tony sucked in a sharp breath at the contact. Steve was careful as he pulled his shirt over Tony’s head, then returned his boyfriend’s hands to the bed. “Keep them there, love.”
She shrugged happily, giving him a kiss on the cheek and pushing him out the door towards Steve. “He’s not here to defend it, so It’s mine now."
Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts. Any kudos/comments are always appreciated, and encourage me to keep it up :) Y'all have a wonderful week!
Both Tony and Bucky grimaced at the thought while Thor continued. “Friend Steven used his position as the Captain to free my brother from his debts, and assisted me in putting Loki through rehabilitation so that he could regain his mind. Once his body was purified of the wretched substance, I brought Loki home. I was back home assisting in negotiations between my father and brother when Friend Steven met you. I owe him a life debt, and I am bound to serve under a great man when called upon.”
Tony’s eyes widened as he leaned forward and shook his head. “What? No way. That’s two dollars more than last week.”
Tony grinned good naturedly and gave her a two finger salute from his wheelchair. “Message received, Darcy. I’ll make sure to keep my wild sexapades to a minimum until I’m all healed up.”
Steve cut him off with a searing kiss, plundering his tongue into Tony’s mouth and grinding Tony’s hips down onto his mounting erection. “Oh fuck, Tony, I love you too. I love you so much, sweetheart.”
Steve was still sitting in his truck outside of Tony’s apartment when his phone went off. Without taking his eyes off of the building, he answered. “What is it, Nat?”
Tony was becoming more and more agitated. The tingling was uncomfortable now, and he couldn’t stop himself from craning his neck to look around the room. “Like...like someone is watching us.”
Tony hummed in agreement, then risked taking a step forward. “So...you’ll let me fix that arm of yours? Before the mission?” He licked his lips. “Because, you know, it’s just dangerous going into something like that with the wiring all convoluted, the percentage of failure grows each day that it-“
of a document if I do say so myself.” Obie’s assessment of the end of his life was jarring, and Tony suddenly found himself very, very dizzy.
“So, Wilson, how did you end up joining the super secret boy band? Heard you were the first new recruit.”
.” Steve moved back to his feet and kissed the love of his life gently, then pulled him up as well so that he could tug his sweatpants down until they hit the tile. He followed this by pulling off the bandages across Tony’s arms and chest, depositing them into the small trash can.
Bruce noticed that he was awake and his eyes softened behind his glasses. “Tony, hi. How are you feeling?”
“Damn straight.” Tony sniffed haughtily, then softened his tone. “Thanks, kiddo. I really appreciate you taking care of all of that for me.”
bullshit with me, not here, not now.” Tony warned brutally, stepping into Steve’s space, shoving his palms against his boyfriend’s chest. “You want me to follow ridiculously
Bucky pushed himself to his feet and held out his hand, determination and trust carved out openly across his features. “‘Till the end of the line?”
Happy Monday! I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I've got up to ch. 12 written so far, and I'm still chugging along! Once I finish writing, I'll be updating twice a week.
Tony scratched at the back of his head nervously, but took the rolling seat next to Bucky. “Listen, before I take a look, I just…” he fiddled with a screwdriver, twirling it around expertly between his fingers. “I just wanted to apologize.”
That earned him another smile, and Steve took his hand, enjoying the way it fit perfectly with his own. “So, where are we going?”
At midnight, Tony was bored. He spun around in his chair, seeing how long he could balance a pencil between his lips and nose. Too bad he’ll never know the answer to that question, because Bruce smacked him upside the head after ten seconds.
She shrugged, not bothered in the slightest. “They raised the prices over the weekend. Eight ninety-five.”
Steve heaved one more time, emptying the contents of his stomach, and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. “They were on
As much as he wanted to reach down and take Rogers in his hand, or hell, even throw himself down onto his knees and swallow that beautiful cock down to the root, Tony forced himself to take a deep breath and throw on a smug smirk. It wasn’t exactly his plan to get off while leaving Rogers out to dry, but he was glad the opportunity presented itself. He felt sated and positively evil.
A shot rang out, a hiss slicing too close to his ear, and Steve's face was abruptly splattered with something warm and wet, a sharp pain in his chest immediately following. The dead weight in his arms and a sudden lightheadedness caused him to stumble backwards, crashing onto the rooftop with a sharp cry. A ringing sensation soaked into his ears until black spots danced across his line of vision.
Tony found himself smiling back and pulling up his sleeves to reveal the metal webbing across his wrist. “You got it, Cap. They aren’t really powerful just yet, I haven’t worked out a viable energy source for long term use, but for now, they basically let me direct small amounts of plasma to ignite a projection. It won’t kill anyone, but it will knock them on their ass if they get too close.”
that the young genius brought out in him. Back when they were kids, Steve might have been a sickly little runt, but he also had a way of lighting up every room he walked into. His “golly gee” and “oh shucks” attitude made old ladies swoon and mammas weak at the knees. He might have gotten into too many fights, but Bucky never hesitated to back him up because Steve only ever fought for the little guy, the ones who couldn’t stand up for themselves.
Tony nodded his head up and down, letting his thin goatee scrape against Steve’s sensitive skin, causing the older man to let out a hiss. He furrowed his brow as a familiar prickle started traveling along the back of his neck.
“Oh, I will be demanding pictures. This is something I have to see.” Tony laughed and held his mugs between his hands. “Who’s next?”
Thirty minutes later, he had his arms crossed over his chest while watching Natasha in her Black Widow mask interrogate the three Hydra members from behind the two-way mirror. Bucky huffed by his side. “Found ‘em staking out the Weapons Depot on Fifth. Haven’t gotten them to spill anything yet. Nat extracted a cyanide tooth from two of the fuckers. Looks like the third is too green for something like that.”
Well, no use beating around the bush now. He hopped in the truck and shut the door, waiting for the two Avengers to follow his lead. Once they were both inside the truck, he gave them his best Stark smile. “The Avengers need new gizmos and gadgets, Rogers. I’m your man. You can’t keep going on with the outdated equipment you’ve been using, someone’s going to get hurt. And Steve,
Bucky took a deep breath, checked over his shoulder, and let the air out when he turned back to Tony. “Your ma’s been calling.”
The rest of the briefing lasted three hours, and the sun had descended beneath the horizon. The Avengers laid out a detailed plan on when, where, and how they would take down Zemo’s operation.
Tony blinked, unsure of what he was asking. Did he think that the man they were holding captive with a gaping hold in his chest had somehow managed to call for help? “No…” He answered truthfully, hoping beginning to take root. Maybe the police had found him?
It was Clint’s turn to scowl. “What the hell does that mean? It’s what’s on his Driver’s License. It’s the name his apartment is listed under.”
“Copy that, Captain.” The faint click sounded in his ear, and Steve ground his teeth together. Tony was just a
Stevie had mulled over the information for a few minutes, then crouched down to the ground, where the twins were huddled up. Bruce had done a preliminary examination, and there were a few cracked ribs that were taped up, but no broken bones or head injuries were apparent. He told them that the Captain would decide where and how he would treat them further.
Before he touched Tony’s chest, he cleaned his feet, legs, and back, making sure to give the same tender attention to every part of his body. Tony didn’t even attempt to take the cloth from Steve or make a well-timed sex joke as he cleaned his half-hardened member, the heaviness in the air not to be cheapened by a quip. His deepest wounds very obviously stung, but still the duo kept silent, the air in the small bathroom wrought with the promise of the moment, each inhale and exhale of breath ingrained into each of their memories.
company?” Tony asked incredulously. He’d been playing his role of the dumbfounded victim well, but that threw him off his game.
He moved out to the hall, reaching back to keep the door from closing all the way, and fell down onto the couch the moment it was in sight.
“It was Barton and I, actually. You know how there is that one person in your life, that for whatever circumstances brought you together, they make you better? They always have your back?”
The whole ordeal couldn’t have lasted longer than ten minutes, because the rest of the Avengers pulled up behind them as soon as they got Thor inside. Bruce hopped out of their car with his medical bag and scurried in behind Thor.
Isn't Peter adorable? Man, I love that kid. I hope you all enjoyed this chapter, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
Tony knew that there was no way he could make weapons for Hydra. It would go against everything he ever believed in, and it would be a slap to The Captain’s face. The mysterious mob boss and his Commandos had worked tirelessly for three years to shut Hydra down. If Tony did what Hydra wanted, then there would be no stopping them. On the other hand, he couldn’t risk the lives of those running the Boston Marathon. The city had taken too much damage already from the attack in 2013. Nobody deserved to go through that again, and Tony wouldn’t be the reason another bomb went off in his city.
The next morning, Tony blinked slowly from where his head was resting atop Steve’s perfectly sculpted chest. This is what heaven must be like, Tony mused. To be so wrapped up in the person you love that the rest of the world just falls away, leaving the two of you basking in heat and pleasure. He hummed when Steve’s fingers carded their way through Tony’s hair, and he buried his face closer to his boyfriend.
, right? He’s been to the lab with me about a million times, so we know that’s safe. Come on, shove Sam awake and help me not fail out of school? Please?”
Red swam into his vision, and could practically feel the Captain taking over. He straightened in his seat, tilted his head side to side, cracking the joints in his neck loudly, and slammed the passenger side door, forcing Natasha out of the way. Steve’s fingers curled into a fist and he beat it against the dash. “He’s going after Tony.
With Bucky by his side, the pair sought out the darkened alleyway Zemo and his cronies liked to loiter around. Steve had picked up a loose lead pipe from a junkyard on the way, while Bucky grabbed an old dagger his father had left him. No one had been expecting the two of them to come waltzing into the alleyway, and they certainly hadn’t been prepared for the two of them to come in swinging, not bothering to ask questions. Before anyone could even think to react, three of the neighborhood bullies were unconscious at Zemo’s feet, and Bucky had their target in a chokehold, one hand wrapped tightly around Zemo’s wrists, pinned behind his back.
“But you didn’t, Stark.” Bucky argued. “Sure, you might have made the weapon that took my arm, but you didn’t hand it over to Hydra. It could have saved American lives overseas, but instead someone decided to be greedy and sell SI’s weapons to terrorists.” He pushed back his long hair with his other hand. “And I don’t know, I think you being with the Avengers is...meant to be, or some shit like that.”
Tony wasn’t sure how it happened, but he was furious, terrified, and turned on all at the same time. Rogers had absolute control over him, reminding Tony of this fact in sudden bouts of strength, but had yet to actually touch him.
Bruce sighed again, pushing up from his chair and disappearing behind the bedroom door for a few seconds before returning with the bottle of his pain reliever, a glass of water, and a first aid kit.
He and Sam sweated through a particularly painful workout before Clint, Bruce, and Nat had rendevoued at the house. His russian girlfriend was still pissed at him, a fact that was communicated by her pointedly sitting next to the archer rather than him. He would deal with her later, or more likely, she would deal with him later, after they had something to eat. Turns out there were a few boxes of leftover pizza, so they all settled in to watch Return of the Jedi while they waited for Steve to get back from Tony’s. Steve was
to him that he’d been able to meet Steve and his team. The Avengers had become his friends, and Steve...he was Tony’s rock, his true north. His father and Obie wanted to erase the type of person Tony had become, to discredit all that Steve, Pepper, Rhodey, Bucky, Bruce, Clint, Sam, Nat, Thor, Peter, and Harley had helped turn him into. And that was such utter and complete
“It really means a lot that you would trust me with that. Because, well, there’s something I need to talk to you about too. Something I’ve been meaning to tell you-”
Thank you to everyone who has commented/left kudos/bookmarked this story. I LOVE all of your feedback, and it makes me giddy to know that you're enjoying it so far :)
He immediately shook his head, “What? No, no, I couldn’t put you out like that. I’m fine walking.” Tony was already half-hard talking to Steve, he couldn’t imagine how much worse his body would betray him in the confined space of a car.
Tony blinked a few times and stretched, wincing as the movement caused a dull ache to flare up. Before he could think to look for some of his medication, a soft knock sounded at the door, and it opened slowly to reveal Steve. “G’morning,” Tony drawled, exhaustion clear in his voice.
A nauseous spell hit Tony hard at the thought of anyone targeting Pepper, Rhodey, or Happy, and for a moment he thought he was going to be sick. He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, matching Rogers’ breathing patterns without thinking about it. In one, two three, out one, two, three. The previously-settled rage at his circumstances came back, boiling to the surface. He was in this mess, in danger, because of fucking Rogers.
Bruce shook his head and waved him off. “If something happens, Tony, I’ll make sure to let you know. Sleep well, and let Thor drive you to campus tomorrow.”
With each generation of Rogers came new expertise, advancements, and expansion for the Howling Commandos. James’ son, Daniel, grew their family business out of Brooklyn and into Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, effectively owning the stretch of coastline, along with the shipyards and docks that came along with the territory. Try as they might, Dr. Erskine’s formula remained the gang’s most guarded secret, and the exclusivity and incredible loyalty of the members was tested, yet held steady time and time again in the face of kidnappings, ransoms, and torture throughout the years.
And then Steve came into his life. Steve showed him what it was like to love another person with every bone in your body and every fiber of your being that the rest of the world fell away. The kind of love that makes your toes curl from just the sweetness of a simple kiss, the kind that pushes all insecurities and fear and worries out the door with a promise you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, will be kept.
were hurt.” His voice was rough now, and Tony could see a watery mist pooling at the corner of Steve’s eyes.
“We are, but it doesn’t mean that we’re moving past finding out who was behind the kidnapping. You know that, right?”
band of cronies, the Avengers, that’s who.” His godfather stepped back, returning to pace the length of the small room, which Tony could now recognize as a closed off basement. “Research can only get me so far, however, and they’re pretty damn good at covering their tracks. But I want to find the Captain and his little sidekicks, and watch them
“Bruce is right,” Steve agreed with a nod before turning to Clint. “Call Coulson and keep him updated on our plan. But make sure that by the time he arrives, everyone is out of there. No contact whatsoever.”
Steve grit his teeth, but bit into his food just the same. He was silent for a while as he drove on, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. He got like this sometimes, quiet and brooding as he deliberated over an important choice. Even Tony, who was known for his incessant banter, knew better than to interrupt when Steve closed off from his friends.
By the time he reached the make-shift conference room at the warehouse, his entire team had settled into their seats. Steve always sat at the head of the table, with Bucky to his right and Sam to his left, but Sam had been kind enough to allow Tony to fill that space now. Steve had to fight the flush of pride and sense of absolute
Sam gave him a toothy grin. “So thanks, for bringing my buddy back, Tony. Back to the guy I met at some hole-in-the-wall dive bar.”
His team and the Maximoff twins shuffled out of his way quickly, the thunderous expression on his face enough to send anyone reeling backwards. He stormed towards the front entrance with Bucky on his heels, who grabbed a set of keys from the rack. His best friend held them up with a nod. “I’ll drive.”
That was news to Tony. He couldn’t help raking his eyes over the man once again, then catching himself and fighting the flinch of remembering his own father’s reprimand of just exactly what he thought of Tony ogling other men. He played it off with a shrug. “I guess it’s just surprising. All of my students are even younger than I am. I never pegged you as one yourself.”
As soon as the light came back on, dozens of messages and missed call notifications popped up on the screen. Steve’s heart rate spiked as he read through Thor’s messages, and the blood fell too quickly from his face. He jumped towards the corner of the room where a wastebasket sat, dropping his head into it and upheaving the donuts they ate earlier that morning.
Tony sighed and nodded, suddenly exhausted. Steve moved closer, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and pulling him squarely into his lap so that they were chest to chest and Tony’s legs bracketed Steve’s hips. He cupped the younger man’s face between his big hands and pressed a deep, long, lingering kiss there before pulling back and resting their foreheads together. Tony breathed in Steve’s sweet, soft pants.
Tony’s moan was positively obscene as he took a bite, and he delighted in the fact that Steve’s ears burned a bright pink. “There’s no use in denying me,” he reasoned with a lazy shrug. “I’ll be working on it with or without your help. At least if I’m with you, I’ll get a cool nickname.”
A few moments of silence. “Look, I don’t doubt your ability to watch out for him, I don’t. But Rhodes, you’re leave ends in three days, and Pepper, you have class and finals and your own life. He’ll be safer at my house, where he won’t have to be alone.”
The moment they entered the warehouse, Bucky grabbed Steve’s shoulder and spun him around. “Alright, what just happened back there? I thought you wanted to keep Tony away from us a little while longer.”
He tried to stomp down his embarrassment at having to be rescued like a fucking damsel in distress, sucking in enough air to feign confidence as he spun around, his brain shorting out as he did. At first, all he saw was a very broad, very muscular chest, covered in a tight grey sweater with a navy blue overcoat. His eyes traveled upwards and Tony took a hesitant step back.
Tony had somehow managed to convince the two that they could wait for Steve in MIT’s engineering lab, and a black F-150 had crashed straight into the left side of the car on the way there. Bruce had been knocked out instantly, but only walked away with a broken collarbone and a fractured wrist while Sam had a few broken ribs and a little internal bleeding that they were able to take care of right away.
But his intensity was getting on Tony’s last nerve. Whatever promises he made fell short whenever Tony remembered that he wasn’t here by choice. Sure, Rogers said that he just wanted to get to know him, for a chance at something more between them, but it had only been a few days, and he already missed his friends. Surprisingly enough, Tony also missed his work.
Tony forced his eyes open, wincing at the increasing light streaming through the hospital windows. “M’mf.” A deep chuckle answered him, and Tony burrowed his way closer into Steve’s side, gasping when the movement made his chest feel like it was splitting open again.
That’s not to say that everyone in Tony’s life were monsters. Jarvis was the closest thing he ever had to a real father, but even he couldn’t risk standing up to Howard or Maria, or they would have kicked him out of Tony’s life forever. Jarvis did his best to protect him from the worst aspects of his family, and Tony would be forever grateful, but his many scars and bruises from his time growing up didn’t fade quite as easily as he’d hoped.
, I want updates every hour. And I don’t care if its an hour before my presentation, if something goes wrong, I want to be notified and I’ll be dropping everything to come and help. I need you to promise that you’ll call if you need me, Steve.”
Steve didn’t move underneath the covers with the young genius, choosing to rather sit on the edge of the bed and tuck Tony in. He moved his damp hair out of his eyes, promising himself that he would ask Clint to give Tony a haircut tomorrow. Steve leaned down and pressed a light kiss to his temple, whispering, “I’ll be right outside the door when you wake up. Call for me, and I’ll hear you. I love you.” He didn’t get a response back, because Tony was already blissfully asleep, and Steve was able to breathe for the first time in a week.
“He punched him right in the face, broke his nose and everything.” Steve was smirking, eyes alight with laughter. “And then he shot an arrow through his bulletproof vest to trap him against the wall. Then Clint strolled right up to Coulson and stuck his tongue down his throat.”
Tony swallowed thickly as his eyes tracked down his boyfriend’s tanned skin. “My final project. You called him an ‘it.’”
Tony thumbed his half-way empty coffee cup, trying to decide if he wanted to lie to seem older. Somehow, he thought Steve would be able to see past his bullshit. “I’ll be twenty-one in a few months.”
“Stay.” He whispered, a voice that seemed to belong so fittingly to him, yet at the same time sounded like a combination of every other man Steve had met during his 25 years. “Stay for me.”
Natasha’s knee was bouncing almost obsessively, lightly tapping the end of the table, and it was starting to fry Steve’s nerves. Both she and Bruce were acting stranger than usual, and it made him uneasy. “Alright, Nat, tell us what you found.”
The back of his neck warmed significantly, and he pawed at it. Tony stepped forward, cursing again as he tripped over his worn out sneakers and catching himself on the black marble counter. “Uh, right, sorry. Sorry.” Tony huffed out a breath, fumbling for his wallet, held together by scotch tape. “I’ll take a large black coffee with one, no, no, two shots of espresso.”
Bucky frowned and leaned his head towards the darkened alley for a peek. “You’re fixin’ up some kids while wearing the Avengers’ masks? You’re givin’ them fuckin’ nightmares, goddammit!”
“Tony had nothing to do with that!” Steve snapped. If Bucky thought Tony was involved in the attack that took his arm, he would have to physically restrain his best friend from going after Tony.
Thor clapped a hand on Peter’s shoulder, shaking him a bit, and his voice boomed. “I believe this young man would make a fine ruler, as long as he has a clever council in his corner.”
“Stark,” Bucky cut off with an annoyed huff. “Yes, you can get your greedy little paws on my arm.” He took a deep breath, rolling his eyes upwards in an attempt to pray for patience (which, okay, rude), before meeting Tony’s eye. “You said you can make it stop hurting, right?”
“Still difficult, but we’ll find the evidence we need, Tony. I’ll find whoever hurt you, and I’ll kill them myself, I promise.”
An hour later, Tony led Steve through the doors of MIT’s engineering lab practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. Steve’s smile matched his boyfriend’s, the enthusiastic energy spilling over in waves.
“Fine,” Tony grumbled. He couldn’t complain really, he knew he wouldn’t really make it to the action of tonight's mission. At least he was able to make sure they were set up for success, and was even able to get to know Bruce and Thor a little better during their time in the warehouse.
Clint suggested that Tony dress up; apparently Rogers had something special planned for dinner. Tony decided to go along with it. He trimmed his goatee a little closer than normal and added a hint of product to his hair, playing around with a loose curl so that it gave him a skinny Clark Kent look.
Bucky tilted his head towards the hallway. “Nat picked up a smuggler off the streets. Took him to the warehouse for interrogation.”
Tony narrowed his eyes, leaning back minisculely into Thor, but his father felt the movement and tightened his grip. Tony called on his willpower to not wince.
Thor, that blessed greek god of a man, must have sensed Tony’s mounting distress, because he snatched both sets of hands away from him and pushed between the three men. Thor was menacing in a way Obie and Howard could never dream of being, radiating power and nobility. “We will be taking our leave now. Tony has his presentation to attend.” He told them darkly, pushing forward until both men skidded back along the sidewalk.
Steve grinned at that, unable to fight back the smile that came from remembering the day in the coffee shop. “I can promise you, sweetheart, that I’ve never felt anything like it before I met you. My mind was basically screaming at me to wrap you up and never let you out of my sight. But somehow, I didn’t think that was the best approach to get you to talk to me again.”
He pulled the blanket off to reveal his masterpiece, a perfectly round shield that looked almost identical to the one he had now, just a thousand times more durable and deadly. The color scheme was sleeker as well.
“Hey, you just ragged on me for saying the same damn thing!” Clint protested, and Sam slapped him across the head again just for the sake of it.
Tony slapped him on the back, the only way he knew how to help someone who was having trouble breathing. It didn’t exactly help, but the sharp pain brought his focus back to Tony. Steve ran his hands through his hair and pulled slightly, eyes still captivated on the computer. “Who is that?”
This is the end of Part I. I have chapters 5 and 6 written, so I should still update next Monday. I'm thinking this story will be between 8-10 chapters.
“I’m fine.” At the disbelieving look, Tony repeated himself. “I’m fine, Steve. I promise. We just need to talk about a few things.”
orders? Talk to me as my boyfriend, Rogers, not this holier-than-thou perfect little soldier who decides what I can and can’t do. I created the weapons
Steve fought the urge to roll his eyes. “No one knows who I am, Buck. And since Schmidt is dead, they won’t know who you are either. As long as we stop them early on, things will be fine.”
Steve huffed, swallowing hard as he moved his gaze back out the passenger window. When they started moving again, the dim lights from the lone street lamps flickered by. “As long as the cities we love are in danger, the Avengers will be around to protect them.”
helping Sam and Bruce. He struggled weakly, trying to pry himself away from their tight grips. “Wait, no! My friends...they need help!”
A strangled sob was the only sound in the room once Steve freed Tony’s cock and swallowed it down to the root. He didn’t waste any time in taking his boyfriend apart with his throat and tongue, inching his fingers back towards Tony’s hole, teasing but not yet penetrating. With quick hands, Steve blindly grabbed for his bottle of lube and slicked up his fingers, then returned them to their target and pressed in with the tip of his index finger. Tony hissed at the welcome intrusion, then ground his hips down to demand more. Steve wasn’t in the business of denying Tony anything, so he worked his finger to the knuckle before adding a second. He scissored and curled and stretched Tony open, occasionally brushing against the bright bundle of nerves, maddeningly slow if Tony’s pleads were anything to go by, all the while licking and sucking at the head of his cock.
“Then I want my phone and laptop back. Now.” Then, as an afterthought, “and something for dinner. Saltimbocca di Pollo alla Romana.” His favorite dish from his childhood, the only thing his mother had ever done right.
“Protect me? Steve, I’m fine!” Tony shook his head, throwing Steve’s hands off of him as he stepped back into the bedroom. “Is this about me thinking someone is watching me? It’s stupid! I’m just being paranoid!”
It didn’t make sense for Steve to be jealous. They hadn’t even gone on their first date yet, he had no claim over Tony. Unfortunately, his gut was telling him differently. For some reason, Tony was
trusted him like this before, like he was someone to be depended on in critical situations, such as the missions the Avengers encountered. Usually, once someone got it into their heads that Tony was weak, injured, or no longer useful, people tended to ignore whatever came out of his mouth after the fact.
? The sole heir to Stark Industries? The same weapons manufacturer that secretly deals to terrorists? Like the ones that blew my
“You’re into it?” Steve asked incredulously. “I tell you that I basically had one of the members of my
Steve was able to calm him down a little by shoving their foreheads together and promising Tony that he would take care of it, but he wouldn’t lay back down or breathe normally again until they were on speaker phone with Agent Coulson from the FBI. Steve winced at the suspicious look Tony shot his way when Coulson recognized Steve immediately, but ignored it. They could have this conversation when Tony was feeling better. Preferably feeling better in Steve’s bed where he could ensure that the young genius couldn’t get kidnapped by any more dangerous terrorists. Or run away from the conversation. Both seemed unnecessarily probable.
“Your not just being paranoid!” Steve snapped in a way that had Tony reeling. Steve had never even raised his voice at him before. “I’m trying to protect you, Tony, so I need you to listen to me very carefully.” He must have taken in the hurt expression on Tony’s face, because the hard lines marring his handsome features softened and he stepped forward and cupped his cheeks. “Sweetheart, I love you. I’m asking you to trust me right now, okay? Please, put on your shoes, follow me out to my truck, and I’ll take you back to my place. You’ll finally get to meet my friends. You’ve been wanting to do that, right?”
Also, that impromptu kiss was taken from Teen Wolf (another guilty pleasure of mine), so I have no idea if it actually works.
They spent the next thirty minutes or so chatting and walking around the store while Tony picked up items here and there, his hands never able to be completely still. The younger man didn’t talk much, but Steve had a feeling that would change once Tony felt a little more comfortable around him, something he fully intended to pursue. He learned that Tony earned his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, then a masters in physics, and two doctorates in biomedical and civil engineering. Currently, he was working on completing his third and final doctorate in computer engineering.
“What?” Clint asked, obviously frustrated now. “No! You gave me an order to stop, and I followed it.”
“Hell yeah it does!” Clint cheered, pumping a fist in the air. Natasha clipped him on the back of the head.
They both hesitated, so Clint stepped forward, “Hey, I’m not going to let anything else happen to you, okay? I’m going to need both of you to trust us. Can you do that?”
long. They were at least able to shorten it by half through their next round of research, and then Steve cut it down to only a few potential suspects with his creepy accurate ‘instinct’ thing. The man really was a freak of nature when it came to knowing when something is right or wrong.
Tony hummed his assent. Thor sat in the too-small chair, propping his feet up on the bed as Tony settled in, and intertwined his own fingers before laying them across his chest.
Pepper held him a little tighter, and he appreciated the comfort. “You are wonderful, Tony. Just the way you are. And if Steve can’t see that, then that’s his loss.” She pulled back to look him in the eye. “Just try to give him a chance, okay? He seems like a really nice guy.”
When Bucky, Natasha, Clint, and Sam approached his desk warily, sliding a 4x6 photograph in front of him, Steve saw red.
Tony’s eyes flickered up to the mob boss’ relaxed face to confirm he was still asleep, then brought his gaze back down. Tattoos littered the smooth skin, and Tony found himself reaching out a hand to trace the patterns. Of course, when he realized what he was doing, he snapped it back, mortified that his body tried moving without his permission.
“I was sent here to retrieve my brother, to talk sense into him. I met our dear Captain during my travels.” Tony strained to keep his eyes open, eager to hear about Steve. “He had many connections here in the States, and it did not take us long to locate him. Unfortunately, Loki was in a rather precarious position.” Thor rubbed at the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. “My brother had found himself entertwined with a drug cartel, hooked on a hallucinogenic known as LSD.”
He was surprised to see Rogers, hands curled in his pockets and looking annoyingly unaffected at the sight of Tony in lingerie, which left him even angrier. “Get out or else-”
The megawatt smile Steve flashed him made Tony’s toes curl, and he couldn’t help but grin back. “I’ll walk with you while you finish up.”
Stane writhed against Bucky, his screams muffled by the gag. But there was nobody that could save him now that the Avengers were finally taking their revenge.
After that, it was all a blur. Logically, he knew they must be running. He knew they must be moving fast, but Tony’s brain wasn’t working at the speed it should have been. All he really remembered was Steve shouting directions at Bucky, then shouting at Tony to stay awake. He knew the moment they stepped outside because the rush of the frigid, waning winter air slammed into them, and he gasped in relief. He was free.
A faint cracking sounded on the other line, and Rhodey muttered under his breath. “Well, just be careful, alright Tones? Pepper told me about how one of the New York gangs showed up there in Boston.”
“Don’t fight me on this right now.” He warned, low and dangerous so that Bucky knew to drop it. His best friend grit his teeth together but nodded. Steve swallowed, sending him a grateful look. “Tony’s things can be moved to my room. He doesn’t have much, mainly clothes and any books you see.” He smiled down at his boyfriend. “All of his projects strewn about can be moved to the MIT robotics lab. DUM-E can go there too. Pepper can help with that.”
“I don’t know what it was,” Steve admitted “but God am I grateful for it, because it brought me to you, and I’ve never been happier.” He felt his heart open up again until it almost hurt it was so intense. He pressed his lips onto Tony’s, desperate to share some of that love before he burst. But when Tony opened his mouth to allow him entrance, he felt the same warmth pour from Tony too. It was like neither of them had enough room for their own feelings, but in that intimate space between them, where their lips connected, those feelings blended together into one perfect emotion, one perfect love, that filled them completely.
“Oh, yeah,” he agreed. He was already here, and it would be rude not to order something after walking in just because Tony wasn’t there. Besides, what if Happy told Tony about this – that would be mortifying and tipping his hand far sooner than he wanted. He walked up to the counter and worked on pulling his card out. “I just don’t know what I usually get. It’s some version of an Americano.”
When they finally broke the kiss, they kept their foreheads pressed together as they looked into each other’s eyes. “I want to be your boyfriend,” Tony murmured, and Steve rewarded his answer with a soft peck on his lips. “And Steve…thank you.”
He looked up at him in shock. “Ask him out? Seriously Bucky? After all this shit you want me to ask him out?”
He seemed to blush further, those red cheeks just bringing out the flecks of color in his eyes even more. “I make nicknames for people, it’s a thing. It’s not—oh look, more customers!” he stammered nervously before he dashed off to the register.
He distinctly heard someone in the line behind him whisper “smooth”, and he would have laughed if he wasn’t so focused on Tony’s reaction. It was a little complicated to read – he definitely saw shock and indecision and excitement, and then a bunch he hadn’t learned yet. He was getting good at reading some of Tony’s facial expressions, but he definitely hadn’t mastered them all.
Tony sighed. “I can’t even tease that it wasn’t. This weekend was…it was perfect, Steve.” He grabbed his hands and held them before he leaned over to kiss him on the lips. If Steve had to pick a word to describe that kiss, it would almost be…lovingly, but it was still too soon for that kind of description, right?
“Well good. Looks like your seat is open then, and I’ll bring your coffee right over,” Tony promised, and Steve had no issues sliding into his usual perch that allowed him to watch the beautiful dance that was Tony making coffee. Sometimes the music would hit just right and Tony would start dancing slightly to it while he waited for the espresso to drip, and Steve lived for those moments.
He could feel that sharp inhale of the room again. The audience was making him way more nervous than he already was, and it was throwing off all his plans for the day. He couldn’t understand why they were so invested and honestly he wished they would mind their own business. He had half a mind to let them skip ahead of him, but he knew that wouldn’t solve anything and would just look suspicious. But maybe he had a better chance of it when he was sitting at the counter?
Tony buried his face into Steve’s shirt, and Steve let him have whatever time he needed to pull himself together, because that was some heavy stuff he just dropped on him. In the army, they taught you to cut through the bullshit and find the truth, and this was the truth for Tony. Even though losing the company was one of the best things that had ever happened to him, it happened because of a betrayal, and that was hard to accept no matter how many years ago it happened. He continued to press kisses into Tony’s hair as he rocked him gently, letting him know he was there for him as he processed. He lost track of how long it was, but he didn’t care. He would call out sick from work if he had to. Tony needed him more, and he was content to stay right here as long as Tony needed it.
Tony nodded as he opened his eyes to meet Steve’s, and he felt Tony’s thumb rub across his cheek. “I am. Because of today…I met you, and you’re
Clint’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion, but he must have sensed the importance of the question. “I only tailed him for a week, Cap. I tracked his movements, kept an eye out for who he talked to, and memorized his routine. Tony Carbonell attends his doctoral classes twice a week for three hours, teaches an undergrad course on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at eleven a.m., and spends any free time he has either at his apartment or in the University’s engineering lab. The only people he was in contact with during that week were Virgina Potts, an associate, Peter Parker, a student he’s tutoring, and you, Boss.”
. And they were as horrifyingly evil as before. If Tony didn’t do what they wanted, they were going to kill thousands of people. But if he did...there was no telling what kind of damage they could do. New York was still hurting from the devastation Hydra brought a few years back. Tony suddenly wished for the Captain to reappear and save the day again. He stopped them once, he could do it again.
Tony licked his lips and smirked with a harsh gleam in his eye. “So, Typhon didn’t fall in love with Zeus in 365 days.” No matter what Rogers’ reasoning for it, there was no way Tony would succumb to the man’s wishes. If Typhon could still rebel, then so could Tony.
He kept his eyes lowered as he sauntered forward, stepping carefully and slightly baring his neck until he reached the wall of muscle in front of him. Tony reached a finger up to trace the buttons on Rogers’ black shirt, careful not to actually touch the skin while popping open the first two with delicious intent.
They all turned to look at him, with various expressions. Bucky looked more pissed off than anything, while Clint was confused, maybe even a little hurt that Steve had inserted himself into the operation. Natasha just raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow, but otherwise kept her face blank.
Sam gave him a shaky grin, swallowing heavily. “I’m good, man. I just...I just wanted to say that I’m-“
Tony leaned back in his chair and tapped a finger against the file in front of him. He met Steve’s eyes and held his gaze. “It means that you’ll be stopping a major player in human trafficking. It means you’ll dismantle their operation, and save all of the victims and return them to their families. It means you’ll be doing what the Avengers do best.”
The Avengers didn’t know it yet, but Tony was out for revenge, and he planned to do it by making sure his new friends were outfitted with everything they needed to make the inner circle at Stark Industries pay for what they did to Tony. He already had plans for a new, more durable and aerodynamic shield for Steve, a weaponized bow and explosive arrows for Clint, a deadly electric baton for Natasha, a set of wings for Sam, and fixing Bucky’s monstrosity of a metal arm. Seriously, that thing needed a thorough cleaning and an upgrade. Plus, Tony needed to have a nice sit down chat with Thor and figure out his weapon of choice. He deserved nice things too.
Bucky grunted his agreement and tapped a finger to his comm unit. “I would say we’ve got another hour and a half. Stay down until we give the signal.”
Steve examined him out of the corner of his eye, admiring how the shadows of the setting sun danced across his face. “I wanted to. Gives me an excuse to spend a little bit more time with you.”
He nodded, burying his face into Steve’s chest. “Yeah, I know.” Tony pulled Steve’s arm around his shoulders and spun around towards the laptop. “JARVIS, wait until you hear about Steve’s art classes. He’s fantastic.”
The man slowly wading in and out of the no-doubt frigid water was breathtaking in a way that left Steve feeling as if Bucky had abruptly socked him in the stomach. His frame was more lean than thin, with the kind of muscles that were hard-earned, like one would get from working on a farm, or in a garage. The sun melted beautifully across the lines of his body, giving him an almost ethereal glow, and his blue and black swim trunks clung to his legs and curve of his ass. It took some silent convincing on his part, but finally Steve was able to tilt the binoculars upwards to take in the man’s face when he turned. He was struck by how young the man looked, with a poor amount of stubble littering his jawline and a playful smirk tilting his sinful lips upwards. Steve couldn’t tell the color of his eyes from this far away, but he found himself fantasizing about a light hazel gaze staring down at him from a few inches above as the man’s lean body writhed and worked itself on Steve’s cock, taking his own pleasure as Steve raked his hands and nails across the man’s back, marking his territory.
Steve shook his head, not quite ready for humor. “He’ll be safer with the Avengers around. At least the ones I trust with him right now.” He knew that comment wouldn’t be received well, but he hadn’t expected Bucky to gnash his teeth together and lean forward to smack Steve across the back of the head. “Hey!”
“Detailed my ass.” Bucky mumbled in annoyance as he flipped off the television, tightening his grip around Nat’s waist and pulling her closer. Peggy’s cousin didn’t give out any of the good stuff, like how almost one thousand cuts had been sliced into Stane without him losing too much blood, the bucket of water sitting by the door that they used to drown him in, or how not just his still beating heart was ripped from his chest, but both eyes were also torn from their sockets.
Bruce had already headed back inside to grab his bag, but paused as he lifted the strap to his shoulder. “Excuse me? Steve ordered you to make sure all of the victims were taken to the ambulances. They should be at a hospital!”
As he stripped off his clothes and raked through the hangers of items to try on, he froze when something with black lace caught his eye. Tony narrowed his eyes and brought the piece to the front of the pile. He could see straight through the thin material, which he guessed would barely reach three or so inches down his thighs. Tony hesitated, but the softness of the lace was too tempting to ignore.
It was a few more hours until Clint came into the hospital room to give them the all clear. The FBI found three bombs planted directly along the starting line of the marathon, and if it wasn’t for Tony, they could have gone off at any time, regardless if the detonator was destroyed or not.
AND THEY MEET AGAIN. I hope you guys didn't think Tony would just jump into Steve's arms after so many years away...I always love a bit of angst :)
that I was gay, ya know? It gave him another reason for cutting me off. I honestly don't know if there is anything else he could do at this point.”
“I…” he thought back, a little confused at how protective Steve was being right now. “It’s nothing, really. It’s stupid.”
The norse god of a man reached out to grasp Tony’s forearm lightly in his personal ‘brothers in arms’ handshake. Tony smiled weakly at him and squeezed back, then stepped away and rushed into the Engineering building.
Woah it's the middle of the week! I finally have the rest of my chapter planned out, so I'm writing quicker than before. If I keep it up, I'll try to update twice a week. No promises though!
Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to know the details of the mess she was talking about. He didn’t like picturing anyone in that sort of situation.
decided to raise the prices? Usually, he just saved money by making the shitty stuff at home, only letting himself indulge in the coffeeshop every other Monday, but he couldn’t stock back up on the bare essentials at the store until he got paid later that evening.
“None of this is your fault.” Steve insisted vehemently, letting a hint of his “Captain” voice seep through. That earned him a wide-eyed gaze from Tony. “You were only trying to make your father proud of you, that’s it. The blame falls on whoever is selling SI’s weapons to terrorists, and them alone.” He reached out to grip Tony’s chin lightly, willing him to understand. “I will find out who’s behind this, and I will make them pay. No one will ever hurt you again.” Steve sealed his promise with a kiss, binding them together the best way he knew how. He left delicate kisses along his cheeks, trailing upwards with delicate precision.
He might have lost about 90% of his shame early on, but the kind of intimacy that set the tone during the bath Steve gave him was something he’s never experienced before. In a way, it was another outward expression of love. Steve was good at those. Tony on the other hand? Not so much. Tony wanted to fight and crawl up to his same level, to help Steve understand that Tony loved him as fiercely as Steve did him.
So he made a plan. He was a genius, after all. One that would keep Hydra from getting their hands on SI’s weapons while keeping the people in Boston safe. If he was lucky, maybe he could take out enough of Hydra that the Avengers had a chance of ridding the streets of any strays.
Bucky swore loudly and pulled out his phone to call Bruce while Steve knelt down beside the girl. “This is my friend, did you see what happened?” He asked as calmly as he dared. All he really wanted to do was grab each one of these kids by their scrawny necks and demand that they tell him everything, but that kind of thinking wasn’t going to help Thor, and it certainly wasn’t going to help him find Tony.
Tony was suddenly very aware of a mammoth presence behind him, and he automatically stiffened, keeping his eyes forward. “Throw in two blueberry muffins, a piece of pumpkin bread, and a large latte as well.” The man’s voice didn’t leave any room to argue, so the barista nodded warily and put in the order. A large hand reached around his shoulder and dropped a twenty onto the counter, and Tony wasn’t able to keep from flinching away as the open hand neared his face when it pulled back.
Happy Monday!! I just wanted to say thank you all for reading/giving kudos/commenting on this story, it's been really encouraging and it definitely gives me the motivation to keep chugging along :)
His eyes widened, and Steve could see him swallow nervously. “I was coming out of the dining hall across the way from an early breakfast,” Harley jerked his head in the general direction, “when I saw someone running into the building and this guy on the ground. It’s pretty early, so no one else was really on campus, so I came over to see why he wasn’t getting up, and found him like this.”
, and Sam was coughing up blood as he tried to undo his seatbelt, calling out to both Tony and Bruce. God, Tony’s chest hurt so bad. It was like he was on fucking
Stane grinned, malicious and self-satisfied. “I wasn’t about to let him leave SI to you, Stark. It belongs to me. While you were in your little presentation, I took care of everything.”
Tony’s cheeks visibly flushed, and his caramel brown eyes widened in confusion. “You really want to uh...hang out more?”
A bubble of laughter escaped his throat, and he was pleased when the movement didn’t hurt as bad as he expected. “Honestly, I’m not even sure I would have objected all that much. Have you
Natasha and Clint stood at the front of the conference table Monday morning, flipping through the projector slides and detailing out Zemo’s operation to the rest of the team.
But Tony had Steve, and the Avengers. He trusted his friends to get him out of this mess, one way or another. Maybe he could talk to his dad before he changed the will, anything to keep him from returning to SI, where someone was
People were still screaming around him, and the sound of gunfire was almost deafening. He just wanted it to stop.
, and if it weren’t for the missing tell-tale nausea spells, Tony would think that he was reliving his one monumentally failed attempt at drinking himself under the table during his first semester after arriving at MIT. But no, this pain was different, more distinct. Tony wanted to
He hovered slightly over the bed, and Tony gave his chest a little push so that he would back up a few steps. “I’m fine, Underoos, and how many times have I told you to call me Tony?” He jutted his chin out towards the two Avengers. “Are these guys giving you a hard time?”
It had started off like any other, really. He had stayed over at Natasha’s place, but they had gotten into a fight because he apparently used the last of her
Once they were gone, Steve and Bucky helped him into the bathroom, setting him down on the closed toilet seat while Steve began running the bath. “I am more than capable of showering on my own, Steven Grant Rogers.” He gritted, crossing his arms over his chest with a small wince. “I do not need a bath, nor do I need help with one.”
Bucky snickered and they both hauled Thor upwards, then started making their way towards the van. “Something like that, kid. Get back to class.”
know. But reconciling his mind with his heart were two different issues all on their own. “I know, Buck. It’s just hard, especially after what happened.”
As they opened up the sedan’s doors to step in, Natasha came sprinting out of the warehouse and knocked on the hood of the car with an open palm. “Wait!”
Tony couldn’t help but grin, always happy to hear that he actually meant something to someone. It wasn’t that he necessary
Thanks again to everyone who has followed this story! Every kudos/comment/message has given me the encouragement to FINISH this story and do right by the characters.
Thor stood up in reverence, crossed a fist over his heart and bowed. “Friend Tony, this gift shall be cherished for the rest of my days.”
Tony panted, his lungs expanding as he greedily sucked in the humid air. He swallowed thickly and whined as his body demanded release. Rogers gave a low growl and ushered him back against the tile wall, his hands coming up to rest on either side of Tony’s head, caging him in. A voice in the back of Tony’s mind was pleased that Rogers was still respecting his promise and not reaching down to take what he so obviously wanted without permission.
“I think I should be the one asking that question.” Steve mumbled into the young genius’ hair. “When do you present?” He set him down, but kept his arms snaked around Tony’s waist, fingers dipping just along the waistline of his jeans.
Strong hands were suddenly holding him up, cupping his cheeks. “Tony, sweetheart.” This wasn’t the Captain speaking anymore, it was Steve. His Steve. “Open your eyes for me. Hey, hey.” With great difficulty, Tony did. The movement made him tired, but he found enough strength to speak and hold the device in his hand up.
That at least got Steve to open his cerulean blue eyes, Tony’s new favorite color for obvious reasons, though he had yet to move from his position beneath the crumpled sheets. “You finished it?”
He glanced around the room and caught sight of the medical tools Stane meant to use on Tony, and Bucky could practically see the gears working in his mind. Steve crossed the room in two strides and picked up the bag, selecting an assortment of tools.
He didn’t even have to think about it. “About the Avengers. I know Steve’s backstory, and a little bit of Bucky’s from what Steve’s mentioned, but I don’t know about the rest of you guys.”
In an instant, Tony flinched back and covered his chest with splayed hands, knocking back against the porcelain.
Bucky was starting to get desperate, even going so far as considering an intervention with the help of their friends. But, out of the fucking blue, things...
As soon as the thought crossed his mind, finally acknowledging his lack of sustenance within the past twenty-four hours, Tony’s stomach roared to life. His cheeks tinted again, and he wiped his hands across the thighs of his ripped jeans before biting off a piece of one of the muffins and swallowing down a gulp of coffee.
Well, fuck. Steve could have said literally anything else and Tony would have clawed at his throat, demanding an explanation. But no, Steve was asking Tony to
“Stane has Tony, I’m sure of it.” He explained, resentment and anger seeping into his bones. “Clint, find every available security camera in the area and review the footage. There has to be something we can use. Nat, start working on tracking Tony’s cell phone. Sam, you and Bruce take Thor to the ER and keep us updated on his condition. Buck, you give Tony’s friends a call to let them know what’s going on, and I’ll canvas the engineering building and see if anyone else saw anything.”
I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. Personally, I got some bad news so I've been looking forward to posting this all week because you make me feel about 232627535x better.
By that evening, the entire building was packed with Hydra members, all anxiously waiting to hear about their new ace in the hole. Tony thought that he would be scared, or nervous for what was about to happen, but instead he felt at peace. He was doing the right thing. He just hoped that Pepper and Rhodey wouldn’t miss him too much, and that Steve would mourn for the appropriate amount of time before moving on with tremendous guilt. A ghost of a smile tugged at Tony’s lips. Who was he kidding? All he wanted was for Steve to be happy. That’s what you wanted for people that you loved.
Tony frowned, wanting to insist on helping him get cleaned up, but didn’t really know how he would do that here. “If you’re sure…”
“He needs more morphine, ma’am.” Bucky explained gruffly, looking up from his tablet from his spot in the visitor’s chair. Tony raised his eyebrows in surprise, wondering what the hell he was doing here in the first place.
Rogers was in his bed. Rogers was in his bed without a shirt on, his tanned, gloriously muscled chest on display for the world to see.
Tony was silent for a few seconds, gathering his thoughts. “I mean, I just don’t want to tell him about Steve yet. What happens if he changes his mind? Or doesn’t like me after our date?”
Howard sneered in front of him. “You heard him, boy. You’ll finally complete your education, just like you always wanted.” The sneer turned into a feral grin, and the bottom of Tony’s stomach dropped. “And then you can come home and take your place at SI.”
Rogers’ hand snapped towards him, sinking across the back of his neck with a vice grip and spinning Tony around so that their lips were a breath apart. Tony’s muscles seized at the incredible show of dominance, and he instantly dropped his gaze. Rogers pressed Tony closer so that his throbbing cock rubbed against Tony’s softening one, causing him to groan at the oversensitivity.
Isn't that what his dad used to say when he had one too many glasses of whiskey? (Which was ALWAYS). He couldn’t show weakness to these people.
Tony cut off her twenty-questions by ramming into her full force with a hug, careful not to spill any of the wine. “Pep...I’m in love. He’s perfect. And he likes me. And he’s perfect.”
“Because obviously whatever happened to you has something to do with Hydra, and…” Tony trailed for a moment before continuing. “And it was probably during the time frame where I was still trying to please my father, so you probably suspect that it was one of my weapons that did this to you.”
great. It took approximately ten minutes and thirty-three seconds into their date for Steve to realize that spending time with Tony had quickly become one of his favorite things in the world. Once they moved past the shy, awkward tension of the “first date,” Tony completely opened up. He was brilliantly animated when talking about his life, describing his current projects, what he had his students working on in class, all about his friends Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. Steve filed away every bit of information Tony divulged, along with the tells that he didn’t speak aloud. Like the fact that he liked pepperoni and sausage on his pizza, and picked off the olives. When he was cold, the shiver started in his chest and spread outward, causing him to stuff his hands into his pockets until Steve removed his own coat and put it around his shoulders. His laugh was bright and open, reminding him of the bells Christmas Carollers lugged around. The fact that Tony’s eyes matched the hot chocolate he was currently sipping on.
He stared down at the crumpled five dollar bill and stained coins in his hand. He only had enough to pay for the coffee that had been six dollars and ninety-five cents for the last
“Send us your location.” Steve ordered, annoyance leaching into his mind. All he wanted to do was go home to Tony, and now he had to go deal with whatever shit Clint and Sam had gotten the Avengers into. He threw the earpiece down onto the table. “Fuck.”
Bucky when Steve announced that he didn’t want the Avengers meeting Tony just yet. He wanted to kiss the man who had gotten Steve back to his old self. To the version of himself that laughed at stupid jokes, didn’t say no to weekly movie nights, and wrapped an arm around Bucky’s shoulders before shoving his fist into his hair for a noogie.
Steve slotted his shield into place on his back, and snapped a hand to Stane’s newly exposed throat, squeezing it tightly to cut him off. “You have much to answer for tonight, Stane.” He explained with barely contained fury. “But disrespecting what’s
“Thirty second timer.” He explained as he coughed up blood. “Steve,” he pleaded, focusing on his boyfriend’s crystal blue eyes.
Well fuck you too, Tony growled silently in his head. He closed his eyes and tried to pretend that Steve was right next to him, curled up by his side and telling Tony that everything was going to be okay, that he was coming for him.
His godfather laughed cruelly at him. “Oh, yes I did. With a car bomb, in fact. And you’re my only loose end, it seems. But I can’t let you die without knowing the Captain and his Avengers’ identities.” Stane unzipped the bag and let the black material roll out, lined with an array of razor sharp medical tools. “And I plan on getting that information out of you by any means necessary.”
Steve looked up to see Tony looking at him with an unreadable expression. He brought his shaking hands up to cup Steve’s face, calloused fingers tracing his jaw line. “
Tony had heard enough. He closed his eyes, counting how long it had been since Stane had taken him and comparing it to the time he knew it took to track his cell phone. The Avengers couldn’t be far behind. And then the man who was the source of so much pain, who betrayed him and killed his parents, would
“You’re a student?” Tony asked incredulously. He would have guessed the man was in his upper twenties judging by his height and not-so hidden muscles practically popping out of his layers.
After Steve and Bucky washed Stane’s blood from their bodies and clothes, they rushed back to the warehouse to find their team waiting for them. The reunion had been nothing short of disgusting, with Steve and Tony refusing to keep their hands off one another for the rest of the day. Clint had decided that they needed some major downtime after everything that had happened in the form of pizza and puppy piles. Pepper and Peter were already waiting at the house when they arrived since Bucky had informed them of Tony’s kidnapping earlier, and the two friends joined in on the refusal to take their hands off of Tony for the foreseeable future. Even sleeping, Pepper had her arms around her best friend’s waist, and Peter was stretched across their legs and cuddled up with his head in Tony’s lap.
. Clint, Nat, Buck, come with me to the warehouse.” He locked onto Sam and Bruce. “You two are going to stay here and watch Tony.”
Or at least, that’s what would have happened if the truck hadn’t T-boned them going sixty miles an hour.
the people responsible for hurting Tony. For hurting the man that his best friend in the world loved. Because judging by the way Steve was looking at him, Tony was now a part of the Avengers’ lives, for better or for worse, and the Avengers were family. They protected their own.
He nodded his hello’s to Peter and Harvey, who were buzzing with the same excitement oozing off of Tony. By the way they craned their necks towards the pair, Steve guessed they hadn’t seen the final project either, which gave him a strange sense of smugness. He followed Tony through the back room where his laptop sat, alone and open precariously, and watched his boyfriend dance around the table in short, eager bursts. “Okay, okay, are you ready?”
She shook her head rapidly, and spoke as she tried to haul him over to his back with no avail. Steve took over from there while she cradled his head and brought out a thin flashlight. “No, I just heard someone calling for help. It looks like he took a hit to the side of his head though. Maybe someone in the crowd might know something?”
Natasha gave her affirmative and spent the next few minutes digging through all of the desks, stacking them neatly into a large pile before her watch chimed, signaling the end of her time. “Gotta go.”
” A rasped whimper fell from his lips, and he flailed across the bed, threatening to burst through another round of stitches when his arm struck the hand railing.
He looked up to see Bruce Banner standing in the archway that led to the kitchen, holding a small plastic bowl and popping a grape into his mouth. Bruce was the newest member of the Avengers and a genius in his own right.
Bruce studied the genius for a few tense moments before shrugging. “I guess it couldn’t hurt. Just text him and tell him where we’re going, and let him know that Sam and I will be with you.”
, how…” Bucky drew up his mask as well, and Zemo looked between the two Avengers. “Barnes...you are the Captain and the Winter Soldier...
After that, things got a little crazy. Tony and Steve both graduated college. When their names were called in their respective ceremonies, the auditorium could have shook with how loud Thor’s cheering was. Tony immediately hired Pepper as his PA with a promise to promote to CEO once she dug her claws into the company, and gave Peter and Harley an employment contract for them to sign the minute they graduated. In the meantime, both boys would be coming on as interns in the R&D department in the summer.
The Captain nodded towards the Soldier, who grunted in agreement and drew out the glock from his waist, disposing of the men on either side of Zemo. Their target screamed as his associates’ blood painted his face. The Captain crouched down, his hulking mass hovering dangerously above the cowering man, and ripped off his cowl. “Because I gave you a warning twelve years ago, and you chose not to heed it.”
Zemo had been spotted near Port Norfolk, where at least three kidnappings had occurred. Sixteen year old twins from Sokovia, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, and a twelve year old boy. The kid’s parents and the Maximoff’s neighbor had all filed missing person reports, but so far the police weren’t having any luck.
Steve came over and sat at the foot of the bed, stroking two fingers up and down his covered calf. “It’s okay, sweetheart, you’re okay. You’re not alone, we’ve got you.”
Steve didn’t move from Tony’s bedside for six days. The moment they had gotten into the van, Bruce had his medical kit ready. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to get Tony to the hospital. The doctors had operated on him for four hours, and Steve had never been so wrung out in his entire life.
“Tones. Man, you’re my best friend, but you can be a total pain in the ass, you know that, right?” Before Tony could make one of the sexual jokes stored up in his piggy bank, Rhodey cut him off with a growl. “And if you say
Wet tears pooled against the fabric on Steve’s chest, and he continued reassuring Tony with soft musings, professions of love, and promises of safety until he felt steady breathing, indicating that Tony had finally slipped under again.
Rogers stared at him for a few, eternally long moments, poised like a snake. Tony refused to drop his gaze, waiting to see what Rogers’ next move would be. Unfortunately, he didn’t expect the swell of fury suddenly lighting up behind his kidnapper’s eyes. Rogers surged forward, his large palm covering up the entirety of Tony’s neck in a show of complete domination. Tony’s back hit the mirror with a harsh crack. Fear overcame his quick-lived confidence with ease and he looked off to the side in an attempt to stave off Rogers’ anger.
Thankfully, he didn’t offer much resistance. Steve set him back down onto the closed toilet seat lid and dried off any remaining water droplets. He grabbed the small container from the countertop and began applying the ointment to Tony’s scars and stitches, then carefully wrapped his wounds with new bandages. After that, it didn’t take long to put Tony’s sweatpants and a new t-shirt on before guiding him to the bedroom.
But Tony wasn’t listening. Instead, he pushed himself up so that he was sitting, rubbing a hand across his neck to try and chase away the feeling. “Do you feel that?”
Steve huffed out an annoyed breath and pinched the bridge of his nose. At the drive-through, he ordered for the three of them, paid, and handed out the food when he pulled up to the window.
When the movie ended, Sam had passed out on the loveseat, mouth open with a line of drool hanging off his lips.
Steve scowled, turning his back on them and walking back towards the office. He didn’t want to be out in the open while they talked about Tony. His Tony. That someone was
“I wanted to shut down the experiment immediately. It was too dangerous on so many levels, and the government’s end goal was to use the potential serum on
“Well aren’t you just a ray of sunshine, Bruciebear?” He mused with a smirk. “Anyway, I’m suggesting that we move this hostage party to my lab. You can still watch me from there, Steve was going to spend the day with me and work on his own stuff anyway. You can too. This way, we can both actually be productive, and Steve won’t mind the change of venue.”
That earned him an honest to God snort, which Tony tried to hide by covering up his face. “Oh my God, I can’t believe you just used the word ‘swell’ in a real life sentence!”
The Avengers and the Howling Commandos got together one glorious evening of camaraderie and celebration, and had drunkenly decided to switch places. In the light of the morning and everyone’s miserables hangovers, it still sounded like a good idea. Tony helped relocate the Howling Commandos to Boston, and the Avengers came to New York and took up residence in the Stark mansion.
When he finally came back to himself, he glanced down at the throbbing erection skimming close to his hip. The mob boss was careful not to rub himself against Tony, but judging by the tenseness of his muscles, it was taking some serious self- control.
People fear the unknown, so that’s what Steve had become. Nobody ever saw his face, and if they did, they didn’t live to tell the tale. You take down enough drug dealers and destroy enough sex ring operations with practically no one knowing who you are or how you did it, your reputation begins to take on a life of its own. If the rumors were to be believed, the Captain ripped out the Boss of the Valentina crime family’s heart with his bare hands and mailed it to the man’s brother three years ago. It was utterly ridiculous, of course. It had been his left hand, and there was definitely a saw involved. The Valentina family simply needed to learn a lesson on what happens to people who stole from homegrown businesses in his territory.
position he found you in with that boy, I convinced him that I would be best suited to run SI. But he just couldn’t let it go,” Stane raged, throwing his hands up in the air. “He needed his
you, boy, you think I don’t know when you’re lying? I’ve been paying attention, watching the Avengers closely, and I would recognize your designs anywhere. You started making weapons again, and for the same fuckers who are trying to take down my company!”
He rubbed the heel of his hand against his face while loose pieces of hair fell onto Tony’s shoulders. “One evening, something went wrong. One of our rodent test subjects reacted to the radiation in a way we never expected. It was...horrifying, to say the least.” Bruce shuddered, and Tony refrained from asking him to explain further.
If Tony had been confused before, he was absolutely floored now. He had a million and one questions running through his mind, not the least of which was ‘
. This was bad. Bucky had seen Steve wipe out men without a second thought because of an illegal sex ring, had watched him beat the life out of Johann Schmidt because he blew off Bucky’s arm, but he didn’t think he had ever seen his best friend
. And only his. This redhead couldn’t have him, and he enjoyed fantasizing about ways to clear her out of the picture if it came to that. Also, what kind of person got picked up from their date while their one night stand was still in the vicinity?
They all acknowledged their affirmative, and Steve clipped his new shield to his back. “Move out. Listen for Iron Man and the Hulk on comms.”
Rogers stood up slowly, folding the napkin that was in his lap and setting it down nicely. He closed the distance between them with three easy steps, sending Tony’s heartbeat through the roof with each one. Once he reached Tony, the mob boss put both hands on the armchair and leaned in, brushing his lips across Tony’s earlobe.
“She stood by and watched as my father cut me off.” He chewed on the inside of the cheek with a heavy frown tugging at his lips. “She watched as he put his cigarettes out on my arm, threw me down the stairs, added rings to his fingers before smacking me around.” Tony hissed in frustration. “My mother sat back and did
And if the Captain was there to fight, then Tony wouldn’t have to build weapons for these monsters. It was an impossible situation, and he fought the urge to cry.
Steve popped off Tony’s dick with a wet pop, still working his three fingers in and out of Tony. “That’s right, sweetheart, that’s right. Because you want to come around my cock, don’t you?” He had never been one for dirty talk before, but the young genius had a way of pulling it out of him. Based on the the writhing moans coming from Tony, he seemed to enjoy it. Steve leaned forward and plundered Tony’s mouth once more, letting Tony taste himself on his tongue, as he coated his own dick with more lube. He slowed down so that their kisses became more deliberate and passionate. Steve pulled back and admired his boyfriend, aching and desperate for him. “I’ve missed you, sweetheart. I love you.
you. I was too stubborn to involve you in my business, and I left you with my friends. The second I left your side, everyone got hurt.
He was cleared to leave the hospital three extraordinary long days later. After his panic attack, Tony had a hard time sleeping, despite having his three biggest comforts in the room with him. When he wasn’t sleeping, his hands shook from the anxiety, he shifted about a thousand times in his bed, and he tried to refuse help every time he went to the bathroom. Overall, he tore through thirteen stitches before he was well enough to be wheeled out to Steve’s ebony black truck waiting at the front entrance.
Tony moved to push himself up into a seated position, but Clint was there in an instant helping him put his back against the wall. “Thanks,” Tony offered with a smile, “I’m feeling alright. Glad to see you’re okay.”
Tony stumbled into the firing range, eyes quickly tracking over the six bays, only one filled with various rifles, glocks, and machine guns Bucky had been practicing with. The man in question waited patiently for his target sheet to reel back across the line. Unsurprisingly, only two holes were visible, one in the center of the forehead, and one where the target’s heart would be. As the sheet
He would just go to the lab and work there. It would help take his mind off of all of the bullshit that happened today. Bruce and Sam would find something in there to keep them busy, and then Steve would call, tell him to come home, and they would talk it out. Maybe have crazy hot make-up sex.
At that, Tony squirmed a little on the couch. He shouldn’t mention anything. It was nothing. “I, uh, nothing. Everything’s fine.”
The soldier shook his head, lip trembling. “Nein. It's the Winter Soldier.” His knees gave out on him as well, and he fell to his stomach. “It’s the Captain.”
word about Steve being a pain in your ass, I will fly back to Boston and dump you into a cold shower.”
He wasn’t surprised to see Rogers appear out of the corner of his eye, but he hadn’t actually prepared himself for the possibility that the man would follow Tony’s lead. The mob boss was stark naked as he stepped under the shower head, lifting his face so that the spray fell down around him.
The Avengers, on the other hand, didn’t live by society’s laws. Life was more simple with them, Tony mused to himself. The gang protect the people in a way the government and law enforcement could never dream of, and Tony was proud to be a part of that.
Tony tried shaking his head, unwanted emotions swelling up and thickening inside his throat. “Hydra. You tried to get me killed because my dad wanted to bring me back into the family.”
Large meaty hands gingerly pulled aside his rumpled collar to get a look at the purpling bruise on his shoulder, and Tony tried weakly to push him away.
He just needed to knock on the damn door already. Just as he raised his knuckles to do just that, the door swung right open, revealing a freshly showered, freshly trimmed, and incredibly handsome Tony. “Hi! I uh, saw you walk up from the window. And then I was waiting for you to knock, but then you didn’t, and I got nervous. People have said that I’m impatient. Uh, yeah. So here we are. Hi.”
The thought of having Sam and Bruce come anywhere near Tony had Steve shooting up and straightening his back. “I don’t…”
Tony popped a brow and subtly tried to move in his seat. No luck, Stane had tied him to a chair with his arms forced behind his back. “Then maybe you shouldn’t have used such a large dose of chloroform. You want my kidneys to get fucked up?”
“He’s got to be the one who told fuckin’ Hydra about Tony!” Clint swore furiously and sank down, running his hands through his hair.
He chuckled as he remembered, resting his hands back behind his head. “I tried to stay out of it, but one of them smashed a bottle on a table and came after me. I barely had time to blink before Steve twisted the poor bastard’s arm back behind him and snapped it. Didn’t take long for his buddies to find out who the real threat was. They jumped us like fleas on a dog, and Steve just...became this other person. The sweet, homegrown boy I was just talking to turned into this badass super soldier, tearing through these guys like it was nothing. Five minutes later, they were all groaning on the ground with broken wrists and dislocated shoulders. Then the smug bastard sat back down, ordered another drink, and turned to me with a smile.”
“JARVIS’ primary function is to keep me safe,” Tony explained, suddenly looking a little shy. “And he can do so much more than a regular computer ever could. I was thinking...if all goes well at my thesis defence, maybe I could integrate him into the Avenger’s missions?” He was quick to throw up his palms. “Only if you’re okay with that, of course.”
“Of course not,” He sneered back. He knew what Stane was playing at, trying to get him to connect the Howling Commandos, who decimated Hydra in New York, to the Avengers in Boston. There was no way Tony was going to play his little game.
Tony blinked, utterly and completely blown away. After seeing the Avengers in action back at the Hydra base, he thought he couldn’t be surprised anymore. Turns out, he had just been dying, and that tended to skew his ability to perceive and understand things correctly.
Two years ago, Steve decided to pursue his true passion and get an art degree. With his colorful and decorated past in the army, and the funds provided by the Howling Commandos’ hundreds of scores, he was accepted on the first try, and Steve and Bucky took off for Boston, leaving Peggy in charge back home.
When he opened the door, Bucky was waiting for him looking...nervous. Tony grimaced, and distributed his weight so that he could stand without help. “What’s up, Barnes?”
, a ridiculously smart one at that, but a kid just the same. There wasn’t any reason for him to be involved in Avengers business in any way, shape, or form. So why the hell did Steve have an instinct to protect him? It didn’t make any sense.
He sounded so damn earnest, Tony couldn’t find it in him to keep up his mini tantrum. He shook his head and felt the corners of his lips twitch upwards. “I love you too, Steve.” Tony then narrowed his eyes and considered Steve with a sharp gaze. “But I was serious before. You’re not my keeper, and I won’t have your little Captain persona showing up to give me biased orders. You don’t own me.”
Steve reached his free hand out, grateful when Bucky didn’t hesitate to take it. “Thank you, Buck. For everything. If I didn’t have you and the others by my side on this, I don’t know what I would do.” His throat closed with barely contained emotion, and he squeezed his eyes shut as Bucky tightened his grip.
“Think about it, you fucking genius. SI has been a thorn in your side just as much as the rest of us, even more so, and now you’re ready to take them down. You and Steve...you’ll go the distance, you know? And you’re helping the Avengers along the way. I don’t believe in destiny or any shit like that, but the universe has a strange way of bringing people together.”
After putting his phone and laptop away and stripping down to his boxers, Tony crawled underneath the high thread count sheets and watched the shadows dancing across the room grow until sleep finally claimed him.
The younger man chewed on the inside of his cheek, a faint blush rising up the back of his neck. “You...well you stopped. Do, do you not want me?”
Three days to slowly lose his mind. Three days for the anger to build up like an active volcano, crest by crest, waiting for the most opportune time to let loose and obliterate everything in its path.
The drivers of the truck had taken Tony. They hadn’t even so much as looked at Sam or Bruce, but they went straight for Tony. Sam was a little green as he told them about the obvious injuries he saw on the genius, and Bucky’s hardened stomach threatened to upheave at the possibility that the love of his best friend's life didn’t survive his injuries. Apparently, the glass shards had embedded themselves all along Tony’s body, slicing up his arms and fracturing right inside his chest. Blood had been everywhere. It was difficult to look at the crime scene photos.
They crossed over a two-lane, rickety wooden bridge that had Tony glancing down at the water every few seconds nervously before finally settling on dry land once again. He squinted, but couldn’t read the name of the town on the sign as white stone buildings came into view. Sam drove them through cobbled streets that reminded him of the pathway he ran into Rogers on in Mexico until finally parking in a space that seemed to be right in the middle of the downtown area.
Steve was inclined to agree, but he found himself looking over at Tony, who was immersed in the file. His boyfriend had given his enthusiastic consent to joining the Avengers, but that was mainly to find and punish those responsible for Hydra’s kidnapping. This was an entirely different ballgame, one Steve wasn’t sure Tony wanted any part of. They were talking about murder here. Steve had no intention of letting Zemo get arrested. His file suggested that he had friends within the system to get him off on any and all charges.
Happy Monday :) I hope you enjoyed the mid-week update, because it probably won't happen again until I'm finished writing. It's coming along though!
As he suspected, those happened to be the magic words. Wanda took his hand and let him pull her up, one arm keeping a tight grip on the ragged, loose dress she’d been forced to wear.
Tony opened and then closed his mouth, grimacing when he found it was parched. Steve didn’t hesitate to grab the water cup from the counter, toss a straw into it, and hand it to Pepper. When she pulled the drink away gingerly, Tony was able to swallow normally. “What happened?”
Inside, a thin teenage girl with damp red hair sat crumpled in the corner. She had large, terrified green eyes that watched his every move with frightening concentration. He’d seen her picture before in their file. Wanda Maximoff.
Thanks for reading! Again, I really love every comment that I read, and y'all are wonderful. Have a wonderful weekend!
Steve had been hysterical. Not that it was obvious to anything who didn’t grow up with him, but the tight grip on the ‘oh shit’ handle in the truck, the wild look in his eye as he focused his entire attention on the road while Bucky drove, the way his jaw kept clicking and unclicking. The man was a
it. You shoulda seen the way she was looking at me. We was just playin’ a little game, you Shant. That pussy wanted-”
Tony just nodded against his touch, letting his eyes fall shut. Steve watched his boyfriend unfurl and relax until his breathing evened out, signaling that he was finally asleep.
“The kid just stepped into his apartment.” Clint’s voice reported through his comm unit. “Remind me why I followed him back to his place?”
, Tony thought. It seemed like the best transition point. He steeled himself and leaned back against the pillows, threading his fingers through Steve’s. “I’m alive because of the
He never finished the sentence, because a bullet was suddenly lodged right between his eyes. Shots rang out around him, and he distantly heard the sound of bodies dropping. Tony heaved, the pain in his chest flaring to life again, and he clutched onto the bomb.
. Something different. Dangerous. But the feeling was never directed towards him, so Tony never even thought twice about it. In hindsight, he actually doubted his title as a genius, considering he never put two and two together.
“It’s kind of a long story,” Steve explained, intertwining their fingers and tugging until Tony collapsed onto his lap, legs hanging off to the side.
of it.” Steve was intimately aware that Hydra used SI weapons while in New York. During their three year war, Bucky had researched the company thoroughly enough to give the police enough evidence to put them under a microscope. Of course, the police could be bought off, which is why no charges were ever filed.
?” Clint mused as he adjusted his bowstring. “You all set for tomorrow morning? Ready to change the world?”
their deaths. Apparently Howard had begun to suspect Stane of betraying him, and had it changed in secret. Everything, the company, the house, the assets, the money,
The associate on Zemo’s left narrowed his eyes, tracking over the metal arm and the shield, then shook his head in furious confusion. “What...what business do you have with the
“Good thing too,” Bucky agreed, scratching at his stubble. “They must just be focusing on increasing their numbers for now.”
“Fuck.” Bucky swore, and Steve wanted to be sick again. There was no doubt in his mind that Obadiah Stane had planted that bomb. He handed Tony over to Hydra like a pig to slaughter two months ago, and had just murdered Howard and Maria Stark.
Tony chuckled, bright and pleased, before pulling out a quiver full of arrows and a new bow. “You already know what to expect, Legolas. But for the rest of the class, this is a collapsible recurve bow, with a mechanized quiver that stores and deploys your different arrows. Most of them are trick arrows, so you’ll have to check the tips’ color to see what they do.”
Tony snorted and lowered his head so that it was resting in the crook of his boyfriend’s neck. “I can’t imagine why.” He smiled dryly, taking a deep breath and re-memorizing Steve’s scent of lemon and pine.
“Get some sleep. We’ll be here when you wake up.” Bruce muttered softly, clicking off the light in the room.
Tony preened, just slightly. “Yeah, I’m a TA in the Engineering department at MIT. Working on getting my third doctorate right now.”
And then Steve was moving. He rolled off of Tony and out of bed, quickly shucking on underwear and throwing Tony’s clothes at him so that he could do the same. “Get dressed.”
Happy Monday everyone! It's Labor Day here in the states, which means no work for me and it finally gives me time to work on finishing up this story :)
Tony could hear a surprised, “oh,” then the sound of a laptop closing. “That’s wonderful, Tony! I’ll be there in twenty.” The line clicked off, and he wasn’t able to keep from wriggling a little in his bed. So what? No one was around to see it. An adonis of a man, his very own Captain America look alike wanted to go out with him! Former billionaire extraordinaire! Not that Steve knew that, of course.
Bucky adjusted his unyielding grip to hold Stane’s arms back behind him, forcing his knees down firmly on the cold unforgiving ground. Steve’s hand was still curled around his throat, eyes burning with such righteous fury that even got Bucky’s blood pumping. His best friend was going to
He dropped his voice down to a whisper before he responded, making sure that Tony knew the truth in his words wholly, completely, and thoroughly. “I love you too, Tony. More than anything, and anyone. I will always come for you.
A snort came from behind him. “You do that and I’m not responsible for what these babies cut off.” He snapped the scissors dangerously close to his ear, and Tony laughed out loud. It felt nice to joke around with people again, people who didn’t want anything from him besides his friendship.
The moment the rest of the team filed out of the room, Tony locked the door behind them and turned on Steve, who was still wrapped up in his stupid fucking
Once Sam left the room, Natasha made herself more comfortable, digging under the covers alongside Tony. He wasn’t going to lie, he really loved the casual comfort she was offering. “Tell me a story.” Tony asked, leaning back and closing his eyes.
“Exactly! My best friend would rather sweat his balls off in the middle of a desert and eat sardines from a can than live with me!”
Steve turned Tony’s palm over and rested his lips there. “Then you’ll see me again. Tell me about you, Tony. What did you do before you came to MIT?”
“I don’t know about that, Tony. I might be on Sam’s side on this one. A sentient toaster might be crossing the line.” The man in question answered from his spot leaning against the doorframe, smirking fondly.
Tony fought wildly at the sudden attack, trying to reach out and activate his repulsors, but his movements grew sluggish as he inhaled what he now recognized as chloroform. He tried to cry out, kick back,
Everyone turned to stare incredulously at him, and the light grip on Tony’s arm squeezed just a hair, gently checking to see if Tony was alright.
The last thing Tony needed right now was someone looking down on him thinking he was some kind of charity case. He got enough shit from his father and Obie to last a lifetime, he didn’t want to hear it from Big, Blonde, and Beautiful either. Tony silently stuffed the rest of the provided breakfast into his mouth, washing it down with the last of his coffee. He carefully placed the second muffin into his bag and wiped his hands on his jeans again. He stood up slowly, seeing that Steve was frowning at him. “I really appreciate you paying for my coffee. And for breakfast.” He hitched his bag’s strap over his shoulder, trying to keep his expression neutral. “I have to get to class.”
It's funny, because I don't usually like to READ angst because it makes me nervous, but I can't seem to stop writing it....
Tony groaned softly and swiped a hand across his face before finally opening his eyes. When he pushed himself to his feet, his gaze landed on the perfectly made bed sitting atop the platform.
“Nope.” He wasn’t having it this morning. Steve might be stubborn, but he was about to find out that Tony could match him shot for shot. “You’re going to class. You’ve already missed a full week, and if you don’t finish that final project, you won't be able to finish the semester off, and then you can’t drive across the country with me over the summer before I start my company because you’ll be stuck here trying to make up the credits before the fall semester begins.” Tony sucked in a breath, then tried to give Steve his best smile, teeth and all.
?’ He wanted to know why they were going to meet Steve’s friends now, when Tony had practically been begging to meet them for the past few months. And why did he have to pack almost everything Tony owned, like he would be gone for a while?
“I deeply apologize for allowing your father to lay a hand on you.” He lamented solemnly. “And the Avengers will deal with their idle threats, but for now, you need to focus on your thesis defense.”
“Tell me more,” Steve encouraged. And Tony did. In fact, he didn’t stop talking for another hour and a half, and Steve loved every second of it.
Steve growled, desperation clawing its way into his throat as he watched the man he loved struggle through so much fear. He made a split decision and climbed onto the bed, locking all of Tony’s limbs underneath him. He took a deep breath and shifted into his best “Captain” persona.
Tony scoffed. “Justin Hammer couldn’t use JARVIS even if he managed to get his dirty little hands on my tech. There are a million and one security protocols.”
Before he could dive into it, Bucky covered Tony’s hand with his own flesh and blood one. “Remember that conversation we had before?”
Again, the two birdbrains shared a look, one that Tony was sure was going to be an irritating usual occurrence. Rogers cleared his throat and shot him a warning look. “That’s their story to tell. Maybe one day they will choose to share it with you.” His expression pinched for just a fraction, but Tony caught it. “Actually, there is something we need to discuss before we arrive.”
Tony’s stomach dropped, and he squeezed his eyes tightly shut as a rush of embarrassment flared across his cheeks. He should have expected something like this. Howard was a grade-A dickwad, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that he would have gone to such lengths to make sure that Tony suffered, even if he wasn’t there to deal it out himself.
Tony worked his magic, and Bucky covered his back while the three of them got the hell out of there. They made it with time to spare, but Tony had passed out by the time they got to the van.
Tony sighed dramatically, hating that he could see the logic in Rhodey’s words. “Fine, you win. I’ll tell him the truth on our date tomorrow.”
. Suddenly he wanted to do something besides work a job. Steve found someone who he could focus all of his ridiculous pent up energy on, and goddammit, Tony just took it all in stride.
Turns out Obie was done pretending that this conversation was negotiable. His eyes grew dark and his voice took on a sharpness to it that screamed at Tony to get the hell away from him. “I’m afraid it’s already been decided. Howard is changing his will next week to name you as the sole heir to Stark Industries, but with a few
Tony groaned obscenely, earning him a blush from a girl walking by. “You have no idea. Somehow his friends always knew when I was even
Steve brought him food and coffee when he refused to resurface from his lab at MIT, intent on finishing off his final project. He threw Tony over his shoulder when he drank too much, and gave him water and advil before bed so his hangover wouldn’t be so bad in the morning. When Tony would attempt to climb him like a goddamn tree, because-
The man spread his arms out wide and accommodating. “Only the best for our resident engineer. We can’t have you working if your dead.”
“We’re the Avengers, and it just happened to be a coincidence.” Sam corrected, sharing a grimace with Clint. It sounded like someone wasn’t too happy with the closeness of his moniker.
Pepper’s eyes grew wide in understanding, then her mouth morphed into an excited smirk. “Oh, then we so need to talk about
, Steve?” If he hadn’t been so blindingly frustrated, he might have seen the way the others stiffened as Tony advanced on their friend. “I don’t need a fucking babysitter. I need you to tell me why you dragged my ass halfway across town for me to just sit here while you go off and do God knows what with your friends!”
On the third day of his captivity, he was ready. They hadn’t given him hardly any time to eat or sleep, much more focused on having their precious bomb in their hands then to keep the engineer healthy, despite their earlier promises.
“And purgatory for the pocket?” Steve finished with a good-natured leer. His father had been using that line since the day Steve came out as bisexual right before he began his first tour. He’d been nervous, having no idea how the head of the most feared Irish-American gang in the States would react to his own son having an attraction to men and women alike. Fortunately, Joseph Rogers actually cared about his son’s well-being and happiness, leaving the two of them closer than ever, despite Steve’s next six years overseas.
Tony and Sam both perked up in their seats. “Dude, really?” The Avenger exclaimed with his lips stretched wide.
Tony’s grin was blinding. He reached over the table, hit the enter key, and took a step backwards. “JARVIS, you up, buddy?”
!” Thor snapped, and Tony found himself flinching away from the sharpness in his tone. His giant friend placed his hands on the side of the head reassuringly and in apology. “We
Steve walked over, barely avoiding Rhodes as he kissed his boyfriend gently on his dry lips. “Yes, Tony. You know we can keep you safe. There’s nowhere I’d rather you be.”
Natasha’s eyes lit up with an emotion most people didn’t see, and she took them eagerly. She pressed a light kiss to Tony’s cheek and raised an eyebrow at Steve. “We are keeping him, Cap.”
The two officers looked mildly worried for about five seconds before their eyes flickered to something over Tony’s shoulder, their spines snapping to attention. Tony didn’t bother hiding his groan and turned around to find Rogers smirking at him.
Pepper leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple. “How would you feel about going home with Steve?” After his panic attack, Rhodes and Pepper conceded that it was the best course of action to make sure Tony felt taken care of and safe. “We talked about it, and you can go back to the apartment if you want to, but you might be more comfortable at his house.”
Steve cupped his free hand around Tony’s face and leaned down for a chaste kiss. “Graduation, and then you’ll be free to start up your own company. Our intel should be ready by Monday, and we’ll move out against Zemo that evening. We’ll be back in time Tuesday to celebrate you completing your third doctorate.”
Friday beeped in confirmation, sitting for a moment before beeping once more as she shut down. Although not as good as a human, he has to admit that Friday really has been one of his most successful of inventions, despite what his husband said. Comparing Friday to Alexa or Siri was like comparing Gucci to Walmart. Friday was the better of the other two, a pinnacle of the future that he put into the world. Of course, whenever he brought that up to Steve, his dear husband’s eyes would gloss over to the point where he was anywhere but next to his spouse.
men, a guy who would actually fuck me properly. I would like to be fucked properly! The only other men I’ve been with have all been pity-fucks rather than genuine attraction. I can count the number of men who actually have liked me on one hand … one finger, exactly.
By the time they reached the end of the day, to exchanging their presents – the traditional paper presents for the first year of marriage – Steve only spoke in clipped, one worded answers.
“Seriously,” Number 2 continues. (Ha!) “Back away from the tray. Rhodney has up to three other food items in his refrigerator. I could make you an olive with mustard. Just one olive, though.”
It is a line that is only a little funny, but it already has the feel of an inside joke, one that will get funner with nostalgia repetition. I think:
to olives) because he’s gorgeous. Distractingly gorgeous, the kind of looks that make your eyes pinwheel, that make you want to just address the elephant – “You know you’re gorgeous, right?” – and move on with the conversation. I bet dudes hate him: He looks like the rich villain in an ‘80s comic – the one who bullies the sensitive misfit, the one who gets ridiculously defeated by the hero as the whole city cheers.
The ugly violence of a decapitation, the sexual aura of young men … if you asked Tony, Caravaggio was the most despicable of artists and he’ll be damned if he ever let his husband paint anything close to what that man created. His Steven, the
A clump of guys hovers near a card table where all the alcohol is set up, tipping more booze into their cups after every few sips, all too aware of how little is left to go around. I nudge in, aiming my plastic cup in the center like a busker, get a clatter of ice cubes and a splash of vodka from a sweet-faced guy wearing a Vincent Van Gogh T-shirt.
Cold night, Brooklyn. The party is in fully swing. Bruce sticks me alone with two beers in hand, guy code broken clean in two. Who knew my monk-brewed wheat beer would catch the eye of Mr. Tall, dark, and handsome.
Gathering himself together enough to get out of bed, Tony walked toward the mirror over the dresser to inspect himself after last night. Truth be told, there’s lots of times that Tony has drank himself into a blackout, waking up in the bed or couch of someone he declared the night before to be his new business partner – back in the days of being a bachelor that came to an abrupt end when he met Steve – yet today felt off. He woke up in his bed, naked save for his boxer briefs and completely covered with violet bruises that littered his torso and face. Turning around only showed the discovery of four long scratches down one of his shoulder blades and the ominous looking red smear near his hip. Tony imagined what might have caused that smear, picturing his husband’s crimson paint stained hands moving down to touch him in the dead of night as a last resort to restore their dead sex life.
Looking back on it now, Tony noticed a pattern of behavior that always played out whenever he and his husband were within reaching distance; he was obsessed with petting Steve’s hair. After sex or even just to lay about their unnecessarily large bed, they fit together with Steve’s head on Tony’s stomach, the billionaire’s hand smoothing down the unruly cowlick that was ever so persistent on his beloved’s head despite the money he spent on hair products. Steve would always doze off silently. A couple times, he’d startle awake the moment Tony’s fingers reached the root of those fine hairs and watch the other man with a look that begged for protection against the world beyond their little cocoon of safety. During those moments, Tony wondered what it was exactly that was running through his fair husband’s head.
Tony. Remember? We got lost in the rain in Chinatown trying to find that dim sum place, and it was supposed to be near the statue of Confucius but it turns out there are two statues of Confucius, and we ended up at that random Irish bar all soaking wet, and we slammed a few whiskeys, and you kissed me, and it was–”
Tony hoped when they all wounded back in California, the two would let it drop – agree to disagree, free to be you and me. Neither did. Nat was funnier than Steve, though, so it was a mismatched battle. Steve was clever, stubborn, sarcastic. Steve could get him riled up, could make an excellent, barbed point, but Nat always made him laugh. It was dangerous the amount of time he laughed
He ran straight upstairs. No Steve. The ironing board was set up, the iron still on, a white button down waiting to be pressed.
His glorious husband had a very odd fascination with Caravaggista art. He would never admit it, but Steve always found a was to sneak in a dash of bright red into his art and paintings that paralleled that of the great
Needless to say, for two people who lived in the same city – the same city twice: first New York, now California – they barely even knew each other. They flitted in and out of his life like well-timed stage actors, one going out the door as the other came in, and on the rare occasions when they both inhabited the same room, they seemed somewhat bemused at the situation.
By the time Tony made it downstairs, he realized that he didn’t want to face the disappointment of his husband standing in front of kitchen island. He can see Steve standing there, flipping a crepe with his eyes trained on Tony as if waiting for him to do anything just so the blonde could nag him about something. Their cat, Goose, sitting on the counter with its tail flicking to and fro, staring the billionaire down with the same gaze his owner had. His stomach turned at the thought of seeing his husband. There was a time he would’ve raced down the steps to take the young man into his arms, lay him onto the closest flat surface, and suck him off until Steve saw white. Now all he wanted to do when he saw Steve was to be out of his sight as soon as possible.
“I tried calling Jarvis, but it seems like there’s no one inside,” she said, her voice picking up a concerned twinge at the end.
. The place was the point. The moment. I just … thought it was special,” he said those last words with a disappointed childish lilt.
The shape of it, to be more specific. He felt compelled to cup the fine blonde locks against the curve of his skull, threading his fingers deep enough to feel the warm, milky skin beneath it. It was that exact head that caught his attention seven years ago in the crowded gallery that featured a new up-and-coming artist. The back of that head was all Tony saw before the smaller man finally turned, flashed him a smile, and said, “Hi. I’m Steven Rogers,”
At McMann’s, the bartender, a big, bearded bear-kid, saw them come in and grinned, poured them both whiskeys, and pushed over the next envelope with the clue inside.
It didn’t help that although those doe-like eyes stared up at him lovingly, Tony thought of crushing that skull between his hands.
Quiet. The street was always quiet. That’s a sign of a good neighborhood: when you could jog without fear of someone lurking in the shadows of the three floor homes. Though that day, it sounded extra quiet. No children out playing on the lawns, the clicks of dog paws on the sidewalk, nothing. As he neared his home, conscious of the noise of the car engine, Tony could see the orange tabby cat lazily moving through the rose bushes. Still in the walkway, twenty minutes after Dottie’s call. It was strange. Steve loved that cat, having him chipped and fat, never letting him outside. He thought it was absolutely hilarious naming the thing Goose, chuckling under his breath. It was a smart cat, but could be a great hide-and-seeker. Steve knew that despite the LoJack imbedded in his soft furry rolls, he’d never see that cat again if he ever got out. His nightmares were plagued with the cat walking out and getting swept up by the ocean, drifting straight into the maw of a hungry shark.
He began running, screaming his name. Though the kitchen, where a kettle was burning, down to the basement, where the wine cellar stood empty, and then out the back door to the sea. He pounded across the slender wooden steps towards the private beach, peering over the clashing waves to see if he was painting the scenery, where he found him once, paint shiny in the sun and canvas wet with oil. He looked at him back then, and said nothing, turning back to the painting. Now, there was not even a soul on the beach. Tony screamed his name into the wind, fear gripping him tightly.
Before Steve and Tony got serious, got engaged, got married, he would get glimpses of Nat’s thoughts in a sentence here or there.
His best friend, Nat. He’s taken to saying that so much that every time he see her, her name might as well be Besfriendnat. They met back when Nat was his secretary during the era when he got to command the company how he wanted without his husband breathing down his neck. In fact, Nat has been one of the few people that still remember what he was like before he got married to Steve. Nat was truly the only person that Tony could truly be himself with. He didn’t clarify, didn’t doubt, didn’t worry. Their bond hasn’t been the same for a while – he doesn’t tell her everything, not anymore, but he tells her more than anyone else, by far. He tried to tell her as much as he could. They’ve spent years together back to back, covering each other. It was second nature now. It never mattered to him that she was an employee of his. What could he say? She was just cool.
“I love you, Steve. You know I love you,” he said, moving closer to him from their seats inside the limo. Steve’s arms were folded over his chest, staring out at the laser-eyed joggers and scissor-legged skaters, tight-lipped and pouting. Tony tapped his shoulder with two fingers, trying to bite down the anger when Steve shrugged him off. “Steve, I don’t get why you need me to prove my love to you by remembering the exact same things you do, the exact same way you do. It doesn’t mean I don’t love our life together,”
Both of them have had their fair share of long nights, chasing their vision down to commit it into the real world. They may have their vast differences, yet those late nights of sitting on countertops and discussing their own interests with each other was one of the things they both cherished. The thought of their spouse actually giving a shit about their interest was the biggest turn on in the entire world. Opposites attract, they say. Tony hated that saying. Steve was a young liberal arts major when they met, working on his degree in Art History with a minor in museum management and always had paint smudged on his clothing whenever they went on dates. Tony, himself, had already started rebuilding the mess that Stark Industries was at the time with his own mechanical engineering PhD under his belt.
It was a fifteen minute drive from The Bar. Most of the time spent trekking up the hill towards the most lavish homes of celebrities and wealthy individuals. They towered over each other in different aesthetics, all competing with people they’ve never met before for the bigger and better house. The old money stick to traditional, colonial, mid-century homes, the nouveau riche constructing sharp, white homes that rival the ones from futuristic cartoons. When Steve and Tony moved in, their only neighbors descended on them with plastic smiles. One middle-aged mother of three, bringing a bottle of expensive champagne that must’ve come from their own cellar. She told them she was an
That was the problem with Steve’s treasure hunts: He never could figure out all the clues. Their first anniversary, back in New York, he went two for seven. That was his best year yet. The opening clue?
Now, I like a good art party. I like artists. I am the child of artists. I am an artist. I still love scribbling that word, ARTIST – any time, any form, questionnaire, document, asks for my occupation. Fine, so I don’t paint the great issues of the day like Banksy, but I still paint good enough to have rich snobs sniff around my work. They call it “Thought provoking” which just means that they don’t truly understand it. I’m okay with that. My art is mine, not anyone else's. That’s why I’ve decided to start this journal, to help me catalog my emotions and make my art better. When I someday want to commit this day in art, I need this to remind me of how I felt when I attended this party.
His old secretary was at work behind the bar, her hair pulled up into a messy bun that threatened to spill out of the scrunchy as she scrubbed the dirty mugs in near-scolding water. Nat is slender and angular, attractive in the conventional way. Her features can belong to a model on the runway; sharp chin, high cheekbones, plump dusty lips, small frame. If she were in a period piece, the men would trip over themselves to paint her in an elegant headscarf and extravagant earrings that would punctuate her wealth. He could see her as the proper Dutch woman, the pinnacle of beauty and refinement. The only downside to her fair complexion was that her eyebrows were too fine to be noticed without makeup – not that the fiery shade of red of her locks helped distract from that minute flaw.
“Right!” he said, faking a revelation, “You should have done a clue with Confucius, I would have gotten that,”
He wished the public knew that – remembered the donated grants and the contributions to their family – before deciding he was a spouse-killer.
We climb three flights of warped stairs and walk into a whoosh of body heat and artisticness: many black-framed glasses and mops of hair; faux fur and paint splattered pants; blazers flopped all across the couch, puddling to the floor; a German poster for The Getaway (
here, one moment, please!” Nat covered the bottom of the olive green phone – a novelty dial phone their only source of communication from The Bar to the outside world – and mouthed: ‘Dottie.”
for fuckssake. The richest bachelor in America. His pockets overflowed with money, hundreds upon thousands upon billions that he didn’t hesitate to spend on anything and everything. Cars, houses, trips, alcohol – and art. Tony never asked for anything from anyone, and he became who he was because of his dedication and ambition.
degree. Neither of them liked their presents. They both pretended like they’d use it, but never did.
Tony swung open the door of The Bar, stepped in, and breathed in the first breath of air since leaving the Tower. The smell of cigarettes and beer, the spice of the bourbons, the tang of stale beer nuts. There was only one customer at the bar, sitting by herself at the far, far, far end of the bar: an older woman named Angie who came in on Thursdays with a different romance novel in hand every time. He doesn’t know why she chose to spend her time here, but she only has a glass of Chardonnay during her stay at the bar and smiles awkwardly at them when they greet her.
He woke to the sun coming through the small sliver of the blackout curtains. Jarvis knew not to open the steel-gray drapes until at least seven, so it must’ve been Steve who opened the curtains to wake him up. His husband could be obnoxious that way. Always doing things to prove that he was more responsible. Still, Tony had to admit, it worked.
He remembered biting the side of his lip, starting to shrug, scanning their living room as if the answer was hidden in the layout. Steve breathed in harshly, plastering a fake smile on his face for another very long minute.
is a magical place, the most beautiful in the world, no state more glorious. His eyes are mischievous, his lashes are long. I can see what he looked like when he was my age. Did I mention he was older? Significantly, possibly tethering that line between mature older and daddy-issues older. I never considered dating someone older than me, but it’ll be nice to show him a new thing or two.
