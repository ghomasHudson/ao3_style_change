They stayed like that for a long while, Tony resting and Steve petting the nape of his neck with his other arm wrapped securely around the subs waist.
Steve nodded again.
Steve looked at him expectantly at that.
"It's ok Tony. You can let go now. I've got you."
He couldn't deny any of it, what Rogers was saying was correct. Didn't mean Tony had to like it.
“Tony, don’t take this the wrong way, but most of the blame is on you when it comes to why you two didn’t get along. You always had to antagonize him one way or the other. He put up with it.”
"I think you were justified in your question but I thought we were clear on the matter of attitude and obeying orders. I owed you 2 hits for using your hands in the gym this morning so I'll just add to your tally."
“What if he left because of me? What if he left because of his heat? What if he lost his memories again? What if he remembered everything and.. What if he is in trouble? Why would he just leave? What if he needs help? Pepper, I need to look for him..”
The brief explanation of the stock exchange subject is that, in my head, Tony thinks "After this point in my life, I can't not be with Steve. I'll be with Steve anyway, so why not marry him and comply with the conditions of Stane's document. I may as well hand everything over before the board forces my hand. I do love Steve, I can learn to be ok with being an omega and come out this way. Steve had already proven several times over that he is trust worthy, both with my self and my company." And Steve just wants to be with Tony. Marriage just cements his claim over him. If it also helps with Tony's business, keeping his company under his own control, he's willing to help.
Then his hands moved to Tony's belt buckle and Tony bit his lip. Rogers slowly and carefully undid the belt and started to pull it out of its loops.
He stopped for a moment to pull himself together, put aside the ‘want’ the scent rose in him and focused on figuring out what was wrong with Tony. A heat in itself was hard to deal for an omega on his own but Tony had done it before. Something else must have gone wrong. Shaking his head to clear it he made his way to the bathroom door and knocked on it.
Tony scowled and opened his mouth to protest, Steve interrupted him,
Tony sighed and interrupted him. "I know buddy. I know. But it was unfair to you and me both. You could never be my alpha, I love you like a brother. You did what you could but Rhodey, it was still hell. The company.. It meant too much to me, it was my life. Actually it IS my life. But was I really alive? Obie's document made sure that I had to make a choice. It was either I got to live my life or have the company. Now, I've made my decision. "
“What?!?”
Steve was already taking his shirt off as he spoke.
After that it was a blur in the urgency which with Steve got rid of his briefs and pushed more fingers into Tony. He spread Tony’s juices around his cock then raised his hand to his lips to taste it. Tony only stilled for a moment to watch the alpha lick him off his fingers. Then he spread Tony’s perfectly toned and very male cheeks and pushed in.
"You think you can trust people with a tiny secret." He sighed.
“I didn’t graduate from MIT at 16 Mr Stark.” He said bashfully and looked up at Tony from under his eyelashes. Hell, Steve thought, the kid was crushing hard on fake!alpha!Tony.
That was awfully close to dangerous hypothermia. Steve realized Tony had been trying to keep his heat at bay. A spectacularly stupid move for a genius, considering slightly elevated temperature had nothing to do with sexual arousal during a heat period. The name was metaphorical. Steve supposed Tony wasn’t thinking clearly at the moment.
Tony nodded again, "Yes, yes, I'd love that too! I'll love every second of it, I have so many tricks that you'd absolutely love, I can drive you insane, I'm so good, you have to let me show you!"
A simple mission to gather intel had gone awry, the widow had been captured, Clint had ran in blind and the political situation that could tip into open war at any moment had not let SHIELD to openly interfere. No American boots on Syrian soil, except the most effective and small response team possible.
"Yeah I'll ask them after you have Pepper take them out like yesterdays trash. Think about it Tony, what is it that bothers you so much about this whole thing?"
"Begging suits you too. But I think I'll want more of it. There's no reward in ending the fun early, is there?"
Tony bit back a curse, frustration was rising in his throat along with the word 'red'. His arms and back were aching, his bladder was screaming and he'd just lost the chance to enjoy some sexy times with Captain America tonight.
“Believe me I know.” Steve bit the inside of his cheek and tried to remind himself that the man in front of him was actually a good man and he was only trying to look out for Tony.
Steve shook his head and sighed, exasparated. He should have been kinder probably but he was running out of patience. “Happy, don’t be ridiculous. I just want to help Tony alright? Pepper is freaking out inside and she won’t tell me what the hell is going on. And now you want to fight me?? What is wrong with Tony, tell me now and we can look for him together. ”
It was Pepper who made the decision of not telling the doctors about the memory loss. At least for a while, until they broke the news of Tony’s secret to Tony himself. During his examination Tony had kept quiet, mostly because he had still been disoriented, more because of the memory loss rather than the hit to the head, so she was able to take Tony home when the 24 hours were up.
But Tony had other ideas.
He sat on the bed and pulled the tablet that was sitting on the bedside cabinet onto his lap. He started to tap away at it, hacking into his own database.
"How are you feeling? Do you want to keep the blindfold on for a little longer?"
After so many hits he was sure his butt was a mess of bruises, he was crying, tears and snot covering the cushions and he didn't give a single fuck. Right as the hits were starting to blur into eachother Steve stopped.
Tony sputtered, he was so angry he could choke.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is that Floyd Dixon?"
The first hit was completely unexpected. One minute the captain had been gently petting him, second searing heat blazed through Tony's butt.
He'd never agreed to public humiliation. Granted, it was just Clint, and fetching drinks was far from humiliating, but Tony still chafed against the order. It was very common for collared subs to serve their doms in such small ways when they had company. It was a very common sight to see a collared sub happily kneeling next to their dom in a restaurant or a cafe, holding the door open or a chair out. Not everyone did it, of course, it was all up to the dynamic but it was certainly normal. So why was Tony feeling so embarrased that Barton was seeing him fetching drinks on Steve's say so?
"I should have started with  the corners."
“Yes.” Steve answered the question. “I wish Tony had told me himself, but I can understand why he would want to keep the number of people who knew to a minimum.”
Banner was out his field of vision. Then Tony heard him speak on the phone. In the next moment Steve was there, looking angry. Not with Tony though, he was mad at Dr Banner.
"No captain, he's right." Pepper spoke up then. She had gathered the vouches from the ground and was holding them tight. "There's no way of getting the board to sign on canceling the document. The company has changed a lot since then, but some of the share holders still have problems with an omega CEO. They'd jump on the chance of robbing Tony of his shares if Tony comes out as omega too. Not to mention the dropping stocks. The only way for Tony to be completely free is to bring the document into the board. This way, the document will be put into effect only because Tony wants it to. The assholes won't have leverage on him anymore. I can get them to sign off on it."
"And I'd say you need peoples noses in your business. I am telling this to you as a friend man. Nothing else. I sure as hell am not gonna look down on you because you submit. No one will. Clearly it was a mistake on my part to barge in on your shit. I shoulda just dropped off the bags and left. But I did want to tell you that the collar can actually help you. I hope you'll see that at some point."
"Yes sweetheart, I'll take care of you." The dom replied close to his ear and there was a kiss pressed to his temple. Then the fingers really started pumping.
It's been two nights, Tony's cock reminded him. And we've been good. We earned a reward. Well not completely good, but as good as could be? Steve seemed in a good mood. Could Tony dare hope to come this evening?
Then the alpha turned around to reach for the shampoo bottle.
“Fine by me. You can just leave it in this parking lot then.” He slipped into the car and still took a moment to give Steve a horribly insincere, tight grin. “I promise to be just as annoying as always cap. You don’t need to worry about it.” Then he drove off, leaving Steve to stand there and look at the tire marks he left behind.
"Clean slate now, you don't have to worry about a thing, the punishment is over."
"As you wish." Steve said, and Tony tried to breathe as cold water crept up. His lungs siezed for a moment when the cold hit his balls and breath wooshed out of him in a yelp when the entirity of his genitals were cradled in cold water.
"Was your reputation, dignity, or freedom under threat?"
Tony smiled impishly then sucked as much of Steve as he could into his mouth. The alphas eyes closed and he threw his head back at the same time as his fingers found their way into Tony's hair.
That was out of the left field. Tony wrecked his brain trying to guess who it might be on the other side of the glass. He couldn't think of any dominant who knew him so well /and/ trusted him.
"Mr Stark. As much as I'm sure I'll enjoy the lack of a gag reflex, that is not the reason I volunteered." The dom answered darkly. He did sound a bit put off, despite his words. Tony sort of hated him for the patronizing tone. He supposed he should get used to it though.
Tony stayed, except for turning his neck to watch Steve putter about gathering stuff. First the Captain rooted around in the bowl where he tossed his change, then kicked the rug aside, making Tony stand barefeet on the stone floor. At least he was close to the fireplace, which made the floor quite nicely warm.
Tony was already settling in and getting comfortable. He wondered how Steve might make him come tonight.
“Ow.” Steve rubbed his arm just to humor Tony, mostly he was glad that the omega was not having a melt down because of having his secret exposed. But he supposed, not remembering guarding the secret for so long was also part of it.
“Good morning Captain. How may I help you?“ Jarvis responded immediately.
“Wait a moment. You’re an omega, Happy is an omega and as people closest to him, I can understand why he would tell you. But Colonel Rhodes is an alpha.”
After that, hit after hit landed, demonstrating how Steve wouldn't treat Tony like he was made of glass. This would have been a hard spanking no matter the context, but no warm up and no foreplay meant Tony felt each and every hit very acutely.
Tony’s eyes grew bigger for a moment then he frowned, looking down at his hands, where he was letting Pepper hold one. The room was silent for a while yet Steve could almost hear millions of questions running through Pepper’s mind. Finally Tony spoke. This time his voice wasn’t soft, but Steve could tell he was angry and was trying to hide it.
“I don’t actually know. I could ask some people who dabble with it. Why?”
“Uh-uh, T-tony can you please put on some pants?”
“Oh goodie.” Three hours of sleep.
“Sure thing.”
“She’s a redhead. Our age. Skinny, but also has a nice ass.”
Steve moved sluggishly through the throngs of people in shorts and flip flops to the pick up area outside. He glanced at his phone to see that it was 8:45 am. He scanned the crowds a bit before seeing a short brunette with bright red lipstick and a sign with his name scribbled on it with a smiley face.
From the kitchenette Tony quickly shot back, “Steve as your bo-... friend, I think it would be better to stay at the tower. I’m sure we can handle it.”
“Well, Mr. Rogers, Peggy only sends down non believers. You don’t believe in mermaids?”
Steve shook his head, “Sounds fun.”
As the days progressed, Steve realized that he had not only forgotten memories, but feelings. When people would ask how he was doing Steve could only reply “I don’t know” because when he thought about it too hard his brain got fuzzy. The doctors say he damaged multiple parts of his brain which would account for that feeling. The only time Steve ever felt something was when he would box or work out.
Steve pushed all his feelings down and all the memories and emotions until he thought he couldn’t take it anymore. The world felt like it was suffocating him and everything made him annoyed. It wasn’t until a meeting with the team that Steve finally came to a decision.
“Well, do you need help getting back in?” Steve stood up and gestured towards the water.
“Sorry. ‘Tell me about it’ is just a figure of speech. I mean I want you to tell me about it, but when I said that, it was rhetorical.”
“Please don’t apologize. It’s fine.”
“What are you looking for today?”
“Well, no girlfriend. Or boyfriend for that matter. I used to be pretty small and sickly looking. No one was really interested back then. Now that I grew and play sports, girls start to notice, but it’s all superficial.”
Steve turned on the cold water and stepped in letting the icy drops barrage his skin. That certainly woke him up and calmed his already fried nerves.
All Steve could think to say was, “Is that fake?”
They got into the car and sped off down the road. Steve was still thinking about what Tony had done. He didn’t know how to interpret it. The good news was that Tony wanted to see him again. The bad news was that holding hands might mean nothing to Tony.
Every day it was always Bucky or Sam or Natasha. Once they noticed the pattern, like clockwork they would find him right as he had his breakdown. They would comfort him and try to soothe him and take him upstairs to his room. But today wasn’t like every other day. This time Steve saw a flash of something in his head. A memory? A dream? A hallucination? Steve couldn’t tell, but he tried to ignore it and punch harder. The flashes kept coming until they began to play like some sort of movie. This scared Steve but he kept punching harder and harder. Steve could see himself and Tony and Thor and Bruce and Natasha and some tall man with an eyepatch. They were talking and Steve’s heart started beating fast. Suddenly, the bag broke and flew off in front of him. His paused, whatever was happening stopped. But for the first time, he remembered what he had seen. Steve stood in the middle of the gym. Frozen. He couldn’t move.
"He's back. And I don't know what to do."
Steve stared at the boy,
Tony sighed and picked up the bag of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed one. He took a big bite and turned to face the water again. After a few seconds of chewing, Tony scooted back over to Steve. His face was still pink with the blush.
Steve realized he was probably being rude, “Um, sorry. My name is Steve. I guess I’m just shocked because, well, I didn’t think you existed.”
“Well I’m so glad you could join us. What can I get you boys to eat?”
When Steve woke up, he walked over to his room and found Tony was gone. The bed was made and there was no medium height brunette anywhere.
“Yeah why?”
“I don’t think I can do this anymore, Rhodey. I can’t reach him, he shuts everyone out, maybe I should just try to find someone new.” Steve could hear Tony choking back tears as he spoke. The great Iron Man that everyone kept talking about was now devastated.
“You left it on the rock..”
“How does everybody know?” Steve asked exasperated.
“What do you mean?”
“Hey, I need help getting my art to the pier. You wanna help?”
“Rhodey, the poor guy can barely remember what he had for dinner last night. Give him a break!”
“See you in August. I love you, Steve.”
“Peter.” The woman scolded.
There was one person who was different than all the people he had met. Anthony Stark. Or Tony if you are a friend. He had been acting the strangest when Steve had come home from the hospital. The first time they met, Steve had seen Tony without a shirt trying to put pink band-aids on a painful looking gash in his left shoulder. Steve didn't know how to react so he stayed quiet. The next few weeks however, Tony tripped over his words when he spoke and constantly tugged at the ends of his sleeves as if he was always nervous. He would make sure to stay a good distance away from Steve as if he was trying to restrain himself. Steve didn’t understand why he acted like that and no one would explain either. They would say “It’s just better if you didn’t know.” and that was the end.
Tony audibly sighed, his face in his hand. Steve tried not to stare at him or put a hand on his leg in support. Steve’s attention was diverted when Vision piped in.
“Nothing. Sorry. Please continue.” Steve really liked the way that Tony talked with his hands.
Tony sighed in Pepper’s shoulder, “Oh Pep. I made him cry today. He looked so sad. How could I do that to him? I can’t deal with myself.”
“Oh right. That’s today. But it’s not that big of a deal. We’ll still get to see each other. I’m in town for another three weeks after this. It’ll be fine. The only difference is you’ll have your tail back.”
“Rogers. Steve Rogers.”
mean to say that.
Steve could see a tiny smile creeping at the corner of Tony’s mouth. Steve led them inside giving Tony his own personal guided tour using his old sketches from his first time in the museum and his own personal insight into the world of merpeople. By the end of the tour, Tony had lost the frown and was laughing and playing along with Steve’s dumb tour guide bit.
“Did you land okay? Was Peggy there to get you?”
“I was wondering how many books about science you had.”
As they watched the movie Tony saw his own life reflected in the movie: becoming an orphan, inventing amazing things but all the adults around him ignoring his success, his determination and intelligence. When the main character decided to make a memory scanner Tony got an idea.
“I think we all needed a little break from the rides.”
A few weeks had passed since Steve had started
“Bye Peg.”
again: for his friends, when he stubbed his toe, when something didn’t work out in his favor, when there was a problem he couldn’t solve. Steve finally had gotten used to it and actually enjoyed it because it made him feel human again.
Steve was bringing his art inside when he got a call from his best friend.
“Yeah, it’s kinda my thing. Not that my parents think it is, but I think it is.” Steve felt his cheeks going red. He didn’t really tell people he drew because they then he set expectations that he didn’t feel he could meet.
“That’s good.”
Steve sat in the conference room until everyone had disappeared to other parts of the compound. He sighed and put his head down on the table trying to slow his breath.
“Oh, the ones that fly in the air?”
“I just told you to guess.”
“I’m out here,” a voice called from the balcony.
Peter interrupted before Steve could answer, “He’s staying with Peggy.”
“Can I see it?”
“Natasha sent me down. She said that you usually break down around this time and told me to check on you. I- I- heard the bag break and came to see if you were alright.”
If you want to know what song Steve was listening to it's called "Dear Friend," by Dayglow. You can find them on spotify or on apple music. They don't have much of a presence on youtube sooooo. Yeah! Good times. Some of the lyrics might not be completely right because there are no official lyrics so I just listened to it a bunch... lol
“Amazing!” Sandy glanced up at the clock on the wall, “Oh no! I have to get back.” Before she left she said, “You have a gift, Steve: don’t let it go to waste. Thanks for coming down, boys. Peter, tell May I say hi!”
“Oh. My bad.”
One fateful day, the Avengers had a meeting to talk about the next mission they had to go on. It was a pretty routine mission: Bad guys hide in cave, they have weapons of mass destruction, the avengers fight the goons, destroy the weapons, grab a beer on the way home.
“Well, my drive usually takes about an hour depending on traffic and I get a coffee or tea before I go in. Sometimes I’ll do my makeup so I don’t look so tired. By the time that’s all done, I don’t actually get to work until like 8:30 or so.”
“Like this?”
“Yup.”
Steve sat, listening to the waves for a few more moments before hearing a small gasp. Steve’s eyes shot open and he scanned the area for other people.
Tony fumbled around until he found Hello Kitty band-aids and gingerly placed five or six on his shoulder.
Nobody judged him or said anything to him. They knew it would be better to let him get his emotions out instead of pushing them down.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I don’t know what to tell you.” He sighed and turned back to face the small man. “I don’t remember anything.” Steve knew that was an absolute lie, but he didn’t want to be around Tony any longer. “If you don’t mind, I just want to be left alone.”
“For everything. You have given me more fun in 24 hours than I’ve ever had down there. Plus, this view is terrific.”
“Yeah. Unless you don’t want to.”
“What are rides?”
“Love you too.”
Peter grabbed Steve’s hand and led him out of the museum claiming that it was lame. Peter took him right next door into what looked like a tourist trap mixed with an antique store. There were all items imaginable but with mermaids on them. Peggy hadn’t been kidding when she said the town really liked mermaids. Peter picked up a light blue hat with a mermaid on it and handed it to Steve.
Steve crossed his arms and replied, “Fine, enlighten me.”
Tony smiled at Steve’s rambling. Steve swallowed hard trying to will the blush back into his cheeks.
“She did? Oh I have taught her well! Well Mr.—”
“When will I see you again?”
Steve had just lied to his team. He his head felt okay. It would probably even be good if he got out of the compound, but something in him couldn’t bring him to admit the truth.
Tony’s face turned a light shade of pink. It seemed that he didn’t know a proper response. He took a second to compose himself.
“Um, I’m Steve.”
“Of course, but after you eat!” Sandy shoved the plates into Steve’s hands and waved him away.
“Peter! I’m so glad you’re here!” A woman’s voice yelled from behind the counter. “How’s May?”
“Yeah. Let’s do it.”
“Oh, hey guys. What are you doing here?”
Steve kicked himself for not planning this better. He only had an hour with Tony as a human before Steve would have to go back to only seeing him at night and his friends were lowkey invading his space.
“Who’s your cousin?”
“Hey, where is Tony anyway?”
“Yup.”
“Peggy? Carter? You two are related?”
Steve hopped off his own swing and moved to be behind Tony. He gently placed his hands on Tony’s back and pushed him forward with all of his weight. Steve sighed to himself as he watched the adorable figure try to stay balanced as the swing flew forward and back. Tony finally gained momentum. Steve kept pushing until he thought Tony was going high enough to be independent.
“Follow me then.”
Monday night came around and Bucky was scheduled to land in half an hour. Steve had promised to meet him and Natasha for dinner when he came in so Steve had to cut his time with Tony short.
“Hey, Tony?”
Though Steve appreciated the gesture, he had gone through quite the growth spurt and could carry the bag with ease, “I’m okay, thanks.”
“You believe in mermaids?” Steve asked laughing.
Steve heard Tony’s small gasp and felt sorry for him. Tony obviously had some connection to Steve and Steve was shutting him out. Steve turned away and walked to grab another bag. Tony quietly left gym and Steve was once again alone. Steve dropped to the floor out of exhaustion. He hadn’t realized that all this exercise actually would have an effect on him. As he lay there, breathing heavily and trying to get his energy back, Steve heard talking from the hallway.
Steve look around to make sure he wasn’t breaking any rules and began to climb. Steve scaled it with ease as the boulder wasn’t very tall. He dropped onto the sand and looked out at his surroundings.
, this mermaid goes to a sea witch who gives her legs so she could go on land to find the boy that she loved and it was fun. I mean she lost her voice and in the actual story it ends badly, but is there anything like that?”
Steve laughed, “Only sometimes. And you haven’t even been to an amusement park. Believe me, this is nothing.”
“I’m so so sorry, Tony.”
It had been weeks since the crash and Steve still couldn’t remember anything. His “friends” showed him pictures and videos, but he drew a blank. They told him about his life, his powers, his responsibility as an Avenger. The words that came out of their mouths were meaningless. At meals, Steve sat solemnly in the corner watching his friends laugh and smile. Most days Steve would either roam around the compound silently or would work out in the gym to keep in shape. Sometimes the other Avengers had missions, but Steve couldn’t join them in fear of hurting his head more. He was left alone. At those times he would put on classical music and sit near a window and just watch the clouds change shapes and lazily role by.
The next morning Steve woke up around 6:30 to the sun barely shining into his room. He was still jet lagged from the time difference and sat up bitterly. Steve trudged into the kitchen to see Peggy making herself toaster waffles.
“Yeah, but she moved to England when she was little. They moved back when Peggy was fifteen. Then she went off to join the army.”
“Are you Steve Rogers?” A British accent retorted back at him.
Steve hopped off his rock and walked over to the Tony. He gently placed a hand on the end of his tail. It felt wet and scaley as Steve had expected. When he looked closer it was a deep red with gold flakes spread throughout.
Finally, Steve was done after lots of intensive labor. His phone said it was already 6:30. The auction would be starting in half an hour which meant that Tony didn’t have much time left either.
"Whatever, Stark. Don't you have a robot to get back to or something?"
“Oh, my drawing?”
“So, do you have a partner down there in your sea city?”
his strength if we’re going to break into the facility.”
Rhodey countered, “But we
“Well, I can’t tell him about you and he can tell if I’m lying over the phone so we’re in a bit of a situation.”
After weeks of Steve being a complete jackass, everyone was stretched thin. Tony especially was just tired of Steve being cold and pissy with him. Maybe this machine would fix everything.
The rest of the afternoon was much like the morning with tons of greasy fair food and riding rides that could kill them many times. Tony’s favorite was the Zipper. He just kept laughing as they were thrown around in circles. Steve loved his laugh.
Steve heard footsteps approaching. He lifted his head and saw Sam.
His thoughts were now dominated by Tony: his voice and his walk and his body (especially his butt). Steve could feel his heart jump every time he thought about him or was in the same room as him. He occasionally would get a boner when Tony would walk by in a particularly tight shirt or when he would pass by the workshop and see Tony dancing to AC DC or Led Zeppelin.
Hi everyone. Just a heads up but some of the stuff I'm writing about was not included in the AU on my Instagram. It honestly makes for a better story if I add stuff so yeah! Have fun reading!
Tony and Steve talked for a few hours about their lives, interests, dreams. Tony was really into human science and engineering because of a rogue textbook on the beach. He said that his dad got mad and destroyed it when he found it. Tony looked sad recounting that story and Steve decided to try to get Tony another book. Steve found out that Tony was actually somewhat of an inventor and had been trying to build stuff to make communication with humans easier. Steve didn’t understand it much, but he liked hearing Tony talk.
After Tony’s blow up during the meeting he stormed off to his lab. He was so mad at the world, himself. Mostly himself. He had gotten mad at Steve and made him upset. Tony had never seen Steve so upset, on the verge of tears.
“What time is it?”
“Bucky? Never! He’s like a brother to me. I’ve known him since we were little. I don’t think that would ever happen.”
“Yeah.” Steve sighed and remembered the book. “Oh, good news now. So I was thinking about what you said last night and I had some time to kill this morning so I got you something.” Steve handed the book to Tony who examined the front cover.
The wind blew and the sun was hot. There were tons of pieces of art from paintings like Steve’s to statues made out of old soup cans. It seemed like everyone in the town had made something for this auction. Steve helped move boxes, set up displays, and bring refreshments to the rest of the crew (courtesy of Sandy). Tony sat on a bench in the distance watching Steve and the ocean tentatively.
“Hey kid, what’s up? Did you lose your mom?”
“That’s where the fancy title comes in.”
“Hey Steve! Guess what!!” Steve could practically hear Bucky jumping up and down.
Steve’s plan was going terribly.
“I’m going to go Steve.”
“Yeah?”
“We are going to the fair,” Steve thought to himself, “It’ll be fine. Nat and Bucky are there. We are in public. Nothing is going to go bad... Or I will cry.”
He put in his headphones and slowly made his way through the exhibits. It wasn’t very large, but Steve took his time studying the pictures and learning about different legends and stories. He also used this time to sketch what he saw.
Steve smiled at Tony who just smiled back.
______
Tony laughed at himself. He had been hoping to propose to Steve after their mission. "Look how that turned out" he thought.
Tony looked a bit shocked at the question, “Sure.”
Steve nodded and remembered the shell in his bag, “Since you seem to be the expert, could you look at something I found on the beach?”
"We had to change him and clean him up. His other clothes are in the washer." Natasha answered as she followed suit into the room.
"You better hurry up," Tony muttered, trying to roll his hips onto Steve's fingers, "I need you so bad, Stevie,
"A—ah," Steve noised as Tony's fingers moved in and out of him, nodded quickly. "Yes. Yes he has. He does. Oh, he does." He breathed, rocking back onto Tony's fingers.
"I want to be able to meet them. To see all these things you talk about. Explore with you up here."The blond explained longingly. "But I'd need legs. And I am unable to just grow a pair."
"Maybe it’s got me paranoid," Tony muttered, turning to bury his face into Steve's stomach, "Either way, I'm not leaving you, Steve. Whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me."
"Is havin' babies hard?" Peter asked, earning a chuckle from both Steve and Tony.
"I, uh," The brunet started unceremoniously, voice low "I did. I said there was more if you wanted there to be. I'm guessing that you do?"
"You are such a snuggler." He chuckled, "I like it. You're comfy."
"See you later, Captain.".
Steve rolled his eyes fondly at him. "Patience is a virtue, young man." He chuckled, revving the motor as he started up the bike. "You holding on tight?"
"'Kay, Daddy! Thank you!" Peter cheered about his treat, causing Sammy to look up at his brother and noise curiously as he continued to chew on his teether.
Steve reached over and lifted Tony's chin slightly so Tony could look at him, giving him a soft look.
"Daddy says swearin's bad," Peter replied from memory, eyebrows knit in confusion, "Wight, Papa?"
"Mm--mm, no,
"I gots it," Peter snuggled back up to Tony, "Go sleepies, Papa."
"Sorry, bubba. We don't like making you upset, but--" Steve started sadly, sighing again. "You have to learn that certain actions have certain consequences..."
"Not exactly. I mean yes, you're my friend, but I did it because... I care for you a lot more than that. For almost a year now. Well, a bit before because I had this thing for Captain America in my college years, but that's a whole other story that I probably should've not told you because its kind of-- okay, very embarrassing, and--".
"I'm not gonna get you guys sick, am I?" He asked weakly.
Peter looked back, just missing Steve backing away. He hummed suspiciously but turned back to Sammy, patting his back.
He let his eyes shut, letting all the stress and worry from the day release from him. Tony's body fell completely lax from the mental exhaustion, the brunet falling into the deepest sleep he had in a long time.
Clint just calmly shrugged.
. You'd have to bubble wrap me."
"Oh my god, Steve, you're going to make me cry," Tony mumbled, already starting to get misty-eyed, "You two are going to be the death of me, I swear."
"Yep. Definitely still a little tired." Steve chuckled softly, coming over to sit with them. "And you are definitely at least part sap now." He chuckled.
Tony smiled at that, ruffling the boy's hair before washing his own hands.
"Y'dont? That just gives me more incentive to do so."
"I don't want him to grow up, I want Pete to be our Peter Pan," Tony murmured, nearly falling asleep in Steve's warmth, "He deserves all the goodness childhood brings, he really does."
As he lingered slightly at the entrance, the blond heard a voice echoing from inside the grotto.
"Ooooops," he giggled, cupping his hands to throw more water onto Steve.
Tony sighed and patted Steve's hands.
"Okay." Steve replied softly, smooching Tony's cheek, taking Peter to fix up his nose, anyway.
Tony shrugged again, letting an awkward moment pass by before stepping out of the room, comforted in hearing Steve's footfalls behind him. He signed himself out and made his way to the garage, looking for a familiar car. Once Steve got him in the right direction, he curled up in the passenger seat, still quiet as ever.
"I'd be fine with that, but let’s try not to have your knees give out for your sake, huh?" Steve chuckled, leaning back against Tony's shoulder. "And if you're old, that must mean I'm ancient." He laughed warmly.
"You had a severe allergic reaction to shrimp, which I would suspect could be all shellfish," He answered for Peter, "Thankfully, your dads were smart enough to get you here before you could go into a full shock, so we were able to keep you sedated. You should be discharged within the hour, and for the parents--"
"We're supposed to take him over there and they would bring him back sometime tomorrow." Steve pointed out as he followed them upstairs. "So we have to get dressed too."
"Y-Yessir. Oh yes,
He took the scarf off his neck, moving his hand under his collarbones to proudly display his tattoo.
Tony drifted off to sleep, more than content to snuggle into Steve's immense body warmth.
would I be a good father!"
"Love you too. Love you so goddamed much," Tony whispered, content to stroke his hair before he fell into a deep sleep.
"Ring--back of nightstand drawer," Tony groaned, thumping his head back against Steve's chest, "Hurry up,
Tony faux-pouted at Steve, huffing dramatically.
"You can suck that stuff down like that, sweetie. You aren't used to carbonation. That’s like what soda pop has in it, and you haven't drank soda, really."
"So much for doing it before I was sore." He huffed a chuckle softly.
Steve was surprised feeling the tears, stroking Tony's face.
He took Steve's hand and kissed his knuckles fondly, smiling up at him.
"Nah. A bit mat'ure, doe," Peter hummed, flicking his eyes up to Steve, "Bein' silly is f'babies, Papa."
"You." he said. "You had the most stupid smile on your face a minute ago.".
Steve was already on the floor with Sammy on their blanket, playing "This Little Piggy" with the baby's toes.
“No, no, my bad, I should have had the music down lower so I could hear you," Tony winced, pressing his hand to the blood flow, "I'm
Tony laughed, putting his head on Steve's back to steady himself.
"Be nice, pipsqueak," Tony laughed, moving to the kitchen to help Steve plate up breakfast.
He grinned, kissing up to Steve's jaw. "Whatcha wanna do, babe?"
"C'mon, Peter. Let's get going." He said, leading the boy to the car and setting off.
The boy scrunched his nose up and made a face, to which Tony made the face back until he could smell the coffee.
"Bro," Clint breathed, "You got a match?"
Peter giggled at that, nestling into Tony's side.
He reached for the lube, slicking it up in his fingers and feeling it warm up.
"Take Sammy outta here, Stevie, there's too much stuff in the air that could get in his lungs," Tony ordered softly, "You too, Pete."
"Okay," he mumbled sleepily, gently kissing at Steve's breastbone.
"Nap time sounds perfect to me." Steve agreed, running fingers through Peter's hair. "We can finish fixing on the Christmas stuff later together. Right now, we should have a group nap time." He hummed. "We could have a pallet on the floor."
"S'good," he managed, feeling Steve curl back up to him.
"Yep, stay in there for a sec," Tony called, quietly smirking as he slipped on a belt, tucking his shirt in.
"Ow." Steve said quickly with a small wince. What
! And Peter. I want our family."
Steve snorted a soft laugh, rolling off the bed to go and help Tony.
"Tony...what is that?" He asked, trying not to get his hopes up. Lots of things could come in little, black boxes. Not just that, right?
"I don't think you are. You love to get in trouble," Tony hummed, stopping the spanking to massage his pink cheeks, "Don't you? Did you mouth off the principal too? Let me guess, detention for the week?"
He didn't even know how he wanted to continue his sentence. Steve just wanted to praise. Praise Tony for how good he felt. How good Tony always made him feel. Words were just a difficult way of expressing it.
"Love you too, so, so much. Always will, Tony." Steve whispered back softly, reaching down to take Tony in his hand and pump him carefully. "Want to keep you feeling good and happy. Want you to be
“Dodger… Buddy, you didn’t…”
He whimpered softly, pushing his hips up into Steve's hand.
"No he hasn't!" Steve laughed amusedly. "Daddy like to do that, so maybe Sammy was copying Daddy." He grinned, sneak over to smooch Peter's cheeks then Sammy's.
"So I was thinking that since we are having a big Christmas dinner tomorrow, we'd just order pizza or take out tonight." Steve offered. "Saves time cooking and saves us food."
He carefully flipped through the yellowing pages, handing it to his partner.
“Alright, too far," Tony snapped, stepping in front of Tony, "One, I do not hide behind Howard. Two, you can talk shit about me all you like, and how little of a threat I am, but you do not have the authority to treat Steve, my soulmate, like that. I could legally sue you for harassment, and given my rise above you, I would easily win that court case and leave you and your shambling corpse on the street."
"Ah-- counter, on your left," Tony groaned.
Flipping over blankets, pillows, and other larger items in their room, Tony frantically searched for his Flareon, U. U was almost always by Tony’s side, ever since he met her as an Eevee in Afghanistan, so the fact that he couldn’t find her left Tony in a tizzy.
Tony gasped, putting a hand on his chest. "I would love nothing more," he grinned, a smirk tugging on his lips, "It's gonna be interesting when you start to play with me, Steve."
. I could easily stay out of that zone. If I wanted to."
"Steeeve, God," Tony whined, breathing in relief when Steve finally pushed in, "Yes, yes--"
"In good time, pet. In good time." Steve murmured, quickly pushing two fingers in and thrusting them in and out. "Gotta be good to get what you want."
"I have cigar burns on my thighs, Steve," he mumbled, jumping off the counter to wrap his arms around him, "Trust me, you'd have to really wail on me to hurt me. And even then--"
"Y'welcome," Peter grinned, peeking at Steve through his wet hair.
"Not telling. Not until the day we leave," Tony hummed, "And don't try to weasel it out of me, otherwise I'll change it to a different place. And I know you'd like to go to this place." He sifted a hand through Steve's hair, shifting slightly under him.
"Huh--oh." Tony inwardly cursed himself for forgetting to bandage himself up. He slipped off the bed, hissing slightly as he accidentally re-opened the cuts.
"Please don't leave Papa," Peter whispered, "I don' think his lil heart could take it."
"You're allowed. You can move with it, if you want to, Tony." Steve assured, slipping his hand past Tony's waistband and starting to palm him through his boxers. "I see you're already a bit eager, hm?"
Steve nodded in understanding then looked back down at Tony. With the look on Tony's face it was easy to tell that he had been exhausted, but at the same time he looked so tranquil and at peace. Steve took in every aspect of the expression. He could use this for the next part of his project.
Tony gasped softly, wrapping his arms and legs around Steve, smooching every piece of skin he could reach.
Tony lightly blushed as he looked up at the super soldier, who was wearing a smile that just radiated warmth. Tony cuddled up more in towards Steve's chest, finally feeling a sense of safety and warmth around him. The two stayed like that in comfortable silence for a while. Tony had thought Steve might have fallen asleep, so he broke the silence.
"Thank you, Peter, for telling me." Steve said carefully, turning to Tony again. "After dinner. You are showing me and I am treating you the best I can."
He snorted in laughter, almost rolling off the bed. Steve rolled his eyes, grabbing onto Tony before he rolled off the bed and holding him to his chest.
, Tony.
Peter stuck his tongue out at Tony, who rolled his eyes.
"I'm sorry, Papa... Sorry I yelled and made you sad." Peter apologized, nuzzling into Steve's stomach.
Steve winced at digging fingers, but was moaning from the angle. It had Tony hitting his sweet spot almost every time. "
"I got you," Tony murmured, slipping in a second finger once he felt Steve was adjusted, "You're doing beautifully, sweetheart. All relaxed for me."
"Okay baby," Tony kissed Peter's temple, going over to the kitchen to get them both juice boxes, "You excited for Christmas, lil peep?"
"I feel the same. Just after my growth spurt." Steve chuckled, sighing softly. "But you do make me feel younger. Makes me feel like I'm almost twenty years younger."
"I didn't say you did, but it'd be best to get it out of the way now, right?" Tony pointed out, standing up to trail after the boy, "I gotta change the sheets on your bed anyway, so we'll stuff you into new pajamas. Sound good?"
"It just happens, okay? Sorry about it." He murmured, moving a little uncomfortably.
"Jay, gimmie some rock and roll. Not too loud to break the soundproof, please," he called out, thrumming happily at his AC/DC.
The blond took it, shaking firmly. "Nice to meet you Tony. I actually meant the robot." he chuckled.
"I'm so sorry, Tony." Steve whispered quietly, moving to wrap his arms around Tony comfortingly. "I can't imagine-- I--I'm sorry that happened..."
"So how do we start?" He asked.
Tony immediately noticed Peter's change in demeanor, furrowing his brow in worry.
"Five-- Six--" Tony couldn't help the gasp that escaped his lips, moaning into the bed. "S-seven--" he groaned, "Eight--"
Steve chuckled, carefully scooping Peter up into his lap.
"Pretty great, right?" Tony chuckled, seeing Steve's enjoyment. "And I get some of the best beds. I accept no less."
The bike wobbled slightly as they slowed to their stop, Steve's control faltering slightly for obvious reasons.
"Mmm, lots of things I wanna try when you want to," Tony mumbled, a flush on his cheeks, "Just...stuff." He buried his embarrassed face in Steve's chest, trying to stop the heat from spreading.
Today was their third meeting since they agreed to actually, well, meet. Tony had taught him about the small things first, like shoes that covered their feet like armor and cell phones which let them communicate with humans, even if they were far away. Today though, Tony was talking about robots.
well. But I assume that's gonna happen when you keep shoving things in me. I mean, how many fingers did you add with that thing?"
"Eight years," Tony replied quietly, setting his empty coke can down, "I don't usually leave my apartment. Have you seen a little short guy, floppy brown hair, glasses, reeks of geek? That's my friend Bruce. He checks up on me now and again to make sure I'm eating and shit." He waved his hand, turning himself around so his head was in Steve's lap.
enough for a hospital trip--"
"We'll be back," he murmured softly, carrying Pete up to his room.
"Our own stamp on our place." Steve hummed. "I'm happy you had the idea to do this. I love it. I love you.".
Peter furrowed his brow, looking at Steve. "But you's been with plenty a peoples. You's with us right now."
"We have to get sheets and stuff, man. I'm not letting you fuck me on a plain mattress. You know how hard that would be to clean?"
"Sleep tight, bubba." Steve said with a soft smile, shutting the door quietly behind him.
He laughed breathlessly, tears prickling in his eyes despite himself.
"It'll be perfect, babe. I just know it." Steve hummed happily, hugging him tight. "It'll be the first thing to call ours." He said, nuzzling into Tony's hair.
The man stopped and gave Peter a look. "What are you smiling about, squirt?"
Steve smiled back at Tony, giving his hand a squeeze. He glanced back at Peter and Sammy in the back seat happily before buckling in and starting the car.
He stroked his hand across Steve's cheek, tucking a few stray hairs behind his ear.
Tony waited in bubbling nervousness for Steve to return with his treat, making grabby hands once he was back.
"I didn't know that. Well, lucky Daddy and I were born right before the 90s." Steve explained softly. "We have proof we are soulmates, too."
A tiny smile flickered onto Tony's face and he went back over to Steve, smooching his forehead. "Good. Get some sleep," he murmured.
He stopped when his eye caught two packages on their bed; with a wry smile, Tony picked up one, chuckling.
“I do too. It’s one of those places I never could even dream of having. It really is beautiful." He said wistfully, kissing the top of Tony's head.
Steve quickly reached up, covering up Peter's ears so he couldn't hear the words.
"Are you all ready to go?" The blond asked into the place before actually entering. "Or are you still beautifying?"
Sharon laughed, curls bouncing on her shoulders.
idea where he's been." Steve murmured with a pout, burying his face into his pillow.
"As long as its female strippers. And pretty but not too pretty. I'm terribly jealous and protective, come to find out." Steve admitted softly, playing with the last bits of food on his plate. "And I only didn't say it because I don't feel I should speak of it without my consultant present."
Tony grinned and swept over to Steve, going up on tiptoes to kiss him deeply. Steve kissed back just as deep and happily, cupping Tony's face in his hands as they kissed.
"I figured. Probably wanted to snooze with his Daddy." Steve smiled, looking over at Tony. "He might be jealous when he wakes up and finds you in here with Sammy and not him," he hummed teasingly.
Steve groaned, tilting his head up to give Tony more space.
The two went about plating up their dinner, settling down at the table to eat when Tony spoke up again.
Tony whimpered and laid himself over Steve's lap, trying to quell the arousal already building in his stomach. He put his head on the bed, clutching at the sheets while he waited with butterflies.
Steve groaned softly at the idea. "It is far more than okay, baby. I am
"Another thing; You need to keep your baby blues on up here on your dancing partner, Cap. Not on your feet." Tony said with a chuckle, raising up an eyebrow slightly following a smirk on his lips.
He scraped his teeth over Steve's collar, pushing him back toward the counter.
"I think it would be a great idea. Having a baby that's a part of us. Just raising a baby in general, really." Steve chuckled warmly.
good. Need ya to speed up a little, okay? Starting to get close..."
That's when he lost it. Tony completely broke down in Steve's arms, shaking uncontrollably. Steve hugged Tony close and tight to him, kissing along his face gently and wiping away the man's tears. He rocked his husband in his arms, shushing him softly. It took a few minutes for Tony to calm down, but he got there, eventually sniffling into Steve's shoulder.
"That's what I like to hear."
Steve started to move just a tad quicker, humming out soft moans as he did so. "'m not wantin' to torture ya, babe. Just want to go slow with it." He noised. "D'you not want that? You want something different?"
Steve replied with a gentle, half-asleep smile.
"I think he made some decent points." He murmured softly, glancing over at Tony for a split moment.
"Hey, Peter. Whatcha doing up?"
"Hey now, little boy. That isn't very nice." Steve sighed, picking the bottle up and carrying it to the sink. "No throwing bottles."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Consolation is a big word, buddy," Tony laughed, shaking his head, "But thank you, baby. It means a lot to me."
"Well," he drawled, more in a whine than anything else, "Yeah. You're right. But it's stuff that could be set off by
Tony grinned, leaning back to tug his shirt up and off, not ashamed of the scarring on his chest.
Steve lightly chuckled at the sight.
Steve sighed at the touch, not saying anything but kissing lovingly at Tony's skin. He rubbed softly at his husband's back and sides, just taking in the feeling of Tony and trying to be a comfort. Tony kept quiet, letting himself soak in Steve's warmth. He sighed, eventually tugging them so they were curled up on the bed.
Steve looked to him gently, a bit confused.
"I've got a cabin out west, and I wanna take Steve for a romantic getaway week and some. Candles, rose petals," He mumbled, a faint flush rising on his cheeks, "We were hoping you'd take squirt in so we could go."
"Uncle Buck, shhh, dh Gwinch's 'eart is 'bout t'gwow," Peter shushed, eyes glued to the TV.
"You know what's even better?" Steve started giving what Tony had already said a thought. "We could get one of those Pomeranian and Husky mixes. Have a bit of the big dog while still having the little dog?"
He smiled softly, giving Steve an eskimo kiss.
for a couple days. And it looks so pretty on you." the engineer preened, leaning down carefully with his hips against the others. He leaned down to try and make some more marks to match-- to earn him some more soft moans from the blond beneath him-- before he stopped in his tracks.
"That's what I like to hear."
"You're one to talk. I saw you hobbling around, James Buchanan. Quite surprised with you." Steve smirked right back at him.
"I have my ways," Tony laughed, putting utensils in a drawer.
"Yeah, yeah, Sleeping Beauty. I got it..." Steve said, rolling his eyes fondly with a yawn. "Let’s go, Peter. We'll make up breakfast and Daddy his coffee."
"You can't stop me from hurting, Steve, and I know you want to, but goddamn if you
"It’s fine, really. I'm just not used to it." He explained softly. "But if you're really my soulmate--and okay, have to get used to saying that, too-- then I am sure I can get used to it before long.".
"Holy shit..." He gasped, eyes fluttering as he sank into the bed.
would like to do for extra credit."
"Sorry, pipsqueak," Tony lowered his voice, screwing the last of the bassinet back together.
With a hum, he greased down the last of the joints, experimentally bending Bucky's fingers.
"It really does. We'll blink and they'll be grown-ups." Steve said quietly. "I don't even wanna think of my babies getting old. Not at all. They need to stay sweet babies forever."
--" Steve noised as the brunet mouthed gently at the tip, shivering under the attentions. "So fellatio is the name of the game?" He asked with a pant, softly moaning.
"Apparently from what I am told you have been spending a lot of time with this boy, more often than not." Howard's tone started to sound agitated. "People are starting to say things about the two of you. Things that I am not exactly fond of hearing.".
Peter squealed and quickly stuffed the cookie in his mouth, cheeks puffing up like a chipmunk.
"Of course." The creature chuckled. "It is very simple, but comes at a cost. The longer you wish to stay, the bigger the cost."
Peter sniffled and nodded, reaching up to rub the remnants of his tears from his eyes.
As Tony got up to grab two Cokes from the fridge, Steve settled on the couch, deciding to keep his shoes on. Once Tony returned, he took the can of Coke offered to him, thanking the other kindly.
"Hey Pep," Tony called, keeping himself tucked under Steve, "Commotion's in here."
He had spoke with Sam first, presenting the man with the shield in all seriousness. Steve knew Sam was the one to pass the Captain America mantle to. Both he and Bucky had discussed as much when they had spoke about if there should be a successor, and they had both agreed he was the right choice. That Sam would do them proud and uphold what the shield represented. They spoke for a bit and said their peace before it was Bucky's turn.
He put a hand on his forehead, closing his eyes to try and stop the onslaught of panic that crashed down on him, echoes of the video still playing in his head.
"Or so you
"So, what sorts of things do you have in mind?" Steve asked with a grin.
"Gwoss," Peter frowned, hopping off his chair, "M'gonna go play so you two can yell lots."
"What is this about Superman?" Steve asked as he entered the room, glancing down at the boy in amusement.
Steve nodded picking up the paddle. "Okay." He whispered as he ran the paddle softly along Tony's bottom. "Bend over, please."
"I mean, I'll be able to help him through elementary and middle school. Once we get a groove going, I think I'll be okay taking the bulk of the work." Steve explained. "But once he hits high school work, with algebra and physics, that's all you. I can probably do the history and English subjects."
There was a quiet knock at the door, followed by Tony's anxious voice.
"I'm allowed to smooch my boy. You had your chance all day today. I get a turn." Steve smirked playfully, setting the boy down at the table.
"Mhhm."
Steve kept with the spankings a bit longer, making his hits harder because Tony hadn't spoken up of it being too much yet. He just hoped he wasn't holding out on purpose.
"All a step at a time." Steve whispered happily, giving Tony eskimo kisses. "We'll have to spend time with Peter first when we get back, and we can tell him the news. Then, when we find out the gender, we'll be able to do all that for sure. God, I'm so excited."
"Mmm, I'm trying to find your boundaries still, and it's hard to do that when we go sexless for three weeks," Tony replied, stroking at Steve's back, "Which is going to change. I don't care
"He asleep?" Tony grinned, leaning over to kiss Steve's cheek, "Good. Okay, so I got him a few things--"
"Nuh uh," Peter replied, playing with Sammy's fingers, "M'little."
"It's called sex, Stevie. Look around, pick stuff you wanna try," Tony hummed, grabbing a cart, "I know we're gonna get you specific lingerie while we're here. And-- oh,
"You never got to tell me what all you did today either, Petey. Was it fun with Daddy?"
"Yeah," he grumbled, tucking his head against Steve's neck, "I can't reach m'favowite shirt, ish too high up in m'dwawer."
Steve felt his phone buzz in his pocket, reading the text with a warm smile as he cleaned up the kitchen.
"Mmm, love your mouth," Tony breathed, groaning softly, "So good, Stevie."
“I’m sure that wouldn’t be a problem,” Steve admitted, looking between both Tony and Bucky, “I’ve known him for so long, I could probably recognize him right off the bat.”
Tony pushed Steve back toward his table, already fumbling with Steve's belt.
Steve pulled Tony to him in the bed, kissing at all the skin he could lovingly.
"It could've waited for a while since you came to visit." Steve sighed. "He...feels bad because he thought you could've been some woman I was seeing on the side."
Tony buried his face in the comforter, mentally ticking off everything he was being punished for; the tears didn't prick up in his eyes just yet, but he let himself be susceptible to the pain, and not the pleasure. Steve continued to swing the paddle a bit harder each time he swung, listening out for Tony's voice in case he was going too hard.
Tony moaned shamelessly, rocking against his fingers.
“That is why I’ve called you here. To explain what’s been going on.” Steve said carefully, trying to keep his voice firm and steady despite sitting there naked in front of his team. “It’s something I thought could be kept out of team knowledge until we recently found out that dealing with the issue is going to take a lot longer than expected.”
mmh hm." Steve hummed in understanding, holding in a groan and trying to keep from moving back on whatever Tony was using. He hadn't looked back to see this whole time, and now he definitely wouldn't know if he wasn't supposed to move.
A dozy Steve let out another pained groan as he felt Tony’s hand stroke his bicep.
"You 'n Papa have been real good, too. So youse should gets lotsa stuffs, too." Peter explained, sipping out of his juice box. "Youse da best daddies."
"Otay," he murmured, leaning into Steve's touch.
"Since you seem to think it funny to make more of a mess, you get to clean it yourself and don't get to stop until it’s clean." Steve said with a huff. "I don't know what has gotten into you lately, but it needs to stop."
As he ate, he saved both Tony and Peter a piece for their work, taking his plate to them in the kitchen as he came back to it nearly spotless.
"If you want to, you can," Tony replied, already starting to wash the dishes.
into busty blonds, and judging by your size, I hit jackpot,” Tony nodded very seriously, grinning up a Steve, "Go work cowboy, I'll be here working away. I'll leave the door unlocked."
"Like a big playgwound?"
"Yep. To get them to go faster." Tony grinned cheekily, picking one of the lighter ones up.
He grinned, sticking his tongue out.
"Not a problem. Not a problem at all." Steve said with a grin, watching as the baby suckled hungrily at the bottle. "Hungry little guy, ain't he?" He chuckled.
Steve leaned up in the bed concerned, about to get up and ready if he needed. "What happened, is Peter all right?"
"Peter wanted to surprise us, but I ruined the surprise for myself." Steve admitted softly, eyeing his husband and then looking to his boys. "Ain't it something?"
"JARVIS, keep record of this. Sammy's making a breakthrough and I want Tony to be able to see it later." He asked quietly, eyes locked on Sammy. "You've got this, baby boy. I know you do."
"Hey Steve?"
"You doodle me first, then you can position yourself and whatever," Tony hummed, letting Steve put him on the wall.
"He won't for long!" Steve declared once the food was in the oven and a timer was set. He playfully stomped towards Peter with monster growls, scooping him up to smooch all over the boy's face.
"I suppose, if that what you all wanna do." Steve said with a shrug through a bite of cake. "But if we do, nobody is driving home tonight. There is plenty of room here, so you all would crash here." He explained sternly.
"You know exactly what. Playing dumb isn't your forte." The blond stated, still refusing to look. "Seven letter word meaning to be strongly attracted to someone?"
"We should get a dog." Tony paused. "Or a cat. Like, since children are really far off, puppies are good for coddling, right? Or cats. Cats can be nasty things, though. No turtles--or snakes. Maybe hamsters, but only if it's really cute--"
Steve huffed a laugh, snuggling closer.
"THAT WAS ONE TIME!"
"What'd you and Papa have to talk about?" He asked curiously, resting his head on Tony's chest.
"Felt
"I can't do this, Steve," Tony finally whispered, voice hoarse as he calmed down, only to start crying again.
Peter sighed dramatically, scooting closer to them.
He leaned against him, pressing a kiss into his chest.
"Papaaa, we's in
Tony sneezed again, groaning as he stood on shaky legs to put the wicks out. He snuffled again, pausing before sneezing for a third time, effectively smacking his head into the dresser.
"You're terrible." Tony huffed, picking at a string on Steve's shirt. "We should probably talk about that. The sex stuff."
"Mm. Work. I need to finish a few projects before we leave," Tony sighed wearily, "I really need to get caught up. I'll take tomorrow to bust those out, and sign a bunch of papers for Pep, start the schematics for the next line of Starkphones, and edit Jay's coding so he can be transportable on my phone--"
He grinned, leaning forward to smooch Steve's forehead.
Two weeks had passed since the last drawing session, but Steve and Tony hung out as much as they could outside of their class schedules. They would pretty much just enjoy each other's company, talking to one another as if they had been friends since childhood.
"Eaaasy there, munchkin!" Steve chuckled. "Let us get you a piece so we can cut it up, okay? We'll help you fix your plate up."
"In here." Bucky called back softly, carrying a pajama'd Peter in his arms.
The trickle had pretty much stopped, allowing Tony to sit up a bit more.
"Believe me, leave it to those that like it," Tony sighed, drying the glasses and stacking them away, "I've tried, but Natasha's a born and raised Russian. She talks circles around me."
"You're gonna be the death of me," Tony laughed quietly, leaning up to suck at Steve's collarbone.
"Daddy! No-o-o-ooooo!" He cried through laughter.
The blond's eyes popped open, thinking he had heard something. Steve listened carefully in case he'd hear it again.
"He was joking," Nat rolled her eyes, "No strippers, nothing. It'll be the ladies and you, the lads and Tony. That is, unless he's wearing the white tux."
e'sta cookies f'that!"
now and not the other way around-, Tony relaxed into it, body leaning closer for more of the comfort Steve was currently exuding.
"Time to fill in the outlines. I'll do yours, you'll do mine?"
"C'mon, Daddy! Presents!" Steve called to Tony with a playful grin, bouncy Peter on his lap.
"One--"
"I know, I know, but still," Tony frowned, "I--It didn't-- Come on. You and I are going to sleep together. Right now. Because I love you." He grabbed Steve's hand, attempting to drag him back upstairs.
"Done. I'd love it hung up. It'd be cute." He hummed, leaning with the touches. He look up and over at Peter with a smile. "They're so sweet when they're asleep. Kids." He hummed.
"I know you do. But breaks are important. Otherwise that mind of your's won't function right, anyhow." Steve yawned, hugging Tony closer. "Sleep now, though. Talk about things later.”
"Papaaa, I can't find m'sneakers!" Peter yelled, pouting as he stuck his head into the nursery, "Ew. Babies are gwoss."
Steve was glad Peter was excited, sighing relieved as he put their dishes away.
Steve moved Tony softly around, making him face the desk and running a hand down his back.
The scream from upstairs was enough justification that Peter had found his gift. With a grin, Tony took his keys out of his pocket, jingling them before standing to go upstairs with the small party. Peter was already bouncing around outside the door, desperation written all over his face.
"That is a nice part. She's got a nifty collection, huh?" Steve hummed sweetly. "I like when they beat Ursula and they get a happy ending. The book isn't as happy as the movie, so it’s nice."
"Maybe." He hummed, petting Peter's hair. "Anyway, because of that bond, we know there is no one else better for us out there than each other. So you don't need to worry about Daddy and I separating, okay?" Steve looked down at Peter with a soft smile.
The blond nodded. "Yep. It’s how they explore at his age since he can't crawl or walk or talk just yet." He explained gently.
He bit down onto the blond's collar to keep from crying out, coming in spurts over Steve's chest.
"Don't worry Peter, I'm sure your fathers will change the subject," Sharon laughed, setting the empty bottle aside.
"C'mon, you. We got some unpacking to do."
still feel a little awkward about it when you show me new things. But at least he will be well informed." He hummed, leaning in to kiss Tony sweetly.
"All right. Emergency numbers are on the fridge along with the circumstances of which those numbers should be called. Make sure Peter studies for at least a couple hours throughout the day, and be sure--".
idea--"
"I can't--I can't help but imagine your cock, Sir," Tony mumbled, trying so very hard not to laugh, "I can always tell that days you don't wear underwear, 'cause it’s really evident in your trousers."
"Sure thing, bubba. But we are gonna start with a cartoon cat since we don't have a real one for reference." Steve hummed, taking the pen and a piece of paper.
"Papa!" He shrieked, trying to squirm out of his arms.
Tony snorted at that, laughing quietly. "Well, I think we could get away with it if we kept your place sex-free, then slept there the night before," he mused, "That could work."
Peter turned over in his bed and hugged Wade closer to his chest, frowning at the wall.
"Let’s get your hands washed and ready to eat, huh?" He said with a smooch to the cheek, beckoning the others to follow.
"He's six, and I'm the more lenient parent," Tony laughed, stretching his back, "If I was the strict one, he'd be trotting at your heels."
"How come we get to have cookies, Papa?" Peter asked carefully.
"It's ordered," Tony announced, phone in his hand, "Best get a move on, Barton. Guiseppe's closes at eight tonight."
"Yeah baby, he did," Tony laughed, carrying the child downstairs, "You wanna help me set the table?"
He yawned, slowly getting up before changing into day clothes, padding out behind Steve to the kitchen, who was searching around for ingredients and tools for omelets. Once he set things up, he got Tony's coffee started in the machine.
to eat."
"Do they let you visit the baby and everything after birth? Like, without breaking a contract or anything, that is." He asked softly. "I mean if you want--if you want-- you can visit it if you are allowed. I would think it’s only fair, so--"
"Goddamn," he muttered, "Is this what giving birth feels like?"
"Do you actually have a box just for things not to touch again?" Steve asked with a grin of amusement. "Remind me to go looking for that. I'm curious."
"What?"
"I won't tell if you won't, Sir..." He whispered gently, eyes fluttering half-lidded.
"You--are heavy," he wheezed, laughing as he turned on the hot water, "Very heavy."
tattoo; gulping, Tony tried his hardest to replicate Steve's tattoo.
"There's my lil man, all better," Tony murmured, happily bouncing Sammy around.
Raavi eyed Steve carefully with a soft grin, Steve clearly a bit embarrassed by the action.
Steve pulled Tony into a quick hug, wrapping an arm around his waist to help lead him back down to the kitchen.
"It was across the
mother did to help
Tony waited for the others to leave before putting Peter down, nodding.
"You really are insatiable..." Steve muttered, whining again softly when Tony's lips touched his tip. "You were so close to Peter walking in here."
"Love you, y'dork..." Steve whispered, letting his eyes fall and instantly going to sleep.
"But Sir--"
"Oh my God, seriously?" He said in the middle of his chuckle.
"Don't cry, Sammy. You'll get ta eats big people foods soon. Jus' not yet." The boy explained, handing the boy his teether again.
"Lil brotha!" Peter shouted, accidentally tossing his fork to the floor, "We's goin' to the hop'ital!"
"I love you too, baby. For better or worse." Steve hummed sweetly, bringing Tony in for a deep kiss. He moved his hands down along Tony's sides gently, caressing him.
"Greedy," Tony scolded lightly, smacking Steve's backside as he walked back to the desk, "Clean yourself up, then you can have fun with me."
!" Peter exclaimed, grinning at Steve's knowing smile.
Woo! Another chapter in before work today! I know these chapters are a bit short, its how I am able to work the story out as I go, so I hope you enjoy regardless!
Steve swooped in for a few kisses of his own on Peter's cheeks.
"You contributed to that, Mr. Ride me off into the sunset." Steve replied with a half asleep smirk, leaning up with a stretch and getting out of bed to get Sammy.
He closed his eyes with a gentle sigh, easily drifting to sleep.
"Yeah." The boy hiccupped as he tried to calm down from his laughs. "We gonna eat lunch?" He asked softly, resting his head on Tony's shoulder.
"That's what babies do, honey," he sighed, "They need a lot of attention because they can't do much for themselves. I'll make sure that Papa spends more time with you, okay? I'll try to work from home more, and take care of Sammy so you two can spend time together, okay?"
"Wanted a kiss." Steve said with a cheeky smirk, kissing at Tony's thumb as he wiped. "Can't get enough of them." He hummed.
"Nuh uh, Sammy, don' wan'chu to get sick too," Peter replied weakly, trying to keep the baby's hands away, "Maybe tomorrow."
"Now then," Fury continued at a normal tone, "Don't be going towards any more humans. Is that understood, Captain?"
“He totally likes you,” Nat announced once they were sure Tony couldn’t hear them.
“My cousin told me about it.”
Tony was a bit late, but appeared with a huge smile on his face.
Steve’s daydream was interrupted, “The thing?”
“Your circle wall thingies all say 730 minutes.”
Steve closed his eyes while the safety video played on the small, crappy plane screen. His parents always insisted on sending away for the summer and this time he was being forced to stay with some distant cousin he had never met in California. As soon as June 1st had rolled around, they bought him a coach plane ticket and sent him on his way.
In that moment Steve decided that he had to tell Tony about his memory. Tell him about his feelings. He knew right then would probably be really bad since everyone was sitting around him and Tony seemed like he was in a bad mood.
“Oh.” Tony still looked confused, “Why?”
Steve was really tired of everyone trying to tell him what was best, “Whatever. I’ll tell him on Wednesday before the art show. Okay?”
Peggy smiled and closed the door. He heard the engine turn on and slowly fade as Peggy drove away. Steve sighed and made his way to his room. The room was a light grey color with a queen size bed against the wall. There was a small desk next to large glass double doors that led to a balcony overlooking the beach. The walls were adorned with various ocean themed decorations and prints. The bed had blue sheets and a lighter blue rug underneath.
“Tony?” Steve rubbed his eyes and tried to catch his breath.
Steve blinked and said, “Um, no. No. Magic is technically not a real thing on land.”
“Already? Well, come on in for a bit. I have to get my backpack ready.”
Steve and Peter climbed the rock and dropped onto the sand on the other side of the cove. Steve’s note was gone, but nothing was left in return. Steve looked all around the rock hoping to see something left there for him, but nothing was there. Maybe the shell just washed up here.
The little kid smiled and said, “Do you want me to show you around?”
“Oh, um. You got a girlfriend?”
Steve yawned and walked to his room. He wrote down “go to bakery” on his hand before falling onto his bed. He took a minute to process everything that had happened. Steve took the advice he got and locked it up in his brain for safe keeping. Steve sighed and closed his eyes. Sleep came easily and he was gone within minutes.
“You’ve really never heard of Van Gogh or Monet?”
Once it was lunchtime, Steve asked, “Can you take me to Sandy’s Bakery?
“Steve!”
They reached the end of the museum, laughter still hung in the air like a fine mist diffusing into all corners of the room. Steve only had five hours left before he had to tell Tony everything. Though he was trying to enjoy the moments of friendship, the pressure was building.
"Oh- oh- my god. Umm, ha ha sorry. I'm just- Um, trying not to- Uh bleed out. You know. The usual." Tony could feel the blood draining out of his body as he spoke. The world was crashing down on him.
Tony had his tail in the water and Steve lying down with his knees bent. They were sitting shoulder to shoulder admiring the sunset.
Tony heard Bucky's mocking voice and whipped around. When he saw Bucky and Steve sitting on the couch, he turned completely white.
“This is so you’ll blend in.”
“Who even uses DVDs anymore?” Tony mumbled to himself.
“Okay. See you in August.”
“I was watching the sun rise and then I just decided to stay here.”
“Everyone knows everyone around here and you’re not from here.”
Steve didn’t feel like questioning her logic and followed the instructions. One he had drank the full glass of water he began sipping at his OJ.
“It’s okay. I’ll just wait at the cove until I turn back that way I’m near the water.”
When the approached the restaurant Steve saw a small redhead and long brown hair that Steve knew well.
Tony’s face fell, “How am I going to keep it? It’ll get ruined underwater.”
“What are you doing?”
“What can I do for you, Steve?”
“What is there to say?”
“Well you’re up early,” she said without turning around.
“Someone they spend their life with. That they love?” Steve’s hear stopped.
Tony walked toward him slowly as if Steve was a wild animal. They made direct eye contact, but neither of them spoke.
“M-Me either. U-u-um who are you staying with?”
Natasha whispered back, “Tony, just breathe. We won’t let him go if you don’t want him to.”
Steve ran before he could get an answer. His heart was beating fast and he couldn’t think straight. He made his way to the house where Peggy would be waiting to go. She had been invited to come along since she knew Natasha.
funny, Barnes. So funny I forgot to laugh. And you can call me Tony if you want." Tony was desperate to leave and hide in his workshop forever.
“Can I tell Peggy?”
Steve once again heard strange noises coming from in front of him, but when he opened his eyes he saw a face hiding behind a rock on the border of the cove. The face was young, about the same as Steve (if he guessed correctly), a boy (probably) with brown, curly hair that flopped everywhere, and big—beautiful—brown eyes that stared at him intently. Steve was immediately infatuated. He wanted to say something but nothing would come out of his mouth. The boy blinked, and disappeared into (what seemed like) thin air.
Bucky held the door open for everyone and said, “Let’s eat!”
happy. Giddy even.
since Tony had never seen it.
On their usual Thursday movie night, the Avengers chose to watch a kids movie to distract themselves from the thought of losing Steve. They decided to watch
“Steve I’m too scared. I am not a trained professional. I’ve only had legs for like two days. You’ve had them your whole life. ” Steve could hear the genuine fear in Tony’s voice. He felt bad for pushing him, but didn’t realize he would react so seriously.
"Lookin' good, Stark!"
“Yeah, you got it.” Steve hopped onto the swing next to him and soon the boys were swinging in sync, smiling and occasionally trying to high five when they passed each other. Steve had time to reflect on everything that had happened. A few months ago he was just a bored 17-year-old with no hope for the future and a plane ticket to California. Now he was still 17, but in love with a merman, no less, forgetting about what the rest of his life held in store only focusing on the crazy brunette swinging wildly next to him screaming and laughing just like a kid.
The kid stared up at him, “You’re new around here.”
“Why would you want to go there?”
Steve walked over to where Tony was still swinging and hanging on tight to the chains. “It’s okay, Tony. I’m here. I’m just going to grab the chain and slow you down, okay?”
Pepper handed Tony a DVD. It said “In Case of Emergency” on the disk. Tony chuckled and grabbed it from her hand.
“Who are you?”
Pepper started, "Tony, it's a movie-"
Tony realized what he had said and moved away from Steve, his face was clearly red, “Wow, um, I did not mean that. I’m sorry. I just say things sometimes and I didn’t know what I was thinking. I mean, I probably will like Bucky and I bet he’s a really great friend. I guess I just meant that it’s good that you guys have such a good friendship. I’m sorry.”
“Peggy grew up around here?”
When the doctors told him that Steve was suffering severe head trauma and would probably not remember him was the day Tony broke. He cried. He cried for hours. For days. It took Pepper and Rhodey three full days to get Tony to calm down enough to talk to Sam about his problems. Sam listened, cried with him, helped him through the pain. Tony couldn't bear the thought that he would look at Steve and there would be no recollection of anything they had together.
Tony nodded. Steve moved precisely and grabbed the chain from midair stepping out of the way so as not to get hit by Tony’s legs. When the swing came to a full stop, Tony jumped off and fell into Steve’s arms.
“How do they do that?”
“Tony, you know that we are worried about you. I’m sorry I can’t be here for you more often. Please know that if you need to talk, call me. I’ll always pick up even though you don’t always pick up my calls.”
Steve nodded as tears fell from eyes.
“Alright everyone, the store is closing,” Sandy announced. “Bidding starts now so get out your checkbooks, it’s for a great cause!”
The shallow water came up pretty high into the cove, but there was still room to walk around. The water was clear and turquoise and made Steve feel happy. He didn’t know why, but something put his mind at peace.
“Oh right. Guys, this is Tony. Tony these are the friends I was telling you about.”
When Steve reached the rock, he stopped. He didn’t know why he was scared to climb over, but something inside him was telling him not to do it. Steve ignored his brain and climbed the rock. His heart beat loudly in his chest as he saw something on the rock.
Steve paused and thought about it. “Fine. You can come.”
“Well, took you long enough. Let’s go.”
“YES!” Steve yelled excitedly. He realized he was probably loud so he dropped over the edge and ran over to the object.
Tony once made the mistake of checking on Steve after he had worked out. It had turned out to be an awful decision as he almost started crying when it was over. Tony left with a fire in his soul pushing him to work harder and for longer hours.
played aimlessly in the background as Steve imagined what it would be like to cuddle with Tony. He had to stop himself a few times from laughing out loud thinking about cuddling with Tony while he had a tail. One thing that made him feel better was the fact that he could stare at Tony as he slept without any judgement. He conceded to studying the curves of his face, noting his
Tony scooted over to Steve and pulled him into a hug that caused both the boys to fall into the sand, tangled in each other’s arms. They laughed and stayed like that for a little bit.
“Well, my friend is coming into town in a week.”
When Tony found the camera app the screen looked black. “How do I turn this on?”
Steve also brought Tony some human food to try which Tony ended up loving so much that Steve started bringing food to all their hangouts. Steve was really falling for Tony, but he couldn’t tell if Tony felt the same way at all.
“Two of your Sandy’s sandwiches please!” Peter said cheerfully and went to a table near the window.
“Well, shops don’t open until 9:30 so you have some time before you go.”
“Sounds interesting. What else?”
“I have to go help set everything up. I told Sandy I would. You can come if you want.”
After an hour of drawing and thinking Steve decided to leave one of the sketches of the face. He knew it was a silly sentiment, but maybe someone would fine it and recognize him.
I'm so sorry that this is coming almost 2 years later... it's so hard to believe that I was writing this 2 years ago like damn. Anyway, if you're still here, HERE YOU GO. It's not over yet, but here's another chapter :)
“I’m sorry. I promised Bucky. I can’t break a promise.”
After spending a few hours in the park, listening to music, mostly silent except for a few words here and there, Steve got up.
“Some of them.”
Peter hopped off the dolphin statue he was sitting on and led Steve back up the pier. They made a right and followed the beach for a bit until they reached a hole in the wall type place with a bright sign that read “Sandy’s Bakery.” Peter pulled the door open and Steve was welcomed by the smell of bread and cookies.
Finally, the time came. He excused himself and took off. He ran as hard as he could away from the crowds and back towards the cove. He didn’t care how out of breath he was, he needed to get to Tony. He reached the cove just as the sun began to reach the horizon.
Once they finished eating, Sandy pulled a chair up to their table, “Show me what you got, sugar.”
“Awesome.”
The words felt heavy as they rolled off his tongue. The rest of the avengers looked heartbroken for Steve. They knew how much Steve had gone through.
“Alright! There you go. Now just move your legs a little. Put them straight out when you go forward. Bend them back when you move back.”
bone structure.
“Hey. So I got some good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?”
Pepper squeezed him tighter. Tony’s close friends all knew that Tony had self esteem and self worth issues and shouldn’t be left alone with them. Tony felt so small in Pepper’s arms. There was a pit in his stomach and all he could see was Steve’s face after Tony had gotten mad.
Tony learned that he could become human for a week, but it would take a little while to track down someone who could do it. Steve was beyond excited when he found out, but made sure to play it down so Tony wouldn’t get freaked out.
They started off the morning with a breakfast of funnel cake, followed by a ride on a dangerous looking roller coaster called “The Zipper”, they moved onto the infamous Gravitron (where Tony ended up being upside down the whole time), rode the Kamikaze ride about seven times switching partners and even finding a few strangers to sit next to, and finally topped it all off with lemonade and ice cream.
Sandy had dark skin and her curly hair was pulled back into a bun. She looked like she was in her mid forties, but Steve couldn’t be sure and didn’t want to ask. Her smile and eyes radiated warmth and love.
“It’s 9:30. Why? Do you have somewhere to be?” Steve asked teasingly.
They spent a few minutes without talking, both taking in the whole fair and the beach very close by.
“Um, yeah. I mean sometimes it’s called a partner, but most of the time it’s called either a boyfriend or girlfriend or wife or husband. These days, those words often don’t even guarantee they’ll stay together.”
Sandy popped up and saw Steve standing with Peter, “Well who’s this handsome fella?”
“Here, look.” Steve opened the book to the pages of Tony’s face. He felt silly showing him, but Tony was genuinely interested. He smiled at all the pictures and insisted that Steve showed him others. They flipped through the book stopping when Tony didn’t recognize something human.
Steve’s heart jumped after what Tony had said and how close he had gotten. Finally for the first time since he got back Tony had gotten almost up in his face.
Steve hated that his friends were fighting over him. He felt so helpless in that moment because he couldn’t do anything. He was useless on the field and useless if he stayed behind. Steve began to feel self loathing creeping at the back of his brain.
Steve packed his bag and the four were on the road in no time. Nat drove them with Bucky in the front and Tony and Steve in the back. Steve was in and out of consciousness the whole time while Bucky bombarded Tony with questions about where he lived and what school he went to. Tony answered the questions without any indication of his fishy situation (pun certainly intended).
“Well hi there, Steve from New York. What brings you to our sleepy town?”
The rest of the day passed by slowly. Steve was getting antsy and didn’t have anything to do while he waited. Once it was 6:00, Steve grabbed his bag and ran out the door leaving a note to Peggy saying he would be home late. Steve jogged down the beach scared and excited for the meet up. As Steve was approaching the entrance, he stopped. He realized that maybe someone was messing with him or the note was for something else.
“Wow Buck, you sound excited. What’s up?”
“Awesome. Well, I gotta go. My parents still forced me to do summer school and I have homework as if I didn’t leave school.”
“Just jump, dummy.”
The cold undertone in Tony’s voice hit Steve like a ton of bricks. Steve had really messed up now cause Tony was no longer bubbly and smiling Tony and was instead an aloof and cold version of himself.
arm off! I'm a grown ass adult, I should be able to do this without injury."
Steve thought that maybe this trip could give him time to come up with a plan for the future. Unlike his friends, Steve had no future he was set on; he was pretty good at a lot of things, but not amazing at just one thing. The only thing that Steve could almost qualify was his love for art. His parents hadn’t been to happy with that idea.
Steve approached the town’s center and could see it had many buildings painted turquoise, yellow, or pink. It all felt fake as Steve passed friends getting coffee and children running around unattended. There was a long pier lined with small stands. It was completely unlike New York, but Steve kind of liked it. On Steve’s left was a small building that was the “Mermaid Museum” which apparently documented the sightings over the years and had real artifacts. Steve chuckled to himself and bought a ticket.
Steve couldn’t tell if Tony was being nice or condescending but it made something in him turn sour. Maybe it was the tone that Tony had used, but Steve felt extremely defensive.
Steve didn’t know how he knew or what made him realize it, but something in the way Tony talked and the words that he chose made him see that something in Tony cares. Natasha knows what it is, but she probably wouldn’t tell Steve anyway.
Steve hung up the phone and looked out at the spot where he saw the face, but nothing was there. Steve sighed and rubbed his eyes. He was obviously still just tired from the flight. Steve left the cove trying to engrain the face into his mind so he could draw it. He picked up his things, shoved them in his backpack and walked back to Peggy’s house.
“What else is there?”
Steve and Tony shifted to a more comfortable position where they were both lying on the sand watching the sun set. The conversation was over as quickly as it started and they began talking about the situation with Bucky; neither could come up with a solution.
Steve laughed, “Yeah. Distant cousins. My parents don’t like me just hanging around at home during the summer so they send me somewhere with some relative I’ve never met.”
“Well, a long time ago, it was said that there was a boy about seventeen years old who came to the beach every day and surfed. One day he was part of a surfing competition but the waves were rough! He tried his best to stay on, but got knocked down by a wave!”
Tony and Steve had moved onto the sand so Tony could put his tail in the water. Tony was lying down looking up at the stars while Steve was sitting cross-legged next to him staring at the horizon. It was dark now and the beach was quiet except for the waves.
When Steve got back home, Peggy was watching the news and eating cereal. She waved and Steve gave her an enthusiastic smile. Steve still had the whole day to try to keep himself busy, so he decided to work his stuff for the festival. Steve pulled out the easel he was borrowing and his paints and headed to the balcony. It was hot, but not unbearable so Steve put on some music and began painting. He had been working on a nice landscape of the ocean side but decided to add something.
“Fine, but you can’t expect me to play nice when he isn’t being cooperative either. He barely trusts anyone except Sam and Bucky...” The voices faded away and Steve felt sick to his stomach.
“Uh, hi. I’m Tony.”
“I hurt him Nat. What is there to say?”
“Whoops, I have a piano lesson at 4:30.”
“Um, I guess the bad news so the good news will be better.”
“You don’t say,” Steve muttered.
“Oh, give it to me.” Tony handed the phone back to Steve who turned the flash on and said, “Smile!” The screen lit up and took a photo of the boys smiling like idiots. “I have to go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The fair was crowded for a Monday morning, but that didn’t stop the kids from having the craziest Monday morning ever.
“All you have to do is start moving your legs back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Put a little of your body weight into it. Back and forth.” Tony was struggling with the concept only making his swing move minimally. “Why don’t I just push you. It’ll be easier.”
“Peggy Carter. She lives a few miles down.”
“It’s no problem. Plus, the fun is not over yet. And, yeah, this view is pretty stellar.” Steve watched the passing ships in the distance not noticing that when Tony was talking about the view, he was really looking at Steve.
Tony and Steve spent the morning packing up the art that Steve was donating to the auction and moving the pieces into Peggy’s car. They had to take a few trips because some were smaller canvases while others were big paintings. How Steve had managed to finish all that art was astounding.
“It’s okay. We are pretty secretive.” Tony shrugged and added, “Plus, you’re new around here.”
Steve swallowed hard, “No. Of course not, but I have to get through this art show first.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They walked over to the store where Peter was waiting outside.
"I don't care. I want to be prepared. I want him back. I need him back."
“Yeah. See you soon.”
“Yeah. I saw your face a couple weeks ago and couldn’t get it out of my head.”
The day after Steve had been admitted to the Hospital, Tony couldn't sleep. He stayed up every night working on some meaningless project trying to distract himself from the pain and longing. Rhodey made him leave the house a few times to go to the grocery store and Pepper brought him food and water so he wouldn't pass out. He missed Steve. Very much. He didn't know he he had gone the first 40 something years of his life without him.
Tony backed away and Steve’s heart fell. He wanted Tony back in his space, to feel his heat. Steve also realized something very important: Tony doesn’t hate him.
Wednesday came and Steve was beyond nervous. He not only had the art show that Sandy was counting on him to deliver on, but he promised Bucky and Natasha that he would reveal his true feelings for Tony. It was going to be a stressful day.
Mrs. Johnson led Steve past the erotic novels and past the autobiographies to a small shelf in the back. There only a few books, but Tony would love them nonetheless.
“Got it.”
Steve rushed over to the bench, “Hey, I gotta go change but I want to spend this last hour with you so hang out with Sandy until I’m done.” Tony nodded and solemnly walked over to the bakery where Sandy was busily waiting tables and chatting with customers.
“Hi Mom.”
Steve fiddled with his sweatshirt, “And um, it might seem boring, but there is an art show to raise money for the local school and they asked me to make some art for it. I don’t know if you want to come and see it or whatever. You don’t have to if you don’t want to-”
