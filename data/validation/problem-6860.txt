His initial assessment when figuring out that AIM was working with Hydra had been correct; there were definitely more Hydra soldiers than the almost dozen that he originally had counted, and all of them were hands on deck and in full battle mode.
“Don’t be such a sore loser, Clint,” Coulson called evenly. He seemed little interested in the team's antics, but his efforts to appear nonchalant were unnecessary in front of the Avengers family, especially when his lips kept twisting in amusement like that, "We always knew that you weren't going to win this one."
The natural response for reading something as ridiculous as that – much to Rhodey’s chagrin – was to chuckle at the paper’s imagination and mock the journalist's professionalism. That was, of course, until he fully unfolded the newspaper and found a very clear, very undeniable picture of Steve Rogers kissing a pretty hot blonde woman, whose identity wasn’t clear from the way Rogers’ face blocked her from view; she had her hands around the icon’s neck and the super soldier’s were on her shoulders in a hold that could only be describe as
When Rhodey first met Tony, he was pretty much scandalized about the flow of published words that described in detail a particularly shocking photo, but as he got to actually know him more and he started to actually
With JARVIS he had never had a problem before and they have actually teamed up against Tony before. So:
“Captain,” she finally interrupted him to disperse the awkwardness of the situation, “What is it that you need?”
Taking advantage of Tony’s obedient daze, Steve quickly got rid of his shirt for the brunette and then he went straight to Tony’s pants, unbuttoning them and yanking them out of the way along with the useless black underwear. He manoeuvred Tony to fully seat on his lap with his legs straddling him.
“How did you…?” Tony tried to ask, surprise reflected in his eyes. Steve could even recognize the hint of anger hidden in the depth of his dark-blue orbs. Tony was now pushing against his chest trying to make Steve let go so he could create some distance between them, except that Steve didn’t let him; he knew that Tony was more prone to get mad at him when he was out of his arms and the blonde simply didn’t feel like letting go, anyway. In addition, Steve really wanted all of this sorted out as soon as possible, which was unlikely to happen if he had to chase after Tony.
As he recovered his sight, so did the Hydra and AIM soldiers who came into the open space of the warehouse at the commotion. Without hesitating, they started shooting at everything that moved and looked slightly enemy, including Peter, but their aim was diverted by three more well-placed arrows into the shoulders of the thugs gunning for his son. Tony’s heart (his poor, damaged heart) skipped another beat at the sight.
Tony was probably the only reason this whole situation was bothering him, considering that he normally wouldn’t give a darn about how someone he barely knew felt about him. Except this was Tony’s best friend; one of the very few people that had stood by Tony’s side through every hardship he’d encountered.
“I love you,” Steve whispered again in Tony’s ear when they were both expended. Steve had rearranged their positions so that he was now with his back on the couch with Tony mostly on top of him, the brunette’s arc reactor shining softly between them, “So much.”
Even if everything screamed to Rhodey to go and hunt something blue, white and red, his rational part of mind understood that he was the voice of reason between the two of them in that moment.
struggled a lot when all of this started, but Steve was never one to give up on the few worthy things that crashed into his life, and he was glad that he had never given up on Tony. The genius was getting better by the day at the ‘relationship stuff’, as he called it.
“Steve, I couldn’t get here in time because Obadiah threw a last-minute formal banquet in honour of our new guest and all. They wouldn’t allow me to retire early because, apparently, I have to be paraded all night for them to be happy with me.” The bitterness of his voice was enough to soften the clear blue eyes of his mate. Steven knew how awful was for Anthony when he was treated like a prize that would go to the higher bidder. It just provoked the taller man to demand his distressed lover's lips again, but this time it was a tender and comforting kiss.
Yeah, he’d take those thoughts to the grave. Or at least nowhere near Charles Xavier… nor his creepy magnetic villain of a boyfriend. Just in case.
At Steve's silence, Tony scowled a little in suspicion. “Don’t worry; you don’t have to tell me, we had a discussion about you a few days after we told him about us, so I can easily guess.”
Lord Obadiah Stane, the main reason why they couldn’t be together because of his threats and dark magic, suspected of their affair. Judging Anthony’s expression, he knew that too.
“You’re right, I shouldn’t bring you coffee when you’re obviously sleep deprived,” he said with a convincing shrug, “I should probably just go to let you catch some sleep.”
I haven't finished it, really, it seems real life won't ever allow me to. BUT I loved the comments that you guys left me and the tons of kudos and I got inspired to post another 4 chapters and leave them as the complete story, for now! I'll be posting, hopefully, at least once a week.
Dove swings back around to their table a couple of minutes later, her eyes darting over to the bathroom door. “You two doin’ alright over here?” She asks, a slightly nervous lilt to her voice. “Can I get you anything else?”
Tony thinks back to the choppy bits of his memory, but the more he tries to grasp onto details, the quicker they slip away, just like any other dream. Every time he had awoken over the past few days, he remembered the encounter so vividly for only a few seconds before it faded to nothing but the memory of pain and fear. “I don’t,” he says quietly. “I’m sorry, I won’t have anything helpful to tell the police. It was just a group of drunk guys at that bar. I didn’t get a good look at their faces. If they weren’t able to pull anything from CCTV then there’s nothing more I can offer them.”
Tony lets his head hit the ground with relief. The game still has half of an inning left, but he knows they’ve won. Somewhere distant, he hears the second baseman apologize and clamber off of him, holding out a hand to help him up. He ignores it for a few moments, basking in his own revelry of his genius before he eventually rolls onto his back and lets his opponent help him up. He scoops his hat off the ground and tosses it like a frisbee into the crowd for some lucky fans to fight over.
Steve and the rest of the team don’t have that much to do in the first couple of innings as far as defense goes. Tony’s pitches are aggressive, leaving absolutely no room for mistakes. The furthest one of their opponents runners can get is to second base before they’re either tagged out by Steve or their teammate at bat is struck out by Tony.
“Good. That smells delicious,” Steve comments, walking over and grabbing his plate off the tray so he can join Tony, standing on the opposite side of the counter. “Thor and I were planning on going on a run this morning. I think T’Challa and some of the other players might join us too. Do you want to come along?”
Tony drops the phone away from his ear, sloshing around the last bit of honey-colored drink left in the bottle. '
For the past two seasons we’ve had a lot of good players retire. We’ve been able to find a solid lineup of recruits that we think can keep the team alive, but we need the salaries to lock them into joining the Avengers over any other Triple-A team. And frankly, Tony, we think you’re getting bored.”
She blinks, gaze flickering between the two of them. She doesn’t look quite as dismayed as the two of them, her eyebrows raised in what seems like curiosity. “My parents… I come out to visit them in Boston during the break and they rent a house out here for a couple weeks. My dad and I like to do a little fishing together when I’m home,” she gestures over a ways to where there’s an older man tying a little fishing boat by the docks. He gives a friendly tip of the hat to them before going back to his business, Tony just noticing the tackle box tucked under one of Carol’s arms. She looks imploringly to Tony, an awkward smile on her face. “What are you doing out here?”
“Stark!” Natasha blows her whistle angrily from a few dozen yards away. “Get over here and get some warm-up pitches in, we got fifteen minutes.”
“Long term damage?” He does a remarkable job at keeping his voice even considering if his hands are done for, then he’s got nothing left. No more baseball, no more building, no piano, nothing.
Tony’s smile is brighter than the sun. His eyes are a burning amber, face flushed with exertion and hysteria. Tear tracks shine on his cheeks, the rest of his skin shining with sweat, hair pushed back and sticking out in wild waves finally freed from underneath his hat. His jersey is untucked and hanging open, pants stained with red dirt and grass. He’s beautiful. Chaotic and brazen energy thrumming around him like something tangible, unable to hide his brilliance even if he tried. He runs towards Steve, Steve meeting him half-way.
“Thank god you’re okay,” Steve breathed out, still holding his face. “The doctors said you woke up yesterday morning but I had just run out to get breakfast for Peggy and I—”
“Uh,” Steve has to flip the book closed to check the cover, having absolutely no idea what he had grabbed. “
"We did once. I turned down my spot on the Eagles to play in New Hampshire with Buck," Steve nods. "We always promised each other we'd be on the same team."
But he’s the captain. And he has to try. Tony’s not exactly avoiding him, but he seems to not drift too closely to any of the other players. The team must feel the same, none of them engaging Tony more than necessary. Apparently Steve isn’t the only one with reservations. It seems like the only player Tony is actually seen interacting with beyond a casual hello in passing is Rhodes. In most of their warm up games, Rhodes takes his position as second baseman, directly behind Tony on the mound. He was like an intimidating shadow to the pitcher when looking down the middle of the diamond.
Isaiah raises his voice again, holding his arm out to Peggy. "And of course, where would all of us be without Ms. Carter,
It’s clear that Steve isn’t the only one who is shocked by this. Almost everyone on the team is staring open-mouthed as Tony strolls towards them. "What's everyone standing around for?" he asks, shit-eating grin still in place.
It took several minutes for Tony to turn away from wiring the finer sensor and rotating mechanism of his robot’s claw, but nothing about the damn device made sense. When had 9PM become 8AM? Who the hell did he not know from Brooklyn (and why doesn’t he already know him or her)?
“Some eggs for us,” she said and handed Tony one of the plates of carved wood, then sat down two roasted turnips in a bucket for Clint. “And turnips for you. We were running out of turnips,” she explained, a little quieter, “we need to start eating different things, or we’ll soon run out.”
But when he calendar finally loaded, something was terribly wrong. There had to be a mistake. Tony reloaded the page, and again for a third time, until his shock slowly twisted into heartache.
“Absolutely,” Tony promised. He’d meant to say more, maybe boast a little about how that wasn’t all he could do given the right data, but his words caught in his throat when Steve’s lips turned up in a hesitant but hopeful smile. It was the first time in the past seven months that anything Tony had said or done made Steve smile.
“Just because it’s unexpected doesn’t mean I won’t enjoy it. I’ve never had Greek food,” Steve pointed out with a smile. “Order whatever you think I’ll like.”
A short silence hung between them until Tony sighed his surrender. He didn’t say a word, but Steve thanked him all the same, kissing the crown of his head and easing them back under the covers. He pulled Tony against his side again, and despite his earlier reluctance, Tony easily followed his lead now, pressing so close that he all but draped his full body over Steve.
“It works for you,” his mom reminded him with the patience only mothers seemed to know. “Relationships are bigger than one person, you know that. You’re not trying to find someone to fit your life: you’re building a new life, together.”
Graham brought out his guests one at a time - Rob Brydon, Miriam Margolyes, Tony Stark, and Channing Tatum. On the small screen of Steve’s laptop, the crowd’s cheers burgeoned with excitement as Channing Tatum came on the stage to wave, greet the couch, and take his seat.
Clark watched him with a knowing, sympathetic look. If anyone could understand what it felt like to watch your partner fawn and gush over someone else because of boundaries you created yourself, it was Steve’s dad.
Tony had less of a problem holding a plank, and while he waited for Colin to find a reasonably comfortable position, he entertained himself with straight knee leg lifts. “If a shot of this doesn’t make it on that website, I’ll be disappointed.”
Sharon was anything but impressed. “You made it my business, boss, remember?” she reminded him in a rather tired tone, then took a breath to steady herself and try again. “We’re not aiming for 9s and 10s. 9s and 10s can get anyone they want, they’re not going to be so spellbound they’ll fall in love with you and agree to marry you! But we can’t go too low either, or they’ll be too suspicious; you’re a decent 8, and you wouldn’t waste your time with a 3 or a 4.”
Tony smiled up at his brother as Steve thanked him, then he turned back to Steve. “So, what happened? What’s her name?”
“I said using the two other victims’ profiles on GayArrangement, we’ve got a total of fifty-two shared sugar daddy matches,” Tony said in a tone that made it clear he knew Steve had spaced out in the middle of their discussion. “I sent Barnes and Wilson the evidence of Thorne’s memberships with Seeking and Sudy in the given timeframe,” he added, referring to the first victim whose profile he’d found on GayArrangement. “The system is ready to append, but I think there’s enough overlap in what we already have to draft your profile to match the killer’s preferences. Did you and Romanov get any pictures for the site?”
“Whatever he is or isn’t, he deserves his privacy, dad. Tell him I’ll get Tony off his case,” Steve said with finality. “Not that I know how, but he doesn’t need to worry. I’ll think of something.”
“That’s him,” he whispered, jerking his chin in the direction of a blond Adonis who stood around a tall table with his friends, laughing and having a great time. God, even his smile was breath-taking.
“You sure about this?” Tony asked Steve one last time. Steve smiled and nodded in return, but even so, something wasn’t right. He was too tense, and his thoughts were somewhere far away. “Steve?”
When Tony still didn’t answer, Bruce leaned in with a serious expression. “Wanna tell me how that makes you feel, Tony?”
“My plate is full this week and this weekend,” Steve replied in a soft apology. “I have a presentation next Monday. Can I take you to dinner that night? Or, well. Uh. Any day next week.”
“If his flights match the pattern of disappearances and TODs, I’ll get you a list of places he’s been to,” Tony waved off Natasha’s perfectly reasonable point. “Let Steve ask him about the same destinations on their dates; any indication that he’s traveled to and from the city in your time frame, you’ll have enough to pull his travel records.”
“That reminds me,” Tony said after eighty thousand seconds (or something like that; Steve lost count around four), breaking eye-contact first. “I got some Italian sausages that could work as a filling, too.”
“I apologize for the inadequacy of your seat, Captain Steve,” he said sincerely. “Guidelines for officer body types, fitness levels, as well as socially desired aesthetic values have changed since your time. Moderation is impressed upon us in every aspect of our lives. There is no excuse, however, for your discomfort, and I assure you that I will requisition for a large conveyance within tick tocks of our arrival in NYPD headquarters.”
Tony had tried to be quiet, to tangle his hands into the bed sheets instead of clawing at Steve’s back, to bite down on the deep moans of satisfaction Steve’s wrung out of him, anything that might interrupt what Steve had planned for him, but it was so easy to forget that Steve read his body like it was his native language. With a knowing smirk and a mischievous wink, Steve pulled away for a third time, leaving Tony on the verge of release, almost sobbing in his frustration. Lube, lube, and more lube - Steve poured it all out over his fingers and rubbed it warm in one hand while Tony measured the pros and cons of trying to suck his own dick again.
What were the chances that Tony had gone camping with someone other than Channing? What were the chances that they didn’t enjoy romantic trysts in paradise under the starlit sky?
“The private stairway to his office is this way, there are no cameras there. And if you see security, push me into the wall and kiss me.”
In the absence of the comforter that absorbed his sounds, Tony tried to muffle the deep, needful moans spilling from his lips by gritting his teeth or biting his bottom lip. Steve paused mid-step when he first noticed, and bracing Tony’s weight with one arm, he freed his other hand to cup the back of Tony’s head, and turning Tony’s head closer so Steve could reach him for a kiss.
Jim must have been holding Tony’s phone, because most of it was of Tony - talking to Rhodey or talking to Steve between intermittent conversations with strangers in the marketplace.
“Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. I need a break,” Tony grumbled mostly to himself, then with a quick check-in with Bucky he threw down his headset and walked away. If he was going to deal with 007 again, he needed something a hell of a lot stronger than coffee.
Tony looked at the calendar in his phone. May 16, graduation. May 18, move back home. May 21, Orientation at R&D. Steve’s happy daydreams about what their summer together could be like washed over him, so clear and vivid, and yet so implausible. Tony didn’t catch any specific words Steve was saying, but he didn’t have to. He shared the same dreams. Taking breaks from the workshop to visit Steve at the office. Meeting the doctors and therapists on site, Steve’s bosses and his colleagues who would be part of introducing Steve to his future career in physical therapy.
“You have reached the secure mailbox information for Brock Rumlow,” the computer informed him, but Brock was five steps ahead of it. He had already pulled up the first of four digital messages in his inbox, and photos, maps, transportation networks, and pages of information scrolled across the screen in a blurr.
“Bank, groceries, home cooked food?” Tony countered with an impish excitement. Steve watched his excitement curiously; from all that he had seen in Tony’s studio, Steve wouldn’t have guessed Tony was particularly interested in cooking. His excitement could have been about anything from food play and fucking on the dining room table, to enjoying the freedom of cooking in a large, top of the line kitchen instead of his own outdated kitchenette.
Spellbound and in over his head, Steve swallowed, gasped, and whined at the same time. He undid his jeans one-handed so he could continue to read as he took his cock in hand. Beside him, Tony moaned softly under his breath, and before Steve knew what happened, it was Tony’s hand wrapped around his hard cock, and Tony’s hand jerking him off with slow, leisurely strokes. Just enough to drive Steve out of his mind.
“What, did I have to spell it out for you?” Steve replied with a broad grin. Maybe he should have been worried about his lack of transparency, but what was the point in lying to himself? He was downright pleased that the coincidences hadn’t gone over Tony’s head. “I told you I would be the best professional reference of your life.”
Armed with his key card, Steve shuffled into the elevator half asleep, and when the elevator stopped he grabbed his rolling bag and made to step out.
Steve kept his thoughts to himself and drank his water slowly. Tony sat on the bed with him at a respectful distance. His robe was barely tied on, and his hair swept around his head in a mess of curls Steve could never have imagined in this world of highly manicured and impeccably groomed people. It was a strange relief to learn that bedhead still existed in the future.
“They really do. Being a dad is important,” Tony promised him, carefully side-stepping the contrasting roles expected of animal dads and human dads. “And if you think they’re trying hard, you wouldn’t believe what insects do. They are the best, they do the craziest stuff,” Tony added with a little grin that turned even Harvey’s skepticism to curiosity.
“We will go public with a decision tomorrow,” Steve told him, trying to smile. “You’ll know who the new captain will be soon either way.”
“What would be the fucking point? Everything is illegal,” Steve muttered while the morality box charged him another five credits. “Wait, is sodomy illegal again?”
“Tony,” Steve raised his voice a little, trying to be heard over Tony’s spiraling self-doubt. “Tony, hey. Do you want to come over tonight?”
Steve chuckled under his breath, leaning back against the pillows piled up against the headboard to settle in as he found a comfortable rhythmic pattern.
Tony sat up straighter and eyed Steve while he washed his hands and started to clean up his counter space. “...Wait, is that all?”
At first he only slid his cock through the cleft of Tony’s ass, and releasing his grip of Tony’s full cheeks, Steve thrust his cock between them, taking the edge off his own need. But Tony, who so desperately wanted to be filled, to be fucked and used and only come on Steve’s long, thick cock, sobbed with need. He was so close to getting what he wanted, and yet Steve denied him what mattered most.
Tony strode in with the confidence of a man who knew exactly where he was going. Not that it was difficult to locate his target: he only needed to follow the shouting everyone else was ignoring. By some unspoken yet unanimous agreement, the whole precinct decided to turn a deaf ear to the four detectives shouting themselves hoarse in the conference room and leave them to their own devices.
One by one, Steve carried away his bags, coats, and even his shoes before joining him on the couch with an oversized fleece and flannel blanket to help bring Tony back to life.
slipped out.  “Come in—Marple, go in,” he told her so she wouldn’t run up behind him and trip him, but before he had to negotiate the minor step of his doorway, Mr. Perfect was there again, ducking under his arm to support Tony’s careful hop-steps.
Bruce blinked up at him then, and as if only realizing what had passed between them, stared across at his partner with palpable guilt. “My friend, I am sorry—I didn't mean—”
“So, we don’t have a dragon, but we have the Last Chief,” Tony summarized when they were all sitting in his cottage. The Last Chief went by the name Natasha, and even with Tony’s only two spare layers of clothes and bundled up in his bedquilt, she shuddered violently from the cold. Turns out, spending centuries as a cold-blooded reptile really messed with your mammalian temperature regulation. Tony brought her a cup of hot water, and Natasha closed her hands around the warm ceramic immediately, eager to absorb its warmth.
“Evacuate the chopper!” he bellowed at the pilot and gunman. They scrambled to obey, and Bucky hauled the door open so that Steve could climb back onboard with Tony. He circled the chopper and made sure all doors and windows were shut before establishing a loose perimeter to give them some privacy.
Steve grunted in question, but as he blinked his eyes open and took in more of the space around him, particularly under him, he realized Tony wasn’t joking. Steve’s arms were wrapped around Tony’s waist and legs, and in his sleep, he had settled his head on Tony’s gloriously firm and supple cheeks.
“The last time you were here, people barely knew your name,” Stephen started right in, “you were promoting
He waited for Steve’s eyes to find his, and without looking away, Tony lined them up and slowly, inch for inch, sunk down on Steve’s cock. He rocked forward with experimental curiosity, even rolled his hips around, drawing soft, keening moans from his stud.
Bucky frowned. Even if she’d gotten full custody in the divorce, Dunn would have been listed as the father if they were married. “Unless she didn’t want Dunn named as the father,” he said after a minute. “Wouldn’t hurt to reach out, right?”
“Ever the gentleman,” Tony said with a put-upon sigh, and when he passed Steve to join the short line of remaining first class passengers, he made a show of a haughty, exaggerated sniff. “Make sure your eyes stray, Sparky. Don’t let this show go to waste.”
. “If he is available tonight, I’ll see what happens, but if he isn’t, I’ll have to move on. Right? Cut my losses?”
“Come with me,” Steve whispered, taking Tony by the hand and leading him around the back. Any coordinated movement was challenging, and Tony couldn’t stop staring. The house wasn’t as simple as the facade made it out to be; the villa’s side stretched far ahead of them, and it wasn’t until they were all the way around that Tony realized the house had wings. The two lateral wings created a generous alcove which had been turned into a private garden with marble flooring and walls decorated with beautiful hand-painted tiles depicting whimsical landscapes and playful animals. The marble porch extended away from the house, creating a smooth walkway and a short series of steps that reached a deep, wide-set pool.
Steve caught Tony’s eye over his shoulder and winked at him before turning his full attention to giving Tony no less pleasure in return. He lapped up the come and lube spilling out of Tony’s ass, even trying to suck it out of him between teasing his furrowed rim. When Tony mustered enough motor control to reach back to spread his own ass for Steve, Steve could finally put his fingers to better use. He fucked two fingers into Tony, licking him out like a treat. Tony’s breath caught in his throat as it always did whenever Steve really leaned into eating him out, because there was nothing he’d shy away from - scooping the come out of Tony to eat him out, stretching his hole to its limit as he licked into him, sucking on his rim for minutes on end until it came away dark, red, and bruised with a terrible hickey.
Bond was due at Q-branch first thing in the morning, and Tony was tasked with taking everything from him except his gun and his watch. After quickly skimming through Sharon’s report of Bond’s meeting with H, he learned that while Vargas was a trafficking shit-head, he did not deal in explosives. Another lead brought him to London, which at least explained why Tony wasn’t to collect his gun. The rest of the meeting had been redacted and marked classified, even to Q-branch.
Breakfast was quiet the next morning. Tony had snuck off while Steve was getting dressed to have words with his dad, and whether Clint and Maria knew about the engagement rings was anyone’s guess.
“I don’t care,” Fury told her, and from Sharon’s left, Steve cleared his throat in a silent plea for immediate silence. “Make it legal, Rogers, and get Hill the paperwork so we can forget this ever happened.”
Tony chuckled quietly at his guess and shook his head. “You wouldn’t walk straight after thirty. It’s ten on a mechanical bull, eight live.”
Steve’s anger morphed into shock and more anger before Tony’s eyes. Still, he couldn’t help but stare. All at once he was reminded of how badly he’d missed Steve - missed how disheveled he could get when deep in a case; missed that special streak of (stubborn) defiance that fueled him through impossible cases no-one else believed in. It wasn’t Tony’s fault - Steve looked even sexier when he was pissed, with his clenching jaw and his biceps flexing in anticipation of a brawl.
“No reason,” Tony eventually said, because he really didn’t know what else to say. Instead, he turned back to Bruce. “Bruce, please. Help me get him: help me make him uncomfortable as hell. A man like that will hate to be told what he’s doing wrong in life.”
Armed with a pan and a ladle, Maria marched their way banging the pan full force. The blistering exchange of cursing and adrenaline-fueled laughter immediately turned into childish cries of complaint, and the boys separated like oil and vinegar with their hands over their ears.
“That’s for Belova,” he whispered with a quiet sniff. He couldn’t catch his breath, his whole chest burned, and now his eyes were burning, but he’d be damned if he’d cry over this lying bastard. “Can’t—can’t believe you were dicking someone else—and I gave you pointers,
The computer was silent for a few seconds before reporting back. “Permission confirmed, access granted, Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” it replied this time, then started its long description of Rumlow’s rehabilitation. “Rumlow, Brock. Rehabilitation skills: urban combatkill, torture methodology, computer override authorization, violent insurgence strategy…”
It took a moment for Tony’s words to register, but somewhere between realizing what he’d said and watching Tony’s awkward little limp, Steve stirred at once, entirely awake and mildly alarmed.
“And to me,” he added with an adoring smile. “I can’t wait to get to know her. After all, she’s the reason I have you in my life.”
It took Steve a moment to recall Tony’s earlier messages. “He says he wants to talk,” Steve said with a shrug, and he pulled out his phone to check. A new text from Tony had popped up on his lock screen since that morning.
It took hours, but sometime after 9am Steve finally got up and crossed the bullpen in the direction of the bathroom. Tony shot up from behind his desk and low-key ran over to plant himself in the spare chair beside Sam’s desk.
When Clint finally could blink the blinding light out of his eyes and his vision adjusted to the early light of dawn, it was no longer Stephanie, the beautiful, young blonde who was with him in his cell: in front of him stood instead was a tall, muscular blond man. He had Stephanie’s blue eyes, the same nose, and the same mouth, but where she had soft curves, he had firm angles and planes of muscle, and where she had been lithe and supple, his frame all but bulged with muscle honed either in the hunt, or in combat.
Chris beamed in his excitement over the story, then, more shyly, glanced at Steve. “How about your new favorite toy?”
So he was clearly mistaking Steve for another lawyer working with the firm. On one hand, Steve felt really good about his new wardrobe, and on the other hand… he didn’t want to disillusion the man.
For the US Men's National Soccer Team, qualifying for the 2022 World Cup was the easy part. They lost their Captain to a bad injury in a friendly against Uruguay, and now the best man to take on the armband is the only out player of the tournament. Tony is a sports journalist assigned to cover the US team through the tournament, but his first order of business in Qatar is stopping by Steve's room to clear the air.
Steve rolled his eyes, but he reached out to take Tony’s hand in his. He squeezed Tony’s hand and interrupted his anxious ramble.
“If you only knew,” Tony murmured dramatically between ravenous mouthfuls, “Bruce—I gotta carb up, I’m running on a deficit here! Captain fucking America—”
Steve chased Tony’s lips for more, so rather than waste time, Tony peeled one of Steve’s hands off his hips and guided it to his ass.
Tony pressed two fingers over Steve’s lips to quiet him. “Very flattering, but I have to say it’s hard to believe you thought you were immortal, but you never considered Thor?”
“Something isn’t right. This doesn’t fit the pattern,” Steve said once he started to process what was happening, keeping his voice low so only Bucky would hear. “This scene hasn’t been published yet.”
“Did you say your moms were here?” Steve asked. “Could you introduce me? It would be a pleasure to speak with them, too,” he explained when Taobe only stared back at him. Then, all at once, the boy couldn’t agree fast enough, and he urged Steve to follow him.
Steve sniffed to himself, but didn’t say anything as he opened up a new tab to look through the lacy bottoms. He scrolled through slowly, trying not to look as overwhelmed as he felt by all the different designs - so many of them looked the same! - and the variety of colors, but when he next glanced at Sharon, she was smiling down at her fingers.
“Do you hear it, Tony? You’re ass is so full of lube it’s coming out over my fingers, do you hear it? God, you’re so wet… how many fingers do you think I could fit in you if I tried?” Steve mused to himself in undertone, his voice no louder than the squelching wet sound of his fingers fucking Tony open for his cock. He felt the immediate twitch and tremor of excitement as Tony’s body squeezed around his fingers.
By dawn, Tony had strong-armed CCTV in a South African den of iniquity so 008 could move unseen into the AWB’s unsavory annual auction. He was waiting on the results of the facial recognition software to bounce through the CIA and Chinese intelligence when he Sam called his name.
“I think I can live with less than sterile floors,” Clint told him with a grin. He carried his mug of coffee around to the stove, and peeked in through the glass. “This all what smells so good?”
a serious person who could become a lawyer just like any old Vanderbilt or Kensington, then everything would fall into place.
“Without a warrant it’s inadmissible,” she replied, though between the satisfied smirk and calm tone made it clear she wasn’t warning Tony so much as asking him for a suggested loophole.
“That pretty much became the deciding factor,” Tony agreed, “it was either ‘Red, White, and Brew,’ or ‘I Miss Brew.’”
They ended up at the Green Gallows in the McKittrick Hotel, transported somewhere lush and inviting even at the heart of a concrete jungle. They ordered some of everything — the charcuterie and cheese plate, the grilled sweet corn and fried plantains, the moussaka and the steak skewers. Tony went for the sweet honeyed gin and Steve ordered a little something with tequila and grapefruit, though they ended up switching their drinks before they were happy with their choices.
She watched him cautiously and kept her hands in her lap. She wouldn’t stop staring. “Your Majesty, are you well? We all saw… we saw what happened,” she lowered her voice to say, clearly trying to be gentle about something so awful.
They were all bright young individuals with exciting interests and great passions, and Steve couldn’t wait for Brock to introduce him to this wonderful new world.
Steve forced the rest of the dildo into him, one bead after another, and despite the grip Steve had of his cock, Tony’s orgasm tore through him once Steve started fucking him in earnest in tandem with the beaded dildo.
Tony breathed him in deeply as he settled into Steve’s easy comfort. “You did not look confused. Where were you?”
“It won’t happen again,” Steve promised with a quiet growl, rolling his hips as he slowly built up to a controlled, shallow rhythm. He stretched out over Tony’s body, pinning him down and boxing him in between his thick, muscular arms. Tony still clutched his right thigh with his left hand, and as Steve flattened him into the mattress, Tony became powerless to move. He grasped the edge of the mattress with his free hand, but Steve took it in his, lacing their fingers together and holding on as he pounded into Tony with a desperate pace he could barely control.
He showered and brushed his teeth in silence, never wanting for anything. How Tony had gotten all of this arranged for Steve was really beginning to bother him, but then again, Steve couldn’t imagine any reason why Tony would want to speak with him again that night. He couldn’t even imagine any reason why Tony would receive him as a friend. The whole situation reminded him far too much of the laws against homosexuality and sodomy in the 30’s, and the more he thought about it, the more Steve kicked himself for expecting Tony to casually forget his deeply held beliefs because of one short and emotional conversation.
After her rejection, the crown prince returned to his country. Rumors of his wild escapades ended with a mysterious silence, until gradually, after nearly a year of diligent effort, Howard made himself known to the world again through his inventions and his rising power in military technology. As Europe advanced into the Second World War, cash poured into Machtberg from around the world. News spread of the crown prince reinvesting in the kingdom, advancing the infrastructure beyond their wealthier contemporaries, and after the passing of the old king, King Howard lifted restrictions on immigration for qualified educators, scientists, and medical care professionals. Given the rising threat of anti-Semitism and the Third Reich, a large number of Jewish families resettled in Machtberg. There, behind newly reinforced walls of the King’s own design and the natural protection of the mountain, they were finally safe.
“What would you like first, Tony?” Steve murmured against his ear, still squeezing and rolling Tony’s balls in his hand. “My cock, or work?”
An icy chill clawed its way through Tony’s body at the aborted warning. "He’s standing right behind me, isn’t he.”
The guards were getting closer to their corner of the office. Tony had no time to lose. It was now or never.
“He can thaw as many assholes as he likes?” Bucky asked incredulously, and as Tony looked around them again, he realized only Scraps were now standing. These tired, starving Scraps had somehow won. Tony’s scalp still ached from where his hair had been pulled, but it was worth it.
“Close your eyes, Tony,” Steve murmured then, his voice so soft and soothing against Tony’s ear that he nearly melted with it. Seconds later, Steve readjusted behind him so he could lay his hand over Tony’s eyes, a gentle, reassuring pressure that reminded Tony how nothing else mattered in this moment between them. It was so easy for Tony to close his eyes and lose himself in Steve. He forgot how to breathe as instead he mimicked the rise and fall of Steve’s chest; he forgot where he was since all that mattered was the way Steve’s panted his name like a prayer and whispered moans of praise into his hair.
Jane eyed him, and while she was clearly still skeptical, Tony could see that the idea had taken root. He smiled into his drink as he took another sip. Always trust a romantic to fall for genuine attempts at romance; in one impulsive sweep, Tony earned himself at least one month of peace before he and his ‘boyfriend’ parted amicably, at which point Jane would give him a week or two to grieve his loss —
“Give me a break!” Tony cried, more in surprise than in anger. “If that's how you feel, why do you make me feel like I’m an idiot half the time we're together?”
“Weather in California,” Tony mused, so lazy and content that he couldn’t quite find the energy to fully snark. “How bizarre.”
“Mom, no,” Tony muttered in a tired voice, grabbing her hand before Steve had to worry about what it might do to his person. “That’s harassment,” Steve heard him warn her in hushed tones.
“I built it myself, years ago. It’s not difficult,” Tony told her, growing more eager the more he spoke. “I could help you, or build you one; maybe somewhere near fresh water with a big clearing for your dragon? I don’t think I could build one for her, but maybe it would be big enough that she could see you inside it? We could build a hearth that she could fire, so you could cook anything you like, and keep warm all winter. Or, I mean,“ Tony stammered in the end, as he started to remember himself. “For you, and your bride, of course. I would build a cottage for you and your bride.”
Steve was sliding the bookmark into place and moving to get off the couch when Tony straddled his thighs and dropped into Steve’s lap. Steve’s arms came around him easily, and with a quiet laugh Steve nuzzled into Tony’s shoulder. “That bad?”
Tony moaned softly in reply, and he watched Steve run a kitchen towel under the faucet to clean Tony up. The water was lukewarm and comforting, and Tony sighed his contentment. It would only be better if Steve would go back to his gentle probing.
Steve bypassed his living room and made straight for the bathroom. Before he had any second thoughts, Steve turned on the taps and left the tub to fill with steaming hot water. He made a quick detour to the kitchen to warm up leftover pizza in the oven. All that was left was choosing a book. He was in the middle of a Stephen King classic, but after all this time with the Tony Stark, he had no interest in horror stories. He wanted romance, he wanted theatrical adventures to carry him away, if only for a few pages.
“I don’t care if it was good or unflattering, Stark: it was told in confidence. The world doesn’t need to know everything about me. You know how hard Fury and Coulson had to fight for them to even let me compete here?”
“...comforting,” Bruce muttered to himself, shot Tony a look that spoke volumes on the subject of living to fight another day, then very quickly turned tail to join the junior Avengers in the safety of the media room.
“Forget coffee in bed: you make the coffee now, that’s number one,” Steve started listing off his future crimes, and Tony was so upset and heartbroken that he dissolved into a fit of giggling again. “Two: I’m never shaving again.”
“I couldn’t sleep,” Steve admitted in a whisper, careful of his tone even though Patrick happily snored in his bed on his half of the room. “It feels so strange. In three months, I’ll be an adult. A real adult, with a job and bills and… I don’t really know what else adults do,” he finished lamely, shrugging to himself. “But I’ll have to figure it out.”
Steve’s nightmares had only been Tony’s first glimpse into PTSD. He had known of it in theory, of course, and respected the survivors who struggled with it every day, but he had never before seen how it consumed their peace and happiness. Steve had been safe and happy - there was no place safer than their palace, and the crowd at the Christmas market had been nothing but friendly and welcoming. Steve had been so pleased that he could carry on conversations with young Mächtingen, and he had enjoyed seconds and thirds of so much of the food. Maybe it was the cold that had stayed with him, or the obscured, dark faces of people in the night-time crowd, or the sheer number of people they saw. There was no way to know what had triggered him, and the thought of how many men and women of old Terrini still suffered from PTSD unseen weighed on Tony’s heart. He had learned what worked for his Steve, but the three million people who now recognized him as king needed their individual, attentive care.
They were covering the State v. Latimer in Hawley’s class, the last case before the dreaded midterm.
“It’s not what you think,” Tony said, his lips twisted into a wry frown. “When you walked away I couldn’t stop thinking that you’re wrapping up here in a week, and we move out to London in a month. Time’s going to fly after that, who knows how often I’ll see you with both of us working, and then… well. But I wasn’t worried about your reaction, Steve,” he promised, “I just didn’t want to waste any of this time being angry.”
Steve ignored it, much like he had been ignoring Bucky’s criticism of Tony since they saw him with the red headed woman. Instead, he shrugged out of his jacket, ordered another beer, and turned his attention to the game.
He dried off his hair quickly and ran to the bathroom to get a little mousse in it before it misbehaved—or worse, naturally curled over his forehead.
The nervous tension around Tony’s eyes eased as his incredulity gave way to tender admiration. Steve couldn’t help but reach for him, but swallowed down the impulse to lean in for a kiss. It had all moved so quickly and he wasn’t sure where they stood with boundaries of intimacy, but already he knew he would move heaven and hell to live in the adoring light of Tony’s affection. This was nothing like the passionate lust or determined possessiveness Steve had enjoyed in bed with men who openly said they loved him - men whose carnal interest took over the moment Steve made himself available. But Tony’s gaze was lost in love with Steve’s eyes and maybe something else—something more than his pecs and his lats and his glutes.
“Fun fact: the US embassy in London is the only embassy in a rented building. Apparently, the family who owns the building housing the US embassy owned a shitton of land in New York before the Revolutionary War. They later agreed to sell the US embassy back to the American government if their American properties were returned to them. So like, half of Times Square and big chunks of Manhattan. Obviously that’s a no, so instead they rent the space out for an annual charge of one pound.”
After so much time apart, the excitement of undressing Steve was on par with how badly Tony missed him, full stop. He didn’t want ‘newly unfamiliar’ anymore, he was tired of ‘reacquainting touches.’ Steve had been an extension of himself in the same way that Tony understood what he meant with the simplest look or gesture. He wanted his partner back.
“Then stop reading the ones Peggy sends to me,” Steve suggested half-heartedly and went back to his eggs. He needed six with four egg whites, and Tony needed seven with five. He wasn’t entirely sure whose he was working on anymore, or how many egg whites was in which bowl.
“Come on,” he said quietly, kneeling on the bed long enough to gather Tony up in his arms and lifting him up. This time he walked with confidence, because he knew exactly where he wanted to go.
“No, I’m driving,” Tony replied, and Steve could feel his hackles rising at yet another occasion where he was told rather than asked what to do. “Steve,” he continued, before Steve could think of the right words to say. “We’re not going to a big city, we’re going to a ranch in the middle of nowhere. It’s dark already, and there are a lot of unlit, unmarked dirt roads GPS doesn’t know about. You can drive when there’s sunlight,” he finished, gentling his tone as he did.
To know how he, too, overwhelmed Steve, and how hard Steve was struggling to keep himself steady, to make this perfect for them, all of it made Tony melt back into the cradle of Steve’s body. He reached back to grab a fistful of his hair; this time, he wouldn’t let Steve hide his emotions and his desire in private little moments against his pillow or Tony’s neck. With a firm tug of Steve’s hair, Tony demanded his attention, and he twisted just so to slot his mouth over Steve’s, pouring his heart, his joy, his ecstacy into the kiss.
Steve blinked at the unexpected response to his excitement about a rhinoceros gargoyle. Luckily, he was smarter than people gave him credit for.
the inspiration for an important part of the story, but I wanted it to be a surprise. It is literally the highest concentration of antique books and prints and artwork on a single street in the country. Maybe the world? I don’t know. I thought you’d… you know, like that, old maps and illustrations.”
“I, well,” Tony stammered for a moment. “I, I wanted to tell you in person? I—is now a good time? I can pick you up.”
Steve had been on course for the bomb planted on the Millenium Bridge. He reached the bridge only in time to fire warning shots into the sky, shouting for people to run for solid ground when around him the world ceased to exist. A white light consumed him and all the sounds and sensations of life.
Nights quickly became rotten without Tony. Steve couldn’t compare tossing and turning to his trauma from the war, but stewing in his fears of Tony neglecting his own health and overextending himself left Steve feeling more restless and exhausted with every passing day. Still, he wouldn’t consider the option of ending his assignment early to go home. Every added investor in Tony’s latest product lowered the cost of public services in Consone, so every time Coulson offered to new meetings or negotiations, Steve agreed.
“You realize most people can’t stand up to him with, like, an entourage of lawyers, right?” Tony murmured with pride as he leisurely brushed his fingers through Steve’s soft, blond hair. “You amaze me, Steve. I don’t tell you often enough.”
Steve couldn’t believe his eyes. “You should visit more often,” he said to Tony under his breath. “This is a miracle.”
How nice of Benedita, taking Tony’s boyfriend somewhere secluded, beautiful, and tremendously romantic. Kind, generous Benedita, who was two years younger than Tony and had flawless skin and a smile to light up a room and spoke a gazillion languages (probably) and who, at this point, had enjoyed as much of Steve’s free time since they moved to Portugal as Tony.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are only in attendance for this managerial meeting because it serves our purposes,” the Director reminded him coolly. “I suggest you maintain your silence until such time you are asked to speak. Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark, this is an official warning: control your ward.”
With bated breath, Tony scrolled through the countless photos of vivid colors splattered across the wall of a government building. The meticulous timestamps showed how, for eight whole seconds, the devastating words
“You know,” he said, “I was afraid nobody would show up. Seamus always looks a little glum when that happens, you’re really going to make his day. He likes being pet, too, if you like, but he’s happy just listening to you reading for him if you prefer that. What book did you bring to share with him?” he asked then, clearly eyeing the book Tony had grabbed out of the display earlier.
“I will explain when we are not in public, Jane Foster,” Tony whispered, then turned back to Steve to say, “were the three seashells not available?”
He was trying to remember his French conjugations when his face was pressed forward into the cushions and his hips pulled up until he was bracing his weight on his shoulders and kneeling on the edge of the platform. Stone cold paws pushed at his hips and shoved his legs apart until his cock and balls hung between his spread thighs, vulnerable in every way. Tony struggled against the heavy weight on his shoulders to twist around and see what was happening, but he could only catch a quick, nauseating glimpse to confirm that one of the other masters was salivating down the crack of his ass, slurping at his hole with its blunt teeth, slimy lips, and long, serpentine tongue.
“Christ,” Tony muttered, smoothing his hand gently up the length of Steve’s thigh. “You are something else… fuck, alright, hold on, what was I saying?” he muttered to himself, kneeling up on the bed finally to join Steve.
Steve wetted his lips again, eyeing Tony with no less interest than Tony felt with every buzzing nerve in his body. “What if it’s not the same?”
“We reside on the 54th floor, Steve Rogers,” Tony told him then, a little too matter of factly for Steve’s conscience. “I have procured you a domicile down the corridor from my own. I have also coded your palm print as a double of my own: what you wish to purchase, you may, wherever you wish to go, you may to the extent that a silver class adult may.”
At the intersection of Madison and 57th, Brock slid out of Cho’s car and wandered to the nearest CompuKiosk, whistling and pleased as punch. All around him, people stopped and stared at the fitted jeans and skin-tight muscle shirt he wore that clearly advertised the strength and size of his body to anyone who looked.
“I’m an editor,” he said, before stepping in a little closer to add, “and if you like pork, the Godfather is really good.”
,” he added with a sudden serious gravity, and he blinked his big, innocent eyes at Steve. “If I had to, my money’s on mom.”
Bucky dropped the subject in favor of clicking on Netflix and enjoying his sugar bomb in peace. Steve, however, couldn’t stop thinking about it.
“Fuck me, if that’s what I’m here for,” he whispered, and watched, spellbound, as Steve’s pupils dilated until his eyes were unrecognizably black, and he could feel Steve’s profuse precum dripping over his own cock trapped in Steve’s fist, and down over his abdomen.
Soon his only lucid thought was a desperate hope that he’d at least told Tony he loved him before all this. They’d been so close to a second chance, so close to making up for all the time they lost being bullheaded. What Steve wouldn’t give to look Tony in the eyes again and admit how wrong he had been to let him go, for being so unsupportive.
“They only dug up three posts, we just got unlucky with where they hit the fence. There’s only two good posts between the damage and the watering hole, so we gotta replace them, too.”
Steve smiled down at the cooking eggs as Tony continued reading and resumed his quiet humming - something he probably didn’t notice he did, but that Steve coveted deeply in these quiet moments they shared.
Tony spun on his heel and dashed back to his room. There was no way he’d fall asleep again, but if he was lucky, he’d be able to squeeze a workout in before six. He wasn’t going to give Steve a single excuse to consider another man, not on his watch.
“That means a lot to me, Tony. I really never thought I’d hear that, from anyone, and every time I hear it again, it somehow means even more,” Steve admitted, offering Tony the cup finally and doing his best not to let Tony escape the conversation in his obvious embarrassment. “So, yeah. For a long time, I blamed you, but it’s… I wouldn’t change what happened now, even if I could. In whatever backwards way, I have you to thank for this. You had no right, but you did it elegantly and kindly. Nobody could have done it better. So, I guess… thank you.”
“Now I am,” Brock admitted, leaning back against the counter so he could look his fill of Steve in his couture leather armor and beckoning him closer. Steve eagerly followed his lead, standing between Brock’s knees until they were so close they could speak in whispers.
Steve willed his hands warmer and reached between Tony’s legs to lubricate his palms with the copious precome gushing from the head of Tony’s cock. He steadily worked his way up to Tony’s ass, kneading with enough pressure that Tony quickly lost himself to the wet, hot slide of Steve's hands, and the gentle, soothing massage.
Steve knew he could have kept his mouth shut, but something was bugging him about the earlier statement Hawley made. There had to be a difference between the rights given to a one-time donor versus a man who clearly used the practice as a source of pocket money. He raised his hand just as one of the lecture doors opened and his redheaded friend stepped in to wait in the sidelines.
There was a targeting system he’d been working on that would do the trick, and if Bucky could fumble his way through failing to ask 004 out on a date long enough, he’d have the docking added in no time.
Steve eyed the box and decided to take his word for it. He tore into the box and pulled one of the unhealthy indulgences free. The sweet, flaky coconut shavings and the smooth, gooey marshmallow layer over a cream-filled chocolate cake tasted like a dream. For every bite he was taken back to long-forgotten childhood victories of eating endless candy in front of Saturday morning cartoons, a time where a strict diet wasn’t part of his life and Captain Crunch counted as a nutritious breakfast.
“It won’t be. It can’t be,” Tony conceded quietly, instinctively curling his fingers into Steve’s soft shirt in case he tried to pull away. When Steve didn’t try to distance himself, Tony dared to glance up from his tempting lips to hold his gaze as he slowly drew him closer.
Steve rattled off some words to calm Tony and make up for his obvious slight, but Tony didn’t listen or even care to listen. He clambered over Steve to get out of the car, and with unsteady feet he stomped his way towards the indicated doors.
It hadn’t been a month since that otherwise insignificant night when Tony had ventured downtown and met Steve. He was catching up with Rhodey after an Air Force ROTC event celebrating the start of the school year, but somewhere between the event and Tony’s arrival, Rhodey had run into Carol and some of her friends. Carol was in the Air Force ROTC at BU, and even though she was currently dealing with a shoulder injury, she was part of the BU swimming and diving team, too.
Tony had been so distracted dreaming about inviting himself to Steve’s jacuzzi that Steve’s non-sequitur question surprised him.
“So, what you’re saying is that your investigation is in a lot of trouble,” Tony replied with an unimpressed huff, looking both shaken and newly irritated. “I’ve been in Vancouver for the past five weeks, I just got into town this morning. If I’m the best you’ve got right now—”
” Tony hissed in disbelief. All at once, he tossed his office keys and his computer bag on his desk and rushed over to hug him, delirious with relief, but Steve got a hand between them just in time.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat at the same time as his pulse pounded in his ears. His mouth ran dry as he vividly remembered lying alone in his big bed in Vancouver, listening to Tony’s distant voice recalling the joyful romance he was enjoying with another man. A man much braver than Steve, a man who deserved Tony’s affection.
There weren’t so many people there, but all of them were taking their time, chatting leisurely amongst themselves and ambling in the general direction of Taco Bell’s imposing entrance. Part of Steve wanted to shout at them - what self-respecting New Yorker walked this slowly? He had almost reached Mina and her clipboard when a friendly, familiar voice addressed him from a near distance.
So he would be the first of the pets exposed. The girls didn’t look away as Steve guided Tony out from under his arm to face the other masters. Without a word of warning, Steve undid the toggles down the back of Tony’s robe, Tony’s only item of clothing, and stripped him where he stood.
As if he had no doubt all that military money couldn't tempt Tony to continue the same destructive path. As if there was something inherent about Tony that couldn’t be bought.
“No wedding band,” Bruce observed just as Tony threw back the last of his scotch to go do something about it. Thor and Bruce watched from afar as Tony walked around the bar in a rather unhurried approach, pausing near the group long enough to gauge a natural break in their conversation to slide in.
“Lord, spare me the fucking cavities,” Clint muttered. “But, he’s right. Steve, guests don’t do our chores. You any good in the kitchen?”
“What? No!” Tony all but shouted at him, though it wasn’t shocking enough to get Steve to release the elevator doors. “Don’t fire your assistant, she’s not the fucking problem!
“Tony,” he finally managed, genuinely at a loss for what to say. “Sweetheart, nobody gave me this ring. I bought it myself. You have no-one to worry about, I swear to you.”
Despite the obvious interest pressing against Tony’s inner thigh and the blush coloring Steve’s cheeks, Steve still had the gall to smirk up at Tony like he held all the cards. “Oh, wow… you’ll let me play with your treasure chest?”
Steve’s smile faded momentarily as he watched Tony’s face in thought. He reached for Tony’s t-shirt with two fingers and gave it a playful little tug. “Then, would you like me to show you what a real dream feels like?”
“There’s a Zara right down the road,” Sharon answered without even acknowledging his childishness. “We can just pick something reasonable up—”
Detectives were still working to clear the apartment and make sure there were no hidden cubby holes when the radio crackled to life and one of their colleagues from the 62nd called it in.
“Don’t underestimate him, he’s got a clever disguise,” Clark said with a wry quirk of his lips. “I just never understood how he kept up with being Bruce.”
“We were thinking of you today, I wanted to say hello,” she explained absently, moderately distracted by the lives playing out in the apartment windows across from them. Eventually she grew disinterested and joined Tony on the couches where an opened bottle already waited for her.
“Hey! You’re from Tennessee? I’m from Oklahoma—I’m Tony,” he said with an easy smile, and he held up his pouch of tempura sweet potato fries. “Nice to meet you.”
Steve couldn’t see the list from his place at the back of the crowd, but some sour anonymous soul who was leaving disappointed frowned at him as they passed and said, “Competition must’ve been easy this year.”
“I didn’t ask you to tease me,” Steve complained hoarsely, but when Tony again pushed at his shoulders, Steve obliged him, obediently easing down on his back.
Steve jumped out of skin with a squeal of terror and slammed his laptop shut as if he’d been caught staring at porn in class. He had forgotten he wasn’t alone in his room.
“I don’t care how expensive they are,” Tony whispered in his unrecognizably older, darker, and deeper voice. “Anyone harrasses you like that, or touches you, you can always push back. I don’t care how deep their pockets are, or how vicious their lawyers are. Mine are deeper, and mine are the best.”
“Your Majesty,” the chopper pilot said a few minutes into their journey, speaking at a comfortable volume thanks to the Starktech noise insulation of their headsets. “The attack targeted the adjoining library and police station in Lumine. Ninety-two injured and fifty-seven fatalities, including one pilot. General Ira Arionne has personally relayed messages ahead of us to inform His Majesty, King Anthony, of Your Majesty’s arrival. All he has been able to share with me is that His Majesty, King Anthony, and the Iron Legion are currently serving as part of the relief and are unavailable for comment. Edelfrau Potts has been reached and awaits Your Majesty at camp.”
Steve was still laughing too hard to breathe when an excited group of ten-year-olds ran into the classroom and loudly cheered, “Mr. Tony!”
“Ever since she walked twenty-three miles in the rain to bring Celeste home after a bad storm last winter,” he said without hesitation. “Just… I just haven’t found the right ring, or the right time to ask. Don’t want it to be just another day.”
Professor Hawley welcomed her and introduced them, explaining that Natasha would be the lead counsel for the scheduled hearing and that the interns were there to help get through the case as quickly as possible. As she shared the details of her earlier conversation with Stark, it became clear that settling was not on the table; Stark hadn’t budged on the offer of five million dollars, but Hawley was convinced Mrs. Hansen’s case was too good for that.
Anonymous students passed Steve in a blur where he had suddenly become rooted to the asphalt. He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t move, he couldn’t even breathe. All Steve could do in those precious seconds was to listen to Tony’s stumbling silence as he fumbled for a natural way to save himself.
After his presentation, Steve had been introduced to countless people whose faces and political histories he’d only before seen in textbooks. It was overwhelming, but not for the reasons he had anticipated. Language, it turned out, was the least of his worries. Everyone wanted to speak with him, everyone wanted to hear more about Consone’s proposal for affordable sustainable agriculture and advanced irrigation systems, and if one more person requested a face to face, Steve was going to lose his mind.
Tony scoffed and turned to Steve for back-up, but ever the strategist, Steve had furtively started a quiet conversation with Laura and was not available for throwing himself in front of the freight train that was life-long family arguments.
“The only seats left are at minimum $178,” she said after a brief search. “Corner of the rink near the Ranger’s net.”
), as if they’d arrived at a funeral procession instead of an exceptional place of learning and growth. How hard had every one of these people worked to come in here and sit with their sombre faces and tired eyes?
One way or another, he was going to die. It wasn’t the tragedy Tony seemed to think; after all, Steve wouldn’t have enlisted back in the 20th if he didn’t think dying was a risk worth taking. Any battle could be his last, or any ambush—and who was to say one of Tony’s workshop mishaps wouldn’t blow the Tower into the sky some day?
“Natasha got his last address, but she also noticed that someone else registered at that address more recently,” Bucky said and held up his trusty notepad. “Feel like a trip to the Bronx?”
Steve gave him a look, then picked up the two mostly-melted ice bags and put them in a bowl on the side table. “A light rub-down wouldn’t hurt. Since you insist.”
As one, the pint-sized stampede took off, each pair of little feet running to their designated seats. With minimal groaning and complaining, the students dug out their workbooks and their pencils, eager to show just how well-behaved they could all be.
He made up for the bloodbath, the daywalker, and all the vampires turned to ash with two beers and three shots. Turning a movie into a drinking game wasn’t the smartest plan he’d made since college, but it had been a long week, and none of them felt much like being smart.
The discrepancy in their schedules meant that when Steve sat up in bed on Monday morning to shut off his 5:30 alarm, the first thing he saw was Tony huddling further into the bedsheets. It wasn't even that Tony was particularly provocative in the morning; he was sluggish, he was difficult to wake, and he cocooned himself so fervently in the sheets that there was nothing visible left to tempt Steve but his wild bedhead.
That night, Tony was too shaken to even look at his liquor cabinet. He called Pepper first and told her all about what had happened. He called Happy to be sure he could escort Pepper to and from the 88th Precinct the next day.
The ring shone like new even after all these years. Tony turned it this way and, catching something on the inside of the band, he held it closer to read the inscription.
“This is insane,” Tony was still saying since they first received the steak sandwich. Steve died a little on the inside every time Tony used the word incorrectly. “How is anyone going to eat all that meat?”
It looked like the blood vessels on Fury’s head were going to burst at any second, and he snapped with a sudden flash of rage. “Your assigned steward is Lieutenant Robert B. Banner!”
With a sudden flash of rage, Bruce glared across the office at his partner. “What do you know about it? You are not the one incapable of providing your partner with healthy children.”
But Steve knew all too well that a man without a real, meaningful place in time had nothing. No past, no present, and certainly no future. Who would want to share his future? People dreamed of finding someone to love and support to the very end, and Steve had no end to give. He didn’t look a day over twenty, and whoever loved him would be doomed to live for years beside a constant reminder of the youth passing them by.
Tony’s fears and resistance were forgotten. He melted against Steve’s chest, draping one arm over Steve’s shoulders and groping at Steve’s chest over his suit. Steve spared his hands only long enough to heft Tony’s weight against his own body, encouraging him to wrap his legs around Steve’s waist. Tony purred softly into the kiss, and not once did he seem to notice how Steve’s hands left his body, or how ever so carefully, Steve dug his fingers into the wall behind Tony to literally carve handholds into the wall and lift their joined bodies towards the ceiling where nobody would expect them.
Steve blinked at him wildly, trying to make sense of what had just happened. To have anyone accuse him of misunderstanding the English language was the last thing he had expected. “I—what?”
. My mom couldn’t move to Mexico with me at the time, and I don’t think she would have let me go if Alma hadn’t promised to keep an eye on me. Even after the show she helped put me in touch with the right people, and she’d insist that I joined their family for dinner every week to check in. She’s family, my second mom.”
“So they warned me against California real estate since the housing bubble is on the verge of collapse,” Steve continued, ignoring Tony’s very sensible question and noticeably redder than before, “but I couldn’t stop thinking that a marriage proposal isn’t just to say how much I love and appreciate you: it’s my chance to show you how incredible I think our future will be together. And, I could be wrong,” he finished wryly, “but I thought that was better expressed with a sixteenth century palace, eight guest houses, forty-nine bedrooms, and a pool than a sapphire ring.”
“Steven.” Bucky whispered in warning directly in his ear just as Anthony turned to look at him with the most pleading eyes Steven had yet to witness.
Unable to stop himself, Steve elaborated further, "We finally had an honest talk and we agreed that we are in a committed relationship from now on." Tony's elbow digging into his ribs was well deserved and Steve endured it.
It's been a few years! Sorry about that! I did tell you that I posted the first chapter and the beginning of the second one as a one-shot because I don't like posting things that I haven't finished and this is a HUGE project.
Well, thank you so much for reading this! I'm so happy you took the time. I hope it doesn't take me a long time to finish this (for real this time) soon. Grammar and vocabulary corrections are welcome! Please help out a non-native speaker!
“And I did. But every time I realized that none of your supposed conquests would get below your belt,” Steve continued while massaging said place. When Tony closed his eyes and started to get lost in the contact, Steve dipped his head further into Tony’s space so he could whisper directly in his ear, “At first I was so angry at you for letting other people touch you, but then, I realized that this was part of your denial and that you were becoming more faithful to me over the time; the hickeys were more and more my own, and rarely you went out to drink without me. It wasn’t that long until
bullshit!” Tony denied fiercely, yet he was still avoiding eye contact. “How can you be so full of yourself? How can you fucking try to put those words in my mouth, Rogers?! That’s it for humble Captain America for you!”
What made Steve finally glare right back was the way that Rhodes refused to let Tony go when his lover declared that it was too much hugging for a lifetime and that he needed to breathe.
Late but here! Thank you a lot fot the patience. I didn't have as much kudos as I wanted, since I'm still in the 200's, so I guess it means that I kept my promise of when to upload this chapter? No? I know, sorry about the lateness. It is just too hard to find time to do some writing. So, I really hope you enjoy, kudo and/or comment on this story. It will be greatly appreciated (it needs more love). Thank you for the support!
“It would be lovely if we could all go riding through the castle grounds.” He replayed finally. “Unfortunately, it seems we have a large amount of issues we must attend to, so the queen and myself won’t be able to accompany you.” At Anthony’s crestfallen expression, the Crown Prince continued to speak “But I find it improper and dangerous enough for the two of you to wander alone, so I ask of Lord Obadiah to accompany you, Anthony, have fun and be back within the hour.”
Captain?” he said over pronouncing the last word with fake sweetness while battering his eyelashes in a poor attempt to imitate Anthony, wanting to make fun of Anthony’s nickname and the one given to him by his beloved.
Tony seemed to think about that and a smirk took over his pensive frown, “Who was it that broke my favourite coffee machine three months ago?”
“Or what?”, Bates challenged him without giving anything away, “Look around you, Captain. It seems that you exceeded my expectations and managed to turn my own trap into your ambush in no time, so it seems that I’ve lost. However, I can see that the criminal life has taken a toll on you, and you came here with the clear intention to kill. Just like the Winter Soldier, over there; a synthetic assassin, how nice.”
“Please,” Tony begged with a cracked and pitiful voice, something Steve hadn’t ever thought possible of Tony outside a particularly intense love-making session, “My god, Steve, please, I’d do anything, don’t ask that. Please. Why are you making this so difficult?” He asked while clenching his eyes shut, “You can even ask me about my father or Afghanistan, but
of a third wheel than he felt right now. Probably even jealous. Which he wasn’t. Really. “I’m here for you as well, Rhodey; my need to annoy you sustains my sanity, even if I suck at showing it,” Tony murmured,
I made this at first with the intention of it being part of my series, but you know how this is. I am thinking about making a short epilogue, but let's see.
inside his head, knew that Rogers wanted what was best for Tony, he really did, but mistakes were going to be made by both sides and Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes will be there to make sure that the super soldier was properly harassed each time so that he would never take Tony for granted.
“I don’t need to, I value my sanity and I have Pepper to reassure me that you have indeed done something stupid every day without submitting myself to your bullshit.”
“Steve!” he yelled while trying to go even faster; trying to defy all the laws of science he had gathered after his numerous experiments. However, before a miracle could happen, the wolves responded first at the rise of his voice with a chorus of barking, making it impossible for Anthony to hear if someone had heard his scream. “
“Tony, what did you tell Rhodes about me for him to dislike me so much?” Steve really wanted to know what had warranted such hostility towards him. At Tony’s guilty expression, Steve decided to reassure him before his lover had time to turn his obvious thoughts of ‘Danger! I gotta go!’ into action. “Not that I blame you, Tony, you know I don’t; I just want to know before I face him again.”
Anthony searched for Steven’s eyes and this time, the aristocrat didn’t try to break the eye contact between them. Steven could read the apology all over his face, the resignation.
No further conversation could be said after those weird, romantic moments between them when they bared their hearts out and just made the other aware with simple, but at the same time complicated, words what they meant for each other. They left behind the sarcasm and playful banter and they just made sure that the other was as happy as they were feeling.
"Rogers." he answered back, but instead of a nod, the colonel cocked his now loaded and shiny sniper rifle again.
Just like that, the Lord rode to catch up with the other two horses. Steven threw one last glance at Anthony while he disappeared from his view between the arms of another alpha. His worst nightmare happening in front of his eyes.
The darkness seemed to also take place in his battle style; he wasn’t even pretending that he wasn’t fighting to kill, giving each punch and throwing the full force that the serum provided him with.
“It will,” she assured him letting her hand drop from his shoulder and putting it on her waist, “this way he will answer truthfully to any question that will be asked to him. It will be nearly impossible for him not to say what he’s thinking out loud, though.”
Now Steve had to ask Tony for a new phone. It had been a while since he had felt so damn frustrated and now the poor technological thing laid spread out all over the floor where it’d crashed loudly. And he was just starting to get a grip on the texting and on the saving contacts with their pictures. The idea of struggling with a new, unknown phone just made him, if possible, more irritated.
“Well, if he’s such an asshole you should fucking ditch him and go find someone more suiting to your perfection!” Tony said in obvious frustration, yelling the last words. And now he was back to that nonsense. Sometimes Steve just wanted to punch some sense into him. Or simply just punch him. That was probably why he walked to the opposite wall from where Tony was yelling at him; he didn’t want to do something he would surely regret. “Believe me; he’s not worth the trouble, so why don’t you just leave him the hell alone!”
“Steve…” Tony whispered breathlessly as if in a trance, looking at him as if he had hung the stars in the sky while they were kissing. His lips were red with their kissing, even redder than when all their discussion started. It took all of Steve’s will not to start kissing him again, or just plain throw him over his shoulder, take him to his room and continue what they started moments before their argument broke up.
"Not for lack of your begging, of course." Rhodey threw back without any force. With Tony as he was, it wouldn't be fair to push some battering. “Perhaps the water would help you cool your head before your phone call, man.” He suggested when the genius seemed to be about to answear back. Maybe a shower and a miracle after, and Tony would get his head out of his ass long enough to notice that Rogers could act like a real jerk, too. “Besides, Pepper will kill you if you show up smelling like that.”
were just the top three characteristics that came to the top of Steve’s head to describe Tony’s friends. Not to mention incredibly overprotective.
I decided to keep editing as soon as possible so I can publish the next chapter within the next few days. That or maybe I'll publish the next chapter as it is as soon as I get around 50 kudos or something. Whatever comes first! Thanks for reading, my dears!
To the Captain, it was clear that Rhodes was a military man, and therefore likely appreciated practicality and a straight-to-the-point attitude in his his interactions with others. It was an attitude Steve understood and was familiar with, from his time during the War, and so he should have felt at ease around the Colonel. However, Steve was distinctly uncomfortable around Rhodes, though. The discomfort that he felt around the man was obviously due to the Colonel making a conscious effort to make the supersoldier feel about two centimeters tall. Every time Steve opened his mouth in an attempt at small talk, to get to know his boyfriend's best friend better, the man in question merely gave him an undecipherable look, and Steve's words would fail him.
The Lieutenant Colonel tried to resume his reading of the newspaper when not even three minutes later, there was a quick knock at the door.
He really should start to call Tony’s friends more often if this was the response he was likely to get.
“What do you care how I smell, you jerk?” Tony asked as if offended, “it’s not like I sleep with you or anything.”
“You haven’t been up there for a while now and I thought you could be hungry,” he explained simply, lifting the try so it could grab Tony’s attention to what's over it.
“Yeah, about that, I want to know why it means that much to you. You feel good when someone attempts against your ego or something?”
“So this is what this is all about to you? You’re pulling the ‘an eye for an eye’ game here? This isn’t a game, Rhodes, this is about Tony and-”
In the other hand, Tony was used to play his part for the whole world to see and didn't care much about the theatrics he had to pull in a social convention. Not that Steve cared much about what unkown people thought of him, hence wanting to come out to the world, but Steve knew that Tony’s real 'whole world’ was a little restricted; there was his friends, Jarvis, his creations –which included JARVIS, the bots and SI–, the Avengers and himself.
Tony could breathe again. This experience could leave the genius with significant heart and brain damage.
"We are still here, aren't we?" Steve replied easily. At the genius' hesitant expression, the supersoldier continued to reassure, “We will be fine no matter what, Tony,” Steve assured him with all the faith he could muster in his voice. The Avengers were strong and had been through enough ordeals together to be able to fight for their family, no matter the adversity, "We are not earth mightiest heroes for nothing. We must be proud that you and I are a huge part of that accomplishment. And we did it
“Come on, Tony,” Jessica Drew and Jessica Jones came to drag the genius up the stairs with Natasha leading the way. “Let’s prevent the weirdoes to get drunk before ten in the morning and give Steve some privacy to make himself presentable before he passes out or becomes red permanently.”
Tony shifted in Steve’s lap, trying to find the right words to say. Nothing felt right; they hadn’t been together for Tony to have evidence, so any promise would consist of hollow words. What Tony
To Tony’s delight, Steve recovered from his surprise first. “You do have incredible skies here,” he agreed. “Everything is so clear.”
Brock shrugged and scoffed at the absolute insanity of his request. “I’m touched. There’s six of you, and so nicely dressed, but… you know, I just don’t feel like it,” he replied with an exaggerated smile.
Tony laughed easily, but Steve nodded again as if that was exactly his preferred method of deciding on a game prize. “Fair enough, let’s do this.”
Steve glanced at Tony and wondered if he should break the news that palm scanning was a thing ‘back in the 21st.’ But rather than disillusioning Tony’s romantic view of the archaic 21st, Steve took his gloves off and gently pressed his open palm to the scanner.
Pepper snorts, clearly not believing him either. “Is that what he told you? Because, trust me, that boy is absolutely
“To be honest, a little overwhelming,” Steve chuckles. “I honestly never really thought I had what it takes to be captain of a team, but the Avengers have been like family to me the past few seasons. I’m honored to take on the role.”
Hammer pitches exactly as expected, breakaways and changeups rather than any kind of fastball pitch that he doesn’t have the skill or confidence for. Waynes plays smart and earns himself a double, but gets tagged out after Nancy hits a ground ball right within the shortstop’s reach.
When the next morning rolls around, most of the team gathers in the lobby to go do various activities around the city before their game in the late afternoon. Tony's absence doesn't go unnoticed by Steve and when the man asks Rhodey where his suitemate is, Rhodey just says he wasn't feeling well enough to come along on the excursion. Steve knows better; He's being avoided at all costs.
There’s no sound of the shower going down the hall from Steve returning from his morning run. The old house is quiet save for the slight creaking of wood as Tony grips the railing and makes his way down the mahogany stairs of doom, missing the very horizontal layout of his old apartment more and more every day. Checking the oversized clock on the wall in his living room, he’s got maybe five minutes before the tornado comes blowing through his home.
She nods and darts off to fetch him a refill. Steve gives his hand a squeeze, not making any further comment.
“Your name sure does go far,” Steve tells him about an hour later after finding him along the crowded bar.
Steve looks around the apartment as leaves his shoes by the door and follows Tony into the den. There are no decorations up, no indication that it’s the holiday season at all. Tony’s apartment feels dark and cold until they reach the living space where there is a warm glow provided by the fireplace, as well as some lights turned on behind the bar.
“How’s practice going?” Bucky asks one day when Steve brings him lunch, giving him a break from the bland hospital pudding and applesauce that are remarkably and concerningly close in texture and taste.
Tony nods. “Of course. I know I don’t deserve that kind of forgiveness from you, but… You always did give me better than I deserved. I loved that about you.”
Tony’s glaring sourly at him, but there’s a humorous twitch at the corner of his mouth. He’s fighting a smile. “Not sayin’ it again. Don’t want you to get used to hearing it.”
Tony had bitterly spat at him one night when he had congratulated him on one year sober with a casual gathering of their friends. To him, the milestones aren’t worth celebrating, but he’s gotten less sensitive about it these past couple of years, Steve learning in tandem to not make such a big deal out of it.
She dotes over Tony especially, stroking his face and hair. “You’re not looking so good, that’s not a happy face. Must not be eating good enough food but we fix that today,” she tuts, then turns on Steve with a scolding finger. “Make sure he keeps eating, Handsome. You need to take care of him.”
“No, wait! I mean: Yes, you’re right, I give up! I’m willing to admit that you're right and that I annoy people, so please put the phone down.”
“Hold your horses, Captain.” Rhodes interrupted with the biggest scowl yet. “If what you’re looking for is my approval of you and Tony as an item, then you’re far from it.”
Hey! Steve got a plan to see Tony! I want to edit the next chapter as soon as possible, but I had this fic so neglected that I actually have been doing a lot of editing and taking a lot of time and I didn't get my 50 kudos to force me to write faster. Furthermore, please remember that English is not my first language, so if you find something very annoying in my spelling or vocabulary, please tell me so I can fix it ASAP.
Steven didn’t miss the push on his lover’s back in an attempt to get him closer to the duke. The blonde could feel his nails digging in his palms by now.
“Fine!” he exclaimed loudly with resignation. “I told him you’re nothing but a charade; that the instance you got out of the ice you decided that you were too much for this world but you were going to grant us the
The plan was simple; he just needed to mix the potion with Tony’s morning coffee and he would either keep him in the workshop or, if he got difficult, he’d take him to an already rented hotel room by force and throw the key down the toilet.
“But what did he tell you exactly for you to be this angry? I’m thinking that that was a really nice phone, so
“Tony, it will be a really damn freaky day when I don’t spend at least five minutes of my short free time - thank you for that, by the way- worrying about what idiocy you decided to do that day.” Rhodes said, deciding to ignore Tony’s last words. Steve didn’t want to jump to any conclusions, but he couldn’t help but feel that the Colonel's response was probably a way of telling Steve to ‘back the hell off’ from the conversation. And by
“No, mom, of course not,” Steve eventually said with a tired sigh. “Just, no money talk, and—please, mom. No questions about family planning. We’ve only been dating four months. But I’ll talk to Tony tomorrow, okay? We’ll see if we can’t find time for dinner sometime soon.”
Steve’s unexpected reply gave Tony pause, but he nodded eventually. He settled back down on Steve’s chest, pressing a soft kiss to his sternum, and he watched Steve in attentive silence.
Tony held up its glass container so Orfeo could drop it in, then he placed it on the bedside table provided for each patient.
Tony couldn’t blink; he couldn’t look away. Rationally, he knew this wasn’t a competition, but boy did he feel foolish. And how Steve had listened to him, empathetic and kind, as if Tony knew what suffering meant.
The donkey’s name turned out to be Clint. Clint had been a man, until he escaped the bed of a Woman more powerful than he had thought possible.
“I’m gonna show you how much you mean to me, sweetheart,” he whispered softly into Tony’s ear, “how happy you make me, especially today...” he twisted and scissored his fingers inside Tony just to hear him suck in a breath and groan, and with his fingers still spread he pulled out of his ass, leaving him whimpering Steve’s name, desperate for more.
“Fine,” Tony eventually spat out. “Sure. Maybe I keep people at a distance until I get to know them.”
“Thank you, Steve. Then, let us take a step back,” Dr. Odinson said calmly, clearing his throat and taking a moment to consult his notes before he spoke again. “What I am hearing from you both have tendencies of keeping people at a distance.”
“Witnesses who lived on the same floor as Michael Dunn say he had a male nurse who visited twice a week for years,” Steve repeated, speaking slower this time in an effort to hide his irritation. “Yet there is no evidence Dunn had home visits from a nurse or any other medical professional in all the years he lived in the city. His insurance says nothing about any prolonged medical problems, except that he visited a chiropractor semi-regularly in 2005, but that’s—”
Jane delivered him to a barbershop while the tailors worked on his order. They passed a small number of women and young, beardless men who sat in the comfortable lounge and drank tea in polite silence. Jane, however, didn’t leave Steve’s side after she had arranged for his appointment. There was no place for her to sit or wait, so she stood near the wall in a corner where she was out of the barber’s way but where she and Steve could still easily talk.
“Did I say it wrong?” Steve asked, his tone immediately changed from affectionate and warm to sharp focus. “Is it not my treasure? My sweetheart?”
“Water, please,” Steve said in a rush, walking after his host finally and trying not to smack himself on the forehead.
The pain was so sweet that Tony nearly cried with it. Without thinking, he turned his face away from Steve’s to muffle his wet, panting breath against the arm that so gently cradled him, and curled over his head in a protective arc. When Steve next bottomed out, filling Tony’s body to its limit, Tony’s orgasm hit him with rattling force—he bit down hard and came with a strangled cry, all but thrashing in Steve’s firm grip as his muscles seized with all his strength.
Paulette laughed, stealing Steve away from the memory of giddy euphoria in Tony’s eyes as Steve chased his pleasure in Tony’s slack, satisfied body, and bringing him back to the present.
“I can compromise,” Tony replied with slow words, his voice so frail still that he needed great effort to form precise words and clear sentences. “I preferred when you kissed me.”
that would get him out of his suit and tie and into the hot tub as soon as humanly possible. But it would be a lie, and Tony would never tell Steve he was too full to eat his home cooked dinner unless it was absolutely necessary.
“You know, Clint was telling me about how great you were when you competed. The best of your generation, he said,” Steve said quietly when Rhodey was out of earshot. “I’d love to see what that looks like.”
He could drop in front of the TV or his computer and zone out until sleep took him. Those were both perfectly reasonable ways to wind down after long, stressful days. But he didn’t need to just wind down, he needed to
This was not the time to learn that Tony came from money. All this time, and he had never suspected—how could he have missed it? His plan would never work now, Tony would never marry him; Steve was nothing compared to this—
“In seven years,” Bruce said quietly, as if Tony needed reminding. He glanced down at his watch with a frown and tried another approach. “Tony, uh. When, exactly, is your flight?”
Behind him, the morality box buzzed to life again, but Rumlow ignored it and turned to look at the four cops approaching him instead. They carried glow sticks, and Brock tilted his head thoughtfully as he considered their soft blue tint. Electronic stun batons.
Tony stared at the woman he’d been fighting for quite a while who now lay across the floor boards like soiled laundry. His legs ached and his body was bruised; he may have several fractured bones, and someone had pulled on his hair really hard—
“Doesn’t that make it worse?” Tony countered. “That’s raising the stakes, and in a man’s world. Find a way to frame the spot as a chance to address it head-on. Maybe as an opportunity to talk about other strong women in the field, the institutional ways that women like herself are discouraged from pursuing their research. Scientists love implications, so make her understand the implications of her effort to stand up for future generations of outstanding women in science. If that’s not enough, frame it as an opportunity to share the projected benefits of her work. Concrete, measurable changes.”
Bruce gave him a skeptical look that tried to convey how badly he was failing with that attitude already, but Tony was too grouchy in the aftermath of his meeting with Yinsen to acknowledge him. They continued to sit in companionable silence in Bruce’s office, Bruce cleaning through his weekend’s worth of shit email, while Tony flaunted his freedom to consume sugar by cannibalizing half a dozen donuts on his own.
For the people of old Terrini, the summer solstice was a holiday second only to Christmas. Unlike Mächtingen who routinely treated it as a typical working day, Terrini did not work in observance of the summer solstice. It was a day of rest, of coming together, and a day where no one in the community would be hungry or alone. The summer solstice was a celebration of the wealth of a people, and the thought of involving money with their traditions would have been insulting. Farmers shared their bounty by feeding people - suckling pigs and roasting hens, bread and cheese. Carpenters and artists worked for months to create the stages and prizes for the games, while others added to the atmosphere on the day by painting faces and performing joyful music where couples young and old could find the chance to dance.
“I wouldn’t do that to you,” Steve said as he took a little side-step, knocking his arm against Tony’s in a playful nudge. “I’ll stick around, just… in the background. Starch your shirts, iron your ties.”
“You’re not dreaming, Tony,” Steve had told him, almost bored with the question. Instead, he had reached down to cup Tony’s half-hard cock, making a mental note of its size. Before he had a chance to stroke Tony to full hardness and see how quickly he could milk his pet first thing in the morning, Tony viciously batted his hand away and shuffled away on the nest.
Tony shut the door behind him, leaving the demands and the responsibilities behind him to the extent that he could. He was tired, so tired his fingers curled around his work phone even though he couldn’t remember if he was still holding it. Tired enough that when he acknowledged the soldiers he passed, he wasn’t sure whether he did so in English, Spanish, French or Russian.
“Don’t joke about that, Steve. They are the best, I couldn’t even get an interview with them,” Tony said under his breath, turning back to the task at hand.
“Yeah, no, we’re definitely cutting you off for the night,” Tony decided without waiting for the answer, and he reached to gently pry the most recent cocktail out of Bruce’s hands. “Let’s—let’s get out of here, alright? Get you some fresh air, walk a little.”
“The Commander Rogers voice,” Tony snickered, turning a little red at the thought. “The voice that got a promotion, yes. I know it. He tries! It doesn’t—well. Let’s just say it’s more effective when we’re not fighting, but I already know he isn’t really angry if he’s raising his voice, so it’s not as intimidating as he wants it to be.”
Tony blubbered through his tears in protest. It was such a fucking lie. “You don’t know that,” he hiccuped into Steve’s shoulder. “New York could be it, we’ll be over—”
“What the hell?” Tony muttered, mostly to himself. Steve frowned a little at the unexpected response, because of all reactions Tony might have had, Steve had not expected him to be impatient or upset. Though, given the cost of this consultation, Steve could sympathize.
“Drinks,” Tony finally managed, pushing off the couch to toe his way away from the paperstorm in his living room. “What’s your poison, Steve? Scotch? Tequila?”
Tony whimpered with regret. Laura called Clint’s name and left the table under the guise of going to help him with the difficult task of carrying a homemade pumpkin pie.
Steve pulled his phone out to text him a cease and desist when he noticed Bucky was already typing a message.
Steve shook his head and he sucked down an unsteady breath, covering his face with both hands; he was still hoarse and breathless when he husked out, “It’s quiet, Tony. It’s all so quiet.”
On the morning of his first full day in Seoul, Steve woke up to a video from Jim where Tony and Lila were showing the PM’s children the stable of royal horses where they all visit Damask, the little black foal descended from Hypatia’s sire. Damask would one day be Steve’s horse, but for now, it was an excitable, curious bundle of nerves and curiosity that - to the children’s delight - would do almost anything for treats.
Kissing Steve was one of the best ways to spend his time, but in that moment, Tony wanted more. Steve, tall, blond, gorgeous Steve was ready to give Tony anything he wanted. Steve’s kisses were to die for, but watching friends and strangers alike ogling his man, from his thick biceps, to his broad shoulders and muscular back. When he didn’t move, Steve could have passed for an average man with impressive proportions, but the minute he picked up a bottle of wine to pour a glass, or helped reach for someone’s purse that was just out of reach, the gloriously sculpted cords of muscle came into hypnotizing relief.
Even with his mouth stretched around the thick base of Steve’s cock, Tony slipped his tongue out to slobber saliva over Steve’s balls. There was no question what he wanted, and given his admirable behavior so far this evening, Steve had no reason to deny him. He pulled Tony back by his hair until the head of his cock rested against Tony’s panting, wet, open mouth, and with two quick strokes, Steve emptied himself into Tony’s mouth. Tony struggled to swallow all of it, and while Steve privately relished the pretty picture of his come painted across Tony’s face, this was meant to be Tony’s reward, not his punishment. Before it was too late, Steve pulled Tony’s mouth down over his cock again so that all of his come would fill and comfort his pet.
“They were head notes for my boss on the project I’m working on,” Tony explained, “you know how you start something and you think it’ll be a short task, but then you look up and all day has gone by?”
Still, Brock didn’t say or act on any of the treats Steve laid out for him, and eventually Steve realized that his old tried-and-true strategies wouldn’t cut it anymore.
The happy Taco Bell patrons lingered under the colonnades, flashing smiles and jewelry at their pleasure. Steve was starting to wonder what special attraction this 22nd century society had to light and shiny things when a moving shape in the shadows caught his eye.
The palpable irritation faded from Steve’s expression as he stood tall and turned to Fury with a newfound focus.
“Stop hearken-ing and lo-ing, I’ll get dressed!” Steve caved in record time. He got up and took his book with him, but before he walked out of sight he paused and turned back to Tony. “Unless my devoted spouse feels we have time for one quick polish...?”
Tony snatched up his phone and turned his back to the mirror, giving himself enough distance to catch the top of his thighs in the photo so that Steve wouldn’t miss the full view of his ass in his navy blue tights. He snapped the first few as he tried to assess the right over-the shoulder angle. On impulse, he gathered a fistfull of his top and pushed it down over his crotch until the fabric clung to his back like a second skin. Pulling it down drew the attention down to his hips, and he spread his stance incrementally with a small arch in his back to really make Steve’s mouth water. With a sly smirk over his shoulder, he took the last picture through the mirror and sent it to Steve with a simple caption that read,
At first, Rumlow got the upper hand, tackling Steve face-first into the wall and taking his advantage out on Steve’s unprotected back in the seconds it took Steve to whip around with his elbow and shatter Rumlow’s cheek.
“The practice of viewing films while driving a vehicle. Our self-driving conveyances are a relatively recent modification on the standard automobile, the technology is not thirty years old,” Tony explained as he led the way further into his apartment and offered Steve a place to get comfortable. “Would you like some water, Steve Rogers? I can also make ginger tea, or warm almond milk with honey and cinnamon. That was my mother’s favorite at the end of a long day.”
“Am I going to need a lawyer present, too?” Steve half-joked, but Tony, who always had a ready grin or a quiet giggle for Steve’s brand of sarcasm, could barely maintain eye-contact. His gaze skittered between the file in his hand and Steve, and given his blatant attempt to appear calm, Steve shut up and did as he was asked.
“Enhance your calm, Steve Rogers,” Tony cut in, holding up a hand between them and, as politely as he could, took over Steve’s brewing tirade. “Associate Bob Sitwell, what my ward is crudely attempting to point out, our beloved Governor may be the only person who can answer the questions we have. Respectfully, we only request minutes of his time.”
All of a sudden, the people around them in the audience roared in applause and laughter, chanting something unintelligible. Tony and Amanda looked up and immediately saw themselves captured on the Kiss Cam on the enormous screen over the rink.
“No, stay. I’ll go get it,” Clint assured Laura when she stood to fetch the pie, though rather than looking grateful, she looked betrayed by his help. She turned to Steve instead and they shared a look of silent commiseration.
“Hello, Tony,“ Steve whispered into Tony’s soft hair, smoothing his hand down from Tony’s cock to his leg. Steve squeezed the tender flesh of his inner thigh to encourage Tony to spread himself for his master, and Tony did as he was told.
With a great effort, Steve rose to his feet. His injuries prevented him from sprinting at top speed, but even at a fast jog, Steve zipped past most baseline humans. Through the impressed applause of his fellow officers who were comfortably lounging in the gardens with civilian bystanders, Steve ran after the criminal on foot with Tony sprinting after him, struggling to keep up.
“Tony, I… in case it hasn’t been clear, I am satisfied. I am very happy with what we have. Sex is special and wonderful because it is with you, and because we enjoy it together. There is no law that says penetrative sex is necessary, for us or for anybody else. Okay?”
“Don’t give me that! Don’t act like you can’t understand. A Woman is blessed! She has a gift and a potential unlike that of a man,” Steve insisted desperately, and he gestured at himself in his male form with a grimace of disgust as he whispered, “What could I give him like this?”
“Yeah, let’s stay away from students,” Tony agreed, sipping on his scotch. It was still his first drink of the night, and really, for what they had planned he would need to be sober. “Let’s avoid anyone who looks under 25.”
“Fuck you, Stark. We’re no cannibals,” Bucky said with a dangerous snarl, but Steve held his hand up to silence him before it got worse. “You’re probably smelling Leticia’s burgers.”
Steve obliged him, even as he rolled his eyes and grumbled to himself about how they clearly differed vastly in their definition of what was sexy. “There, happy?” Steve asked rhetorically as the bedside lamp cast a spotlight on them, and then, before he chickened out, Steve reached over his head to pull the shirt off.
Whether it finally was his cut off sob that did it, or if Steve was getting to the end of his rope as well, finally, it worked. With a soft reminder to keep his eyes closed, Steve withdrew his fingers from Tony’s ass, took a moment to roll on a condom and slick himself up before finally lining up and breaching Tony’s body.
“Tony? This is us,” Steve said gently, but Tony still jumped at the sound of his voice and spun around in surprise. His eyes were watery and red, but his lips twitched upwards in his anxious grin.
“Look of his arms, love,” Colin murmured in his deep, lyrical accent, and like a moth to the flame, Tony felt himself leaning after his voice with a shameless smile. “I’d rather take my chances with you, if it’s all the same to you.”
Steve’s teeth flashed in a predatory grin. He squeezed a handful of Tony’s ass hard enough to sting, and in a low, husky voice, he growled, “How did you know? You’re what I’ve always wanted.”
Steve gritted his teeth and hung his head, lifting his hips again in an effort to clear his head. Almost done, he was almost done. One more crack, two at most, and Tony would be as good as new and out of his hair and nobody would have to suffer.
“That’s a first,” Tony said, a big, relieved smile so clear in his voice that Tony couldn’t even manage to tease Steve about it. “I don’t buy it.”
After weeks of nightmares fueled with anxiety over how his husband fared at home, sleep finally came to Steve peacefully.
A moment of silence passed between them. Clint’s easy smile faded until it was nearly a frown. Instead of answering Steve, he grabbed a large serving platter to start piling on the groceries for the grill. Steve watched Clint balance the tray, and if it wasn’t for his earlier question, he would’ve been astounded by how Clint was managing to stuff everything on a single platter without dropping anything.
“I’m Annie!” She announces excitedly. “Oh my gosh, will you guys come and play with us? My brothers will never believe this!”
Both Steve and Nurse Leyva aren’t able to hide their shock at Peggy’s statement. Steve’s mouth is hanging open as he stares at the woman in surprise, not even having the mind to glance around and see if anyone overheard that statement.
Howard scoffs. “Stane is a great man and an incredible coach, not to mention part of the reason we have all of this,” he gestured around to their mansion. “The Irons are going to stay the best team in the majors, and once the season begins everyone will see it’s not because of one egotistical brat.”
so confident in the fact that he was going to get Steve to fuck him once everyone was gone. He presses forward experimentally, sliding in half-way thanks to Tony’s forethought. He swears under his breath, head resting between Tony’s shoulder blades as he tries to hold himself back, rolling his hips slowly to continue to push inside of him, bit by bit. Even with the amount of times they’ve done this, in a countless number of positions, Steve always feels his breath get taken away the moment he presses into Tony’s body, the tightness of his muscle and reactions his body gives always leaving him in awe.
Steve still looks suspicious that he’s been body-snatched by something in the night. “I think Ty is rubbing off on you.”
“Probably too long,” Steve answers with a laugh, going through his rounds of hugs and ‘good to see you’s to those he doesn’t see quite as often. “I’m glad everyone could make it. Tony’s going to be so happy.”
“I’ll wait right here, sir,” the man in the black suit tells him once they get up to the room, taking his post outside of Tony’s room door.
a thing,” Steve sighs and follows him out the door. No matter what Tony thinks his parents prefer, God forbid he try to show common courtesy.
Tony nods stiffly and Steve can see the telltale twitch of his brow and mouth that he’s fighting back tears. “Fuck,” Tony sighs in exasperation, tilting his head back and blinking furiously at the ceiling. “This is what I mean. The most random things will just… I don’t know. Hit me. And then I start bawling like a damn baby,” he wipes quickly at his eyes, ridding himself of the tears gathering threateningly at the corners. “Didn’t shed a tear until I got back to California and Peggy came to the house to help me get everything in order. As soon as she walked in and hugged me I was done for,” he laughs weakly.
Tony’s fastball streaks forward, straight and fast. The batter isn’t expecting it, and he follows his same swing pattern to make contact. The ball continues the quick momentum, Tony whirling around to keep track of it with his eyes as it sails over his head.
“Yes, I think so,” Steve calls out distractedly from the kitchen, poking around in the boxes on the counter. “Did the delivery guys seriously not bring the plates yet?”
"Of course, I've been watching you since the rookies," Howard laughs, a booming sound even in the loud bar. "I've been trying to meet you for
Tony catches him staring and meets him with a very purposeful gaze, tilting his head to the side slightly as his tongue peeks out to swipe over his lips. Steve arches an eyebrow at him, Tony matching it and nodding his head back towards the house. That look alone is almost enough to make Steve go weak in the knees, and not because of his worn out ACL.
“Good to know Rezzo hasn’t torn you to pieces yet,” The man says with a grin, patting Tony on the back.
Steve doesn’t expect his and Tony’s relationship to change any, even after that disastrous family dinner, but just as he had on that night, Tony surprises him.
He fumbles his keys between numb, gloved fingers as he returns home, coming to a stop when he looks down to see a gift-wrapped box sitting on his doorstep. There’s no return address anywhere on the package, or even his own address to indicate it was mailed at all. Someone had to have dropped it off personally. There’s a tag hanging off the ribbon wrapped around the box, simply addressed: Steve.
She walks closer to them, blonde pigtails sticking out from underneath her knit hat, two fuzzy bobbles on the top of it. Her eyes are wide as she stares up at them, looking to be about eight years old. “You’re Tony Stark!” She points excitedly at him before whirling around to look at Steve, face lighting up. “And Steve Rogers! You guys are Avengers, aren’t you?”
Tony’s powerful back and strong arms shook in anticipation, but he stubbornly found the strength to press up for more. Steve reached for him, arranging Tony just the way he wanted with his thighs spread and his back arched to show off the perfect, round curve of his ass. As Tony understood what Steve wanted from him, Steve allowed himself to indulge, sweeping his hands up and down Tony’s front, gently squeezing and kneading his pecs, his firm, defined abs, until his hand slipped down to cup and stroke Tony’s hard cock through his trousers.
Out of nowhere, the unusual silence of the room was disturbed by a quiet vibration of noise. Tony glanced around the room, careful not to displace Steve or wake him up, and finally noticed Steve’s phone flashing with a series of new incoming text messages on the table.
Tony froze. “This isn’t what it looks like,” he said at the same time as Steve smirked and assured Clint that, “this is exactly what it looks like.”
“I—the blast, it got me,” Steve whispered hoarsely. Every word sounded heavy, every breath labored with pain. Tony instinctively took a step back even as he leaned closer, trying to peek under the dark hoodie Steve had pulled over his head.
Steve’s strong arms drew Tony closer to his chest, shielding him from everyone and everything clawing at him for attention or money. Sitting in Steve’s lap was the first moment of peace Tony had felt all day. In every other part of his life, Tony was the one who shouldered the responsibility of creating a better tomorrow. At every turn, he was the one people depended on -
“Sorry,” Steve murmured with an unhappy grunt. He turned back into bed and shuffled a little closer, but he didn’t seem to be falling asleep again. “Forgot to turn off my alarm.”
“Jesus fucking Christ, stop,” Tony grunted and made a show of readjusting in his seat. “I didn’t consent to any of this. Keep your culinary dirty talk to yourself, Rogers. After this press tour, it’s boiled chicken and porridge and brown rice and juiced spinach every day for months.”
Tony blinked at him in shock. Steve had already left the table and marching away when Tony managed to stutter, “But—Steve Rogers, why? What is happening—”
Steve rocked forward and nearly crawled away at the unexpected sensation, but Tony’s grip was too strong. He held Steve in place, with his ass spread open like a gift, and with absolutely no regard for air or Steve’s internal panic, Tony laid into his task like a starving man. He bit, tugged, and sucked at the furrowed rim of Steve’s hole, rolling and flicking his tongue over and around it. He slipped first one, then both, thumbs into Steve; it was a tight fit, but he wedged them both in, finger fucking him slowly until his hole relaxed enough to stretch.
With a quiet huff of amusement and a quick glance at Peggy, Steve shook his head slowly. “Right, sure. From the beginning, Tony and I decided to plan our working schedules together. We make an effort not work on different projects at the same time. Sometimes he declines on projects he likes because he wants me to take a certain part, but this past year was great for him, a lot of exceptional opportunities came forward and, for me, it’s been a pleasure to have the time and presence of mind to be there for him.”
“Why are you so late, James?” she whispered, leaning into his offered touch. “You left me here, pining away without so much as a postcard to keep me warm.”
Steve startled back to the present and forced his attention back on Tony and Natasha. “Sorry, something just came to me,” he lied, even though his ex and his partner were the last people to fall for it. He wasn’t even sure which of them had spoken a second ago. “Can you say that again?”
With a gentle touch of his fingers, Steve tipped Tony’s head back to clean up his throat and his jawline. Tony closed his eyes and relaxed into the position Steve wanted of him. The distinct, familiar scent of Steve eased the last, lingering trace of tension in Tony’s shoulders until his entire world narrowed down to savoring the smell of his husband with his every breath and drifting as Steve’s words wash over him. Before long, the tender, repetitive sweeps of the razor over his skin carried him away to a space beyond the burden of his position and his responsibilities, and in these sacred few minutes before the day began, Tony floated in their shared momentary peace, safe, loved, and content in Steve’s arms.
In a rare show of urgency, Tony rushed to interrupt him.  “No, no, it won’t be too late, I’ll stay. I can be in New York. Can I take you to dinner on Monday?”
“Mom!” Tony shouted into the house as they walked out into the foyer. His jeans were loose around his thighs and hanging off his hips, and he had to hold them up by hand if he didn’t want them dragging on the floor. Steve cringed at the loud volume, and tugged on the belt loops of Tony’s loose jeans in a non-verbal rebuke, but Tony ignored him and kept shouting. “Mom, where are my belts? Mom?”
Tony only grunted softly in reply, but he pressed his hips back to meet every stroke of Steve’s hand, clearly eager for harder, deeper, faster thrusts. But just because he understood what Tony wanted didn’t mean Steve would give it to him yet.
“Yes, right. So, primates. Chimps live in big groups with females and other males, like us, and like most promiscuous species, they evolved to have huge testicles, because the more sperm they produce, the greater their chances of producing offspring. Again, since the penis isn’t important in reproduction, it’s pretty small. For humans, though, the shape and length of the penis are most important. The shape scrapes out the sperm of previous males, but that’s only effective
“Relax, darling,” Tony whispered, smoothing the heel of his palm over Steve’s back, rubbing slow, gentle circles over his muscles to help angle Steve’s hips better and help release the tension in Steve’s lower back.
“He—yes, he,” Steve tried to explain, almost convinced Howard would appear any second to chase him from the property. “We agree it’s quick, so there’ll be a prenup.”
For five shuddering seconds, Steve watched as Tony’s lizard brain and his moral compass of Southern propriety duked it out across his face.
There was a loveseat and a small, round table with three chairs. In true, student apartment fashion, none of it matched.
Smirking, he made his way out of the crowd and easily found Brock and Sharon still celebrating their win.
“Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” Bruce said before Fury’s glare turned into an unsanctioned shouting match. “How was the fiendish lunatic Brock Rumlow apprehended back in the 21st?”
“That’s not a bad—I’ll get him a cab,” Tony agreed while Bruce tried to insist that he wanted to help. It became a bit of a juggling act getting Bruce to go along with them, and Tony was backing out of the bar talking over Bruce’s head while uncapping the water bottle Thor had passed him when he backed right into someone.
“Let me talk to him, Sparky, this isn’t what I—this isn’t about you,” Tony was whispering behind him, and boy, he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t tempted to let Tony handle it.
“For lions, that’s what matters,” Tony said with a smile. “But what is important to any animal depends on many things. For lions, the males need to be strong, but that’s not true for all animals. Male birds, for example, have evolved to dance and sing, to build nests, and to have beautiful feathers, like the peacock. What they have in common is why they do it: they want to have babies, they all want to be dads.”
Tony’s mouth curved up into a drowsy smile. Soon he couldn’t keep his eyes open, but in a last effort to communicate to Steve that he wanted him close, that Tony was happy that he was with him, Tony’s fingers twitched around Steve’s gentle grip in a sleepy facsimile of a squeeze.
“Lizzo. Charlize Theron. Anne Hathaway. Rebel Wilson. Jason Mamoa. Rachel Weisz. Rachel Weisz’s husband.”
“Hydrangeas are for apologies?” Steve echoed under his breath in disbelief, and a faint blush of embarrassment rose in his cheeks. “Christ, I didn’t—Tony, I was trying to propose!” he all but croaked, a breath away from laughing at his damn misjudgment. “I thought I’d hide the key in the flowers, give you the flower pot, and let you find the key. I thought it’d be ...romantic, I’d bring you here, we’d plant the flower in the garden so we’d always see it - except I never knew what to say. So, I brought you here instead. It was simpler,” he admitted with a sheepish smile that Tony couldn’t resist comforting with another kiss.
“Technically, hydrangeas are bushes,” Steve said—not because it mattered, but because they finally had something neutral to talk about. “They change color based on the acidity in the soil, and I don’t know what’s going on in this country but they’ve got the most beautiful hydrangeas I’ve ever seen so I thought, you know… maybe we should, uh. Do this instead?”
Except Jane wasn’t leaving alone. Steve was grabbing his leather jacket off the chair he hadn’t bothered to sit in once and followed Jane through the crowd - back to Tony!
“I oversee lectures at the vocational institute on Nk-nmwyn. We have a series on their kind coming up, two females but no males. All costs covered, of course, with a good stipend,” it assured Steve before Steve could dismiss the offer. “And a handsome fee for each female the male can breed.”
Tony blinked his eyes wide open and stared back in surprise. “What? But, it will be my first time,” he couldn’t help but say. He wasn’t sure when the idea of bottoming had turned from a daunting concept to a rite of passage, but if it wasn’t for Steve’s comforting touch, Tony would have felt very wronged.
“We haven’t practiced cross examination in a case like this; he will tear you apart,” Natasha responded firmly and calmly. “If we settle, you can get half the assets and joint custody.”
“I got her,” Steve promised and scooped her away in one big palm, and it was only by the skin of his teeth (or the added clarity of his third cup of coffee backstage) that Tony managed to brush off the sudden absence of puppy and return to Karl’s question.
“It’s not easy accepting that you’re a person like me,” Steve eventually said. “You were the first writer who treated marginalized stories like any other story. You taught me that this whole… mainstream, heteronormative, 2.5 kids and a mortgage was a hegemonic idea that wasn’t necessarily reflective of the human experience. You made me feel like I wasn’t destined to be the sidekick to some straight character, that I could be the star of my story just like anybody else. And I know it’s unfair to you,” Steve had to say, “I know it is. But… I just never expected you to be…”
“Not for everyone, Stark. For you,” Bucky reminded him, firmly but not unkindly. “For sheep who obey Pierce’s fucked up rules. We’ve got none of the shit you just said, mother’s die, children starve, but they starve with the rest of us, and they get to be themselves.”
“Romantic, intimate, embarrassing—you name it, Tony, and it’s about you,” Steve confessed in a rush. Tony’s affirmation left Steve feverish to tell him more, to tell him everything he’d been dying to say for so long. “I can’t stop thinking about you. Anything that happens, I want to tell you about it. Every night before bed, I want to hear how your day was; every morning I want to know if you’re alright. I can’t stop thinking about kissing you,” he added softly, almost growling around his words. “I can’t stop thinking how you’d feel in my arms.”
“No trying to bond without me,” Steve told them with a smart grin, pushing the kitchen door open to beckon them in. “If you’re going to embarrass me, you have to do it to my face.”
“Tony, as big as you think he looks in pictures or in movies,” Steve said dryly, “double it. The man is bigger than a truck. Real nice, though.”
“I was the one who spilled water on you,” Tony reminded him as they walked to a table in the corner.
Apart from the rare occasions of having friends over, Steve and Tony rarely spent time together on the first floor. There was their living room, dining room, kitchen, and two guest rooms in case friends needed to crash. The second floor was entirely dedicated to their bedroom, and much like their reluctance to be downstairs together, they rarely lingered in their bedroom alone. So even though Steve left for work well before Tony ever wanted to crawl out of bed, Tony usually trailed after Steve to doze in the guest room downstairs while Steve made breakfast. They spent those mornings in silence, with Tony napping in the guest bed while Steve sat at the desk in the guestroom and enjoyed his breakfast.
The third victim was the one who’d finally convinced Steve that this was all a bigger case. He’d been a quiet philosophy student at Columbia University, a privileged young man with a clear plan in life, whom his friends described as someone who only pulled his nose out of books twice a week to practice Capoeira. He’d been missing for almost ten months until a few weeks ago, when his remains were found behind his old apartment building.
Steve didn’t open Tony’s duffle bag until he was sure Tony kneeled on the couch again. He didn’t want this night to pass too quickly, so to the extent that he could, he wanted to give them some time to cool off first.
“Let’s start small, figure out what you like,” he said with a smile, tugging the shirt out of his pants to take off and toss aside. His hat followed. “Work our way up from there.”
But once he recovered from his surprise, it was the look of heartbreak in her eyes that really stayed with him. Steve couldn’t tell if it was a sadness over love lost, or if she was afraid for her children, but either way it was enough to make Steve a little nauseous.
“I got you,” he whispered, and when Steve blinked his eyes open and looked into Tony’s eyes, he found himself believing him. “You’re safe, Steve, it’s my idiot—”
“...Steve? What’s wrong?” Tony asked, looking down at himself to be sure he wasn’t bleeding through his vest or something. Workshop scrapes usually looked worse than they were, but Steve never liked the idea of Tony’s blood leaving his body.
’s Josh Horowitz running up to him. Steve placed his phone face down on the table to shake the man’s hand.
to let you go. I am choosing to let you go. I asked you over a dozen times to get Foster to do Ellen, and you didn’t. You are redundant and a waste of my department’s resources.”
“Nothing would make me happier,” Steve assured him as calmly as he could. His fiance-to-be looked paler than normal, and Steve didn’t envy him the burden of proposing. It was important, and a memory they would cherish for decades to come. It would be second only to their wedding day, and Steve was doing his best to both soak it all in without being too obvious about the love and happiness trying to burst out of him with every breath.
