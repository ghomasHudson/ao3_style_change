“Ah, sorry, I’ll just, ah…” Tony stammered, momentarily unsure what he was supposed to do. Usually, the plan was basically the home version of an escape room, where he extricated himself from the situation as soon as possible. This was…different.  He wanted to—to touch. Be touched. Something. He didn’t know.
“Good,” Tony replied, making Steve’s shoulders sag with relief.  His face gentled, eyes going soft.  “Close your eyes,” he said, reaching out to cup Steve’s jaw and letting Steve rest his cheek against his hand for a long moment, until Steve’s eyes fluttered shut.  “That’s it, my treasure.  Let go. You’ve done so well for me today. So good for me, Steve. You have no idea what it was like, to have this today, of all days. All I could think about was you, did you know that?  Of course, you did,” he replied when Steve hummed affirmatively.  “You knew. When the city ministers talked to me about taxes and appropriations, when Rhodey wanted to discuss the guard rotation, when we rode up here and I drank their ale and ate their bread, as my father and his father once had, all—” he broke off abruptly, drawing in a breath and letting the words tumble out in a rush, “all I could of was you.”
“I met his grandfather.  Apparently.  I don’t remember him specifically,” Steve cut in.  “He was at Buchenwald when we liberated it.  That was…a couple of months ago.  Give or take seventy or so years.”
“Ugh,” Tony groaned. Nothing like your dick in a box to brush away the mental cobwebs, Tony managed to think, then the alien leaned over and brushed his hand over Tony’s forehead, plastering his hair back from his face, and, oh. Well, this was good.  He felt good. Great, even. The alien repeated the motion again, then again, and Tony’s mind went hazy again. He knew he was safe. It was alright. The gift was life. Beyond that, nothing much seemed to matter.
“I’m glad it was me, too,” Steve said softly, a low whisper that buzzed through Tony’s head, before they both settled into quiet for the rest of the drive.
“You must not get to see her much, between work and…here,” Tony observed, sounding almost unsure about it, a tone Steve didn’t usually associate with Tony.
“Your shoebox viewer.  Put it on.  Go on.  I’ll wait,” Jarvis continued evenly.
Steve texted back to Brock
“Yeah, yeah.  Wants to ride shotgun, I know,” Tony replied.    “You let me deal with Ross, how about?   Though, if you want to tell me how Rumlow got the drop on you, I’m all ears.  Among other things.”
He was a man, though, and not a statue, obviously, since who would put a statue in the middle of a road, Steve thought, though the man was standing still enough to be one. The man was well-dressed in finery that made Steve gape at him as his shock slowly left him.  He had a neatly trimmed beard and dark eyes that occasionally seemed to catch the moonlight with a silvery shine, almost like the glint of the moon on water, Steve thought.
“Damn right, Rogers,” Tony said sternly. “I do not like waiting to hear of you,” he finished, voice gone tight. “I would stand with you against anything, you know that. If it is a fight that you need, then the Realm has plenty of them, gods know. There will always be another fight. Let it be our hopes, our dreams you choose to fight for, Steve. And let me be the person pulls you back from it when it must be done. ”
“I know,” Steve replied. He reached up and ran his hand through Tony’s hair, letting out a sigh as his mouth flattened into a grimace.  He did know.  He thought he might even want it or had wanted it, once upon a time.  It was hard to say what he wanted, except this. Except Tony.   Blood and night,
“That him again?” Bucky asked, nodding down at Steve’s phone where it sat on the cheerful little dining table next to a vase of daisies.
“We broke up,” Steve told them.
He didn’t mind, not really.  Well, not exactly, anyway.  He wasn’t sure what it made him feel, except that he knew he should probably have put a stop to it a long time ago, but hadn’t for some vague reasons that never quite held up to scrutiny.  He wasn’t sure how to explain it, except that it wasn’t like he didn’t get the jokes.  He’d been in the Army, after all, where long stretches of time with nothing to do usually meant conversations about food or fucking or both.  There was something about the way Tony teased him though that always left him feeling like the kid who needs to have the joke explained to him though he was laughing along, trying to pretend he understood.
Steve’s breath was coming in shallow, uneven pants as he tried to recover.  Tony’s had slowed, though, he noticed. He used a pillow to wipe his face clear of the sweat, then shook his head and looked over at Tony.  Tony reached out and stroked his fingers down Steve’s cheek as Steve bent his head down for another kiss, this one deep and slow, like they had all the time in the world and no need to ever part.  They finally did, though. Tony smiled up at him, soft and satisfied while Steve stroked his hair back from his forehead over and over again.
“I hate you,” Tony answered, burying his face against the cool of the countertop.
“Not with a very great deal of success, Captain Rogers,” Jarvis admitted.  Tony could hear the undercurrent of a smile in his voice, but only because he’d known Jarvis for so long, because the words themselves were steel.  “I ask because, as you have, perhaps, ascertained, for people who care about Tony’s well-being, as I do, understanding how special Tony is requires a bit more than giving the golden goose a happy, little nest, you see.”
“Hmm,” Tony murmured.  Steve was very forgiving.  All things considered, he felt that was a very good quality for his mate to have.
The wall is a shield, Steve thought again, something about it niggling at the back of his mind.  For some reason, he thought of the white lily, so brightly and clearly that he could almost smell the sweet fragrance when he breathed.  He shook his head to clear it, making the chains dance and clink, drawing Tony’s attention for a brief spell, as Marshall Strucker continued his diatribe on rats in the grain stores for so long that Steve was ready to chew through a few grain sacks himself.  They spoke of war as if it had been learned in a book and could be added up on a balance sheet, Steve realized, remembering the stack of ledgers he still needed to finish combing through.  He lacked Tony’s mind for numbers, but he knew what an army needed to run, and even a casual perusal of those told him something was off.  Perhaps he would blame the rats, too, he thought with a flat grimace, as Strucker launched into another round of complaints.
He got to his room and paused a fraction of a second before closing the door with a satisfying click. By the time he fell into bed, the night was in that deep, dark part of the early morning where the whole world seemed to be sleeping.
It turns out that wasn’t it.  Apparently, there were levels of concierge, and it took a bit of doing to get to the right person, though when he finally did and gave the man his name, all he got was a clipped, ‘one moment please,’ followed by hold music.
Tony giggled, then choked a bit on the saliva as Steve pounded his full length into him.  Tony fingers clawed at the sheets, trying to find purchase as his body rocked forward.  His tongue felt suddenly too thick in his mouth, and he let out a long, stuttering moan as Steve continued to ram into him, thrust after thrust.  He reached a hand down to grab for his cock where it bounced against his stomach, leaking a thin, steady line of pre-cum that was dotting the sheet beneath him.  Steve’s hand shot out, grabbed Tony’s and curled his fingers into Tony’s palm, pushing both their hands into the bed.  No touchy, Tony thought wildly and groaned in frustration.  Steve pushed Tony’s hand into the mattress again, then released Tony’s fingers and wound his own hand around Tony’s cock.  One stroke, then a second, then rapid, hard pulls of Steve’s hand while he plunged into Tony’s slack hole, slamming the head of his cock into Tony’s prostate on each thrust.
“Are you…fine?” Tony asked, swallowing down something that kept trying to keep him from talking.  Probably a chunk of common sense lodged in his throat.
“Nmmm,” Tony purred, tracing the line of muscle from under Steve’s knee up the inside of his thigh.  He swung one leg to straddle Steve’s, then bent down, curving an elbow on either side of Steve’s chest.  He could feel Steve’s hard cock pressing insistently against his belly, and let his hips thrust up just slightly against Steve’s thigh so he could feel Tony’s arousal as well.
“Tony,” Tony supplied helpufully, wondering what in the world he’d stumbled into. Clearly the man was overwhelmed by having Tony show up on his doorstep, which was not without some satisfaction, Tony had to admit. He flashed one of his best smiles, though the effort might have suffered a bit, since he was currently dripping a puddle on the cracked linoleum under his feet. “I’m here to—“
“What are you doing?” Pepper asked carefully.
He heard Tony grunt in acceptance, but he didn’t relax against Steve, keeping his hold tight, as if he could keep the words in that way or keep other words from spilling out, Steve wasn’t sure which. At some point, Tony got up and padded naked over to the washbasin, returning with dampened towels that they used to clean themselves as best they could. Tony dropped them haphazardly on the floor when they were done, so Steve got up and placed them in a pile off to the side. His stomach decided to awaken enough to remind him that he had not yet eaten, so he grabbed the tray of food from the small table. He placed it on the bed, and passed the flagon of wine to Tony before taking a drink himself. They ate cold meat and warm cheese on soft breads, sliced pears drizzled with honey and squares of dark chocolate that Tony had eventually convinced Steve to at least try.
Thank you to everyone for your support of this story!  I really, really appreciate each and every kudos and comment.  Thank you.
“Fine,” Steve agreed, not that it had taken much convincing. They had been able to see the spires of the Castle rising in the distance since yesterday afternoon, and it seemed to pull them all forward, buoying tired feet with reserves of speed. He felt a thrill run through him at the idea of seeing Tony again, finally, after all this time. He could bury the doubts and uncertainties under the sheer force of Tony’s presence, at least for awhile. He nodded towards Dugan, who tugged sharply on his horse’s reins, and turned to deliver the change of plans to their officers. Steve dug his heels into his horse’s sides, spurring it forward as Jones, Falsworth and Rhodes formed a circle around him.
“No,” Steve replied, brow furrowing in concern.  “I called again this morning, but it says his voicemail is full. I’m sure he’s fine.  He says I worry too much.  I think it—he doesn’t want me to feel obligated, you know? And I don’t, not really, not like he means it, but…”
“Well, good chat. Glad we got all that out on the table,” Tony grimaced, watching Steve let out a low chuckle, which, okay, that was a positive sign. He felt himself relax ever so slightly.
He felt Steve sigh into his skin, place one quick, almost apologetic kiss there, and raise his head.  No, no, no, more of that, Tony mentally protested, brushing his hips back again.
“Here,” Steve urged, handing Tony the pouch of stew and packet of crackers.  “Try to eat.  It’ll help.”
“Too many fruit bowls?”  Steve teased, his voice sounding light and happy, the way Tony remembered.  This is how he is with me, Tony thought, the idea startling him.  This is what’s been missing since the damn hospital.
He didn’t do it, of course.  But.  But, he
Tony’s fingers buried inside him, swirling around and around his prostate, pressing hard against it and refusing to let up, until Steve wanted to sob from too much sensation, all the signals getting crossed in his mind because it hurt too much and felt too good, and he hadn’t known what to do with that, except that he wanted to beg Tony to stop and make him promise to keep going at the same time. Tony’s knot swelling inside him until it filled him completely, brushing against every part of him at once, different than the slide of Tony’s cock, bigger and wider and deeper, so much deeper inside him, keeping Tony’s cum there. Where it belongs, he thought, feeling a fierce surge of pleasure at that thought.
“Uh-huh,” Stark replied noncommittally.  “So, I’m going with...door number three: had to pay the rent on his apartment and couldn’t work and do school at the same time?”
He blinked down at Steve, then slowly slid out of his chair and let his knees fall to the stone in front of Steve.  He pulled Steve close, pressing their foreheads together, hands grasping at Steve’s face.  “I am sorry,” Tony said finally.  “I am so sorry.  More than I can say.”
“Fall back, and I
“And here we are,” Happy announced as they pulled up to the gates, which slowly swung open, allowing the car to pass through.
“Yeah, yeah, got it, thanks, J,” Tony cut in brusquely. He reached up, fingers hovering over one of the buttons on the communications panel for a moment.  “Going dark.”
“You’re not seriously going to ‘It’s not you, it’s me’ me, are you?” Tony asked, mouth flattening while his stomach clenched and roiled.
“Hall monitor says no more PDA,” Tony grinned, then turned back to face Estes, who looked a bit like a referee at Wimbledon.  “Look, point being, company’s mine.”
“No worries.  I’ll redecorate.  Never liked the Berber, anyway,” Tony assured  Steve.  He managed to shove his shirt over his head and get his own pants undone in record time, finding that a little extra incentive went a long way towards improved dexterity.  He shoved jeans and boxers down, and shifted to line his cock up with Steve’s entrance.  He pushed in slowly, marveling as the head of his cock disappeared inside Steve, moist heat enveloping him, and he felt Steve’s body slacken more for him. Another spurt of warmth engulfed the head of his cock, and that was all it took for whatever control he had left to snap.  He drove in, with one long thrust, seating himself fully inside Steve with a sharp cry that seemed to fissure up his spine before finally creating a sound that was half wail, half shout of something like triumph.  Blood was rushing through his ears too loudly to know for sure if he was shouting now, though he thought he might be, rather wanted everyone to hear, to know that Steve was his, his Omega, his, and they were bonded and it was pure and true and right.  Granted all of that may not have been communicated particularly effectively by loud grunts, but he’d send a supplemental memo around later or something.
“When—we—at dinner—“ Tony stuttered.
“It gets chilly at night,” Steve replied, biting the inside of his cheek to keep from smiling.
“You, as well,” Steve replied.  “Today, I mean.  You—I rarely see you like that.”
Including me, Steve thought, stomach twisting at the realization.  Sure, they’d had one terrible encounter, courtesy of what Dr. Banner referred to as a “whammy” from Loki’s staff, but, otherwise, Stark had always been…just Stark with him.  Loud, brash, talkative, arrogant--sure, all those things.  Or, maybe, nervous, unsure, under enormous pressure from them and his own company and trying to prove himself to a roomful of superheros who kept bringing fights closer and closer to his doorstep.  And then gone, back to do more work for them and lend them his personal bodyguard anytime Steve called without so much as a word of protest. And Steve had let him.  No wonder Iron Man kept not-so-subtly extolling his boss’s virtues, he thought with a spike of regret curling cold in his stomach.
“Mr. Stark, welcome to the High Roller,” the man greeted them, reaching out to shake Tony’s hand.  “Your pod is waiting.  This way, if you please,” he said, sweeping out a hand towards the steps.
He should be beyond happy. Ecstatic. Thrilled. But there was a hollow sort of emptiness settling in his chest, because he’d been given Steve his whole life and not seen it, but Steve never had anyone and never believed he would. He’d signed up to be Erskine’s lab rat and knew when he did it that part of the thing that qualified him was that he was the kind of alone that Tony never truly had been. Steve had loved Peggy and sent the Valkyrie into the icy Arctic waters knowing she would have another chance at happiness.  Had Howard known?  was that what drove him to keep searching?
“Okay, so, you just sort of can move backwards and forwards, like this,” Tony instructed, shifting his feet against the planks of the deck.  “Then to the side.”  Steve mimicked the movements of Tony’s feet, picking up the simple steps in no time. “See, you’re a natural,” Tony whispered, voice cracking on the end.
“S’fine, Tony,” Steve slurred.
“Howard, are you being too hard on the kid?” Stane asked over his shoulder, though his eyes stayed on Tony.  “You let me talk to your Dad, how about?  We’ll get him set right.  Now.  School.  Way I hear it, you got into SAGE from some grandpa’s TI99 and a modem you built using parts you cobbled together from a couple of computing class leftovers and a trip to Radio Shack.  Hell of a thing, kid, hell of a thing.”
“That…I mean, if that…”  Steve tried, but he couldn’t move past the thought of Tony moving on to someone else.  But, of course, Bucky was right.  There was no happy ending here.  And then what would he do?  The situation with his mom wasn’t exactly going to sort itself out in the short term, if ever.  Find a new client?  The thought made his stomach turn.
“You’re not,” Steve said. “You’re not—” he broke off.  Choked back the word.  He couldn’t say it.  It was true, of course, but he didn’t want to speak it out loud, like saying it was pulling the sheet off the mirror.  He couldn’t do it.  Not yet.
“I understand the menu for your dinner has been pre-arranged with the Chef this evening,” the maitre’d said.
“Come on,” Barnes said dully, grabbing Malcolm by the arm and pulling him along like a recalcitrant schoolboy.
The bed dipped and then righted itself as Steve moved his knee off the edge.  A shuffle of feet.  The rough swooshing sound of the uniform moving.  Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see the shadows on the wall move in pantomime, and he was suddenly very conscious of the position he was in, of how he must look and that Steve was looking.  Standing there.  Looking at him like this.  Inspecting, Tony’s mind supplied and he shivered. Swallowed.  Closed his eyes and breathed out.  Humiliation burned though him.  His cock twitched.  A slow rivulet of slick was leaking out of his hole and down over where his balls were stuffed into the panties.  He could feel the thick stream of it as it wound its way down. He was sure Steve could see it, too.  His cock strained all the harder at the thought.  That made the shame worse, but it was good, too, and he didn’t know how to parse that, so he focused on the shadows.  The wall.  Steve.  He breathed out.
“I don’t—I just wanted to tell you.  You can tell Mom and Dad, okay?  I’ll be staring in Fall.  Crazy, right?  There might be press or something, I don’t know,” Tony rushed out.  He wiped the back of his hand over his nose and then pushed the heel into his forehead, pushing his lips together as they rippled and shook.  “Probably need to tell, like, PR or something.  I don’t know.  Maybe.  Just thought you should know.”
Tony’s face, hair stringy and wet where it clung to the sides of the helmet, filled Steve’s mind.  Waking up screaming and Tony there by the bed, out of breath and wild-eyed, telling him he was okay, giving him the date, turning on the lights and having Jarvis warm up the room.  Waking up and Tony there. Tony there.
On his phone screen, the drone swooped and glided through the city, then over the bridge and into Brooklyn.
The cord attached to the end of the cylinder started to throb with motion.  Around his cock, the cylinder pulsed, squeezing lightly, a warm flood of the not-gel coating the inside.  Tony gasped. Made some kind of inarticulate noise. The alien smiled softly and kept stroking his forehead and hair with his smooth, warm hands.  It felt amazing. Everything was amazing. That feeling of calmness settled over him again, permeating his skin, seeping into his muscles, making him feel boneless. He heard a broken moan echo in his ears and realized it came from him.   The alien smiled down at him. Fondly, Tony thought, feeling inordinately pleased with the thought.
Tony thrust inside him, burying his cock to the hilt, and the incredible, burning pressure was gone.   Steve was just full.  Everywhere.  In his body, in his head, his arms were full, his hands were full, everywhere was Tony. He let his head arch back again as Tony withdrew and plunged in again, setting a fast, hard rhythm that shook Steve’s body in the shackles, digging them in to his skin.  There will be marks, Steve thought.  I’ll kneel for him in my marks.  I will be beautiful for him.
“He was trying to sound it, but he had the burning eye thing as his screen saver, so I think you’re fine,” Steve said.  “You told James about me,” Steve observed, more a statement than a question.
a beautiful ceremony,” Matt said.  “I particularly liked the part where everyone signed the legal documents memorializing your marriage.  Brought a tear to my eye.”
Steve was pounding into him, mercilessly, grunting with the effort, the slap of his balls against Tony’s skin punctuating his grunts.  It wouldn’t be long now, Tony had time to think, and then he felt Steve’s thrusts stutter, and he gave a shout above Tony, then rammed into him again, deep and hard, gripping Tony’s hips where there would be long, blue bruises tomorrow morning. Tony felt a warm shot of cum fill him, felt Steve’s hips judder, jerking in rapid, short thrusts as he chased his orgasm.  More and more cum filled him.  Tony could feel a trickle of it leak out around Steve’s cock, and then Steve let out a long, husked-out groan, thrust deep one more time, then collapsed on Tony, managing to brace his fall with one hand, though it still forced the air out of Tony’s chest in a short, startled gasp.
“Good,” the man said, pointing at Anto, then spreading his hands wide.  For Clan, that meant defenseless and was a sign of supplication. Anto didn’t know what it meant for the Others.  He wished he could ask. “Steve,” the man added, pointing his finger back at himself and tapping his chest. Anto perked up.  That must be what the man was called.
“Vibration-absorbing-star-metal, huh?” Tony repeated. “Yeah, that name’s going to need some work.  You really think this will work?” he asked, arching an eyebrow up at the alien, who nodded. “Wish I had JARVIS around to confirm.  Got any more of it around here?”
“How would you feel?  If it had been your people.  Carol, maybe?  If it had been Carol, how would you feel?” Tony demanded.  He could hear the tension in his voice, the plea, the knowledge, all of it, and damn, why did even care so much?  Sure, Steve was great, but it wasn’t like any of this was real in the first place.  It was all just for show.  Leave it to him to try to twist a simple business transaction into something more just because someone was nice to him for a while.  God, he was pathetic sometimes.
“Good night, Steve,” Tony replied, leaning a hip against the bar that separated the kitchen from the living area.  He waved one hand, then shoved both hands into his pockets.  Barnes rolled his eyes, Tony noticed.
Tony shook his head ruefully, though, not without some strange sense of anticipation, then trudged up the stairs, leaving melting footprints in his wake.  He rounded the fourth floor railing, walking over to Steve’s sad little doormat and pounding on the door next to Steve’s carefully sharpied unit number until Steve jerked it open, leaving Tony’s fist hanging mid-motion.
was good. He didn’t let himself feel enough, always held himself back, put on one mask, then another, but the alien saw him.  All of him. The man behind the curtain, Tony thought hazily, though he couldn’t have said where that notion came from, just that it felt right.
“I—what?  Money?” Steve echoed.
“Hi, James,” Steve said with a put-upon sigh. He rubbed one hand over his forehead, mouth flattening as Tony watched. “Yes, I know,” Steve said after a long minute of silence. “I know he got on a city bus. He's right here next to me,” Steve continued, giving Tony a pointed look. “Well, I don't think that's really up to you...I'm not trying to hurt him. That's not--I'm trying....Yes...Yes, I realize he thinks that right now....I think I have a better handle on—no, I haven't hit my head lately...No, I'm not on drugs...Hey, don't start on the Army, James, that's outside the line. Here, talk to Tony,” Steve finished, shoving the phone at Tony's chest with an aggrieved look.
Barnes looked over at Steve, who opened his mouth and then closed it and let out a sigh.  “You should’ve heard the stuff they said to Tony,” Steve said, a furrow forming in his brow.  “Maybe it’s not such a bad idea, Buck.  It’d just be for a few days. Kind of like a vacation. Get away for a bit?  It’s a great place. Really.  Got cable and everything,” Steve finished with a small, conciliatory smile.
was certainly interesting.
Blood was pounding in his ears.  His heart was beating out a staccato rhythm in his chest.  Damn it.  Damn it.  He willed himself to calm down, or tried to.  It wasn’t working.  Then, he felt the light touch of Steve’s hand twist out from where Tony was clutching his arm.  Just a slow stroke over Tony’s hand.  Steve wound his fingers through Tony’s, intertwining them, and gave Tony’s hand a slight squeeze.
Tony knew.
“Come on, you know you look good,” Bucky said, then paused, going quiet for a long moment.  “He’s really serious about this whole foundation thing, isn’t he?” he asked finally.
“I only want you two to stop talking about me like I’m not sitting.right.here,” Tony ground out, shoving back in his chair so hard the legs scraped against the floor.  “I told you, I’m
He had known.  From the beginning, he had known.  Known that this whole thing with Tony was some itch Tony needed to scratch for whatever unfathomable reason wound itself into the back of Tony’s mind and culminated in Tony shoving his tongue down Steve’s throat in the middle of an argument that had begun somewhere over the Atlantic and ended with Tony panting underneath him, half out of the armor and muttering about needing to stash some clothes on the jet.
“Your Highness,” Steve heard himself say, then dropped his gaze as a flush crept over his skin at Tony’s scrutiny.  His hands fisted against the exposed skin of his thighs.  He resisted the urge to fidget where he stood and held himself still, waiting.  His head might not know what it wanted from Tony, but his body had no such qualms.  Heat, wild, stirring, flames of it, curled low in his belly and flicked against his insides.  His cock was making a nice tent of the fabric, drawing up and jutting out from between his legs.  Soon, there would be a wet spot soaking through the material, and that thought was both horrifying and arousing at the same time.  Tony would see. Tony would
“Fuck. Me,” Tony said, letting his head fall forward to thud against his worktable, then repeating the motion until a dull enough ache started to form.  He finally sat up and rubbed the heel of his hand against the spot on his forehead, taking a deep breath before continuing.  “And how many times did I ask him to do something non-world-saving and not—not ‘you know’--with me?”
“Then you wonder how this thing can possibly work when we’re not in the middle of—of all this craziness?”  Tony asked, mouth pulling into a wry grimace.  “Cards on the table?  I don’t know either. But, you’re not no one, for Christ’s sake, Steve, you’re…you don’t even have the faintest clue how amazing you are, do you?”  Tony demanded.
and then didn’t think anything else.
“Language, Howard,” Maria said, making Steve let out a surprised huff of air that was almost a laugh.
“Sure.  Wedding gift is for both of you, right?” Stane said.  He slid the stack of chips over to Steve. “New player,” he announced to the boxman.
“Shall I save this one, Boss?” Friday asked.
Even Jhrvis had looked at him with an odd, dark look, and Jhrvis, of all of them, understood about secrets.  It was the only time Anto remembered ever seeing Jhrvis angry. He had thought Jhrvis would be pleased. Proud, even, that Anto understood the counting sticks.  That he had made more. More and more, and there could be even more, Anto had explained, more with no end. It had made complete sense to Anto. Wondrous, intriguing, tantalizing sense.  It had terrified Jhrvis.
A blurry picture shot through one of the huge windows that lined one of the compound’s corridors filled the remaining space of the tabloid’s cover.  The picture showed what appeared to be Tony and Pepper arguing while Happy stood off to one side with his hands held out in some kind of placating gesture. The article claimed the quickly called and then aborted press conference had been to announce Tony and Pepper’s engagement, which was, according to the article, now off due to what an insider said was Tony’s ‘continued downward spiral’ since the events of Sokovia.
“That bad, huh?” Steve said with a slight wince.
“No, but the way is steep, and not heavily traveled,” Tony replied.
“I’m fine.  Truly. Sorry I woke you,” Steve said.  The horror of the dream was already fading.  A nightmare. Nothing more, Steve told himself.
For a moment, Steve was back in the hull of the raiders’ ship, cold and naked and chained like an animal, and even here, he felt a shiver run down his spine. “I didn’t really get to look at it very much,” he told Cam instead.
“Actually,” Steve started again, clearing his throat around the sudden lump there.  “I was thinking we try something a little different.  We have the High Roller thing tonight after dinner,” he reminded Tony, thinking of the huge observational wheel that dominated part of the Vegas skyline.  “Should be public enough for Ms. Potts.  Maybe something a little more low-key than playing performing monkeys for the zoo visitors,” he suggested, recalling the crowd of people smashed against the glass doors back at the store.
“Tony?” Steve repeated.
Tony stared down at the words scrawled over the thin, blue line on the paper, bleeding through it to the line beneath, like Steve’s hand hadn’t been steady when he wrote it.
The King was shoving his breeches down and pulling his cock out, thick and hard and wet at the head where it was leaking. He reached over and coated it with more of the same warm oil he had used on his hands, then moved forward on the bed until Steve could feel the blunt head of it pressing against his hole.
He undercut his admonition by leaning in and kissing Steve soundly again, his hips grinding against Steve’s under the water before he broke away again. “No, no, you’ll make a useless ruler out of me, if I’m not careful. Later,” Tony said, kissing him again, as if to seal the promise. Tony smiled, his head tilting to one side as he regarded Steve with a soft, almost fragile, expression. “Later, we’ll celebrate, just you and I. And you must have something to mark the occasion, of course.”
“I don’t know.  That you wouldn’t care. That you’d tell me it didn’t matter,” Steve replied, voice coming out high and strained, like he couldn’t get enough air.  “I’m your slave.  I’m supposed to…serve you.  Please you.  And if I don’t…” he trailed off, shaking his head and blinking back the sudden pounding against his eyelids.
“Come to Papa, baby,” Hammer said, gesturing towards the pile of chips that the dealer had stacked in a tray.  “Sorry, old friend, old pal, old chap,” Hammer said. “Looks like I win tonight.”
“It’s where you belong, Steve,” Bucky continued, voice going low and hushed. “It’s where you’ve always belonged.”
,” Rhodey reminded him.  “They might disinvite you from Thanksgiving.”
“I wonder if you aren’t, perhaps, unable to see things quite as clearly as you believe you do,” Jarvis suggested mildly, peering down at his hands as if examining his fingernails.
“I thought…aren’t we going to the observatory?” Tony questioned.  He squinted to look outside the window as they came out of the temporary darkness of the tunnel and hit the glare of the setting sun.  Ahead, a green highway sign informed him that California Boulevard was ahead.
“Just the garage,” Tony replied dully. “It's—I sort of made a workshop. So, that way, I wouldn't bother you, see? You could do your...” Tony's voice faltered. What did Steve do? Fuck. He'd been here weeks. What the hell did his Alpha do in his spare time? He blinked and looked Steve up and down, like maybe he'd suddenly sprout a hobby that didn't involve a national security clearance. Weight-lifting? Mixed martial arts? Distance spitting? Who the fuck knew?
“So, he leaves you to your own devices for a few days—always a questionable strategy, let’s be honest—and then you decide to do something dangerous in the middle of a battle, which, no!  I do not need to hear about again,” Pepper insisted, heading off his interruption, which would have totally explained why he was right.  Mostly.  Like ninety-percent right.  Give or take.  “When Steve comes to discuss it with you, which, Tony, really, you knew he would, you end up basically inviting him to have sex with you.  Now you’re trying to tell me that had absolutely nothing to do with Steve ignoring you?  Tony.  Please.”
He could hear the blood rushing through his ears, like holding a seashell to them.  It muted the other sound in the room, though the flashbulbs flickered, making him blink.  He felt Tony’s hand find his, giving it a squeeze, and glanced over. Tony’s face was tight, his eyes wide, but his mouth was set in a firm, thin line.  He nodded, almost imperceptibly.
“We’re really together?” Steve said.
“For your lawyers. I've got my ledger. If you need it,” Steve explained, a muscle jumping in his cheek as he stood there, something too tired to be sadness moving across his face. As Tony watched, Steve brought a hand up and ran it over his mouth, eyes clouding before they settled on Tony again, stone-faced and shuttered, something gone that Tony hadn't even known was there until it was missing.
“I know Bucky’s waiting.  Oh God,” Steve stopped abruptly, hand going to the side of his head with a groan.
“I think I might literally die if you don’t,” Tony murmured.  He took one of Steve’s hands and moved it between them, pushing it down over his full, flushed cock. Steve wrapped his hand around it, reveling in the girth and smooth, tight skin in his hand.
“Steve? Shut up, and let me fuck you before I have to break into one of these things Pepper swears are art and find a little blue pill,” Tony replied. Steve laughed.  “Glad I can amuse,” Tony said, somewhat ruefully.

“I don’t—I—” Steve stammered, a hundred thoughts seeming to slam together in his head at once.  “I don’t know how to do this,” he finally settled on, since that much, at least, was true.
.  Apart. Separate. Away.  Alone. The feeling, intense and cold, cut through the numbness in his mind, sharp, like a knife, then it was gone.
“And secondly, I do not, after not swooping, do a thing,” Tony insisted, but even he could hear the undercurrent of tension in his own voice, no matter how hard he tried for relaxed disinterest.  The woman moved away or Steve shifted them apart, he couldn’t quite tell, but it was only long enough for a breath of space to open next to Steve before a short, balding man was clasping Steve’s upper arm, smiling broadly and gesturing with the hand that wasn’t holding on to his newest bosom buddy.  Tony turned away from the bar, leaning back against it as he watched the scene unfold.  He raised his glass to his mouth and drank deep, relishing the burn down his throat, the way the smell tingled in his nostrils as he breathed it in.
Tony wasn’t quite sure what woke him, but he felt rested in a way that was unusual for him.  There was a faint, grayish light starting to filter through the large window, telling him it was some unholy hour of the morning when presumably only donut makers, walk of shamers and, apparently, God help him, his morning person of an almost-husband were up.  Steve’s place in the bed was noticeably empty, though still warm. Tony groaned and stretched his neck, working out the kinks in the muscles that had formed from the unfamiliar position of sleeping half on another human being. Intentionally, anyway.
“Gud,” Anto assured him.  It would help the muscles not be so sore.
Steve sighed, and started to turn over, his stomach twisting a bit as he did.  It was late.  They were tired.  It would be easier to just get this over with.  They could talk another time.  It would be fine.
“Hey, hey, Steve, calm down, calm down,” Tony’s voice echoed against the rush in his head, distant and hollow, but Steve slowed the frenzy of his motions when he felt Tony’s hands wrap around his own, stilling him.
“Tony, no way your Dad just picks a judge out of a hat to write up a phony Restraining Order,” Steve pointed out.
Cave, Tony’s mind supplied.
,” Tony spat out in a cruel, wet voice that was twisted with bile.  “I’m sure they will understand.”
“Is that physically possible for you?” Steve asked through a strained laugh, though the look he gave Tony was warm and soft, the earlier knife-edged tightness having faded away.
“Fuck!” Tony cried out, neck arching and mouth working into a wide oh of surprise.  “God, that’s—fuck!  I can’t, I can’t,” he panted, and tugged Steve’s head until his cock popped out with a wet, sucking sound, leaving a trail of spittle down Steve’s chin.  “Fuck,” Tony bit out again, looking at Steve.  “I can’t, I’ll—I’m so close.  God, Steve.  Fuck,” he rasped, running a hand through his sweat slicked hair and then down the front of his tunic.  “Need you.  Now.  Need to be inside you.”
“Do I want to know what’s in the shower?” Steve called out a moment later.
“That’s it? That’s all?” Tony demanded, too loudly, each word breaking off like the snap of a tree limb.
“Whatever,” Brock said, blowing out air around the word.  He looked up at Steve again, mouth flattening.  “Okay, okay, I’m sorry.  I’m an ass.  Maybe this is how I deal, okay?  I know, I know, I should be more, I don’t know, like, understanding or whatever.  Maybe those guys, they just don’t have someone the way you and I got each other, am I right?  You were definitely a mess when we met, remember that?”
“Oh?” Steve said, though there was a clear question in it.
“Alcohol doesn’t do much for me,” Steve said as he pulled the pitcher helpfully labeled lemonade in black marker out of the refrigerator.  It was a small thing, of all the things since yesterday, so Tony couldn’t say exactly why it made something tighten, then loosen, in his chest.  Maybe because it was so freely given, not out of any kind of obligation or guilt or worry about Tony, just because, apparently, it was true.
“Pepper says you’re ready,” he heard Tony call out as he came out of the suite’s master bedroom.  Stark and Ms. Potts had some kind of nonsensical shorthand exchange that Steve simply blanked on because he wasn't ready, wasn't even sure if he remembered what it felt like to be ready, not anymore, not here, where every inch forward was so damn hard.
.  But, I think he is.  Good. Or, he could be.  He tries to be.  Maybe that’s all any of us do, in the end.  Even kings.”
“Just a moment, Captain, if you don’t mind,” she said quickly.  Steve held himself mid-motion, then sat back on the sofa and waited.   “I wanted to talk with you about a matter that I spoke with Director Fury about after our session last week.  A suggestion I had that I thought might help.  Hear me out, if you would.  It’s…somewhat unusual, I’ll admit, but not unheard of, by any means.  And in your situation, I think it’s something to consider.”
“Tell me about her,” Tony asked, and so Steve did.  It felt good to talk to someone about papier-mâché globes, pancakes shaped like dinosaurs that looked more like large, flat planets with horns, brutally competitive games of Go Fish and trips on the subway because you could get a day pass cheap and Steve had loved to watch the tunnels zoom by and feel like he was going fast when his lungs hadn’t yet allowed him to do that on his own.
what it says on the call box by your apartment,” Rhodey responded with a grin.
Steve unfolded one of the lawn chairs they kept up there and sat down, kicking his feet up onto the roof’s ledge and looking out over the city.  Downtown was a haze of smog and sun in the distance, but it was something to look at.  He wasn’t sure how long he sat there, staring at nothing, when his phone buzzed in his pocket.  He took it out and looked at the screen, which showed unknown caller.
“No, he--” Steve started.  “He was just angry…he...” Steve finished weakly.   It was hard, looking back now, as a man, to remember just how scared he had been that night.  Not just that night. All the time.  How much he had hated his father, and how he finally realized, his father might hate him just as much, too.  His weakling son, stunted and sickly, surely a changeling and not his true child, who Steve’s mother insisted on keeping, instead of giving him back to the fairy folk, as it should have been.
“JARVIS?”  Steve called.
“Yeah, but…” Tony trailed off, looking over at Steve, who shrugged and looked amused by it all.  “Okay, so, what’s our play here?”
“You are jealous,” Tony broke in, a wide, pleased smile breaking across his face.
“I—yeah. But, I mean, like I said. No big deal.  It all went away.  No harm, no foul, all that,” Tony replied weakly.
before the Emir overpaid for it,” Steve told her. “The complexity of the color arrangement in such a sterile space was striking. Science and art forming a uniquely visceral piece. I thought it was fascinating.”
“Oh,” Steve croaked, gaze snapping back to Tony’s.  “Okay.”
“As good as can be expected, I guess,” Clint answered, scrubbing a hand up and down his face, then through his hair, leaving it in spikes.  “You know Cap.  He can handle most anything you throw at him.  Better than most, at any rate.  If he could deal with the whole defrosting thing, well, I guess maybe this is just one more shitty thing in a long line of shitty things.  Just…makes you wonder how much you can lose before you break though, I’ll tell you that,” Clint said, shaking his head slowly.  “I told him you’d fill him in on the rest of it,” he continued with a nod to Natasha.  She rose lithely from the plastic chair, pushing the door to Cap’s room open with the flat of her hand, before stopping long enough to send a questioning look over her shoulder to Tony.
“Of course not.  Definitely don’t double check that when you get your phone out of time out, though,” Bucky replied.  “Anyway, sorry to interrupt your canoodling—”
“Is it wrong that I kind of love it when people get all worried about displeasing you?” Tony asked, tilting his head to the side and pursing his lips together.  “I get to keep the cap and tassel, you know,” Tony said, shimmying a bit so his hips brushed against Steve’s thighs.  “Like a souvenir thing.”
“You’re…Kirk, right?” Steve asked as the man finished thumbing through the bills.
“Okay,” Tony blurted out too brightly. “So, this is your suite,” Tony continued, gesturing towards a door.  He typed in the door code where Steve could see the numbers and pushing open the door to Steve’s room.  Tony stepped inside and allowed Steve to pass by him, walking into the space ahead of him slowly, his glance darting from one thing to the next without seeming to linger on anything in particular.
The ride up to the suite went by too quickly.  Steve started, heart thumping, as soon as the elevator dinged to signal his arrival.  The doors opened and emptied immediately into a bright white and gray suite, splashed with color and facing the bright lights of the Vegas Strip.  He stepped inside and glanced around.  A long, semicircular bar was off to one side. In the other direction, there were...sharks.
“On your super-secret mission I’m not supposed to know about? How will I even know where to find you?” Tony demanded with a frown.
guilt.  There’s something else there, too, which is why I was on your ass this morning to throw the guy a bone. Er,” Bucky added, grinning and making an obscene gesture with his hands. “That would’ve actually been my suggestion.  More the direct approach than ‘I like you,’ but I’m just saying…pretty sure it would’ve been, ah.  Well received.”
It wasn’t like it really mattered, in the end. Did it?
“Howard?” his mother called, her perfectly-coiffed head peeking out of the billiards room, where the crack of the cue stick against the cue ball seemed to break something else open inside Tony.  He wanted to run, to flee, to just be anywhere but here, but there wasn’t any place to go.  No one would hire an unbonded Omega.  He had no money to his name, since he couldn’t even open a bank account.  He was surrounded by riches, and couldn’t own any of them.  And there was absolutely nothing wrong with anything happening here tonight, at least as far as the rest of the world outside of Tony’s party of one was concerned.  So, there were some hurdles to his escape plan, he could admit.
There was venom in his voice in a way that Steve had never heard, so much that he felt his back bristle against it.  Tony turned away, shook his head and let it drop between his shoulders, slumping a little as he did.  His eyes were closed, Steve could see, brow drawn together as his throat worked, fighting some kind of battle for control.  Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted Tony to win it or not.  Maybe one of them needed to lose control.  Maybe that was inevitable.
“Let Tony answer,” Pepper said, exchanging a quick glance with Rhodes, who just pulled a tight grimace and turned to put the beer in the fridge.
“Because you feel very vulnerable right now and don’t want to look too hard at why that is, and so you lash out at  yourself to deflect something  you’re expecting from someone else,” Tony said, matter-of-factly, then grimaced ruefully. “I’m something of an expert at that trick.”
It was impossible to miss something you never had.  You could regret the lack, Tony supposed, but since you could never really know what it would feel like to have it, so you couldn’t exactly miss it.  Maybe that was a blessing.
about him, for God’s sake?  It was pathetic.  Tony had a ton of other things--important things--to think about, not some random guy he slept with on some stupid whim.
“Well, I can’t say his real name, and it sounds a bit like that, and...I think it suits him,” Steve laughed, nodding over at the large, grey wolf currently sniffing in the brush a short distance away. “Come on. Let’s see if we can find a place to put the tent for the night.”
When Tony had shown back up at the compound after two months of tapping out, it had taken three weeks to figure out that he and Pepper were in the off-again phase of the long, painful relationship walk-out dance they’d apparently been doing for the past few years.  Except this time, Tony had stayed, and he and Steve had slow-marched through quips and jabs and barbed comments to long talks, too much laughter, almost-dates that ended before they turned into something, towards what had probably started a long time ago and ended when Tony walked into the gym, announced he was testing a theory and shoved his tongue down Steve’s throat.
Tony gaped at him, mouth opening and closing in his best fish out of water impression while his mind tried to process what it was that Steve was all but saying.  That…that couldn’t be right.  It just…no.  No, that—this was a Steve from years ago.  Lots of things had changed.  Lots of time for things to happen.  So many things could have happened.  Many, many times. With many different people.  Sure.  Obviously, it had, if Steve had been willing to play fuck buddy with Tony.  Guy can change his mind, after all.  Guy can change his whole belief system in a few years’ time.  Guy like Steve, who so clearly just shifts his entire moral compass after a few seasons of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
Oh, dear God, fuck me, I like him, Tony realized with an abject, blazing horror.
her to be. Like you.  More,” Steve went on, a smile, one of the real ones, splitting his face.  “That’s you, Tony.
like a bad man at all, not now that Steve could really see him.
In Steve’s experience, pretty much everyone was always better at things. Faster.  Stronger.  All the things Alphas were supposed to be, and Steve had fallen somewhere down below Betas and even most Omegas by that measure, so he’d long ago stopped letting himself be intimidated by people who were better than he was and started admiring those who put that to good use. Like Bucky and Peggy, who would both probably get in line to box his ears if he had a whiff of a problem with his Omega being some kind of genius.
“Okay,” Steve replied, letting out a low, deprecating chuckle that he quickly swallowed when he felt Tony’s hands cup his ass cheeks and spread him apart.  Cool air hit his exposed hole.  He felt himself tense up. He couldn’t help it.  The whole thing with Tony left him feeling a bit vulnerable and off-kilter, but this was something entirely new, and he had no idea what to expect, other than that the people in the couple of porn videos he’d watched seem to really, really enjoy it, even if Brock was right that you couldn’t really get off on it so what was the point.
“I’m okay.  With that.  With you,” Tony said in a stilted, hoarse voice that didn’t quite sound like his own.
“Then we’ll go,” Steve replied.
“Look, Tony—" Steve began, his voice low and urgent, almost pleading.  Peggy was probably already worried, and the longer he stayed here with Tony, well, that just didn’t seem like a good idea for a lot of reasons.
“Met an old friend in the bathroom,” Tony said.  “Christine Everhart. Remember her?” Steve nodded grimly.
“Well, if you’re sure…” Brock trailed off with a slight grimace, then smiled.  “Hey, just think about how great it’s going to be to finally be able to do what we want, right?”
A rush of shame twisted through Steve’s gut that he tried to ignore.  It was one thing to have it happen. It was another thing to have it said out loud.  He let out a sigh and ran a hand through his hair, mouth flattening as he looked out towards the flashing skyline.   “He probably just lost track of time.  He does that sometimes.  And there aren’t any clocks here, so…” Steve trailed off, shrugging his shoulders a bit.
and look at Tony in that soft, slightly awed way he did sometimes that made Tony’s stomach start cosplaying Nadia Comaneci.
Steve’s tongue pushed back, delving into Tony’s mouth, thrusting in and out in obvious mimicry.  The fingers of one of Steve’s hands was rubbing into the jut of bone at the back of Tony’s neck.  Each grind of Steve’s hand seemed to have some kind of direct connection to the tip of Tony’s cock, making it throb and ache as it twitched, begging to be touched.
“For most of us, there are very few true choices in life,” Tony replied.
things when they’re inside the circle.  Things that have already been, things that will be.  Themselves, but living different lives. Everyone who comes here wants something other than what they have, I suppose, and belief can be a powerful tool,” Tony said with a shrug as he toed at the empty cup beneath the stone. “Especially when accompanied with a bit of help of the medicinal variety, let’s say. Just ask Bruce.”
“You like that, huh?” Steve huffed out with a low, pleased-sounding laugh.  “I’m going to make you feel so good, Tony. So good, I promise.”
“Take me home,” Tony pleaded.  He didn’t mean for his voice to sound like that, but he couldn’t quite help it.  “Not the Malibu house.  Home.”  He wanted away from this place, with its endless hills of sand and rock bleeding into one another, with its gray war and death that came bearing his own name.  He wanted mountains and streams that wouldn’t shut up, and to sit outside, in a world that was open wider than maybe anywhere on earth, and look at the dying stars through his telescope while Steve painted dark canvasses of dreams he wouldn’t tell Tony about until much later.
Didn’t seem that much to ask for, when you got down to it.
“Ah, but that is not all, Majesty,” the Ul said. “Here,” he nodded and spread out an arm as two figures slowly made their way forward under the awning, “from my personal collection, two most excellent additions to your harem.”
“I’m glad,” Steve said after a long moment of silence punctuated by the ticking of the mantle clock.  Tony glanced over at it.  Seriously.  Nuclear timing device in 3, 2, 1, he thought to himself.   Don’t say I didn’t warn you, Little Ben.  “I’m probably not the best company right now.  It’s your birthday, and you should—you should probably get some sleep.  Big day tomorrow.  If you still want to do something, that is.”
That had been the thing that surprised Anto the most, when the Stranger did finally wake long enough to shout at them and try to struggle to get up before he collapsed again, exhausted and burning with fever.  Tyber said the Stranger probably could not see well, and that was how he had found himself the prey of the cave bear that had clawed the man’s leg in long, bloody gashes, Anto remembered, absently reaching up to tap at the gouges on his chest as he trudged through the thick brush.
“What?  Fine.  Great. Awesome.  Hey, what are your thoughts on money?” Tony asked.
when Shellhead looked at him, it felt rare and precious beyond even the uniqueness of Shellhead.
“Run along, precious,” Whitney said, with a tip of her glass and a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.  “Wouldn’t want to keep that Alpha of yours waiting too long.  Someone might snatch him up,” she warned, a triumphant smile splitting her face.
“I don’t know. What makes you happy?” she asked.
“That I was played the fool and left broken-hearted?” Tony guessed, making a clucking noise with his tongue.  “Well.  That is one version.”
“Um, you did hear about the whole metal suit, flying out of a cave full of terrorists thing, right?  So, yeah, no.  Not so big on the giving up,” Tony acknowledged with a deprecating smile.   “One of my few finer points that doesn’t involve a Swiss bank account.”
“It isn’t much, really,” Steve said, picking up a small bag from next to the stool.  He reached inside and pulled out the red and gold vase that had been his latest project and rolled it lightly between his palms.  “It’s kind of messed up,” Steve continued in a strange, tight voice.  “It doesn’t really fit in here, with all your fancy stuff.  But,” he said, holding it out to Tony. “If you want it, I guess it’s really always been yours.”
A part of him wanted to just set the food and water down outside the cave and go.  The man could stand now, albeit not particularly well yet, but he couldn’t shirk his responsibility just because he was humiliated.  What would Maara think of him? A healer who let his embarrassment keep him from healing was no healer.
“Don’t encourage him,” Steve said.
“You do say the most romantic things,” Tony teased, eyes dancing, as the elevator doors slid open, emptying them into Bruce’s lab.
“Cap’n America,” Tony said after a moment.  “’Cause he’s the hero.”
“We had dinner at Guy Savoy’s last night.  I think there were thirteen courses,” Steve said with a deprecating smile.  “So, yeah.  Gym.”
it and couldn’t un-feel it, even if he wanted to try.
, he thought, slowing to a stop.  Howard’s private study.
“In my defense, I literally just got a watch,” Tony said, grinning and reaching out to pull Jarvis into a quick hug as he stepped over the threshold.  “Missed you, too, J.”
“Just—come on, just take it. Him. Whatever,” Tony pleaded, trying to peel the screaming toddler’s fingers off the joints of his suit.  “Steve, quit being a dick and go to your Uncle Clint.”
“How’d you even find me?” Tony asked.
“God, Steve, just…” he heard Tony take a shuddering breath, and he knew what he was behaving like, wanted to stop, but couldn’t help himself, too overwhelmed by what Tony was doing to care.  And then he felt something else pressing against his entrance, hard and insistent and groaned through the pressure, the burn, the stretch,
“You’ll be the first to know,” Coulson promised.  “I’m sure he’s fine, Tony.  They have to go dark for any number of reasons.  There are protocols for this.  It isn’t something to worry about.  Captain Rogers can take care of himself. I promise.”
“Don’t know,” Steve said with a slight frown.  “Any particular reason why?”
They both wanted so badly to help him get better.  Where getting better meant going back to who he was before.
Home. Tony, face lit up when he had an idea, the excitement that made him talk with every part of his body, as if words were somehow not enough. Yet, he was so patient when helping Steve stutter through the reading primer. His sheer determination, no matter how small the task, washing over everyone around him and carrying them with him. Hhis ability to see so much good in those around him…how his eyes would darken and grow soft when Steve managed to make him see himself that way, even for a moment. The way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he really smiled, something he seemed to save almost exclusively for Steve, how his hand felt against Steve’s skin, the way his whole body seemed to melt beneath Steve as he moved inside him, all the things that made him the incredible man Steve had fallen in love with all those months ago. If he rode hard, he could be there in under a week, a tally he had been repeating in his head almost since they first set up camp. It was a span of time that felt both incredibly close and impossibly distant.
Steve squinted against the sun as he watched Tony pick at the label on the beer bottle.  Tony was always doing something with his hands, Steve had noticed.  Tactile, Steve thought.  That was the word for it.  Tony was touch and force and kinetic energy waiting to act upon something else, to move it and shape it, bend his world to him.  Not for the first time, Steve found himself wanting to ask Tony about his captivity.  It must have nearly destroyed Tony to have that control over his own life taken away from him.  Whatever it was that had happened to Tony, he had left some part of himself behind, even Steve could see that, but Steve was beginning to suspect whatever it was that remained in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan had been the least of who Tony really was.
“Ask him how many pilots it takes to change a lightbulb,” Steve suggested.  “One.  He just holds it and the world revolves around him.”
Tony called her?
Tony looked down at the book of checks in his hand. The bank name was one he dimly recognized. Closer to campus. He thought they may have even had an ATM in the union. Steve would have noticed that. Thought about it while he worked. Planned it, to surprise Tony probably. The checks were unused, still starting with 101 in the corner. Kirk was sitting in his captain's chair with Spock standing next to him. The address to their crappy Boston apartment was just under their names. Steve had gone with Stark-Rogers, probably thinking he'd somehow put an end to that little debate if he got it in writing.
Seriously, Steve could've at least DVR'd Bob Ross or something. Put out a few of those coffee table books people used to seem cultured, but never really read. How was he supposed to know his Alpha liked art? He was probably going to have to spend the next sixty years gushing over landscapes, God help him. Beautiful trees, Steve, dear. Yes, they look just like the ones literally right outside the fucking window.
“He once argued he would use a shield against the Alien Queen, back before I knew,” Tony recalled. “I remember, because he kind of had this look, like there was something funny about it, and I, of course, thought he was being completely unreasonable.  Okay, Captain America versus Alien Queen…”
Steve started at the man’s words, staring at him, wide-eyed.  “How did you know that I--” Steve began, mouth curling into a frown around the words.
He reached out his hand and smoothed over the sheet in the place where Steve had been.  It still smelled like him.
“It’s yours, too,” Tony corrected softly.  “I couldn’t have done this without you.”
“Yes.  Yes, it was,” Tony said, his eyes steady on Steve.
“I asked Ms. Potts to have someone pick it up from the apartment for me.  You think it’s okay?” Steve asked. Ms. Potts must have had it cleaned and pressed. It didn’t smell like mothballs anymore, at least. He tugged at the lapels of his blue mess uniform and looked over at Bucky.
“The King requests your presence in the gymnasium,” General Rhodes announced.  Steve set the book aside and stood, returning Rhodes’ gaze.  “He says that you believe you can best him,” Rhodes added, raising an eyebrow in question.
Tony pulled his mouth away.  “You like that, huh?” Tony murmured against Steve’s lips. Steve could only make some kind of guttural noise in response because Tony was twisting his nipple between his fingers, then sliding his wet palm up and down over it, and the dueling sensations were driving Steve toward some kind of precipice in his mind.  He managed to nod once, a jerky, desperate motion, and was rewarded with the low hum of Tony’s chuckle against his cheek.
“Okay, what is going—oh, hello, ah, come right in.  Why not?” Steve muttered as three more men brushed past him, each carrying large shopping bags filled with boxes and suit bags filled to the brim slung over their shoulders, though they looked nothing at all like the first man.
Steve sighed and looked over the menu again, though he had memorized it the first time, but it gave him something to do.  Should he order an appetizer?  What if the guy had some kind of special diet?  Gluten free. Vegan. That was a thing these days, he thought with a frown.
He couldn’t think of anything past the pain that stabbed through his abused ass with each bump of the wheel along the road and the pressure on his cock where it strained against its golden cage.  Everything hurt. It seemed to envelop him.  He would find a moment of peace by sitting in a certain position, only to have it taken away at the first jostle of the carriage. There was no relaxation.  No respite. Just the next jolt of pain, the interminable pressure on his cock that burned like sparks of fire, the nearly overwhelming need to touch himself that roared through his veins and pounded an echo in his ears.
“I think it would be smart. But, I was once told rather firmly that it should be your decision, and while that does make me want to bend cutlery, I’ll settle for your promise to take care of yourself,” Steve prompted.
