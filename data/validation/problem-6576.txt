“How is that my problem? Paradise has a price tag, Pepper.” He stretches out his arm, the symbiote crawling with it, hovering in the air, orbiting his body as he settles into it completely.
“No. I don’t care. This is not a part of my life Fury. I don’t do heats, and by not doing them, I am not defined by them.” His voice is a croak, an utter betrayal of his underlying thoughts. Because Tony does want. And it does matter.
Choking and sputtering, Steve pulls off for a moment to admire the now-red lips that Tony is sporting and his own slippery cock. He can’t wait for the juices that will entangle with his pubic hair after he has Tony’s ass. But he’s going to have to, because Tony needs to swallow a load of his cum first. It’s the first step towards submission from an Omega, the spend making them calmer, looser in order to take a knot.
Steve grabs burgers for Tony’s last pill. He crushes the pill into the mayo and bags everything back up.
“I know Tony.” She pats his leg before getting up, and he thinks he sees the silvery line of a scar on her neck that he should have really noticed.
“Fine.” It was long, and drawn out, but he was acquiescing. If only for Pepper. And how it suited his natural inclination towards self destruction.
“No, no, no, please, I won’t! I can’t decide. Both of you are so—what am I supposed to do?!” Tony’s omega side wants to appease each alpha, but it’s impossible, because he can’t belong wholly to either of them like they want, and he starts to cry, an omega placation gesture that he wishes he could control. He rubs at his tears, wishing fiercely that they’d go away.
“Tony is an omega. They’re always going to be subservient to alphas. It’s in their nature.” As he speaks, he watches Pepper’s face transform. It turns bright red, and her eyes narrow in what appears to be anger.
“Did anyone ask you? I’m taking Loki back so he can tell us where Mr. Stark’s Tesseract is.” The other man’s face darkens, the lines of his body stiffening at the insult.
“I don’t need charts and graphs to tell you that your spending on extravagant items needs curtailing.”
He can’t shake these thoughts as he paces from the common room to the kitchen, arms crossed in consternation. It’s his dedication to his musings that gets him, and he allows himself to be snuck up on by the sounds of conversation, leaving him with no activity in his hands to hide that he was here sulking.
This time, when he feels the heat of the other wolf’s cock, the arousal is so strong that he hears himself whimper with need. The other wolf mounts him, legs pinning his own, and presses the tip of his cock into Tony. For whatever reason, he feels slick and open back there, and the cock catches on his rim before sliding oh so carefully in.
“You’re right. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I thought I was protecting you, but you don’t need protection. I just—the way he was talking to you. I couldn’t stand it. And I know I shouldn’t have done what I did. I should have just left it.” He doesn’t say what he really wants to ask, which is whether Ty has had Tony or not. If Ty has been where he’s going to be in a day or less. The heat scent is light on Tony, but still detectable to others. Ty knew that Tony was going into heat and that thought galls him.
“Here, I’ll help for today.” Steve grabs another pepper and begins to cut, making sure the seeds don’t get mixed in with the pieces he’s dicing. Tony watches quietly, his eyes far away. Steve’s arms move in a familiar pattern of chopping, the knife in his hand sliding easily back and forth. The vegetal scent of the peppers reaches his nose and he inhales deeply, relishing that the future contains lots of fresh vegetables. Tony should be more appreciative.
It takes a bit, but his knot works its way out of its own accord, and Steve falls to the side, Tony laying down on his stomach next to him.
it. He has Steve back. Tony is the man who showed Steve the future, but Bucky is the one who brought the past—and Steve has taken to that like a hot knife through butter. He’s sliced and crowded and
“Ah, well. You picked a hell of an omega to lay hands on. Oh don’t give me that look, it really is the right word. Mr. Stark is well connected within the community. He’s admired by many. Sorry, I’m not helping much, am I? The way you come back. Well, you have to apologize. And you have to mean it. Understand what you did wrong, and tell him you’re sorry. That’s all you can do. It’s up to him if he wants to forgive you. You can’t ask him to forgive you. What you need to do is forgive yourself. And doing that is a journey that starts with figuring out why you did what you did, and what you need in order to not do it again. Do you understand, son?”
“I’m not going anywhere.” There’s nowhere to go. He has to stay right here for when Steve gets back.
His heart is starting to pound, and his hands are clammy with sweat. He pulls his elbows tight to his body, his shoulders clenched together.
Tony hunches forward, spent, and Steve grasps at Tony’s shoulders to hold the omega up just enough to keep him from crashing down completely.
“You know, sometimes I’m jealous. You reinvent the rules. You change paradigms. You answer to no one, not even death. So I’m a little surprised that I see you looking to make money as though that’s what power is.” Steve stays serene, collected. It’s always been a weakness of Stark’s to poke and prod. His former self couldn’t admit that he enjoyed it that much, but Steve is of a different kind; he adores it. He wants Tony’s attention.
He very much dislikes feeling wrong-footed. He thought he was done with that after his realignment, yet there’s something about Rogers that makes him off balance every time. Pesky, useless
For a moment, he stays stock still, looking at the scene before him. This is something he will get to keep. To have and have again so many times in the future, Steve feels he will implode with the possibilities.
A growl emanates from deep in his chest as he stalks over to the consolation prize that is his breakfast.
“Sit down, sit down, over here now.” The Father grabs two chairs and pulls them at angles towards each other and sits down.
Because when the super-soldier is in the room, his wings do their best impression of that handsy guy at the company party, reaching out to brush against Steve with impunity.
“No, Tony no, it’s ok. Shh, sweetheart.” Tony starts to squirm underneath him, but he’s locked together with Steve by the knot, and there’s no escape for the omega as he whines and tries to pull away from Steve. “Tony, stop, sweetheart, shh, stop struggling.”
“Ok, Tony.” Steve shuffles in closer, pressing himself against Tony’s backside. He can’t help but jerk into it, his cock finding Tony’s ass a perfect slot for itself. Tony groans and pushes back, leaving Steve feeling helpless with want. He brings his hand up to touch Tony’s gland, but Tony smacks it away.
“Out of character.” Tony wildly gesticulates at him, open-palmed hand moving down to up in exasperation.
Which is of course when Cap intervenes. Things get weird after that when the man flies at the Captain, hammer outstretched, and all Tony can think is that that’s going to hurt like a bitch.
It’s unimaginable to have been stuck in this tower for even a month, but this group of specialized people has been, along with a few hundred refugees from the streets. Keeping them all fed has been a problem. Even Tony has had to leave Steve to go out and scrounge for whatever is left out there for people to eat.
There’s a moment of tense concern that JARVIS will speak up, will stop him, but nothing happens. Tony is still lost in his moment when the computer screen before him flickers and goes dark.
“Fine, but don’t interfere.” Steve places a knee on the bed, and Tony startles, not quite ready for what he thinks might happen.
“I would never.” Natasha looks at him as if she is about to suggest that he would do otherwise, but something quells her into not saying a word.
“Well, I don’t have the answer Mr. Persnickety. Or would you rather zombie-out in a room full of people and eat them all? We have our safety to consider.”
him over me. How do you expect me to believe you?” The outrage sweeps him then. Steve fucked him, and it means next to nothing, despite whatever he’d said about love.They’re here, aren’t they? To save Bucky of all people. The man who has murdered more people over the past sixty years without a trace than most assassins can do in their lifetime. It matters not at fucking all that Bucky did it brainwashed. What does anyone say to the mothers and fathers of those people who died? Especially those who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
“Always, always inside you.” Steve slips out of his clothes with ease before he tugs at Tony’s pajama pants, hoisting them down Tony’s hips. His arms are braced on either side of Tony as Steve hovers over him, eyes searching Tony’s for permission. Tony gives it, willing every bit of his need into his eyes, looking to pierce that last veil between them. And when it falls, when Steve is here with him completely, they move in tandem, hands grazing over each other’s flesh as they harvest the field of their desire.
Tony is a disappointment. He knows that. He won’t obey on the field even if he will kowtow here. Steve will come to resent him even more than he does now. Steve is the opposite of Tony in all ways. Introverted where Tony craves attention. Logical where Tony is abstract. A man who follows his heart, and not his head. And whereas Cap is rigid in his ideals, Tony sees a world without rules. How do two people who are so disparate, staring across a chasm, come together?
“You know that’s not why Captain America wanted you.” It’s intoxicating, being this near his goal, seeing it waiting before him, skittish, but his nonetheless. The symbiote stretches itself as Tony walks forward, his hips rolling. When Tony reaches him, their chests bumping off one another, Steve’s entire body is cool, partially wrapped up in Tony’s symbiote. It’s stroking the inside of his thighs, his abdomen, swirling on the sensitive points of his body. Getting hard is a natural response, and he leans into it, letting the flow of metal tug him closer to Tony.
“This isn’t the first time I’ve lost someone in a war, you know,” Rogers finally says as Tony paces away from him. But at the Captain’s words, he whips around again.
Steve doesn’t want this to end, and he wants to stay here with Tony, both of them addled by the sweet sickness of heat that’s overtaken Tony. Nothing he’s ever done or had with anyone before has come close to this feeling of wholeness, completeness that he feels with Tony now. Tony is perfect. He’s everything. Steve doesn’t feel so alone in this world anymore, because of Tony. The creeping sensation of the ice has receded with the introduction of Tony’s warmth.
A sudden chill takes Tony. There’s a small, infinitesimal piece of him that doesn’t believe it. That whispers that Steve isn’t coming back. That maybe he’s hearing things like they’re always saying he is. No one has ever tested their bond. No one has ever believed them.
So he flips Tony over onto his back, lifting his Omega with ease and settling him back into the softest materials he could find. Tony’s hand lazily moves to cover his cock, the other scraping at Steve’s chest.
“Tony, when was this meeting with Fury?” Pepper is hustling him into his jacket now, turning the cuffs of his dress shirt inward before securing them with a pair of glitzy cufflinks. He let himself be dressed now, marveling at her efficiency. Tonight was a gala fundraiser celebrating the successful cleanup of New York. This newly opened ballroom would play host to the most riveting persons in New York tonight, likely including some SHIELD agents. Hopefully not Fury.
“No, you went headlong without thinking about the consequences for him! For this team! Do you realize that his company won’t allow an Omega to lead it? That Tony could–” Steve cuts Nat off.
“You do that. And don’t add your scent to any of my options, because I definitely can’t see myself banging the human equivalent of a conspiracy theory. So third, you know what I want. Don’t hold out on me.” At that, Fury’s conceited smile curled into amusement.
Steve knows, he knows he’s supposed to listen, but this is an overload of all his senses. He’s dumbstruck, afraid, lost. He wasn’t the only omega boy, but he was one of a few. Did his mother keep him away from the other omegas on purpose? Now that he thinks about it, he remembers Sarah steering him clear of sitting near them. They always stuck to their own pew if they could, sandwiched in by betas.
Another wave of need rolls through him, and he wipes his forehead with his wrist, the skin coming away wet with sweat. This is very not good.
He paints, he works for SHIELD, he rides his bike, he cooks, he has Bucky, and still, still, in the twilight hours he lays awake and scrutinizes what he’s missing. There is no discontent in the materials of his world—every night now he’s warm and detached from his formerly ice-filled dreams. Sleek covers lay tightly fitted to the mattress under his body, and if anything, he’s comfortable. Which is just another word for complacent.
“Pillows and blankets. It’s best as an accent piece, while going for something else like Egyptian cotton with a high thread count as the base. We have something that’s a four thousand thread count, but it is expensive.”
“Then give the pills back and we’ll think of something else.” Bucky releases the bottle to Steve, slouching back down into the booth as if he regrets it. Contemplative, Bucky rubs his jawline, scruffing his hands against his 5 o’clock shadow.
“Alright.” He feels trepidation at the idea of showing off for Tony, but he goes to his room quickly, discarding clothes across the floor of his room as he reaches for the suit that he knows should be in his closet. When he pulls it out, he can see that it’s a deep navy, almost black, with a brighter navy button down for underneath, along with a vest. There’s a brown belt included, and he spots a new pair of brown loafers as well. There’s delicate stitching on the edges of the suit that gives it an interesting pattern, but otherwise is understated as the rest of it is.
In a series of tragedies, he’d used up his suit’s stash on the last mission and hadn’t replaced them for this one.
“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to exit the doughnut.” The man below him looked like he never outgrew his goth phase in high school. Despite the wardrobe, the man looked like the kind of person the government pays to do Very Bad Things. With the man’s one glaring eye, Tony can imagine a little drawer of identical eye patches, lined up with military precision.
“Come on doll, you’re gorgeous. Show him what’s going to be mine. Here. I’ll help you.” Bucky gets on the bed and grabs Tony’s arms, hauling him back onto Bucky’s body. Tony would feel distracted from the heat emanating behind him, but for Steve’s eyes, which are soft and warm as they catalog Tony’s body. Tony scrunches up, trying to hide again, but Steve doesn’t let him, the other man carefully prying his legs open and petting the insides of his thighs. Tony lays suspended between the two men, Bucky’s hands holding his arms and Steve pinning his legs like a butterfly. He’s a raw nerve, exposed and waiting to be plucked.
Finally, the military arrives and starts clearing out alleys for their wide Humvees. Tony thinks about what’s happening in the background. SHIELD is likely all over this, and he wonders how far they’ll go to keep this contained. The World Council is the power here, which means it’s not just comprised of American interests. Biggest issue being, they need to get the portal closed. If they can’t, they have nothing.
—before Steve, Tony had never felt as if he was the first priority, the thing that makes life’s difficulties worth it. Not his parents, not Pepper, not
“We both know why you come here. So don’t go acting surprised or disgusted. You’re the one who wants this. You.”
“I’m going to try. If he lets me.” Steve clasps his hands together. Natasha reaches over and pats him on the shoulder.
“JARVIS tells me that something is going on. About me. And that you’re at the bottom of it.” Tony is shifting from foot to foot, his bare toes scrunching up against the floor. The look on his face is almost shy, and Steve feels his body heat. Almost. Almost there.
Speaking of designations, Tony knew why they brought the Omega in. Omegas had bonding pheromones that engendered affection and provided group calming effects. She probably thought they were going to have a slumber party together, do their nails, and talk knots.
“Oh fuck, please—” It doesn’t stop. The wolf is relentless, and Tony feels a warm swirl in the pit of his stomach that he identifies as arousal. It feels so good. He’s been rimmed before, but the wolf’s tongue is all lean muscle and flicks perfectly in and out of his hole, coaxing the muscle to relax. His hips twitch back into the sensation, and he groans and then hiccups, tears still coating his face.
“How can you say that? Everything I did, everything I do, is for you. Even though they were the wrong things to do, it was only with you in mind.” Tony has to understand him, and see reason. They just spent Tony’s heat together, and it was meaningful, beautiful. Why would Tony want to throw that away?
Come leaks out the sides of Tony’s mouth, and there’s a savage look that’s starting to simmer in Tony’s face. When Steve pulls out, Tony half-heartedly spits out a wad, letting it trail down his chin.
Tony feels wrecked. Ruined for any other sex or orgasms. He’d never cum so hard from tip to base in his life. No toy or other human being had given him such intensity. He wants to keep Steve forever.
There’s no space or time to scream. No empty void where Tony gets even a second to contemplate what’s next before Steve is torn, wrenched from his bearings, and sucked out into the empty air, the rain.
at Steve. Steve, who is gazing at him with such sweetness and light, so much more than Tony warrants. Panic is as thick as honey in his throat, but he holds it there, swallows around it, and tries to stay here in the moment, with Steve.
Tony expects the air to be stale and the furniture dusty, but the place is more like a time capsule. Rather than indulge in this blast from the past, Tony goes looking for suite 105, keeping in mind the code he’d been given.
“I’d say that I’ll be there for him when he realizes, but I think he knows deep down what you’ve done. This is the only way he can have you, so he’s going to take it. No matter what you do, how you love him, or how you treat him, underneath it all is falsehood. Your love for him is a lie you tell yourself.” Nat leaves the room before Steve can respond, though he doesn’t know what he would say.
“Miss me Spider Lady and Hawkass?” Steve goes to speak and call out Iron Man for being inappropriate, but Hawkeye laughs and Natasha replies, “I don’t miss that ego of yours.”
“I wish it could be different than this. I’m sorry for that. But please, sweetheart, don’t worry. I’ll take care of you.”
“Maybe sooner, rather than later?” A magnet, Tony’s eyes are locked onto Steve’s, his mouth parting and nostrils flaring as Steve allows a single pump of scent to escape. It’s filled with heavy want, the kind Steve would delight in painting Tony with. The moment Tony can smell it, his eyes dilate into darkness, pinpricks of iris rimming the fathomless depths.
“And if he says no?” Steve locks eyes with Bucky, trying to suss out what his friend might be thinking. These pills are the key to what Tony needs. If Steve has to, he’ll go elsewhere. He knows that about himself now, that it’s become critical to help Tony even if Bucky isn’t involved. But having Bucky at his back would be preferable.
“Done! Bye!” Tony scurries off to the workshop. He should really call Pepper. Pepper is the kind of friend who’s there when blood is in the air. He needs that.
“Four thousand Kree credits, and a piece of this.” He gestures at himself with a sly smirk. The Andorian blinks, one of his antennae tilting forward towards Tony.
Three hours later through LA traffic, he stands in front of a nondescript building whose architecture looked like the 70s vomited all over it. Checking the address again, he strolls up like he belongs and pulls open the worn handle on the glass door. Inside isn’t much different than out, with hard edges, wood paneling, leftover decor from a time when people might have visited this office for car insurance or to see the dentist. Even the scents of humans that linger there are old. Heat makes every Omega’s sense of smell go haywire. Something, something finding Alphas something, something ensuring there were no predators in the area before heat.
“First time flyer Stark. You’re lucky I don’t need a puke bag,” Clint remarks as Tony settles the man on his perch.
Steve kneels before Tony, the only time he’ll ever do such a thing, and closes the distance between their bodies, his mouth hovering over Tony’s silver-covered groin. He strokes the metal and watches it fold away leaving Tony’s under armor, a tight little number that leaves nothing to the imagination.
It feels good. It shouldn’t. Tony should hate this, but he had to give ole Cap some credit for knowing how to dominate and calm an uppity O. He can feel himself grow steadier despite his mind’s protests to the contrary. He longs to acquiesce, to not fight the reasonable proposal Steve is giving him. Why did it have to be that the Captain could make him so rationally irrational? Even on the field, Tony knows that sometimes he’s impudent, as the matchmaking service had said. And the matchmaking service he’d initially requested were even more right when they said he only did it to prove that the Alpha in question was worthy. That he’d stop, if proof were definitive. But worse, and more deeply, he won’t stop antagonizing Steve, because if he did, he’d have to obey. And if he obeyed, made himself open to a friendship with Steve, he wouldn’t be able to stand the rejection that would ensue. Much less if he attempted to be with Cap romantically, and found out the guy just pitied him.
The Chitauri glide smoothly down on their soaring bikes, following the natural path of the streets, hitting cars with beams that pack such a punch, each vehicle flips and explodes with the blast. Tony wonders if they think the cars are weapons. Or if they don’t want the populace to escape. None of that matters as Tony watches bodies jostle in the cars that are the unwitting victims of the blast radius, people having been stuck staring at the blinding blue of the tesseract’s portal. Fear and sadness roil in his gut.
He unfolds the letter, hiding himself in Steve’s office where the lingering scent of the man is almost gone from the filtered air.
His vision starts to blur as tears threaten to spill down his cheeks. He doesn’t know where the urge to cry came from, but now that it’s here, he’s holding on by a thread, trying to keep his sanity. Getting away feels impossible, but he
Steve’s massage lingers in the recesses of his mind, faint traces of his touch sleek along the walls of it. He shouldn’t have let Steve touch him. Their friendship is too important. But he has to admit he loved it—loved the idea of Steve’s hands on his flesh, pushing in, inside him, to where Tony has no defenses against his hero, his ultimate love, Steve Rogers.
“God, fuck, it hurts!” His legs and arms begin to ache, and the pain in his belly sharpens into a fine point. Slamming his hands on the ground before him, he braces himself for the next wave of sensation. Which is when he notices the hair on his hands darkening and becoming longer, his nails extending into tips.
It’s three hours this time before Tony wakes up, and when he does, it’s like he’s forgotten everything that had happened before and is reaching for Steve as if Steve has salvation for him.
Tony is so hot there, a little furnace around his fingers as he pumps experimentally. It’s excruciating, waiting to get his cock in there. But this is about Tony, and what Tony wants. Eventually, he’ll need Steve’s knot, and Steve, as is his duty, will fulfill Tony’s every need. He aches to put his cock in Tony. Positively thrums with the need to do so.
He dreams of Ty laughing at him, of the warm musk he could smell when Ty wrapped his hand around Tony’s cock and pumped, once, twice, before Tony’s adolescent self came in spurts. He feels every drag of Ty’s hand, even when it turns skeletal before his eyes, even when Ty begins to rot away, his jaw falling off his face and hands turning to ash over him. He feels it when Ty is gone, in his dreams, stroking and laughing.
“What should I do?” What should he do? He wants to say he doesn’t know how he ended up in this situation, but he realizes now that he should have at least been making sure Tony got enough food.
This is how he finds himself having lunch with Nat and Bucky, of all people. Nat is calm, collected, while Bucky is a bundle of twitching nerves. The diner is mostly empty, and Steve briefly wishes that there were more people to create background noise for their impending conversation.
Steve takes him to the couch, where he sits down and beckons Tony to straddle him. He does, knees on either side, staring down at the man who wants to make him a
He screams, kicking more, scrabbling at the ground with his hands, elbows digging into the dirt beneath him.
“Yes, Fury-darling. I am an omega and you can talk directly to me given that I still have a brain with a mouth attached to it. It’s not like that disappeared with my designation.”
Of course, the Avengers are here at the fundraiser. Excepting Bruce, who would likely cause a riot if he made an appearance. Tony hooks his arm around Rhodey and steers them straight to the bar.
The door opens and they stand in an entryway that looks like it has some serious security. Natasha hits an intercom and tells them her name, and the door buzzes open. It leads to a second room where a beta is waiting for them.
Tony doesn’t dare move as the two alphas continue to bluster at one another, Bucky slowly slinking to his feet and gazing at Steve with murderous intent.
Tony is a squirming mess, and Steve somehow finds a way to put Tony on his back, hands still clawing at Steve’s body.
“Thank you, you too. Listen my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m going to have to hang onto your suit for a minute, ok?”
When the water starts to heat, he guides Tony to sit down inside the tub, the omega wincing when the water touches his backside.
He’s not eager to leave Tony unattended, but he thinks it will be fine for a few hours. He goes down to inform Tony, and only gets a cursory ‘yes, whatever,’ for his trouble.
From above, he hears an ominous mechanical humming that causes him to look up. The blue of the Tesseract stretches to the sky, peeling back layers of clouds like acid shredding a lab coat.
He sucks at Tony’s hole, devouring Tony’s ample slick, which tastes mildly salty and sweet at the same time. Tony thrusts his hips back into Steve’s face, rocking into his mouth, and tilting himself up and down. Steve eats him out with vigor, tongue flicking back and forth while he suctions at Tony. He pulls away, admiring his handiwork, Tony’s skin glistening like silver in the light.
Steve can’t see anything else, can’t concentrate or think of anything but the squelching and rhythmic movements of his Omega, who is so perfect that he can’t imagine Tony being anything other than this ever again. His perfect, perfect Omega.
“Sorry, just—thinking about the past,” he offers, his words unsteady. The other man looks back up, wide eyes taking in Steve’s face.
“Stern is going to serve you a subpoena soon. So if you lie, just don’t do it under oath Tony, please?” He knew what Ross and Stern thought of him, and like he gave a flying fuck. Those two were windbags who liked the sound of their own voice and the possibility of selling someone's, anyone’s, grandmother for some bullets, including their own. They didn’t know how to ask the right questions, nor would they ever presume to care who piloted the suit so long as they got their literally bloody hands on it.
That’s when the rest of the crew stumbles in, and Banner hones in on Natasha. Tony remembers somewhat from their conversations how Bruce came to be here, and it’s not looking good for Soviet Nat. He asks her whether she knew, and of course, Natasha deflects into concern for Banner. Feigned or not, Banner doesn’t take the bait.
Tony is incredible, skin so soft and firm, so warm and yielding. It’s then that Tony starts to come, cock jerking in Steve’s hand, threads of spend spitting their way out. Tony is gripping his cock now, and it feels electrifying, which is when Steve surrenders to the sensation and comes with Tony, letting go of everything.
Steve’s pace stutters, once, twice, and then he’s knotting Tony, the sore give of him opening for Steve, allowing the man to bind them in flesh. It still feels like the first time. Like the last time. Steve’s forehead is pressed to Tony’s back as the Alpha lets each of their orgasms wash over them with reckless abandon, groaning into Tony’s skin. A loss of control that Tony doesn’t want to touch again. He is
“Jeez, what crawled up your ass?” He tries to make his escape then, but Steve steps in front of him, all several hundred pounds of muscle blocking his path. It makes the Omega in him quake with fear and lust. He’s going to be trapped, held down. Tony is in a straight panic, and he thinks about a cave, with men on the other side. He’s disoriented, and he suddenly feels hot all over, his glands starting to sting with tension.
“Looks like you’ve got something figured out, doll.” Bucky is the first to move, uncrossing his arms and resting his palms along his knees, strings of wet hair falling out of his messily tied bun.
“‘Tony Stark not recommended?’ Which doesn’t matter, since Tony Stark doesn’t pilot the Iron man suit. But, really, how can you approve me, but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I don’t play Tony Stark when I’m Iron Man. I’m trying to do right by the people in my life, and even if I don’t have an Alpha, that doesn’t make me unstable. Designation-discrimination, I never expected it from you Fury.” Fury strolled leisurely to Tony’s side of the table.
“Fuck.” He lays down on the mattress and waits, holding his body still and trying to catalog every little thing that might be different. His ass is still leaking lube, and his cheeks squelch together uncomfortably. He’s still a little horny, to be honest. That’s not weird. Or it shouldn’t be.
. It rings through his skull, bounces off his heart, reverberates until the ripples become sorrow, and sorrow becomes indignation, and then, rage.
The next morning he gets up for a run, feeling exhausted from restless dreams that leave him with morning wood that only abates under a cold shower.
When he’s tossed to the ground, he’s almost a goner when the hammer comes down right after. He gets away, however, and flies back around to exchange some more punches with Shakespeare in the park.
“Well, he’s got that attitude, where he’s so very stubborn. It reminds me of me, I guess. And he’s beautiful. Too handsome for his own good, if you ask me.” He shuffles from foot to foot. If you had asked him where he’d be today, he never would have thought he’d be here. And less than a few weeks ago, he would have insisted that Tony be the ‘ideal’ omega. The type of omega he’s come to realize doesn’t really exist.
He was burning up now, sweat coursing down his neck. Proximity to a virile alpha would do that. Make you available, make you
“Tony. You have something to do with the changes that have been occurring with him.” And so she does know something. This is bad. Steve feels a shiver overtake him that he hides from Nat by stiffening just so. Swallowing, he tries to steady his voice.
“Not at all,” Steve said, probably too fast but he couldn’t go back and fix it so he just cringed internally and asked Tony the corresponding question. “You think of me as your big brother?”
Why couldn’t Tony look away from those eyes? Again his heart started beating faster. For Benni’s sake alone he wanted to say yes. His little brother who was so insecure and shy but liked the woman who now took care of him. The same woman who raised this beautiful man who was so kind to him because he knew what Tony was going through. He asked him to stay.
Clint got to his feet after refusing help and Tony headed upstairs, Clint moving slowly behind him. They went to their separate rooms and Clint closed the door behind him before getting out of his house clothes, slipping on one of James’ pajama shirts, and crawling into bed. He picked up the book James had been reading and decided to start it until he felt sleepy, which he didn’t think would take all that long.
Even to Tony Sarah looked shaken and pale. Tony snuck out but the two men asked him if he needed anything and if they should bring them food or something else.
When the car pulled around to the side street granting them access to the back alley, James and Dmitri carefully hid away their shopping in the trunk and made their way inside. James had his very own key to the back entrance now.
At one point he fell asleep again, only to wake up when he felt the familiar weight of his brother on his lap. As soon as his eyes were open, Benni told him all about his day and how exciting school had been. It was too much to follow but he didn’t mind hearing his brother’s voice. It was something he would miss on their vacation but Steve had promised that there was going to be a phone in the house. There was no way that Tony could survive on only letters. It was bad enough that he didn’t know if he would be able to stay in touch with Clint or if he had to wait for them to be back in New York.
But his best friend was the only person he wanted to talk to right then and he couldn’t. Not only that, he
From far away he heard a door open and he felt them shoving him into a new room. Only seconds from fainting, Tony hoped he would be back with Clint. He felt the way he was being pushed, felt the cold floor under his face, and passed out from exhaustion and pain.
They decided they would walk to the cinema seeing as Benni was full of energy and needed an outlet. Apparently fresh air helped with healing too, or so Sarah insisted. She ended up walking with Benni, telling him stories about fairies who would hide in the snow and play with kids who dared to believe in them. Steve walked next to Tony, his hat hiding half his face probably for his own protection. He hoped that Steve didn’t see him earlier, hear what his brother told his mom. Even though he didn’t know what it was and what exactly happened when he went far away—as Maria would call it—he thought it was embarrassing. Just one more thing that made him weak and vulnerable. At the same time he wanted to tell Steve about, talk to him like they had the night before. In private. Alone.
“Of course.” He nodded to confirm it again. To have more people here was scary but also exciting, especially since one of them was Clint. “I trust you. If you say Lucky is nice, I’m sure I’ll like him. Benni always wanted a pet.”
Benni told him about all the people he met and how much he learned already, not only at school but also from Sarah and Steve. Tony listened while eating slowly. Even though it was hospital food it was delicious to Tony. When did he last eat a warm meal like this? Tony had to remind Benni too to eat and basically fed him at one point. It had been so long since he could take all the time in the world to listen to him. Wherever Howard was, he didn’t know where
but I’m sure you’ll learn it faster.” James rolled his eyes, lifting his arm to rest on the back of Clint’s chair. “Or Nat can teach you.”
“That’s what I want to know,” Rhodey said, narrowing his eyes at him. “If I didn’t think I’d get a good screaming at, I’d spray your ass with that firehose.”
“For fuck’s sake, if you don’t stop overthinking I’m gonna put you in timeout,” Bucky said and when Steve looked up he realized both Sam and Bucky had turned to watch him struggle in silence, the television muted now.
There was a brief silence and then, “I miss you too.” Clint wanted to hug the phone but instead he told her he missed her too. “Good because I’m on my way. Lombardi’s or John’s?”
side of the road,” Steve teased, pulling himself out of his depressing thoughts. “I’m taking you to Ballycastle, it’s up north, right at the tip top. It’s a hop, skip and a jump away from Scotland, actually. Check the little compartment there, should be a map. First thing on the list is to unpack and air out the cottage. Nobody’s been there since ma back in… wow, summer of ‘48.”
He dragged his hands down his face again, groaning into them. “You inched your way into Tony’s life to help and it turned into more. I forced my presence on Clint because I was heartbroken and miserable over your pasty ass.”
He looked down at his hands, turning the wedding band he still wore. Even if it wasn’t symbolic of a marriage union in the traditional sense for him, it still meant something to both of them and he knew that Natalia had probably pushed herself right in with James and Steve. That thought made him smile and comforted him. There were too many brilliant, dangerous people looking for them for Clint to let himself worry.
“Really?” Falsworth asked. “You’re still trying to do anything with honor? There’s no honor for your kind.”
When Steve finally went back home, it was nearly three in the morning and he poured himself a triple and sat down on the couch, staring at the cold, empty fireplace and sitting in the darkness. He drank his whiskey, loosening his tie and sighed.
the roommate!” Clint said excitedly. Tony raised an eyebrow. “I have so many questions I don’t even know where to start.”
Clint had paused, weighing the pros and cons of answering. He didn’t know where Tony was or James. Or even Sarah and he knew he couldn’t get up on his own, not right away. And he really didn’t want to be alone, so he’d answered.
“Here,” Steve said, handing him another filled glass. “Sleep, my love, and whenever you’re feeling up to it, I’ll make the call. One more before you sleep.” He gently held Tony’s chin between his thumb and index finger, turning him to kiss him again. How he had missed him. His voice, his smile, his laugh! He had missed those big brown eyes that seemed so soft and warm when Steve looked into them. He’d missed Tony’s touches and kisses.
Clint leaned against James who gave him his good morning kiss and wrapped an arm around his waist. “Very nice. Lemme see it.” She handed it over and he inspected it while James continued to go over the instructions for the range and the very short list of Do’s and Don’ts.
James felt the relief wash over him like a wave but he maintained his serious demeanor. “Thank you.”
“Not shallow,” Tony said quickly. “You’re so much stronger than me. You got yourself out. And yet you’re not judging me... I just... I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it that way.” He couldn’t look at Steve knowing he had said something wrong. He dropped his hand and wanted to leave, hide. Something. But not ruin what he had with Steve.
They had discussed a lot actually. Steve spoke about living with Sam and Bucky and his relationship with the two of them. He talked about growing up in Brooklyn and his decision to go into firefighting. He talked about working with Rhodey after Tony had asked what he was like at work.
“Dmitri and I had narrowed it down to two possible people—Fisk or Bakuto. Neither of them particularly like Steve and myself. Fisk is a child and his issue was with Steve encroaching on his territory. He hates me because I always shut him up when he mentions it. Though Bakuto is different,” James explained.
Steve reached out and patted Benni’s head gently. “Hey, lad, I’m alright though, just a little hurt.” Benni’s face was sad and Steve hated that Benni had to see two people he loved in a hospital in less than one year.
“Same.” He put the menu down. “Sorry, just wanted to get some of the less interesting small talk out of the way. So, tell me about Steve Rogers,” Tony said, lifting his wine and taking a sip, watching Steve over the rim.
Steve downed another cup of coffee and thanked his mother for it, pouring over the map again. Dutch Kills and Elmhurst were two of the last areas where they had a significant number of businesses to call. They had to be somewhere there. It had been a week with no luck. They just needed one lead, just one.
“Not at all,” Steve said, looking over at James who nodded to confirm it as well and then back at Tony, taking both of Tony’s hands between his. “In all honesty—”
Steve took a half step back and then paused, unsure and then uncaring. He moved forward to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek, soft and delicate as anything. Tony wasn’t expecting such tenderness and it showed when Steve pulled away and was met with a pleasantly surprised expression.
While he waited for Pepper to arrive, Tony brought Steve fresh coffee and muffins where he was standing in front of an empty canvas.
Tony hummed and got up slowly to pull the jacket Steve was still holding away from him. “Yes, very warm and comfortable,” Tony whispered. “But sleep is boring, right?” He couldn’t help but grin. “You can stay up. We can talk some more, hm? Instead of lying in bed. So warm.”
“More like I have a savory tooth and the rest are sweet,” he said with a laugh. “Sweets are my Achilles’ heel. Rhodey’s always trying to get me to cut back.”
“Don’t isolate yourself. You don’t have to go out and talk to people, but especially when it starts creepin’ up on ya, come find me. Or ma. Or even James if he’s around. He’ll talk to ya,” he said, wishing there was more. He wished there were a medication or a surefire cure but as of yet, a good support system was the best solution he had. “And rest. Not too much sleep, but a good night’s rest.”
She pushed the door open and went in, walking right over to his bed and she gave him a firm smack on the arm. He didn’t jump awake, just turned his head slowly to look at her, apparently not asleep after all.
The following Thursday Tony took the usual order and confirmed he’d deliver it. Before he hung up on Dugan, he quickly added: “I’ll need help this week. Is it okay if someone accompanies me?” It felt only right to ask permission. “She’s helping out at the store every now and then.”
James watched the interaction, saw Tony put his hand on Clint’s, and Clint smile. It was sweet. Very sweet and it made him smile too.
Sarah looked around once, taking James’ hand when he held it out to her and her sons’ in the other. Steve was holding Benni’s hand, too. Sarah bowed her head and said a short prayer in English, mostly giving thanks for having Tony and Benni in their lives, good health, and a delicious meal in front of them and then she lifted her head and said, “Let’s eat, lads.”
“According to Natalia, she was fully prepared to sleep with you and had no issue with the introduction,” Steve said in a matter of fact tone. He and Natalia had spoken about her first interaction with James and she was not shy about getting into detail. “And Clint as well seemed particularly gung-ho, as she tells it.”
Steve ate a couple bites while Sarah asked Benni about his school day and what he’d learned and what he hadn’t understood so well. She normally made a point of going over the things he didn’t understand with him so he never fell back in class. She’d done the same with Steve.
offended that it apparently never even occurred to you to tell me you work at the hot guy factory,” Tony said, pushing his vegetables to the side of his plate and focusing on the pasta in the middle.
“And will Mr Romanov be—“ Mr Cage didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence as James came in. He didn’t look at Steve nor any of them. He walked to his seat, standing tall and strong and angry. He looked different but Steve couldn’t pinpoint exactly how.
Tony smiled at Steve’s Italian. He loved the way he pronounced the words. A part of him wanted to teach Steve Italian until he was fluent. Another wanted him to keep his beautiful accent forever.
There was also the certainty that Benni would be taken care of and Tony wouldn’t have to worry about leaving him in the care of someone abusive. That was more than he had had a year ago around this time when things started getting worse with Howard.
She said something under her breath in Irish and it sounded very angry, Benni thought. She stood and told Benni to wait a moment while she grabbed her son. She marched up the stairs, only glancing at Tony’s room, and continuing on. She knew Tony still had a lot he was processing and not that Steve didn’t but he hadn’t eaten all day. As happy as she was that he was sleeping, he needed to eat and socialize too.
“Alright, I’m all yours,” Steve said, leaning back again and pulling Tony to his side. “Sorry about the strawberries though. Can’t believe I let it slip my mind. We’ll bring her back a couple really nice things,” he reassured him, lowering his voice so Sarah wouldn’t hear.
He chuckled. “Oh no, of course not.” His accent was thick. Russian, unlike Cap’s Irish-American drawl. “Just an advantageous young recruit looking to move up.” He smirked and Cap chuckled.
“There are more than enough books in my room for now. As soon as I’m done there, I’ll come back to you.” He wanted to ask about Steve’s favorite, books he could recommend and books he didn’t like but Tony didn’t.
“Maybe sometimes you have to be a wee bit selfish.” He laughed but didn’t comment more and in that moment Steve arrived and walked him through.
He came back over to the bed but stood on Tony’s side, turning on the light. He opened the small, red box and pulled out the silver chain, dangling it in front of Tony. He wasn’t even sure how to give them to him. He should’ve thought this through better. How did Clint give them to James without it seeming like an overly arrogant thing to do? He pushed Clint and James out of his mind. This was about himself and Tony.
“Oh no, don’t you go giving me that bollocks, Steven Grant Rogers. I’ve been reading that face since before you could shite on your own and I can read it now.” He looked up at her, worry plain on his face. She reached out and held it in her hands, her smile loving. “I’ve always known.”
He looked up at Steve’s face which he could barely make out in the dark but enough to make out his features. He combed through Steve’s hair gently and leaned up to kiss his cheeks like he wanted to do when Sarah sent him to wake Steve. Now he could. In the darkness of his locked room.
“Fix up the joe?” he asked Pepper and she was right on it. “I’ll be just another few minutes. I’m sorry, sir.” He looked to the other two apologetically and went back to fix the sandwiches. To his surprise, Dugan and Jones sat at the other table and Mr Rogers was on his own. He was served first of course and then the other two.
Tony did not see that coming. He was so startled by Steve’s words he didn’t even know what to think, let alone how to react.
you and you did it, huh?” Clint rolled his eyes, realizing that he should probably be working instead of just gossiping in the corner with Nat but the latter was a lot more fun. “You didn’t ask? Didn’t push back? You just… said yes?”
Arriving back at the house, Steve snuck in silently to stash the ring in his briefcase and then made his way downstairs, making an effort to make noise at the entrance to let the others know he was home.
him. Clint Barton refused to ever let anyone do that to him but he had lost some of his fight, his cockiness, and when he turned to Tony, he simply nodded, forgoing his usual smile and thumbs up because he didn’t have it in him.
It was absolutely unreal to Tony that he had killed Howard. He knew he had practiced shooting, he knew Steve and James had been keeping him alive for this, he knew he had spoken to him. He had seen the blood, heard the gunshot, felt the recoil, smelled the gunpowder. It was over. And yet…
Steve turned, his expression deadly but softening instantly when his eyes fell on Tony. He let out a deeply frustrated sigh and dragged a hand down his face.
Tony was being discharged today and when the elevator doors opened, James was stood there waiting and he started walking ahead of them. Steve caught up and they spoke briefly about business before reaching Tony’s room.
Steve was painfully aware of the proximity and the warmth. Tony’s invitation to make himself comfortable hadn’t really helped either because now he was spread out and didn’t want to move again and disturb him, so he stayed as he was—close to him and acutely aware of that fact.
,” Tony told his brother, coaxing him out. “This is Beniamino. Benni, this is Clint. James and he are going to stay with us.”
James stirred but for once he didn’t wake or at least didn’t comment on Clint being awake. As carefully as possible, Clint got out of bed and wrapped himself up in a robe, heading out of the bedroom.
your fault,” he gave back shyly and kissed him before getting up. “I know there’s a lot we have to figure out. Especially me. Will you show me?” He asked with a sly smirk.
“So now that you two have met,” Steve said, “let’s get down to business.” He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and unfolded it on the table. Then he reached behind him and pulled the gun out of the back of his trouser waistband and set it on the table on top of the cloth. “It’s not loaded,” he said, opening it to show Tony, “but I want you to know all the ins and outs of it before it is.”
Howard looked at Tony and it obviously took him a moment to recognize him. When he did, he laughed and leaned against the wall behind him.
“Today was the longest Tuesday ever,” Sam said, sitting on the couch in the communal room and leaning back, his eyes shut. “Buck, what’re we having for dinner?”
,” Tony said in Italian, his voice soft and sincere. He rubbed his brother’s back and kissed the top of his head. He was so relieved to finally have him back with him.
“We did Hanukkah but after my family passed, I didn’t feel much like celebrating. The Rogerses would invite me for Christmas dinner but I just felt strange. Eventually it became
“Somethin’ botherin’ ya?” Since they started seeing each other again, Pepper had been more open with Tony. They hadn’t spoken about anything that had happened, though she probably knew from what the neighbors had told others. Tony wasn’t interested in gossip about himself and it didn’t seem that Pepper wanted too many details either.
“Who needs a vacuum?” Clint joked, although worried about how tired James seemed. He reached over and ran his fingers through James’ hair, mussing it. Clint had ideas of how he could help him sleep, seeing as he obviously wasn’t. And it suddenly occurred to Clint that James hadn’t even answered Clint’s question earlier about his nap.
She decided against waking them and instead went back to her room, got dressed to go out, and made two phone calls. She left a note on the side of Benni’s dresser next to his favorite toy where she knew he wouldn’t miss it. He had a habit of looking for her in the morning after he’d gone to greet his brother and she didn’t want him to get upset when he couldn’t find her.
Tony chuckled at the small kisses and hummed in approval. “I volunteer as test subject for many kisses.” There were definitely worse things than kissing Steve. “I honestly thought you did.” Slowly and reluctantly he let go of Steve. “Will we stick to spending time together after dinner?”
“Hey,” James said, reaching up to hold his face. “You have nothing to be sorry about. You can’t help who you love, Steve. Do I wish it were me? Yes, but I had a feeling you loved him. I just figured better I get it out then keep it in forever. I can move on. Slowly,” he said, echoing Sarah’s words. He wouldn’t drag her into this. Nothing that happened was her fault. In fact, it did feel good to finally say it even if his heart hurt at knowing once and for all that the love was unrequited.
“You want me to head to the usual spot, Cap?” Natasha asked, hesitating to put her left turn blinker on until she got a confirmation.
When Tony was done with the dishes, Sarah thanked him as she always did and they headed for the living room. Steve had lifted Benni up to his shoulders and Benni held on with two hands stuck to Steve’s forehead.
So he fought back, throwing out punches but they weren’t quite as strong as usual. He was exhausted and hungry and despite landing a few good blows, he was quickly tossed on his ass by the two men in his room and hit again.
“And maybe wait on the stabilizers? Just try another week or two without, but get some food and rest. We’ll see if it resets you. There’s consequences to taking Alpha hormones.”
“It’s great to meet you Mr. Stark, I was friends with your father.” And just like that Tony is shocked out of his daydream. Of course Captain America thought he was a replacement Howard. Maybe even the love affair his father had with Captain America was reciprocated. How gauche.
Steve is silent for a moment, thinking. It may be all for the best that the doctor is on Tony’s side in all this. He needs Tony to not lie to his healthcare professional. But the balance to be struck here, is if the doctor is willing to do anything illegal in order to facilitate Tony’s freedom. Which would be next to impossible to do with a mating mark, but the very thought makes Steve grind his teeth.
“Mmm, sweetheart,” Steve whispers into Tony’s neck, right near his gland. He sucks on it, swirling the lovely skin around his mouth, trying to bottle the flavor in his memory.
“—you lied. You lied and if there was ever to be a relationship, there has to be trust.” Trust. What was trust when someone who was supposed to guide you, be your shield to the world, took the very best of you to possess, leaving you to die? If she wanted blind trust, she was years too late. The best he could offer was security: money, Iron Man, his company. Maybe, just maybe, the spark of a love that endured despite those things.
“Yeah, Pinky’s a good cause to give back to,” he said instead. “Fine fella, trustworthy just… not cut out for my line of work.”
“Conversation does seem to suggest it, yes,” James responded, a slight smile on his lips. “However,” he began, and Steve’s eyes lit up, a smile forming as he recognized that tone, “we still have an entire bottle of whiskey that we paid for. It’d be a waste not to drink it, wouldn’t you agree?”
Tony rested a hand on Steve’s chest carefully. He didn’t think the mood would shift so suddenly. “Steve,
Tony was running his hands under warm water, trying to see if anything was in the cuts. “Is Clint okay? I didn’t want to drop blood anywhere.” He carefully dabbed his hands dry and looked for the rubbing alcohol. Luckily—but also unfortunately—they always had enough gauze and padding for wounds.
Benni had just asked James if he knew that the moon wasn’t a planet when Tony felt Steve press his leg against Tony’s. It was too much teasing. Not that he didn’t like it but he didn’t want to be rude or distracted from the others. As inconspicuous as possible, Tony got up to give Steve a second serving, giving him a minute without that unbearable heat. When he sat down Steve made everything worse by putting his hand on Tony’s thigh, very far up and giving it a squeeze.
“Yeah,” he managed and nodded. He would just quickly check up on Clint. Luckily, he was right next door. It was weird not having him in the same room.
James was leaning outside the door nibbling on a piece of gingerbread one of the babushkas near him had given him. You see, James’ home
“I brought an assortment of goodies for you good folks here at 616,” Tony said, putting the boxes down on the table. He looked around. “Where’s Rhodey?”
“The reports will go to Dugan, Dugan will deliver them to you with none the wiser than you’re in control of them,” he explained, having used the time while O’Shea was panicking to think this up. “I was doing the books when I was your age. Younger even. Granted I was doing a lot of the jobs around here but still. And I wasn’t half as good as you seem to be.”
“Filthy, sickening, foul,” Falsworth said, and stabbed him again, in the leg. Steve fell onto one knee. “Putrid, horrid, undeserving of life.”
him anywhere else. He wanted him first and foremost right where he could see him for protective reasons. Then for selfish reasons, he enjoyed his company and looking over every now and then this morning had really been a stress relief all on its own.
“What do you think I did while you were away?” he asked, his eyes dropping to Clint’s cast and then raising back up. He and Clint hadn’t talked about it but Phil was an intelligent man, fully aware of exactly who James was and that he must have powerful, vengeful enemies. Phil didn’t need to be told what had happened, he was more than capable of figuring it out on his own. He’d even come with Natalia to visit Clint at the hospital.
Steve turned to Tony and said, “Yes, Falsworth is a boxer but in the war, he was a sniper.” Steve waited a beat, taking a shaky breath and asked, “Jones?”
“Yes, please,” James said, his stomach growling at the mention of food and he got up to see what was on offer. He swayed the tiniest bit, leaning against Steve.
Steve looked up at him and then down the hall towards his mother’s room, lowering his voice. “Let’s just… I need to shower. Let’s get that drink soon though.”
“You know as well as I do how much effort is required to pull off something like this. Especially against us,” James said. “If this were some nobody trying to make a name for themselves there’s no way we would not have at least heard about them or their dealings. You’re almost as connected as I am.”
“Now you see I’m going to stop you right there, Steven, because that thought hasn’t passed through my mind in years. Not towards you anyway.” She cleared her throat. “Do I think he’s a wee bit young? Yes. But am I worried that he’s too young for you? Yes, but not how you think. I just want you to have someone you click with, pet. Someone who understands you and there’s a wee bit of a generational gap between you two is all but as long as you’re happy, I’m happy. I don’t want you settling just for anyone because you know that finding someone in your situation is rare.”
“Oh, Mr Popov, I didn’t know you were still in there. I-I’m sorry.” The young man turned to Steve, visibly pale in the face and completely unsure how to handle the situation. Dmitri said nothing. Trying to maintain their pretense of having nothing to do with each other was always a nuisance. “Mr Rogers,” he began, swallowing dryly. “Sir, I—”
While Clint was taking care of the potatoes, Tony put down the dough and fitted it into a pie pan. “There’s a crime show on the radio Benni really likes. That’ll be on tonight. There’s more than one radio here but only Benni and Sarah listen to it.” Just as he finished his sentence, he heard Benni coming up the stairs. He liked to go through the office to see Dugan and Jones if they had time for him.
Steve’s body let out its last few places of tension at the touch, and Steve sighed. “That’s… that’s nice,” he said, having a hard time forming words. He was so tired and he wanted to sleep finally but what if there was more to remember about this night? About these rare nights where he could pretend Tony loved him back. “I’m glad it was you… who came in,” he said, falling silent for a few seconds in the middle of his sentence.
Tony considered that for a second and then pulled his phone out of his pocket. He looked up at Rhodey, the question all over Tony’s face.
Tony stretched and cracked his back and shoulders when he got out of the car. It had been his first long car ride and even though he enjoyed it, he wasn’t one to sit still in the same spot unless he was sleeping. Even then he would move around quite a bit unlike Steve who barely moved when he slept.
—not going anywhere.” He needed Tony to understand that there was no expiration date on what had happened. Tony wasn’t expected to live with them until he could get back on his own two feet but rather: “This is your home for as long as you want it.”
He scoffed even though Pepper was right. He could live a somewhat normal life. If normal was working for a mob boss and laundering his money and keeping his accounts. Not that he was bothered by Steve’s occupation. He was a fair man who kept his word and stood up for others. Dugan, Falsworth and Jones wouldn’t shut up about how amazing Steve was as their leader in war and in their lives now.
“I’m not sure. I mean, I liked everything but we never even mentioned it. That’s gotta mean something, right? I’m sure he would’ve mentioned a second date if he wanted one.”
“Sir, I didn’t think you’d be coming here,” Tony said, trying to control his Italian accent. Whenever Howard wasn’t there he focused less on his speech. Plus, Mr Rogers’ perfect look did nothing to help him focus.
Now he inhaled sharply through his nose and the smell was all wrong. Well, it wasn’t wrong but it was different. No longer the sharp smell of concrete and disinfectant. Now the smell was cleaner, softer. He opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling. It wasn’t the hard, grey concrete anymore but a regular room.
“Hey, I resent that. I’ve come to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. But if Stern wants to be a weapons-grade moron and try to take my suit from me, I’ll let my dumpster fire of a personality take care of it.” Tony examined the grease on his nails, musing that he’d have to actually clean up for this one. People wore makeup, so why couldn’t Tony use iron tannins as eye shadow? Though truth be told, he was going to infuriate the Congressional Panel by dressing more to alpha standard than omega. Suit and tie all day ‘er day.
“Want to fuck you, Tony.” Steve looks down at the picture of Tony before him. The man is stripped but for his shirt, and he’s utterly beautiful even in the harsh lighting. Every patch of olive skin is smooth and it slides over lean muscle as Tony wriggles in place.
“Forgive me Father, I haven’t prayed, but I know I should. I just saw the church and I knew I should come here.”
“Save the rest for the turn, J.” JARVIS only asks whether he should call Ms. Potts, and he figures he might as well. He’s glad in this moment that they’re not together. If they had been, this would have been next to impossible for him to do. But she doesn’t owe him anything. He’s not always done his best by her, but he did, does, love her. And she was right. He’ll tell her that. That Iron Man and Tony are linked, and that he would have lied to her again somewhere along the line and risked his life like this.
“I had hoped we could be on the same page, Ms. Potts. Is there any way to convince you that I mean well for Tony?”
“Fine. Goodnight.” Tony turns to leave and Steve grabs his shoulder, spinning Tony around. In the dim light of the hallway, Steve can see something like fear on Tony’s face, the soft tremble of Tony’s lips and how his eyes flicker, and he lets go.
“Do either of you think SHIELD will stop me if they find out? And doesn’t Tony’s happiness matter?” If anything, SHIELD is going to help him make this legitimate. Fury probably thinks they can attain more tech that way, and he’s while he’s not wrong, Steve would never make Tony create weapons for SHIELD or otherwise jeopardize Tony’s autonomy with SI. No, once Tony is his, and SHIELD is off his back, he’ll be more inspired to create gifts. That’s just how Tony is; pressure him and he gets stubborn. Leave him be and he blossoms, making tech at will.
“One question at a time, ice, ice baby. In order, we have zombies caused by some kind of virus that makes them crave human flesh, I’m Tony Stark, and you, my unfortunate friend, are fighting off the virus that the infected gave you when they chomped down on your arms. Whether you recover or not, determines my next steps.” Steve looks down again at his arms, and realizes that yes, they’re definitely infected. Puffy and red around the edges, the swollen flesh is just this side of too hot.
“Oh yes, you do clean up nice Captain.” Tony circles around him, admiring every angle. Steve stays stock still, preening just a little at Tony’s inspection.
It’s the thought of Tony squirming in his bed, crying for a knot, that turns him aggressive as he circles around the Omega.
“What was that?” Tony looks at him with something dark lurking under the surface of those complicated brown eyes.
Steve also bathed him while Tony had a small window of awareness before his heat came and sucked all of it away again.
With that, Bucky steps back and walks out of the gym, leaving Tony to open the letter in private. The exchange feels a bit off, like there’s a piece of a puzzle that Tony is missing. Regardless, Tony is determined to experience what Steve has prepared next for Tony, a prick of neediness demanding reassurance in the back of his mind. The letter unfurls in his hand.
“Fine. You had better, Rogers. The moment you don’t, the very moment, I will come for you.” Nat doesn’t bother paying, leaving Steve with three empty plates and a feeling that he’s just won the war.
The suppressants help keep him stable, but without them, his eyes blur with emotion, and the tight little feeling behind his nose makes his eyes wet. He tries to catch it, but the tears slip past his fingers.
He spots an Andorian relaxing at the counter, the numerous tags hanging off his jacket, and the roughened hands giving Tony a clue that the man is an engineer or a dealer. Either way, jackpot.
Plodding down the stairs, he finds himself in front of two large glass pane doors, beyond which is Tony and an array of technology that’s dizzying to Steve to think about. The doors open for him, and he finds himself standing in the midst of what looks like schematics hovering in the air without being propped up or sitting on a screen. Tony is at the center of it, his hands waving as he expands and contracts parts of the picture to examine whatever it is he wants to look at.
Tony’s arousal is fierce and comes on so fast that his cock stands out and points itself right in Steve’s face. Steve wastes no time at all swallowing Tony, tongue plastered flat to the underside of his cock. Tony can feel slick coursing down his legs, but Steve seems to ignore it.
Tony wrenched up Steve’s shirt, fists buried at the hems as he stripped Steve, leaving that beautiful chest exposed for Tony’s mouth. He immediately sucked at those gorgeous nipples, Steve tossing his head back with a groan. Reaching out, Steve grasped Tony’s wings again, drawing them around him as he rubbed into the marginal coverts. It sends shivers all over Tony’s body, and again he has that sensation of every pleasurable nerve ending being caressed and touched.
The wolf keeps staring at him, its eyes lit up under the gibbous moon, which has just come out to crest the top of the mountains.
“I’m guessing Clint has,” Steve surmised and James nodded. “Told me about something he regretted not ever being able to do but now he could.”
He went back to the living room where he found Sarah sipping her tea, Benni drawing, and Steve filling a glass with scotch. Sometimes when they kissed after an evening like this, Tony could taste the scotch in Steve’s kisses and he’d slowly gotten used to it. He sat down next to Steve, a hand resting on his thigh.
“Oh.” He felt a sudden rush of embarrassment but shook it off. Why should he have known that? “Alright then how about... Wait here.”
Clint plopped down in front of Tony on the floor to talk for a minute in the small sliver of moonlight.
Tony closed the door and lingered there for a moment. Pepper’s biggest worry was if he wanted to be with Steve and if he was happy. Not so long ago that had been completely different.
“Who the hell is he?” Bucky asked from the doorway. He was shirtless, in only his low-hanging sleep pants, his hair pulled into a messy bun, and he slowly made his way to the kitchen. Tony noticed the left arm covered in scarred, burned skin, but he made a conscious effort not to stare.
“Hit it,” he told him. Tony looked shocked. “Come on, you know you won’t hurt me. Just give it all you got, one good punch.” When he seemed reluctant, Steve looked around until he saw James’ own boxing equipment. He picked up a pair of punching mitts and slid them on. “Better? Now hit as hard as you can.” Finally, Tony obeyed and threw a punch. Steve watched closely, noted his stance, his motions and follow-through, his wrist position and finger placement. When the fist found the glove, Steve felt it but only barely.
Clint chuckled this time and then turned towards him as much as he could without jostling his leg. How he wished this thing would heal in the next few days. “Think you’ll sleep tonight?”
Slowly, Steve approached him. He was lying face down and snoring lightly, just in jeans and a t-shirt. He looked to be about the same age as Steve, give or take a year. Steve pushed his shoulder and he stirred but didn’t wake up, swatting a hand out at Steve as if to say
“For being there for me after they couldn’t be,” he said, referring to his parents who had died in a car accident when he was younger. “I’ll tell him. If for no one and nothing else then for you. Not right now though. He’s got enough going on worrying about Tony.”
If there was one thing he didn’t like was having to hit Steve despite his reassurance that Tony wouldn’t be able to hurt him. He didn't like the thought of it, the sound of his fist hitting something or how he knew what being hit looked like. That simple exercise unsettled him more than he cared to admit. Shooting was easier. Shooting was better.
,” he said, putting stress on the words rather than say anything too triggering. “I found you first. Got that
“You could have also just woken me. Or pulled me aside any time of the day,” Tony said softly, completely judgement free just saying words. “You know exactly where I am and it was you who told me not to isolate myself.” He moved to run his fingers through Steve’s soft hair. “Give in, Steve. I know you’re not tired and you hate sleeping, but do it for me,” he whispered.
“Then why?” he asked and looked at Dugan who was looking at him through the reflection in the mirror. “If there’s no use for me, why care?”
“Shhh! The show is starting. Today is a special!” Benni was very excited about his crime show even though Tony didn’t always like that he was interested in those kinds of stories but Sarah had told him to let Benni enjoy it and that was that.
“This is good,” Steve said, holding up one of the documents. They had to call in Vitaly because a lot of the information was written in Mandarin and, for a reason James could not fathom, Vitaly spoke Mandarin. At least he was finally less boring.
Steve poured his glass and then James’, putting the bottle down to lift his glass and James did the same. They clinked but didn’t officially toast, they didn’t feel there was anything to toast about in relation to the impending conversation.
When they’d finished dinner, James helped Clint upstairs and they made their way to the bathroom first. Clint had learned to not take bathing for granted and he wanted to be clean before he got into their bed.
Tony saw how different James looked when he was focused on Clint versus the times when he would smile politely but seem almost bored. Even though he had never been scared of Steve, Tony knew that Steve too looked cold and distant when he was working. Rationally it made sense but actually seeing James so soft and loving was something else entirely.
Most of the men he slept with were happy to be paid to keep their mouths shut and then kept them shut with a little threatening from Steve.
The grandfather clock in the living room announced that it was Benni’s bedtime and Tony excused himself and went looking for his brother. He was surprised to find him in bed already, reading a book by himself.
“I do. If you’re looking to move up, what better way than to kill your sexually deviant boss?” Sarah gave him a look but he was too upset to back down or retract his statement.
. He had to get up and be anywhere but right where he was. He felt like he needed to run but thankfully this time he remembered his broken leg and was much gentler about getting out of bed.
“You know, I’m more than a little disappointed to actually find you here,” he told him, sitting on the end of the bed.
“Of course. I will also ask her for the nicest thing she wants for her own new home and get her that. Maybe I’ll make you buy her a car in addition to that,’ he added with a small grin. “You did say you’d get me anything?” His voice was unnecessarily flirty just because he couldn’t take his thoughts at the moment and being flirty for Steve was much more fun.
Steve dropped his head, smiling too. He was glad Tony had not only formed his own opinion of him but one that differed so greatly from the norm. “I prefer to listen,” he said, feeling very candid. He wasn’t sure if it was all the alcohol still in his system or the special brand of happy that came from being in Tony’s presence, talking to him, but he just wanted to keep talking and then the early hour of the morning made itself known again. “I should let you sleep.”
“Edward, I’m hungry!” The man barked and staggered into the kitchen, nearly missing the chair as he sat down.
“Yes, it’s nice,” he answered. He hadn’t gotten too far because it was difficult to focus on only reading while there were so many things to worry about. “Did you read a lot growing up?”
“I’ll go,” Clint said, wanting just a little alone time with James first. He was comfortable with Tony and Sarah, Steve was still a pending relationship, and Benni was to be confirmed. “We can go after lunch.”
Tony moved to the windows and looked outside. For the first time in his life he admired the beauty of snow because here it was beautifully warm, no draft on his neck, the windows not letting in the cold either. He rested a hand against the window and watched people pass by unknowing of the beauty they couldn’t see behind these walls and windows. How they were missing out, Tony thought. He didn’t know how long he had been standing there watching the outside world but when he turned around Steve simply looked at him calmly and was that a smile? “How many of these books here have you read?” Tony asked and walked to the bookshelves. There were only a handful of books he had heard of. Most of the titles and authors meant nothing to him.
Clint focused on Lucky because he wasn’t quite ready to analyze everything he had told James just yet and he had assumed James would know what he meant.
“Oh,” Clint said quietly, startled when he saw Tony there on the couch, a small fire going. “Room for one more?”
He also thought about how difficult it would be to survive this situation all by himself again, should anything happen to Clint. It was a selfish reason, which made him feel bad, but now that he knew that it was easier with someone there to talk to he didn’t want to go back to being alone.
He had his good days and his bad days, as he always had, but naturally the bad days had become more frequent since James and Steve had brought them home. And since Tony and Steve had left for their vacation to Ireland, he had been especially sensitive.
Steve chuckled at Tony looking over his shoulder for Sarah and then nodded, sipping his coffee. “Sounds peaceful,” he said. “Good to have a peaceful person in your life.”
Steve hesitated, not sure where she was going with this and quite frankly, not liking it. He didn’t say anything, just kept his eyes focused on the wall in front of him, shutting down his face.
When he’d gotten the sandwiches earlier that month, he’d assumed it was an act on Howard’s behalf, trying to worm his way back into Steve’s good graces and he’d ignored it. He should’ve known it was Tony.
, I never got to thank you. This was your idea and now it’s really happened.” He tightened his grip around the cup of black coffee and stared into the dark liquid. Why was it so difficult to use his words sometimes? “You once told me that your number one priority is Steve and that you’re protecting your child.” After another short pause he managed to look up again into her eyes. “I just hope you know that he’s my number one too.”
“We’re dressed pretty snazzy for a nice meal at home. What aren’t you telling me, you gorgeous, gorgeous man,” Clint said, straightening his tie in the mirror in their bedroom. “I mean, a suit?”
To arrive and see Clint sitting there on the couch, struggling to catch his breath and red in the face stabbed James to his heart. He needed to do more for Clint.
By the time he got back home, Benni was returning from school. Jones picked him up everyday and walked him to Steve’s work where Steve then took him home. Steve’s home was not public knowledge. Some knew, most did not. There was a secret passage through the gym that led to his own basement. Dugan, James, Dmitri (James’ right hand man), Jones, Falsworth, Sarah, and now Benni knew about it.
And that was only the tip of Bakuto’s monstrous iceberg. A part of James and Steve wanted it to be Bakuto because better the devil you know than the one you don’t but it didn’t make the confirmation any easier because they knew exactly the type of person who was holding their beloveds captive and the thought of either of them having even a single finger laid on them—
Tony moved away to make space for them, unsure if Steve even wanted him there or not. Somehow the whole scene didn’t bother him but that was a thought for another time.
It's official - Tony and Benni are part of the family. Steve makes a last minute purchase thanks to a connection of James'. Steve and Tony finally get away on their holiday.
As soon as Tony was pressed against the wall by Steve he forgot about everything else while Steve got rid of their clothes very quickly. Every now and then he looked at Tony for permission before getting rid of his underwear or touching him and everytime Tony couldn’t do more than nod, which was more than enough for Steve. Soon they were on the Steve’s bed, both completely naked, Steve’s lips all over Tony’s body and Tony’s hands all over Steve’s. He felt all kinds of scars, tracing each one carefully until he touched one that made Steve wince.
One hand resting in Steve’s big, strong hand, the other still holding on to Clint—this was ideal and put Tony at ease, the tension in his body falling away. He heard Benni coming down the stairs, practicing Irish with Sarah. He was absolutely delighted to see everyone in the same room. Sarah gently pulled him into the kitchen and Tony waved to his brother with the hand still in Steve’s.
The only reason they had these meetings was to keep them all in place, remind them that they could all coexist and still come out on top, none of them shared except Russian and Irish but that was a choice. They all had their own neighborhoods and had enough turf to cover and work to do.
Steve watched him. A part of him felt bad and another part had to bite back a smile at his frustrated and dramatic little fella.
Tony flipped over, his eyes immediately sweeping up and down the paragon of perfect physiques that belonged to Steve Rogers. He made a vague gesture to all of Steve.
Steve stopped and Callahan winced, expecting another blow but Steve just stood there, arms crossed, staring at him. “I do now? Then, tell me, did you get confused? Did you… think they didn’t apply to you? Did you just not give a fuck?” Steve laughed.
Tony turned around to Steve, his eyes wandering over his muscular arms. “The library. Though the room downstairs is also amazing. Everything here is.”
The man clicked the missed calls icon and the call connected. He put it to his ear but not until after Steve had seen the name and his eyebrows shot up.
“I love you two,” she said as they took the last step onto the landing. She looked up at Steve and then up at James. “I know it’s been hard.” Steve’s gaze fell and James swallowed. “But soon you’ll have ‘em back. And despite what you two might be thinking, they’re lucky to have you.”
He cracked his neck and looked up at her. The hands on her hips swung forward to hold her son’s face and she bent down and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
“He’s a strong one alright.” Steve agreed. She put the bag of food on his desk and he opened it up to see the cottage hand pies from the place down the way. They were the best in the neighborhood but Steve didn’t often get out to pick some up. Sarah had a second bag for Tony. “How’s he doing?”
Immediately, even before menus were offered, a bottle of Dom Perignon was brought over and poured into champagne flutes for everyone at the table.
“Your stupid boyfriend jumped in front of a bomb for me,” Rhodey said and Tony laughed but it was wet and strained. He felt the tears welling up in his eyes. He knew that Steve was just generally a selfless person but he also knew Steve had done what he did for Tony as well. He knew Tony couldn’t live without Rhodey.
“Cap, he’s here,” he called out over the sound of a punch. Steve turned and saw him and sucked in a sharp, furious breath. Falsworth swung at him, about to remind him of the importance of not letting anything distract you, when Steve turned and caught the fist in a hand. Falsworth’s face was the equivalent of ‘uh-oh’ and Dugan just laughed and kept eating.
“Oh hello.” Tony smiled and hugged his brother. The boy was absolutely delighted to have most of his favorite people in one room together. While he talked to the other three, Tony went to Sarah and she hugged him immediately. He hugged her back and enjoyed the familiar warmth. Their Steve was alright.
That evening after dinner Steve went to his study and something about the way he looked at Tony, told him to follow and so he did. Sarah didn’t seem to need an excuse why Tony wouldn’t help with the dishes and frankly he was grateful because he wouldn’t have known what to tell her.
“I don’t want to bother him on his holiday. He deserves peace,” Clint had said and as much as James agreed, Clint deserved peace too. But he didn’t press. He just suggested something else that Clint turned down but at least he didn’t seem as irritated about it.
Maybe he should tell him why they found it easier to sleep like this? After a few seconds of contemplation, he decided against it. No, he wasn’t ready yet.
Clint was looking down at Tony, smiling. He was torn, happy to be going home but sad to be leaving. Clint had never wanted a younger brother and definitely never thought he would like one if he got one but he most certainly liked Tony.
Steve gave Tony a squeeze and then gently pulled away, caressing his cheek as he passed him to go over and inspect the food and see what was on offer for tonight. Sarah swatted him away but pressed up on her tiptoes to kiss her son’s cheek.
Steve dismissed the maid who was assigned to help them put away their luggage and ready the room. He then told her that her services will only be required when requested and that she should not under any circumstance bother them otherwise. It had been made clear to the staff just who exactly Steve was so she nodded without another word and left them to it.
“Sadly too true.” James turned to look at Steve, see the concern in his eyes and features, the way he held his jaw tight. “What is it?”
“I haven’t given it that much thought, to be honest. First, I had to heal and then I started working for you. And now I simply take one day after the other.” He looked down to Steve’s hand on the pillow. He was sure it would be more comfortable where Tony’s hands were. “I’m open to suggestions.”
“Don’t do it again, alright? I told you before and I’ll tell you again: I have no problem chaining you to this bed,” he said with a small smile. “I’d rather not have to do that.” His voice was softer that time.
Steve waited, completely silent, hoping Falsworth would assume he’d bled out or was otherwise too injured to respond or move. He counted to twenty and then kicked open the other door, closing an eye as he aimed up at the window and he heard a yelp. The gun moved out of the window. He wasn’t sure what he had hit exactly but it was good enough that he could get out of the car.
“Why don’t we finish up so we can all eat? Ready to get back to work, pet?” Sarah asked Benni, turning towards the kitchen.
“You gave him your tags?” Steve nodded. “And he left them behind as proof.” Steve nodded again. “Smart boy.”
Tony jumped back, not knowing what to expect when Clint startled. He didn’t want to risk more physical pain than he was already in. Instead he crouched down, taking a second because his head was spinning from the sudden movement, and pushed the tray towards Clint.
Steve! All these thoughts flooded Tony the moment he was coming to. He sat up quickly, immediately regretting it.
“Yes, sir.” Steve circled him as he spoke and every time he passed behind the man, Callahan tensed up.
James let out a soft sigh, turning to look at Steve and Steve saw the dread in his expression, the worry. “I don’t know,” James said after a long drawn out silence. He didn’t. He had no way of knowing and he wasn’t going to give either himself or Steve the false hope that they were.
James took a sip of his drink and looked at Steve. “The short version, Steve is my best friend. I care about him, he cares about you, so by default I now do too.” It was also a partial lie but James wasn’t sure how much he should tell Tony. He looked at Steve who nodded after a moment. “Long version?”
Saturday unless scheduling ahead of time when to see each other is a part of your dating process,” Tony teased, relieved when Steve laughed.
Then James asked Clint if he would consider allowing Alexei or Vitaly to accompany him and just keep an eye out but he had turned that down as well, actually arguing with James. Clint appreciated the concern and, again, he understood the danger but he did not want to be babysat. He was a grown ass man who had survived World War Two, he was pretty sure he could handle a few goons coming in to try and rough him up.
Before Pepper could react, Tony was out of the kitchen heading to the library and flipping through the collection of records. Should he ask Steve? Surely he wouldn’t mind, right? Not like they were going to need it if they were going on holiday soon. Just to be on the safe side, he headed to Steve.
Clint watched him carefully, trying to read his lips but he was mumbling slightly. Clint formed his lips the way he had seen him do it, trying to figure out the name. “Tony?” he repeated, tentatively. “Why are you in here?”
He could smell dust and dirt and metal when he really focused. He removed his other hearing aid and turned it off for the moment to really focus on smell. He couldn’t detect much more but it at least tipped him off to the fact that he was probably in an old warehouse, maybe an abandoned factory.
Sarah sighed, the thought of that man making her blood boil. Steve tilted his head to the side. “Did you need anything, ma? I’d rather not bore you with the details.”
“Right. How about you eat your dinner and go to bed,” Tony suggested and shook his head. What a disgrace his father was. He went to close the kitchen window, not wanting to disturb anyone more than they usually did. Once the window was closed Tony turned around and Howard was standing behind him. He hadn’t heard him get back up.
He shook his head, turning his attention to Tony as he completely removed his tie, jacket and waistcoat.
“Of course.” He nodded and put his coat on, getting ready to head out. “Guess I’ll see you tomorrow.” He said to Steve and nodded to James with a small smile. It was still difficult for Tony to know where exactly he was with him but James must have been fine with him. “Good night,” he wished them on his way out.
“His guardian, whoever they may be, will never give you permission, and you know that’s required before you make the attempt.”
“I brought lasagna. Your mom’s recipe.” Steve holds up the bag like a prize, his face like a rising sun, and Tony’s world immediately brightens. Always considerate, Steve sets up Tony’s lunch for him, and as Tony waits until Steve is finished, he thinks about how good his life is. Just as Steve opens the top off the steaming container of food and makes to sit down, Tony grabs at Steve’s belt and tugs. The movement spins Tony’s chair to face Steve, and Tony presses his face bodily into Steve’s belly, his arms slumping around Steve’s hips.
“No fisticuffs with journalists Tony. Not even verbal. Don’t give them a reason.” Like they needed one. The press hounded him, especially about how his supposed Omegan tendencies made him unqualified to run a company. They didn’t come out and say it anymore, most days. But given the chance, they’d be picking through his garbage like trash pandas, looking for slick-stained sheets and heat-toys. Things Tony took great legal care to burn when he had to go off suppressants for his very lonely heats.
Steve’s hips are snapping against Tony’s as he grinds his cock down onto Tony’s ample ass. He can’t wait to pull Tony’s pants off, have that gorgeous mound of flesh exposed to his ministrations. He’s going to lick every inch of Tony he gets his hands on, see if his slick tastes as good as his gland. It’s probably better than.
“JARVIS, give some Black Sabbath and make it loud.” Thinking about this is going to give him hives, he just knows it.
“Yes, I can see that you’ve given it some amount of effort. You’re a good cook, at least. Look, there’s a credit card on the counter up there. Go find me nice soft things. Tomorrow is the charity gala you said you’d attend with me.” Steve’s heart skips a beat as he thinks about getting pillows and blankets for Tony’s nest. Will Tony like what he picks out?
He walks up the steps to the entrance, his hand trailing along the handrail as he does. He pushes the doors open and walks up until he’s standing in front of Steve’s old apartment door. Another letter and a StarkBox lock hang from the doorknob.
“Look, I’ll be honest with you too, since we’re friends, but you seem to have this opinion of omegas where they’re inferior to you. How can your omega want to be with you as an equal if you can never see him that way?” Steve had never thought of it that way before, but he realizes that Iron Man is right. He’s always seen Tony as someone who needed caring for, but not someone who can be responsible for the caring of himself. He’s questioned Tony’s decisions, his life, everything about him. It isn’t possible to easily apologize for that. For woefully underestimating and undervaluing someone’s faculties.
“Alex got me off of a family friend who was supposed to take care of me. My parents thought that he would be there for me, as we’d known his family for years. But when he got into some bad debt, he traded me off to Alex. My parents could do nothing. I could do nothing. I have a hard time thinking of what Alex did to me as rape. Not like Trevor. He—he was kind to me. Built me nice nests, was with me through all of my heats, bathed me, and fed me. But I was just an object to him. He would tell me that I was cherished, loved. But I existed in this narrow space for him.”
Steve is silent. He’s been quieter since the accident. Maybe he’s punishing Tony. Maybe he’s teaching him.
It’s not until Tony is standing in his apartment, hazily taking in his surroundings, that Steve realizes this is real. This is happening, now. He swells with fierce desire, trembling as he lays hands on Tony’s narrow hips.
There’s something about it though, where he feels like he’s a part of it somehow. Like he’s right in the center of it in a way that the other Avengers are not.
When Rhodey goes stiff and the bots start to move into position, he knows he has to lead them away from the crowd. Vanko is likely to try and cause as much chaos as possible, to prove… what? That the government should buy his tech or that local warlords should? Tony’s certain it’s the latter, as spanking a government weapons contractor in public is frowned upon in certain circles, and downright kinky in others.
“Yes,” he grits out and begins the too-long trek to where Tony is. The conversation with Nat has lit him afire with worry and fear over Tony’s behavior as of late. He has to find out what’s going on. Whether Tony has started to stabilize his hormones and what that means for Steve. It makes his chest tight and his stomach knot to think about how close he’s come and how it’s all teetering precariously on Tony’s and Nat’s cooperation. All of which he thought he either had or avoided needing via subterfuge. Now everything is blown open, and it’s rotten inside.
“Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.” The unspoken message being, get the fuck out. Yesterday.
“About that. After New York, we can’t give you any more without you going on a scheduled heat, and since I don’t trust you to do so on your own time, I insist you use our heat service.” Fury unlaces his hands and opens a drawer that Tony can’t see, but presumably contains scent bags, since the one-eyed wonder starts pulling plastic baggies of cloth onto his desk.
He does not like what he finds anymore than he did at first glance. There’s so much media showing Tony in compromising positions, so much gossip, and speculation. If even half of it is true, Tony is completely feral. Steve knows this is what happens when you let an omega have their way. They get into trouble. They get taken advantage of.
There are people who are alive and well again after all this time, and the tower is celebratory in mood, even with low food supplies and clean clothing. They know from there it’s going to be alright. It may take years to clear the planet, but they will do it.
“No, you aren’t made for this. But you will be. I’ll help you.” Steve cups his cheek, Tony’s beard bristling his hand, and leans down for a kiss. Tony is responsive, lips parting and letting Steve take control of the most searing and maddening kiss that Steve has ever had.
Tony’s a shivering mess underneath him, and he’s staring at Steve like he doesn’t know him, like this is the first time he’s seeing him. It agitates Steve, but the sooner Tony understands how this is going to go, who Steve really is, the better things will get.
It takes them no time at all to drive the slime to where they want to go. It doesn’t like being physically hit with anything, and it especially doesn’t like the repulsor blasts from Iron Man.
“I ended up in South Williamsburg. Not far enough away from Conall, not really. But he never came looking. I lucked out there. Some of the other girls not so much. The church provided everything for us, which wasn’t much, but it was ours. I took up work as a seamstress, and eventually, I became the head of the group that housed us omegas. Some of them got out of much worse situations than myself. Sometimes–sometimes we couldn’t get them away completely. They’d come to us broken, too broken. And those times… We did what we could. There were no laws to protect us and no repercussions for using corporal punishment on omegas. Say, hey, have you seen that new bill that they’re going to ban the use of any physical punishment on omegas? Why I never thought I’d see the day. About time too. Now well, there are hardly any alphas that spank anymore, but there’s a few out there. That’ll take care of that.” Edith visibly shudders.
“Whipped cream,” Clint said at the same time that James answered, tasting Tony’s food, “Vanilla sauce.” They turned to look at each other but didn’t get to start bickering playfully because they were interrupted.
“So, he’s safe?” Tony mumbled and forced his eyes open again to watch Winter answer him. He was as unreadable to Tony as Mr Rogers but he still wanted to see his face when he answered.
“We kill him and one of you will be mayor,” James said casually, gesturing between Dugan and Dmitri. Steve leveled him with a look. They didn’t need a dead mayor on top of everything else. “If he doesn’t know anything, well, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”
“Come here,” he said, gesturing for Tony to come around his desk to where he was. When he did, Steve looked him up and down, reaching out but deciding against it last minute. “Turn around.” Again Tony complied and then Steve told him to sit, his scowl deeper than before.
He stepped out, his hat tipped to obscure part of his face and then immediately the umbrella was over his head, Dugan at his side as always.
Clint looked around as much as he could, still struggling and spouting nonsense, not able to hear the men telling him to shut up. He was pulled into another room. It was larger than his and Tony’s with wide windows and Clint could see the world outside. They were in some kind of office space. It seemed abandoned and Clint could still see water. The East river, he assumed.
Clint sat back. He had been afraid of that response. He could understand being hesitant but it still frustrated him, though he did his best not to show it.
“Maybe,” he said, the word coming out like it hurt. “I mean…” He swallowed hard, his throat dry and eyes wet. “He’s the last person I’ve ever wanted to hurt but I
“I think I fell asleep on your mom.” He was clearly embarrassed but there was only so much he could do about it now. His stomach growled and Benni laughed.
did I not make clear to you?” He was walking Tony towards the sleeping area, a small room lined with single beds for the times when they or the other shift had to stay overnight or simply needed a nap.
Steve wanted to be his only one which meant that they had all the time in the world. Or as long as they had until something major happened again. That thought came out of nowhere and scared Tony more than he expected.
“Come on, let’s move to the couch,” he said softly, pulling away but resting his hands on his shoulders.
Steve nodded and added another, following the same procedure of asking Tony after each finger and Tony would look a little surprised but confirm he was good to go. Steve stopped at three and gradually things got a little easier and Tony looked a lot more comfortable.
He was still holding the Patek in one hand and the Rolex in the other. He wasn’t concerned with how often Clint would wear them because money really was no object for James. The only thing concerning him was whether or not Clint would actually like it. Clint was a little difficult to buy truly meaningful gifts for because he was so easily pleased. James felt the slightest bit ungrateful thinking about how easy it was to make his fella happy but at the same time, he wished there was something Clint had mentioned in the last few weeks that he really wanted.
At first his tears fell silently, which he was grateful for because he felt ashamed for crying. But then breathing became more difficult the more he cried and it ended in full on sobs and him hiding his face in her shoulder as he did.
The two of them got up after a few minutes to get everything ready so the others wouldn’t have to lift a finger. One last time before they left for their vacation. That thought made him smile.
On Thursday Steve was so wound up at the idea of what he might be about to see that he did not want lunch. He told Dugan to order for himself and then send Tony down to the basement where his boxing ring was. Steve stood in the ring facing Falsworth who was a very accomplished fighter.
kitchen but in the end, what good would that actually do him? On the way up the stairs he was met with Tony who was coming out of his room.
He gave Tony a soft smile. “In about a month. I’ve just got a few things to go over with Dugan now that he’s back from his honeymoon and I’d like it to warm up there a wee bit more but then we’re off.” The last thing he wanted was for Tony to arrive somewhere that should be peaceful and beautiful and only notice the cold. Ireland would never have New York summers—thank god—but at least twenty degrees Celsius would be nice.
James looked up at Steve and then over at Bakuto who was bleeding all over the concrete floor from where he sat tied up in a metal chair. They were keeping him in the same place they had kept Howard, the abandoned fifth floor in James’ hospital that he had converted into his own interrogation ward. No one who came to the fifth floor as a captive ever left alive and the same fate would befall Bakuto. Unfortunately, he was still useful.
Tony nodded. He was more of a listener than someone who asked questions or shared without being asked. Usually he spoke to Benni, who had a lot of stories to tell about the things he experienced every day. Sarah and he enjoyed companionable silence. Every now and then she would tell a story or sing a song. It was very peaceful. With Steve it was always different. Sometimes they read to each other from their books, sometimes Steve sketched while Tony watched him. Sometimes they talked about a movie, a song, or things they wanted to do.
She patted his shin and stood. “Why don’t you have a kip, I’ll bring you tea and biscuits in an hour so you don’t sleep the day away, hm?” He nodded, already beginning to drift and when he laid down, she insisted on tucking him in. Sarah tucked in her mob boss son and she didn’t think any less of him for letting his mother do it nor did he protest. Sometimes he just needed his ma.
Tony gently rested a hand on the back of Steve’s hand, his thumb rubbing over the bruised knuckles. “Still…” he mumbled. Steve was strong enough to take care of himself but Tony couldn’t help it. “You’re with me now. I worry about those I love.”
Steve dropped his head, stared at his hands in his lap. His stomach churned anxiously at the thought of everything Tony might be going through. “I worry about Tony getting enough sleep. It’s taken almost a year to get him to sleep six hours a night. I doubt he’s closing his eyes at all now.”
“So you’re going to give us the key to your Brooklyn mansion to house sit while you’re away and the only downside is sharing it with Dmitri which isn’t even a downside,” Natalia summarized.
“No, we would stay here. You and me. For a while. If that’s something you both would want,” James clarified, his gaze focused on Clint, watching for any subtle nuances in his expression.
Tony, who had only ever heard Clint whisper or speak softly, was surprised at how loud he could get. His eyes were fixed on the door for a minute and then another.
“Just the usuals—new paint jobs, one guy has a 1967 Shelby cobra he wants to bring in for a full resto, and there are four other interior revamps lined up.”
In the kitchen, the smell was heavenly. Sarah was at the stove, putting the finishing touches of melted butter over some rosemary potatoes. She sat them on the long, mahogany table along with the roasted chicken, homemade rolls, corn, asparagus, and gravy.
“Once you’ve put enough time between yourself and it, it’ll pop into your dreams and your head less often. And when you do see it, it won’t be as intense,” he told him slowly, measuring Tony’s expressions. “I haven’t forgotten my first but even when I’m reminded, it’s tolerable. Now.” His voice went impossibly softer. “But the difference between me and you and dealing with this is that you’ve got all of us here to help and most of us know what you’re feeling—me, Dugan and the fellas, and James w-when he’s back,” he added, tripping over his words slightly as he added it but it was no less sincere.
“Clint, I love this place. And you are one of my dearest friends. Of course I’ll look after it.” Phil told him, resting a hand on his shoulder. “You deserve a nice break.”
“Yeah, I didn’t think it would happen overnight and I’d picked up that me seeing James wasn’t his favorite thing in the world.” He sighed deeply, still picking at the roll but not eating it. Right now he even missed the way James got annoyed when he drank straight from the milk bottle. “Never thought a mob boss would be the person I get butterflies over. Not complaining, just didn’t see it coming.”
He kept himself awake until he heard Steve’s breathing evening out. That was when he let himself fall asleep. For the first time since he had been back he was sleeping more calmly than the nights before. He still had nightmares and felt anxious when he woke up in total darkness, but he always managed to go back to hugging Steve.
So far nothing had screamed Tony to him but he was still looking and he knew of a few places in and around Belfast that he could also check if he found nothing in New York. He was determined to find the right one though and nothing could stop Steve Rogers from accomplishing whatever he put his mind to.
Bucky took it and flipped through while Steve took his time to look around now. The inside was scorched, booths melted, and the rest utterly unrecognizable. Steve felt for the people who owned this diner. This was probably their bread and butter and now whatever they had earned from it would go into restoring it or doing something else.
“Yes, good help is hard to come by these days and I’ve seen the way you clean the dishes,” Steve teased back. “But after so long on the boat, I wouldn’t mind just a little time at the cottage. We’ll probably stop to pick up some groceries first.”
He laid back down, pulling Steve with him as he went so that they could go back to a more comfortable position. “How can you ask me to marry you and still worry whether I’m sure all in one day?” He pressed a gentle kiss on the top of Steve’s head.
Around noon he arrived at the address that he was given. Two men were standing outside the bar in front of the door, having a smoke and at first Tony didn’t think they had anything to do with where he was going. That was until he reached the door and they stood right in front of him, making him flinch at the sudden movement.
Steve was still grinning, somewhat proud of having made himself understood. He just hoped he wasn’t butchering the accent too much.
“I tell ma they’ve been disrespecting me and stick ‘em in a room with her. That’s worse than anything I could do to ‘em.” He smiled, half of his mouth pulling up. He looked up at Tony. Steve wasn’t sure he wanted to leave the house but he would if Tony wanted to—oh wait, he already had plans with Pepper, he remembered, looking back down. “What are you and Pepper up to today?”
He remembered sitting on his bedroom floor with the box in front of him, the money neatly put in small piles. $26.38. That had been all his money in the world. When he hadn’t eaten properly in days, while his brother was shivering from the cold.
He hoped Tony was alright seeing as Clint had just left without even saying goodbye and wasn’t even planning to come back tonight. He did want to go tomorrow. At least, that’s how he felt at the moment. That could change after spending the night in his own bed with James. But it wasn’t like they wouldn’t be together at Steve’s.
“Well, that’s too bad. They’re not complicated instructions. Sadly for you, I can’t work with someone this goddamn thick.” With a speed that made Falsworth startle, Steve pulled his gun from the holster and held it to Callahan’s head.
James matched eyes with Steve for a brief moment, another silent understanding between them. Steve’s arm around Tony tightened the smallest bit, protective.
It was rushed and chaotic and very them. The news had just broken that the US would join the war efforts and Clint knew it was only a matter of time before he was drafted and he wanted somewhere—
Steve turned to Tony, reaching out for his gun and sliding it into the holster he wore. He put a hand on his shoulder and leaned down to ask, “Would you mind riding home with Dugan? I’ve just got some business to attend to with James.”
Steve pulled back enough to put both hands on Tony’s upper arms, wrapping a hand around them. He was a thin boy but wiry, there was muscle there not just skin and bone, but it was definitely an area that could be improved and would also help with his shooting skills.
“And we get that,” Steve told him. “There’s things we can’t understand but the two of you can. If it helps, we’re happy.”
The plan was to keep things running smoothly so as to not let anyone know that James was gone in the first place. Luckily for James, he was very rarely in the public eye anyway except for Clint’s bar and even there he always entered through the back and sat out of view, so his presence would be slightly easier to fake than Steve’s.
James shook his head. “I know a place. Good drinks, decent amount of privacy. We can come in through the back.”
“Simply put, I want everything,” he said, his fun, casual tone disappearing, replaced by something more menacing. “And I’m not above hurting your precious heathens to get what I want.”
He chewed his lip so long it bled a little, thinking, and then he turned to Tony, eyes on him for the first time that night. First time in a long while, actually. “Don’t you think I’m disgusting? An abomination?”
“Here we are,” the man said, knocking on an unmarked white door at the back of the room. Steve had given Dugan a look when they’d passed all those cases and not stopped at even one of them.
Steve dropped his head but never raised his arms to touch Tony. They stayed on his legs because he would not take advantage of Tony trying to comfort him.
Instead he settled for what he had because Tony seemed comfortable with that. To push his own agenda—especially in a moment like this—would just be vile, a terribly selfish thing. He wasn’t sure if he should continue talking. Maybe it was helping but it didn’t seem to be.
“Always so dramatic,” James laughed, shaking his head. “I don’t have long today. There’s business I need to attend to, so talk.”
Once the other two had left the room, Dmitri closed the door and came over to sit in front of James.
“Rhodey! James! Rhodes!” Tony called the next morning. Steve had left around midnight and Tony was pleasantly surprised to find that Rhodey still wasn’t home. Good, he needed a win on the dating front.
But there was a bigger part of him that knew his feelings were clear and that he was in love with Tony. Had been for a while. And while that part knew for a certainty how Steve felt, it made his chest ache to think that Tony may never return his feelings, may never even know he had them.
“Rest your head,” he told him, gently guiding it back down onto his shoulder and then taking his hand. “Since I’ve been back, I only take these out to shower. The silence is… too much.” He sighed again and carried on. “It’ll make him feel better if you talk to him, though. We both know that. For now you can talk to me. If you want.” He squeezed Tony’s hand lightly.
you shot him point blank at Stark’s old deli?” James countered. “Move on from this part of the issue so we can figure this out together or leave.”
“I know we didn’t hug but thanking me is just you being ridiculous,” he told him, turning to the car that was waiting for Steve. Steve had lied to Tony. He told him he was coming home tomorrow and he had Dugan and Sarah keep him busy for the morning while Jones slipped out to pick him up.
