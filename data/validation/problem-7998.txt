"It's different, Steve. You are my best friend since the day one and Sam is the love of my life, I want we are living together" Bucky pleaded
"Don't worry, Steve, I won't do anything stupid"
Steve nodded "don't tell him, I go"
"Steve? What are you doing? Stand up, please" He shocked but Steve didn't listen him "Tony, I know what I did was wrong and I don't know what I have to do to get your apologize, you ignored my text and my call and because you know I was there, you don't even show up when The Avengers assembles and I know it was my fault, I ruined everything, I ruined the team, I'm sorry, Tony"
"Turn around and walk to the bench" He ordering and Steve turn around his eyes widened when he saw those tools "no more, please" he begs but Tony ignored him "take it or I won't forgive you" he threatened him.
They all nodded agree before they continue to watch the movies,
"Um, what are you doing there?" Tony asked to Rhodey.
“He was trying to not cry when he came to my house, I was glad my dad can take care of him when Steve came. My dad will wrapped him a new bandage around his back. His dad will not only whipped his bottom, but will on his back with his old belt”
"And what about me being Cap and the Avenger?"
"Until I can find out how turn you back to your size, we're not together but still I'm keep on eye to you"
"I hate you, Rogers" He told to himself as he wipe his tears "Fuck it"
“From now, I can be your star so I wanted to make sure that whenever she feels lonely she can look up at the sky and no matter where I am you can know that I’m looking down for you” He said sound sincerely making me disbelief.
"Yeah, I ever caught his father hit her with a pot full of boiling soup because he thought She was keeping Steve from him and when he found him, his father hit him too till his face covered with his blood. His mother stood up and got angry, which leaving his father leaving them. Since that night, he was responsible, and I guess now I've been failed him many times."
"Now, come here, I'm put some lotion on your bum"
"What?!"
It's been few months after Sokovia battle between team Cap and team Iron Man and since then the relationship between Steve and Tony been faded. Tony ignoring his call, his text and everything. It's feel like he got mad with him and won't forgive him no matter how much Steve begging on him. Tony never feel so betrayed like this before especially from your own friends. Meanwhile, Steve is trying to get apologize from him. He already tried everything to make him forgive him. One day, he decide to show up in his house.
Tony just ignored him and Steve threw his hands to cover his bottom and Tony instantly removed his hand and pinned it behind his back and when Tony thought Steve had enough, Tony stopped and put the hairbrush away.
Before Tony can respond to him, Steve decides to look around the lab as he looks at the weapon that Tony currently worked on.
Steve leaned against his chest “thank you, Tony. I love you”
Both Bucky and Tony frowned hearing that.
“Why he suddenly looking after me?” He ask looking at Finn who shrugged “I don’t want to go back now, I don’t want him around me from now”
After giving the paint, Peter immediately run into his father as Tony pick him up. He wondering what Steve want to talk with Bucky. He looking at Peter who is sleeping now and decide to put him on his room and lay him down on the bed.
"Firstly, it's sir for you. Secondly, don't you want Stark to go back with you and thirdly if I can't have Barnes as my property now I do have you for the exchange"
"Come on, Steve! Pick your phone" Tony thought to himself.
“Hush” Tony pulled his penis “just write”
“Wow, okay”
I start to tell him everything about what happened, every time I’m about to cry, he hold my hand and after tell him everything,
"But what about you? I mean, I won't something happen with you while you way to hospital"
“I’m done” He said.
"No, why would he with me?"
Tony couldn’t stop thinking over this. Steve has crush on him and will do anything for him and meanwhile Tony also has feeling towards him but how. How he could tell him after what he had done yesterday? The man seems scared of him just because of his lack worried.
“Steve, baby”
After Steve make sure Finn leaving his apartment, he looking around to grab his suit and one of his helmet, he grab his phone to call someone.
“No, I’m not crying. This just something on my eyes”
“I would like to but I don’t want teams around and found us doing this” Steve said.
Once they arrived at their room, Tony instantly dragged Steve into his lap.
Tony? I miss you so much, Tony.
Steve letting out his sobs as he didn't know what to do "please, I'm sorry!"
“Yeah, once he told me after you guys meet each other during battle with Loki, he won’t stop talking about you. He asked me if I could teach him how to use computer so he can know lot about you and then that our fights few months ago happened, it’s really crushing on him since he absolutely won’t do this. He was in the hard choice. He want to on your side, but he feel like he will betrayed on me and when he decide on my side over you, he told me, it was because I was there during his childhood and helped him run off from his evil father nothing else and once he knew I’m killed your father, he ugh he went hard on me. He almost killed me as well and won’t do that because I’m his best friend. When you decided to take his shield, he said to me ‘I rather to lose my ugly weapon than I have losing him’ well he really adored you beside you are Howard’s son”
“Missed you,” he whispers after a moment, and Tony shuffles impossibly closer.
my meeting?”
“Congratulations.”
Steve doesn’t even glance in his direction, merely continues punching the bag, and Tony sighs. “I’m sorry. I just… I needed someone to help me sort my thoughts.”
It’s been a little over two weeks since Tony left. Each day has gotten harder to deal with. Steve hates that this time apart has been more unbearable than any other time Tony’s been gone. Steve isn’t sure if it’s the hormones or something else; all he knows is he’s grateful that he’ll only have this last night alone, and then Tony will be home.
"He's right," Steve cuts in quickly. "I'd rather cut off my own leg than jeopardize our friendship, okay? Nothing has to change. Nothing has to change quickly, or ever at all. I really, really mean that, Buck."
"It's fine." Tony waves it away with his free hand.
*********************
But Steve's going to see this through, now, so he just crosses his arms and clenches his jaw and keeps a glare honed on Tony's face while they listen to it ring and ring.
"Now wait just a minute," Steve says, finally giving up on wrapping his head around the entire situation and focusing on the immediate future. "No one is going anywhere."
"Fair," says Bucky. "Glad we understand each other."
"I was going to say," Steve says, "that I have plans tonight."
"Well," Bucky says, stepping away from Steve and leaving him feeling cold, looking around at the remains of dinner and the open bottle of wine on the table by the couch. "Guess I should leave you guys to it. I'll be -"
"Also," Tony says speculatively, "do we really think he'd cheat with someone?"
"Oh. Right," Steve says, because he managed to forget for like a whole two hours that he's got a Skype call with Bucky tonight.
He doesn't even get his phone back in his pocket before there's a reply.
"Yes," Steve says firmly, and Tony seems taken aback for a moment but then pleased. "Definitely a relationship. And I'm with you one hundred percent: you are my priority, and if we were all together then you'd both be my priority." And you and Bucky would be each other's priorities, Steve thinks, still dizzy with yearning for how good they would be for each other.
Tony's face breaks into a grin. "I can't wait to see you again either. Maybe, um, with the kissing thing? Maybe next time, yeah?"
"Good. So, is that - are we officially agreeing we'd like to talk to Bucky about the possibility of all of us entering a long-term relationship?"
Steve needs him in the first place?
"It got anything to do with this amazingly long story you're going to tell me?"
like to sleep with you. But. The other stuff, too."
So he starts taking the stairs (even though it makes him pant for ten minutes after) and avoids the sandwich shop like the plague (even though that means he has to start cooking his lunches the night before). All in all, he does reasonably well.
Yep, that'd be the possibly relevant information Steve neglected to share with Tony.
"Oh," says Tony. "Yeah, I should, too, I um. Might have run out on something kind of important. But! Okay. Worth it. So." He visibly stops himself from talking, takes a deep breath, and says, "I'll talk to you later?"
Steve sighs. "Look, I heard you, okay? I heard you."
"I'm not made of glass," Steve says quietly. "I can take care of myself. I don't need anyone to put me on a shelf with the excuse of my fragility and their own heroism and desire to take care of me. I don't need that, Tony."
As one, the team lowers their weapons, though none of them relax fully. The woman ー Fate, evidently ー takes a seat in the armchair Bruce vacated, brushing a lock of hair, the colour of sunshine, from her rosy cheeks. Now that he's not on high-alert, Steve can see the lines in her face, gathered at the corners of her eyes and lips, grooves in the surface of her forehead. There's an ancient knowledge in her eyes, a vivid amethyst, that speaks of millennia of experience set beneath delicate brows. Her thick, dark lashes fan her cheeks when she blinks, slow and graceful even in that small motion. The others follow suit, sitting with cautious movements though she gives them no more reason to be so wary apart from her still unexplained presence. She gives them all a faint smile.
“I wanted to give you plausible deniability,” he answers, though it comes out as more of a question.
Peter whines when Steve shakes him awake, but his sleepiness disappears when he's told that Happy is here to take him to his mom's. The child scrabbles his way out of his blankets ー and really, how can such a small child make such a mess of the bedsheets? ー and hurries out of the room. Steve closes his eyes, just for a moment, when he hears the delighted shriek of Happy's name, then he stands and heads to the dresser. Once he has a pair of jeans and a t-shirt pulled out, he sets them on the rocking chair in the corner.
“Sorry. That was the last time, I swear.”
He’s lounging on the sofa, his feet in Coulson’s lap, while
“Oh, my God.” All thoughts of exhaustion gone, Tony sits up, keeping his hand firmly against the curve of Steve’s stomach. “She… Isn’t it too early for that, though? The baby books said you probably wouldn’t feel anything for a few weeks still.”
“You’re
that sounds far too deafening for how quiet it is. Steve gazes around the apartment ー
“Hi.”
Now Steve is fourteen and Tony is barely fifteen and it’s been nine years since they first met, and no one knows about their dreams. Steve doesn’t ask if Tony’s ever told his parents; they don’t talk about their lives outside of the dreams much. It keeps Tony from being so angry and jaded for being so damn young, and all Steve wants, has ever wanted, is for Tony to be happy. Or, at least, as close to happy as is possible for the younger boy.
“Clint.”
Tony levels Natasha with a withering look. “Of course not. That would be stupid.”
“Steve, please listen to me. You
“He has been caught?”
“How does this work? Like, do we do a dance naked in the middle of a blossoming field under the first full moon of the harvest season? What?”
He doesn't glance up at the sound of repulsors whining to life, the
“Oh, Steve, wait.” Tony fumbles in his pocket, pulling out a small brass key. “So you can get him to bed instead of him sleeping on your couch.”
“Tony, calm down. Take a breath. What time did Pepper say we were meeting?”
“What are you working on?”
"It's only been a couple months." Tony cupped Steve's face in his hands, pressed a gentle kiss to the blond's forehead. "Let's go talk to Thor and the others before we throw in the towel."
Dancing with Pepper feels...not quite right, but familiar, easy. So he lets himself get lost in the motions, in the feeling of Pepper held closely, in the scent of her perfume, even as his eyes keep flicking back toward Steve and his date. Natasha catches his eye from where she's twirling gracefully with some congressman, and he recognises that gleam in her eye. He forces a smile, focuses back on Pepper.
“You dick.”
She rolls her eyes and unbuckles her seatbelt; Steve shuts off the ignition, steps out of the car, and heads to the trunk to grab the duffel bags. Clint and Bruce are in the communal living room when Natasha and Steve step off the elevator. Thor sits at the table in the kitchen, reading a science journal with a strip of bacon held aloft in his fingers but long forgotten. Tony is - nowhere to be found. It isn’t surprising, though, at least not to Steve. He hadn’t expected Tony to roll out the red carpet and make a huge deal out of their arrival. He says hello and goodnight to the others, steers himself toward his quarters.
“Do you have an appointment?”
“Yeah. Clint, Kate, and Pietro make comic books, just like Steve does.”
of the suit taking off through the glassless windows. Natasha is suddenly by Steve's side, her suit jacket already off and wadded up. Another man crawls nearer through the wreckage ー T’Challa, the prince.  Steve makes sure that the situation is handled then takes off running for the exit. Sam and Clint are close behind. His phone rings in his pocket; he doesn't bother barking out a greeting.
“Exactly. And to make that possible, we had to turn to magic, since science and biology aren’t on our side. Thor brought his mother here, and she allowed us the use of their magic. She gave us her word that Loki’s powers are being watched closely, with strict conditions.”
Now I'm off to wait for details for my grandmother's funeral.
Natasha meets his gaze, and they hesitate for only a second before saying simultaneously, “Tomorrow.”
“Steve. Steven. It’s almost five-thirty.”
going. When Tony sits beside him, it’s close, closer than Steve expected, but he doesn’t complain. The warmth Tony is giving off is pleasant, comforting. It keeps the loneliness at bay. Steve lets himself melt into the cushions, forces his brain to not dwell on the fact that their knees are pressed together.
“I am unable to reach him through standard means. I have, however, taken liberty to leave a message with Dr Foster, asking that she has him contact you the moment she is in communication with him.”
“Who is it from?”
“I know, sweetheart, and I forgive you, but please talk to me, okay?”
“I know, I know. I’ll, uh, I’ll think about it.”
“And I’m coming,” he concedes when he catches sight of the Widow’s Bites in her hand.
were you thinking?”
, what are you doing? And, and who the Hell are
“He?” She paused just long enough that Steve starts to wonder if his ma has hung up. “Stevie, do you have a date with your neighbour?”
“You should've taken better care of yourself,” Steve murmurs before pressing his lips against the skin behind Tony's ear, relishing the way Tony shivers.
this ー he may not have been the one to ask, that was all Nat, but he absolutely does want this, wants whatever he can get of Tony. But Tony is… Tony's Tony, even without the last name. He's brilliant, witty, generosity wrapped in sarcasm and barbs dipped in snark, and add in the Stark legacy and fortune, and Steve doesn't amount to nearly a quarter of the man Tony is. He can hear Bucky now, all
“Good, good. Glad to, uh, glad to hear it. Really, glad to know the uniform does a good job of protecting you, so what the hell do you think that woman meant?”
“I should go in alone.”
Coulson steps away from the camera just as the song comes to an end. Bucky’s face lights up when he catches sight of Steve standing by the door. He grabs a bottle of water from the mini-fridge that sits off to the side of the room, makes his way across the large space. Up close, Steve can see the mascara that thickens his best friend’s lashes and the thin line of eyeliner that emphasises his grey-blue eyes. The dimness of the room, apart from the brightly-lit staging area, does nothing to hide the definition of Bucky’s muscular form; his skin glistens faintly as he takes a large drink of his water. When he’s drained half the bottle, he screws the cap back on and smiles brightly.
Peter and his father are standing on the landing outside his door when Steve returns.
“Uh, actually, Peter did. He drew me a picture when I was watching him, and it was Spiderman, and he said I could use it for my comics, which is why Spiderman’s other identity is Peter Parker.”
“Uh, yeah, actually. I write comics.” Steve puts his sketches back in his bag and meets Tony’s gaze head-on. “So…”
“Damn,” he swears as he ends the call, only to call back.
Tony thinks with a sigh, pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes. He orders JARVIS to tell Steve that he’ll be back then leaves the room to find Natasha.
“I accept your proposal of being engaged to be engaged.” He grins widely. “You sure are somethin’ else, Tony.”
that might fight even slightly, since the child’s only clothes are currently lying, dirty, on the bathroom floor. He manages to find a T-shirt from before the growth spurt that brought him a foot taller and allowed him to gain almost eighty pounds. The shirt still dwarfs Peter when Steve pulls it over his head, but Peter doesn’t seem to mind at all; he just grips the bottom hem in his small hands and holds it out of the way so he doesn’t trip as he makes his way down the hall to the living room. Steve hurriedly cleans up the mess in the bathroom, folds Peter’s dirty clothes, and unplugs the tub. The water starts draining with a loud gurgle, and Steve turns off the light and follows after the boy.
He was the first to arrive at SHIELD, but that was nothing new. He quickly set up the coffee machine in the breakroom. Coulson arrived right after the coffee finished brewing; in his hand was a bag of pastries from Mama Wilson’s Cafe. Steve accepted the blueberry crumble muffin he was offered with a simple “Thanks, Phil” and let the Head of the Photography Division go on his way. Sam and Natasha were the next to arrive, sharing sleepy smiles and innocent touches; they stopped by to say hello to Steve and share details of the gallery event the night before. Natasha was in the middle of telling Steve how one of the attendees mistook her for an escort (“He seriously told me that I’m too beautiful and ‘fuckable’ to be just a model, then ordered me to tell my boss that if ‘he ever needs more money, I’ll gladly pay double what he needs for a night with you.’”) when Clint stumbled in, bleary-eyed and making a beeline for the pot of coffee.
It isn’t but three minutes later that a shrill shriek of “
“Oh, Steve.”
"Calm down, Pip, I'm getting to it. So, Steve, Peter and I go for brunch every Saturday morning. Since you took decent enough care of the little pipsqueak last night, I figured feeding you is the least I can do to say thank you."
Well, nobody has to know.
“What’s wrong?”
Natasha is the first to notice the trio when they step out onto the back patio of Sam’s house. She hands her beer off to Clint before making her way across the yard; Peter's grip tightens on Steve's hand the closer she gets, and Steve squeezes back gently, smiling down at the child. Natasha crouches down until she's at his height.
. I just… I wasn’t expecting that.”
Steve nods. “Yeah, I’m…I’m fine. Just, it's hard. To talk about, I mean.”
“Loki.”
Loki shrugs, a nonchalant gesture that’s at complete odds to the tightness around his blue eyes. “It’s okay. Ms Potts already called to warn me.”
“So.”
“You are going to be the death of me, I swear to God, Steven.”
Tony sighs and struggles to sit up. “As I was saying, in my defence, I’ve only been here since six-thirty this morning.”
Frigga gingerly took the box from Tony’s hands, her fingers tracing intricate etchings in the metal. From his spot, Steve couldn’t see the full design, but the way the queen’s face lit up told him enough. She flipped a tab, opened the box; soft, beautiful
Once the roles are handed out, Clint and Natasha slip from the room almost immediately, and Thor strides heavily toward the elevator to get to the landing pad. A lightning strike flashes, thunder cracks, and he's gone, leaving behind the fading brilliance of a rainbow. Bruce silently leaves, most likely heading for his lab. Tony gives Steve a tight-lipped smile and tugs Rhodes through the doorway. Sam raises an eyebrow.
, he loves me lots, so why won’t you marry him?” Peter whines, sniffling, and Steve isn’t sure if the kid is beyond tired, and therefore more emotional than usual, or if he’s just a damn good actor.
“Now, with that, I must go. I have my duties that I am neglecting in order to explain myself. Congratulations again, Avengers. Remember that you
Steve is still smiling as he scrolls through his available television channels for kid-appropriate shows. Peter perks up at the sight of a cartoon family and their robot ostrich aboard a spaceship, so Steve leaves it, turning the volume down a bit so it’s not loud enough to keep Peter awake too long. He tries to work on his comic, he really does, but he soon finds himself enthralled by the show as the Callisto family travels through space and goes on missions. And although Peter is asleep with his arms wrapped tightly around his stuffed animals by the end of the first episode, Steve keeps the show going, watching every second.
After almost half an hour, Steve turns back. He's almost surprised that all he sees is nature and the open blue sky; he expected someone to come find him and try to convince him to go home. Reluctantly, he accepts that he’s alone and slides back into the driver’s seat. He signals to merge onto the road, though there are no oncoming cars, and continues, letting the tires eat up the miles.
“Sorry, I promise I’m not laughin’ at you. You’re definitely not fucking this up. This… this is much more than I expected.”
“I’m so sorry.” Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s shoulders, closes his eyes against the spray of water. “I am more sorry than I could ever say, that should be impossible considering I never shut up, but it’s true, Steve. I’d take my whole ‘escape from the freak out instead of talking to the man I love more than anything’ back if I could. But I’m here now, ready to talk this over and even stay quiet the entire time if that’s what you need from me.” He sighs. “How can I make this better?”
“Yes, I suppose so.”
“No, I'm serious. I swear, Steve, the dick candle is
“My ma and I… We stumbled across this place before she got sick. We were gonna go back the following year, but she…”
“Body, body-swap,” Tony interjects. “He’s still Steve, all the way to his core. It’s his body that’s different.”
The smile she gives him is soft, unguarded. “I’m glad. You’ll let us know?”
“Don’t be, darling. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I promise.”
“Am I… am I gonna be killed by
That statement eventually became more of a joke than anything.
“What if this is all just… What if this happens? For real?”
without a doubt that it isn't for those reasons. Tony's much more than his name, his company, his fortune, his legacy, and Steve wants to know more about who Tony is at his core. So he sits there and waits for any response, though he's hoping for a certain one.
at me!”
“Welcome home, sir.”
“And what do you propose, Stark? Letting him remain on the loose?”
“Are you up to getting fucked? Because I’m dying to fuck you.”
Tony, on the other hand, wants nothing more than to throw caution to the wind, to touch Steve – his Steve – to kiss the anxious expression off his beautiful face; to drag him back to the tower, lock the doors, and spend the next few hours beneath the sheets. But he forces himself to force to show polite attention to Steve, bestowing the deeper contact on Loki. Each time he glances at Steve hurts, especially when Tony is brushing his fingers across the back of Loki’s hand or sharing an affectionate smile with the wrong Steve.
Tony’s laughter slowly dies as he steps off the elevator and smells paint. He follows the odour to the spare bedroom that once housed an impressive collection of vintage liquors.
“Okay, so, Pietro won't tell anyone, but he's having a hard time getting the pose for one of his characters right, and if I ask Clint to help, he'd be too embarrassed, since, ya know, for some damn reason, Clint's his role model. So can you help him?”
going to be able to do this?” She continues quietly, almost like she’s speaking to herself, “I have no idea how to do this. How am I going to juggle the schedules?” She stares at Tony with wide eyes. “I have to make sure you’re not gone too much, but there are a lot of important duties that you absolutely can
Tony crosses the room once the last nurse leaves, sits on the edge of the bed. Steve presses a button on the remote until the head of the bed is raised. Tony was right: Their daughter is gorgeous. Dark wisps of hair poke out from under the stretchy little cap she wears, and her cheeks are surprisingly chubby for her premature arrival. Steve strokes a finger softly across her forehead.
Tony drops his head into his hands and sighs. The translator is having a difficult time explaining to the plant overseer what Tony is requiring, and Tony himself is starting to nurse a headache of massive proportions. The clock in the corner of the screen reads 2:38am. He knows Steve is already in bed, and all he wants is to join his partner, but… Duty calls, and all that.
He can hear Clint protesting as he walks out of the kitchen (
kinda terrifying, isn’t it?”
Tony can feel Steve's smile when he leans back in for another kiss.
“Sir? Are you okay?”
"It's not too obvious. Well... You're not terrible, at least."
After work, Steve met up with his mother for an early dinner, stopped by the small market on the corner for a few groceries, then headed home for a night working on the concept art for his next story arc and a few episodes of
“That’s nice. Honestly, I’m just shocked you two get along enough to spend so much time together.”
Steve startles, bites down on a yelp, and drags in an unsteady breath. “Uh, I won’t be imposing on him?”
“This is too much, especially since I said no money.”
Steve is in the shower and Tony is sitting at the table in the kitchen, reading over the latest R&D updates when JARVIS announces Pepper’s impending arrival. Tony requests his AI inform Steve of their company “when he’s out of the shower, don’t give him a heart attack for God’s sake.” He pours another mug of coffee for his favourite CEO, hides the strawberries (he learned his lesson about that particular fruit a long time ago), and waits for the
“Fantastic.” Tony drops a lemon slice into his glass of water. “I guess we should explain everything.”
The next month and a half passes much the same: At least once a week, Steve, Loki, and Tony share a meal in public, all sticking to the same script. The routine gets easier, less awkward, the more they follow it. Loki proves to be a great conversationalist, especially when it’s less
Tony steps off the elevator and straight into a waiting Steve’s arms. He allows himself to melt into the comfort of the super-soldier’s embrace, breathes in deep the scent of everything so purely Steve. When they separate, he drops his briefcase onto the floor and heads to the kitchen.
The first couple of times that Loki transformed was…
“Well, that… did
Without waiting for a reply, Steve turns and heads back down the hall. Peter instinctively curls into his chest once Steve has him cradled in his arms; Tony makes a weird little noise in the back of his throat, and Steve tears his gaze away from the sleeping child’s face to raise an eyebrow at the other man. Though his cheeks are tinged pink, Tony doesn’t say anything, just easily scoops up his son’s backpack and shoes, and exits the apartment. Steve follows closely behind, holding Peter just a little tighter so the overhead light in the hall doesn’t shine directly in his face. He places Peter in his bed a moment later, just like he did on Friday night, and lets Tony finish the routine. He leaves the Parkers’ apartment without saying goodnight.
“‘Z’it over?”
Tony smiles, a thin-pressed twist to his lips, and exits the room. Steve barely manages to suppress a sigh of frustration as his partner disappears. Once he’s led the royal party to the guest floor, he leaves them with a smile, turns, and sets off in search of Tony. JARVIS is, shockingly, no help, ignoring Steve’s requests for Tony’s location. The workshop is empty, the penthouse is dark. Only Bruce is in the communal kitchen; he looks apologetic when he tells Steve he hasn’t seen Tony. Steve even tries calling Pepper who snaps that she’s too busy to be Tony’s babysitter.
“Okay.”
, puts his phone in his locker, and changes into a pair of athletic shorts and a T-shirt.
"Sure, Tony," Steve says. Not exactly in agreement; more because he and Tony are both leaning in again and his mouth is mostly running on autopilot.
Bucky's reactions remain pure gold through the rest of the story, murderous rage turning into almost painful relief (same as it had for Steve when it was happening to him). By the end of it Bucky's smiling so wide it doesn't even look real.
Steve laughs, then stops when he realizes Bucky isn't joking.
"I am," Steve says. He thinks about bumping into Tony on their way into work yesterday, how Tony'd flushed to the roots of his hair when Steve stuttered hello, and feels his smile grow even wider. "I really, really am."
Once again, Steve's thrown so off-balance by something so unexpected that all he can say is, "What?"
Tony and Bucky both end up leaving right after breakfast - Tony for a Saturday work meeting; Bucky to finalize some of the paperwork for his discharge that Steve only just found out he's been planning for months - unknowingly leaving Steve alone with the realization that he wants Tony and Bucky
"Because if you say yes, one of those is for your signif, then I won't ask you for your phone number."
Steve laughs. "That was all Bucky."
Tony pulls out his phone, lights the screen, and slaps it on the table. "Read it and weep, bitches!"
Tony yelps as Steve springs away from him. "Sorry!" Steve shouts towards his computer. His computer, which is still Skyping Bucky. His computer, which is unintentionally aimed right at the door. His computer where Bucky, back inside now and sprawling on his bunk, has been watching this whole thing with a shit-eating grin.
that Tony wanted him, too. 'Cause this, oh, quite aside from the sting of rejection, there's also the sting of crushed expectations.
"Steve, Steve, Steve!" Tony's got him by the shoulders. "Look at me, look at me,
"Made you?" Tony says, willfully missing the point. "I seem to remember both of you being on board the moment you found out it was a comedy starring Cate Blanchett."
Steve laughs and pulls Tony in by the waist, but at the last second doesn't kiss him. Doesn't know if that'd be weird, with Bucky maybe wanting to kiss one or both of them and maybe not. Really doesn't want Bucky to feel left out, either. So he turns it into a hug instead, dropping his face to Tony's shoulder and muffling his smile in his shirt.
"Good," says Tony quickly. "Good. That's good."
Tony nods. "And you know what one of the very most important rules in sales is?"
When he gets home that night he wants to talk to Bucky, wants him desperately - but Bucky's gone and their next call isn't for almost a week. He spends half a fruitless hour trying to write an email to Bucky before he realizes he doesn't want to; what he
Steve just sighs and moves his hand. With Bucky still overseas, he's starting to take his talks about being careful while he's gone more seriously. Not because Steve thinks he needs to be more careful, or because he doesn't know how he'll get out of fights without Bucky beside him, but because now that Bucky's in constant danger he's got a bit more empathy.
It takes longer when Steve goes, of course. Despite what some people used to say (
They kiss for a bit, before Steve ruefully pulls back. "We should probably talk."
Tony laughs. "Fair enough. Okay. This is me, hanging up in real life. Good bye, Steve."
Tony's still staring at him. "You said 'when you'd finally slept with someone.' That is exactly what you said. Did you mean - did you mean -"
"Yeah," Tony says. His smile is so wide it looks like it hurts. "Yeah. Sure. Any time, any place."
of us asks him?"
I'm going to see him again. He's," and Steve's laughter quiets, and he finds himself toying with a pencil left on his desk to avoid Bucky's non-existent eye contact. "He's real swell, Buck. I like him a lot. And he really seems to like me."
"That wasn't the bet anyway," someone says. "The bet was whether or not Tony would even
Tony says, "It's really incredible the lengths you've gone to in order to avoid actually
It's not - he's not sure if he's upset or not. Jealous that Bucky told Tony and not him, maybe? Weirded out that Bucky would have told Tony something important and kept it from Steve? Weirded out by how not at all upset or jealous he is? Or maybe -
"Okay," says Steve. He squeezes Tony's hand one last time and steps back. Then, before he can think better of it (or chicken out), Steve continues quietly, "Just think of me later, okay?"
Just when Steve thinks it's going to go to voicemail a very gruff voice snaps, "What, Tony?"
"Aww, we didn't think he'd really do it!" some of them yell.
So first order of business is broaching the topic with Tony. And then, oh
But before Tony quite gets to him he slows down a bit, panting, and holds up his hands. "Hey, man," he says, and the nervousness in his smile is so overwhelming it manages to catch Steve's attention. "Have you gotten any of my texts?"
Steve cups the back of his head and pulls him down to kiss him slower, deeper.
"All right, but it better not be anything gross or slimy. Or anything that stains," Tony says, but he obediently closes his eyes and holds out his cupped palms.
He turns around and sees Tony running after him. He wants to just keep walking, but he ALSO wants to stand his ground and use Tony's momentum against him to punch him in the face, so.
It's the most obvious change of topic Steve's ever heard, but it's not like Tony was trying to be subtle. Neither of them has seen Cloud Atlas before, but Tony says he's in the mood for epic romances and things that don't make a whole lot of sense, and acts baffled at his own thought processes. Trying to convince Steve and Bucky to watch the movie without saying a single word about the plot and adamantly refusing to allow either of them to look it up on their phones (knowing anything at all about the plot beforehand would ruin it, he insists) carries them through the rest of dinner, and it's not until they're clearing the table that Bucky suddenly whirls on Tony and  says, indignant and laughing, "Oh Jesus,
It's so quick Steve's pulling back before Tony can even gasp. His eyes snap open and he's looking at Steve slack-jawed. There's actual, honest-to-Jesus awe on his face, and Steve's struck by the realization that Tony
Steve hadn't understood. It was like not realizing he was thirsty until he took a drink of water. Nothing else in the world exists except Tony.
"Even better!" Tony says. "This is a great song to learn to. I'll teach you."
Steve freezes. Tony and Bucky don't say anything else. After a minute Tony calls, "Steve? Do we really need another chair?"
Are you telling me, Bucky would say to Tony through his teeth, that fucker just left you there?
Steve can feel himself
," and Wade's still shouting about polyamory and he could love them both so well and Tony's moving his thumb to hang up when Wade yells, "Wait a sec at least tell me if I know Peter in this universe!" and the line goes dead.
In accordance with this plan Steve says, "Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?"
Bucky, though, Bucky looks fit to murder someone. Steve's not even done with what he heard when Bucky holds up his hand and says, "I'm gonna have to stop you there, Steve. Gotta tell my CO I'm deserting so I can go choke a couple'a bitches back in the States. I'll see you in a day or two."
"Oh," Tony says, and wow, he really does like Steve. The droop Tony's shoulders have going on is impressive.
"Oh," Tony says casually, "we email." Which strikes terror into Steve's heart.
Steve pastes on his best Innocent Angel Wide Eyes. "What?"
Steve laughs. "No, Bucky, swear I haven't. It's a good story, honest. I promise."
"Okay," Tony says calmly. "There are a few different issues here, so let's go in order, shall we? One, I am not leaving you unless you ask me to go. Two, I am not angry. Three, I'm kinda upset that you've been treating me poorly and that you kept this from me,
Startled, Steve laughs. "Really? Why?"
this."
And Tony answers, "Whether or not one of them was for your signif."
"No, no, that's not it at all," Steve says. "It's just - I mean, I wanted you to stay. I did. But - Bucky doesn't get much time on Skype, you know? And tonight he had a huge chunk of time, so we've been planning this for ages."
Tony doesn't stop talking, and Steve realizes that he and Tony are
He drops what he's holding into Tony's upheld hands, and more importantly - Steve leans down and presses a tiny kiss to Tony's lips.
"I'm sorry," Steve repeats. Before Tony can say anything else Steve manages, "I'm afraid."
"What?" Steve asks.
"Here," Tony says, handing his phone to Steve. He shoves it too far and Steve fumbles for it and it almost drops, but somehow between the two of them Steve manages to get a grip on it. It's already open to a new contact, and Steve's hands are shaking so bad it takes two tries to get his own damn number in right, but eventually he manages.
Steve's laughing, too happy with the thought of Tony and the reality of Bucky to do anything else. "I'm joking, Buck, jeez. Of
"That's the general idea," Tony says happily, and it'll be days before Steve picks up on the possible innuendo in that.
"Because you don't trust me." Steve starts to protest (more out of reflexive politeness than honesty, really), and Tony holds up a hand. "You don't. You shouldn't. Thinking back, I can definitely hear what it must have sounded like to you. But I really, really need you to believe me, so I've got to do something to prove to you that it was
Bucky looks oddly flustered, same as Tony. "Tony," he says, shaking Tony's hand. "Glad to see you."
isn't to send Bucky news about himself, it's to read new words from Bucky. But that's not something he can ask for (at least, not without worrying Bucky, and the guy's got enough to worry about right now without knowing Steve got played), so he falls asleep reading through all Bucky's old emails instead. There's no point dwelling on Tony or what happened.
A week after Bucky's sudden return Tony sits Steve down - practically sits on top of him - and repeats over and over again that it doesn't matter what's wrong, it doesn't matter what's going on, Tony's not going to leave him for it, so please tell him. No matter what Steve says, no matter how many times he tries to explain that he's dealing with it, Tony just keeps saying that. Steve could just get up and leave, and almost does so more than once, but the sudden hurt he sees flashing across Tony's face before Tony can lock it down slices at Steve. The hurt just makes him angrier, though, and resentful at Tony for causing it, and everything just tangles up in his head and falls out of his mouth so he tells Tony the whole thing, but somehow he manages to make it sound like he's mad at Tony about it.
What even CAN he say? 'I know you guys get hit on so much you complain about it, but guess what, it just happened to me, and I'm so fucking happy I can't stop smiling?' Probably no. 'I know all the people who mack on you guys in bars are creeps and assholes, but seriously, the person who just did it to me is
"Okay," says Tony.
Steve knows what Tony's trying to say, but he's still too incredulous. "You mean you were a freshman in high school -?"
, Steven! How can you think I'd only want to take care of you out of some smug superiority complex? I want everything to be perfect for you because how could I
"Why're you wet?" Bucky asks. Still laughing, the bastard. He knows better by now than to ask why Steve's cold, though.
"What?" Tony says. Bucky starts laughing uproariously, and Tony tenses.
Tony says, "Well, I had a good time -" just as Steve says, "Do you want to -?"
skeptical that this isn't some kind of elaborate prank, so he does it. Scrolls up then down then up again and taps the screen without really looking.
"Right!" Tony says. Steve almost jumps. "Right, okay, so that was you saying you're single, right? Okay. So. That was you, now this is me asking for your number."
"Really," says Steve. He's laughing.
because of you!"
Oddly, Tony tilts his head like he's trying to figure something out. "Look, Steve. If you're so uncomfortable with this that it didn't even
Tony's face relaxes into a happy grin. "That
I didn't ask him to stay, Steve points out. Bucky argues: you call him right this second and tell him to come back.
"No!" Steve says immediately, not letting that thought get any further in Tony's head. "Oh Jesus no. No, no, nothing like that."
I love you, Steve wants to say, but doesn't know if that would make things easier or harder for Tony, so instead he winds his arms around his neck and kisses him until Bucky knocks on the door.
"Yeah," Steve says, leaning into him and laying his head on Tony's shoulder. "Really okay."
Steve can feel himself flush. Damnit. "Shut up, Buck."
The guy orders, then motions to Steve. He's so busy wondering what the fuck is happening here that he just orders on autopilot, and doesn't realize what he's done till the guy laughs. "Either you're an alcoholic with wildly divergent tastes or you just ordered drinks for your friends, too. Either way I salute your moxie." The barkeep sets down his drink just in time for him to pick it up and salute Steve.
Bucky's always said Steve has the mind of a military commander, albeit one of the ones that would consistently pull insane stunts that ended up working, and as he outlines his twelfth battle plan he can definitely see why Bucky says that.
Tony runs a hand through his hair again, then jabs a finger towards Steve. "Would you recognize any of them again?"
"I know what 'signif' means," says Steve, still too confused to be polite. "I'm just wondering why you care."
"What?" says Steve. "You gonna tell me I misheard? Or that I misunderstood?"
And then one of the guys sitting across from Tony raises his arms and says, "Hold up, hold up, hold up! Deets or it didn't happen, Tony."
He can't bring himself to tell them. For their sake, too, but mostly because he doesn't think he'll ever be able to say the words without throwing up.
Because evidence that Tony only did it as a joke: overwhelming.
Tony searches his face for a moment, and then a small, bright smile steals across his own. "I know," he says, then kisses Steve quickly. "I know that. I do. I'm just - nervous. But excited."
They're in Steve's apartment - it's their fifth date, and they decided to make dinner together - and the radio's playing. The food's eaten, the dishes washed, and they're trying to decide what movie to watch when Just My Type starts playing.
"Okay," says Steve.
Evidence in favor of Tony being attracted to Steve: asking for his phone number.
"You too, Darcy. Don’t break too many hearts today, okay?"
They both stop, taking deep breaths like they've suddenly stopped running. Steve's chest is heaving and he can feel his face scrunching up and he doesn't know
"But if
"No, no, seriously, come on!" Tony says. "Steve! This is a very short song! We gotta get while the getting's good!"
"Fine. FINE. But on your head be it," Steve says, utterly defeated.
"You have, um," Tony says, apparently unable to stop himself from running his lips over Steve's forehead, even as he tries to actually say something. "You have your phone call."
"Okay," Tony says. "That's all right. We'll figure it out."
"Steve," Tony says. "Why did you give me a rock?"
"Because I don't want you peeking," Steve says. Tony sighs, but obediently tips his chin up a bit more. Steve takes a deep breath - then another, because he's suddenly far more nervous than he was when he got this idea. A third deep breath, and he goes for it.
Steve's shocked and Tony's laughing. He pushes his phone towards Steve again and says, "That totally didn't count. Logan's an asshole. Here, really, do one more."
Bucky laughs at him, the warm dry bastard, and asks about Tony. And Steve is still so out of sorts with his entire life right now that - he doesn't SAY anything, of course he doesn't, because for uncountable reasons he doesn't
Steve turns around and walks out.
"Of course," Tony says, thankfully looking confused by the implication he might feel forced.
"There it is," Tony says.
Bucky leans forward and his eyes narrow at something below the camera, where Steve knows his own picture is showing on Bucky's screen. He never realized how much he relies on eye contact until he started regularly Skyping someone. "You get in a fight again, punk?"
"Now that's what I call enthusiasm!" the guy laughs. He flags down the barkeep, and the barkeep
They end up sitting on a bench in the park watching people go by, like every rom-com ever set in New York. Steve's surprisingly okay with it. When Tony finishes his coffee Steve snatches it and goes to throw it away before Tony can react. He's walking back to their bench when he spots something on the ground and gets an idea.
"Meh," says Bucky, waving a hand at him through the screen from the other side of the world, "tell me anyway. If we get interrupted I'll just see if I can guess the end before next week."
"Just a smile," the guy says.
"Bucky, it's not -"
They're outside Steve's apartment, tucked away in a dark corner of the little brick alcove, safe from prying eyes and pouring rain. Steve is pressed against the wall with his arms around Tony's neck and his hands roaming over his solid shoulders and tangling in his wild, dripping hair. And Tony - Tony's pressed all down his front, the solid warmth of him so different from the scratchy cold hardness of the brick digging into his shoulders. Tony's got his arms around Steve's waist, and seems to be doing everything he can think of to get just
"Do you have anyone like that?" Steve asks, desperate to ask a question of Tony, before he thinks it through.
"Are you telling me," Bucky says through his teeth, the camera suddenly tilting to show his face against a startlingly blue sky,
As affecting and good as it may have been to be in Bucky's arms, watching Bucky and Tony hug, however briefly, is even more so.
"I - I'm sorry," Steve stammers, completely mortified. "I didn't mean - of course you don't have to get - Those are all on me," he says to the barkeep when he sets the three drinks down in front of Steve.
leading him on, Tony really does genuinely LIKE him, and in light of that Steve's treated him pretty badly. Unintentionally, but these last few days have probably been as awful for him as they were for Steve. "I'll do it right now. And I'll, um. I'll - I'll text
Steve gawps at him. "You went to MIT when you were fourteen?"
"Take it," Tony says.
"Um, what?" Steve asks, stepping out of his room. He hopes they can't tell he heard that.
"Hold up," says Tony.
They do watch Cloud Atlas, and a single solitary hint regarding what it was about absolutely would have ruined it, and it definitely was exactly the right movie for them to watch at exactly the right time.
Now Tony's laughing, too. "No argument here."
"Of course I do, Jesus, I mean I know I have memory problems but seriously there's no way I could forget the guy even if I wanted to since you talk about him so goddamn much, and wow, Stark, when
"Cyber high-five!" Tony shouts, holding up his hand.
"Because," Tony says, "once you get what you came for you literally cannot get anything more. It's impossible. If you keep talking, the one and only thing you can do is talk people
, and completely unable to process that. Or even deal with it.
They laugh and talk and it's - it's - Well. Bucky has to go shortly after that, which is a shame, because actually it's -
Steve starts to pull away, citing the fact that this song is anything but slow, and then a new song starts playing.
more. And there's not - No consequences, okay? Neither Steve nor I will ever bring this up again. Ball's in your court, Bucky. If you don't want anything to change, it won't. This isn't an ultimatum. We just - I have feelings for you, all right? And I want to be with you. But the reason I want that is because I like you, and that's sure as hell not going to just go away if you don't want any part of this, okay?"
"Oh," says Steve. Then, "Wait, I thought you said you met when you were both fourteen? So high school?"
"Polyamorous," Bucky says. Steve can't get a read on his tone. He opens his mouth to explain, but still blank-faced Bucky continues, "Like, open? Or with you guys as the primaries?"
"Pick one what?" Steve splutters.
to tell you the whole thing at once. Doesn't make for a good cliffhanger, this one."
"I got the first one," Steve says.
-It's wonderful. Talking to them both at the same time. Why is it that all the best parts of Steve's life are things that just can't last?
am pretty far outside your experience, too. So. Just, please remember all this next time something like this comes up, okay? Just try to be honest and remember that I'm on your side. Even if honesty is saying 'I'm working through something and I don't want to talk about it yet,' that's good, too."
The same way Steve used to automatically turn to Bucky to point out funny or interesting things (it had taken him so
"I don't have a girlfriend." Steve looks down at the three drinks, then back up at Tony. "And I don't have a boyfriend, either."
"No," Steve says, then scrunches his nose, because he is sure that Bucky doesn't have it right but he can't put his finger on why.
That should be it, except three paces later Steve looks over his shoulder, and Tony looks over his shoulder, too, and they both duck their heads and Steve's flushing bright red and laughing at himself but it's okay, because he knows that a dozen paces behind him Tony's doing the same thing.
"Look, it - you don't have to tell me," Tony says, and now both his hands are on Steve - one still around his back holding him to Tony's side, the other rubbing up and down his arm. "There is no pressure here for you to do or say anything you don't want, okay? This is a zero-pressure zone. But I couldn't help but notice - I mean, do you mind if I ask, did you really -"
"Really," says Steve. The part of him that's not watching Tony is wondering if he's suddenly going to get a rundown of Tony's job and car and The Stats (as Sam and Nat and Steve's other friends who get hit on call them) for why he'd be a Good Catch.
So he leans over the bar and waves whenever the barkeep is facing his direction and patiently waits to see if this, THIS will be the time he actually has to go back to his friends and say he couldn't order. It's a fear that's horrible and persistent but not, he feels, unreasonable.
"There," Steve says, holding his phone out so maybe the camera can pick up the text. "I hope you're happy."
"Why not?"
Tony shrugs and looks away, smile turning pleased and possibly a bit bashful. "I was bored a lot as a child."
Steve can't stop smiling like a moron all day.
Steve rereads the email right before they Skype, so he's still laughing when Bucky calls. Bucky's face smooths into the most content smile Steve's seen on him ages, and he slumps like all his strings have been cut. "Shit, Steve, you look happy."
"Good," says Steve quietly. "That's good. Same."
Tony is apprehensive, Steve realizes, but not for himself. He is one hundred percent on board with this. He's just apprehensive about Steve's comfort level and ability to handle this.
Tony smiles at him - and this one, of all the myriad smiles Steve's seen on Tony's face so far, this one is by far his favorite.
He's expecting an answer about, y'know, how to actually sell things. Maybe something a little bit flirty. But Tony keeps smiling at him and says, "The single most important rule in sales is this: have a goal going in, and once you achieve that goal,
Darcy sighs again. "All right. Text me. Love you, Tony."
Steve can tell he means it.
tell you that you talk too much you know you have a problem. Not that I'd want to forget hot Stevie! Did I tell you I stalked you to lunch one day and saw him? Stark. Stark," Wade says, over Tony's spluttering indignation, "Stark. You must tap that. Make sweet, sweet love to that pint-sized spitfire. Do you know what I would give for a threesome with you two? A lot, let me tell you. I'd give my left arm - Fuck, man, I'd give my left
In the same speculative tone Tony continues, "I mean, he probably would WITH you, but not
"Right!" Tony straightens up and snags his drink, backing away. "Okay! Fantastic! I'm going to stop talking to you now so you don't change your mind. See ya!" And with a grin and a wink he saunters off into the crowd.
Because the thing is. If something seems too good to be true? It is.
"The you-thing, or the polyamory-in-general thing?" Tony asks lightly.
If it weren't for the radio gently crooning on the other side the apartment it would be completely silent. It's especially noticeable since Bucky and Tony had been keeping up such steady conversation before, even if Steve hadn't really joined in. Now, though, Bucky's staring at him - boggling at him, really - and Tony's mouth is open.
"Yeah," Steve says. For the first time since Steve opened his mouth Bucky looks at him.
They hold eyes for a moment, then they're both laughing so hard they have to clutch at each other to stay on the bench. Or maybe they clutch at each other just because they can. Whichever.
Steve automatically ducks his head. It's a mistake.
Tony smiles. "No, I mean that's
He starts to pull back but Steve -
Then Monday rolls around and Steve almost gives up on life. Because he walks from the bus to the building he works in and catches sight of a man in a grey suit with a distinctive goatee hurrying through the lobby, and almost smacks himself in the face when he realizes why Tony looked familiar the other night.
With great reluctance they slowly peel themselves apart. It's like waking up and realizing he's slipped in between the couch cushions: he was so warm and comfortable and Tony was so close that Steve hadn't realized how entwined they were. He so badly wants to just stay right where he is that even his muscles protest moving, like he's sore from sleeping in a strange position without the preceding discomfort.
And Tony smiles at him, but it looks weary. "Or been treated well in turn, sure. But the thing is, I have - Steve, I have done a lot, a
"It's really not," Steve says firmly. "I got caught up in my own head and only thought about myself. That's not okay. I care about you and we're together and I want to be with you, too, Tony, only I didn't -" He stops, frustrated, not knowing exactly what he didn't do, just knowing it's something he should have done and he failed. "You're important to me," he settles on. "What you want and what you think and what you're feeling and your, your
"The other night. At the bar."
"I didn't ask him to stay, Buck. Didn't even ask him inside," Steve says, not realizing that's what he did until he says it aloud. "I'm not sure he even realized I had - it doesn't matter. I didn't say anything. And it's not like I, you know. It's not like I, I
She laughs. "We’ll see." She hangs up.
"No," Tony and Bucky say at the same time, then laugh. "No,"  Tony repeats, "I had no idea."
"Polyfidelitous and equilateral," Bucky says, and that first one is a word Steve doesn't even
"Okay," Steve says. He realizes he's smiling. It makes his face ache, but pleasantly; like putting down something heavy he hadn't realized he was carrying.
you."
Bucky huffs and rolls his eyes when he sees Steve stop, though. "C'mere, punk," he says, and pulls Steve in.
"I noticed," Steve says. "But hey, what you said earlier, about this being a no-pressure zone? Goes both ways. I'm not going to - to think badly of you, Tony."
that he just blurts out, "TONY AND I WANT TO DATE YOU."
Tony's thumb rubs over Steve's knuckles. "Of what?"
He knows the script. He knows it like the back of his hand. He's never had to use it before, but he knows what he wants his own next line to be.
"Right," says Steve, slowly. What the fuck is going on?
Steve says, and Tony laughs.
"Or been treated well in turn," Steve says quietly. Tony's never said anything outright, but Steve's not stupid.
"Okay," Bucky says. He looks like he's thinking furiously. "Okay."
"No, Tony, come on," Steve says.
"No," Steve says, pushing himself away from Tony, though he can't bring himself to actually get up. "We are not doing this. Virginity is a societal construct given circular and specious value based on whether or not women bartered as breeding chattel would produce sons who were unquestionably her husband's -"
why you made us watch Bandits last time!"
"Neither do I."
"Steve," Tony says, then stops. His eyes are lowered and he's biting his lip. Finally he looks back up and says, "Look, it's not that I don't want to -"
conversations. I'm just saying. I mean I can't be sure, especially about specifics, but I know he's more laid back about relationships than I think you're giving him credit for. I mean. I'm not saying he'd want to go out with
"True! True!" some of them yell.
"Put out your hands and close your eyes," Steve says with a shit-eating grin.
Tony looks Steve in the eye with this tiny little smile and says, "No. He hasn't."
"It's not a rock," Steve says seriously. Tony looks at him incredulously, and with all the solemnity he can muster Steve says, "That, Mister Stark, is what we down in Brooklyn call a
*********************
Steve looks at him, searching his face. Tony's eyes are clenched shut, which is a good thing, because Steve's sure that one look at his face right now would give everything away.
"Steve," Tony says again. Just that. He doesn't agree, he doesn't protest, he just derails the entire argument with a single word and the gentle touch of his fingertips to Steve's cheek.
"I'm sorry," Steve says. The words are inadequate, but - "I'm so, so sorry, Tony."
They both laugh, and Steve motions Tony to go first. Tony shakes his head, and Steve takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and says, "Would you, um. Would you like to - come up?"
have set up beforehand. So pick one."
attractive. And it sure
"No I didn't!" All the horrible things Steve's been trying to not think about coming spilling out of his mouth like he'd been planning this all along. "Well, I heard, I figured it out, so I'm out. You aren't going to trick me again, and I am sure as HELL not going to just let you charm me again so you can win the next bet too!"
"It's fate!" Tony cries. "Babe, this is one of the greatest love songs ever recorded. We have to dance. It's the law. Look, just move your feet like this, don't even pick them up off the floor, okay? And let me turn you. And away we go!"
Steve can't do anything but gape.
"I was just saying you could probably let Tony have the chair," Bucky says solemnly, "since you can sit in his lap."
Bucky glares - and it's strange, knowing he's on the receiving end of a glare when Bucky's eyes are downcast - then huffs and leans back, but Steve can tell his fist is clenched. "Fine. But get to the good thing, Steve, or I really will just show up on your doorstep."
"I only halfway told him," Steve says. "It's hard to explain. I mean, I only told him a little bit, and the rest he figured out on his own. But it was - I think I felt - guilty? Maybe?"
Finally Steve huffs a laugh, rubbing a hand over his eyes. "We aren't even on the phone. We are
They both nod and chuckle and look at each other and look away.
So Steve gives in and lets Tony drag him into the biggest clear space in the apartment (where the kitchen fades into the living room, in the few feet of space between the kitchen table and the coffee table) and Tony realizes Steve wasn't exaggerating in about two seconds flat. Soon, though, they're laughing, and Tony says he's going to start by teaching Steve something slow since it'll be easiest.
And then he falls back asleep and doesn't freak out about that till morning.
Steve cringes. "We were going to talk about - about stuff before we did anything. It just, we, um. It - we didn't really mean to, so. We hadn't talked yet. But it's not like that counted anyway -"
"Steve," Tony says. "Steve. If one of us asks him out, what does that look like?"
be what really happened. Things that seem too good to be true generally are.
"So you wanted to have the polyamory discussion before Bucky even came home?" Steve asks.
At last, Steve settles into his chair and mock-glares. It's supposed to be a mock-glare, anyway. But judging by the slight shift of Bucky's head, it may come off a bit more sincere than he means it. "Because it is pouring rain outside, that's why."
He leans down and kisses Steve's cheek, gives him a pointed look as he puts his hands in his pockets and pushes his jacket down, then walks away into the rain. Steve just watches him go.
"Equilateral," Tony says. "No primary. Or, I guess, the relationship between all three of us being primary, however you want to look at it. But equal. Not Steve and I with you off to the side. No. All three of us equal."
"Tony, this is Bucky," says Steve, gesturing at the screen. Bucky waves through gales of laughter. "And Buck, this is Tony."
They lock eyes and for minutes or moments they don't look away. Then Steve comes out of it, realizes he must look like a dope, and looks away. "Well, um," he says, gesturing over his shoulder. "I should, yeah."
just show up.
." And he laughs.
"Yeah, but -" Steve starts and it's ringing before he can even decide what to say.
like is going on. Because this, this right here, is why no one likes it when Nat goes to the bar: she gets hit on so much it's annoying for her and anyone waiting for her to get back, and painful for anyone else. Sam has much the same problem, though not quite so bad. And Steve? Gets to go instead of either of them, because he has never been hit on at a bar a day in his life.
"I've spent some time in sales, you know," Tony says, suddenly looking seductive again, leaning back against the bar and taking a sip from his drink. He swallows. His throat moves. Steve swallows, too.

, his embarrassment is intense, but he doesn't care and he can't stop smiling anyway.
Bucky used to do this thing when they were kids, where his face would go kind of tense, but then it wouldn't change again, no matter what happened. Bucky broke his arm when he was ten and pulled out the Tense Face and Steve will swear in a court of law that his expression didn't change for a solid sixteen hours. Since he's grown up, and especially since he's been in the army, he's perfected the Blank Stare to the point where it looks like he fell asleep with his eyes open. It's useful, he says, because it makes people think he's not paying attention, or that he really doesn't care what's happening around him.
"I, um," Steve says.
A hush falls over the table, everyone looking at Tony and holding their collective breath.
"Who's Peter?" Steve asks.
how far outside your experience this is, I realize you didn't keep this from me for all that long, and I realize that
Steve laughs. "I can imagine that," he says, and the smile Tony turns on him is beautiful and sincere.
Somehow that leads into what they do for a living, and Steve finds out that Tony and Bruce run a company together (they actually own two floors of their mutual work building). Apparently Tony's family is big in The Industry (though Steve's still not clear on what industry that is) and he broke away to start his own company. Steve doesn't ask for details, and doesn't ask anything about his family, and Tony doesn't volunteer any information.
"BUT," Steve continues, "I am free tomorrow night."
"Oh," Tony says. "I, um. I sent you more than that. Is, uh, is your phone not working? Or maybe mine's not. It's, I mean, a hunk of shit, of course, let, um, let me text you again and see if it works -"
, but in the same building. And yeah, seeing him in this context and in a suit instead of in a bar, Steve remembers also seeing him out of the corner of his eye in the building sandwich shop a few times. He'd never gotten close enough to get a good look, which is why he hadn't immediately recognized him the other night. But still. This is bad enough.
"Look, man, all you had to do was pine in silence for a measly three more days and I'd've won, you
were something - or, well, someone - I mean - Look, being with you was something both of us wanted before we even talked to each other about it, okay? This really is something that we both - we both want."
"Oh man, I am going to
"And don't," Tony says right over him, shaking his head, something ugly coming into his expression. "Don't let me stay just because sometimes in among all the babble I can talk pretty. Don't think you have any kind of obligation to me just because I think you have a spectacular ass, okay? You don't owe me anything, Steve, and I couldn't bear it if -"
"It's not that big a deal!" Steve says desperately.
Because, yes, okay, there might be some kind of relevant information that Steve didn't actually
Steve looks at Tony. Tony looks at Steve.
Initially Steve had been planning on just going to Starbucks, but when he began turning towards the door Tony had taken one look at it, said, "Nope, no, no way, no how," snagged him by the hand and tugged him away. Steve's so startled by the contact he just goes with it, walking away and not tugging his hand out of Tony's grasp. After a moment he sees Tony glance down at their hands before hastily letting go, but it's nice while it lasts.
But not like he's laughing at Steve. He's got one hand on his hip and one hand running through his hair and his laugh is hysteric, like he's shocked and sick, and it's not what Steve's expecting at all.
"Look, Buck," Steve starts.
Not at the same company as Steve, thank fucking
"I know," Tony says. He pecks Steve's lips again, then settles back against the couch, tugging on Steve's waist so he can settle more comfortably against Tony. "Let's start out with why you called me to come back, okay?"
and Steve's lost.
They hold it for just a moment, not even long enough for Steve to start guessing and second-guessing whether he should pull back first or let Bucky hug him as long as he wants, and before he can get himself tied in a knot Bucky steps back and nudges his shoulder. "Punk," he says again, voice filled with affection.
"Hey," Steve says quietly, "you know we don't have to do this, right?"
of giving what you've already got. So as soon as they agree to what you want, you say thanks and get the hell out of Dodge."
When Steve pulls back to gauge Tony's expression, Tony keeps staring at him. Then he lets out a shaky breath and says, "Okay. Yeah. Too much for a fifth date, and I get that, but okay. Message received."
Tony turns to Bucky. "We're not breaking up, and we're not - nothing bad is happening, okay? Nothing bad is going to happen, and nothing has to
is important to me. I'm sorry I didn't act like it."
look at you and hold your hand and kiss you in the fucking rain.
"Sure, Tony," Steve says, patting him patronizingly on the shoulder as he goes past. "That was definitely what Bucky was talking about."
of things in my life. And I know a ton of people who've done even more things than I've ever dreamed of."
Steve would like to pretend that no, he doesn't know this woman from Eve. But his Ma taught him to be honest even when it hurts, so he grits, "Yeah," because she's vivacious and she's beautiful and she was there.
Steve breathes for one second. Two.
"Was that, um," Steve says.
Bucky's staring intently. And fuck Skype,
"That sounds great, but I may need a raincheck." And fuck Steve, but his voice sounds so tentatively hopeful.
"Oh, screw you both," Steve mutters. He's standing next to Tony now and he won't sit down, but he's close enough for the mic to pick him up so Bucky can hear.
Tony takes a few deep breaths, then deflates. "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Steve scrubs a hand over his face. "That looks even worse."
"Why?" Tony asks.
to him."
"Tony?" Steve says.
"It's okay to be angry at me," Tony says softly, and Steve's head snaps back to stare at him.
is looking at him, wondering what on earth just happened there. Because everyone knows that what it
Because with Tony - if Tony doesn't want this to happen, if he wants both he and Steve to be exclusive, then nothing really changes. Steve and Tony continue dating, they continue hanging out with Bucky, there's no evidence Steve ever even thought about this.
Steve sighs and tips forward, resting his forehead against Tony's sternum. "Yeah," he says, muffled, "I just -
"It's more just," Steve sighs and waves a hand. "I don't know. I just, I tell him everything. And all the big things in our lives - well. Okay. All the big things in
"James Buchanan Barnes," Steve says with as much dignity as he can muster while he's wrestling with the stupid blanket to get himself wrapped up and comfortably settled on the computer chair, "do not mock my blanket-burrito skills. I am cold and wet and I do not need your salt right now."
"Maaaaybe," Steve says, halfway just to be a shit and halfway because he can tell Bucky anything but he's not sure how to verbalize the part of his happiness that's all down to Bucky himself.
"It's okay," Tony says, squeezing his shoulder. He huffs a laugh and says, "Sounds like we were both freaking out about nothing, huh? Okay, so let me just put this out there: I really like you, Steve. The more I get to know you the more I like you. I'd really, really like to see you again. And, yes, I would
He passes the phone back and Tony takes it without looking away from Steve's face. Their fingers brush. Steve pulls his hand back quickly.
by someone like Tony.
about us is inadequate, it's just -"
"I'm so sorry," Steve repeats. "What do I owe you?"
Bucky's still shaking his head. "You seriously watched that movie just to see what I would think about polyamory?"
"Okay," says Steve.
Steve sighs. "I know. Like on an intellectual level, I know that. But I really want to keep dating him."
"What do you mean?" Bucky asks.
Steve laughs. "Really really."
Steve resolves to just deal with this on his own.
"Yeah, sure," Steve snaps. Because even though he'd like to pretend otherwise, he's going to remember everything about that night in HD and surround sound for a long, long time.
It flips: if the three of them were in a polyamorous relationship then that means that more than just Steve and Bucky dating and Steve and Tony dating, Tony and Bucky would be dating too, and Steve knows from very personal experience how extremely protective Bucky is of the people he cares about. Bucky would tell Tony to stand up for himself and demand what he needs, too.
"You're perfect," Tony says. Steve's mouth clicks shut. Tony blinks and shakes himself and says, "Sorry. Too much? Sorry. I think I said that before right? I mean to. Because you are. Perfect, I mean. Not, not because I have like a kink or something, don't think that I like PLANNED earlier, because I didn't, I swear -"
"It's all right," Tony says.
"You're perfect," Tony says again, then kisses him. It stops the building hysteria of the situation, both of them sucking in a breath against each other's lips, and Tony breathes out into him, "Really fucking perfect."
"One way to find out," someone else says, snatching the phone.
"This is
"Nah," says Steve. "I've
"I didn't mean to!" Steve laughs. "We've known each other since before we can remember, Tony, it wasn't that hard for him to figure out that I'd finally slept with someone. I didn't even SAY anything, he just -"
"Yes," Steve says before Tony's even done talking.
And everyone else starts laughing and yelling and the person sitting beside Tony claps him on the back and someone on the other side of the table throws a straw at him. Tony's laughing behind his hands, and everyone else is pointing and teasing and saying things like, "I never thought I'd live to see this day!" and "You actually
Tony's not looking at him, either. "It's okay to be angry at me. I get it. I'm sorry. Did I mention that before? I am. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -"
what's going on.
Some of them actually pull out their wallets. And all of them are laughing.
"Right. That's good. So I'm pretty sure Bucky would be on board with this -"
made of glass. You're made of steel and sunshine, Steve. You're strong and stubborn and scary-smart and there's just something about you that clicks with something about me. You're completely incredible, and you're gorgeous, and for some reason you let
"Or you can take more time to think about it," Tony hurries to say. "Or we can call more people. Just to, you know, make sure my mortification is utter and complete. Whatever you want."
"Right!" Tony says, clapping his hands and making both Bucky and Steve jump. "I know we were going to watch The Losers, but I'm suddenly in the mood for Cloud Atlas instead. Thoughts?"
it, because Bucky's looking at Steve's face on his screen so his eyes look like they're closed and Steve can't
The Blank Stare is on in full force, but it falls apart when Bucky meets Steve's eyes. It may only be for a split second, but that's long enough for Steve to see how worried and on-edge Bucky is. Close to panicking, even.
"Okay. You recognize her?" Tony fishes out his phone, taps the screen twice (holding it low enough for Steve to see that all he does is navigate to his favorite contacts), and holds out a contact with a picture.
Also mostly on reflex Steve says, "My two favorite alternate personalities."
He smiles, and he looks good. Steve was worried, very worried, that being in the Army would take away that smile, but it hasn't yet. Everything in the frame is dun-colored except for his eyes and his lips: his clothes, his skin, his hat, the tent wall behind him, the dirt beneath his nails, the other soldiers walking and lounging in the background. Sometimes Steve wonders if anyone else over there notices it, how Bucky stands out with splotches of color against a monochrome backdrop, but then he remembers that Bucky stands out the same way in the greys of New York and knows that no one does.
Steve flings himself across the room. Bucky laughs and drops his rucksack and catches him and the momentum sends them spinning, Steve's feet swinging off the floor.
"Hey," he says quietly, gently cupping Steve's cheek and running his thumb over his cheekbone, "are you okay?"
Tony blinks at him, then blinks again. He looks so startled it breaks Steve's heart. Not just for how badly he himself failed Tony, but for how badly Tony must be used to being treated.
"Yep," Tony says proudly, popping the P. Steve decides he's earned it.
, but the height difference is enough that he'd need Tony to tip his head down a bit more, and Steve doesn't quite have the guts right now to pull him.
Twenty minutes later there's a knock on the door. Filled with apprehension, Steve holds a finger up to Bucky, then goes to answer it. He opens the door, and there's Tony.
They both just stand there for a moment.
Tony just says, "Thanks, proved my point,
"Kinky," Bucky and Tony say at the same time, then burst into startled laughter.
"You didn't tell him that either, did you," Bucky says, calm and matter-of-fact. "He has no idea you'd never slept with anyone before."
Steve wants it so much and so viscerally it makes him dizzy.
After a moment of looking at him expectantly, the guy shrugs and sips his own drink. "Worth a shot," he says.
They smile at each other some more.
Steve takes Tony's hand, and though Tony doesn't say anything Steve can tell he's surprised.
you, Jesus Christ I cannot believe I lost a bet to
"Tony." And he holds out his hand.
"Wait a sec," Tony says. His shoulder nudges at Steve's head until he tilts his face back so they can see each other. Tony - does not look happy right now. "Are you and Bucky a thing?"
look vaguely familiar - up till now Steve assumed it was because he probably looked like a movie star or something, but now he thinks he's seen that goatee somewhere before.
"All right," Steve says as soon as Tony gets there, kissing him briefly and then dragging him over to the table where he's got a sheaf of papers laid out. "Here are all of our options. Plans Echo through Romeo involve a two-pronged attack while options Golf, India, and Tango require props, but -"
He jumps to his feet, tugging on Steve's hand. "C'mon, let's dance!"
change tonight. You need to think this through,
, okay. On that front I have no idea. But in general? Yeah. I wouldn't write it off."
Steve doesn't realize how far forward he's leaned until Tony pulls back minutely. He looks at Steve's eyes, then his lips, then his eyes again. He squeezes Steve's shoulder again then takes a deliberate step back, pulling himself and Steve out of each other's hands.
"You told Bucky?" Tony asks. He doesn't sound pissed off, though, just curious.
Tony's holding very still, his hand like a vice around Steve's. He takes a deep, shuddering breath and says, "Yeah. Yeah. Same," through clenched teeth, and Steve suddenly remembers through his self-centered humiliation-slash-afterglow that Tony's still hard.
what I call a hello."
Steve huffs a nervous laugh and puts a hand on Tony's shoulder for balance, and then he presses their lips together again. Tony makes a little noise in his throat and Steve gasps, his other hand coming up to Tony's hair. Tony's lips move, tugging on his own gently, and there's a taste of coffee and sunshine and
"Can't promise it won't be a bit gross," Steve says honestly, and laughs at the look of disgust on Tony's face. "I promise it's not slimy and that it won't stain, though. Tip your head back."
The next day after work they go out for coffee, because Steve figures it's best to keep it simple. They meet in the lobby and walk together, and the whole way Steve can't help but sneak glances up at Tony, like he's still not quite sure this is real. Most of the time he ends up catching Tony's eye because he's already looking at Steve, and then they both look away quickly but it's fun anyway.
"Because!" Steve says, throwing his hands up. "I just told you! I'm not a child and I'm not made of glass! Just because I'm short and I've got asthma -"
He turns his face away, makes to get up again, and Tony doesn't say a word or make a move to stop him, but -
gotten attention from someone like Tony. Much less gotten
"There's nothing to fix!"
"Good," says Tony. "If you die on him I'll resurrect you and kill you myself."
"That's - um. That's great. Okay. So I'll text you? Oh, no, bad idea, no, I'll just -"
The problem with doing that, though, is that he has a terrible time
Takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry," Steve says. He still can't bring himself to look at Tony, too ashamed to look anywhere other than his own hands.
Then Steve doubles over in laughter and Tony throws his head back to join, and they're probably getting weird looks but, oddly, Steve just doesn't care.
That is not the case with Bucky. Because with Bucky the big question isn't whether or not he'd like to date Tony - yes or no, either way won't upset the balance of the universe. No, with Bucky the big question is whether or not he'd like to date STEVE. Steve, whom he's been friends with since they were tiny. Steve, whom he's never shown any inclination towards. Steve, so scrawny and bland that most people don't even notice him. That Steve.
It tapers off after a moment and they just breathe. Then Tony huffs a laugh against his lips and says, "Now
Steve shakes his head with a sharp breath. "That's
"Stevie?" Bucky says.
Tony gasps.
He's barely got time to clean up and throw on some sweat pants before his computer chimes with an incoming Skype call. He snags an afghan off his bed (the cream-colored one Bucky got him from Barnes & Nobel for Christmas three years ago, because that is
Tony's shaking his head. "Nope. We haven't talked about having an open relationship at all, but I for one think it would be best to keep it undeniably closed until everything settles, one way or another. If we want to revisit that at a later date, fine, but let's table that whole thing for right now."
"I'm not going to do that, Tony."
The next morning Bucky sends a text to both of them saying, Count me in.
He turns, and the guy next to him is looking - kind of in his direction, actually. Steve looks behind himself, and yeah, there's no one else there even kind of facing them.
Steve stares at him, at the depth of emotion pooling in Tony's wild, dark eyes, and forgets everything about himself long enough to pull Tony down to keep kissing him.
"Darcy!" says Tony. "Darcy, Darce, my dear, my darling, if I were to say the word 'Steve' -"
hang up' fight."
Then he holds out his phone to Steve.
Tony says, "But you
"Okay," says Tony. He sighs, and his hands loosen on Steve's shoulders, his thumb distractedly rubbing the side of his neck. "Look, I'm - not the best person out there, okay? And I haven't exactly treated everyone well, you know?"
It's Friday and not that late, barely after dinner, really, so Tony hangs out for a while. They're curled up on the couch, and Steve doesn't know how to bring it up. He's toying with the edge of Tony's sleeve to avoid his eye, and for a while Tony just goes with it.
"Yeah," says Tony. "Signif. Short for significant, shorter for significant other. S.O. Main squeeze. Your bae, your boo, partner, live-in ordinary person, lover, spouse -"
He sees both Tony and Bucky over the course of the next two days, though thankfully not at the same time. Bucky's settling in to his new apartment and Tony's busy with something at work, though he still makes a lot of time for Steve.
Two days before their next call Steve gets an unusually long email from Bucky. It contains every conceivable detail of every single little thing that's happened to him, near him, or within his sphere of experience in the last month. At the end of it Bucky writes, "There! Now I have LITERALLY NOTHING left to talk about next time. It's all you."
Tony's mouth drops open and his eyes are blown wide. Steve can see his pulse thudding in his throat, and wonders how hard his heart must be thundering for the sudden change to be so visible.
After a beat Tony facepalms.
"Probably to a sex offender hotline," someone else says. Everyone laughs, even Tony.
The anger doesn't rush out of him so much as it moves to his chest and throat and face and though it still feels hot and tight now it also feels shuddery and broken, like all the things Steve's been thinking and feeling are about to shatter and push out of him. All at once he's thrown back to that time on the porch, the one and only time they've had something like sex, when he was so overwhelmed by everything and so flooded with endorphins he almost started crying, and all at once it feels like he's right back there.
Tony shrugs, and reaches out hesitantly. When Steve doesn't jerk away he puts a hand on Steve's shoulder, moving his thumb gently against Steve's collarbone. "I'd want to because you're right; you're
Quickly, he kneels down to pick it up, then carries it in his cupped palms, making sure Tony can't see what it is. Tony's looking at him curiously and Steve comes to a stop right in front of his knees.
"I'm gonna fight him."
It only rings once before she picks up with, "Tony? What happened?"
Steve tugs his hand until he leans down enough for Steve to kiss him, then kiss him again.
No one has EVER been able to get Steve to dance before, but - if ever he were going to dance with someone it'd be Tony. Well, if ever he were going to let someone teach him to dance, it'd be either Tony or Bucky, so.
Steve smiles and shakes his head, leaning and twisting a bit. "Sorry. Just. Awkward angle."
So he's decided that rather than deal with any of it, he is simply not going to sleep.
That seems to knock Tony out of it. He shakes his head and smiles a little, ruefully, stepping forward and holding out his hand. "Hey, Bucky," he says.
"Hey," Steve says, moving forward a bit and putting a hand on Tony's waist. Tony stops talking and looks down at him with wide, hopeful eyes. "That, um. That sounds really great. We should, ah, actually probably talk if we're going to do anything anyway, so - and I mean, I'm sorry for pressuring you and making you uncomfortable -"
He rounds the corner and pulls out his phone.
Steve's still skeptical that Tony's this desperate to go out with him, of course, but he's
"Oh, what the heck are you talking about?"
"I'll, um, I'll get you a chair," Steve says awkwardly, completely unsure what to do with himself. Tony doesn't object to Steve leaving the room.
A moment passes.
, and it wouldn't even regenerate in this universe!"
Steve gets halfway back to their table before he realizes his face is probably still red. He doesn't know how to deal with Sam and Nat. No idea what to say.
Steve asks, "What was your next question?"
Then Tony takes a deep breath, holds it, lets it out, and says, "Steve. Is this about what happened earlier?"
"You're amazing," Tony breathes, and then he pulls back far enough to look down at him with wide-blown, dazed eyes, one hand tilting his face up towards his own with a thumb on the corner of his lips, and he just keeps saying over and over again, "you're amazing, you're so fantastic, you're, you're just so, and I -"
Rather than reassure him that Tony will definitely come back (which Steve could easily drag out into another argument and use up the remainder of their time), instead Bucky says, "Look, call him now, okay? That way if he doesn't come back then at least I can keep talking to you for a while."
Steve glares at him for a second. Tony just looks back, all hopefulness and sincerity. Finally Steve sighs and snaps, "Fine.
"Tony, Tony," Steve says, catching his flailing hand and holding it to his chest. "I know. It's okay, all right? I know."
He doesn't, actually, but he needs to think, and also he knows this part of the script, too.
Steve whirls. He's still holding Tony's hand, and Bucky's there, right there, standing in the open doorway with a rucksack over his shoulder, looking at Steve all tentative and hopeful, and yes, yes, this is it, this is everything Steve ever wanted in one room.
Bucky, though.
you decide to grow some self-esteem and actually
Steve's caught between laughter and horror, because Bucky's caught between joking and dead serious. "Wait, wait, wait!" Steve says. "Lemme finish the story! See, this is why I said it didn't make a good cliffhanger."
"Well," Steve says.
"Tony!" Steve catches his hand and his eye and holds him steady. He hadn't realized before how nervous Tony was about this and is kicking himself for it. "Shall we not get into a fight over which of us could and could not get Bucky to cheat on the other."
"Look," Tony says, clearly trying not to laugh at Steve's shock. "I did say we email. And no, I'm not going to tell you anything we talk about, any more than I would give Bucky all the details of
They end up swapping Bro Stories (Tony's words): Steve tells him about all the fistfights Bucky fought at his side, and Tony tells him about all of Rhodey's (largely unsuccessful) attempts to keep him out of trouble at MIT. And his (much more successful) attempts to get Tony OUT of trouble once he was already in it.
That is, he does reasonably well until a week later, when he decides to go to the library after work. He's a block away from the building when he hears someone behind him shout, "Steve!"
"All right," Tony says, oblivious to the fact that Steve's just realigned his life's goals towards making sure they all end up together. "Moving on from there. Yes, I like Bucky as well. Yes, I could like him in a romantic kind of way. You're my priority, though. So far as getting together goes, you're it for me. However, realize that if we did get into a polyamorous relationship, you would BOTH be my priority, okay? Assuming you want a relationship and not just a one-night stand, I mean."
Evidence in favor of Steve just not being all that attractive: every interaction with strangers his entire life.
Tony cards his fingers through Steve's hair, sucks in a breath, holds it, lets it out. Steve's preparing for him to say something awful, and he's kind of right, because what Tony says is, "Why didn't you ask me to stay? I would have stayed. Steve, please tell me you didn't think you couldn't ask me to stay."
Steve doesn't want to. He runs through every excuse he can muster, from I don't know what he's doing right now, he could be busy, his phone might not even be on, and finally Bucky says, "Steve, if he's not the type who'd come back for you, you shouldn't let him come back at all."
After a second he manages to remember that he can't just stand there staring off in the direction Tony went all night, so he turns to collect the drinks from the bar. It takes a bit of doing to carry three drinks in awkwardly-shaped glasses in only two hands, and by the time he's got them situated he's ready to die of embarrassment.
All right? But yes, Steve and I have been talking, and we've been talking about asking you if you'd like to be in a polyamorous relationship with us."
*********************
being comfortable with the idea - at least he is until dinner actually happens. Steve's so caught up in imagining the three of them together he quickly loses track of the conversation, and the words don't make it quite into his brain but what happens is Bucky says something kind and protective to Tony, and Tony just stares at his plate and blinks and his cheeks turn just the tiniest bit dusky and Steve is so overwhelmed with how much he
"That's great," Steve says. "Bucky and I always talked about getting a dorm together when we graduated, but it - didn't really work out that way."
- God, Tony, I don't - And you're not some, some, some consolation-prize second-best - I'd
"It's just Bucky," Tony says, and smiles. "I know. Believe me, I get it."
"Bucky, Bucky, Bucky!" Steve's hollering, pounding him on the back, and Bucky's laughing hysterically with his arms like titanium bands around Steve's back and his face buried in Steve's neck. The laughter hitches in Bucky's throat and that's when it hits him that Bucky is
the one who brought up the idea in the first place. Though didn't say so explicitly, he's implied pretty heavily that he's been involved in polyamorous relationships before and would be open to being in one again.
. It's like a magic trick.
*********************
"Okay," Tony whispers. His eyes are on Steve's lips.
"My - My signif?" Steve splutters.
in a way he isn't over the computer, and then Steve's got his hands fisted in Bucky's shirt and hair and he's trying not to start crying too.
Steve laughs into his drink, too wrong-footed and happy to think about what just happened.
"Okay," Tony says. He takes a shaky breath, then looks away, laughing. It doesn't sound happy. "Sorry. I'm freaking out here."
it. How could Bucky leave him and go so far away? How could Bucky not be here when Steve needs him; how could Bucky be so far away that it's hard to explain
"So!" Steve says without further ado. "So the other night I was out with Nat and Sam and I go up to order drinks, and this idiot kept like nudging into me at the bar..."
freaking out right now. Steve would kiss him, wants to
, here and solid and warm around him and
"Oh my God did he text you back?" she shrieks.
It's gratifying because Tony's reaction is much the same, drawing back and his shoulders hunching. His face shuttering. "What? Why?"
Tony sings the last bit of the song with his head thrown back and his eyes closed, and Steve holds him more tightly. There's a smile on Tony's lips when he opens his eyes. It takes Steve a moment to realize that Tony's frozen and not looking at him anymore. He's looking at something behind him, with this look on his face that Steve can't parse, and before he can even turn around he hears -
He's gone very still, and he's looking at Steve like he's about to explode. But he doesn't say anything after that, so Steve gives him a second, then says, "Were you gonna follow that up with something?"
"I can -" Steve starts, but Tony shakes his head.
"Buck," Steve says, trying not to sound too gentle. "We've both talked about it at length. It was -
Steve chuckles and pulls back. Tony's smiling, but his eyes are worried.
Bucky doesn't move for a moment and Steve thinks the connection froze, but then Bucky nods a bit and relaxes back in his chair. He smirks. "Something good happen, Stevie?"
"Well," Steve starts, but Tony shoots him a quelling glance, and for once in his life Steve listens.
to the guy -"
"Oh my god," Tony interrupts. "Oh my god. Oh my
They both just stand there for a moment. Steve doesn't know what to do with his hands.
say, like Hammer, that ass) Steve is, in fact, tall enough to see over the counter. He's just not big enough to catch the barkeep's eye quickly. Nor is he big enough to maneuver through the crowd quickly on his way up, and half the time he ends up getting jostled so much on his way back one or more of the drinks will spill. It's not that people are cruel to him, exactly, it's that they just - don't notice him.
and he suddenly sees what Tony meant about Bucky maybe being more open to the idea of this than Steve was giving him credit for.
True to his expectations and despite his best efforts, they do figure it out. Well, part of it, anyway. He won't tell them Tony's name, because they love him and he knows what they'd do. That, and they think Tony was just stringing Steve along for a while; don't realize that Steve fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Don't realize that there was an entire table full of people laughing their heads off at him.
Bucky's reactions are more than Steve could have wished for. He glares at Steve's self-deprecation, whistles and awards points for Tony's flirting, and groans when Steve says he thought he and Tony were heading to the bathroom at the same time. Steve would think Bucky's hamming it up, except he can read Bucky like a large-print book he's already got memorized, so he can tell it's all genuine. Steve gets to the part where he overheard Tony and his friends, and it doesn't hurt nearly so much now. He thought he'd end up glossing over that part, but the more he talks the more he understands what he actually heard, and he ends up repeating the whole thing word-for-word just for his own benefit.
, and Steve can't help how intently he's watching them. It's the only reason he notices the way Tony's shoulders drop with that laugh, like he's - relaxing.
The night is warm and muggy, but not the sort of sticky that makes him feel gross just by standing outside. They walk through the darkness, streetlights yellow overhead and blocking the stars. Steve wants to take Tony's hand but doesn't. He also doesn't notice how quiet Tony is, because Steve is quiet, too. He's working himself up for what he's going to say when they get to his apartment.
Steve's stomach drops to somewhere around his shoes.
Steve studies him for a second, and yeah. Tony doesn't look like he's about to do anything like that. He just looks so calm, so -
"Steve," Tony says, putting a hand on his shoulder. Steve looks up and finds Tony pensive and serious. "Look. I don't know why, but other people say that what I'm about to tell you is super important, and it seems to work for them. Also it's the opposite of my usual modus operandi and nothing ever works out for me, so. Maybe they're on to something, right? So. I'd like to - go slow. If that's. Okay. I mean in order to go slow that means you actually have to want to see me again, which, yeah, kind of making assumptions here, and you know what they say about that -"
"Hold on," Bucky snaps. He stands up and a moment later the image blurs, and Steve watches with dizzying perspective as Bucky takes the laptop out into the baking sun so he can lose his mind at Steve in peace.
"Steven Grant Rogers," Bucky says, smiling too wide to be stern. "I know you're just pulling my leg, because I don't think I've ever seen you this besotted before. You do realize that now if you don't go out with him again the bitch I'll be deserting to come choke is YOU, right, you punk?"
Without another word Tony hits call, puts it on speakerphone, and holds it between them so he can talk into the mic and they can both hear.
People who look like Tony don't talk to people like Steve, much less ask them out. But Tony does and Tony did, so. Evidence points to the contrary. Evidence upsetting their worldviews just happened right in front of their collective attractive faces, and really Steve almost can't blame them for staring. But only almost.
ya get me?"
"And if we don't even
to talk to Bucky about Tony. Honestly dying. And there's something that isn't the worst thing about Bucky being overseas, not by a long shot, but it's one of those little things that he didn't know was going to happen until Bucky was already gone, and it's this: he needs to plan out when and how to tell Bucky. He can't just wait till the next time he sees him. He can't just text him and tell him they're hanging out. He can't just go to Sam or Nat's and find Bucky already there. He can't just -
Tony leads them to another cafe a block further down the road that to Steve looks basically the same as Starbucks. He says as much, and arguing about coffee and cafes and local startups and hipsters lasts them through getting their drinks and a table.
like Tony asked him out on a dare or a bet or something doesn't mean -
"Okay. So you wanted to lose your virginity to him?" Tony doesn't sound put out in the least, nor gleeful; simply honestly curious.
"That's good, Stevie. That's real good," Bucky says quietly.
It's a whole one step from where they're standing to the actual door into the building, but Tony takes his hand and walks him over anyway. Steve hooks an arm around Tony's neck and pulls him down and kisses his cheek, whispering, "That's it. Don't let me kiss you again, or I just won't stop."
"That is the dumbest fucking excuse I've ever heard!" Bucky shouts.
"No, look, he knows how important this is to me, and he reminded me and said he should probably go, and I didn't ask him to stay."
"Both, I guess," Bucky admits with a laugh. "I had no idea either of you were in the market for a third."
No. No. Steve is
Everyone starts laughing again, and the other guy picks it up, his face going exaggeratedly surprised. "A phone number! Doth mine eyes deceive or did the bastard get a fucking phone number!"
Steve can't bring himself to look at him, but they're close enough that he can feel the movement of it when Tony shrugs. "I want to be with you," Tony says simply. "Even if you can't or don't want to open up to me all the way, just - let me know where you are so I can be with you, all right?"
“No, no, that was...perfect, thank you. A wonderful end to a wonderful evening.”
Two o'clock finds him staring at a half-finished page; his pen is poised above the panel, but Steve makes no move to actually put ink to paper. He glances at the clock again, sighs, and lets the pen clatter to his desk. He can feel Pietro's questioning gaze from where the younger man is sitting on top of his own work-table. Everyone has asked Steve if he’s okay multiple times during the day; at lunch, he overheard Kate and Clint talking in the breakroom, wondering amongst themselves if Brock has made a reappearance in Steve’s life. It’s been years, but Steve is still surprised at the lack of post-breakup pain at the mention of his ex-boyfriend.
“Sounds good to me. But… can we just stay like this for a bit? I, uh, I've missed being able to hold you.”
Things have gotten slightly easier when Clint shows up at his door one rainy morning. Steve isn’t really in the mood for company, but he’s been alone for so long, he can’t take the constant silence any more. So he steps aside and lets Clint in. Clint stays by the door until Steve comes back from the bathroom with a towel. He busies himself with grabbing two glasses from the cupboard and filling them with water while his visitor dries off. If Clint has a negative opinion of the sparse decoration, lack of television, or limited amount of secondhand furniture, he doesn’t voice it, just perches carefully on the couch in what appears to be an attempt to lessen any water damage to the fabric. Steve listens without speaking as Clint tells him about the missions he’s been on for SHIELD, making sure to keep things vague so as not to violate the confidentiality clause in his contract.
“I do.”
“Yes, because leaving him on my doorstep with a threat of killing me if something happened to him wasn’t thrusting him into my life at all,” he deadpans.
Steve jerks away from Tony, stumbling in his haste to separate their bodies; Pepper’s face is white with splotches of angry red high on her cheekbones. Her pale eyes are narrowed with rage. File folders lay in a jumbled pile at her feet, papers splayed out on the concrete. She takes a step forward, not seeming to care that her heels are wrinkling and tearing holes in the papers. Steve smoothes down his shirt, pushes his hair out of his face, ignores the heat in his cheeks as he meets Pepper’s furious gaze.
Tony just gazes at him steadily, which just makes the whole thing worse. He doesn't look upset, which he should, since Steve - god. He hangs his head, confused and ashamed and sorry and embarrassed and utterly miserable, and flinches when Tony puts his hand on his arm as though the feel of Steve will hurt Tony worse.
"So, what, then?" Tony says conversationally, like he's not really going to explain what he just said. He settles back comfortably and tugs Steve close, though Steve stays sitting up enough for them to look at each other. "You want to do it where he could like maybe hear us or something? Because I gotta say, I am not in favor of voyeurism normally, like at all, but that's really only in public or with strangers. For friends and mega-friends I could be totally down, as long as everyone involved knew what they were getting into -"
Aghast, Steve starts, "Tony -"
do not have to take it upon yourself to make things special for
The key goes into the lock with minimal fumbling after that, and just before he closes the door Steve turns around and says, "I really like you, Tony. I can't wait to see you again."
Tony shakes his head and looks down at his phone. "I have no idea what he was going on about. Peter's his fiancé, for Chrissake."
attractive. He's facing the barkeep, too, and his hand is resting on the bar close enough that it's brushing Steve's.
Only one ring and a far-too-cheerful voice says, "Toooooony! Sexiest goatee alive! To what do I owe the masturbatory fantasy of
His face flaming hot and with a sudden gall Steve doesn't know the origins of, Steve holds Tony's eye and says, "Did I ride your leg like a teenager while you kissed me into coming? Yep. That is a thing that happened."
"That's - Tony, that's incredible," Steve says.
"I dare you."
"Well," Steve starts.
The man chuckles. "It was all very complicated. We drew up a contract and everything. Jane has it somewhere, or maybe Loki, so I don't have all the details."
"Nope. Nope. It's good. Please don't offer. I want to - I want both of us one hundred percent on the same page when that happens, and right now is not. Not the time. So. Yeah. I'll, um. I'll see you later, okay?"
to figure it out and it stresses him out and makes him snappy and irritable - and being around Tony or Bucky just makes it worse. Usually if Steve is stressed or jittery being around one of them will calm him down, like they can smooth out the sharp edges of the world, but now all seeing either of them does is remind him about what it is he's stressing over in the first place.
"No, no, I clearly interrupted," Bucky starts, but Tony cuts him off with, "But you just got back! You guys should -"
Steve smiles for a solid seven hours. He only stops that night because he falls asleep.
"Sorry," he says, cutting himself off mid-word. "I didn't mean to dominate the conversation like that."
"Pay up! Come on! You owe me!" some of them yell.
"Yes," Steve says. "I'll talk to you later."
"What are you talking about?" Tony says. He comes a step forward, his hands still up, like he's coaxing a wild animal out of a snare. Steve glares, and he stops moving.
"Eventually, sure," Steve says. "In the meantime, could you - What do you think of all this? What are you feeling? I'm sorry for not asking sooner."
"We really don't," Steve says, emphatic and feeling very foolish.
Steve sighs. "It looks like we're cheating."
"Yep, yep, I see what you're saying, Barnes," Tony nods, plopping down in the chair and putting his hands on his knees. "That's definitely a sound proposition. Rogers? Thoughts?"
"What, no," Tony says before Steve can, which is a relief until he continues, "*I* should leave YOU guys to it, so I'll see you tomorrow -"
You didn't think you could ask him to stay, huh, Bucky says in Steve's head.
The non-sequitur throws Steve. For a second he just stands there with his mouth open, laughing and startled and off-balance in the best possible way, and then he scrapes together two brain cells to say something at least KIND OF flirty back and says, "I honestly don't see how I could not, now."
Tony looks like he's expecting more, then he says hesitantly, "When - when I asked you out -?"
A while later they're drifting, pressed close and twined around each other, and Steve's trying to keep himself awake. He doesn't know what happens when they start falling asleep - does Tony leave? Does Steve ask him to stay? If he does, is it to sleep together literally or figuratively? Should he assume Tony'd share his bed, or should he offer the couch? - and no matter which way Steve swings it, it's a minefield.
When Steve does freak out about it, though, he freaks out
"Good," Tony chuckles, and his breath ruffles the hair at Steve's temple.
And Steve? Has never once in his
"No, no, no." Tony waves a hand. He's been leaning back in his chair, sipping his drink and smiling, for at least, what, five minutes? Maybe ten? Christ, he'd looked interested, but maybe he was just bored. He says, "No, it's good. I like hearing about things that matter to you so much. And it's good that you have someone like him. You know, who you've been friends with for so long."
Yeah, Steve's pretty sure he's not going to have much in the way of jealousy, he thinks as he tries to adjust himself without calling attention to it, at least as far as the physical goes.
"You're gonna see him again, right?" Bucky says.
he liked Tony until this moment. He also hadn't realized how much he'd
"I don't understand," Bucky says at last. "It's just so - It's so out of left field."
"Well yeah," Tony says. "I am impatient. We all know this."
"That looks even worse, yep. I don't want to put him in that situation."
Steve is more than fine with taking more time for Tony to get comfortable with
"Let me buy you a drink," the guy says, his smile growing wider. "I realize you don't know me from Adam, but hey, free booze is free booze, right?"
how I wanted this to happen," Steve says, rubbing a hand over his face. Then he decides to just buck up and take it, so he snags Tony's hand and drags him over to his desk.
Steve shrugs, looks at the floor, screams
Steve smiles. "Me, too."
At first Steve's smug, but after a little while Tony hasn't moved and Steve's starting to think maybe smugness isn't what he should be feeling right now. The embarrassment comes crashing back over him and he could cut out his own tongue for saying something so pathetic. "Tony? Um, say something -"
calling
"Good night, Steve," Tony says, and then he turns and walks down the steps into the dark. Steve stands there with the door half-open until, just before Tony's footsteps fade into the night, he hears someone whistling. He thinks it's Tony, and he also thinks it's Your Song.
Because he's just realized
"I'll unblock you," Steve promises. Only partially because it's logistically necessary, but mostly because in among all the shock it's finally getting to him that Tony really
it! You fucking dickwad!" and "I can't believe you actually talked to him!"
coffee and Steve doesn't actually mean literal coffee anyway.
Steve has
"Of course not!" Steve splutters, choking on air, sitting up and waving his arms around, unable to physically or verbally convey just how much NO he means. "I would never - He's my
"Well we do!" Steve says defensively, and it seems to be Tony's reaction that's finally knocked Bucky back into the present. That, or clued him in that Steve meant it and this wasn't some kind of weird joke.
So Steve does, going all the way to the end of his contacts and picking one of the last ones. Tony hits call as he looks to see who it is, and he simultaneously laughs and groans when he sees, putting a hand to his forehead. "This is either going to be really awesome really, really awful, and I don't know which is more likely."
? Later. And we can do something."
cannot
"Oh," Steve says.
Tony doesn't act like he realizes what just happened - which is good, because Steve's so dizzy with endorphins he's half a second from bursting into tears in mortification - he just tugs away from Steve's lips so Steve can breathe easier, and presses kisses against his cheeks and neck and jaw and eyes and anything he can reach while his arms hold Steve to him tight, tight.
"Nope," Steve says firmly. "I refuse to let either of you leave - I will nail the door shut if I have to. There's more than enough left from dinner and I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, Buck. So let's get you a plate while you explain what in the hell you're doing here, and then we can all have dessert and put in a movie or something."
"Huh," Steve says. Tony had said that he'd been thinking about this for a while, but Steve hadn't realized he'd been thinking about it since before Bucky even got back. "Wait a minute," Steve says. "You bought that movie the day you came over for dinner. Did you know Bucky was coming home?"
Neither of them moves.
The song, Steve recognizes after a moment, is Unchained Melody, and Tony's warm and solid in his arms, his shoulder firm beneath Steve's hand and his own hand warm around Steve's, and it's perfect. Steve can't stop smiling. Tony gazes down at him, clearly giddy himself, and starts singing along with the song in a hideous falsetto. Steve groans and buries his face in Tony's chest, but after a minute they're back to gazing at each other and smiling and Tony's still singing. He's actually got a good voice. Steve's knees might give out from under him but for the fact that Tony's got an arm about his waist.
Again Steve shakes his head, but this time it's to clear the cobwebs. He looks at Tony, and when Tony smiles tentatively at him, can't help but lean forward and kiss him. Tony's smile is much more pleased and much more genuine after that.
He hated it, knowing Bucky was looking at him even though his eyes were downcast, that strange disconnect even when they could see and hear each other. He hated that Bucky up and left him to go so far away.
"Have we met?" Steve finally asks. Because that's a reasonable explanation, right? Maybe this is some kid Steve went to high school with whom he doesn't recognize. Or something. And he
Tony lets out a startled laugh. The lines of this man are
Yes, it's just Bucky. But suddenly it's not just that Steve's apparently wanted Bucky subconsciously for god only knows how long - now it's that Tony hasn't been cared for nearly as much as he should have been, and Steve may be shit at this but Bucky sure isn't. He never knew it was possible to want something so much until he thinks of Bucky pouring all the attention and care he's capable of on Tony the way Tony deserves, and Tony soaking it up and appreciating it the way BUCKY deserves.
The first snowfall of winter Tony pulls Steve into his arms, and they dance.
"Yeah," he says. "I've known Rhodey since I was fourteen, actually. He's my oldest friend. We bunked together at college."
"You got him to swear!" Tony says to Bucky. "Do you know how long I've been trying to do that?"
*********************
"Yeah," Steve laughs, "something good."
"Not as long as I have. Trust me, buddy."
"That makes no sense," Steve says, leaning back in his chair and trying to pull his hand free from Tony's grasp. "Besides, I can't dance."
) he gets home. Not ever. Because -) Again, though, because he has to think about things like this now, he knows he has to tell the story through to the end the first time. He can't stop halfway through and leave Bucky thinking Tony's a terrible person. So their next Skype call, after their general catching-up, Steve says, "I have a story to tell you, but it's really, really long, so if we don't have another half an hour at least I'm not going to even start it."
