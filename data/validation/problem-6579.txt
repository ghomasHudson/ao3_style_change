She moved toward him, bringing him into the break room and shutting the door. Her hands were just as delicate and tiny as he remembered; she still wore the ring he gave her years ago. The sight made him nauseous and sad and angry all at once. But she was sad, and even after everything that happened in New York, he didn't have the heart to pull his hands away from hers.
Steve knew better than to question her; though he didn't know her, she seemed to know more about the woman's case than he did. The rest of the interns followed suit as they were all lead into the trauma room.
She gripped his hand. "I'm so scared all the time. I can't sleep or eat or breathe, Steve. We've been here for almost a month. I thought she was getting better, but now..."
“Drink some water and go home, Tony. You’re drunk,” Steve said through gritted teeth. He willed himself to be patient, trying not to clench his fists.
“Don’t want breakfast.” Steve’s finally out of the blankets, but still sprawled out in bed. “Want you here instead.”
He couldn't help but think about Pepper. How pretty she was. No, she wasn't pretty; she was beautiful. Surreal, in a way. Even when she was soaked in blood after getting cuts from a car accident, she was still beautiful. She looked like a movie star right at eight in the morning, as if she didn't need much sleep to look as flawless as she did. Her eyes were blue like his, but hers were different. They were brighter, like clear water at the beach. She wasn't pretty, she was breathtaking.
The intern stumbled back, dazed and looking nauseous. Still, he grinned when Steve locked eyes with him. "That all you got, pretty boy? Didn't think you'd have the balls to do anything."
The accusation along with the looks on his friends’ faces brought Steve to tears with laughter. The interns glanced at each other tentatively, suddenly confused. Steve could barely catch his breath.
It was easier said than done. The poor lovesick blond managed about a week and a half of his fool-proof plan before the other interns saw him accepting a cup of coffee from Tony.
Now it felt like Steve's first day at the hospital, with the wondering and daydreaming about the handsome man in his bed the other night. He tried to focus while Wilson was updating them on the post-op patients they needed to check on while he was in surgery, but his eyes wandered to Tony, who was at the nurses' station. There was a stern, irritating look on his face as he held a phone to his ear. He wasn't exactly quiet in his argument with whoever was on the phone with him. Steve tried to catch the bits and pieces of the conversation in the midst of Wilson lecturing.
Some verbal agreement came out of his mouth, but he felt like he was dreaming. This had to be some nightmare. He slept with his boss. It wouldn't have mattered if Tony just worked at the hospital with him, but he was his boss. The worst part was that he wanted to see him again, but that was out of the question.
"Please, listen to me." Tears fell from her eyes now. "That's why I came all the way out here. I wanted to make things right. A-and your father, he's worried about the hospital—"
Tony furrowed his brows. "We own the tower—" He immediately shut his mouth once he saw his husband and Peter giggling together.
When the two arrived at the grocery store, Steve felt a little nostalgic. The store was right around the corner from where Steve grew up, and after all these years, it was kept mostly the same. There was some fresh paint on the wall this time, but the aisle signs were still old and faded as they were when he was in high school. The owners of the store, the Bautistas, ran over to Steve as he walked in the door. They had only heard about Steve's medical school tales from his mother, and they were in disbelief to see that the little boy who ran around the aisles was finally a grown up.
The blond sighed and clapped a hand on his friend's shoulder. "I know. Maybe...I'll call her and see her tomorrow."
Steve sat back down on the floor. What was he supposed to do? Was he supposed to wake him up? Should he kick him out? Should he make him breakfast? Did he even have his phone number? He's a fucking Calvin Klein model, and if Steve remembered last night correctly, he wouldn't mind asking him for another drink tonight. And tomorrow night. And maybe the night after that.
Silence flooded the elevator once more. Steve fidgeted around slightly, not quite sure how to respond. There was a twinge of bitterness, and his annoyance got the best of him as the words flew out of his mouth.
“Take care, Tony. Call me when you land.” Steve squeezes his hand, silently begging for him to stay. He won’t stay though, and Steve’s heart is a little more heavy because of it.
Eva leaned up on her toes and kissed his cheek, a silent acceptance of his apology. "I'll tell you how you can make it up to me back at my place."
The stranger doesn’t come back for a while. He tries not to be discouraged about it, but still, he wishes he said something more to the stranger. It was nice to be admired, even in that small moment.
, wanted to kiss him again. Watching Steve's lips move as he spoke wasn't helping with Tony trying to focus.
"God, she was looking at you like you were Prince Fucking Charming! When were you going to tell us about this girl?!" Nat was practically screaming now, eliciting stares from others in the street. Bucky chuckled slightly and looped his arm with hers in efforts to soothe her.
The blond peeked over the edge of the bed, grateful that the man beside him was still asleep. Knocked out with his mouth slightly agape, he looked so peaceful. Short but lush strands of dark, slightly salt-and-peppered hair, the longest lashes he'd ever seen, perfectly groomed facial hair; he was a goddamn model.
"So I guess I'll see you soon, hopefully?" Her smile was so nervous, so genuine, his heart skipped a beat again.
The interns were more than exhausted. They weren't just fatigued; they were wiped out after their first shift.
But then again, Steve didn't mind. He was still trying to slow his heart rate after shocking a sixteen year old girl's heart for the first time.
"You aren't alone, okay?" Steve faced her smiled. "You've got us. Your baby is strong, and you are, too. You aren't alone in this, I promise."
"Haven't made it in a while," Steve replied. "It was a recipe from Ma. It always made me feel better when I was sick, so I knew it would make you feel better."
It was just Steve's luck that he and the rest of the interns were assigned to Dr. Potts-Stark's cases for the next few weeks. That meant hours and days spent checking on her patients, reporting to her, scrubbing in on surgeries with her.
The interns said nothing more and eventually split off from each other to continue their errands. The apartment had not been stocked for weeks—they grew tired of eating cereal straight out of the box. Consequently, Steve made it a point to buy food that didn't come from a box. He had nearly forgotten what it was like to have fruit and vegetables in the house.
"Oh, absolutely. You got me, Tony. I'm about to divorce you and adopt all the stray dogs in the city." Steve carded his fingers through Tony's hair, chuckling when the infamous pout grew on his face.
She placed the ring in the palm of his hand and closed it. "It wouldn't be fair of me to keep your mother's ring. It's time I give it back to you."
Steve tried to keep a straight face. One early morning, before Bucky arrived in the locker room, he had overheard the girls talking about the soldier and his inability to "make a move." They immediately hushed when Steve walked over to their lockers, and instead smiled on and gossiped about the nurses instead. So yeah, he knew, but he wasn't going to make it easy for Bucky.
Dr. Stark had been trained to steer from the whole truth. They weren't supposed to lie to their patients, but sometimes, bending the truth turned out better for their recovery. Omitting certain details also proved to keep families sane, too. Parents worried less about their children, letting the surgeons focus during procedures rather than having to update them frequently during surgery. Patients had quicker, better recoveries instead of coming back due to complications. It wasn't full on
"Sit down and drink water," Steve replied sharply, "Make sure Nat and Sharon get some water too. You guys can crash here tonight. I'm sending everyone else home."
Rhodey didn't even need to open his eyes. "Tony, you better have a damn good reason as to why you're waking me up right now."
"I didn't tell Steve anything." Saying his name out loud made Tony's heart ache. "I was planning to tell him soon, to explain everything."
Tony crossed his arms, biting his lips to stop his laughter. He knew he'd get a rise out of Steve for ganging up on him with his mother, but he did not want to miss out on this. Not with the flustered expression and the pink that Steve wore so well on his cheeks.
But Pepper still wore her ring. The beautiful diamond glittered on her finger, a shining reminder that Tony hadn't left her yet.
The two enjoyed their chicken soup together, avoiding any conversation about Andy or medicine. Even though Alex had been through hell and back, and the last thing she needed was to talk about medicine.
The hope in her mind was immediately crushed as Steve Rogers waved from the station with two cups of coffee beside him. Friendly coffee, as Tony described it. She tried not to read too much into it; Tony was allowed to have friends.
When Steve arrived back in the nursery, he noticed that Alex had never left her baby's side. She sat in one of the rocking chairs this time, sleeping soundly next to her daughter. He tried not to take her, but she immediately sat up when she heard him shuffling around the nursery.
“Remind me to go and get some,” Tony grumbles. “How the hell do we have banana ketchup stocked in here but not
Dr. Wilson barked something at him, and though Steve knew it wasn't personal, that it was because this girl needed help, it only added to his anxiety. He pulled out whatever was needed from the cart, paged more nurses for medications, and soon, the seizing ceased. Dr. Wilson finally took a breath.
Cheeseburger hopped into the counter this time, sitting right in front of the engineer. He meowed a little more delicately now instead of angrily. Tony rolled his eyes and scratched behind the kitten's ears. The kitten purred, briefly, but it was there.
Baby Andy was recuperating well in her incubator, and Dr. Potts-Stark welcomed the intern with a smile. Steve was thrown off—very rarely was the neonatal surgeon happy to see him.
“Any chance you’ll slip in some morphine, doc?” Tony hoped for at least a smile, something to prove that maybe he hadn’t imagined what Steve had said. That it wasn’t a drunken dream, that it was true— Steve had missed him, too.
Tony Stark could be one hell of a brat when he was crabby. While the neurosurgeon was known for his usual charm and dazzling smile, the finalization of the divorce left his temperature incredibly short. The charm he could muster was always reserved for his patients no matter how horrible his mood was; very little patience was reserved for his residents and interns. The only intern Tony seemed to cut slack for was a particular blond. This did not go unnoticed—at least, everyone else noticed but Steve.
He hated the way he felt when Steve turned over and kissed him. He forced a smile as Steve stood up and adjusted his clothing.
The blonde continues his grumbles, retreating to the blankets in retaliation to being left alone in bed. His muffled voice beckons for Tony, bringing another grin to his face.
go out," Tony said softly as he took a step toward the blonde, "but then I can't do this. At least, not as often as I'd like."
The two women put on their best smiles, batting their lashes and holding their hands together as if pleading in prayer. Steve shook his head and chuckled.
"And you're just a know-it-all when it comes to the hospital's architecture?" Sharon asked. She laughed when Bucky glared at her. "You're right though. This is one of the best hospitals in the city. We'll be okay, Nat."
"I wish I hated you for that." Pepper sniffled and quickly wiped tears away. "I wish I could hate you, and then I would leave this damn city and go back home."
Dr. Danvers collected her charts and reminded the interns once more about paging her. The interns were silent, not daring to move or breathe until she was out of their presence. Wilson snickered.
"Going steady? Steve, you guys are dating!" Sharon exclaimed. "That's the most old-fashioned termed for dating in history."
"You could have invited her on a date, you dumbass!" Steve sighed. "Whatever. I'm not paying for any booze or food. That's on you. You better make a move on Nat tonight or I'll tell her that one guy in radiology is into her."
Sharon stood frozen in her stance as another resident wheeled Jackson away to the OR. Steve walked over to her, putting a hand on her shoulder.
Alex shook her head. "What if Andy needs me? What if she—" She choked back a sob before she could continue.
As he stepped into the elevator, Tony joined him as well. Immediately a smirk grew on Tony's face, and it was just so goddamn enticing, Steve had to force himself to stare at the flyers on the walls.
Despite slightly blurred vision, Steve noticed a dark-haired man sitting right in his line of sight. Slightly curled strands of salt and peppered hair and ridiculously gorgeous eyes. He almost looked too pretty to be sitting at the bar alone, so the intern motioned over to Joe.
He turned on the TV, mindlessly flipping through channels in hopes to find a show or movie to numb his brain before going to bed. After flicking through several channels, there was a rerun of one of the crime shows he liked watching. He tried to settle into his couch until he realized he had no idea how to relax.
Tony sat idly in one of the on-call rooms, one away from the surgical and trauma units. He wasn't usually like this, checking his pager every five minutes. For the first time in years, he felt nervous. The same nervous energy that he felt when he was young suddenly rushed through his body. Maybe this is what Steve has been feeling all day, too. He didn't think he could make someone so nervous, but then again, it had been years since he met someone new.
Before his mother could answer, a familiar neurosurgeon walked up to the nurses station. Steve couldn't believe his eyes when he saw his own mother with rosy cheeks with Dr. Stark's arrival. Sarah grabbed Steve's arm, squeezing it with excitement.
"Okay." Tony leaned back on the couch. "Anyway, uh. The intern doesn't know about New York. But he's probably going to find out real soon. And I'm in deep shit."
intern in particular on their knees, actually." Tony laughed again when he saw that Steve had reddened in about three seconds. "Rogers, I'm kidding."
Marriage counseling wasn't as painful as it was before. No more shouting, no more tears. The poor counselor wasn't calling breaks anymore after screaming matches that he and Pepper got into far too often. Things were going okay until she suggested that they trying going on a date.
Her face hardened. "You're right. The problem was just between you and me. I made a mistake, but I am not the only reason our marriage is falling apart."
“You can’t be annoyed at us for asking,” Sharon added, “Tony hasn’t been nice to anyone but you these days.”
Dozens of texts and pages flooded his phone, now that he was in range of cellphone towers. He froze when he saw all the messages Sharon had sent him. The latest text said that Andy was already in the OR.
sex," Steve insisted, "I'm actually getting to know him a little. He grew up in New York. He used to play lacrosse like all the east coast elite children did when they were growing up."
“I just wanted to be nice,” Steve replied after a while. The words somehow felt like a lie coming out of his mouth, but he wasn’t sure why else he cared in the first place. “He’s having a having a hard time and feeling lonely, and I didn’t want him to feel that way.”
The intern pulled away from Tony's grasp, not realizing how hard he had flinched away until Tony frowned.
His brain no longer had any bodily control now that Tony's lips were on his. The brunet let out a wanton sigh, and the unexpected noise only fueled Steve's hunger. He let his fingers tug on Tony's strands, relishing the soft moan that left his lips. Now that Steve could feel those lips, those lips that he dreamt about and missed and craved and ached for, he couldn't stop. He didn't want to stop. Everything he ever felt about this man came crashing down in unrelenting waves. Steve wanted to touch and kiss every part of Tony's body, his lips, his neck, his chest, right between his hips—
Along with errands, the interns' new activity was finding Steve a date. They wandered aimlessly in the grocery store, encouraging the blond to meet somebody new.
"Hey now, let's not jump to that conclusion." Steve sat on one of the chairs next to her. "Andy is on the top of the list. All the other interns are calling UNOS right now."
Because Steve flew solo without permission, the rest of the interns joined him at the nurses station for charting. Wilson had seen other patients that morning, and so it was time for scut work. Doing the paper work that saved lives was not nearly as interesting as saving the actual lives.
"Ew, Barnes, get your coat in laundry!" The redhead shoved him a bit. The soldier nearly fell off the gurney, much to the others' amusement. Bucky shrugged off the lab coat and threw it on the floor, groaning tiredly as he returned to the gurney.
The blond had barely dozed off before his cell phone started ringing. He groaned when he saw that it was an unknown number. He had given his numbers to his friends and some of the other new interns, but he was exhausted and couldn't think of who could be calling. So, Steve let the phone ring as he closed his eyes for the first time since last night.
. The Bautistas reminded him again if he ever was hungry, all he needed to do was give them a call. That was one of the great things about coming to their store: they always welcomed him with a warm meal.
"Alright. Play nice for the next two days and I'll tell Steve you were a good cat," Tony said gently, "if you're a good cat, they'll spoil you even more. They'll probably kick me out of here so they can buy you a cat throne or something."
"Don't think. Tell me what you know, Rogers." The tone in Dr. Rhodes' voice only confirmed Steve's initial diagnosis.
"I'm going to be fine," Steve insisted. "Alex must be worried sick I'll go update her. Page me when the surgery is over."
The nurse smiled. "Radiology is on the fourth floor, honey. When you get off the elevator, turn left."
“It’s a good thing I had someone bring me some dinner,” Steve continued nonchalantly. He glanced at the neurosurgeon, slightly disappointed to see that he was unreadable. Tony only gave some sort of grunt in response. He decided to egg him on. “How are you and Pepper these days?”
Usually, the ER was something to look forward to. Some of the best cases came in through the doors, and the interns were finally getting the hang of running a trauma together. While it had only been a couple months at the hospital, the interns were beginning to feel like real doctors. They were a team.
Sharon and Bucky split from Steve and Natasha in the library, trying to conquer the massive amount of information to get their answer. They needed to move quick to get Katie back home.
was pined over, not the other way around. But with Steve, he found himself thinking about the intern constantly.
For a few minutes, there was silence. Steve immediately wanted to take back what he said; he felt his heart racing and his hands getting clammy. He felt like a fool in the seconds, minutes, and what felt like hours for Tony to respond.
Steve stifled a laugh, though it was difficult with the look on his friend’s face. She looked as if she had just broken ground on a new medical marvel.
Sharon waited a few moments after Steve slipped out of the ER before creeping behind the nurses station to see if anyone met Steve out in the hallway. As if on cue, a grumpy divorcé joined her friend, already wearing a smile despite coming fresh out of a long surgery. Sharon could barely stop herself from gasping, and the sound was loud enough to wake the slumbering soldier laying next to her.
Steve was on auto-pilot. Truthfully, he was glad that they weren't sent to the ORs and instead were left to help where the attendings couldn't. All critical patients were already taken up to surgery or already admitted by other residents and attendings; all the interns had to do was stitch up patients or run to the blood bank in case people needed transfusions. Steve didn't mind the busy work at all; he desperately wanted something, anything else to focus on.
They’re standing together at the airport the next morning. It’s so goddamn cheesy, Steve makes another joke about how they could star in the next romantic comedy. Their laughter is brief before the reality of it all strikes Tony in the chest.
“Tony, this is Eva,” Steve began, “Eva, this is Dr. Tony Stark, one of the best neurosurgeons out there.”
One afternoon, Tony arrives back to the usual practice rooms of the fine arts building. Sitting on the shelf of the piano is a sketch that takes the air from Tony’s lungs.
"We've got a car accident with two minors, brother and sister, obvious facial lacerations, possible head and neck injuries," the paramedic began, "possible internal injuries to the brother."
Out of the corner his eye, Steve could have sworn he saw the doctor pausing before carrying on with her exam. She hushed everyone as she waited to hear a heartbeat from the pregnant woman's abdomen. A weak, slowing heartbeat echoed through the trauma room.
He could have left it alone. He could have said nothing, he could have just left the fucking room and gone back to charting somewhere else in the hospital. But, for some reason, the way that Steve was looking at him with such a smug look on his face, he snapped.
Steve was invited to the bar after the mixer, but he decided to stop at home and get out of the formal wear he was forced to wear that night. He felt so stiff; he needed to unwind.
Tony would chuckle as he saw interns and residents passed out in the hallways, desperately trying to catch up on sleep before waking up and reporting to their superiors the next day. He did not miss the tireless hours he worked before becoming an attending; the thought alone made him yawn.
." He rose his voice a little, enough to jolt Bucky out of the panicked voices in his mind. "Suction, stitch, then pull. You're nearly there."
They nodded wordlessly and ran to the pit, where they were met by doctors and nurses alike scrambling to take in the bodies. Dr. Rhodes noticed the interns and ushered them into a trauma room.
Steve laughs heartily, and the sweet sound warms Tony’s heart. The way Steve’s nose crinkles, the way his eyes shine after Tony says something silly and stupid like that,
There was no use hiding anything this time around, especially around Sharon. This time, Steve explained everything—from that night in the ER, the way Tony had looked that night and what he said, the and the fact that he couldn’t stop thinking about it.
“You’re not going to forget about me?” It’s barely a whisper, and hearing this is like a knife in Tony’s chest.
"Please leave." Steve's vision was blurrier now, and he felt so goddamn embarrassed as he felt tears falling from his face.
"What did you hear?" Steve nudged his friends with his pen. "I'm not fragile. I'm a big boy, I can take it."
As if on cue, Bucky ran up to the nurses' station, panting as he tried to catch his breath. He threw his charts on the counter and forced a smile on his face.
Finally he stood up, carefully sneaking out of the bedroom to get into the shower. The young doctor couldn't help but take another look at him, admiring the toned muscles that lay exposed. Just remembering how the man's skin felt under his fingertips was last night was enough to make him drool.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve blurted out. "There were so many chances. We've been together for months, and I have to find out from some woman who could basically be a movie star tell me that you're married!"
"Tones. Don't be mad." Rhodey studied his best friend's face. "I didn't say anything about why you left. I only said it was leave of absence. After that, I got a call asking if you were hired by Nick Fury. I only responded yes, then they stopped calling me."
lives. Things were so much easier in medical school. Now there were human lives on the line. People with families, people who meant something to someone else. His mom got him all worked up in six words.
Their conversation was cut short as the ambulance soon wailed loud enough for them to hear. The duo soon rushed to the ambulance bay, meeting the interns and the paramedics. Tony stopped in his tracks once he noticed that Steve was one of the interns on the case.
"Well, the whole Ph.D. route took a turn," Eva explained. "I decided to teach here in the city instead."
“Tony’s in surgery.” Steve grabbed the scans and placed them in an envelope. “We should probably page Nelson, he’s on call.”
"Steve, that is amazing! I am so proud of you, really." Eva's phone began to ring and she gave him an apologetic look. "I have to go."
The neurosurgeon frowned. "Can you listen for once? Didn't you hear me? Pepper and I are over. Steve, I want to be with you."
"Do you have any other ideas on getting a brand new heart, Dr. Romanoff? Because by all means, please let me know. He is weak and having consistent arrhythmias, and we can treat the fluid build ups for now." She barely bat an eyelash upon Natasha's surprise. "It may seem like we're just waiting around, but that boy wouldn't be safer at home waiting for a transplant while his heart beats and builds up more fluid, where it could kill him if we don't get to it in time."
There was no time to talk. No time to get an explanation for what was going on. The handshake was brief as the attendings went up to the OR to scrub and prepare for surgery. The rest of the interns were sent back to the pit for non-emergent patients. There was such a shock upon meeting Dr. Potts-Stark that the interns had no idea how to comfort Steve.
Steve tried to focus on the patients. Dr. Potts-Stark was double-board certified, so the interns got to deal with the pregnant mothers as well as the pre-mature babies in the NICU. The preemie babies always tugged on the heartstrings more than the babies that were carried to term; they were tinier, weaker. Surgeries that were performed on them often took a bit longer to recover due to their size.
Before Tony could get in a word, Steve had slipped into the OR. He stood in the back at first, joining the residents and other staff simply observing the surgery. Katie caught sight of the familiar blond and smiled.
After throwing some cold water on his face and pulling himself together again, Steve went back to the labor and delivery unit to find the other interns. They must have been ordered to do other tasks by residents because when Steve returned to the station, they were no longer there. Steve updated the nurses to page some of the other interns in case Dr. Potts-Stark needed anything.
The look of horror on Steve's face must have been obvious because the neurosurgeon immediately frowned. Steve cleared his throat and put the notepad in his pocket.
Alright, so Tony hadn't really been giving Cheeseburger extra love. He'd give the kitten some extra kibble as a peace offering, but that was quickly forgotten whenever Steve showered him with belly rubs and cat treats. While the kitten loved when Peter came over, it was clear that Cheeseburger and Steve were inseparable.
Steve nodded and followed her into the scrub room. He tried not to focus on anything else other than the case, but all he could think about was the fact that as Pepper walked past the scrub room, even her lab coat read the same name on the OR board.
Steve never drank a lot in college. He'd have his beers along with his buddies, but he paced himself better than everyone else that was drinking. The only time he ever really got wasted was years ago on his twenty-first birthday. The beers didn't seem to be working that much; he decided to take some shots.
Once they had finished their gourmet hospital dinner, a bit of an awkward silence filled the room. They both had the same thoughts.
As he pulls out his sketchbook and pencil, there’s a soft echo of piano music resonating through the halls. He pauses for a moment, hoping that he hadn’t imagined the quiet, peaceful twinkling of a familiar melody.
“Busy night, huh?” The edge in Steve’s voice was unmistakable. There was a smile on the intern’s face despite the coldness in his voice—he knew exactly what he was doing.
Pepper gave Tony a hopeful look, twisting the ring on her finger and silently praying that he would agree. She wanted this to work so so badly. It was Tony, after all. She wanted to fight for him.
"I'm surprised that you don't." Tony offered his hand out, squeezing her hand. "I would probably hate me."
But it was his first day at work. His first grown up thing. Medical school was a trial run, just a bunch of scalpel-hungry children with stethoscopes around their necks playing dress up. Today was an actual day. With actual patients. He prayed to some being up in the heavens, begging for a good day.
Wilson clapped her on the back before going into his own surgeries. "That kid is your responsibility today. Check on my post and pre ops, and remember: Tommy Evans is the one patient you can't kill today."
He leaned down and pressed a kiss to his mother's forehead. Sarah sighed and hugged her son. While her back was turned, Steve's smile quickly morphed into a frown. Tony winked and turned the corner before Steve could say anything more.
"Always keeping me on my toes, Stark," Fury replied. His expression was stoic—it always was—and even after all these years, Fury always had the power to make Tony break a sweat. The man helped Tony's career after all. Pissing him off was Tony's biggest fear, since he was a young man in medical school until today.
"Actually, your wife was looking for you," Wilson said abruptly. "I saw her on the way up here. She wanted to know where you disappeared to when the storm hit."
"Where's the fun in that, sweetheart?" Steve winked before removing Tony's scrub top and kissing his chest.
Dr. Wilson smiled at his introduction. He'd never admit it aloud, but he was impressed. The kid knew what he was doing. Maybe the interns weren't completely hopeless.
And the look he gives Tony, the soft sweet half-smile with just a hint of melancholy, it feels like his heart is going to tear in half.
A cartload of pet items and two cheeseburgers later, the pair were finally back at the apartment. Cheeseburger eagerly made his way to the kitchen onto the stool, waiting for his dinner. Tony unloaded all the bags from the pet store and sighed.
It’s usually right when Steve ends his shift at the local diner back home; his hair is always a little disheveled, it makes Tony’s heart ache. There were so many things to love about Steve, but the one thing he missed most was running his fingers through his hair. Tony really was a sucker for blonds.
The more Tony kissed him, it felt like a scalpel was digging harder into Steve's chest. Because he was still married, he still lied, and he still didn't leave her. And even with the misery that Tony was giving him, he wanted him more than anything.
On the morning that Tony needed to sign Pepper's divorce papers, he was already running late to the hospital. As he scrambled around his apartment, there was a knock at the door. He was surprised to find that a young lawyer was handing him a rather thick manila envelope. She said something to him, something about returning the papers through the mail, but he wasn’t really paying attention at that point. The neurosurgeon knew exactly what he was holding in his hands.
"Alright, here's the medicine," Steve said finally, handing him the pill. "And I put some lemon in your water, make sure to finish it."
Tony settled into the couch and continued eating the soup. "It better be just one minute! I'm cold and I could be dying!"
The intern nodded quickly, drying off his hands before running off to the neuro ICU to check on Katie. The teenager was just waking up from anesthetics, and she smiled affectionately when she saw Steve.
In her hand, there was a small folded up piece of paper. Her hand shook slightly; clearly it was taking all her courage to stand before him like this. Steve felt dizzy.
Steve wanted to say. Still, he let Wilson yell at him. He wasn't trying to get his ass kicked right now. An ass-kicking from Samuel Wilson on the first day did not seem pleasant in the slightest.
"I think I figured out why she was seizing," Steve explained as Natasha looked over the chart, "she fell."
God, he should not be feeling this way. He felt like a teenager watching his crush dance with someone else at the prom—he felt like a goddamn fool. But suddenly it felt like his lungs were filled with smoke and he couldn’t breathe—the jealousy he felt felt like a fucking fire in his chest. He couldn't breathe but his heart was somehow pounding too much blood without enough oxygen and he almost felt lightheaded. Tony’s eyes were glued to the sight, watching Steve touch her hand, watching her blush in response; he was infuriated.
"Don't be so surprised, Tony." The doctor put up the guard rails on the patient bed. "Pregnant women and their fetuses are my specialty, you know."
The kitten would also occupy the extra room they kept for Peter, crying out to the teenager. Tony had to close the doors any rooms that would even mildly smell like Steve or Peter, and Cheeseburger was
“I have a feeling I’ll be back here,” Eva said as she filled her plate, “every time I think I’m done getting food there’s something else I want—ugh, samosas!”
"I don't usually do one-night stands. Or flings." Tony's voice startled Steve out of his day-dreaming.
Maybe it was because he had a bad day, maybe it was because he was sick of having bad days, bad weeks, maybe it was because he got kicked off his case, he had no idea what possessed him to stay, but Steve found himself sitting beside Tony on the bed. A good distance away, far enough away to be out of range from the sweet smell of Tony's cologne, but closer than they'd been in a while.
Alex could only nod in response as Steve led her back to the waiting room. She needed a break from all the machines and the wires for a while.
Dr. Rhodes rolled his eyes before throwing his arms around Tony. The two best friends gripped each other tightly. Best friends during their undergraduate and medical school careers, the two were separated on opposite ends of the country during their fellowships.
Steve sighed. "Okay, if you're fine, I don't wanna hear any whining that you're sick and miserable. Got it?"
Steve had no idea how he should react. It was something out of a telenovela, some ridiculous plot twist on a soap opera that his mother would watch. It didn't feel real, it felt like some cruel prank, like someone would pull out a bunch of cameras and reveal that the whole ordeal was just a joke. A horrible joke, but at least it wouldn't be real.
sure," the stranger replied. He pushed Steve through the apartment door, quickly shutting it behind them.
The neurosurgeon left the papers on the counter and ran out the door before he could spend anymore time dwelling on the life he walked away from.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m a genius, remember? Geniuses can cram for their physics exams right before class starts. I’ll be fine.”
. Of course he's the one sent for a CT scan. The only damn intern who wasn't paying attention and daydreaming about a one night stand.
"But you don't have to say yes or anything," Tony added, "I've given you no reason to trust me or make you believe I mean it. But I do mean this, and I'm sorry. Again."
As Steve returned to the apartment, he was surprised to hear muffled music echoing from his place. There were definitely too many people in that apartment. When he entered, the whole room cheered upon his arrival. Everyone definitely had the chance to get the alcohol into their system; people who never would have interacted with each other were laughing and dancing. It was so odd to see so many people in his apartment, especially coworkers he barely knew.
After a momentary blackout in the hospital, the lights flickered on quickly. Dr. Fury and Dr. Rhodes were right about backing up all the files, because all the computers needed rebooting after the blackout. Nurses and interns scurried around the hospital looking for charts and files.
Tommy glanced up at Dr. Danvers, instinctively reaching for her hand. She squeezed it and turned back to the interns. "We're waiting for a new heart for our little guy here. While we wait, I need you guys to monitor his labs, monitor his stats, and page me with anything. Seriously, anything. Mr. Evans is my top priority today."
Just as Bucky tried to thank him, Natasha and Sharon returned to the cardiac unit, following Dr. Wilson into Tommy Evan's room. Steve and Bucky were quick to follow. Despite arguments and squabbles among the interns, they worked effortlessly together during a code.
The chief shook Bucky's hand, reminding him to be early enough to scrub in properly and to get the patient's chart beforehand at the desk. Bucky barely answered in response, nodding and agreeing to everything before sitting back down at the table.
He was thankful that the interns were on cardio rotation this week. They had been circulating around with neuro and trauma the past few months, which had been fun for Tony for a while. Sneaking glances at his favorite blond, catching him blushing still even after all these weeks of being together. There was a bit of a thrill, working with Steve during the day and being able to see him at night. It was against the rules, and the risk usually excited him. But now, there was more risk than being caught at work. One goddamn phone call at the wrong time was ruining his life.
That was the excuse Peter used when he knocked on the door one night, soaked to the bone in the suit, carrying a tiny, crying kitten in his arms. Tony quickly took the child inside, trying to hush both of them before Steve would hear the pathetic mewling and begging alongside Peter.
Tony took a spoonful of the soup, unable to suppress the groan that escaped his lips. "Why haven't you made this before? I want to marry this soup."
Worry consumed him as he picked up his wife, mindlessly accepting a kiss on the cheek and barely focusing on the roads as they drove to the hospital. Luckily, they made it in one piece, laughing together once they entered the building.
"I'm not going to be your emotional punching bag," Sharon replied, "I'm here for you, but not to catch the blow just 'cause you're having problems with your ridiculously hot boyfriend."
"Guess you can't leave til the storm blows over, huh?" Alex stared out the window. "I can't remember having a storm this bad in the city."
“I love you,” Steve says gently, leaning into Tony. The brunet swoons, pressing a quick kiss to Steve’s lips. It’s sugary sweet, like too much coffee creamer, but Steve doesn’t mind.
"You said you were falling in love. If you were falling in love, I deserved to know the truth. People you love deserve that." Steve squeezed Tony's hands one last time before heading for the door. "I deserved at least that."
"My craniotomy was canceled, I don't have to be in again until this evening for another surgery," Tony replied, "I happen to be all yours this morning."
Rhodey frowned. "No matter what happened in New York, I'm still going to support you, okay? Even if you killed someone, you know I'd help you hide the body. Idiot."
Steve immediately felt his face get hot and laughed nervously in response. "I think I'll take it easy this time. Can I have a beer?"
Steve bit into his sandwich, more nervous than he was excited. Sharon and Bucky had joined the two during lunch, celebrating Steve's victory. They spoke in hushed tones for a while, since no one else in the hospital knew about Steve's relationship—almost relationship— with Tony.
Steve was practically sleep-walking as he made it back to his apartment. He knew this part of the city like the back of his hand, so it wasn't difficult finding his place, even after two days of working. The intern barely made it through the door before immediately slumping onto his couch. He should probably shower, change his clothes, brush his teeth, eating something other than cold french fries...
Tony smiled as Steve entered the room. The intern had to steady himself for a moment, not quite expecting such a warm welcome from the man. He never knew where he stood with Tony these days, even moments like these, where there seemed to be a silent truce between them.
Two hours actually flew by quickly, and soon, the interns were paged back to the locker room. Wilson and other residents already looked exhausted for eight in the morning, but it didn't matter. They were finally free after their first shift as real doctors.
Kissing was difficult after several shots of tequila. Mystery man's lips seemed to be everywhere, but he wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or reality. Either way, there was a very pretty man's tongue in his mouth, so who was Steve to judge?
"You can't hug me either." Steve stepped back, forcing himself to smile. "I love and appreciate you, Sharon, but..."
The interns watched from afar as Dr. Danvers and Dr. Rhodes explained how Daniela's heart would help Tommy live. Through tearful eyes, the Sanchez family signed the paperwork.
The sound of the drill going into Katie's skull unnerved Steve at first. He'd seen videos of the procedure being done, he was used to cutting up cadavers and seeing the anatomy. He shouldn't have been so surprised seeing Katie's brain, but he was still in awe when the organ was exposed.
Steve nodded quickly, ready to leave the gallery before Wilson reached out and stopped him. For the first time in months, the man seemed genuinely concerned. The intern thought he was going insane.
Cheeseburger looked a little better, but he was still very malnourished and in need of proper grooming. After the examination from the vet, some vaccinations (Steve couldn't bear to see the kitten being poked with needles) and a clean up from one of the technicians, Cheeseburger looked like a brand new cat. The vet sent them home with some medicine for any wounds and flea and heartworm prevention.
Joe obliged at first, but after several shots, he noticed the soon-to-be intern needed to be cut off. Steve downed the last shot and hissed as the tequila burned his throat. He smiled sleepily at the bartender, holding up his glass.
The tiny kitten mewed angrily upon seeing Tony putting his shoes on and grabbing his keys. Cheeseburger stood in front of the doorway in an attempt to keep the engineer home.
Cheeseburger mewed in annoyance. Tony scoffed. "Don't take that tone with me. You're the one who won't just sit in my lap."
Tony couldn't think. Couldn't breathe. He was suddenly very aware that Steve was in the room, and he wished the earth would swallow him whole. That he'd disappear. Or that she would disappear.
“Ah yes, I’m feeling very sexy in our matching ugly Christmas sweaters.” She pressed a button on her sleeve that illuminated the silly reindeer across her torso. “The lights were definitely a great choice.”
Steve exhaled, suddenly realizing how lightheaded he had become. He faced Wilson and forced a sheepish smile.
He nearly jumped ten feet in the air when his pager went off. The neurosurgeon paced the room for a few minutes, trying to shake the odd feeling in his stomach. When he heard a gentle knock on the door, it felt like his heart fell at his feet.
He wished this day never happened. So he wouldn't be obsessing over his ex's adulterous wife while watching a life-changing surgery.
The soldier left with a smirk on his face, leaving Steve as the last intern to pack up his stuff. He was just about to leave for his apartment when he got a text from Tony.
Slowly, Tony shifts out of bed, earning yet another adorable grumble from the soldier. Steve reaches to Tony, whining slightly the space next to him is finally vacant.
It might have been the alcohol, the nerves about his first day of work, nerves about never doing anything fun in his life, but he felt a surge of confidence.
Purple Stethoscope, who Steve learned was named Sharon, nudged Bucky. "Quit being annoying. Not everyone wants to disclose their private life to strangers."
The air seemed thicker once Tony entered the room. The air left Steve's lungs and once again, he felt like he was seeing Tony for the first time, all embarrassed and flustered and nervous. Steve was glad that the nursery was empty for now, and that no one else had to witness this. He was already so anxious and no one even said anything yet.
He means that, though. That’s not part of the playing along. He’s loved Tony Stark from the moment they met; that he knew to be true.
"Didn't I tell you I was going to take care of you?" Steve winked. "This is Dr. Wilson, he's the best resident there is. And then the rest of us interns, Bucky, Sharon, and Natasha."
Tony and Steve were friends now. Well, sort of friends. Friends that got each other coffee, said hi at work. It was nice—better than having Steve walk the other direction any time they saw each other. They were almost friends. Acquaintances.
The neurosurgeon snapped back to reality when one of the other interns repeated a question about a head CT. Before he could respond, Rhodey replied in confirmation, and the interns wheeled the patient into the building. Another ambulance followed, and Rhodey paused before meeting the paramedics.
"I'm sorry," Steve repeated, as if reading Tony's mind. "I shouldn't have asked. I'm, uh...I'm just tired. And kind of being  a dick. Sorry."
Bucky and Natasha were sent to run labs some of Pepper's patients, so Sharon and Steve were left in the NICU together. The baby that Steve was taking care of was tiny, born at twenty-five weeks. The little girl's eyes weren't even open, but somehow, the child gripped Steve's finger while he gave her an exam.
He liked having Steve as his friend. He knew Steve was only his friend. He knew Steve was with Eva. Hell, they were having conversations about her. Steve would light up when he spoke about her during their chats over coffee. He knew Steve wasn’t his.
Tony slipped his arms back into his lab coat and sighed. Steve was in a frenzy now, red as a tomato from embarrassment, talking a million words a minute.
The tension seemed to melt away a little as laughter echoed around the room. Fury cleared his throat once more.
"You have to call her," Bucky chimed in after the story, "This is your chance to get your mind off Tony, see this girl—"
to do one, Steve," Sharon snapped. "if he doesn't get this chest tube he's gonna stop breathing really fast."
Steve was now giddy with excitement; he couldn't keep his eyes off the stranger as he made a call and headed out to meet the cab. The intern left a generous tip for Joe, and left to meet his gorgeous mystery man.
He tried to ignore it at first; they were always going to be together. Sure, they were just a couple of dumb kids, barely out of high school, but he can feel it, God, he
Steve chuckled as he connected her back to the monitors. "I graduated from Harvard, and I went to University of Pennsylvania," Steve began, "and you're asking me to figure out your TV?"
The interns were surprised upon entering the ER. Natasha checked her pager again, as if there was some mistake. Surely, their 911 page to the unit had to be a mistake—there wasn’t a single patient in need of attention. Sharon made note of all the charts they had to finish of the patients that came in earlier that weekend. Slightly confused, the interns took charge and cleaned up the ER and continued intern duties.
Tony and Cheeseburger nearly jumped ten feet in the air to find Steve entering the kitchen. There was a bit of stubble on Steve's face from days away from home and not being able to shave. Fatigue was all over the soldier's face, and Tony melted.
It was strange, sitting around and calling around for baby hearts. Andy needed one so badly, but it was a bit disheartening to think about another baby having to die for one to be available.
As if Steve's life couldn't get any more complicated, Eva rushed back into the grocery store, searching around for a familiar face. Once her eyes locked on Steve's, she took a deep breath and smiled.
Steve banged on the elevator doors and pressed his ear to them to see if anyone would respond. He was met with silence yet again, and the knot in Steve's stomach only twisted to see that there was no signal at all on his phone.
"He was eating from the trash!" Peter's lip wobbled slightly, enough to pull on Tony's heart a little. "He was eating a leftover cheeseburger in an alley, Mr. Stark!"
"And I'm sorry for how I treated you through all this. After the breakup, putting you through my bullshit, confiding in you and pressuring you to be my friend because I was being bratty. I'm sorry. I don't want us to be like this, you know. I want what we had before."
"And again, I'm sorry," Steve groaned, "Please don't make me grovel. I'm bad at it, and it's very, very pathetic."
Cheeseburger meowed triumphantly, rousing laughter throughout the clinic. Tony couldn't help but chuckle too, seeing the cat in Steve's arms.
"No, keep talking. I'm bleeding into my brain," Katie grumbled, "I deserve to know about the messy love lives of my doctors."
Another intern sat beside him, already donning the blue scrubs and the white coat. Her golden hair fell down in ringlets from her pony tail. A purple stethoscope hung around her neck.
Steve tried sneaking away the examination continued, hoping to hide in a supply closet or run away as far as possible. Katie seemed to be taking enough of his attention until she called out to him as he was stepping out of the door.
Once Tony was out of earshot, Bucky dragged Steve into the locker room, joining the other interns. The soldier forced Steve onto one of the benches and crossed his arms along with the other interns.
“You know so much about me already,” Tony said coolly, “you seem to know everyone here, and you’re here at a staff party. I’m assuming you work here.”
The girl's chest rose again with the shock, only this time her heart rate steadied. Her body moved naturally with her breathing, and her eyes fluttered open. She smiled weakly upon seeing Steve.
Steve pulled away, breathless, tears streaming down his face. Tony paused, eyes growing wide when he saw Steve's fears. The neurosurgeon brushed them away quickly and moved forward to kiss him again, but Steve pulled away once more.
Just as he was taking in the peace and quiet, a familiar group of interns entered the cafeteria. Despite the late hour, they were unusually chatty, babbling a million words a minute and catching up from that days events. With the car crash that morning, the surgical unit needed all hands on deck, and the interns were allowed to perform some minor procedures in the ER. They were ecstatic.
an emergency," Katie insisted, "It's an emergency that I'm bored out of my mind and I need you to tell me something. Tell me anything."
“And what do you recommend doing for her ICP?” Tony barely looked up from the files. “I’m not waiting forever for an answer.”
Joe nodded in response and mentioned it to the mysterious man across the way. Steve took another sip of water, waiting to see what pretty boy had to say about it. Joe returned with another drink in hand and smiled.
After the examination, Dr. Stark graced the nurses' station with his presence, earning hushed giggles and smiles from them. He thanked them for their help and reminded them to page him whenever they needed to. They batted their eyelashes and thanked him for coming to the rescue, which made Steve's blood boil. Sure, he was an intern, but he was the one in the room. Dr. Stark took ages to answer a goddamn page.
, you page me. Page me twenty times if you have to, even if I'm in surgery." The all nodded in agreement before going into the room.
A hearty laugh escapes the blond, and even though it’s the first time he’s heard it, Tony wants to hear it again and again. He’s heard countless melodies, beautiful symphonies and ballads, but somehow, all he wants to hear is that wonderful, beautiful laugh.
After some hesitation, the boy nodded. Steve hoisted him back up to the table, and Sharon restarted the monitors. The boy's heart rate had slowed slightly, but he grew weaker with the loss of blood.
"Shouldn't I swear off dating for a while?" Steve said in exasperation, "maybe I'll take up a new hobby or something."
Steve immediately returned to where the interns stood, grabbing Sharon and Natasha and pushing them to the front. Sharon glared at him, jabbing him in the chest with her elbow. It stung, but it was better than having to talk to Tony. The man was gorgeous even after answering trauma consults in the ER.
Most of all, he hated how many empty coffee cups that had the same chicken scratch that now lay in the locker. Steve gathered them all into his arms, dumping them into the bin and stomping down on them for good measure. He added the rest of the garbage the bin and left the room feeling just as empty as his locker.
Sharon locked eyes with him from the OR. She nodded slightly, confirming that everything was okay. Steve was relieved; Sharon always knew what to do.
The interns looked curiously at Katie, who looked exasperated. Her arms were folded, clearly irritated with the two of them.
Alex sniffled, but she didn't leave Steve's grasp. "I don't mean to cling so much, but—you and the other interns...you're all I've got right now. I'm alone in taking care of Andy right now."
A hush fell over the crowd as Steve stood up. "Seriously? You're gonna sit here, eating snacks and making bets, instead of
Despite everything, his newfound friendship—almost friendship—with Steve was the only thing that made him feel better. News of the divorce was the talk the town; he knew that the moment the OR boards were updated the other day. Steve’s kindness despite everything they had gone through together just made everything a little bit easier. It was somehow easier to breathe knowing that he was not completely alone. Tony knew he had Rhodey, he would always have him. Still, Rhodey had created his own life here in Chicago, and Tony was still feeling helplessly alone. Steve had mended that feeling, helped that gnawing feeling become a little more bearable.
A smile crept on her lips, and for a moment, Steve swore that his heart had skipped a beat. She brushed the hair out of her eyes and laughed when she saw his face grow beet red.
was nice. It was hot, but I was drunk, so I'm hoping what I remember was hot." Steve shook his head again when he saw her jaw drop. He fucking knew it. "Listen, I didn't want to say anything but you asked—"
The intern was so lost in his thoughts that he barely had time to realize that he was crashing his cart into another person in front of him. He winced as the woman in front of him yelped in pain and dropped the groceries she held in her arms. Eggs splattered the aisle floor, and Steve swore he heard the teenage storeworker groan in response a couple of aisles down after hearing the noise. Steve immediately ran over to the woman, who was crouched over in pain.
"You're right." Tony looked at the intern apologetically. "I was selfish. You made everything so much easier, and I knew bringing it up would change something, even if I did come clean right away. I just wanted something happy for a while."
"Shut up!" Steve exclaimed. "You have got to talk quieter. I didn't know he was a doctor when I met him! I was drunk off my ass, and he was really,
Steve left the supply closet before he could let any of his emotions get the best of him. He was going to work, he was going to forget, just for a few hours, that he didn't spend months falling for a guy who was married.
Rhodey scoffed. “I don’t think you’ve ever called me by my actual name since I’ve known you. Not once.”
"I don't know why I even agreed to this," Tony muttered, "It's the same thing, over and over. Pep, just let me go—"
"Because these babies are brand new, with brand new hearts that could get sick." Steve removed the stethoscope from his ears. "Did you need something from me, Dr. Stark?"
If he had been with them, he probably wouldn't have taken shots to ease his nerves since he was alone. He wouldn't have been alone in his thoughts, secretly terrified of killing a patient because it felt like everything he'd ever learned was leaking out of his ears. He wouldn't have been distracted and taken a a gorgeous stranger back to his apartment, and he wouldn't be dreaming of another night with that same gorgeous stranger.
The cafeteria was quiet; most of the day shift staff had gone home for the evening, so only on-call staff and many interns were left at the hospital. The rain and thunder were incessant outside.
"Page me if there are any changes in her EKG," Pepper said. "I'll be in labor and delivery in case you need me."
He wanted to hate her. He hated himself for it, but it was true. He hated that she had Tony first, he hated that she complicated the one good relationship he had in a while. But that wasn't true at all; if anything, he complicated what she had first. He hated that she was perfect, that everyone loved her immediately, and he hated that he felt like a high-schooler plotting his revenge against his sworn enemy.
Steve laughed and wrapped his arm around her. He stayed quiet, though, unsure of how to answer her.  He cleared his throat before saying anything else. “Say, let’s get back to the pit.”
But he can’t ask that of Tony; that wouldn’t be fair. Besides, Tony’s probably going to change the world someday, and he wants to be able to say he knew him before. Before he changed the world. Before, when they were just in the back of his truck, watching old movies at the drive-in. Before, when they were together.
"I-I don't know how to take care of a cat." Tony hoped that would be enough to get the animal out of their apartment. "And Steve—"
"Both?" Tony nearly choked on his coffee. "You screwing the chief of surgery in New York was a mistake. Steve was
"Tommy keeps crashing," Nat explained. "Dr. Danvers said she didn't think it would get this bad so quickly. They need a heart today."
Tony sighed and squeezed the kids shoulders. "Take the cat home, bud. I-I'm not sure if we can keep a cat in here—"
As weeks passed, the look on Tony's face made everything worse. He knew that Tony was losing sleep, and it only added to the sad, apologetic expression he wore as he looked on from the nurses' stations. Steve wanted to forgive him. So badly.
But it was more than just cat safety gear that Tony ended up buying. The kitten seemed to meow at everything that looked like a treat or a toy, and soon, Tony had racked up a full cart of cat items they definitely did not need. The teenager at the register couldn't believe that Tony Stark was in the building with a cat in his arms.
"I'm trying my best here," Pepper urged, "to be civil. I'm trying my best because I know Tony...well, I'm doing this for Tony."
A young teenage girl was seizing violently in the gurney, with the paramedics listing off her vitals to Dr. Wilson. Steve's head was suddenly cloudy, like he forgot what medicine was; it sounded like a foreign language in his mind.
"There you are," Steve said happily, "chicken and rice soup. Best thing on cold day or when you're sick."
The soldier stood up and went to his locker, changing back into street clothing. The girls returned soon after, updating them about Tommy's surgery. His stats immediately improved once he was back in the room.
And Tony’s smiling now, feeling Steve pressing his face on his back. He never gets tired the pretty blonde clinging to him and begging him to go back to bed.
Steve studied the brunet's face. He almost wished Tony were lying, that he didn't want to be friends, that he didn't miss being in his life, that they could move forward and forget about each other. Honestly, that would be easier than this, standing in a room where they could only be friends instead of anything else. Steve absolutely hated that he couldn't read minds, but everyone else seemed to know what he was thinking or wondering.
"Talking to me like I'm still yours." Steve swallowed back the knot in his throat. "We're not...you're married."
"I think you're just using me for food," Tony said, "that and to make Steve believe you're a perfect cat. Except that you're not. You manipulate people to get what you want. I don't doubt that you're going to take over the world someday. You'd be good at it too..."
“I’m going to miss you.” Tony curls in against Steve, holding him close against his chest. The simple action usually made Steve swoon, but right now, it’s breaking his heart.
Steve sniffles a bit, feeling his cheeks burning. He’s crying in a fucking airport terminal, God, it’s so
He wasn't one for one night stands, either. At least, not anymore. His college days definitely had the occasional late night quickie—those days had passed. While he wasn't usually the type to try and meet someone at the bar, the way Steve had been ogling him that night drove him
Friends should not be giving each other heart eyes over shared cups of coffee, but, to each their own, right?
Pepper's arrival made the gossiping worse. Now that knew about Steve and Tony, the drama was just that more interesting. The entire cafeteria was buzzing, and the interns tried their best to distract their friend.
Bucky mumbled more apologies as Steve led him to the other couch in the spare bedroom. Soon enough, the soldier quickly fell asleep. Once everyone was settled, Steve went back to the living room, not bothering to clean up the mess. That would be a tomorrow problem.
“Is it your life mission to make everyone around you miserable?” Steve shouted. “No one else can be happy, everyone has to be a mopey piece of shit like you, huh?”
The engineer tried to get to the bathroom as quickly as his could, forcing his muscles to push despite the fact that he was aching like hell. Just as Tony turned on the faucet to flush his face with cold water, a familiar blond stood behind him, arms crossed again.
"It's still weird." Tony stared at his shoes, slightly embarrassed. "I-I get it. Listen, I have to check on some consults..."
? She said she's bringing it to the hospital for the night nurses." Mrs. Bautista went to the counter, bringing out a tray of extra food she had made for Sarah. "Do you want some too?"
"I'll have to do a physical," Steve said between kisses to his chest, "make sure everything is alright..."
Honestly, everyone finding out about the relationship with Stark wouldn't have bothered Steve. It would have been annoying to deal with the initial gossip and the stares. There were so many people working at this hospital; the odds of people not hooking up or dating were unlikely. People would talk about him and Tony but eventually move on— there was always something going on in the hospital.
“That’s not what I meant.” Tony felt so damn sleepy, and the world was beginning to fade again. The intern looked puzzled, and Tony couldn’t help but smile and reach out to him. He swore he was touching Steve’s face before he finally fell asleep again.
The intern tried his best to focus and find joy in the changing weather; it was all he could do to keep himself from falling apart. Having roommates definitely helped in keeping his mind off Tony. Any moment that they weren't at the hospital, the gang tried their best in keeping Steve busy.
“He’s just...having a hard time,” Steve explained, “When he told me about the divorce papers a few weeks ago—“
The tunnel was silent for just a few moments until the inevitable rouge spread across Steve's neck and cheeks. They groaned in exasperation.
And now they’re finally in bed, Steve pulling the covers over them and pulling Tony in by the waist again. It feels so right, Tony just melts against him and his warmth, and soon, he’s sound asleep against the blonde’s chest.
Steve shook his head, trying to rid himself of any thoughts of Tony. He wished he hadn't leaned on him, because hints of cologne were on his lab coat. Another constant reminder of what he couldn't have.
Tony laughed, a weight lifting off his chest briefly. "With the whole surgical unit at your apartment, I don't think it'll help if everyone sees us."
Steve hid his smile behind his locker, adjusting his lab coat and stethoscope. "I just got a good night's sleep."
"Don't say my name." The intern tried hiding his smile. "I-I need to focus. I'm picking up a heart for a NICU baby."
He sighed and stood up. “I’m sorry for raising my voice I’m just...tired. I don’t know what to do, and I just want to forget about it right now.”
"You were the one that figured it out," Tony replied, "Without the extra scans, we would have missed it. You can pat yourself on the back too, you know."
The intern nodded and left before Tony could utter anything else. All of his dread and anger that kept him frozen and stiff all day seemed to melt away the moment Steve grinned. That heart-wrenching, slightly crooked, take-your-breath-away kind of smile that only Steve had. It was genuine, not the smug look from before. That goddamn smile, the one he hadn't seen in a while—at least not directed at  him these days—left him in a goddamn puddle.
"Oh, so you're staying here? For...a while?" Steve felt like kicking his own ass just hearing himself speak.
Tony's heart fluttered for a moment, trying his hardest not to lean over the table and kiss him. He wanted to get to know Steve, wanted to feel the rush of initial attraction and the possibility of falling for someone. He also just really, really,
"Now, Steven, when were you going to tell me about that?" The nurse was much shorter than Steve, but she instilled a bit of fear with her hands on her hips and a stern look on her face. "First, you skip out on dinner before your shift, I don't see you for two days, and you don't even update me on exciting things like saving patients!"
When Steve returned to the living room, he found Sharon and Natasha sitting on either side of Bucky on the couch. Beer bottles and red cups littered the coffee table, and it was clear that his friends had their fair share of alcohol for the night. He took their drinks and replaced them with water. They immediately protested.
"I had to do the lovely walk of shame from your apartment to mine, so yes, I do know where you are, Steve."
Steve barely looked up from his charting. “There was a car pile-up because of the snow. Everyone who’s sober is working now.”
Tony grumbled as he sat on one of the bar stools; he didn't really mean it, though. He absolutely loved the fuss that Steve was making—he loved being babied.
He wanted to tell his best friend about Steve, he really did. He missed the thrill of telling his friend about someone new, someone exciting. But he knew Rhodey wouldn't approve just yet, not with everything that was going on in New York. Tony just desperately wanted to forget about it. New York, his life before—he needed a fresh start. And Steve, well...that was just an added perk to his new life here in Chicago.
After hours of calls, Steve decided to take a break and check on Alex. She stood in front of her daughter's incubator, holding back tears. Her eyes locked with Steve and she smiled.
The interns were told to cover Dr. Potts-Stark's non-emergent patients as she was called into emergency surgery. The residents with seniority were the ones called to scrub in with her, and Steve was glad. As much as he loved surgery, he wasn't sure how he'd face Pepper after what he said. When he told the rest of the interns, they nearly fell to the ground in surprise.
"Go home and shower. Y'all stink and look like hell." Wilson actually smiled for a split second before checking his watch. "My interns, pre-rounds tomorrow at five a.m. Rounds are at six. Enjoy the day off."
Both of them were so engrossed in the other that they almost don't notice the lights flashing on and Wilson coming through the door.
Tony laughed in surprise when Steve pulled him back into bed. He only planned to let Steve kiss him just a bit more, but one more kiss turned into several, and hands wandered where they should not have been wandering. Soon enough, Tony's pants were inevitably back on the bedroom floor. When Steve gripped his hand around him, Tony groaned.
"Humans sit on these chairs." Tony raised his eyebrows when the cat mewed back in response. "Are you a human? I know you think you are, but you aren't."
Steve ducks away from Tony’s gaze, but he knows the inevitable blush will dust his cheeks and ears. He knows that Tony loves him, but hearing him say that,
Thankfully, the hospital was close enough for him to walk to. He had missed Chicago. His undergrad and medical school career had sent him out to the east coast. He liked it at first, liked the change of pace, the atmosphere. During his undergrad, the initial hype of New York City had eventually faded away. Sure, it was exciting, so many people to see and to meet, but it was the same tourists and the same bustle and sleepless city. Medical school had taken him to Philly, which was far too quiet. It was a city without all the noise of one; he was surprised to find that the city actually went to sleep. The nightlife could be fun if you knew where to go, but it was a calm city. Good for his medical school years, but far too boring. Chicago was where his heart was.
Pepper finally closed the gap between them; the feel of her lips on his nearly knocked the wind of out of his lungs. The way she kissed him, how soft her lips were—that never changed. Tony knew he should have pulled away, but somehow, his lips were still pressed to hers.
The brunet spins around immediately, startled to find blue eyes staring back at him. “Oh! Th-thanks.”
"Told you I'd get you out of here alive." He rested a hand on hers. Her skin was still warm. He kept her alive.
No one seemed to want to breathe or move an inch. They were all captivated as Bucky made the first cut into the sterile skin, surprised by the small amounts of blood that flowed after the incision was made. Seeing the flesh was so different from what they'd seen in models and anatomy text books.
Bucky leaned over and popped the food into his mouth, laughing as Steve rolled his eyes. Sharon leaned against Steve, swatting Bucky away from the french fries. Natasha laughed and threw the crusts of her sandwich at the soldier.
Steve slid out from the intern's arm, trying his hardest to hold his tongue. "You've had enough, buddy."
Steve hadn't been to Joe's in years. A lifetime ago, when he turned 21, him and some high school buddies came to celebrate during the holiday break. He remembered a very unsuccessful night of trying to pick up girls—maybe this time he'd get lucky.
"I wanted to talk to you before the storm but everything got so crazy." She wrung her hands, twisting the ring on her finger. "I wanted to have another date."
"I don't have a life," Steve teased, "I haven't properly had a day of doing nothing in months. I'm starting to forget what my bed looks like."
Another plus to the Just Friends act was that Pepper seemed to be giving him a break. Steve still wasn't on Alex and Andy's case, but Pepper allowed the intern to visit the family whenever he liked.
Steve is far too occupied in finding the sweet spot on Tony’s neck to notice that Tony’s fingers are in his hair; his determination ends in success when he hears the brunet sighing in content to the kisses on his neck.
They stood across the room from each other, a war zone between them. Felt just like home, the way they were fighting. It was as if Tony never left New York in the first place. Before Pepper could respond, there was a gentle knock on the door.
Tony hated that he noticed Steve smiling and laughing. He especially despised the fact that his heart ached upon the realization he hadn’t made him that happy in a very long time. God, he couldn’t even remember the last time he made someone laugh—really laugh, enough where their stomachs hurt and their faces were sore from the smiling. He wondered if he ever made Steve that happy.
The soldier looked up to the gallery, where his friends stood up and clapped. He couldn't hear them, but he knew they were cheering. A sense of pride washed over him; maybe he could do this after all.
learning something? What the hell is wrong with you guys? That's one of us down there. Have some damn respect."
Dr. Pepper Potts-Stark impressed many of the interns and residents on her first day. Despite the gossip that followed her, she was a great doctor. Both Laura Peterson and her baby sustained extreme injuries, but Pepper had fixed them up perfectly. Many babies and their mothers would not have been so lucky to survive an accident that severe with just any OB-GYN or neonatal surgeon; the staff at Chicago Medical were more than just impressed. They were starstruck.
"I don't want your boyfriend's coffee." The words slipped out far too quickly, and there was no taking them back now. Tony's jaw was already clenching. "Tony, I'm sorry, I'm just—"
And their date was...picture perfect. The couple had never been to Navy Pier, so Tony took her to a restaurant that overlooked the water. It wasn't a sight with ferry boats like they had back in New York, but the way the city glittered was beautiful all the same.
—and you just...pulled the clot out. I can't believe it. You saved her life. Just like that. She won't be having seizures anymore."
Ever since the unnamed listener came by, he’s proud to play again. Tony allows himself to strike the keys just a little more, accenting his talent and letting his beautiful tunes echo through the halls of the fine arts building. He’s partially hoping the stranger will come back, too. Maybe tell him his name. Maybe get coffee down the street.
Steve nodded quickly as he took the chart. The interns split up to check on their patients, and Steve tried to clear his head. Tony was probably arguing with his parents. Maybe his other family members. He was suddenly struck with the realization that he didn't know much about Tony, only parts and pieces of his childhood. Nothing about the life he had as an adult.
Steve mumbles something in response, pulling the covers of his head and moving closer to Tony. His golden strands are disheveled and perfect, and Tony swoons as the soldier’s grip around his waist tightens.
"You were right, Steve." Tony looked so proud of him, so much so that Steve wanted to just melt into a puddle. Did he have this effect over everyone, or was Steve just particularly weak to his charm?
One of the interns who had bet on Bucky's surgery sat on the arm rest near Steve was sitting. He reeked of cheap beer, and he slung his arm over Steve's shoulder. The other arm held a beer.
Their first date. The second date. Their first fight. Their second fight. The day that they moved in together. Their first Christmas at the apartment. Decorating the house for Halloween. The day Tony finally asked her to marry him. The day they got married. The first night of their honey moon. They day they finally bought a place in Manhattan. Their first anniversary. The second anniversary, the third anniversary, the fourth—
The neurosurgeon sulked in one of the empty units that he had already cleaned himself and continued his pre-op notes for the surgeries he would be doing the following day. He had been so focused on his charting that he nearly fell off the bed in surprise as Steve entered the room.
"You only get taller, Steve!" Mrs. Bautista squealed and pinched the blond's cheeks as if he were her own son. Steve blushed a little, suddenly realizing that Tony watching everything.
Cheeseburger mewed impatiently, ready to have his favorite food. The engineer sat next to him, breaking off tiny pieces of the burger for the kitten.
Steve laughed and shook his head. "It was nice to meet you, kid. Get some rest and make sure your teammates catch you so I don't see you in this hospital anymore."
Steve snatched it back from the soldier. "That's how I take my coffee. Tony knows what I order every time." He rolled his eyes when everyone gave him annoyed glances. "This is friendly coffee! People can be friends after breakups, or whatever you call breaking up with your married boyfriend."
Jesus, his voice was heavenly. Steve wanted to listen to him all day. He couldn't get his focus off the skin that was exposed; the man's button down was undone ever so slightly to reveal tanned skin that made Steve drool.
Though he was a bit embarrassed, Steve stood up and leaned into Tony. The neurosurgeon chuckled a little bit, abandoning the stove to reach into Steve's hair. He pushed Steve against the counter, growing a little breathless even though Steve showed no signs of stopping anytime soon. He shivered when Steve's fingers were at the buttons of his shirt, frantically trying to get the shirt open. Tony finally gasped when Steve succeeded and starting sucking a bruise into his neck.
"It's good to see you again," Tony said gently. His voice was like melted chocolate, and the way he looked into Steve's eyes made him weak. "Didn't think I'd see you so soon, but I always like surprises."
"It's great," Steve replied as he sat down. He could feel that Tony was nervous, and honestly, it made him feel a little better. He wasn't the only one shitting his pants out of sheer anxiety.
He also hated the cloudiness in his mind, his inability to answer. He wanted desperately to just be friends, but his heart was doing some weird tossing and turning, he was beginning to think someone in cardio should take a look. There was no reason for him to be feeling this way, but seeing Tony in earnest like this was making his heart contract way more than it should—
It wasn't like they didn't try talking and getting to know each other. Tony learned even more about the man. Steve's father had passed away when he was a baby; it had always been Sarah and Steve. Sarah Rogers worked like a dog to get Steve through college, and Steve had taken two years off school to work as much as he could before it was time to start paying for medical school. Everyone in Steve's neighborhood knew the Rogers' and were always rooting for them; because of Steve's involvement in school and the community, it was no surprise that he was accepted to in several of the medical schools he had applied to.
Bucky nodded quickly, following the chief's instructions as best as he could. After more suction and tying off what had been cut, the bleeding stopped. The abdomen was clear, and the stump of the appendix was pushed back into the intestine. It had suddenly occurred to Bucky that he had been sweating profusely, enough to dampen his scrub cap.
Tony nodded. "My father is the founder of Maria Stark Memorial hospital in Manhattan. Still owns and runs the place. Mom died when I was in college."
Tony could feel Steve's uneasiness whenever he stepped out of the room to take a call. Even when he'd assure the blond that he was just taking a private call about a consult, he knew Steve was curious. Although he was getting normal calls from his parents or friends, he felt the need to cover himself. After one little white lie, they just kept coming.
Bucky didn't respond, only muttered the steps of the surgery to himself once more. Natasha threw a crumpled piece of paper at him.
"Quit complaining and do some paperwork." Sharon handed the boys a couple of binders from the stack of post-op patients that were assigned from Wilson. "Wilson's emergency surgeries from last night are really piling up with his regular patients."
He wanted to want her, he wanted to love her the way she wanted. He wanted more than anything, to not disappoint someone for once.
Soon enough, the on-call doctor from neuro came and examined the scans. The patient was soon admitted, and the duo returned to their usual flow of patients in the pit. As the night continued and patients were either admitted or sent home, the ER grew quiet. Eventually, Bucky joined them in the pit, crashing onto one of the empty patient beds from exhaustion.  While Bucky laid passed out in the bed, Sharon quickly noticed that Steve grew a little restless, as if he were expecting a certain someone to greet them in the pit.
Tony grew silent again, thinking about ways to run damage control. He could just block the calls entirely. Call his old company in New York, apologize for leaving on such short notice, maybe explain everything—
Steve was beyond grateful for Eva's ongoing patience. They were supposed to have breakfast that morning, their own little version of Christmas before she left for Hartford later that morning, but once again—not even a holiday like Christmas Eve would get the interns out of getting called back into work. He held her extra tight before leaving the apartment that morning, trying to forget any other lingering feelings he was stupid enough to have in the first place.
"I asked Rhodey to make you come in here because I wanted to say I'm sorry," Tony began shakily, "For everything."
The jealousy was irrational, but he couldn't help but feel slight annoyance seeing his friends together. Bucky and Nat had gotten along so quickly with very little obstacles—
"I'm not stupid, we'll get your scans," Steve replied, hoping that speaking the words into existence would make it happen. Of all the days not to pay attention, it was with a girl with a serious medical condition that could send her seizing any minute. "Competition for what?"
Tony ended up coming home with a cat car seat, extra toys and treats, and two cheeseburgers. The cat wouldn't sit still during the car ride, and Tony was horrified that Cheeseburger would go flying through the window if he hit the brakes too hard.
The intern dropped the charts, leaning into Tony and kissing him. One last time, one last time to remember how his lips felt, the way he tasted, how the stubble felt. One last time to remember how much he loved the neurosurgeon, how much he loved the damn guy from the bar.
“Thanks for the coffee, Rogers. I owe you next time. Have a goodnight, guys.” The neurosurgeon gave a friendly wave before leaving the hospital.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I don’t talk to him as often as you think, you know. We know he’s in surgery because Bucky and Nat are there with him.”
Nat and Sharon stood beside Bucky; Nat let herself lean against him just a little. Sharon squeezed his hand. "You did everything you could. Don't keep thinking about it."
Tony chuckles, returning to the pouting blonde, but only getting close enough to kiss his nose. “It’s time for breakfast, honey.”
There was one day where all the interns happened to have their day off at the same time; a rarity, since the interns were usually worked until they dropped.  The interns took it upon themselves to run errands, do groceries, and take care of themselves since it had been weeks or possibly months without a proper day off. Usually, days off were accompanied by their pagers going off incessantly. Attendings loved leaving early and making the interns do some of the dirty work.
The timer on the stove went off, and Steve added some finishing garnishes to the soup before putting it into bowls. God, the man looked pretty while he was preparing soup—Tony could barely stop himself from swooning.
Their relationship confused the hell out of the interns. Their jaws dropped upon seeing Steve and Tony chatting away at the nurses' station. It wasn’t one of those moments where they were forced to be polite to each other; the pair seemed engaged in a friendly conversation.
Steve was speechless. Any confidence that he had the other night had completely faded away, and Tony had managed to take any breath he had in his lungs. He used to be suave. He used to have people swoon. But somehow, with Tony's voice on the other end, laughing and talking like some goddamn
Avoiding the neurosurgeon didn't get any easier at work, either. Tony tried surprising him at first, with coffee just the way he liked it, or his favorite pastries from the bakery down the street. There was a bit more hope in Tony's eyes, like there was still something to salvage. Steve wanted to have the same hope, too.
She was nowhere near the same height as Steve, but there was no doubt in his mind that she could kick his ass in without hesitation. Her arms were folded and her glare could have melted all the snow that fell gently outside.
He sat himself in his usual corner of the cafeteria, where there were enough plants to hide behind when needed. During the day, so many staff hunted him down for consults and recommendations, and if Tony had surgery, he had absolutely no time to engage in an hour long conversation. Luckily, there weren’t many people in the cafeteria anyway, so he had a bit of peace to himself that night.
The momentum from sprinting and turning a corner quickly made him trip, but he didn't care. He was finally in the room, he reached behind the monitors to press the code button—
There was a tired look on her face for a moment, and her eyes fluttered to a close. Immediately, her body shook violently.
"I can't take you out to dinner since residents love to abuse the interns for two days straight, so I thought I'd bring dinner to you." Tony had no idea where to put his hands, and
After clearing every cabinet and drawer, double, triple checking every goddamn inch of the kitchen, Tony returns to the bedroom, defeated. Steve shifts a little, moving the blankets to welcome the grumpy engineer back to bed.
As the blond kissed his neck, the stranger couldn't help but open his eyes and scope out the bedroom. The place barely looked lived in; the only indicator that he had a life was the lab coat and stethoscope that hung over the back of a chair.
Relief washed over Steve. He thanked her profusely before quickly hopping onto an elevator. Katie giggled to herself.
"Alright, people. It's a beautiful night to save lives." With the mask on, it wasn't obvious that Dr. Stark was smiling. But with the way his eyes crinkled and from his voice, it was obvious that he was.
"H-her heart kept stopping right before surgery," Alex sobbed, "I know Dr. Potts-Stark will take care of everything, but I'm terrified, Steve. And then you were gone and you usually make me feel better about these things—"
Tony chuckled a little but didn't say anything more as the interns scurried back to the tunnels in the basement. Steve glanced over his shoulder, his heart aching to see that Tony was watching him as they left.
The intern joined Rhodes at the nurses' station, suddenly incredibly nervous to be standing here with him. Dr. Rhodes was one of the best trauma surgeons in the country, and he was suddenly wondering now if he had done something wrong in the pit or had delinquent charts on any pit patients. The ER was his domain—it was not someplace to fuck around in.
Tony found Pepper in the one of the attending staff lounges, holding up two cups of coffee. Her face lit up the moment he entered the room, but the sight only made Tony feel guilty for his annoyance earlier.
"Steve." Tony's voice cracked again. "I need you to believe me. I want to be with you. Hell, I wanted it from the first date we went on. Please, believe me." Tony looked so hopeful for a moment, Steve almost wanted to believe him.
All irritation melted away when Dr. Stark finally turned to him and returned the chart. "Nice work in there. Hopefully your first day will continue being just as exciting."
"Would it be so bad?" Tony inched closer, impossibly close to him now. Steve could feel the cool air every time Tony exhaled.
Tony rolled his eyes as Steve used his free arm to hold his waist. "Yeah, whatever, Rogers. You need to get that cat a brother or sister or something. He's insufferable when you and Peter are gone."
"Your son diagnosed my first patient here, actually," Tony said confidently, "he was the first intern to help me on a case."
"I care more about whether you're seeing Dr. Calvin Klein," Katie replied, "my parents are here, which means the rest of my stay here is going to be
"Good morning, Dr. Stark, Dr. Potts-Stark." Steve's voice seemed to grow a little shaky now that he saw them together. "I had a cup for Dr. Stark, but I, uh, can run and get you some coffee, too, Dr. Potts-Stark?"
Tony originally planned to cook breakfast and have a cute first date, then leave. It was supposed to be mature but still have the thrill of being with someone new, and it was going to be perfect. The morning was supposed to be casual, but instead, Tony found himself naked next to the intern, who was passed out next to him. Steve was curled up beside him, golden strands beautifully mussed, lips pink and a tad bit swollen. He smirked to himself when he saw the bruising on Steve's chest, the redness baring great contrast the blond's fair complexion.
The neurosurgeon returned to his best friend’s side, enjoying the fuzzy warmth from the scotch. He delightedly accepted another drink from one of the other trauma residents, nodding and smiling politely though he had no idea what the conversation was even about. He quickly finished his drink, enjoying the slight burn in his throat.
He closed his eyes for a split second before continuing the procedure. The OR had a steady noisiness to it; the beeping of the monitors, the pressurized air going into and out of the patient's lungs. He could feel Fury watching his every move, but there were no complaints. He might actually pull this off.
The blonde quickly followed the rest of the interns and Wilson to the cardio unit, and the interns immediately hushed as they greeted Dr. Danvers. The cardiothoracic surgeon was usually friendly, but it was clear that she was not in a social mood. She stopped them before letting them enter the patient's room.
"You're a sweet girl, aren't you?" Steve's baby voice made Tony swoon, but he tried not to show it. Steve knelt down on the sidewalk, scratching the fluffy husky's ears. "You're a good girl for sitting like that. Yes, you are!"
"There are other doctors taking the best care of her," Sharon replied, "and Steve is right. We're going to help you and your sister, but we need you to sit down, okay?"
Tony sits on the bench, patting the space next to him. “I can write you something, if you want. You know, for inspiration in your art classes.”
Katie sighed , trying to hide the fact that her eyes were watering. "I'm scared of seizing again. I don't want to be alone when it happens."
He was new to the city. It was like a miniature version of New York. Plenty of tourists, plenty of the same hustle and bustle as New York, but to a lesser degree. It was different. There were so many goddamn ingredients on a hot dog and pizza was served far too thick and with way too much sauce; New York was the superior city. There was no arguing about that.
wanted to be friends," Steve retorted, "I was just so sick of feeling sad all the fucking time that I just agreed! If it were up to me, I wouldn't be friends, I wouldn't have met you that night, and I wouldn't be in this mess!"
Tony nods wordlessly, lips curling up into a small grin as the stranger bids him goodbye. Steve returns to his room to continue his sketch, a skip in his step as he hums the melody to himself.
“I’m done talking about this for tonight, okay?” Steve wasn't smiling anymore, and his voice was on the edge of shouting. “I
Bucky shocked her heart, once, twice, three times, until her heart was beating. She was breathing, but something wasn't right. Steve checked her pupils. Unreactive.
She tossed a folder at him, laughing as the files scattered and Steve was left to pick them up. He didn't mind the mess—it felt nice to be making a friend in all this. He liked Natasha. She was intense and definitely could kick his ass, but he trusted her.
He shouldn't have said anything to Tony last night, not while he was simultaneously pissed off and missing him all at once. He shouldn't have said anything at all that night in the ER, saying anything about being his friend or not letting him feel alone. He shouldn't have mentioned at all that he had missed Tony, not because it wasn't true, but because he was afraid of what else his feelings might make him do. Hopefully, the scotch in his system was enough that it would cloud Tony's memory.
"You guys are assholes," Steve said as he reached over to Bucky's soda, "Crazy, obsessed-with-other-people's-love-lives, nosy assholes. Don't you have other things to worry about?"
Steve felt his muscles relax. "Oh, it's no problem. Good thing we hosted the party right here at the hospital. No excuses for injury."
"There's no heart, is there?" The anxious mother tried to take deep breaths. "It's been twenty minutes but no one's paged or called about the heart."
Steve smiles. “Don’t be sorry, Tony. You-you’re a genius, you know? You need to be out there, changing the world with other geniuses. I just…I miss you. Nothing to be sorry for.”
It was as if someone poured ice water down Tony's back. The strawberry blonde hair looked familiar, but he didn't think twice since the woman was looking down at the patient. When she finally looked up, she smiled.
There was something unnerving about the envelope, sitting on his counter surrounded by empty coffee cups and clutter. Tony almost expected there to be a note inside the folder, a secret message from Pepper. Maybe an note, maybe a goodbye letter. He wasn’t exactly sure what he wanted or even expected when he finally looked at the papers, but he didn’t think it would be so cold. Concise. Years of marriage and memories, all split up and wrapped up nicely in a plain manila envelope.
By the time Steve returned, the combination of warmth from the fire and warmth from the soup made Tony drowsy. The sleepy grin on his husband's face made Steve's heart swell. He placed the blanket over the both of them and wrapped his arm around Tony. He squeezed just a little, chuckling when Tony smiled again in response. Tony draped his arm over Steve's chest and sighed.
Steve returned to Tony and held up the grocery bags. "If you like Filipino food, I have enough to feed an army."
"Dr Wilson, you ran the code? How was she?" Tony leaned down to put the stethoscope to her chest, much to the girl's amusement. "Quit giggling, missy. I need to hear your heart."
Sharon's fight to keep quiet finally broke as the other two snickered together. She giggled a little and sighed, shaking her head. She mouthed "sorry" to the blushing blond, laughing when she was met with a wink. Steve wasn't really embarrassed anymore; eventually he laughed with them. It was nice to take a break from the constant pressure of saving lives. It was nice to just take a goddamn breath.
"Looks like he's in good hands," the lady said before bidding them goodbye, "he's got two superheroes looking after him."
"I guess it didn't really come up last night," Tony said, taking a step toward him. The smell of his cologne and reminders of last night made Steve ache.
"Oh, honey.” Steve leans down, kissing Tony’s nose. “We’ll get some later, okay? We’ll get all the coffee in the world if you want.”
That really brought a smile to Steve's face, and he sighed in relief. Coming out exhausted him over the years. People like Natasha always made it a little bit easier.
The sound grows louder as the pianist continues the tune; the melody swells gradually and fades away once more. Steve shouldn’t be surprised to be hearing music students practicing in this building, but the tune is so light and angelic, he can’t help but be a little intrigued.
The other interns had already beat him to the hospital that morning, as some other attendings needed charting to be finished before any last-minute emergency surgeries occurred over the next two days. They finally had to join Steve in the pit, mostly stitching up patients who were too confident in the kitchen for holiday prep. It was never a dull moment at the hospital, not even during the holiday season.
"She seems nice," Steve agreed, not wanting to say anything more. Sharon was definitely someone who would have dated. She was soft, warm. She was genuine and kind; it was a shame Steve didn't go out with the interns last night. It would have been a safer bet, trying to date her. Not trying to date your fucking boss.
"Every nurse at the station bats their eyelashes at you and dreams of what it'd be like with you in the on call room. And those are just the nurses. The other interns are practically on their knees."
"You never sit and listen," Tony groaned, "it's always game over with you! Quit running for once and just listen for God's sake—"
"You need to stop saying stupid shit around him," Steve retorted, "Especially when I'm around. Now we smell like literal
Sharon shook her head and laughed. "Alright, we'll be at your little party. After everyone's shifts, I'm assuming?"
The pianist fidgets with his hands for a moment, silently hoping that his cheeks are only warm, that he isn’t blushing while this ridiculously adorable stranger compliments him.
"Don't throw up on any patients." Steve handed them more cups of coffee. "Sober up or Wilson will kill us."
"He eats right out of your hand but runs away when I feed him," Tony whined, "I'm telling you. The cat hates me."
"She'll be okay." Steve cleared his throat, embarrassed now that Pepper was looking right at him. "All those wires and tubes, they look scary, but she's not in pain. Your little girl is strong, Alex."
Tony was surprised to go down to the kitchen and find his husband at the stove, donning the apron and everything. The blond was stirring something in a pot, and the aromas floating around the tower smelled like wonderful. The fireplace crackled, illuminating the tower. The sight was something of a dream, a movie. Walking up behind Steve, Tony slipped his arms the man's waist, relishing the warmth that radiated from his body.
. He couldn't remember ever being this annoying. Maybe he was too much of a band nerd who was stuck either in the library or in the band room to be annoying, but he surely was not as annoying as a bratty girl calling 911 for no reason. He was a doctor, not a babysitter.
"If you'd answered my phone calls these days, you'd know." She clicked her tongue. "Well, which one of you is Steve Rogers?"
"Surgical residency. At Chicago Medical." Steve gave a sheepish smile. "Somehow they accepted me, even after some questionable grades at U Penn."
"I didn't want to wait any longer," Steve said sheepishly, "I told Dr. Wilson we needed another scan, and I-I have them here, if you want to take a look."
Of course he'd use the landlord card. They owned the damn building that they were staying in. Tony and Steve allowed everyone else to have pets, so why couldn't they take in this little guy?
As the storm raged on outside the hospital, the interns were gathered around the nurses' station instead of their usual place in the tunnels. The cellphone reception was better than the tunnels, and it was all hands on deck to get a heart for Andy.
Sharon looked at him curiously. "He said something about a party. After he bugged me about Nat, he told me that I should go to your place tonight."
The neurosurgeon took a quick sip before slipping into a trauma gown. “I’m fine. Thanks for the coffee, Rhodes.”
But it’s too late because Steve’s buried in Tony’s MIT sweatshirt, and the blond can barely contain himself even though he’d already shed tears the night before, too. “Tony, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”
Sharon didn’t miss the beat of silence nor the attempt to get back to work. She gave him a knowing look. “You miss him.”
"Pete, buddy, can't you take him to a shelter? There are lots of people who'd love to adopt him, and we-we can't have a cat." Tony sat down next to the kid on the couch, trying not to look at the cat, who seemingly had the same, heartbroken expression.
Tony shook his head. He looked relieved. “It’s a gift. The spirit of giving, or somethin’ like that. Also, just an apology for being such a Scrooge. Merry Christmas.”
The child's stats were originally low, but upon hearing Steve's voice and gripping his finger, they rose gradually. Sharon smiled and nudged her friend.
The interns exchanged pleasantries with the rest of the group—the usual information about where they graduated from, what they were excited about during internship, and what they were thinking of specializing in one day. Tony didn’t pay much attention to the interns as all he could focus on was the pretty girl latched onto Steve’s arm.
Eventually, Steve met his friends at the checkout lanes. He was practically throwing the groceries down for the cashier. Sharon looked at the blond curiously.
Pepper had suggested counseling. Tony insisted they wouldn't help, and that was clear as day as they sat on opposite sides of the room with a rather uncomfortable marriage counselor.
"I'm trying to make this right," She whispered quickly, "we're supposed to listen to each other in these sessions!"
Steve wanted to keep the damn kitten so bad that he lied about knowing how to take care of one, which Tony very quickly found out. The little furball small enough to fit in one of the soup bowls, but it took the both of them to wrestle him into staying still for a bath.
In a way, it was their first date. First time in months or years that they didn't feel miles apart from each other. First time that Tony kissed Pepper on the cheek, first time that he kissed her on the mouth. He wanted it to feel the same, he wanted to feel the same fire that Pepper gave him the first night he saw her one of the charity dinners at his father's hospital.
“God, it’s not pity, you idiot!” Steve ran his hands through his hair, exasperated and exhausted. “Have you considered for once that maybe you’re not the only one who’s suffering here? I
Steve began chasing after Sharon before he was cut off by Tony's arm blocking the way. Steve rolled his eyes as he was quickly directed to a stairwell around the corner. Tony kissed the blond's cheek and was surprised to be met with a bit of hesitation.
Steve shrugged. "I was getting sick of her trying to be my friend. Like it was some misunderstanding."
Though the shift was technically over, Steve knew that they'd call some of the interns overnight. Instead of going to pack up for his apartment, the blond entered one of the on-call rooms for the night. He was so exhausted that he almost didn't notice a familiar neurosurgeon already curled up in one of the beds.
Steve was lucky to get such a nice apartment. It was a lot of space for one person with no roommates. It was a great apartment, but right now, it was
"Say, the nurses are talking about getting wasted at some party," Tony panted, "talking about some party at a pretty blond's place."
Steve was just finishing up stitches on one of the pit patients before Dr. Rhodes peeked behind the curtain.
"Don't have to say thank you for that," Steve reassured, "I love you, and I'll always take care of you."
Sharon giggled and dragged Nat out of the locker room, bidding the boys goodbye for now, until the party back at Steve's apartment. Steve snickered as Bucky watched Nat leaving the room.
Whenever Tony’s in the fine arts building, he tries not to play too loud. There are other music students who are far more skilled than he is, and sometimes he’s a little embarrassed to play louder like the others.
"My name is Dr. Samuel Wilson. If you listen to me and follow my rules, you'll make fine surgeons. If you don't, you'll be out of here in a week." He continued his charting before looking up again, like he'd clearly given his speech dozens of times. "Answer your pages when nurses or other attendings page you. And you better get there in time so the patient doesn't die. Your first shift here is forty-eight hours; do as you're told, then sleep when you can. Speaking of which, if I'm sleeping, don't wake me unless your patient is dying. That patient better be alive when I get there. Questions?"
Autumn brings a wonderfully crisp feeling in the air; Steve can’t get enough of how the campus looks as leaves finally fall to the ground. The wind carries the maroon and golden hues across campus, and he sighs in content as he strolls to his usual study area.
Steve tightens his group around Tony’s waist. “You love me, okay? You made vows, you stood in front of the city of New York saying that you loved me, you can’t take that back now-”
"Well, don't just stand there, just do it!" Steve exclaimed. "Wait—let me sedate him a little so he doesn't feel it as much."
Steve placed the paddles on her chest, adjusting as Wilson coached him. He heard his own voice his time, telling the nurse to charge, charge again, charge three times. He felt sicker as the girl's pulse was still nowhere to be found.
"We'll have to fix that, won't we?" Tony clapped his hands together. "We need to go grocery shopping."
Eva extended a tentative hand. “It’s very nice to meet you, Dr. Stark. Everyone speaks very highly of you around here.”
"That nick name is never gonna leave me, huh?" Steve smiled as he poured three glasses of water. "Your name's Megan, right?"
Suddenly, she finally removed the ring from her finger. The jewel seemed duller now that she wasn't wearing it. Tony knew what he wanted, knew that it wasn't right to string her along the way he had, but seeing the ring off her finger left him breathless.
He met Bucky in the living room, where he was quickly falling asleep on the couch. The soldier's eyes opened when he saw Steve entering the room again.
But Pepper looked happy. Happier than she looked in months, maybe even a couple years. Maybe it was worth a shot, if he could keep someone happy for once.
Tony froze. "I want to, Steve, but that doesn't just happen right away. Plus she's still here, and I don't—"
Steve liked routine. He normally would have fixed himself a cup of coffee and some eggs and toast for a real breakfast, but the damn underwear model made him sleep in. Now, there was only time for a quick sip of coffee and a bite out of a granola bar. He'd have to eat at the hospital.
pretty," Katie explained, "But Dr. Stark is not just pretty. He is more than pretty. He's gorgeous. Calvin Klein material."
That day at the hospital was another day of scut duties; Steve was spending the day taking patients to radiology or running blood to and from the blood bank. He was so lost in the routine of mundane activities that he didn't notice the same dark-haired girl waiting at the front desk of the surgical wing.
Car crashes and accidents kept Tony’s mind busy those days. Although the idea was a bit morbid, the critical patients required attention and round-the-clock care until they were in recovery. The neurosurgeon gladly volunteered to stay late, sending interns home and spending the night at the hospital.
Tony’s always the first one awake. Even with a tremendous lack of sleep over the years, he always wakes to the sight of his favorite super soldier fast sleep, mouth slightly agape. Even America’s golden boy snores when he sleeps.
It was always entertaining to see all the surgical staff gathered together without donning the usual scrubs, lab coats or stethoscopes. Every once in a while, Steve was reminded that his co-workers were just as human as he was. Once they arrived at the party, Eva immediately led Steve and the other interns to the food tables, marveling at all the different cuisine that laid before them. One of the best things about working in the city was that people of all cultures worked within the walls of the hospital, and with that meant some damn good food.
He’s supposed to be writing another paper for his art history class, but he decides it to be a problem for later tonight. Days like this are too wonderful to be wasted.
The room somehow grew quiet enough to hear a pin drop. Even the music stopped. Blood rushed in Steve's ears. Somewhere behind him, probably Sharon's voice, calling out to him. Saying something how Jake wasn't worth the trouble. At least Steve learned his name now. Still, the anger that was surging through Steve's body took him over, and before he could stop himself, he threw his fist against the intern's jaw. There was a sickening crush of bone meeting bone. The beer bottle shattered on the floor, snapping Steve out of his trance.
Sarah peeked around the nurses' station before pinching her son's arm. "My god, that Dr. Stark...I loved your father, but..."
He was probably being dramatic. He always was like that, jumping to conclusions and thinking the worst when it came to relationship troubles. Ever since Steve mentioned Tony talking to his ex, it was as if something changed slightly between them. Tony was still wonderful to him; treating him on dates, making meals if he could. Only now, there was a bit of doubt that crept into Steve's mind whenever Tony declined calls from the same person three or four times a day, or when Tony finally took the call outside of the room.
Steve was trembling now. "I don't know! Her vitals were steady the whole night, I even told the mom she'd be okay because everything was looking good—"
Natasha, Steve and Sharon all sat in the front row. Bucky glanced up at them, waving his fingers at them. The trio gave three sets of thumbs up, and while he knew they were trying to be supportive, he just felt a little nauseous. Behind them, the other interns had drinks and snacks in hand, swapping cash and snickering to each other.
Tony sighed just as dramatically as before, only this time laying on Steve's lap and feigning a somber expression on his face. "You love dogs more than me."
The teenager also did his fair share of chores around the apartment whenever Tony and Steve were out of the apartment for a while: dishes, getting up and dusting the ceilings and other places that were hard to reach without spider-like powers. He was very responsible and trustworthy, as he often liked to remind the superhero couple.
Tony steadied the intern's shoulders. "Breathe, Steve. It's going to be alright. I'm sure there are generators that help this thing power up. Everything will be fine."
"Page Dr. Anthony Stark from neuro," Dr. Wilson began, "and, uh...Rogers. Take...let's see here...Katie Stevens...to get a CT."
Steve nodded quickly. "I'm just fine, sir. I'm sorry about the delinquent charts. I'll get right on these and the post-op notes as well."
She gazed up at him, eyes so blue, eyes so lovely. The sound of her voice, hushed and quiet enough just for him made Tony nostalgic. It wasn't too long ago where he'd yearn for her voice at the end of a long day. She placed her arms around his waist, her body now pressed right against his. Tony felt dizzy.
After rounding on his patients, updating the families, and updating patient charts, Tony made his way to the cafeteria. One of the downfalls to the night shift was the lack of warm meals; the kitchen staff could only work so late. The cafeteria offered junk food in the vending machines and some subpar coffee—Tony would have to settle for chips and coffee as dinner.
Her hands found his hair, and she sighed in content when she felt the familiar scratch of his stubble on her neck. She couldn't help the soft moans that escaped her lips, only encouraging Tony.
"The little girl took me by surprise, so I didn't have a name yet," Alex admitted, "I wanted her to have a name that could have a nickname like me. Her name is Andrea, Andy for short."
The babies always made him feel better. They were so tiny, so happy to be laying in their cots and swaddled in blankets. He liked to see what their names were, when their birthday was. It was so odd, whenever he saw that their birthday was just a few hours ago. They were just so...new.
The mother reached her hand across the table, holding Steve's hand and squeezing. His heart stirred for a moment, seeing her eyes water with gratitude. He was just about to say something when Sharon came running over, eyes wide.
He can’t resist pressing his lips to Steve’s cheek, and his heart is soaring to see the blonde’s eyebrows furrowing together. Tony moves in again to kiss the other cheek, chuckling to himself when Steve relaxes and settles against his chest.
The team of surgeons were finally placing the heart inside of the tiny infant's chest. The sight of a heart so small usually would have left Steve in awe, but that morning's events left him numb. He pulled out a notepad and pretended to focus on the surgery before him, scrawling mindlessly until someone tapped him on the shoulder.
Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I don’t mean to stare, but I was just down the hall when I heard you playing.”
Tony sighs. “You’re right. Giant football stars like you would never be able to fit in this pathetic excuse for a bed.”
Once Sarah left the room, Steve noticed a familiar face standing behind the glass window. Tony looked on, as if he was trying to get a glimpse of the Peterson baby, but Steve knew why he was there.
By the time Steve finished, he heard some rustling in the bedroom. Goddammit. He'd been hoping the model would just sneak out in the time he was gone, like any other late-night hookup was supposed to do (although, it wasn't like he knew what late-night hookups did). He took a deep breath, facing the still nameless man that stood before him.
Among the interns, Sharon grew the closest with Steve. Often, the group was broken up in two during traumas or during any emergency pages. Because of this, Bucky and Natasha didn’t always get to interact with Steve the way Sharon did. The duo moved fluidly together during a trauma, following quickly in the other’s footsteps. In friendship and medicine, Steve and Sharon were two peas in a pod.
The night shift was a completely different world. It wasn’t often that Tony was at the hospital at night voluntarily; he always jumped at the chance to go home early. Late night surgeries happened every once in a while, and there were times he was called in to check on patients. Still, the night shift was a different atmosphere.
“You should get some rest. Before you complain, it’s almost one in the morning there, and you have an 8 am lecture, remember?” Steve is so smiley and full of sunshine even in the middle of the night, Tony catches himself wondering how he ever got someone to love him like this.
"Okay, you got me." He took a breath. "I...a colleague in New York was trying to convince me to come back. We were close, and they were just...being a little too insistent. I had an early morning, and you caught me having a bad conversation on a bad day."
fucking evening. He immediately grabbed himself a scotch and stayed at a corner table, away from the bustle of the party.
They were kissing for a moment at the front door of the apartment complex, and the stranger pulled away briefly and cleared his throat.
Again, Steve was probably just being dramatic. He tried to remember that when Tony handed him a cup of coffee. Steve liked his coffee light and sweet, something Tony always teased him about, since the neurosurgeon always took the coffee black. Tony didn't kiss him, not here in the hospital, but he let his hand brush against Steve briefly before backing away.
"Why not?" She traced a finger on his cheek gently. The touch was so subtle but it sent a chill down Tony's spine. He almost wanted to melt into her, kiss like he would before, touch her like he would before.
Christ, he sounded like he was from the 1940's. Going steady. He was known for being suave and charming, but when it came to Steve, he couldn't think properly. Any blood circulating to his brain that morning went straight to his pants the minute Steve got on his knees.
Steve knelt down and held her hands. "You need your rest so you can be there for your baby when it counts, okay? She's alright for now. I won't let her out of my sight, and when I need to go home, I'll ask the nurses to page me too."
He was barely thinking now, which wasn't exactly a good idea since he was driving in the rain and was about to pick up Pepper from her apartment. They didn't spend the night together—it definitely would not have been a good idea—but she suggested they get to work together. The counselor insisted that they started doing things as a couple, becoming the team that they used to be.
"That's all I needed to hear." Steve set down the child in the cot. "I need you to leave, I have to check on the Peterson baby. He's a preemie and he's prone to infections."
His life was so different compared to Steve's. Tony had no problem going to school or affording to stay in a home, and he definitely had his pick of whatever school or program he wanted to get into. Tony knew he was privileged; hearing about Steve and his success only made him grow fonder. Steve had fought for everything he had in his life; he was a good man.
"I'll have the interns call UNOS, okay?" Pepper offered her hand. "It's going to be tough waiting, but I'll have all the interns on it, okay?"
The intern laughed to himself as Jake stared at him in disbelief. The cab drove away before Jake could protest, and Steve made a point to wave goodbye until they were no longer in sight. They were the last group to leave the apartment complex, so Steve went back up to his place.
The brunet ran and blocked the door. "You can't run away from everything, Steve. Quit running from me."
But it was kind of nice, being Tony's friend. Almost-friend. They had normal conversations, there were no more longing glances from the stations or awkward meet-ups in on-call rooms.
"I meant it, when I wanted to be friends." Tony cleared his throat before continuing. "That way, I wouldn't lose you completely."
For a split second, there was a pause in conversation, and the excess of alcohol in Tony’s system decided it was the perfect time to introduce himself to Eva.
Tony felt like there were cement blocks attached to his feet. He couldn't bring himself to move from his spot in the trauma room. All he could look at was Steve and the look of horror that spread across his face the minute Pepper said her name. All the dread that been consuming his thoughts in the last few weeks was no longer just a nightmare, it was a dream come true.
Steve examined her arms and chest, noticing that her IV and wires were disconnected. He sighed in irritation, reconnecting them. He felt like strangling her, but he held his tongue. "Why did you page 911? Do you know what that means? I thought you were dying all alone in here. 911 is for emergencies."
"You know each other, how lovely! My Stevie just finished his first shift here. I was just waiting to hear all about it," Sarah replied.
The intern returned to the party, which seemed to have dwindled quite a bit since the remaining residents and attendings were called back into work. He noticed that his friends were also gone, a curse of being a surgical intern—one night off is never truly a night off. The only person left from his group was Eva, somber and looking lonely amid the doctors and staff she did not know.
A million years ago, Steve would have found Tony to be downright adorable. The neurosurgeon was almost blushing now, trying his best to look Steve in the eye but failing miserably. Despite his embarrassment, Tony still wore the same smile, the one that made Steve weak in the knees. For the first time in months, there’s a twinge of sadness in his heart again. It was no longer the same sadness that crashed over him before, unapologetic and unrelenting whenever he saw Tony after the breakup.
The next day at the hospital, Steve could not focus on anything other than the note from Eva. The small piece of paper was practically burning a hole in his pocket. He meant to call right after the grocery run, but his anxiety had gotten the best of them. By the time he had worked up the nerve to finally call Eva, it was far too late. He didn't want any insinuation of a booty call—he did not need
Steve shouldn't have cared. He shouldn't have cared about the way people snickered and glanced at him like he was something to be ridiculed; people in the hospital always had relationships, why was his situation any different? He hated the way anger boiled in his chest, especially with the way some of the other interns looked at him.
There was a bit of a truce between the two of them. There were no more withering stares from across nurses' stations, no passive-aggressive comments, no petty calls at 4 am to clean the ER. Both could occupy the break room for coffee and exchange pleasantries. Hell, they were catching up with each other now.
“Do you really have to go off and be a genius in Massachusetts? Can’t you just…be a local genius instead?”
Alex was unsure. "I slept plenty after my surgery, Dr. Rogers, I was wondering if I could just stay here..."
"Remind me to shut my mouth when Wilson's talking," Bucky muttered as he closed his eyes, "He hears everything."
Suddenly aware of his gaze, Eva pulled the intern aside and sat down. She leaned in and kissed his cheek.
Steve had no idea where his surge of confidence was coming from, but it was now or never. He fished around his pockets for a marker, taking Tony's hand and writing down his cell phone number. Tony took the opportunity to gently pull the blond close and kiss him. Steve froze for a moment until he melted into Tony's lips. The intern immediately dropped the marker, using his free hand to run it through Tony's hair. The scratch of neurosurgeons facial hair on his lips and chin was fucking addictive, so much so that Steve found himself pushing him onto the bed. Tony hummed in response and nearly fell apart when he felt Steve shaking the lab coat off his shoulders.
"We should get back." Eva stood up and grabbed her purse. "I've got that flight back to Hartford, remember?"
"You'll have plenty of opportunities to fool around with your attending in an on-call room, Rogers." Tony chuckled when Steve flushed rouge again. "Go on, then. Your shift isn't over."
As he clipped off the appendix, his scissors seemed to snag on the stump remaining. Blood pooled in the abdomen. Bucky's heart thumped loudly in his ears. He panicked as he looked at Dr. Fury, who remained stoic.
Back in the locker room, Steve sat next to his friend. The soldier was laying down on the bench, still donning the scrub cap.
"Okay, so you clipped it a little bit," Fury said calmly, "but you haven't pulled up on the strings yet. You can throw another stitch, then pull up."
He wanders the halls a little, eventually finding the source of the melodies. The brunet sitting on the bench is so absorbed into the music, and again, Steve finds himself smiling in adoration of this mystery pianist.
Bucky threw his arm around her. "You're safe. People actually to this hospital to get out of their unsafe houses."
"I can't remember everything, but I know he was amazing in bed. He even offered to cook me breakfast this morning." He smiled to himself, remembering how kind Tony was even after a hookup with a stranger.
"Say, let's go harass some interns," Tony said quickly, "it's been a while since we tortured some newbies together."
Steve’s vision is a little watery, but he smiles at Tony anyway. “You sound like a shitty teen romance novel.”
The sunny expression on Tony’s face faded as Bucky approached the station with lab results from one of their patients. The soldier was one of the poor souls assigned to neurosurgery that week, and he absolutely dreaded making conversation with the man.
"That's really nice. Your mother really is a superstar." Tony was a bit quiet for moment; it struck him just how different their lives were. It was endearing, to hear about the little bits and pieces of his life. Learning about Steve's life only made him ache about the life he left back in New York.
"This is me teaching you to shock a girl's heart since you didn't let me teach the first time," Wilson said quickly, "You better move unless you want to kill this girl."
He and Bucky had known each other for years, and Bucky had loved him even before the serum turned Steve into the super soldier he was now. They had something no one of that age would ever understand. Sure, Steve knew other men of The Howling Commandos who were like that also, but it wasn't something anyone talked about. They wouldn't. In those days, loving another man would get you locked up in an asylum. That wasn't where Steve wanted to live out the rest of his life. Not even that was better than waking up in the 21st century after a 75 year deep-freeze.
The phoenix on his hip reminded him of something he had said at the Stark Expo a few years ago, about a year before they had met each other. "
Steve almost flinched, but he wasn’t going to let Mr. Stark have the better of him. He could get anything he wanted out of anyone in this school, teachers included, and he wasn’t going to let Mr. Stark be the exception to that rule. Walking up to the desk the smug bastard sat at reading god knows what, Steve leaned over, gripping the side of the desk.
The 21st century was different. Being different was acceptable, more so than it had been in the 1940s. He still wasn't sure when it had happened, but something Tony said about the '70s and
“You’ve gotta fucking be kidding me,” Steve grumbled out loudly, letting his books slam down on his desk before turning back to glare at the teacher in front of the otherwise empty classroom. “This is bullshit, Mr. Stark!”
On the last day though, Tony's last day, Steve ended up getting another card. He stopped after entering the kitchen, his head tilted to one side, not having expected to see another card hanging there. Walking over to it, he pulled the card down from the magnet, reading over the card. Swallowing hard, he leaned back against the counter, taking a deep breath. Out of all the cards he'd gotten, this card was the best.
Steve looked up at Mr. Stark, his mouth still wrapped around his thick length. He didn’t want to stop. This was too fucking good, but Steve could see that Mr. Stark didn’t want to start. he wanted more. He wanted him. Pulling back slowly, he left a trail of saliva from the tip of his teacher’s cock to his chin.
"I'll get one of my own too." He looked down at his own chest, scrunching up his face. "Probably have to put it over my breast though. My cleavage is kind occupied."
