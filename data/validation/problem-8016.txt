He glanced back to the small shrine with its smoking incense and spilled oil. Oil he had been about to light via cotton wick. He made a soft 'ah' of realization.
Candy got out of the car and politely introduced herself. The man was the caretaker, Mr. Dudley. His wife the housekeeper was waiting up at the house for them. He was going into town for some supplies and would be back shortly. Ewan almost asked if they were any relations to the Dusrleys from Hill House but a scorching glare from Candy shut him up.
There was also Longbottom with his beautiful blue Long Tail Skipper and Granger with her Giant Tiger Moth and its dappled wings. Weasley the younger had bonded with a stunning Madagascar Moon while Weasley the older had ended up with an insanely furry orange Jewel Dalceridae.
“You’re the leader.” Anthony murmured. “You’re the one who been bringing the rebels together and organizing them. We knew that there had to be someone.”
The Iron King had no heart.
Eugené stuck her head and shoulders from the window. "It's just a house. We go in, get the shots and get out. No big deal. Right?"
The older man sat back in his chair, joining his hands across his taut stomach as he appraised the young man before him.   Spencer Reid had come recommended by someone he trusted, someone who done invasive and in depth background and security checks on the man before him before letting him even come near to her treasured sub.
“You don’t sound too sure of that anymore. You said it yourself, the Iron King is dead. Your duty is fulfilled.” He murmured the last words against Anthony’s cheeks them claims his mouth in a devastating kiss that made the smaller man weak in the knees.
Beautiful display boxes were interspersed with thick reference books and science magazines. Movie cases were stuffed on shelves with geeky knick knacks and hand woven and comfortable looking afghans were tossed along with colourful knitted pillows and a thick and decadent woven rug.
The first month was quiet. He was hardly home and when he did drag himself home from the library, he would flop face first unto the bed and sleep like the dead. School kept him busy. Social navigation kept him frustrated and grumpy. He cooked the simple dishes his mother taught him how to make and ate them distractedly while peering at his laptop or at his reference books.
"Thank you Rodney" Teyla smiled and got to work. Ronon copied, feeling a bit stupid but was willing to humour his teammates if they thought it was a legitimate concern. He'd never heard of someone getting 'skin cancer' but there was a lot about the universe he still didn't know.
The whine of Rhodes’ thrusters drew closer, the gleam of his armor tarnished by soot and ash. “They got in through one of the intake valves, the godless scum. Tore right through the reinforced titanium.” He held a piece of melted slag in one hand. “Some kind of thermobaric ordinance. Used at the base of the main solar array. It didn’t do much damage to the machine itself but the fuel-oxygen combustion of the bomb ruptured the photovaltic tanks and set off a chain reaction.”
“All of that will be dealt with accordingly Phoebus.” Soleil District’s Governor sat forward, her grey hair pinned in ringlets that fell around her shoulders. “What must be addressed now is the Penumbra threat. We have all underestimated the shadow lands and dismissed them as scattered bands of scavengers, lurking in the darkness beyond Sol’s blessed gaze. Now we now that they are more organized and much more of a threat to our way of life and the safety of our people.”
He tucked that book away and plucked another book of swatches, flipping it open to the other side of the spectrum. "For your submissive, supple leather for strength, lace trim for to show a hint of skin. Silk embroidered to match the symbol of your family crest. Imported handmade ribbon lacing the back with suitable placed straps and cut outs in the trousers to give the illusion of being bound."
"Hey, Dizz." Johnny's smile was warm when he stepped up to her, handsome as ever.
He was basically a prisoner to one of the most powerful crime families in Chicago, kidnapped from his life for god knows how long in the house of a ruthless and dangerous Dom.
"We're skinny dipping? No one told me about the skinny sipping."
The border lands were a long stretch of nothingness, flat arid land where nothing grew and the heavy clouds belched up lightning and caustic rain that fell almost constantly.
“Ha ha funny ha, joke wolf.” Stiles snorted and hopped up unto the wooden bar stool, hooking his feet on the bars. “Still, thanks.”
He look away, his skin flushed as he twisted his leg to show the Sol damned mark on his inner thigh. The brunet stared at the mark in disbelief, reaching forward as if to touch it before stopping in mortification. He glanced up at Anthony with his own shame swirling in those grey eyes. One never touched a mark not their own, not without permission. That was known even in the deepest of penumbra bad lands.
They doted on the man, worshiping his body until he was aching and near tears from the pleasure. Hands and lips and tongues mapped his body, learning all new spots and re-learning the old ones. He watched with rapt attention as Shika lubed up his long fingers and worked them into Naruto's clenching pink hole; the blond arching into the burn as he was carefully stretched.
He would not be baited by this man and his stunning smile. He lifted hi chin in defiance, meeting the Captain's gaze with narrowed eyes. He felt vulnerable without his armor.  He missed its weight on his shoulders, the power at his fingertips, its golden gleam under Sol's gaze, the shield it provided from the world around him.
He quietly contemplated the few conversations that he’d had with the Thunder God in the past, about the Dwarves of Nidavellir and the artisans of Asgard, his eyes tracing the complex path of the exquisite gold.
Stiles tried to shrug but the weight of the body on his shoulder made it awkward. "I bribed him with Elderberry wine. A whole bottle."
“Huh… You remembered how I liked it?”
Ronon just chuckled and kissed his mate once more.
Rhodes would stay behind in the Sunlight Kingdom, sworn protector of the citadel in Anthony’s stead; just in case the enemy sought to attack at a time of perceived weakness. The General had eventually nodded, grasping Anthony on the forearm and bringing their foreheads together.
It wasn't a question or a request. Still, Spencer wasn’t going to acquiesce so easily. Not even to a Dom who could have him swimming with cement shoes within the hour.
"Thanks" he grunted as the hands pulled away, voice gruff because he hadn't had someone touch him like that in a long time.
SRY LAMP. LIKD IT.
The Iron King would not fail.
Naruto placed one hand on Kiba's thigh, his other hand threaded through with Shika's as he swallowed heavily around the cock in his mouth while clenching around the one in his ass. Kiba growled, utterly enthralled by the sight of those round ass cheeks jumping at every thrust, Naruto's thick red cock bobbing and leaking against his taut stomach.
------------------
“I have to say, though, I do feel beautiful and desirable so maybe Vicky has the right idea.”
It had taken a week of sleeping like the dead and crying in the shower before he’d traced a path back to the spot. From there he could see almost the whole valley and a large swath of uninterrupted starry sky. It was peaceful, it was beautiful and most importantly, it was quiet. No werewolf drama, no teen drama, no family drama, no fucking drama at all.
The shorter youth tossed a look over his shoulder while he gestured at the interned corpses around them. "Who's gonna report us?  These guys?"
The bar at the fancy smancy hotel was a monster of a thing made from polished dark wood and shiny brass fittings. Bottles on bottles of obscenely expensive liquor gleamed in perfect lighting on the mirrored shelves in exquisitely organized rows.
Laura tried to argue but Peter yanked her into the shadows with a sharp growl. There was some shuffling from the tree line but eventually their footsteps were heard getting further and further away. Soon after the rest of the wolves slipped into the trees, their heartbeats growing fainter and fainter until only Talia remained.
Anthony shuddered at the want that strummed in him at hose whispered words. It hit him like a tidal wave and he tried to fight it before it overwhelmed and drowned him.
People like Steve didn’t fit in a place like this. Hell, he wouldn’t have been able to get a job as one of the smartly dressed and smiling bar staff. He certainly didn’t belong in this shiny, rich, honey-coloured world.
He frowned as he called down to the laundry service. Frowned as he made himself a cup of tea and made another mental list of places to check.
The genius looked glorious, laid out so perfectly for him on the blanket, his pale skin glowing from the colours of the nebula all around them. The whole world was beauty and colour and he lost himself to the hazy pleasure of sex with his mate.
“Fuck yeah.” Riddick growled, “Just like that.”
At that abrupt dismissal, Spencer let himself be escorted out of the room and  down a hall to where a brightly dressed Penelope Garcia stood waiting with a sunny smile and clapping hands. Her Sub, Emily Prentiss, was serene at her side in a wine red pants suit, her gun metal grey collar gleaming from the open collar of the shirt.
“Hey no, not like that. They’ll be consultants and get paid a generous stipend for their efforts. They’d be making a huge contribution to the project after all.
She pulled her frizzy hair into a bun at the nape of her neck, wrapping it tight and securing it with a black band. She slipped a clack stocking over the bun to keep it neat. Her black dance leotard went on next, no underwear as the shapewear kept her secure. It covered her from neck to ankle but she rolled up the legs and arms, pulling the neck until it rode low.
"I've got all I need for now. Give our guest a hot and a cot. We can start again in the morning."
The sound of a prison shiv entering flesh was like cutting into a ripe watermelon and the man fell back against the hallway with a choked off cry, holding his hands against the wounds in his chest.
He kept his hands on the were wolf, cupping his cheeks. Derek was hot to the touch, his skin prickly where his ever present five o clock shadow grew. He looked so perfect, kneeling there, with the ears and the collar. Stiles could just kiss him.
"Doesn't matter." he cut her off again, his voice flat and unforgiving. "Your pet druid isn't stepping a foot into our territory or did you forget what happened the last time you neglected your pack's sworn duty to the land."
He'd been among the last to leave, making sure that his people were safely out of danger and that no one had been left behind in their haste. He could do nothing else. He was his mother's son. And with her death, he was the leader of his people. He felt a sharp pang of anguish slice his heart. He was too young for this. He wasn't ready.
Shit. Okay. He was an intelligent young man. He came from a long line of strong, brave and clever Chinese ancestors. He was a son of the great house of Chang. He could handle a ghost.
"That's great, buddy." Stiles nodded contemplatively. "I trust the princess and her way too serious father more than that bag of cats grand pappy of hers."
He’d found his jacket.
*I claim you. Draconis.*
And some more letter fridge magnets.
Tony keened, body trembling as he grasped at Steve's shoulders, searching for some anchor in the ocean he was lost in. Steve was so hot, his skin salty and sweet under Tony's tongue.
"The movie yes, but the book's ending was ambiguous at best." Ewan scoffed softly, getting an elbow in the arm from Eugené. He shrank back from her sharp appendage. "I'm just saying that this is an incredibly bad idea. Every single horror movie starts on this kind of premise."
"Geez lady, get to the point already. Not all of us like watching someone standing around in the woods having a meeting that could have been handled by email. Nor do I appreciate people trying to blow smoke up my ass. Just tell me why you called me here."
Dom/Sub Culture.
“The point is, we were both in a really fucked up place. We couldn’t even take care of ourselves much less see about other people. Thank God for Cora and Melissa or we’d both probably be dead by now.”
Warning" Explicit Sex.
Sure. Right.
Stiles fell off the couch laughing.
Ronon woke groggily, a sure sign that he'd been given the good drugs. He normally forwent pain medication on the city, not wanting his body to get accustomed to the comfort it provided. He need to be able to push through the pain as he did when he was still a runner. Life on Atlantis may be a good one, but he was Pegasus born and until every wraith was dead and their bodies left to rot on poisonous worlds, he would let himself go soft.
North Pass was lost. Nothing would be salvaged from the solar works. The fortress would probably weather the fires well enough but rebuilding would take years. His mind was already running through plans to compensate for the loss of resources and how the solar power grid would hold up under the demand. He would leave it for the council of governors to hash out the details. That’s what they were there for.
They’d stopped for the night at a local strip mall, sneaking into one of the only stores with the metal security door rolled down and still intact. They’d learned pretty quickly not to make any noise if they could help it.
He opened the door carefully, hearing the harsh ragged breaths and seeing the trembling shoulders. Panic attack, or close to it. Erik got him out to the road, sitting next to him as he slowly calmed. The sun was just cresting the buildings, turning the city skyline gold. The street was peaceful and quiet as they sat together.
"Well, if you have nothing to say to us, we have other ways of gaining information." The rebel Captain looked over his shoulder at his guard. "Take him to the Doc."
Noises attracted zombies and other walking horrors that now felt brave enough to walk openly; snacking on whatever they could get their hands, tentacles or ravenous glow clouds around.
He tried to look the little shells up online but had no luck. McGee had laughed at his efforts and Abby had been too busy to more than humour him about the now dust residue which was all that had been left behind by even the gentlest of handling.
"You got a problem with nudity, Mckay?" John paused from where he had been unzipping his fly, his dog tags bright against his hairy chest. "Cuz I know we've all seen each other naked a bunch of times on missions."
Bullying. Revenge. Assault.
If these were the ones who had him, then he was in hotter water than he’d previously thought. Still, he’d made his way out of tighter spots that this before. He gave a sly grin of his own, tilting his head.
The droid had been taken apart expertly and laid out in a parody of resting peacefully, it's innards extracted and laid in a gruesome web of wires and nodes. The data processing unit has been scooped out of the split open cranium and was on suspension grid, electrode needles stuck into various parts of the gelatinous neural net and connecting via glowing wires to some kind of computer terminal.
He banished such thoughts and they came to the large clearing, their eyes taking in the contingent of Hales gathered at the far side. Stiles pulled up his ski mask to the bridge of his nose, the  sharp white of the snarling fox fangs glinting in the fading light of the setting sun. beside him both Heather and Danny were doing the same, their gold eyes peering out over snarling maws just as his was glowing red.
He could not even bury her properly. Give her the old rites as all the old chieftains had done. He would never be able to see her off to the underworld with fresh fruit and meat, feathers, soft furs and jeweled stones as was befitting of her stature and grace.
The tech was odd and faintly bio-luminescent and he delved head first into a study of it. His fingers worked nimbly, his sharp mind devouring the new and interesting hungrily. He feasted on learning, investigating, discovering. Glutted himself on satisfaction as he put the strange little thing back together. When it finally clicked its little legs together and blinked its little blue glow lights at him, he gave a soft, joyful laugh.
She ducked passed him into the living room, checking for others and thankfully finding none. This was the part of her plan that had been the most wobbly. There was a packed brick of weed on the coffee table and she grabbed it, making her way out through the backdoor and over the rickety fence.
Tony tolled his eyes. "You need my tech on this. And you wouldn't mind one bit if you got it for free or good as. And don't you lecture me on what's right,  Cyclops, or you wouldn't have come at me with extortion right off the bat."
Rodney shook, his head thrown back as he cried out from the change of angle and slow pace. His skin all but glowed, the nebula stretching out behind him to encompass the whole sky as if he was the centre of Ronon's universe.
Later that night when they are sitting together, a wooly afghan tucked around their legs and Carey Grant smiling on the screen, the kisses are as sweet and hot as Tony had hoped they'd be. He let himself be tugged to the bedroom and into bed, glutting his senses on the man who'd slipped into his heart so deftly.
Eventually, the young man looked up at him, all wide eyed and vulnerable and something in his chest twisted at the sight. He was beautiful, with big brown eyes and flushed, creamy skin.
Lamar flourished within the new peer group, making fast friends with the team and growing new confidence professionally.  He asks Tony to be his plus one for the annual museum gala and Tony accepts, flattered and enchanted to see Lamar stutter though his invitation.
Derek sunk even lower in his seat as Stiles mind raced, his face flushing deeper as the smaller man inhaled sharply. Stiles voice was low and careful when he finally spoke.
The first time he'd whipped around to glare at the man but had only smirked at him in return. The few times after that Anthony made sure to not give the man the satisfaction of a response.
yeah.... so i'm behind. I will try to catch up but i'm not stressing it.
Stiles worked his jaw back and forth in the familiar exercise, feeling as the scars along his cheek and neck pulled dully. The nerves along that swatch of skin had withered years ago so he no longer felt the pain that crept like fire under his skin.
He closed his eyes and went to sleep.
The frail treaty between the  Vulpēs Vulpini and the Canis Lycaon of Beacon Hills had held for the last two years, balanced delicately on the reputation and respect of Sheriff Janek Stillinski. The Reynard of the Vulpini was his own son and the sheriff stood as the only authority Stiles showed any kind of deference too. On the other hand, Talia Hale, the Alpha of the Lycaon and Deputy Mayor of Beacon Hills, was someone who Stiles didn't respect in the slightest.
Anthony blinked, unsure of what to make of the comment. He kept silent as the Captain chuckled to himself, turning towards the table behind him. He had the Legionnaire’s head in his hands when he turned back around, half of its face plating stripped away. Tony clenched his jaw at the sight of the odd tech cobbled together at the back of its’ half hollow skull.
According to google maps, the route back to the first house cut through the warehouse district and across the large dry canal. She'd timed it before, running a similar length on the school track and around the neighbourhood a few times to build stamina.
The captain looked at Anthony in shock, his beautiful face hardening with fury. He stalked the few steps between them and loomed over Anthony like some dark behemoth.
He finally answered the other man’s question, his voice thready and wet. “Maybe there are some battles you just don’t walk away from. Lord knows I’ve walked away from many that I shouldn’t have.”
He didn’t know what would become of this, if anything would.
There were five in the crew, four diggers and one driver in the cab of the vehicle. He went for the driver first, catching the man as he stepped out to relieve himself. The man was snatched up and put in a sleeper hold until he blacked out, his wrists and feet secured quickly by the legionnaire. The inside of the truck was just as fascinating, Anthony’s mind racing as he explored. It used some kind of carbon based energy which fascinated him to no end.
By now the media packages he'd had prepped for years had been delivered to almost every news outlet in the world. Within minutes, everyone would have all the gritty details and the whole rotten egg would be cracked wide open.
As Penelope tucked her arm around Emily's waist and led them all further down the corridor, talking excitedly about Spencer's stay at the mansion; the true magnitude of the situation finally hit him.
Spencer looked up from where he'd been studying the polished brass studs of his carrying case. The old man's cane tapped against the dark wood floor as he strolled towards the sitting area, the metal cap on the heavy carved wood walking stick, echoing sharply at every step.
Draco trailed to the back of the group, having been to the ceremonies before. It didn't matter if you rushed forward, choosings happened in their own sweet time.
He only cared that his beloved Queen and Princess were gone and that the Dragon's hadn't saved them. Thus he'd ordered the Pass collapsed and formed the Dragon Lance Corps with their huge iron fitted crossbows to deal with any Dragon that dared poked its head beyond the steep cliffs.
The door clanked and swung open suddenly, making him flinch and squeeze his eyes shut with a grunt.
He gave a sigh. Whatever. He would go and have a good time. And with his little dog too. He chuckled and set Toto in the basket, taking one last glance at the ears. It really was too bad.
Thus it had always been and thus it would ever be.
“Yeah I guess…” Stiles nodded sagely. “It would be more like Acute Sensory Perception since you’re still within the five senses. Man, I wonder….”
"Sure thing boss."
Then, it was time for the epic road trip: Spike and Xander edition.  Sadly, they couldn’t secure a plane and driving was surprisingly hard with so many wrecked and derelict cars blocking the road ways.
The Nara propped his head on one hand and shook it.  "We'll get stuck together if we stay like this. Troublesome."
"Thank you." he murmured as Dwayne sat next to him on the piano bench. For getting him out of the rain. For welcoming him to his home so that he wouldn't be alone. For taking care of Tony in a way few others did or would. "for everything."
Anthony looked up at the man unblinkingly. “We shall all fall before Sol’s merciless wrath. We underestimated you once. We will not do it again. You will flee before the reign of fire from above or you shall be crushed but its might, rebel scum. ”
Usually, Tony would have bristled at the kid glove treatment but considering he'd been chasing down his suspect from DC to LA then down to New Orleans only  to have the lone killer turn out to be a group of insane and brutal zealots with a penchant for knife play. The photos of previous victims flashed through his eyes, interspersed with glimpses of the bodies that had been kept like trophies in the warehouse they'd just raided.
Anthony nodded at Rhodes’ fiery words but he did not feel as confident. There was something out there. Something coming closer. He could feel it. Something in the darkness that was beyond Sol’s gaze.
“No.” he shook his head. “No. it can’t be. Mother Nyx wouldn’t do this to me.”
He waited a month for the old woman to return, going through the motions of collecting swamp toad bile,  harvesting the young bulb root of the myrtle blossom and curating the large collection of jars and bottles that she demanded by kept clean and organized.
He met a young red haired woman called Lily in the woods one day, so far from the wild haired little girl who used to make mud pies with him in old man Alberforth's field. She was as beautiful and headstrong as ever, seeking him out for conversations about things totally different from what girl's her age usually filled their minds with.
He was holding on to the last bit of his sanity, the various thoughts that circled his mind like a maelstrom since he'd been three years old. When Steve got like this, fucking him slow and steady until Tony surrendered completely, it always felt like he was falling from some steep edge.
"A whole bottle? Where did you get a whole bottle of that stuff? Only Dragon Lancers get entire bottles."
The brunet followed his gaze, back to the shadowed door where the Captain slowly stepped into the light. Those blue eyes were cold and calculating as the blond leaned his broad frame against the door way.
He wasn't going to be lugging a ton of glowy rocks back to the gate. No fucking way.
He stopped abruptly at the sight of a thin figure on the other side of the gate.
Ronon was a patient man. He would wait until they were in a more private place before approaching the man about sharing blankets. The genius was a practically man, often talking about missing sex and Ronon knew that the other man had taken several partners on Atlantis.
********
Spike went into game face and grinned wildly as he reached down to cup Xander though the soaked satin panties, biting down into the flesh of his neck as Xander came from the pleasure of it.
Ronon had been helpless to resist, nodding jerkily as he came hard. Then it was Rondey's turn to be smug for a month, though he agreed to keep his lover's secret. It was Ronon's choice to slot himself into the simple warrior's role but that didn't stop him from ranting to his lover in the privacy of their rooms without having to dumb things down.
"Yeah. It seemed rather insensitive a gift after I sent it though, considering Whiskey Outpost and all but…'
Xander had faux chuckled along with the gallows humour, already edging away behind Spike as the noise of wet crunching and smacking turned his stomach.
Shepard had the goons running around the city, battening down the hatches as all the ATA positive pilots shuttled the Athosians and most of their possessions off the main land and though the gate to the alpha site.
Armed with this knowledge, Wufei found and printed year book photos of both boys and had them framed. He then went to the local Chinese market and bought incense, oils and some sweets and delicacies. He also bought some flowers and took some cash from the ATM.
"Hi Tony, I'm Erik."
With one last glance up and down the street, she put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, aiming for the town car. A block away she opened the door and rolled out onto the street, scrabbling to her feet and ducking off into the alley; leaving the convertible to careen into the luxury vehicle with a spectacular crunch  of metal and glass.
He could feel the man startle as the rough feel of his scars, the warm fingertips gently feeling along Stiles cheek bones up to the ridge of his forehead, where his eye brow was split.
The surprisingly calloused fingers tapped on the bar top in a cherry little pattern. The deep velvet voice chuckled. “The man has good tastes. And cocky too… starting off with the thousand dollar a shot whiskey before the circus even begins….”
The wind dropped suddenly as Heather and Danny stilled beside him. Stiles gave Scott a lazy look, his voice low and promising death as he spoke. "Is my dad one of those in danger Scotty? Or is that some kind of ham handed threat your alpha put you up to?"
Her soft step swished against the thick rugs that lined the cold marble floors. She smelled like citrus, her flame red hair falling loose around her shoulders. It had been quite a scandal amongst the court as she was happily bonded, her mate Hogan too smitten with his wife to care that she didn’t curl and pin it like other bonded ladies of good repute. She set the tray laden with his meal at his elbow, nudging a few of his little mechanical trinkets out of the way carefully.
“We will find them and burn them all the way to their blackened hearts.”  He gave the council a solemn nod before standing, his soul mark pulsing under his armor.  “I will not fail you again.”
Six months later Erik looked up from his tinkering to see Tony walking towards him, holding two cups of coffee carefully as he padded on slippered feet across the garage.
"That doesn't look right."
He didn't even realize that he'd been weeping silently. It was something he'd always ended up doing when Steve took his time, making love to him in that tender way that shook him to his core.
Fuck Potter and his fighting Dragon Moth.
The word echoed through the tense silence.
He sacrificed a couple wet wipes to the cause, cleaning off most of the sweat and dirt of the road and soon enough he was slipping on the red panties with a sigh. The thin satin felt awesome against his bare skin, smooth as it slide along the line of his legs, the curve of his ass.
Suddenly, the beam lifted away, the sound of replusors whining as the metal bent and buckled. Ironman tossed the beam away sending it crashing into the next room. Next thing he knew, he was being held carefully in metal arms as they took off through the large hole he'd made when he'd crashed through the wall.
The resulting explosion would sure decimate the underground facility they were standing in, funneling heat and flame outwards through the man-made tunnels.
It was a man, thin as a rake with drawn cheeks and huge dark eyes and pale, sallow skin. He was taking off the chains, which clanked noisily together as he pulled them around and around through the wrought iron bars. One side of the huge gate creaked open, it's hinges screaming at the movement. It grated awfully on the ears and they all flinched back.
But alas, Rodney tore his gaze away and stepped back towards the door, taking a deep and ragged breath and adjusting himself in his pants. He made Ronon promise to meet him in the hanger in an hour and stumbled from the room, leaving the man aching with need and no lover to indulge that need with.
He looked back at the burning forest, the orange glow looked sinister as it seeped through the trees. He could faintly hear the crackling of the ancient logs splitting over the waves of the ocean and his heart mourned deeply.
The man's eyebrow quirked infinitesimally though his expression didn't change. "She also said that you could be trusted."
Character death. As in one character is a ghost.
“Huh?”
Rounding out the penultimate with some Tony/Steve fluffy smut. i love my boys and they deserve t be happy.
"I didn't say that. Well, not exactly." he shrugged helplessly. "Not the sad sack part anyway."
He glanced over to the rest of the ship and walked over to the overlook. People were looking to him and he would be the leader they needed.
"Like Star Trek? The holodeck thing?"
"That is wonderful, my friend. I am so happy for you both." Teyla's face brightened with joy. "It would be my honour to stand with you. John had told me about the many rules dictating partnership and mating on earth and I hope that one day we may stand in Rodney's homeland and witness your union there as well."
All except the glowing green heart stone that was left behind. His father's stone was a vibrant emerald green, speaking to a patient and restful soul. It matched the beautiful blue that his mother had possessed, although Stiles had never seen it.
He debated for a second whether to warn them of the danger but kept his lips pressed firm together. He would surely perish in the resulting explosion but at least he would manage to take out the rest of the rebel base with him.
He went to the Ikea store and came back with several free standing shelves, some cleaning supplies, bed sheets and a couple of pots and pans for the kitchen. Anything else he would either pick up another time or live without.
That night, as he shook in his lover's arms, he felt like he'd found home. He no longer had to try to make a family out of people who didn't love him back. He'd found a new love, new friends and, if Seeley was being serious, a new job that satisfied his need to serve and protect.
But the man was also a rebel, an enemy of all Anthony had even held dear. A threat to all that he’d dedicated his life to protecting.  How could he join with him? How could he stand by his side through life, never knowing the Sol’s warmth or kiss ever again? How could he live in knowing that Rhodes and the new Iron King would be mounting a war against the shadow lands sooner or later, intending to break their ranks and drive them back into the waste lands?
She blinked away the sting of tears and hugged him back just as tightly. "I missed you too Johnny."
The elevator sped up to the penthouse, barely making a sound to distract him from his own turbulent thoughts. He wandered his way to the bedroom, pushing open the door and leaning against the frame.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
He found a strange young man gripping the wheel and sobbing, dark curls tumbling around his face as he hunched over. A quick look in the backseat showed black garbage bags overflowing with clothes and other belongings.
It had been a time of blood and ash. A time of countless bodies scorched and burning in the fields along the penumbra border. When the shadowed armies had finally been driven back into the dark, their strength and will all but broken, the Citadel had decreed it as a blessing from the Sun God himself. They were his chosen peoples and were entitled to all upon which his endless gaze fell.
Her face took on a thunderous expression as she scowled at him.  "So how about you shut up, man up and let's get this fucking over with, Ewan."
Derek deserved better. Shit. They all had deserved better.
They don't even make it to the little house, falling together in a small patch of soft grass within a copse of trees near the back of the cottage. They didn't talk about missions or gossip about the goings on in Kohona and beyond. Their communication was non-verbal, touch and taste and sight and smell.
Stiles made a sound like buzzer, cutting her off. "EEEEEh. Not happening. Pull the other one."
He started getting really worried by the time dinner had rolled around and there were no signs of his friends. He tried ringing their phones but reception near the house was shitty at best. Finally he asked the B&B owners to call the police. Two officers came around, asking him questions and getting as much information as he could.
“So much for rabble scum with nothing but luck on their side.”
Draco kept his head down, letting his mother handle her irate husband. Unlike Lucius, he had no aspirations to have been part of the elite War Eclipse. For him, the terror and danger of being a member of the battle corps outweighed the supposed the fame and fortune that came with it.
That night, he set up a shrine in front of the lava lamp and placed the pictures of both young men amongst the offerings. Falling gracefully to his knees, he lit the incense and set some of the money on fire, bowing to the shrine. He asked the spirits to be appeased, to please protect the home and it inhabitant and to finally find peace.
On his other side, his delta fox and left hand, Danny Mehealani huffed a laugh as he kept pace along the wooded path. "Or the time you spread the rumor that the Hale kids were infected with lice and they all had to stay home from school for the two weeks needed to apply the treatment. I swear Cora Hale was going to wear your guts for garters because she had to miss out on the soccer final against Beacon Falls. I thought she was going to wolf out right there in the hallway."
He never even saw the blow that knocked him out coming.
"Dunno why…" Tony confessed breathlessly, squirming as he clenched around the hot cock buried deep in his ass. "Jus' happens."
He hugged his brother close one last time and kissed him on both cheeks and his forehead. Scott was already crying, which just made Stiles tear up. It was a soggy good bye. The chances of Stiles coming back alive were very slim.
Xander was painfully hard, pre-cum soaking the front of the panties as his cock head peeked out from the thin elastic waist band. He relaxed into spike’s embrace, tilting his head to one side as a silent surrender.
He drank the rest of his coffee in silence, offering quiet company because that’s all that he could do. He couldn’t fix this in his workshop. This wasn’t like some kind of broken machine he could run a diagnostic on. There wasn’t some part to switch out, some upgrade to apply.
Ronon chuckled and placed a hand on Rodney's shoulder, pushing him along gently to where John and Teyla were already taking off their shoes and hanging their weapons on a nearby fallen tree trunk.
Draco himself, preferred the steed built for long distance flight. He loved the sky and fantasized about keeping to the air for hours on end as he sped towards the horizon, unknown lands unfurling before him.
"What happened?" his voice croaked and Teyla helped him drink some cool water.
“People like us. We don’t often get a chance to cross paths. Not without violence that is. We’ve got war in our blood and always will. We were born fighting and will probably meet our end that way too.”
No matter, he’d walk it off soon enough.
He hurried forward, checking for the driver's safety. T'Challa kept the car for sentimental purposes, letting Erik check it every so often to keep it in working order.
He loved it though. He loved his nomadic life.
She must have seen the look of disbelief on his face because she scoffed loudly and waved her hand. "Believe me, if the Bossman had been upset with you in any way, we would have been having a different conversation entirely."
"You don't have to do this you know."
The car rocked as the other man settled next to him, his shoulder warm and firm against Stiles as he leaned back unto the glass next to him. Derek shook his head at the offer of a beer and stared up at the sky in quiet companionship.
Draco looked up, marveling at the sunbeams as they shone through the leaves and his heart stopped in his chest. Near the canopy top, wings unfurled to a span of almost forty feet and blazing the colour of fire, sat a Semioptila fulveolans Mabille.
"Speaking of deadlines… when is the presentation exactly?"
The shadow user balanced them out, bringing a sense of calm and peace to the savage brashness both Naru and Kiba had way too much of. Their love making changed, losing that sense of urgency and taking on a deeper, more emotional meaning. Shika had worshipped them, kept them on the edge of ecstasy and taught them a few tricks that completely blew their minds; among other things.
He was a king. He was the Iron King.
“Ah. Finally a reaction.” He smirked. “Seems like I’ve hit a nerve. Such faith in your holy protector. Let’s see if the faith is returned or if you will die here, cold and alone in the dark.”
Training ground sixteen looked the way it usually did, a small, grassy clearing surrounded by the ever present towering trees. Under the shade of one such tree Akamaru lay, gnawing on a fallen branch; his tail whapping happily on the ground. A familiar slim figure lay next to him, hands behind their head as they stared up into the bright blue sky.
Draco felt a something ripple through him, like the ringing of a clear and beautiful bell. *Hello Gorgeous*, he greeted mentally and was almost blown away by proud response that resounded though his mind. He could feel his eyes tearing up as the Mabille fluttered its giant wings, its two long hind fronds flared. This was a moth built for long flight, strong and agile and beautiful and perfect.
She'd been on the next ship out.
October 7th - Auction
Derek smiled as they pulled apart.
"Yeah, he's says Canada welcomes and recognizes life mates  of the same gender but that the USA still has problems with accepting it, especially in the military. He's trying to get everyone on the city brought under a protected treaty. It's slow going."
Reaper’s lips twitched at the corner as he leaned against the doorway.
After two months of making time for each other, Lamar finally invited Tony up to his small apartment. Tony felt honoured, touched to be welcome into such an intimate space. Everything in small apartment said something about the man, laying him open in a way that Tony was certain few had ever seen.
She gave him a flat look, glancing at the prisoner before turning back to her brother. They seemed to have some kind of silent conversation before she scoffed and rolled her eyes.
The clothes consisted of a thick knitted sweater of dark brown and some grey woolen pants. He found a pair of sock rolled up in one of the heavy boots and a set of fingerless gloves in the other. They looked well maintained and smelled clean. There was also a wash cloth with a sliver of soap wrapped in it. He decided to tackle getting clean first, before the water lost its warmth.
Adjusting the optics, Anthony observed them for a while, taking careful note of what the diggers wore, where they were and what kind of equipment they were using to dig. The vehicle looked fascinating and for a moment, he wished that he could just set it all aside and explore how the massive thing worked. Citadel mechanics all functioned on direct solar energy conversion and looked and sounded nothing like these machines.
“I may be horny, but I’m not fucking dumb.” Reaper gave him a flat look. “I can drop you off on the nearest planet right now, you just say the word, but I’m not letting you free on this ship for a fucking second. And I really don’t want to have to kill you. Today at least.”
“I have a duty?” he finally whispered and the captain smirked.
“The latest attack on the Solar Forge out at Lost Leaf. That’s the tenth one that been hit along the border in as many months. ”
The door swung open and he blinked at the light that flooded through the doorway. There were three guards were silhouetted in the dim blue and he followed them without protest until they entered a large, well lit space.
Tony clenched his jaw and bit back on an acid retort. It wasn't worth it to argue. Not now. He'd been planning on doing that anyway. Turning back to his computer, he mentally set aside the small sealed evidence bag in his pocket.
"Okay, Mckay. Time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn."
“Take off your clothes or I will rip them off you.” The man growled. “There’s no way that you’re his soul mated.”
That night the little crooked house burned, with its little crooked fence and overgrown garden. The bottles of herbs and dried flowers cracked and melted, the old clay pots crumbled. The broken broom stick crackled and turned to ash while the black cloak and crooked little hat shriveled.
Tony blinked then narrowed his eyes. “I will not.”
She was where she belonged.
He rushed to the stable and slipped the reins over his favourite bee, Buzzcut, before slipping out of the building and zooming down towards the great clearing. He'd trained the bee from larva and loved how fast it went, much to his mother's displeasure.
“Anything happens, it’s on you.”
The door slammed closed with a finality that had Anthony breathing once again.  He let the silence settle fully once again before moving, padding over to the bucket and tray and kneeling before them. The bucket was filled with hot water, steam rising from the clear liquid.
They ate the snacks and drank the sweet mulled wine that the Athosians made, soft fleece blankets and furs wrapped around their naked shoulders.
He glanced out unto the main common area, the skies beyond the floor to ceiling windows were dark grey and roiling, thunder booming in the distance. The weather had been shit for days, dark and oppressive over the city until both the mayor of New York City as well as the governor of the state had reached out to the tower to ask the resident god of thunder to give them all a fucking break pretty please and thank you.
All Draco wanted to do was fly. Ever since he'd seen his first flight as a very young child. Captivated the brightly coloured and patterned wings of the giant moths as they fluttered in the large clearing below the royal keep. Watching their smartly dressed riders mount and take to the air, kicking up huge buffets of wind as they took to the skies.
The house was few minutes run away, through the wooded park behind the library, all the way to the more affluent neighborhood of Fern Parkway. There was a trellis under the bedroom window, just as had been boasted in the halls at school. The window wasn't even locked so she slipped in and checked for any occupants.
“Oh.”
"First Potter, now you? Does nobody respect the Choosing Ceremony anymore?"
Thankfully Steve didn't address the tears again,  letting Tony work his way through his feelings with a tender kiss to his forehead. Tony's body shook with sobs, feeling as if something had been released inside him.
"You know what," Tony tilted his head coquettishly, "I think it's time for me to collect on some of my investment."
It started with an office fire in the warehouse district and way too soon had turned into several blocks of hell on earth. The FDNY were out in droves, trying to keep the blaze contained. The police were quickly evacuating the area and with the Avengers on their way with state of the art Stark Fire Suppression tech, Spiderman had been tasked with helping with the evacuation.
"Auntie, I'm heading to the library. I'll be back in a few hours."
He especially loved the look of it over the ocean from the view of his room. He'd moved his mattress over to the windows, collecting all of his blankets, pillows and cushions in to a giant nest. He'd placed one of the ancient space heaters he'd traded for off planet, and that Rodney had suped up for him, nearby, turning it on. It glowed a soft honey yellow that made the room glow when all the other lights were turned off.
SI would weather the storm alright, just a drop in stock prices but nothing that they hadn't ridden out and recovered from before. They had enough of his plans and tech in the archives that would carry them for the next ten years.
Stiles leaned his face into the touch, letting the other man gently explore the road map of pain the last five years had been. Derek’s touch was reverent as he felt along Stiles’ lips and the old ragged scar that cut through them.
With nothing left to lose, he'd walked into the forest with a jug of fresh milk and hand full of dried gladiolus, looking to either get entranced by the fae, lured to shadow by the goblin men or eaten by wolves.
Barely a second after Akamaru gave an excited yip, Kiba had his arms full of blonde ninja. Naruto tasted like ramen and smelt like dirt, sweat and the embers of a low fire. Under that was the heady scent of power that Kiba recognized as the Kyuubi and the old ink of the Fourth Hokage's seal.
They called it Messenger and pundits and pastors screamed that it was doom laid upon mankind by a vengeful god. The rich retreated to their tricked out bunkers if they had them and partied like it was 1999 if they didn’t. People punched their v-card in droves and gave the finger to their bosses/ exes/ families etc. Cults made suicide pacts and churches and temples had marathon prayer sessions.
Ronon smiled, looking over to where his lover snorted and turned over to his side, hugging the laptop so himself. He turned back to Teyla.
Ronon laughed loud and care fee before claiming his mate's mouth with a filthy kiss that left the genius flushed and panting.
He smiled to himself as he saw a flush crawl up Rodney's neck and around to his back. Ronon's cock twitched and he willed it still. There'd be time for that later… if Rodney really was interested.
He was stuck to one of the nearby buildings, watching for any signs of movement when his radio chirped. It was the police sergeant. The Avengers were on site and he wanted Spiderman to do a final sweep of the outlying buildings for any stragglers. He gave a cherry reply and set off on his way.
"We go north. To Durmstrag. Dumbledore dare not go against the ice fortresses of the north with their wild winter magic. He's already stretched himself thin with fighting the Summer Kingdoms. We can find shelter there for now."
"I really think that we should at least check this out, Boss." Tony reasoned as he followed his boss off the elevator, "There's something weird about it. Familiar."
Those blue eyes looked electric in the swirling colours, that pale skin glowing as if his mate was some kind of celestial body made flesh just for Ronon to hold, to mate, to love. They came together, holding each other close and trembling as bliss swept them away across the universe.
No. that sounded just a flaky as Scott and his last minute ditching of Stiles' well made plans. He had to go ahead with it. He owed it to himself.
He turned wide eyes to the startled looking bartender. The young woman got an uncertain look in her eye but nodded. “Yes sir. You said you wanted to the ‘good stuff’.”
Shephard nodded seriously. "I'll look into it when we get back."
It was a ten minute bus ride to the library and she greeted the Matron with a soft smile. She accepted compliments  on her dress and belated birthday wishes from the staff and turned over her books before heading to the private nook she always made a beeline for.
"Oh" Rodney's arms wrapped around his neck and pulled him close. "I keep forgetting that Seteda had such a long history before the wraith."
"This is just you playing hard ball. Come on, I know you Stark. You care too much about your people to let this get out. You may throw a tantrum now but we've got you in a corner and there's only one way out."
Anthony rages, his skin flushing at the callous words. He made a step forward, teeth bared and body trembling. The guard stepped with him, weapons drawn silently, ready to strike him down where he stood. The captain held up a hand, his blue eyes cutting into Anthony’s furious brown.
“He wasn’t the only oblivious one.”
Riddick sat back against his shackles and quirked an incredulous eyebrow.  “That’s true enough. Not much left to us but death and fury. What are you thinking to do about it? You wanna talk? Have some kind of deep conversation? Trade philosophies or some shit like that?”
Teyla and a few of her people stayed, mostly to stand witness of the storm and tell the tale of its passing to the rest of their people. The Meteorological team, or the Weathermen as they were called amongst the city dwellers, had predicted that the Athosian village would be all but washed off the mainland, the water table expected to rise way above the ground level. The Athosians had been both alarmed and sad at the news but they were Pegasus born so they rolled with it.
He plucked another beer from the cooler beside him and twisted it open, looking up at the vast beauty of the night sky. He’d discovered this spot on the preserve some months ago, during a flight for his life from one of the latest oogly booglies that had turned up seeking the power of the nemeton. Between researching like crazy, trying to wrangle both Scott and Derek, knocking his head against the stone wall that was Deaton, and trying to keep his dad safely ignorant; he’d barely had time to appreciate the stunning view of the preserve from the sharp cliff lookout.
“Nah, that’s just the rotten cherry on top the already shit Sunday.” Steve gave a mirthless laugh. “The worst part of this whole mess is that I’ve lost my one slim chance to bid for a night with Justin hammer.”
Jake finally looked nonplussed. "What? Seriously?"
Somehow, most of the other pilots would drift through or show up sometime within the week and Duo would spend time touching base and catching up with longtime friends. He would always head back up to space rejuvenated after those visits, happy in the knowledge that they were all getting along with their lives after the war.
*******************
"How about no thank you. I say we take pictures from here, then turn around and go back to the comfy little bed and breakfast in town. I, for one, don't need old man Hugh Crain and his gaggle of  ghostly kids dragging my soul to hell before my final year."
Anthony cast his gaze there, seeing the gleaming gold turn orange as light filtered through the towers of glass. He could sense the Iron Legion there, hovering just within the direct sunlight and reflecting it down to the grateful citizens. Doing their duty to their people and to their King.
"At ease, Private." a deep and familiar voice echoed from behind her and her breath caught in her throat."
He made a visit to the museum, in lieu of making a call; eager to see the Doctor in person once more. Lamar grinned at seeing him, making Tony stomach flip flop in a good way. Although they were both disappointed that their evidence hadn't panned out for Tony's case, the presence of the shells had led to an internal investigation by the Museum itself.
When it came down to it. I was a king’s duty to stand between his kingdom and any threat brought against it. He, and no one else, would be the one to finish the fight that the shadow horde started.
Resting his aching skull on the small pillow, he realized that this bed was also infinitely more comfortable than the cot he’d slept on the night before. The room was lit blue, silhouetting the broad shoulders and back of the captain as he worked on something at a large work table. Anthony sat up gingerly, tucking his socked feet into his loaned boots. He stared at the other man for a long moment.
Now, he was chieftain. He was leader. He had to be strong for his people. He had to be his mother's son. He tilted his chin up and squared his shoulders, turning his eyes out towards the deep dark ocean.
Ring | Horns
It had taken him a while, and some concealing, to move away from that soul eating rage and get on with living his life. He volunteered at various charities around the old neighborhood, spent time overseeing STEM workshops at the local schools. He made his life something he was proud of living.
The coffee machine beeped and broke his concentration, pulling his eyes away from the slim figure silhouetted against the endless cloudy skies. He filled his cup then, after some quiet deliberation, took another from the shelf and filled that as well. He wasn’t sure if to add milk or sugar so he left it as black as his own.
Behind him, Coulson stiffened, hands clenching briefly before relaxing as if by force. Tony sat back in his office chair, his face blank and emotionless.
The Iron King would do his duty to the Sunlight Kingdom.
"He wants to get space married. Said he's been here too long not too. We're planning to go to Morgavian to share a plate of Balarean Fruit Jelly. You should be there. You and John. To stand with us."
It was the Iron King’s job to make sure that something like this didn’t happen in the first place. And… he had failed. Cold rage burned through his veins and he felt his armored fists clench. Anthony took a deep breath, forcing the emotion down deep. The Iron King was not ruled by his emotions. The Iron King did not feel.
“You would welcome death if it meant killing us too?” The blond stumbled back, aghast. “You’ve signed your death warrant along with ours.”
no powers - AU, talk of suicide or at least letting ones self die. Veteran Steve and Bucky.
The man was ruthless, smart and somehow able to inspire unwavering loyalty in his people. He was by no means the biggest crime boss in Chicago but he held unto his mid-level portion of shy-town with an iron fist.
Thankfully, Tony didn’t wake up and after a few seconds of deliberation, Steve made a decision. Carefully, he threaded his arms under the sleeping man and lifted him gently, freezing as the smaller man snuffled into his neck and gave a soft contented sigh.
Eugené snickered, her over-sized turquoise sweater marvelous against her mocca skin. "You watch too many horror movies, dude. "
Steve swiped at his eyes with the tie, sniffing as he tried not to break down completely. “There was a bomb. He saved me. Dragged my ass out of there when I wouldn’t leave my men. the army booted us back stateside with a pat on the back and a box full of medals. It took us a while to pull each other back from that hellish nightmare. A long fucking time to get our shit together.”
But he had the rest of his life to find out.
“What about both? Can I have both? The poet and the demon.”
There was an Athosian blanket laid out on the floor, a hand woven basket of food and a few bottles of the sweet juice made from some weird earth fruit called pineapple. It was one of Ronon's favorites and he always tried to keep a few bottles in the chiller in his room.
The rebellion would be shattered and he would have achieved his mission. Even in death. The Iron King's life was to serve the Citadel and he would gladly give it in the name of duty.
“Looks like It’s your lucky day Richard B Riddick. Class F Bounty. Wanted Dead or Alive. Thirty million credits. Ten million credit bonus if brought in dead.” The husky voice whistled then chuckled. “A very lucky day.”
Rodney huffed a laugh. "Oh wow, perfect. You give me the address and I'll talk Elisabeth and John into going on a mission there. Easy peasy."
The captain’s voice came from the doorway and Anthony froze for a long moment before setting the little machination down gently. It wiggled a bit on its back before he gently turned it over. It scuttled along the table, diving off the edge and making him lunge to catch it before it broke itself apart on the stone floor.
They manage to make small talk as they finished their coffees, catching up on years gone by. It’s only when they are settled down on the comfortable couch, the fireplace crackling happily; that Derek broached the subject they’d both been dancing around.
"I missed you Dizz."
Ronon had been smug for months after, every time Rodney brought up the list in meetings; advocating reasons to visit one planet over the other. It made him feel that visceral sort of pride to know that he'd provided something for his mate that he took great pleasure and pride in.
The captain’s smile was bright and happy as he repeated the name like it was a precious thing. His blue eyes were warm and full of awe.
And just like that Steve’s balloon wilted. Tony must have seen the devastated look on his face because he reached forward and grabbed his arms.
Lord knows he’d worked up an appetite.
His personal finances would take a big hit and he already had JARVIS liquefying a few of his superfluous assets. It's not like he hadn't taken losses before. He was more than just his bank account.
With the Kingpin's car totaled by Flash's convertible and his personal drug dealer stabbed and robbed, there would be nowhere that Flash could hide. Not even his daddy's lawyers could protect him from him getting what he deserved.
"Deaton needs access to the Nemeton…."
He gestured to himself and his two fox kin. "I got jacked and made into a meat puppet by an ancient evil fox spirit and almost sent the world to hell in a hand basket. After that we all agreed that the Nemeton and you Canis Lycaons are no touchy for the good of everyone involved."
Spike chuckled, plucking the unlit cigarette out of his mouth and tucked it back into the pocket of his leather duster. He carefully stepped up behind the brunette and pressed up against his back, pale hands caressing up his bare hips to rest at his waist.
He wanted to…. Sol, he wanted to feel the man against him. He wanted to taste him and touch him everywhere. He wanted to feel his weight against him, their bodies slick with sweat and heated together against the cold. He shook off the very thought of it. It was too painful to contemplate.
Steve gave off heat like a furness and he rubbed his cheek against that broad chest, inhaling deeply in that comforting smell of soap and shield oil and musk. His hand lay on Steve’s peck and his fingers started to twist the rings again, turning them over as the arc blue diamond disappeared and reappeared against the silver of the vibranium bands.
This is the prompt image.
Steve flushed at the barely disguised disgust in the man’s voice, shaking his head roughly. He felt an overwhelming need to explain himself to this stranger. To not let him walk away with the wrong idea.
She tucked into a left roll, coming to her feet at a run only to feel a sharp and agonizing pain in her right arm, leg and side. She'd screamed, tumbling to the tarmac as the pain cut away abruptly, leaving her breathless and numb; bug screams and gunfire above her.
He looked out unto the city once more, the view of which still took his breath away. Beyond the city and far away, a thin dark line crept along the horizon, stretching from east to west. Tony’s sharp eyes followed the line and felt a twinge in his soul mark.
Spencer's eyes flickered to the robust young man keeling in attendance at the side of the desk, his eyes averted demurely. He was dressed in soft white pants, his chocolate skin glistening along his bare shoulders and chest. His head was shorn close to his skull and he wore a diamond studded sub collar around his neck. it was a gorgeous piece of art, with a small platinum lock hanging from it, nestled in the dip of his collar bone.
This brought him up close and personal with the sleeping genius, the sight of his sleep softened face, thick eyelashes dark against his dusky skin sending Steve’s heart into overdrive, along with other places in his anatomy.
a day late. i was swamped at work yesterday and exhausted when i cam home so i wrote this early this morning. will still try to get in another by the end of today.
He cares for his little crooked broom, the staff he cut himself from a strong sapling; the bristles harvested by moon light and re-twisted every day. He rubbed it with flax oil and tightened the weave of the bindings every fortnight.
That that was the last time he was trusting locals about complicated meteorological patterns and events. He would have to tweak the science drones to record weather patterns as well. The city had already opened the Met labs and such strides were already being made in weather prediction. He kicked himself for not including more of that tech into the modified drones used as UAVs. Stupid Rodney.
He had a tray of snacks at the ready and reached over to grab his laptop, setting up one of those crackling fireplace background noise tracks wired to the speakers in his room. Rodney had set it up for him, allowing him to immerse himself in some of the beautiful and haunting earth music that reminded him of home.
Now, with his Wonder Woman socks and thick pile carpeting, he could indulge in a bit of nonsensical behavior. Thankfully, his rings quickly dissipated the negative charge harmlessly before they could build up and give him a static shock.
"You would." Hotchner's lip twitched at the corner, the closest thing to emotion Spencer had seen on him. He forced himself to stay still and be calm as those dark eyes turned their full force to him.
The Iron Kings of old had paved the brutal way for peace, protecting the Sunlight Kingdom from enemies lurking in the deep shadows of the Umbra, razing their ranks with the unrelenting and merciless gaze of Sol.
So he did.
He huffed a disgusted little laugh. "You think you can come in here and make me jump through whatever hoops you hold up on any given day. That you can dangle your 'greater good' in front of little Anthony Stark and I'll do all of the heavy listing."
They observed the crew for a while before creeping closer. His intent was to hijack the vehicle, take the crew hostage and make them take him to rebel command. He’d be lost for too long in this wilderness if he tried to find their base on foot and the dark terrain had proven extremely dangerous to traverse.
Riddick could feel his cock getting hard, that slow heat curling in his belly.
SRY LMP. FYRE BAD
The room was tastefully appointed, hard woods, burnished gold and supple leather. It was a man's room, made for men's delights. A large desk dominated on side of the room. It was a large monstrosity of a thing, with carved lions snarling, claws extended. Books lined the shelves behind it, floor to ceiling filled with expensive looking leather bound tomes.
He'd putting together his costume over the past few months, making purchases online and in several thrifts shops. He's met up with the girls from the jungle and they'd taken him around to several lesser known stores which catered to the things he needed.
"I don't know, maybe it is from a movie, maybe it's not. All I know is that my gut is telling me that this could be important to the case."
He'd ranted and raved at Tony both at the crime scene and in the bull pen, blaming him for the FBI moving in on their jurisdiction. Seeley had been livid on Tony's behalf, both at Gibbs and at everyone who'd stood around doing jack shit.
He turned to Rossi. "Arrange to have his studio set up in the north wing. Bring whatever he needs from his studio. Any fitting sessions will be approved by me. If I'm not available, Garcia can be my stand in."
He finished his makeup and dressed, saving the wig for last. There as a basket on the bed, complete with back up Toto, a little spiky stuffed dog  with soulful black glass eyes.
He yelled for counter measures, scanning for the source of the weapons fire. Legionnaires veered left and right, gliding through the air like some kind of deadly aerial ballet; ripped apart by the barrage of blue lights and tossed to the harsh ground below like broken dolls.
He fucked lazily into the blond a few more times, enjoying the tremors of pleasure as his half hard cock pressed against all the slick quivering places deep inside the blond. he rolled to the side as he slipped out, pulling a boneless Naru with him as Shika laid himself along the blond's back, tucking him between them both.
He'd faced starvation amongst the so called good people of the village, his father's house and business taken over by ever so helpful distant family relatives.
“When could you have done that? When you were in the ICU fighting for your life? When you were trying to organize your dad’s funeral from your hospital bed? When you were in physiotherapy trying to get back movement in half your body? When you were in and out of the hospital for skin graft surgery?”
Ewan huffed, "Jake watches too many horror movies. I'm forced to as well cause I'm his roommate and our apartment is the size of a fucking postage stamp."
The day he'd swaggered back into school, baldly talking about "Penis Parker" getting what he'd deserved, the plan had been birthed in her mind. After that it was simple cause and effect. Turn the tables and let the universe take care of the rest.
There were three up front, two men and a woman. Some kind of honour guard to the rebel leader. The taller man was a brunet, built big and broad just like the captain was. The smaller man was a dirty blonde, stocky and compact. He had some sort of strung weapon slung across his back and an actual quiver of arrows.
Like the way he knew in his heart that if he opened his mouth to speak, he would start screaming and wouldn’t stop. There were no smart ass quips, no snippy sarcastic come backs. No one to circumvent the mindless terror that still reverberated through his very soul.
And just as all of the previous Iron Kings before him, he would win.
Kiba groaned at the tastes of ki rich blood across his tongue, growing hard in his pants as he sucked on the blond's kiss swollen bottom lip. A splash of freezing cold water had them shrieking and jumping apart to see Hana with her hands still in a water seal.
Then he'd head back to space and start the cycle all over again.
Ronon's soft smile was somehow incandescent and Rodney's heart twisted with the amount of emotion that the sight of it welled up in him.
When he came to live on Atlantis and had come to learn of Rodney's voracious lust for knowledge, Ronon had decided to compile a list of address with little notes and annotations on what he knew of the planets that lay beyond.
Fury sat forward. "You of all people know how important it is to swallow your pride and do what's right. Especially in times like these. We need you on this."
On Seteda, the warriors often shared their bodies with each other. It brought them closer and satisfied their sexual appetites. It was different on Atlantis, earth people were such prudes.  He'd approached John one time but the man, though thoroughly flattered, flummoxed and embarrassed at the offer, had politely declined and explained about the myriad of earth ways which made it a bad idea.
“I should have been there. Maybe I could have helped.”
Soon enough, they came across some activity and quickly sought cover so that they could observe unseen. A small group of scavengers were digging in some kind of pit. Above the pit, some kind of ground vehicle was parked. A rigged array of the same blue light from the weaponry shone down upon the diggers.
She wanted to be a soldier. She wanted to be a citizen. She wanted to take it to the bugs who'd taken her home, her family and even parts of her body from her. she wanted her life to mean something after she'd fought so hard for it.
Potter and he were the last of their class to find a bond and there had been talk within the halls of the keep and in the town. Now that Potter had gone and found himself a Dragon, Draco was now the only one from his class left. Most of the other hopefuls were at least two years younger than him and it made him stand out.
Along the way, the legionnaire tried to interface with the truck’s tech but all attempts failed. It seemed that the robot was just too advanced or too different for the truck because it had more success with the newer looking comm unit.
She'd sent him a carefully cropped picture of random internet boobs and extracted a promise of discretions which he was all too willing to agree too and wiped the texts right after  with a neat little trick her brother had taught her. The phone was back in Cindy's purse before the girl even knew it was gone. It was almost as easy as breaking into his gym locker and cloning his cell phone while he was in basketball practice.
He was fine though, having lived with her in their little crooked cottage with its wild garden and crooked fence since he was ten. It hadn't always been his dream to be the Witch of the Woods but life was what happened when you were making other plans.
Sencer kept quiet, accustomed to Doms talking about him as if he wasn't there. There was no use defending or explaining his lack of collar. That was no one's business but his own.
He checked his restraints, hoping to find a weak point; something he could wiggle out of; but no dice. Cassiran flex steel fibres threaded with strom ore, secured to each other and to the walls. Shit. These hunters were serious. His goggles were gone but he could just make out the stark lines of a ship’s brig capsule. Huh. It had been a long fucking time since someone had gotten the jump on him.
He hung his weapons just out of reach, his guns and a few knives joining them. He was by no means unarmed but there was nothing on him that Riddick could reach easily without dislocating something. Riddick stilled as the man slowly straddled his lap, shifting his weight as he ran his hands over Riddick’s shoulder and chest.
He twisted in the full length mirror, running an appraising hand over his ass cheeks, a fine tremor running through him at the feeling. He bit his lip, adjusting the tuck of his chubb in the lacy front. Fuck it felt so good.
yeah, so i really wanted to finish up this story and got inspired today. this was supposed to be a one shot 2000 words or less. LMAO. that didn't happen. i tried not to make the ending to abrupt and i hope that i accomplished that. hope you enjoyed. My muse was already playing keep away when it came to this story so i wanted to finish while i still had the inspiration.
Steve rocked him slow, refusing to heed any demands to move faster, go harder. The blond kept Tony on the knife's edge, soothing the restless and impatient genius with his hands, his lips, the sweet whispers against Tony's neck or the shell of his ear that always made him melt.
"I heard you practically had to drag your team through the gate. Troublesome."
“Well, you do look like a pretty princess to me.”
He let her help him gather herbs and taught her the secret paths through the thickest and darkest of the woods. She was a friend and he cherished their warmth and closeness.
She reached into her closet, feeling along the top of the inside door frame for a zip lock bag she'd taped there. Inside were a half dozen zip ties, a bottle of hand sanitizer, a pair of latex gloves, an ice pick and a shiv she'd learned how to make off the internet from a tooth brush, saran wrap and a lighter. She also had said lighter.
Damn Scott for chickening out and leaving stiles in the lurch. Going as Dorothy and Toto would have been priceless, with Scott being a werewolf at all.
"I didn't mean… huh. Never mind."
He fell into a fitful sleep and dreamed of falling.
She gave him one last searching look, shoulders lowering when she found no quarter nor mercy within the whiskey coloured eyes. She stepped back, never turning away from him, until she too was gone; her steps making almost no noise along the forest bed.
But none of that mattered as he leaned in and captured sweet, soft lips with his. As he slid his hands around a trim waist. As warm hands slip up his shoulders and into his hair. As they both moaned at the fire that kindled in their bellies.
"Penelope tells me that you are extremely skilled in your craft."
Loving Lamar was easy. Almost frightfully so. They seemed so different on paper but face to face they just seemed to gel in all the right ways. Tony still had his insecurities, he still struggled with his self-worth but talking to his lover, sharing his doubts and fears with another instead of keeping it all bottled up; helped him deal with a few of his deeper issues.
Ronon didn't even look back, just shrugging his large shoulders, his hand on his sweet pulse gun. Rodney grumbled some more and John was glad that he was bringing up the rear so that Rodney wouldn't see him grinning.
“It’s has been a while.” He admitted. “Though I can’t see how these chains would qualify as easy.”
Anthony’s hands itched to join in, now that the secret of his identity was revealed and he was all but destined to die one way or the other, the bands around his chest had loosened somewhat. He took a deep breath, both to steady himself and to take in the Captain’s scent. He smelled like raw metal, solder and sweat, despite the cold. His pale skin was smooth and looked soft to the touch or too the kiss.
He gave one last look at the blazing shoreline behind him and closed his eyes at the deep sorrow that burrowed into his heart. He swallowed it down, there would be time for wailing and weeping later.
Tony's smile widened like a sharks, making both men flinch back. "Not as much as you will Nicky. Not as much as you will."
Derek barked a harsh laugh, his eyes narrowing as he threw a flat glare in Stiles' general direction.
But that was talk for the future. In this moment he had a different goal. Working Rodney's body and pulling pleasure from him until he was boneless, blissed out and at peace within his ever turning brain. As his lover shuddered through what would be the first of many orgasms that night, Ronon could swear he could hear Rodney's comm bleating weakly.
The beautiful stranger kept silent and Steve couldn’t help but give a deep sigh. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe there’s still a chance I can come back from this. I could still win a date with Justin Hammer at the auction tonight. I have to stick it out to the end. i owe Bucky that much at least.”
His soul sang, his heart rejoiced, his mind went blissfully silent.  He grasped desperately at those broad shoulders, digging dull fingernails into the blond’s back as he tried to crawl inside him. Muscular arms held him close, lifting him easily and depositing him unto the bed. They broke the kiss, staring at each other as they panted for breath.
"It's good to have you back." she said softly, fussing with his blanket. "Rodney's fine. He's sleeping on the next bed over. He's not injured, just a few scrapes and bruises. Do you remember what happened?"
"Damn right." Tony chuckled, rubbing his cheek against the ritualistic scars along his lover's back. "Especially when since I get my returns in both financial and flesh equity around here."
He swallowed heavily against his nerves and turned around to lean against the tempered glass. There, that was a bit better. The common room looked bleached grey but there were little pops of colour, little signs of life that made the bands around his chest loosen. He took a sip of coffee and let his eyes drift over to the slumped figure in the chair, cup of coffee still untouched and steaming.
Alas, the life of an Iron King was one of service. He’d been chosen as a child to take up the mantle and he would carry that weight on his shoulders until he died. There was no other life fated for him. He lived entirely for the Citadel and for the safe keeping of its beloved peoples.
In fact most of the demonic underworld found the shambling corpses a right tasty snack. “Aged like fine wine”, one skorlack demon had joked one night, its jagged teeth glistening with blood and ichor under the harsh streetlight; “always on tap and with free delivery too.”
"Oh God, Don't be such a dramatic bitch," Candy sighed heavily. "I need this to complete my thesis. No one put a gun to your head to make you come with us you know. Frankly, I didn't even want to invite you but Jake said that you would just spend the break holed up in your room, like the sad sack you are."
Stiles' skin was luminous in the moonlight. The moles that dotted his face and neck continued down his shoulders and back like stars. Derek liked to gently trace patterns between them with his fingertips, like the constellations. He would follow along with his tongue afterwards, making his lover squirm and writhe on the bed.
Happy Halloween Everybody! it's done. i can't believe it. so proud of myself. I hope you had as much fun as i did. i may end up putting the Rodney/Ronon stuff in a separate story, maybe. if i'm feeling inspiration. i have so many other WIPs to concentrate on. and Rough Trade November starts tomorrow. whew. no rest for the wicked.
It was good money, if a little dirty; but it was stepping stone to being legit and was probably as honest as he was going to get. He wasn't the shining family Scion like his cousin was, with his high education and fancy house in the hills.
"You're smart aren't you?" he'd panted, his ass squeezing mercilessly on Ronon's cock as he rolled his hips deeply. "You can read ancient and you understand more in the labs than you let on, don't you?"
Xander could only nod eagerly, snatching up the matching nightgown as they went. Oh yeah, scratch another one off the bucket list.
The lithe figure was almost swimming in the huge hooded sweatshirt, small glimpses of jewel blue skin covered in darker blue runes. Midnight black, almost blue hair hung limply from the pulled up hood and covered the sharp angled cheekbones and shin, also a rich gemstone blue.
He said nothing else as he’d always been a man of few words. Anthony appreciated his forthrightness, fed up of court simpering and political machinations. Rhodes was honest, honourable and most importantly, loyal to the Iron King. He was also the closest thing to a friend that Anthony had ever known.
The sheriff told Ewan that he should be thankful. That it was a freak accident. That he was the lucky one.
JARVIS let him into the workshop without a word and he glanced around the area before his eyes snagged on a sliver of familiar blue. He tilted his head, stepping closer, curious.
"Here, take this."
She'd spent hours on the weird side of you tube, hours more in the library, pouring through anatomy books learning how to do what she was going to do next. There were parts of the human body that one could puncture with a bladed weapon so that no damage would be done to the internal organs. One would bleed profusely, of course, and initially show as being severely injured but a full recovery with prompt medical help was assured.
Stiles had thought quickly, yelling quick instructions over the battlefield and had gone to help his brother from another mother.
She was home now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Character Death: Stiles' Dad.
A skinny, bald man in pants hung low snarled at her, his numerous prison tattoos stark against his pale skin. He voice was rough like gravel but she couldn't hear a word he was saying because her blood was rushing in her ears so loud.
“You seem perturbed, Monarch.” Rhodes observed, coming to stand at his side on the balcony.
Dark lashes flutter and eyes red as the rarest rubies flickered up to look at him though long, thick hair. They flashed red for half a second before they dulled and fell away. He let out his breath slowly through his lips, his shoulders losing some of their tension.
Steve rolled his hips, sending shockwaves of pleasure through Tony's frame, making his eyes roll wildly in his head as he gasped and mewled.
When she was done and ready for deployment, she'd been given a choice of station. There's been no hesitation then either.
“Well, don’t you look like a right nummy treat?”
"Yes, Elizabeth has said as much. " Teyla gave him a thoughtful nod and squeezed his hand once more. "I look forward to the day you are sealed as one with your fated other half ."
And on his collar bone, half covered by the wool of his shirt; sat a soul mark that looked identical to the one now burning high on Tony’s inner thigh.
The man in question frowned, glancing at his boss before staring disapprovingly as Tony once more. Nick sat back with a smug disbelief, arm slung over the back of his chair.
"Sadly, my red haired goddess isn't interested in any one between her legs who isn't Jackson Fucking Whitmore so I never had a chance. I just gave her a small piece of information I had been keeping secret that would give her heavy leverage over Baron Peter Hale."
The man was gorgeous. With the eyes as blue as cloudless skies, lips as full and red as sweet, ripe apples and hair as gold at the citadel’s highest peak. In the light of Sol he would be glorious to behold.
got a bit of my grove back with this one. trying to decide on a fandom was keeping me back so i went with Original Characters. Still, my main OC was heavily inspired by a young Ewan McGregor. Yumm.
“Stiles…” Derek’s eyebrows furrowed. “Stiles!”
Talia took a deep breath, as if silently praying for patience. Stiles liked to see that expression on her usually smarmy face.
“I usually spring for dinner first, gorgeous” Tony’s cheeks went pink as he curled him lips into a soft smile, shrugging his shoulders. “… but hey, I’m not stopping you.”
"I need something custom made for Derek.." Aaron glanced at the sub kneeling comfortably. "There will be a meeting of the Famiglias Maiò very soon and we have been invited to present. I want my submissive dressed to impress the other major familes."
Wufei wasn't one for interior design, function over all else was what mattered. He had a kitchen for cooking, a bed for sleeping and a not so hideous formica dining table to spread out his laptop and load of course work.  He'd unpacked his luggage the first day, having little more than a few boxes of personal items. The rest of the week was dedicated to getting all of his paper work completed pre-registration and unpacking the crates of books he couldn't leave behind.
Steve frowned in confusion. “Wait, I thought you were older… and bald”
Stiles chuckled, sitting on the bed and watching as the normally broody, angry man adjusted fake wolf ears on his head. There was something meta about it.
Teyla, who had been looking at John's motions carefully, also tore open her packet and squeezed out the lotion. Rodney glanced over.
Candy turned quickly in her seat, her limp pony tail flipping across her thin shoulders in her thick, vomit green sweater.  "Well, premise or not, I need to go in there and takes some pictures for my research on the blending of Jacobean, Elizabethan and Baroque influences in turn of the century Architecture and it took me a long fucking time to track down the owner and get permission to come and take photos."
The Alpha werewolf smirked, leaning over and picking up the wolf ears.
“Get your ass up here sour wolf,” he ordered with a smirk, “Geez, the entire planet getting a Hail Mary pass isn’t enough to make you crack a smile?”
"No dog jokes."
Rodney had slipped to the back of the ship, tinkering with something until he called Ronon's attention away from the window. He was standing in the empty stern of the ship, nervously fidgeting.
He loved how Rodney gave everything, holding nothing back as he arched up into the thrusts, panting open mouthed and making little noises that should really be illegal in several galaxies.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
He teased his lover's nipples, sucking and biting gently on the pebbled nubs as his hand gripped the base of the blond's leaking cock. His kissed the other man hard, working his fist on the throbbing member as Shika curled his long fingers just so. Naruto came with a wail, his body all but leaving the ground as he came over Kiba's hand and his own stomach.
Stiles had already set everything up and they got down to the solemn business of building the fire that would guide his father's passage.
Tony had taken him out for drinks after wards, letting the man rant into his beer at the utter lack of professional respect the whole of NCIS had shown. He'd all but growled at Tony that he'd be welcome at the FBI in a hot minute the moment he decided to leave that toxic, orange nightmare. Tony had been flattered at the offer and promised the other agent to seriously give it some thought.
“Oh I don’t know.” Came the velvet warm voice from his side once again, startling him as he'd forgotten the man was still there. “As someone who fucks things up a lot, I can tell you that there’s always a way of coming back. All can’t really be lost can it?”
“No.” Derek rolled his eyes. The move looked weird. “My hearing and smell just got sharpened. My sense of touch went a bit wonky for a while. I can feel when things are near me. It took some getting used to, for sure.”
His next words were cut off as Steve moved, stealing his breath and making him throw his head back with a cry. God, Steve was so fucking deep.
Shikamaru huffed and tugged gently on Kiba's wild hair. "I also happen to have a couple of days off. Tsunade kicked me out of the tower and told me not to come back until next week. How utterly strange and coincidental."
The crooked jawed wolf had abandoned the plan they'd meticulously gone over several times before leaving the loft, concentrating too much on Allison and not enough on his own part.
“Lucky that the trap that you sprung wasn’t meant for you. Lucky that we’re hot enough on our mark’s trail that we don’t have time or resources to bring you along for the ride. Really lucky that we don’t have anywhere to secure your corpse to collect the bonus on it later.”
The Iron King was the hand of Sol.
“Hey, Lightsider. Time to go.”
His new found knowledge in entomology came in handy when the body of a marine turned up infested with unknown larvae. Tony had quickly snapped a picture and sent it to Lamar who'd alerted Brenan and her team as it was another rare species not native to the US. when Seeley had swooped in to pull the case into their larger black market investigation, Gibbs had been livid.
Another super short one. i'm struggling with these but am pushing through.
Steve liked clothes well enough. He knew what fashion was and what power it could hold and wield. The cut of a man’s trousers, the fit of his jacket across the shoulders. How those subtle little things influenced those around him, their perception of his status, his intelligence, his power.
"I guess." Scott calmed down and shrugged sheepishly. "That still doesn't mean that you have to do this."
Rhodes’ face cracked minutely but then he nodded. “Your will be done.”
The was the protector of the Sunlight Kingdom.
They both had reasons for being alone. Both had people that they would have loved spend time with tonight. Eventually, a light appears to the west, looking something like the sun rising in reverse at the forest brightened around them. Stiles fumbled in the pocket of his hoodie and pulled out two of those paper eclipse glasses, absently handing one to his companion as he slipped his pair on.
His father had been a carpenter and his mother a seamstress, both taken too soon by influenza; leaving him alone and without prospects. No one had wanted the lanky, sallow faced boy with long stringy black hair which hung about his pointy chinned face.
He pulled uncomfortably at his tight and itchy collar, feeling himself sweating through the thin white undershirt already. Thank god the suit was black and wouldn’t show any sweat stains and he’d have to scrape the money together to get the suit professionally cleaned before returning it.
He’d already resigned himself to never being able to meet or have a life with the one who made his soul mark tingle. Even if the person had been some random citizen of the sunlight kingdom, even if they’d been a nobleman of even a Counselor. Even if his soul mate had been Rhodes himself, he would not have been able to give himself wholly unto them as the soul bond ordained.
Ronon had been a bit confused but John had been patient in his explanations of the sexual spectrum. That kind of made all of Rondey's 'Kirk' complaints baseless but john said it gave him a chuckle to hear Rodney bitch about it.
He quickly ruled out the core breach on the last Legionnaire, they would have all died instantly if that had happened. Maybe they had cracked the memory core. That wouldn’t give them much, just the location of his armor and proof of his identity. Anthony paled.  He hoped that this wasn’t the case.
Derek frowned and shook his head. “I can almost see that look on your face.” He jabbed a finger at where Stiles’ face was. “Yes. That look. That research boner look. You know the one. Stop it now.”
------------------------
They stopped off at the uninhabited planet with a natural  hot springs, another of Ronon's addresses; and they bathed and made love in the healing waters.
The brunet’s eyes drag unconsciously to the blond’s soul mark, peeking up over the open collar of his knit shirt. He flushed and looked away quickly but the damage was already done. The captain slapped a palm over the mark and stared at Anthony in shocked dismay.
Rodney stilled at those softly spoken words, heart racing as he stared up at his lover's serious brown eyes. Ronon seemed to be waiting for him to respond, a soft wariness in his gaze. Rodney swallowed, utterly moved and deeply touched by the admission.
“Those damn rebels.” Rhodes growled at his side, his own armored hand fisted as he smacked it down on the table in frustration.
The great and mighty Sol was truly a selfish and merciless bastard.
"I'm fine. Grumpy wolf. It's just a scratch."
He smiled at his mate as the scientist gestured, getting lost in the technical specs of the project. The only real option was to kiss him silent. Rodney moaned into the kiss, hips bucking as this lover's large hands slid down his broad back to grab his ass and squeeze. Ronon pushed the basket aside, quieting Rodney's half-hearted protests for food with kisses that left him breathless.
