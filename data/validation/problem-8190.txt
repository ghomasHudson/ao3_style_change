“I forgive you,” Tony muttered, but the blonde simply shook his head.
“I wouldn’t call it lame,” Tony hummed. “I think this sits more on the tragic-romantic side of things,” Tony laughed. “Well...maybe sappy romance. But I like the thought,” The inventor said, a smile on his face. “I know you’re living in a dingy apartment. And while there would be two Steves eventually, you are welcome to stay at the tower. Your uh...past self is currently touring America. I’m not sure when he will be getting back. So I’m sure we can-”
A song with a Latin flair came over the speakers and everyone in the room seemed to recognize the song, except Steve. He didn’t think much of it. Instead he took another sip of his drink and continued to watch everyone dance.
“Steve!” a voice suddenly called from down the hall. The super soldier snapped his head up to see both Sam and Clint coming towards him and the other. And in Clint’s arms he held the girl that the scientists had been messing with.
“I’m sorry Tony,” Steve said after a long time of just sitting. “That was out of line for me to say.”
And lastly. Would anyone be interested in hearing my spotify playlist for this fic? I have one, if it would help set a mood or anything...I just don't know if ya'll would be interested. Just let me know.
A part of Peter seemed to feel embarrassed that he liked the movie, because that was one movie that he and Pops loved to watch every year, and then suddenly Peter understood why Tony was watching it. Peter’s heart hurt even more.
“I’m sure you can Peter. But it’s going to be awfully boring, and you’re going to have to behave so that the adults can talk,” Pepper explained with a kind smile. And even though Pepper had good intentions, Tony couldn’t help but feel put off by that statement. He felt like that was something Howard would have told him. And by God, he wasn’t going to do anything that reminded him of Howard.
“Yeah, everyone is taken care of,” Clint replied.
“N-Nothing,” Peter lied as he wiped some tears away. “I-I’m just sick,” he said…which was true. “And I uh…I just missed you.” Peter admitted. They had seen each other three weeks ago, with some phone calls and texting in-between. But suddenly it seemed like it had been centuries. “I was also in the neighborhood,” Peter said, holding up his sack that contained the ham.  “I was on a quest to get ham,” Peter said, laughing slightly.
“Hey! Don’t tell the kid that,” Tony whined as he took the lancet he was holding and held it over Peter’s small ring finger before pressing down.
Pepper didn’t even know what to say. She had seen Tony in almost every mood and situation, but this was definitely a new one for her. She wasn’t sure how to react.
“Okay,” the soldier finally stammered. “I’ll stay.”
“Well you know what my body is saying?” Tony asked with a chuckle as he took the tie from around his neck and wrapped it around Steve’s, pulling him closer until the two men’s foreheads were touching.
“It’s okay,” The voice hummed before pausing for a moment. “Okay. Okay. Tell me five things you see babe. Just five,” the voice instructed and all Tony could do was squeeze his eyes closed. “Come on Tony, you can do this. Five things,” The voice said a bit stronger this time. After a long moment Tony was willing his eyes to open and looking at his surroundings.
“No.”
“Thanks Pepper,” the bearded man said with a tired smile before stepping to the side to let her pass.
Peter approached Tony quietly, and set a hand on the man’s shoulder, waiting for him to respond. Tony shifted slightly and let out a sigh, but he didn’t look up at Peter.
The teen now lifted his head and sat up, the comforter sliding off of his body and onto the bed. The boy knew that Steve probably wasn’t shouting too loud, but in his state, everything seemed too loud.
Now that she had the chance, she could see that Tony was staring at a picture of a couple. The screen was split and one picture was of both of them, while the other side was zoomed in on the womans face. Pepper eyed the picture as she closed in on the bed. Kicking off her heels, she sat on the edge of the bed next to Tony and laid a hand on the man’s arm.
Now that Peter wasn’t latched on to him, and Tony knew that everyone was safe, he felt absolutely drained. He wasn’t even sure if he could make it to a shower. Sure he smelt like piss...but he was willing to sacrifice his sheets for a nap.
“Wait. You can’t just call Stark now. If you do he’ll know our location and then-”
“Are you hungry?” Peter asked as he eyed Steve who was now sitting down at the table across from Peter.
Now that Peter was out of his arms, Tony moved quickly, not knowing how long Peter would be compliant. He first washed his hands and then slipped on blue medical gloves before opening up a cabinet.
“No,” Pepper hummed thoughtfully. “Not now. I’ll let Tony do that when he’s ready. Thanks for the offer though,” She said with a smile. “You should get some rest though, seriously,” She said, cocking a single eyebrow.
So I re titled my fic.  I have a better idea for where I want this to go and felt like this was a better title. Anyways, I honestly had no idea what to name this when I first started.
recognized that name. It’s not like he should even be recognizable. He had grown his beard out again, and his hair was quite a bit longer, pulled back at the nape of his neck. Lifting his eyes, though, he came face to face with Loki who was taking a seat next to him.
“Will do Mr. Stark,” Rita said, taking Peter and walking him back to a waiting bed. Tony watched silently as the woman and her team did their best to calm Peter down. It seemed like forever, but once Peter compliant, the inventor moved towards the exit.
“Is this a dress?” the little boy had asked with a giggle as he flapped his arms up and down.
“And then he just left me for dead. My suit didn’t work, I was bleeding everywhere and...God, it was cold,” Tony huffed, his body limp as he leaned into Steve. Honestly, the blonde was not expecting Tony to be this bad off. And he knew it was foolish of him to think he would fine.
“Well, I saw pictures,” Pepper replied quickly. “Did you...pick out his name?” Pepper suddenly asked. “Or did they give him that at the lab?” She suddenly asked.
“Two things you can smell?” Steve asked.
The inventor raised a single eyebrow because, wow. That was a definition straight out of the dictionary.
“Sorry,” came a small voice as the figure shifted their weight from one foot to the other. “I didn’t mean to scare you,” it called out. “But I can’t sleep.”
“I’m going, I’ll be back,” Peter called out as he pulled on a hoodie and stepped out of the apartment door.
They sat there in silence for most of the time, and every once in a while talked about the weather or what the other was working on in terms of science projects. Suddenly Peter found himself not even wanting to go home. What would Steve say? It wasn’t by law or anything, but it was an unspoken rule that Steve had Peter for Christmas.  In fact Peter had only been at Tony’s twice after the divorce for Christmas day. And one of the times, Peter had been very uncomfortable and miserable due to the crippling separation anxiety he had directly after the divorce. He was attached to Steve. It was something that he got over with time, but Peter was sure Tony was aware of it during that time. He felt terrible for acting so rotten. He was sure it made Tony feel horrible.
“Oh we have,” Lynette said with a small laugh. “He was here when we arrived. But don’t sell yourself short Mr. Stark,” the woman said as she gave Tony a smile. “Because without you our daughter wouldn’t be getting such exceptional care...and she’s safe. So Thank you Mr. Stark.” The mother said, doing her best not to cry like her husband was now doing.
“His mother gave it to him,” Tony muttered, still not taking his eyes off of Peter. “It was one of her last requests...or at least that’s what it said on their files.”
“I can’t Steve,” Tony said, his hand sitting on the door handle. “As much as I want to. And God do I want to. I can’t,” And suddenly, Tony’s voice was shaking. “I wish I could stay and make all your hurt go away, because it kills me to see you like this Steve. But I can’t. I have a wife and daughter back home. And I’ll never do anything to hurt them. Because they are my world, and I love them. They saved my life. I owe them everything. And if I stay here with you...I’m afraid I could lose all of that. And I can’t. I’m sorry,” Tony said, and suddenly the two were sitting in silence. The only sound was the sniffling that came from both men.
“Wait! Where are you going?” Tony suddenly asked. Steve stopped and turned to look at Tony.
“Oh Peter,” Tony said, trying to ignore the feeling of his heart climbing out of his chest. “I would never leave you.”
“Where are you going to go at this hour on Christmas Eve?” Steve asked.
“I mean, I’ve see them and people use them but....I’ve never used one.” Peter said as red began to creep up the little boy’s neck and onto his face. Tony figured as much, but the more he thought about Peter’s answer, the more upset he was getting. The little boy had to have been going somewhere, and as far as Tony knew, the children had not been kept with diapers on. And if so, the were not fresh. Honestly, Tony felt sick to his stomach, but he tried to not let it show.
“What’s wrong Tony?” Pepper suddenly asked, her voice easing in it’s sharpness.
The one thing that made his head spin, though, was when he read about the women who had died while carrying his children. Of course none of those children had survived. Steve couldn’t tell if he felt relieved, sad, or upset. But one thing he did know was that he felt responsible, even if it wasn’t his fault.
Tony wracked his brain for people who could take care of a child, but he was coming up empty handed. Peter was enhanced. He wasn’t sure how much, but maybe Xavier's school could take him in with the other children. It was an option. But Peter was smart, and very aware of his surroundings. Tony wasn’t sure if he could stomach hearing Peter cry as he was taken away to another location. But what if Peter came to hate Tony? What if he would be eager to leave?
“N-No. It-it’s okay P-Peter.” Tony continued. “You’re okay. This i-is all on me,” Tony said as he squeezed his eyes shut, taking in a steady breath. It took it a moment but he was finally able to compose himself and then continued with his task.
“You got good form Steve, but your younger self was getting the best of you there. You slowing up in your old age?” Tony asked with a giggle.
“A stop light,” he muttered, closing his eyes as he leaned into the larger man. “And steps...that go into a building,” Tony gasped.
“Right okay,” Tony hummed as he eyed Peter’s diaper. Honestly this was giving him a lot of anxiety. He had never done anything like this. Part of him wanted to ask Pepper for help, but another part of him didn’t want any help because god dammit, he was the kid’s father. He would need to know how to do this sooner or later.  “Okay. You got this,” Tony said as his hands hovered over the tabs of the diaper. “You’re Tony Stark for god sakes. You can do anything. So that means you can change a diaper,” Tony muttered to himself before taking one more deep breath and going for it. In one fluid movement he was awkwardly picking Peter’s ankles up, and the next he was undoing the diaper.
Now it was only Steve and Peter.
“Huh?”
“Loki,” Steve breathlessly huffed out.
“Ah, there he is!” Tony said with a smirk on his face as he leaned back into the bench. “I was afraid you might not be Steve Rogers. But those puppy dog eyes are unmistakable,” Tony said, smile still on his face.
on the front in black letters, and when Tony put it on Peter it seemed to eat him.
It was like a switch had been flipped because suddenly Tony was shooting up into a standing position, pulling at his tie as he desperately tried to take in more air. His eyes were wide and desperate and he was making loud gasping noises.
“Congratulations Boss! You can now add diaper changing to your resumé.” Friday proclaimed.
“I’m still scared,” Peter muttered sleepily, “But you’re back...so it’s okay.” Tony was so taken back by Peter’s statement that he honestly didn’t know what to say, and that gave time for the little boy to ask another question. “Why did you come back?” He suddenly asked.
“That’s okay,” Tony said after taking a deep breath. “I’ll teach you. It’s pretty easy! Now lay down so I can change you,” Tony instructed as he pulled out the changing mat, and a fresh diaper. He was sure he needed more, but he wasn’t really sure what. He had only changed a wet diaper, and other than that he had no experience with this. He was kind of winging it.
“I was an idiot back then, and what I did to you was wrong and I-”
Peter had never been inside a Target before, and he thought he might have to hunt down the food department, but all of his worries fell away as he entered the sliding doors. The food department was a lot bigger than he imagined and as he walked down the isle of never-ending frozen foods, he wondered if there even was a meat department. It seemed to be like a light and the end of the tunnel, though, as a small shelf space full of brightly wrapped items could be seen. Ham.
Since the day Steve had woken up from the ice, he had been fighting a battle. Sure, he had been out of commission for seventy years, but to him it seemed like he had constantly been on the go. And since the battle of New York, he had kept very busy. In the last eight years he was working for SHIELD, the Avengers, or doing his own thing. So the act of laying low didn’t sit right with him. And all of this started ever since he had rescued his team from the Raft and branded a war-criminal. Steve had to do something.
“Yeah, but was our friendship really
“Steve Rogers. Always the gentleman,” Pepper hummed, a small smile on her face. “Well, I’ll let you go then. But get some sleep when you’re done. That’s an order soldier,”  Peter said.
“You’re not going to stay with me?” Peter asked in a hurt voice.
“Tony,” Steve said carefully as he set his book down. “I-I’m not who you think I am,” Steve said, his eyes wary.
“How long were you standing there anyways?” Tony asked, letting out a large yawn as he stared back at the little boy.
“What are you looking at Rock-of-Ages?” A voice suddenly said a little too close to Steve for him to be comfortable. Tony was directly behind the brothers, and he was suddenly looking straight at Steve. Their eyes locked for a moment and then Tony was smiling. “Sorry this creep is staring. He doesn’t have any manners,” Tony said, and suddenly he was gone, falling back in place behind the group.
“Hello?” he heard a female voice call from behind one of the doors he was walking by. “Hello? Is someone there?” He heard again. Her voice was shaking and Steve’s blood ran cold when he heard just how young the girl sounded. “Help me please! Someone’s in here!” She said as her voice rose into a panic and she began to bang on the door.
On his days off, Steve would frequent Central Park. It was a nice place to people watch and sketch. It had been such a long time since he’d done anything with art. Steve had only been here for about a month, but it had been the best month he’d had in a long time. He couldn’t get drunk anymore, no matter how hard he tried. Sure he didn’t like it, but it’s better for him—in this month, he was healing.
“Good,” the brunette said with a smile. “No fighting.”
“Have you cleared everything?” Steve asked as he turned more towards the men.
With some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches divided up between the three, they all sat in front of the TV, watching talking dogs work together as Pepper cut Peter’s hair. Even after Pepper was done, the three ended up watching an additional four episodes of the dogs. They were just too witty and cute, but of course Tony would never admit that out loud.
“Friday, please tell me how to change a diaper,” Tony said hesitantly as Peter obeyed, laying down on the mat. With that Tony pulled up the T-shirt Peter was wearing so that his bottom was free from obstruction. Now he could see that Peter was pretty full. “A very poopy diaper,” Tony specified as he eyed the bulging material.
Peter was still shaking but at Tony’s offer the boy instantly relaxed. His body wasn’t shaking as much and his uneven breaths had calmed down. The little boy simply raised an hand and rested it on Tony’s chest, directly on top of his arc reactor scar before a muffled “Yes please,” escaped his mouth.
“I sure am. Thank you Mr. Stark,” Bailey said. “Thank you for bringing my family here. I can’t thank you enough,” the blonde hummed.
“Hey Pete,” Bailey said as she took a step towards the boy. “This nice man is going to get us out of here and take us to a safe place. Doesn’t that sound nice,” She said as the boy turned his gaze to the girl. He stared at her silently before looking back to Steve, and then back to Bailey. “He’s a nice man. He won’t hurt us,” Bailey insisted as she continued to walk towards the little boy.
“Hey bud, you still with me?” Tony asked as he leaned against a counter in a private room in the wig, bouncing Peter gently in his arms.
“Good luck. It was good to see you again,” Steve said, strength back in his voice.
“Tony?” Pepper called softly as she knocked on the door before opening it slowly. As the door swung open, the first thing she saw was Tony, sitting on the bed with his back leaning against the headboard of the bed. He had a black t shirt on and Pepper assumed he had sweats on, but it was hard to see as the sheets covered his legs. “Tony?” Pepper asked again as she closed the door to the dimly lit room, but the inventor didn’t respond. He seemed too wrapped up in whatever he was looking at on his Stark-Pad.  Pepper let out a heavy sigh and made her way to the edge of the bed.
“Did you locate her family?” Pepper asked as she reassuringly squeezed Tony’s shoulder.
Also, thank you all for the lovely comments you have left on here, as well as talking with me on Tumblr, I really appreciate it!!!
, before putting out milk and cookies for Santa, and sending Peter to bed.
“Thank you,” Tony said, his voice shaking slightly. Pepper just hummed as she continued to run her hands through Tony’s hair. “I’m a bad father,” Tony suddenly muttered. “I promised Peter I would be back as soon as I woke up from a nap...and I’ve been awake for hours, just hiding out in here,” Tony huffed, his voice wavering even more.
“Will it hurt?” Peter asked, his voice wobbling slightly as he pulled his free arm away from his body and held it out for Tony to take.
“I uh...”Peter muttered, a sudden wave of emotion flooding over him. How could Pops seem so angry almost an hour ago and now be so calm? “I went to the store but I didn’t have my card on me,” Peter admitted with a shrug as he pushed past Steve, and towards his bedroom where his coat resided.
“You too Capsicle. And for God’s sake get a haircut,” And in an instant the man was gone, leaving Steve alone by the car.
“When did you become so sassy?” Tony grumbled as he rolled his eyes before getting up and stepping towards the sink to wash his hands.  Looking back at his son, Tony sighed. “Okay Peter. While changing your diaper is great, and I feel like we’ve really bonded, I honestly don’t want to repeat that. So try not to go in your diaper, okay? It’s okay to have accidents, don’t feel bad if you do go in it...but if you have to go to the bathroom, just tell me and we’ll work on that. Okay?” Tony said wearly as he eyed the little boy.
“Can I call you dad?” Peter asked again as if he hadn’t even heard what Tony was saying.
Again, thank you all for all of your support. It means the world to me!
Steve Rogers knew that he was in love with Tony Stark. That much he was sure about. In the past, and the moments leading up to the now, Steve knew that to be truth. He just didn’t know how much he loved the inventor.
His super metabolism always burned off any earthly alcohol he consumed. But here in space, he could drink three cups and he would be set. And so Steve drank, and drank, and drank. He needed to forget his botched plan to spend the rest of his life with Peggy. He needed to forget that the only other person he had ever loved besides her was gone, no longer apart of his world. He needed to forget.
All thoughts about going home vanished from his mind as Peter pressed on towards the tower.  Tony might be gone for the Holidays, but if he was home, Peter would drop by for a bit before heading home.
“Shit,” Steve hissed under his breath as people watching the movie began to complain about Tony standing up. But Steve didn’t care because Tony was having a panic attack. “Tony,” Steve said, trying to get his husband’s attention but suddenly Tony was bolting through the crowd of seated people and was making his way out of the park.
“You too Spangles,” Tony said, his voice shaking ever so slightly. “Is the kid in there?” he then asked as he nodded towards the doors. Tony was desperate to change the subject to anything that might keep them from talking about their past.
Tony was surprised to wake up to sun filtering into the room. Normally he was awake before the sun even came up, or he was asleep when it was already daytime, causing him to use the curtains. This was different though. The room was bright and
“I thought I just told you-” Steve began, but Tony was quick to cut him off.
“My time?” Tony asks for a moment, his eyes scanning over Steve before his mouth dropped open, his eyebrows shooting up. “You’re-” He began but stopped to let out a gasp that turned into a violent cough. “Did we do it? Did we bring everyone back? Are you returning the stones?” Tony asked, eyeing the case that Steve held in his hands.
“Yeah,” Steve simply said with a nod. “I’m done fighting this urge,” he explained.
God, why couldn’t he breathe?
“I-I’ll get another one,” Peter muttered quietly as he turned to go back into his bedroom and get dressed to go outside.
Of course it was Steve, Tony thought. Who else could it be?
“You just have to be quiet so that we can talk-”
“Yeah..of course,” Tony said as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “Listen, I need to get files from these computers here...You know, make sure we know what they were doing here, get the information we need on all the kids, that sort of thing.” Tony said. Plus, he really just wanted to know more about the kid. “I’m going to get F.R.I.D.A.Y. started on collecting all of that and uh...I’ll just meet you back here in a few hours,” Tony said as he pointed his thumb behind him, towards the double door.
“Peter Benjamin Star-Rogers you get in here right now!” Steve called. Oh boy, Peter thought. He used the full name. Tossing himself out of bed, the sickly boy shuffled out of his room and down the hall into the kitchen where he assumed Steve was. And he was correct .
“Need help?” A baritone voice called from the once closed door. And there was Steve, standing there with that lopsided grin and messy hair. Tony felt his heart flutter for a moment as he thought about the old days, but he quickly suppressed those thoughts. He couldn’t think like that.
“Nope. Don’t want to hear it Cap! I said it’s going to be okay, so it’s going to be okay. I’ve seen your true colors today Mr. Rogers,” Tony said as he suddenly stood up, only to look down at Steve. “So when my Steve does me wrong, I’ll know there was some form of positive intent. I’ll know that this sappy Steve Rogers is out there somewhere, madly in love with me,” Tony said with a smile. “We’ll see you in a few years then,” he said before patting Steve on the shoulder and walking away.
“I think that’s an understatement,” Steve said, shaking his head. “What are you doing here?” He then asked.  Steve was about to ask why he wasn’t dead, but then remembered how Tony and Scott explained that Loki had gotten away with the tesseract back in 2012 New York. This must be that Loki.
“Tony.” Pepper hummed as she added pressure to her hands to let Tony know that she meant business. “He is a little boy. I’m sure he is just as scared as you. But he can’t understand what others are feeling and needing right now. And if he can’t do that...there is no way he is going to hold a grudge towards you because you didn’t come when you said you would.”
and there wasn’t going to be any cookies for Santa. There was no Christmas Spirit. There was no Christmas.
Everything hurt and once he had his door closed behind him he began to srtip articles of clothing one by one, leaving a trail to his bedroom. By the time he collapsed in his bed he was down to his boxers and socks. Normally he hated sleeping with socks, but today he would make an exception.
“You need a bath and and a change of clothes, and so do I. Once I’m cleaned up I’ll be back to stay with you,” Tony explained as he turned the corner and into the wig with the other children.
“Are there any sort of side effects to something like that?” Pepper suddenly asked.
“No, I can do that,” the girl said with a shaky nod.
“Jarvis,” Tony said, as if that was the answer to his question. “He has eyes all over the city. But most importantly, all over my tower and the surrounding block. After the battle, he alerted me to the fact that there was another Captain America...and another Ironman. And I know for a fact it wasn’t me,” Tony said as he fished out his phone. After fiddling with it for a moment, security footage appeared in front of him. The first was a shot of 2023 Tony flying in the broken window of the tower, behind everyone else before jumping back out. Suddenly the footage changed to Steve and the 2012 version of himself fighting one another.
“Tony,” Steve huffed. It was obvious that the soldier was hurt by Tony’s words. “You were my world. You still are. I mean, when I came out of the ice, when I woke up, I had no one. Nothing. I was so lost and broken, But then you showed up. And even though we bickered back and forth, you gave me a second chance. You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong. Tony, you gave me a home,” Steve said, his heart breaking for the millionth time that day. “I love you Tony,” Steve said, his voice cracking. Tony just looked at the blonde for a long moment, his lips pressed in a fine line as a single tear fell from his lashes.
“Yeah,” Peter said with a large yawn, but didn’t move other than that. “Did you?” He then asked, his big doe eyes staring into Tony’s soul.
“So let me get this straight. You are here to return the stones that you took so that my world doesn’t fall apart. And you needed them to defeat this big cosmic evil being...and you succeeded?” Tony asked. Steve could only nod. “But you’re hanging around here because you miss me? And you can’t stand to be in a world where I don’t exist anymore,” Tony said, raising an eyebrow. “Is that correct?” Tony asked.
was tired, he couldn’t imagine how Steve felt.
When Peter returned back to the apartment, Steve was already asleep. The apartment felt dark and cold. Where was the warmth that Christmas was supposed to bring? Where was the family? Where were the friends? Where was the
“Everything,” Peter said almost automatically, though his voice quivered slightly. It was obvious he was nervous.
The fact was that he loved Tony, and the man seemed to have the same feelings for him as well. There had been many conversations that lasted late into the night about their relationship. “Are you sure about this,” was said quite often by either of the men, followed by quick nodding or a small grunt to confirm the question. In fact, they had only been “officially” dating for a little over a week. There were small kisses to the lips and holding hands, but so far that was the extent to how intimate they were together. Tony was willing to go the pace that made Steve feel comfortable.
“Oh just hold on beloved,” Tony chuckled as he squeezed Steve’s hand. “We’re not finished yet,” he said, only to get a confused look in return.
“Mmmhm,” Steve hummed a little too quickly before nodding. He knew what that meant.
“Get another one!? Peter! It’s Christmas eve! All the stores are closed up!” the blonde called out.
This story is constantly evolving and I have some BIG plans for this! Hopefully I will get into a good grove and be able to update once a week, if not bi-weekly.
“Or I can just sleep here with you,” Peter offered innocently. A nervous laugh bubbled out of Tony’s throat and he shook his head as he sat up.
And the thing was, things were amazing. The dinner on the river was intimate and beautiful and Tony enjoyed not having to worry about anything else except for having a good time with the love of his life. They talked over dinner before going out on the deck to watch the city as they floated by.
“I sure am,” Steve said as a small smile spread across his face. The food Tony had cooked was out on the table so Steve simply grabbed a spare plate and began to serve himself some eggs and bacon.
This kid had to be his, and Tony had fallen in love instantly.
“What, I can’t just come up here to visit Peter?” Pepper said innocently before taking another apple off of Tony’s plate. The inventor scrunched his nose together and stuck out his tongue, but the woman simply shook his head. “I did come up here to see Peter,” she continued. “But I also came to tell you a few things,” Pepper said as she shifted herself to look at Tony a little better.
“I know you Steven Stark-Rogers. If there is a will, there is a way for you to find trouble,” Tony joked. “Just be good, m’kay? Remember, I love you.”
In all honesty, Tony was afraid that Peter might not want anything to do with him after the finger prick, but the boy eagerly turned around in Steve’s grasp and held out his arms. Steve gently lifted Peter up and the boy was glued to Tony’s hip once more.
“Goodnight squirt,” the inventor hummed, leaning down and pressing a gentle kiss to the top of Peter’s head before leaving the room. “Friday, If Peter wakes up and he’s scared, let him know where I am,” Tony said to his AI once he was back out in the hallway. - And now here he was laying in bed, desperately trying to get his mind to calm down so that he could give his tired body a rest.
“No,” Peter said innocently, shaking his head before finishing the food in his mouth. “I slept with daddy all night! I was too scared and the bed is too squishy,” Peter said before taking some eggs in his hand and shoving it into his mouth.
“Okay!” the little boy replied as he slid off of the bed and followed Tony out of the room. By the time Peter and Tony were in the bathroom the man could tell that Peter was waddling uncomfortably.
From then on Tony was only left with the information Dr. Lucas had given him, in addition to his own thoughts. Ideas and worries circulated through the inventor’s mind before a tiny voice pulled him out of his head.
,” Tony said as he slowed his hips with the music before stopping. “And my hips don’t lie Steve,” Tony said as he wriggled his eyebrows. “Okay,
“I’m sorry I can’t stay longer,” Peter said, a few tears escaping his eyes.
It was nearly three in the morning, and Tony was still awake. Both he and Pepper had taken up camp next to Peter’s bed. They quietly talked back and forth between each other for a good part of the night. Pepper would get all of the legal stuff sorted out so that Peter would actually exist in the eyes of the government. From there they worked out getting a room ready for Peter. Tony wasn’t sure how long Peter would stay with him, but both he and Pepper thought it was a good idea to give Peter his own room. From there they talked about little things, but soon Pepper fell asleep.
“It’s okay Peter. You’re busy. So am I…just promise you’ll be here for New Years, Okay?” He asked, looking over at Peter and smiling.
The first people to pass were SHIELD agents, including the Secretary, followed by Thor who pushed a bound Loki by the arm so that he was walking in front of his elder brother. The dark haired trickster walked right past Steve, but not before turning his head slightly to look at the man. Loki’s eyebrows rose in surprise for a moment and then were suddenly relaxing the next. Before Loki was pushed out of sight, though, he winked at Steve, making the man smile behind the pamphlet he was holding. Steve couldn’t believe that he actually went back.
“Two days,” Tony muttered as he scrubbed his face with a free hand. “Okay. Two days. Got it. Thanks again for your help Dr. Lucas. Just keep me in the loop, okay?” Tony said as he began to turn back towards the beds in the room.
In fact..it could be happening right now.
“I’m sure it will, thanks Rogers,” Tony said before leaving the room.
In the end, it was much larger than any of the men would have expected. The location was heavily guarded from the inside. It had guards posing as park rangers in the front room, but as soon as they saw the three enter the front door, they jumped into action. Of Course the group took them down with no problem, and from there they moved through the building. They quickly found a staircase that led them to a lower level where they found room after room of HYDRA agents. At first there were the standard rooms: Labs, rooms with computers, living areas. But then things began to change drastically. Steve definitely knew something was wrong when he found a small closet-like room that held three female bodies. They couldn’t have been dead more that a few days and the sight made Steve’s stomach churn.
All the men looked at each other in shock as each one tried to think about what the next step would be after hearing information like that.
“And you have enough Pym Particles to do that?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
“They were at one point,” Tony said flatly. “Long gone before Steve got there though.” There was a pregnant pause as Pepper tried to decide what to say to Tony, but the man continued to speak before Pepper could say anything. “Mary Fitzpatrick Parker. The mother of my son,” Tony muttered, still looking at the screen.
“I think it’s time I face the music and go back to my own time. I’m sorry if I lead you on. I just think-”
“There is no way to know for sure right now but-” Sam began but Steve was up in a flash and stalking towards the door into the other room.
“It was nice to meet you,” Tony said as he turned back to Russell and Lynette before backing towards the doorway. “You have a very brave daughter,” Tony said before giving a quick wave. “Have a good night everyone,” Tony said and then exited the room. But not before he heard a wave of “thank you”s coming from the room.
“But what are you leaving behind?” Peggy asked, her eyes sad. Steve actually stopped then, and took a moment to consider what he would be leaving behind.
“Okay,” The boy finally said in a shaky voice as he held out his arms so that Steve could take him. As Steve pulled Peter out of Tony’s arms, the inventor felt his slightly damp shirt being peeled off his his body. The material followed Peter for a brief moment before falling onto Tony’s cool skin and the sensation sent a shiver up Tony’s spine. The inventor shifted for a moment, but tried not to make a big deal out of it.
Steve Stark-Rogers stood in the kitchen with hell in his eyes as he held a gold wrapped item in his hands. Upon further inspection Peter decided that it was a ham. But why did he look so angry? Okay, he was wearing his winter coat…so he was just outside but…
So Steve opted to sitting on the sidelines at an empty table and drink his drink as he watched his boyfriend dance in the mix of the other people. And Steve had to admit, Tony was a damn good dancer. He seemed to be able to dance to every style of music, even when he was tipsy. But nothing could prepare Steve for what was to come.
It had been a long day, and it was well into the night when Steve plopped down on a couch in one of the living quarter. The soldier ran a hand over his face as he tried to wrap his mind around what he had seen that day. In the end, there were only five survivors. The infant girl, Bailey, Peter, a two year old boy who no one could identify, and another pregnant teen named Samantha. They had all been fed, cleaned, and now they rested in the other room while Steve and Sam tried to figure out what to do.
“Don’t say that. Not after everything I’ve just done to you. I don’t deserve it,” Steve said, his heart heavy. “I think I came to the wrong time. I honestly should just give up this fantasy I have that we’ll somehow be able to be together. Peggy didn’t work out, why should I have thought this would be different?” Steve huffed, pulling away from Tony.
“Don’t be sorry Peter. It’s not your fault,” Tony said with a nervous smile before taking the baby powder and applying it to Peter. Within a few minutes Peter was standing back up again in a fresh diaper.
“Oh. So you like a firm mattress, huh? Well, we’ll get Pepper to change that so you feel better when you sleep,” Tony said as he began to sit up.
“I’m well aware Cap,” the inventor said, tilting his head to the side. “So are you from a different dimension, or are you from the future?” Tony asked, wiggling his eyebrows.
“And if you do make noises it will be okay because you’re just a kid and-”
“Well, well, well, Mr. Rogers, you definitely took your sweet time getting back here, didn’t you,” the Ancient One said. Her tone was harsh, but she had a smile on her face and kindness in her eyes. “Did you have a good life?” she asked, walking closer to Steve as he held out the stone.
“You kind of have to when you’re on that list too,” Clint said drily as he leaned against the wall. “You look well,” He then mentioned, though he could only see the outline of Tony in the dark.
“ Subject 009 - “Peter”. Born August 27, 2013. Mother: Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker. Father: Tony Stark.” He read out loud before looking at the picture that accompanied the first page. “Peter,” he muttered, wondering who gave him that name. He was going to read more, but all he could do was stare at the picture. The kid definitely had Stark hair. In fact, it reminded Tony of his mother’s hair, even if it was messy and poorly cut. And his nose was a stark nose. The one thing that stuck out to him those were the kid’s big brown eyes as they stared back at him. They actually reminded him of Bambi’s big eyes from the old Disney movie. As Tony looked at the picture longer and longer, though, he could only come to one conclusion.
“I’m sorry,” Peter whined again as he looked at Tony with obvious concern.
“Tony where are you?” Pepper asked, worry now in her voice.
Also, my wonderful friend and coworker, quellthefire, commissioned some art from the previous chapter! It's by ribkadory (Go check them out on Tumblr!) and I'm in love with it!!
“And one thing you can taste,” Steve asked, his free hand now running circles on Tony’s back.
His large brown eyes snapped over to Steve’s and he felt like the kid as looking into his soul. His brown hair was lazily cut as some of it was much longer than other strands that framed his dirty round face. As Steve observed the room he noted that it looked like the boy had been drawing something in the dirt floor. The thing that really hit Steve, though, was the smell. It was obvious that the child was using this small cell as a bathroom and the only thing Steve could think was that this kid looked like a wild animal.
“It’s Thursday Peter. It’s December 24
“Sorry,” both men said in unison. Steve kept his head down avoiding eye contact as he tried to push past the man who he had just hit, but suddenly the man spoke up.
“Vaguely,” Pepper said as she adjusted her grip on the coat she was holding. “All he said was that you had found his son in some sort of secret lab I guess.” Pepper lulled into silence for a moment before looking up at Steve. “How old is he?” the woman then suddenly asked.
“Is Peter Tony’s son?” Pepper hesitantly asked.
“Pepper...I-I have a son,” Tony blurted out. It was quiet for a moment before the woman spoke.
“I think we all have,” Tony said as he made his way towards the mouth of the hall “Thanks, Goodnight Pepper.” --  It was only eight thirty in the evening, but Tony was absolutely exhausted. As soon as he put Peter to bed, he was going to crash.
“But I’m not big yet so until then I’ll sleep with you,” Peter said confidently.
What was he going to do? He didn’t want his aunt and uncles getting sick because of him. But now almost every store was going to be closed. It was Christmas Eve and…wait. Peter remembered watching TV and seeing that The Target department store was going to be open till eleven. Peter had never been there in his life. But he was sure that they had food. Surly they would have a ham. Especially if it was on the holidays. Pulling out his phone, Peter looked up the directions. It was going to be about an hour trip from Pop’s apartment. He just had to get his card.
“Mr. Stark,” the man said with wide eyes as he extended his arm forward.  “My name is Russell, and this is my wife, Lynette,” the man said as a woman appeared at his side. “We’re Bailey’s parents. We- We can’t thank you enough. F-For brining our daughter back to us,” Russell said as tears began to fall down his face.
me know all that stuff. It’s not my fault.” Peter cried out, covering his small face with his hands.
“Boss is in his bedroom. He has not left since he called you,” the trusty AI responded.
Yeah. Maybe Peter shouldn’t have said that to Pops.
He had to make a phone call.
You should definitely find me on Tumblr (or leave a comment). I love interacting with all of you, it makes me so happy. I love to see what you enjoyed about the fic, what I could work on, and any ideas. (Because let's be real, this fic is constantly evolving. I would love to get readers ideas and input!!!!) -- My tumblr url is the same as my username here, so come find me!!!
“Will do Mr. Stark,” Dr. Lucas replied.
“Peter!” the voice shouted again. “Peter get in here. Right now!”
As Steve stayed close to the edges of the room, his eyes landed on Tony who was with a group of SHIELD agents, Thor, and Loki. It looked like some sort of commotion had just happened, as Tony was being helped off the floor. Steve watched as the group conversed for a while, and then suddenly they were walking towards him. Thinking quickly, Steve pressed himself back in a corner, grabbing a pamphlet to hide behind as the group made their way past him. As they did so, Steve’s eyes wandered up to catch a glimpse of the people.
Peter was cold and shaking, and honestly, Tony was a little surprised by that. But as soon as the two touched, Peter was quick to move into Tony’s embrace. The older man pulled Peter close to his chest and layed back down before rolling over so that Peter was closer to the middle of the bed instead of the edge. With that the man took his large hands and pushed back Peter’s hair so that it was out of the little boy’s face. Now the father and son just layed in bed, staring back at each other.
It wasn’t like they were in a relationship anymore. But they were close friends, and Pepper had been there for him through thick and thin. She would be livid if she found out Tony had kept this from her.
“Tony?” the small voice said, and Tony instantly turned his head to see Peter looking up at him from the bed. He hadn’t moved, or even shifted, but his eyes were definitely open.
“See! Look what you did,” Tony grumbled as he dabbed Peter’s finger with a cotton ball a few times before squeezing the finger so that he could get a good blood sample.
Tony’s eyes surveyed his surroundings before his eyes fell onto the little boy who was taking up most of his king sized bed. During the night Peter had wormed his way away from Tony and underneath the covers before sprawling out on his stomach. His little arms and legs took up a lot more space than Tony thought a kid his age could. But in all honestly didn’t mind Tony.
Steve was alone.
“Please don’t tell daddy,” Peter suddenly spoke up as tears began to collect in his eyes.
“You were always good at drawing, or at least that’s what Howard said. Seeing it in person though, it’s not just good, it’s amazing,” The man said as he leaned forward, getting into Steve’s personal space. At the mention of Howard, Steve stilled before turning his head to look at the man who was leaning into him.
“Wine...we were drinking wine earlier,” Tony muttered, as he pushed his face into Steve’s chest.
Opening the door to the apartment quietly, Peter made his way towards his room. He just needed his card, and another dose of Nyquil. If Pops didn’t see him, it would make things even better.
From there the two made their way to the park and it was better than Tony could have imagined. The weather was beautiful, the lights from the city looked perfect and their wasn’t a tone of people. And if anyone seemed bothered by Captain America and Ironman leisurely walking around in three piece suits, they didn’t say anything.
“No, I need to tell him. Now.”
“-And you can take him anywhere you want. When you get scared you just need to hug him and he will keep you safe with his shield,” Steve explained.
A heavy sigh escaped Tony’s mouth as he slowly climbed into bed. His aged body popped and cracked as he leaned forward and pulled the covers over him. “Lights,” Tony commanded, and soon he has laying in darkness. And Tony tried to fall asleep, he really did, but the day’s events were still running through his mind.
“I’ll do what I can,” Steve said, a broken smile on his lips.
Hi everyone. I know this is an extremely late update. Sorry about that. Life just kinda sucks right now.  -- On the bright side, there is an update. Not a lot happens in this chapter, but I just wanted to get it out there and let you guys know that I'm still working on this thing.
“What?” The boy called as he opened the door, coming face to face with the blue eyed soldier.
“Hey, I’m sorry. I’m all for telling Stark, but you absolutely cannot call him from here,” Sam protested.
“Tony,” A strong voice sounded from behind him and suddenly the man felt himself being pulled up from off the ground and against a strong chest. “You’re okay. You’re okay,” The voice soothed. “I got you. Just follow my breathing, okay. You got this,” The voice said as a hand came up and rested on Tony’s head. Now Tony could feel the person taking deliberate breaths, and even though he knew he should be trying to match the breathing, he couldn’t.
As Steve made his way into the common area, he saw a figure hunched over the kitchen island. They were holding a cup of amber liquid in there hand, while a larger bottle sat on the counter. The closer Steve got, the closer he could tell who the person was. Tony.
Steve slowly raised a hand and waved slightly at Peter before backing through the door and closing it. The blonde didn’t even waste time as he looked over at Sam and said, “I have to tell Tony.”
“Hey now,” Steve said calmly as he reached out and pulled the little boy up against his chest. “If Tony knew about this, he wouldn’t be mad,” Steve said, trying to sooth the boy. “Your dad loves you, you hear me? He wouldn’t be mad, just a little worried,” Steve said. The little boy was now shaking against his body, and the man couldn't help but feel bad for thinking (even for a moment) that Peter as some sort of threat. He was a little boy who was scared, and who felt safe enough around Steve to tell him the truth.
“But Peter. He’s depending on me!” Tony said quickly, trying to desperately get the subject off of Steve. He would rather die than proceed down that road.
“Alright, alright. Mr. America can stay with you,” Tony said with a heavy sigh as he rolled his eyes. It was clear Peter had a thing for Steve, and the inventor wasn’t sure how thrilled he was about it.
Now that Tony was back out in the dim hallway with only Pepper, he let out a shaky breath, his head dipping slightly. It was clear that the interaction he had just had made him more than a little stressed.
“Peter will,” Tony interjected. “I promised Peter I would be there, and I’m not. Pepper,” Tony said, almost pleading as he said her name. “That kid was depending on me and I let him down. If I can’t even be there for him...If I can’t...God. Pepper, I’m screwing things up already.”
“No!” Peter screamed this time as he began to crawl up Tony’s side so he was now almost sitting on his shoulder.  “No, No, No,No, No!”
When Pepper walked into the kitchen area of the living-space, she was surprised to see Tony and Peter sitting at the table with eggs, turkey-bacon, and apple slices on each plate. Honestly the eggs looked overcooked, the bacon looked a little more crispy than it should for peak taste, and the apples were cut askew with seeds still on some of the edges of the fruit. But when Pepper looked over to Peter, he was eating the food with a big smile on his face. It was clear he was enjoying himself, and Pepper didn’t want to say anything to ruin that.
“I’m sorry,” Steve huffed, wiping his face. “I’m a mess,” he muttered.
“Oh Peter, no buddy.” Tony said, his face falling as the tone in his voice fell as well. “I-I-I’m not your dad. Okay. There is a big difference between a dad and a father and-”
The first part of this chapter took me forever to wright. Seriously. I would type it up, delete it, and retype it again and again. I don't really like how it turned out, but I have to post something eventually. I'm sorry.
“Tony, I’m so sorry,” Steve said trying to comfort the man.
“You know you would be imprisoned,” Steve said, raising an eyebrow.
The light shone inches away from a face that belonged to Clint Barton. And from the soft glow of the gauntlet, Tony could see that there was an arrow about four inches in front of his face. The two men stood there only staring at eachother before Clint lowered the bow and arrow.
Tony suddenly stopped mid-turn and his mouth fell open. The exact same time, his glass cup came crashing to the hardwood floor, sending glass and bourbon in every direction. Steve winced at the sound, but never took his eyes off of the man who was looking at him like he was some sort of specter.
“I’m not sure, but they didn’t express interest in him. Either way, I should probably be there with you as well. I’m sure there is some legal paperwork one of us will have to fill out.”
The final part of the night began when the two approached the movie on the lawn. Steve eyed Tony for a long moment and the smaller man was quick to catch his gaze.
The reunion had been emotional as Peggy cried, pulling Steve into her home. They had hugged each other,they cried, they talked and Steve had finally got to have his dance with Peggy. Everything was perfect.
great? I mean what did I ever do for you that would make you go off on some manic adventure in space the moment I die?” Tony asked, laughing lightly.
“You can sleep with me every once in a while, but when you get older, you’ll be too big! You’ll have to sleep in your own bed then.”
Steve’s eyes were locked on Tony and as soon as he got close enough, his eyes dropped down to the man’s hips. Tony only chuckled as he danced closer to Steve, bumping into him with his hips every once in a while. Steve simply raised his hands and hesitantly hovered over Tony’s constant swaying hips.
“Well I’m really glad you did Peter. You made my night,” Tony said, that smile still on his face.
“You know, I was supposed to keep your from taking the Tesseract...or track you down and bring you back to your original timeline, keep the Tesseract from leaving earth at the moment you disappeared with it.” Steve laughed, thinking how ironic it was that Loki had happened upon him. He always thought he would have to spend months looking form him, yet here he was.
When she had talked to Tony, it was clear that he was very distressed. Pepper knew how sensitive Tony was with issues like these, and now to be thrusted in one...she couldn’t imagine what he was going through. By the time she pulled into the compound it was almost six o’clock at night, and it was starting to get dark.
“I know you do,” Tony said with a nod as he patted Peter’s back. “I know. I love you to, okay Peter?” He said, looking his son dead in the eyes.
“That’s quite alright sweetie,” She said, though she seemed a bit perturbed.
Tony and Steve were not the only ones in the room, though. In fact they were causing quite the scene. They hadn’t publicly announced they were together, yet, so many people were watching. Some of those people included Sam, Clint, Natasha, and Bucky. They had been watching the entire scene go down from the bar.
As the door came off, Steve came face to face with a blonde girl who stood a few feet away from the door. She was young, maybe sixteen, but definitely no more than eighteen. And she looked sick. Her skin was pale and sticky like she had a fever or had been sweating a lot. Bags hung under her hazel eyes as she looked at Steve and the soldier noticed that she was very pregnant.
“We will meet with the doctores tomorrow and then make a game plan from there. If everything goes smoothly I don’t know why he couldn’t be out in the next two days,” Dr. Lucas replied.
“Congratulations Boss,” FRIDAY said in her cool voice. “You’re the proud father of a bouncing baby boy. Peter and you are a match.”
Different questions kept circulating through Tony’s mind and before he could answer any of them, he found himself outside of a small building on the edge of Washington State. He stared at the building for a minute before removing himself from the suit, only leaving a gauntlet on his right hand for protection. After All, this was a HYDRA base.
He was out cold, still in his rogue Captain America uniform, and Tony couldn’t help but think that it must be very uncomfortable to sleep in something like that. Part of him wanted to wake the captain up, but in the end he only stared at him for a moment before moving on. Steve needed the sleep. If he was uncomfortable, he wouldn't’ be sleeping so hard. Or at least that’s what Tony told himself. Anything to excuse himself from interacting with Steve.
“Can I call you dad?” Peter asked, his small eyebrows going up in anticipation.
“Yeah. Everything about you. Even stuff before you became Captain America. I know about Mr. Barnes and I know about your shield and-”
“Hey Tony,” Steve hummed a sad smile on his face as he looked up to see the inventor staring back at him. He was still wearing that old suit they had found before coming on to the base the first time. “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be back in your time?” the blonde asked.
Peter remembered going around the city with Pops and looking at all the buildings that had Christmas lights. He remembered laying a blanket out with him on the floor next to the Christmas tree and watching Christmas movies every night until he would fall asleep. And on Christmas eve, Steve would read
Even though Tony opted for the faster method of travel, there was still time to think. So many questions were running through his mind. How had someone received the means to make a child that shared his DNA? How old was the kid? Had the kid been experimented on? Was he hurt? Was he functional for his age? And soon Tony was going down another rabbit hole of questions like: Where am I going to keep him? What if he needs major help? Can I even do this? Can I raise a child on my own?
“I can’t do that to you Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head. “You have only known me for a month in this world. It would be like having a stranger living with you. That’s not fair.”
Tony simply watched Peter as he ate his own food. He figured he would normally have Peter eat with a fork, but he was a kid, he could do what he want. Also, did he even know how to use a fork? Or did they just eat with their hands while in captivity? Honestly, Tony would not have be surprised if they had.
To say that Tony was tired was an understatement. He had only gotten a few hours of sleep before Steve had called him, and there was no way he could get sleep with all the events that had occured since. All Tony could do was numbly stare out the window from the medical wing of the compound.
“Wh-what’s wrong buddy?” Tony asked suddenly as he pulled away from his son to get a better look at his face.
Right. Sam, Bucky, Clint, and Natasha were coming over for Christmas Dinner.
God damn this kid was going to kill him.
,” Steve muttered under his breath as his blue eyes finally flickered up to meet the inventor’s chocolate orbs.
“I’m okay!” Peter said quietly as Tony grit his teeth and rolled his eyes at Friday’s commentary, unaware that Peter had even said anything.
“Sure. Sure,” Tony said as he stood up as well. “I’ll walk you outside, okay?” He said as he walked with his son to the elevator. It was silent as they made their way to the front doors. “Text me when you get home, okay? You may be seventeen now, but I still worry about you kid,” Tony hummed.
And Tony obsessed over it, making sure everything was perfect. From the food they ate to the route the yacht took, to even the kind of blanket they would sit on in the grass while they watched the movie. Everything had to be perfect for Tony’s amazing and wonderful husband.
This only lasted a moment, though, before Tony took Steve’s hands in his own and placed them on top of his moving hips. “There ya’ go Cap,” Tony slurred as he brushed up against Steve, feeling the bulge against his own every now and then.
“That would be great.”
Soooo....this is my first full-blown fic (not just a one-shot) when it comes to the MCU. Go easy on me please! This idea came to me while I was at work, and I'm not sure how it ill pan out...but I thought i would just give it a go.
Tony tried to set Peter down on the bed but the Boy stuck to him like glue.
“By Odin’s beard, is that Captain America?” A voice called out, making Steve’s blood run cold. No one, absolutely no one, should know that name here. Hell, Steve was even wondering how
As Steve listened, he could only frown. Was this what Tony had been going through in the few weeks that followed Siberia? If Steve would have known this was how Tony was dealing with that event would have chosen an entirely new path.
“Hey there Pete,” Tony said as he shifted in the chair so that he was leaning closer to the bed, his elbows resting on his knees. “Did you have a good sleep?” He asked.
“Okay,” Peter said with a nod.
“Sure. I know about all of the Avengers,” Peter said with a shrug. “I know about Natasha Romanova and the red room...and a lot more. I know about Dr. Bruce Banner and his work with gamma radiation. And then Tony and his Iron Man suits. I know how they are built and how to shut them down and stuff like that...but that’s only for the old suits.” Peter said in a quiet voice.
Now all that was left was Peter.
Tony tried not to think about that and continued thinking of a solution. Peter would need someone a bit closer that could nurture him. For some reason Tony thought of Pepper, but that thought instantly went away. One, because he knew Pepper couldn’t handle a child (especially his) and two because
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve hummed as he pulled Tony away from his chest so he could get a good look at him. Even with his eyes puffy from crying, and snot running down his face, Steve could honestly say Tony was the most beautiful thing he had seen. “I’ve got you.”
“I’m here alone, and I would like to keep it that way, so please leave,” Steve huffed, turning his attention back to his drink.
Tony looked over at Peter who was grinning back at him. His focus then went over to Pepper and then his gaze landed on Steve. There was absolutely no way he was going to let Steve watch Peter. It’s not like he didn’t think Steve was capable. He just had his own issues to work out with the man before-
“Oh my God, Steve!” The woman said, pressing her palm against her chest as she tried to collect herself. She was clearly not expecting to run into anyone. “Tony said you were here,” She said after a moment of catching her breath.
“Okay,” the inventor huffed quietly as he reached up and scratched the back of his neck. “Do you want to see him?” Tony then asked as he looked back up at Pepper.
“There is no reason to thank me,” Tony said as he let go of Russell’s hand and put both of his hands up in a defensive position. “I hardly did anything. If there is anyone you should be thanking, it’s Captain Rogers,” Tony said as he pushed his hands into the pockets of his black sweatpants.
“No prison can hold me for long,” Loki chuckled. “Besides, I can catch up on some reading, relax during my time there. I’m in need of it,” Loki said before standing up, clapping Steve on the shoulder.
“Okay. Clint, take these two and the baby down to the living quarters. Get them something to eat, see if you can find a change of clothes and get them a shower or something, let them rest. After you have that I need you to go back up top and stand guard, make sure no one else get’s in the building. Sam and I will find the others and bring them to to your location,” Steve said as he turned and looked at Bailey. “Can you stay with these two by yourself for a little bit while we get the others?” He asked. “If it’s too much I’ll have Sam come with you as well,” he offered.
“But I’m not sick...or hurt,” Peter mumbled into Tony’s shoulder.
“I’m using the card Dad gave me. I hope you’re okay with him paying for Christmas dinner,” the teen huffed before closing the door and marching out.
And in the next second Tony froze. It looked about how he thought it would look, but the smell hit him pretty quick. Tony could only sit there as he tried to keep his composure while trying to suppress the urge to gag.
Tony didn’t know why, but for some reason his heart swelled with admiration. Even though they disagreed about certain things, Clint was a good guy with a good heart. Lately he had always been thinking about Steve’s band of fugitives with a negative outlook, but this put things into perspective.
“Steve?” they called out, making the other man still. Shit. How had he not recognized that voice when he had said sorry? Honestly, Steve should have ran, but instead, he just stood there, practically shaking as the other man moved around him to get a better look.
The first thing he did was get a haircut. It wasn’t as short as he would normally keep it, but he figured Tony would he satisfied with the outcome. He then got a job in construction. It wasn’t much, but he was able to get a small apartment in Brooklyn. And he just existed there. In a world where Tony was alive and thriving. And maybe he couldn’t be a part of his life, but Steve was okay with that. He was happy just being able to watch.
“Never.” Steve said, squeezing the boy’s shoulders. “He won’t be mad at you. Just the bad people who had you.” Steve explained. “You did nothing wrong though, understand?” Steve asked as he pulled away enough so that he could take Peter’s chin in his hand and tilt it up so they were looking at each other.  Peter just blinked up at the blonde ban a few times, as if trying to find the right words.
“Peter, I’m going to need to see your finger for a minute okay? There will be a little poke and then it will be all over. You can handle that, right?” Tony asked as he crouched down so that he and Peter were the same height.
“Hey Dad!” Peter said, fighting back the tears. He hated seeing his dad alone like this. Especially when it was nearly Christmas. And if Peter felt horrible during the holiday season, he could be sure that the inventor felt even worse.
“But this is where I’m from Peggy. I never should have been pulled from this time but I was, and now I have the opportunity to come back. I have you.”
“How are you doing today sweetie?” The old woman at the register asked as she began to ring Peter up.
“You look like you could use some help,” Steve said with a tired smile that only pulled up on the left side of his face. “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine. Why don’t you let me call their families,” Steve suggested.  Tony couldn’t say no to that face, even if he did have mixed feelings towards Steve. So he let him.
Finding the living quarters was not difficult. Especially when there was a big blonde super-soldier standing in front of the double doors. Tony had been so focused on the fact that he had a kid, though, that he forgot that he would have to see Steve. Tony bit his lower lip as he approached, trying to hide the mixed feelings that were beginning to bubble up inside of him.
“The others,” she said as she pulled away and walked over to the door. ‘We have to get them out too,” She insisted. Of course Steve couldn’t say no.
“Hey, I hear ya’! After we get them out I can-” he began, but Steve cut him off with a shake of his head.
“Do you know what a father is Peter?” He suddenly asked.
“That’s right, we were,” the soldier confirmed and then the two fell into silence. Tony had calmed down considerably, but Steve was going to give him as much time as he needed. The silence was cut off, though, by the sounds of Tony sobbing against his husband’s chest.
“Okay.” Peter sniffed. “But would you help me tell him?”
At first finding the bases was difficult. But once they found one location there were usually other coordinates in the files. That was how they found their latest target. This one seemed suspicious, though. Normally locations could be found on computers, but this one was only written down in a notebook that they had found. In fact, most of the group thought it didn’t exist. Steve had to beg the group to go check it out, and in the end only Sam and Clint had come along.
“I’m not going to lie, that kind of scared me,” Steve laughed nervously as he looked down at his husband, only to realize that something was wrong. Tony was still rigid, his eyes wide as he stared at the space directly in front of him. As more and more explosions ripped across the sky, Steve began to feel Tony trembling beside him, and if he actually paid attention, he could hear the man’s labored breathing.
Steve just watched the group leave.
“I’ll be back soon buddy,” Tony said quickly, trying to get in a quick goodbye. “I love you,” he added on before he brain could stop him. He didn’t know why he had said it...it just sort of fell out of his mouth.
“Peter…do you know what day it is today?” Steve asked, trying to stay calm.  The teen narrowed his eyes and looked around the kitchen, trying to find something that would proclaim the date. A clock, a calendar, anything would do. Because to be honest, Peter had no clue what day it was. A Tuesday maybe?
When Tony turned around with what he needed he saw Steve sitting on the edge of the bed with Peter sitting on his knee. Peter was looking up at the soldier as he spoke and suddenly Tony noticed that Steve was holding a Captain America plushie.
Tonight was a little different, though. Tonight Tony had drank a little too much and was feeling anxious. Parties could do that to a person; especially if the mayor was the one hosting.
The soldier had only been in Peggy’s home for a few hours. He had explained everything. The ice, time travel, Thanos and the snap, and even the Avengers. He fully expected her not to believe him, but she seemed to take everything in stride.
“Cars, an air condition unit and... your heart,” Tony admitted as he pressed his head further into Steve’s chest.
“He’s had a long day,” Pepper hummed as she turned off the TV. Tony was already standing and scooping the dozing boy into his arms.
“Stark,” He said with a nod as Tony lowered his hand.
Of course Tony left a laundry list of things to do. “Make sure you call the authorities and tell them you’ve found the girls, but don’t tell them who you are. You’re are wanted criminal afterall.”, “Make sure you let the parents know that I will be sending down a private jet so that they can see their girls.” and “ Don’t give them too much information though. We don’t want to freak them out. We can get them caught up when they get here. Just let them know their daughters are alive.”  There was of course more, but Steve had to stop the brunet.
“I’m here to help miss,” Steve said has he strode towards the door before putting and hand on the handle. Of course it was locked. “I’m going to get you out of here,okay? Just bare with me for a moment,” He said before literally ripping the door from it’s hinges.
“What’s your name?” he asked, trying to comfort her.
“Are you my father?” Peter asked, and suddenly Tony felt like he couldn't breathe.
“Of course,” Steve said with a nod and then it was silent as the two men looked anywhere but each other. “Why don’t you come in,” Steve said as he waved his hand, motioning for Tony.
“It looks like it was,” She said, taking the time stone. “So what will you do now?” the woman asked.
It was almost hypnotic as the hips swayed from side to side in rhythm with the music. And slowly a warm sensation started to build in Steve’s core. He knew that Tony had a good figure, sure, but he hand never seen it at so many angles. He never knew that Tony’s body was so…attractive. He never really knew that Tony could dance that that. But it made him want to do naughty things to the man.
“No Steve. You just told me you have the power to time travel and you’re just hanging around in the lamest year ever!” Tony interjected, shaking his head. “Sometimes I wonder if your time in the ice affected your brain,” the mechanic said under his breath. “Just...go to a time where we know each other. That’s what I would have done,” Tony said with a shrug. “I’m not saying it would work out, but I think it’s your best shot.”
“You talked to Tony?” Steve asked, his head cocking to the side like some sort of golden retriever.
“You’re telling me,” Sam said as he crossed his arms over his chest.
“Oh no Steve. I’m sorry, but with Thanos out of the picture and you holding onto the time stone, you’ve created an alternate timeline. I’m afraid there is no way for you get back to your original time.” The Ancient One explained. “At least, not by yourself,” she said as orange energy began to form around her hands.
“Yeah. We did,” Steve hummed, his thumb rubbing circles on the back of Tony’s hand.
“I sure did kiddo,” Tony said with a warm laugh. “How are you feeling?”
, and
“And I could say the same to you,” Loki hummed. “Good luck Captain Rogers,” Loki said before disappearing in a cloud of blue smoke, leaving Steve behind.
“I can’t just go with you?” Peter asked, his brows knitting together.
“I’m sorry,” Peter finally said, his voice shaking as tears began to collect on the edges of  his eyes. “Please don’t be mad! I-I just had a nightmare and I woke up and-”
“If there is anything we can do to repay you. Anything at all. Please, let us know,” Russell interjected, causing Tony to let out a small laugh.
“Of course. I’m sure you still are,” Tony said as he tapped the screen to show a shot of Steve, Tony, and Scott standing in an alleyway before all three of them disappear. “You left with the scepter, and honestly, I was a little worried,” Tony said, eyeing Steve. “But then Jarvis tells me a few seconds later, a man that looks like Steve Rogers with a beard had returned it to it’s case,” Tony said as the screen shifted one more time to show Steve returning the scepter. “The thing is Cap, you didn’t leave like the other versions of us. You just walked out the front door...and as far as Jarvis knew, you didn’t disappear. Since then I’ve been keeping tabs on you. So, what are you still doing here?” Steve let out a heavy sigh but Tony just smiled and shook his head. “I’m assuming it’s a long story. I cleared my schedule for the day, so let’s hear it,” The inventor said, watching Steve carefully.
Unfortunately the survivor number was drastically smaller than the ones who were dead. Half were women and girls who were either shot in the head, starved to death, or seemed to have died from complications while giving birth. The others were new born babies or toddlers.
“I’m here to see you,” Steve said, shocked that Peggy even asked something like. “I have to return the other stones, but when I’m finished I’m coming back. For you I’ll only be gone a few seconds. But then we can be together Peggy,” Steve said leaning forward and putting a hand on Peggy’s shoulder.
“First I would suggest getting wipes, and baby powder. You’ll need them later. As well as a trashcan nearby.” Friday’s voice rang out. As she spoke Peter quietly looked up at the ceiling with a wide smile on his face.
“Jesus Christ Steve,” Tony said, scrubbing at his face. “If you would have told me that eight years ago, you would have had me. Hook line and sinker,” Tony muttered. “I was absolutely smitten with you. But we had our differences. And sometimes life doesn’t turn out like we would like it to,” Tony huffed.
The inventor found himself stumbling in between people as he tried to get out into the open. And even though he was free from the group of people watching the movie, he could still hear the damn explosions. Each boom speeding his heart rate up more and more. So he ran. He wasn’t sure where he was going, but he just had to get somewhere safe. Somewhere where he could be alone and just breathe.
And sure, besides returning the stones, Steve had only ever been to space once, but it was nothing like he had expected. Sure some aliens had blue, green, or pink skin, and some had extra eyes, or looked like slug monsters. They were aliens. But the thing Steve was taken back by was that there were aliens that looked very...human. It was surprisingly easy for him to adapt, and in a few weeks Steve was easily blending in with the crowd. The other surprising thing was that alien liquor got him drunk. Like really drunk.
“A father?” Peter asked, a little confused. Tony only nodded, prompting Peter to answer the question. “A father is someone who is related to a child. They share the same DNA...usually,” Peter said as he blinked up at Tony.
“Steve,” the brown haired woman said carefully as she set down her cup. “You can’t just give up the life you created and led, just for me. You don’t belong here. But back there, it sounds like you have a family, people who care for you-”
“There are others that need help though, I’m sure,” Bailey said as she looked down the hall. “I haven't heard much noise from down our hall...but you should check. I know there are a few more cells down that way,” she said, pointing to her left.
3.) I had a general idea about where this fic would go, but I wasn't really sure after about 4/5 chapters worth. Now I have a good idea, but I'm thinking about changing the name of the fic. (Honestly I didn't know what to name it in the first place) Thoughts on this? Please let me know!!
“Oh! The Captain curses,” Tony said in mock shock, pulling a hand over his mouth before laughing. “Look. We all do shitty things, we’re human. And if I said we’re cool, then we’re cool. So get out there and apologize to future me,” Tony says, a smirk on his face.
“Darling,” Tony muttered weakly from his bed, his hand intertwined with Steve’s.
Steve suddenly stopped, his breath catching in his throat as his eyes shot up to Peter. What had he just said?
All of the Avengers were there, of course, since it was a party to thank them all, again, for saving the city. This time little damage had been done to the city, so it really was something to celebrate! The entire team did small photo shoots and interviews in their formal wear before moving to the open bar and dance floor where the rest of the guests were dancing.
“What? Is something wrong?” he asked, anxiety building in his stomach.
So the team collected it all. Normally the group would camp at the base for a few days and then send the files they had found back to Wakanda where T’Challa would keep it safe. From there they would spend a few weeks in Wakanda or Clint's farm to recharge before heading out to the next location.
“Don’t say another word, I’m already on my way,” Pepper reassured. “I’ll be there.”
Once the girls were taken care of, he made sure that the younger kids were doing okay. They were in another part of the wing, and it seemed like Rita and her team were taking care of everything. Tony was quick to make a call to Xavier's school for gifted youngsters about the children, and he was told that they would send a representative to him in the following days.
Steve probably told Tony a little too much information. But at this point in time, Steve had stopped caring about things like that. Right now Tony was sitting cross-legged on the bench, scrubbing at his chin.
“Sounds like a plan for now,” Tony laughed as he pushed his legs over the bed and stood up. “Alright. How about we change your diaper and go get some breakfast!” the man suggested as he began to move towards the door and then down the hall towards Peter’s room.
“We’re back at the compound upstate. But...I went there. Pepper,  they were doing human experiments. There were so many dead woman and children and...I took some back with me and...Pepper,” Tony stammered. “I can’t do this alone. Steve is here with me but I can’t...I can hardly look at him and-”
“Well how are you going to pay for it!?” Steve called out, to which Peter turned to look at his Pops.
“I don’t need an apology Cap. We’ve already done this,” Tony hummed, a small smile on his face. “I forgive you,” Tony said, patting Steve on the shoulder before reaching for the door handle. “Now if you don’t mind, I have a universe to save,” Tony said, giving Steve a smile.
“Yeah...thanks,” Tony said as he watched Clint leave. And then he was alone.
“Don’t be sorry, please.” Tony said, his eyes flickering up to Steve’s. “You’re such a great guy and I’m sorry you’ve been through so much in your life. I’m sure it’s been hard. But you’re still going to do great things. Don’t be sad just because little ol’ me is gone. If anything, I want to you to live because of me,” Tony said as he let go of the door handle and leaned forward so that the two were a few inches away. “Get that life I was telling you about. Be happy. For me, yeah?” Tony said as he reached a hand up, putting it on the back on Steve’s head.
“No Pepper,” Tony interrupted. “Steve...He-he called me...he said he found a HYDRA base where they were doing a breeding program and he found a kid with my DNA. I just got the results back and. God. Pepper, he’s my kid,” Tony said, his breathing picking up in speed.
“Pep,” Tony greeted , his voice coming out hoarse.
Where in God’s name did he even get that?
“Hey. Steve,” Tony said, taking the blonde by his arm. “Don’t cry, come on,” Tony cooed, but Steve just cried harder.
The first stone Steve returned was the Aether. It was the most logical, seeing as he had to also return Thor’s hammer. It was one less thing to carry around with him. And as soon as everything was back in place on Asgard, Steve decided to be a little selfish and do something for himself. He had all the time in the world to return the remaining stones. So he went and saw Peggy.
“It’s about damn time,” Bucky commented to witch all four of them laughed.
“Tony told you about him...about the situation?”
Steve looked tired. His eyes didn’t have that spark that they usually did. Bags were under his eyes but the most notable change was that Steve had a beard. It actually looked good on him, Tony had decided.
“It’s not on me, but I think you could pull off the dress look. I’m sure it fit it with all the fashion trends in the fall,” Tony teased, but Peter just giggled in return. He was oblivious to Tony’s reference.
“I have a team coming, they should be here in a few hours. You can go, I got this,” Tony said quietly.
“You did good,” Pepper said with a kind smile as she put a hand on Tony’s back. And from there, they moved on in silence. They passed another room where Tony saw another family through the window. Tony assumed it was the other girls family, but didn’t want to bother them, so he chose to continue on.  As Tony rounded the corner, he saw that there was a figured asleep on a couch that was in a small waiting room next to the wing that Tony was about to enter.  And who could it be but Steve Rogers.
“I kind of fucked some stuff up at home with Pops,” Peter said with a small shrug and Tony only nodded before leading Peter over to the couch to sit. “And I was getting the ham and noticed the tower was a few blocks away. I wasn’t sure if you were here or not…but I thought I would just stop by and check,” Peter explained with a sheepish smile.
“Is he enhanced like the file says?” Tony said, maybe a little too quickly.
Suddenly Tony didn’t care about the perfect anniversary date that he had worked so hard on. He didn’t care about the angry spectators who’s view he was obscuring. Hell, he didn’t even care about Steve who looked so alarmed as he tried to get Tony’s attention. He just needed out.
“And when can Peter get out of the medical wing?” Tony asked, his arms crossing his chest.
From there the two fell into a comfortable silence of just eating. They stayed like that for a while and Peter seemed to be content with it. Steve simply ate his food as he watched Peter eat his own. When the little boy was finished, Steve got up to take his plate and wash it, but the little boy opened his mouth before he could touch the plate.
And that wasn’t all. Through Sam's digging, Steve had learned that they were in fact running a breeding operation for enhanced individuals. Some girls had gotten pregnant just so the scientists could test on the children while they were still in the womb, while others had become pregnant with certain men’s children. He had read file after file about these women and wondered how in the world HYDRA had gotten their hands on semen, or any DNA from the other subject.
“Wait,” Steve interjected, his voice a little louder than he would have liked it to be. “Stay with me. Just for a few days. You have all the time in the world. Just...stay with me for a bit longer,” Steve said, almost desperate.
“It might. But remember, you’re brave. You got this,” Tony said as he securely took Peter’s wrist in his hand before spreading out his fingers. Tony could feel the tremors that began to shake through the boy’s body but before he could say anything, Steve was already doing so.
“Then that’s all I can ask for,” Tony said and suddenly he was pulling Steve’s head closer to his own. In one swift moment, Tony’s lips were connecting to Steve’s forehead, giving him a sloppy kiss. The two stayed like that for a moment, Tony just humming softly as Steve sat there in shock. “I love you Steve Rogers. Always have. Always will,” Tony breathed as he pulled away. “Now, how many stones do you still have to return?” Tony asked, his tender tone gone.
“Remember, just hug Mr. America tight. He’ll make sure nothing bad happens to you. And since I’m here I’ll protect you to. If Tony hurts you, I’ll beat him up.” Steve said, holding Peter tight so that he couldn’t squirm away from Tony.
“I put in an order when we were on the Jet. I figured our younger guests would like some comfort,” She said and then looked at the other two children. Both were holding dolls. The boy held what looked to be a hulk plushie, and the younger girl was curled around an Ironman doll that was almost as big as her.
Tony immediately thought about how he would get there, and seeing as he was taking additional people from the location, he obviously needed a jet. But a jet would take too long. Tony didn’t know if he could stay sane the entire flight. It was too much time to think, and he needed answers. In the end, the billionaire pinpointed Steve’s location (thanks to F.R.I.D.A.Y.) and set up a jet to meet him there. It had a pilot and medical staff because by the way Steve was talking, they would need some help. After that, he took his suit.
“Yes he is sir, shall I alert him that you are here?” JARVIS asked politely.
“That’s fine,” Steve said as he dug a phone out of his pocket. “Just leave. I’ll take care of this myself,” He said. With that Steve strode towards the door and into the room here all the children resided, leaving Sam alone.
“Safe?” The boy asked. It was only one word but it surprised Steve how articulate the kid seemed.
“Tony,” Steve warned. “The only good time is, well, not a good time. I do something pretty shitty to you, and even though you say we’re on good terms, it’s still hard to believe. I honestly don’t think there is a good time,” Steve admitted.
“Anything else?” Tony asked, hoping the doctor had looked into Peter a little more.
“No,” Peter said honestly as he cleared his throat. What was Steve getting at?
I feel like this chapter is a little clunky and I'm sorry if it doesn't have the normal flow. I honestly wrote the first part a few months ago and then finished the second part this afternoon. Sorry!
------------------------------
“He- He tried to kill me,” Tony then blurted out. His head tilted up and he gave the most broken look Steve had ever seen. “He tried to kill me Steve. He was going to. He shoved that god damned shield into my reactor. And if I would have pushed any harder, he would have done it,” Tony cried.
“That may be what your Tony needed, but I don’t want that. I want you. All I have ever thought of was you. Stay. Please. Just for tonight,” Tony begged. Steve sat there for a moment, his mind whirling.
“Thank you Tony,” Steve said as that small smile came back on his face.
“Look…Pops! I-I’m sorry. I didn’t see the ham when I was putting things away I-I’m sorry.” Peter said, trying to remember if there was actually a ham in the bag of food earlier this morning.
“Alright, well, I’ll just give you him then,” Tony said as he began to peel Peter away from him. “Let me know if you find anything serious, or if you need me. I’ll be back when I can,” Tony said.
Tony could feel it getting worse and worse, and his eyes flickered up to see more and more colorful explosions across the sky. The rational part of his brain was trying to tell him that he was safe, and everything was fine. He was going to be okay, he just had to wait it out. -- The other part of his brain though, was screaming at him to run. And hearing the concern in his husband's voice was enough to convince him that he needed to get out of there.
God. Little Peter just gets to me so much.  I can't stand how cute he is.
Steve looked at Sam for a long moment before looking back down at the folder in his hand. The picture on the front was of the little boy named Peter, and Steve’s interest grew. So he opened it up, and read carefully.
“No,” Peter whined as he clung to Tony like a vice. “Stay with me please. Don’t leave me alone,” Peter howled.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it,” Peter huffed as he closed the door so he could get dressed with a bit of privacy.  After pulling on his jeans, Peter grabbed his Stark-phone and looked up the number to their local super-market before calling them. And low and behold, they were going to be open for another forty-five minutes.
They had arrived back in New York about two hours ago. And while that meant rest for the others, Tony had work to do. The inventor was quick to get the two mothers-to-be settled. He made sure they were comfortable and had sent up appointments with the on-call doctor to get a report on the girls and their children. From there Tony had collected the girls family information. He was going to make the call to the parents, but Steve stopped him.
“Is this seat taken?” A man asked as Steve sat on a bench, looking out over the largest of the reservoirs in the park.  He’d been sketching the water with the buildings looming in the background. And he was too engrossed in his work to really look up at the man, but he wasn’t rude.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to update, but my life has been a big mess with little to no time to write. I apologize.
Tony did his best to ignore the fluttering feeling that he felt in his chest, as well as the way Pepper grinned from ear to ear.
“Well next time, instead of just standing there and watching me sleep, you can just wake me up. I won’t get mad, okay? And there will be less screaming on my end,” Tony said, a small smile pulling on the edge of his lips.
spend it with Dad. And if Pops had anything to say against it…then he was just a big fat cotton-headed ninny-muggins.
In the golden sunlight Tony could only think of how important Peter had become to him in such a short time. Tony had been in kind of a dark spot in his life...but Peter was like then sunshine. He was there to make it better. Brighter. The elder Stark wished he could stay like that forever, just the two of them sharing that moment. But after a while the little boy’s eyes lazily opened.
Tony stood over the bed, watching as Peter’s chest steadily rose and fell with each breath. He was here. He was going to be okay. Nothing bad was going to happen to him.
The warm golden light of the sun hit Peter’s round cheeks and highlighted his brown hair, making it look almost golden. And from where Tony lay, he could still see the rise and fall of Peter’s body as he took in long breaths. And...was that snoring? It was soft and scratchy, but definitely there.
“What cha’ bet their going to go fuck,” Clint asked with a grin as he took a drink of his gin.
“You never saw me when I was a baby,” Tony shot back, though he too had a smile on his face.
With that Steve walked back into the communal living area and picked up the large folder that had the kid’s picture on it.
“You should get some rest Cap. Your room is still where you left it,” Tony said as he tried to wave the blonde off. If
“Hey Peter. Is it okay if I hold you?” Steve asked, putting a large hand on the boy’s arm. “Just for a little bit.”
“Tony didn’t hurt you Peter,” Steve soothed. “He’s just trying to help you. He even told you it might hurt,” Steve hummed. “C’mon, just hold on to me and it won’t hurt in a minute,” Steve prompted.
“Please!” the little boy said when Tony had not said anything.
Okay, so it was going to be diapers.
(See the end of the chapter for
After the bath Tony had toweled Peter off before putting on a diaper. He still had no idea whether or not Peter was potty trained, but he was too tired to ask and he didn’t want to deal with an accident in a new bed. From there the two ventured into Peter’s bedroom where they went through the closet and dresser. There were a few outfits that Pepper had supplied, but none were suitable for sleeping. Tony assumed she had it on her list of things to get, but he would remind her, just in case. - Right. He still needed to do that.
“No?” the little boy said in confusion as he looked over at the toilet.
“Wait,” Steve said in shock as he leaned forward towards Peter. “You even know about Bucky?” Steve asked. Peter shrank back a little more and his eyes went back to his lap as he began to grab at his own fingers with nervous energy.
“Well...at…at least let me go with you,” Steve called.
Tony followed close behind as they made their way inside the room. They walked into what looked like a large communal living room with many couches and end tables, followed by a kitchen, and soon they were walking down a connecting hall. Steve opened the first door and motioned for Tony to walk in first.
“Don’t leave me. Please,” Tony said, gripping Steve’s shirt. “Pepper is gone, the team is gone, I’m so alone and I don’t think I’ll get through the night by myself,” Tony said, his voice cracking in desperation.
“It’s because you look like crap,” Pepper blurted out.
“We’re going to go see Rita now, okay? She’s going to give you a bath and change your clothes and make sure you’re insides are all okay. And when she’s done I’ll see you again. Deal?” Tony said as he walked out of the room with Peter and down the hall.
“Okay,” Peter said as a sleepy smile appeared on his face as well. The two layed there in silence for a long moment before Peter’s small voice spoke up again. “G’night daddy,” Peter said, his eyes almost all the way closed. “I love you.”
------
“Yeah well....I was going to get some rest but Peter was having a hard time being away from Tony so I stayed with him for a few hours till he fell asleep.” Steve explained.
Tony slowly opened the door and peeked his head inside as he looked around the room. It looked like an ordinary station that a park ranger would stay in. It was dark, though, and Tony used the gauntlet as a light as he helt his hand in front of him. As he moved further into the darkness, though, he heard a sound to his left and quickly shifted over, gauntlet ready to fire.
. Do you know what that means?” Steve asked before biting down on his lip, still trying to keep his cool. It took the sick boy a moment, but things seemed to click.
“Morning daddy!” Peter replied back as he pushed himself up onto his knees, rubbing his face with small fists to get the sleep out of his eyes. “And yeah I did. I like your bed better than mine though. It’s nice and hard.”
“Everything?”
“You go it mostly right,” Steve chuckled as he began to eat the overly cooked breakfast.
“I’m sorry,” Tony interjected again. “I don’t know what happened. I've never freaked out like that with fireworks. I’ve been fine I just...I heard the noise and didn’t know where it was coming from and suddenly I was back in Afghanistan and fighting and-”
“I will, in a little bit. There were some teenage girls that we found too. I contacted their parents when we got back here and they just arrived about an hour ago. I’m just going to get some extra pillows and blankets from the guest rooms...they want to be with their daughters after all.” Steve explained.
The little boy was a little wary when Pepper pulled out the scissors but Tony was quick to distract him. After one quick Google search for “popular children’s cartoons” Tony decided on the show
There were only two candidates for which kid could be his, but Tony already knew it was the kid on the couch. He wanted to go over there. He wanted to wake the kid and just look at him. He seemed to be the age where children could talk. Not well, but they could. Was this kid even developed enough that he could speak? Tony wanted to do so much, but the image of the kid sleeping stopped him. He wouldn’t disturb him. Not that face. So Tony opted to just staring at him from afar.
“Well,” She said, taking a deep breath. “I have a few things, but the most important one is that Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters will be coming today. I received a call from their office an hour ago so they should be here soon. They would like to meet with you and the girls that were kept...at that place. I think they are also evaluating the other two children,” Pepper said as she watched Peter eat from the corner of her eye.
“You decided to join the facial hair club?” Tony said as he approached, and Steve lifted his head slightly. As soon as he saw Tony, a tired smile spread across his face. It was small, but it was there. And as soon as it appeared on his face, the smile seemed to fade. It seemed Steve as dealing with some mixed emotions as well.
He waited till he was alone before he looked at the file. He waited till he had F.R.I.D.A.Y. running on HYDRA’s system before he opened it. He waited till he was seated before he finally sat down and opened the thing.
The conversation that he and Steve had had on the Jet came rushing back to him, and all Tony could do was think about what they had discussed. Tony was a father, but he couldn’t be a dad. He wasn’t sure about where to go from there, but he concluded that Peter would stay with him for the time being. He would set up a room for him, and get him settled. He would take him to the doctors he needed to see, and make sure that he was healthy. But if something came up, he needed to have a backup plan ready.
“I could stay with Peter,’ a voice suddenly called out and the three looked up to see Steve Rogers standing at the threshold of the room. It was clear that his presence had taken them by surprise and the solder cracked a sheepish smile as he took a step closer. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to sneak up on everyone. I just came in for breakfast and couldn't help but hear your conversation.” -- Tony blinked a few times as he looked at Steve. He was trying to process if that was actually a good idea, but before he could say anything someone else spoke up.
“Hey JARVIS,” Peter hummed gently. It felt good to be in the tower. He hadn’t been there in a little less than a month. “Is my dad here?” Peter asked as he moved towards the private elevator towards the back of the room.
As he walked further and further down the lane, Peter started to wonder if all the hams had been taken, but at the last cooler, there seemed to be a surplus of them. Good.  Peter looked around in the bin for a moment, trying to find the perfect ham. After selecting it, he slowly moved towards the checkout counter. All of this walking was really starting to wear him out.
“Merry Christmas Dad,” He said, hugging Tony one last time
“You got it!”
“I love you too,” Steve said, a smile on his face. “Now get some rest okay? I’ll be here when you wake up,” Steve said, leaning forward and giving Tony a kiss on his forehead.
“Good morning Petey,” Tony said as a broad smile spread across his face. “Did you sleep okay?” asked.
“Lay it on me,” Tony commanded.
