After all the planning and going through the details again Tony still didn’t feel a hundred percent ready or sure but that was just who he was. Clint had risked a lot to test the waters. Out of respect for him he would try.
“Pleasure’s all mine,” James said, lifting his glass to his lips, his eyes sliding to Clint as they had at every available moment all night. Clint looked amazing tonight and James honestly couldn’t wait to get home and appreciate him. “I do, however, have a favor to ask.”
“What a silly question. When you’re in love you know it.” She shook her head. Tony was not happy with her answer and she knew it. “Fine, I’ll play along.” She turned to face him, sitting less gracefully now. “Imagine ya boilin’ water for potatoes. How do ya know when the water’s hot enough?”
Downstairs he did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen. It was familiar work and for once he enjoyed doing it. He was adjusting the table cloth when Sarah came back to the kitchen.
“So back to staying here… for an extended time? Because that won’t work. We have a dog,” James said. He knew Dmitri could tend to Lucky but Dmitri was already pulling more than his fair share since James had once again stepped away from the main duties of the business, giving Dmitri more responsibility. He also knew that Maria was dying to have Lucky, and Natalia was more than happy as well for him to come but he knew Lucky was one of the only other things that made Clint happy.
Steve watched Tony and chuckled, catching his eye, a smirk on his face. Steve went to stand right beside him, not to make matters worse, but because he’d spent too long not able to decide how close he was going to be to Tony. Now that freedom to be as close to him as he wanted was his and he was going to take advantage.
“You can say that again,” Val agreed, plopping down beside him on the couch and closing her eyes. “Whose turn is it to make food?”
James looked up at Steve and then over at Bakuto who was bleeding all over the concrete floor from where he sat tied up in a metal chair. They were keeping him in the same place they had kept Howard, the abandoned fifth floor in James’ hospital that he had converted into his own interrogation ward. No one who came to the fifth floor as a captive ever left alive and the same fate would befall Bakuto. Unfortunately, he was still useful.
“Oh,” Clint said, waving away James’ worries. “You have an appearance to maintain. I understand that, sweetheart.” He leaned over and pressed a kiss to James’ lips.
“Natalia,” James said, his tone firm, “stay here.” She glared at him but finally gave in, realizing that his command was not coming from a place of underestimation but rather one of him wanting to keep her safe. She didn’t agree, but she could respect it.
As quietly as possible he headed out to the room in which Dugan was resting. After knocking, Tony entered without waiting for an answer.
“Can barely feckin’ piss on my own,” he grumbled under his breath, dragging a hand down his face. He wasn’t mad at Tony and he needed to make that clear to him when he came out of the bathroom.
it? “And Bucky helped a little with the dessert but otherwise it’s all me.”
“Please?” Benni asked again and the way he said it broke Tony’s heart.
“I’m the floozy? You could barely keep your clothes on the first time you met James.”
“He and I—we’re—before.” He stopped. He hated it when he rambled and stammered, a habit he’d mostly grown out of. He closed his eyes and took a breath, in and out, deeply. “James and I aren’t together. Haven’t been for years.” That was the most he could say at the moment, his eyes dropping again to his lap, hands balling into fists.
Against his better judgement and being impossibly quiet, Steve moved in further and pulled the blanket up over his shoulders but Tony woke immediately, sitting up as soon as his eyes were open.
“Isn’t it though, you feckin’ gobshite?” James glared. “As I recall,
He licked his lips that were bright pink and swollen from the kisses and then blinked a few times to get his thoughts in order. “I have some work to do with OFI after my shift. I don’t know how long I’ll be. I didn’t want to promise you a time and then have to cancel.”
.” He slid his hands into Steve’s shirt as much as he could from this angle, his hands resting on Steve’s tense shoulders.
“—ain’t nothing or nobody changing that, okay? No matter how handsome he may be. And in any case, James loves you too.”
“And your ma would be right. You work too much.” He gently pulled the top blanket to the middle between Steve and him. “Do you know what happens to boys who refuse to sleep?” Tony asked with a smile. “They’ll get sleepy, so
“You know just… the privacy.”
Downstairs he could hear Sarah and Steve talk and it made Tony tense. When he entered Steve looked ready to head out which meant he’d leave Sarah, Tony and Benni alone at breakfast. Steve turned around and greeted them as he always did, winking at Tony quickly and leaving the kitchen with big and fast steps.
“Mr Rogers, sir, I know Dugan just hung up but you wanted to know when Howard was out for the day. That would also be today, sir.”
“I’m sorry about that, Tony. I’m happy you can start up again.” He hesitated but figured he’d rather keep Tony talking for a bit than avoid seeing the face Tony was sure to make at the mention of the new clothes. “What did you get up to today?”
“Of course,” he said, “you’ve given me no reason not to. What do you mean about keeping this up?”
Steve sighed. “I don’t know. He went back to Russia. Don’t know where or even how long for.” Sarah squeezed his hands. “I miss him something awful and I still… I feel terrible I couldn’t—“
A few rooms down, Clint was sitting on his cot, one knee pulled up to his chest, the other dangling off the end. He was staring at the door, trying to notice the changes of light beneath it. It was his only indication of anything happening outside. He pulled the blanket around his shoulders tighter, feeling a cool breeze.
Steve looked at his mother, a question on his face but she shook her head and he sighed.
Clint all but collapsed on the ground beside Tony, his movements graceless but he was sure Natalia would forgive him. He wasn’t even sure why he was thinking about that. Maybe he just missed her.
Steve shrugged, as if none of that worried him and honestly it didn’t. He would let Tony take O’Shea’s office space but he didn’t
Sarah was already in the kitchen when Tony and Benni got there. The room was filled with delicious and mouth-watering smells and the dining table was absolutely beautiful and enormous compared to what Tony had seen.
Steve sighed, the first thought running through his head that that wasn’t entirely fair but he quickly dismissed it.
What did Tony ever do to deserve this? To deserve this kindness? And why did he have to wait and suffer so much?
“It’s not like he asked you to marry him, Steve. When?” Bucky asked.

For a split second Tony wanted to asked about Steve’s body count. If he ever took real pleasure in it. But one look at the man and he knew he didn’t. No one with a heart as soft as Steve’s could enjoy that kind of thing.
“But first, can I get a coffee?”
“Steve was just trying to get that bird’s attention, Mr Reynolds’ daughter. Who knew throwing a brick at glass would break it?”
“Ask her yourself,” he said, indicating with his chin towards the door and Clint turned to see his favorite girl leaning there with a smile and watery eyes. She came over quickly and bent to press kisses to Clint’s face.
“Know what?”
Steve smiled and then he and James quickly and silently incapacitated the two men who stood guard behind the house while Dmitri picked the lock and Dugan slipped inside to check for any other security measures like alarm systems or trip wires—Loki seemed the type to have something like that in his home.
After a moment Clint pulled back and James leaned in to press one last sweet kiss to his cheek.
It all happened so fast that Tony didn’t quite know if it was real or not. It was overwhelming and too good to be true, wasn’t it? One moment he was clinging to Clint and the next there was Steve. Steve!
“I’ll snack all I want, you’re not my ma,” Steve said, moving out of Tony’s reach and opening the oven to pull one of the chickens out. “James, chicken?”
“So don’t make me move too much. Steve, come on. You can’t just say those things and then behave!” Even though he was frustrated that things weren’t happening, he couldn’t help but fall even more for this considerate and caring person that Steve was for him. “
Steve nudged Brock with his foot. “I do not like being blackmailed.”
“What?”
Tony listened and watched, repeating every word in his head Steve had said about him, leaning into Steve’s touch. He let go of Steve’s hand to move closer and wrap his arms around Steve’s neck, sitting on his lap. “Who you are and what you do are two different things,” he said and kissed him passionately. “I love you too, Steve.” He kissed him again.
Tonight it would be steak, potatoes, and broccoli. James turned his back to Clint, preparing the steak and turning on the oven.
“You’re all red in the face,” James said, laughing. “Your Irish is showing.”
“He went out to do some shopping with ma, why? What’s—”
“It used to but only, and I mean
Jones was standing outside the huge doors and when he caught sight of Tony, his expression softened. He scanned him quickly and padded him down, searching for any kind of weapons. The boy flinched and Jones didn’t appreciate that reaction.
it. But he also knew that he could be this way in front of these two people and they would never judge him.

“That one,” Rhodey said, pointing to the third combination. “I don’t ever want to see you wearing this,” he continued, pointing to the conservative look, “and this feels like you stole it from a porn set.”
James nodded.
“Uh, Rhodey, you gotta promise not to kill me before I tell you whose apartment I broke into.”
“Why shouldn’t I be smiling? Look at where I am and who I’m with. I mean you right now but I also mean Steve. Have you seen how big Benni has gotten? And he’s just starting to grow.” He shook his head and got up to top up his coffee. This had been the longest that they had gone without an incident, without danger, or either one of them needing to heal. Clint still had some ways to go but nowadays he was able to reduce the pain medication to a minimum and not look miserable whenever something accidentally brushed against his cast.
“Not so hard, huh?”
Natalia nodded and disappeared.
“You,” he said, sitting down in his chair after having removed his jacket. He was still in the shirt, not planning on changing anytime soon. “Already have a job to do, don’tcha, Dugan?” He wasn’t looking up, instead he was focused on the reports Tony was placing in front of him, running the numbers through his head and comparing them to what he remembered from last month’s. He may not have been a math whiz but he had a mind like a steel trap, few things ever slipped his memory.
“Coffee sounds great and I’ve been dying to try yours. Sarah was telling me all about it the other day,” Clint said. The comfort he felt there with Tony was almost making him want to nap. “And yeah, finally got myself all cleaned up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Something in him, despite having no younger siblings of his own, had come alive in Tony’s presence. If Tony wasn’t actually who he said he was, if it was all just a very well-played act, Clint would feel like an idiot for wasting his food. If not, he would feel like a monster for not at least trying to share.
“You were supposed to bite the grape out of my mouth, love,” Steve explained, that same goofy grin on his face. He’d been drifting between the first two Steves the last couple of minutes. He hadn’t fully gotten to dirty Steve, at least not to the extent that James remembered it. “Here, try this one,” he said, a piece of orange half in his mouth. He turned to Tony expectantly.
“Edward Stark. Delivering sandwiches for Mr Dugan and Mr Rogers,” he said quickly and the men opened the door for him, telling him where he needed to go—inside and then to the kitchen and from there to the dining area, set the sandwiches down on the table in there—and so he went.
“Which is exactly why I say this one. It’s close but not that close. We have no idea how long they drove for.”
“I’ve still got thirty minutes,” he said softly, his arms around Tony tightening as he hugged him. “We can finish eating. Haven’t seen you all morning.”
Calm. No, Tony wasn’t calm. His heart was beating faster. Racing. His whole body felt warm, the fluttering was back.
James got Clint situated in his chair at the table, pressed a kiss to the back of his head, and said, “I’ll be back, just going to get dressed and talk to Steve.”
“Aw, come on, Rhodes, he’s just my type!”
“Not longer than usual. What about you?”
Putting cheese on each portion he added the finishing touch, set a plate down in front of each one of them, and poured those who wanted one a glass of red wine.
“Alright. I just wanted to hear you say it. It’s is a big commitment to spend weeks away with only one person.”
Together they headed to the basement once Steve was done for the day. They entered the passage and Tony stopped him once the door was closed behind them. He was glad to see that Steve seemed to have planned the same thing as him, closing the gap between them and kissing Tony passionately. Even though Tony had the same thing in mind, he still let out a small surprised sound into the kiss.
Clint hummed as he held James and James felt his eyes getting heavy. He blinked a few times, about to close them when Clint’s humming turned to singing.
When they finally made it back to the house, Natalia was confused. They should have dropped her and Maria off first and then made the way out to Brooklyn. It made the most sense.
“When you’re done pretending to read, I have a question for you.”
Steve went straight to Tony, wrapping his arms around his waist from behind and bending to press a kiss to his head, looking into the oven.
“Yeah, Pinky’s a good cause to give back to,” he said instead. “Fine fella, trustworthy just… not cut out for my line of work.”
“Next visit?” He asked, unable to stop looking at Steve despite the fact that the man was not doing anything. His presence simply demanded respect and attention.
James greeted him inside once they had passed through security, patting his shoulder.
“Yes, thank you.” The man poured James a cup and James as well tapped two fingers to the table, not wanting to disrespect the person from whom he needed information.
“When it’s boiling, obviously.”
Clint wondered, because he’d never thought to ask, what it was like on Christmas day for everyone. He and Tony wouldn’t have even known which day
“Cap,” Jones called as he turned to leave. He stopped in the doorway. “Might want to change your tie.” He looked down, it was sprinkled with blood. Cap winked at Jones and headed out.
he knew that he wasn’t alone the entire time but before he thought he would die alone in that small concrete room. He remembered wondering how long he could go without food, especially when he began to notice his weight dropping. He remembered wondering if he wasn’t being held ransom but rather was just being held to die a slow and agonizing death as he starved.
“I’m older than you,” she reminded him.
. Will you come with?”
Steve smiled and then turned to Rhodey. “You’re exempt, obviously.” He turned to Bucky who looked at his guys from squad who had all also been yelling and carrying on.
James had insisted on getting in bed, asking if it wouldn’t be more comfortable for Clint but he wanted the living room, saying it was his favorite room and he had really missed the fireplace.
“Tony,” Steve said reassuringly, “sit. It’s alright. Mary,” he finished his directions to her in Gaelic and she looked surprised but did as she was told and promptly left. Steve took out what he needed and gently worked on one of Tony’s other visible wounds. “My ma worked as a nurse up until a few years back, taught me a thing or two,” he said, smiling fondly. He reached for Tony’s shirt and again waited for permission.
Clint snorted softly, leaning his head against the wall. He was so hungry it was making him lightheaded and nauseous, and now the only person he had to talk to wasn’t very friendly. Wonderful.
Steve indicated with two fingers for Dmitri and Dugan to sweep and re-secure the building and the perimeter and they immediately headed off.
Steve stood over him, arms crossed, watching the papers he went between, trying to understand. He’d never seen Tony so focused, seeming to process whatever it was he was doing quite quickly. Tony had never mentioned any special skills, mathematical or otherwise, which meant—judging by what he was seeing on the notepad—that either he was just being his extremely modest self or Howard had discouraged him so much he didn’t even realize he was gifted. It was likely a combination of the two.
“You think someone’ll try and kill you again,” she said, having to say the words out loud at least once to get it out of her system, so she could think clearly.
He helped Steve up. The past few weeks he had worked a lot and it made Tony’s heart ache if he was completely honest.
When Steve pulled away Tony was flooded by a wave of emotions and questions. Had he done something wrong? Why did he stop? Was he already regretting it?
Clint reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand again. He squeezed it tightly and then relaxed. “Yes. I’ll survive. You get out there and you bring back our scary fellas, okay?” Clint was terrified but hiding it under a gentle smile and a joke like he always did. No matter how scared he was, though, he knew he wouldn’t be able to live with himself or look Steve, Sarah, or Tony’s little brother in the eye if they switched roles.
Since the other man couldn’t hear him and there was no light, which meant he couldn’t read his lips either, Tony got up and slowly walked to the other mattress and found Clint’s arm. Despite him flinching and pulling his arm back, Tony stayed calm. He waited a few seconds and reached out his hand to touch Clint’s shoulder. By now he must have realized that it was Tony and not someone else.
get it all out. I’m here,” she told him, pressing a kiss to his hair again. “I’ve got you.”
He wrapped his arms around Clint’s shoulders as well as he could from the angle and rested his head on top of Clint’s, closing his eyes. He let out a deep sigh, rocking ever so gently with Clint against his chest.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Tony, just let me forget how fucked up I am for a few minutes,
She wasn’t as rough with Steve, James had noticed. At first, he assumed it was because she didn’t know him so she was being polite. Then he remembered who Natalia was and quickly dismissed that. Next he thought that maybe her roughness with James was because she was angry with him. Maybe she blamed him for Clint’s predicament.
,” Sarah said comfortingly. “You did everything you could and then some to keep him safe and he is now. The times when he wasn’t weren’t because you did anything wrong.”
Lucky’s head lifted, one ear raised, and then he was on his feet, tail wagging, as he went to greet his other dad.
“Clint hasn’t been back here since he’s been home. I assumed it would have been the first place he’d come to once—this is where they took him,” James realized much too late. He’d always known they’d taken him from the bar but it hadn’t clicked until now that that was why Phil was still in charge around here and Clint hadn’t so much as come to say hi to anyone.
The only consolation to be found, although incredibly small, was that it didn’t seem that Bakuto or his men had touched Clint or Tony prior to taking the photos. The bruising was fresh, not dark enough yet, and the blood seemed to still be flowing, not dried and stuck to them. So Bakuto had told the truth. He would keep them until he got what he wanted.
There was also the option that Clint had been out for a couple hours and it was dark now but he didn’t much like that option. He wasn’t ready to not know the day and time just yet. Or maybe that was better. Maybe it would keep him focused on escaping rather than how much time had passed.
“Yes and no,” she said, a mischievous smile on her face. James and Steve waited patiently for her answer. “I think perhaps you should stay here awhile.”
Clint shrugged. “Yeah, a little tired but otherwise okay.”
“Well, for starters, you’re
“Did Clint say if he was coming back?”
“Expensive suit, well built, Asian. Wait,” she paused and James heard the receiver set down on something as Natalia moved closer to inspect the body. She pushed up a sleeve and saw a tattoo. “James?”
Tony looked to the woman and then back to Mr Rogers, slowly rolling up his sleeve and offering the bandaged arm for whatever they wanted to do. He felt weak, vulnerable, disgusting. Even in the basement alone with two others he felt like the whole world could see his weakness. Tony closed his eyes and let them unwrap his arm and inspect the blisters. The air on his skin seemed to hurt just as much as the gentle touches and the cool ointment that was applied. It took some effort but Tony didn’t flinch or pull his arm away. And when the bandages were back on, the woman looked at him expectedly. At first Tony didn’t quite understand and when he did, he jumped up.
Steve dropped his head, stared at his hands in his lap. His stomach churned anxiously at the thought of everything Tony might be going through. “I worry about Tony getting enough sleep. It’s taken almost a year to get him to sleep six hours a night. I doubt he’s closing his eyes at all now.”
“No, love,” he said, more gentle than he’d been in a few days. “The money. It’s for you. I started saving it a few months back. Before you came to stay. I was trying to keep it under the radar long enough to give it a name on May 29th: Antonio Stark.”
When they left, James turned to Tony and Sarah. “Something’s wrong and they don’t know what.”
.” He kissed his brother’s forehead and smiled. It was only then that he noticed the woman in the room. Even if Steve hadn't told him his mother would come he would have recognized her as his mother. There was no question where he got it all from.
Rhodey dragged a hand down his face and started walking, Tony following beside him out to the front drive and away from his workmates. “No. He’s not gay. Tony, man, please, just… don’t make my work life awkward.”
,” Steve said softly.
“I learned to play cards,” Benni announced quite proudly and looked at the two of them for approval.
“Howard, my father, twisted my arm behind my back. He hurt my wrist pretty bad. The swelling is down but it hurts,” Tony explained and as soon as he was done speaking he looked at a spot on the desk instead. He didn’t give unnecessary details, thinking they weren’t exactly important. “If you’re angry I brought her with me, I’m sorry. I didn’t want to cancel your order because of this.”
“I don’t want a big brother,” Tony stated and shook his head. Why did this bother him as much as it did? Did it matter if he was his big brother or friend? That thought made him shiver. He wanted neither. Couldn’t it simply be Tony and Steve? Not anyone’s brother or the kid who got hurt and needed saving. Just Tony who worked with him. Who Steve was so comfortable around that he fell asleep next to him? Trusted him?
“If you don’t know the answer by now we’re going to get your eyes checked.”
“First of all, I never said I
“Sure do, little buddy. Sign language. Heard of it?” Benni shook his head no and Clint lifted his hands and signed ‘This is ASL,’ explaining what he had said.
… scared.” He looked back at him and explained the whole ordeal: the guy, the letters, the threats, yesterday morning.
“Steve, c’mon. Sarah is waiting. And so is breakfast.” Tony spoke hurriedly and rushed out of the room to his bathroom, locking the door and sliding down behind it.
“Tony,” Clint said, his throat hoarse and he could tell that his voice had cracked on the word. Clint squinted, looking for the subtle rise and fall of Tony’s body to indicate that he was breathing. It was still too dark in the room, so he gently pressed a finger to a seemingly uninjured area on his neck and almost passed out from relief when he felt a pulse.
?” She asked Tony who was still standing there.
James raised an eyebrow. “If he’s causing you so much grief, why not do it yourself?” James added, “Why do you even care?”
Even though he didn’t receive an answer, he was content. Thanks to Sarah he didn’t have to worry too much about his brother but there were still the occasional moments when they clashed because they were brothers after all.
“Everything alright?” James asked, sliding into the driver’s seat. It had been a while since he’d driven himself but with everything that had happened, he wasn’t afraid of anyone getting any smart ideas about targeting his car. Plus, Dmitri was busy.
brave. It was such a large part of what James liked about him. Sure, he was afraid of things but he didn’t let that stop him.
“Yes, go ahead.”
James had spent the last few weeks asking around about purchasing a plane of his own. The first few people he had called had laughed and James had quickly silenced them by throwing out a few figures he found not only entirely possible to pay but also had called them ‘a bargain.’ He’d enjoyed listening to the sudden silence on the other end of the phone and then the subsequent stammering until they let him know that they weren’t actually able to sell him a commercial plane.
“No. Would I like it? Yes,” Steve said, his eyes closed as he rubbed his temple, a headache blossoming. “I just wanna do right by him.”
Tony’s heart sped up as the words sunk in. “Even if we have a plan, we can’t plan for the weather. Or locked doors. Guards! What about where we are and how we get away from here? They’re going to notice that we’re gone and they’ll come after us immediately.”
“Tony,” he tried again, just desperate to see him actually communicate and show signs that he could talk and think and wasn’t beat into a coma.
Steve knew he wasn’t happy with that answer. He could see the worry in his face. Tony wasn’t hard to read once you got used to his expressions and mannerisms but Steve knew nothing he could say would change how he felt. He’d have to see Sarah’s reaction for himself.
He came over as quickly as his cast would allow him, especially since he was disregarding the doctor’s orders to use his crutches.
“My name is Tony,” he answered, just as quietly. Maybe Clint knew something he didn’t know and it was better to keep quiet.
“I’m sorry,” James said, his voice quieter because he did not want Clint to hear it break. He knew how Clint could be, worrying more about others than he did himself. James loved that about him but not right now. “I’m so sorry, Clint. I’m sorry I wasn’t there—”
Steve and James locked gazes for a long moment. It felt like an eternity to the other three who weren’t a part of their telepathic communication and then finally Steve stood.
“I can tell Tony these things. I know I can but I never would. He has a tendency to hold on to them and I can see it in his behavior and how often he… disconnects from what’s going on around him. He just keeps thinking about it and I know it hurts him more than it helps,” Steve explained. And that wasn’t to say that he wouldn’t tell Tony but not every thought and feeling that passed through him needed to be voiced aloud; he knew that, for the most part, they were irrational. “All that being said, I think you should tell Clint. All of it.”
Steve knocked on the door and Dmitri opened it, nodding politely to Steve and giving Dugan a small smile.
“Howard should have gotten into trouble. Just because kissing is disgusting you shouldn’t!”
James said, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. “So since we’re up, breakfast?”
“Not this time,” James said, turning to him slowly. He saw the sigh of relief leave his body. “But if anything happens, that will change.”
“I was waiting for the right moment.”
Dugan came in with a tray of food and gave Tony a sincere smile. It was so good to see him again. He even filled a glass of water for Tony to drink and then he was gone again, leaving Steve and him alone. In front of him was a bowl of soup, a bread roll, and some butter. If he never saw bread again it would still be too soon.
Steve watched everyone at his table, content with where his life was at the moment despite his doubts and troubles. Surrounded by the people he loved most and Clint who he was warming up to, Steve felt at peace. He turned and pressed a kiss to Tony’s head for no reason other than he could, smiling at him.
It was early, very early. Benni and Sarah had gotten up to say goodbye to them and chat while Steve and Tony gathered their things and brought them downstairs. Now they were in the car on their way to Manhattan Cruise Terminal to catch their ship.
James nodded instead of saying anything and Phil left, closing the door behind him.
“I have no idea,” he said and shook his head. “I’ll go check on him.”
“Shut up, ya jerk.”
“Yeah, lad, that’s what the idea was here,” he said, chuckling and wincing. “How’s Cap? And you?”
He cleaned Tony off and then put his underwear back on him, crawling onto the bed beside him. He lifted him easily again to pull the blanket from underneath him to cover them both up. Steve propped himself up on his elbow and stared down at Tony.
Tony looked at the door, hoping that they would bring more food any minute now. Or at least water. He was parched.
was excited and he hoped Tony was too.
She came back over to where he was standing, looking up at one of the maps they had hung on the wall. So far they had managed to cross off two locations and still had three more to go.
Tony helped around with some files after lunch, burning some that needed to be destroyed and reorganizing the others. It was easy work but it kept Tony somewhat busy from staring at Steve and thinking about him in the most inappropriate ways. Steve kept his normal unreadable face throughout the day but Tony started seeing nuances in his face.
“Sorry, you just scared me there,” he said as he sat down, facing Steve.
“I’m not going around telling people about ya, Tony. I’m asking as your friend.” She poked his arm and rolled her eyes.
Lucky propped himself up on his hind legs and rested his front legs across Clint’s lap, scratching at him and whining worriedly.
“It’s not done for me. You keep doing it,” he said and felt his ears burn at his own words but he managed to keep looking him in his beautiful eyes. “Will you at least let me help around? Your mom is adamant that I laze about.”
Steve maintained his composure despite really not expecting that question. “In a secure location.”
“Worse. Am I dying?” James asked and Clint snorted, pressing a kiss to his dark hair. “Thank you,” he said quietly, closing his eyes. James often forgot that he needed this. It had been so long since he had had someone in his life to provide it. Sarah rose to the occasion sometimes but she wasn’t always around and she had a son. Before he’d gone off to war, it had been Steve and before Steve it had been Anna, James’ sister.
Steve sighed again. He knew getting frustrated wasn’t going to help anyone. The sooner they were out of the city, the better. He, too, was in dire need of some rest and relaxation.
He was thrown carelessly into what felt like a van. He didn’t try to run nor did he kick and scream. He knew none of that would do him any good. Instead he remained silent and tried to figure out where they were going.
Slowly, very slowly, Tony lifted his shirt. Unable to pull it off by himself, Mr Rogers helped him. There he was, in his undershirt in front of a man he didn’t even know on a first name basis. His heart was beating out of his chest and he couldn’t keep his eyes open as the undershirt was stripped from his upper body as well.
Steve was so close to dosing but he instead dragged himself out of bed to clean them up and once that was done, he flopped back down beside Tony, his head on Tony’s chest, ear right on his heart, and he was out like a light, snoring softly.
“No, you don’t, Jones.”
“Sure as hell do. In fact, he’s one of my top suspects. Got a problem with that?”
, Steve thought to himself. He would regret this until the day he died.
“Yeah,” he mumbled, trying to regain some composure if he even had such a thing to begin with. “You said bring back anything I deemed worthy. Thought we might as well use the food that’s still useable.” He pointed to the wheel of cheese the men were unpacking. “It’s more than enough.”
“You always known?”
He missed Steve more than he thought was possible. Not being with him left him feeling hollow and empty. What if he never got to see him again? What if this was it? What if Steve didn’t find the dog tags? What if they decided to kill Tony? What if he never got to see Sarah or Benni ever again? There was also Dugan, Jones, and Pepper. James and Dmitri, too. There were so many people in his life he wanted to see again.
“I’m sorry.”
“That would be nice. Thank you,” he told James and kissed Steve’s cheek. Once they were gone, he turned to Clint. “Are you okay with staying here? It’s usually very quiet even with Benni here. You’ll have a guest room and a bathroom to yourselves too.” It was Tony’s first time having actual guests in this house and it was more exciting than he had imagined. “Oh and usually we spend our time in the library but there’s no fireplace and today I needed the extra heat.”
“Good,” Tony replied with a smile on his lips. When he closed his eyes he could still see Steve between his legs. That thought was so intense that it left no room for any scary memories or feelings. “You’re so good to me, Steve.” He turned on his side to scoot closer to his tall, muscular fella, wanting to feel their bodies touch. It was warm here, no draft and plenty of blankets to protect Tony from feeling even a little cold.
Unable to move more than turning his head and looking at Steve, panting heavily, he smiled weakly. “So good,” he whispered.
Much to everyone’s relief, both of them slept through the night. They had no doubt that it was a combination of exhaustion, strong pain meds, and a feeling of security. They all knew that nightmares would soon become an even more regular part of their nights soon, but for now they were just grateful the two of them managed one night. Little victories.
James dragged another hand down his face and laughed sadly. “I love you, Steve. I always have.” Steve felt faint.
“You know that I’m not completely helpless, right?” he asked, his potato in his hand. “I appreciate it though.”
“Oh he’s eager to learn. Didja know he hadn’t a clue who you were at dinner the other night? Ma told him later.” James’ eyes bugged and he almost choked on his own spit.
,” James said and Benni looked up at him and nodded.
“Of course. What is this book about?”
“I don’t know if it will.” He sighed and closed his eyes. “It’s nice to have you here. I can’t listen to music because it’s too loud. And the bed is too soft? Don’t tell Steve but sometimes I get up when he’s asleep and read a book.”
James reached down and tipped Clint’s head up, two fingers placed under his chin. He had Clint’s full attention now as he said, “I’d drive you here and back again whenever you wanted if it made you happy and comfortable.” He moved his fingers from his chin and instead slipped them into Clint’s hair, grabbing a handful of the dirty blond locks and leaning down so they were face to face. “Anything for my baby.”
“Oh,” Clint said quietly, startled when he saw Tony there on the couch, a small fire going. “Room for one more?”
you are?” Despite the condition he was in Howard did not care for him, not that Tony had expected anything else. “You’re nothing. A whore, like your mother was. Someone like you could never be a son of mine.” Howard spat and Tony heard James take a step forward but he shook his head without looking away from Howard.
Right at that moment, the door opened and Tony and Falsworth came in. Tony had a bag in his good hand and Falsworth and a few men Tony didn’t know the names of were carrying the coffee machine and the other heavier bags.
“That’s alright. I doubt they would remember. Good job. We’ve had a few breakthroughs ourselves,” James said, motioning for her to come over.
Tony served the food and Steve handed him the plates. It was a quick dinner, especially for Benni.
“My ma painted that up in a place called the Glens of Antrim in far Northern Ireland. About an hour and a wee bit from Belfast,” he said, once again his accent slipping with the tiredness and excitement. “I used to beg my ma to drive up there every weekend. I’d stand up on the cliff’s edge to look out and she’d bust a vein yelling at me to move back, afraid the wind would blow my skinny arse all the way to Scotland.”
there to like about him? Everything he did was amazing.
“So, no one can know? Just me?”
“And the brown thick stuff in those other unlabeled bottles?”
Clint nodded. “Yes, please.”
“Just the usuals—new paint jobs, one guy has a 1967 Shelby cobra he wants to bring in for a full resto, and there are four other interior revamps lined up.”
She put the food down on the little table that sat between the bookshelves and the couch where he was and then turned to him, a soft touch on his good shoulder as she leaned in to kiss his hair. When she pulled back, she ruffled it and said, “Eat up before it gets cold.”
Steve’s eyes dropped to Tony’s hand on top of his and then back to Tony’s eyes, trying to read them, figure out if it was the truth. Tony wasn’t someone who went around hurting people—oh no, that was Steve’s job, he thought bitterly— so why wouldn’t it be the truth?
There were footsteps in the hallway and then a key was turned in the lock, before the door swung open. Tony quickly sat down on his mattress and closed his eyes.
Steve sucked in a sharp breath, not expecting that. The effect his words had on Steve were profound and he shuddered. He reached around, his hand untucking Tony’s shirt and snaking up his back, the skin there hot and soft and Steve’s mouth moved to Tony’s neck.
Once the door shut, Dugan turned to him. “What was that about?”
He gave Sarah a smile. “Painful. But it’s actually not that bad,” he lied and tried a piece of the cake instead of focusing on his aching and tired body. It was very sweet but not too sweet and it was delicious. The others continued to talk to each other while Tony enjoyed his dessert and listened.
Clint and James finally make it to France. James finally gets to give Clint his gifts. France is exactly what they both needed.
“Must you think so damn loud so early in the morning?” James mumbled against Clint’s skin and Clint felt the vibrations of his voice but wasn’t sure what he said. The silence, now highlighted by James’ audio-less speech, freaked Clint out and he reached for his hearing aids. James had removed them at one point so he wouldn’t wake with sore ears.
“We have a system and you two chose not to abide by the system, ergo your fault,” Bucky said. Sam was still hiding behind his hands, his forehead resting on Bucky’s shoulder.
“Maybe.”
Steve helps Tony deal with the toll killing takes on a person while reminding him of his worth. James confesses.
After weeks in small confined rooms with zero privacy he found his home way too big and confusing. There was so much going on! Benni told Tony story after story while they drank tea and ate cookies before dinner. Steve wouldn’t let him lift a finger and Sarah kept looking at him in a way that Tony couldn’t quite interpret.
Clint nodded, Sarah pressed another kiss to his forehead, and then she was gone. James was making Clint a bowl of the soup when Clint turned to him and said, “Thank you.”
“Will they?”
“About me. James. What I am, what we are. All of it.”
Rhodey snatched the phone from him and he sent gibberish to Steve.
“And just for the record, I know you love me. I do. I don’t doubt that. I don’t think anyone does or could doubt that.” Steve smiled and leaned in to press a quick kiss to his lips. “And I love you.”
“We’re getting out of here,” Steve said, carrying Tony out of the room, James following with Clint.
Steve snorted. “Not the first time I’ve heard that.” He was smiling against Tony’s side and then he yawned. “Did you… the other night when I fell asleep on your bed… what were you saying about sleepy boys? Is that a story?” He was getting tired, and relaxing, and he owed it all to Tony. Just one more reason to love him, he supposed.
Steve’s fist moved before James’ could, whipping out and landing firmly in the middle of Loki’s face, right where James had hit him a few months ago. Loki’s hands came up to his face and he hissed in pain, blood trickling between his fingers.
“What happened?” Clint heard a sharp voice demand and the sound of it bathed him in a warmth and feeling of security that he was sure was equal to how a swaddled baby felt.
He pointed out the things he would need—first of all, the coffee machine that took the both of them to carry to the car. While they were doing that, Tony went through the things in the pantry, grabbing canned goods and herbs of all sorts, then the dried herbs that were hanging above the counter. From the storage downstairs he took a whole wheel of parmesan that was perfectly well-stored and would be even more intense in its flavor now. Falsworth came looking for him and looked at all the alcohol stored down there. Tony didn’t care for it and if the other man hadn’t seen, he wouldn’t have mentioned it either.
Clint could feel himself starting to relax. He was always relaxed in Tony’s presence as of late but now in the kitchen, cooking, he relaxed more, falling into a steady rhythm of chopping. Part of his mind was still distracted by James, though.
“Okay,” Steve said, and he pulled his hand away, angling himself better and slowly, snail-speed slow, sliding in just a little. He knew it was different and he stopped, his self-control off the charts at this point, to ask Tony again if he was okay. “If you can’t talk, just nod or shake your head.”
Steve paused in his movements and narrowed his eyes at Tony who was holding back a laugh. “Well,” he began, trying his best to imitate Tony, “why don’t you let me be the judge of that?”
Sorry it’s a few days late. That’s on me (im95notdead) just being a tired and busy bee. Hope you enjoy!
That was it. That had been their last interaction. It was of some comfort that his last words to Steve were about how he felt. His last interaction with Benni was allowing him to get a lollipop. And with Sarah it was remembering the canned peaches they forgot to get. Canned peaches had been the reason why he left the group and ultimately, they were the opening for those men to take him.
Sarah, knowing the boys had things to discuss, told Benni she would read to him by the fireplace while they had dessert and he was up and out of his seat in no time, coming back only when he remembered his place had not been cleared. Once they were definitely out of earshot, James moved into the seat beside Steve, motioning for Tony to do the same.
Tony stayed close to Clint. Feeling someone else’s warmth was therapeutic even though he wasn’t the one he really wanted.
“I’ll visit if Steve lets me. And if he doesn’t, I’ll make Sarah look at him mean and tag along with her on her visits.” He held onto his hand and took a deep breath. He didn’t like the idea of being this far away from Clint.
. Nothing seemed to be appropriate, though, so he simply gave him another smile while he watched him go.
They undressed after Tony ran some warm water, the bathroom warming up with steam. They showered together, Tony massaging Steve’s back after washing it. Some nights this was all they wanted, all they needed too.
“Who do you know?” Steve asked as they walked back to the car, stepping over the bodies of the two security guards.
A pile of letters. A betrayal. Dugan is pretty damn great though.
“And that’s good and fine. All I want to know is that he is who you choose not your only
Two he had seen before. They had been nice enough considering who they were. However, there was a man putting his hat down on a table and watching Tony with a fixed gaze and suddenly Tony was painfully aware of the stains on his shirt and apron, how one sleeve was rolled up while the other wasn’t, and let’s not get started on the messiness of his hair. That tall man was everything Tony wasn’t. His skin glowing, his suit immaculate, his posture perfect and strong, his eyes clear like the sunniest summer sky.
“No, he seemed fine.”
The Russian mob was unforgiving while the Irish protected their community. Both of their leaders reacted promptly when Sarah gave them things to do.
“It’s been a while,” Phil observed carefully. Steve seemed incredibly confused. He had never been to Clint’s bar.
“Why would I hurt my own flesh and blood?” Howard scoffed and Tony nodded.
“What did you say?” Tony whispered and Pepper just winked at him. He pointed to the table and unwrapped the top layer with her.
“Why not? You’re in a good place, aren’t ya? You get to live rather than work yourself to death.”
“Can I get two?” Benni grinned and Tony nodded, smiling at Steve before heading out of the room.
“Say no more. But he, uh…” Clint trailed off again and looked away, cursing himself for the way his body was reacting, his eyes shining with tears and breath hitching. James and Natalia both squeezed the hand they were holding, waiting patiently. “He can’t get to us, right?” he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper, one single tear falling down his cheek that James was quick to wipe away with a thumb.
Sam sighed and rested a hand on Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky rolled his eyes but knew it was time for a less harsh approach. “What’s the problem?”
Benni out of there without ever having to lift a hand to anyone. I didn’t do that. I’m not better than you in any way. I told you last night, I
“More like I have a savory tooth and the rest are sweet,” he said with a laugh. “Sweets are my Achilles’ heel. Rhodey’s always trying to get me to cut back.”
He spoke and Clint frowned, trying to read his lips. He gestured to one of his men who picked up the phone on the desk and dialed a number, waiting for it to connect. The man took the phone and spoke into it but he faced away from Clint so he missed whatever was said.
Addio (Italian) - goodbye/farewell
“Lucky, the hearing aids, now this,” James listed without missing a beat. “Hell, I’m sure if I told you dinner tonight was a surprise you’d spend the next eight hours trying to make me tell you what it’s going to be.”
“But you know that there’s no one on this planet I’d rather spend my life with, right?” Clint asked and he could see the way James reacted to his serious tone, his expression troubled, questioning.
Tony stirred in his arms, waking up.
He glanced over in the darkness that was slowly dissipating as the sun rose—and how long he had been out, he had no idea—to see Tony’s slender form curled up on his mat, bruised and bloodied and seemingly unconscious.
He sighed and closed his eyes, spinning them slowly to the melody.
“I can make an appointment to get your cast off soon, if you’d like,” James said the next morning over breakfast. He looked up at Clint, wondering if today was going to be a nonverbal day or not.
“Couldn’t fall asleep. The fact that I didn’t hear you come downstairs is scaring me enough to never sleep again if I’m completely honest.” He wrapped the blanket around Clint’s shoulders and his own. It wasn’t much but luckily there was a second blanket he could throw over their legs if need be. “Wanna talk about those bad dreams?”
Tony wanted to turn around and get up at the same time but only ended up banging his head on the top of the fireplace. “Ouch,” he whined and crouched back down, holding his head. “You look comfy. Is this the Steve I’m going to have all to myself?” He reached out one hand and gestured for Steve to come closer.
He wanted to talk to Clint, but he wasn’t quite sure where to start. Steve didn’t talk about the war and Tony didn’t want to know. The nights when he had nightmares about the things he had experienced were more than enough for him. Tony didn’t know James all that well either, so there wasn’t a lot for him to say there.
When he opened his eyes, the first face he saw was Tony’s. Tony was asleep in the chair beside him, his head rested on Steve’s bed, pillowed on top of his folded arms.
They carried the trays of dessert and drinks out to the living room where Benni was glued to the radio and listening as if his life depended on it.
“See ya around?”
That evening he and James met earlier in the week than usual at one of their two usual spots, which were either the basement bar in Steve’s home or the bar in James’. The only other two people there Dugan and Dmitri as was always the case, Dmitri making the drinks.
Steve narrowed his eyes at him. “He knows enough. I didn’t want to force my friendship on him.”
Steve pulled his hand away from his middle, his fingertips coated in red, and he staggered a little, feeling lightheaded.
“Why France?” Natalia asked later that same day, sitting at the bar, a martini in her hand that Clint had just made for her.
Tony sat up straight, regretting what he had said. Did he give away precious information to the last person he should have trusted?
“Did too.”
“Especially sleeping.”
“Knock knock,” Sarah said as she entered the office, closing the door behind her. “Hate to interrupt but I’ve brought food.”
scare you off.” He cleared his throat and continued. “Look, man, Steve’s my friend too and he’s a
“I haven’t left my office all morning. Describe him.”
Natalia laughed. “Oh, I wanted to but I refused to be beaten by half-digested apple sauce.”
“It makes me feel good to win against a machine,” he said with a cocky grin, picking up his mug to take a sip himself. Clint’s question made him sigh and he checked to see if the doors were closed. “Not so good. I’m trying to be good because I worry Steve… I can see he wants to talk about it and know what happened but I don’t want him to know. You know?”
“Clint?” James repeated, his hands on the desk and head down as he fought to carefully contain everything he felt. At least if Tony was next he would get to hear Steve’s voice.
“Probably like an Italian who doesn’t like food,” Tony said and hugged the cushion closer. “What else?” Speaking drained a lot of his energy. More than he realized. But he wanted to listen to Steve. Better yet, rest against him.
Now they were in the kitchen, papers spread out between them, calming teas provided by Sarah and she was making food as well. She was cooking for three reasons: to calm herself, because she figured if James and Steve were eating they would have a hard time fighting, and because she knew neither of them would remember food and sleep existed until Clint and Tony were back.
Clint looked down at his food, the corner of his mouth pulled up as a mischievous smile tried to make its home there, realizing James wasn’t listening to Benni. James nudged him playfully with his elbow and Clint winced. James felt a wave of nausea roll over him that he stomped down by the time he had Clint’s attention again and Benni was being told to eat a little more and then finish his explanation.
Tony watched Steve with curiosity. Normally, he didn’t like surprises but with Steve he didn’t mind all that much.
“I think Steve and James were close to finding us. That’s why we moved,” Tony whispered, being extra careful to still form his words clearly.
“You could’ve led with that. Well, then have fun and think of me on my wedding day.”
“You’re a smart man,” James said in between kisses, making his way up Clint’s opposite side now, “who can do anything he puts his mind to.” Clint smiled, bathing in the praise and affection. “Except,” James continued and Clint listened closely, “try to convince me that you’re anything other than everything I want.”
He turned to Tony. “Pinky’s a mechanic. He buys and fixes cars. He’s been working on a nice one just for us,” Steve explained, getting out of the car and going around to open the door for Tony.
Tony chuckled weakly. He was done eating for now and saved the rest for later. His craving for vegetables or a nice chicken broth soup was intense. Something warm and delicious. Dinner with the family, then after dinner time with Steve. “So, you live with James?”
Steve pulled up a chair and sat down beside the bed, leaning forward, his hands clasped together. He considered his next words and then said, “You don’t owe me anything and I never expected anything from you. Not in the beginning and certainly not now. I’m doing this because—”Lie? Half-lie? Vague response? “—I was in a similar situation to you before my father died. I wish I’d had someone help me and my ma out. Guess that someone for me was a disease,” he said, not mentioning it by name because he knew Tony’s sister had suffered a similar fate. “You’re welcome, Tony. And enough with the sir and the ‘Mr Rogers.’ It’s Steve.” So half-lie it was.
“Oh, my whole name. This is getting serious,” she laughed, reaching for another slice and dangling it above her mouth to let the stringy cheese fall in first. “Speaking of James,” she added, and a second later Clint heard the door close.
“I don’t know why you’re doing any of this and by now I’m indebted to you more than I could ever pay you back but, Mr Rogers, sir, thank you. For taking care of my brother and me.”
“Tony? What’s going on?” Benni asked, which made everything worse.
He knew he was giving Tony that soft smile he normally only aimed his way when the man was asleep or otherwise not looking at Steve but he couldn’t help it. He was
“Would you like me to throw your cigar off the balcony to show you just how much I
Tony sniffed. “Yeah, sure,” he said, keeping his voice light and carefree, “but here’s the thing, what if he was just being polite?” Tony snapped his fingers, and made an ‘I don’t know’ gesture, holding his hands out from him and shrugging his shoulders.
Clint looked between the photos, his excitement growing and only overshadowed by his love for James. He really was going through a lot of trouble to give this to Clint.
Instead he rolled them again so they were both laying on their sides and he kissed Tony slowly, deepening it and continuing until he was breathless and a little lightheaded. His hand that had been resting on Tony’s waist, traveled down his leg and back up again as he pushed all the bad thoughts aside for the moment to focus on Tony.
He came into the room and James wasted no time with pleasantries.
He found everyone in the kitchen eating and he came in and pressed a kiss to Benni’s hair, a kiss to Sarah’s cheek, and then one to Tony’s lips before he sat down at his usual place at the head of the table. Sarah eyed him and then stood to make him a plate and sit it down in front of him, Steve, who had closed his eyes, looked up and thanked her, his gaze going to Tony.
“So he’s… direct. And I’m very lost,” Sam said, moving closer to Bucky who tilted his head down slightly to kiss Sam’s lips.
Sarah sighed as she came into the kitchen, sensing that they were up to no good, and shook her head. She made James and Steve sit back down, and sent Tony to get Benni who was playing with Lucky in his room while she herself set the table. Benni had taken to Lucky and used every free minute to play with the dog.
Tony nodded against Rhodey’s shoulder. “Doc said he’s in surgery but he’s fine.”
“It’s not that bad. Nothing that needs looking over.”
“What if we don’t find them for another month? What if the locations we have… what if none of them pan out?” James was nervous and worried but he wasn’t panicking, he was just making them both face the harsh reality that could very well be the truth.
“Tony. Tony,
He rubbed his hands up and down his face. He had more than a little stubble. It was a beard now and his hair could use a trim. He was also in desperate need of a shower, a toothbrush, and a change of clothes but for now he was just happy to still be alive.
His accent was thicker than usual, making Tony smile.
It smelled a bit musty and Steve left the front door wide open and began opening the windows as well. He carried their luggage upstairs and got changed while he let Tony explore.
“Look after them,
“Does it have to do with—”
“Hm,” he hummed. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he added after a moment of thought. “Well, next time your father is sure to be out for the whole day, call this number,” he told him, reaching into his jacket pocket and pulling out a nice, expensive-looking silver pen. He jotted down a number and slid it across to Tony. “That’s this phone right here.” He pointed to the one sat on his desk.
“I told Dugan by accident,” he explained. “I never intended to tell any of you.”
He chuckled. “Oh no, of course not.” His accent was thick. Russian, unlike Cap’s Irish-American drawl. “Just an advantageous young recruit looking to move up.” He smirked and Cap chuckled.
He looked up at Tony and smiled, just a small thing. Something private and just for him. “How are you doing?” It was almost three in the afternoon and Steve was hating that he hadn’t seen Tony all day.
Steve was shaking his head too. “I got lost in the moment,” he said, “I’m glad you enjoyed it but I don’t ever want to see bruises on you from anyone’s hands ever again and especially not my hands.”
Steve didn’t like Tony’s voice or the hesitation in his sentence. He especially didn’t like the look in his eyes but when he spoke, he understood why he didn’t and he would do everything he could to make it hurt less.
Steve gave him another smile, this one much more playful. He booped Tony’s nose with a finger and said, “You’d like to know more because you’re nosy or because you’re nervous?”
When the door was shut and the things deposited—most going to the living room where there was a small kitchenette—Steve stood and went over to inspect the machine but really he just wanted to stand close to Tony so he could whisper to him.
“Let’s say ten minutes,” Steve said. “We were there for about twenty. That gives us an hour and a half.”
He held his hand out for the knife but Falsworth just raised his own.
Steve sipped the new coffee put in front of him and hummed, delighted. “This
He signed the papers and waited for the ink to dry before giving it back to Steve.
“I never expected that. Ever. He and I used to sit around telling lil Ben how great ya are. How much we admire you. Falsworth always had the best stories so for him to turn around and—” Jones looked away, biting his tongue. It had slipped Steve’s memory that Falsworth was Jones’ best friend.
After a few hours at Steve’s house under heavy protection and some discussing about what Benni would truly need for his time at James’ and they were standing in front of his house being let in.
“Wanna help your mess out of bed?”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, “I just wanted to clear my mind.”
A few days ago, he had gotten water and a bread roll. He didn’t eat it right away, figuring that they would start starving him again soon so he saved it, eating half and storing the other half underneath the blanket they had brought.
“There. Was that so bad?”
“Should anything happen and we don’t come back—“
Tony bit the inside of his cheek in order not to laugh. He wanted Benni to know that he took him seriously.
Clint’s eyebrows lifted in surprise. “So that’s what the measurements were for.” James nodded.
“Information. On Bakuto.”
James eyed him, deciding for now to keep his own issue under wraps. “I think we should go downstairs. I’m sure they’re wondering what we’ve been talking about for so long,” James said, standing and cracking his neck.
Now, after having explained all of that to James who was swallowing down his own anger and frustration, he was halfway asleep in James’ lap on the bed. James had covered him up and was combing through his hair with his fingers, humming a gentle melody, when Tony knocked at the door.
Hi Tony yeah I knew it was you haha. What happened to that last message?
“Stay here?” James repeated, surprised. “Do you really think that would be for the best? It’s not going to be too many people? Overwhelm Tony?” Steve had been explaining to James to take it slow with Tony when they went back upstairs just like James had explained to not to touch Clint near his head.
“Steve and I have some work related things to discuss but we’ll be downstairs if either of you need anything,” James told him, leaning in for a kiss that Clint denied, turning his face to offer his cheek instead of his lips. “Alright. See you in a bit,
Tony went back inside feeling like a new man and Banner came out of his office to talk to him.
“Get them home. Now.” He heard Steve say ‘okay’ before he hung up but he couldn’t focus on that. All he could think about was the fact that Clint was gone. James had not done enough and Clint was taken. He never should have let him argue his way out of security.
Tony’s nightmare was finally over. It would never come back. Howard Stark could never hurt or insult him ever again. Tony could finally move on from the torture that had been his life for the longest time. His mother could finally rest in peace. His brother could grow up without fearing his father.
What was the right move here? A text? How should he even start it? Or maybe seeing him in person again would be better. Damn, Steve had been single and not even trying to mingle for
Steve kissed him, grinning into the kiss, his hand placed firmly on the small of Tony’s back as he pulled him in. “How’s that?” He kissed him again. “Or that?”
“They caught him. The arsonist. Well, Bucky tackled him.”
“I’m comfortable with you,” he said, focusing on the soft touches on his hand. “I’m sorry. I want to be good but I just got scared?” Tony looked up and Steve moved to hug him. Yes, that was much better. “I definitely needed that,” he mumbled, a small smile on his lips.
“Thanks, lad,” the other said and Tony turned around to head back to the store. At this rate, that might have been the last time he went there.
“I should’ve killed you when I had the chance,” James said, and Loki noticed the knife that was in his hands now, his knuckles white with how tightly he was gripping the handle. Beside him Steve wasn’t doing any better. He wanted to grab Loki by his greasy hair and toss him off the Brooklyn Bridge.
“Nice to see you,” James told her, reaching down to inspect what was left in the pizza boxes. He took a slice from Natalia’s box, taking a bite, and then said, walking away with it as she pretended to protest, “I’ll change and be back down soon.”
Pinky eyed the bill and then looked up at Steve, his mouth slightly open. He reached out for it tentatively and Steve put it into his hand. “Yer ma said your insurance business was really taking off,” Pinky said, still looking at the money, “but I didn’t think you had this kind of dosh to just hand out.”
Without turning on the lights Tony sat on the couch that was facing outside and watched the snow fall silently. When he moved to stretch his legs he noticed a blanket. Had that been always been there? ‘Always’ meaning the last twenty-four hours, since Tony himself hadn’t been there too long. He wrapped himself in the blanket, ignoring the throbbing in his left arm and continuing to watch the world outside.
Slowly, Clint repeated everything—the number of steps, where to go, and what to do. He had Tony recite the phone numbers he would try to call and then Tony made sure the coins were secure in his back pocket where they would make the least noise. He tightened his belt as much as he could, creating an extra hole in it because of how thin he was now.
The three looked between each other and then it was Steve who finally gave in and went to get it.
“That is not his name,” his father growled and let go of Tony. “Now prepare the food! Everything needs to be perfect.”
Tony looked over the receipts that Dugan had brought and frowned. There it was again. Plus a note from Dugan saying he had no information about the account either and only did it because Steve told him to do so.
Tony’s hand ran over one of the wool blankets. Maria, his mother, had a blanket not unlike this, years ago. He remembered how Nella had been wrapped up in it when she was shivering despite her fever that refused to go down. Nella had been brought to a hospital in that blanket and after she passed they were told the blanket needed to be burned. Even though she never said so, Tony knew Maria had loved that blanket. Once Maria had told him how her mother had brought that blanket over to the U.S. when they first came here.
Sarah scoffed and Steve was grinning, chewing on a piece of toast. “I’ll just start leaving money in your pockets. His too,” she said, pointing at Benni. “No one in my house is leaving out ill-prepared,” she said, only barely stopping herself from saying ‘no child of mine’. She helped herself and Steve to more eggs although his appetite was still not fully back, and added, “And if you’re so deeply against using it for yourself, you can bring me one of those chocolate covered strawberries they sell at the zoo.”
pulled it off, that is. Forensics didn’t find squat and said chances of me finding anything else were slim to none. Showed their stupid asses,” she grumbled, crossing her hands over her chest.
Tony nodded. “Sure. Let me get changed and I’ll be there in a minute.” That would give him time to think of things to say. He wasn’t worried about how his brother would react nor was he worried if he would understand it. Knowing his brother the way he did, he knew it would be fine. With that thought he went to his brother’s room and found Steve standing in his doorway, talking to the boy.
James reached over and grabbed his hand, intertwining their fingers. He squeezed comfortingly and Clint laughed but it was pretty obvious that he only did so to mask the pain.
“We have a question for you two,” Steve said.
“So you never told me,” Tony said, pulling his head back to break the kiss and give them both a moment to breathe, “why couldn’t you do today?”
“If it was supposed to be any of your business, you’d know by now,” he told him, heading back inside and Jones followed a few moments later, rolling his eyes. Cap was going to skin them when he realized that whatever it was, was still not being taken care of.
“I can do that.” Benni pulled away from his brother. “I like that you smile so much now.” He got up, as if his words were nothing special or didn’t carry a lot of baggage. “I’ll go downstairs to
Steve’s face softened completely at Tony’s flinch and, being alone, he allowed himself freedoms in his speech and manner that he normally would not. Not even in front of Dugan. “I know it’s a learned thing,” he began, touching Tony’s head to move it this way and that and check for more markings, “but I hope you’ll come to stop reacting like that. I promise I’ll never lay a false hand on ya.”
With a smile on his lips he leaned in and told Steve as quietly as possible, “Just get comfortable. I don’t mind.” He pulled his arm away from the middle, still having more than enough space to himself.
“If you get overwhelmed with them here, why didn’t you tell me? I would’ve told James and they wouldn’t have come,” Steve said, focusing on one thing at a time.
Steve pushed the door open to see Clint sitting on the floor, red in the face, his eyes shiny with tears. He went over to him, crouching down.
“Have you tried putting a bullet between his eyes?” Steve growled. Dugan didn’t say anything, he knew Steve was angry. Steve dragged a hand down his face. “Arrange a meet up tomorrow. 9am at Stark’s old place.” Steve wanted somewhere neutral, somewhere people wouldn’t be looking at him and wondering what they were doing.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way. He also said he’d marry me if that was possible. So...“ He trailed off, making it sound like it wasn’t a big deal. Pepper clearly wanted to react to it.
“He told me that he ambushed you. Was that how you met him the first time?” If it was, he could see why it was such a disaster. “Not yet. I... turn twenty next May. Why?”
Steve shook his head. “No. I wouldn’t have done it so fast to my own da but then again, had he killed my ma I would’ve.”
When he got back to the office, he went in to finish up some work for the night. It was mainly his own personal account-keeping of the going-ons of the others. They may have been working together in some weird way, had some strange alliance only by word-of-mouth, but that didn’t mean Steve had to trust them.
“I’m not going to leave you. Especially not if you look so sad,” he said and moved to kiss Steve’s forehead, his nose and then his lips. “But it would be good for you to sleep. You have a lot of healing to do.” Maybe Tony would nap a little. Once he was sure Steve was truly asleep. If he managed to fall asleep, that was.
Steve leaned forward to look at the map and then up at James. “How accurate is this?”
Steve is frustrated but mostly with himself and so is James.
“Definitely,” James agreed, heading downstairs as Steve turned to go to his room.
It was nice. Like your bar, Barton.”
. But he looked up at Steve with his happy-to-the-world smile that Rhodey saw right through and did his best not to sigh again.
“But Jones has hair.”
“Dmitri brought him
Tony watched Benni and Sarah go and scooted closer to Steve, offering him his hand.
“So,” she started once she forced him to drink at least a third of his milkshake. “Wanna tell me what’s going on then?”
She smiled. “Lots to talk about. Thought we needed a bit longer than a few quick words after dinner.” He nodded. “You busy?”
Clint made his way to Natalia, wrapping an arm around her waist and pressing a kiss to her hair. “Oh, this will be fun,” he said.
Steve explained to her what had happened and she listened objectively, nodding her head as he spoke.
“I know,
Clint took pity on the kid, turning his attention to him and inadvertently bumping his leg on the table. He closed his eyes, letting the pain settle and then went back to his mission.
“Sometimes they’re mean. Sometimes Miss Monaghan picks my hand but I don’t know the answer and they laugh.”
James didn’t look up as he said, “I’m fine. Let’s work.”
“Deaf not blind, keep up,” he said, nudging Tony’s shoulder playfully. “We passed this long hallway and at the end was a door and I could see the street. So
“A-are you finally going to k-kill me? T-took you long enough,” Bakuto managed, which James was sure had been incredibly painful seeing as Steve had broken four of his ribs the last time they were there and James had bruised his windpipe. “You’re w-weak.”
Steve listened as Tony spoke, finishing up with his bandages and then inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly. He scratched the back of his neck, a little conflicted, but followed Tony out of the bathroom and into their bed.
They chatted for a few minutes longer about their trips and Steve gave James the number to their cottage in Ballycastle. James attempted to shoo Clint out of his office so he couldn’t eavesdrop and ruin his surprise but when Clint refused to leave, James just switched to Irish instead. Steve had always been a bit envious of how easy languages were for him.
Steve waited, figuring anything to do with Howard Stark did not warrant getting three hours of sleep, so there must have been something else on his mind.
“That sounds almost perfect but it’s lacking a lot of
“Hey,
Steve shot him. Point blank in the head and he collapsed lifelessly on the ground.
“Yes.”
to know?”
They hadn’t taken the step towards cohabitation but they very rarely spent their nights alone, especially after long, tiring days at work or particularly hard calls for the firehouse. And it was working. It was working well.
Tony’s expression softened at Steve’s words. He recognized that behavior. He’d been guilty of it plenty of times himself. What asshole had hurt this beautiful man and why?
“Oh hello.” Tony smiled and hugged his brother. The boy was absolutely delighted to have most of his favorite people in one room together. While he talked to the other three, Tony went to Sarah and she hugged him immediately. He hugged her back and enjoyed the familiar warmth. Their Steve was alright.
“True. He actually told me once that he’s not a people person. As if that’s not the second thing I noticed about him after his eyes,” Clint said instead of saying his thighs because he wanted to say his thighs. “And I had no clue who he was. I never knew what Dmitri did for work,” he laughed. “So I walked up to James and clapped him on the back and said ‘how ya doing?’ Not my best moment.”
get a name, hm?” James said, twirling his knife slowly. Loki didn’t say anything, not sure what would actually help.
“Oh no, don’t you go giving me that bollocks, Steven Grant Rogers. I’ve been reading that face since before you could shite on your own and I can read it now.” He looked up at her, worry plain on his face. She reached out and held it in her hands, her smile loving. “I’ve always known.”
Steve knew exactly what he was doing and that thought alone was making everything hotter for Tony. His skin felt like it was on fire and being apart from Steve made everything worse. Through heavy lidded eyes he looked at Steve, to that gorgeous man who was busy getting rid of unnecessary pieces of clothing. He nodded to him when he finally understood what Steve was waiting for, finding his hands useless and way too heavy to do anything other than roam over Steve’s upper body.
Tony whined, refusing to move away from the comfortable warmth. He nuzzled against Clint again, promising himself only five more minutes.
Steve came over slowly, put a hand on James’ shoulder and squeezed. “Hey,” he said and James looked up at him, “this isn’t square one. We’ll find them and you know it. Get your shit together, Romanov, this isn’t who you are.”
“Because it’s something for Steve and me only. We’ll all go on a vacation with Sarah and you when it’s summer and we have time for you,” Tony said, his legs crossed under him. He didn’t want to take any of the blankets. He knew that if he made himself too comfortable and warm, he’d have a hard time heading back home.
Steve was not known by any of his previous partners to be a soft or gentle man. He was normally described as a bit of a monster but in the
“Not yet. He’s probably too angry. Not like I got anything out of him anyway. He managed to slip away before I could even ask.”
Sarah asked Clint a few questions about his recovery and he told her he had at least another two months before he could walk without help, even longer if he wanted to be as safe as possible, which was what James wanted.
He looked out of the back window and saw the glint of the gun in the moonlight from a window three stories up and about twenty feet behind him to right of the car. He couldn’t see the other kid but he just knew Falsworth wasn’t alone.
“I think I know someone who can help,” Natalia said with a smile.
“You don’t like girls yet, do you?”
“Nothing wrong with it,” Clint said, seeing the way he was retreating back. He didn’t know how to say it without someone on the other side of the door possibly hearing them. He wanted to say he knew Steve. That they were… acquaintances. Not friends, not yet.
He pulled back, blood running out of his nose. “You little,” was all Clint managed to read before he was hit again and this time, everything went dark.
“That I do. Last time she was here, she talked my ear off about you,” Pinky said with a chuckle. “But that’s lovely. You always did have that big brother quality about ya.”
“How are you?” He asked, completely avoiding her comment.
“Benni,” Tony said and told him in Italian that it was rude to interrupt his breakfast because of this. He didn’t even notice how much he gestured while he spoke until Sarah chuckled softly.
“That sounds like a lie.” James took a left and Clint knew they were only ten minutes from home. “What’s going on? You don’t actually want to stay?”
“Well if such a thing ever is possible, I’d like to walk one or both of ya down the aisle.”
He pushed the door open and walked out, standing beside her, using her as a cover for any prying eyes. With the way the bar was set up, no one could really see him without encroaching on Natalia’s personal space and not a soul dared to do that.
“We have all the time in the world to talk about what to do next with Bakuto. He’s not going anywhere anytime soon,” James said, standing and going over to Sarah to grab her hand and give it a squeeze. “Thank you for the idea,
James’ other hand was holding the cigar he had lit, his arm dangling lazily off the side of the wide chair they were in.
. Now don’t look so surprised. I know scolding when I see it.” She winked at Tony.
“Of course. You know ma would have a fit if she went a week without seeing your ugly mug.”
“Of course. Thank you,” Tony said and Benni went right in to unpack his things. James was leaving again already. “James?” Tony asked and the man stopped but didn’t turn to look at him. “Thank you. Really.” Sarah had hinted that James was helping with whatever was going on. Not that Tony didn’t expect that but it was always nice to have some confirmation.
Just to make sure that it was real, he looked at the second collection of documents belonging to Benni. He would make good on his promise and take Benni on a nice vacation where he would get to use his new papers as well.
“It was my idea,” Sarah said, now standing in the doorway, a little flour on her sky blue apron that matched her eyes. She was drying her hands off with a dish towel as she spoke and looked so incredibly warm and motherly that she had everyone’s undivided attention. “Passed by a while ago. I haven’t seen you two talk that much since you’ve come home. It was a sight for sore eyes. Figured it must be one another’s company.”
Tony covered his mouth when he had to laugh at the bickering around the table. Those three had a good thing going and he loved how they worked together.
Tony chuckled again, shaking his head. “Alright,
He licked in the hollow part of Tony’s collarbone and laughed. “Hopefully that won’t be the only thing on me.”
“Goodnight, fellas,” Clint said with a smile, mostly directed at Tony.
“Really? Thanks, Steve,” Sam said and Bucky gave Steve a soft smile.
“I’d love a tour.” Tony nodded. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen him in clothes that weren't a three piece suit but this time it was completely different. Throwing punches at someone else made him look even more fierce. Now he looked soft, private and sincere. Still strong and ready to act but also relaxed. “I’ll follow,” he said and pointed to the door leading to the hallway.
“May 29th. You told me a while ago you’d be nineteen in May and then I got the rest off your medical records,” he said, grinning.
No one said anything, no one brought it up or pointed it out or treated them any differently. No one said a word to James or Steve until they were ready because the pictures Bakuto had sent two days ago brought tears to both of their eyes and continued to plague them.
Clint, James, and Dmitri got into the elevator, heading for the underground car park because James hadn’t been feeling up to being seen arriving at the hospital. There was always someone who wanted to talk to him about
“I want this,” Tony managed to say. “I want
James watched, highly confused and more than a little annoyed but he said nothing.
He slid back out as carefully as possible and made his way back downstairs.
“It sure can,” James said, reaching over to run his fingers through Clint’s hair.
“Won’t you eat something?” Sarah asked and Tony looked down at his plate. The potatoes looked delicious but he didn’t feel hungry. “That’s alright,” she said softly and rubbed his back but Tony hated the touch.
Steve stopped and Callahan winced, expecting another blow but Steve just stood there, arms crossed, staring at him. “I do now? Then, tell me, did you get confused? Did you… think they didn’t apply to you? Did you just not give a fuck?” Steve laughed.
Clint took a bite of the food, chewing happily, and then he shook his head. “No, I was just surprised,” he said with a shrug, plain and simple. He hadn’t really had any thoughts about it either negative or positive. “Has this really been bothering you ever since then? If so, I’m sorry.”
“Hang in there. Do you want a drink?” He looked up when Steve mentioned the strawberries and pouted. “They were supposed to be an extra bonus for your mom. Guess the chocolate cake will have to do.” He leaned back and listened to the story for a moment. He couldn’t focus on it much longer simply because he was so excited about getting away from here, going somewhere new, being with Steve.
Stepping inside for the first time in actual months, he had expected a panic attack in all honesty but instead he had been welcomed by a familiarity and comfort so strong it almost brought tears to his eyes.
He lifted his hand, his fingers hovering over the phone as he hesitated, and then he grabbed it.
“Jones, stay here with ma and Benni,” Steve said, knowing that Dmitri’s men were keeping guard as well around the perimeter of the house.
Steve had hoped for almost any other question.
got rid of many things.” Those books Steve had seen and gotten new copies of… as grateful as he was for that, those three books had been Maria’s favorites and one of the few things Tony had of his mother’s. He didn’t need things to remember his mother but still it was nice to touch something she had touched so many times. He did appreciate him going out of his way and getting him new versions though. “I didn’t get to read a lot after that. This is new to me.” He tapped his index finger on the book cover and shrugged.
Maybe he should tell him why they found it easier to sleep like this? After a few seconds of contemplation, he decided against it. No, he wasn’t ready yet.
“We were discussing finances. Specifically, where to move them to should another threat like Bakuto come along and also just to make sure we have safe offshore accounts, which isn’t a complete lie since we were going to talk about it tomorrow anyway.”
“Tony?” Steve said, sounding a little frantic as he came around the corner and stopped in his tracks. He brushed his hair away from his face and closed his robe a little tighter as soon as he noticed Clint. His gaze fell on the way Clint had his arm around Tony and how Tony was leaning into him and Steve was hit with all kinds of conflicting emotions, the loudest of them being relief and jealousy. “Everything alright? What are you two doing up?”
“Tony said I can give you our presents. Just so you know.” He puffed his chest up, looking proud of himself that he had such an important task.
“Can we bring
“I’m getting sick of waiting!” the man growled but Tony wasn’t sure those words were even meant for him. He didn’t even see the punch to his face coming, only felt the sudden force on his cheek. Before he could process what happened, another punch landed right in the middle of his face, soon followed by a third.
Steve ground his jaw. “Let’s go home.”
“Alright,” he said, not liking that Steve’s mood shifted again. “You want me to leave you to it?”
Tony nodded and smiled, still sleepy but determined to stay awake because he was alone with Steve in his favorite room of their house. “This right now is especially nice.” He stretched but flinched and inhaled sharply when he felt pain in his side. Healing took time, he knew that from experience. However, that didn’t mean that he didn’t hate the process.
Steve didn’t come to dinner, which was unfortunate because Tony didn’t see him all day and he really wanted to. He told himself that it was to talk to him about all the money his mother spent on him and Beniamino. That didn’t seem appropriate since he wasn’t doing anything to earn his keep. Sure, that was one reason why he wanted to talk to Steve. The other reason was because he simply wanted to.
“We’re not going to see them again, are we?” he asked, glad that Clint wasn’t able to hear his voice break.
James chuckled. “That’s just her face. She just doesn’t trust you yet. And Clint’s not the grudge-holding type. He understands why you did what you did. So do I.”
Tony went to collect his clothes, straighten and put them where they belonged before going to take a shower to start the day fresh.
James was going on day four of one meal a day and Dmitri and Natalia were both worried but he refused to take more time than he needed for “frivolous things,” as he called it. Right, yes. Eating. Frivolous.
“Rude,” Tony scoffed and sipped his coffee. “But I guess you know pretty much everything there is to know about me anyways.” People talked and it was his job to know things so Tony shouldn’t be surprised.
. You and I both know the likelihood of getting them back alive had we given in was small to none. It’s what
Dugan scoffed. “You protected my life in the war, I’ll protect yours here.”
“Sure. How do you want your tea then? Burnt or extra burnt?” Steve laughed. “I will. We’ll make another trip back into Belfast at one point. I spent school time in Belfast but my summers at the cottage. It used to be my grandparents’ home.”
Steve nodded and held Tony tighter. Dugan came over with the folders and put them on the side of the bed and opened the one on the top. “Unfortunately, not everyone has my brand of loyalty. Or rather, any at all.” He turned it around and Steve saw the familiar face. “I can’t find him but he wasn’t happy when he left.”
Steve laughed again, this time a little more sure of himself. “Oh, I’m sure you’ll hate that.”
James looked between the two of them, weighing the pros and cons and then nodded. “Alright. Let’s go talk to them.”
forgive me?” Steve huffed out a laugh, pulling Tony in for a kiss that began sweet and simple but he deepened it, pushing Tony’s lips apart and sliding his tongue in, kissing him breathless. He pulled back, biting Tony’s bottom lip as he went. “How about,” he said, his voice lower and a little hoarse from arousal, “I take you upstairs and treat you to what I did our first time?”
Tony said, louder than necessary, “I missed Jones who went to pick up Benni.” With his head he motioned upstairs. “Unless you have something better to do?”
Steve was lying on his back now, his eyes closing but he kept trying to keep them open. He reached for the blanket that he felt hit his elbow and pulled it towards him, listening to Tony. “Mm, ‘s comfortable an’ warm. Safe,” he mumbled.
Tony shook his head, stopping the movement. “You did say you wanted to be my last,” he said, a faint blush on his cheeks. “I’ll take the gold watch too.” He added the second sentence with a wink, just to make it seem less serious.
invest in some silence,” James said roughly and Bakuto shut up instantly. James still didn’t look at Steve nor anyone else, his eyes on the papers he had in front of him—reports from them all, the work Tony had been helping Jones organize that morning.
With Clint’s help, they lifted her and maneuvered her out the window into the strong and steady arms of Natasha who first put a c-collar on her and then strapped her to the backboard so she could safely be lowered via the ladder.
“I’m sorry, Gabe,” he told him sincerely.
“Attagirl, Pep. Anything else of interest?”
James chuckled, nuzzling his face in Clint’s hair. He let out a deep sigh but Clint was already talking before he could carry on.
“She’d be even happier if she heard from the both of us,” Tony said and went to the phone on the side table. The cable was long enough to reach to Steve’s bed.
“He’s not there. Only some of his employees,” Jones reported.
“I hope he’s not losing money,” Tony grinned and Dugan scoffed in response.
The man was sweating now, such a contrast from the shivering, slightly blue-hued man they had seen when they’d walked in.
“James, love—“
He considered asking Tony more questions. He wanted to know all about him. His likes, his dislikes, especially what things he hated so he could keep them far away from him but that was excessive and Steve needed to maintain certain public appearances and those appearances did not always match up with his desires, unfortunately.
“Why would I ever stop trusting you?” he asked but he wasn’t expecting an answer, he was just letting Tony know that it was a ridiculous notion. Tony was his now and forever and nothing would ever change that. Steve would make sure of it. “I won’t but I might just be a little biased and tell you more about our future instead.”
it as I normally would.”
“Hey,” he said softly, smiling. “You alright?”
Tony felt extremely grateful for Dugan and at the same time he hated how everyone seemed to be able to read him. "Thank you," he said honestly. He looked to Steve and gave his hand a gentle squeeze. They had leads, people to weed out.
Tony pressed his lips together for a moment and then he allowed himself to smile since there was nothing to be afraid of.
for him, Steve.”
“What ever happened to leaving business at the door?” James asked, leveling Steve with a look. Steve turned to him, about to give him an earful and then sighed, cracking his neck.
“Fire department, call out!” Sam yelled and heard the tiniest whimper come from the corner of the room. He headed towards the sound and found a teenage girl. “Lieutenant, I got her!”
Steve, about to head out of the kitchen, stopped dead and whirled around to face Benni. “Come again, lad?”
Tony took a deep breath, his hand back on Steve’s. There was nothing he could say or do. “I’m sorry,” he said. He
He said, “Dinner’s ready,” and walked off to the kitchen.
He turned back to Steve, resting his other hand on his. “
He couldn’t shake the bad feeling gnawing at him. It was like a weight tied around his neck. Something was wrong and that only became more apparent the longer James refused to tell. The fact that James had not called to rip Steve a new one meant he really did not want to talk about this.
First, they ordered two medium sized turkeys from the butcher. Next were vegetables, which took much longer because Sarah knew the store owners personally. Lastly, they went ahead and bought enough ingredients to bake two different desserts to make things interesting.
“That’s good,” Tony said and moved to rest a hand on Benni’s small face. He had grown a lot since they had gotten there but his face still looked like always. Though now it was rounder and fuller, his skin smoother and not pale anymore.
Clint turned fully and wrapped his arms around James, kissing him. It started as just a chaste kiss and then Clint lingered. He didn’t intensify it and neither did James; they just kissed, slowly, lovingly, and it made Clint feel better.
He led him over to the globe that was standing beside one of the bookshelves and he turned it so Ireland was front and center. He pointed to the northernmost tip, so far north it was nearly Scotland and honestly, if Tony didn’t mind, Steve might just plan a little ferry trip to Islay and pick himself up some scotch.
Tony smiled brightly, his nose wrinkling as he did. “You sound so surprised,” he laughed softly, one hand back to combing through Steve’s hair. “He admires you and your strength. He keeps asking Dugan and Jones to tell him stories about your time in the war.”
“That sounds like a grand time! Here,” Sarah said, reaching around to her purse and pulling out money for them. She held it out for Tony to take. Steve watched, wondering if Tony would tell her it was too much or simply refuse to take it.
“Sorry,” Clint said but he was still smiling, as was Sarah.
“Better?”
He grabbed his house robe and wrapped it around himself, sliding on his slippers and heading downstairs where he found them all still gathered around the table chatting. Tony didn’t look at him long before his eyes were elsewhere and Steve couldn’t help but frown.
“Tony’s in the living room if you’d like to go see him,” Steve told Clint, feeling bad about making Clint react like that.
“How about we get us all chocolate pudding?”
Clint jerked, startled as the world suddenly went black and then his brain supplied the answers for him. There was something over his face. A mask? A bag? Everything was dark and he was being held by more than one person. They were strong because Clint could barely even squirm in their grasp as he was lifted and carried out.
James reached up and smoothed down a rogue bit of Clint’s hair, his hand coming down to cup his face. His thumb caressed Clint’s cheek as he spoke.
James lifted his hands to his face, sighing angrily into them.
were engaged in racketeering, extortion—without the option of protection that Steve gave, however—and illegal substances. Some were just better and more known for it. The other thing they all offered were termination services but the Russian and Irish excelled in this area. Like when James had found out that the bakery purposefully burned down in Hell’s Kitchen was not the result of some petty gang war, but instead solo criminals, he’d tasked Dmitri to find them and take them out.
They ate for less than five seconds in silence and then Sarah spoke up.
“Give it time,” James told Steve, a hand on his shoulder that moved up to his neck and finally his cheek. He patted it once and then dropped his hand back to his side and into his pocket. Sarah watched him as she entered, saw that the hand was in a fist.
“No, you’re not. The dude let you rail him on the first date. Obviously you’re doing
“Hmm,” Steve said. He knew he was lying. At least partially, but he also knew if he spoke more right now there was a chance everything would come rushing out at once.
“So?” He finally asked after almost running out of breath kissing him. Steve still felt a sense of urgency when it came to being with Tony. He knew he was safe inside the house, it wasn’t that, it was more of a distinct and stabbing fear that Tony would snap out of this and decide it was disgusting and that Steve was too. He had to use every opportunity because he had an irrational fear that someday he would run out of them. “How did he take it?”
After some time—Tony had no way of telling how much—he felt Benni touch his hand.
“Gonna miss you,” Clint said. “Dunno how I’ll survive going back to James’ alien machine coffee.” He grinned when he heard James huff.
“Wow, firefighter by day, fire detective by night. Sexy,” Tony teased, leaning forward quickly to steal another kiss. “Is it important?”
It hurt. It wasn’t the most painful thing ever but it hurt so bad and the sharp stab of pain it had sent throughout his entire body made him feel like he was on the ground while Bakuto’s men circled him, kicking and hitting. The memory of the big guy who had slammed his heavy boot down into the middle of Clint’s shin was making him nauseous and he flinched.
Steve shook his head slowly. “Whatever we do, we do together.”
Steve nodded.
. Dugan shot him.” Sarah nodded slowly.
Seeing Steve blush was one the best things he had ever seen. He made sure to memorize just how deep red the color on his cheeks was and how warm they felt. “I’m yours. All yours and only yours,” he whispered between kisses on Steve’s hot skin.
It was Bruce who spotted him first and went running down scared thinking something had caught on fire and he hadn’t realized.
Tony hummed in agreement and closed his eyes again. Feeling Steve against his body was easily Tony’s favorite feeling he had ever experienced.
“I know,” he said and went to Steve’s side. “What can I do to help?” He asked.
“Monet, Rogers. Rogers, Monet,” James introduced them, adding in Russian for Steve’s sake, “
“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” she said, having afternoon plans of her own. She grabbed her coat and blew them both kisses, heading out.
“Gotta love him. Ugh,” he groaned when Reed Richards came out of the bathroom and headed to his station to get some work done. “
,” James called out and Tony turned, keeping the gun facing forward. That had not been the case the first few times he had been distracted but now he knew better than to point it anywhere else. Hearing that word out of its usual context made Steve tense and send a glare James’ way.
“I am now,” he answered and put his other hand on Steve’s as well. “How are you feeling?” He asked softly, looking at his face, at the bandages and band-aids. He was alright. He would heal.
Soon they would be in France, away from everything bad, just the two of them. They would sleep in as late as they wanted and stay up even later. James would bake bread and Clint would make them drinks and they’d be lazy together. And they’d be together in a world of their own creating. No one around, no one to bother them or catch them. James couldn’t wait.
“I’m angry all the time. Just can’t seem to hit hard enough,” he said, running his thumb over the knuckles of his hand that were still bruised from the sandbag and now from their morning visit. Steve ran his tongue over his teeth in irritation. “Killing Bakuto… I don’t even feel any better.”
Steve filed the phrase away after a few mental practices and then found himself stuck on ‘what I want and what is possible.’ What
he said, filling pastries with strawberry jam.
“I barely remember anything after saying goodnight so I’d wager not long at all,” he said with a grin. His mother rolled her eyes but chuckled.
“Tony,” he said, putting a hand on his shoulder, “you sure you’re tired of doing nothing?” He was only too eager to be given work to do and so Steve told him to get dressed in the suit Sarah got him and meet him in the basement. Sarah and Tony headed upstairs to get him dressed.
Steve smiled back. “I love you too, Tony.”
Steve’s smile widened. “Well,” he began.
“Yes, lieutenant,” they both said at the same time and started making their way with their flashlights through the dark, smoke-filled hallway. Downstairs they could hear the squad team calling out for anyone else who might be home.
“Better now,” Tony answered honestly. “But if you attempt to leave this bed, I will not hesitate to chain you to it.” He went to fill a glass with water, helping him to drink a little. “You should rest.” He pulled the blanket back up over Steve’s body.
“Oh my god,” Clint said, lifting his leg and rolling his ankle around. “I will never take having two unobstructed legs for granted ever again. Everything is better without it.”
“Did James look tired too?” Tony asked, chopping onions quickly and efficiently.
was the sound of his heartbeat in his ears. He stood slowly, spitting blood onto the sidewalk.
“You,” Steve said simply, moving to press kisses to Tony’s neck, nipping lightly here and there, sucking on his collarbone before making his way back up to his jaw. His hand on Tony’s waist had roamed as well, dropping further down to grab a handful of his bottom.
He stopped beside Natalia, so desperate to throw himself in James’ arms but still very much aware that they were in public. It might’ve been his bar and many of the people inside might have been queer in one way or another, but that didn’t mean
Monet held out her hand without hesitation and Steve slipped the ring on, turning her hand to see it from all angles. Yes, he liked this one. He liked it a lot.
They left the store separately, Steve first. He and Dugan exited the same way, accompanied by another employee who was just over the moon to show Mr Rogers out after a hefty purchase. Steve clutched the shopping bag close to him, almost afraid of losing it. It was perfect. It was exactly what he wanted. Sure, it was a little flashy but if he couldn’t show Tony off the way he wanted, he’d give Tony something
“With all due respect, get your Irish ass back in your bed, Cap,” Dugan told him.
Suddenly Steve remembered he wasn’t the only one there. “Dugan? And Jones?” He looked at James and Tony and Sarah, noticing Benni wasn’t there but he would ask about him next.
“Why would I be? It’s Steve.” He shrugged, taking a cloth to wipe down the clean counters just so he could have something to do other than look at Pepper.
“No, Tony,” he said, reaching up, hands in his hair and moving down to hold his face. “In James’ house is where you are safest. My men might think they can come for me but no one’s stupid enough to try James. That’s where I need you. If you’re anywhere else, half of my focus will be worrying about you. If you’re there, I’ll know you’re safe. Please.”
“He was in the storeroom. Fitz came in and Clint didn’t hear it until Fitz touched him.”
.” Tony smiled and hugged her back. It was still something he would need to get used to but there were worse things he had gotten used to over the years. “I will,” he promised sincerely and hugged her again. “
“You know I always do,” Tony said, a little offended but it only served to highlight just how much Rhodey cared about his friend. “I guess this is why you didn’t want me and your firehouse mixing, huh?” he asked, attempting to lighten the mood.
“I… I’m confused.”
His low episodes had been getting fewer and farther in between before Thanksgiving and now ever since Bakuto, they were worse than ever. It’s not like James hadn’t expected it, he had just hoped against hope that it wouldn’t happen. For Clint’s sake.
“Should I call the cops or is there about to be a funny story behind this?” Steve asked, leaning back against the wall, one arm crossed over his chest, the other hand holding the coffee he now sipped.
“No, we got it,” Clint said, gathering up serviettes as best as he could. “But thanks. Stay with sleepyhead.”
. He pulled his hand away from Steve to cover his body with the blanket. “I’m sorry. I know you said you’ve seen me in worse condition. It’s just… I never wanted to go back there. And I know this is no one’s fault but I just hate that it’s a step back.”
“I thought I had.”
“He’s right. With Dugan’s wedding I’ve met my fancy dress quota for the year,” Dmitri added, turning onto William Street down in the Financial District.
Tony rested his head against the couch and tried to think of something to say. Something to talk about. “Have you traveled a lot?”
Tony nodded, pretending to be deeply interested when in reality he really just wanted to ask about one person in particular. “And your captain… what was his name again?”
“And why’s that?” Pepper asked, scooting closer to Tony who hated her for saying those things, for knowing what he felt. The warmth he felt. The fuzziness in his stomach. When he closed his eyes, all he saw was
“Goodnight, Steve,” he replied and took his time to enter the bedroom.
“It is, though this is an unusual situation I find myself in,” he told her.
“Steve... when you do things like that and… say that…” His voice trailed off, too embarrassed to say those words, to say how Steve affected him.
Her hair was shorter now, just to her shoulders. It suited her really well. And even though he saw her often it didn’t feel like nearly often enough and Natalia seemed to feel the same way if her frequency at the bar and Clint and James’ home lately was anything to go by.
“Take us to the hospital,” James said, his fingers in Clint’s hair, his thumb gently stroking his forehead. Clint slowly closed his eyes and drifted off, as did Tony while Steve pressed kisses to his knuckles.
Steve was angry and it was visible in his posture and the way he spoke, his words over-enunciated and his tone abrupt.
“You all are a bunch of animals! Settle down,” Steve told them but he was smiling. He was standing at the head of the table in the firehouse kitchen with his hands raised trying to get his kooky work family to quiet down.
“I was about to ask you that.”
“Well,” James said, kissing Clint and then letting go of his hair and moving back to the stove, “my
“As for you, you barely make any noise when you’re actually
“This is all I know of, I’m sure there are some I don’t.”
“Is he okay?”
“You’re not. Your whore mother was pregnant when we got married. I was stupid enough to marry her while she was pregnant from some italiano bastard.” He laughed again and now it was Steve who tensed up visibly but he did nothing.
,” he swore, trying to reach for the drip again and yelping when he felt his skin tear, looking down at the blood spot growing larger on his bandages and seeping lightly through his hospital gown. “Fucking hell, just t-two minutes, just—“ He closed his eyes, flexing his jaw. His hand was on his middle and he was breathing hard again. It hurt so bad he could just curl up in a corner and cry.
,” he said with a smile, “it means treasure.” He was not even ashamed that he given this grown man a name like that because that was exactly what he felt. Steve was his treasure and he was lucky to have found him.
Lucky eyed Tony, tilting his head to the side and then going to Steve whose scent he remembered, sniffing his leg. Steve reached down and patted him and Lucky licked his hand, going to Clint and leaning his weight against him, again almost throwing him off balance.
They brought him a new bottle of water but no food. That had been the pattern the last few days. Water, no food. The first few days had been at least two meals a day, then it tapered off to one and by the end of week one, Clint was just getting water.
“Just making sure you know that I can look out for myself. Though I appreciate your concern,” he said with a smile. It did make him wonder if this was what Benni felt whenever he protected him. “An instinct is more than knowing or not knowing someone. You don’t have to justify that.” Finally, he took a bite out of his potato.
,” Tony said in Italian, his voice soft and sincere. He rubbed his brother’s back and kissed the top of his head. He was so relieved to finally have him back with him.
He chewed his lip so long it bled a little, thinking, and then he turned to Tony, eyes on him for the first time that night. First time in a long while, actually. “Don’t you think I’m disgusting? An abomination?”
,” Tony told his brother, coaxing him out. “This is Beniamino. Benni, this is Clint. James and he are going to stay with us.”
?!” she nearly screeched into the phone. “Okay, okay,” she said and James knew she was crying. “We’re coming.”
Tony listened intently, eyes fixed on Steve. His hands were rested on Steve’s chest, his thumbs absentmindedly stroking the soft, warm skin available due to his unbuttoned shirt. “That thought has never crossed my mind. Not even once.” He lowered his voice and a small grin formed on his lips. “You want to be my only one?”
Even despite kissing him when he woke, he still felt alright about the night. Sleeping curled up next to him, breathing in how he smelled and having him run his fingers along Steve’s neck. It… it did something to Steve. Something awful. It gave him hope. Hope that was crushed when Tony talked about going to meet Pepper and Steve was firmly put back in his place.
They discussed their business and how it was going or not going, in some cases. The Chinese were still doing well with heroin and opium production. The Harlem gang’s monopoly on crack and weapons had their business booming.
“Always so dramatic,” James laughed, shaking his head. “I don’t have long today. There’s business I need to attend to, so talk.”
“So were you,” James said, flinching internally at the memory of Steve’s cries the days following his first. “Just keep an eye on him.”
“I was about to wake you,” he heard Sarah say. It took some effort to turn around and focus on her but eventually he managed. “Dinner will be ready in an hour. How about Benni and you take a bath, get changed and come down to the kitchen, hm?”
“That was fast,” Steve said while Tony adjusted his simple grey shirt.
What was he doing?
“Well, maybe since you’re here, Mr Romanov, sir, you could take a look at some of our business dealings,” Clint said a little louder than necessary and James assumed it was for the few busybodies roundabout.
“Okay,” he said and continued talking about Ireland.
“The only reason I never fought back was because that son of—” He took a deep breath. “Because
Dmitri started, surprised.
Dmitri was the one who answered the phone, Steve and James both visibly tensing as the color drained from Dmitri’s face and he held out the phone.
“Because of who I am. And who you are. And because...” He sighed heavily. “I have no experience.” Before getting out of the situation he was in, he had no life. And it had never bothered him until he realized what he missed out on.
“Rogers,” Falsworth called, “get yer disgusting self out of that car.”
“Fine. But promise me you will talk to me?” She held his good hand and he nodded. Suddenly he realized he was still in his suit and Pepper seemed to notice that at the same time.
“So date went well, you asked him out again,” Rhodey said and Steve took notice of the fact that these weren’t questions. “You like him?” Steve nodded. “Alright, then I feel obligated to say that Tony Stark is my
Tony blew air out of his nose, impressed and happy that Steve remembered. “I’ve always loved understanding how things work and I really like cars. Older cars, especially. That’s what we deal with mostly. Restorations, customizations, and modifications. Not really the oil change or tire rotation kind of garage.”
persuasion tactics.
“Friendship? So that’s what we’re calling it.”
James and Clint listened attentively, James’ arm wrapped around Clint and Clint’s head on James’ shoulder. Maria reached the punchline and they all laughed, even Dmitri up front was chuckling along, glancing back in the mirror to see all of the smiling faces in the dim light.
“Are you scared of me?” Steve asked, his tone definitely bordering on disbelief.
“How,” he asked, the word ringing out in the room. There was more force behind it than he intended, his temper not something he was good at controlling.
They were led inside towards the back and through some heavy curtains that completely separated the front of the restaurant from the space they now entered. There were a few tables there but they were seated at a large one by a window. A man took their coats and furs, not even offering them the little ticket in order to reclaim them. Clint almost spoke up when James shook his head.
Steve looked at her for a long few seconds before nodding and thanking her. He brought his hands up to his face and sighed into them and it turned into a yawn.
Steve had never been so attracted to someone in his life but a part of him wanted to do this right, especially since he’d realized that this could never be a one night stand. They had already called each other to talk twice more since arranging their date three days ago and Steve knew now that the butterflies he’d had on the first date were the jitters. The ones he had now were feelings.
“You’ve gotten so much better at everything,
Natalia knew Clint better than anyone and today, James was finally feeling the full impact of his jealousy over that fact. Normally he was just happy that there was someone out there who understood Clint and from whom he could get advice on how to be a better partner in his relationship with him. Right now, he sorely wished that
Clint’s good eye went to Tony the moment he registered movement, took in his words, but he couldn’t respond just yet to any of it. He eyed the food and water, the severity of the situation seeming to only just now sink in.
Clint had fallen asleep not long after they’d gotten situated, a drink poured for each of them, changed into comfortable clothing, the fire roaring beside them, keeping them nice and toasty.
“Ah, there ya are.” Pepper smiled. “Got me worried there for a minute.” He turned to look at her and sighed again.
“You’re in a cage and you th—”
Clint chuckled. “I could see that. Steve strikes me as the dramatic type.” Clint held his own cup out for more coffee and Tony refilled it. “You’ve got a friend other than me? I am shocked and, quite frankly, heartbroken. Congrats to them even though they don’t know me.”
“Don’t get all in your head and screw things up. He’s gonna say yes,” Bucky told him.
“Yeah, you go take yourself to the kitchen, ya tease,” he said, watching Tony walk off and boy, did he like watching him leave, especially given that he was putting on a little show for Steve with those illegal hips of his. Steve shook his head and looked down to give the documents one final read-through before getting up to file them away.
“What do you mean?”
“Same.” He put the menu down. “Sorry, just wanted to get some of the less interesting small talk out of the way. So, tell me about Steve Rogers,” Tony said, lifting his wine and taking a sip, watching Steve over the rim.
. It’ll heal.” He leaned up to kiss Steve’s lips gently. “How are you doing?”
“Nice bird ya got yerself, lad.” Falsworth grinned as they drove back to the office.
Clint sang, his voice deep and raspy but nice.
They decided they would walk to the cinema seeing as Benni was full of energy and needed an outlet. Apparently fresh air helped with healing too, or so Sarah insisted. She ended up walking with Benni, telling him stories about fairies who would hide in the snow and play with kids who dared to believe in them. Steve walked next to Tony, his hat hiding half his face probably for his own protection. He hoped that Steve didn’t see him earlier, hear what his brother told his mom. Even though he didn’t know what it was and what exactly happened when he went far away—as Maria would call it—he thought it was embarrassing. Just one more thing that made him weak and vulnerable. At the same time he wanted to tell Steve about, talk to him like they had the night before. In private. Alone.
It was almost a good three hours before Steve woke up again. His mouth was dry and he felt like he’d been hit squarely in the face. His lower abdomen was killing him and he pulled the collar of the hospital gown away from him to look into it and see fresh bandages. He had a foggy memory of what happened but enough to know he owed Tony a hell of an apology.
“Twenty-two,” he corrected, finishing the one in his hand before she could take it. He pushed the plate towards Benni, getting up to pour him a glass of milk. “There you go, pet,” he said, echoing his mother as he patted Benni’s head gently and took his seat again. He only slightly ignored Tony or at least, avoided his eyes a bit.
“Over here,” Bucky hissed, catching a glimpse of a black hoodie and blue jeans disappearing out the back doors.
Tony stayed like that, wanting Steve to release at least some of the tension he was holding. And for selfish reasons because he missed hugging him. That one, of course, didn’t matter at all. Well, maybe not as much as the first one.
looked worse. Steve’s light eyes were troubled and James looked exhausted.
He knew James had picked up on it and a part of him hated himself for being so weak though a teeny, tiny little voice in his head was sometimes able to pipe up and remind him that what he was experiencing was normal and didn’t make him a failure. That voice had been quiet lately.
“We should’ve done better,” James muttered angrily. He should’ve argued harder with Clint that morning, not letting him out of the house with anything short of a militia following at his heels. “They deserved better from us.”
Tony collected the papers, not caring for the right order. How he just wanted to toss them on the floor and leave. Instead he took them back to the others and threw them onto a pile, letting himself fall on the couch.
Tony considered that for a second and then pulled his phone out of his pocket. He looked up at Rhodey, the question all over Tony’s face.
Clint turned to Tony. “I told you before, Lucky’s a sweetheart. Besides, he’ll mostly just be in our room or on my lap. I… when?” He looked from Steve to James to Tony.
Each man went to his respective partner, crouching down in front of him and pulling them into their arms.
“Listen, way I see it, there’s
James helped him into the kitchen and Lucky followed behind them curiously, curling up underneath Clint’s chair, the dog’s nose pressed against the side of his foot and his casted foot propped up on a pillow on another chair.
Of course it was too good to be true and he knew it. Even on Howard’s good days Tony ended up with fresh wounds and bruises.
“Of course I’ll teach you. We can start with five words a day. You’re already learning Irish, don’t want it to be too much,” James said, petting Benni’s hair.
Clint had his head leaned back, trying to slow the flow of blood trickling out of his nose. He lifted his hand to his face, looking over at Tony who looked like he was saying something but it didn’t seem to be for Clint so he looked away.
.” He gently poked his index finger into Steve’s chest right above his heart.
That holiday away with Tony somewhere remote was sounding nicer and nicer as the day dragged on. He couldn’t believe this morning he had approached Clint at the diner. It felt like the day had dragged on for a week.
“I’ll go,” Clint said, wanting just a little alone time with James first. He was comfortable with Tony and Sarah, Steve was still a pending relationship, and Benni was to be confirmed. “We can go after lunch.”
Tony bit the inside of his cheek, telling himself for the hundredth time in the last couple of minutes that this wasn’t targeted at him. This wasn’t even his Steve. “You say and do whatever you need to. Get it out of your system. Throw it all at me, Steve. I don’t care. I will not leave you.” He walked to the drip and rolled it out of reach from Steve. “And you’ve had more than enough for now.”
He washed his hands and continued with the dinner preparations and the dessert. “How many siblings do you have?”
“I just hope you’ll like it,” Steve said, grabbing Tony’s hand and pressing a kiss to his knuckles. “I have one last errand to run this afternoon and then I’m all yours. It’s only a quick one and then tomorrow it’ll be just us for a while.”
“Not at all,” Steve said, looking over at James who nodded to confirm it as well and then back at Tony, taking both of Tony’s hands between his. “In all honesty—”
to me.” He knew it still happened to James too but that also wasn’t totally his business to share. “You’ve got a lot going on. A lot to manage. It’s not easy.”
“If you’re wondering how much longer you’ll be here, just remember you put
Clint slid in and met eyes with Dmitri, giving him another joyless smile but at least it was something. He felt like such a burden.
Despite himself, he kept glancing at Tony. Sometimes turning his head slightly, sometimes just his eyes sliding over. He allowed himself a small portion of freedom—look but not touch. Tony needed a friend right now, not more, and he might not ever need Steve as that ‘more’ anyway.
Tony welcomed him home and that struck a chord in Steve. Even if he hadn’t meant it that way it was something wonderful to hear him say ‘home’. When he looked away, Steve shot his mother a look who shrugged and stretched, standing up and announcing that she would be turning in for the night.
James’ smile grew wider. “You
James chuckled and then smiled his signature terrifying smile. “We could have just killed the detail but it’s fun to catch him when he’s asleep. Trust me.”
Steve barked out a laugh. “I’m not so sure ma would agree with that.” He dropped the book onto his lap and took Tony’s hand instead, the smile gone already. He looked up at him. “It’s not you, ya know. You’ve just done so much to make things more bearable for me, I can’t stand to seem ungrateful.”
Tony reminded his little brother but kissed the top of his head. “There’s more dessert in the kitchen.” He sat down close to Steve on the couch, sandwiched between him and Clint.
Steve snorted. “You never were one for small talk.” He reached into his desk and pulled out both. “Okay.”
“Hm,” James said. “It’s a little too convenient for my liking.” He turned to Tony. “You just
James gave him the details and waited until he was told it worked at which time he immediately hung up and looked up into the wide eyes of his absolute favorite person.
“How does it feel?”
too long if he couldn’t do something as simple as—
“You hungry?”
The small window was up too high for Tony to reach or look out from. The door was locked and even if it wasn’t, there probably wasn’t anywhere for him to go, which also meant that he would have to make peace with his current situation. There was no way that Steve wasn’t already looking for him. It was only a matter of time before he got Tony out of wherever he was.
“So I drink when I’m stressed. You eat,” he accused, pointing at the tiny bite of muffin left in Steve’s hands and the other two he had sitting in his lap. Steve laughed. “So did you want to keep crying or should we get a head start on the day?”
“Steve’s eyes were also the second thing I noticed about him.” It was nice to think about his eyes. “Neither James nor Steve are always what their job is. They’re fun and easy to be around when they’re not being dramatic or fighting.”
Clint turned to James, confusion written on his face. “I’m not really super mobile and he doesn’t like to leave, whaddyou—”
Tony pressed his back more against the wall behind him and hugged his knees to his chest.
“Dmitri and I had narrowed it down to two possible people—Fisk or Bakuto. Neither of them particularly like Steve and myself. Fisk is a child and his issue was with Steve encroaching on his territory. He hates me because I always shut him up when he mentions it. Though Bakuto is different,” James explained.
“There you are. You look nice.” Tony smiled.
“I don’t know. He wouldn’t say and I didn’t want to risk it.”
Steve shook his head. He didn’t want to go home. He wanted their conversation to go on away from Tony and Clint. He didn’t want them hearing and James felt the same.
“We didn’t specify a date. Just exchanged numbers, he said we should get something to eat sometime.”
Steve came back over to the couch, glancing at the door quickly and then deciding
Steve scooted over, pulling Tony into his arms, thankful he was shot on the other side. He pressed a kiss into his hair. “Of course I will. It’ll be my favorite part of the—”
Steve exhaled heavily, dragging a hand down his face and wishing for Tony’s incredibly strong and perfectly made Italian coffee. “Queens is too damn big.”
Sarah didn’t say anything, too terrified for her son, her heart nearly beating out of her chest. “I’ll wait for the boys to get back and go talk to James.”
That question mixed with the relief he felt over having told Benni, made Tony laugh genuinely.
When he pulled away from Tony, he looked over at Clint who had been watching him with a soft smile. Steve’s hand movement had caught his eye. Clint rarely missed anything happening around him but lately he had been almost annoyingly observant of everything.
Steve and James exchanged a look.
Sam, Bucky, and Steve stopped at a pizza shop on their way home to pick up an easy dinner, worn out from another day of serious calls. In the winter it was mostly ice-related calls, spring and fall saw a lot of the construction site issues, and summers were children trapped in cars and, when the fires got really bad, temperatures soaring into the hundreds.
dinner courtesy of Sarah, which I appreciate since she was a very Catholic woman,” James explained. “I think the idea that her son is considered an abomination has made her a little less devout though.”
Feeling warm and all things positive from what Steve said, Tony smiled back at him until he heard him say those words.
They hugged briefly and then Steve left to peek into the boys’ room and make sure all was still well, saying he would be back down to walk James all the way out. Sarah walked James down into the basement, reaching out to link her arm with his as they descended the stairs.
Howard seemed nervous. Good, as he should be. Steve didn’t know much about the man but his reputation for his explosive temper and drinking habits had not escaped being whispered throughout the community and all whispers eventually made it back to Steve.
“Now, honestly, do you need anything?”
He looked over his notes from the whole evening. So the Chinese were running heroin and opium, laundering money and counterfeiting it and other valuables. The Italians had most of the police force under their control and high-up political connections, keeping elections rigged and things right where they all wanted them. No goody-two-shoes mayor was going to come in and try to clean up the crime in the city. That’s what these meetings were for, to keep the crime organized and stamp out what wasn’t. If there was anything happening or that had been witnessed and the activity did not belong to one of the six groups there, it was eliminated and that’s why James had asked his follow-up questions at the end.
Steve woke up in a cold sweat, covering his face with his hands and breathing in and out slowly to calm his racing heart. He wasn’t sure how many it had been but if he had to guess he would say that was somewhere around the thirtieth nightmare he had had about Tony. That one had even involved Clint.
“We wouldn’t be near the
Clint startled, dragging his pajama sleeve across his watery eyes and only sparing a quick glance in Steve’s direction. “Positive.”
“That doesn’t even matter. Only you matter,” James told him firmly.
“Hey, Tony,” James said to get Clint’s attention and Clint turned to look at him, his eyes immediately locking on the bandages. “We’re—”
“You’re screwing with me. You did not just eat and then walk him home, Steve. That guy practically radiates ‘good in bed’ and seemed to really like you.”
Steve shook his head. “No, but thank you, Dugan. Where’s Tony?” Dugan checked his watch.
tw: brief instance of captive torture but the scene cuts before anything actually happens
“Lunch and then cookies sound good,” Clint said with a careful smile. He was becoming less sure that he wanted to sacrifice his privacy but it
James snorted, shaking his head fondly. “You’re a mess.” Clint grinned and James kissed him smack on the mouth. “My mess.”
“What’s it to you?” he asked. The past weeks he hadn’t had anyone to talk to. It felt awkward to talk now, almost like he forgot how it worked.
, are you going to ask him out?”
Tony stared at Clint when he protected him. Steve protecting and looking out for him was one thing but to have another tall blond guy doing the same thing was just funny to him.
Did you go home?”
Benni took great delight in having to help his brother cut the meat for him, teasing him in Italian because he could. Tony didn’t react to the teasing and just thanked him for helping. It was too difficult to eat with the fork in his left hand. Seeing how quiet and neat the others ate, Tony wondered if they would mind. When everyone was still alive and well, there was always a lot of talking and laughter at the table, even if Howard disapproved. Maria loved to hear everything their kids wanted to share with her. It felt nice to be around others again and see his little brother behaving quite well too. Tony had to hold himself back from eating too fast. He felt like he was starving, probably looked like that too. The food was so delicious that he could have eaten everything on the table there and then.
“It’ll heal. It always does,” he said and managed to smile at her. He didn’t like that Benni heard all those things. If he had to, he would take a beating like that any day if it kept him safe. “Will you stay for a bit?” It was mainly so he could spend time with Benni without having to worry about Howard, chores, or anything else.
“Howard Stark, know him?” James nodded.
“Why can’t I come with you on vacation?” Benni asked after a very intense play session with the dog. They were both on the floor near the fireplace, watching the flames.
Steve looked back down at his notes. The Japanese were still human-trafficking and gambling, the casinos belonged to them and they were known to fix races for personal gain. The Harlem mafia was working with cocaine and weapons.
Steve laughed. “He’s a good guy.”
, he told himself.
“You do?”
Steve chuckled. “You really—” yawn “—wanna risk wakin’ her up so early just to tell her I’m still up? Yer dancin’ on the fine line ‘tween bravery an’ stupidity.” He scooted further onto the bed. It was big enough that he didn’t worry about crowding Tony. “But she’d prob’ly say somethin’ about me needin’ta sleep,” he added, knowing his sentences were starting to border on repetition and nonsense but he didn’t care.
“No, not really. I… I didn’t—” He needed to take a break and collect his thoughts before he continued. “I was too busy to ever think about things like that. Once that was out of the way, it became clear.”
Would Steve prefer that? Just escape from everything? Maybe another time but that wasn’t who he was. He didn’t back down from a fight. He and Sarah were stubborn that way, determined others might call it.
“In my defense, I live in the exact same apartment two buildings that way.”
“I know. I hate kids.”
strenuous,” he told him and Tony looked disappointed. “But I could use an errands man. You won’t have to go out in the cold, mainly just running things between myself and the boys, maybe a little organizing and researching. You’ll be in my office with me.”
“So beautiful,” Steve praised. “And such a good boy for me,” he added more quietly, leaning to kiss Tony’s shoulder. “Everything alright?”
He snuggled up closer to the person he was holding, tilting his head up to press a kiss to the jaw he found.
“You should talk less. You can’t murder someone with words,” James said, entering the alleyway.
“I’m fine,
“Mr Rogers told me to give this to you,” he said and turned to leave. Nothing good could come out of this. Tony was frantically thinking about how much money he had saved and if that could be enough to get away. He was almost at the door leading to their apartment when he heard Howard tell Pepper to head out for the day. Good Lord, Tony didn’t even know if his brother was home yet or not. He couldn’t leave without him. Before Tony even reached the top of the stairs he was pulled back by his shirt, which ripped at the sheer force. Howard threw him onto the stairs, his knee burying into his stomach.
“The food was really good,” Tony said as he washed the dishes and smiled at James. He looked different. Or was it only the way Tony saw him now that he was with Steve? Whatever it was, James seemed different. “I’m guessing there won’t be anything to do at the office for me. Anything I can help you around with?”
