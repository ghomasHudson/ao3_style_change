In this river, in the caress of the water between his fingers, in Steve and Stella talking about feelings of belonging to a system of humans who hurt and laugh and cry and die and live and love, Tony finds his mother again.
If only they had got together sooner. Not even right after they met, but at least a few years ago. If Tony had seen the signs before. If Steve had done something, said something,
“All done,” Steve says, smiling again, closing his eyes when Tony brushes his fingers through Steve’s hair. It’s so soft.
And Steve can only marvel at how easy it is to love Tony now that he knows he’s loved back: before, everything felt confusing, and complicated, and impossible, but now, this seems like the most effortless thing to do.
“Fuck,” Tony says, grinding down on Steve and feeling him half-hard already. He braces himself on Steve’s stomach to rub against him more, but he’s just lying there, hands to his sides, and very, very still.
And now he’s here, alone, with a baby girl that smells like him and Steve, and he doesn’t know what to do.
in the middle of the street, and he’s friends with Manuela who works at the Relais, and that kid in San Gimignano who told him he was a hero—the only bit Steve understood of that whole conversation.
Tony wants to say something reassuring, but the only thing he can think of is wildly inappropriate and rampantly vulgar, so it comes straight out of his mouth.
Still, Tony hasn’t shared the good news with any of his friends, and if anyone asked him why, he wouldn’t know what to say.
Tony lowers the visor attached to the roof of the car and slides Steve’s drawing into the pocket there.
He kicks the sheet off and stretches out between Tony’s legs, stomach down. He nudges Tony’s thighs apart and he drags his hips down.
Steve is sitting on one of the couches in the library. It’s not late, but the sky is already completely dark, and Steve has the lamp on. Light and shadow chase each other over his face and make him look like a chiaroscuro study. He’s reading something, a novel. He’s wearing gray sweatpants and a white t-shirt. Tony looks at himself, and the only thing that’s different is that his t-shirt is black.
“And I’ve done it. And I’ve watched you, these last few days, I’ve watched you, and listened to you, and talked with you, and shared everything with you—even my mother’s past, even the closest thing to a parent I have left on this earth.
He had almost given up hope. But now it’s here, rushing into him like a current, making his skin prickle with the sheer joy it brings him.
He’s completely still. His hands have gone limp. Tony takes one, cups his own ass with it. “You want this too, right? You did, the other day. Just think about it. Just like that night. You’re gonna come deep inside me. Nice and hot. I’m gonna let you.”
Bucky reaches out to rest a hand on his shoulder. Tony simply looks at it. Bucky has never touched him.
They do it. They kick me to the floor when they’re done and they do it. They piss on me, all twelve of them. They spit on me.
It’s made with a simple pencil this time. It’s Tony, again, wearing a chef hat and holding a wooden spoon. There’s a kitchen in the background, just outlined, and the words
Tony puts a fork on the table, then rests a hand on the wooden surface, makes Steve look up. Tony’s gaze is stern.
Bucky tries not to laugh. “I need to do this on my own terms right now, and you gotta promise me you’ll let me.”
Steve takes his fingers out of Tony, carefully, and slicks himself up, for good measure. If this hurts Tony in any way Steve is gonna punch himself in the face. Steve rubs the head of his cock between Tony’s cheeks, hisses softly when it brushes over the rim. Slowly, timidly, he slides in. Tony spreads his legs further apart, drawing his knees up to his chest. Steve sinks into Tony’s body and is engulfed by the
He wraps her up in a blanket and steps into the elevator. He presses the button to the clinic. The pediatrician should still be there; the nursery for Stark Industries employees is still open. And he’s a Stark Industries employee. Technically.
They put the crates in the trunk of Stella’s car, so she can take them to her friend tomorrow. Tony spots her on the steps outside the front door.
“Thank you,” he says when Tony’s finished, and they sit at the kitchen table. “Can you tell someone to take care of my clothes later in the morning? They’re in the washing machine.”
, Steve’s brain is just useless. Tony’s hands aren’t small but his fingers can barely circle around his own dick and Steve’s, and
Steve would go down on Tony, lick at him, like they have all the time in the world. He would produce a bottle of lube from a hidden drawer in the coffee table, then coat his fingers and start pressing them into Tony, searching for his prostate. He would rub at it until he had coaxed Tony’s cock to hardness, as much as possible.
Tony wakes up early, the first rays of sunshine making their way into the bedroom. The light hits Steve’s hair and makes it gleam, makes it look like gold, like he’s the sun itself. And he is. He is the center of Tony’s life.
“Right, remember that time I gave Ross the middle finger and fucked off to help my dumbass friend and if discovered I would’ve had to, and I quote, ‘arrest myself’? Oh, wait! That was actually you!”
Two minutes ago, Tony was sleeping. Now, he’s stuffed full with Steve’s huge and rock-hard cock, last night’s come oozing out of him, trickling down his thighs and on the sheets.
“You know, emotions… a lot of them, can’t be helped. We feel how we feel and that’s it. Nothing to do about it. But we don’t always act according to our emotions, do we? Sure, most of the time we do, and that’s normal. But sometimes… sometimes we go against everything our heart wants, and we follow the brain. We make choices out of logic, not feelings.”
When Tony is ready, they go to the restaurant. They barely talk. Tony looks at all the wine exposed on the oak shelves, and tells himself that water is just fine with pappardelle al ragù di cinghiale.
Tony sits back down on his chair. “It’s not that I don’t believe you. It’s just not... what I need.”
“I remember you coming in here. Telling me I had your permission to—” a sob cuts him off, but he sighs and continues. “Then I got my knot in you and I’m jacking you off on the floor. I have no idea what happened in between.”
Tony swallows. He doesn’t like to think this much about Howard or talk about him, especially with Steve, who remembers a very different man from the one Tony knew.
He opens his mouth and he lets Steve push past his lips. He’s very careful about it, slow, considerate. He holds himself at the base to keep from shaking when he’s welcomed into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth, and Tony can feel Steve’s other hand delicately caress the side of his stretched out lips, the bulge in his cheek, the side of his head.
Steve can’t feel Tony’s presence next to him anymore, and turns to look for him. He stopped walking (again) in the middle of the street, and he’s reading something on his phone, eyes wide behind his glasses and a worried frown on his forehead.
“Yes. That night. Remember when we were on the couch, and you were… you were, uh, on top of me. And you kissed me.” The way Steve asks this makes Tony pause—like Steve really thinks Tony could ever forget even a single gesture, a single word, from that night. Like he really has no idea that those moments are seared in Tony’s mind forever.
Tony fucks himself on Steve ruthlessly, viciously, and lets Steve go so deep, too deep, it’s too damn much—
“Tony, I… the part at the end of the letter was true, if you need me, I’ll be there for you. I’ll always be there for you.”
“I’m sorry we made you feel like that. That I made you feel like that. But we’ll find a way, Tony. This threat is bigger than us, than our personal issues. We’ll stand together against it no matter what, I’m sure of it.”
It will be brief, this respite. The next wave of the rut will be stronger, he’ll be less able to think. The succeeding one, he already knows, will be the one where he’ll lose it all the way.
He feels a sharp jolt of pain at the sides of his chest, above his ribs. He tries to relax his muscles, keep his shoulders down, straighten his posture. He takes a couple of deep breaths and it goes away.
Steve licks his lips, his eyes lowered to look at Tony’s lap, but he’s not really seeing it. “Remember the night we made love and…” he trails off, shakes his head. “Sorry. Had sex, the night we had sex…” Steve looks like he doesn’t want to say it anymore, whatever it was he wanted to say.
Tony stops moving at some point, his gaze lost into nothing. He’s thinking. It’s not the first time this happens. Steve waits.
Tony gets up from the wall to place himself in front of Steve, standing between his knees. Steve places a hand on Tony’s ribs and looks at his chest, where he knows the reactor is.
“Then they’re perfect,” replied Tony, and Pepper, who was about to leave, came back and sat next to him, took off her heels, and stole Tony’s curly fries.
He’s choking on it and he doesn’t care, he just wants this, all of this, all of Tony—him doing all the work and fucking into Steve’s mouth from above him, pressing the tip of a spit-slick finger into Steve and—
He doesn’t want to think about it now, though, so he coats his fingers with lube and begins rubbing it between Steve’s cheeks, pushing just the tip of his thumb inside to test things out.
Eventually they stumble back to the bed, falling into it in a tangle of limbs. Steve guides Tony up on all fours, fucks into him again, and without even realizing he’s doing it, he slaps his hand against Tony’s ass.
“It reminds me,” he says, and he rests his palm on his opposite side, on the bruise. “Reminds me of our night.”
He was the better version of himself in that moment, when he spent himself in Tony’s body and was on the receiving end of his beautiful, beautiful kisses.
, and Tony doesn’t know how much of it is Steve’s typical impatience and how much is due to how fast his mind processes information.
Something pulses horribly in his head, the empty space preparing itself to welcome a bond that Tony knows will never arrive. It’s worse than other times, it’s worse than any other time because this time Tony was really hoping… He was… No, no. He refuses to acknowledge the sharp pain it gives him, and feeds on it at the same time, lets this want spill out of him in a river of grief until he can turn his attention to something else.
It’s a weird thing, probably, but Tony likes the way Steve eats. He’s been educated well, but he can’t always hide his excitement. Despite the trauma of the war, Steve seems to have found a way to enjoy food. He always eats everything in his plate, even stuff he doesn’t like much, because it’s food, and you eat all the food you can get whenever you can get it. But Tony can tell when Steve really loves how something tastes. Tonight, for example.
In every drop of sweat, in every soft touch and whispered word, in every shallow breath and deep kiss, in Tony’s tears, in his soft dick and his jokes about his age, in their quick understanding of each other, in their smiles and playful banter, in every careful explanation, in every tiny hesitation that disappears when one hand holds the other, when their eyes meet, in all of that– there’s love.
Tony gasps with every bob of Steve’s head, with every push of his fingers, and eventually comes in Steve’s mouth, for the second time in the span of only a few hours.
Tony moans, says, “St— Steve, I—,” and Steve knows. He hasn’t always known, but he knows now and will know it forever.
Steve passes him his washcloth and soap, and soon Tony is scrubbing his skin clean while Steve massages shampoo on Tony’s scalp. After, Steve quickly rubs body wash all over himself, then Tony makes him sit on the bench and washes his hair. His shoulder aches at some point, but he ignores it. He must do a poor job of hiding the discomfort from his face though, because when they dry off and are dressing in the bedroom, Steve goes back into the bathroom for a moment to retrieve Tony’s body lotion.
He clutches the phone in his hand, careful not to break it. He’s always careful not to break things. The only time he wasn’t, he got Tony lying on the hard cold floor of a HYDRA compound, the arc reactor powering his suit shattered beyond recognition, just like their friendship.
“I wanted to say,” Steve starts, interrupting Tony. He swallows, scratches his forehead. He pushes his hair back. “I wanted to...”
Tony is staring back up at him, so intense he seems intent to make up for all those times when he refused to look at Steve as if it might burn him, scar him forever; now it’s as though looking at Steve is everything that has ever mattered to him, everything that has ever had any consequence at all in the world, like Steve is the solution to every problem, the answer to every question, the cure for all his aches. Being the focus of this kind of attention makes Steve’s head spin.
They talk for a while. There are long apologies, careful explanations, a few jokes and a couple more missteps, but in the end there’s even understanding, and maybe—who knows—forgiveness.
Tony panics. He tries to understand if he’s about to die or if there’s simply something wrong with his eyes, but he can’t.
Tony drags a hand across his face, over his mouth. At this point, he doesn’t even notice the tears. Crying is just something that happens and can’t be helped, like sweating.
When Tony opens his eyes it’s not raining anymore. Sunshine is streaming into the room, and it’s warm again, but not too much—it’s still early enough in the morning, and there’s a lot of humidity left in the air.
“Barnes is your priority, I get that.” He sighs. “I thought we were friends. You said we weren’t. My mistake. Sorry if I ever… made you uncomfortable. Wasn’t my intention.”
He’s fed me for months. He’s washed bodily fluids from my skin and my hair without so much as a flinch. He must have mopped up gallons of blood—my blood—from the floors.
“Nah, don’t worry. I barely slept at all, the whole night. Shit,” Tony rubs his eyes, presses his face into Steve’s chest, breathes him in. “We missed last night,” he whispers after a while.
“So if you want to, I don’t know, think about him, or send him some, uh, good thoughts, or even a, a prayer, I guess… I don’t know. I don’t know what, but if you want, that could be—”
He has a beard. His hair is longer, like when he first got out of the ice, but now it’s combed towards the back. He’s wearing a black t-shirt and a black hoodie, black jeans, black boots. He has a black duffle bag to match Tony’s.
Steve wants to cry, or scream, or throw himself off a tall building and see if that, at least, will hurt more than this.
that mention the castle, with avid and raw interest—like he can’t get enough, like he wants to see everything
“I need you to say it, Steve,” Tony insists, but Steve doesn’t know what Tony wants him to say, what is it, whatever, it doesn’t matter, just, just—skin tongue slick fuck knot hole bond bite mate mine—
By six in the morning they’re usually both awake. Steve doesn’t need much sleep thanks to the serum, and for Tony it’s more a mixture of lifelong bad habits and age. Steve likes to start the day by sucking Tony off, likes to have the ghost of Tony’s taste down his throat for the rest of the day. This, too, needs to be slow, Tony needs time to get hard(
After a few minutes of complete silence, Steve says, “I signed the Accords, you know. The new version.”
Steve doesn’t know how to respond. He wishes he could touch Tony, show him how he feels in a way that doesn’t require Steve to say things, that doesn’t force him to make sense of his scattered thoughts and adapt them to the constricting limits of human language. He wishes he could paint for Tony, that he could translate his confession into colors, and be understood.
“Did you just come so hard you passed out?” He asks, and he probably wants to sound angry, but it ends up being just concerned and kind of impressed.
“I know where I’m gonna find it, Tony,” Steve interrupts him with a smile. “I’ll be back in a couple of hours, that enough? I can stay out more if you want.”
I know why they took my fingers. They want to see if they will grow back. They won’t, but I stare at the bloody gauze and I can’t find any feeling of loss inside me.
But Tony really seems normal. He looks at Steve when he talks to him, passes him fruit during breakfast, discusses tactics with him like they’ve done thousands of other times before, they talk about the team, about improvements for their weapons, about the last super villain that really thought he was gonna rule the planet starting from Manhattan, about movies and books and food and everything. So what if Steve can’t sleep at night, thinking about Tony’s skin on his? What if he can still feel Tony’s tongue on his neck, the scent of his come, his hand on his dick? What if he sometimes thinks,
Steve is mesmerized by Tony, how beautiful he looks like this, with Steve’s fingers disappearing into his body, his skin flushed, one hand fisting the sheets and the other searching frantically for Steve’s. Steve grabs it, kisses its back, lets Tony hold onto him.
Steve carries him to the bathroom, passes a wet towel down between Tony’s cheeks. Then he fills the tub with hot water, helps Tony in and settles behind his back.
Tony looked down at his plate, pushing his food around with his fork. "What was it like...with the two of you? I mean...I wasn't really there for you back then...", he mumbled, not meeting Steve's eyes.
Sometimes he was screaming when he woke up, sometimes he was crying, sometimes he was just empty, like he was trapped in the void between sleep and being awake. Sometimes Wade was in his room, sometimes Tony, depending on how loud he was, who heard him first.
Peter laid his head back to look at Wade and Wade quickly had to school his expression back to his regular face. "I don't want to die, though. I need you to know that. Not right now." He seemed sincere and it was embarrassing how relived Wade was.
Okay, I'll try to bring you the next half of this chapter as quickly as possible. I'm not super experienced in writing action so it might take a bit but I'm very excited and I hope you're, too.
Once the movie ended MJ lifted her head off his shoulder and they both sat in silence as the credits rolled.
"We have to do the treatment, Tony. Consider it one less thing you need to worry about. Without HYDRA's conditioning none of you have to worry about him getting activated again. Afterwards you'll have all the time in the world to patch him up. "
"Okay, no, that came out wrong. Steve is amazing, I love him, he's my best friend... It's just... before the war his and my relationship was...simpler? Maybe because we were both simpler men back then. It was as easy as breathing. Now, with all the time that's passed and all the things that happened to the both of us... it's just more complicated.", Bucky explained. He didn't sound bitter or anything but there was a profound sense of sadness in his voice. One that he didn't seem to let out a lot around Peter. Maybe because he didn't trust Peter with it, didn't think that he could handle it or just didn't want to let it out himself.
"Ripped apart, no no, drown me out, can't show, pull me down, so low, still won't break, bend though.", it was non sensical, Peter knew that, but he had heard Gwen sing the words so often, they were scorched into his mind. Now they spilled out of his mouth on repeat as his heart became a panicked bird once more.
"I'm not.", Wade replied honestly, making a point to uphold a calm demeanour. No reason to get heated, one emotional wreck would be problem enough.
"Shut up!", she snapped before punching him again and again and the whole time Peter just laid there taking it.
"Why are you awake?", Steve asked, trying to break the tension. Peter and him never really warmed up to each other, then again, Peter had trouble warming up to everyone. But still, they were never really alone, never without Tony or Wade, this was a first.
"There are CDs in my backpack. You can pick one.", Wade said and since Peter didn't know any musicians anyways he just chose the first CD he got between his fingers and put it in.
"They shouldn't have called you. I'm fine.", he spat and Wade almost laughed out. Instead he got up and his movement was apparently enough of a threat to get Peter to look at him again.
"Not if it means hurting you.", he replied and she smashed his head against the floor, almost making him pass out from the impact.
Peter glanced at his phone to check the time. He'd meet MJ on the parking lot in 15 minutes. "Alright, I think I should go now.", he announced and he hated how nervous he sounded. They were just watching a movie,  why was he so nervous?
"Are you trying to guilt-trip me?", he asked and Peter shrugged again, continuing his intense glare.
"Yeah.", he nodded before coming in. Peter sat down in one of the armchairs in Wade's guest room while Wade sat down on the bed.
Peter didn't remember how he got to the side of the road, he couldn't remember the nature around him, he couldn't remember what time of day it was or how the weather was. All he registered was the sound of his steps, how he dragged his feet along the concrete. And the
"Are you surprised?", he smirked. "Then again, I'm just realistic. I'm clearly at a disadvantage here and fighting doesn't work."
Peter blinked a few times, like he needed a while to arrive in the present, but when he did his eyes shot from Wade to Tony and he cringed. "Get- away from me-", he spoke through gritted teeth and even though they tried to hide it, Bucky could see how much his words hurt Tony and Wade.
"You weren't. You were distrusting, which you have every right to be.", Tony sighed, sounding so fucking understanding. Peter hated it.
Wade cursed quietly, trying to ignore the boxes, chanting in his head as he got out the car. Once he walked around it he just saw Peter on the ground, curled up, his long boney arms shielding his head, but he didn't try to run, he just trembled horribly while little whines escaped him.
"I'm just goofin' ya.", Wade laughed softly. He had a pleasant laugh, deep, warm. It felt like a soft blanket for Peter's nerves. If that was how it felt to be calm he could get used to it.
The only other option he has… but no, he can’t ask his friends to live with his blood on their hands.
It’s like a code word, giving Steve access to a memory he’s locked away and never looked at for a very long time, because even just remembering was too much after he’d lost it all.
“Oh, I… I don’t know. I run. I read. Sometimes I watch a movie. Hang out with Bucky and Sam on Thursday night. Play tennis with Sharon every other Sunday.”
I know when it’s going to be. As soon as I’m healed enough to walk out of here and to the public square.
“Thank you,” he says in the end. He gets up, puts the plates in the sink. He drinks a glass of water, then another.
“Okay,” Steve says softly, with a resigned sigh. “I always ask too much of you. And I have no right. I have no right. I just wanted to say. Thank you.”
Tony has no idea what he wants to say. Steve keeps looking at him. Then, he squints, and tilts his head to the side, as though some weird thought has occurred to him, and he’s trying to reason his way out of it.
He closes his eyes and lets himself lose this battle against his own mind. The images come back to him in a smooth flow, it’s almost scary how precisely he can recall them, like dreaming them all over again. Like living them.
The sound Steve makes, like someone pinched his heart with a knife through his ribs—strangled, wheezing, an endless agony crammed into a second—goes right through Tony like a bullet.
Tony makes his way down Steve’s body, shifts between his legs and takes off his pants. His white Calvin Klein boxers don’t leave anything to the imagination: Steve is hard and huge, heavy and red in his underwear. Tony touches it through the cotton after getting silent permission from Steve, and it’s hot and wonderful just like he remembered.
He quickens the rhythm of his thrusts, hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and breathing in his perfect scent. It’s impossible to describe. It’s exactly like Tony’s slick, but as a scent.
It’s that last detail that really sends Steve into overdrive now. He was just talking the other day (yesterday? The day before? He has no idea) but now the idea of Tony being pregnant again, of having another kid makes his head spin with how much he wants it.
It keeps happening. Not often, just once or twice a month, but it keeps happening. Always in the same way: it’s unplanned, sudden, unexpected, Steve is surprised and eager, his dick goes from zero to one hundred in two seconds, Tony’s touch is electric, everything he does drives Steve crazy, but he never lets Steve kiss him, he very rarely looks Steve in the eye, he never talks, never makes a sound when he comes, never mentions it later.
“I already asked Pepper. I’ll tell her exactly what it is when I’m back home, and I’ll tell you, too. It’s something about my mother. In case I die, I need you to help her do it.”
To reach the house they make their way through a beautiful front yard where Steve spots various fruit trees, a vegetable garden, dozens of different kinds of flowers, lemon trees in big terracotta pots. It looks messy, but in a rational way. It’s the irregularity of nature, of leaving things to their growth with only minimal influence. They grow with no plan, no foresight, maybe, but not without logic.
Tony instructs Steve on what to do every time Steve looks unsure. He rinses the cloth multiple times, then gets it soapy again, scrubs it over Tony’s skin, across his back, under his armpits, over his chest (attentive and slow, searching Tony’s face for any sign of discomfort), on his thighs and legs, takes particular care of each foot.
Steve touches Tony’s arm with his fingers, beckons him to twist on the bed so they can be face to face. He stares into Tony’s eyes for a long time, and he tries to pour into it all his love, all his acceptance, but can’t quite get rid of the regret and nostalgia he feels creeping at the edge of his gaze.
Tony walks a few feet away, and presses a button on his sunglasses to summon the little energy shield that muffles his voice. It comes in handy when you’re the kind of person who really needs to keep his calls private, and not only because you hang around people with enhanced senses.
Steve takes his cock out of Tony’s mouth. He does it gently, with attention, but there’s also an urgency to it—it needs to be done as quickly as possible but without causing more damage.
He swallows, because he can still feel Steve’s presence behind him, the even rhythm of his breathing, his searching gaze. Curious, but not invasive.
Steve hates himself so much that he wishes someone would come and take him away for more torture, so he doesn’t have to force Tony to be in a room with him.
“I don’t wanna be like that,” Steve says, quietly, and his worry is palpable through the bond. Tony can even smell it on him—the fear, the misery, the hopelessness.
Steve sniffs, nods, and lowers his head to Tony’s chest. Tony slides his arm across Steve’s shoulders.
about stuff, and not assume what the other is thinking and run with it. So they talk about it. They fight about it. They talk some more.
It’s fun, doing this together, and it’s fascinating to watch Tony exist in this environment. His legs wrapped around the branch of a tree, his teeth sinking into the juicy pulp of a peach, his lips shining with it while he chews, unashamed, without any need to perform for anyone.
It was there, that light, right there in Tony’s eyes, while he was in Steve’s lap, while he moaned his orgasm into Steve’s mouth, while Steve pressed his love into Tony’s skin.
I've always been unhappy. And I don't want him to be. I want him to be loved in all the ways Howard never loved me. In all the ways you always did.
“Didn’t mean it like that.” Steve pauses, “Give it a minute. We can do other stuff in the meantime.”
Under the shower, Tony can’t smell Steve anymore, and it’s good and bad at the same time. It’s as though he’s been held prisoner in a tiny box for a long while, and now he’s being released in a desert, big, yes, but too big. Too much.
, Tony wants to say, but doesn’t. Instead, he says,   “I’m gonna make the Iron Man helmet in the shape of a chef hat,” and waits for understanding to blossom on Steve’s face.
It feels so good. Steve’s mind is flooded with Tony’s admiration for him, by the sense of security Tony feels thanks to Steve, a sensation that Tony passes back to him in a loop. There’s love, there’s respect. There’s pleasure.
This part of his mind is rational and cold, precise like a bullet, and so far away from the bond that links him to Steve.
“And then we decided that there was a safer way to try, that with the Pym Particles we could go in undetected and—”
He feels his heart thump in his chest, and as it’s often the case, a sound becomes a word and a word becomes a color. And the color is a scent, and the scent, a taste.
He knows, and he’s going to tell Steve. He’s going to make his confession and hope he, too, will be forgiven for what he’s done. He’ll do it tomorrow, though, because he needs to stay alone with the thought for a while. Because it’s a beautiful thought, it’s what Tony wanted to be able to feel again all along, but couldn’t. Wouldn’t.
Suddenly he regrets letting Steve wash up first. His skin feels clammy and sticky with sweat, his t-shirt clings to his undershirt, and he can feel the sweat under it, too uncomfortable to be bearable anymore.
He wishes he could quantify it, this power Steve has over him. A word, a brush of fingers, a chaste kiss—and Tony breathes again, feels again, thinks again.
“Fuck,” Steve says, and it’s all regret and remorse. “I’m sorry, Tony. Nothing’s wrong with you, I’m sorry. I’m frustrated, and… It’s no excuse, I’m sorry.”
He uses the bathroom quickly, then ventures in the living room, where he finds Tony sitting on the couch, still in his underwear, ice pack covering his shoulder, hooded eyes absently watching a cooking show on the TV.
Steve would give anything to know what Tony wants. What he wants Steve to do. How to end this, one way or the other.
Nat’s eyes are so bright while she looks into Bucky’s, and Steve captures the moment with his memory, promising himself he’ll try to commit it to paper soon.
“Maria said he avoided spending time with you. That he criticized you all the time, that you antagonized him when you were older, which made him mad.”
“Hey, little one,” Steve says to it while he twists to press his hand against the trunk, waiting for the ladybug to crawl past his fingers and on the tree.
. You can’t give up after the first obstacle. Where’s the guy who lied on his enlistment form five times so he could go punch Nazis? I want that guy.”
He should leave Tony alone, but he just can’t. He’s completely incapable of it, and it makes him so mad. At himself.
Steve’s heart hammers in his chest, fear taking him over. He swallows, a hot flush creeping up along his neck.
Tony takes the glass of water with trembling fingers, drinks it slowly. Steve passes him a damp towel, and he wipes at his face, the cold clearly soothing on his heated skin.
“I brought him back to you,” T'Challa says, with a calm voice that Tony would probably never get tired of listening to. It exudes nobility, as cliché as that sounds.
It was amazing, though. Tony’s unconscious body completely entrusted to him. It made Steve feel— powerful, in a good way. He felt like Tony was
That life refuses to stay hidden, is called out of its drawer by tender touches and careful understanding. It claims its own existence, demands to be acknowledged, crashes into Steve’s room and makes the biggest mess possible, so it won’t go unnoticed again, so no one can pretend anymore. It wants to be real, so it makes itself real, despite all the precautions Steve had taken to ensure it would stay just a fantasy.
Tony stomach flips at the suggestion. Well, he supposes they could. Steve sent him away, so he clearly doesn’t want Tony’s help. Which is fine. Obviously. Totally fine. Understandable, even. Who would want Tony? Who could desire a fifty-six-year-old Omega, bond or not? The mere idea is just laughable, honestly.
Steve looks down at him curiously when he feels him moving, and Tony closes his eyes and shakes his head as minutely as possible, then sends something serene across the bond.
“You got the shape of my lips just right,” Tony says, almost inaudible, and hopes Steve understands what he’s talking about.
They reach the oak tree, and Steve gathers the things they left there, shakes out the blanket and folds it. They head inside the guest house, and Tony sits at the kitchen table while he stares at his aspirin as it dissolves into a half empty glass of water.
When Tony breaks the kiss, Steve twists around on the bed to retrieve the bottle of lube they keep in the bedside table. “Hurry up,” Tony says, “I wanna come on your fingers,” and Steve pauses, shocked, pleased, happy. They have done this many times, but tonight feels different.
“I thought I’d never get anything more. Not from Iron Man. And it was confusing as hell, because meanwhile I was developing a pretty embarrassing crush on Tony Stark.” Steve forces a smile and then swallows back something that can only be nostalgia. “Anyway. I was in love with Iron Man. And I thought that piece of mesh would be all I’d ever have of him. So I kept it.”
Steve has no right to be jealous. And yet, he keeps seeing it in his mind, playing in a cruel loop: Tony and the man hugging, Tony closing his eyes, the way they smiled and—
Steve will be angry about this. Eventually, he knows he will. He’ll look back on all the pain and loss he had to endure for the resistance and for Tony and the betrayal and the lying will wrap around his soul and make him blindingly angry.
Steve must black out just for a handful of seconds, because he’s at Tony’s side a moment later, tearing the man away from him.
Moving as fast as he can, Tony twists on the bed, tears the blanket away from Steve, and straddles his lap.
He exhales, frustrated. Damn, he’s out of practice, and Steve is right. He hasn’t boxed in a long while, preferring weight lifting, which is undeniably more useful for handling the suit. His reflexes are still sharp, his movements still quick and strong, thank you very much, but he knows he’s lost a great deal of elegance in his form over the years, and of course Captain America has to bitch about it. Tony doesn’t even like hitting the bag that much (he’d much rather have a real opponent); it was just the farthest spot from Steve in the gym.
It’s only then that Tony understands what he’s been dreaming about. What makes him happy when he wakes up. He nods against Steve’s skin.
Steve keeps hoping to remember, eventually, the first time he got to make love to Tony after ten years, but he never does. When Tony tells him that he should stop thinking about it, Steve replies, “It doesn’t matter if it never happens. I just need to keep believing it’s possible,” and Tony smiles and takes Steve’s hand in his.
“Okay,” Tony says stroking the nape of his neck, “we’re gonna figure something out. You sure I wasn’t hurting you?”
Steve lets his hand slide over Tony’s hip, and he presses his middle finger down the cleft of his ass. Tony feels Steve rubbing against his hole, which has leaked some of Steve’s come while Tony was asleep. Steve’s first knuckle slips in almost on his own.
“Right after Siberia, I didn’t go home. I went to a hospital—the same one where I got the shrapnel taken out. Spent ten days there. The shield, it… the chestplate... That’s why I have this scar. But the edge of the shield actually dug into me. Right over my heart.”
Tony expects to have to convince him; he even has a little speech prepared. But he must look ready, or sound sure, or something else he can’t quite understand himself, because Steve nods and says, “Yeah,” and he’s never sounded so thrilled and he’s never looked so rapt about anything else in all the years Tony has known him.
“You know,” Tony says, “you’ve said I admit to my mistakes. Sam... when I went to the Raft, I told him I’d been wrong about this whole thing, and he said, ‘That’s a first’. But you don’t think that.”
Songs are proof that someone else has lived what you lived, and they know what that’s like. It made me feel less alone.”
Steve remembers when he was tiny and sickly, and shaving left his skin red and angry if he didn’t soothe it with Vaseline. Sometimes, Ma would do it for him. She’d remove the excess with a towel, pat his cheek and kiss his forehead, and tell him he looked like a proper gentleman. She had the ability to not make it sound like a lie.
He feels like he isn’t real for a few minutes, like he’s disappearing into nothing, but it’s not scary. It feels great. Everything unnecessary about him is being peeled away, and only his essence remains, ready to blend with Steve’s through this thing they’re doing—this act of love-making that suddenly seems like the most important brick in what they’re rebuilding.
“Not with me, anyway,” Steve says, and Tony is thankful that Steve sounds more sad than bitter, because he can’t have another fight about this. But the guilt still hits him, because he’s more than willing to let Steve touch him when he’s the one who needs to be held. It’s the other way around that’s harder on Tony.
“No, listen to me. I need sleep. I can’t sleep. You fucking me makes me less worried about work shit. You clearly want to keep going. This is a win-win situation. I trust you, Steve.”
It happens like most things happen in Tony’s mind: all at once, abruptly, but not exactly unexpectedly. There’s an anticipation to it, a vibration inside him, something that tells him,
Tony looks into his eyes, and he understands what he means without him having to spell it out. Of course he does.
But she deserved better than this. She deserved to be free of Howard, she deserved to let go of the weight of protecting Tony from the truth. She deserved a son who could handle her pain, who didn’t get scared by her tears, who didn’t force her to hide them.
“Yeah, that’s. That’s normal. Just give me a minute, ‘kay?” Steve nods, wonders if he can touch Tony or it would be too much. “Can I touch you?” he asks, because there’s no point in not doing it. Tony makes a gesture with his hand.
“You can take the first shower, if you want,” Tony says, abruptly, quickly, before his brain can pull some stupid shit on him and give him ideas he definitely cannot entertain.
Steve lets the man go so he can be close to Tony, and that’s not a smart move, but they don’t see it yet—too much is going on.
The pictures have been taken pretty much everywhere around the world. There’s them doing silly touristy things, taking selfies before the word existed in front of this or that monument, wearing NASA t-shirts outside the Kennedy Space Center. There are pictures of them at home; sometimes just one of them, but most of the times they’re together or with someone else, relatives or friends.
Steve shakes his head to say that no, of course he won’t take advantage of this in the future, he’d never do that, but Steve only feels his heart hammering in his chest, blood pounding in his ears. Everything seems so far away for a moment. Only Tony is there, close, in front of him, short and beautiful and so happy, and Steve wants to… he wants, he
Tony opens his eyes—he closed them at some point, squeezed them shut to better focus on every sensation, because Tony never avoids feeling it all to the end, whatever it is.
A couple of months later Maria never shuts up. Every time it’s a language lottery. Who knows what the fuck she’s speaking? Not Tony. But they’ll figure it out. She’ll figure it out.
They torture him, but they don’t even ask him anything. They don’t want to know anything he can tell them. He figures that all they want to know is already written in his blood.
Steve just wants to touch him. Words? Nah, fuck words. He just wants to touch, to lick between Tony’s legs until the pounding in his head stops. He tries to grab him, but Tony’s stronger than Steve right now.
He looks more tired than Steve has ever seen him, even after his long stretches in the workshop, pushing his body and mind to the limits of sleep deprivation.
Tony thinks about the armor crawling away from him, and the armor crawls away from him. He sits down on the edge of Steve’s bed. He breathes.
“So I guess the, um, cure, is you eating me out as much as possible. And then please fuck me too because I kind of still need that,” Tony tells him.
There he is, the golden avenger to the rescue, always ready to catch Steve when he falls, whether it is from a high building or in a dark pool of self-doubt and fear. Steve strokes Tony’s hair, kisses him again, a way to say
Like most things that pass through Tony’s sensitive nose, Steve’s scent becomes a color, and the color becomes a taste. Sweet, like cherries.
The King has never seen me fight. Some of the inmates say I should be glad for this ignorance. They say it won’t last. They say I’m his type.
Scrambling, desperately, for a way to quiet Tony’s mind, Steve hugs him. Tony remains still in his arms at first, but then he tries to struggle out of Steve’s grip. Steve resists, wanting to keep him from getting away, but the effect is, predictably, the worst imaginable: Tony’s punch lands on Steve’s ribs, cutting his air off for a moment. It surprises him more than doing any real damage, and it hurts, yes, but only Steve’s soul, not his body.
His body, too muscly and full for an Omega. He’s never been petite or thin. Sure, he’s short enough, there’s that at least, but the rest of his body could never match up, especially not after he became Iron Man and needed strength to pilot the armor. Still, his belly isn’t exactly toned, and he has stretch marks around his navel and scars over his heart, and his skin isn’t soft and unblemished—it’s rough and coarse, with burns and scrapes and bruises and scratches.
It’s careful at first, unsure, Steve’s movements are heavy and calm, predictable, precise. He pulls almost all the way out, then goes back in slowly, allowing Tony to get used to the sensation, lets his inner walls stretch around Steve’s tentative intrusion. Then Steve pulls out completely, only to immediately push back in, but only up to the tip. He picks up the pace and starts fucking Tony like this, with quick, short, shallow thrusts that make the crown of his dick catch at Tony’s hole, hit his prostate, over and over and over again, and it’s driving Steve absolutely crazy, and Tony is sobbing under him, wailing; all of it is just
A sob makes its way up Steve’s throat, and tears slip down his face and onto Tony’s fingers, hot and bitter and poisoned with Steve’s shame. He squeezes his eyes shut and grits his teeth to bear the sting of guilt spreading through him from his chest.
“Yeah. I have a responsibility towards the people who work for me. I know that. I still wish I could just give away most stuff for free.”
Steve rolls him to the side, pressing himself against Tony’s back, caressing his hip and making him shiver. He nibbles at his neck, then, and Tony turns his head to kiss him—just a brush of lips, chaste and heartbreaking. Steve tastes like tears, and Tony knows not all of them were shed out of relief.
“Do you think— I mean, I know it isn’t possible—I think it isn’t, at least, but—what if I could see how full you were right now. Full of me. Like. If your belly swelled up with it. It would be— I’d like that, I think. I’d like that. It’s a weird thing to say, isn’t it? It’s weird, I’m sorry.” Steve says this whole thing very fast, but also in a shy way, awkwardly.
Steve grabs the bottle of lube on the bed, squirts a good amount on his fingers again. He pushes into Tony, opening him up with more decision. Tony keeps shuddering, but now there’s a goofy smile on his face. He has gone soft, and Steve lowers his head to suck a drop of come away from the tip of his dick.
Tony—this imaginary Tony that Steve must be hallucinating—touches him. He brushes a hand through Steve’s hair and Steve leans into it. It feels so real.
Tony closes his eyes, and everything inside him is illuminated by a white-blue light that explodes into hundreds of brilliant sparks. He feels them like feathers on his skin.
“It’s just this thing with the bond, I think,” he says, but Tony’s face is still full of concern. For the rest, though, Tony seems perfectly fine, even better than usual.
There’s a grandfather clock in Steve’s room. Tony has no idea where he got it, but it appeared sometime after Sarah’s first birthday. It works; the hands and the pendulum move and all, but it doesn’t tell the right time.
“She’d tell me about you before Project Rebirth. How clever you were, how much you read. What you did with that dummy grenade, how ready you were to sacrifice yourself. You were... you were brave long before you were Captain America, Steve. She made me admire that in you.”
So he does what Tony said, and he thinks about Bucky, about all the stupid shit they did together when they were kids, and all the pain and the loss too, and he hopes more than anything that this is the last time Bucky will be hurt like this, that after this last effort things will look up for him, that after this last wound he will have peace and a chance to heal, and Natasha’s arms to welcome him and keep him safe every night.
Tony gasps and wakes up. The day is incredibly bright, and he doesn’t know if his eyes sting because he was sleeping, or because the cave was so dark.
—it was... Tony, it was important for me too, I... it meant, to me, it was...” Steve stammers, happiness makes him trip on his words.
He throws the covers away from the bed and pulls me forward, lining me up with the edge. His hands are cold. He enters me dry.
“Don’t... don’t be sorry.” Steve voice has become very sweet, and he starts brushing Tony’s hair away from his forehead, but the repetition of the gesture doesn’t seem to have any real purpose except showing some degree of affection. “Of all the things I regret, especially where you’re concerned, that... I’d never regret that. Even if you don’t...” Steve trails off, unable to continue.
They killed Steve’s husband, mercilessly, cruelly. They left him to die slowly and painfully on the steps of a building, blood oozing out of him and staining the hard gray stone beneath him.
I wanted to go back to Peggy. But I wasn't thinking of Peggy, and the stone knew, and it led me here.
Steve falls heavily on the blanket, ungraceful; he looks tense and sad, and Tony wishes he could… that he could just…
Sure, he could get help. A nanny, or something. But he doesn’t want help. He wants to spend every waking minute with his baby because he has a baby now. He’s a father, and that’s his baby.
and Tony thinks that he hasn’t lived for much time after it happened to him, but he’s sure it must be true. At first, the idea feels defeatist—it doesn’t matter what you do, how much you work to leave it in the past, the memory will hunt you down and find you and make itself manifest once a day every day, for the rest of your stupid life. But then, inexplicably and quite unexpectedly, the thought becomes warmly comforting. Now he has something he simply
Tony looks down at his feet and nods. No more secrets. No more fumbling in some dark room in the dead of night. No more pretending, no more telling everyone they’re just friends. Tony has always been worse than Steve at hiding it, anyway.
Tony bends down to brush his lips against Steve’s, and in a moment of clarity Steve thinks that even if this doesn’t work, even if the rut ends up killing him anyway, it doesn’t matter. If Tony is with him until the end, then Steve is gonna be okay. He just wants Tony close.
Tony picks up the picture of Stella and Maria on the beach that’s been resting on the coffee table the whole time.
Tony kisses him. It’s just a peck on Steve’s lips, barely there at all, gone as soon as it started. But a shiver goes through Steve, head to toe, and an ache settles into his muscles, across his back.
He offered to tidy up the gym. Steve, that is. When the knot went down, he got up and cleaned between Tony’s legs with a wet washcloth from the bathroom, put the robe on him and said, “Go on upstairs. I’ll take care of this. Good night. Sleep well.” Yeah. You too.
Tony’s mouth twists into something that isn’t quite a smile, that possibly doesn’t look as friendly as he’d like it to be, or as reassuring as he’d want. But still, Steve smiles back, tentative, while he looks at Tony with his big, sad eyes, full to the brim of all their kindest memories. The ones where they laughed, and spent time together willingly, and fought side by side instead of each other.
After, when the Avengers had secured whatever victory was possible, they went back to being strangers.
It’s like a punch to the gut, if a punch to the gut was the best thing that could possibly happen to anyone and you spent the last two years dreaming of taking one from a very specific person.
“I love you. Steve. You did great. This is amazing. Hey. Look at me. This is incredible, you’re incredible. You’ve been perfect.”
Joking feels good. Tony’s ability to shift Steve’s attention, to ground him, to smooth his edges is always incredible, always there despite it all. Steve is still angry—he can still feel tons of Alpha hormones rushing through him and making his skin crawl—but Tony’s presence, his voice, his scent, they’re cardinal points for Steve’s soul, even with their quiet, untouched bond.
“No, but maybe in a couple of hours I can take a nap. I just wanted to check... well, whatever, I’ll tell you another time. You gonna be alright?”
In the late afternoon, they arrive at a place called Relais Carbonelli, which, if Steve’s sense of direction is correct—and it is—is between Florence and Siena.
He cleans himself up, then the mirror, the sink. Washes it all carefully, sprays detergent and disinfectant all over, rinses the lather off. He tries to delay the moment he goes back to bed as much as possible, hopes Steve will fall asleep again in the meantime.
Tony snorts. “Well, not having to breathe is a big help, I imagine. You don’t… choke on it... Can we talk about something else?”
“It’s the serum. I think. I haven’t asked anyone because it’s not exactly… something I like to discuss.”
He wanted to wait after Maria was born to look for a therapist, and Steve agreed not to put too much pressure on Tony all at once. But now he knows it’s time to give Tony that little push he sometimes needs when something he must do for himself terrifies him.
Tony jerks back, but Steve doesn’t let him go, so he grabs Steve’s t-shirt in his fists. Steve clutches his hip in response, hard, to keep him from running away, to keep him from falling over; but he’s squeezing too hard, so hard it’s gonna bruise—and maybe if there’s a sign that any of this happened, if it’s written on Tony’s body in dark spots of displaced blood, if Tony can look at himself later and have proof, then perhaps…
Cuddling Sarah does miracles for Tony’s mind—having her curled up between his arms transforms his anxiety into determination to keep her safe.
“So wet for me,” Steve says, and it drives Tony crazy. It wrecks him. “My Omega. My perfect Omega. The other half of myself.”
driving himself completely crazy wondering if Tony actually hated him now, if this whole thing between them had ended that night, with that mistake), and they make it to Tony’s bed by some miracle. It’s just after lunch when Steve goes up to the penthouse to tell Tony that Kamala texted saying she’s coming for dinner with her physics homework (“Urgh, her teacher is an incompetent and questions my methods.” “Most people are incompetent compared to you when it’s about physics, Mr. Big Brain.”) but at some point the conversation turns into Tony shoving his hand down Steve’s pants, which, okay, okay.
He stifles it down, someway, somehow. There are tears in his eyes for the effort and Steve’s gaze now is panicked and worried.
The thick fog of images clears out from Steve’s mind, and he gasps, too loud, and he hopes he doesn’t wake Tony up again.
“I’m sorry, I know it’s... I was just thinking about you and all the things you do for everyone, and... now that I know what you did for Bucky, it’s even more... I just—”
I don’t know how much time I have left before my execution. The others say it could be months or even years. Until there are new slaves, captured during the wars. Until then, probably.
Steve follows Tony’s finger with his eyes, and Tony can pinpoint the moment wonder blossoms on Steve’s face, the moment surprise pins his breath to the back of his mouth.
“What?” That’s not exactly rare, but it only ever happens in one case: when the Omega is dead. “I’m not dead.”
Steve’s pace grows erratic and frantic before Tony feels him suddenly go still and then pulse deep inside him. Steve is gasping, he’s trembling, he’s squeezing Tony’s wrists, hard, crushing Tony into the bed with his weight, but it doesn’t matter. A couple of minutes pass like this, with Steve kissing his shoulders, the nape of his neck, behind his ears.
But he doesn’t sleep. Tony hears him let out a pained whine and reaches for Steve’s hand beneath the covers.
And he can feel it. Somewhere deep in his bones, there are aches that didn’t use to be there. His muscles have lost some of their definition, his belly is definitely softer, his ass not as firm. The hair, the goatee. His chest and pubic hair. The mere fact that he stopped giving a shit about shaving them. His skin is drier, coarser, he has wrinkles. He needs an anti-aging cream. He needs reading glasses. Thank fuck his teeth are still perfect. And that he isn’t balding. Oh god, he could cry with joy because at least he isn’t balding.
Tony falls asleep quickly. His body is fully relaxed beneath Steve, warm and compact and under Steve’s total control. Under his care. Tony’s breathing is regular and slow, he really is sleeping. And he let Steve do this. He gave himself up to Steve, completely. He said,
“St– Steve,” Tony grunts, and just like before Steve feels like Tony’s making a huge effort to drive those words out, but he’s still hell-bent on doing it. His Iron Man, through and through.
They all move to the living room, and Tony sits at the piano, Stella standing close to him while Steve stays back.
No bite. Tony has been in this exact situation many times before today. Every time he’s had sex since his first time ever, way too many years ago. He’s one of those shameful Omegas, always used and thrown away, never claimed by anyone. It always sucked, but this one takes the fucking cake, he’s gotta say. But let’s be real, they went out on one date. One. Steve is fucking him after they went out on one—
He’s rough, exhausted, barely keeping it together from pain, out of his own mind with need and arousal because fucking Tony right now is a matter of survival, and yet if Tony said
“I can’t sleep. I don’t know why,” Tony looks at him, eyes bloodshot and shining with tears, dark circles around them. There’s a desperation in them that Steve doesn’t know how to cure. They plead to him, beg him, but he’s powerless. Tony’s voice shakes. “Why, Steve?”
He thinks about the move to the compound, imminent at this point. He’s still convinced it’s the best decision, more practical for the Avengers and safer for the people, but he’s gonna miss the city. He’s gonna miss the penthouse.
Tony’s anger is met with a tense silence. Steve turns his head away, and Tony is almost grateful to be spared the sight of Steve’s face.
The blocks of Steve’s personality shift into his head. He squeezes his eyes shut, and then opens them again, trying to clear his thoughts to make room for the one thing he needs to focus on right now.
“Fine!” Steve clamps his mouth shut an instant after the word comes out, filling the room with how loud it is. Steve is always so careful about the way he speaks. He rarely needs to raise his voice to be listened to, and he never does it with Tony or Sarah or any of his friends.
Tony’s mouth is distressingly empty, but he can’t close it immediately. His muscles are stuck, his jaw locked in position.
“Tony. You’re an idiot. I love you, you’re my friend, but you’re an idiot. Of course Steve wants you. Why do you think—”
“I’ll warn you next time,” he says, and Tony doesn’t really need him to, but he doesn’t know how to tell him and it can’t hurt anyway, can it?
Steve’s legs are going to give up on him any second now. With shaky movements, he pulls up a chair and sits down on it. He feels like he weighs a ton.
Tony pushes him to lie on his side, almost on his stomach, a bent knee to prop him up from the bed. Steve follows Tony’s instructions to the letter, limbs pliant, trust in his eyes, and Tony wonders if this is just a taste of what would happen in the field if they led the team together. If Steve would entrust himself and the Avengers and the protection of the entire planet to Tony, if circumstances made it clear Tony really was the best man for the task.
Tony stares at the drawing in his hand, while his throat constricts, while his chest burns with all his worst memories, with all the things he wishes he had done differently.
“It must be amazing, to connect with someone like that,” Steve says, and it leaves Tony in a strange sort of bafflement. Steve
With his nose so close to Steve’s cock he can smell him so clearly that his eyes well up with it. These are pure, unadulterated Alpha pheromones, straight from the source. But it’s not just that. They’re rut pheromones. And again, it’s not just that.
They slump on the bed, pressed against each other, and Steve isn’t entirely sure, but he thinks that when he falls asleep he’s still inside Tony.
Tony stares, his stillness betraying hesitancy and stupor. He mouths a barely-there “Oh,” more the sound of his tongue separating from his palate than a real word, and discards the shirt to the side. In the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony’s chest rise and fall with words that are left unspoken.
Steve kisses back, still a bit unsure of himself, still careful, maybe fearing that Tony is going to shatter into a billion pieces between his arms if he presses too hard against his lips or licks too deep inside his mouth.
“Steve,” Tony says, firm, to bring him back from that place in his mind where there’s no hope and no escape. He cradles Steve’s head in his hands, lifts it up. “Look at me for a moment. Please,” he says, voice calm and warm, like a blanket on Steve’s unquiet thoughts. Steve opens his eyes and holds Tony’s gaze, and it’s hard to look at him, the tears blurring his vision and his guilt blurring his heart.
He looks around his bedroom, the corner with all of Maria’s things, and he feels like he’s failing at this. Spectacularly so.
Tony doesn’t reply, but Steve feels him in his head just a moment later, reaching out, still cautious but sweet, affectionate.
“Nothing made you suspicious enough all this time, but my dick is what gives me away. Unbelievable.”
He empties his drawers, and when he reaches the last one – the one that used to contain all his socks but now only has the old ones he always avoids wearing because the elastic band is loose after washing them too many times but he can’t decide to throw them away – he realizes that something is missing.
He finds Tony on the couch, sleeping. He’s lying on his side, knees drawn to his belly, arms crossed over his chest, hands resting on his biceps. There’s a scowl on his face. The television is on; he must have fallen asleep while watching it. Maybe it’s the jet lag, maybe it’s the fact that Steve woke him up last night.
Tony wants to scream. He’s a terrible Omega, he’s always been, and he rebels against Steve holding him down, not because he doesn’t want to be but because he likes to be a challenge, he likes to push at Steve’s buttons and play with fire. But he’s also oversensitive and overstimulated in a deeply unsettling way, and his consent doesn’t change the fact that everything is too much, too much,
Tony walks away from the staircase, deep inside the mountain, across different caves connected by tunnels. The ground is dry now.
“He told me,” Stella says, even though Steve will be back in a minute, even though Steve can hear everything not matter how quietly she speaks. “He didn’t go into detail, but I asked, and he said.”
, the light in his eyes would dim, something in his smile would falter and fall—as though each time he was piercing himself with the needle of the harshest self-judgement.
Tony squeezes her shoulder, pushes a stray lock of hair away from her face. He rests the back of his fingers against Stella’s cheek, brushes away a tear or two. His hand looks big next to her frail frame, his skin tan and rough when confronted with Stella’s, fair and wrinkled and soft.
“Alright,” Steve says, and kisses him. He tastes like Tony and like all the best things in the world—like being safe, loved.
He helps Tony up, then into the tub. He settles behind Tony, welcomes him between his legs. Tony’s resistance is minimal, and when Tony’s back is against his chest, for a moment Steve thinks that everything is right in the world. Everything has slotted back into its proper place.
“Riri, what are you—” The loud ringing is still in Steve’s ears, and now it suffocates his words, smothers them into hesitation.
He ends up in a patch of trees. They press around the road as if they’re trying to swallow it, and Steve can’t see the hills anymore. He can hear animals running around the woods, squirrels, birds, wild boars. He sees a fox crossing the road, its red fur harsh against the gray asphalt. It looks at him, uncharacteristically bold. Maybe the curiosity of studying this strange new creature beats any survival instinct. A super soldier seen through the eyes of a fox.
“It’s warm,” Steve says, like he really needs Tony to listen, to understand this. “It’s warm. It’s fine. It’s warm.”
He focuses his hearing on Tony’s breathing coming from the living room, the conscious effort not to cry taking away all the energy he has left. Even in circumstances as awful as these, the knowledge that Tony is close and unharmed (even though hurt in different ways) lulls him to sleep. Or maybe he’s so utterly exhausted that not even anger or heartbreak or the serum pumping in his veins can keep him awake.
, and it was. It made me so happy—seeing you, having you there, and we could... I thought we could talk. That we’d solve... but then…”
As Tony promised, the drive isn’t long. Stella’s villa is outside Siena, at the top of a hill which has only one access from the main road, a long white trail with cypresses on both sides. It ends in an open space covered in gravel, where they leave the car, next to Stella’s.
Steve reaches for his own neck. If his friends hadn’t bandaged his severed head to his body, maybe his healing factor couldn’t have brought Steve back.
“Sometimes things don’t play out the way we want them to. But I’ve never seen you give up. Point is, the world may not be perfect, but you use the power you have to try and make it better. That matters.”
Steve kneels down in front of him, takes his face in his hands, licks at his own come on Tony’s skin, his tongue swiping across Tony’s graying goatee and it makes Steve go hard again.
Thor clasps his shoulder with his flesh hand and opens his mouth to say something, so Tony asks him about Jane Foster before he can talk. She’s responding well to treatment and Tony’s heart fills with joy at the news. Thor looks at him, then, and nods almost imperceptibly, and Tony thinks that he’s known Thor for longer than he’s known Steve, and isn’t that weird. He feels like there was never a time in his life when he didn’t know Steve.
Tony’s walls clench around nothing and his mind does the same. He whines, pitifully, bereaved of something that was never his. He swallows down his misery and accepts the shame that claws through him. He whimpers to keep something else at bay, a distilled pain, so pure he might get drunk on it, wish for more.
He fumbles with his hands between his legs. It’s slippery and too warm and his fingers, again, are not enough. He pushes them inside himself but relief, just like the afterglow of his orgasm, only lasts a minute.
Tony has never felt safer than when his back is pressed to Steve’s chest. He falls asleep so quickly that he doesn’t even realize it.
It’s meant to be a joke, and that’s the worst part. Steve lets his arms fall to his sides, and doesn’t reply. He blinks back tears.
“I don’t want to be just a stain on your life,” he says, leaning back, holding Tony’s face between his gigantic hands. Tony looks at him, because this is the most important thing Steve has ever told him. “I don’t want to be only a bad memory, I want to be real, don’t... Please. Don’t let me just fade away.”
By the time Steve is done staring at everything with his mouth hanging open, Tony looks like he’s about to bang his head on the first available wall that won’t get him in trouble with UNESCO. And Steve’s stomach grumbles.
“Shit, Steve,” Tony says, and he sits on the bed, his thigh touching Steve’s. When he speaks next, his voice is low, crestfallen. “I’m sorry. I don’t even know why I’m mad, really. That they made us so easily, maybe. That I let them hurt you like this.”
“We’ve talked about this already, but I think what Stella said made me really figure it out. What she said about her relationship with Laura, remember? They worked hard not to let their differences become incompatibilities. She said she liked having her vision challenged. I think I like it too.”
Tony smiles at him, and Steve can’t do anything but smile back, glad that he seems to have slipped back into a good mood. Maybe it’s Stella’s company that makes him feel better now, or maybe it was Steve’s presence that brought him down so much earlier.
He just stands there, wearing only his pajamas—arms crossed, feet bare, eyes lost in thought, mouth slightly open. He keeps very still, except for his breathing, soft but irregular.
About a week in, Tony hasn’t showered in six days, he’s covered in more baby vomit that he wants to think about, and there’s something dark under one of his nails. He doesn’t want to know what it is because it’s not motor oil and if it’s not motor oil then the options here are all things that make Tony’s skin crawl.
He tries to imagine a friendship, based on trust and mutual respect. Despite their history, that’s easier to do. But his chest constricts when he tries to remember the few times Steve has looked at him with the same kindness, with the same intimacy and tenderness he has for Sam, for Natasha. The looks he sends Tony here, they may not be hostile, but they’re tinged with a sadness, a melancholy, a grief that’s hard to miss. Too much regret between them, too many missed opportunities. Too many
Tony opens the faucet to drink some water, then spits in his hand—his saliva is streaked with red—and starts stroking himself.
God, wherever he is in his omnipotent silence, must be looking down on him and laughing his ass off.
She sounds apologetic and heartbroken. But her words are logical, and they feel like a caress, smoothing over Tony’s rage. She didn’t lie.
Slowly, Steve releases Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t say anything. He breathes out, once, steadying himself for god knows what. Maybe he’s changed his mind. Maybe he’ll drag Tony to a doctor tomorrow morning to undo all this. A mistake. Poor judgment. Got carried away, you know how it is. Sure, I get it, just the heat of the moment.
“I took off my glove and touched it and I thought… It’s stupid, I know, but I thought that thing had been against your skin, and touching it with my fingers felt like… like…”
“It had to look real, Steve,” Tony answers, and Steve knows it’s the truth but it hurts like a blade through his chest. Tony lied to him. About this. About being
The man was a thorn in the side of pretty much anyone who was supposed to deal with him. The Shadow Pillar is a black site prison, miles and miles off any American soil. It’s not the first time that one of its inmates—international terrorists, dictators, people accused of genocide and crimes against humanity—gets killed in a dubious way, and it’s not the first time that such an event is swept under the rug without much thought.
“I didn’t know. But it’s okay, I know now,” Tony says, circling Steve’s shoulders with his arms. “Please don’t hurt yourself. Please,” Tony whispers, and strokes Steve’s back.
God, he wishes he could go to him and touch him, use his hands to make sure that Tony is fine—a little worse for wear, yeah, but nothing that can’t be solved with a couple of days of rest. With a couple of days of Steve curling up against him in bed, their perfect daughter sleeping softly close by, the bond shining again in their minds—
He drags the box of Alpha toys closer. He doesn’t have many, just a few basic things. He doesn’t use them all that often, what with the fact that he doesn’t have ruts anymore. But once in a while, the mood strikes. Or after some bad mission, when he needs to unwind and stop thinking for a while. Or when by some fortunate chance he happens to stand too close to Tony and catch a whiff of his sweat.
. Everything in Steve’s world is wet and warm, his dick slides easily in and out of Tony’s lips, saliva gathering there and making it all slick and hot, and
“Mmh—” Tony groans. He feels his heart speed up in his chest, and he’s suddenly drenched in a cold sweat that wasn’t there a minute ago.
He gets back to his feet slowly, sits on the bed silently. He frowns, touches his own lips with the pads of his fingers, and he looks as though he’s trying to understand something very, very difficult.
He’s just... he’s just perfect, isn’t he. There’s no other word. Nothing else can describe Steve’s body. He’s perfect.
God, those were some pretty awful thirty seconds right there. He doesn’t need something else to feel guilty about.
Steve feels it creep up on him from behind, starting from a point just below the nape of his neck. It spreads to his shoulders in hot waves, down his spine, takes over his chest and throat as quick as a fire. It rises to his cheeks, to his eyes, blazes through him in an instant, leaving only shame and self-loathing in its wake.
They wait for it to cool, and then cut a tiny slice into little pieces. Maria brings them to her mouth all by herself.
Tony’s mind splits into a million pieces, something deep inside him rips forever, an assortment of all the emotions he’s ever felt and all that he could possibly feel floods him completely. He’s drowning in them, in every emotion, in none of them. They nullify each other.
I often think about the past, Stella, and I see roads I didn't travel, occasions I didn't seize, things I didn't do. How would Tony be today if his mother hadn't been a coward? If we had come to the airport with you, that day of so many years ago?
“Tony said something like that. And look, under any other circumstance, I’d probably agree. We make mistakes, and our mistakes are big and public and hurt people. And people shouldn’t pay for them.”
When Tony is about to stand, Steve says, “I really am sorry. I don’t know how… I’ll keep saying it until you believe me.” He stares at the crumbs on his plate.
But still, Steve kinda feels like shit afterwards, every time, and yet he doesn’t have it in him to put a stop to it, he wants Tony. If this is the only way he can get him then he’s gonna be a big boy and suck it up and be grateful that life has at least conceded him this.
, his body was working, Peter felt like it shouldn't. He walked towards Wade, every inch closer made Peter's mind ache but it had to be, he had to be
"Oh God, oh God, I'm losing my mind...", Peter whispered, his breathing picked up. Great, he was having a panic attack. "You are dead, you have a bullet in your head, you-", he stilled, his bottom lip trembled slightly. "Am I dead?"
"Are you ready?", Bucky asked. They had all gathered outside Tony's house. Tony had provided one of his cars, a truck, and Bucky had already packed all their stuff in. He spend the last day gathering all the stuff he might need for an incognito road trip with Peter including fake ID's for both of them. They hadn't left Peter without supervision the entire last day. Even at night Steve had stayed in his room, making sure that Peter didn't try anything. Apparently he had refused to talk to anyone but Wade. Now it was time for a goodbye.
"Nah, we're taking the HYDRA mobile.", Wade said after he pulled his bag out of the wreckage. "It's our best bet and even if it's tracked, so are you, so it doesn't really make a difference. They will find us anyways.", he explained before opening the door to one of the jeeps.
"Haven't bit the dust in a while, D.", Wade smirked before looking around a bit. "I like what you've done with the place. You gonna let me ride that rollercoaster or am I not tall enough?", he asked pointing towards the themepark.
Not long after that, Bucky came out again, carrying all their stuff, Karen trailing behind him. "Are you ready?", he called out.
MJ seemed to have a pretty guarded demeanor, but once she opened up a bit she was very sardonic, sarcastic and pretty fucking morbid. She said exactly what she thought, not mincing matters and Peter seemed to love it. Bucky thought that it might've had something to do with Peter's annoyance at everyone treating him like he was made of glass.
"Yeah...He definitely is. Same goes for MJ. Peter doesn't take to a lot of people.", Bucky nodded and he could see Peter roll his eyes. He was definitely listening.
Days passed, weeks, months, years. Suddenly a decade. It didn't feel like it. Tony could still see the blood like it had been yesterday. Peter would've been 19 years old. Except he never got to go that far. Never even turned ten, never went to high school or graduated, never fell in love, never kissed a girl, never went to prom or got his drivers license.
His heart was racing in his chest, like a bird flapping in his cage uncontrollably. He couldn't see the agents anymore, or Wade, but he could still hear them, the gunshots, screams.
"Are you weirded out by that?", Wade then asked, aching for a reaction. He looked over at Peter and Peter stared right back before shrugging.
Steve didn't consider for a second that this boy could really be Peter Stark. That's why, when Bruce announced that the results came back positive, Steve didn't register the words for a long time. It just didn't make sense, none of it.
Their drive was silent, only Matt Maeson's music filling all that quiet. It was one of Peter's non verbal days and Bucky respected that.
Obviously he knew what a date was, Wade had made him watch a bunch of rom-coms after all. But he just... didn't make the connection? Because he didn't even consider that he could ever have something like that with anyone, or that someone could want him in such a way.
"Oh it wasn't?",Peter asked and he didn't mean to sound so bitter. Until now he hadn't even noticed that he was bitter at all. But apparently he was. Bitter and a little pissed off.
"And that I needed to tell you something. ", Peter completed his sentence before glancing up at Wade, looking so fucking vulnerable without seeming weak at all and it was killing Wade. "Did I tell you?", Peter asked carefully.
Bucky hadn't taken care of anything for decades, except maybe his houseplants and those were pretty fucking dead. But maybe taking care of a little punk was like riding the bike. After awhile he got right back into it.
Peter let out another huff and looked over at Bucky. "I'm not stupid, I know that. I'm asking you to take me."
"No you're not, he just cancelled, now move your ass.", She then said, holding Wade's phone in front of his face. Wade quickly checked if that was true. Peter had texted him that something came up and that he'd call Wade in the evening.
"Trust me, baby boy. I'm doing you a favor. Nobody wanna see what's under the mask.", Wade shrugged and Peter only frowned before getting into the car again.
"You gotta sing me one of these songs, baby boy.", Wade smirked but it wasn't quite as sharp as usually. Peter wished that he could see his face, get a better idea of what Wade was thinking.
"Sure, let me help you inside.", Wade nodded before approaching him but Peter flinched back, almost fell into the bath.
"I can't be what you want. You might not see that right now because you think that having me back is some kind of miracle. Soon you'll realize that I'm- I'm a burden at best and a catastrophe at worst. Nothing good can come out of this and I can't let you make me believe that I can be anything more than this. The inevitable disappointment would destroy me. "
"No. Let him finish. You've got something to say? You want to play the hero?", the man asked with a nasty laugh that sent shivers down Peter's spine. As much as he wanted, he couldn't back down now, he just couldn't let this guy get away with this.
Steve had mentioned that Peter was in possession of his file and since he was down at the beach, now would be the only time she had to sneak into his room and search for it.
"Asleep-me is a mood, I guess.", he shrugged with a smirk, trying to play it off. MJ didn't play along, though. She just watched him with her usual stony expression that Peter couldn't read.
"It's my tragedy, I get to decide when it's alright to joke about. ", he shrugged before suddenly stopping, the smile dropping off his lips. Wade followed his line of sight. They had arrived. "Gwen...", Peter whispered, his eyes wide and already filling with tears.
"He fought so hard! Like he dragged himself out of this wreck, how he clung to life, all very admirable. It didn't save him in the end." Her voice was gentle but it was like venom for Wade's soul. It tore through him viciously as his mind tried to make sense of this.
"Crazy. ", Gwen said, looking around. She seemed less tense now that they were by themselves, which was a relief to Peter. At least she could still find comfort in him.
But expecting and wanting something weren't the same. Peter wanted things, more than he would ever admit. It was a hungry desperate feeling that he shoved away into the darkest corners of his mind. Because wanting something was dangerous, it was lethal. If you wanted something enough you might get hopeful and Peter couldn't do that to himself.
A part of Peter thought, that Tony wouldn't be too mad at his request. That Tony wanted what was best for him, that he wanted to make Peter happy, that he would let him go if that would help Peter in the long run. That part of Peter, that voice, sounded a lot like Wade. It was a product of his time here. A tiny bit of hope that Peter developed lately. It was nothing compared to the years of painful experience. Peter was still largely convinced that Tony would be furious.
Whenever his real person came through, whoever he was, it wasn't a relief, not really. It didn't leave you feeling lighter because it only ever made things harder. It was waking up to Kid screaming in his sleep. It was coming into the room and seeing Kid stare out the window, tears streaming down his face. It was seeing Kid twitch when ever Bucky got to close, even if only for a second in passing by.
"Now that was a bit dramatic, wasn't it?", Wade chuckled nervously but Steve and Tony just both stared at the closed door like Peter would return any second.
The hands on his body hurt, the leather on his wrists, the collar around his throat. Their voice, talking about his condition, their cold stares. Lorenz smiled and it felt like a curse. She pressed the cold plates of the halo to his face and it felt like damnation.
"How can you be sure of that?", Wade asked, glancing over at Bucky. Bucky gave him a look and shrugged before taking another drag of his cigarette.
His heart didn't care for his resolutions. So in the time he sat at Bucky's apartment a tiny, seemingly insignificant thing came alive inside of him. A thought, a prayer, something he wanted. All he asked for was a little less pain. It couldn't be too much to ask for, right?
He didn't notice that the door to the roof opened, and he didn't notice that someone walked up behind him. Only once he sat down beside him did Wade realize that Bucky had joined him.
I know I said this already but we are pretty much through the worst of it for now, things go uphill from here. Welcome to the Bucky/Peter road trip part of the story with a few adventures and a bunch of angst and fluff and HEALING.
"What... What happened to you, if you don't mind me asking. Why did you have to leave, why do you not have being-alone-privaleges?", she asked carefully.
"I... there was other things I ment to say... I don't know if I got the chance to say them. ", Peter slowly said, not meeting Tony's eyes.
Anyways, a few words to finish this off. First of all, I know I sort of spoiled that before in the comments but I always write happy ending. By that I don't mean that by the end everything is perfect and well. There are still problems, unresolved issues, unanswered questions. Typical happy endings are boring to me, they are not real, but hopeful ending... I love those. It's sort of my philosophy in writing. That you can put a character through whatever hardships you want as long as they get to make it out. As long as they get to have hope. We could all use a little more hope from time to time, I think, especially now.
"SHUT UP!", he screamed before smashing his fist against the glass so hard that Wade was pretty sure that he heard something crack. His knuckles split open, staining the glass red but he didn't care. This time even Natasha had to take a step back, her mask was slipping away more and more, revealing her own realization. But when the guard reached for his gun she gave him a sign to stand down.
A strange silence followed, like an intermission between two acts. The only sound was the music and the squeaky wheels of their shopping cart as Wade pushed it through the store.
Peter took that as his go-ahead and pulled out his pack and lit himself one, filling his lungs with the familiar burning smoke.
But I'm also really excited for the next one. I miss my boy Wade and there will probably be an appearance of his special skeleton lady-friend soon because I have some bad things planned.
"Yeah. But Peter can. What if they register him as a threat? What if he gets caught in the crossfire? What then?" That seemed to shut Wade up but Bucky wasn't done yet. "And even if you get him out, what then? You're making Peter a fugitive. You'd be on the run. Maybe you can live like this, I don't know you well enough to be the judge of that, but do you think Peter could? Do you think he could bear being on the run? Always having to look over his shoulder? I've been there! It fucking sucks! Especially when you can't trust yourself! Do you really want that for him?"
Peter couldn't read the expression on Wade's face. All he could think about was how they were too close but how it had to be this way. He had to convince Wade that he could be good if he was numb.
"And instead you ran into me, sorry kid. Just the consolation prize.", Steve smirked and Peter pulled a face.
It was a bloodbath. At some point Wade completely lost sigh of the others, all he saw was black and red, all he could hear were screams and the rush of his own blood in his ears.
When he came home Obadiah was unconscious, the security system was turned off and Peter? Peter was gone. Except that he wasn't.
A deep breath, an even deeper sigh and Peter closed his eyes. "Nevermind.", he shrugged but it sounded so fucking pained that it crushed Bucky's heart.
So he kneeled on the floor and didn't get closer, made himself as nonthreatening as possible. "I'm not hurting you. Not touching you.", he announced and scared eyes watched him.
Wade didn't try to start a conversation, he didn't move from his seat in the armchair that Peter didn't break during his withdrawal. He tried to be as distant and non-threatening as possible. But he watched every move Peter made, too terrified of what he had witnessed only hours prior.
A single one escaped and trailed down his cheek and it's like that triggered some alarm in the kid's head. Suddenly he jumped out of the bed and for a second Bucky thought that he was attacking him. But instead the kid headed for the corner.
and plopped down on the ground and Peter only now noticed the big bundle his father was carrying. A blanket, by the looks of it. "Are you cold? It's getting fresh out here.", Tony offered him the blanket. Peter glanced down at his arms and noticed that they were covered in goosebumps, so he agreed. Once Peter had wrapped himself in the blanket, Tony was the first one to speak. He started with a heavy sigh, his head lowered, then:"I'm sorry, Peter. She shouldn't have been there."
"It's almost like he's clinging to them.", Lorenz once said offhandadly. Wade once again wondered if the words had specific meanings. He told himself he'd ask Peter once he was back...if Peter was still willing to speak to him.
Keep Peter a secret. Another deadly secret. "Yes." She had done it before. "I hope you don't get yourself killed." With that she left.
For a second Tony thought he couldn't speak, his throat closed up and that was it. He pushed through it though. "Yes, this is real. You're home."
"What did you do to him, you psycho?!", another voice asked, clearly Wade, clearly furious as hell. He had been right, about everything. Peter tried to ignore that fact for now. He had been an asshole, a blind asshole and he knew that but right now he really had no time for that.
"Never.", Bucky replied before pulling out a chair and sitting down near Peter's bed. "How are you feeling.", he then asked.
This memory was different for some reason. It wasn't as sharp as his other ones, but it wasn't as chaotic either. It was calm. Peter needed a second to realize why that was.  That this was a memory from before. That the man in it wasn't a HYDRA agent, but Tony.
Wade knew that he was being an ass. He wasn't allowed to be jealous of the girl that was tortured by crazy Nazis her whole life. But if this was any other situation, if all three of them weren't who they really were, that's what things would look like: Gwen was Peter's person, the way that Vanessa had been Wade's. They knew each other better than anyone else, had seen each other at their best and at their worst. She was the person that Peter trusted most in this world, the person he loved most and she was beautiful. Sure, she was broken but she was broken in the same way that Peter was. The kind that didn't diminish her beauty. In Peter's eyes she was perfect.
He could still feel the warmth of the sun on his skin. He was still cold, Peter hadn't felt warm in... maybe ever. But to feel the sun, to see the sky, the world, other people, to eat food and hear some song he doesn't know play on the radio, it was more than Peter ever hoped for.
"Wait, you mean we're almost there?!", he asked and he could feel his heart start to race in his chest. The bird in the cage, flapping uncontrollably. "I- I can't- I-", he stuttered as his throat closed up. He wasn't sure where this sea of panic came from but he was drowning, it was going to swallow him whole.
"Yeah, we can go to SHIELD if that's what you need.", Tony agreed. So that's how they ended up in the lobby of the NY facility two days later, with Peter counting the seconds.
Peter did the same because distance usually made him feel better when he was upset. MJ still seemed frustrated, staring at her hands in her lap now, her eyebrows tightly pulled together.
His chest ached with a bitter sweet pain when he thought of it and Peter knew exactly what it was. It was Wade. Peter was missing him. It was awful and yet relieving at the same time. The distance hurt but it also brought Peter certainty. Certainty that once he was ready he'd still want Wade in his life.
Peter looked down at the book in his hands again. His eyes didn't meet Bucky's when he asked:"Do you want me to leave?"
"Why do people look at old pictures of themselves?", he asked in turn and Bucky raised his eyebrows.
"My abdomen, went through- ", Peter replied, the pain of it finally hitting fully. He lifted his shirt, revealing the blood gushing wound on his stomach.
He had stopped pretend-reading and pushed away the tablet, narrowing his eyes at Wade now. "That's not what I ment.", he stated and Wade raised an eyebrow.
"Anyways, I see that you enjoyed your little vacation a lot but it's time to come home now. ", Keipon went on before turning away from Peter and starting to circle Gwen instead. "Gwenny missed you a lot.", he added with a grin before stepping behind her, glancing at Peter over her shoulder. Gwen didn't move, didn't even pull a face, his presence didn't seem to faze her at all.
"11 years ago your mom suddenly died...and you went out to find your father. You found us, a family of three, we weren't well off or anything and our dad had not changed much. He was a deadbeat. Mom worked all the time, he wasn't around much. You came around every once in a while, on holidays and stuff. Then our dad pissed off again. Mom was pretty heartbroken and depressed, she became pretty useless. I was sort of helpless, you came in and took care of me and since then we've been brothers." Peter spun this tale of their fake lives, his voice detached, like he was reading from a history book. He didn't seem bothered by the depressing image he was painting but Bucky couldn't get past it, couldn't help but to stare. "What?", Peter asked after a moment of silence, looking over at Bucky.
I also changed the chapter number, it won't be more than 56 total. But I also started outlining the first chapters for the sequel, plus, I'm considering doing little one shots and if you want you can request scenarios, fluff, angst, whatever you want to read, just text me either on my instagram which is @dead_cherry_bitch or my Tumblr dead-cherry-bitch.
"Natasha... isn't that the Black Widow?", he asked and to Tony's surprise he didn't seem all that bothered by the appearance of a stranger in his safe house. That didn't mean that Tony was okay with her just showing up here.
He reaches up to rip the velcro keeping the wrap around one of Tony’s hand in place, and begins unwrapping it, the narrow strip of beige fabric unraveling while Steve pulls it in the opposite direction, over and over, as fast as the length of his arm will let him. When he has half of it undone, he wraps his own hand with it in a certain way, does the same for Tony’s, then links their hands together and—
And then there’s his prostate, which is. He doesn’t even know. It’s very sensitive, way more than a few years ago. Steve rubs at it every night, with his fingers, with his dick, and it’s. It’s fucking
It’s just the way it is. It’s a probability thing, proportional to high quantity. If you have that many ideas, some of them are bound to be pretty fucking stupid.
He didn’t think he was this angry. But Steve is here now, and everything is coming back in waves—terrible waves of hate that feel like they almost don’t belong to him because Tony isn’t like this, Tony doesn’t hate, and sure as hell he doesn’t hate Steve, but—
as a person, sometimes even as a hero. And you don’t get to take that away from me. You don’t get to do that, Cap.”
He presses Tony’s back up the trunk of the cherry tree, braces himself against it with his hand, brushes his nose with Tony’s for a moment.
If he had been allowed anywhere near Tony, now he might even have a gravestone to talk to. Something of his, maybe. The ring Steve gave him, perhaps, with
Tony’s thrusts grow hard and fast, like his hand has always been, and the rhythm is driving Steve out of his own mind, the pleasure building up and solidifying inside of him into something that makes his skin burn, his vision blur, his breathing ragged.
Because he can still feel this way, because he can still find himself in Steve, because he can still find Steve in himself, because not all their promises were wasted, because this thing between them was broken, yes, but Tony is a mechanic, and Tony fixed it.
“God, Tony… The way you taste, it’s… I want to… I don’t know, bathe in it, it’s… It’s amazing, you’re amazing, I—”
Steve releases Tony’s wrists, props himself up with one hand splayed between Tony’s shoulder blades. It doesn’t hurt, but Tony can’t move more than what’s strictly necessary to breathe.
It makes him feel almost bad, now, all of a sudden. That he didn’t try everything in his power and beyond to bring Tony back to him, to bring Tony back at all. But Steve has thought about it; that’s why he was so quick to suggest it to Spider-Man.
She just watched him for a moment like she sometimes did, expression unreadable. Then her expression turned sharp, not in a negative way, she looked fierce, determined, and she sounded like it too when she replied:"If he's really as great as you say he'll know how special you are and he'll wait for you to be ready. And if he doesn't... he's just not fucking worth it."
"Deal. Whatever you say, just bring him back. ", he agreed and a smile split on Death's lips. She pressed her forehead against his and Wade stopped himself from flinching back.
Anyways,  this chapter is pretty dark so watch out for that, I also updated the tags so check that out.
Still, Wade knew that Peter wouldn't like this and just like he predicted the boy gave him a sharp look in response before saying:"I thought I made myself clear. I'm not talking about this. Though I am curious what you mean by 'as well'?"
So Tony drank. He hoped that it would relief some of the pain, numb him to the bottomless tear that had opened up in his chest. Blur some of the agony.
"Yeah, why shouldn't I be?", He asked, making an effort to sound nonchalant. He got up and started to change out of his pyjamas but he could still feel MJ's eyes on him.
And the promise, the implication, that somewhere, wherever in the world he was right now, Peter was thinking about Wade just like Wade was thinking about Peter.
Tony still couldn't truly believe it, even as he sat in the car with Steve and Wade. It was a strange feeling, like awful deja vu. He felt like he was on a cruel twisted carousel, forced to repeat the same horrible loop. Lose Peter, think he's dead, find out he's alive, reunite, lose Peter again. Over and over, round and round. The ride to Brooklyn felt like leaving his workshop to see Peter for the first time in a decade, hopeful and terrifying. Tony wasn't sure how often he could go through that before it tore him apart. "He's gonna be okay. Bucky took care of him.", Steve said beside him, his hand holding Tony's.
"How reassuring.", Peter remarked sarcastically but he also walked over to the door of the passenger seat.
Peter wondered, not for the first time, if he was like this too when he was activated. He couldn't imagine it. Peter had been mindless, he had barely spoken, hadn't had thoughts of his own. Gwen seemed differnt, she still seemed like somewhat of a person, just a person that didn't give a fuck. Somehow that was worse. You can't blame an animal for not being moral or human, Gwen wasn't an animal, though.
The first time he saw Wade's skin Peter understood why he wore a mask. Not because Peter was disgusted, it really wasn't all that bad, but because he understood that A) Not everyone was as unbothered as him, and B)he knew how it felt to be repulsed by your own appearance.
His words were so gentle, so soothing that for a second Peter forgot the raging storm inside his mind but only for a second. "I'm really fucking scared of hurting you, though. Not just like last time. That was nothing. You read the file by now, you know what I can do... what I did."
He had been a fool for thinking that he could be more than this. He had told Tony and Steve, had told Wade, had even told himself to not get his hopes up.
They followed the same procedure they always did when they were looking for a place to sleep. They looked up the worst rated motel near their destination and picked that one.  It was most likely cheap and not so busy that it made Peter anxious. So far it had worked fine and this time it seemed to be the same. The place they picked was called Watson's motel and it was just at the side of a highway a few miles away from McWay Falls. Bucky called ahead and asked, if they had any free rooms, which they did, so they decided to stay there.
That's what Wade thought at first, too. Well, not the fucking bit, but Wade had tried to convince himself that he was just being jealous but the longer he thought about it the less sense Gwen's story made. Plus, her behaviour today was concerning. She didn't seem like someone who was in pain. She did yesterday but today? She just seemed detached, cold. Wade didn't like it. But it's not like he could tell Peter about his worries.
"Peter, you aren't with HYDRA anymore, remember. I saved you, I brought you to your dad's, you moved to Malibu, remember?" It didn't seem to work and Peter was spiraling more and more out of control.
"Peter?", the younger man asked, his voice cracking. He turned his attention back to the boy in the bed. Peter had opened his eyes but made no other indication that he was conscious. He just stared straight ahead. "Peter, can you hear us?", Tony asked and Bucky could see how much he longed to reach out and touch his son. But he didn't, he kept his distance.
MJ glanced over at him and grinned. It wasn't necessarily a happy grin, but it wasn't unpleasant either. "So you don't know either.", she stated and Peter returned her grin, it felt foreign but not entirely wrong.
The boy repeated this over and over in his mind and didn't even notice how his own fingers ran over his arm, nervously clawing at his skin.
"Are you mad? That I read it?", Peter then asked and his calm demeanor wavered ever so slightly. It wasn't completely gone but you could see it in his eyes. That he was still afraid.
Maybe they were injured and needed help, maybe someone dumped a body. When he first saw the man, he assumed that it was the latter. Bucky was certain that he was staring at a corpse, just judging by all the blood that came from countless wounds all over the body. One of his legs was twisted in an unnatural angle and one of his arm seemed to be broken, too.
"I- I didn't know- but I had a hunch. Her story seemed too convenient and she was behaving weirdly all day and I tried to tell Peter but he wouldn't listen, and-",Wade tried to explain before his voice broke off.
Peter was so sick of that phrase. What if he didn't have time? What if HYDRA came for him? What if he lost it again? "It's frustrating. I don't really see an end...to any of this.", Peter sighed, dropping his head. "Sometimes I think I should try the alternative."
"I don't think you should be alone right now.", Wade admitted, not backing away. Peter could scream and attack him if that's what he felt like doing right now. Wade could handle it as long as Peter didn't turn all his violent potential against himself. He didn't scream. He laughed and Wade wished he'd punch him instead. It was icy and cruel. Peter cackled and turned away from him, making his way back to the window where he came to a halt. It was getting dark by now, the sun disappearing in the ocean, painting the sky red. It looked like blood to Wade. "Of course you think that. I forgot, I can't be trusted. I ruin everything.", Peter said once he finally stopped laughing and this time he sounded bitter.
"Does this hurt?", Keipon asked curiously, snapping Peter out of his thoughts by pressing his finger into the bullethole in Peter's shoulder. White hot searing pain shot through him and Peter couldn't keep in the scream. It was agonizing.  "I will set you free.", Keipon said with a grin, stepping away from Peter.
Wade couldn't help it, the things that Peter was saying only worsened Wade's worries. If even Peter, the person that knew Gwen best, thought that something was up, then maybe Wade wasn't just being a jealous asshole.
This night she wore Peter's face. Wade didn't know which one he hated more, sleeping with his dead ex that he would never see again or cheating on his boyfriend with a copy of him while the real Peter couldn't bare to be touched in the ways that Death had Wade touch her.
"It's in his possession but we didn't read it to respect his privacy.", Steve replied. There it was. Natasha assumed that they would say this.
then he let his eyes wander through the room until they landed on Steve. "I don't know. I'm okay, I think. Just, things usually don't stay okay for long. I wish I could just relax and enjoy it but- I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. For you all to change your mind on me, to see me as I see myself."
"Yeah. I'll let you know what they are once I figure them out myself.", he said sarcastically, his eye focused on his drink again.
Wade sat up straight at that. The idea that Peter didn't deserve Wade was outrageous to him. Wade still couldn't comprehend why Peter would choose him so the idea of not being with Peter was laughable.
"You're not as cheater. You're a good person stuck in a shit situation.", Domino said and Wade almost laughed at the idea of him being a good person.
Peter chewed on his lip before looking up at Wade. "The whole eggshell thing. You know?", He asked sheepishly and it slowly started to dawn on Wade what he ment. "I mean Tony and Steve always kinda did it but... not you. Not all the time, not like now." He didn't look at him any longer as he admitted to that, his eyes downcast, almost looking embarrassed.
At least he hoped that it would go that way. There was no way to tell how Peter would react. The boy was knocked out cold for hours now, outside the rising sun started to paint the sky in shades of rose and orange.
Peter's shoulders sagged with relief. As much as he didn't want anyone around him, he also feared being alone. Another one of those things that were just fucked when it came to him. His hands were still shaking a little when he opened the door of the car and stepped out. Then...he froze. For a moment Peter wasn't sure what he was looking at. He was surrounded by a huge space made of stone that ended in boulders that were thousands of feet high. Like a gigantic gash in the earth's crust and when he looked up...there was the sky, rich dark blue but sprinkled with more stars than he'd ever seen before. Thousands, forming the milky way, illuminating the imposing landscape around them.
He was a lot steadier on his feet by now which was good. Still looked like a corpse, though. He also looked tired, maybe he just wasn't used to this much activity but once they got back into the car Peter leaned his head against the window, his eyes half closed, his breathing slowing down. "Okay, let's get a motel room then.", Wade suggested, as he drove.
"And Peter?", Tony asked, getting his attention back. "I know you don't like me saying it, but I love you. You're not a catastrophe or a burden, and you are my son and you're definitely a person."
Wade needed a second to catch himself but he wouldn't let Peter throw him off his rhythm just because he felt like imploding right now. "Okay, you wanna talk about this? Let's talk about it. Why are you sabotaging yourself?", he asked, his tone sharper than intended.
"Well...", Tony sighed before lifting up his shirt, revealing that the right side of his ribcage was just one large bruise, purple and agonizing. It was a wonder that the guy was even standing.
"Peter where are we? What is this?", Gwen asked once the two of them had calmed down enough to lead a conversation again. They still didn't seperate, though.
From what he heard Peter had one friend in his life and she died. That's not a great track record. And it would definitely stunt someone when it comes to forming new relationships.
"The Sokovia Accords. ", Bucky realized and Tony nodded miserably. The Accords were the only thing besides Bucky that Tony and Steve ever disagreed on. In the end Steve gave in and agreed to them while Tony gave in and agreed to not shoot Bucky on sight. A compromise. One that came back to bite them in the ass now.
"And you must be MJ. The girl that kissed my man. Did you like it?", Wade asked with a grin and MJ smirked at that.
"Says who?', Wade asked, challenging her. Eventually she seemed to decide that this conversation wasn't leading anywhere, because it wasn't, and threw her hands in the air in defeat.
Except that he wasn't, not quite. After Wade left, things moved quick. Too quick for Peter. Their conversation left him emotionally drained so he checked out. For once he didn't mind losing time. He embraced it and just let himself float through the day.
"He's coming, okay, Tony's on his way, you just gotta hold out for him, okay?", Wade nodded, he reached for Peter's face, cradled it in his hands.
After that there were only flashes. He was in a jet, flying, and then he wasn't, he was falling. He was on the ground, he didn't land, he crashed.
Peter eyed over to the mercenary. He completely stopped wearing his mask when they were alone in the car, only putting it on when other people might see.
Tony was nervous, desperate to do the right thing, Steve knew that but Tony tried to not let it show.
"He asked for you.", Steve replied with a shrug and Wade tried to ignore the little jump his heart made. No, he wasn't supposed to feel happy about this. Peter had to be real fucked up, if he asked for him and that was not something to be happy about.
"Yeah, I think we worked that one out for now. I called him dad. ", Peter admitted, a satisfied little smile on his face and goddamn, he was adorable.
"He's managing us.", he blurted out without any context. Steve looked up from his laptop with his eyebrows drawn together.
"I'd never dream of it Peter!", Tony exclaimed, feigning shock before flashing a grin as well. "But is it working?"
"A locked door usually means that the person who locked it doesn't want to be disturbed." They found him crouching against the wall above the door, staring down at them.
Peter wasn't dying, or he was but not that easily. It was a curse that he knew of but got surprised by over and over again anyways.
Peter still had his back turned towards him but he raised his head a little. "Because I'm leaving.", he replied. Wade couldn't read Peter's tone, it was rattling, void of any emotion.
"No, I told you, I'm bringing you to your daddy.", Deadpool shrugged and Peter pulled a face before leaning his head back until he could see the night sky again.
The boy was curled up on the couch, his legs pulled to his chest and his head resting on his knees. By now he changed into sweatpants and a loose shirt. He looked so incredibly small, his too large eyes observing the other men in the room intently as they explained the plan.
"Bucky?" Relief washed over the man's face and he immediately let go of Peter, sitting back to give him some space. Peter sat up and avoided looking at his arm, taking in his surroundings instead. Tony and Wade were crouched down a few feet away from him, their expressions worried. Still they didn't get closer, waiting for Peter to indicate that it was okay. Natasha was there, too. But she was still on her feet, leaning against the door, her expression unreadable, at least to Peter. "I'm sorry...", Peter stated. His voice suddenly sounded wrong. It was sort of distant and empty. His eyes darted around the room as he tried to figure out what he was supposed to do. He didn't notice that he was reaching for his arm until he saw the alarmed look in Bucky's eyes. Instead of digging his nails into his skin he just brushed over it and when he raised his hand to his face he saw that it came away with blood.
He needed a plan. Peter wasn't good at plans, or at agency, or at not doing what he was told, but he had to do something.
"Yeah that one. He went missing and I'm worried.", Wade stated, no humor in his voice. Death's hand curled in his hair as she looked up at him, smiling like this wasn't about life or death.
. He was in the gym, sprawled out on a yoga mat, staring at the ceiling. He wasn't sure how long he had been laying here.
"Peter... You don't have to manage my feelings. I'm here to take care of you. Not the other way around. If something bad happens you can tell me. I won't be disappointed. Besides, the bad things don't cancel out the good.", Bucky said in his typical gentle and understanding way. Peter felt undeserving of all of this.
They were right. Wade knew that this would happen. It always happened, he should really know better by now. Wade had served his purpose, fulfilled his promise and now he had to watch Peter awkwardly stumble his way through a rejection.
A short one but I hope that you like it anyways, the next one will probably be a larger one so it might take longer.
"Thanks, Gwen.", with that everything faded to black and Peter fell into a soothing dreamless slumber.
"Can we make it quick?", he asked, his tone so exhausted and resigned that Steve felt like he was doing something horrible to him, even though he didn't know why.
"No, it's okay. I mean, it's not, but you don't need to apologize.", MJ shook her head, her eyes were focused on Peter's. She wasn't fleeing, wasn't backing down. "You're pretty messed up.", she then stated but without any trace of pity or disgust or fear. Completely neutral, as if she just pointed out Peter's eyecolor.
"FRIDAY, where are the wonder twins?", Wade asked, laying in his bed. They had all separated an hour ago, all going to their respective bedrooms. But Wade couldn't sleep and he hoped that Peter was the same.
MJ sighed again and dropped her hands before looking up at Peter again. "I think I might be gay.", she said, almost sounding apologetic.
Wade let out a heavy groan before slowly turning onto his back until he came face to face with the woman. "Am I a cheater, Dom?", He asked sounding just as miserable as he felt.
"Seems like our little powow is coming to a close, Peter. I would've loved to take you back home, but as you are right now, you're useless to us. ", Keipon explained, sounding apologetic. He looked to Gwen and to the gun in her hand and Peter followed his line of sight. So that's how things would end.
For a second he was alarmed because he wasn't alone in his bed, but then he recognized Gwen's shape, sitting beside him. She was already awake and watching him with a blank expression.
Peter probably still felt like he owed him, that's the only reason he could guess for why the boy felt so uncomfortable doing this.
When he glanced up, two wide eyes were staring at him. They weren't like the other times, glazed over and distant. They were clear, sharp and terrified.
A little later Wade put on some music and went to the kitchen to get them some chimichangas. He returned with two regular plates and one giant portion. That one was for Peter.
The eyes really struck him. In the dark room they were like two black holes, huge, threatening, sucking in all of the light. He had a glare like a wolf, like something feral but it also seemed haunted, wounded, hurt but trying to conceal it.
Natasha started to pace in the foyer, taking in more and more space with her presence. "You skipped our last mission.", she shrugged like this was enough of a justification.
Wade half expected him to flinch when he grabbed a hold of his hand but instead Peter just squeezed it and pulled Wade along. And that's how they left the SHIELD facility. Tony, Steve and Bucky walking ahead, Peter behind them, one arm laid around Gwen on one side and holding hands with Wade on the other.
Wade could see it. Drugged up Peter still spoke, he moved around normally, he didn't avoid eye contact. Right now his movements were slow, lethargic. He still shifted around, he was packing clothes into a large suitcase Tony had brought over. But sometimes he'd just sit on his bed, clutching a random shirt in his hands, staring at nothing like he wasn't even there. It was painful to watch but Wade couldn't look away.
"Peter, I want you to be happy, if you can't do that here then you need to leave.", Wade replied, the words easily spilled from his lips, they were the truth. It hurt to know that Peter didn't want him around him any longer but Wade would never put Peter's well being over his own feelings.
Surely enough Bucky stumbled out of the motel towards the pool, looking like he just rolled out of his bed, which he probably did. Luckily he had thought of his arm and pulled on his hoodie and gloves.
Peter flinched ever so slightly and Tony didn't even know why, before faintly mumbling:"Yeah, sorry, I won't mention it again. " Steve gave Tony a helpless look when Peter proceeded to poke at his food, barely eating any of it. Tony could only return a shrug.
"I don't know. Maybe I trust you, maybe you're just here, maybe because you're one of the only people that ever treated me like a person.", he lifted his head, locking eyes with Wade and Wade couldn't quite remember the last time someone stared at him this intensely. Must've been Vanessa. Everyone else always quickly looked away.
"No, I want to be alone-", he gasped out. He had looked so relaxed a few minutes ago, now every muscle in his body was tense, his shoulders were drawn up to his ears, his hands were clenched into trembling fists.
It was sort of amazing to see, how his anger seemed to cancel out any fear or timidness he might've usually felt.
Peter must've been aware of Bucky's starting all along. He didn't meet his eyes once but after a while a made his annoyance known.
Peter didn't stop her, he didn't flinch back because he didn't feel threatened. He just let it happen. Their lips collided.
"Thank you. I made it.", the girl nodded, burying her hands in the pockets of her large red hoodie. When she did it, it looked relaxed, when Peter did the same he looked anxious.
"Would you believe me, if I told you that you're a good person?", Tony asked and he knew that he had cornered Peter with that.
"We're on the run and you're bored?", Wade chuckled. They stopped next to the cereal isle, Wade picked out a box of Lucky charms.
"But what? But it had to be done? But you had good intentions?", Peter snapped before he could stop himself. They both knew that they weren't talking about Gwen right now.
"Peter you don't have to do this-", he started to argue but Peter's eyes shot back to him and silenced Wade.
Bucky told the others, because Peter was a coward. He didn't want to see their faces. He stayed in his room, his back turned to the door. That's where they had gathered, in the hallway, where they could still keep an eye on Peter because he couldn't be trusted by himself. Peter could still hear them though, even as Bucky attempted to be quiet.
Peter wanted to scrape the memory out of his brain. He couldn't. It never went away. So much else did but not him. Not Keipon. Peter could never banish the man that broke him out of his mind.
They called him back to get out the tracker in his mouth. They specifically set up everything they needed in the living room and the doctor, Bruce Banner, the grinch himself, even took off his lab coat to avoid triggering Peter.
"I have to get some things ready before we leave. You should pack in the meantime as well.", Bucky continued to explain.
All those things should've been awfully heartbreaking on their own but of course that wasn't all of it. It took him a couple of days to notice it but as soon as he did he couldn't get it out of his head until he finally mentioned it to Steve one night.
Wade made a point to make all his movements as predictable and non threatening as possible, as always.
He tried not to be. He really did. Peter was aware of how clingy and dependant he was. Wade had done enough for him and he deserved a little space. Still, Peter felt like he was loosing Wade and holding on tight didn't seem like an option.
"You're not Bucky Barnes... I thought this was his thing.", Wade mumbled before seeing the file that was in a holder that was attached to the chamber.  He grabbed it and flipped it open.
"What the fuck?!", he exclaimed and it was like he flipped a switch, Peter crumbled like a house of cards. The anger left his face and only pure, animalistic fear remained.
"Not yet, not until I know why you're hiding from them.", Bucky replied. He really didn't want Peter to feel cornered and he tried to keep his cool, but he was really freaked out. Peter's reaction didn't help.
"After that we're continuing our journey to your father. The old guy lives in New York right now and I need to attend some buisness in that corner of the world anyways so that's convenient." Peter didn't say anything to that for a while. His fingers tapping against the window and Matt Maeson's voice coming from the radio were the only sounds between them.
Tony's eyebrows drew together in confusion before his eyes widened slightly. "No! No, no, no... that's not what I ment! I'd never send you away, never. I just... I feel inadequate. I don't know how to convince you that we won't harm you. I don't know how to make you believe that you're safe. I- I haven't been a father in such a long time that I have no idea what to do and I'm scared to make a mistake but none of that's on you. And none of that means that I'd kick you out."
"Peter...", Wade sighed and suddenly Peter was on his feet. He stormed over to the door and for a second Tony thought that he'd run off but Peter stayed in the room. That didn't mean that Peter didn't seem incredibly distressed. He had put as much space as possible between himself, Tony and Wade and started to pace anxiously, every muscle strung tight. He fisted his hair with both his hands until his knuckles turned white.
They moved along the dark dingy hallways of the factory as a union. It was riddled with HYDRA agents and soon the noise of the battle drowned out Wade's boxes. There was only the fight, only sweat, blood and fury. He slashed through skin, flesh and bone, he tore them to pieces, those people that dared to take what was his.
. He looked down towards the ground first but there was no sign of Peter. Then, almost as if he had known all along, he looked up and there he was, sitting on the rooftop, his legs dangling over the edge, his expression as blank as ever.
. He already looked cadaverous. His hands moved by themselves, his mind was empty. He found scissor in a drawer. Peter started to tremble when he wrapped his hand around one of the blades. He heard a knock. Was the door locked?
"You know that it wasn't him-", Steve spoke up and Natasha spun back around to face him, all her fury and despair on display.
Peter let out a small chuckle, slightly flustered by all the positivity. "Yeah, and it went pretty well, I mean, at the end she realized she was gay but I think the experience brought us closer together.", he joked.
"What if he doesn't want me?", he then whispered, glancing over at Wade. He regretted it as soon as he saw his expression. Pained and... exasperated? Annoyed? It wasn't pleasant.
"Waffles. I'd really miss your waffles.", Peter replied, a wide smile spreading on his face, glorious but deceptive. There was something more, something Peter wasn't telling him. Wade could hardly blame him.
"Are we having emotions again?", Wade asked and Peter snapped his head up. Furrowed brows, lips pulled into a snear. The expression on his face was pretty damn clear now. Peter was pissed.
Wade took a hold of the glass and downed it before pulling a face. He hadn't had a drink in months, the Stark's were a sober household, no booze. Wade couldn't say that he missed it. "I was hanging out with the Avengers...fell in love...the usual.", he shrugged before dropping his head onto the bar top.
"You don't have to. Nothing could ever make you forget the people you love, not really, I thought you knew that. ", she said with a wink and Peter raised his eyebrows.
After years in dark labs he wasn't used to the sunlight so Wade bought him sunglasses. Now he almost looked like one of these tumblr boys, with his messy hair and clothes, of course if it wasn't for the constant reminder that he was on the brink of starvation.
"No- stop- what's this-?", Peter gasped, struggling in the arms of the guards and he would've fought them off if it weren't for Gwen holding him down as she locked him into the collar.
He didn't look at Wade, his eyes were still pressed shut. But he could hear him sigh before replying.
"And did you, by any chance, act violently ever since you met Natasha?", Tony asked, looking at Natasha now, a smug expression on his face.
"Wade-", Peter asked but Wade ignored him  and got to work on the collar instead. Trying a couple of common number combinations.
"Ah...the other fossil.", Peter nodded slowly, his tone dismissive. As Tony watched his son, he wasn't sure if they were doing more damage than helping here. His son seemed to grow more and more tense by the second. Tony could see a muscle twitch in his jaw and Peter constantly clenched and unclenched his fists before finally running his hands through his hair where he slightly pulled at them.
I hope you enjoyed this! Leave a comment with your thoughts and guesses as to what the ending is gonna be! I'd love to hear your theories!!!
Peter didn't laugh or smile, he didn't reply at all at first. "So, you think I'm scared? And self destructive?", his tone was much colder than Wade expected. When Peter noticed his surprise he tapped against his ears with one finger. "I thought I mentioned the supersenses."
"Wilson, get a grip, please. What are you talking about?", Tony asked, his tone sharp. When he wasn't all mopey Tony was on the agitated side, Wade couldn't blame him.
Tony was sick and tired of waiting for the next catastrophy but there was no way around it, so now they were back to watching Peter's every move while they pretended to not do that.
With a heavy sigh he stroked his hands through his hair. "Okay... you two stay with him. I'll... I'll talk to Tony."
worst. Gwen had been worse. Killing her, ripping her apart, Peter couldn't remember the act itself. He remembered the aftermath though. Waking up with his hands drenched in her blood. Her smashed body at his feet. The realization of what he had done. Her empty eyes staring right through him. That had been the worst.
"I don't care what you said, if you don't bring him back I'll-" He didn't even get to finish his sentence. Death was already laughing at him, it was cold and cruel.
"No. I'm okay with it. If this'll keep me safe from HYDRA we can leave right now, but-", Peter's eyes glanced over at Wade and he didn't like the look the boy was giving him at all. It seemed anxious, worried, that was pretty much the last thing that Wade wanted to make Peter feel. "-can I talk to Wade for a second?", he then asked, looking back at his father. "Alone."
Steve couldn't breathe. Like literally couldn't take a breath. On the outside he probably looked pretty calm, he almost always did but inside it was a whole other picture.
"Damn right.", he mumbled under his breath and Natasha surely heard him but decided to ignore the remark.
His voice was crackly and faint, just like back then, from all the screaming. But it made Gwen laugh. He couldn't see her, she wasn't even in the same room, but both their enhanced hearing helped them to still be there for each other.
"Oh I could never.", Peter chuckled. "But there are a few things I'd miss if I met an untimely demise.", he said, sporting a knowing smile.
"I see why you'd think that. But can't you imagine, for just one second, that maybe people aren't going to reject you?", Wade asked and Peter didn't need to think about that one for long.
before bending over and burying his face in his hands. Peter flinched and pressed himself closer to the headboard but resisted the instinct to jump to the ceiling. Still, his body language must've shown his alarm because as soon as Tony looked up at him again he retreated back into his seat.
Wade was dead. He was pretty sure of it. He almost expected Peter to turn into Lady Death and laugh at him for falling for her prank. But no, this was real. Peter was real and he was asking Wade to stay.
"Yeah...", Peter shrugged. "Surprise! I'm not dead, yay me!",he then added with a slightly awkward smile. When Natasha didn't say anything Tony could see the discomfort creep back into Peter's expression. He had his five minutes of levity. "So? You're a friend of Tony's?", he asked awkwardly, even though he probably read dozens of articles about all of the members of the Avengers. Research about what he missed was one of Peter's few hobbies, though Tony wasn't sure if it actually brought him any enjoyment or if Peter was just trying to catch up on lost time. Tony had felt something like that when he returned from Afghanistan. But he had only been gone for three months, not nine years.
"I see, my reputation proceeds me.", the Skelton now spoke in a female voice, deep and soothing, almost hypnotic.
Tony and Steve had to pack their things, make calls. Peter's father talked to a man named Happy and a woman named Pepper. Peter didn't listen to their conversation. He barely even listened when they addressed him.
"Yeah, yeah I know, I just- I don't know. I just want him to feel safe." Tony tried to give Peter as much space as possible without feeling like he was avoiding him. It was hard to find the right balance in this, especially since his mere presence seemed to stress the boy out immensely.
"Exactly! So stop pulling this shit out of your ass! You'll be fine!",Wade snapped and Peter forced his eyes shut, forced himself to breath slower, forced the quivering to stop.
"What don't you understand about 'behave yourself'?", she asked and if looks could kill Natasha would be six feet under by now.
"That's what I've been telling him. We could star in horror movies together. I look awful and you are awful. ", Wade chuckled before lightly bumping his head against Peter's and his smile made Peter's heart flutter.
Sometimes he wished that his apathy could encompass everything, that he could just stop worrying about everything. Of course that also came with not caring about anything which was something Peter didn't want so he didn't resort to calling up Natasha and asking her if she had some of those psychopaths drugs to spare. Sometimes it was tempting though. Peter was sick of this purgatory that he seemed to be trapped in, where he didn't care about most things but was still conscious enough to notice that that wasn't good while also lacking any motivation to do anything about it. He knew he should care, he knew he didn't.
"What?" Wade wasn't sure who asked, they sounded worried. No point in worrying, it was too late anyways.
"You look great. ", Gwen said, sounding unsure. It was enough to pull Peter out of his paralyzed state.
"Nothing out of the ordinary. Everyone was questioning where you were, though. You know how nosy Nat can be. She probably didn't like to be excluded from a secret. ", Steve shrugged and then they were already in the foyer.
"Found him in a HYDRA base by accident. I was just there for the fun of killing Nazis, you know.", Deadpool shrugged. "Everything about his time there is in this. Though I'm not sure if he'd appreciate you reading this."
"So, what do you want?", Bucky asked, tossing one of the menus over to Peter. His menu cracked when he opened it, the sound of sticky plastic pages, clinging to each other after years of use.
"Morning, wonder twins!", Wade called out.  "Lady-Spidey, can I offer you some waffles? Or is that just a preference for our mutual friend?", he asked Gwen cheerfully.
Steve Rogers wasn't annoyed, no, he was way past that. He was downright pissed when he got the call from the receptionist of Avengers Tower. It wasn't the first time that some random kid showed up and claimed to be Peter Stark, it happened so often that Tony probably lost count.
the air, soon enough he was swinging from tree to tree and he could still hear the gunfire, it was splitting his head open, but his body knew what it was doing.
"You're a shit liar.", Peter stated with a smirk at which Bucky only shrugged in a 'so what?' sort of way. As strange as it was,
He was still asleep when Wade returned, Peter rarely looked this peaceful. His damp hair, now all clean and fluffy, was staring to curl like crazy. Wade felt a soft smile tug at his lips.
"I think he's disassociating. He isn't really here, at least not in his mind.", Wade explained before reaching out to cup Peter's face with his hands, the boy was trembling ever so slightly under his touch, not enough to see it, only to feel.
"You can have the file but that's it and if you wanna read it, I'm not stopping you. I just doubt that he'd like that. Maybe let him make the choice, he rarely got to do that. "
Peter was now easily pulled along by the human guards, unable to resist. Without his enhancements there wasn't much left of Peter, especially not when he was riddled with bullet holes, wounds that wouldn't heal now, at least not as quickly as he needed them to. He was running out of time. They brought him into the building, leading him down countless hallways past dozens of HYDRA agents, guarding the way to Keipon. They were gearing up for a fight. Peter wondered how far away his family was. He wondered if they'd make it before it was too late for Peter.
"Where- What happened to him?!", Steve stammered, looking up at Deadpool. The stranger reached into his backpack and pulled out a file that he pressed into Steve's hands. Bile rose up on his throat when he saw the HYDRA logo printed on top.
Wade knew that, he knew that she warned him but he was stupid and desperate for love so he did this to himself and now he needed her help.
Tony Stark had two of his fingers pressed to his lips, his eyes narrowed at the door, lost in thought. "He's lashing out to get a rise out of you.", Wade said, talking to him directly now.
Peter couldn't help it, he stared at Gwen. It was heartbreaking, what they had done to his friend. The person that used to keep him present, used to keep him human, and he couldn't do it for her.
"Besides, she worked with a friend of mine that went through something similar in HYDRA custody. She helped him lot.", Steve stated. Tony had not personally talked to Bucky about his therapist but Steve had. They were best friends after all and according to Steve, Bucky swore that Dr. Seine saved his life. Now, after two years the former HYDRA asset was mostly stable. More Bucky than Winter Soldier. That's all that Tony wanted for Peter. For him to be more his own person than their experiment.
He looked out the window and only saw light, nothing else. Somehow it wasn't blinding, it was warm and inviting.
"Don't be. I don't blame you. Just, maybe don't do it again?", he suggested with an awkward shrug which actually got Peter to crack the tiniest of smiles.
They walk outside when they’re finished eating. Tony shows Steve the pool in the courtyard, points at the terrace accessible from the bar on the second floor of the main building, at the old stable that’s been turned into a gym and spa for the guests.
Tony gets plenty of daily practice in denying himself the things his biology wants, but he can’t stop himself from taking advantage of the helmet still hiding the direction of his gaze. He watches Steve, watches his muscles move while he walks, his broad shoulders, his beautiful abs, his strong thighs. The shape of his soft cock in his underwear. He remembers the scent of the hollow of Steve’s throat. He remembers Steve’s teeth sinking into his skin for the first time.
Rhodey helps him clean the kitchen while Maria sleeps, and Tony thinks that he should start doing things while Maria sleeps. Instead of just staring at her, terrified of SIDS.
He doesn’t turn around. Steve stares at the nape of Tony’s neck and wonders if he’s touched it for the last time.
There are no Accords here, no Ross, no ultimatums. Everything seems so far away. So inconsequential. Where they really fighting about
He looks small like this, but not weak. Quite the contrary, in fact. His arms and shoulders are muscled, he is visibly strong. His chest is garbled with scars, but toned. His abs are defined; there’s just a thin layer of fat around his navel, which Steve finds so beautiful it’s disarming, honestly, just thinking about it makes him—
He wasn’t drunk, god no—Steve wouldn’t have done anything if Tony had been drunk—but it was enough to make his tongue looser and his heart braver.
When they visit the Duomo, Steve loses himself while staring at the floor, at the complex images created with white, dark green, brown marbles. The columns are made of marble too, stripes of dark and light, and it looks like an optical illusion. It’s so bold and unapologetically aggressive that Steve’s head spins. It’s exhilarating.
“No. About something old that can be used in an unexpected new way,” Tony says. Steve licks his lips, smiles to himself, and resumes reading his book.
A beat, and Steve squints at him. He smiles, the vestiges of his anguish leaving his face, even though they linger in his eyes, outstay their welcome there. “You’re literally wearing my t-shirt. At this exact moment.”
There it is. The barely-contained Alpha rage. Tony’s already mourning the coffee table. He likes that coffee table. That coffee table is gonna be in pieces in a minute.
Tony stops walking and turns to face Steve. “No, I think... Listen, we should... confront our feelings, all of them, regardless of how uncomfortable they make us. I’m willing to work on that. I just need it to be civil, I just need... I can’t do it if we start screaming at each other. I don’t want to do that.”
. He pushes himself up, stumbles into the bathroom and turns on the unforgiving light over the sink. He drinks some water from the tap, washes his face.
Tony feels a tear fall on his thumb, and realizes his vision has gone blurry. He lifts his gaze to find Steve and Stella staring at him.
“Yeah, I was, I was thinking that I could store it inside me, like, in my bones, you know? So I would always have it with me, but... There is a way and I’m reasonably sure that I can do it but, uh... it kinda creeped Rhodey out... I don’t know.”
“Do you guys talk to her in another language, besides English?” the pediatrician asks them when they voice their concern to her.
“You know,” he says, “it’s hard to think that you see me like this. As something that can be immortalized with art. I always try not to look at my chest for too long, but you…”
He drags his underwear down just enough for his cock to spring free, but he can still feel the elastic constricting him, pressing down on his balls, around his ass.
“I know. I’m so sorry. I’ll... we’re trying to fix it, though, remember? Please,” Steve isn’t touching him, but he’s very close, and Tony thinks the top of his hair is brushing against Steve’s beard, against Steve’s lips, maybe. “Please, don’t cry.”
Maria Carbonelli was born on August 10th, 1937, in a big farmhouse in the Chianti hills. After the war, her father Antonio, the only one of the five Carbonelli brothers who didn’t work in the fields, had moved with his wife and daughter to the nearest city, Siena, where he made some money as a high-end tailor for ladies. Soon, he had shops in Florence, Milan, and Rome.
Suddenly, Steve is here, again, but not to help, no, Steve’s on top of him again and he’s grunting and hurting him with everything he has, with all his hate for Tony, with all his love for someone else, and he’s gonna kill Tony, he’s gonna kill him, Tony is gonna die and Tony needs to do something, he can do something, because the suit... the suit is
Tony twists on his torso and searches Steve’s face with his eyes. Steve kisses him, and comes again while he does, moaning softly on Tony’s lips. “Me too,” Tony murmurs.
“I needed you wet and hungry for my knot and your body just did it. You went into heat after ten years because your Alpha needed you in heat. Think about that, Tony. How perfect is that? How amazing?”
When Steve goes up to the penthouse after dinner, Tony isn’t there. He isn’t worried; he knows where Tony is. Maybe he’s just staying behind to keep an eye on something. Around midnight Steve starts to feel too tired to stay on the couch, so he goes to sleep.
Steve has spent most of the day in his room, listening to the sound of the water hitting the windows, reading, catching up on work, getting so bored that he doesn’t even want to head down to the gym and let out some energy because he feels like he has no energy at all. He’s tired from doing basically nothing the whole day. He makes himself a sandwich and eats it while going through his sketchbook.
Tony sees it coming a mile away. Steve steels himself, straightens his shoulders, sighs. He says, “Maybe I’m gonna fuck this up all over again, but…” then goes for it.
Steve places a hand over Tony’s cheek. He caresses the bag under his eye with his thumb. “Sleep now, alright?”
“You know what really pisses me off about the Accords? That none of you believed I could handle Ross when necessary. I’ve been dealing with those kinds of people, with these kinds of messes my whole life, and none of you could stop and think for a minute that maybe I could see a way out. Because how can former Merchant of Death, Ultron-creating, irresponsible man-child, and narcissist extraordinaire Tony Stark possibly know what to do, right?”
“Just let me rest for half an hour or so,” Tony says, trying now for a gentler approach, and feeling like he’s telling Steve a secret. “I’ll come find you in the library.”
The darkness of the cave feels much more comforting and pleasant than the other side, where the sun is already invading the room with its blinding brightness and making it too hot for Tony’s liking.
The bond is still there, still whole, but Tony never reaches for it with his mind, and he never feels Steve do it either. He wonders why Steve doesn’t ask some Wakandan doctor to break it.
They’re over me immediately. They push my face into my own sick. Kick my ribs, my back, my stomach. Break my fingers with the heels of their boots.
“Yeah. Palladium poisoning, from the reactor. Don’t make that face, it’s fine now, it runs on vibranium.”
He hasn’t shaved in a few days, but the edges of his goatee are still there, so he must have kept up with his grooming routine while he was… yeah. He probably lived in some safe house, so he must have had no need to disguise himself, at least not lately. He’s wearing simple clothes, jeans and a shirt.
As soon as they get in, Tony breathes in the familiar smell of old stones, of lavender and lemons, of terracotta and wood, of grass and sun like the hills all around.
Thankfully, Steve hadn’t been rude about it or showed any of the contempt he must have naturally felt. He hadn’t acted scandalized either. Not that he’s a bigot, actually, from what Tony has seen at least, but… oh, hell. He was even nice enough to kiss Tony back, for fuck’s sake. Tony went up on his tiptoes, turned his face just so, hesitated for a moment, and then Steve kissed him, meeting him halfway, too kind to force Tony through the awkwardness of refusing him or the annoyance of putting him back in his place. But no matter how inexplicably good Steve’s reaction was, the mess had been made and there was no turning back. Tony remembers saying goodbye, even calling Steve
Images flash across his mind, and not for the first time (nor, he believes, for the last) Steve wishes he could forget something he’s seen.
They shower together, with no purpose other than to get clean. Steve rubs body wash into Tony’s skin, massages his tired muscles, caresses his hair with ridiculously expensive anti-yellowing shampoo, kisses him under the hot spray of the water like it’s raining and they’re in a scene from an old movie. Tony’s fingers scrub Steve’s scalp, and it’s slow, and it’s tender, and there’s no hurry at all. They dry each other off and get in bed, under the covers.
The words shake Steve down to his core. Hearing Tony say that to Sarah was one thing, but having him say it again now, so seriously...
Tony sniffs. “It’s, it’s nothing, I’m, it’s stupid, I just... she looks very happy here. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her so happy.”
It doesn’t take a genius to understand that it’s Tony’s slick that’s doing the trick of making the rut slow down.
He pushes a hand in Tony’s hair and wishes he had Tony’s dick in his mouth, that he had something to do except feeling every single thing Tony is doing to him.
Steve covers Tony’s face with his hand and ruffles his hair. “Shut up,” he says, laughing. Tony kisses Steve’s thigh and falls asleep.
Tony thinks that Steve doesn’t have anything to be sorry about. He just tried to pay him a compliment, that’s all. To be honest, it felt nice to be looked at with appreciation. That’s why he says, “Thanks.”
A part of his mind idly wonders why this is setting him off now. They have talked about Howard already. It’s not the first time, it’s not—
It’s a sick game, a show of power (as though daily sexual violence isn’t enough), but it was never meant to starve him. Still, Tony is all flesh and bones now.
Bucky watches her, curious and anxious. She seems to think briefly about something, then she stops drinking and fiddles with the edge of the glass.
He’s about to go back inside and try to reach him on his phone, but he’s struck with an idea. More like an epiphany, really.
