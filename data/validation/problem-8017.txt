“Friday, what’s on my to-do list?” he asked as he entered his lab.
They waited for a few more minutes.
They quickly sat in the car and adjusted themselves.
The person caught Tony’s eye contact and tensed up.
“But seriously,” Sam said. He decided to change the topic. “Does he know? Have you told him about your feelings?”
“Guess someone is late for the party,” Clint said.
Tony has an interview with the campus' best journalist student aka Christine Everhart. Natasha and Jessica think the pairing results might have been manipulated. And Clint is still angry with Natasha...
“Try to get out of the wheelchair and see what I’ll do to you.” Steve deadpanned.
A teenage boy was now flying in the air. The flamethrowers and wings were too heavy for him. He was diving straight to the road.
“Yeah, I like to race plus I have a driver’s license,” Natasha rolled her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
At this time, Thor landed beside Iron Man. “It’s because they want to take over this entire planet,” he answered.
“Mum, these are my friends,” Tony enthusiastically said. “Meet Steve, Natasha, Clint, Thor and Bruce. Guys, meet my mum.”
And then he vomited all over the wooden floor.
“Yeah, it’s the master bedroom, opposite this.” They all turned back.
“It’ll be nice to have all these in my portfolio,” Clint smiled.
“Just tell him you’re home and then you’re done. No need to have a long conversation.”
If you've got any feedback, drop it at the comments below!:)
Spiderman didn’t say anything for a while. He was just looking out at the night skies slowly turning brighter. Steve thought he wasn’t going to say anything and was about to leave.
“Where are they running to?” Clint asked. He gave the shuttlecock a nice blow.
“Pardon?”
“I know, Cap,” Tony whispered back. “You always got me.”
“Sorry,” Tony coughed and rolled away from Steve.
“I have an idea,” Thor said. “I can bring the stones to the Puddle of Truth at Iceland and soak them. The All-father has told me about this. It will soften the stones, thus weakening them. I can use Mjolnir to annihilate it entirely.”
“Oh Thor,” Clint smiled. “That’s sweet of you but my bones are just fine, thank you.” He gave Thor’s shoulder a pat.
“Mr. Stark,” a female voice suddenly spoke up. “I’m Friday, and I run your armor, most of the time. I’m only activated when Jarvis has been disabled. There are intruders, Mr. Stark, and they’re headed for the communal level.”
After one last feeding session, the babies were placed into their respective cots. Linda and Kayla had agreed to sleep in the room with the babies, which they did. Wanda took the master bedroom, while the rest of them took the living room.
“It’s nice!” Tony smiled. “Let it dry.” He stood up to place the painting under the ceiling fan for it to dry.
The team is fighting the Frost Giants plus we get to know what Tony has for Bucky and Steve.
“How do you think Tony is?” Steve asked.
“Oh God, Jarvis?” Steve asked when he saw what he was carrying.
He had missed Steve looking guiltily at him go.
After a few seconds, his world went black.
Steve felt himself black out for a second. He quickly regained his composure, and leapt to where Clint was. Thor managed to climb up despite the resistance (like debris), and stood near their coffee table. He looked determined.
Why was his heart beating so fast? Why did he suddenly want to talk to his dad, to ask him so many questions about the company and about their relationship?
“And I can assure they’re all delicious,” Jarvis confirmed.
He slowly got up and made his way to the stairs. He took a step at a time, so as to not fall down. His vision was returning back to normal and the muffled voices calling his name started to get clearer. Soon, he successfully reached down and made his way to his friends to assure them that everything was fine.
“Hey, keep your phone away,” Steve whispered to Tony.
“Hell yeah!” Clint smiled smugly.
Tony nodded his head, a light smile gracing his tired features. “Yeah, I definitely said that. On a side note, what’s on the docket today?”
“I will sir,” Jarvis replied. “But you will label the boxes according to your mood.”
“That’s my good girl,” Tony was cooing at her. “It’s delicious isn’t it.” He wiped the side of Natasha’s mouth when drops of milk were running down.
“He went back to sleep,” Clint yawned. “He was awake for two full minutes before knocking back out. He asked for you, Steve.”
Tony woke up when he heard Steve’s voice. He had never heard it this tight and furious before. He slowly got up. Even in his disoriented state, he saw the rage flashing on Steve’s face. And little Tony was scared. He gulped when he looked into Steve's blue eyes, now sparkling in anger.
“Tonee?” Clint’s sob came out. “You ugly!” Clint screamed at the Frost Giant.
Steve nodded. He was looking outside the window which was a few meters in front of him. He was looking at the orange sky, which had a bit of navy blue hue mixed with it. His gaze seemed, faraway.
“Yeah… yeah sir everything is fine,” Steve managed, and proceeded to take a sip of red wine. The maître d nodded his head while smiling, and walked away.
“Well fuckity fuck!” Clint exclaimed in a high-pitched voice. He was throwing his clothes around in the walk-in closet. “My brown socks are missing, Tony.”
**There's vomiting in this chapter**
Tony could see how proud Steve was of bringing him here. Being the dork Steve was, he was trying to hide his pride.
“Is Thor okay?” Sue asked, concerned.
“What are you doing?” Bruce was amused.
“I added sugar and the powder, just like how we do it in our apartment,” Thor shrugged. He tried the coffee and nearly dropped the pot. “I apologize friends. I think I may have poured salt in this instead of sugar.”
“They all woke up at around 4. So I brought them to my bed and was telling them a bed time story. They fell asleep around me.” Steve chuckled at the memory. But his eyes looked sad.
“How about the second portal?” Thor asked.
Everyone turned to stare at him.
“I wasn’t told about you being here either, Stark,” Steve crossed his arms and avoided eye contact with Tony. He was staring at the machine instead. The light color changed to red and shone on Steve’s face. No pun intended but that made Tony look at Steve in a whole new light; because sure, that’s how Steve must be feeling.
“You didn’t tie up your gold locks today?” Steve asked while walking out of the house.
“I already love this place,” Tony smiled, looking up at the dangling lights. “Nice vibe.”
“Don’t worry my girl, I know what I’m doing,” Tony smiled.
“Not in a bad way,” Clint added to ease Tony. “Just… in a… wow this happened, kinda way.”
“Did you guys see Jackie Chan’s one?” Clint was grinning. “I have mad respect for that man!”
Tony nodded his head, impressed. Bruce felt a stare. He turned towards the swing set. Natasha was seated on it and Clint was pushing it. She was staring at Bruce, but once she got his eye contact, she looked away.
After Steve agreed to watch the match, Clint dashed down the stairs and ran out of the mansion to the grass patch. Two workers were setting up the net, with Jarvis overseeing them. There was a bench near the courts, and Natasha and Bruce were seated on it.
Tony pursed his lips at Steve’s joke. He stabbed at his rainbow cake mercilessly and ate a piece, not breaking eye contact from Steve.
“It shall be you and I, friend Bruce!” Thor grinned enthusiastically. They both exchanged a fist bump.
“Yeah.”
Steve looked sad for a second, but his facial features turned cold.
would be the right word. Threatened to inform Bruce and unleash the Hulk at him in his lab. His girl Friday can be mean at times.
“How do you know the measurements?” Steve finally asked, after a minute of silence.
Tony relaxed on him, feeling so happy that he knew who Bruce Banner was. People always misunderstood him, thinking that the monster and he are one. But they weren’t. Heck, the Hulk wasn’t a monster. He was more of a kid with anger management issues. And Bruce was a great friend and a great mentor. He was one of the greatest scientists of their time, no doubts on that.
But really, Tony couldn’t help but wonder what was stressing his dad out so much.
Linda was checking Wanda by continuously patting her back. She was messing with Bruce’s animal toys, which Bruce didn’t seem to mind. He had joined her. Whatever shock Wanda was in, was long gone. Bucky had joined them too, after a while. They were throwing the toys around one another, making weird noises and laughing at the noises they were making.
Howard easily pushed Maria and Steve to the side, and stepped right into Tony’s space. “You’re a fucking joke!” he shouted at Tony.
“I think he found out something he wasn’t supposed to find out,” Tony shrugged. “On a side note, can I borrow your phone? Best to give Natasha a heads up.”
Hi guys. Sorry for the delay for posting this chapter.
Reed raised both eyebrows at what he had heard. Sue cleared her throat, not knowing what exactly Tony had meant by that. Johnny was trying so hard not to burst out laughing and was quaking, prompting Ben to place a hand on his shoulder to signal him to calm down.
“What do you want?” Tony asked.
*Nothing too gory in this chapter, but just a mention of blood.*
“I can clean him up,” Bruce nodded his head. He turned to give instructions to Friday, the AI running Tony’s armor. “Can you fly the armor back to Tony’s lab and shut it down?”
“Well, good. Hash it out, oh Captain my Captain,” Tony smiled. He turned to Natasha, who shook her head at him.
Natasha walked across the room to the glass paneled windows to look at the sea. The view was simply marvelous.
“Hurss.” He pouted at Steve.
His genius mind connected all the dots. So, he was in a relationship… with Captain America! He let out a loud gasp.
“I got you, baby,” Steve said determinedly.
I'm so sorry for the delay.
“I feel conflicted. After all the decisions I made, I just don’t know if I can pick up that shield again.”
“Then follow me.” Doctor Strange turned to go to the door.
“The first thing tomorrow morning, we are burying that stone at the back of the house, deep.” Bruce stated.
Tony realized that the four of them were looking at him from the swing set. He exhaled loudly and gave them all a thumbs up. Clint decided to go and help him up.
“Clint, I can’t go any way! We’ll fall off the cliff if I go right!” Tony rolled his eyes while Bruce let out a laugh.
In the other car, Thor was the first one to realize that Tony wasn’t following them anymore. He was sitting behind and started to freak out when he didn’t see the black car.
Tony and Scott giggled at what they heard. Steve cleared his throat.
Steve immediately stood up. He pulled his shield out, which had been strapped to his back all along.
Jane’s face flushed. She looked away, at the light grey sky. “I’m okay.”
“Not long, I had just entered.”
No one replied to her. Tony broke away from Steve, and looked at them, with tears in his eyes. He wiped them away, and nodded his head.
“A bad guy did. We’re here to help you,” Natasha said before Clint could open his mouth to reply.
“You know, dad always said if you saw me you will be as disappointed as he is.” Tears gathered in the little boy’s chocolate brown eyes. His lips wobbled, and he looked at his palms. “Maybe that’s true because dad never loved me. So will you, Cap…”
“Oh Tony, it’s so good to see you!” she gave his cheek a kiss.
He gestured for Sam to sit on the chair beside his bed. “Well, that’s one way to put it.”
He was feeling very nervous.
Steve passed a cone of cookies and cream ice cream to Tony. He grabbed it and took a huge lick.
That night, Steve insisted he should sleep in the room with the babies. Sam and Kayla slept downstairs while Linda took the master bedroom.
“Sorry to interrupt, but why are our heavy hitters backup?” Tony asked, frowning. “I can do air reconnaissance.”
“Sue, I can’t seem to pull it back,” Reed whispered to her looking puzzled.
It was very quiet in the jet. The air was filled with tension. No one wanted to say anything. The jet had just left the continent of Africa. They were flying above water now. Tony could put the jet in auto pilot mode. But he chose not to. He decided to have manual control so that he did not have to turn back to face the others.
There were a couple of wind chimes, made of metal, hanging near the place where Steve and Tony were standing. The warm Malibu wind made them rustle, and that sound was the only sound that was heard for a solid few seconds.
“Please, Tony,” his mother looked at him. “He’s at his office. Just a hi would do.”
“Look at my little boy!” Wanda cooed. Bruce started to giggle.
Thor and Iron Man were still in Iceland with the stone. But it was close to getting very soft, so they were mentally preparing themselves to shut the portal.
“Whatever,” Tony huffed.
Bruce sighed and managed to contain his anger. He really adored his friend and couldn’t stand what his dad did to him. He really wished he could report Howard Stark, but Tony wouldn’t allow that. Too much of unwanted press attention would come his way. And Tony hated that.
He looked at the floor. Tony knew that if Bruce was feeling dejected, he would look down. He walked towards the sad man and placed a hand on his shoulder. He gave it a small squeeze.
The computer screen on the side of the pilot’s seat lit up. Both of them turned to look at it.

“Yes,” Professor Williams smiled apologetically. “The group project naturally carries the most weightage, with 60% percent of your grade. And then there’ll be two individual assignments, one of which is for you to present to me a unique item in your possession and the other is a simple quiz.”
Please leave a feedback on how the story is so far! :D
“Nice to hear you, F.R.I.D.A.Y,” Clint smiled.
“So team, give me your Communicards because I’m gonna tweak them,” Tony said.
Hi everyone! I hope you guys are having a good day. Thank you for the support so far! You guys are awesome! For now, happy reading!:)
“Alright, jeez little one, give me a second.” Tony forgot about Clint being his teammate, gave him a kiss on his cheek. Clint gave out a giggle, which sounded like a scream. “Alright here we go!”
When Clint couldn’t hit it up on time, he sighed dramatically. “How can he smash it!!!!?” Clint shouted.
Tony’s grin melted out of his face. He turned to look at his friends one last time before following Howard’s figure to the boardwalk.
However that was all in the future. The team was living in the present. And they all knew things were going to be fine. Deep down, they knew that their unity would enable them to take down the foes no single heroes could.
Tony caught the hammer. He called down lightning and slammed the hammer onto the AIM guy that was holding his ankle. Tony then scrambled to where the couch was and climbed onto it. Once he passed Mjolnir back to Thor, he watched the others fighting the AIM personnel with fervor. And he was still wondering what quality he had that enabled him to join this group of heroes.
“Thanks for the faith,” Tony smirked at him.
Jan lent him her phone and threw Tony a look laced with concern.
“Accidentally you say?” Tony had a sly smile. Reed chuckled at that. “So, what would you like me to do?”
Tony shook his head. “Nothing mom. Just… just a memory.”
“Wawa!” baby Bruce walked towards Wanda with his little giraffe doll. She carried him and placed him on her hips.
“You trust Obi so much?” Steve asked, frowning, while taking another bite off his beef burrito. “I mean, the accusation is coming from your dad, his own business partner.”
By 4pm, Steve and the others had already started to panic. They tried calling Tony’s phone many times, but he didn’t pick it up. They left him a spam of messages, which was left unread.
Clint ran and tackled Tony. Bruce caught the remote while Wanda took the movie collection. Sam’s eyebrows shot up. Bucky tried to stop them. But it was impossible with just one hand.
“My parents ran out of here with my older brother and some guy pushed me down,” she said, pouting a little. “They didn’t really come back for me. So I’m just hiding here. It’s fun to watch the Avengers anyway, especially Black Widow!”
Hey everyone! It's Friday and finally the weekend is here!
Hawkeye fired an electro-arrow straight into the portal. There was a sudden charge of electricity, which stopped the Frost Giants from coming out for a few seconds. He fired an explosive arrow right after that. Some of the Frost Giants fell back into the portal. Others partially melted.
“How’s mum?”
“But it wasn’t easy,” Linda added. “A mother was willing to buy it at a lower price. Even lower than what they sold at the supermarket!”
The first second of him touching the stone, Clint felt a sharp pain on his palm. But that pain subsided quickly. A wave of purple passed across the entire basement. The stone dropped onto the floor.
Tony took in a deep breath. “I think… I think we should start again. Because the last time we spoke, about to kiss… Strucker and the Helicarrier happened.”
“Thanks Wanda,” Tony smiled at her. “And thanks to you too, Pe- Spidey.”
Tony, they definitely took a short cut,” Natasha sighed. They continued cruising down the road, with Thor telling Natasha that they have to reach first. Steve simply sat back and enjoyed the wind.
“What the fuck,” Natasha said.
The others laughed and then waved at them. By now, Chippy was standing beside the two girls. Bucky was patting him; he had no heart to leave Chippy behind. The dog jumped onto him, clawing on his thighs and trying to lick his hand.
“Tony,” Steve mumbled. He started to pat Tony’s head. “We got you.”
“And sometimes you have really foul moods,” his girl Friday added on. “There’s even a box at your lab that says,
“But they will be coming soon,” Wanda spoke. “Will we be prepared?”
“We have a few slices of toasted bread with peanut butter.” Kayla offered.
“Like a man out of time,” Tony completed the sentence. “I know Cap. I feel that too. I know that this is my future. But me, my four-year-old self doesn’t belong here.”
“Alright we make this fair then,” Bruce spoke up. He joined Tony to pick a film. “We plan a strategy and then we watch a movie.”
“Pleased to meet you too, Cap!” Scott said. He too looked very excited.
“We will.” Kayla nodded her head. “See you guys in the funny papers!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah he is!” Tony assured him. Peter placed his head back on Tony's chest and snuggled closer to his neck. Tony held him protectively for a few more seconds. He gave the boy's back a few pats. “Thor, bring in the miracle liquid to the convenience store, buddy.
“Friend Steve, that’s absolutely disgusting! I thought you had feelings for friend Tony?” Thor’s face scrunched up.
Jarvis cried.
“You know, when Jarvis told us you had come here to work, I felt like I fell into some alternate dimension,” Clint said as he munched on his Caesar salad.
“Look who’s back!” Clint smiled.
The team had made sure Thor knew how earth stuff worked. Hence, they taught him the basics of ordering anything (from food to clothes) and also showed him what happens during Halloween. After nearly 2 years being with the Avengers, Thor even mastered the use of a mobile device, although he doesn’t really like it.
caught. Tony, if you can scan for locations of the cybernauts, give us a heads up. Avengers Assemble!!”
Clint snickered at that.
“It’s fine. I get to be invisible at times,” she joked. Tony chuckled at that. “But… it’s Reed.”
There were some flashes of images Tony was looking at. The first was the explosion in the wormhole, during the Battle of New York, which was coming towards him. The second was of him firing repulsor blasts at the Chitauri army which was coming out of the portal. The third was more of a voice warning him about his armor integrity. It was his girl F.R.I.D.A.Y. She was calling out his name, sounding very frightened.
“The rest of us, here, we try to push the armies back. Thor, you need to find the main guy. I’ll talk to the Defenders and join you,” Tony just kept on firing orders. “I’ll try to link all our comms together.”
“Does this meeting involve Pepper? Her wrath is one of a kind,” Thor said, sounding bright.
“It’s the Avengers!” one of the scientists pointed at the figures standing near the door. “We need to regroup!”
“What the hell, Barton?!”
Both of them broke free from one another and rushed to the door. Once they opened it, they were confused at what was going on.
Clint turned away to wipe his tears. “Yeah, we gotta thank you for that.”
“What?” Steve snapped, surprising Tony.
The others were about to stop him, but Steve stopped them instead. He allowed Tony to go to the Hulk. The Hulk turned to look at little Tony, and his look softened. He went closer to the little boy.
“Me too,” Jenny nodded her head politely. “What can I do for you?”
Steve looked at Bruce for a brief moment before looking at Tony, who was on his lap. Tony was fiddling with his own hands. Steve’s face brightened up.
“Steve, take it,” Tony sounded firm.
He sighed. That was when he remembered something. The night before, he had woken up in pain and had asked for Steve. He had wanted to see him and maybe, talk to him. But before anything could happen, he had fallen back asleep.
“This is Iron Man?” Tony asked in awe. He took the Iron Man bear and examined it. “I actually made a suit of armor…”
Steve woke back up at 5am after a nap that was neither light nor deep. He realized that he had completely lost his battle against sleep. So, he wanted to make himself coffee. He got up, only to realize that Tony was not on the couch.
He made sure all the kids slept well on his shoulders before he placed them onto the cot.
“Ah, there they all are,” Jarvis smiled while walking to the pool area. “Master Stark, you missed breakfast. And here’s some orange juice to wake you up.”
“Just…” he scratched his head. “Uh, Happy here is scared he’ll be demoted because of the Hydra fiasco.”
He bent down to give Tony a hug. He wrapped his arms around a surprised Tony, squeezing him slightly. “Mr. Stark, thank you so much, for everything you’ve said and done for me.” Peter whispered. Tony was reluctant at first, but hugged him. He gave Peter’s back a couple of pats.
“Friday, how many bags came in?” Tony asked as he walked in, making an entrance.
On day 2, Tony and friends go for a little racing, hang out together and basically have as much fun as they could. Also, Jarvis sees Steve kissing Tony.
“I would cheat on Steve for you,” he winked at her. “Don’t tell him that.”
“Please take care, Captain. I am still not sure about Barnes,” T’Challa spoke. His hands were behind his back.
Sorry for the delay, again.
“Oh?” Tony said and turned back, not expecting a reply from her this fast.
“Tonee!” she squealed before giving him a nice kick on his belly.
“Yeah Steve,” Tony tried to smile. “I guess, I’m alright.”
Even Steve and Spiderman winced at Tony’s tone.
“I want to see what Tony was so fond of,” he grinned. “Where are they?”
“But I didn’t know I could lift Mjolnir,” Tony raised both his hands up, as if he was surrendering.
That was when Howard Stark decided to enter.
“Ugh, I wish I could lock him away somewhere else,” Clint rolled his eyes.
“You’re strong. You have willpower,” Steve replied. “Don’t worry about your future, Tony. You made it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The slap landed on Tony’s right cheek very hard. The sound echoed in the now seemingly silent house. Baby Tony fell down, and he was struggling to open his eyes. The pain was so immense, that he couldn’t even cry out loud, but tears were flowing out of his eyes. Clint crawled towards Tony. Doctor Strange was staring at Tony, in shock.
“I’ll do it for Cap.” He said. “For you Cap!” Tony cried out.
Peter’s face brightened up. “Thank you, Tony. And… your goatee is nice.” Tony looked down at the floor and chuckled.
“Okay Tony, you choose. You want to sleep in your own room or with Steve?” Natasha asked. She pointed two fingers at him, indicating that he had to choose. Tony picked her middle finger, not really surprising everyone.
“What the hell happened? Why were we naked?” Natasha asked. She looked pretty surprised.
“Oh, Tony? Don’t be so surprised at the state of Steve’s and your level,” Bruce warned.
For now, happy reading:)
“Realization?” Steve’s voice was heard.
Sam managed to get up. His back was hurting terribly. Linda found another plastic box and they immediately begun clean up. Kayla ushered the other kids to the kitchen.
“Looks like it’ll take another big issue for us to gather back here again,” Wanda sighed.
“Pun!!” Tony and Bruce said at the same time. The gave each other a fist bump while Clint, looking frazzled, jogged to where their car was parked.
Everyone could feel the atmosphere in the living room. It was pretty serious, mixed with a little sadness. Everyone were going to miss the little kids. But serious things were coming their way and they needed the Avengers.
“Is everything okay?” Natasha asked, brushing back her seawater soaked hair but now dry, back.
Tony ran out of the apartment, leaving a confused yet concerned Steve to pick up the tank top Tony had tossed onto his study table.
Clint fell to his knees and let out a long groan, while Thor was jumping around in glee. Natasha went to literally pick Clint up.
“Fuck off!” Howard shouted. “Get out of my fucking sight!”
“Just came here to say hi,” Tony said. He was looking everywhere except for his father’s eyes.
“No, I need to tell you how brave you and your friends are,” Kayla was smiling. “I couldn’t face this. But you guys are really brave.”
“I can,” Tony scoffed.
The elevator doors opened and Tony almost fell in. He pressed for his level and leaned against the wall, sighing in relief once he’s in the all clear.
“You guys are so lame,” Natasha scoffed.
Tony was still in the medical unit in the helicarrier. His only serious injury was a minor concussion and he had collapsed because of exhaustion. The rest were scratches, cuts and bruises. Mjolnir had really saved him there.
“Of course,” Bruce piped in. “Coffee makes you full.”
“Scott you’re a badass!” Rhodey cheered. “I’m looking right at what you’re doing!”
“Just like the good old days, right Steve?” Tony stretched. Steve kicked the room door shut. “Chinese takeout and a movie.”
After that, she immediately dialed a number and sat back.
The six of them then ate the strawberries in silence. They were looking at the splendid view of the sea and were enjoying the breeze. Even though the silence was comfortable, Clint didn’t want it to last.
If you've got any feedback, you can leave a comment below. I'd be more than happy to read and reply! :)
“Look at you, all blushing,” Natasha laughed. And that got Tony’s attention. He saw Steve outright blushing and chuckled to himself.
“Stebeee.” Tony’s little voice by his ear was enough for him. Steve quietly hugged back, tears forming in his eyes again.
“We need to work with the Defenders,” Steve said. “Split up with them and slow the Frost Giants down from both portals.”
“Everyone?” Steve asked, the tips of his ears turning red.
The Hulk raised his arms to take Tony. He hesitated for a while, thinking he was just a big sack of destruction and trouble. But Tony’s innocent look and hope shining in his eyes was more than enough to convince even the Hulk, that he had second chances no matter what.
Hey everyone, how are all of you? I hope you are having, or going to have a great a weekend ahead of you!
“I am aware of the relationship you share with Master Stark,” Jarvis said. He joined Steve, and stood beside him. “I know how painful this must be for you.”
Tony shook his head. He was still trying to catch his breath.
Tony was hoping Bruce would calm down as the sounds around them were triggering; Hydra soldiers fighting, Widow Bites, Thor’s hammer hitting the men and Steve’s shield slamming onto a soldier who let out a scream.
Tony’s eyes widened when he suddenly felt Steve stroke his manhood. He let out a moan when Steve did it harder. Both his hands flew to Steve’s shoulders, and he squeezed them. Tony’s thighs were quivering, and he felt like screaming, losing patience at Steve’s speed. He bucked his hips, wanting more. Steve had noticed this.
Thor turned to look at the stone. It was getting softer, with the purple vanishing.
“Hey Steve,” Tony called out. “How do I look?”
“Surely Mr. Stark,” the maître d smiled back. “Just follow me.”
“Can you three stop?” Natasha asked. She tried prying Clint off. Tony was coughing and Bucky was patting his back.
“Does it still hurt?” Steve turned to ask Tony.
“Yeah sure,” Tony scoffed. “Anyway, I’m done here.”
“It’s four in the morning,” she replied. Her phone vibrated and she answered it. “Yeah Clint? Yes we’re coming now tell Fury to get ready.” She slowly walked out of his room.
“That I am,” Tony grinned as he walked with Sue.
“We’re all always worried about Tony,” Natasha let out a little laugh.
Jarvis identified a couple running around looking for a child right outside the park. Tony immediately flew down to them.
“Actually, I uh, I got to go. Got homework and things to study for,” Peter smiled.
After a few minutes, Steve started to talk. “Kayla, are you alright?”
“Stevie, you’re needed downstairs.” Bucky poked his head around the door. “Oh I’ll be right ba- “
I hope you're having a good one. Thank you for all your support so far!
Natasha pursed her lips. “He was just fine. He was a fine darling, Tony.”
“Yeah, in case
“That might not end well,” Steve said.
“Oh,” Tony blinked. “I’m more of a coffee guy. Well I can settle it downstairs.”
“No, it’s okay,” Tony waved it off. “It’s gonna be fun with you guys.”
“I was worried,” Steve sighed. “But I’m so glad it’s nothing serious. How are you?”
“They’re so good! I could eat this all day!” Clint answered with a mouthful of toast. “Do you have coffee?”
Steve shook his head and wiped some water out of his face. “I’m fine.” He said. When the others refused to believe him, he gave them a reassuring nod.
“I uh… I wanted to drop you home,” Tony said softly. “You can get dried there and rest.”
Leave a comment or feedback, I'll be happy to read them! :D
Iron Man flew down and stood in front of the two Frost Giants, taking them by full surprise. The leader raised his hand to place it on the pendant and closed his eyes. But before he could activate it, Scott pulled the chain out. The right-hand Giant pointed at the falling chain and gasped. Upon feeling something slipping, the leader opened his eyes.
When Tony’s arms neared the handle, blue sparks appeared on it. They were moving downwards, to where Tony’s hand was going to land. There was a crackling sound, soft but audible enough for everyone seated there. Thor frowned, wondering what was actually happening. Mjolnir let out a buzz, and when Tony touched the handle, the sparks and sounds stopped.
And it all happened in a flash. Suddenly there was Jarvis holding Howard’s hand to stop him from giving the slap and Tony was shielded by Steve’s warm body. Even Maria Stark was standing there, protecting her son from her husband.
“Yeah,” Rhodey agreed. “I improved for sure.”
He really loved and appreciated the comfort Steve was providing right now.
“Then?” Tony looked at Clint expectantly.
“Tony,” Steve turned to him. “Don’t take this personally. But right now, you’re really weak. I need you to get to safety and get the civilians out of here.”
Tony’s cheeks went beet red. But what he found even more unbelievable was the fact that Howard actually had a photo of him in his office. For someone who hadn’t cared about Tony for a long time, that was easily an odd behavior.
But Rhodey frowned while Vision just stared at him.
“Thanks Tony,” Clint smiled.
The visitor is asking to be punched by Captain America. And a new character arrives!
Pepper laughed, letting Tony into the office. She closed the doors. “I’m not gonna demote him, honestly, his team did such a great job with the evacuation.”
“You are our friend. You can tell us anything,” Thor smiled.
Tony saw Reed’s back first and brisk-walked towards him. But he stopped dead on his tracks when he saw who Reed was talking to.
The rest of them were looking at Tony with a mixture of utter shock and surprise. Not only was Tony worthy, but he could control the hammer and call lightning, just like Thor. There was also a very light blue aura surrounding Tony. He looked mystical, nearly God-like.
“The cots will come in another 3 hours,” Bruce informed Tony.
“Hey Tony!” Steve exclaimed and grabbed his boyfriend. They stopped at the edge of the cliff and watched the shooting star disappear completely into the horizon.
“Wait,” Tony said before grabbing Steve’s arm. Steve stopped walking and looked at Tony’s hand on his arm, without saying anything. Tony knew that Steve could easily yank out of his grip. But he didn’t. Tony released his grip. “Hey uh Steve… I just wanted to um… I’m sorry I snapped at you.”
“Good night Tony,” Steve said as he walked out of the elevator.
“Tony, are you… okay?” Sue looked at him worriedly. He was just rooted to the ground, like a stone statue.
called. The differences are being worked out. And when our team unites, we can take down any force.”
“Maybe all these… was worth it,” Tony sighed. He looked up at the ceiling. “I mean… adult me gets to meet you. That’s enough reason to be happy!”
Tony stopped dead on his tracks. He looked down and groaned in frustration.
Steve jumped up. He didn’t know where the sudden burst of energy came from. But he knew one thing for sure; no one hits
“Yeah right,” Tony huffed. “Cut the bullshit and tell me the truth.”
Tony and Thor stopped.
The lightning streaks stopped hitting the hammer.
“What memory?” his mom asked him.
“Holy shit!” he exclaimed.
“No you wouldn’t have,” Clint pursed his lips and gave Thor a sarcastic look.
“Your friends are brave,” Howard said, his back facing his son. “I like them.”
Tony relaxed his body, and his hands ran up his thighs as he slowly rose up to a full standing position.
I hope you all are enjoying this so far!
“Let’s go.” Steve immediately swung an arm around Peter. “Is your aunt here?”
“Yeah. Kind of missed that already,” Steve agreed.
Bruce laughed a hearty laugh, that even showed the crinkles by his eyes. He then carried little Tony to the machine. The machine looked like a giant capsule with doors. Bruce placed Tony inside. He gave him a reassuring smile, a wave, and then closed the doors.
**There's slight angst too :")**
Steve was looking at Sam. He smiled. “Of course. We just have to look forward to the future, Sam. Let the past be in the past. Let the present keep going.” He gave a surprised looking Sam a pat on his shoulder and walked off.
Thanks to the Bifrost, Bruce Banner was transported back to Earth. He knew it was stupid of him to ignore Natasha and fly off to God knows where. But he somehow arrived in Asgard. Thor showed him around. Bruce did feel peaceful in Asgard. However, he had this constant feeling that he needed to go home. He was glad Ultron was destroyed. And then a Civil War occurred which split up his team into two factions.
Tony sighed. He was holding his left elbow while staggering back to the room without a word. He wanted to take the couch but Clint insisted that he slept in the room instead. Plus, Wanda took the bigger couch, leaving Tony with the two-seater one, which wasn’t really accommodating. Hence he moved up, leaving Wanda and the 2 girls down.
After finding a locker for their bag, the six of them walked briskly to the roller coaster ride. Soon, they were seated, secured and ready to ride. Once the green light was given, everyone sat back, feeling the adrenaline starting to pump. When the roller coaster picked up speed, Thor started to scream a manly scream, and made Bruce crack up. When the roller coaster speedily descended, Thor’s high-pitched screaming reached an even more impossible higher pitch.
*There's a fair amount of swearing in this entire story*
Ana went to the stove and grinned at what she saw. There were French toasts on plates with a beautiful color, and bacon strips looking crispy and fine. There were fresh looking pancakes too, stacked on top of one another. That was made by Thor, who said he had used a secret recipe, which was his mother's.
That was when Tony felt his stomach churn. Damn that Hydra serum, it was about to ruin his life. Wait who was he kidding? It already ruined his life.
Thor motioned for the boys to come to where he was kneeling. He collected the liquid and stored it in the glass ornament, before splashing some at the boys.
Bruce went towards the nearest pile. Mustering up enough courage, he managed to lift the clothes up.
Steve settled Tony on his hips and walked towards the window. Both of them looked at the cornflower blue skies, and Steve wiped away the little boy’s tears.
At this point, Tony was wondering if his armor could take the pressure or not. He sighed, because he did the math and he already knew the answer.
“Did you just replace the word ‘sexy’ from that song lyric?” Clint asked. He raised an eyebrow at Tony.
“I’ll see what I can do,” Tony ruffled his hair.
How do you think the rest of them will react to Natasha leaving? Please leave a comment, I'd love to hear your thoughts so far!
“Uh, your clothes are on the bed,” Linda said and dragged Kayla out of the room without a backward glance.
Thor was already up, with a nosebleed. And the Hulk was ready for some hardcore smashing.
The Cloak did listen. But it only unwrapped itself after gently caressing Tony’s red cheek and ruffling Clint’s hair. Baby Tony giggled in the midst of tears falling.
Rhodey huffed. “Well, you’re lucky he isn’t here. Or he would have shut you up for good.”
“Why? Because I came down to the lab?” Tony wiped his tears. He was still trying to stop laughing. “You told me so much about the stone! I was only trying to look for cracks, which are present. The outer layer of the stone is grey but deep inside, it’s purple. That’s unique you know.”
What is Tony going to do about Howard's accusation?
“Welcome back,” Steve said. He gave Tony’s lips a kiss. But Tony barely kissed him back.
“We’ll be back by 9. And try not to burn the house down.” Steve smirked. Kayla was laughing while Linda gave a light-hearted scowl.
To everyone who stayed till the end to finish this story, thank you so much. Thank you so much for reading my work and leaving a feedback and kudos, I truly appreciate it a lot.
“Rest of you except Sam, to the bank, now!” Steve managed to say. He let out a groan and got up.
“I’m trying Nat.” Even while fighting back the tears, Tony let out a small smile. Natasha ruffled his hair. She didn’t care if the others were looking or not. She gave Tony a hug. She didn’t let go for a while. Tony hugged her back. He was just glad someone knew how he was feeling.
“Get ready, Avengers,” Steve firmly said. Tony managed to look at Steve. He let out a shudder when he saw the look of determination with a mixture of anger written across his face. He pressed his face into Steve’s chest, and felt Steve’s arm curling around him in a protective manner.
“He definitely protected the first stone,” Wanda spoke up. “We need to get past his defenses.”
“You know,” Tony started, his voice coarse because of all the shouts and screams. “This is the best sex I ever had.”
Just then, both of them heard the distinct roar of the Hulk. Clint jumped away, and ran towards Tony just in time, and the Hulk crashed onto the communal level, from one level down. The flooring gave way even further, creating a huge mess.
“But the portal is still open and it’s weak!” Jessica said.
He grabbed his bolster and pulled the blanket to cover him. He could literally smell Steve on the bed. And he sighed in content and smiled slightly while falling asleep.
“For what?” she asked softly. She knew the answer but wanted him to say it.
It wasn’t everyday a smart man like Reed Richards became this confused over an issue. Well, today was one of those days.
“That was all you heard?!” Clint raised his voice.
Thor nodded at the girls and kissed Chippy’s head. He walked to the quinjet, briskly.
I will try my best to update this story and my other stories as best as I can! Thank you for your patience, guys!! I love you all! <3
“No…” Natasha replied, again. But a cheeky smile formed on her face this time. “I did see a picture of you, your younger self holding your first circuit board…”
“Tony just try to understand where I am coming from-“
“No wait don’t distract me using your seductiveness,” Tony rolled his eyes. Steve snorted. “Steve, what happened to the communal level?!”
“Bible project? Connect me to Reed,” Tony said as he sat on his chair. He took Butterfingers’ smoothie and tasted it. He grimaced. “What did you add in this?”
Just then, Kayla came running down the stairs.
Thor then went on to soften the stone.
a disappointment, at least, to me. I told you, I will be here. You’re not alone, Tony. Come here.”
Also, he felt like he needed to throw up.
“Steve, I’m trying so hard not to swear,” Linda lamented.
His mother smiled at him, all the worry melting away from her facial features. She walked away to the kitchen while Tony reluctantly took the stairs up to his dad’s office.
“So, that’s how it’s gonna be, huh?” Clint asked her from the kitchen.
And Tony loved every second of it.
They slowly walked back to the main area, where Steve was preparing to give a small debrief.
“Look Tony,” Steve said softly. “I’m always here for you.”
“Try to go around the area. There’s no way they escaped,” Reed suggested.
The Frost Giant was gasping for air now. Tony sighed, before throwing him two full meters away from where he was standing. He turned back and helped Thor up. And Thor couldn’t stop looking at Tony’s blue irises. He got reminded of the younger version of Tony attempting to lift the hammer.
The rest of them were gathered at the swimming pool, which was located at the roof top. Steve was sitting at the edge, and was shaking his legs in the water. Natasha, Thor and Clint were swimming in the pool, splashing water on to one another. Bruce was sitting on a lounge chair right beside the pool, and was sipping on lemonade while watching his friends play.
“Instead of facing this and talking to Steve, I ran away like a coward,” he continued. “And today, instead of trying again, I decided to come here and do the job Pepper is more than capable to do.” He sat back on the couch. “I don’t know how to face Steve. And I sure as hell don’t know how to tell Steve he and I can never be.”
“Steve,” Tony said. “That part of your life is over. It’s done. And sometimes it’s okay for the past to come creeping back up, it happens to everyone. But you’re stronger than this Steve. You gotta pick yourself up and go on with life. Also, why didn’t you tell us about you and the relationship you have with cold?”
Century’s asset!”
“Sounds good,” Tony said. “You guys choose the film. I’ll be back.” He turned to Steve for help.
“Hey uh, if it’s not going to hurt your ego or anything, can you drop me in New York?” Scott asked. “I’d like to go back to my daughter first.” Natasha glared at Scott while Steve immediately started to look at his palms.
“What?!” Clint’s eyes widened. He took his phone out and checked himself using the front camera.
Tony was simply looking at his boyfriend while feeling himself getting filled up. He let out a few soft moans. When the tip of Steve’s cock hit his sweet spot, Tony let out another scream. Steve began to rock back and forth, making sure Tony was settled in first.
“Bruce, we are still here. No one has come claiming for the stone. Even if they do, they won’t get the chance to even touch it. Do you know why?” she asked him.
“I don’t think so…” Steve sighed. “Anyway, I just got a text from Thor saying he’s not in any of the toilets. I wonder if he left…”
Tony slowly woke up from his bed. He looked around his room, and registered the sunlight hitting his face. He also realized he was naked on the bed, and alone. He had dried come all over his stomach and he grimaced at that. He sat down at the edge of the bed, and his ass immediately started to hurt. He lied back down, wondering why his ass was hurting; and it also felt sore.
“Oh, the Captain America and Iron Man plushies which Tony adored!” Linda laughed. Rhodey snorted at that, while Tony squeezed his eyes shut. “The other baby bear doll, which is chocolate brown, was the one Bucky loved. Wanda, your favorite blanket and Brucey, your animal toys.”
“Arghhh,” Rhodey grunted. He adjusted himself so that he was now seated properly on the floor. “I’m okay, I’m okay.” He panted.
Little Peter slowly placed his palm on Tony’s forehead. He wiped away the mixture of blood and sweat from Tony’s temple, which was rolling down. He brought his palm down and traced his goatee, before placing it on his cheek. Tony tilted his head and rested it on Peter’s tiny palm. He let out a contented sigh. Peter took his other hand and placed it on the other cheek. He was looking at Tony’s goatee, in astonishment.
Steve got back to making his French toasts while Natasha prepared to fry some bacon strips.
He stopped the flamethrowers and flew behind Doctor Strange’s shield.
“We beg to differ,” Steve firmly said. He stood up and readied his shield.
Bruce sighed at what he heard. He hated it when someone behaved like how Natasha’s “cousin” did.
They are reaching USA.
Tony and Steve were already more than halfway into their journey. Tony couldn’t help but wonder what the heck caused Steve to feel this much of cold despite it being summer. Steve didn’t look happy in the water and when he was pushing Clint and Thor into the sea, it didn’t look like he was getting a playful revenge, but more of trying to get himself away from them and the ocean itself.
Within fifteen minutes, Tony had gathered at their penthouse with the team. All of them were sitting down on the couch, facing one another.
“Tony, be a good boy and pass me the TV remote,” Clint cajoled.
Thor answered almost immediately, “Yes friend Clint, I do!”
Howard smiled. “You kids are really smart. Anyway, I didn’t do a thing to him,” he replied.
Before anyone could open their mouths to argue, their legs started to move.
In front of him was an empty field. Behind him were houses. He decided to go to one of them. He ran towards the house which had a suspended light bulb for a porch light, switched on.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat. He looked at the side view mirror, in case the car had flown off the cliff. But there would have been a sound and they would have known.
The Avengers helped with the cleanup in Brooklyn Bridge Park, with Tony helping the half destroyed eatery get back to business.
Tony traced Steve’s cheek with his palm. He slowly closed his eyes and his hand dropped. The others gathered around let out gasps. Steve quickly held onto Tony’s hand before it dropped fully.
Tony turned to face Bruce, who was busy keying in something in his computer. And then he remembered something. “Doktor Banner! I have a question!”
Clint also loves throwing rings onto cones. He only missed once, and that was when Bucky accidentally bumped into him when Natasha pushed him.
“Pay attention to your classmates, respect the person who is speaking in front of you,” he said. “Okay, who wants to be the first person?”
“The rest of us, behind Wanda, Sue and Doctor Strange now!” Steve ordered. “Natasha, a lullaby, please.”
“So I came here to tell you that.” Natasha stood up. “Get ready. We’re all going to the medical unit now.”
“I don’t want to mess this place with a food fight,” Clint said. “But I want that last one!”
Happy reading! :)
“But that happened at 177 Bleecker street,” Aunt May frowned. “What were you doing there?”
a dangerous Clint.
“Oh, it’s you,” Howard Stark said. He was holding a pen on one hand and a glass of whiskey on the other. He was seated on his table, wearing a suit.
“And if I do?” Howard asked.
At this point, another one of the scientists who managed to get up despite being beaten up, tried to fire at Thor.
“There is a lab there?” Tony asked. The prospect of a lab made Tony excited. Bruce turned back at the question.
“Rematch. You and me. Now.” Clint adjusted the game systems again.
Tony found Clint firing at a Hydra soldier, perched on top of the restaurant Tony was hiding in with the little girl. He swooped in and grabbed him.
After ten minutes of ensuring they got everything, the team was running towards the empty field. The two girls, Sam and Clint were pulling their luggage and running at the same time. No one was out at that hour. Chippy was trotting behind them.
Tony ran to the small eatery that was beside the boardwalk. He slammed open the glass doors.
Steve was grinning, looking down at the attractions while speeding by. And he was able to catch sight of a few men wearing suits standing near a balloon shooting stall. He swore he saw a man looking exactly like Howard Stark. But he thought he was hallucinating, because why would Howard go to a theme park in the first place? Steve turned back, and decided to focus on the fun he was having with Tony.
“You wouldn’t like it when Bruce gets mad,” Natasha smirked at him. “But hey, I choose Grey’s Anatomy too!”
Thank you for reading so far. If you have any feedback, please feel free to leave a comment. I would love to read it! :)
“Olympic Boulevard,” Tony said. “We need to drive.”
“That’s not even half. More of like, one-quarter,” Steve pursed his lips and turned to glare fondly at Tony.
When Tony woke up, the sun was still shining brightly. He felt really disoriented, and rubbed his eyes. He sat at the edge of the bed, alone. He tried to think back, wondering why he was sleeping and where the heck Steve was.
“ETA, two minutes, sir,” Jarvis updated him.
“I don’t want to know if I’m worthy or not,” Scott shrugged.
“Bruce, you are such a loving soul. I hope you will be happy with Natasha. And always remember to smile, always.”
“It looks like Steve had fucked the brains out of Tony,” Bruce said.
Tony, who was so close, needed the friction for his cock. He wanted to pry away Steve’s hands and get down to business. He attempted, and felt Steve’s hard grip not letting him go. He sighed and watched his boyfriend come down from his high. Steve wasn’t one to neglect Tony. He kept rocking his hips, and made sure Tony’s sweet spot was getting the hits.
Steve gave Tony’s neck a kiss before resting his head on his shoulder. Both of them slowly swayed side to side together. Tears welled up in Tony’s eyes, but he was trying to blink them away. He didn’t really want his friends to know how badly he could get hurt at home. But it looked like he didn’t have a choice.
“He didn’t and you don’t have to worry about him,” Steve said.
“Jarvis, remind me to label things better,” Tony sighed.
The Doctor was ruffling Tony’s hair to make him stop crying. He checked the cheek, which was very red. There was no blood and there was nothing serious. Clint was holding Tony. Just then, Doctor Strange’s red cloak lifted up by itself. It swung around and gave the Frost Giant a strong blow, making Doctor Strange levitate for a few seconds. It knocked the wind out of the Giant as he flew and fell near the basement door.
She started laughing, which irritated Steve.
They both turned to look at Vision. “I will not say anything unless I am absolutely forced to.”
“Clint… we’re in public place and can you please don’t say that out loud?” Tony told him quietly. Clint sobered up, understanding where Tony was coming from.
“Come on,” Tony said through gritted teeth. His repulsor blasts did slow them down slightly, because of the heat. “Heat affects them! We need fire power. F.R.I.D.A.Y, tell me Sam is already near New York!”
“Right, slowly,” Sam said as he was helping Rhodey walk. “It’s helping.”
“Good job leading both teams so far, Tony,” Steve said. “But we need to mix them together and, create a third team.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, where is the stone?” Tony asked. He was still circling around, with Ant Man seated on his armor.
“Oh, so I’ve been a bad boy all along?” he smirked at Steve, who rolled his eyes. “You do know that I had called for you, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“See you all later,” Tony waved at them and walked away.
“Tasha!” Clint exclaimed. “I didn’t expect that from you!”
Happy reading! :)
Both of them decided to prepare themselves for the workload and meetings, with Tony feeling excited about not having to think about Steve at all.
“I feel sexual tension in here…” Johnny whispered to Ben in a sing-song tone.
Thank you for your support so far everyone!
“Strucker,” Steve growled, glaring at the Helicarrier.
Tony gritted his teeth. He didn’t want to get reminded of that day; that day he saw his work being uncredited and that day he threw his tools across the hostel room.
“But he could have deleted all of them?” Thor asked, leaning back against the headboard. “Depends on how friend Tony dealt with him getting caught.”
The automatic doors slid open and the six of them came outside. Bruce smiled as he breathed in the LA scent. Clint and Natasha were smiling. Thor and Steve were looking around, taking in the scene of people boarding and exiting the cabs.
“I guess we’ll find out!” Tony said excitedly and ran to his car.
“Yes, I am.” a reply came.
“Right,” Steve took a step closer. “Maybe I should finish the kiss first?”
“It’ll be alright.” Tony sighed. He then went back to return the trolleys.
Even if it was from Steve.
he drove from New York. He placed his suit on the seat beside the driver’s seat.
Steve was checking on Natasha. He was rubbing Natasha’s forehead while kneeling in front of her. She had hit the table very lightly when the Frost Giant pushed her down.
“We’ll let Damage Control see to that,” Clint tried to pacify him.
For a split second, Tony wanted to tell him everything, about the bad experience he and his mum had. He just wanted to pour it all out to Steve, cry his heart out. But at the same time, he didn’t want to burden Steve with his problems.
“Let’s hear what kind of a Cap fanboy Tony was,” Clint said cheerfully.
“Hey Tony,” Jane said, her voice sounding coarse. She forced out a smile while wiping her tears away. “What brings you here?”
“They got along didn’t they?” Natasha wondered. She was so worried that they might not get along. But now, things looked slightly different.
“Tony, be a good boy and wait for your wheelchair,” Steve said with a firm tone.
“Thanks man!” Clint panted. Daredevil gave him a pat on the back before continuing his run.
Steve clearing his throat and shifting around while watching Tony move around in that tank top covered in grease had not gone unnoticed by Tony.
“Yes. I have feelings for you, Steve, have had for a long time. I just never told you because I was scared of rejection, especially from you. I mean I can deal with it,” he shrugged, before vomiting into the sick bag again. After wiping his mouth he continued. “Okay, I might not deal with it well, but with time you never know...”
“That’s not in my hands,” Tony shrugged. “Maybe it’s written in my face, to hurt me.” Tony let out a soulless laugh.
Bruce was looking at her. He raised one of his eyebrows, indicating that he wanted to know the answer.
Strucker and his entire team of Hydra loyalists were locked away in The Vault. Tony had tweaked the Avengers’ Communicards so that Nick Fury wouldn’t be able to track them easily, much to the displeasure of him.
“You’re not a disappointment, Tony,” Steve said.
“Ah, our guests,” the guard smiled. “Welcome to the Malibu Mansion.”
“I don’t think lunch is why you both traveled all the way to Long Island,” Tony shrugged knowingly.
Steve’s cheeks went rosy but he frowned. Well, he already had feelings for another man...
“We will.” Natasha and the king shook hands. She then walked into the jet. T’Challa walked back to his lab.
“You’re smart,” Scott smiled at Tony. “Your dad, Mr. Stark, doesn’t know anything about you!
Steve’s slams were getting harder, and each time Tony felt his sweet spot being activated, he let out loud moans. Their bedframe began hitting the wall, hard.
Tony got his answer before he could ask what it was. Steve hoisted him up, bridal style, and placed him on the wheelchair.
Hi guys! I'm finally updating this story, which is one of my favorite ones to write btw! This AU is so fun and I honestly cannot wait to share it with you guys!
“I’m okay,” Tony looked up at him with an amused look.
“They’re not here,” he frowned. And then panic took over. “Where did they go?!”
Spidey was swinging around the street to land at a safer place.
“I know,” a guilty looking Clint agreed. “I remember doing that out of curiosity. But I didn’t know Nat and Bucky would change.”
“Welcome to the real world, son,” Howard smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Some things had to be done.”
“Trust me Captain,” Thor replied confidently. “Tony is a smart boy.”
To all of you reading this story and waiting for the updates, thank you so much! Happy Reading! :D
Within an hour, Tony was landing at his Long Island facility in his Iron Man suit.
Thor tossed the soft remnants onto the portal and called down lightning. Vision fired his energy beam into the portal, with Johnny shooting fire straight in. Tony fired up his unibeam.
“I’m fine,” Tony said. He kept pressing for the elevator, before slipping into his jeans.
Happy reading, guys! :D
“Do you work out?” Bucky asked Natasha.
“Cap, you need backup,” Wanda stepped forward.
“I am always ready, Nat.” Tony smirked. She was slightly glad that Tony was back to his normal self.
“I placed him right beside Dr. Richards,” he answered.
“Mr. Stark?” T’Challa’s voice was loud and clear. “We are coming down.”
Steve brought Bucky to the chair near the cake. Tony was on it too. He gave baby Bucky a small piece of cake. Bucky brought it close to Tony. He slowly fed him. Tony had a small piece too. He too fed Bucky. Bucky reached out across the table for more cake. But he could only use his right hand and that hand was busy going for the cake. So, Bucky lost his balance. Baby Tony saw this. He immediately grabbed Bucky, which caused him to lose balance too. He nearly fell backwards from the chair. But Steve was there, like a guardian angel; he was holding both of them, protecting them. Tony was hugging Bucky, and Steve was hugging both of them. His eyes were glossy. And so was Kayla’s.
In this AU, these two characters play a really important part in Tony's life!
“I’ll uh… work on this,” Bruce nodded his head. He then turned to Tony and whispered, “Thank you so much Tony.”
“Guys, I’ll be back. Just gonna say a hi to my dad,” Tony smiled at them.
“Hey,” Steve said softly. “It’s alright.”
“I agree!” Thor piped up enthusiastically.
Steve was beyond horrified to fine the army now shooting tiny ice at the team; like bullets from a machine gun. Iron Man was standing in front of Natasha, firing repulsor blasts at the ice. “
“Not to worry,” Vision held her hand. “We’ll be more united then.” Wanda was looking into his eyes. She smiled a sad smile and gave his hand a squeeze.
“There is no more time. You need to go, Banner. Come I will bring you to Heimdall!” Thor exclaimed as another ground shaking explosion was heard.
Comments are welcomed:) If you've got any feedback, please feel free to share it.
Steve felt like he had seen enough. His teammates were strong, yes. They didn’t cry in front of him even if the worst happened. But they were now at their most vulnerable state, and Steve felt that it was his duty to protect them, his good friends. Rage ran through his nerves the more he heard Wanda cry. He was even more furious looking at Kayla struggling to breathe. Anger was literally blinding his eyes; they were red with rage.
“What?” Sam interrupted.
Apparently 4-year-old Tony Stark was kidnapped and everyone in the house were worried. He tried to tell them that he was actually there, but realized they couldn’t see him. Only he could see them. So he wandered around his house, walking behind Jarvis who was crying. Ana did her best to console him but it wasn’t working.
“Good night Steve,” Tony replied. He gave his forehead a massage as he waited to reach his level.
“Can someone send that two rows of Giants back where they came from?” Black Widow requested.
And so all of them enjoyed their one night together. The next day, Thor might be going back to Asgard to seek answers, Steve and some others might go back to Wakanda, along with T’Challa, Natasha might have to leave the Tower. And Tony and Rhodey would have to talk to General Ross. It was going to be the dull days for Tony. But Bruce was joining him in the Tower, so, it should be slightly alright.
A snort came from the kitchen. It was Clint. Steve was trying not to laugh.
He ran in a zig-zag manner, making it hard for the man to shoot him. Tony threw the Iron Man teddy bear at his face, and tripped and fell onto the floor. He was only two meters away from the stairway door.
Tony sighed and lied down, placing a now sobbing Peter on his chest. “Hey, hey Peter, you alright?”
“Hey,” Clint piped up after eating the last piece of strawberry. “Jarvis suggested we use the pool.”
“We all make mistakes. It’s correcting them that makes us even more human,” Natasha smiled.
Near the television set, Linda was carrying Bruce and hugging Natasha and Clint. She was crying too, and the babies were all sobbing.
Tony was talking about driving to this place where they sold fresh strawberries when they were having breakfast. He said his family had a couple of cars and they could take two for their rides. He also said he knew this extremely affordable yet delicious burger place that was near the beach. That was where they were going to have lunch later.
“Is it going to be embarrassing?” Natasha asked.
The little boy’s lips were shaking. Tears fell out of his big brown eyes. He was looking at the floor, at the pieces of jigsaw puzzle. Steve crouched down. He lifted Tony’s chin up and smiled at him. He used his thumb to wipe away his tears. Tony was staring at him, with a pout.
“You were a cute and smart boy,” Scott said. He was panting while running.
Kayla was still fighting, but had slowed down. Baby Wanda was now whimpering in pain. She was kicking the air, trying to kick her assailant.
Hi guys!
“He’s still in your team. And we all know you care for him and he cares for you but it’s an unspoken thing. Also, everyone knows about your little crush on him…” Wanda smiled a little.
If there was any dirt to dig up, the main Stark server in the company should help. Tony was also bringing his clean energy idea to upload in the server, to seem inconspicuous.
Bruce was laughing. He had never seen his fellow science bro this excited around kids before. Steve and Wanda were smiling at the softer side Tony was showing. Wanda only wished she hadn’t judged him badly before.
“Tony, you’re a little weak,” Steve held him. “Let’s sit down and continue.”
“Ben, why?!” Reed threw his hands in the air.
“Hey, if you two are done debating on who is being the better lover here, can we have some help?” Natasha asked as she broke a Hydra soldier’s arm. Beside her, Thor used his hammer to literally fling away the soldiers to the River.
“The Fantastic Four,” Steve greeted.
Reed brought the three of them back and threw them into the portal. “Gosh their frostbite is bad!” he grimaced.
“The armies are becoming difficult to push back, especially because they’re too big. The stones are still out there. Thor and I need to find them so that he can destroy them,” Tony replied.
“I hope all of you have picked out your best clothes for tonight,” Tony announced.
Tony went up to the desktop and logged in. He opened up the main server to drop his file, so that if he got caught he could just say he wanted to drop an idea.
That was enough for Rhodey. He slowly stood up, took the tablet and hurled it toward the wall on the left, where nobody was standing. Sam ducked his head in panic and the others stopped talking altogether. They all saw the tablet fly across the room. It shattered upon impact, cutting Ross’ incoming call entirely. Bucky and Wanda flinched at the sound, while the pieces landed on the floor. For a moment, the penthouse became too quiet.
“We should check on the others,” she said softly.
“Okay, let’s get to today’s activity. Share with me a story about yourself. Get the feelings out, people, today we’re all gonna board the feels train!” Professor Williams clapped his hands together in excitement.
“And the teddy bear collection,” Natasha added. She whispered to Tony before getting up, caressing his cheek, “Look, you don’t have to wallow in your own sadness alone. We’re all here for you. You can always talk to us, Tony. We really love you.”
“Hello.” Thor smiled.
So, Thor and Tony decided to start with the warm up again. Steve was just sitting there looking rigid, and was holding back his laughter. Clint was also doing the same because of how constipated Steve’s face looked.
Steve tipped the shovel, so the stone dropped into the little hole they dug for it. The stone dropped. Linda and Steve braced themselves for anything that could happen. But nothing changed. Both of them were still there. Steve let out a sigh of relief.
Bucky gasped. He immediately turned to Tony. He brought the little boy’s cheek closer to him and kissed him. Steve raised his eyebrows, but was laughing.
“I saw you two smooching the other day, when the shooting star flew past,” Jarvis replied.
“No she won’t,” Tony assured him. “Let me talk to her.”
Tony set the paper on the coffee table. When he walked past Steve, he gave him a wink. Steve didn’t expect to see a blush crawl up Tony, but damn, it was the cutest thing Steve saw.
“So we have a girls’ room then,” Tony was smiling cheekily. He earned a scowl from Natasha.
For now, happy reading! :)
” the reporter and the cameraman were on the sidewalks.
“One day,” Steve started, with his teeth gritted. “Your dad’s gonna get it from me.”
Before Tony could ask what it was, Steve was kissing him. Tony immediately felt Steve’s nervousness when their lips crashed together. He kissed him back, to assure him that he wanted this too. Whatever emotions they had for each other and were hiding from one another were poured out into that one kiss.
“Yeah but…” Tony paused, realizing something. “Jarv, you know about us?”
“Yes please. I wanna fire at those wannabe Hydra soldiers,” Clint laughed.
The four of them sitting on the bench looked up. The sky was a mixture of cobalt blue and midnight blue, and the millions of stars scattered across it looked like fairy dust. The orange glow from the sun set was slowly fading away. And a white streak of light was flying past them and was headed into the horizon.
Steve and the others started to walk up the stairs.
“I guess. I mean, he’s not that badly injured is he?”
“The stone, genius,” Natasha quipped.
“Aye aye Captain!” Tony grinned.
“I agree!” Clint grinned. “And their crème brûlée was just… on top of this world!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony tossed his phone on the bed. He sighed, looking at the New York skyline, where the buildings were all lit up for the night.
Steve had his shield perched on his back, hidden by his cardigan, while Hawkeye’s quiver was with Sam. Clint had his arm swung around Natasha’s shoulder, walking as if they were a couple. Steve however, was only walking close to Wanda and wasn’t holding her hand. He was thinking about the mission more than acting casually. In fact, acting casually was the least of his concerns.
“Don’t even think of blaming yourself for whatever that happened,” Steve said, the sincerity glowing in his eyes.
After realizing the quiet moment was gone, she removed her hand from his head, but didn’t stand up. “I got a call from Clint. Tony woke up just a few minutes ago.”
“Get ready Tony!” Natasha sighed. She was smiling.
Tony’s eyes widened to a whole new level. Top in his entire cohort?! Damn. This was what he wanted to hear, especially thinking about how badly he would be doing for his theater module.
Tony’s eyes widened at that information. “I thought the other one was in another dimension?”
After a few more minutes, Tony softly muttered, “Love you Steve.”
“Thank you for being my reason to live,” Tony smiled.
“I’ll show you acting,” Tony said firmly after swallowing. Steve raised his eyebrows, and then nodded his head with a smirk.
“Come on Tony it’s gonna be fun!” Clint threw his arms into the air.
“Alright Avengers, time to melt some Frost Giants!” Tony said enthusiastically.
“Oh Chippy,” Bucky sighed sadly. He ruffled his fur one last time before walking away to the quinjet.
But Tony didn’t want to make the move. He already knew the sparks moving towards him meant that he could lift the hammer. But deep down, he felt as if it was wrong. This was Thor’s hammer, his weapon. Tony had his own weapon. There was no reason for him to touch the hammer, unless he really had to. The whole idea behind Mjolnir felt pure and holy, and Tony didn’t want to mess it all up.
“Oh Tony,” Jane blushed. “You know how to get the girls.”
Hi guys! I hope you all are doing alright. Here's the next chapter for one of the most exciting stories I've ever written.
But Tony gave up the attempt. He let go of the handle and went back to sit on the rock. The blue in his irises vanished.
“Sorry,” Kayla let out a sob. “I was shaken because he was so scary.”
Hey everyone. I hope February is alright so far!
“How? We’re both hiding here from them,” she pointed at the Helicarrier.
Tony was playing with his new toy car. Clint had joined him this time. They made the car sounds while crawling quickly to the “finish line”, which was the line at the end of the carpet. Bucky, Natasha and Wanda were playing with their rattles. Occasionally Natasha tried to push away Bucky’s toy. But Steve intervened and broke off their little brawl. Bruce loved his animal toys. He allowed all of them to play with the toys, which the kids did.
In the middle room, Steve was checking on Tony. Their clothes were still squashed in their luggage bags.
But he came from there and they weren’t there. Tony… Gosh where does he love to go? He’s always at the living room with his toys. There was once he messed around with the small box of tools placed in the kitchen. They weren’t in the kitchen either. So… Wait a second. There were more tools at the attic!
More baby cots had arrived in the house. There were more baby clothes, food, toys and other necessary items. The girls didn’t mind spending some money for this.
Tony's worst nightmare resurfaces back in his life.
He let out a gasp, and looked down. He saw his bow and a few shattered glass pieces already plunging towards the street. Also, he heard a little boy screaming. He raised his arm, instincts telling him to catch whatever that was incoming. But Tony flew out too fast, and was already falling 90 floors down. Clint’s eyes widened in alarm.
“Me too,” Wanda turned to Tony. “I owe you an apology. I’ll be glad to work together with all of us, again.”
“Where is he?” Steve asked, panic filling his voice. “Where are they?”
Everything was dark there, and Tony saw the time. It was 3.30 in the morning.
The teams on both sides were doing all they could. No one really spoke anything. They were trying not to let the Frost Giants get past them. The Avengers were on one side and the Defenders were on the other. Steve’s instinct immediately saw what was wrong. He also wasn’t prepared to look at one of the Frost Giants shooting sharp edged ice at his teammates. Wanda could only create so many shields at a certain speed, especially when the Giants were aiming high and low at the same time. The ice weapon hit Natasha’s abdomen area, sending her crashing onto the road.
Daredevil suddenly straightened. “I hear electric sparks.” He said.
The journey back to New York via the quinjet would only take less than 5 minutes as Tony was flying it in high speed. Steve was trying to come up with a battle plan. He knew they needed to split the team into two so that they could fight at either ends of the street. It was such a weird looking portal, opened on the ground and the Frost Giants entering from the side.
“Aw come on…” Clint rolled his eyes. He slowly climbed in, having to squeeze inside. Thor immediately grabbed Clint, and pulled him towards him, as if he were hugging him. “Such affection.” Clint smiled. After the doors were shut and locked, Tony sped along the bends, easily. He then exited the gate, waving at the security guards, who waved back at him.
“Aw Thor,” Clint sighed in annoyance. “Quit giving us scares, pal!”
He drove around a statue and stopped the car right outside the main entrance of the mansion.
Doctor Strange leaves and Sam arrives at Boston, much to Steve's relieve.
Tony turned back to look at the leader.
“I think I lost my patience,” Clint gritted his teeth. He was just about to leave the kitchen when Tony grabbed his arm.
“Let me see,” Steve requested eagerly.
“Especially Tony,” Rhodey turned to look up at the ceiling.
“You know a lot of things,” Tony grinned. He stretched out his little arms to her, prompting Steve to pass him to her. She happily carried him and settled him on her hip. Tony smiled at her, eyes shining, and said, “So, tell me more about where I am and who you all are.”
tired.
Obadiah was examining it intently. “When did you come up with this?”
Later, Tony goes away somewhere, goes missing, and his friends plus Steve try to get him back.
It’s 6 in the evening. The sky was a beautiful orange with patches of pink appearing here and there.
“We’re not done yet.” Howard stood up. He placed his pen and glass of whiskey on the table gently.
Now it was Clint.
“I’ll see you guys later again,” Bruce said and rushed towards the door leading to the basement. Natasha was staring at him, wide-eyed.
“You alright?” he asked Tony. “You got some injuries, but they’re pretty minor.”
“Then, we shall only use this level, and one floor down for the game!” Thor suggested enthusiastically.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, how is our fuel capacity doing?” Tony questioned the AI. He was writing something down furiously.
Thank you for all your support! I'll be updating this regularly because my term break is here. Comments are welcomed here, so feel free to drop one! Happy reading!
With that, she stormed out of the classroom. Professor Williams was giving his forehead a massage, sighing a deep sigh.
Steve sighed a long sigh that made even Tony felt bad for him. “It’s okay. This is something that always happens and you’ve apologized multiple times so it’s fine.”
Everyone slowly got up. They were back to square one, using their weapons to its maximum capacities. Thor groaned in frustration.
He gently brought down Scott, who wasn’t expecting Tony to do any of what he was doing.
Natasha was seated on the floor with Bruce, while Clint braided her hair in the name of taking a break. Natasha looked up at Clint and sent him a flying kiss as a thank you. He pretended to have caught it and placed it at his heart. Both Clint and Natasha burst out laughing at their actions, and Clint joined Natasha on the floor, pulling her closer to him. She rested her head on his chest and closed her eyes, feeling a calm settle within her.
Both of them quickly breezed by the penthouse and made their way to the elevator. Not many of them gathered there saw this. But only Natasha did and it took her less than ten seconds to figure out who the boy was and what he and Steve were up to.
“My dad and Linda’s dad were fitness enthusiasts,” Kayla commented. “No one really uses them now. But I clean them in case mum decides to donate them some day.”
“Why do I feel like you’re mocking me with that question?”
“What?” Both Bucky and Steve asked in unison. They’ve had a lot of nicknames for each other, Barney was never one of them.
“Tony,” Howard gritted his teeth. “If I were you, I’d watch your words. Listen to me. I don’t have a good feeling about Stark Industries’ future. You’re the only that can turn this around. You should understand why I’m telling you not to fully trust Obi. He has connections everywhere, son. He even has connections with Roxxon Corporation, our rival company!”
“You’re lying,” Steve said. Tony sighed; sometimes he’s the worst liar to ever exist.
Bruce did not want to turn green. He just wanted to get out of there. Thor told him to exit Asgard. But before he ran to the Bifrost, he went past the sacred garden. He remembered Thor telling him about the stones and where the other half was hidden. He went into the sacred garden. It was buried near a small pond. Bruce dug it out. He decided to take it with him so that the Frost Giants will not be so powerful. He saw a tiny crack on the stone but that didn't change his mind.
“Hey, this is my friend Thor. Don’t be scared. Just say hi,” Tony said. Peter slowly walked and stood in front of Thor, who grinned at him.
“Clint!” Linda practically screamed when the baby boy tripped and fell on the entire collection of Bruce’s animal toys. His giggling stopped.
Natasha wanted to disagree. But she also wanted to know what Bruce had to say, even after disconnecting the line from the quinjet that day. She was interested, so after a few minutes of thinking, she eventually agreed.
“Sure thing, Boss. Good night,” Friday said softly. She dimmed his room lights and made sure he felt comfortable in the room.
“There will be a group project,” Professor Simon Williams started to explain to Tony’s theater class. “Groups of four. You will get a chance to perform it in the University’s Black Box. A skit that needs to last for fifteen minutes.”
“See, Wanda senses it!” Linda laughed. Wanda was about to disagree but Kayla spoke up first.
“Boss, the amount of force emitted by that closed portal was beyond the
“Wothy!” She grinned at him.
Bruce and Thor joined them after taking a good afternoon nap. Thor got really excited when he saw what both Clint and Natasha were doing. Natasha was kind enough to let Thor have a chance to challenge Clint. She was waiting for the remote but gave up after 10 minutes.
They were all driving in silence, just enjoying the wind and their company.
He increased his speed, thrusting forward fully. He fired a repulsor blast first before crashing into the Quinjet. The tail section of the jet fell apart, plunging towards the East River. Strucker screamed as the nose section now dived down.
“I will, sweetheart,” Natasha assured him. She settled in beside him, brushing back his soft hair. Tony fell asleep fast. And once Natasha was sure Tony will be fine, she closed his room door.
They exchanged greetings.
“Yes, but at least inform us earlier!!” Steve raised his voice.
“Clint…” Natasha sighed.
And all of a sudden, Clint burst out laughing. “That’s a good joke!”
Bucky was already shooting down some of the Giants. But the bullets did little damage to them. Clint’s arrows also did little damage. Natasha was getting frustrated because they weren’t making any progress. The Defenders were simply trying their best.
The Frost Giant grinned. “I will.”
“Yes, I have taught you well,” Tony laughed.
“And Captain Rogers is always the victim of them,” Friday added cheekily.
“It’s an irony that you’re talking about living a lie, considering you vomit each time you do,” Steve chuckled.
“I’m pairing up with Natasha for the dance competition. And also, there’s an archery competition coming up. Man, I’m gonna be so busy.” Clint stretched.
Before he could talk to either of them, his phone vibrated on his pocket. He pulled it out and rolled his eyes at the name of the person calling him.
“You’re worried.” Tony pointed at Bruce. He walked away from the lab table. “Is it the tiny cracks?”
“Uh Reed, I think you should pull back the controls,” Sue told him. “Reed?”
Tony used the light from his gauntlet to navigate his path. He tripped on something, but continued walking. He then stopped in front of a stair like area. He shone the light on it and was beyond aghast to find Steve’s lifeless body. He couldn’t breathe properly when he saw Steve and his broken shield. He reluctantly moved the light upwards and saw the rest of his teammates, dead.
After a while, Tony was coming down the stairs, fast. “Can anyone explain to us why we were naked?”
Rhodey sighed in absolute frustration. “General, Tony and I have spoken about this to you several times. The Avengers who went into hiding are allowed back if there are big threats, like the one they just faced.”
Linda pulled Sam’s luggage in and shut the door.
“I think from the contents in this sick bag you should know that they weren’t random answers.”
What a stupid way to ask Tony about his feelings? Why did he have to do it this way? All these questions kept popping up in his head and he needed to so desperately tune them out.
“You alright?” Tony asked, leaning against the wall and watching Clint.
Tony scratched his head and looked slightly uncomfortable. “Uh, no Thor. I’m more of the shallow water type of guy.”
“I always thought it was hanging over!” Thor looked surprised. “Back at home, I have been telling my brother Loki just that… No wonder he laughs…”
Natasha nodded. “They are our responsibility.”
It was 10am, and the gang had decided to drive down to the Walk of Fame, to firstly, take a wefie and secondly, to look at some of the stars.
The class spent the next half an hour preparing a speech to present. Professor Williams was walking around, giving out presentation tips. Tony made sure he listened to the tips as some of them were really good. He couldn’t wait to use them for future presentations in his other classes. Carson and Tony decided to practice with each other. From the corner of his eye, Tony spotted Bethany reluctantly pairing up with Whitney to practice.
“Yeah you fell down man,” Clint spoke. He was examining his palm.
The back door slowly shut. “We’re all set to go Tony.” Natasha said.
Within minutes, they were halfway into their dinner. Clint couldn’t help but take more of the carbonara, much to the glee of Ana. They were all chatting about school and about what had happened in the last semester. Of course, they didn’t go into details about Bruce being bullied by Ross, the six of them chasing his dad, senior lecturer Pierce, out of the school and all the other nonsense that happened because Ana and Jarvis would flip out. They were telling them about how tough their exams were and about their first Uno game together.
The jet slowly lifted off. Scott and Sam watched the jet fly off from the common room.
“Maybe…” Tony thought hard. It was a good question. Would Tony have ever told Steve about his feelings? Maybe yes on a good day, over hot dogs or walking through art galleries with Steve, if he was into that. But on a bad day, maybe not. After an argument, Tony knew he wouldn’t be able to handle Steve rejecting him. It was a hard question to answer either yes or no to, almost impossible.
“There is a uh… potential investor for the company I need you to meet. He was very insistent on meeting outside, at the Brooklyn Bridge Park.”
They were nearly finishing up their burgers when a crazy idea hit Clint. His face lit up and it really looked like he had a lit bulb above his head.
Of course, Tony wasn’t satisfied with her answer. But he nodded his head as he understood and respected his mother’s decision to not talk about this again. She gave him a kiss on the cheek and walked to the kitchen. Tony wiped his tears and ran up to his room. He shut the door and jumped onto the bed.
“I… I am not good with this s… sort of things,” Tony stumbled, but he continued anyways. “I uh, I want to make something.” Tony bit his tongue. He was not supposed to say
“What else can this stone do?” Clint asked. He seemed intrigued by it.
“Hey Tony, come on man. He’ll face some justice from Asgard. Listen to us, man!” Clint tried.
“What happened, babe?” Steve asked, while hugging Tony from the back. “Did something happen or were you really sleepy?”
There was a roar from the Hulk. He charged towards one of the row. Danny was standing in front of the other row. He was concentrating on summoning his Chi and on channeling it down his arm and into his hand. He did that until his hand became like a thing of iron.
Thor, who was also distracted by them, didn’t see where the shuttlecock was going. He missed it and it fell inside his court. And Clint was declared the winner.
“Oh trust me,” Tony gently nudged him. “The rooms are
Natasha shook her head. Steve was just watching them. He realized they didn’t really change that much. They had mini brawls like this when they were two. He sighed and shook his head. Linda was laughing from the kitchen.
“Yeah,” Natasha thought. “Maybe except for the part where I was thrown across the airport tarmac when tackling Clint.” She shrugged.
“Cleen no!” Tony screamed. He toddle-ran and pulled Clint. But he was not ready to dodge the incoming slap.
Steve turned back to face Tony. “Yeah and how we were last time.”
Tony sighed dramatically and plopped down onto the couch, in between Steve and Thor. They switched on the television, and The Price is Right was on air.
“Why not somewhere far away?” Tony looked around the area. “If those buffoons come, they won’t attack here.”
“You should try that again. To see if you’re worthy now,” Clint suggested.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t worry Thor,” Natasha said. “Once you’re absolutely free, you can go back to Iceland and come back to school.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay the portal is weakening,” Wanda observed.
“Everything is prepared in the Tower for your arrival, Mr. Stark,” Vision spoke up. “There are several guests already seated at the penthouse as we speak. One of them is a kid, Peter Parker, who said he has something to give you. Moreover, there are several things waiting for you there.”
“Avengers, I found a point of weakness in the cybernaut,” Steve was saying and launched himself onto it. Both of them flew onto the main road, landing on a car that was driving past. The driver slammed onto the breaks, sending Steve and the cybernaut flying across the road.
“That’s not good,” Bruce commented from behind them.
“You’re gonna walk us to the cafe?” Tony grinned.
As promised, here's the next chapter. This chapter is like where the conflict starts, so I hope you guys enjoy it!
“Pepper told me that I have a meeting with an investor, Mr. Grant.”
Tony rested his head near Steve’s chest. He was breathing heavily. He wanted to stop crying, to man up. But he didn’t or more of couldn’t. In fact, Steve’s hug was so tight that Tony doubted he could easily move away. He realized that it had been very long since someone held him this way.
Thor was laughing while shaking his head. Chippy was fast asleep beside him. The noise didn’t bother him.
At this time, baby Natasha ran towards the Giant, who had gotten up already. Linda couldn’t stop her on time. She gave him a little kick on his side. The Frost Giant simply pushed her down.
On a cool and sunny Monday morning, Clint and Natasha inadvertently ended up in the kitchen together as they both had morning classes. Tony had woken up to get a cup of coffee but when he saw the two of them standing together, he scurried right back to his room. He wanted the couple to talk it out with one another.
“Advice taken, Señor,” Tony grinned.
Mjolnir was filled with energy and life, waiting for Tony’s command. Tony’s irises had also turned blue, and he had blue sparks occasionally appearing around him. He looked at each of the AIM personnel, showing them that he wasn’t really afraid of them.
When Steve and company reached home, they immediately ran into the mansion. Jarvis smiled at them, but he realized Tony wasn’t there with them.
Happy reading! :)
“She did,” he agreed. “Give me the mug, I’ll wash them.”
“Ah, kids, I also have your
“Fuck me,” Tony growled while Jarvis slowly led him to the kitchen. The others didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know if they should enter the kitchen and check on Tony or go to level two to back Steve.
Kayla gave the picture to him. He looked at it and ran his thumb along the image. Chippy was looking up at the camera directly with his tongue hanging out. He was smiling. Bucky really missed him. He placed the photo on his chest, cradling it and sighed.
“We just wanted to be with you, Tony Stark,” Thor gave his shoulder a light squeeze.
Clint laughed. “Garage sale, probably.” He suggested.
“We’re fine,” she smiled. “We really couldn’t wait to see you. And your friends!” She walked to where Jarvis was standing.
“Tony, assemble them again. I want to see them.” Steve ruffled Tony’s soft brown hair. Tony nodded.
“It’s okay to feel the way you always feel, Clint,” Tony smiled. “Just let it out, okay? Anyways, we’re here to enjoy. So, no hard feelings against our big blondie?”
The others looked up to see grey clouds gathering around. There was lightning and thunder. To top it off, there was an extremely heavy gust of wind.
“I am fine big guy. The others are upstairs. Still asleep I guess.” Sam walked to the kitchen to make himself coffee. “Hey Kayla, get Steve please.”
“Anyway, we need to talk,” Clint said.
“Tony, they’re not there,” Steve’s voice came through.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, looking horrified. He simply kept staring at his love hurtling across the road.
“His pulse is too weak. He must be using all his willpower to stay alive,” Reed sighed. “He really needs the medics.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wanda.” Natasha placed her hand on Wanda’s shoulder. Wanda turned, face coated with tears. “Is everything alright? “
look, which humored him more than making him upset.
Thor sat down on his other side, so that Tony was sandwiched between them.
“Kayla, can you bake?” Steve asked. She nodded, still in shock. “Can you bake a cake, any cake?”
“We’re very late,” Reed Richards spoke. “We saw that you guys had it under control. But we thought you might need the assist.”
Natasha smiled at Bruce. They were just standing there, in front of the elevator doors, not knowing what move to make next. Bruce was wringing his hands together, before he stretched out an arm. He placed it on Natasha’s shoulder and pulled her closer.
Tony’s thoughts vanished at that moment. He decided to live in the present and waited to see which of his close friends were going to be the first person to scream at that jump scare.
“Just because you have closed the portals I opened, it doesn’t make you a winner,” the leader hissed at Tony.
Tony cringed. “Are those his words?”
“Try it, friend Tony!” Thor grinned. He sat back on the couch.
“We wrapped them using some towels. We need to get them clothes, food and all the necessary things.” Kayla spoke, looking very flustered. Bruce nodded. “Linda and I have babysitting experience. We can handle them.”
This sent the big, muscular man screaming in shock. He missed a footing and went rolling down the stairs. He stopped midway, just enough to get into the views of the 3 girls. The 3 of them jumped up from the couch. Natasha slammed open the master bedroom door. She had a pocket knife with her. Bruce ran out to see what happened. Clint woke up at the sound of the fall. He came out, looking sleepy. The water stopped running in the bathroom.
They went to level 2 next. They turned right from the landing and walked into a big room. It already had the spare beds spread out with blankets. It had a wooden cupboard and a small window, from which you could look at the backyard of the house and at the roofs of the other houses.
He asked the AI to wake them up in an hour. Both of them fell asleep within seconds, with Steve curling an arm around Tony’s hips.
“Patience, Tony,” Steve smirked, while increasing the speed of his strokes.
“Shit,” Tony cursed. “Scott hold on.”
Steve managed to get to the window, and saw Clint’s bow disappear down. He also saw Tony falling back first. Steve felt a lump rise in his throat, and wished he could do more to save his Tony.
“Try not to get the liquid in your face, people!” Tony said as he flew up to the Helicarrier.
“Oh, talk me through,” Tony smiled.
“Do remember to send the videos and photos of us as kids,” Wanda said excitedly.
“We need a strategy!” Natasha said angrily.
“Are you kidding me?” Steve asked. “That one eatery behind us is half destroyed.”
He leaned back against the door and started to gasp for air. He grimaced at the pain emerging on his face. His left hand covering his nose was covered in blood. He could hear someone calling his name. It was Steve. Oh no, his friends were just below. He didn’t want them to know about this.
“I can understand.” Wanda’s voice was behind them. “I can take the couch. I like it anyways.”
“Thanks for allowing us here, Colonel,” Steve smiled. “Most of them will leave after a small debrief.”
“You think you had enough?!” Howard sneered. He took a step forward and was in Tony’s personal space. Tony immediately took a step back and his back was hitting the door. He could smell the alcohol reeking from his father. “Yeah one bad experience and you had enough! Be a man, Tony. Stark men are made of iron! Don’t be a spineless prick!”
“We need Bruce for this,” Natasha sighed.
Tony smiled. “Thanks Steve. It was really constructive.”
Happy reading! :)
“Oh Tony,” Bruce chuckled as he hugged him back.
Rhodey walked towards Steve. He let go of the couch for just a second, but that was a mistake. He began to wobble and lost balance. Before Steve could catch him, he fell onto the floor on all fours.
. He jumbled up the phrases
He could hear the Avengers shouting his name and running up the stairs.
The elevator doors opened to the communal level. Tony dashed out of it to the kitchen, where most of the team members were gathered after a morning session of sparring.
Clint was sleeping with his thumb in his mouth. He always had this habit of sucking his thumb, but the adult Clint didn’t, obviously. Steve slowly pulled his thumb out. Clint didn’t wake up. Natasha was beside him. She was hugging her favorite baby bear doll. She had a very subtle smile. Steve pulled her blanket up to cover her more. Next to her was Bucky. Steve brushed his hair back, slowly. He looked really peaceful. He was clutching his blanket. Bucky stirred slightly, which made Steve withdraw his hand. But as soon as Bucky settled down, Steve resumed the motion, with a soft smile.
“Whitney?”
Tony sighed too, feeling relieved. He turned to his left and saw another figure standing close by. “Ah, Mr. Magic.” He smiled.
“You should try her baked potatoes,” Jarvis was saying to Natasha. “They’re one of the best.”
The fourth was of him looking directly into the portal where the Frost Giants were and getting dragged into it. He was screaming at his AI to do something. His other teammates were shouting his name. Tony had nothing to grab onto. To top it off, he didn't have any control over his armor. He just flew into the portal, which suddenly became absolutely dark.
“No.” Kayla sighed. “And what I have for him, it’s called admiration. I have Carl, remember?”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, I am landing this bird at the Tower. Ensure it gets proper maintenance,” Tony said.
The six of them sat there for the next hour, and finished up the box of strawberries. They then kept talking about absolutely random things, like having a spring cleaning session in their apartment. Of course, Steve knew this wouldn’t happen. With how hectic a semester could get; spring cleaning wasn’t a luxury they could afford. Plus most of them would get lazy, so it was just impossible.
“I… Can I finish?” Tony asked, he practically whispered this out. He didn’t expect either of them to react. He thought they’ll just nod their heads and leave the room. Steve then told him to finish. “So I was all alone, and I thought maybe, just maybe if I hadn’t overreacted so much, things could have ended better. I am so sorry, both of you. I, I really am. I’m trying to amend myself but, each time I try, it doesn’t seem to work. I’m a constant disappointment. I hope both of you understand, and I hope I can earn the relationships back.”
“Is that Cap?” he practically whispered.
Bucky wiped his tears hastily. Tony nodded his head at what his AI said.
“You know what, partner?” Steve spoke. “I just want to make things right. Whatever happened, I’d like to put that behind me, and hold your hand forever. Oh Tony…” Steve sighed.
“Nat, you and I?” Clint asked. She agreed to that.
He assured her. Howard then walked out of the room. Tony walked in further, and knelt down in front of his mom. He placed his head on her lap and wished she could see him.
Clint snorted at that.
“Oh yeah? In that case, I can defend him from you whenever I want,
“There really are many questions we have,” Jessica sighed. She kicked one of the Frost Giants at his crotch, sending him back.
Tony walked to him.
“You’re safe,” she kept saying it to him, like a chant. She was hugging and coaxing the little boy.
The rest of them smiled at the guard. Jarvis continued to drive in.
The video went back and they all heard the girly screams coming from Rhodey and Sam, again.
“No… no I… I need you too, Barney.” Tony slapped his forehead with his palm. This was not going smoothly.
Clint flips (or more of like attempts to) flip an omelette. Tony gets a bad news, which causes him to talk it out with Happy and Pepper.
Happy New Year to you guys! Hopefully 2017 will be a way better year!
“Not tonight,” Steve whispered into Tony’s ear, getting a full body shudder from him.
Tony then proceeded to ring the doorbell. It was the typical bell sound.
Bruce: “The sexual tension between the both of you is tearing the roof off. Go talk to him before the Hulk convinces you.”
“No, no Johnny!!” Reed shouted.
**Also, the Puddle of Truth in this story is entirely fictional. I came up with that at 12 in the morning when I was writing this.**
Clint raised an eyebrow. “Then there’s only one way to find out. Get our bag guys. The car key is there. We’ll try finding for Howard. We will go to Stark Industries if we have to.”
Steve was completely taken aback by his question. “Uh… it does feel weird at times. It feels weird to be living in this luxurious Tower, when most of my life I spent being poor. The memories I have and the memories I’m creating now are really different. I still feel…” Steve sighed.
Tony nodded his head, already wondering why he had to wear their friend’s shirt. He looked around him. The buildings were really tall, and the street was littered with debris, as if a fight had just taken place. There were several agents standing a few meters away from him, all staring at him; especially that man with an eye patch. Tony then turned to look at the person standing beside him, and his eyes widened.
“Clint, I’ll handle him. You okay with helping Fury out?”
Tony then went on to scribbling on the drawing block. He used various colors and simply made his own random design. All these he did after beating Thor in Uno.
“Trust yourself, friend Tony,” Thor said firmly. “Our gut feeling usually tells us the truth.”
“It’s good to see you too, Sue!” Tony kissed her back.
“Hey, sit back and enjoy this!” Bruce smiled. He patted on a spot on the couch, and gave Tony and Steve some space.
It was a metal arm, which looked shiny and brand new.
Tony raised both his eyebrows. He turned back to look at the photos; especially at the one with Tony and Steve. He then climbed up onto the bed, forgetting about the game he was playing with Thor, and Steve joined him.
“Alright everyone!” he clapped his hands to get the people’s attention and shouted. “Follow me, I’m going to get you all to safety, away from the nonsense!”
Happy reading! :)
After some time, they seemed to have thrashed most of the AIM scientists. Combat wasn’t the AIM guys’ forte and neither was science; that’s what Tony thought. He got ready when he saw Thor nod his head at his direction. Thor threw Mjolnir to him and he caught it. He ran across the couch and jumped up, calling down lighting. He raised the hammer mid-air and finished off the last few AIM scientists by slamming the hammer onto the floor. Even more flooring gave way, and Clint nearly fell through it.
Steve lifted his head up so that he could wipe his tears away. “I was scared to open up to all of you. So I delayed it and now I’m paying.”
Her firm grip made Steve comfortable. He relaxed. “You’re actually…” he was trying to find the right word. “Wise.”
The others were laughing at that, with Clint hitting Bruce for what he had said. Thor sat down there with a fake pout and a little blush on his cheeks, because of the mention of Jane Foster. He was also eating a sausage bun, and had smeared mustard and chili sauce on his mouth.
The Avengers finally wrapped up. They were ready to go back to the Tower, to have lunch, watch Friends or to do anything better than fighting AIM.
---EPILOGUE---
Tony narrowed his eyes at them. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, show me the camera footage of the kitchen that day.”
Steve let out a sigh. Kayla was standing with Linda near the kitchen.
This question came out of him instead, “Reed, why did Steve invite himself here?”
“I know one,” Tony suddenly said. “But you might throw up.”
“Uh Mr. Stark kindly-“
At that exact moment, Tony fell backwards from his chair. The girls had burst into hysterics while Steve was coughing. It seemed that Steve had choked on the juice while Tony made a ruckus of himself.
They all walked into the kitchen, where Ana and a few helpers were setting up the table for lunch, and Jarvis was helping Tony stop his nosebleed.
Daredevil pointed to the lamppost behind him. The rest of them ran there, forgetting how tired they felt. And Tony was there on the ground, right beside the lamppost, surrounded by debris and dust. He was still clutching onto Mjolnir.
“What the heck happened?” Clint asked. “Did he like… have a bad stomach and stay in the toilet or something?”
Later at night, Tony decided to go to the gym to check on how his new punching bags were doing. They were just shipped in from his Stark Industries lab and Friday had informed him of it.
As it was tiny, the stone was annihilated, but with devastating effects. Waves of purple shot everywhere. Two buildings on either sides of the street came crashing down. The explosion nearly knocked Doctor Strange’s shield. He kept it up with all his might. Sue, Wanda and the others fell down because of the impact.
When Natasha and Clint walked in a few minutes later, they would find both Steve and Tony sleeping soundly with each other. Their faces would look peaceful and the rising sun’s golden glow would dance on both their faces gracefully.
“If you wanted me, this is it,” Steve panted out. He slowly slid himself into Tony.
“Wow, so I got kidnapped by terrorists…” Tony thought out aloud.
“Yup,” Steve said as he scrambled to get his things.
“Will that be all, Master Stark?” he asked.
“You will be a fine man in the future, Tony,” Thor smiled. “I wish you all the best. The God of Thunder will always be there for you.” Thor hugged Tony tightly. Tony touched Mjolnir one last time. He felt the same energy coursing through him.
He walked to the end of the mini boardwalk and decided to stand against a deck railing. The view in front of him was spectacular. A yacht was docked nearby and was bobbing along with the rhythm of the East River currents. To his right, the Brooklyn Bridge stood looking mighty and tall. Tony sighed. He could feel a small bump hitting his shin, hard. He bent down to examine it.
“Thanks Thor, and guys,” Tony smiled sincerely. “But yeah, this is what we've done so far. Introducing ourselves to one another. And sounding genuine..”
By now, it was obvious that Howard Stark had made an appearance, that had turned sour. And Clint felt something snap inside him. He’s honestly had enough with Howard.
Inside, Tony was hugging the teddy bear and the polaroid photo. He looked around, feeling nervous. He would have loved to bring Cap with him. He could prove to his dad that he was worthy of the Stark mantle after all. And then they all could live happily with one another.
“Where are the clouds coming from?” Natasha asked.
“Mine is Pet… Peter,” he replied. “You were inside that… metal thing?”
“You need sleep, Tony,” Steve sighed. “You gotta rest for a while because you don’t look so well.”
“Please tell me you weren’t…” Clint made some obscene hand movements.
“Well Tony and I have been saying one thing to you ever since we started this talk about what we’re gonna do in this situation, and we’re sticking with what we said. They’re here to help us. And they can stay as long as they want in the Tower and the Accords are open to them,” Rhodey stated as a matter-of-factly. “It’s their decision. You actually don’t have any reason to start bashing anyone up
Leave a feedback if you'd like to!! <3
“Then what are we waiting for-“
But he managed to keep his cool and watched Obadiah slowly walk in. Tony’s hand quickly exited the mainframe and he opened up the server window, all while focusing his gaze on Obadiah.
“Friend Clint,” Thor cried out. “I’m sorry!”
“It’s alright,” Tony replied. There was a very light smile on his face. Sam couldn’t help but smile at that. He walked back to where the rest of them were seated.
Tony was watching that. But he closed his eyes and tilted his head to the side because he felt this sudden energy coursing through him. He suddenly felt more powerful, more alive, and importantly, more angry. He gritted his teeth and snapped his eyes open. His irises were completely blue.
Rhodey narrowed his eyes.
painful."
And lastly…
“I see you pee,” Natasha let out a chuckle.
The Battle continues and a few more people, including Tony, de-age.
Tony felt like he was on autopilot as he placed his thumb on the pad to let it scan. But then he remembered the time Clint decided to prank on Tony by letting Vision speak to Tony, as if he was an AI. Tony relaxed when he realized it might be the same prank again. If Vision was back… that meant Rhodey’s back too!! Tony was happy about this prospect. And Vision acting as Jarvis and locking him outside was the twist to it; damn Clint, you gotta get more creative.
“Or I can talk to Tony.” Rhodey shrugged.
She adjusted herself; he gave her the freedom to do so. She stopped after a while.
“Oh my God Steve,” Tony panted. “I’m about to come…”
“Banner!” Tony grinned. “We had to stop at New York. Scott and Sam wanted to get down.”
-“ the reporter was finishing up when the camera swung sideways. The cameraman cried out in pain.
“This bouquet, we’re giving it to you on behalf of the Defenders,” Luke said. He stretched out the bouquet to Tony.
The windows were just big, long glass panels, which gave a generous view of the blue sea. Clint already loved the view.
“Huh, I’m not surprised,” Tony said.
Later at night, Tony found himself practicing his module with Thor, with the rest of his housemates and Steve as an audience.
“Trust me, kid, let’s go,” he stretched his hand out to her.
After a sigh, Bruce said, “so that Thor can save Asgard from those beasts. I wanted to help him. And I didn’t want the enemy to be powerful.”
“Dude, this is sick!” Clint gasped. He walked around the silver one, touching the shiny skin and marveling at it.
“We haven’t even started, Natasha,” Steve sighed. Natasha let out a chuckle and nudged at Steve's side.
But Tony was still feeling conflicted. Thor had said they would back him up as long as Tony trusted himself. Tony did trust himself, but why did something feel so fishy? Even when Tony was defending Obadiah, his gut feeling wasn’t feeling fully satisfied by the explanation he was giving...
“Yeah,” Sam agreed.
“I know,” he managed to say. “But how? I built this to withstand great amount of forces!”
Thank you everyone for your support!
Pinkish-purple ray shot out. Steve and the others managed to get out of the way. But Tony did not reach his suit on time. In fact, the beam had hit him, and it sent him flying a meter away from where he was; he was just about to enter his suit. The force of the beam made Tony faceplant right into his suit. A guttural scream left his mouth, as he continued flying ahead, and he felt a tingling sensation engulf him. Flying freely for a few seconds, Tony felt the wind slapping his face, and the buildings and sky blurred around him. The last thing he saw was the blue sky, before his whole world went black.
“He has a lot of things to say.” Tony continued. “So he will be with you. Wanda happily agreed to take the couch.”
Peter stepped out of the washroom, squeezing one of his bag’s straps way harder than he should be.
The armor closed and lighted up. After a second of loading, the powerful unibeam was blasted at the Giant. It went straight through him, creating a big hole on his chest. The Giant fell down.
The four of them walked down the stairs, to the kitchen.
"What if he got wiped out of existence?!" Wanda started to panic.
“AIM already has one,” Bruce replied. “They managed to make one mini version of it and that’s with me. It’s the gun that they were using yesterday. I examined it, studied it. I even interrogated the AIM guy. So within two hours, I managed to come up with a makeshift machine myself, with the help of the leader.”
The boy slowly looked up at Tony, fear written all over his face. “Is he gone?”
,” Steve spat out the last part. “You’re not gonna hit him as long as he’s with us, with
“Well shit,” Tony rubbed his eyes. “How did you carry me up here? How long was I out?”
Steve was just standing and watching in silence. He was very quiet.
“Your answer better be good,” Clint gritted his teeth.
“Hey, I wasn’t that hungry,” Tony raised his hands, as if he were surrendering.
Tony was outright offended. “I’m not weak, Cap.”
“Is everything okay, sir?” the maître d came over and asked Steve, making Steve nearly jump up from his chair.
Bruce scoffed. He saw that first-hand.
“I’m so ready,” Tony smiled at Steve.
“She was honored to have you wield her,” Thor said.
“For just, leaving you. Without saying anything. Just abruptly, flying off to some other dimension,” Bruce said. He stuttered slightly but managed to say it.
Clint then thought it’ll be fun to push Tony down and jump onto him, in the water. He crept up behind him and did a countdown to himself. And then, he dashed down to where Tony’s back was.
He turned to the window, taking in the view of the skyline. “What’s the time, Nat?”
Wanda and Bruce returned back to the basement. They were pretty surprised that the 3 of them had left the place, especially when they were told to stay. They scanned the basement.
“Right, wait little guy!” Steve sounded tired but couldn’t help laughing at his stubbornness. Once they neared the house, he put Bucky down. Steve was holding his hand while walking back. “You hang in there, Tony. We’ll get you to bed soon, ok?” Steve smiled at him.
Hearing Steve shout at him made Tony crumble on the inside. He dropped the hammer instantly and sat down on the floor. He drew his knees to his chest and curled up, starting to cry.
Tony smirked. “Well, Ty is still with you.”
“Now my palate’s fucked up,” he whispered to Natasha, who smiled.
Reed stretched out both his arms and caught all the Giants; there were just three of them. Sue created a shield for Reed from another Frost Giant and Wanda took the chance to push that Giant back.
“I have a lot of surprises,” Steve said, while stroking himself.
“Rogers!” she wheezed. “You’ve gotta do… do better than say,
“Meet master Stark and his friends,” Jarvis introduced them.
He raised Mjolnir towards the sky and called down lightning. The rest of them at the back were watching the scene unfolding in front of them with awe. Doctor Strange knew what was going to happen.
Tony’s face flushed. “And I assume you’re not happy with that. Your tone says so.”
“12, boss,” Friday replied. Tony could see Steve tensing up from his peripheral vision.
Feel free to leave a comment below on your thoughts! :D
I hope you enjoy the story! Happy reading!
“I’m so glad you all are back,” Steve said. “Bucky did his business on me.” He stood up to show the wet patch on his shirt.
“I am sorry to interrupt but we must bring back the rest of them,” Thor said. He smiled at them.
The team gets to know about the stone and the relations between them are improving.
Steve threw him an incredulous look. “Why would I slap a two-year-old kid?! And if you must know, it was one of the Frost Giants.”
‘How did this happen?’ Steve mumbled to himself.
“So obviously friend Tony wasn’t kidnapped,” Thor pointed out. “Either he had a really bad stomach or something has happened to him.
Linda decided to settle the toys while Kayla decided to settle the necessary items. Both of them split up. Tony had gone down a few shops to look for some good baby books and clothes.
Steve frowned. “No, you were never a disappointment. Also, you can take a look at the photos. I won’t bite.”
“Yes actually,” Steve smiled. “Both of you are healthy, good looking adults.”
“Well people here chose Grey’s Anatomy!” Sam argued back.
“Young master,” Jarvis replied. “Would you like to go to Captain Rogers’ room?”
“Hey we had a deal!” Sam shouted at the ceiling.
“I uh, uh, I was doing uh, something,” Steve stammered.
Thor and Frost Giant didn’t see where they were going. Both of them wrestled till they were at the edge of the roof. Thor tripped and he pulled the Frost Giant with him, falling straight down to the pavement and letting go of his hammer accidentally. As his hands were occupied, Thor couldn’t call his hammer on time.
“Again?!” Steve said, throwing both Jarvis and Tony an incredulous look.
“My lemonade has chlorine now, Thor,” Bruce sighed. He was really soaked and shook his head. “Gotta get a new one.”
I hope you guys are enjoying the story. Leave a comment on how it is so far! I welcome feedback (or constructive criticism) so leave a comment, hehe!
“No worries,” T’Challa assured them.
“I’ll see you too, Fisk,” Natasha barely smiled.
Tony looked so peaceful when asleep. His chest was rising and falling at a steady pace, and he looked beautiful. Steve brushed back his hair, sighing softly.
Tony was assembling another piece of puzzle. He was an expert in this and loved it. He was seated on the couch, sandwiched between Bucky and Clint, who were watching him assemble the puzzle intently. He was all focused on putting the pieces together.
Just 3 hours after Tony fell, the whole team was up. They were not much for sleep because of mission calls at odd hours. Some of them had showered and were getting ready for breakfast. Linda and Kayla were setting the table.
“I’ll be okay,” Steve said.
It's Chinese New Year here in Singapore, so if I have any Chinese readers, Happy New Year to you!
“Is it just me, or do we all look good in sunglasses?” Clint asked, adjusting his.
“Gosh my arm hurts,” Tony complained as he sat on the couch.
“Bruce,” Natasha said. “This AIM idiot has the cure. But it isn’t foolproof yet. We need you to take this to your lab and see what you can work on.”
“I see. Well I need you down here to look at the stone with me,” Bruce sighed. A girl’s giggling could be heard at the background. Bruce turned to his back with a smile.
Wanda and Bruce were busy playing with Chippy in the backyard. Kayla and Linda were with them.
“Babe! There’s a new cafe that they just opened here. I’ll take you there from your school before I go off with Thor to meet my professor. Wait for me at the entrance, okay!”
“I’m a fugitive right now. In fact, I shouldn’t even have entered the United States. Captain America is this… I don’t think I should hold the shield while being a fugitive, Tony. You were kind of right when you said I didn’t deserve the shield.”
Thor sighed and muttered, “next time,” to himself.
“I won’t,” the AI said.
“You know, I can’t… can’t…” Tony tried telling him that he didn’t like to be handed things. He was gesturing wildly as his words were stuck inside him. Luke couldn’t understand but Danny somehow did.
Bucky on the other hand was still enthusiastic.
Tony was holding his stomach, guffawing. Steve looked at him, his face was very red.
“Sorry!” he waved at them while running. He managed to push the jeans button in. “Ah yes!”
Tony took it, and took a sip. The citrus flavor woke him up immediately.
Steve was smiling at the others. The memories of the kids running around and playing was still fresh in his mind. He could still hear their giggles and them fondly calling him,
Steve looked at him. “I am fine, Sam.”
“Wow, you are a handful,” Tony sighed.
The portal was closing with an agonizing pace. The four of them pressed on, not caring about the pain that was emerging. And soon, their efforts paid off.
“Because you are not giving Captain Rogers a chance to explain his side, sir,” Jarvis spoke up.
“It’s 3am,” Clint replied.
It was 7am the next day. Kayla, Linda and Wanda were wide awake. They had showered and were just sitting on the couch.
“Well,” Jarvis laughed. “You’ll see it. Sit back and relax.”
not to look nervous.
“Rhodey,” Tony started to massage his forehead. The tablet’s screen lit up again, showing Ross calling. “We’re happy this once. Look around you. Everyone is back, looking relaxed and jovial. Yeah, we have problems looming around us. But, can we just enjoy this for a while? You deserve the happiness too you know. You’ve done a lot for me, for us. Take a break, Rhodey.”
Peter grinned sheepishly at him. He went closer to speak. “I’m so sorry.”
**There's mentions and description of PTSD in this chapter, and mentions of bullying**
Clint lost it. He clenched his fist and raised it, about to punch the living shit out of Fisk. But he came crashing down onto the floor, as a result, punching the air instead.
“I’m still alive, Steve,” Rhodey started. He was looking at the floor. “That fall should have killed me. But it didn’t. I’m still trying to walk. Ever since I got discharged, I’ve been trying to walk. Tony gave me this exoskeleton to help. But it sucks, not being able to walk on my own. I even argued with Tony, told him I wanted to join them as War Machine.” He let out a small laugh before continuing.
Bruce was only slightly relieved.
Steve looked around the table and realized that he was the odd one out. Even Natasha was wearing something shorter than what he was wearing.
“So, my dad did find you,” Tony cocked his head to the side. “How did you survive the icy cold waters?”
At this time, Tony thought that this was the first time he ever heard anyone speak about Howard’s stress. It’s not a normal topic that was touched in the Stark household. Of course, Tony understood that his dad was stressed over the company and was having a hard time. But that doesn’t justify him slapping Tony or a guest, who simply wanted to have a good time with Tony.
“Me too, your highness,” Tony said.
He heard a shuffle behind him and turned. It was Kayla. Even in the darkness, he felt her stare; it was gentle. They were looking at each other for a long time. Just silence and acknowledging each other’s presence.
“Can I have the remote, please?” Kayla asked. She looked very worried.
Brooklyn Bridge Park at 10am was packed with mothers with strollers, tourists and joggers. Pepper had texted him that the investor would be standing at the Brooklyn Bridge Lookout. So he walked there.
Tony flew out of the store. He stopped in front of the first portal.
“Say, did I actually hear that? Gosh Rogers, I’m so hurt!” Tony said. He faked a shocked expression, as he walked in with Clint and Bruce.
“So, that’s exactly what happened, Coulson,” Natasha ended off with a sigh.
“Tony,” Steve whispered, looking directly into Tony’s eyes. “You can’t do that…”
“He said NO!!” Jan screamed, startling the others. She straightened up once she saw her old friend standing in her apartment. “Oh, hey Tony.”
“Sarcastic much.” Tony smiled. The screen went blank.
While he was in the freeway, Clint, Bruce and Steve sent him their replies back, respectively.
“Tony?” Natasha asked in cajoling tone. “Aren’t you going to look at us, one last time?”
Tony now had a wide grin on his face. He forgot Clint was checking on his injuries and ran to Captain America, with his arms wide. Steve got the cue. He lifted Tony up, with a chuckle.
“Alright friend Tony, now we are ready,” Thor smiled. “Let's start off with the vowels.”
“Come on lab buddy,” Bruce sighed.
“You okay?” Clint asked him.
“Sam are you ok?” Steve asked his wingman.
Wanda chuckled at what Linda had said.
Will Clint and Natasha be paired up together? And how is Tony going to go forward with his theater module? Please drop a comment if you have any feedback! :)
“Are the Avengers here?” Thor asked slowly. He gave her a little smile.
They keep pushing back the army and one last hero gets de-aged. Plus another team of heroes join the last part of the battle.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said softly, but it was audible enough for everyone gathered at the kitchen.
“What is?” Bruce looked up. But both being geniuses, they were on the same page within seconds. “Yeah, the stone. This seems the right place.”
The rest of them continued to eat. But it was getting difficult for Steve to eat. He couldn’t resist looking at Tony. He simply wanted to devour him and that thought itself was making his cock stir in his pants. Steve cleared his throat, and hoped no one had seen him squirm.
“Selfish much?” Tony raised an eyebrow while touching himself.
That was the coolest thing both the soldiers heard.
He flew straight towards the second portal and stopped just a few centimeters away from it. The others moved out of his way. Sam then launched the flames at the portal. Several Frost Giants began to melt. Some of them ran back down the portal. That was the first time they all heard the Frost Giants’ screams. Sam cheered while firing in.
“Tonee.” Clint was looking at him expectantly. Tony didn’t know what he wanted. He didn’t have that much of an experience with toddlers. But once Clint stretched his arms out, Tony couldn’t help but grin.
Tony poured himself a piping hot cup of coffee. He quickly drank it without flinching. “I’m sure I did. See you all later, if any idiot decides to do something stupid.”
“How about a change of game?” Tony suggested. “Whoever wins that, is the winner for whatever challenge this is.”
Tony chuckled. “You can’t ask me the same question twice, Steve.”
Steve let out a chuckle, hoping he wouldn’t have an obvious boner.
“Mr. Stark-” Jarvis was about to stop Howard, but was pushed down by him, again.
“To our ride,” Tony replied. He took out the device which looked like a small remote control and pressed one of the buttons.
Rhodey gave him a skeptical look. “Well, worst things could have happened.” Steve internally cringed at that. “So, you’re on comms with them?”
“Mjolnir is protecting Tony,” Thor said firmly. He ran and grabbed the assistant that was firing at Tony. Both of them fell right down the big hole, and Clint heard a lot of screams emerge from below them.
“Tony…  Stark,” Thor slowly spoke. “It’s alright. I’ll take care of him. Let him go. We need to… take care of our injured ones.”
“What’s a dick?” Tony asked while pouting. Steve was wiping away the tears from the little boy’s eyes. His hand froze when he heard that question.
“Breakfast,” Natasha replied. She heard the ding sound come from the toaster and her toasts sprang up. She took them and placed them neatly on a blue ceramic plate.
He calmed down, because he had to, and started to think. Where would Tony, Wanda and Chippy go? If they went out, there was a high chance they were around the neighborhood because Chippy goes around here. Wanda would usually love to hang around at the back of the house.
Tony let out a little groan when he realized the battle wasn’t over yet. Everyone else readied their weapons. Tony was jogging back to where he had left his armor.
“I didn’t go back home for the night and Aunt May’s gonna be worried!” Spidey started to panic. “Oh my, what do I do?”
Jarvis was surprised at how Steve had called Tony’s dad by his name. “Uh, yes Master Rogers. He is at his office.”
“Yes Clint. I mean, duh,” Tony laughed. “And the plan for tomorrow is pretty simple. In the morning, we’ll chill at my house and then, maybe, hit the beach for a while. In the evening, all 6 of us have a reservation booked at this fancy restaurant.”
“Well in my defense,” Tony spoke. “We were mostly trying to save the world from aliens, HYDRA idiots, AIM fools. So there was no time for deep talk.”
“We need the boy,” one of the AIM scientists said. “After we’re done with our experiments, you can have him back.”
His statement earned him laughter from his audience. Whitney was watching him with a rigid facial expression, bordering on anger.
“Of course it’ll take time, Clint. But for now, we’re fine. Oh and no more sides.” Tony smiled as they shook hands.
“Don’t say a word,” Steve looked at Tony with a 'don't you dare laugh' warning look when he brought his order to the table.
him,” Clint assured the little boy.
“He’s behind you, Cap, and Bruce has secured the science stuff in the Quinjet,” Clint replied. “Civilians all clear.”
Hi guys! How are y'all doing?
“Yeah, that’s why we’re called the Avengers.” Steve shrugged. “Danger is pretty common to us. And we usually avert it. Hey are you…”
Tony snorted, while Natasha laughed at Steve’s excitement.
“Avengers don’t kill,” Tony said. “I just wanted to have a chat with you, you idiot.”
“Few blocks? Does he even know we exist?” Tony scoffed.
Bucky snapped out of whatever trance he was in. He walked to where Tony was standing. “What is it?”
Tony opened his face plate up and both Steve and Tony threw their team members, who were laughing, a light-hearted glare.
“Thought you might need this.” Tony offered Steve the shield. Black Panther’s scratch marks were gone and it looked brand new. “I cleaned it up and was waiting for the right opportunity, Cap.”
“That’s not what friends do, Tony,” Clint added on.
“I’m parked at the Tower’s garage,” Happy said.
watching the five-seater ride slowly rising up. After a few seconds, it dipped down. The people sitting on it screamed.
In a while, Tony was fully standing. He placed his arms on Steve’s hips and pulled him closer. He felt a sharp pain on both his ankles. But he still didn’t care. Tears were flowing out of his eyes, from out of both physical and emotional pain. In the end, Tony couldn’t take it. He involuntarily groaned into the kiss, in agony.
Clint and Bucky were already up.
(See the end of the chapter for
The students walking past them stopped to watch the fight.
“Sharon Stone!” Steve exclaimed, pointing to her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. “Bucky’s favorite actress!”
Tony took in a deep breath. His good friends were just a level down and he was really looking forward to spending a good time with them. He didn’t want his father or his words to ruin his mood. “Okay, fine. I get it. But don’t you dare tell me you wanted to protect me. I can’t bear to hear that anymore. You just want yourself to shine and bask in all the spotlight. You are just like any other businessman, selfish and cruel. I get it. I fucking get-”
Tony nodded his head. “It's okay... but was… pretty terrible to have you come at me like that. Especially in front of everyone else.”
Tags will be updated as the story goes on. I decided to stick with members of the OG 6 on earth-3490 too because I really love the OG6, and it's more fun to write them. Honestly, the interactions between Steve, Tony and earth-3490 Avengers is gonna be quite fun!
“People around here are okay, I guess,” Tony shrugged.
Tony was looking at it with awe. “Did dad build that?”
A sigh. “No, I wanted to be here.”
“It’s fine. It’s air conditioned here too and we can sleep here,” Natasha smiled.
“Attention, Americans,” a loud voice with an accent spoke loudly from the Helicarrier speakers. “Today we are here to cleanse this nation and bring a new form of purity. We are starting from New York, where the aliens first attacked, bringing down hellfire from the skies.”
“Bruce, you don’t get it,” Tony turned to look at his good friend. “Obi has been there for me for a long time. Whenever my dad abuses me, he’s there to stop it. He’s taken some serious PR fire when my dad couldn’t cope. I don’t think I’m buying my dad’s accusation on Obi.”
“Yes,” Tony nodded his head. “We will. Tomorrow.”
“I can break open the pendant,” Tony offered nonchalantly. “But I won’t touch the stone.”
Bruce went closer to Natasha. He was sitting beside her. They both got hold of each other’s hands. Bruce had a very tight grip. Natasha could take it though. They sat like that for a long time, in silence, that was more than comfortable for the both of them. They enjoyed being in each other’s presence. She was happy knowing that Bruce was always here, no matter what. He was happy knowing that Natasha had forgiven him and was with him at the present moment. Natasha then hugged Bruce. It had been a difficult time in both of their lives. The hug between them symbolized that no matter what happened, they would always be there for one another. Natasha squeezed him while Bruce was trying to blink back his tears.
“Oh, I’d like you to take a look at this tomorrow morning at 10.” Reed spoke while flipping through his notes. “Sue will receive you. Ben and Johnny will be with me upstairs.”
“That was his stupid plan?!” Clint asked, staring at the explosion from the bank, looking horrified.
“Yeah,” Tony started. “It’s uh, perfect for a flight.”
Tony didn’t reply to that. He was still trying to get a hold of himself.
“He was screaming like a little girl,” Bruce was laughing.
“Jesus,” Steve swore. “No Tony, I got this. Get the civilians and go!”
But then, Tony felt like he was suspended. Plus it was taking too long, he should have fallen down by now. Moreover, he felt something sticky on both his arms. So he opened his eyes. All around him, it was red. He looked up; even the sky was red. He was suspended in a red bubble.
Steve smiled at them and nodded his head. “Just… don’t treat me differently.”
The stone was nearer to the stairs. And there were two babies seated near it. Steve gasped. He felt like he had seen enough, all his teammates de-aging and leaving him alone. He felt alone now; with the quinjet in stealth mode, thanks to Tony Stark, he couldn’t go back to the Tower to get help. He couldn’t send a signal to the Tower either, because according to Bruce,
“One day, the son and his friends rounded me at the corner street, where no one was. Clint was one of them. They were going to bash me up. I gave up and was so ready to take the hits. And then, it was as if some miracle had happened. Or he must have seen me give up. He used a slingshot and a couple of stones to chase his own friends away. He gave me his hand and I took it,” Natasha smiled, and tears slowly gathered in her eyes.
“Yes you do,” Tony pointed out. “Take it, Steve. I understand you’re a super soldier but I need you to take it.”
Tony and his close friends embark on a little mission to see if Howard's accusation is valid.
Everyone quickly got to work. Thor and Iron Man were flying together, with Ant Man shrunk to a smaller size, sitting on Tony’s armor. The rest of them were punching the Frost Giants, trying to push them back. Doctor Strange was levitating and using his powers to make the Frost Giants fall instead of walking in. Black Widow easily broke a few Frost Giants’ limbs.
“Steve,” Natasha called. She was sitting beside him. “You’re worried, aren’t you?”
Rhodey activated the tablet. He pressed a few things and opened up the security footages.
They all ran into the living room. They weren’t expecting a hole formed at the end of their hallway though.
“We’re fine with anything,” Natasha smiled.
“Fingers crossed that I won’t get theatre stuff,” Tony said. He stood up and went to the sink to wash his plate. “I mean, it’s like, my third choice!”
“I uh…” Steve didn’t know how to explain. “I feel conflicted. And I’m... I'm sorry about what happened to you.”
Wanda slowly lifted the stone using her powers. She felt energy drawing out of the stone. It was threatening to go beyond the control of her powers. She felt it. She felt the strong urge to let go. She was panting. Bruce was watching her. He was just observing her, in surprise. Her hands were shaking. “I… I c… can’t,” she breathed. Her powers started to fade. She was trying and trying to keep it within her control. But every effort of hers was in vain.
Tony frowned. What leg was Steve talking about?
“I’m on it,” the AI replied.
Steve nodded his head. They all had heard the exchange Tony and Spidey had over the comms.
“Yeah?” she smiled at him.
“Wow, so enthusiastic,” the doctor laughed.
“Tony!” Clint grinned. Behind him, Thor walked in, holding his lunch bag.
“Why would you wear jeans in such a hot weather?” Thor took the last bite off his cheeseburger and asked. “You have to wear shorts like how we all wore them!”
Rhodey smiled and sat down on the couch, with Sam’s help.
They had fun together. But Steve always had to pull Bucky towards him. Just one second of looking away or not holding his hand could end up in Steve chasing baby Bucky down the street.
“You went to a restaurant all by yourself?” she raised an eyebrow at him.
“Okay,” Steve stood up. “Hawkeye, I need you and Natasha to pair up. Wanda and I will be another pair. Your pair and mine, we’ll take to the streets. Falcon, air reconnaissance, report from upstairs as to what you see, don’t get caught. Heavy hitters, wait until we
Tony placed one foot down and added some weight. The pain shot up from his ankle and he quickly withdrew. “Yikes! It’s so bad. And I didn’t even know I had sprained both of them!”
Tony scurried out of there after giving his team a wave, missing Clint’s worried look entirely. He was hoping not to come face-to-face with Steve. Another great day he had foreseen.
“My back…” he groaned.
“I do not think Loki is that smart and fit for one of the best universities in the world,” Thor said softly.
“You don’t need to force yourself, Beth,” Tony said, giving her an assuring smile.
“I will your highness. Thank you,” Steve replied with a light smile. “I will watch out for Bucky. I still do trust Tony.”
Doctor Strange then used his powers to lift the stone. He did it without any difficulties.
But Earth’s Mightiest Heroes stepped in on time and managed to stop them from firing it at the civilians. The device didn’t have much of an effect on buildings, but it had hit a tree and the tree disappeared.
Tony was throwing the car keys up and down, waiting for Thor to be done. Natasha and Bruce were already walking down the stairs, while Clint and Steve were with Tony. All of them were checking for their valuables; Clint came up with an idea to store all their hand phones and wallets inside one bag so that they could use one locker. So everything was in one bag, including two water bottles, a sunscreen, a few packets of snacks and their wristbands, compliments of Tony who had bought that for his friends and himself online; just two days prior to their trip to Malibu.
Tony looked away. “I guess I just wanted to you know… tell you that I guess we can start again…? So many things have happened between us and I realize, there are threats out there that’ll require us to be united. Can we you know… start again?”
Clint wiped away his tears too. He gave Tony’s shoulder a pat. The penthouse was silent; everyone was trying to understand what Tony had gone through. Steve’s eyes were red. He was holding his boyfriend’s hand, squeezing it tightly, hoping someday Tony wouldn’t have to feel this much of pain.
“Eye contact is a must,” Professor Williams smiled as he surveyed around the classroom at the students discussing in pairs. “You need to be relaxed, pause at appropriate times and don’t let your arms flail. Instead, make sure they move with purpose.”
“I heard you phoned Obi the other day and asked him some questions,” Howard walked towards him. “You shouted and created a scene over the phone.”
“You’re bleeding,” Peter said quietly. He stretched out his little hand. “You don’t mind me touching you?”
Taking the full brunt of the slap was Steve, who had pushed Tony away just in time. He held onto the wall, and his other hand was holding his left cheek, which was turning red.
Obadiah laughed as Tony skipped out of the office. After shutting the door, Tony pulled out his phone and sent a text to the others.
He threw up into the bag, doubling over as the sensation was intense.
She pouted at him. “Okay Steeb.” Her little arms clung onto Steve’s neck. He returned the hug back. He patted her back slowly and Natasha’s head was resting on Steve’s shoulders. After a while when she started to cough, he let go of her to rub her back. He then kissed her on her forehead, on the injury, and carried her. He left her with the others near the television set. She went to get her coloring book instead of joining them to play.
“You know what son,” Howard shook his head. He looked really disappointed. He started to walk away from Tony. “This was a mistake.”
If you've got feedback you can leave a comment! I'd be more than happy to read and reply! :)
For now, he simply wanted to do up Natasha’s and Clint’s stuff.
“Cap,” Tony drawled. He looked up at Steve shyly. “You need the two healthy, good looking adults back right?”
Of course, Tony knew. He didn’t really give Steve the attention, because he wanted to tease him. But he didn’t know teasing Steve would ultimately bring out the beast in him.
“He isn’t here,” Reed looked up. “I would have checked on him if he was here.”
“Are you serious?!” Tony bounced on the bed. He was staring at Steve in wonder. “I managed to make an arc reactor…. To fit my chest area! Oh… so that’s what that weird feeling is.” Tony ran a hand across his chest.
“I agree.” Rhodey was
“Gym was just fine,” Steve replied, sounding tense. “How’s your leg?”
Tony’s dry throat had caused him to cough, softly at first, but gradually louder. And then the movements started in the room. Bruce was the first to get up.
“Okay Scott,” Tony said. “A Frost Giant appeared from the back of that building. There’s an alley in between. You think the leader is somewhere there?”
“I know Steve,” Tony whispered. “You’ve always been there.”
And then he came face-to-face a Howard Stark, who was wearing a suit on this hot afternoon.
“Oh.” After a beat. “You didn’t follow them?”
“Master Stark, come on,” Jarvis sighed. Ana, who had just joined them, helped Steve.
Bruce stood up. “That’s true. But the Frost Giants couldn’t find the stone when it was buried in Asgard. So chances are, if we bury it here and they come, they won’t be able to find it. Plus, if Thor comes, it’ll be easier to retrieve it.”
Chapter 5 will drop by tomorrow. The rest of them will be a weekly basis (unless I get really busy)!!
“Clint, it’s just some stupid socks!” Natasha sighed and sat down on their shared bed.
Tony immediately took one Nutella crepe for himself. The others helped themselves. Bruce and Clint loved the taste of it; they were trying not to moan in front of Jarvis. Natasha and Thor decided to go for a second round of crepes. Steve and Tony were still enjoying their first piece.
Bruce shrugged. “I am. Just worried about Tony but other than that, I’m okay.”
“Oh Thor,” Tony sighed melodramatically. “You’re my hero!”
Feeding Clint and Tony is quite a difficult thing. Plus they have a visitor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come on Tony!” Bucky was laughing while holding Chippy. “Chippy just wanted to play with you.”
“No you weren’t,” Natasha replied.
He parked the car and simply walked in, after showing his pass to the security.
In mid-air, now, little Tony’s eyes welled up. Tears spilled out. And Tony saw Steve’s figure getting tinier.
“I just…” Steve’s voice cracked, and he was trying to swallow the lump he had. “I just hate the cold, Tony.” He whispered.
“Oh Tony,” Steve laughed. He made a mental note to ask adult Tony about Peggy. He then ruffled Tony’s hair.
“It’s because the Avengers are here.” She let go of his arm. “We united because
“Alright, for now, this should be fine,” Steve sighed. He still felt uncertain. But he left it at that.
At that exact moment, there were sounds of several turbine engines running. Everyone looked up to see a S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier flying slowly, directly above them.
“Yeah, so is your invention to cleanse this city,” Tony said.
was the only thing Steve could think of. But what Steve didn’t know was that Tony was right behind him.
Now, both of them sat down on the couch after an hour of walking practice. Rhodey was drinking some orange juice. Sam was fiddling with his phone. He had received a message from Steve, telling him to come down to East Somerville somehow, as he needed him.
“We can’t bring them back using the stone?” Tony asked. He still seemed dazed.
Steve nodded. He was smiling at her, as a gesture to offer her some encouragement. “You were brave too. Don’t deny it. You were doing your best to protect the little ones. I mean, if the Frost Giant was holding you, it means you must have jumped in first to protect them.”
He shut his eyes for a brief moment. Then opened it. His hand automatically grabbed the stone, ignoring the ongoing arguments he had with his conscience.
“Thank you, Kayla and Linda,” Steve smiled. “You girls were a great help these past few days. I really appreciate that. We will always keep in contact. Come to New York someday.” The girls nodded at that. Steve gave them both a pat on the shoulders before walking away to the quinjet.
Steve watched his boyfriend having an orgasm, and felt his own manhood twitch. He loved Tony’s orgasm face and wanted to see that one more time.
All the visitors, except for T’Challa, had left the Tower an hour ago. The others were just walking around the penthouse in groups, and were talking to one another.
After dinner, Tony was sitting down with Natasha on the couch. They both were watching cartoons, with Tony commenting on how much the animation had changed. Tony said he really loved the Scooby-Doo series and he was in for a pleasant surprise when a cartoon channel played the 1960s version. He was glued to the TV screen, with Natasha making sure Tony was fine and no danger was lurking around him.
Clint grinned at that.
“We were lucky Doctor Strange came in time. He was the one who checked your cheek after the slap. His red Cloak was attracted to you and Clint, when you both were de-aged.”
All of them seated on the sofa turned towards the stairs.
“Point taken,” Rhodey rolled his eyes in annoyance.
Both of them started to walk back to where the others were gathered.
But it was too late. The footage was already being played on the big holographic screen, situated in front of the couch. Everyone’s attention was on it.
“And do you think I’m gonna just stand there and welcome them back to the States?” General Ross asked roughly. “They didn’t sign the Accords and-”
“Stop twisting my words Steve! I said that out of anger!” Tony’s face darkened slightly.
Tony dropped Clint right outside the entrance of the Helicarrier before speeding off behind the Quinjet, which just took off into the deep blue skies.
“We’re not telling anyone about this. I don’t want Steve to hear about me nearly setting a kitchen on fire,” Sam said. “You hear this F.R.I.D.A.Y? No one should hear about this, don’t tell anyone.”
He carried Tony and placed him on the wheelchair.
You can leave a comment if you have feedback to give. Thank you! :)
“You’d rather fight The Purple Man 3 times than this, right?” Luke chuckled. Jessica answered that question with a glare.
“They uh, Linda has nicknames. Actually Bruce encouraged us to call him that.” Kayla offered Bucky his drink while answering.
Bruce looked at Tony. He was very stressed. At this moment, he wanted nothing more than to bury the stone badly.
“Alright, let’s go,” Tony said once everyone seemed to be done with their lunch. The rest of them stood up with their milkshakes in their hands, while Bruce was still eating. “Bring it along!” Tony smiled.
Linda ran down the stairs while Kayla ran out of the open kitchen. Steve was staring at Sam, wide-eyed. The other kids froze in front of Sam, even when their toys flew out.
Writing a few of my favorite Marvel characters like Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Danny, Matthew and Foggy was really fun. They're gonna play important roles in the story and I can't wait to see them in action!
“I told him that I wish he wasn’t even born!” Howard shouted. He threw his glass at the kids, almost hitting Clint’s head. The glass shattered upon impact with the wall that was behind them. “I told him if I had an eraser, I would erase him out of my life! I told him the truth, that he was going to remain a failure forever!!!”
Natasha let out a snort. “Just ask me or Jan. We’ve gone out and explored the region already.” Once she said that, Steve threw her a strange look. “What? Where do you think I go on the days I get back late? Also, where do you think Jan gets all her super good-looking clothes from? It’s all in exploring, Rogers.”
Tony vaguely registered a soothing British voice calling him. He brushed it off and turned to the other side of the bed to continue sleeping.
Tony found himself tossing and turning on his bed. He woke up, feeling sweat dripping down his forehead. His room was really dark, and Natasha wasn’t beside him anymore. He was having a little nightmare of his dad chasing him around the house. He still felt scared, and lightly shaken. He didn’t like being alone in a big room right after a nightmare. So he did what he always did after a nightmare.
The couple took a look at the girl in Iron Man’s arms and sighed in relief.
They all fell asleep there, and Bruce was the last one to. He switched off the television, lights and pulled the curtains shut. He placed a blanket over all of them and joined his friends and fell asleep, feeling at home with them by his side.
And then Sam brought in the Captain America and Iron Man plushies Tony owned. The plushies chased the big bird away. Sam made various sounds. He made Carol and Claire squeal in joy. They thanked the plushies for their help and went to their animals.
“That was…” Tony was trying to catch his breath. “Wow, that was good.”
“Thor! Catch Sam!” Captain America ordered.
Alternate universes huh. Tony couldn’t wait to see the machine.
Tony raised up the hammer and lightning was called. The communal level’s long paneled glass windows shattered as lightning came charging through. Tony slammed the hammer onto the ground with all his might. A solid crack ran across the floor, and the place felt like an earthquake had hit it. The scientists running lost their balance and fell down. The floor below them, near the elevator at the left end of the hallway, gave way. Some of the scientists fell through that hole to the level below.
“Oh my god!!” Clint exclaimed, getting the attention of a few tourists. “You guys are nuts!!”
The rest of the team were more than happy too, especially since they didn’t have to deal with the pain of seeing two people in love with each other give excuses as to why they shouldn’t be together.
“I may have something for the both of you,” Tony said.
But being his partner, Natasha knew best. “I know that face, Clint.” She gave him a very subtle glare. “You want to touch the stone.”
Tony continued to look at the greenery outside. “I… I actually don’t know, Nat.” He sighed.
“Careful,” Clint warned. “Not many people can lift it. They can only lift it if they’re worthy.”
was moving.
After a few minutes, Tony’s nosebleed stopped. Jarvis suggested they all went up and saw how their rooms looked like. All of them slowly trudged up. They turned left and stopped. There were a few room doors and no one knew which one was whose.
He knew she was right. “I feel like I shouldn’t have taken that stone.”
“Tony,” he began. “Remember that day, you were naked with Sunset, in your room? Did you two really… have sex?”
“Multiverse, Tony. Nothing to do with religion,” Reed pointed out with his lips pursed.
The others were looking outside expectantly. After a few bends and passing by a few tall trees, their patience paid off. The 6 of them were looking at a big helicopter landing patch. To top it off, it was surrounded by a huge grass field. It was so big Clint was sure they all could play a game of tag there and never get caught. They passed by two tennis courts, with two men placing the nets in the middle.
Happy reading! :)
There was a small crowd gathered behind them, slightly further away. Some men who were among the crowd, were taking pictures of Tony.
The excited girl shut the front door. The gang placed their luggage near the stairs and then sat down on the fluffy sofa set.
