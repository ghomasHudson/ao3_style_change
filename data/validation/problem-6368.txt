Steve kissed the crown of Tony’s head again and smiled. “You’re getting melodramatic now. I think Natasha might be right about you.”
Steve snickers. “Well, I don’t think that would be the case here, either, but no. We can’t have children. It’s not in our nature.”
Tony begins to turn, to walk away, but Steven isn’t finished yet even as Jamison and Harry approach him. “You’re better than this. I know you are. I know the core of the man you are.”
Steve ignores the slight and digs out his thermos. He fills the cup with coffee and gives it to Tony. It’s still steaming hot.
Son of a bitch. Tony knows Steve’s going to figure it out; he’s a master strategist after all. It’s in his nature. Everything special about him came out of a bottle is a lot of bullshit. This is purely skinny Rogers taking on the billionaire playboy with every fiber of his being thrown behind the task.
“Yeah, oh,” Steve responded and the hurt he felt in the house behind him faded and a new light, a new idea began to flicker within him, around him. It perplexed him until he realized it was their souls entangled and woven together. Steve released his fear, and the bond between them flourished like a vine reaching toward the sunlight. Tony must have read the same thing, must have experienced Steve embracing the idea through their souls because he gathered Steve to him and didn’t wait for an invitation to kiss him. Steve drank the kiss in, tasted it with a new fevered hunger. Through the kiss he communicated his acceptance and his own offering. It wasn’t frustration or exhaustion with his old indoctrination, but his actions entrenched in the feelings overwhelming him and flowing through the bond. He could no more deny Tony, than he could stop breathing.
It’s surprisingly fast. The nanites are prepped and injected within the first 30 minutes after Tony confirms that all of the tests indicate they have a working batch. Logan and Bruce sit in the background of the lab while a nurse helps inject Tony and Steve. Tony flinches once when the needle pierces him. He doesn’t really like anyone touching him and least of all medical staff. Steve doesn’t react when the black liquid disappears into his vein.  They sit there opposite one another on stools as the nurse cleans up the needles, tapes on the bandages, and then tells them to stay and not leave while JARVIS monitors them for any ill effects.
The press and media fanfare peaks and ebbs as it did the first time Tony disappeared, only this time he tells them that he’d gone off the grid for some reconnaissance and to ensure world peace. The press and media gobble it up like a bunch of turkeys getting ready for Thanksgiving. Tony’s happy they don’t ask about the solitary figure dressed in an ill-fitted flight uniform hanging in the back of his entourage.
“If that means losing it, yes. I do need to eat.” He grabs a sandwich and in no time at all gobbles up the whole thing. “I might need more.”
Natasha waited as Bruce exited to confer with JARVIS. She touched Steve’s shoulder and said, “Steve, you’re not alone.”
“Sure, I do.” He falls back onto his cot. “Never saw a Congressman or Senator I couldn’t fuck with and get them to agree to buy the next big thing to keep their district happy and their poll numbers on the rise.”
“We have some issues out in the Industrial Quarter that we should probably not put off for too long.”
Steve glues his mouth shut. That’s the second time Tony voiced an answer to a concern Steve hadn’t vocalized. He convinces himself for a second time it’s mere coincidence. He follows Tony even though it might end up as a major confrontation Steve’s not up for right now. The spears of pain in his face matches the ones jutting into his side. Sitting down sounds good.
“Get ready. As soon as I go up the ramp, I’m sure they will be there.” Steve hit the ignition and the car roared to life. He backed up out of the parking spot and headed to the exit. All the while the fuzziness in his head clouded his vision and he blinked away the blurriness. “Ready?”
“You can’t say that,” Natasha replied. Her eyes fiercely dark – almost black. “His powers will grow over the years and he won’t know it. He could lash out and hurt you.”
A kick to his side and Tony opened his eyes to see Rumlow standing over him. “I’m gonna see your boy after this. What say I tell him how you’re doing?” He flicked a long iron skewer in his hand, twirling it over his knuckles and then catching it before it fell to the roof. The glint of the metal shined in the sunlight and seared through Tony’s brain every time the reflection hit his eyes.
For the better part of two days, Tony worried about Steve and what had become of him. The news reported a nationwide manhunt. Steve had been labeled criminally insane, dangerous, and a threat to other humans due to his unnatural attraction and protection of vampires. On CNN, Secretary Ross explained that they’d detected the vampire residue on the Captain America with new, Hammer Industry designed biometric devices. Ross went on to elaborate about the Captain’s wavering devotion to the safety of humans and that he regularly supported a softer, more tolerant policy when it came to vampires. The CNN reporter asked about the quality of the new detector and whether or not it could distinguish between the residue that a V-Corps member might encounter daily in their interactions with the vampire community and the residue that might be specific for a human-vampire mating.
Dazed and pained, Bucky grimaces and squeezes his eyes closed, never giving absolution before he succumbs.
The clinical scientists in the room shifted uneasily at the turn of the conversation. The obvious hatred and competition between the two men meant nothing to Tony as he listened to how Steve had been used and abused over the last day. Had it only been a day? It could have been more – he had no idea how long he was in the cell before they brought him to the accursed roof. His spirit moved toward Steve, and thankfully, he was able to be close to his love. So close now, if he had a physical body he would have been able to touch him, lend a comforting hand, Tony saw the marks on Steve’s body. The stains of vampire bites. He wanted to scream and cry, but more than that a rage boiled inside of him. He cursed the undying corpse on the gurney, the uselessness of his wraith form, and then the hell that he must now abide as he witnessed the further desecration of his human mate and his love.
“Even worse?” Vision is sitting close to Wanda. He’s projecting his ‘human’ image. Steve’s noticed that Wanda always orbits him. Or he always revolves around her. It’s logical – they’re connected in a metaphysical dance.
Jarvis smiles at him. “Looks like falafel wraps. I hope you like it. I’ve just tried out a new recipe Ana and I encountered on our latest trip to Morocco.”
Tony comes to the side of the bed, settling down and picking up Steve’s limp hand. “Don’t you dare. It wasn’t ready. Your gland, it just wasn’t ready when we tried to re-bond. Once you’re healed, we can try again.”
Tony can’t help but stare at his Adam’s apple oscillating up and down in his throat. It’s prominent and, God help him, sexy as hell. He tears himself away from the sight, coughs, and says, “Kiss and tell. Tell me who it was? One of the secretaries in the pool. A nurse that bandaged your wounds.”
“Yeah, great deal. Let me tell you something, your negotiation skills suck,” Tony says and helps Steve toward the door. Tony glances at Rumlow, who lies unconscious with his dick out and burnt. He has no remorse for what he did to the prick.
Eyes – deep and powerful. Looking. Searching. Words. Not understood. Words filled with anguish. What are they? Who are they?
Tony only shook his head. Steve left it at that, not pressing him, but he suspected that Tony drank from other prisoners. Natasha said once that new vampires are the most ravenous. He wondered if Tony could control his thirst as he could now, or if some of the other prisoners may have succumbed to Tony’s need.
Nodding, Tony points toward the large bureau in the corner. Steve leans down, kisses him, and then jumps up to rummage through the drawers (mainly filled with clothes and the occasional tool) to find the tube. He brings it over to the bed. Crawling up to Tony, Steve massages his scalp.  Steve lies down on top of Tony, between his legs, their ever thickening cocks trapped between them. Tony circles his arms around him and groans as Steve pummels his mouth again.
Steve straightens up, steadies himself on his own two feet. “It will.” He hopes he sounds believable.
He walks the length of the boardwalk of the main street toward the saloon. It’s nearly time to meet Tony and his nerves tingle and jump. It feels like his skin is popping like Mexican jumping beans. He’s never allowed himself this luxury before, and he knows Bucky would never approve.
After long moments of settling and calming, Steve whispered, “I’m so sorry, Tony. I didn’t want you to face him alone. I wanted to be there.” Maybe if he’d been there things would have been different. He could have controlled the soul bond, cut it off. “The bond shouldn’t have done that.”
That’s when Clint flinches and says, “Go ahead, I know what you’re thinking. We’re all sitting here and living off him selling his body. You’re not wrong. But you don’t have all the facts.”
The ruin in that murmured word changed everything for Tony. He drank his full but stopped soon enough to just seal the mating bond and then moved away to look at his human. Tears were in the Steve’s eyes and he said, “Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you drink me dry?”
"It's not a big deal." Tony leans back, grinning up at him. "I have a feeling we're going to want that footage in a few years."
Steve finds himself missing, not for the first time, the absence of his name in these conversations. He knows that Nat and Clint had really only ever talked about him as the Captain for most of their work together, but the fact that they haven't offered up a name sign for him that isn't his title still rankles. They've tried to explain it to him, but it never sticks.
His face softens and he reaches up to embrace Rhodes. "Yeah, yeah, Rhodey. Just go on back to wherever you need to be and send me the bill for whatever procedures they put you through to make sure you're in tip-top shape."
Tony's gesticulating wildly at Natasha who's signing right back at him, and Rhodes is perched next to Steve, one hand resting on his shoulder as an anchor point except for when he's throwing his hands up at whatever Nat is saying as she signs wildly at Tony. Steve lost the thread of the conversation a while ago, distracted by the way Tony moves his hands. There's something skillful and practiced about the way he moves his hands, something that Steve hasn't quite mastered yet with his ASL. He's so used to filling in the sounds in his own head that it takes him a moment before he realizes that what he's hearing is actually Nat's voice.
Each time his thoughts go that far, though, he reels them back in and reminds himself that all of that can only ever happen if Thor makes his way back with Loki to undo what's been done to them. It's not that the silence is deafening, it's that he's finding himself wondering more and more if this is all he'll ever be again. The scarlet fever had stolen his hearing in one ear decades ago, and losing one of the many tethers to his enhanced existence rankles worse than he wants to give it credit for. For all that the excuse to stare at the beauty of Tony's hands is a welcome one, Steve thinks he might be happier if he could just go back to the way things were before.
Steve nods and looks away before Tony can read more into his expression than Steve wants him to. He gets to his feet and steps out of the control room, not letting himself look back. He knows Tony must be signing at him, knows JARVIS would be calling after him if he could hear, but if Tony really wants to keep him here, all he has to do is have JARVIS close and lock the door in front of him, and as that doesn't seem to be happening, Steve lets himself walk on through. They can worry about the rest later. Right now, Steve just needs some time to think.
Tony doesn't answer with words. He just pulls Steve in close. That speaks louder than words ever could, and, frankly, Steve can't find it in himself to mind.
he says, giving the sign and then finger spelling it. Her eyes go wide, and before she can sign anything else, Steve snaps his fingers into position.
Rhodes rolls his eyes, ruffling Tony's hair. "It's not all fun and games, Stark. You want to keep him, you gotta be a lot more thoughtful than you've been before." He leans in, whispering something to Tony that has him straightening the way Steve just had.
In the end, it's a combination of one of Clint's arrows and Tony's ability to program on the fly that gets them out of the whole mess. It's Nat's cunning and Bruce's strength that gets them through in one piece. And, not for the first time since this whole thing started, Steve finds himself wondering what exactly his role on the team actually is. It's not that he isn't sure that the team wants him around. He is. He just also isn't completely sure
It's not that Steve's never noticed Tony's hands before. He has. Covered in oil or dirt or blood, Steve's spent hours watching the way Tony's hands work. Tony's always been handy, and Steve knows that better than most. He's spent days down in Tony's lab watching him work on the suits and the team's gear. He's learned more about car maintenance and the best way to solder together Nat's Widow Bites and the tension and flexion Tony puts into Clint's arrows than he ever needed to know. Steve knows the bend and flex of Tony's wrist and the delicate, powerful arch of his fingers.  Steve knows Tony as intimately as he is allowed, and that has always had to be enough.
"Obvious, isn't it?" Steve winces empathetically at the way everyone in the room flinches away from him. Hard to modulate his volume when he can't hear himself. "The monkeys took our senses. My hearing for sure, and from the way Rhodes hasn't moved since we got here I'd guess they took his sight. And Tony—"
At some point Tony and Rhodes switch to running a series of tests of some sort, clearly intended to try to find a scientific cure. Steve chuckles when he realizes what's going on; it's just like Tony not to want to wait for someone else to solve the problem. If the pair of them notice the laugh, they make no sign of it, both so engrossed in what they're doing. For now, Steve is perfectly content to sit and observe, letting the pair of them have whatever time they need.
Steve cuts himself off before he can get any further, unwilling to let her see through him any further.
Clint stops pacing and whips his head around to face Steve. Bruce and Doctor Cho both turn to him as well, and Steve can tell that they think he was laughing at something one of them said rather than at a particularly funny thought. He waves them off. He sees Bruce's lips move, but he still can't hear anything. He thinks he can make out a few of the words, but nothing that's enough to be able to respond. Bruce sighs and turns to grab something off the table beside him. He scribbles a few words on Doctor Cho's pad and hands it to Steve.
Steve lifts the mug a little higher to hide his line of sight to her. She doesn't push it aside, but when he lowers it to look at her again, her eyes are still piercing and knowing on his.
"It is too a big deal! It was one thing when I was just sitting around wanting you like a lovesick idiot, it's another when you're my—" Tony stops short there, his body going stiff in Steve's arms.
Tony inhales sharply against him before pressing his lips more firmly against Steve's. Steve answers in kind, lips moving and working against Tony's with a gentle pressure. It's warm and soft in a way that Steve would never have thought his first kiss with Tony would be. If he'd thought of it, he'd have expected it to come from frustration, from ache and pain and rage the way so many of the revelations of their friendship have come. Instead it has come in the kind of quiet moment that they so rarely have.
It's ten days into the ordeal before the first big Avengers call comes in. Steve's itching for some action, but he also knows he'd be more of a liability than an asset with his hearing still compromised. He and Tony and Rhodes all stay behind, Steve keeping up a running litany of what he's seeing on Tony's many, many screens devoted to the cameras lining the team's uniforms for Rhodes' benefit, Tony signing everything that's coming through on coms for Steve's. Steve's not used to being the one that's benched, and watching his team fight their way through three dozen hive mind connected robots is not how he'd wanted to spend his Saturday. More than once Tony has Steve relaying information to the team over coms, and though Steve never hears the team's response, Tony always relaxes a little after Steve's passed on the messages.
When Steve looks up again to find Tony, he's sitting on the table in front of Steve, staring down at the contents of his sketchbook. The moment his hands still, Tony looks up at him, looking caught out. He lifts his hands and signs a quick
Steve sets up shop in Tony's workshop the next day, watching in silence as he works. Tony knows he's here, but he hasn't acknowledged him. It's almost as if he's more comfortable moving in his space with Steve there. As if there is nothing he wants more than to work under Steve's watchful eye.
Steve takes a chance and releases Tony's wrist to bring his other hand up to cup Tony's face between both of them. Tony's eyes go even wider, staring up at Steve with wonder and hope and something like desperation in his features. Steve almost can't believe what he's about to do, the chance he's about to take. But this is Tony, and there's nothing he wouldn't do to reassure Tony that he is loved and wanted and valued.
Tony's eyes go wide. He reaches out a hand toward Steve's sketchbook, pulling it back a moment later.
over his shoulder at Clint who signs back at them sharply and too fast for Steve to catch. Tony responds just as sharply and then the two of them are off in an argument that has Steve chuckling at the pair of them. Tony whips around to glare at him, but Steve just shrugs at him in turn. They follow the rest of the team to the jet that will take them back to the Tower. Tony elects to join them in the jet rather than fly on his own. Steve doesn't question it. He's rattled enough that he's grateful to have Tony so close. He catches himself glancing over at Tony repeatedly throughout the ride home. The sight of him there, whole and alive is a tether to reality in the resounding silence that echoes in his ears.
Steve's breath catches. Something warm and wanting curls in his stomach, a feeling that only Tony has ever been able to inspire in him. He pulls Tony in closer, pressing their bodies flush so he can—
Steve throws his head back and laughs at that. Tony's called it that before, but never in ASL, and he can't help finding the way he translated it a hell of a lot more entertaining than the English counterpart.
Something pulls in Steve's stomach at the possessive, but he pushes it down, too busy focusing on the way Tony smiles and moves, the parts of him that he's come to know so well over these past few weeks. He reaches out without thinking, wrapping a hand around Tony's waist and pulling him in close.
Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony, sharp and decisive. Tony stares up at him plaintively, but Steve doesn't back down. Tony throws a casual
Steve turns away and heads over to the couch in the corner that has long since been dubbed as his. He flips his sketchbook open and turns to a blank page. He glances up at Tony and Rhodes, letting his pencil start to sketch the easy arc of Tony's hands and the attentiveness in the way Rhodes watches him. Steve wouldn't be surprised if Rhodes has half a dozen signs learned before this whole ordeal is over. There's fluency and ease in the way Tony signs, but Steve doesn't let himself look too closely at the signs themselves. That's a conversation for the two of them, and Steve won't intrude on it.
Steve sits on the exam table, watching the team move around him in varying degrees of concern. Nat is standing by the door in a way that Steve knows is carefully manufactured to look stoic. Clint is pacing, his arms crossed and a furrow on his brow, and Bruce is looking at Doctor Cho intently. As for the three of them that are affected, Steve has already figured what's going on. The fact that they were fighting monkeys had made it a damn sight easier to figure out.
Rhodes waves him off. "Just don't make him cry and we'll be fine, Rogers." Tony squawks, but before he can pull away, Rhodes tightens his hold on Tony's shoulders. "You got that?"
He keeps his eyes open as he leans in, making sure that Tony is receptive. The moment Tony's eyelids flutter closed, Steve lets him do the same. Then he's brushing his lips against Tony's, marking him the way Steve's always wanted to.
Tony pulls back, a blissful smile on his lips. When his eyes open again, he's searching Steve's for something. Whatever it is, he must find it, because his face is still warm and open as he pulls back far enough to sign to Steve.
Except a large armored suited team mate hovered over him. The glint of the metal almost blinding in the sunlight. Steve stopped and squinted up at the armor. The faceplate retracted, and Tony said, “Jesus, Steve, what the hell are you doing?”
Tony grunts out something completely unintelligible, but his grip on their cocks tightens and he strokes with a purpose and intent. His eyes never leave Steve’s and he’s hot over Steve like a furnace, like the flames of hell itself and Steve’s doesn’t care. He wants only to feel this, to burn with it and he’s thrusting into Tony’s hand stroke for stroke. Somehow Tony brings his other hand around and cups Steve’s sac and he nearly explodes right then.
Unlike reality, Steve responded to the invitation with a smile, placing the pad and pencil on the floor, and then padded over to the bed. He wore only sleeping pants, his chest naked and warm to the touch.
When he wakes in his bed at his estate, Tony pants through the last of a nightmare. He runs a hand through his sweaty hair and tries not to shiver. What the hell was that, anyhow? Large invasion forces arriving in huge ships to deliver a Titan to threaten them all. He’s been reading too many fantasies lately. He groans as he blinks away the last vestiges of the memory of the dream. Except it didn’t feel like a dream at all. He flails in the overlarge bed, realizing for the first time he’s not in his own bed. He’s in his main presentation suite in his mansion on the Stark Family estate of the Council World. He fans out his arms and notes there’s no one in bed with him and then he peers down onto the floor to see his omega exactly where he left him last night.
Tony whistles, gets a tin cup, fills it and brings it back to Steve. He half sits on a stool. “I don’t want to surprise you or anything. But I think I might be going insane. Right now, see, I think you’re actually talking to someone I cannot see. I would say you were crazy, but then I’m the one that just interacted with one of your hallucinations.”
“Stay down, you imbecile,” Estane snaps and the dim lights catch the glint of the collar around Steven’s neck. “Oh, you did use the collar like I taught you to.” Estane turns back to Tony. “Activate it.”
“Does it matter?” Pep says. “Do you want him to love you or to be loyal to you?” Pep stops and then adds, “From what I’ve learned, what the society says love between an alpha and an omega is doomed. Loyalty is what you’re after.”
He smiles and then turns back to the situation at hand. His expression drops as he considers the omega. He wishes this didn’t have to be forced. Crossing the small space, he hovers close to the man. “This doesn’t have to be hard. I understand since you woke from stasis, you’ve been used and abused. Probably worse than I could imagine. I’d like to start out our bond – well, I’d like us to be friends.”
Steve only lifted a shoulder. “I seem to be making up for lost time.” That sent Tony into hysterics. Steve rolled his eyes. “It’s not funny.” Tony attempted to speak but laughter controlled him. “Not even that funny.” Tony shook his head and wiped away the tears.
Steve curls his hand between them, capturing his erection and stroking it, pushing it through his hand wet with Tony’s own precome. Tony arches up and into it. It’s more than he can bear. His hyper awareness of touch overwhelms. The sensation grips him and he bucks again and that’s all it takes. Steve’s motion becomes erratic and then he’s shoving hard and fast into Tony, the sounds are raw and yearning. He stutters to a stop and comes. The final jerk of his hand sends Tony over the edge as well and he blanks out, his shadowy vision white and then suddenly so black.
“Yes, anything, anything. Just fucking touch me.” Tony swears under his breath. He’s a slut for Steve, he wants everything Steve gives him and more. He would do anything for him. “Please.”
“What’s your name?” He searches for any semblance of self-care at all in the man. He finds none. The way he eats is mechanical, the way he sits hunched over, pained from the cage, and somehow is sullen and hopeless. Any other sub-omega would be writhing in pleasurable pain.
She left him then in the strangely stripped down Helicarrier. His mind spun, and dizziness threatened. Easing back into the thin pillow, Steve steadied himself, but his unsettled nerves pulsed and jittered. What Natasha had told him meant nothing and everything to him. In many ways, it frightened him. Grasping how it affected his life felt more like he’d caught a tiger by the tail. Any minute it would snap at him, biting away at him, devouring his hopes and dreams.
He finds the first one in the kitchen, hanging on the wall as if it’s been there the entire time he’s housed the Avengers. Standing by the coffee maker, dull and sleepy, he looks up and there it is – a painting. He furrows his brows and rubs at his beard. The painting is nothing special. It is just a painting of some trees, a few mountains in the background, and wispy clouds. He walks around the counter and places himself in front of the painting figuring it is small only about a half meter in width and a little over that in length. He can still smell the wet oil from it.
“We’re trying to give him pain meds but he’s a little out of control right now. I was coming out to ask for assistance in keeping him immobile,” the nurse said – Tony noticed her name tag said Cathy. “We’re calling in experts as well to help with the neurological pain.”
Without turning around, Steve manages to get his assigned quarters with Tony right at his heels. Of course, there’s no slamming the door in his face even if the door actually hinged like a normal fucking door.
Bruce screws up his face and he looks a little like he’s sucking on a lemon. “What about-.” He spins on his heels. “I don’t know a lot about it, but I was reading in Scientific America-.”
The thought of the blood pledge, the barbaric ritual, rankles him. Even though Tony defers to the logic of biology, he doesn’t believe in some of the practices of society. Tony grimaces at the man and Pep interjects because she knows the hint of frustration and anger heating his expression. “That is not your business. Officer?”
Steve bites back his response. Telling his boss that he finds him attractive and intriguing will just set him back to square one or even throw him out. “Thank you. I really do appreciate it.”
Tony scrambles to the fallen man, searches around his pants that are tangling his legs. He finds a key ring and brings it over to Steve. With a quick release, Steve’s free. He rubs at his wrists and slowly gets his pants back on.
The Red Knight drops down from his unheavenly perch in the skies. The Outriders shuffle and move aside for him. He wears a red helmet that covers his hideous face. Gold and red metallic accents flicker in the harsh light of the Realm. His chest plate glows blue.
Still, Steve has much to learn about his charge this week – that’s how he thought of the prince. Not in a patronizing way but more in the way that he’s here to ensure Tony is taken care of during the strenuous talks about the war. If there’s something that Steve can do for the war effort, it’s take care of one of the most powerful princes in the Conclave.
“Activate it or I will kill him,” Estane says. “This is your one chance to keep him alive. Otherwise I will kill him right here. I will gut him and I will make you eat his entrails.”
This, this man is his heaven and he will surely succumb to the flames to be with him. His heart ricochets in his chest like echoes in a corridor. Tony rubs his hands through Steve’s hair, grinding his hips in short jerks as Steve works.
“But you’re remembering little by little, right?” Steve had said, assured that his supposition was correct. It hadn’t been. When Tony looked up at him, his eyes wet and lost, Steve knew the truth. “You don’t remember.”
Tony settles back on the lounger with his coffee and tablet. He focuses on his emails – which are numerous and painful. He knows he’s missing important R&D sessions at Stark Industries, but they can and should be able to function fully without him all the time. He sends a few curt emails to his second in command at the R&D department. Then he’s back to answering emails for Pepper. Those are at least easier. When he looks up Steve’s gone, he must have snuck out to finish dinner a while ago. The sun sets and the room darkens. He places his tablet on the lounger and picks up the two empty mugs.
Tony ran around the corner into the wide open space of the prison vestibule with its tall girders and several poles and benches in the center. One of the poles had chains with manacles attached to it. The pole and the floor were streaked with rusted stains. He swallowed hard and said, “Stop. Rumlow. Stop. Captain Rogers, I’m Tony Stark. I’m here to help you.”
The questions batter him and Tony watches as his shoulders slump and exhaustion overcomes Steve. “I just don’t know. All I know is that there was something beyond my understanding to the tesseract. It controlled space but it also seemed linked to other elements of the universe. Like a door way through to other places, other possibilities. I really can’t tell.” A heavy breath escapes him, and he pushes back onto the bed. “I died. I came back time and again as a lion. I thought I was cursed.”
If he cuts the entire thing out, he’ll never go into heat again, never bond again, never want anyone ever again. He flexes his hands, itching for a knife. If it’s the only way, he’ll do it.  That will be the end of it, he’ll no longer ache for the knot, for the heat, for Tony.
“Marissa, we were looking for you. The next stage of the project is ready to go. We’d like you to be the one to initiate it,” Stane had said and then turned to Tony. “There’s my boy. How’s everything going?”
Smiling, Steve notices the glint of Tony’s ring against his own. He’s glad they finally did it, though it had never been something he needed to know that Tony is his and he is Tony’s. It was an event and Steve had to deal with the craziness of the paparazzi. He’s still not as good as Tony is with it. Even blind, Tony can flash a smile and the room wilts in his stead. Steve always feels awkward with no idea what to do with his hands. He feels like a big ape most of the time, especially since he no longer plays the part of Tony’s Personal Assistant. Which reminds him, Clint will be here any minute, looking to help Tony get ready for his appointment.
Later that summer, he learned that there had been an accident in the bio-division. Marissa had been the only fatality. He stood outside of the building at the picnic table and thought about how Marissa cried and he’d done nothing. He was no one’s hero. He was twelve. He looked up at the building. They’d said the accident had been her fault, but Stark Industries still paid a handsome settlement to the family for their loss. At the time, he figured it was a good thing. SI hadn’t held her responsible for the destruction of the lab.
“No, I’m just a realist in some situations,” Tony says and indicates a narrowing of the banks up stream in the river. “There? To cross?”
Not being in a position to shrug, Steve only flicked an eyebrow at Sam and then said, “Need to clear my mind.”
When Steve finally emerged like a deep sea diver breaking the surface, he embraced Tony without a word. Tears stained his cheeks, and when Tony saw it, he realized tears wet his own face. To have Steve surrender to him, to have Steve be grateful for it, to have Steve at his mercy so willingly beat every doubt and fear out of his head. For years he had thought his Dominant nature a liability, problem, a weakness. But yet, within the sphere of his relationship with Steve, Tony discovered the strength, power, and humility of it.
“Do it? You mean have sex with a lot of people I don’t know or have one day a week off. I bet you don’t get much time off from the frontlines.” As Steve talks he notices the streak of discomfort ruin Tony’s expression. “I didn’t think this would be who I was when I was younger. I wanted to be an artist, like I told you. Being a sex worker, while it’s not what I dreamed of – I can make people happy if only for a little time.”
Pepper tugs Tony away but with a kind and apologetic smile to Steve. Rhodes clasps Steve’s bicep and leads him back to his table. Before they get to the table, Steve hears a familiar voice and a quick grab of his hand stops them. Thor sits at a table with an older gentleman and lady. Jane is there with Val.
Tony hisses at him and, with an acidic look thrown over his shoulder, he says, “Get some rest, you look like shit.” He leaves and settles on a small stool next to the work bench. He flips through a number of papers, hunched over the drawings. Steve notices the slight trembling in his hands, the sweat beading on his forehead. He says nothing.
“I don’t know how, I don’t know what you want me to do,” Steve replies and rubs Tony’s chest, hoping to God he doesn’t have to do what Tony is inferring. What is he inferring? How the hell would he ever be able to do this?”
He’d walked into the bedroom at around ten at night. He must have fallen asleep, had a helluva dream, and did not climax though it felt like the best one he had in his life. Finally, the dizziness resolved and he stumbled to the bathroom, blinking at the bright lights enough that he asked JARVIS to dim them. Maybe he just drank too much. He remembered drinking a little last night. But shit, it wasn’t that much. He’s not a light weight in that department.
“My mom was kind of an artistic type,” Tony says. “Hence the Maria Stark Foundation. She had a degree in Art History, lived in Paris until my dad stole her away from all of that.”
Well, these days you have to know both styles. Hand drawn and digital. I worked for an independent comic book company until they went out of business. But I do freelance a bit.”
When Clint approached him, Steve wanted to condemn him. Yet, the wrecked look in his eyes, the way his mouth turned down, and the sallowness of his face wiped away Steve’s conviction. With a soft voice, Clint whispered to Steve, “I’m sorry.”
Like now. Now, Tony usually crawled up the length of Steve’s body, kissing him as he went. Steve liked the full-body contact, and usually Tony gave it to him, but not tonight. Tonight, he trailed a finger--one lone finger--over the peaks and valleys of Steve’s skin instead. He started at his toes, moved over his calf muscle, his knee, his hip. Steve jerked as Tony’s finger dipped into his belly button, then traced over the contours of his abs, spending more time there than anywhere, outlining every single groove of his six-pack.
And Tony heard it too. One eyebrow arched up in an unspoken question, even as his eyes widened in brief surprise. “Really?” he asked, and eased closer, leaning against the bar, close enough that Steve could almost smell the heat between them. No, it hadn’t dimmed. It was still there. Still present and accounted for. “What were you doing then?”
He stopped in the bathroom, thought about showering, then thought again. He needed to see Tony. He needed to see him right now. He could still hold onto his sanity if he didn’t shower right this second. He wasn’t sure if the same could be said if he didn’t see Tony.
When he woke up the second time, it was to a weight on his chest. Heavy, but not too heavy. Just the right amount of heavy. The perfect amount of heavy. And the heavy was moving just a little. Breathing. Touching him. A hand scratching short nails lightly over his sides, his chest, his throat. Just soft little touches. He shivered and the heavy laughed quietly.
“Forest fires are depressing too. If you think about it and don’t just use it as a metaphor for sex.”
He didn’t get undressed. He just climbed into bed in his t-shirt and dress-pants. He was pretty sure Tom Ford wouldn’t approve of this treatment, but he wasn’t here. He didn’t know the situation, so fuck him too.
Once, Tony had been outside when she came back, and Jarvis had lifted him up onto the horse to sit in front of his mother in the saddle while she trotted him around the yard a couple of times.  When she was done, she rode back over to where Jarvis stood, and Tony had slipped down into his waiting arms.  It had been a good moment, a great moment, really, being passed back and forth between the two people he loved and trusted most, everyone smiling, everyone happy, no Howard there to ruin it.
Tony shook his head, wishing to Christ he’d paid more attention to his German at school.  As it was, he was pretty sure Steve had just called him a pig.
“I came down to see what you’d done to the Charger.  The ‘Cuda turned out so good, I wanted to see how it looked.”
“Good,” Howard said, and put his hand briefly on the back of Tony’s neck. “We’ve missed you back home, son. Everybody’s missed you.”
Cold, coiled rage flared in Steve’s chest.  He didn’t try to hold it back.  He couldn’t have if he’d tried.
, Tony thought, and it wasn’t a flippant, throwaway threat. It was a clinical, methodical thought-process.
“I want to,” he said. “I want to do...all those things. Those other things you said. I want to do them too.”
Tony pulled back a little, staying just out of reach of Steve’s questing lips.  “Am I forgiven?” he asked, then teased Steve’s lower lip with a flick of his tongue.
He woke up again at seven.  He’d left the bedroom door open, and this time, when he looked out, Steve was gone.  Tony panicked only for a moment, though.  His jacket was still hanging on the back of a kitchen chair.  His ruck-sack still sat by the door.  He hadn’t gone far, then.
Tony would never say something that was not the truth. Especially when they were like this. Alone together like this. Here there were no lies. Here they were immune to anything like that. Anything that might harm them. Here--alone, just the two of them--was their safe space. Their sanctuary. That was what Steve believed, anyway, and he prayed Tony felt the same way.
“But I’m not your son anymore. We’re not family. You’re my boss, I’m your employee. We have no personal relationship beyond work. Agreed?”
Tony gazed at him, fingers clenched in his hair, pulling it just right, just enough to send sharp thrills of sensation through him.
Steve’s eyelids fluttered and he writhed on the ground.  More blood flowed.  Nat pressed a hand against the gash, trying to staunch the flow, and Steve cried out.  His fingers scrabbled on the grass, pulling out double handfuls.  Under his breath, a guttural sound escaped his lips.
Tony guided the car to his old spot in front of Steve’s building. He shut it off. “We’re here,” he said. His voice had lost that cold sound. Now it was just quiet. Just sad.
He rubbed his cheek against her shoulder a bit restlessly and shifted against her. “I wish I could have known
Steve had said, he hadn’t hurt him, but Tony had heard the lie in his voice, and could see the truth in the droop of his shoulders, the red-rimmed eyes.
He’d been sitting here for a while now. Just sitting. Not thinking. Not dwelling on the fact that the folder filled with papers over there signalled the end of his marriage. Not dwelling on the fact that all of his shit was sitting boxed up in the front foyer waiting for tomorrow morning and the slew of movers who were coming to truck it away to a storage unit. Not dwelling on the fact that his daughter wasn’t here with him right now, and that was good, because if she had been, he would have had to put on a happy face to
Steve laughed. “They’re Sam’s. He’s left so much shit over here, he practically has his own drawer.”
It didn’t last long. Not really. Just a second. Just a lifetime. Just long enough for Steve to think that maybe the world wasn’t crumbling away after all. No, the world wasn’t going anywhere. Uh-uh. Not
Oh, he’d talked to it, alright.  When it reached out from under the couch and hooked its claws into Steve’s bare feet, he talked.  When it bit his hand when he put its food dish on the floor, he’d talked.  When it hissed at him every time he came into a room, he talked.  He never yelled.  He
Rhodes watches him for a moment longer, shifting Tony seamlessly into a headlock as he squirms. When he's satisfied, he nods. "See to it." Then he hauls Tony up so they're facing each other. "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."
Bruce touches his elbow. "Are you okay?" He mouths the words slowly enough that Steve catches them. He shrugs, struggling to keep his eyes off of Tony and Clint in the corner. There isn't really anything he can say that will encompass the worry and contentment mixing in equal measures in his chest. Bruce seems to understand, though. He pats Steve on the arm and gets to his feet to confer with Nat. Steve lets himself watch over them for a brief moment before turning back to Tony and Clint, doing his best to stop the storm he can see brewing over there. It's in the lines of Tony's face and the sweep of his hands as he signs to Clint. Still, Steve can't be bothered to tear his eyes away from Tony and all his brilliance when he himself is struggling to hang onto the reality of what's happening.
Tony signs. Steve can tell he's not as certain as he might have been able to pretend to be if he'd had his voice. Tony's always hidden behind a smile and a quip, but he can't seem to translate them as well into ASL as he can roll them off his tongue in English.
Tony pulls back too soon. He looks up at Steve with wide, bright eyes that make it clear that he's not sure what to think. Endeared, Steve leans in to kiss the corner of Tony's lips before he can think better of it. When he pulls back, Tony sways into his space, his eyes closed when Steve finally gets a look at them. Steve strokes his thumbs across Tony's cheeks, urging him closer. Urging him into Steve's space. Tony goes willingly, and it's all Steve can do to keep his features calm. He rubs his nose against Tony's, a gesture that Tony returns in kind. There's a deep abiding trust here that Steve can't help but revel in. This is them, made one in a way that he'd never have thought possible, and it means a damn sight more than he can say with words.
"Damn right you will! Don't let that boy toy of yours wear you out too much." Tony squawks at that, but Steve can only bury his face in Tony's shoulder, shoulders shaking with laughter.
Steve stares at her as she saunters toward the elevator. Tony's laughs sound slightly hysterical where he's pressing them into Steve's chest, but that somehow feels less important than whatever's on Nat's phone. Before he can pull away to see, though, Tony tightens his grip around Steve's waist.
"He's saying something about a party he threw at MIT, Rhodes, says it was better than any party you ever could have—"
He may not be able to hear anything right now, but that doesn't mean he can't take out some of these damn monkeys himself.
Tony's eyes widen a fraction, just enough that Steve can tell that that's what's happening. Steve doesn't realize that he knows what Tony's about to do until he's getting to his feet and reaching out to clasp a hand around Tony's wrist and hold him back from darting away. Tony looks up at him, eyes wide as he stares up at Steve. Steve stares at him, trying to parse what's going on in Tony's head. He can see the fear, the apprehension, and, somewhere deep down, that hint of hope. Steve reaches his free hand up slowly, telegraphing his movements before he lets his hand rest against Tony's jaw. Tony leans into him, eyes still wide, but arm a little less tense in Steve's grasp.
He knows Tony can see through Steve just as easily as Steve can see through him, but he can't deny that making the effort for Tony alleviates at least some of the ache in his chest. If he can't pretend for himself, at least he can pretend for Tony.
Steve reaches for his mug, keeping one eye on Natasha as he drinks. She gives him a full three minutes before she starts to question him.
There's no ringing in Steve's ears when he comes around. He shakes his head and winces at the way it rattles his brain in his skull. There's pain there, an ache under his skin that has him worried for his companions. He gets to his feet, unaware that anything is wrong until he starts shouting for Tony and Rhodes to get back in the air. The second Tony's field name slips past his lips, he knows something's wrong. He reaches for his throat. His heart is beating a sharp rhythm in his jugular as his strategist's brain works overtime. He calls out for Nat who turns to look at him. It confirms the suspicion in his chest. He closes his eyes for the briefest of moments before shaking his head at her. Her eyes go wide with understanding and she turns away. He can see her hand come up to her ear and can imagine her shouting into the coms, taking charge immediately. As she does, Steve turns to his own set of problems.
Tony reaches out again, but not for the sketchbook this time. He slides his fingers under Steve's chin, turning him toward Tony and tipping his chin up. He pulls away only to sign at him.
He reaches for his sketchbook, opening it up to a blank page. He spends the better part of two hours sketching DUM-E and the other robots, trying not to let his attention stray to Tony too often. He does glance over plenty, though, unable to keep his eyes away for too long. Eventually sharp angles turn to gentler arcs, sharp lines to smoother curves, DUM-E to Tony in all his glory. It's not that it's never happened before, it's that this is the first time it's felt this inexorable, this impossible to resist. Tony's been everything for so long, it's just never felt this obvious before.
Rhodes makes eye contact with him once more, a pointed reminder of the words he'd said earlier, before he glances over at Nat and tosses a wave in her direction. "Try to make sure these two knuckleheads stay out of trouble, hmm?"
For his part, Steve isn't nearly as fluent in ASL as even Tony is. Tony, who had taken to it like a fish to water and let the language flow seamlessly into his existence as though there had never been anything else. It leaves Steve wondering how Tony's tongue would sound wrapped around French's syllibiance, pressed into German's rough consonance, languishing in the perfectly shaped syllables of Japanese. Leaves him wondering just how many languages Tony speaks and just how well.
Natasha goes on staring into his eyes, as though looking for other unknown secrets that he might be keeping from her. Then she settles back into her chair.
Every time the urge hits him, he bows his head to his sketchbook and tries to capture the warmth and light that is Tony on the page.
Steve grabs his mug again, lifting it to his lips and turning away from Natasha. She does push it aside this time, meeting his eyes head-on.
Rhodes claps him on the back, his eyes locked on Steve, assessing him. "Yeah, I know, buddy, Still doesn't mean I wanna open my eyes to you making out with your man over there."
Everyone but Tony is staring at Steve in varying degrees of surprise. For his part, Tony has his arms crossed over his chest, a triumphant smirk in place on his lips. Steve grins back at him, trying not to look too lovesick. Bruce turns back to Doctor Cho and Steve takes that as a dismissal. There's not much he can do here, at least when it comes to solving their conundrum. Rather than try, he fumbles in his pocket and pulls out his phone. It's a matter of moments to pull up a course on ASL, mute the videos, and start watching.
Steve turns Tony in his arms, leaning in to kiss him soundly. "I do, Tony. So much more than I can say. I want to be yours. And I want you to be mine."
Steve tilts his head to the side, wondering at the way Tony's hands had stuttered over his name. Steve couldn't quite catch what he'd been going to say instead, but that didn't seem to matter in the end. He'd seen the slip, and Tony knew he'd seen the slip, and Tony is going to run if Steve doesn't deflect in time.
They finish their drinks with their hands wrapped firmly around their mugs, pointedly not speaking as they take their time. Eventually Steve can't avoid this any longer and he gets to his feet, ready to head back to his floor. Natasha surges to her feet beside him, hands coming up as though to sign something to him only to stop short before they can form anything more than the beginning of his callsign. Steve smiles, small and bleak and tries not to let her hesitation get to him. Her face tightens and she starts signing, confidence and poise restored.
"If you want to be." Tony speaks quickly enough that Steve can tell that he doesn't think Steve does want him. That can't stand.
Steve can hear the seriousness under the teasing tone, and stands up a little straighter. "Of course."
"Steve?" Tony's voice is hoarse from disuse, but Steve doesn't give a damn. It's the most beautiful thing he's heard in weeks. He looks up at Tony, heart in his throat as he tries to find the words.
Tony grabs Steve by the collar, hauling him in and kissing him senseless. Steve laughs against his lips, wishing he could hear if the breath Tony lets out against his in return is a laugh or a sigh. The silence isn't as cloying as it had been at the beginning, but Steve still finds himself missing his hearing every now and again. Maybe now more than ever as he realizes that he may never hear Tony's voice again if the team can't find a cure. It's an overdramatic thought, to be sure, but he lets himself think it just long enough for it to be real. He leans in closer against Tony, reveling in the warmth of his body. And if he can't help but laugh when Tony gropes his ass through his jeans, well, that's no one's business but theirs.
Steve sees the words Tony isn't speaking in the lines of his face. Has Tony's face always been this expressive? Steve can't honestly say. For all that he's spent hours watching Tony and learning his every move, he's also been drawn in by Tony's flashy words. Anything to draw attention away from who Tony really is. Who he is down to his core. Steve's fallen into those traps before, letting Tony throw him off the scent of an injury or weakness until Steve catches on to what he'd done. Usually it's too late to do anything to help, and it rankles, but Steve's been putting on a brave face for his team since before his current teammates were born. He knows his role, his purpose, and he'll fulfill it to the best of his ability.
He doesn't catch what Clint says when he and Tony make their way out of Medical signing at one another, but he does see the sharp insult Tony directs at Clint.
The place is almost as sparse as his, but in a less military way. There's something here that speaks to years of privacy and caution. It tightens something in his chest, weighing him down as though to pull him under; Natasha's made a life that works for her despite all the pain and trauma she's faced, and Steve… here Steve is worrying about his place in his team-slash-family. He settles down on the couch in her living room, thighs spread and hands clasped between his knees. He can't hear Natasha moving around in the kitchen behind him but he can imagine that's what she's doing. He wets his lips, parting them as though to speak. He stops short, though, when it occurs to him that he'll have to wait for her to come over to the living room before he'll be able to see her response. So he waits.
Steve blinks, his mind trying to catch up with the implication. When it does, it's all he can do to grin goofily down at Tony. "Yeah?"
"That's a full-time job," Nat says with a roll of her eyes, "and I already have one of those. But I'll see what I can do."
Tony grins, though Steve can see from the look in his eyes that, if he had his voice, he'd be laughing his ass off. Steve just smiles back at him, chest warm with the kind of affection that Tony always brings about in him.
Rhodes laughs as he pulls away, shoving at Tony lightly. "Don't think I won't, oh billionaire genius of mine."
Steve swallows, setting his pencil down slowly for an excuse to gather his racing thoughts and calm his pounding heart. He doesn't take his eyes off of Tony's, unable to break that warm gaze. Once his hands are free and he can no longer delay his response, he lifts his hands.
Steve watches Tony's face as well as his hands when he signs, which is why he sees the flash of vulnerability there. Steve shakes his head.
Tony squirms, but doesn't make a concerted effort to get away. "It was nothing Steve. Just forget about it."
Tony inhales sharply, leaning in to kiss Steve again. When he pulls back, he closes his eyes and leans his forehead against Steve's. "Steve, I…"
have to make this the first thing I see after almost a month without being able to see a damn thing?"
Nat's eyes go wide, and Steve knows she knows. He's already on his feet, turning toward Tony when she whispers, "Steve?"
Steve rolls his eyes, knowing that this is just Tony downplaying his genius the way he does when he's done something that really is for himself. He crosses the room, tapping Rhodes on the shoulder to make it clear that he and Tony aren't alone anymore. Rhodes tilts his head up toward him, looking somewhere to Steve's left. He sees Rhodes' lips shape his name. "Yeah," he says, trying to keep his voice low.
Rhodes nods and turns back towards Tony. Tony signs in his direction again, which has Steve wondering what's going on. Tony pauses briefly and Steve sees the way Rhodes cocks his head to the side. JARVIS, Steve realizes. This is why they came down here, why Tony programmed JARVIS to understand his signs first. It warms something in Steve's chest even as it leaves him feeling bereft in the silence of his world. He'd come down here in hopes of finding connection, camaraderie, but Rhodes and Tony have always been on a different level. Years of history will do that to a friendship. Steve rubs a hand over the center of his chest, the familiar ache of missing Bucky enough to pull him out of his reverie. He swallows, taking in the sight of the two of them together and immortalizing it in his mind. He may never be able to have what he wants with Tony, but maybe being here to experience his joy and comfort can be enough.
“Different functions?” Lord, he is going to be servicing more than the prince. He blanches. He’s not one for that kind of thing at all. “I’m not really – I don’t really want to service more than one person at a time.”
“More and you can get me to come,” Steve whines and jerks against Tony. The filling of his hole and the teasing of his nipples sends Steve into a rash of need. He grabs onto Tony’s hair as he bends to taste and nip. He jerks against Tony, trying to get the right feel against his prostate and he’s almost there, so wanting and needy but Tony stops and glances up at him. A strange and wicked look crosses his expression.
“Yes, well, not all of them turned out well,” Hill said and hit the screen again. “When SHIELD walked in and promised the country aid if they could set up a base, the corrupt government went for it.”
Tony shrugged as he went to put the dishes in the sink. “Like I said, it’s math to me. I just kind of follow it to its natural conclusion.”
When they stopped for gas, Bruce climbed in the back. He stayed there through the rest of the drive. Every now and again, Tony would hear a little burp or a slurp. How much blood Bruce downed, Tony didn’t want to know. Would they have enough once they got to the safe house. He would have to reach out to Pepper and ensure the place was fully stocked.
Steve breaks away first and says, “Okay. As I recall from my limited experience, I should prep you. Do you want to try it, or would you like something else?”
Steve scowls and yanks off the boots. “Just tell me one thing. Why did you make me get all dressed up in your uniform? Your uniform, your colors!
“Yes,” Tony says. “To the last. I’m not sure about the trust thing, yet. It’s hard to trust someone who hurts the person you love.”
“She gave me some meds, I’m not sure they’ll help,” Tony says and sets down the canvas bag the doctor had carried. He peers over his shoulder at the empty hall, toward the ghost of the doctor.  Turning back to Steve, he asks, “Do you know what’s spooked her? I mean what’s a Collapsing Event.”
“I need to get back to the discussion on strategy,” Steve said and placed a hand over his eyes. “’m just a little lightheaded. Have a headache, too.”
“Strangely empowering.” Tony stood up, and Steve thought it might be to put distance between them, but instead he reached for the room service menu. “On to dinner?”
What is that supposed to mean? Tony doesn’t ask, but steps closer. “Can you tell me if you’re hurt?”
Finally, courage swells through Tony and he slips one hand up to cup the back of Steve’s head and angle him more comfortable. He prods a little and suddenly, Steve opens his mouth and there’s a little moan, so quiet, so hushed that Tony barely registers it. It’s enough to urge him on, to buoy his hopes and he tastes and explores with more enthusiasm and less fear. Steve isn’t an active participate – Tony wouldn’t classify it that way at all. More of an interested bystander in his own life, but then he jolts in Tony’s arms and pulls away. He looks down and rubs at his mouth as if to clean away the foulness of the kiss.
The blood filled him with renewal. As it rejuvenated his tissues, it transformed him like a sacred rite, a baptism of rebirth. He shivered with the taste as his tongue began to sense again and his throat worked for more and more. He wanted it all. With all the blood, his vampire needs grew heavy in his mind with no other thoughts materializing. His mind and spirit sank into the purity of the taste, the tang and sweetness. It transformed him. It became him. He wanted only the blood and nothing else. He felt nothing else but its effects. It restored him down to his undead soul. The taste reminded him of love.
“Well, we’re not totally naked. And yes, I suppose so,” Steve said and smiled. He cupped Tony’s cheek and then kissed him fully and completely.
“Are they going to be okay?” Sam tightens his grip as he folds his arms around himself. He always used to do it as a child when frightened. His dad would softly pull his arms down and embrace him, hold him until the fear passed. Now, the fear rachets up.
They’re all holed up in Tony’s lab. Why he allowed furry guy to join them in the lab, he can’t really recall. The guy has information about Steve’s health, so it seems reasonable to invite him along. But it has been three days. So that’s four days of Steve asleep, which seems excessive to Tony, but the doctors can’t get him to wake but won’t count him as comatose now because none of his tests make a comatose state. Except the not waking up part. Tony thinks that should probably be part of the assessment.
Frank smirks and gazes back into the apartment for a long moment and something comes over his eyes and Tony can only call it hunger and rage at the same time. "Did what I paid to do."
Tony snickers and smiles up at Steve, who isn’t having any of his charm today. “You should be thankful for Clint. He’s a godsent.”
“Okay then. That’s new.” Tony edges closer and snatches a side panel of the armor, dragging it to him. It’s not the whole suit; Tony’s not sure why Blu dismantled it – or if he did it at all. But the chest piece, helmet and one arm are intact. “Let me see what I can do with this.”
Tony longed to say – what about us? Don’t you just want to explore this new thing. But Steve or rather Captain America had everything in order and his heart neatly placed aside – not mixing with business. So Tony forced himself to focus. “Our next move?” Tony felt like his words echoed in his head.
It was a subtle thing, nothing momentous, nothing too earth shattering. His hands warmed, and Steve knew to lay them down on Sam’s wrecked body. No wish or prayer came to his lips, just the truth of what should be. “Not today.”
“The twins,” Steve said and waited as if Tony should come to the same logical conclusion. When Tony stood there staring blankly at him, Steve relented. “Bucky must be in Europe. Don’t ask me how he got there but I’m getting a kind of old familiarity from him. Like he knows the places he’s hanging out, like he’s trying to find himself through walking places in his past.” He shrugged. “I’m not sure. But that’s what I’m getting. I think he feels the twins, more so than he does us. They’re on the same wavelength as he is. Fashioned by Hydra, but not bad. They aren’t bad people. I think he’s there to get them out. Same as us.”
“I’ll let Nat tell you about that little surprise. Did cause some issues with Bruce, but Thor showed up on time this morning to quiet things down,” Clint said. “You should have hitched a ride with him.”
“Thanks, I appreciate it.” Steve glides his hand carefully down the chest. It feels like a glove and, when he looks at himself in the bathroom full mirror, it doesn’t make him feel like he’s wearing his father’s suit. It’s made for him, and only him. It’s striking. He would have thought the red would wash out his skin or that it would emphasize his ruddy undertones but it’s a perfect shade for him and it’s the Stark colors. Steve smiles.
He leaned forward and pushed Steve back. “There will be time for that.” Steve huffed but then Tony touched him, circling his fingers as he did. Tensing, Steve gritted his teeth. “This is supposed to be fun. Not something you can’t stand.”
“Some is an accident. There may be some forced.” He followed Ross with his gaze as Pierce went to stand by the large windows. His expression was in silhouette. “But the majority of mated vampires are in strong, stable relationships, some say even more stable than human relationships. Mating actually takes away the threat to the rest of the human populace that you’re so worried about, sir.”
Stumbling to his knees next to Tony, he shoves the shirt away to look at the mess on Tony’s chest. It’s ugly and smells worse. He gags a little and then gets up to find some water. Luckily there’s a bucket near the work bench. It looks clean enough and he tastes a spoonful. There’s a distinct metallic taste to it, but otherwise he cannot detect anything overtly wrong with it.
The Silver Knight – Steve – shrugs his shoulders. “Even if I am – it’s better to have a name. For so long -- I was--- urchin child and --- when the Soul Keeper f-found me, be-become -Silver Knight. No-not a proper name, know that. No-no one from the Keep h-has - proper name. Only demons-.” His voice fails him, and he stops. He shouldn’t say it.
Tony glances over his shoulder at Steven. He’s doing his job, has performed admirably. Though Tony hates the thought of severe punishment he can see that it worked on Steven. “I’d like to agree with you. I really would, but it isn’t that easy.”
Tony wanted to know why. Had he been in an accident and a vampire turned him out of good will, or had it been a killing that turned into something more sinister. Before he mustered the courage to ask, the vampire pointed to the building behind them.
“You don’t have to check on me. I got Jarvis here. I’m doing fine, aren’t I?” Tony points to Jarvis who – from the clattering of the pans – is currently finishing up their meal at the stovetop.
After a protracted time that weighs on Steve’s shoulders harder and harsher than the clipped wing wounds along his back, Tony says, “I liked him. You know, he was a decent guy. He tried to save me. Put this battery to charge the magnet in my chest so the shrapnel won’t travel to my heart. He was a good man.”
“Where’s my lion?” She frantically looks around but Tony scoops it up from the floor and wiggles it at her. She giggles and grabs for it. They tussle for it until they hear from the doorway an obvious clearing of the throat to hurry them along.
Tony tilts his head up to the sky and gapes. “Look at it. Look at all the stars. It’s so-.” He falls silent and Steve notices they’re still holding hands. “The resolution never used to be this good. I can see individual stars. Finally. I can’t wait for morning. I’ll be able to see the leaves on the trees.” His voice cracks. Steve glances at Tony and, even in the sliver of moonlight, sees tears wet his cheeks. Something soft and abiding envelops Steve. Part of him wants to celebrate and the other part wants so desperately to protect Tony, to ensure he never has to experience pain again. That this can be his life – forever.
“He’s got the armor back. He’s building again. Everyone knows that now. He came for you in the armor.” Sam gestured to the boxes strewn across the living room. “Where are you going?”
Tony gripped onto the rail of the balcony, watching the lights, purple tinged with red, flutter through the night. Some called them wisps, others ghosts, still others theorized they were the souls of the dead that never transformed. “And Natasha? She’s much younger than you are.”
“No, we need to go alone on this one Sam,” Steve replied. He put his hand up and warded off any protestations. “I get that you want to help, but I’m not sure what we’re going to find, and we need someone one not connected to us on the outside that I can count on.”
Steve finishes his first loaf and bowl of stew. He goes back to the kitchen for more as he speaks, “No. I’m not. He propositioned me. Kissed me and stuck his hand down my pants.”
“My first order of business should be my appearance I assume since you mentioned clothes?” He stands. He needs to start getting ready if he only has a day to prepare.
Steve laid his head against the back of the elevator as the marks on his arm and chest burned. During his time as a SHIELD agent and leader of a dissembled pack, he learned as much as he could about the pack dynamics, but that was what his mother would call being ‘book smart’.  He needed to be more than smart about it. He needed to be tactical. That was his strength. Throughout the years of being pack leader, Steve tried to fish out the reason why some people bonded and others did not. He attempted to figure out why members were named certain roles. None of it made sense in the beginning and after so long, Steve was fairly certain it would never gel and mold into anything he could shape or understand. Why was Bruce Healer? Why was Tony Beloved? Steve closed his eyes; he did not need to go through that hell again, beating himself up for thoughts that swayed toward the deviant. Two years passed since the first bonding and the benefits of the pack eluded him.
“Then I see you again – now,” Logan hisses. “I thought you were dead and you turn up alive in New York. Shit, I didn’t think we would ever be together again. But damn, here we are.” He sits back and lets his head fall back so that he’s staring at the ceiling. “I had you for a while. I’m not going to lie to you.” Now he straightens and looks directly at Steve. “I love you. I would move the fucking world for you. I would stab Stark in the heart if I knew you would love me back. But I know – you would leave me anyhow. I’m escaping who I am – you – you’re always becoming who you are. You’re always building it, you embrace it. God, kid. I need you more than air.” He covers his face and for a long moment, Steve thinks he might be crying – slight tears. When he drops his hands, his eyes are dry but red. “You do this thing. Save yourself. Where ever you end up, you’re strong enough to build yourself up again.”
