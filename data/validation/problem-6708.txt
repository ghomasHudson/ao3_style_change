Of course, Steve had to go and be responsible. “What happened with Thanos?” he asked, looking round at the others. “Are the Infinity Stones secure?”
Tony raised his chin, focusing his own gaze on the wizard. “We find a way to destroy the Stones. Take them out of play, forever.” The Doctor frowned, uneasy but thoughtful.
The archer emerged from the trees nearby, and Tony paused, his instincts still at full alert. All of their previous expeditions had ended in frustration, disappointment. This energy felt different, confirmed when Barton almost smiled. Holy shit. “We found him, Tony,” Barton said.
“Queen of Wakanda,” he said softly, seriously, and the kid shut her eyes as if she had hoped to forget. Goddamn, he couldn’t not tell her either.
“Have you been loitering in here all day?” T’Challa asked, disapproving. “A great moment of history is happening just outside your door.”
Honestly, Tony had expected more of a fuss, but it seemed Steve understood. Maybe he heard it too, the empty waiting for her. Loud and lonely. The super-soldier blew out a breath, looked back at Nebula. “Two minutes,” he said, then ducked out of the hut. Uh. An abrupt goodbye, but efficient, Tony supposed.
Still, when Sam notices his wedding ring and gently prompts Steve to tell him about his wife, Steve is tempted to answer, if only to correct him.  Yet he knows the full story would take a long, long time and Steve is already aching to return to his real life, to the husband who is even now waiting for him to come home.
“Tony,” Steve says, almost a plea, and closes the door. The other man jerks at the sound, wild-eyed and unsteady, and Steve feels sick when he realizes that Tony is drunk out of his mind.
That evening, the Avengers held a full council of war on Tony’s behalf. Although Steve offered to keep it discreet, Tony had requested that the whole team be brought in, that they treat it as a mission like any other. When everyone had gathered, Tony revealed how Stone had recorded a series of compromising videos of him early in their relationship, using them to blackmail Tony into staying. Everyone worked hard to keep it professional, but later they all agreed that Tony’s debrief had been one of the most painful situations they’d ever endured. Even Wanda had cried.
“I’m not gonna lie. Yesterday was a tough day. Maybe the toughest,” he heard Steve say. So close. Now nothing but air. “If anyone needs more time, take it. But no matter the complications, our objective hasn’t changed. Starting today, we move forward.” Tony opened his eyes and watched faces as Steve stared around the group, making eye contact with everyone in turn. Their Captain. “You all know the plan. Let’s get to it.”
“Sleep well,” May told them all. When they had departed, she ordered a protesting Peter to the nearest couch and dropped a blanket over the sleepy teenager. The kid was snoring before she’d taken a single step away. She smiled down at him, then returned to where Tony stood by the door.
Afterwards, all Steve could remember of the battle was a series of crystalline moments, all else a blur in between.
Tony shrugged. “Oh, I’ll ask. Just wanna know how hard I should push if he won’t answer.” Shuri just raised an eyebrow, and Tony sighed. One possibility made more sense than the rest. “It’s his blood, right?” he said quietly.
There is a bunch of flowers already lying there. Roses, in every possible color. He stares, touches the petals. The thorns.
Upon their return to the Compound, it was agreed that Tony would send a cover message to Stone detailing how he’d left the hospital too soon, collapsed on the way home and was receiving emergency treatment at the Compound. Tony then spent the whole day in bed with Steve, each content just to hold the other close. This time the other man rested while Steve talked, racking his brain for stories from his childhood, both the good and the laughably bad.
Luckily Tony suffered from no such awkwardness, holding out his hand; Steve took it instantly, his heart humming at the contact, and he followed happily as Tony led him over to the table.
And the second wave of realization breaks over him, because no, this isn’t home, not yet, and Steve falls to his knees, unable to breathe. He is back, but that doesn’t mean... “Tony,” he gasps, tries to focus on the worried faces around him, picks out the one he needs. “Thor, quick. The BiFrost. I have to get to Titan.”
The birds were chirping loudly outside Stark tower, as soft sunlight streamed in through the full-length windows. For the first time in a long while, Tony had a dreamless night and a refreshing sleep. He turned around to face Steve, who was stirring awake next to him. Steve had an arm slung around Tony protectively, and it brought up feelings of love and excitement in Tony’s heart that he thought he was incapable of.
“I’m just going to put him in his room now,” Steve replied shortly, no other indications on what he thought about Tony’s sudden change in relationship status. Clint shrugged, and walked over to the entrance to Tony’s quarters, his arms crossed as he looked at Steve curiously.
“Then don’t,” Steve whispered against his lips. “Don’t escape. Just fall, for I will catch you. I promise.”
Tony wrapped his arms protectively around Steve’s small frame, and breathed in the scent of that shiny blond hair.
“Oh man, I forgot they were still here and they just had to listen as to how I had a crush on Petey. How very embarrassing,” Wade said to some invisible person. While he was still talking, Tony lunged at him, grabbing on to his arm with the tight grip of the gauntlet.
“It’s nothing much anymore, I’ll just see myself out. I hope everything goes well on the venture with Reed, I’m sorry I interrupted it,” Steve said evenly, hoping to mask his feelings until he could get to the gym and punch everything until he was feeling better. Fighting was much easier than feelings. He would rather face a hundred HYDRA agents than hear Tony say that they were merely colleagues.
“That’s right, darling. And such powerful little girls deserve pancakes! How about let’s go back in the house and ask Dad if he’s okay with giving you pancakes as a reward!” Tony smiled, and scooped her up with one hand before giving her a kiss on the forehead. Holding onto her waist with his other hand, he trudged up the steps into his cabin house situated in the woods next to a peaceful lake. The small cabin was nothing grand compared to his old Stark Tower decked with the best technology, an astounding architecture of both steel and glass, but he found this much cosier. He was probably at the best point in his life now – with the exception of Peter. Peter would be so happy if he knew he had a younger sister, Tony thought. He would be the most protective older brother ever, would probably spin her a hammock out of webbing, maybe even cradle her to sleep while studying for his final exams. Five years on, and Peter was still unforgettable. Steve was the one who suggested adopting another child to Tony – they had to move on with life after all, and they were sure that Peter would have wanted this too. Morgan was the next love of Tony’s life, and while he would give up anything for her, it couldn’t fill that part of his heart Peter took with him. Morgan was Morgan… and Peter was Peter. None of them could replace the other, and Steve probably felt that too.
Take now, for example. Even doing mundane repairs on the Mark VIII at half past two in the morning, something that should be easy for him to get lost in, Tony can’t settle into his work headspace. He almost burns his hand because he can’t stop remembering the way Rogers had looked at him, little flashes of blue eyes roaming over Tony’s face, taking in every detail—
Rogers turns to face him. His skin shines with a faint sheen of sweat, his greyish-white T-shirt sticking to his chest and his blond hair messy over his forehead. There’s a kind of flat, weary resignation on his face, the kind of tiredness that goes beyond physical, and his mouth flattens into a wary line when he sees Tony.
Eventually, he sets aside his sketchbook, rising and rolling his head from side to side to feel his neck pop. Tony looks up from his holograms, pausing with his hand inside what looks like a projected model of one of the Iron Man gauntlets. He waves his hand to make it disappear, turning fully to face Steve and leaning against the table. “You headed out, Rogers?” he asks, oddly hesitant.
Steve gives him a long look. “No,” he agrees eventually, voice calm. “It’s not.” Tony isn’t one to follow easily, and that used to aggravate him to no end. It often still does, but now, he’s growing used to it, learning to work with it—with
“You want to stop killing my punching bags, Cap? Not that they’re hard to replace—or that anyone other than you uses them, really—but it’s the principle of the thing.”
A pause, in which Tony’s mind whirls, running through scenarios and possible outcomes, potential responses to that question swirling in a mad jumble of images. Then Steve shakes his head again, and his fingers ball into fists, and his face crumples.
Tony rocks back on his heels, bites his lip and wishes he had something better to say. “G’night, Cap,” he says, and tries to pretend that
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’ve been doing better! I did everything you asked of me today, didn’t I? Oh, but something
Actually, he’s more pissed than anything. If they weren’t in the middle of a firefight, Tony would probably kick Clint’s ass for that comment. He still might, once they’re out of this mess. Best to table that thought for later.
It’s painful in a raw, aching sort of way, because somehow, Rogers manages to cut through the layers he’s built up with words sharp enough to leave him breathless.
The elevator doors are barely open before Tony is striding out, hands in the pockets of his worn jeans. Cap’s the only one on the floor, it seems; the slightly muffled sound of his blows falling unerringly on the bag echoes around the empty room, a steady rhythm that covers the sound of Tony’s light footsteps as he approaches.
, the wizard’s words were supposed to be a comfort, not a trap; he did not want to die and leave Steve in this lonely place. I don’t want to go, whispered the wind, and Tony felt a dizzying wave of unreality rise through him, threatening to knock him off his feet. He staggered closer to the cliff edge, terrified he would lose his resolve if he stopped to think, would flinch and fail and ruin everything after all. Steve stepped forward as if to follow, but Nebula was ready, and the super-soldier was surrounded by a blue glow that swept him off the ground and held him there, immobile.
Despite the shocks and turmoil of the day, despite the bone-deep weariness that just lived now at the back of his skull, Tony was actually enjoying himself as they staggered giggling across the open courtyard and kicked open the doors to the mess hall.
That’s when Steve began to scream, wrenching his body in impossible contortions, desperate to escape, to run to him, to stop what was coming. “Tony… Don’t you dare do this… Tony
Steve sucked in a lungful of air and held it while he counted to three. “Go relieve Sam and Scott. And you can maybe have the basic manners to apologize for wasting their time.”
Then he picks up a lavender rose, dreamily, inevitably, and holds it out to the man by his side. Time itself seems to stop, the electric uncertainty nearly setting Steve on fire when Tony just stares at the flower, dark eyes growing wide with its meaning.
In the end, Thanos proved too strong, his powers too unpredictable to counter; luck, like hope, was inevitably finite. Four minutes in, Wong caught a flying pebble to the head and was knocked out, which by necessity drew Doctor Strange to the door of the Sanctum. The Doctor seemed to be shielded from the glove’s magic so long as he stayed inside the Sanctum, but seeing his target so close only inflamed Thanos’ aggression. With a roar, the alien sent a spiral of molten concrete to immobilize Tony, who then could do nothing but watch as Peter got kicked right across the street and through a building.
“Steve’s fetching water,” the scientist told him, a slight smile of apology for making him jump. “Figured he might need some help.”
“Okay,” he murmured, knuckling at his eyes. “Okay. I hear you, Tony. You don’t owe me anything, I’m sorry.” He knew the other man could probably tell he was crying, but Steve was too wrung out to care anymore. “I never meant to hurt you, but I did, and that’s on me.” He swallowed. “You’re right, I should have told you. You deserved to hear the truth. Not just as H- as your father’s son. But as my friend.”
Which may have been a mistake, because next thing he knew, Steve was sitting up and was holding Tony’s head between his hands, keeping his mouth away from Steve’s body. “Please tell me that’s not… Is that all this is, Tony?” Steve asked, and Tony could have wept at the shuttered look on his face.
Behind the doctors, May had slipped into the room. With a dull shock, Tony felt her hand on his shoulder. Everyone was looking at him now.
“Steve… eyes fellas?” Tony felt like his mind was melting. Sure, he’d known how much Steve obviously loved Barnes, but he’d figured Barnes to be a special exception, not Steve’s general rule.
His friend just shook his head, watching him worriedly, but Rhodey didn’t understand. His list of losses couldn’t hurt him; with every name, his list of reasons for carrying on grew longer.
Uh... Right. Alien atmosphere. Good idea. Tony rewarded Steve with a proud smile. “Well, pour one out for the teacher’s pet.”
“Whatever it takes,” Tony whispered into the quiet, unheard, unwitnessed. Yet it was as solemn an oath as any he’d taken, and he felt its purpose settle into his bones. The Soul Stone had given him a vision for the future beyond compare, but as it turned out, he had two jobs now. Help Steve. Help the universe. That was the order of importance. Maybe the only possible order. Maybe both the same job, from the inside. Help one. Help everyone.
Tony stared at the wall, trying to school his expression into neutral. “Not a problem. I stopped drinking a while back, another month and I’ll be fine.”
“Uh?” Stark said, twitching to attention. “Oh, sorry. About that, actually I’ll need to stay on this New Asgard thing for a couple days, and it’ll be easier to pull strings from here. You don’t mind if we switch teams, platypus?” He tilted his head towards Rhodey beside him.
The other man paused. “Always,” he said; then he cleared his throat, playfully tapped on a small angry scar on Tony’s shoulder, voice teasing. “Now this one, I don’t know. Do I even want to ask, or…?”
Shuri gestured and the hologram changed to show two separate strands of DNA, one normal, and one dotted with the same purple radiance. “I was curious once, and my brother indulged me. This is his blood from the day before he first became the Panther, and this from the day after. You see the augmentation?”
Tony smirked. “Modified EMP I’ve been working on. Kinda of a bitch to get right without the circuits catching fire.” He glanced over to where there was already smoke pouring from one of the basement vents. “Oops.”
Tony followed his gaze and was shocked to notice his hand was already trembling. Well. That was embarrassing. He grabbed more toast instead and shrugged at Steve, pretending nonchalance. The super-soldier was not fooled, narrowing his eyes at Tony, but he did eventually look away.
“My fault,” he said, and then he crumbled, and Tony held him tight, kept him safe, whispered denials and absolutions into his hair until the super-soldier was spent and heavy with exhaustion. It took little persuasion for Tony to maneuver him onto the bed; they settled in to rest, Steve’s arms encircling Tony like he was a life preserver on a drowning sea. They fit neatly together, just like they always did, except when they didn’t. His stomach growled. The soup had clearly worn off, but nothing short of another apocalypse could have inspired him to move right now.
“I want to sleep,” Steve said, and walked away. He heard Sam follow, could feel the worry emanating from his friend but inside there was nothing where his own care should be.
“Good,” Steve whispered, eyes full, but still he managed to crack a smile. “Because I want all of you, Tony. Disaster or not. I want everything.”
“Oh, dear god,” Rhodey muttered. “You literally have no idea how much you sound like Tony right now, you two deserve each other.”
Then he moved off, heading for the same exit Tony had taken. Steve followed, trying to quell his sudden rush of worry. There was really no point in being nervous. Chances were Tony had already caught Zemo and was long gone, and it would be weeks or months before Steve saw him again.
Somehow, Steve heard him, paused. “Tony?” He sounded exhausted, and Tony wondered if perhaps they had a chance after all.
Tony found himself grinning, and he slung his arm over his best friend’s shoulders, enjoying the insane reality that meant he still got to do that and ignoring the sharp pull the gesture made on his alien-stitched wounds. “A wizard told me,” and Tony laughed for a second time in six days at the expression on Rhodey’s face, because there he could see the usual exasperation mixed with love but he also saw the beginnings of hope. The same fragile hope that now shone from the faces of Nat and Clint and Bruce. Even Nebula.
Of course, it was hard to shake the feeling that something was about to fuck it all up at the last minute.
Out of nowhere, the AI played a perky RPG victory fanfare, and Tony sighed. Her snark phase was just going from strength to strength, and much as he’d like to blame Peter and Shuri’s pernicious gen Z influence, he remembered much the same thing happening with Jarvis. “Design adjustment within parameters,” Friday said, leaving Tony momentarily lost without context for her words. Then with a shiver, Tony remembered what he’d been doing before Peter’s call. What he’d been about to do. The shape of the day still to come, in all its glory.
Steve silenced him with a kiss, apparently unperturbed by where Tony’s mouth had just been, which in itself was hot as
Drawn out of his misery by the novelty, Tony took a full lap for a better view, noticing how it looked like the portal could be entered from the back as well as the front. In a time of magical apocalypses such a detail should not have creeped him out, but wow, it
He’d used his name. Tony had- “Do what?” Steve said, breathless, trying to ignore the racing beeps from the surrounding machines
“Hate to spoil the party,” she said, “but if I let you boys waste time fighting, there won’t be any universe left worth speaking about.” She smiled down at a wary Gamora, touched her cheek. “Hi, sweetie,” she murmured, her voice sad.
Sam said nothing, but Steve could feel the concern in his gaze. He ignored it, instead retrieving his shield, wiping the mud off with his sleeve, wiping his sleeve clean on his pants.
The billionaire nodded, slower than Steve would like but he’d take it. The super-soldier let his hands drop, suddenly aware his grip had grown too strong again, would probably leave bruises. Careless.
A snort of laughter came from Steve’s direction.”Yeah, haha,” Tony groused, and stuck his finger in his mouth.
“Stark! It is good to hear your voice,” the first speaker bellowed over Bruce, cheerfully oblivious. No one else it could be.
“I know,” Steve said, a warm flush of adoration humming through him, because this was the Tony he’d known and cherished, this was
As the other man searched for his keys, Tony stared up at the windows, blank and unfeeling, no protection at all. Then, as if conjured from a dream, Tony saw the familiar figure; just a dark shape behind the glass, but somehow Tony knew.
“You do?” Tony asked, surprised. Even he didn’t really know anymore. There’d been so many minor injuries over the years; even the major ones had started to blur together.
The attack on New York had come as a weird relief. After all, punching was punching. And the Avengers Initiative had given Steve something manageable to focus on. Fighting was both familiar and a way to be useful again. At least on the battlefield, he could be sure and strong. For everything else… Well, if he missed something, these days there was usually someone around to set him straight.
The barrage of flashes had seared hotspots onto Tony’s vision, even through the protection of his sunglasses. He gritted his teeth and silently cursed whichever overpaid press wrangler had forgotten to outlaw blinding as a photographic team sport. Even T’Challa was wearing a perceptible frown, the equivalent of a Code Green for anyone else. The San Francisco crew had gotten themselves a world-class support team, he’d be the first to admit it, but this would never have happened on Pepper’s watch.
Rhodey swore, a harsh, ugly string of sounds. “When we couldn’t make contact with him, we assumed he’d gone to ground.”
The other man was staring at Tony, taking in his hand on the door handle, the other shoe he was holding. Then he was looking away, blank. “You’re leaving?”
“I’ll rally the troops!” the Queen volunteered, and with a giant grin she bounced out the door, her escort following. Her ebullience more than anything reminded Steve that despite her dazzling mind and confident attitude, Shuri was still a kid, and one placed in an impossibly stressful position. Of course she would welcome any plan that promised a quicker reunion with her lost family. But whether or not attacking Titan was itself a good plan, Steve had no idea. They were all flying dark here, but none more so than Tony, who by now had turned his back to them all in a way Steve very much disliked.
Rolling onto his back, Tony grabbed the lube and unceremoniously began coating Steve’s cock, already painfully hard and leaking; the other man folded at his touch, curling in to bury his cry against Tony’s shoulder. “I’m ready for you, I promise, I want this, Steve, I want you, I love you-” Tony chanted, somehow desperate to be heard, believed.
Somehow, from her, the words didn’t sting. “Uh, takes one to know one?” Tony countered. May managed a laugh that actually sounded genuine, then held out his spoon.
“Alright, Azkaban,” Tony said, glaring at the faceless man. “You promised us answers, so maybe start with explaining why Thanos would send the Stone back here to you? He tapping you in on the tag team of misery?”
When Dr Palmer returned, she pointed him towards the window to the empty room next door where Tony would soon appear. Steve tried his best to keep watch, but eventually, dazed and lonely, his mind drifted away to a nameless place even the stars could not reach.
Not wanting to actually fall sleep, Tony opened his eyes slightly, tilted his head to one side. Steve now sat further towards the canyon’s edge, lost in concentration, his profile lit red by the setting sun. Beauty, Tony thought. At that moment, Steve looked over at him and smiled. Art, Tony thought.
It had been his turn to pack, this year, so Steve already knew that in the kitchen there was a picnic waiting. He also knew he would spend the rest of the evening relaxing with his husband before celebrating their rare night of peace together in a dozen beautiful sweaty ways. And tomorrow, he knew, he would share his work with his friends and surprise them with his spin-off ideas, hopefully gaining their approval before the party devolved too far into karaoke and mischief.
Still, it took a minute or so before Steve trusted himself to speak. Luckily Tony had no such trouble, chattering wildly about his plans to have Pepper buy up every candy corporation on Earth just so he could ban all the purple ones.
Strange reeled off a bunch of medical-sounding jargon that sank right through Tony’s grasp. When the ER staff had safely transferred Steve to a bed, he let Friday recall the nanobots so the doctor - Christine? - could continue her examination. She sounded so smooth and calm, asking Strange further quick questions, her deft hands steady.
“After today, you will never, ever touch me again,” Tony told him. Just as Ty opened his mouth to point out the obvious, Tony sucker-punched him in the nose; the tycoon went down, hard.
The idea hung in the air like a rung bell, and Steve found every nerve in his body thrilling at the prospect of direct action. But a few feet away, Tony was looking crushed, and after a moment, Steve could understand why. Switching the plan now meant throwing out weeks of frantic work. Meant maybe weeks of wasted time. Which meant needless lives lost. Misery beyond measure.
cockpit, and Steve thought once more how very odd it was that this alien place could look so much like home.
Steve seized the safer topic gratefully. “He’s my friend.” The words hung in the air between them; too late, Steve realized what he'd done.
- that he didn’t notice the door sliding open to announce the doctors’ return, but Steve did, grabbing Tony’s hand between his own to keep it in place against his cheek, holding him tight as if to never let him go.
Romanoff nodded hello, then busied herself making coffee. “Hello, Mr Stone,” Bruce said, in that special Bruce tone reserved for people he didn’t like.
May must have noticed, because she tried to come to his rescue. “Actually, with his concussion Tony should really stay overnight for observation, and he’s already got some sleep. Perhaps he can sit with Captain Rogers until the morning?”
He opens his eyes enough for others to see. Rhodey is leaning over him. He looks exhausted. Terrible. Beautiful. His friend.
“Reality Stone,” Tony confirmed. “Convenient way to build something, I guess. I have the image in my head of what I want it to do, but how do we get it done? Think happy thoughts?”
Desperate to soak in every detail of this moment, Tony glanced up at Steve’s face as his fingers slid home; greedily he memorized the smooth slide of skin beneath his grip, Steve’s radiant expression, the tiny shocked gasp that fell from the other man’s mouth at his touch. Steve. Tony bent forward, kissing a line from Steve’s inner thigh all the way along his length, then opened his mouth and swallowed him down, pride cascading like sparks throughout his body as he heard Steve stutter his name in a hoarse, panting cry.
Once he was upright and fully clothed, Pepper yawned. “Okay, it’s close enough to night, I’m going to go find some kind of carb and then sleep off some of this jet-lag.”
?” For the first time, his mask of icy civility slipped. “You refused before. Twice. You wouldn’t listen to Nat, or Vision, or anyone. Instead it was all about
Throughout his miserably epic history of fuckups and failures, Tony had become a pro at masking up, delivering adequate bullshit to suit every occasion, but sitting through this party felt more of a chore than ever before.
It had taken the team weeks to find their target on Titan, and that was when they had known what they were looking for; as they set off across the anonymous plain Tony was prepared for Vormir to be a disappointment, but after just a few minutes, Nebula called a halt.
“Don’t bullshit me, Rogers,” Tony hissed, dangerous yet fragile. He had stepped close enough for Steve to feel his breath on his face, close enough that there was no one else left in the world, but impossibly far away. “Did you
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again, nodded. And it was that simple. Steve opened his arms and the billionaire buried his face in Steve’s shoulder. Funny. The super-soldier had shaved off his beard before the global broadcast six weeks ago; better to present a more familiar sight to the traumatized citizens of the world, Tony had said. Steve had kept up shaving since, figuring the illusion of calm might help steady the people he spoke with every day. Tony had turned up to the broadcast with his trademark goatee and styled hair, then, as soon as the cameras stopped rolling, promptly let it all slide. Steve rather approved of the rougher look, but had brought the billionaire a razor once his beard threatened to reach full lumberjack. Just in case of future public events. Tony had laughed and restored the goatee but left his hair wild. And as it turned out, a standing Tony was just tall enough for his untamed curls to tickle underneath Steve’s chin. Details.
The soft thud of a mystery object against his skull interrupted his reverie; he only groaned a little, inwardly, before he opened his eyes, blinking against the light. The terrible twos were looming closer every day. But the twins were still occupied on the floor, busily trading building blocks towards the fort of the day.
“Yes, I am, and you are too,” Tony answered. “So don’t give up on me yet. You gotta finish the job, use that Gauntlet, Steve.”
A nameless fear flashed through him, taut and cold. He glanced back at Tony to find the other man staring at Helen, his face utterly blank.
“Tony…” He heard Steve sigh his name like he’d used to, exasperation and fondness and rebuke in one. Perhaps for the last time.
All the furniture was gone except for the bed, the walls entirely replaced by giant screens that were playing videos of-
Shuri shot him a cool-it glance that she must have learned from her mother, but eventually she nodded. “I finally had a couple days to complete the analysis on his sample. The serum… I believe it was originally based on the same elixir that grants the Black Panther their powers.”
An unearthly keen beyond words erupted from the super-soldier, still fighting, blue eyes twisted dark with pain. Sorry. So sorry. But he understood now.
A rising tide of horror was engulfing him, because on the screens there were faces Tony recognized, acquaintances from the countless parties he’d attended with Ty early on, the endless string of distractions he’d barely cared to remember. But there were other faces too, people he’d never met before, he was sure. And what they were
At least Shuri’s request was a novel distraction. The young Queen was blasting some unfamiliar music as Steve entered the lab, nodding to the Dora Milaje positioned outside her door. Whatever the link was between genius and loud music, he didn’t know, but the unintentional reminder of Tony made him smile. Shuri spotted him quickly and beckoned him across the room.
The mission had two major obstacles. For one, Stone had only ever allowed Friday to be installed in Tony’s workshop in the mansion. Everywhere else in the house was wired separately, and therefore beyond the AI’s reach. Someone would have to infiltrate Stone’s expensive security and grant Friday access to the basement server directly; she would then need time to analyze the data before she could begin destroying the local files, so this would have to be accomplished without Stone noticing the intrusion.
Tony blinked down at him, grateful but slightly thrown by the sudden change of subject. “Plot, legacy or opinions?”
Steve didn’t know what to do. Automatically he glanced to Bucky for guidance, but his childhood friend looked as thrown as Steve felt, his eyes locked onto Tony as if hypnotized. As if searching for a danger he could recognize.
Tony surged towards him, kissing him hard and desperate. “Upstairs,” he breathed against Steve’s mouth.
When Steve offered to accompany him, his first reaction was a blast of panic. Ty lost it every time he was reminded of Steve’s existence. Bringing the other man into Ty’s
Steve’s eyes flew open with a groan; he flashed Tony a look of such want that Tony felt even his own depleted cock stir in response. Then Steve was over him, owning him, lips and teeth and fire, groaning his name and grinding what could not possibly be but impossibly
“Just answer the goddamn question, Rogers,” Tony said, but there was no heat in it, only exhaustion.
Without further thought, he stretched out his hand; Tony instantly reached back, yet the glass keeping them apart was cold and harsh as the void.
“You were a fool to pursue me, Stark, after I spared your life once,” Thanos snarled, taking a few menacing steps towards them. “But fear not; this time I will give you a noble death.”
The super-soldier had stormed forward, was arguing about trading lives and unjust bargains. Tony caught Nebula’s eye, something in his expression drawing her over to his side.
“Steve, Steve, Steve,” Tony was saying over and over, both of them sinking to the ground. Always his. Then the pain arrived, and Steve sucked in a breath, high on relief because the pain meant that he’d made it in time. Brown eyes. Beautiful. Safe. Angry.
Nebula was in place behind Steve; the super-soldier was still too stunned to move. “But… Thor,” Steve managed, yet Tony was already shaking his head.
Sam was still talking. “How about we head to the lab, have Bruce or Shuri look you over-” No point. No help. Not them. Not…
“Sure. This is the one you just got on Titan, obviously,” Steve said, tapping the barely visible scar on his side. Then he bent in to kiss it. Tony held his breath, unexpectedly moved by the delicacy of the gesture. Steve’s fingers traced further along his body. “Those two are from New York. That’s from the first Sokovia strike.” Tony watched as Steve continued talking, the other man absorbed in reading Tony’s skin, calling up memories Tony himself had long forgotten, then kissing them back to silence.
“Siberia was tough on him, you know,” Tony heard Barnes say, and he blinked at the former assassin. “He hated fighting you.”
“If I needed a nap, I’d say so,” Steve grumbled as he retrieved the offending stuffed rabbit and lobbed it back at her, maybe harder than required.
“Ah yes, the one perk of misery,” the other man drawled, but then his smirk softened into a real smile. “You look happy.”
Doctor Strange coughed once. “For long, complicated reasons I don’t wish to explain, Earth will need to keep the Time Stone intact or face other, worse, annihilations,” he said. The monk, Wong, nodded confirmation. “And as far as is practicable, I must stay at my post in New York for similar reasons-”
,” cried the Captain, and in that moment, Steve felt himself wrenched clear of the web, floating, sinking away to a dead place that felt familiar, intimate, correct.
Tony gives a theatrically casual shrug. “According to Jarvis they all mean different things, so I figured getting some of everything would cover all your bases.”
. And the guilt threatened to submerge him utterly, because Steve knew. He’d done this. He’d caused this.
Stricken with doubt, he released his grip on the other man, halfway mortified by his own actions, thoroughly mystified. Yet Tony still didn’t pull away, and Steve felt a flash of hope rush through him, his former terror cut with a new, dazzling heat.
“So am I, Steve,” Tony said, earnest in a way he rarely allowed himself to be. Terrified in a way few battles had ever made him. He needed to do this right more than he needed to breathe. “I would like to hear what you want, for us, for yourself, anything. I would like for you to tell me what you want. In words. Whatever you want.”
For a second, Tony looked confused, then he snorted a laugh. “Oh, you mean- no, that’s May Parker. Peter’s aunt. Pretty sure she hates me, really.”
It should have been reassuring, but somehow it only intensified Steve’s panic, his thoughts stubbing on the idea that Tony might still care, even after everything Steve had done. Because soon enough Tony wouldn’t care. Not anymore. After this, it would be too late.
“Daddy, fly!” Sarah demanded, imperious as ever. Without skipping a beat, Tony stood, scooped her up and started spinning her around horizontally, now making zoomy airplane noises. James, a reserved child despite the keen Stark sparkle in his eyes, tugged on Nat’s sleeve and whispered in her ear. She nodded, then knelt so he could clamber onto her back, then the two took off chasing an equally squealing Tony and Sarah around the room, Steve on the couch a lone oasis amid the chaos.
Mind resolute, Steve wrenched his thoughts away, focusing on the situation that awaited him back in New York. With military precision, he finished his shower, dressed and returned to the Quinjet. When the other man eventually made an appearance, he didn’t bother speaking to Steve, instead saying nothing at all on the long flight home.
The Quinjet’s ramp was still open, which he hoped was a message. He found Tony in the cockpit, finishing up the pre-flight checks and studiously ignoring his arrival. Steve stood awkwardly in the doorway.
“How long have you been awake?” Tony asked. The serum meant Steve needed a lot less sleep than most humans. Hopefully he hadn’t been bored.
“I called earlier but he didn’t pick up, can you tell him I’ll say thanks properly when I see him tomorrow?” Peter asked.
In his peripheral vision, Steve saw Bucky shift into a defensive stance, but despite the warning of his own instincts, Steve couldn’t quite bring himself to do the same. Whatever Tony was about to do, Steve surely deserved worse. He would protect Bucky from Tony’s wrath. But nothing more.
“On our way,” Tony called over, and he shot Steve a grin that promised mischief. “I’m so gonna tell him,” he teased.
“You’re five hours late, Stark,” he snarled. “Five. Hours. Do you not understand how that throws off the schedules of everyone else on your team?”
Even as Rogers went down with a surprised yelp, Tony was darting forward to draw the alien’s fire, but before he could land a hit, Thanos’ head began to snap back and forth as if from unseen blows. Hope and Scott, Tony realized, the relief flooding through him doubling when Friday was finally able to triangulate their signatures. With the AI’s help, Tony began to weave his attacks in harmony with theirs, working together to beat Thanos back.
“That since pop culture narratives have the power to influence contemporary behavioral norms, incorporating marginalized perspectives within mainstream cultural institutions can help bridge the initial gaps of understanding within society’s collective consciousness around people who would otherwise be vulnerable to Othering, but it’s tough cos using narratives to leverage social change requires the creator to pursue storytelling goals that transcend corporate profiteering.”
, in a hopelessly final way, that whatever was happening to Tony, he’d done this. He’d caused this. The guilt felt oceanic, pulling him under. He wrapped an arm around the other man’s shoulder, trying to hold Tony upright as if it would keep them both from drowning.
“Would that I could, pal,” the former assassin said, “but unlike Steve I’ve never had an eye for the fellas.”
Evening debrief meant catching everyone up to speed on the day’s happenings over another meal, then the night shift would take over and the rest had downtime. Steve used these couple of hours to train in the gym unless he’d been on a mission, in which case he liked to join whoever was in the common room for the feel-good movie of the day. After FRIDAY’s cheerful voice was granted access to the rest of the palace, at times it almost felt like the old days at Avengers Tower.
Steve’s heart lurched, hopeless, when Tony flinched away from his touch, had to gather his nerve before swinging back to meet Steve’s gaze. His stricken brown eyes, for once unguarded, exposed Tony as Steve had never seen him before. No masks, no humor. No protection.
Barnes frowned. “Well, I mean… Times were rough back then, but he sure used to… Does he not anymore?”
“I’m just glad you’re alive to be mad at,” Tony said. He watched Steve relax, breathe, in and out. Huh. His eyelashes were dark blond. “I’m sorry you lost Barnes.”
Later, much later, Tony was able to piece together the full time-line. How Thor, Loki and the Valkyrie had arrived on Nowhere to find Thanos had gotten there first. How the Mad Titan had fought them, Power and Reality Stones installed on his Gauntlet. How Loki had betrayed Thor once more, this last time for love, handing over the Space Stone in exchange for Thor’s life. How Thor had been forced to watch, helpless, as Thanos had choked his brother to an agonizing death. Only the timely arrival of the Guardians had saved the Valkyrie from suffering the same end. Their intervention had sent Thanos into retreat, but not before he took Gamora prisoner, insisting she pay homage to his success. There, Tony later theorized, he must have gotten word of his disciples’ failed assaults on New York and Wakanda, and decided to handle Earth himself.
They go to Shuri, her head bandaged. Wakanda has their leader. The Captain wonders how much she will hate the job. The Queen’s grief is compressed, flashes diamond-bright, but she is busy trespassing, invading, saving what’s left of the world. Romanoff and Banner sit Thor in a chair and step up, fingers tapping, minds assessing. Half the world’s population has vanished, Shuri says, but the Captain has no time. Crises bloom faster than despair. Thor’s not speaking.
The belief had sheltered him, he knew, had prevented the horrors from sticking as deeply as they could. Surviving the return with those memories intact had been a shock, yes, but one he felt he could live with, given time. Yet Tony’s burden of memories faded to nothing compared to Steve’s experiences. The other man had spent months staring out at the end of the world, a front row witness to unbearable horrors, aware that helping was futile but
“Sorry, Cap,” Tony said, and painted a smile on his face before he turned around. “I guess the wizard forgot to mention a couple things.”
“I remember thinking it would be a good idea,” Steve said. “I’ve no clue what happened next. I guess Thor was right about how hard it is for mortals to control these things.”
He could see now how well Tony had used Steve’s ridiculous kiss against him, snaring him in a trap worthy of Zemo’s foul designs. And again, Steve had failed to see the danger until too late. Even if he’d never known Tony to stoop so low as this before, Steve had heard enough stories from before Afghanistan. He’d read the reports, the endless scandals. The man he’d considered a friend had seemed above such petty manipulations. Steve had wanted to believe that Tony had changed, blinded by his own faith in people’s essential goodness.
The billionaire pulled a face at the scientist’s back but spared no time in crossing the campsite and descending the steep slope towards the nearby river. It was weirdly heartening to find water was water, even in space. Plus the microbial life here was different enough to Earth microbes that they had no discernible effect on human physiology so far, meaning they could drink the water and probably not die in some gruesome Hollywood way. They purified it anyway, just in case, but it was nice to know.
Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand, weaving his fingers with Tony’s own. “That this time, you don’t go off alone to save the universe. That you don’t leave me behind again.” He paused. “Promise me that whatever comes, we’ll fight it together.”
“… called the Infinity Stones, the six best shinies that could, unlimited power, yada yada yada. We know. And we know Thanos got the Soul Stone here. What we want to know is how exactly he did that.”
They walked outside the hut. Nebula closed her eyes and the Space Stone flared a searing blue, then just like that, Tony was looking at a portal to another planet. It appeared markedly different to the big-ass puff of blue smoke Thanos had vanished through, more like a blurry doorway ringed with blue fire, but when he mentioned the smoke Nebula just sniffed. “Sounds undignified.”
“You hum too,” the super-soldier continued. “While you’re working. If it’s going well. Did you know that?”
The billionaire wrinkled his nose at him. “Of course. Figuring out Erskine’s lost formula was one of the biggest puzzles of the twentieth century. People spent decades chasing the dream, promising they could deliver a new crop of super-soldiers, perhaps more. But honestly, at first I assumed it was a fairy tale, something for old men to talk about and young fools to waste their time on. And then later,” he gestured at Steve, “there was you.”
Steve Rogers, drama queen, wrinkled his nose and grandly addressed a nearby tree. “How did that make no sense, but also completely make sense? Do you know? Because I don’t know.” But a moment later, he dropped the act and tilted the sketchbook towards Tony. “Anyway. Thanks.”
Fuck, Steve thinks. Of course. Of course. Thor hasn’t been there yet, the BiFrost can’t reach it. He should have thought of that. Why hadn’t he thought of that? They’d been returned to the last moment before the end of the world, and that meant right now, Tony is…
“Ty, slow down,” Tony tried. When the blond man ignored him, Tony felt a surge of anger that for once he didn’t squash. Windows everywhere. He wouldn’t dare.
Tony, who had been keeping his hands raised oddly in the air, now wriggled his fingers. “Double scrubbed, double gloved.”
“Not visually,” Tony said. Which wasn’t really a lie. If he opened the door, the others would be able to see him.
Steve glared at his visor and flicked his fingers against the armor’s chest. “Take off the armor. You steer, I carry, remember?”
,” Tony choked out, leaping to his feet as if to flee the room. But instead he turned his back to the window, wrapping his arms around himself as if he couldn’t stand upright alone.
Across the room, Clint slammed to his feet, his chair crashing to the floor behind him. The archer stalked towards Tony, his expression furious, stopping only when they were eye to eye.
Tony’s mouth tasted gross, a weird mix of marmalade and earwax. “No wonder Vision never had an appetite,” Tony muttered. He opened his eyes, squinting.
“Because I also knew how that conversation would end,” Steve said softly, hunching a little further away. “Think about it, Tony. You and Pepper were good. You were so happy together. If I’d come to you back then and told you I had feelings for you, would you really have risked losing her?”
“Okay, so the fact the Devastation occurred at the same moment everywhere in the universe kinda defies everything we know of the physics of time,” the billionaire started.
Tony responded without thought, stumbling blindly into the unbearable light. “Steve!” he called into the nothingness. He felt a resistance ahead like a strong magnetic repulsion, and he concentrated on pushing through, lifting off the ground when his steps failed; the arc reactor began to whine with increasing effort, the light around him pulsing faintly blue in response. Tony breathed a quick sigh of relief as his visor finally adapted and he started to make out shapes within the light, then he nearly screamed himself. Steve was collapsed on the charred ground, the Gauntlet useless at his side. The Power Stone was still in his unprotected left hand, the super-soldier’s arm slowly dissolving into cinders as the purple energy burned his flesh, traveling towards his heart.
Ty was staring at him, his face a frothing mix of fear and suspicion and outrage. “In case it wasn’t clear,” Tony told him softly. “You can’t control me anymore. Right now, my AI is shredding every scrap of blackmail material you possess. And not just on me, but on
Rocket was creeping closer, his eyes wide in fascination. “Restoring Titan must have compounded the original damage. Looks like it’s damn near about to explode.” Inexplicably, the raccoon giggled. “ All the power in the universe, and he couldn’t even risk picking it up. What a shambles.”
The silence, when he finally noticed it, rang an alarm bell throughout his body, and a buzzing awareness on his neck told him he was already being watched. Tony redeployed the armor, sending the nanobots sneaking down his sleeves so as not to alert his observer. He bent down as if to lift the last container, moving as casually as he usually did, then swiveled quickly to his blind side, repulsors at the ready.
Steve broke off, appalled by his own vitriol, by the devastated expression on Stark’s face, all the worse because he’d
Steve moved to cover him, his bulk pinning Tony in place. “Well, I got a pretty big mouth,” he murmured, but even in the face of such corniness Tony had nothing left to say because all blood was now south of the border and he couldn’t think in words, what were words, how words? And Steve was kissing him deep, slowly, possessively, as if he already knew that Tony was all his, he’d gotten the keys and was just enjoying the view before the moving van showed up to make it official-
Tony shot him a dirty look and continued to perform a sulk. Standing beside Steve, Thor cleared his throat. “How long until we reach the surface?”
it hurts, so much - but it’s better for me if I go back to being his friend, and let someone else be his person.”
They spend a lot of time in bed, sleeping, eating, fucking. Tony shows him quiet happy movies. Aladdin. Steve laughs. Tony laughs. It’s almost enough. The wizard comes to visit, leaves Tony shaking, slow. Apparently there was at least one other way. Steve holds him safe. Tony decides. No more fighting. He’s done.
Thanos gestured to the gauntlet on his arm. “My mission will soon be complete. Allow me to obtain the Time Stone, and I will return you to the past. All I ask is that you stand down from this fight, Captain. Leave this unhappy time to its miserable end. Surrender to the kindness of Thanos, and good fortune will at last be yours.” The alien waited, his enormous chin arrogantly high.
“Hello, Dad and Daddy! Or is it Pops and Dad? Or Dad and Pops? Whatever, you know what I mean, I’ve just got like, things, to tell you,” and he extended his arm (adorned with a My Little Pony watch) for a handshake. Tony and Steve didn’t move a single centimetre, completely on their guard. A few seconds of awkward silence went by.
Steve leaned in, and pressed his own lips to Tony’s. They were so warm, in contrast to the cold rainwater evaporating off his skin. So warm, they were melting the ice around Tony’s heart. Tony felt this dull ache at his arc reactor – he wanted to push Steve away, but he wanted more. So he just stood there, and let Steve kiss him, slowly, softly. He let Steve take away all his troubles with every single contact.
Now, deprived of a crisis, he felt scrubbed raw, all of his senses flooded open, and the super-soldier clenched his teeth at the discomfort. He had to keep it together. There was too much to do. He could not get distracted now.
“Not yet,” he said, and plucked the Soul Stone out of the air. It felt cool to the touch despite its glow, so he stowed it in a zipped pocket on his chest and turned to Nebula. “Take us back to Titan,” the Captain said. Instead of complying, the android looked at Stark. Allegiance. Possible interference. The Captain waited. At Stark’s nod, she opened the portal; he motioned for the two of them to proceed, so the Captain was the last to step through.
Steve had been a little bit distracted for Thanos’ departure from Wakanda, but the Gauntlet seemed much more severely damaged than Thor had described. Deep cracks had emerged between the six glowing Stones, and the metal shards seemed a breath away from falling apart.
Bitter, stinging words rose in his throat, but Tony swallowed them back. “Noted,” he said instead, voice as cold as he could manage. “Shall we move on?” Barton opened his mouth, but subsided after a Romanoff elbow to the ribs.
Steve seized his best friend in a quick embrace, promising himself he would visit Wakanda as soon as he possibly could. Then he nodded to T’Challa and was hurrying away through the snow before he could think twice.
. Steve had yelled at him, laughed with him, had fought alongside him and occasionally against him, but he’d definitely never wanted to
“Always,” he says, or he tries to say, but the word turns itself into a cough, which is just rude. But not painful. He is empty of pain. Good. When Tony can see again, Rhodey is holding a glass of water. Another set of hands is helping him sit up. Bruce. Friend.
But the other man had already seized Tony’s face between his hands and now kissed him to gasping before pulling back again, a tight, serious look on his face. “Last call, Tony. You want this?”
“I’ll take it,” Steve whispered, and the realization crashed down upon him that maybe it was nearly over, that the universe was really going to be saved. The horrors undone. “Tony,” he tried, and his eyes were blurring, his knees weak. The Captain was furious; Thanos wasn’t dead yet, they still had to secure the area, neutralize his Gauntlet, retrieve the Stones. Still so much to do. But this first battle was over, and despite his worst fears, they had lost no one, and Tony was okay.
Too late, Steve accepted the bitter reality. His place would never be here, by Tony’s side. The friendship he’d cherished was gone. There was nothing left to believe in, nothing to try or do or explain. It was over. And he was done.
The other man leaned in low, breath hot on his cheek. “Tony Stark,” he murmured, almost a growl. “May I please fuck your ass?”
Nebula stopped in front of Thanos, stared down at him. The Mad Titan opened his eyes, squinted up at her. “You,” he breathed, and the scorn that dripped from his tone fell like a lash.
Scrambling, fumbling, warmth, blue glow orange glow and then Tony was opening his eyes, “WHAT the fuck-” but Steve cut him off, kissing him because Tony was warm and alive and then Steve was crying so hard he could drown so he buried his head in Tony’s neck and held on; a couple seconds later Tony was wrapping his arms around him, carrying him back to the surface, breath and sun guiding him home; always home.
Instead of interrupting Steve and his muscles, Tony sought out Shuri. The Queen was sitting with Okoye and Bruce, the adults teaching her how to peel and prepare some local edible ahead of the evening meal. After Thor’s success with the Bifrost had gone undetected by anything on Titan, they had taken full advantage of the Asgardian’s ability to shuttle team members back and forth to Earth, letting the Titan team avail of instant healing - the wildlife here was mean - or just take some rest. Only Tony and Steve so far hadn’t returned, out of the original team, and this was Shuri’s first day on the alien planet. She’d been arguing for the opportunity since Thor’s first return, but both her age and responsibilities back home had counted against her. Yet as the weeks went by with no sign of Thanos and nothing bar some ugly space critters to offer any danger, the case for keeping the young Queen safe on Earth had weakened to where she’d finally had her way. Now that she was here, it was hard to resist her enthusiasm, really.
“Wait, so you fought him blind?” Rhodey asked, shocked. “Tony, I swear, if you ever go into space alone again-”
, Tony’s mind pronounced this- and stumbled them both towards the bed. Tony seized the opportunity to trail kisses down his neck, eliciting all kinds of breathy groans. Distracted, Steve dropped Tony haphazardly onto the bed before collapsing atop him; Tony twisted beneath him, yanking up the other man’s shirt, pressing his lips to whatever skin he could reach. “
Steve closed his eyes. “There was a schoolbus,” he murmured. Then he touched the Power Stone, and in a torrent of purple energy, half the palace exploded.
it would be better if he stayed far away. It always was. Yet he could still feel the nurses watching, their well-meaning concern eating through him like acid.
“I presented him with the option,” Steve clarifies. “He decided to take it.” Across the table, Tony looks genuinely miffed at the abandonment, which makes Steve’s heart clench with painful affection.
Yet Saturday morning, the man had shown up at the Sanctum forty minutes late, and in such disarray that for one horrified moment Steve had thought he was drunk. Stark had instead claimed major sleep deprivation, blaming both Asgard and his horny fiancé, pairing the latter excuse with a salacious wink to a visibly disinterested Wong. Although Stark had sworn that Friday could keep him steady enough to fly, Steve hadn’t trusted a word he'd said, ordering him to go sleep instead. That move had left Stark sullen and Sam furious at having to pull double duty. Stark had taken over air patrol from Sam around lunchtime but spent most of his time sniping bitterly at the team. When Sam returned around midnight, Stark had left again, insisting he’d be back at six am for the morning shift.
Beside him, the archer had winced theatrically at the name. “Ugh, yeah. I mean, a name like that, you gotta be a prick. But if you haven’t guessed already, we hate him.”
Steve looked down at his body, his arms. Remembered Thanos, the battle. Looked up at Tony, who for some reason was sitting in a chair by his bed, huddled into a blanket. Steve could see something like worry in the man’s dark eyes. Something like pity. A hot, desolate panic bubbled up through him, that Tony should see him so compromised. That after two long years of ignoring Steve’s existence, only now would Tony deign to look at him.
Granted, the initial surge of catastrophic threats had relented as more and more people rallied towards collaborative survival. Humanity had even racked up some heartening wins, but every day they lost far more than they managed to save. All Steve knew was that Tony had said there was no other way; he hoped that meant these losses weren’t permanent but merely strange eddies in some hideous unreality; he had to believe one day the Devastation would be undone. The battlefield part of him recognized that his belief was too convenient to be trustworthy, most likely a protective mechanism no different to any foolish superstition, but it also kept him detached enough to function despite the staggering losses.
The other man tried to shrug. “In my defense, those first couple years, I didn’t really let myself think about it, just told myself we were work friends and nothing more. But after you retired, nothing felt right without you, until one day, I woke up and I just… knew.”
“Yes, Stark has been explaining your past captivity,” T’Challa said, and Bucky twitched once, as if surprised. Steve just felt numb. He should have known he could trust Tony to be fair. “This control Hydra still wields over you,” the prince was saying. “Would it be your wish to have it permanently revoked?”
He wondered now if that was the victory Zemo had envisioned. The trap was so clear, in hindsight. Almost beautiful in its way. And at every step, Steve had played his part of the perfect clockwork soldier, marching bravely and correctly, straight off a goddamn cliff. Without his immediate rejection of the Accords, he would have still been an Avenger after the bombing. He could have taken Bucky into protective custody with people he trusted, kept him far beyond Zemo’s reach. And without Steve’s lack of faith, Tony would have already known about his parents and not been blindsided by the video once they got to Siberia.
you? Are the other Stones alive? Are you alive? What do you mean by soul? Is it like a sentient consciousness thing? Or does everything living count? Do ants have souls? Do you know what an ant is? Is there life after death?” The billionaire stopped for breath but after the Soul Stone raised an arched eyebrow he stayed quiet; Peggy’s fool-quelling stare proving as effective as ever.
Wilson still looked doubtful, but just as Tony was sure he was going to refuse, Peter tried and failed to stifle a loud yawn. This detonated a chain of giant sympathetic yawns through the exhausted team, and once Wilson had his face back under control, he shook his head ruefully. “Okay, fine. I’ll be back in the morning, thanks.”
Wakanda’s armies had been magnificent, it seemed, their shield technology allowing Earth’s defenses to manage the alien incursion with minimal casualties. Thanos himself had been off-world for most of the early battle, content to spend his first waves of attack searching for weaknesses. Once he’d joined the fray, Carol, Strange and Vision had managed to negate his use of the Infinity Stones, but he remained an intense physical threat even without their power.
Tony was content to let Steve do whatever he wanted, but the other man didn’t look so happy any more. “All good?” Tony asked, his voice raspy.
“Did no good anyway; Thanos reversed it somehow, made like it never happened. Bruce said you’d gone after the Time Stone?”
And when Steve looked up, there he was, leaning against the door-jamb, busily finishing an apple. Taking a moment to watch the twins play in the sun. Steve watched him right back, drinking in the sight. Dark eyes. Messy hair. Amused. Beautiful. Tony flicked his gaze over towards Steve, inscrutable thoughts quirking his lips upwards. All these years together, and Steve still ached to know more, learn more, keep everything he could of this man. He sat instead, waited. Knowing Tony would come to him, as he always did. Keeping faith that he always would.
, uh, sorry May, is he still asleep?” the kid hissed in a stage whisper, looking impossibly young in his street clothes.
“Tony? What happens now?” the other man murmured, in that broken, wistful voice that Tony had secretly hoped to never hear again.
“And how are you, Mr Stark?” Dr Lewis said, extending his smile towards the window. “Arm doing okay?”
Tony said nothing; instead, the other man pulled out his phone and commenced tapping busily, the silence stretching into a chasm between them. Steve quietly tried to distract himself, first by examining the gray dullness of the isolation room, then by mentally adding a whole suite of aesthetic improvements. Yet it was becoming harder and harder to deny his own exhaustion, to keep himself awake, safely beyond reach of the starless void.
“Maybe we don’t need to talk about it,” Tony offered. But maybe there was too much to talk about, was more what he meant.
Nebula visibly flinched; Steve was shaking, Schmidt’s words flooding through him. Bargains… Costs… The Captain held firm; the Nazi was still speaking. “In all my life, I have loved none and thought myself superior. Trapped on this planet, I learned the price of love, and in its absence knew myself bereft. But the lesson goes deeper still, Captain Rogers. Only today, watching you and your beloved, did I finally understand how cheaply I had sold my soul, how weak I had made myself by valuing only the extraordinary and glorious. For I had turned my back on an ordinary magic which can surpass all others, perhaps the deepest power in the universe, which life itself is born to wield.”
Then it’s the familiar contours of Shuri’s lab, and Tony is crying because Peter is hovering by his side, offering water and calling frantically for help when Tony can’t stop crying, but the kid catches on eventually when Tony pulls him in for a hug, cries a bit himself, and Rhodey is here, and Bruce is here, and Shuri is joining them - uh oh, these two - and they’re telling him Pepper is on her way, and at that Tony loses it entirely, and they shush him to sleep, urge him to rest, and this time he goes willingly because Pepper is on her way and will be here in the morning and the kid is alive and Pepper is alive and the world is alive so what more could he possibly-
Something about him asking made Tony want to cry. Instead, he just stepped towards the other man, who gathered him close, gentle and sure.
“It might actually be after three, Aunt May’s on shift til nine, but we can get lunch for ourselves on the way if that’s easier?”
With renewed enthusiasm, they made short work of shedding their clothes. Steve found to his horror that Tony’s whole body was overlaid with mottled bruising, proof the past week had not been just a bad dream; he pressed his lips to every bitter mark he could find, heart aching in silent apology.
“Ok, cool, cool,” Peter said, sounding slightly distracted. “Oh hey so Ned’s back with, holy shhh- …a few more copies, uh, I gotta go but yeah see you tomorrow, bye!”
“Next step is eating, right?” Rhodey asked. That sounded sensible. Tony remembered a hunger, before.
. “I know people can be cruel like that, but I couldn’t accept it. Not from you. It made me think I didn’t know you at all. And that… that’s the part that hurt the most.”
They had just reached a narrow part of the trail when Steve signaled for them all to halt. Nebula did not notice or care, and kept walking. A shadow floated oddly into her path, and as Steve leapt forward, shield high, Tony aimed his repulsor at the overhang above, ready to bury whatever it was at the first sign of threat. Nebula finally stopped but just raised her fist, the soft glow of the Space Stone erupting into dazzling brilliance.
The previous autumn, at the care home, Steve had finally asked, and she’d agreed. In fact, she’d said she would always have agreed, then scolded him for waiting so long. Her nurse had scavenged an antique frame so Peggy could keep the drawing by her bedside. That had been a good day.
. Steve took point as they’d agreed, leading Tony up the steps and through the massive doors. Inside, the house was deathly silent, the walls seeming to shrink oddly at the edges of his vision.
They sit him down. The best they can do. A series of treatments, a gradual purge. It’ll take years. He accepts. They return to the States. Malibu, better. Always warm. Tony asks; the sea. Steve answers; swims. He trains every day, stays ready to fight, just in case. And he sketches, and he reads, and he watches Tony work. He likes watching Tony work, summoning the future. Life and beauty.
He paused. He’d meant to lead up to this. Take them through the steps so they’d all see it this time. So they’d all agree. Maybe he shouldn’t say anything yet. But then… Tony had always had this sense, always known when the math would run true, long before any computer could catch up. Like he could taste the truth of it. Hear it sing to him. It was the most beautiful sound in the universe. And now he felt it simmer up inside of him again, the one taut thread of possibility keeping him sane. To hell with it.
“That, uhhh- that’s some pretty big talk you got there, Rogers,” Tony babbled weakly just to make noise, his last brain cell having evidently quit to join the rest on some other better plane of existence, goodbye and good riddance.
Yet the shield never wavered. “I don’t normally hold with crude language,” Rogers said, “but you can kindly go fuck yourself.”
“Steve, please, just stop a second and talk to me,” he said urgently. “This was never the plan, what the hell are you doing?”
In the following months, they take down Hydra. They neutralize the Mandarin. They defend London, and when Loki returns to wreak havoc, they are ready.
Steve stepped up to Tony’s side, then realized he had no idea what to say, so instead of speaking he just took the billionaire’s hand and waited.
“You know, it’s funny, really,” Steve tells him, his voice rough. “When I came back in time, I never expected to be doing this again. I mean, theoretically I knew this day might come, but… I guess I never thought I’d actually make it this far.”
, he thought. They’d spent every day with Steve, these past two years. Huddled between Bruce and Rhodey, Tony sat trapped in a furious numbness at the idea that anyone else could have so much more to mourn.
Yet that was the key, wasn’t it? If there was no other way, then this had to be the only way, but he had no directions for what that would look like, so it could look like anything. All he knew was the wizard thought his survival was vital to undoing the apocalypse. So, whatever he did next had to be a part of it, right? It sounded ridiculous even in his head, but this wasn’t some mystic notion of fate giving him comfort; no, it was faith, the same kind of faith he had in math and science, that even if he couldn’t see it or feel it, there was a predictable law governing the universe, a possible answer that was findable, knowable. Dr. Strange knew reality in a different language, that was all, and the wizard had seen a future where they could win; his actions had ensured this was the future where they would win; if their winning was therefore inevitable, then Tony couldn’t fail.
With their usual affectionate rivalry, Hope and Natasha immediately clashed over who could get into Stone’s basement first. Seeing no reason to pick a side, Steve assigned them both to the primary team, with Scott and Clint for backup. Vision shared some careful doubts regarding his current combat abilities, the Pym-miniaturized arc reactor in his head glowing a steady blue, but pairing him with Wanda was an easy solve. Steve placed the two on the secondary team with Sam and Rhodey to handle any secondary missions. Bruce would remain with Thor in Norway, overseeing the feast.
There often came a single pivotal moment in a battle, an invisible tipping point where an inevitable chain of outcomes could be set in motion, the two sides pushed into adopting positions that would inexorably lead one to victory and one to defeat. Mostly this involved inspiring doubt in the other side, doubt that they could still win, doubt that there was any more reason to try. Quality of tactics and supplies would only go so far. Steve had always known that strength of purpose in the face of doubt could make the biggest difference.
However… assuming a scenario where Steve was suffering complications of the feelings, but he really didn’t know how Tony felt… might he have dismissed that second kiss as just the heat of the moment? Or worse, some kind of pity move? A strategic retreat would then make sense, and simple embarrassment could also explain the super-soldier’s distant behavior towards him.
you do?” he growled. “Can you figure out a way to go back thirty years and tell my parents not to get in that car? Better yet, can you go back seventy years and stop Barnes falling off that train? Yeah, didn’t think so. But you’re better at
. “Contrary to popular assumption,” he murmured against Tony’s lips, “casual sex was not invented in the sixties. I’ve slept with men before, Tony. Women too.” He drew back a little, the confident smirk back on his face. “But when it comes to the act of sucking dick specifically,” and a low Brooklyn drawl slipped into his voice as he nuzzled Tony’s shoulder, “let me tell ya, on all the tours, across multiple continents,” Steve paused, dipped his tongue into the hollow of Tony’s throat, “I got nothin’ but rave reviews.” Then he flashed a flawless all-American grin that, when connected to those abs and that dick, was just not
“I never meant to- to freeze you out, Tony,” he said, selecting his words carefully. “I thought you stayed away because you didn’t want to work with me. I only accepted it because I thought it was your choice. But I give you my word, none of us want you off the team. If anything, it’s the opposite.” He hesitated. “We miss you.”
, near Steve. It’d be enough just to talk to him. Have Steve talk back. Ideally, enough so Tony could understand exactly what he’d done wrong; at least this time he had a fair idea of how badly he’d misread the whole situation, but verification was required, if only so he could make sure he never, ever did it again. But at this point, awkward small talk about the Wakandan sandwiches would do.
to get him to use it. Ironically, most of the time I couldn't get him to shut the hell up, but this one little word he kept on refusing to say. It was entertaining, if ultimately pointless. As you can see, I broke him eventually.” He paused. “Truly my finest work.”
, is the thing, which is why neither of them are ready, the third time. Tony even laughs. But it’s true. They climb almost to the top. Tony hides his face behind the suit. Hiding his disappointment, Steve thinks. Tony lets Steve walk on ahead. Letting him go, Steve thinks. He stumbles, numb, and Tony catches him. He wonders whether Tony would carry him, if he asked. Then he has to sit, because he thinks, yes, Tony would. And that’s enough. He cries. Tony holds him close, lets him fall apart. Then Steve stands. Tony waits. It’s everything.
Really, it was almost irrelevant, he chided himself. He wasn’t here about the kiss. Steve was here to make amends, and that began with accepting that Tony had good reason to be angry. To be hurt. The kiss, however nonsensical, could turn out to be the least of Steve’s mistakes.
“Stark.” Wilson stepped through the portal, then hesitated. “Tony. I know you promised Steve you wouldn’t leave, but you know he wasn’t in his right mind, we’re gonna need all hands on deck in Wakanda, Steve will understand-”
- yet they were all fighting to their limits, every single second treading the edge between victory and disaster.
Steve had no idea what he was talking about. “If I care…?” He sucked in a breath, suddenly sick with dread. “What happened to Rhodey?”
When he was first rescued from the ice, people with kind faces kept asking him how much he remembered of the crash. Whether he had been awake when he’d hit the water. If he’d felt the ice. Steve had told them he’d been knocked out on impact, that he hadn’t felt the water rise, that he’d slept through the ice.
“But there’s no need to rush,” Ty said. “Word is the festivities will go on for days. And we also have something to celebrate.”
Driven to fury by the loss of Loki, Thor traveled from Nowhere to Nidalvallir in search of a weapon worthy of vengeance, accompanied by Rocket and Groot. The Valkyrie and the remaining Guardians set off for Earth as quickly as they could, but the message they sent ahead, warning that Thanos now possessed the Space Stone, arrived ten minutes too late.
After Wanda and Vision had volunteered to take their off-world allies back to the Compound, the remnants of the team had settled into the waiting room, too battle-sapped to move. Considering six hours ago he’d died, then an hour ago he’d woken up semi-clothed in a hospital bed amid a choir of shrieking nurses, Steve didn’t mind staying put for a while. Apparently, his attempted resurrection had been initially judged a failure, so as a sign of respect, some of the staff had taken it upon themselves to clean and dress the body. Alerted by the screams, Peter had tried to fill him in on everything he’d missed, but Steve had flung on a shirt and insisted they find Tony instead.
“Our fight isn’t over,” Tony said. He looked around, meeting everyone’s eyes, willing them to believe. “There is still a way to win.”
“One second.” Tony kissed Steve on the cheek, then turned to confront Ty, his fists clenching tighter at every step. The normally pristine man had been reduced to a trembling mess, but of course, his ego forced him to his feet at Tony’s approach.
But even that tiny spark of possibility led his thoughts down dark paths, because soon it wouldn’t matter anyway. Soon, Steve would erase this aberrant future, and if by some miracle he survived, he would have to live on in a shiny happy world with a spiteful Tony who still wanted to hate his guts, from whom Steve might never receive a second chance. If there had been some sort of complication growing between them… If Tony told him how he felt… Would it be cruel to let Steve know just what he would be erasing?
Events moved quickly after that. While Peter went to find his aunt and the three doctors, Tony reached Strange, who opened a portal so the whole team could confer. Tony had just brought them up to speed on Steve’s condition when Peter and Steve’s medical team returned.
“Roger that, Khaleesi,” Tony said, then winced. The silly nickname he’d used to call her was no longer appropriate for the reigning Queen of Wakanda.
“We decided to give you an epidural to control your pain,” Helen explained. “That means we put medication in your spine that will block the pain signals reaching the brain. You will feel numb everywhere below your arms, but don’t worry, the effect is only temporary, and you should find it much more comfortable to breathe from now on. Can you lift your arms for me?”
Despite his best efforts, his breathing was beginning to unravel when Barton suddenly barked at everyone to shut up. The archer had already drawn his bow, arrow ready and pointed to an empty corner of the room. A tiny yellow ring of light had appeared and now widened rapidly, the golden circle throwing sparks as it grew.
He could already tell that Tony wasn’t going to let it go, that it was only a matter of time now before his genius mind figured it out, and maybe it would be good if Tony knew that Steve could be okay without him. Then Tony wouldn’t feel pressured to stay. Freedom was important. Steve kept his eyes squeezed closed, weary. Duty was the cold place.
From what Steve could see, the Doctor was appreciative of the experience, his answering smile slow and soft. But then his cape twitched oddly and he immediately looked in Steve’s direction, an emotion Steve couldn’t read flashing across his face.
“It’s not rocket science, Cap,” the other man said lightly. “Although if it was, you’d be in luck, cos I’m excellent at that too.” He paused, then asked. “Do you want to touch me?”
“I just like when you talk,” Steve said, then closed his eyes. Even through his weariness, he felt the blush rise in his cheeks, a weakness he blamed on his impaired state.
“If he does, he didn’t show it,” Tony said, but his thoughts were racing. “Not to me, anyway.” Which hurt, a lot, because Tony had been consistently open about his bisexuality his whole adult life, certainly the whole time he’d known Steve. After the Accords fallout, he’d actually wondered if that had maybe offended the super-soldier’s old-fashioned sensibilities, had been another of his oblivious transgressions that had kept Steve apart from him, adding yet another issue to the list of topics which deserved a direct conversation between them.
“Great, thanks,” Steve answered. “Although I wasn’t really hungry.” Which was true. And not. The serum pangs were always there. Unseen. Not really his.
“Excellent,” Tiberius said, but he was irritated, Tony could tell. “We’ll have an extra invite printed. It was a pleasure meeting you at last, Bruce, but Tony and I really need to get going. Long drive home.”
“You can maybe eat my ass, Sesame Street,” Stark shot back, and with a blue flash, Iron Man was gone.
After a subdued breakfast, Steve’s official permission to leave the Compound - a ridiculous limitation Tony was going to
Unbelievable, that it had taken him this long to notice her engagement ring was gone. Nowhere to be seen. And cruelly, when he looked down, neither was his. Panic rose within him, mixed with other emotions he struggled to identify; sorrow of course, shame. Anger was in there, too; it seemed he could never come home after all, that Thanos had - even now - robbed him of the life he’d once lived for. But maybe, in some exhausted, unspeakable corner… relief.
As the minutes snarled into hours, he pitched his every thought against the silence, watching Steve cling to the thread of his voice despite the worsening cough, the growing rattle in his chest, the fever sweat on his brow. On and on, Tony spoke, without pause, baring his soul without any care for the medical team’s presence. Steve needed his words, he knew; silence was danger, and so he kept chattering, on and on. Before Ty, he would have easily gone on for hours. These days, he was not prepared, but even as his voice began to fade into a painful rasp, Tony refused to quit, finding himself lapsing into Italian lullabies, raking his memory for the childhood comforts he’d once flung aside in furious grief.
Wrong, thought Steve, in sudden bone-wrenching exhaustion. There was no help. No oasis. No hope. Nothing.
“What! Excuse you, I don’t nap,” he snapped, sitting bolt upright as if to prove it. Wait, the air kinda felt a bit cold now, how was it cold now?
Tony had cried then, but Steve had held him together, easy. After so many weeks spent up close, the man was beginning to make more sense to Steve. He understood now that Tony’s worst battles were always against himself, his most vicious wounds self-inflicted. Memories of before flooded Steve with bitter regret for all the ways he too had insisted that Tony fight himself, fix himself. He hadn’t been close enough to see, then. As if he’d been judging a painting based on a montage of cheap partial photographs, he’d let himself be fooled by the clashing perspectives, the lack of focus; he’d spent years refusing to acknowledge the artistry before him, until some weird twist of circumstance allowed him to get close enough to correct his mistake. Let him stay close enough for long enough to appreciate the details without losing his overall perspective, an appreciation that over the weeks built towards awe.
Outside, their car was untouched, save for the two assassins now adorning the bonnet. “All good?” Clint drawled, eyeing them both carefully.
He could hear himself panting, sobbing, moaning Steve’s name in a babble of nonsense but nothing needed to make sense because Steve was gripping him now in one hand, holding Tony together while licking the tip of his cock, teasing him, testing him and then Steve’s mouth had lifted away - fuck, no,
And with a sudden desperate shock, Tony thought there could be nothing in the world he would ever love more than this man in this moment. Nothing he’d ever wanted more, than to grant his request.
Every morning, Steve would get up when Tony woke and make him coffee; he didn’t really see why the billionaire needed the boost if he was getting enough sleep, but Tony insisted he liked the taste, so eventually they had compromised, a process also known as Steve giving in to whatever Tony wanted.
Tony held Steve close as he cried, soothing as Steve’s sobbing slid into laughter and back, the other man struggling to speak over his own tears. “I’m not even sad,” Steve choked out eventually. “I don’t know why I’m crying, I- it’s so stupid, I’m not sad, I’m not…” He managed to take a breath, looked up, tried to smile. “Really Tony, I think I… this is the happiest I’ve ever been.”
The meeting moved on, but Steve didn’t hear a further word that was said. Stark was staying on in New York, so he would be on Steve’s team. They would have to work together. Stark would have to speak to him. Why on earth would the other man want that? Steve flicked his glance sideways. The ludicrous sunglasses hid a lot, but in truth, Stark looked awful, like he hadn’t slept at all.
For an endless moment, Tony struggled to comprehend such a question; a fish asked to define the sea. He concentrated again on the steering wheel beneath his hands, as if there was some clue buried there that could save him. “…yes.”
At his side, May grunted like she’d been gut-punched; Tony just peered up at the kid, a vague part of him screaming in protest but unable to find the words to match.
Steve loses his breath, loses all thought, finds himself slumped on the floor with a circle of worried faces around him. He apologizes but the faces stay with him. They think he’s a soldier returned fresh from a war and he laughs, bitter, because in truth he would give anything to have a war to return to instead of the empty peace awaiting him, anything for another chance, just one chance to make things right-
- to hide his satisfaction. “All great,” he answered, then looked to Natasha. “Nice trick with the card,” he told her.
- have our legal team working on swinging a pardon for Barnes outta that.” He slung his overheated plate onto the table and sat, gesturing for Steve to take the opposite chair. “T’Challa also corroborated the Siberia threat, so your merry band of renegades have been released from the Raft and are on their way home, now that Wanda’s visa has finally come through.”
Tony was first off the plane, throwing himself into greeting his teammates, a wisecrack here, a nudge there. As usual, there was no sign of
…and then Clint is close to the edge, too close and he’s saying goodbye and neither of them can get to him in time, he falls and the light flares and when they wake up Nat is holding the Soul Stone and sobbing, the gem Steve had carried nowhere to be seen. He walks her to the ship where she kisses him goodbye, dry and dusty on the cheek, and she’s already grim with all the grief that is to come yet still resolute, still strong, and he cries again when she leaves because it will never be him that she comes home to, never again his Nat who comes home.
They had talked for hours, after. Ideas, plans, hopes. Stepping up, as he always did, Steve had badgered and commanded every one of them to contribute, despite the shock and disappointment that circled just beyond the campfire, and as he always did, the Captain carried them through the long night. Tony hadn’t said much. It was too hard to think, echoes of laughter in his head. Steve hadn’t pushed. He was the only one Steve hadn’t pushed. Instead, Steve had let Tony stay curled quietly against his side; in exchange he’d listened, and he’d mostly kept up, and even said some things towards the end. Throughout the hours he’d also watched the trees, had studied the way the firelight danced against the restless foliage, tossing and turning as if the air itself was a living thing, wild and free.
Steve’s impossible headache had returned and he scrubbed at his face with both hands, irritated at his own self-pity. He had to stop obsessing over the past and start thinking through his current situation while he had the time.
It was too late, he realized. The Tony who would have argued with her, who would have fought for her, the man she deserved: he was six months gone, wiped out with the snap of a madman’s fingers. Pepper, alive, was already a gift beyond measure. He could survive letting her go.
“Pretty sure that’s the cat guy again,” Bucky called over his shoulder. And on closer inspection he was right.
Moving didn’t hurt, though he felt it should. He sat up in the shallow water, ignoring the Soul Stone in his hand, letting it fall into the water at his feet. Not yet. Not that. Instead, he hugged his knees and stared up at the alien sky. He felt neither warm, nor cold. There was no pain, nor fear. The glass was intact; nothing lay beyond. The Captain had been prepared, had whispered of disaster since Steve first stepped through the portal and saw the empty sky overhead, cold dark blotting out the sun. The Captain had kept watch for ambush. Steve was the one who’d failed, staggering slow and clumsy through shock after shock. Cracks, he thought. Cracks through glass, or was it the ice he could feel, still surrounding him. Destroying. Creating.
At Schmidt’s words, Steve felt a rush of strange ecstasy; the Soul Stone at his feet flashed a warm orange, then rose out of the water to hover before the faceless man. Schmidt held out his hands, addressing the Stone with a holy reverence. “All these years, I believed you to be my jailer. But what a gift you gave me; at long last, I understand.”
Listening to Tony’s laughter, Steve felt a danger too deep and awful to name. The other man was now listing to one side, hand reaching for the nearest wall, the suit’s mechanics whirring frantically as if trying to hold him together. Steve reached out, trembling with the need to help or fix or save,
. “I honestly never imagined it would be you, Steve, but I think it’s about six months too late for anyone to object. And at least, if it’s you, I know he won’t be alone, you’ll be right there fighting beside him-”
Tony and Shuri spent the rest of their free time on equipment upgrades for the team, which felt just like old times. Based on his previous experience with Thanos, Tony also added a few tweaks to the nanobots and tripled their reservoir count, which meant the temporary arc reactor he kept installed on his chest felt almost as heavy as the old implanted one. The familiar weight felt comforting somehow. The first night after, Steve claimed he could hear the reactor’s inner workings, which Tony supposed was possible; thankfully Steve also said he liked the hum. Removing it every evening would have been a pain.
Two years later, almost to the day, Thanos wipes New York off the face of the Earth with the Power Stone, then fights his way to seize the Mind Stone from Vision. They watch the Mad Titan crumble into dust, neutralized, but too late. Such cost. Steve takes a break from the team, spends months looking for Bucky in all the worst places. Tony shows up in Madripoor, cheerfully insisting Steve comes home for Christmas. For the wedding.
“A snapshot of the infinite possibilities contained within just one single moment in time,” the Ancient One says, tilting her face towards a radiant sky. She sounds distant, amused. “And since there are infinite possible moments, across an infinitely chaotic universe, then I ask you, Steve Rogers - what real difference could your interference make?”
May stepped up again, his smooth and professional friend. “We’ll keep you updated if anything changes, of course.”
“Nonetheless,” he said, and shrugged. She neither argued nor threatened him, which was her equivalent of a thank-you bouquet.
Beside him, Clint cleared his throat. Steve frowned down at his tablet, trying to look preoccupied despite reading the same sentence over and over. The archer never had forgiven Stark for leaving his team-mates behind on the Raft, however brief a stay it had turned out to be. More damaging had been the year of parole that had followed, forcing Clint to stay estranged from his family or risk revealing their existence to Ross. Difficult as Stark could be, Steve thought the archer’s reaction was unfair. Maybe even petty. But despite Steve’s recurrent attempts to resolve the issue, Clint still leaped on any opportunity to vent his bitterness towards the billionaire; the meeting yesterday was just the latest example.
“No, it’s fine, I just…” He shook his head. “I definitely think you scared the shit out of him, if that was the plan.”
He dismissed the armor and crouched in place at the water’s edge, a position that thankfully concealed… the situation. They’d long perfected this maneuver after so many weeks of water duty. Steve lowered the container towards the water, Tony guided it towards the clearest water he could see, watching out for mud or small creatures. Once it was full, Steve pulled it out again. Simple. Ridiculous, really. It really didn’t take two people. Steve could do this blindfolded with one hand tied-
The billionaire was smirking at him when he looked up. “See? Anti-climax,” Tony remarked, then ducked away laughing as Steve reached out to cover his mouth. Safely beyond his reach, Tony activated his wrist device and began his report to a tiny holographic Shuri.
May intercepted the dubious offering, laying it on a nearby table. “Let’s hold off on that for a minute. I need to ask Tony some questions about how he’s feeling first.”
Natasha narrowed her eyes, still inscrutable. “And why would you send him, instead of going yourself?”
Tony froze, then broke away from the other two, quickly covering the ground between him and the tall blond man. “Ty, darling, what are you doing here?” he asked, plastering a smile on his face.
Bruce frowned. “Uh, okay, but who else would you- wait, did you two finally…?” And then, in nightmarish slow motion, he gestured towards Rogers and began to smile as if-
“Ah, hey Tony, sorry to miss you again. Uh, so, good news, the kid has officially completed the last training protocol, so May is arranging a small dinner as a celebration kind of thing. I think he’d like it if you could be there. Uh, and she’d invited me too, since… Well, I guess you’d say we’re dating now? I know, big surprise but, uh. It’s been pretty great. Ah, so it’d just be the four of us, for dinner, probably at their place. But, uh, May would really like to sit down with you first, I know things were a bit rough when she first found out about Germany but I guess seeing the kid in action, she’s a bit less…”
“Peter,” May whispered, and Tony felt a distant blast of relief, that she could be the one to talk the kid out of this madness.
“I’m sorry,” Vision told her. “There will likely be significant changes, even with total success. For one, I expect to lose most of my combat abilities. Yet the risk to life everywhere is too great, otherwise.”
His heart plummeted, a spectacularly physical sensation. “It’s okay, Tony,” Steve said heavily, suddenly grateful for how the mask was obscuring his face. “You don’t have to… I know you don’t feel the same way. I’m sorry, you don’t have to say anything-”
There was a pause. “So I see. Apologies for my indiscretion, Stark. You may be heartened to hear that I have brought mighty reinforcements to bolster your planet’s defenses, including a Valkyrie of legend, Heimdall the All-Seeing and a certain blue cube you may remember. Uh. Plus a few others who can fight and stuff, may be of use. But in exchange for this assistance, I would ask that Earth grant refuge to the rest of my people, for most on this ship are no warriors. They are farmers and craftsfolk, scholars and healers, children and families, peaceful souls who lost all but their lives in the destruction of Asgard.”
“I could never make it fit,” Steve said, amazed by his own emerging certainty. The giddy, overwhelming
“Yeah, I’ll bet,” Tony muttered. He put his head in his hands as if rallying the energy to stand up. Preparing to leave.
Realization punched right through Steve’s happiness. Only once, had Tony returned to the Compound in those first six months. “I… I remember. We fought.” In fact, Steve’s stupid heart had leapt to see the man, despite their mutual betrayal, and he’d had to force himself to stay aloof by taking refuge in his leadership role.
That truth was devastating, simple, and unfair in a way he loathed, because it meant they could both try, and try, and still they might fail.
Tony pressed a long kiss to his lips, hoping to distract him. “Enough to make me wanna take you home right now.”
“Thank god, I’m starving,” the other man said, then turned his back on Steve and began foraging, chattering as he did. “So T’Challa handed over Zemo to Ross, but he’s headed back to Wakanda with Barnes now.” He slammed the door of the microwave a little harder than necessary. “He took Rhodey with him, if you even care.”
He tried to stand but collapsed forward, only Rhodey’s quick intervention stopping him from sliding right off the couch.
!” the other man yelled, leaping to his feet. But to Steve’s horror, Tony wavered as if he would fall, only a quick grab at the chair saving his balance. Too late; instinctively, Steve had tried to sit up, to go to him, but the first slight motion summoned the shrieking agony in his chest, the reality of his injuries smashing him flat.
Nebula had heard their voices and returned. She held out the Gauntlet. “Do you need this?” The Captain considered the offer. The item was designed to hold the Infinity Stones, after all. Yet the way Red Skull had addressed the Soul Stone suggested it had some form of awareness; also he had been holding it in his bare hand when he’d regained consciousness.
Warring expressions clashed across Tony’s face. “Steve…” The other man’s features settled into raw disbelief. “
Trapped somewhere behind enemy lines, Steve snatched a breath and charged forth blindly. “I was scared of what it would do to us.” He blinked, thrown by the odd phrasing. “To the team, I mean,” he rushed to clarify. “If I’d told you and you’d gone after him, we would have had to stop you. I couldn’t take the risk.”
He’d sat by Peggy’s bedside all night, listening to her rasping breath. At some point Steve had fallen asleep, and when he woke he’d lost his grip on where he was. When he was. For a minute, he was that angry kid again, ordering his mother to keep fighting even as her disease stole the very air from her lungs, helpless to do anything but watch her drown.
But instead she just studied his face, her gentleness somehow more devastating. “What happened with Steve, Tony?”
,” Steve said, feeling faint, then stopped, confused. He had grabbed Tony by the shoulders. He hadn’t meant to grab Tony by the shoulders. At any rate, in the suit the other man shrugged him off easily and stood. Looking at him again. Glaring.
The shattered man before him now… This was a side of Tony that Steve had never imagined. A loss of control that Steve would never have believed
A fuzzy-edged Tony had taken his hand again, and Steve looked away for some strategic blinking. “If the serum can fix people…” he started.
Wanda would be in Wakanda, Tony realized. And Barton, ugh. But there was no way he was staying in New York under Rogers’ supervision, so he turned to Bruce, hoping to recruit at least one friendly face. “Hey Brucie bear, you up for a road trip?”
Once they had secured their own version of the Gauntlet and had set a reasonable date for the assault on Titan, the team had allowed themselves one long day to argue over who should take the risk of wielding it once they successfully retrieve the Infinity Stones. Rocket’s past experience with the Power Stone had convinced Tony to back Thor as the only possible candidate until Nebula silenced them all with a powerful speech listing everything Thanos had done to her over the years. It was agreed then that she had the right to attempt the Gauntlet first, with Thor on standby if it proved too dangerous for the android. Thankfully, Steve had quit trying to volunteer by that point. Super-serum or not, there was zero chance Tony was letting him anywhere near that thing.
“A full day and a half,” came an answer from across the lab. Shuri was sitting at a large and complicated-looking interface, her rapid movements suggesting she was busy. “Which is almost insulting, given how good I am at fixing you white boys. There were a couple times you tried to die on me.” She paused long enough to glance over her shoulder. “Don’t try it again.”
Instead he opened his eyes, looked to Steve, saw; and there in Steve he found a universe that had been right side up all along, found a math that finally, miraculously, ran true; only then arrived the name for what he was feeling; then, heart and mind, he knew.
But Steve tensed, his good cheer evaporating, because instead, he had led them both straight into Zemo’s trap.
Here it is, he thought, even as he leapt forward, even as he swung his arm up, even as he knew his shield would not, could not get there in time. God, no, please not him, he thought, and he kept thinking it, praying even as the hot blood ran, even as Clint’s ready arrow thudded home through Thanos’ wrist, even as Thor dragged the laughing Titan further away with a wordless roar of fury, even through Thanos’ repeated shouts; “I should have killed you, Stark. I should have killed you too.”
“They said it was quick,” Tony says through the sobs. “That she didn’t suffer.” He’s shaking from worse than the cold, but Steve pulls the blanket off the couch and wraps him up anyway. “But she
Stark was talking excitedly “-and apparently he can see any living person in the universe, no matter where they are. Thor says his father took him in when he was young but he already had the gift, they never did figure out where it came from-”
“-still refusing to contact the pilot, they’re saying that because Cho’s plane will land in two hours it doesn’t qualify as an emergency. But her assistant is already on his way to meet her at the airport, once she’s on the ground he will make sure she calls, then a helicopter will bring them straight here.”
Tony looked up at him, eyes blazing behind the plastic visor, courage and fear entwined. “That night… it meant a lot, okay? I just… I didn’t expect it, any of it. The whole thing felt like a dream… but I fucked it up so it didn’t matter what you thought of me, it was easier to let you believe whatever you wanted-” The other man broke off, shaking his head; Steve squeezed his hand in support.
“Tony? I think you’re going into shock,” he heard Steve say. Made sense. There seemed to be an initial bombardment of energy following the installation of each Stone, then things evened out; Steve’s body could heal, in between, but Tony had no such protection. His time was running out.
“Ohhhh, I have a bad feeling about this,” Tony muttered, but he had nothing else to try. First, he reinforced his suit to keep the purple energy from touching his own unprotected flesh. He lifted Steve and sat behind him, cradling the super-soldier in his lap. Then he dismissed his right glove, and gently slipped his bare hand inside the Gauntlet as far as he could.
Steve felt the ground lurch under him and he staggered back, grabbing at the countertop behind him for support. “How is he?”
, Steve, and then they were kissing again, skin on heated skin, and it was both too much and not enough. Tony wanted to stay just like this forever but also wanted to break away because they were just
His heart could hold no mercy.“Steve, it’s okay,” he said. “You’re gonna be okay. And I’ll be right here when you wake up.”
Eventually Stark slammed to his feet to leave the room, but at that very moment the public alert went off, signalling yet another alien arrival.
He travels first to 2012, to the bruising shudders of New York under siege. Bruce had made a promise, and Steve Rogers was made to keep promises. He’s too early; this world’s Loki still roams free. Bruce is still on the roof. Steve waits til she’s alone before he steps out. She turns to face him, fire in the sky behind her.
“Yikes,” Tony sighed. “But that’s great news. Cracking Erskine’s formula won’t be easy, but having the original herb on hand should knock a few days off the job. You good with staying on in Wakanda for a bit?”
“I never told him how I felt,” he says eventually. “It was never… There was just never a good time. Not for us. And for a long time I was so sure he already knew. But now… I don’t think he did. I think it might have changed everything, if he’d known.” Steve shivers, remembering the cold after the battlefield. “Losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to live through. Much worse than losing half the universe. I know it’s selfish, but I couldn’t bear the thought that he died thinking we were just colleagues. Barely even friends. When truth was, he meant the world to me.”
Steve just sighed, and Tony wondered what the super-soldier was thinking, but he didn’t share. Instead, Steve got to his feet, Tony following suit, their hands now fused together at a strained angle. The super-soldier studied the newly reshaped Gauntlet, Tony standing awkwardly behind him. It wasn’t lost on Tony that Steve was even now avoiding his gaze. His fuckup on Vormir was clearly still in play, and there was no reason for that to hurt so much, but it did.
It was too much; the strands of memory all began to blur together, the relentless joy soaring high, almost unbearable in its vastness, then swooping low, collapsing him in towards some uncontrollable, explosive conclusion- “
After their meeting concluded that an attack on Titan had their best chance of success, Thor traveled to Nidavallir and spoke with the one surviving dwarf, who confirmed he could make them a new Gauntlet given adequate assistance. The lab crew had subsequently spent an eventful week there, with Thor ferrying them back and forth every morning and evening. Steve had complained about this, loudly, but so long as Tony came home every night, he had eventually agreed to stay on Earth to work on collaborative battle strategies with Rhodey and the rest.
- and he makes his decision, knowing fully what it means. Accepting the cost. He springs to his feet, scattering the faces but unable to care, his whole being seized with new incandescent purpose. He strides to Pym’s laboratory, locking out the raised voices scrambling in his wake, and takes what he needs.
. He scrubbed the tears away, trying to avoid Bucky’s gaze but unable to ignore the sympathetic hand still on his shoulder. Of course. He must have seen… whatever the fuck that was. At least Steve compulsively humiliating himself in front of Bucky was nothing new. If anything, it was positively nostalgic.
“Thanks,” Tony said. “And, you know. For saving my life.” On Titan and after, any hint of sentiment had earned him a warning look or worse from the android, but she accepted his words now with a nod.
The secret launch the previous week had also gone smoothly, the system’s operations requiring little real input from Tony or Shuri in the days since. Thus far things had been, as Shuri had alluded to earlier, kinda boring.
Steering. Right. The billionaire shook his head, and ruthlessly brought his errant thoughts back under control. Not Steve’s fault. Momentary lapse.
Less than a minute later, Tony found himself slammed into the cracked road, all air knocked from his lungs, dazzling sparks skating across his vision. Thanos was leaning over him, grinning. Unable to sit up, unable to even suck in a breath, Tony dismissed his visor and spat at his smug face, which only provoked the alien to further amusement.
The ship’s ramp was lowering, and Tony squinted against the harsh noon sunlight. Time to find out who else he’d lost. It felt like the worst kind of Christmas, he could almost laugh. Then the ramp hit the ground and the gloomy ship was overrun - was that a raccoon? - and suddenly Rhodey - Jesus, Rhodey - was there and alive and wrapping his arms around Tony and there too was Nat and Bruce and Clint and then, somehow, Tony was laughing even as he was crying because out there on Titan he’d had dreams where he came home to find nothing but dust and instead somehow, even now, he had people.
Freed from the churn of his own thoughts, he could now hear the intermittent soft murmurs of Tony’s voice from some other room, too distant to make out the words but close enough to be a comfort. Buoyant with released tension, Steve tried to imagine how this week would have differed if Tony had been the one in danger. If it had been Tony needing Steve to risk everything and go on the run. He would have, Steve knew. He should explain that too. It wouldn’t have differed at all. Steve would have fought the world to protect Tony, just as he had for Bucky. And he had no doubt Tony would have done the same for him.
idea, was too much, was too soon, that he should wait until Steve was in a better headspace, until they both were - Tony was dropping the shoe and closing the remaining distance between them, was reaching for Steve, was kissing Steve as if it meant life itself. Because it did, it
In contrast, the power of the Time Stone was so unthinkably vast that it could instead rewind all branches of time simultaneously, not just for one person, but
The youth of today had no respect. “Questions regarding my personal life are still a hard nope.” Tony’s grin was a polite wall of teeth.
“Well, I’d hate to miss the big moment,” he says before the grief rises in his throat, a kaleidoscope of moments lost, words unspoken.
The Captain dismissed the idea. “Not a priority,” he said. Stark looked wounded. A mistake, to alienate an asset; the Captain adjusted his tone. “Perhaps later.” Stark nodded eventually.
He could hear Steve screaming from outside the lab so Tony already knew it was bad, but seeing him was infinitely worse. The super-soldier had already installed three Stones on the Gauntlet and was now slumped to the floor, writhing in agony as their pulses of light twisted under his skin; orange, blue and red. As Tony arrived, the others were just inside the door, trying to reach Steve, but not even Thor could break through the whirling aura of energy that surrounded him. As they watched, helpless, the super-soldier clamped his jaw and began struggling to his feet as if to continue.
“Couldn’t you ask Doctor Strange to give him some?” Tony looked up. Blinked. Peter’s voice faltered slightly under his stare. “I just- I mean- you said before he had something called the Time Stone, so maybe there’s some way he could help?”
Stark blinked. “That is literally just what I-” He turned back to Rhodey. “Isn’t that just what I said?” The Colonel shushed him.
Too miserable to wait, Steve moved to kneel beside the distraught man and reached for Tony’s shoulder, desperately searching his mind for a way to apologize. Again, Tony went to push him away, but this time there was no real strength in the gesture, making it one Steve could easily overcome if he tried.
Steve froze, Nebula gasped, and an electric thrill ran over Tony’s skin, equal parts fear and hope. “How?” he managed, his words thick. “Why?”
Even at his most useless, Steve couldn’t remember ever feeling this weak, this foolish. “Tony, I- I’m sorry, I don’t know why I did that, I didn’t mean to-”
The other man had removed the rest of his armor, and the bruises revealed on his face and arms were already turning a wicked purple. Before Steve could gather the nerve to say anything, Tony had crossed to the kitchen area and opened the door to a concealed freezer, retrieving a set of ice packs with a horrible air of routine. Steve stood still and watched, knowing there was nothing to do or say that would help. Every time he thought of another way to apologize, he could already hear in his head exactly how Tony would shut him down, would twist the knife or, worse, just shrug at him, unmoved. So he waited, ready.
okay?” he asked. The video had been hard enough for Tony to watch, but Bucky would always be Hydra’s first and worst victim.
Happy paused. “I think she has some things to say that you might wanna hear, so… Anyway it won’t be for another couple of weeks, I’m on that Australia trip with Pepper first but soon as I get back, I’ll let you know what day she’s thinking…” Another pause. “I know you’re busy but I really hope you can make it this time, it would mean a lot to the kid. And it’s been… It’d just be good to see you, Tony. Uh. Okay, bye.”
His breath shuddered once, then his chest tightened, and Steve recognized the once-familiar signs of an asthma attack, the air itself becoming his enemy, panic and rage and sorrow charging in behind. He gasped harder, hearing himself wheeze, he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t- he couldn’t-
Taken altogether, it was more good news than Tony could handle. More reward than he could ever deserve. It was a mistake, he knew, to take so much more than his due, but he didn’t know how to give it back. Maybe it wouldn’t matter. All he could do was enjoy this one golden moment, treasure it and tuck its memory away for future, duller days, because that much he did know. Happiness was not sustainable. Sooner or later, the debt would come due.
“Speed, strength, healing, all physical measurements showed drastic improvement, far beyond the range of normal human activity. And to a lesser extent, there was a boost to mental acuity, memory retention, cognitive processing. His subsequent training improved the numbers even further, but by every measure I can think of, the herb made him superhuman overnight.” Shuri dismissed the displayed numbers and glanced at Steve. “Any of this sounding familiar?”
. The Accords would take away his ability to help people, so Steve had left the team. Then he needed to protect Bucky, so he’d gone on the run. To get to Siberia in time, he’d had to fight. Taken altogether, everything was a mess, but step by step, it still felt like he’d done the right thing. Even kissing Sharon had felt necessary, in an awkward farewell-and-thank-you sort of way.
“Just you,” Steve whispered. “Only you. Please.” He heard muttered voices around him, then Bucky and Sam were gone, and it was just Steve and Tony, Tony who was still with him, still there. For a long minute they sat quietly together on the floor, limbs entwined, and it should have been peaceful but Steve could still feel his mind dripping away, sliding deeper into some unfathomable abyss, an opposite sky into which he could sink and lose himself, filling with emptiness forever and ever. Some distant part of him admired the irony that, of all things, he might be running out of time; then the sick stab of panic arrived, and he sat bolt upright to look Tony in the eye.
Wilson and Strange were already there but Tony ignored them both, collapsing to his knees when he landed because it was worse, it was even worse than he’d feared. One entire side of Rogers’ chest was misshapen, nearly caved in, and his every breath brought red froth to his lips. He looked so odd and tiny and fragile, skinny limbs neat under the ballooning fabric, his body now drowning in the uniform that only minutes ago had fit like a second skin. But his
so,” Nat groaned as Rhodey facepalmed theatrically. “Tony, have you ever explained to Steve using actual human words what he means to you?”
Countless seconds later, the door to his room opened; Steve wearily opened his eyes to whatever medical torment that promised. Yet Dr Palmer wasn’t alone. A second suited figure was approaching his bedside, dark eyes bright behind his full-face visor.
It was a strange mix of novel and familiar, but after six weeks, this new routine felt soothing in a way Steve wasn’t sure he deserved.
The plan had not changed much since the evening before, but for the sake of the newer faces in the room, each team’s leader would talk everyone through their preparations in full detail. Steve spoke about the preparations in New York, then sat so whoever was leading the Wakanda team could take the floor. Like everyone else, he’d assumed that would be Stark - old habits, Steve supposed - but when everyone looked to him, the billionaire was just staring at the floor. There was an awkward pause before Rhodey gently nudged him with an elbow.
Nebula scowled, still her habitual reaction to any perceived friendliness. “I have not requested your presence on this mission.”
Yet as they emerged into the daylight’s snow-magnified glare, Steve spotted Tony confronting a shadowy figure standing inside the hold of a second, unfamiliar ship parked near the Quinjet. Immediately his instincts rocketed towards full alert, his body preparing for imminent danger.
The blonde doctor eyed the increased beeping of the machines. “Tell you what, Captain Rogers,” she said. “Give us twenty minutes and he’ll be right back to sit with you. Okay?”
me. It’s what he does, Captain, you know that. He took your heart and smashed it, just because he could.” There was something broken in his laugh. Something dangerous. “How much time did you waste hating yourself when you should have been hating
“We’ll be landing in five minutes,” Okoye swiveled around in her seat to tell him. “The alien ship will land approximately ten minutes later.”
Across the room, Shuri and T’Challa had been conferring quietly. “If you agree,” Shuri spoke up, turning towards Vision, “I would like to attempt the extraction back in Wakanda. My laboratory is the best equipped to analyze the Mind Stone, plus I may have an idea about a replacement power source that would preserve some of your abilities.”
Steve keeps his eyes closed, breathing in Tony’s words, breathing out all the sorrow he’d borne since this day, what feels like a lifetime ago. He hears the lakewater lapping at the shore, feels the solid earth below him. Tony sitting near, steady in the sun.
With a cool swish, the masked nurses slid the last sheet into position, Steve’s world now reduced to a tiny plastic cell. He lay flat, numb, his breathing shaky.
Steve woke under a boiling orange sky riven with seething cracks, Tony calling his name with grief raw in his voice. Gamora sat nearby, watching where the ground outside the pillars of light was also beginning to surge and distort. Thanos had been freed from his bonds and was sitting silently, watching her in turn.
“I’m sure, sweetheart,” Tony said, the endearment falling so easily, so naturally from his lips. “I mean, I’m also freaking out, because living happily ever after isn’t really my area of expertise and emotions are terrifying and I am me so it’s hard to shake the feeling that any relationship I’m involved in is a complete disaster waiting to happen, but… I love you, Steve. So. I’m all yours.”
He nods politely, but as he leaves to return the scepter to the Tower he is smoke and embers, his heart snagged on a new idea, a reckless and thoroughly stupid idea, because even if Steve can’t save
But behind him, Steve had cleared his throat. “Um, hi.” Tony swung around. Steve was gazing at him, somehow smiling despite everything. “I believe the phrase is, I volunteer as tribute,” the other man said softly, then frowned. “Or, is it tribble? I can’t remember.”
Then, with a shrug, he released his grip on the tycoon’s freshly broken arm and stepped aside; Ty fled the room without so much as a glance at Tony. For a long moment, there was nothing but silence, then Steve swung around, uncertainty in his eyes. “I don’t know, do you think he bought it?”
Yet resting brought him no peace. Far beneath his surface thoughts, he could sense the monstrous pain lying in wait; its temporary absence was not a relief so much as a threat, a murmuring reminder that it would soon wake and rise to swallow him whole. As his pulse increased in dread, Steve heard the machines around him speed up in turn, and he grimaced at their betrayal.
“Anything. Everything. Books, movies. Things you’ve seen on vacation, stuff you’re currently working on, whatever.”
And just like that, Steve had bypassed irritation and barrel-rolled into full-blown rage amid a rising flurry of beeps. “No, I was- What the hell, Tony? You think I’m out here
Instead, he felt himself float gently until the ground was under his feet. Tony opened his eyes, confused, saw he was in a large, deep, blackened crater full of debris. Instead of a sky above, there was a dome of familiar-looking energy, colors whirling in queasy turmoil. His suit was intact, but more importantly, Steve lay before him, serene as if sleeping. Tony dismissed his visor and rushed to the super-soldier’s side, noting how Steve wasn’t actually holding the Power Stone like he’d thought; instead it was lodged like a parasite on the super-soldier’s left palm, trails of purple destruction advancing towards Steve’s heart. Tony checked for a pulse with fumbling hands, but Steve opened his eyes at his touch.
The alien smiled wider, which did nothing to improve his looks. “Six years ago, you destroyed my ship.” He tilted his head. “I liked that ship.”
“Followed the yellow brick road,” Steve said, keeping a firm grip of Tony’s left hand with his right, but casually shrugging his other hand free. “Turned out to be the scenic route.”
“Yes,” Tony breathed, when he pulled back, Steve looking at him wide-eyed. “Your question. From before. My answer is yes.” He waited for Steve to recall, his own heart aching at the memory; the soft longings spilled in the night.
There were the sounds of an indignant scuffle before a second voice broke through. “Hi, can anyone hear me? Hi, this is Bruce Banner, uh, I’m actually from Earth, hello.”
At her words, Tony took a long, sobbing breath, crumpling in against Steve’s side. Thinking quickly, Steve swung the smaller man into his arms and returned to the far couches, the others following hesitantly.
“Oh thank god, Steve, she said they’d lost you, that you might never come back, I didn’t know what to do, she said you were just
Spider-Man was visibly shaking, and Steve’s shame threatened to buckle his knees. No kid should see adults fight like that. He would have apologized, but by the time his mouth decided to work, Stark had already taken the kid by the arm and gently pulled him away, murmuring comforting words as they walked.
If ships could limp, this one would be hobbling, Tony thought as the Benatar tilted towards the landing zone. He could see figures spilling out of a nearby building, but he didn’t dare let himself look at their faces. Not yet. Nebula was frowning beside him, her concentration fully locked on fighting the ship into a sensible landing, and without her, he would have died on Titan with everyone else. Tony owed her these last moments of support.
Still afire with that glorious impatience, Steve soon took over fucking his mouth, hands carefully gripping the back of Tony’s head, demanding just the right angle, the right speed. And as ever, inspiring heroics on Tony’s part; years without practice had left him a little rusty but he opened his throat and tried to keep up, taking as much of Steve as he could. The barrage of relentless sensation was overwhelming, exhilarating; Tony was on the ground but he was soaring; it felt like the best parts of flying, of fighting, falling without fear of crashing, and the giddying thought came that he could be happy living the rest of his life in devotion to this, only this; the thought made him hum happily around Steve’s length.
,” Steve told him. Begged. The terror had leaked into his voice. It should have been humiliating, but his heart was pounding too hard for Steve to think. “I- I have to… Tony, I don’t know how to-”
?” he asked, his voice dripping with contempt. “Why the fuck would I ever do that, Rogers? So you can kick me off the team completely?
Once only, Steve attempted to start a conversation. After Tony savagely shut that option down, Steve decided to be patient and follow Tony’s lead. Yet after engaging the autopilot, the other man just settled back in his chair and closed his eyes. Here but gone; both close enough to touch and impossibly far away.
Steve stares back at him, then notices. Tony is wearing an all-black suit. Tony hates all-black suits, says they’re boring, says they’re only good for-
Six weeks of Steve persuading people to hope, to hold on, to try just a little longer, even as he knew he was asking the impossible.
Steve’s chest clenched tighter, a stabbing echo of his childhood asthma attacks, shame and fear the worst torment even as the air itself became his enemy. People often called Steve Rogers brave, always called him honest, but under the weight of Tony’s raw gaze, his resolve stumbled, and something weaker than the truth fell off his tongue.
“Eh, paperwork. So boring,” Tony said breezily, slouching in his chair. “Don’t pout, Cap. I’m fine.” He was almost convincing, even to Steve.
Steve could feel the Captain’s patience eroding, his urgency almost enough to overwrite Steve again, and cut to the chase. “You know what Thanos did?”
Steve opened his mouth to quarrel but a loud rumble overhead cut him off. He shaded his hand over his eyes to see Rhodey had returned and was escorting the
Tony’s stomach lurched. So many changes to explain. “Tell Thor to park on the lawn,” he said. “Might as well, since he ruined it last time.”
In fact, part of Steve was screaming to press even closer, but an instant surge of panic obliterated the very idea.
Yet Steve was too drained to pretend. “Nah, I’m just early. Ignore me.” There was a couch that doubled as a nap station lying vacant nearby, and Steve sat down with every intention of letting Tony work another hour or so before calling it a night.
“Hurry,” she said then, and nodded to the increasing destruction visible outside the pillars’ glowing circle of protection. “Until you counter it, Thanos’ last command still stands, and this place cannot hold it back much longer.” She hesitated. “I must warn you, I don’t know what is about to happen. This may yet claim your lives, but please trust that I will do everything in my power to bring you through this safely.”
A huff escapes Tony, and he flops down onto his chair, heart still thudding in his chest. He glances at the bottle of whiskey on his desk, sorely tempted, but he can still feel Steve’s gaze burning into him, and something prevents him from reaching for it.
“It’s not perfect,” Steve admits, with a small, self-deprecating smile. “Couldn’t get it quite right without you in the suit. You give it life.”
“Right.” Tony swallows hard, wrapping his arms around himself self-consciously. He already misses the warmth of Steve’s hands on his skin. “Duty calls, and… everything. See ya, Cap.”
Steve draws all of his teammates pretty regularly—the curve of Natasha’s smile when she laughs, the drape of Thor’s unbound hair tumbling over his shoulders, Bruce squinting through his glasses, Clint’s head and shoulders poking out of a vent—but lately, Tony has insinuated himself into Steve’s artwork more and more often, finding a starring role there. He fills several pages with disjointed sketches of Tony, of his hands manipulating light in the workshop, of the angle of his jaw and the well-groomed lines of his goatee, of the messy shock of his hair right after he runs his hands through it. Sometimes, when he wants to stop thinking and just puts pencil to paper, when he lets the lines of graphite create and bring form to anything and everything in the recesses of his mind—sometimes he draws Tony in a way that feels a little more personal.
A horrible blush spreads across Steve’s face, his cheeks blazing with warmth. He sputters a little, but there’s no point in denying it—she clearly already knows—so he just huffs and disconnects to the sound of her soft laughter.
A grunt of acknowledgement is the only response Tony gets, but Cap’s currently holding his own against three of the overgrown wasps below him, so Tony won’t hold it against him. In fact—
“You think I don’t blame myself, too?” Steve says. Tony looks up at him, brow furrowing, but when he opens his mouth, Steve silences him with a gentle squeeze to his arm. “Every time one of my teammates gets hurt, I feel responsible. I’m the captain—Christ, I’m
The chain holding the bag in place on the ceiling snaps, and a last sharp blow sends it flying across the room and slamming into the wall. Sand sprays from a tear in the bag, and Tony stops short, eyes widening.
Steve touches their foreheads together and cradles Tony’s face in his hands, thumbs sweeping over his cheekbones, rubbing the delicate skin under his eyes. “Do you know how long I’ve wanted to do that?” he murmurs, awed.
uses the title, Steve can at least pretend it doesn’t make him feel the way it does—hot and prickly, almost, skin feeling stretched taut over his bones, uncomfortable and ill-fitting. (He wonders if he should feel so trapped by his alter ego, as he sometimes does; there are days when the shield is unbearably heavy, as though he is unworthy to bear its weight, and that tight feeling of wrongness gives the impression that the identity of Captain America is too big to fit inside Steve Rogers.) At least nobody knows how much he genuinely dislikes it at times.
by his stupid crush. He scowls and tugs the wrapping around his torso a little tighter than he needs to.
—that had managed to sneak up on him. It falls with a shriek, and Tony mimes wiping sweat from his brow. “Target eliminated, obliterated, et cetera. Thanks, Cap.”
Tony is glad, suddenly, for the full-coverage faceplate of his suit, because it means Steve can’t see the way Tony’s face has gone hot-rod red at both the question and the nickname.
“I’m not mad at you, and trust me, I want to kiss you too,” Steve says, grinning, before he sobers a bit. “But first I want you to tell me what fried your suit, and if it’s fixable.”
Humming softly, Steve relaxes, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. “You make a compelling argument, Tony,” he says, tipping his chin up to smile at Tony.
A large hand closes around his bicep, and Tony goes very still. “Stark,” Steve says quietly. “Look at me.”
“Copy that.” Steve ducks to dodge a hit from a Doombot, taking it down with a swift kick, and makes his way as quickly as possible to where Tony went down. His heart is pounding, fear gripping his chest, constricting his lungs.
Steve doesn’t. His hand is warm on Tony’s bare arm, thumb sweeping along the curve of his shoulder. The lab isn’t cold, but Tony shivers anyway, feeling far too exposed in his worn tank top and jeans, especially compared to Steve, who’s still in uniform sans the gloves and cowl. The super-soldier has that infuriating look on his face, studying Tony intently, like he can see right through him.
