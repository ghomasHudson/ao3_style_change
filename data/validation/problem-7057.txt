how moved and overwhelmed and impressed Steve was. He felt it. Steve had never looked more beautiful than he did in that moment.
around. Just…. being able to exist without panicking. Not having to expend endless mental effort on analysing everything and staying alert and imagining every worst-case scenario… Being able to relax his shoulders.
Steve was immediately drawn into it, suddenly daydreaming about a world in which he could drop by Tony’s house any time, or call him with questions, or work with him on any number of plans…
to ignore the little flicker of defensiveness. He tried to talk himself out of being hurt, like an aunt trying to contain an argument at a family wedding,
As everything came back into focus, the first thing Steve was aware of was the soft press of Tony’s lips against his neck…
Tony’s stomach twisted, his mouth watering and his muscles tensing towards Steve. For a moment, he was forced to hold himself completely still – having to gather his senses, and come back into himself, before he could trust his body to do anything at all-
” Pepper forcibly pulled him out of his head, sounding anxious now. “Okay, Tony, please, you’re going to have to tell me what’s going on with you.”
thinking that Tony would choose that exact moment to step out of the office, and that Steve - head lowered - would therefore walk right into him.
Involuntarily, Tony looked back at the waiter, following him as he stepped down from the stage and made his way through the dining room… Past women in gauze cocktail dresses and men in lace bodysuits and the many people who had chosen to pair their tailored dinner jackets with booty shorts….
bug my apartment, once… I came home one day, and he was just sitting in my living room, covered in blood. And then he tells me that my apartment is bugged. And I didn’t really have time to think about it then, because Nick Fury was covered in blood. And telling me that SHIELD was compromised. And then a few minutes later the room exploded in bullets, and the neighbour I actually thought I was friends with burst in to call for backup…” he trailed off into a bitter laugh.
“But we can’t do it like this,” Steve answered softly - gazing longingly at Tony’s throat, even as he said it, “I’d have to be sure I knew what I was doing… I can’t hurt you. I’d never hurt you. And we have to talk about that first… I have to
In that instant, Steve understood what was really happening here. Something so terrible that it pushed everything else out of his head –
Steve set his glass down to the side of him carelessly, paying no attention to whether it toppled over – while Tony just let his fall to the ground, quite possibly cracking it. There was a sudden rush of excited pride, as Steve recognised how worked up Tony was getting. Even after all these months he was still overwhelmed by the discovery that Tony loved him, that he
“I love it here,” Steve sighed, happily. A swell of pure affection rose up in him, seeing the pride in Tony’s little smile.
“Okay buddy, you think you can stand?” Tony turned his attention back to Wesley - who was still locked in a terrified, wide-eyed stare with Steve.
that must be really weird and uncomfortable and I don’t even know why I’m doing it… I just keep getting this feeling that it would...
had all the available information to help him make sense of it... to reassure himself that he wanted
He had far more important things to focus on, better uses of every second of his time – quite enough to be upset and worried about at the moment, without getting distracted by this silly little keepsake.
But he was backing away from this apology for all the same reasons. He was still telling Tony he could expect more from him than he expected from Tony. He was

Steve was suddenly so keenly aware that Tony never smiled at him anymore… that he probably never would again. That he missed Tony so very much. He missed seeing Tony the way those two women saw him now, he missed watching him laugh and listening to him speak and feeling comfortable in his company. And Steve knew it was all his fault, and he knew he had no right to sulk about it… but it still

He was Ross, calling him arrogant and reckless and irresponsible as he locked the worlds defenders away on a raft, without trial.
just lie with you like this, and not have to hope anyone get’s distracted…” And as he was saying it, he was thinking about the reality of that, the fact that this wasn’t a wonderful one-off event or an amazing experience he had to make the most of… this was just his life now… And he felt Tony wriggle happily, with that same excited joy that was making his own toes curl-
An apology for his behaviour in the bunker – made in the most awkward, indirect possible terms… but still.
Put simply, Steve didn’t want a younger version of himself around, and a younger version of himself wouldn’t want to be here. Steve was doing what he knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that this Steve would do for himself - and he was doing it in the kindest, least risky, least disruptive way he could think of. And he’d really thought about it.
breaking down, just once. He could admit to himself that he was scared and confused and not sure he liked himself very much. He could admit to Tony that he was sorry, he could just tell Tony that he still didn’t support the Accords and he still didn’t blame Bucky – but that he loved Tony anyway, with every inch of his being. What would happen if he did all that? Would the world really end?
to apologise. I hadn’t realised that… I do that for me, as much as for the other person, every time I do it. Because that’s how you draw a line under something. That’s how you work out if you can make it better, and how to do it. That’s how you move on from mistakes you’ve made and grow and keep building… and I just thought… How…
“It says that her area of interest is this drug here, C2H5OH, do you know anything about it?” He asked – just to make sure he was right.
“Well, if I have this wrong, and we can’t get Franciszek out of here once we’ve questioned him, I don’t suppose we’ll be able to come and find you for help
And, just like that, he was moving – somehow, he’d even managed to think to look for power cables, knowing that they’d be more likely to lead down a corridor that was useful to him.
gesture of kindness. More real, more personal, than Tony’s professional offer to help in the first place.
was certainly eager to get out of the conversation - more so than he’d been at the beginning of the meeting. Which was saying something.
, a little voice piped up, meekly, like it knew the rest of the brain was going to be hella mad at it for interrupting. But it had a point – Tony had at least
“Okay, good,” Tony added quietly, not really talking to Steve anymore. Already turning to walk over to Bucky, desperately thinking of how to push past this awful event…
It seemed strange to question any of it now, when this was just how he lived his life, and nothing about it ever seemed wrong…
…And really, who cared what bullshit Ross came out with, or how long it took politicians to get to the point?
drunk, and technically we’re still on a mission.” Tony explained, slipping into the same careful, appeasing tone Jarvis used on him when he was a teenager.
He knew that he had to invest as much into any friendship as he was prepared to accept from it  - that he’d always owed Natasha as much loyalty as he’d taken from her.
“Yes, thank you JARVIS, I’m reminded,” Tony snapped, a hot terror coiling tighter in his chest with every ring…
moments of enlightenment weren’t enough to completely erase these irrational fears. That he could be a completely different person to the man he just sent back into the past, and still carry the burdens of that very moment…
Even though he couldn’t possibly have heard Tony yet, even though he couldn’t see him, Steve immediately recognised that Tony was
those people got exactly what they deserved. He was glad that he didn’t have to spend the rest of his life wishing that revenge upon them, that he could comfort himself with the thought that they’d suffered-
“…No, actually,” he remembered out loud. “No, last time it just froze, mid action – but it wasn’t heavy, the same way…”
… But, in a way, thinking back to it felt like remembering a particularly vivid dream. There was still that slight distance, the disconnect between the way Tony’s brain had worked that night and the way it worked when he looked back on it… There was still that wordless feeling that it had happened in a different world, that it had happened
With that, Tony’s chest clenched tight, and a hot tearfulness flushed his face. A muddled collection of memories flashed up, over a soundtrack of questions and realisations - all moving too fast to mean anything. Still, he could feel the picture forming behind it, the overwhelming fear that everything was feeding into…
breathe, obviously, and my heart does beat… it’s just that it doesn’t have to, very often. It’s just that my organs work more efficiently, really. That’s why people used to think that vampires were literally dead, I think… I don’t really know… But really, it’s just that I can be unconscious for a long time without dying. And I can hold my breath for a
read. Recognising that he’d accepted clunky, contradictory phrases as the right translation, that he’d strained his original idea to make it fit…
And, God knows where the next point even came from. Steve had always been so quick to hate himself for thinking self-indulgent thoughts, so keen to bury them, that he had never been sure
“They’re pretty corny, and no one goes after they’ve been here, like, a week” The girlfriend sighed, not unkindly.

the problem is. And I don’t think it’s anywhere near where anyone else has been looking…” he spoke to somewhere in Steve’s general vicinity.
If he’d learned one thing from this whole debacle, it was that they both sucked at guessing what the other was thinking. That, whatever else happened, just saying it out loud was always a better answer.
Steve Rogers apparently thought Tony was worth having around, flaws and all, because he believed Tony could do impossible things…
“Well… like you say, they did, actually. They said a lot, and it’s not like any of it isn’t true” Tony rearranged what he’d just heard, hoping it would work as a bluff. “But I guess you could say I was expecting something different.”
There was a very basic, instinctive part of Tony that recoiled from the idea of Steve ever watching him drink – that could barely comprehend the additional horror of it actually being
Steve braced his hands against the inside of Tony’s thighs, deliberately digging his thumbs into the crease of Tony’s groin as he pulled his earlobe between his teeth-
“Er, well, we haven’t talked about it, or anything” Tony answered Janine, his eyes still fixed on Steve.
“Or die of thirst,” Sam added, gesturing at Steve’s untouched glass, “you’re seriously not going to drink anything for four days?”
sorry for the things I did. I am sorry that I was so unhelpful when we were discussing the Sokovia Accords, and I am sorry for the ridiculous, reckless way that I helped Bucky, and I am sorry I fell into a trap, as it turns out… But I can’t say I’m sorry I didn’t sign the Accords and I can’t say I’m sorry I helped Bucky and I can’t say I wouldn’t try to stop a threat like that. And…Maybe that’s another reason the letter was so bad… And, I don’t know, maybe all of that means we can’t get past this and you can’t forgive me, but-”
“Whatever is going on, the staff are evacuating,” Steve added, cautiously. “And it looks like they’re all running for the main entrance.”

carefully to stay within this new grey area he’d created for himself - but at least there was that distinction now.
He’d started the same way Steve had; by coming up with as many embarrassing, creepy things he would not want to say in front of Steve as possible. That had lasted a fair few hours.
he wanted this to work. He hadn’t thought it was possible to want to be with Steve more than he had for the last seven years… and now it was like he’d stepped up into another league entirely. It was so much better… or worse, he could tell… but it was so much more when he really thought there might be a chance…
And then Tony curled his hand around Steve’s cock, gasping quietly as he realised the weight of it against his palm-
And Steve even went back to those awful, endless moments when he thought that Tony was dying. He remembered every fear and plea and promise that went through his mind, he let himself recall  the injustice and the pain and the grief…
“It’s okay, it’s going to be okay…” Tony assured, taking a confident step forward, screwdriver already in hand. He popped another panel free, and dropped his head to look at it. The examination table shook as Bucky’s metal arm crashed into the side of it, flailing against Steve’s restraint. “It’s alright, two seconds, we got this…” Tony murmured, his eyes sharply determined as he twisted the screwdriver
Even if it were true that Steve was special and wonderful and the reason Tony smiled these days… that didn’t mean Tony could keep him. It didn’t provide any way for this to work, it didn’t magically make any of the risks disappear.
Actually, it had been just over twenty four hours since he got back from Germany - and he’d spent most of it pacing in little circles in his room. Even his supernatural endurance was beginning to flag, adding an aching back and shaky legs to the list of things he was trying to ignore-
“And, I, just… really, really wish I’d said some of this earlier” Tony sighed, giving his head a little shake at his own silliness – still smiling.
And Tony knew that he shouldn’t think that way. That he’d had spent three whole days working out why he couldn’t think that way… But as soon as he saw Steve, all that carefully constructed context just fell apart. It was like waking up in the middle of a dream, unable to remember the logic of it.
what makes me wonder about using it as a ‘Hydra Base’,” Tony explained. “I mean, on the one hand, I can’t think of a good reason why this base wouldn’t be hooked up to that system… unless it’s something to do with how a
time, Steve had to return the mind stone after another version of himself had stolen it from a different version of himself, in a building that was crawling with Avengers, and at the cross-roads of several global-level events-
“The exact opposite of busy,” Steve raced to assure him. “Bucky and Sam are off on some retrieval mission, and Nat is training with the Maximoffs all week – I’m actually standing here wondering what the hell to do with my day.”
The way he refused to choose which thing to be confused by, or interested in - the way he never demanded Steve make the story smaller, and instead just challenged the next part of it.
If he was struggling to function over the desperate urge to go to Steve and… bundle him in blankets, or something...
“Yeah,” Tony breathed bitterly, like he was talking to himself - before shooting Steve an expectant glare,
office was. He’d looked it up once, on one of the many nights he’d been too consumed by thoughts of Steve to sleep. One of the many nights he’d spent googling everything and anything Steve had ever mentioned, just because it was a way to feel close to him…
He cast a disinterested glance towards the left of the room, knowing that there was a laptop over there somewhere, tidied away so that it wouldn’t jar with the aesthetic.
to do. He’d found himself talking to Tony about politics, and his childhood, and his pet hates – all things that were too personal and too controversial to be comfortable, usually. Topics that Steve would instinctively shy away from were suddenly just… things that came to mind.
All the things Tony might’ve been able to do, to find Bucky or help Bucky or whatever it took to protect everything he’d ever built – if Steve had ever given him the chance. If Steve hadn’t decided that Tony would just have to accept the best that other people could do. That, on balance, it was better to risk Tony’s entire world than risk telling him the truth.
Initially, Steve was just confused by it. He couldn’t imagine Tony being moved by a compliment from him when they were friends, much less when Steve was a stranger to him…
Steve pulled harder at Tony’s hair, forcing his head back, sucking those deep, greedy kisses over his jaw and throat. Tony clung to him, helplessly writhing against Steve’s body, responding directly to that primal need for more. Steve’s hands found their way under Tony’s robe, stroking possessively over his back before he grabbed him by the hips, grinding into him. And then Steve moaned against his throat, a mournful, pleading sound that shot right to Tony’s groin.
Jesus fuck, he had no idea what his body was doing, what his brain was doing, where any of these reactions were coming from or what the fuck to do with them...
“Oh, yeah, earlier, when we were in one of the bars, I saw a woman I think works here, and I’m pretty sure she isn’t human” Steve reported back, talking too fast. “And, I saw her again in the hallway, and I thought I’d try to ask her who she was – I don’t know why really, I just… ‘cos she’s the only non-human I’ve seen, and I couldn’t figure out what her job was, or… I don’t know, I guess I was going to ask her… she wasn’t there when I got out there, anyway.”
“Yeah, we’re good,” Steve grinned, glancing over Sam’s head to shoot Bucky a look that only they would understand. Sam didn’t see it – he was too busy noticing the pool of blood that Tony was lying in.
It was probably just a sign of how isolated and lonely he still was, all these months after coming out of the ice. Steve could only assume that he wouldn’t be fixating on meaningless interactions with co-workers, if there had been anything meaningful in his life at all. But as it was, he didn’t have any real relationships. He didn’t have any affinities or loyalties of his own, no personal investment in this new world. Nothing harmless or human to think about, when he was done with his responsibilities and trauma for the day… Except for his petty arguments with Tony.

I hate things that run away from me, things I can’t plan… But it didn’t start out quite as… Coherent, as it is now. When I came here, I really
A little voice whispered in Steve’s head, softer and kinder than his internal monologue had ever been,
Like what the fuck he was going to say to Pepper, who had left him four voicemails already that afternoon, and was now waiting for him on the other side of this very door.
Either way, it felt like a significant observation. A wider recognition that the past wasn’t the same as his memories of it - further proof that he could never go back in time, even if he returned to the same place in time…
He could still feel the aftershocks of that climax shuddering though him, his whole body limp and loose and surrendered to it
just seemed petulant. Instead, he let his head loll back into the couch cushions, his glass resting carelessly on his knee…
fit perfectly in the world, and wanted all the ‘normal’ things from it and… all that…. Then I’d just be a burden on them. Then the only issues would be my issues, and our relationship would be about
At least once, it occurred to him that daydreaming about Steve sucking his cock was probably an inappropriate response. That he should probably be more anxious about those memories, that there should be other things that he was thinking about instead…
involved in Hydra would need access to this system. They couldn’t receive orders or maintain their cover without it. Any projects that they didn’t want the rest of SHIELD to know about - and any communications about it, or any auxiliary details - it would all
A completely different sort of excitement began to expand in Tony’s chest, distinct from the primal urgency of before. This was a light, giddy feeling, an elated sense of freedom and a pure abundance of joy.
But Steve would have liked the chance to do so many things that even time travel couldn’t make possible - and he was finally starting to make his peace with that.
He took just enough time to appreciate the little details as he wandered comfortably to his ultimate destination. He allowed himself a few moments to indulge in bittersweet daydreams of what might have been. He walked past Peggy’s office again, and even took a detour so that he could pass by Howard - although he didn’t stop to talk to either of them. Steve didn’t trouble himself with deeper questions of how he felt about them, or what he would have liked to say to them, or what he thought might happen if he did. He simply acknowledged a basic curiosity to look at both of them again, and a resistance to attempting anything more complicated than that - and went with it.
it would become clear that Steve hadn’t thought it all the way through… although, to be honest, Tony had never banked on that. He was expecting Steve to have run through a checklist; he was even prepared for the swell of affection that rose up in him when Steve said it.
Because he loved Steve. That night Tony loved Steve with all the pain and passion of a first crush. He loved his smile, and his sweetness, and his endless, puppy-like determination. He loved entirely arbitrary things about him, the way he pinched his lips when he was reading and the fact that he put the milk in before the coffee and the hint of a Brooklyn accent that still edged some of his words – for no reason other than they were
And he felt the sharp jolt of Tony’s fingers digging into his shoulder, as he frantically grabbed for anything to hold onto-
, as though they rebuilt this entire place every day, from only the most exquisite materials and using only the finest craftsmen. The marble counter-top of the reception desk shone so flawlessly, it made Tony’s fingers itch to mark it, the way he always wanted to jump into untouched snow.
Just that one word, like an alarm in his head – Tony didn’t have time to remember what it meant. He couldn’t think of how to warn him,
, I’d like to be able to tell you anyway, just because I’m angry and I’m hurt. Just once, I’m going to tell you what I thought of all of that, and I’m going to pretend like that matters to anyone, in and of itself. I’m going to pretend I’m expecting you to meet me halfway. And then, after that, we can just go home, and I’m going to step the fuck out of this. And we’ll go back to the world where whatever
It couldn’t last, of course - they had important work to do. Work that Tony wanted to do, towards aims that he knew mattered… Or, that would matter, later.
That pleasure just crashed through him like a wave, surging up along his back all the way to his shoulders. His cock burned now, leaking steadily against his skin. And just as his head stopped spinning, Steve thrust into him again, sharper and shallower and harder, and again, sending one wave of sensation crashing straight into another. And then Steve slid one hand over the curve of Tony’s hips, over his thighs, and then tugging at his balls – sending a sudden spark of pleasure deep inside him-
That was way more than unfortunate. This whole thing already felt like a test of his personal limits –adding a fake relationship with Steve just seemed unnecessarily spiteful. The sort of thing a supervillain would have thrown in, because of a personal grudge against Tony.
And he felt Steve’s rhythm stutter just slightly – his fingers still working Tony open as his other hand pulled his cock free of his jeans-
mean anyone here was a member of that organisation, or supports their values, or that anyone had anything to do with what happened to you-”
a bit like that” Possibly Trish carried on, defiantly “It’s like… a little, open meeting, and one of the staff goes through any announcements and a little run down of what’s going on that week – and they have other staff there, with, like, leaflets on stuff, and they answer questions-”
that came to mind, all the hopes and fears and bashful excitement… As though he was still some scrawny kid in Brooklyn, waking up next to his crush.
They all started pouring into his head, one after the other, in no particular pattern - and with no attempt to answer any of them.
Frantically, he tried to at least gather them all into groups, to work out exactly how many conflicting priorities were battling for attention-
nightmares, about portals and space and Chitauri warships, now intermixed with the dark visions Wanda had put into his head.
Tony paused for a moment so that he could get his bearings. He ran his eyes over the alien landscape without any real care, oblivious to how strange he’d found it a few days earlier, until eventually he caught sight of the bar again. It was nearer than he’d expected it to be, but still mostly obscured from view by the crowd - he still couldn’t make out many of the details. From here, he could only say that it looked like the pop-up bars you see along promenades in tourist season. Tony could see the denser crowd packed tight around the edge of it as people bustled for service, and then the more casual people who hovered at the side-lines, taking a moment out of the festival to enjoy their drinks. He couldn’t see Steve... but then, he wouldn’t expect to. From this distance, he couldn’t make out much of anything. So, calmly, Tony fixed his gaze on his destination and started walking towards it.
“No,” Pepper answered bluntly – and Tony laughed. And then, before he could attempt to push them away from the subject, she commented, “in fact, the last time I saw you, you were borderline catatonic.”
“Nothing. Doesn’t matter,” Tony mumbled in response. He could feel the blush scalding up his neck, burning the tips of his ears - if Steve happened to look back now, he was sure to see Tony glowing. People back at the hotel could probably see him-
an honour to meet you,” one of the Rousseau’s beamed, as the two of them leapt up off of the couch in perfect union.
how Steve was feeling – and he almost wished he didn’t. It was stupid… but he kind of wished he didn’t already know how little he could do to help, right now.
A little smile tugged at his lips as he thought back to that purely functional final stop on his time-trip, and the Steve that he’d quietly watched unthaw. Of all the Steves that he had crossed paths with, he had a certain connection to that one, having spent so long clinically observing his awakening like that…
“Do you prefer to be put out? Or do you prefer to be awake for treatment, if you can?” Tony pressed on.
Then the sky outside flashed brilliant white, so bright that even Captain America jumped. And then another crash of thunder, even louder, and a theatrical howl of wind.
The Nat he was actually going to meet was far closer to the person who had betrayed Tony than the person who had taken on the challenge of global security after the snap...
“But you think maybe you can do to Zan what Scott did to Sonny?” Steve brought his focus back to the issue. And Tony looked back at his screen.
to compete with those plans,” he replied, amiably. “In which case, if I don’t see you again, it’s been a pleasure to work with you Steve,” and he extended a hand. Steve took it, warmly.
This wasn’t a sensation that flooded through him, this wasn’t a feeling that he could’ve sunk into, like before.
“Well, maybe we could go and explain to them that they’re hurting people, and they will immediately understand our argument and feel terrible for what they’ve done, and close up shop, and offer whatever help that can to make it right.” He suggested, wryly. And even then, it took a second for Tony to register what Steve was getting at. He’d already moved onto the next filler sentence,
He was momentarily so overcome with hurt that Tony would think that way, and guilt that he’d ever played into it, and a pained desperation to make it right, that he forgot all the reassurances he was trying to make.
of new ideas in Steve’s head, all of a sudden, things he didn’t have time to think in words or directly look at, but still… he
“Well, nothing else has changed.” She answered curtly, still looking at whatever she was washing/chopping/peeling.
He heard Steve let go of a little gasp, as he recognised how strong Tony’s grip was, how confidently he was moving now…
“...Well, I think it’s more about me just… getting over it,” Tony realised as he spoke - pausing when Rhodey let go of a frustrated groan.
. You outrank Nick Fury, and no one ever talks about that - but… Nick Fury is supposed to salute you. And you were the liaison between Stark Industries and the military, at the upper levels of both, like the
Steve knew a version of these people once - but they’d all moved out of his life and gone their separate ways, and crossed paths with him again years later… as different people. Parallel versions of themselves.
And, God, he really had never put himself in Steve’s shoes before, had he? Or, wait – he’d never put Steve in his. He’d never considered that Steve would think the way he did, do things for the same irrational, unhealthy reasons he did, sometimes…
within arms reach of the couch – knowing exactly what he was looking for. Exactly where he’d find it.
about what he was saying, rationalise his emotional responses – accept that he was being ridiculous, probably.
Which somehow made the fear and confusion all the more crushing. Like they were more horrible for just how much they could ruin for him-
like Tony Stark – he’d called himself childish, and reactionary, and defensive. Steve had reminded himself that, if Stark
For all his three-day work marathons and week-long benders, Tony still felt a pang of shame at this point in the morning. A wordless feeling that he
“Come here,” Tony whispered softly, guiding Steve to climb with him onto the bed. And Steve just followed him, like his limbs were responding to Tony’s thoughts rather than his own. And then Tony put a hand to Steve’s shoulder, and pushed him to lie flat on his back, climbing on top of him and straddling his hips. Steve whimpered at the sudden friction and bucked up against him, his hands grabbing at Tony’s waist. Tony grinned indulgently and ground against him slowly, sending a hot wave of pleasure rolling up Steve’s spine. Steve groaned, and tried to rock up into it – but found he was pinned so much more firmly than he expected to be. Like Tony was able to push down against him with more weight than he carried, able to hold Steve still without even moving.
Obviously, he never would have taken advantage of Tony’s inhibition if he hadn’t been on drugs himself. But… He
Steve swallowed the stomach acid that was pooling under his tongue, and gave a perfunctory little nod. He would have dearly loved to be comforted by the gentle way that Tony was talking to him, but Steve could barely hear him over the imagined sounds of Bucky screaming-
speaking… Stark hadn’t bothered with any of the thousands of people who’d begged for his help in the last twenty years… And Steve wasn’t judging that. He wasn’t. He just had to keep in mind that Stark hadn’t done anything to justify this level of obsession. That, as important and generous as Stark’s help was, it didn’t make him any better than a lot of people Steve knew. That there was no reason to think they’d get on, if they did spend time together…
“Always happy to stab someone in the spine,” Tony joked – and Steve actually laughed. A warm, musical sound that Tony liked very much… That he was glad he got to hear, just once.
Back then, he was still packaging up all of his trauma and trying to maintain his rigid ideology and ignoring a lot of what he really felt.
laughed. Tony saw it, just a flicker of a smile before he bit his lips together – like he knew he wasn’t allowed to.
Tony indulged in it for a moment, kissing Steve slowly, caressing his hands firmly over Steve’s back. He felt Steve soften into him, opening himself up to this. Tony could hear and feel and
to be devoured, offering himself up as enthusiastically as he knew how. Neither of them so much as paused as Steve carried Tony over to the bed, his hands grasping desperately at Tony’s clothes the whole time.
“Yeah, okay, I’ll see you then,” he agreed, holding his phone to his ear until he heard Steve hang up.
When he looked up, the assistant was still looking at him expectantly, subtly nodding towards the outfit in a silent encouragement to put it on. Tony sighed, and went to pull the robes over his head-
beholden to national interests or working according to national authority… but not separate to them either. An independent group with its own internal regulations and its own autonomy - that could still work within existing international laws, and partner with all other interested parties…”
A heaviness that he felt strangely distant to – like he could feel it happening to someone else, miles below him.
“...Hang on, let me check that upgrade is actually running, and then we’ll go,” Tony murmured, smiling as he stepped away from Steve. And then he skipped his way back over to the side of the room, still full of that same exhilarated energy…
have just walked into my life at any time in the last twenty years, and this all happened. And, I mean, it wasn’t like Steve could have walked into my life at all, if Pepper hadn’t fought so hard for it,” Tony remembered with a self-depreciating laugh. “And I never would have invited him back if it weren’t for you oh-so-carefully pushing me into it… But it’s more than that. I don’t know if I would even have been in the right place to feel this for him – or how he could possibly have liked me, if I was still like I was at 21… Or even if this feeling would have been enough, if it wasn’t for all the other stuff I had to fall back on…” Tony swallowed hard, surprised by how
A scalding heat ran up Steve’s back as he was hit by the sheer embarrassment of what he’d just done.
Was this one of those things he’d always been afraid of - one of those things that he might actually like? After all these years of fighting so hard against it, could it really be that Tony
Steve glanced up, his eyes still soft and unfocused, his brow slightly creased by the sheer effort of lifting his head. Tony’s giggle settled into a warm smile.
mess that I got myself into, and then dug myself further into just trying to get out of it, just trying to stop everything falling into it, and I just…”
He’d have to file that away for consideration later, though. Right now he had to focus on Tony, and what had happened – that was the bit he’d wish he’d thought about, once Tony woke up…
, obviously, we can’t just go up there and blow the whole operation up right now” Tony raced to clarify “Because we don’t even know if that
“I don’t - I’m - I didn’t-” he stammered, fighting so many conflicting thoughts when all he wanted was to give in to that one unmistakable feeling.
And Tony moaned along with him as he swallowed desperately, his mind swimming with pleasure as the taste of it overwhelmed him. By the time Steve fell away, Tony’s body was throbbing with a primal sort of satisfaction, an intoxicated dizziness buzzing in his head.
The warm, indulgent feeling of not having to be anywhere else - of knowing there was nothing more important than what was wrapped up in his arms…
And Tony vaguely remembered that this was where he’d intended to begin. He was supposed to think about this part… whether they were ever going to see each other again, and
about all this… and… I don’t know if you’re thinking that I listened to all this from Steve, and not you, or if you’re wondering why I’m prepared to go outside for a guy I just met, and not you…”
long before I started, I don’t think… And Adam changed it, to make it a human resort, sure, but it’s still
But again, Tony didn’t drink. He pulled his teeth free and simply let the blood run freely over Steve’s legs, his fingers still twisting inside him. The pleasure of it rushed up against his limits, forced up hard against them – and fell away.
“But, please don’t be alarmed.” Dev soothed – because Tony had gone as white as a sheet, he could feel he had. “I know, it’s not exactly a comforting thought,
“Yeah,” he grinned. “And I promise to do my best to explain how the hell you did it, and I’m guessing you’ll be able to work it out from there - you did the first time… But the point is that I already know you. I met you nearly fifteen years ago, I worked with you, we went through… so much. And the reason I’m here, is because I want to see
?” Rhodey enquired, narrowing his eyes. Steve didn’t pause to analyse that either. He just answered the question.
Tony also makes that clear to Steve at the start, so there is no implied sexual violence or power play, and Tony does give Steve one yes/no chance to continue or get out of this - although, as its a non sexual situation, he hasn't bothered with prior discussion or a safe word or anything, and he continues to tell at Steve even when he looks visibly upset.
Vaguely, Steve considered pointing out that Natasha had kept plenty of secrets just because someone said she had to - a potential treatment for the symptoms of palladium poisoning, for one.
Steve felt self-conscious now that he knew Tony had seen it, remembering the embarrassment he’d associated with it earlier.
Steve had no idea what cover story Nick had given his superiors - whether they knew who he really was, or what they thought otherwise. In any case, it wouldn’t be long before they found out. Unlike the friendly thirty something lab technicians,
dressed again. Tony’s shirt was only half buttoned, and Steve had no idea where his shoes were… but close enough.
And there was a sudden, searing pain in Steve’s palm, and a hot burst of blood, as Adam grabbed his hand and smashed the little bottle of intimidate spray into it.
“So, I dunno… maybe what I’m about to say won’t mean anything to you,” Bucky shrugged – somehow not coming over quite as casual as he should be… “Maybe it doesn’t
were the things that worried him… All because he didn’t want to think about what had actually given him indigestion all week.
He knew that Tony meant it when he promised to help, and, obviously, he knew how brilliant and resourceful Tony was… But Steve hadn’t had much time to picture what that would really mean. Actually
Tony felt a nauseous conflict drag through his gut. He didn’t know how to reconcile this wave of affection with this surge of irritation. How to explain this resistance to saying all the things he’d been yelling in his head for a year.
But Steve had resisted the temptation to speak to him - even though it had been almost unbearable at times. As much as Steve longed to just be in his company again, as hard as it was to know that Tony was real and alive and once again part of the same world as him… The plan was too important.
the idea that he could be good for Steve. That he could provide something to this relationship, that he could somehow balance this overwhelming dept he felt to Steve right now.
Steve’s cringe flickered deeper, his whole body clenching inwards with the anxiety of what he’d just said out loud.
Suddenly, Steve wasn’t sure how much of this arrangement was a secret. Whether Tony would expect him to conceal even the fact that they’d met-
knows, it was just one mistake, and… And it’s not that I wouldn’t tell you I think this. It’s not that I’m scared of showing it, not anymore. It’s just – that isn’t the rant that comes into my head, when I look at you. It was never
, low in his groin. Not just the deep, throbbing ache of Tony grinding against him or the growing desire for more of him - although, there
And the giddy woosh of his centre of gravity being pulled up through his body, pulling the world with it-
“But will you remember this the next time I have to argue with you?” Pepper breezed, and Tony laughed again.
“…Why?” Steve prompted him. He wasn’t sure it was the right question – but he really wanted to know the answer.
say. Tony fixed him with a level stare for a second or two, and then relaxed his shoulders in a deliberate way.
Steve kicked himself for that, as they finally got out of the car. He reminded himself that he didn’t
“So, wait a minute, let me get this straight,” Tony demanded in a serious tone of voice, one hand held aloft to demonstrate that he had the floor. “You’re telling me that Steve basically fell into the store, whilst being beaten up by three people, and
But Tony just smiled, kind and understanding and patient. And then he shifted his weight so that he could lie on the bed right next to Steve, and gently roll him so that he was lying against Tony’s chest – another sob breaking out of him as he buried his head into Tony’ neck.
. “And, anyway, I’d tell you flat out if I thought you were being an ass, and I’d tell you straight away.”
“Well, I have to admit, it doesn’t sound that dumb so far,” Rhodey conceded, his features still scrunched up in exaggerated scepticism…Tony smiled at him, but it still felt bittersweet.

mention it – with your team of super friends rolling their eyes behind you and asking when I’m going to get over it – with you, staring at the floor and telling me to
He let his eyes fall shut, and thought back to the last time Steve had come to him like this. Steve’s beautiful, strong hands clawing desperately at Tony’s back, his perfect lips devouring every inch of Tony’s skin, that low, pleading moaning as he fucked into him, again and again…
A fear that he wouldn’t be the person Bucky remembered, that he wouldn’t be able to help him, that he would somehow let him down.
And then of Tony would wonder whether he should just give it up and start from there. Accept what he’d done, and the realities of it, as a foundational part of his theorising…
- in the same tone he’d prepared for his intended, mission-specific, professional question. It was already shaping his lips, the air already gathering to push the words out of his mouth-
It was also because Tony had just worked out that he was that much closer to taking that next leap of faith with Steve. That, out of nowhere, tonight was apparently the night he told Steve he was in love with him - and everything that represented.
… Mostly, Steve just felt guilty for lying and sad to think that he’d lost Tony’s friendship. Honest.
“Oh Tony…” Steve breathed, his thumb still tracing over Tony’s cheek, his eyes shining with emotion. Tony felt it pooling in his stomach; something so familiar, even though he’d never felt it before. A warm sense of total security and perfect happiness, simmering with excited promise - an anticipation without tension, without limit…
He could drift back into that warm, quiet place that he’d fallen into when Steve had him cradled against his chest. That heady sense of contentment and security that he’d never known before.
Tony paused, and glanced out the window, and thought of all the world on the other side of it… all those big ideas, all those options, all those consequences. The chances he’d missed, and the chances he’d have to
out here. We trust that you love each other enough that you won’t do anything that is actually harmful – the actions that would rightly evoke a feeling of
to feel as horrified at himself and as distant from that behaviour as Captain America would’ve felt, if he’d found himself in the middle of something like that.
And… that was a more coherent and complete conclusion than Tony had managed to come to on anything, this week…
. So I guess it wasn’t so incredible when I called the weapons company a mistake, seeing as no one even
. I just keep finding myself about to put my hand on your shoulder, like it’s a habit I’ve had forever. And I
is that you can work out some of those things faster than the computer can” Tony smiled, laying his head down again. “I mean, SHIELD had a lot of different tests they used, but most of it comes down to problem solving. And, you know, if the person you’re testing just solves the problem the second you show it to him, and if the solution he comes up with is smarter than the computer simulation…” He mused. And then, in the same interested, conversational tone, he added “But, on the other hand, it turns out that all either of us have ever wanted was each other, and it took us seven years to solve that puzzle – so, I don’t know, maybe, actually, we’re both morons.”
, Tony, more than I can tell you…” Steve sighed, taking Tony’s hand and tugging him closer. “I never thought I’d have anyone who cared about me like this - especially not someone as wonderful as you…” He watched Tony take a deep breath, his lips pursing like he was about to say something… And then Tony gave his head a little shake, and tilted his head up to kiss Steve instead-
“So, I wanted to show you something,” Tony announced. “But now I’m thinking I should probably try to explain it first, or it won’t make sense why it’s such a big deal, so.”
He tried, but suddenly there was just no power left in him. Every inch of him felt heavy, his thoughts seemed thick and blurry in his head. And there was a stab of such brutal, anguished sadness in him as he acknowledged-
sorry for what happened, Tony,” Sam started, very carefully. “I’m sorry that we did all that without telling you, and that it took that long for it all to come out. It was stupid and it was short sighted… but it was never personal. It was just us… getting it wrong.
thinking about the details of it all, not like I see it now. I think, at one point, I had just accepted that I ‘screwed up that whole thing’, like it was one thing… and maybe, yeah, there were times I resented just how much had been fucked up by that mistake…”
And, even if Steve could go back, and redo everything from that moment onwards… Tony wasn’t sure that would be a good thing, either. Even if Steve
suggests that the Varians are fitting into their plan, not the other way around… Gimme a minute to have a look around here…”
Tony stroked his hands over Steve’s back, revelling in the shape of him, rocking very gently against his lap. Steve’s breath hitched, and then broke into an urgent whimper that Tony instantly wanted more of. He brought his hands to Steve’s chest again, pushing against him very gently, silently urging,
“Can you give me a minute?” And just like that he was walking, purposefully, away from them and out of the room…
“Oh, wait, this is Jerry Hallan, isn’t it?” Tony smiled. “I’ve seen his name in the government reports.”
He felt Steve’s fingertips dip into his back as he let go of an anguished moan, like a stifled scream. Panicked and frustrated and pleading and
“You showed him what?” Steve repeated, when Wanda didn’t answer him. She closed her mouth, her frown deepening - and then,  just when Steve was about to lose his patience, Rhodey spoke up,
This chapter also makes reference to the invasion of an alien planet and the enslavement of an alien race. This is discussed as an unambiguously horrific thing that obviously must be stopped, and, again, there are no graphic details given.
And then Tony’s hand curling under Steve’s shoulder, nails digging into Steve’s muscles, his other hand grabbing Steve roughly by the back of the neck. The solid pressure of Tony’s chest pressed hard against him. Tony used all of his strength to pull himself against Steve, grinding into him, forcing Steve’s head up so he could claim his mouth again. He kissed Steve like he was suffocating. Like he was trying to consume him. Steve felt his lungs burn and his head swim and didn’t think of the connection to breathing – he didn’t know he wasn’t. He’d forgotten he was supposed to.
And Tony’s voice finally cracked, and he was forced to look away as that one tear slid slowly down his face… And Steve let his forehead rest against Tony’s, one arm snaking tight around his waist.
“And you obviously have a problem with me going at all,” Tony observed, taking a lazy step into the room. All the hair on the back of Steve’s neck stood on end, his breathing overcoming every attempt he made to control it. All of a sudden he felt strangely
“And, I don’t know… I think I used to be someone who knew what people were talking about.” Tony confessed. “Like, that was…a ‘thing’, about me, once…”
An increasingly nonsensical diatribe about her family and her planet and her apparently venomous hatred for all humans… And Steve bit his lip, and told himself not to interrupt.
there was the shock?” Tony clarified – most of his attention still focused on the idea of Steve, somewhere off to the left of him, where he was refusing to look…
He’d worked out that it was likely to be a total waste of time. That he didn’t even know what he was hoping to find out, or how they would possibly use that information.
Tony glanced down at him, spread out on the sheets in only his underwear, his beautiful body so perfectly displayed…
Obviously, given the power to change things, Steve would’ve stopped every one of these crises before they started. He
I’d be saying it anyway, because it’s not an excuse, and it’s probably only my own short sightedness and denial that stopped it being obvious in the first place-”
So, even though he was worried about Steve, and even though he still felt for Steve, and even though he didn’t feel like this was a good option… he still knew it was the best option, when he just winced, playfully, and said,
All of his senses momentarily confused, Tony surrendered to the sheer immovability of him, throwing his arms around Steve’s neck and wrapping his legs tight around his waist. A thick wave of friction curled through his hips, mixing in with all the emotional upheaval and the physical shock and the sudden shift in his perceptions-
Steve still felt guilty for thinking that. After all, this had been such an ominous, overbearing concept in his life, for so long… Part of him felt obliged to have
Immediately, Tony wriggled up onto his knees, crawling closer to Steve – getting himself into position. Steve held his breath, as he stroked his hands over Tony’s ass, spreading him open-
And then Tony looked at Steve, just as Steve turned away from the frame… and looked right at him. Tony
“You know that means we can’t grow old together,” Tony reminded him. “We can’t have kids, we can’t have daytime BBQs with the neighbours.”
But they welled up in him anyway. Surged up in him, like floodwater. Crashed over him with the force of a tidal wave, something he barely had time to panic about before he
Oh God, Steve was being held by a black-market chemical weapons manufacturer, and Tony had no idea where-
“…For special occasions” Steve remembered, with a smile. He waited until the elevator doors had closed behind them before he pulled the cork free, and took a very cautious sniff
This cold, seizing terror that was almost calm, this sense of resignation in the face of something too horrible to accept…
The impromptu celebration for the newest Avengers at the end of their training, that ended up running long into the evening… The moment that Tony sidled up beside Steve and jokingly asked how it felt to be the dad of the group, and all Steve cared about was the fact that Tony had sought him out for a private conversation - that it felt like the two of them were part of something, separate to anything else...
So, expecting a token gift from the conference organisers, or one of the sponsors - or, if it was an especially nice surprise, something from Rhodey or Pepper - Tony stood up and called, casually,
Perhaps it was that he’d been so focused on his way back to Bucky - that he’d had an actual plan to channel all of his feelings into.
With that one line, everything stopped feeling distant and hypothetical and started to feel terribly real…
“We’re having breakfast with Tony and his boyfriend” She told him, already walking over to drag the next table closer. Tony forgot that he wasn’t supposed to flinch, hearing Steve called that. Luckily neither of their new friends were in any state to notice. “This is my husband Andrew, by the way”
Tony could see every detail of Steve, every shift in his muscles, every tiny movement in his limbs… Tony could
necessities. But the arrangement he had with Bucky basically took care of that. And his relationship with Bucky was…
The rest of his morning was spent bouncing between irritated and miserable, his head full of relentless, meaningless chatter… It was repetitive, and exhausting…
His hands still braced against Steve’s legs, Tony dropped his head and took the length of Steve’s cock into his mouth.
I just wanted to leave a note to say thank you to everyone who is still reading this, and who has taken the time to leave comments - i feel terrible about how behind I am with answering them! (DH has decided that *right now* would be a good time to sell our house... Why? But WHY?) But, in the mean time, please know how much it means!
Tony snatched a tissue from the box on his bedside table, wiping his hands far too roughly – completely disgusted with himself.
the phone number for it. He smiled at the way Tony’s face lit up when Zan finally handed it to him, the child-like joy that always flashed up in his eyes when he was given a new toy to play with...
in that look, such an overwhelming sense of clarity and security… Steve let himself exhale more deeply, a pleasant feeling of release spreading through his ribs.
“S’okay, no one ever remembers all the symptoms,” Tony muttered, still focused on filing in his theory. “And the pain, where does it run to?”
Steve just held his breath, every inch of his being frozen in painful alarm – like an animal under the gaze of a predator.
“Okay,” Nat shrugged. Steve looked up at her before he could think to stop himself, regretting it as soon as he met her eyes. Suddenly, he felt naked. “Well, we were actually just about to head up to the bar, so, if you’re done with working late, you should come and join us.”
that he might understand Thor being sensitive, and even try to avoid that hurt for him… without having to accept a blanket responsibility for everything?
?” He repeated, barely above a whisper. Tony’s face softened, a vulnerable sort of earnestness in his eyes when he answered,
. And it confused all of Tony’s senses, how something that tender could be that intense, how it could be so gentle and yet so
And then he felt Tony shake his other hand free, so that he could move closer and place it on Steve’s shoulder.
. Now, for the first time ever, Steve found himself wondering whether Nat had changed over the course of their fight against Hydra, or if he’d just had the chance to get to know her… Whether she’d addressed his fears that she was cold and self-interested and disloyal, or simply disproved them…
to do for you, and it’s important that you keep that in mind.” She assured him. And Tony just found himself nodding…
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t know what he wanted. For all the confusion he felt at the moment, Steve was completely and entirely sure that he wanted to be Tony’s – that he wanted it
him. An ever-clearer idea of what it would really be like, to share a moment that intimate and that powerful, to be that closely bonded to one another. A rapidly building pleasure in that idea, a growing excitement at the prospect…and it was warm, and giving, and
He thought about kissing him, but he didn’t trust himself to stop after a minute – and he really couldn’t complicate Steve’s escape plan and have Sam shot down over the Tower or something. Not tonight. So, instead he stepped forward and put a tender hand over Steve’s heart, and told him.
Tony was standing at the counter of the kitchenette in the breakroom, his eyes locked in the middle distance, a mug of coffee cooling rapidly in his hands. Just for a change, it wasn’t anything Steve-related that had his attention - for a few, brief moments, Tony had allowed his thoughts to drift into details of his latest suit upgrade, and had quite happily gotten lost there-
And it felt so good not to have to find an answer. To be able to let Tony take him by the hand, and lead the way, and not have to scrabble to think of what to do next…
“And I know you’ve told her bigger lies than that, even when she was your girlfriend, and I’m not saying it’s the same – I’m just saying that, just because you lie, or even if you mess up, it doesn’t mean you don’t love that person,” Steve told him, carefully, like he wasn’t sure if he was stepping onto thin ice.
And even though Steve was choosing to leave forever, even though he never expected to see this world again… Still, it was so very sad.
“...I think we were all sort of… pushing the Hulk to his room,” Sam remembered out loud, “and then this was just the next nearest one…”
And Tony would’ve liked to analyse the science of that. It might’ve helped to analyse the sociology or morality of it, if only so that he could answer her. He would’ve liked himself more, if he’d been immediately repulsed to hear this coloniser and slave driver call a conquered land by a new name. This would have been a good moment to remember the importance of what they were doing, the relative insignificance of anything else that was going on.
“...We’re looking for something draining a lot of power,” he remembered, aloud. “Or some sign that this place isn’t just a power station, or some sign that they’re hiding something…”
“Rogers. I know Pepper told you all about it,” Tony bit out, suddenly feeling very exposed. Only just realising that he
All as high end as any other room they’d been in – the effect of which was starting to wear off the more Steve got used to it, and what does that tell you about human nature? Now that he looked, there were a few couples getting especially friendly on the couches at the very back of the room… so apparently they were getting on for that time of the day… Behind him, somewhere far off to the left, Steve just about caught the movement of someone coming out from behind the bar he was leaning on.
“Jesus, I have missed you,” he managed eventually, letting his head rest on Steve’s hip. Steve grinned, and ran a hand through his hair.
And then, suddenly, Tony was awake – somehow surprised and not at all surprised to find he was alone in his bedroom.
“Do you know anything about the Varian slaves that work at The Facility?” Steve began, his tone neutral and perfunctory – but still, Tony saw Maribelle flinch just a little at the use of the word.
And then, of course, whatever little detail he’d been thinking about would suddenly seem completely unimportant, and he’d feel ridiculous for trying to be sensible about anything, when clearly they were so far beyond it now-
And, thinking back, Happy hadn’t seemed nearly as affected by Steve’s mood as Wesley, or Nick, or even that CEO… Aware of the atmosphere, certainly. More nervous than he’d usually be. But he, and the nurse, and the rest of the staff, seemed able to contain their response to a few shifty looks and a slightly stiff demeanour… None of
“Don’t suppose there’s any chance that underground gang-lords just like prostitutes, is there?” Tony cut in, his eyes still fixed on his phone screen. Steve shot him a disapproving glare – and was deeply irritated that Tony didn’t look up to see it.
castigate someone for taking a pleasant stroll around 1940s Brooklyn, and thinking only of the novelty of it. He wouldn’t automatically assume that person was selfish or shallow for not keeping Steve’s story in mind the whole time… He wouldn’t expect them to.
Somewhere, Tony felt the realisation begin to stir - just an uneasy sense of awareness, for now. He still couldn’t picture what Steve was talking about, he still couldn’t thread these ideas together…
And then he went to take that first ungainly stride towards the patio - and realised that he hadn’t been standing on the floor of the pool, as he’d assumed. The layer of plastic balls he was actually standing on rolled away from him the moment he moved, and Steve found himself sinking a foot deeper with a surprised huff. There was another delighted giggle from Tony, as Steve tried to wriggle upwards, to get his head above the surface.
“Not much,” he answered, apologetically. “Most of the Project Rebirth file is experiment results and project notes… But… it did mention… Consorts…”
he’d put behind that wall. He didn’t see that he’d slipped from talking about Tony to talking about everything…
in that moment. And, watching him like that, seeing the familiar shape of his body and that little flicker of thought in his eyes… For a few seconds, Steve just
kind of infuriating that you’re going this hard to sabotage yourself, which is the only reason I’m not trying to shut him up… Well, that and I’ve had a lot of water…”
. It looked like a warehouse that had been hastily repurposed as an office, like most of the buildings they’d driven past in this sprawling, industrial neighbourhood.
much that you could offer them, if only you would,” she went on. “It’s not that I don’t think anyone would be lucky to have you – if you’d just
“We’d never get anything done,” Steve replied mindlessly, his breath catching as he felt the breeze across his stomach.
“Hi,” Steve beamed, full of hope and excitement, and maybe just a few nerves of his own. The burst of affection Tony felt for him was strong enough to push all of his concerns aside, at least for the moment.
“I’m sorry!” He exclaimed immediately, even through his giggles. “I’m not laughing at that, I swear.”
took a sharp little breath, as Tony finally made contact with the wall - which was, objectively speaking, rather endearing.
For as long as he was being brave, and thinking about things… Tony had to acknowledge that biting Steve felt like it simply
Too late, Steve looked up in an attempt to get his bearings. He found that he and Tony were moving slowly through what looked like the players tunnel on the way into a stadium - except with far more people… just a sea of strangers, fenced in on either side by featureless concrete walls-
that everything was okay. This was a genuine clarity, his mind moving more efficiently, without the mental clutter – this was him
“We gave him a mild sedative, just to keep him here, it’ll wear off, it’s safe, I promise, please, I swear to God-”
He found himself wondering what it would be like the mornings after Steve bit him - whether, maybe, this urge to
“Well something’s up with you,” Tony informed him. “You’ve been acting weird since I got here. And since you’re apparently waiting for someone to ask, fine, I’m asking – what’s going on?”
they were at. The briefest glimpse of it was enough to set off a chain of sense memories… The hushed whisper his father had used whenever he mentioned it... the way the air had changed, that one time Tony had asked about it…
And Steve had now spent eight days reliving those few tense seconds, helplessly overthinking all the possible reasons and ramifications, and, more than anything else, dreading what would happen if Tony asked about it…
sorry for snapping at you – especially when you were on your way out to a mission. I mean, not that I think I have the power to put you off, or anything, but… I don’t know, it’s probably challenging enough… having to cuddle up to Clint in a criminal den, without me throwing more stress your way…”
“Hey, I know that’s my issue.” Tony clarified “It’s not his fault, the things I might think about when I see him… So,
And then Tony was standing up. Stepping away from Bucky. Putting his tools down and dropping his shoulders.
are you-” Tony stammered, already on his feet and striding over to the wide glass doors at the other end of the room. He caught the shape of Steve, concealed in the shadows and partly obscured by Tony’s own reflection… But still, Tony knew him at once. He gave a jagged wave of his hand and the door slid open… and there he was. Standing there in jeans and a short sleeved T-shirt, his jaw clenched against the cold, little flecks of icy rain sparking in his hair.
still pissed that Bucky had gone to see Tony without him… although, if he was being fair, it probably wasn’t that he was annoyed
Oh, that was an entirely different sort of nostalgia. A cold, curling sensation low in his gut; the sort of fear you can only come up with as a kid, but remember all your life.
hadn’t forced these compromises on people; as long as he was making the best of his circumstances, rather than creating them...
It was that mentality that he’d fallen back into last night. A hard stop on the noise in his head, a plain refusal to think about the doubt and the guilt and the things that weren’t helpful. He would
about this introduction, before it snuck up and caught him completely off guard. He’d spent the last six months considering every aspect of his relationships with different people, all the different ways a person could be judged, all the moral questions he had to ask himself about the way he treated others…
And then, as he’d grown closer to Steve, that conflict had changed. Now, Tony wanted to know more about him because he was interested. The temptation to explore these new and wonderful ideas was so much stronger, now that there
“No one here is Hydra. I don’t think any of my employers have any history with that organisation – but, I mean,
…And he thought of Tony, in the nano-tech armour. The way it melted around his body, even as Tony moved-
Tony could be okay, what mechanism had protected Tony from harm… and protected Bucky from hurting him. He’d already made a few drowsy enquiries, as Steve and Tony had helped him to his feet last night – and Tony had just smiled, and said that everything was fine, and that Steve would explain it later…
And Tony turned around, and flashed what probably did look like a very drunken grin – because Steve had just called him
“Jesus Tony,” Steve whispered, breathless and shaky and emotional. Tony lifted his head, one hand stroking up to cup Steve’s face, guiding Steve to look at him.
Even in that moment, at his most overwhelmed and emotional, Steve knew he didn’t want to stay here. He knew this wasn’t the only place he’d ever think of as home, and he knew that sometimes it was right to leave home - and he knew that this wasn’t where he would be happiest, wherever ‘home’ was to him.
…” And he did his best to gesture at the difference, the proportion of his ‘hurt’ scale that sat over and above his ‘Steve’s mistakes’ indicator. “The reason it hurt
And it meant that Steve could feel a little bit touched that Tony had chosen to sit in the back seat with him tonight.
“Oh, God, Tony, I’m so sorry,” Steve gasped, hardly able to process how very sorry he was. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that to sound so- I don’t even know why I said that at all. I’m just - I’m sorry.”
Oh, he thought he was finished with priority point one… he’d said something about the drugs and just ticked it off the list, and now…
Of course, Tony knew that quick assessments were risky. But an educated guess would suggest that Wesley wasn’t trying to
Enough that it could blot out all the usual noise entirely… but with something light, and easy, and pure.
you’re sorry much, are you?” Tony started, his voice warm and good humoured. And a blush coloured Steve’s cheeks, and he pinched his lips together in a little self depreciating smile, and nodded –
was probably the wrong word… but it was certainly true that, when he thought of Steve so willingly baring his neck, so completely giving himself to that experience, so happy to let Tony take whatever he needed, Tony wanted to be able to do the same. For Steve to know that he would submit to Steve’s needs as readily, trust Steve just as much, gladly share in every part of his life...
there were guards in that direction. And then he peeked again, this time towards the back of the tower. He managed a reasonable look at the door they’d be aiming for, and again, he didn’t
“As promised,” he told her breathlessly, his hand shaking slightly as he thrust the final stone in her direction.
He felt like a devout man who had suddenly lost all faith in God. The worst part was that he still wanted to be angry at God, that he had to keep correcting his own internal logic - that he didn’t know what to correct it to. He’d relied on this unspoken understanding for so long that he’d forgotten where it had even come from.
… I’d just convinced half the Avengers to quit the team and become criminals, all to stop a threat that wasn’t even real. I’d fucked the entire political landscape and left you with all that stress, and I hadn’t even told you why I was doing it… You never had a chance to make that work, and I didn’t even warn you… And what happened with Rhodey, and what happened in the bunker and… I just thought, after everything I’d done, you wouldn’t want to hear about how I
“And these are… that, I take it?” Steve asked, as the others followed their curiosity and each picked up a flower of their own.
that he wasn’t changing his lifestyle over it?” Steve reminded him – and Bucky just rolled his eyes.
In fact, Steve made it to his usual parking spot in just under seven minutes – which was soon as he could possibly have been there, without endangering other drivers on the road.
The fact that Rhodey had never tried to speak for him, never presumed he couldn’t handle himself, that he’d never felt obliged or entitled to make choices on Tony’s behalf - at least, not until Tony had reached the point of a genuine breakdown. The fact that Rhodey loved him
All of a sudden, everything felt so much closer and more vivid - like every sensation in the world was being drawn into him.
. Because Tony’s self-imposed isolation made him so much more interesting to everyone – and made Rhodey interesting to some especially heartless people.
moment, when Steve first recognised that he simply couldn’t keep hiding from himself like that - that he couldn’t keep distancing himself from Tony like that.
doing to stop the evils of capitalism and competition and social judgement of so many people?” Adam demanded, a distinct edge on his voice all of a sudden “Do you not feel complicit, in all the things we could stop
If everything went as badly as it possibly could - if Hydra knew exactly who had attacked their base in Siberia, and had figured out that their cover was blown, and had managed to mobilise their entire organisation earlier that evening - then Steve already knew exactly which measures Tony had put in place to conceal and protect the house, and the various ways in which they could escape, and the hundreds of pre-approved locations they could run to. And, as of fifteen minutes ago, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill, and even Clint and Natasha, had received the packs of carefully selected data and contact details. No more than Steve wanted any of them to know, but enough that they’d be able to mount an immediate defence, whilst Steve focused on
“No, it isn’t, because we’re missing the best part,” Bucky corrected, deliberately swallowing his grin.
One Sunday afternoon a few weeks later, and Bucky found himself aimlessly wandering around the house again.
, he could only accept what Tony told him… And maybe that meant it was only a minor reprieve. Maybe that made it an exercise in denial, or play pretend. But still, it was nice. Just for a moment, Steve could really believe it
Slowly, Steve remembered the things that he would usually think in this situation - apparently, those were so hard-wired that he could recite them to himself, even in this state-
“It takes an awful lot to get me drunk.” Steve smiled, taking one of the shots from the tray. It was a dark amber colour, and it smelled of almonds.
people – would live their whole lives never knowing elation as pure and overwhelming as this. In reality, most people
“I have no idea,” Steve groaned. But he was glad Bucky was awake. He felt better, having someone to panic with.
fantasy you’re going to enact. That person agrees to take control of the situation, the other person agrees to comply with it.”
“I don’t even mean drunk, I just mean…” Tony blushed, trying to think how he could rescue this “I don’t know. We never got to talk all that much, I guess is all I mean.”
What, he was too volatile to work on a side project, but not too self-obsessed to be handed responsibility for national security?
He was so encouraged by this unexpected boost that, for a good few minutes, Steve actually found himself paying attention to what these dry old files said.
By now, he could appreciate the true scale of the tower - easily 200 storeys tall, and covering as much floor space as a warehouse. It was set in a concrete courtyard; a smooth, paved area that separated the building from the scorched grass, like a moat. To the right, there was another vast, asphalted space that looked as though it might’ve been a parking lot - except that it was entirely empty.
“Honestly… I’ve never given a single thought to being in this situation. Because I just knew I never would be,” Tony explained, sitting up so that he could slip his shirt over his shoulders. “And I have a lifetime’s worth of reasons to… think about, I guess. All the reasons I can’t have what I want… which were all the reasons this would never happen… so, now I just… don’t know.”
stopped to ask myself if I would want that… And, yeah, thinking about it… Maybe I wasn’t thinking about that sort of relationship, before. Maybe I was picturing myself being devoted to you, and perfect for you, or something… And I
It was all he could do to get a hold of Tony now; his movements were so erratic and determined and frenetic. Tony’s hands were all over him, groping at his shoulders and his arms and his chest and his hips, kissing every inch of Steve that he could reach. Steve clawed at Tony’s back just as desperately,  panting for breath, rocking his hips up against Tony’s. Indulging in that friction without even knowing he was doing it, unable to distinguish that pleasure from all the other sensations running through him,
“Because - your father had… He had more samples of the super soldier serum with him, when he died,” Steve managed, finding it so hard to force the words out that they seemed to tear his throat on the way up - but he carried on with it. He
Instead, he simply carried through with the heavy movements of his limbs, falling from one step to the next in a comfortable trance…
“I think I did… something bad…” Bucky tries to explain, as that revelation carries on unfolding. “...Or… lots of bad things…”
“Open your other present, and then you can try it on,” Tony told him, a more imminent heat simmering in his tone. Steve felt it pulsing all the way through his hips, his cock pressed hard against his stomach now, weeping steadily into the fabric of his robe. The wet material dragged across the head of his cock as he grabbed for the second gift, adding an unexpected shock of friction to the electric anticipation gathering up the small of his back-
“No, I get it,” Tony smiled, sincerely. “I mean… I’ve kind of thought a similar thing. And, you know, then felt guilty about it, just like this. But, I think what I mean is… I don’t know, they say you should be with someone who has similar life experience, right?”
So, Steve knew that he had to get a hold of himself in time to continue his explanation in the calm, measured way he intended…
, technically,” Scaramouche corrected, with a proud grin. “Bulsara exists in the space between realities, only accessible by special invitation - it is a place famous throughout all universes as a world of great experience, great knowledge, and great pleasure.”
“Good,” Tony smiled back. “The other thing is, I’m going to need to know about the composition and pressure of your spinal fluid. The simplest way of getting that is a lumbar puncture – but those are painful. Lots of people don’t like those. The other option is to let JARVIS do a scan – but that involves sitting in a machine, a bit like an MRI machine, for about forty-five minutes. I mean, it’s not
There were, in among the papers he flinched from and the books he was avoiding, a few pages Tony kept going back to. Passages he’d read over and over, phrases that he’d thought back to again and again.
,” Tony intervened more firmly - mainly to ward off the slightly dizzy panic of just how fucked up this situation could really be… “
“If they’re dosing the water, or the air… or any other way they’re doing it, they must have a distribution system somewhere on this site.” Steve observed, his voice more assured now that Captain America was using it.
Flustered now, he reached for his water glass, more looking for a way to cover his face than anything else. It wasn’t until he took a sip that he realised how thirsty he was…
Steve suddenly remembered his earlier revelation. He realised how well it fit into everything he was thinking, right now… that he’d
Steve let it overwhelm him. He gladly got lost in an endless moment where everything felt good, where there was nothing but how much he loved Tony and how wonderful the world was…
They’d both been warned against such lapses of concentration on the orientation. Steve remembered sitting in a poorly air-conditioned room in one of the regional offices, trying not to smile as a SHIELD middle manager explained what was considered ‘unprofessional behaviour’. No checking your phone. No eating on the job. No dropping your weapon.
“No, we probably have to wait until they’re actually doing something down there, for it to be any use looking at it.” Tony sighed, obviously thinking the same thing Steve was.
Now, Steve could so clearly see how fragile Tony was, how hard he was trying, how brave he was being… he couldn’t understand how he’d ever missed it.
“Because I checked,” Steve sighed, sadly. “And, not that I’ve been out of that house much since I got there, but I checked every time I got back, too. And I know exactly how to check - because Fury
There was the page that looked like it had been pulled from a sample book - although hand drawn, like the rest of them - with all the different lace patterns, and the captions he couldn’t read...
“I sincerely promise no one else will ever see it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. And Tony smiled.
nothing wrong being scarred by the things we’ve been through. There’s nothing weird or unexpected about being changed by those things - that doesn’t mean you’re worse than you were. I am not judging you, or blaming you, for coming out of the end of the world a little bit nuts… But that doesn’t mean it’s not nuts. Just because I understand where this irrational fear is coming from, doesn’t mean it’s not irrational. Just because I love every single thing about you, doesn’t mean I’m going to go along with every impulse you ever have. And I’m not going to let you walk into a bunker full of super soldiers on your own, because a lifetime's worth of trauma has made you
“I have something I have to tell you,” Tony sighed. “Well, two things, really…” And then he took a step back and gestured into the house.
Every step they took was liable to roll away from them. It seemed that every time they slipped, they ended up surfacing two steps back. Steve’s attempt to sink to the bottom and walk to the side was thwarted, when he couldn’t push the plastic balls out of his path. Tony’s attempt to swim to the side faltered at the first giggling attempt-
This little garden seemed more crowded, and more intimate, than anywhere in that hall. Steve liked the feeling of the breeze on his skin… He liked that they’d been making polite conversation with these same people just a moment ago.
“So, what happens now?” Steve asked, still smiling. Glancing between Tony and Bucky, who was still finding his feet.
” Bucky breathed, sloping over and falling into the couch beside him. “Well, for a start, he doesn’t hate you. You know, he would never have invited me to move in with you guys, if he didn’t think of
“I’m sorry, I really wasn’t expecting you to say that,” Tony giggled, his whole body still alive with laughter, his eyes shining and his lips curved into the prettiest smile…
He left a little pause, just long enough for them to share a confused look, before he took a little step into their personal space to add,
scary questions. He could idly wonder what it would be like to grow old with Steve, or marry him, or have his kids... He wasn’t even uncomfortable about it.
. They lied to me from the moment I woke up. They decided I wasn’t ready to hear what year it was and sent an agent in a costume to lie to me. They brought me in to retrieve the Tesseract with no intention of telling me what they were using it for. They never told me who else they were bringing in - they never even told me you would be there. Nick was sending me on ‘compartmentalised missions’ for years, and if
…Okay, maybe this hurt more than it would have if anyone else had chosen Clint… Immediately… Without even thinking about it…
was turning to shit all over again… And thinking basically that. Like I’d had this big, life changing moment where everything was supposed to be different, and if I went back to my old ways after that, then it wasn’t really a big life changing moment at all, and maybe I’m just…” He flashed Steve a self deprecating smile,
seem to be wearing off… I think…” Tony muttered to himself, scanning the room again. “...And if the effects are different for each of us, then they probably haven’t brought us here to subject us to the drugs, as such - not if they can’t tell what the effects are going to be…”
He went to pull away, and Tony knew it was to stop him from healing him, to keep the wound open, to make Tony drink more-
Whether this was him figuring it out at last, or finally confronting something he’d known for a long time, he wasn’t sure - but Steve was genuinely taken aback by how quickly and clearly the real problem came to him.
And then the smile vanished completely, as he realised that the truth was probably even more pathetic.
“Steve,” he murmured, running his eyes down over Steve’s chest, already lifting his arms to grab for him-
been in contact with Tony Stark,” Nick observed, slipping into that more familiar, manipulative tone voice.
“Well, I mean, if you’re sure you don’t mind…” he replied, quietly. Thinking of how to say that he wanted to keep this thing under wraps, without it sounding offensive-
“Some people,” he answered, with an unsure smile. There was a little prickle of anticipation over his skin, some instinctive warning that something was about to happen… But Tony wasn’t sure what exactly he’d picked up on…
“Okay…” Tony heard himself answer, very softly. And then there was a moment of thick silence… not uncomfortable exactly, but very
. That he’d had plenty of anxieties before it ever occurred to him that he might bite Steve, that all those worries were still as real and as important as they’d ever been.
Trying to work out how Tony felt about him, trying to unlearn everything he thought he knew yesterday.
Hoping that Bucky was better off in the long run, for not having Steve’s issues to deal with on top of his own.
And, of course, every inch of Steve had was already pulling towards Tony. Almost every voice in his head was simply shouting
trying to get better. I’m trying to listen. And, for what it’s worth… I actually think you’re right. About all of this. These are good points, and this is a better plan than… anything I was thinking about doing…”
...And, okay, Tony could probably convince himself that it was probably all part of the same irrational panic. That he’d simply ‘gotten it into his head’ that this was important for Steve, that it was
It occurred to him that Steve had probably struck Wesley in the shoulder, rather than the head - which was the better option, he supposed. Okay, that particularly nasty break in Wesley’s collarbone might never properly heal… But at least he was responsive, and coherent, and didn’t seem to be having any sensory issues...
There was too much light, for one thing. Every available surface seemed to be glowing with illuminated images and colourful displays… Everything is a soft neon pallet of rose pink and sky blue and bright, brilliant white. As his eyes adjusted, Tony was able to pick out the holograms shimmering in the air… far more advanced than anything he’d ever seen before...
For a few seconds Steve just stood there, staring at the space Tony had left behind, listening the ringing silence left in his wake.
And then there was a pregnant pause, as Tony willed himself to push ahead with it. Trying to think of something he could add that would sound final, some way to ease them towards that conclusion. Dismissing all the options, because none of them sounded right…
But now that he thought about it, it made far more sense that Tony Stark had simply decided that another one of his fathers projects was potentially more profitable. That he hadn’t suddenly grown a sense of responsibility so much as decided to be irresponsible about something else.
But Tony snatched him up by his lapels, and lifted him two feet into the air, and held him there as he told him,
He looked up just in time to see Bucky hurling the back of the chair at one of the guards, knocking her prone. Her partner was still in a state of shock as Bucky took two strides forward – bits of the chair still tied to each leg – and hit him once right between the eyes.
“Jesus Tony please yes,” Steve pleaded, grabbing hold of Tony by the hips and doing everything he could to grind up into him. Tony simply carried on moving down Steve’s chest, kissing him greedily, one hand eventually finding its way to the waistband of Steve’s jeans. “Don’t care if you tear those either,” Steve panted, bucking up against Tony’s hand. He felt Tony’s dark laugh, hot against his skin, and then the friction of denim being yanked down over his legs – and he didn’t even know if Tony
It was hard enough to even listen to what Belle was saying. Analysing any of it could fuck right off.
“This is Franciszek’s office, on this floor” She spoke quickly, not looking either of them in the eye “He’ll come back here once or twice, while he’s here tonight – or, I don’t know if you can get him to come back here. From here on out, it’s on you.” There was a sudden edge on her voice when she said that. But still, she didn’t look at them. “But no one will bother you here, and I did my best to cut the security tapes, so that’s all I can do.”
Or pacing erratically from one end of the room to the other, wondering if he’d let it all go too far, if there was any way of pulling it back…
And then he saw Tony sit up, his eyes snapping to a fixed point somewhere beyond the balcony railing. He turned to look, even though he already knew.
He could picture waking up in Steve’s arms every morning, and kissing those beautiful lips whenever he wanted to…
He saw Nat shift her weight, subtly slipping as far into combat stance as she could without completely breaking character.
“I take it Natasha told you about me?” He said, turning in his chair before he stood up to face him.
time he and Bucky had sex… Just hearing Steve say how turned on he’d been after seeing Tony… not really thinking about the Bucky element of that story at all, now that he thought back…
Because, for the first time in God only knows how long… he was perfectly happy where he was, right now.
He imagined a hundred hypothetical futures they could possibly share. He’d panicked about every way he could potentially hurt Steve, and daydreamed about every way he could potentially please him, he’d been desperately sad to think of all the things they could never have, and overwhelmingly excited to think of everything that, maybe, they
to be a vampire… Maybe he’d have just been delighted to find someone he wanted to go that step further with. Elated that Steve felt it too. Focused on making Steve happy, and keeping him safe, and just
He’d been ashamed of all the unanswerable questions he’d laid on Steve’s shoulders, guilty for every awful, empty future that he
He’d not thought that maybe it would be easy and natural and nice. That he’d end up changing his entire outlook without even realising.
Steve threw a begrudging little wince in the direction of the Operation Rebirth files, feeling like a kid who’d come home from the fair and remembered that he still had homework to do…
For a start, Tony hated being unprepared. He couldn’t do the equations unless he had all the variables – and, on this occasion, he had
When he looked up again, Tony had that same smile on his face, that moment of identity with another person… that was encouraging, at least.
Would Steve feel free to be himself in any sort of personal relationship, if he was also acting as a donor? Would he be completely free to lose his temper or storm off after an argument or have a bad day of his own, if there was this burning physical obligation between them at all times?
Which was why there was still an elated grin on Tony’s face as he threw himself onto the workshop couch.
okay for you not to be okay with that.” Tony forced himself on, when it became obvious that Steve wasn’t going to speak any time soon. “It is okay to have a line. You simply existing doesn’t mean you have to take on every… torture, the world can dish out, just to make up for other people being bastards. And you have flown a plane into the arctic, and you did try very hard to go down with that helicarrier, and, idiot that you are, you did decide to run head on at Thanos’ entire army, so, I don’t think anyone could say you’d not done enough, if you said this was your line. And it’s a fair line, by the way. I don’t think anyone would ask you to explain that, I think they’d know.”
The overwhelming release of tension, the indescribable relief of putting down a weight that he hadn’t even known he was carrying.
“I sent out an electro magnetic pulse as soon as we arrived, which should’ve shut down any cameras,” Tony continued, turning his attention to the side of the building. “So they don’t know who’s out here yet, but they know somethings up – you should be prepared for them to come to you,” he warned.
“Then neither is what I said about Bucky, today.” Tony asserted more firmly. “I…I tried to hurt your friend, and you, I could’ve – and you begged me not to. And if I think of you,
“Ah, yes,” Scaramouche conceded, bowing his head slightly, “terrible shame that, but I gather that the others weren’t with you, when the transfer was initiated?”
Some mild sub/dom themes are explored, although there is no threat of pain, punishment, withholding or humiliation, and it's all very consensual. I think it's pretty safe, but if you have any specific triggers, please feel free to contact me.
That heat pulsed lower, Steve’s cock throbbing hard as he replayed it in his head. He forced his shoulders to relax again, a warm contentment swelling up in him as he watched Tony smile, and nod,
And because it never felt like his place to have an opinion on what happened. He’d never felt like he knew enough about the history or the context… And it certainly would’ve felt like a liberty to offer any sort of opinion to Tony.
thought a truth serum was a really weird thing for a government to want to invent. I wonder if, when they were faced with it, a lot of agents, politicians didn’t rethink that…”
, there is nothing wrong with being nuts,” Tony said, quite seriously. “...I use words like that to take the fear out of it, and I suppose I shouldn’t, really… Because it makes it sound like I’m not being sincere, and I am. There
He pulled Steve’s fingers to his lips with the nervous excitement of someone stepping into a first kiss. Knowing it was right, and wanted, and natural. Not wondering if there was more to it, anymore.
Tony felt himself slip into contingency mode, shutting his reaction down as much as possible so as to give nothing away - looking to leave his options open, while he gathered more data.
the sudden personal confusion, to think rationally, to focus purely on the problem he was there to fix.
with Tony, so complicated. That he wouldn’t be nearly as worried about these new impulses, if it weren’t for Tony-
Steve was desperate to fill that gap, desperate to explain himself or make his case again or, just –
All of this had run through Tony’s brain so quickly that he was still able to answer on the second ring.
. That maybe he should have some understanding of such a big event in Tony’s life, if he wanted to share that life with him…

Anni Vara.” And he expanded his arms, like he was preaching from a pulpit, glancing up to the sky before he carried on.
And those people might have lives free of pain and sacrifice and conflict. They might get to live their entire lives never knowing the loss that Steve had gone through time and time again. But those people –
counter arguments – even when it turns out a family if evil aliens have compromised your entire theory, right under your nose – and
far too much, to think of Tony drinking from anyone else. There was no way they could build a relationship if it relied on Steve accepting that…
Tony was standing a few steps away from him now. Steve wasn’t sure when that had happened, but it didn’t matter… he just had to tell Tony-
But, by the time Tony had made it over to the coffee pot, he’d remembered why it was complicated. The smile became a vaguely irritated frown as all his many issues tried to crowd into his head at once. He told himself that he had to get a grip, and sort all of this out, and think about it properly –
His other thoughts immediately fell silent, like a room full of screaming children hearing their mother yell in
“Well, I don’t think it has to be either or,” Rhodey mused. “I mean, even if you decide you’re not going to be in any more showcases, or whatever - it’s still nice that you say, ‘thank you for the flower’, and that you’re nice to people when you meet them.”
destined to do, because it’s just who I am, I don’t… I don’t know what I’m scared of,” he acknowledged at last, his shoulders dropping as he unburdened himself of the weight. “I just know that every time I think of that bunker… of the three of us being there again… I get this horrible, ominous feeling that the gods themselves have been warning me about this for ten whole years… And I can’t find a way to convince myself it’s stupid. I can’t help this horrible fear that it would be more stupid
about that. I still should’ve thought about that side of things, rather than just discounting it, cos it wasn’t the bit
Even though this was all so unlike him, so different from anything he’d done in the last twenty years, it still seemed so natural. Like coming home. Even though he hadn’t been in this head for so very long, and even though he had a whole other life he’d built somewhere far, far away… he could never really be a
“Oh God, Tony, fuck,” Steve whined, working himself off against Tony’s grip. Tony let his robe fall open, relishing in the abrasive burn of Steve’s uniform against his skin, the teasing hint of contact against the base of his own cock.
The pleasure of it flooded Tony’s body like liquid fire, almost unbearably intense after all that longing - and still not enough.
Occasionally glancing at the carry case on the seat beside him. Like he was expecting it to move, or something.
“You okay?” Steve panted, waiting until Tony had given him a helpless little nod before he looked up to survey the situation.
In fact, he’d decided to stop thinking about ‘the vampire thing’ altogether, for the time being… It was too big a topic, and too vague a question... And he had to drop
told Steve that he wanted to – that it was simply too late. That it took power and mental capacity to drink from another person, that was all-
And Steve was absolutely certain that Tony wanted to fuck him right now… but that wasn’t the same thing.
. In ways he was only just waking up enough to recognise. He felt physically better, still thrumming with the joy of relief, the absence of tension and pain that he’d taken for granted. His mind felt quieter and calmer, even with all the images and ideas and questions that were starting to run though it… like a grating background noise had been cut.
,” he implored, not even looking at her – already scanning Steve’s appointment calendar for the afternoon. “External Comms Meeting?” He hissed, incredulous, when he saw that there was no location, or contact, or…
… And, if his flashbacks to last night had any validity whatsoever, Tony wasn’t sure he had any dignity left to worry about.

“Yes, God-” he cried, his head falling back, his whole body falling apart as the sensation crashed through him. And just as it burned itself out, tightening into that need for more, Steve pushed into him again – harder. Tony called out, trying for something like
“I said I love you,” Tony repeated - finding it a little harder that time, but only because the emotion of it was starting to make his chest feel tight. “I’m in love with you, I know I am.”
So he made himself look down, to where Steve was still just lying quite comfortably, his eyes soft and his hair all messed up…
Which was the main reason it was taking him so long to get through this. He’d skimmed the entire folder more than once, but he still felt obliged to read it line by line - and, apparently, that wasn’t something he could focus on for longer than thirty begrudging minutes at a time.
And then he took a little breath, and Tony just knew he was steeling himself for something. He could see the way he pursed his lips, like he
Amongst the first of his regrets was that he’d stubbornly insisted on an event so far away from the hotel. Given that, really, Steve could’ve had this temper tantrum anywhere, he could at least have saved them all from having to trek this far in the midday heat.
“Oh, God, Tony…” Steve whispered, caressing his palms into Tony’s back, his arms trembling slightly… He might even have been crying, softly.
so much better than that - at least, they were for Steve. The future he looked forward to now was so happy and hopeful and vibrant, it made all versions of the old world look sad and shallow in comparison.
Steve glanced up and saw Tony peeling the pillowcase away from his shoulder, his forehead creased with harmless distaste. That same sheepish grin pulled at Steve’s lips again as he looked away… and saw his shirt, snagged on the corner of the bedside table…
He climbed back onto the bed, kneeling between Steve’s legs. And then he placed a gentle hand on Steve’s hip, and whispered,
Asking that question was simply something that he’d learned to do, something he associated with moments like these on a very basic level.
Steve’s balls clenched uncomfortably, jarring against the heady satisfaction he’d almost slipped into.
Initially, Steve had tried to explain his objection to eating unfamiliar foods on a planet where everything conspired to get them high… But he’d given up when everyone got too high to listen to him. Now, he was in that wearily familiar position of being the only sober one at the party, getting increasingly irritated by how ridiculous everyone else was being and hating himself for it…
“Steve I’m going to come, I can’t, I want, I - please, I-” Tony whined, his words coming higher and faster as that pressure grew. And he
… I mean… Part of me thinks it might be worth considering it as a route in. That it might be useful to know what’s going on inside SHIELD. Maybe even find another Hydra base, since you’re still so edgy about that bunker,” he paused to squeeze Steve’s hand reassuringly, and kept hold of it as he continued, “And, more than that… If this much has changed, then we can’t be sure of anything that’s going to happen, right? I mean, the way you tell it, Loki was drawn to earth's work on the Tesseract, or used it… if that’s already changing, then we have no way to be
“Okay, we’ll start with that,” Tony decided. “Scan every file for any references to Steve Rogers, Operation Rebirth, vampires, blood or plasma treatments, blood or plasma research studies, historical or genealogical studies of any specific families that date back 200 years or more…”
It was early Saturday evening, and the three of them had been sitting in the living room for the last few hours, just talking. Bucky was sitting cross legged on the floor, his back resting on the coffee table, and Tony was lying on the couch with his head in Steve’s lap. The TV was still on in the background, but they’d long since stopped paying attention to it, instead drifting easily into Tony’s questions about Steve’s childhood…
There was an instant and undeniable pang of… well, panic. There wasn’t really another word for it. The idea that maybe Bucky
Steve, standing just a few feet behind him. And Tony knew there was no point in delaying this moment. If the ground really
Tony almost laughed, looking at the blinding sparkles that they were throwing in all directions. But, before he could say anything, he was stopped by an urgent grip on his arm, and the sound of Bucky hissing,
“Did the Nazis win?” He interrupted her, speaking more forcefully now. Nat blinked, and shot Nick a concerned glance, before he answered him.
“Er, well, I don’t have a… problem, with either of those things…” Bucky began, a little hesitantly. And Steve felt his stomach knot as he translated the true meaning of those words…
He recognised it immediately, rather than ‘thought it’, per se. Just the overall effect of being warm, and snug and surrounded by softness. The general feeling of being rested, and satisfied, and safe. The vague awareness that this was unusual – but only insofar as it made it seem all the nicer.
his senses sharpen, the familiar smell of Tony suddenly crashing over him as a wave, his mouth watering with the taste of Tony’s skin…
He took the chance, while Steve was sitting up, to push his shirt back over his shoulders, caressing his palms over every inch of Steve’s arms as he went-
Tony blinked at it twice, sure that whatever he thought he was looking at was about to turn back into something mundane...
I am most irritated to say that - just for once - I actually had this update ready at a reasonable time... And then my google drive glitched out on me, I presume out of spite. So I have now stayed up until 6am, purely to spite it back... Which is, I'm sure, a totally rational response 🙈
And, weirdly enough, it was the advice he was given as a very small child that came floating back to him
It wasn’t awful in the way it usually was, when he tried to do this. It wasn’t a chaos of words and a panic of conflicting ideologies and a general, bodily anxiety that it was
Steve kept having to stop himself in the middle of wistful daydreams to remind himself that they weren’t wistful anymore. He had to pause and check his own logic, whenever an imagined potential future seemed too good to be true. He was still having to convince himself that his own memories were real-
That he’d set an impossible standard of certainty. That he’d set out to find an answer to everything, even though human beings still didn’t understand themselves or the world they were from – and still they accepted that they were supposed to be human.
“Such slander,” Tony breezed, continuing his little game with himself. And then he somehow swerved around Steve in a single step, putting himself between them before he looked back and said, “you can probably sue him for suggesting that, you know.”
Until, abruptly, they were standing at the end of Tony’s bed – and Tony’s hands were all over him again.
“…What?” Tony asked eventually. But, as the word left his mouth, he suddenly remembered “Oh! The mission! Oh my God, we’re still on a mission… I’d literally forgotten all about that” And – still somewhat reluctantly – he climbed out of Steve’s lap to go and find his file reader. “That is a very good point, we should absolutely stop the people who are enslaving an alien race…” He muttered to himself, watching the screen load, feeling ever so slightly guilty that he’d been so
And there were so many people. Beyond the realm of Tony’s estimation, completely outside the dimensions through which he measured things. Hundreds of thousands. Half a million, maybe. Streaming into the hall through archways on all sides, spreading out onto the floor and up into the stands and out past the reach of Tony’s vision…
are awful, all over the universe...” He shrugged – and Steve breathed out a little laugh, and nodded.
run his hands through Tony’s hair again, and feel Tony’s hands pressed hard and desperate against his back, and feel Tony’s lips pressed to his neck-
“I find it hard to believe that someone who can make an armoured sweatshirt can’t make a pasta sauce,” Steve commented, sceptically.
And then his eyes drifted over to Tony, who was effortlessly charming an elderly couple at the bar, and a little voice reminded him,
true that Tony should be able to understand how a good man can get into that situation, that he should’ve known better than to turn Steve into a spiteful arrogant ideologue before he’d even talked to him…
“Keeping in mind, the alternative is staying enslaved by a group of people who might well be able to kill your entire species with the flick of a switch.” Tony talked over her, in the same level tone.
The initial awkwardness had faded in as short a time as it took Tony to become fully engrossed in his work. And then there had been those few hours, gone far too quickly, in which Steve had been able to just sit and watch him work… Like he used to, before. And yes, it was searingly painful, and there were moments when Steve really feared he might tear up, or that Tony might glance up and see exactly how bittersweet this moment was for Steve… But it was also wonderful. And Steve just wished so much-
“I just know this is going to be important, is all,” he muttered, weakly. Bucky pursed his lips sceptically, and Steve’s blush deepened, because, yeah – they both knew
“If I could take myself out of it, if I’d never met you and was watching a film of you, from a distance… You would just be this kind, patient, brave, annoying stubborn man – who just has a problem with this Tony Stark guy. Hey, doesn’t everyone? Someone who likes all but the most unlikeable, is patient with all but the most infuriating… someone who just doesn’t trust Tony not to fuck it up – which is how everyone feels, by the way.” And Tony looked away, his shoulders suddenly heavy, his voice more tired, more resigned when he carried on “It’s not a flaw of
Because Tony was selfish - said the man who’d held onto a treatment for palladium poisoning, or at least a potential relief from the incredible pain of it, just to see how Tony would react without it.
was very much still in battle mode. His body thrummed with adrenaline, his heart still pounding steadily against his ribs, his mind still too laser-focused on the task at hand to notice any of it-
Instead, he carried on through to the bedroom - appreciating the little details of his surroundings as he went.
It was harder to stop himself, when he couldn’t assure himself that he was making it up or misinterpreting it or that there was simply no way to deal with it…
And then the edge of Steve’s canine teeth traced over a specific spot - that Tony could’ve sworn had never been a scaldingly sensitive spot before today - but now, it was like every nerve in his body had been set alight, from that one teasing touch.
He never considered that he might find a partner who really loved him, for everything that he was - that he would ever really trust that. Tony had never imagined a relationship where there was literally no pressure on him to hide, or to change.
But before Tony could finish working out the importance of it, Steve very bravely explained it for him,
Oh… oh that still felt unnatural. And wrong. Just hearing those words in his head made Steve feel weak and pathetic and small. Instinctively, that
“You may be pleased to hear that I believe I’ve found a current owner of the Etienne Rossinhol Diary,” JARVIS announced cheerfully. “A copy was purchased through a private sale in 1992, from an unidentified buyer, by a Dr Mondésir. Records indicate that it may still be here in New York.”
“So, he just knocked on your door, uninvited, and demanded to know where I was, and that was all he told you?” Steve clarified. Tony recognised the ominous,
They knew they had two messy, imperfect solutions on the table here – but there were just the two, and they knew exactly what each of them meant and they knew the time had come to pick one.
And then Tony was just standing there in the living room, listening to the dull thrum of the water on the other side of that door… and this odd sort of… feeling of
It irritated him that Steve kept catching him off guard, that he simply refused to behave like literally everyone else in Tony’s life so far-
He glanced longingly at the bedroom door. He thought back to Tony, sleeping peacefully in his bed, looking like a sketch from a gothic fairy tale. He remembered the two of them lying on the floor of a soft room… how he’d pulled one of the silk sheets down from the benches and wrapped Tony in it, and held him like that, close to his chest…
“Nothing.” Maribelle answered, quickly and decisively. “I’ve never even met him; no one has. I don’t think he’s ever been down from the fourth floor.”
“Yeah?” Bucky cocked an eyebrow. “Cos you’re doing a really good impression of someone who’s not okay…”
“...Honestly, I think maybe I want to do that for me,” Steve realised out loud - briefly so engrossed in the thought that he missed the way Tony’s face lit up when he said it. “I don’t think I knew that, before last night. I think, if you’d have said this before last night, I would’ve said
, he’d have to worry that any one of those things would complicate everything. Now, doing any one of those things might look like he wasn’t following the rules - like he was trying to turn the relationship into something else, something he’d promised Tony it didn’t have to be.
mention Bucky. A life when he could never see Bucky again. He couldn’t choose between the two of them – and he certainly couldn’t choose Tony if it meant pretending that he thought Bucky had deserved to get shot in that bunker. It just wasn’t practically possible. It was

Which didn’t give Bucky pause. He simply dug the fingertips of his enhanced arm into the metal, and yanked the door free of its hinges.
He heard the sharp intake of breath from Bucky. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the way Bucky had curled inwards, dropping his head and crossing his arms tight, in a desperate bid to hold it together.
And, with a cooling feeling of disappointment, Tony noted that he was never likely to be very good with love. To have completely freaked out at the suggestion that he might have to care about someone, that
And then there was the tiniest little flicker of excitement, or joy, in his eyes. Like he’d briefly thought of something nice.
And then he caught sight of Tony, sitting in the office at the end of the corridor, idly scrolling through his phone...
Tony let go of a relieved sigh – but he barely got through it before the irritation began to tighten in his ribs again. A little knot of tension gathered between his eyebrows, pulling his face into a petulant sneer… It seemed very
Steve gave up on any pretence that he was going to stop thinking about it, as he turned off the office light, and locked the door behind him. He was somewhat reassured by the thought that it might not be anything about Tony Stark, per se. That maybe it was simply because Stark was attractive, and Steve was currently in a place where
- Tony managed to pull himself back from the edge, holding still for a moment while he levelled his breathing, his fingertips digging hard into Steve’s hips…
As coherent and cognisant as any thought that had ever come into his head – a hell of a lot more sensible than half the bullshit he’d been thinking for years, he realised now.
Another open plan space, with several office desks that had clearly been abandoned at speed. There were jackets left hanging over the backs of chairs, and still steaming coffee cups sitting next to quietly humming computer monitors. There was another set of doors on the left hand wall that they would have to keep an eye on, as well as the double doors they’d just come through… and there was the possibility that there were people coming down those stairs to meet them… So, basically, they were vulnerable from all sides, then.
It wasn’t the sort of place he usually liked; usually, Bucky felt uncomfortable in fancy places like this. Not that he’d been to many… But on those rare occasions, he’d spent the entire time feeling anxious that he was about to spill something, and vaguely irritated by the pretension of it all, and generally wishing he could be anywhere else.
“Oh, fuck, Tony, baby, God,” Steve whimpered, still struggling to grind up against him – simply unable to, now that his body had fallen weak around him.
” Steve hissed, jerking into him like it might’ve been involuntary. But then he just gave into it, thrusting his hips again, and again, quickly falling into a deep, brutal rhythm.
An uncomfortable sensation curdled in his stomach. He asked himself if he was dreaming - entirely hypothetically, of course, because no one ever
“No,” Steve sighed, automatically. And then he thought about what Bucky meant, and he corrected himself sharply. “No, wait – yes. Yes, I am.”
… So, there’s this thing that I struggle to do…and, maybe, I struggle with that because of things I’ve been through, and things that have happened to me… but, ultimately, if I don’t work on that, it’s going to keep on hurting me – and it’s going to hurt you too, if I don’t
Tony couldn’t explain any of that. However far he’d come since last week, however much he trusted Steve, he couldn’t go
The tender warmth of Tony’s lips against his neck, which he only understood as a safe, happy feeling…
And, for the first time in days, Tony found himself putting together a legitimate train of thought – one he actually felt in control of.
He didn’t look up again until he felt Steve settle into an awkward pause somewhere behind him – and then for a moment, he could only stare at him.
anything especially irritating or pretentious about that, that it was too soon to accuse Stark of posturing – that there was no rational basis for
true, I just know it isn’t, so that makes me wonder why he’s bothering to say it. What he could possibly be up to, that would have him scrape far down enough in the barrel to try being nice to me…” And the incredulous frown melted into an embarrassed sigh, “And then I remembered that Coulson had already asked me about you, and I got it into my head that he must be trying to use me to get to you - and then I might have panicked, a little bit…” he winced.
“Tony?” He pressed, swallowing down a bitter taste. And then, at last, Tony glanced up at him… and there was just something about his face. A slight shadow under his eyes, a softness in his skin… something…
That Steve hadn’t known how to tell him or what to tell him, that he’d wanted to tell him but didn’t think he was allowed to, that he’d been scared and burdened all this time…
Sure enough, the warmth vanished from Tony’s expression, leaving that touchy uncertainty in its place-
Tony set his teeth and swallowed hard – more out of habit than anything. His body braced for the onslaught of revulsion and shame, already gearing himself up to push through it-
He watched a wave of relief roll over Tony’s features, his shoulders melting under the force of it. It pushed against a tender spot, very deep in Steve’s chest. Automatically, his hands reached out for Tony, his body shuffling closer as he carried on,
This time it started slowly, just another ripple of chuckling, just because Tony was giggling… Until Steve found himself softening into the rhythm of it…
that you’re getting better. That you’re opening up, even though you find it hard. That you’re dealing with not being in control of everything, even though you hate that. That you’re doing your best to sort through all the impossible things you’ve learned - even if you aren’t quite there yet. Looking at your life and deciding to change all of that is a big thing, Steve. You’re still doing that right even if you don’t do it right away.”
,” he assured, looking back over his shoulder at him. “Because I was defensive, and challenging… and not very understanding, all in all. And I wish I had been. And I’m sorry.”
By the time they got into the bathroom, Tony was itchingly uncomfortable in his sweaty, sticky clothing, and increasingly aware of how sore he was – and how tired. His muscles seemed to get denser as he undressed, and by the time he got to stepping into the shower, he was glad he had Steve to lean on….
The strength of him, the power in those arms – exactly enough to push back against Steve, to challenge him-
“So, in no particular order, the tasks we have before us,” he announced, bringing up a holographic display of a neat, bullet pointed list. “Write the computer virus. Which, okay, I’m guessing is mainly on me - and shouldn’t be too much of a problem, even if there are a lot of very specific specifics to work in… But anyway, there’s that. We also have to figure out
From there, so many forbidden ideas simply burst free, rushing through the tiny chink in his denial while they had the chance-
But not quite the sudden take back of before. It wasn’t the same discomfort. It was something pleasant and… hopeful, even.
“Are you still mad at me?” Bucky asked, casually, as they waited for the gentle click of JARVIS unlocking the entrance.
, this whole thing. He’d just have to cut himself off from it, or cut it out of himself, or… whatever he had to do, to get this job done.
As his mindless little tour of their quarters came full circle, his eyes fell on the bar in the corner of the living room – the tall, crystal cabinet, displaying hundreds of amber bottles…and little vials of pills.
But he didn’t give moving much thought just yet, because he was simply too happy where he was. He just let his head rest on Steve’s shoulder, and pressed gentle kisses to his chest, and traced mindless patterns over his skin… And Steve sighed, and ran strands of Tony’s hair over his fingers, and caressed his hand over Tony’s back-
But Steve dropped his head instead, nuzzling determinedly at Tony’s neck until Tony tilted his chin up - so that he could suck a long, slow kiss to the column of his throat.
...And Sam just carried on looking at the two of them like they were mad, which made the whole thing seem funnier still-

pretty little noises for me” Tony growled, pushing into him again, this time gripping Steve’s waist with his free hand, so that he could pull Steve into him.
Tony was quite proud of how naturally he was able to welcome them this time. How well he managed to ignore the fact that Steve’s hair was wet…
As Rhodey was speaking, Tony was gathering the few bits of tech that hadn’t gone with them on the mission – another file reader, a few custom made USB pens, the mini blow-torch he’d used in his make-shift drug lab. He’d already decided that the rest of his things could just stay here. A few non-descript shirts and a couple of items of soft luggage were really not worth the cognitive effort.
It was a light, sweet gesture, more lips than teeth - but Tony shivered under the force of it anyway, rolling his head away from Steve in an attempt to offer more of himself. Steve's blood flashed hotter. He
“Not really,” Bucky answered, with a confident shake of his head. And then, when Tony paused, baffled, he clarified, “it’s not even about that.”
New Eden.” Dev announced it almost proudly, he was so delighted in telling this part of the story. “An effect that we had assumed was as side effect of substances that people were taking, which is in fact just something in the air and the water.”
Tony smiled at that thought, now. Just at the general idea of it… being stronger and healthier now… How much better he could look after Steve, if he healed fast and didn’t tire easily…
Even after four days of constant, focused thinking, Steve still felt like he had so much to go through. So much of his life to reconsider, so many details to analyse, so many questions to ask himself. And he’d felt like that before, of course. Actually, Steve had felt like that for most of his adult life…
Steve still didn’t allow himself to think about that. He’d come too far to tempt fate by celebrating early. He didn’t even let himself acknowledge that it was probably the
Steve could feel his strength rushing back to him, his excitement building along with it, riding the wave of it…
All of which had seemed very sensible back when he started, four hours ago. Steve had really believed he was simply doing some necessary preparation, being as organised as he would usually be – that he wasn’t thinking anything more about it than that. Until he started running out of things to do. Then, slowly, he began to recognise that maybe this whole thing had been driven by more than a sense of duty… That maybe he was just a little bit anxious.
to Steve - a need to keep Steve safe, and make him happy, beyond anything he’d ever thought of as love. And it was real, and it was important-
Now he’d remembered his prickling sense of injustice over the way SHIELD had treated him the last time; now he had to commit some mental energy to

differently, his vision so focused and detailed that it made the world look entirely unfamiliar – like seeing through the eyes of a wild animal.
He wasn’t sure where to put this rush of surprised excitement - whether this was a poorly timed but entirely ordinary response to hearing his crush say that, or a swell of guilty relief to hear that a friend understood this feeling, or yet another
“So, I’m also here for you when it’s different,” Bucky smiled, casually. “I’m pretty sure that’s what ‘always’ means, anyway.”
There was a moment of heady, breathless silence, as time just floated around them both, separate from them.
And Steve just looked so openly overwhelmed… Tony was worried that if he stared at him any longer, he’d catch it, and then they’d just get stuck in a perpetual loop of amazement.
All of which had dissolved into a wordless, emotional mush by about Wednesday… and had now sharpened again, into something more basic and primal-
of him sometimes… like it was always buried in him somewhere. That distance. That loneliness. The fact that he would’ve liked
Even without the comfort and security of his prior mood… He could feel that there was no malice in this. The way they were moving, the tone of their voices… The happy atmosphere they exuded. Without knowing what the hell it was, Steve already knew it was something…
One of the men on the couches nearest to them suddenly let out a high, pleading moan, and began babbling –
He remembered how many times he’d reimagined this moment, how many little things he’d wanted to change. How often he’d wished that he could’ve started out differently. How many personal traits and expectations he’d felt locked into, once people expected them of him, once people started treating him like that…
There was an ear-splitting crash as Bucky tore free of his restraints with enough force to break the chair to pieces around him. Steve heard the wet crack of Bucky hitting Stape, and then the dull thud of Stape hitting the floor like a sandbag.
have such faith that Steve would keep him safe, and he was so proud of Steve, and so happy to be with him, and he wanted Steve to know all of that…
for the first time in twenty years. What should’ve been the unavoidable, natural reactions to this situation were of no use to Steve, and therefore just weren’t there.
And, surely, if Tony could find a way to explain that to Steve, if he could figure out what this was

“Differently to one another, for a start.” He suggested, lightly. “It seems unlikely that the one fantasy of

would stop him liking this? Surely, no one could still feel good remembering something, when they knew it really meant that-
weird, and it really doesn’t feel like just, a trauma reaction, or whatever… But I guess I wouldn’t know,” he mused. “But I do know that, whatever the reason, I did just snap last night - and I know I can’t just do that, and I’m sorry for it, and I know I have to figure all that out… But, for what it’s worth, none of that is on you…” He saw Tony look up at him, a questioning expression on his brow - and Steve cringed in acknowledgement. “And I know I said it was all just a reaction to you… And, actually, I don’t even know if that’s true, really...”
“Yeah, sorry, things are a bit of a mess,” he blushed - and Steve was very tempted to simply kiss him again, he was so very pretty… But he had also remembered that he
And Steve knew he should look up at whatever had snagged Tony’s attention - but he just couldn’t look away. Tony was
Those hot, deep waves that rolled through him, as Tony stroked the flat of his tongue over him again.
Bucky, per se. Steve knew he didn’t really have any right to tell Bucky who he could talk to, or what he could say. He even knew he’d been a bit over the top when Bucky first told him – but of course, he wasn’t going to admit that. He was still too uncomfortable about the whole damn thing.
“He said he saw someone come out from behind one of the bars, but he didn’t think you worked here…?” Tony prompted. Zan screwed her face up, obviously unimpressed.
Tony couldn’t help thinking that things might’ve been different, if he’d known it was Captain America
. It was only when he heard Tony’s surprised giggle that he realised how overwhelmed he sounded - and that he should probably try to elaborate, at least a little bit. “I… I know this isn’t going to be like any other relationship. And I’m not expecting you to feel the same way about me in a few weeks as I felt about you after ten years - and I know that sounds crazy… But, since you
to ask questions – to never once make Tony question himself or feel self-conscious about doing this.
“So - whatever is or isn’t going to happen with Loki, and Ultron, and Thanos, and any other alien or impossible threats that’ve slipped my mind - none of that is going to happen for a few months, at least?”
This was bigger than any of the rooms downstairs, with several bars and lounge areas around a huge black marble dancefloor. There was a balcony that ran around the whole of the room, a few people leaning over it, watching the couples below. The balustrade was adorned with shimmering golden chains and tiny black gems… The theme of the party was nominally ‘Black and Gold’, which was probably why Tony was wearing a black shirt-
Believing that something mattered was enough to convince him that one day things would matter again.
Steve’s mouth fell open, as all the colour slowly drained from his face. His chest hitched, and froze, his body curling in on itself like it was falling into a void.
He took a deep breath, and flinched his hands away, and told himself to calm down. He pointedly refused to indulge any thoughts about why he wasn’t up to this, or why he shouldn’t feel this way. Instead, he forcibly reminded himself,
“What’s wrong? Why weren’t you here, why are you dressed?” Steve blurted – much to his own surprise. It all just came out in a rush, with no possible place for him to intercept it… And then he saw Tony hesitate slightly, halfway through pushing himself up off of his chair. The way his face flashed in such a relatable, everyday expression of alarm, very briefly-
“Okay, so I have one more question…” he said, carefully. “And it’s just really important to me that you tell the truth. That’s… really more important than whatever the answer turns out to be, okay?”
“What if it turns out that Zan’s Dad was doing research to end a horrible plague” Tony carried on in the same philosophical tone. “And it
There was a flash of concern behind Steve’s eyes, but he followed Tony over to the couch before he asked,
Begrudgingly, Steve turned and picked up the offending scrap of paper - not actually expecting to find any further details. He was already thinking ahead, wondering how he was going to explain what a Mortal Blessing was when he didn’t really know himself-
“You, uh, you know about the Howling Commandos, right? You know who Bucky Barnes... was?” Steve began, over a growing lump in his throat.
for centuries, for what were perfectly normal, healthy thoughts. Women throughout history were made to feel guilty or dirty for instincts that there was never anything wrong with. None of those people would’ve been wrong, to accept the authority of their own feelings and desires – to accept their own nature regardless of what anyone thought of it-
And then, without warning, Tony just broke. His climax seemed to surge from every part of his body, every muscle tightening and then shivering with release as he came hard across the front of Steve’s uniform.
I’d managed the self-control you just did, and tried to use my words instead – I’d have probably said some pretty unreasonable things about your best friend. I
Steve felt the blood rush to his face. He glanced down shyly, gesturing subtly with the case as he spoke.

still have to talk about. All the other arguments and grievances and miscommunications – things Tony hadn’t even thought to reconsider yet.
When the occasional flash occurred to him, like a sudden stab wound to his soul, he always flinched away from it. Thought his way around it, acknowledged it without actually thinking about it, shut his brain down completely – whatever it took to avoid going back there. Just knowing it was in his head somewhere was enough to coat Tony’s tongue with a bitter taste.
He did have to stop himself, and think more clearly, before he just blurted out Steve’s deepest secret like that.

“Well, as far as I know, no one has actually attempted to reproduce it yet” Tony smiled, knowingly. “And, I dunno, that

, for hard facts. Everything else was supposition and guess work. The few clues they did have were both vague and unnerving.
“You are everything that is wonderful about human beings, all the joy, and hope, and potential…” Tony enjoyed letting his mouth run away with him, realising as he went how much he

But now that he was committed to a difficult conversation, Tony was perversely keen to get on with it. He had already made it across the hallway and called the elevator before JARVIS had chance to get to the next sentence,

He dismissed Vormir and New York before he’d even considered them. Too complicated. Too many thoughts that he wasn’t ready to process. Too many questions about what he’d even
accept Tony’s kind explanation, and resolve to be a grown up about it, and distance himself from this –

Not for being pig headed, and too stubborn to listen, and too arrogant to see… Not for a lot of the things I decided you were, that I was mad over. And, in amongst
And then they finally reached the double doors at the end of the hallway. Galileo threw them open wide with a single dramatic push to reveal the dining room - and
But Tony could imagine what it would look like if he did. That was all that mattered in this moment – not how likely it was, not now many problems it would cause, not analysing the reasons Steve might have for liking it.
