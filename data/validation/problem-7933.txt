Tony raises his head off Steve's chest, looking into his eyes. "I want to be very clear that I would never. Ever."
He raises a brow at her as she kicks the hat into gear. "Who knew? Racism."
"Ew. Hi Mr. Rogers," Peter says, with a little wave.
He was glad that that serum gave him a higher pain tolerance than most, because Jesus, this had to hurt like shit. "I got you," he says gently, more so to himself than anything else, because he was almost positive Steve couldn't hear him over the wind.
And boy, it really was snowing. At his best guess, he would say it was almost 8, and there was probably a foot and a half of snow. "Jarvis, it's looking like I can't hear you right now, so um..." He needed a way to get something close to answers. "Ok, I need to know how much power I've got. So light up my right boot for higher, and left for lower. 70%?" Left. "60%?" Left. He really wasn't liking this. "50%?" Left. "30%?" Right. Thank god. "40%?" Right. "45%?" Neither light up. Ok, presumably that meant he had hit the dot. He could work with that. "Ok." He looks around at the long crater the ship had created when it had fell, a couple inches of snow already covering the freshly upturned dirt. The track probably extended a 100 feet. Presumably, Steve was that way.
"I'm not so fragile that I can't stay here."
"You're invited to my wedding," Bucky says. "Pretty sure it's an empty gesture because Steve would bring you along anyway, but you're invited."
Bucky laughs. "Alright, come on Stark."
"I care."
She clicks her pen. "It's really more how can I help you." Tony raises a brow. "The two of you have been seen all around town today, and already the Internet is latching onto that. Would you like to get ahead of it and make an official statement."
Italian is great Tony.
"Don't worry, it's lemon poppyseed." he stands up. "Rhodey, would you like me to take that?"
Love you too Tony.
Steve doesn't respond for a long time, choked off sobs the only sound that come from his throat. The red skull watches on, the same satisfied smile on his face as he walks forward. "I have a solution to your dilemma," he says, his voice sickly in a way that makes Tony's blood coil.
"Promise." Then Steve pulls Tony and himself out of place and towards the front table, close enough to hear, but only for a moment before Sam meets his eyes.
So Steve had to leave.
They pull off the information trade without a hitch. Most of it was outdated or unimportant, but Howard has given them the name of a project—the lighthouse—due to start construction next year. Steve had also thrown in some tidbits of information the weren't particularly helpful to HYDRA, but were helpful to them. Like the idea that Anton Vanko would be working with Howard on a big project from abroad. If they could convince HYDRA to take him out, that was one less problem to be worried about in the future. Steve had seen the footage of Tony fighting his son, Ivan. The fewer threats out there, the better Steve felt about what they were manipulating. Already, there was no telling how much they had changed. There was no threat to the timelines, but the effects of their actions could ripple out to every corner of history.
But speaking of Pepper and Rhodey, Tony shifts carefully to get his phone out of his pocket without waking up Peter. He opens the group chat with them and types out a quick message.
Once night falls, they take the party up to the roof, where Tony has all his pool chairs and some blankets  brought up and positioned to face the impending fireworks display. Steve and Tony share a picnic blanket with Tony nestled perfectly into Steve's side. "Thank you for all this, Tony." Steve says gently, right as the first firework shoots up into the sky.
"Good afternoon boss, it's good to see you back in the game."
"You guys are fun. We can do a double date sometime." Steve pulls around his hand, slightly impatiently. "Until then," he winks and allows himself to be pulled off, away from the newly engaged couple, a wide smile on his face.
"I'm sorry boss, my directions were clear to save you and bring you back safely."
"Let's go," she says, her voice shaky.
"Yes, I'm afraid we've been out of contact for quite a while, working closely with Howard Stark. He doesn't appreciate fraternizing with the enemy."
"Alright, thank you," Steve says, the door already closing on them.
"Yeah, but you still didn't do shit, pretty boy," Peggy says, grinning at him.
"Please, Steve, were not strangers here." She slips her arm through his, leading him towards the doors.
"That's nice, thank you. Would you like to come in?" Steve takes a step back, holding the door open. Tony smiles and steps into the living room, looking out the large windows.
Instead of going home, he walks to Central Park, where there was a refuge of wildlife among the bustling city. He sits on a rock and begins sketching with a pen from his back pocket. Not ideal, but useable. In the distance Steve could see what he now recognized as Stark Tower, where Tony surely was. Where Steve had been only this morning, waking up with limbs tangled in his for the first time in forever. He had felt bliss this morning in the warm light of a soft morning sun. Tony had sprawled out on top of Steve, which had made it difficult for him to leave on time for his shift. Luckily for him, he hadn't needed an alarm to awaken well rested and happy. He had scrawled his number on a ripped out page from his sketchbook and paused to savor the sight of his still sleeping partner in the doorframe before he ran out to meet up with Sam at the bakery.
"I've never really held a baby, but if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to," Steve cuts in, feeling a bit like an absolutely insane teenage girl.
"You're not dead." Tony says with aN award winning wink, "How did none of you see the press conference?"
Tony is changing when Pepper and Rhodey come in through the elevator, Rhodey holding a small box with a bow on it. "Hey, guys, it's good to see you again," Steve says with a small smile.
She shifts. "He loved you too you know. In a different way, but he did." And that.. that he couldn't mess up. That would be starting now.
kids sleeping on my chest
He chuckles, bumping his shoulder. "We're from the future pal."
Do you need us to come over?
Every ounce of anger slips away from him when he watches Tony step out of the car, parked in front of Avengers tower. Then Tony turns and helps Bucky out of the car, and Steve's heart stops. Bucky looks up at Steve, then back to Tony as if seeking comfort. Tony had been in Alaska for two weeks with Bucky, apparently... becoming friends. Or at least something close to it. Tony looks up at Steve, his eyes softening. Tony says something to Bucky, and they start walking, drawing closer to where Steve, Clint, Nat, and Sam were standing with every step. Tony slings his arm around Bucky's shoulder, and Bucky looks up at him, cheeks flushing just a bit. "Alright, Buckaroo," Tony says, finally close enough to hear. "That's Nat, that's Clint, and that's Sam. They don't bite. I mean, Clint might." Clint scoffs.
His phone buzzes again
Steve answers instantly, in the way that makes it easy for Tony to tell exactly how desperately Steve has been counting. "Six months since I woke up. Seven since the battle. I missed you."
"Peter." Tony says, once only him and Bruce are left standing in the tower, both Bruce and Peter heading for the elevator. Peter turns around and Bruce obviously hesitates before continuing on into the elevator.
Howard grins. "Invented by my son, of course. Takes after his father."
"Good." He grabs a napkin, scrawling a number on it with a pen he produces from a pocket. "That's his number, he'll be in contact." He quickly finishes the rest of his coffee, before sliding out of the booth. "Nice meeting you."
Adam raises a brow at them, an almost smile on his face. "I can organize a showing just for you and your fiancée." And that's how you get bank, hook line and sinker.
A heavy beat of silence hangs between them, a battle of wills if you may. Peter wins when Tony takes the pop tart, collapsing in the nearest barstool with a sigh. "That guy. The one at the bakery I told you about." Peter nods, unwrapping his own pop tart. "Well, things got a little out of hand and... ah. I kissed him."
"Don't you care! He killed them Steve. Here maybe you need to watch the video again. He killed them! He choked my mom to death!" He grabs the tablet, brandishing it, before dropping it again.
The kiss tastes like strawberries and vanilla, the dim lights shining down on them making Steve feel dizzy. Or maybe it was the man in front of him and the hand on his cheek that made him feel dizzy. Why had he ever tried to fight this? What had he thought to gain from denying himself perfection.
Step 1, get his arm free of the seatbelt, and the incredibly damaged armor. Step 2, fix it. Step 3, find Steve. Not hard. None of that was hard. Yeah. He had it under control.
"I'm always calm. Also that was simply a reason to come see you quickly."
Buck told me what happened
Dusty rocks crunch under his feet as he walks steadily closer to the top. The nature of her sacrifice could never be recognized by the general population, neither could Tony's. Nobody could ever know that the problem of time travel had been solved. Governments would be vying for the power the second it was announced, and with Tony gone, there was nobody to do damage control and legal work. Nobody who didn't work directly for a government organization. According to public knowledge, Nat and Tony died in the final battle, a heroes death, but not a selfless sacrifice. Not as it was.
She raises an eyebrow. "I don't know. This is new territory for everyone. You're time travel long with the mind stone, there's no protocol for this sort of thing. She rubs her elbow slowly. "I know you saved me, which is nice, but if that's all, I need to find something to kill me before the battle is over."
we're going to an Italian restaurant
"Bye," Steve says, feeling the simple goodbyes like a punch to the gut. He was so screwed. Head over heels for an engaged man. A man who was most certainly out of his league and probably straight and definitely not interested in a baker. The click of the phone is another punch in the face. He deserved every ounce of pain for crushing on Tony. Beautiful, perfect, torturous Tony.
"It is Peter, sir. Would you like me to turn on the lights?"
"Yeah, yeah you do." Peggy says, rubbing the mascara from beneath her eyes.
"I have an alert set up if they find you."
Steve and Natasha lock eyes. She shrugs. "Maybe," Steve says. "We could come around for dinner once."
"Don't go too far," Steve says, squeezing his hand before grabbing the phone out of his pocket. He turns away as he presses it to his ear. "Hello?"
Tony drops his head back down onto Steve's chest. "That asshole is too charming for his own good. The hair doesn't help."
He points an accusing finger at her. "You're a brat. Victor, I'll warn you, she's a brat."
"You shall," Thor agrees, sending a volt of electricity zipping through the body of the final prisoner. Steve sees his gaze lingering on Loki before he turns away, but the younger asguardian is staring at Steve still. "Let's go." Upon reaching the surface, they find a barrage from alien ships and Steve adjusts his shield. Here was the true attack. The one in which Frigga died.
Tony had been pansexual and loud about it, but he had never been the mythological figurehead of the country. Maybe once Steve returns to his time he can finally come out. To honor Tony's memory.
afraid not cupcake. only one is royalty but both are a royal pain in the ass
It's three months before the phone rings. By then, Steve was just about ready to give in and bite the eight year bullet. Tony was crawling, and he had decided that the sight of Steve was no longer offensive, so they were getting along well enough. Howard went back to work, and Nat was constantly training. Steve assumed it was just a stress thing; she had always trained a lot. Maybe it was more—he didn't want to ask.
Steve shakes his head no with an attempt at a serious look on his face. "Best part was that the cat had actually died that morning." Needless to say, Peggy hadn't exactly been happy with him. They had a good laugh about it now, but certainly not then.
"It's true. And by the way, he loves you. A lot. He's not like that." Tony pops the bagel in half and sticks it in the toaster, leaning tiredly against the counter. She was nice. The two of them were good together, and Tony wouldn't be opposed to attending their wedding one day.
Steve goes into work the following morning to find Sam already behind the counter. "Hey, Steve. How was your date."
"More than anything," Bruce affirms.
"Hear hear," Sam mutters.
Steve pulls away ever so slightly, his hand keeping an unbearably tight grip on Tony's wrist so he can't jump again. "What," he growls.
"I'm allergic to strawberries," she corrects, and Steve is very very glad he isn't on the receiving end of her fiery glare. Even James looks increasingly uncomfortable, being in the middle of the face off. He looks up at Steve and shrugs.
For a second, Tony thinks about shutting the offer down, plain and simple. He was supposed to be making Steve a cake for his birthday. However, on the other hand, he had no fucking idea what he was doing. "I'll take you up on that, but only after we get done in the lab today."
"You are not fine and you haven't practiced."
He scoops up an arm full of branches, very glad for his augmented super strength, as he lugs them down towards the wreck. He positions them leaning up against the top of the plane, and has to make several rounds back to the tree line before he's satisfied with his leaning wall. Then he lugs a pretty large pile of logs and sticks into the plane, setting them down in a pile near the controls. He directs his attention to Steve, who had somehow found a space blanket and was sitting in the pilots seat. "Cap?" Tony asks softly, but the other man is very firmly asleep. That was probably for the better. Steve could sleep off the pain, and hopefully any memories of that conversation. "Jarvis, you think we can start a fire," he mutters, almost to himself.
Steve jumps a little, startled out of his thoughts and even more startled to find the catalyst of them standing only a foot away from him. "Hi, how can—how can I um.. help you," Steve fumbles out, squeezing his cloth tightly like a stress ball. Water drips onto the floor.
Tony grins, finishing off his glass in one gulp. "He might be."
"Yeah." It was true. He would fight Tony in that cave again if it came down to it, but he would never have lied. He thought to the two letters tucked safely away with his suit and the Time travel devices. He hadn't planned on leaving this Tony a letter, and he certainly didn't plan on letting the Winter Soldier kill Howard and Maria, but one of those things he would be okay with doing. "You're a good friend, Natasha."
"And, what about you Adam?"
"So... you're.. companions." She says, with a raised brow. And there was another mask. Natasha pretending she's was interested at socializing with strangers and Peggy pretending she wasn't completely shell shocked with the new news.
"Pleasure. I was just telling Gideon how sad I was that he wouldn't be joining the cast of WWIII. I think he would be just perfect in the role of a young Howard Stark, don't you?" She says it so easily, like it isn't an absolutely crack head thing of her to say.
"And what do you think now," Steve teases, playing with the belt loops on Tony's dress pants.
"No no. Strange, do something." He looks away at Stephen, who opens his mouth in an empty motion. "Do something! We're the Avengers!" His hand grasps at Tony's shakily. Nobody says anything. The burns are too bad. Tony knows that. He knew he was going to die from the moment he set them in the gauntlet. "You're the Avengers..." Steve whispers, something in his eyes breaking. He takes in a shaky breath, and looks down at the ark reactor, and then further down to the stones.
"1.." the world blinks out of existence as they race through the time streams back to 2023.
"I'm from California. Now I work for... a man who may be interested in what you're doing for the government." He picks up a packet of Splenda, slowly tearing it open while his eyes flicker between the two of them. He dumps it into the cup of coffee, swirling it around a few times.
"Well Barton wasn't," Sam says, knocking Clint in the shoulder.
Bucky laughs, his shoulders loosening. "Gee, you love me?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tony, sweetheart, it's so good to see you again."
"Genius, but go on."
"Glad to be back."
Before he knows it, he's at the cottage, driving down the driveway he had been so scared of. Pepper sits on the porch, Morgan on her lap. She musters a weak smile for Steve, and he finds one for her too. "Hey Morgan!" He says, walking up the porch stairs.
"Which means we should probably go out again sometime before then." Steve says, following suit on his way to the kitchen.
"No!" Steve interrupts before the idiot train can get any further. "You're both mine, and that's final."
"I guess—"
"Tony," Steve admonishes, trying not to smile too much and disrupt his
"Steve, thank god. I need your help, like right now," Bucky says, sounding absolutely panicked out of his mind.
"Alright Tony," Tony! Tony, Tony, Tony! It was perfect. It fit him like a perfect rhyme, like warm coffee in the morning. "I'll see you on Friday." Already, Steve couldn't wait until Friday. He also felt the need to punch himself in the face.
"Rebecca." She falls silent, pursing her lips at him. "You need to go take a seat. The wedding is going to start soon." He opens the door for her, restraining himself from shoving her out the door.
"Sorry!" Pietro calls back, somehow sounding wide awake despite the early hour. "Making breakfast before I head in for my shift."
Clint was perhaps Steve's only friend who wasn't also his employee, because he had a job at the YMCA as an archery instructor. Even then, Clint hung out around the bakery a considerable amount, and sometimes he would pick up a shift that nobody else could. He wasn't allowed in the kitchen though, the one time Steve made that mistake he had gotten cookies about the constancy of a rock. Clint was deaf too, but he was the only one of Steve's friends who was married with a kid, so he had that going for him. Him and Nat had gone to high school together, which was how he joined the friend group. He helped out at the homeless shelter pretty often, because that's where he found his dog Lucky.
"I'm good Wanda, thanks. It's not that late though, is it?" He says, wishing he had thought to wear a watch.
"Who?"
Tony smiles, then kisses him. "I love you."
"God, no. The closest I've gotten to marriage was kissing." Steve's mind flickers to Sharon and Natasha, the feeling of their lips on his. Neither kiss had meant what it should've to him. With Sharon.. well, she was a great gal, but she kissed him. And they were on the run, so Steve had taken it as a token of good luck and moved on. Nat's kiss had also been on the run, but well, he hadn't not liked that one. It wasn't really a kiss though, not for her and not for him. She was just trying to keep their cover and he... well by that point he was fully aware of his little crush on Tony.
"To find a hotel. I need to stay somewhere," he says as if that's the most obvious thing in the world. Maybe it was, to him. He clearly wasn't exactly thinking straight at the moment.
"It's quite alright dear. I'd best be off. Natasha, Ivan," she gives them a nod, her eyes lingering on Steve's lips for a moment to long before she walks off into the crowd of rich people, her shiny black pumps clicking on the floor.
Peter's mouth falls open in a sort of happy shock. "You did what?"
Tony puts the car into drive and pulls out of the parking spot onto the busy New York roads. "Yeah, how'd you know?"
"No," Steve says almost frantically, leaning into Tony's hand. "You're all I'll ever need. All I want."
"I know sir, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry to ask you."
"See you soon."
Generally, he prided himself in not being a jealous person. He had been on the receiving end of unwarranted jealousy more times than he cared to tally up, but he knew Steves body language, and he knew that Steve was absolutely fine with the blatant advances the woman was making on him, even from all the way over here. It was doing things to his insides that hurt in a way he didn't particularly appreciate.
The man lets out a laugh. "I think Pepper would kill me if I got cupcakes. She's already a bit of a bridezilla, so the cake is the only thing I'm allowed to be in charge of, even though I'm paying for the whole ordeal." Even though Steve just got hit by a truck, the easygoing smile on the strangers face is almost enough to make Steve feel better.
He wraps it with the gauze, tightly, holding it stiff, before pulling the Hydra glove over his arm. Ok. That’s fine. His arm was warm, it was held stiffly in place, he was alive. Great. Now, he had to go find Steve. Before night falls, because Steve was.. well, Steve was Steve, but even he couldn't want to spend a night alone in the snow.
"Great. Lunch then."
Bucky hesitates, but seems to understand that he should drop it until after work. "Uh, ok.. this guy wants to know if you can make that cake he asked for by Sunday."
He can make a cake. It'll all be fine.
Tony is having a conversation. Or something of the like. Not that he knows what it's about, but it seems to be enough that he periodically nods and makes affirming statements, while the woman who must have told him her name droned on. Usually, he at least tries to pay attention when other people talk, if only as a curtesy. He wasn't that rude and conceited, contrary to popular public belief. When someone decided to talk to him about something, it was at the very least important to them. He knew all that, blah blah blah.
Tony swallows the rest of the come down, savoring the aftertaste that would stay for a couple minutes. "I love you too." They bask in a few minutes of glorious afterglow, both quite comfortable to sit together for a moment and recover. Tony plays absentmindedly with the buttons on Steve's shirt, his head rested on Steve's warm shoulder.
Peter obviously hesitates, his eyes flickering to Steve. "Ms. Leeds um.. said she didn't mind picking me up."
"Ba!"
She doesn't look at him, but he can tell that her eyes light up. Of the Avengers, she was his closest confidant by far. They had spent the past five years together, trying desperately to piece themselves and the whole world back together. It nearly killed him to loose her. He knew in his heart that if it had been him on Vormir, he would have sacrificed himself in a heartbeat. She had so much to live for, and it wasn't fair for her to die. "Thank you."
The elevator dings, and Tony gets to his feet as Bruce walks through the door, a bowl in hand. "Happy birthday Tony," he says, extending the bowl.
"When are you going?" Bucky asks, drawing both their attention.
"I'm not."
"Duh."
A white minivan pulls into the nearest scant spot and Bucky tenses up against Steve's chest. "Go get him. It's just us now, you got nothin to worry about," Steve says, rubbing Bucky's arm, then pushing him halfheartedly towards Sam who was stepping out of the car with an attempt at an unreadable expression on his face.
Steve rolls his eyes and fixes them on Tony. "It's Tony, please. Also how do you two know each other." He glances up at Steve, tightening his grip on Steve's hand.
Tony let's go of his hand. "Sounds great Steve," he says, turning away like that one word wasn't enough to send Steve's heart up into his throat. Steve turns away before he can further embarrass himself, heading back to the kitchen. He really couldn't be acting like this. That man was happily engaged and Steve was a looser with a crush. He had to get himself back under control.
Nat was sweet because she really did try, but Steve was pretty sure by now that it was a lost cause. He couldn't even speak to a customer.
"Four years of culinary school with the Art Institutes in Virginia," he answers readily, pulling out a bag of powdered sugar. "Then I moved up here. It's nice."
Except by the time they arrive, a plan appears to be no longer necessary. The drones are retreating into the sky and there's no screaming or crying. Just eerie silence.. the kind that comes after a disaster.
"Oh time travelers! Wonderful. What year are you from?" Thor says, making a brisk pace that Steve can feel Nat struggling to keep.
Instead of telling her like he should, Steve climbs under the covers, patting the spot next to him. She laughs and gets up to turn the lights off before easing into the spot next to him. They don't touch, never do, but they face each other, and maybe that's enough. He wants to reach out to her and pull her into his arms, let her fall asleep and use him as a pillow. He still knew better then to offer. Either she would, or she wouldn't, but she deserved the right to choose without being pushed in either direction. Because Steve loved Nat. He always did.
If you really need to protect yourself from it, I’ll have a summery at the end in the notes.
"Yeah, thanks Fri, can you get us to London?"
"We'll see," Steve says.
Steve leans into him, breathing against Tony's neck. "You're so pretty."
Steve chuckles. "Good to know the Bucky I knew is still in there."
Maybe it's just the fact that she died and came back to life today (or was that several years from now?), but the thought that that might be her having to adjust to the newness of whatever was going on under her skin does cross his mind. There was no telling what happened to her without extensive testing, and the only person he trusted to do that was dead. Or was he not born yet? Whatever. Time travel was confusing. "Goodnight Nat."
If you took everything that sometimes ticked him off about Tony and made it into a person, he's pretty fucking sure it would be Howard. "You can't take people's DNA."
Natasha turns, a flicker of shock registering in her eyes. "No, I don't believe I have," she says, taking the blondes outstretched hand in a graceful handshake.
Steve looks down at him from his new position over Tony (don't ask him when) with a cocky little grin. "Sounds like a plan to me baby." He rolls off of Tony, and walks swiftly into his bathroom, the only evidence that he wasn't really as cool as he was trying to keep it the sound of running water, following splashing into his face. Tony blinks up at the ceiling for a moment, before sitting up, stretching.
"Ok, that's enough of that," Tony interjects, pushing away from the table. "You two, behave," he says sternly, pointing between his friends.
He walks forward, positive he's never been more hopeful for anything in his life. "Steve!"
Tony let's out a bit of a too uneasy laugh. "Yeah I guess that's what I'm offering you." Bucky's face falls flat. "That's not something I would do for the general public, but I like you, and Steve trusts you, so I'm willing to run with it."
"No you couldn't," Bucky says, standing up and walking towards the kitchen. "I'll take care of it."
"So luck."
"You're welcome," they say, walking off in respect for Tony and Steve's privacy.
The recovery process was long, in the way that things always seem to be. Unfortunately, it seems the world can wait no longer when they receive news of a massive fire monster attacking the city of Prague, and Spider-Man being the only one fighting it, along with some guy Tony doesn't know, and doesn't like already. Nobody hangs out with his underoos. They hold a press conference in Wakanda on July 2nd, both Steve and Tony's matching arms and rings on full display as they reveal that neither heroes had died and that both were retiring.
Tony walks up to the couch, holding two bowls of reheated spaghetti. Steve takes it, watching as Tony plops down onto the couch next to him. "They're not wrong there. Very kind of me. I think I should get an award."
"You uh.. when you came in for the cake tasting—"
that being said, hello :)
"Hm?" Tony's eyes flutter shut, dark lashes over tan skin. He's beautiful. He's everything Steve ever wanted and more.
"My first guess was inter realm beings, but realistically, it's probably inter time beings or inter dimensional beings."
All mine baby." Tony waves one hand across the sky like he's displaying a banner.
"I couldn't think of anything else," Steve defends. "To be fair, it was nice cat litter and she always complained about hers."
"I was going to say make a video like you and Stevie did with the journal, but that doesn't sound half bad."
"I'll have to run it by Pepper, but I think that might be the winner," Tony says softly, his voice like velvet against Steve's ears. "Could you do a three layer with this and one double dark chocolate in the middle?"
And that, folks, is how Steve ended up standing in front of Peggy Carter on a Tuesday evening, tears streaming down her face, and her fiancé standing next to her, looking between Steve and Peggy. "So... what am I missing?" He says, flexing his grip on his cane.
"Us too," Nat says. Howard and Peggy show up shortly and Steve takes a moment to himself, imagining himself in Steve jrs position. He didn't quite have the life he wanted, but he could live here for the rest of his life. He was never going to fall in love with Tony, but he was going to be happy here.  With Howard and Peggy and Bucky, it was close enough. It was also close enough to 2012 that he would still be ready to face the Chitari when they came.
"I'm gonna faint."
Nat sits down on one of the rocks, leaning back. "He's an idiot."
Nat picks up the phone on the second try once Steve gets back to his apartment. "What do you want Steven," she snaps at him, clearly cross, despite it only being 3.
If only that allowance didn't feel like Steve was ready to die. But Tony needed to take it anyways, because he knew in his heart he wouldn't be able to get Steve back any way but flying. "Ok. Hey. We're gonna be ok." He leans into Tony's palm. "I need to carry you. We're going to have to fly." Unfortunately, with only one hand available, he wasn't going to be able to support Steve very well. Come what may, they would be fine.
"I'm assuming you're not watching the news? I can have the whole thing taken care of, but I suspect it will do little at this point." Tony bounds down the stairs towards the living room, blabbering on in a way that was familiar in Steve's complete loss at the topic.
"Before you even think about it," Tony points a finger at him? "I don't even have a cat." He lets go of Steve's arm so he can open the door.
"You're smaller," Nat observes.
Sunday comes too fast. Way too fast. He may as well have blinked, and then the cake was constructed and in boxes, sitting in Sam's car. Steve climbs into the front seat, looking at the invitation on the other seat and the borrowed tux on his body. He could just not. He could go home and watch Legally Blonde for the thousandth time.
"Everybody wants a happy ending, right?" Steve's gut clenches. He didn't try hard enough.
"Hi guys!" Tony says with a little wave, walking over and hugging Rhodey and Pepper tightly. "Pepper, you look amazing!"
"So I don't know. What do we think about it?"
"Everything's good. Come on Happy." Tony walks back towards the jet and up the ramp, to find the kids crowded around Peter and Steve, asking a plethora of questions. Good questions, really, given that they didn't know he was Spider-Man. Well, except for Ned. And apparently MJ. "Hey!" They all fall silent and look at him with a bit of fear. Yeah, he might be 54, but he's still got it. "Sit down kids. You may ask me questions once we get in the air, not them." The teenagers silently get into the surrounding chairs, and Steve goes back to patching Peter up. Tony sets a hand on Steve's shoulder in the quiet commotion. "You good?"
Either way, it would be stunning. Steve could picture a beach wedding. Although, really location didn't matter much because they had each other and that would be enough. That's just how love works, right?
"Yeah." The old pot had broken a few weeks ago, and Wanda was the only one of them who ever used the thing. Pietro didn't like the taste, and Steve usually preferred to sleep. Not today though. Today, he would settle for chemicals. "Want me to brew you a cup."
"It's ok cap. Come here." He leans in, their breaths mingling as Tony wraps his arm tightly around Steve's waist, pulling him closer, then up to where they're standing, more or less. "You're so good. Ok." At this point, he was just talking, saying anything he thought might get the super soldier to calm down. He didn't need Steve any more wound up than he was already. "We're gonna be fine." He kicks his boots into gear, sending them up into the sky. He retraces his path slowly, clutching to Steve's body as gentle as he can.
Another happy resolution, I get out of quarantine tomorrow, and I’m so happy :)

"What?" He was tired; so tired.
Then they do presents. Tony opens the one from Victor first. It reveals a coffee mug that proclaims "#1 rich sorta uncle"
"I'm—Tony, I'm doing what you said. Play nice? For the money?" Steve rubs the back of his neck, shooting a nervous smile at someone somewhere behind Tony.
"Yes," Steve agrees quickly, smiling just as wide. "Of course."
The first thing he does is hug her as tight as he could. She just pats him on the arm. "I know, Steve. Ok, if I can get this under control, we can just blast our way out of here, right? Maybe?"
"Hi Pepper," Steve says, looking up at her, immaculately put together despite the situation. Not a hair on her head was out of place, and she didn't look like she had been crying, only that she was so empty.
"Tony," he mutters, his glazed eyes tracking Tony's movements like his life depended on it.
"The fabric of reality rests on us returning them, so don't loose any. And don't touch them."
"We can't thank you enough, Howard. It sounds like you need to get to your wife, though, so don't let us keep you." Steve says.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're here for food and company, not looks," Steve says, slipping his hand back into Tony's, Tony responding by maneuvering his fingers to comfortably hold Steve's.
Peter squints at him. Damnit, that boy was too smart. "Don't lie to me Tony," he grumbles, pulling down a box of pop tarts. He offers one to Tony with a raised eyebrow.
Natasha walks out of the large closet in a thin cotton nightgown, yanking the huge silver hoops out of her ears. "I'd say a successful first infiltration of HYDRA."
"I'm not so sure that we could ever recreate that exact whirlwind of emotion," Steve says with a fond smile.
"How about you, me, Peter, Pepper, Rhodey, Bruce, Victor, and a massive lemon poppyseed cake?"
Tony sighs, tugging his jacket off awkwardly and throwing it in the back of the car. It slaps against the expensive leather seat with a wet noise, but he doesn't care. He sighs, setting his head in his hands. Truth told, he had thought it was the right thing to do. How he could've so grossly misunderstood the situation was beyond him, but everyone always told him that he was better with machines than people. Really, they were right. If there was a problem with a machine, you could fix it. That was half of the fun. Fixing people never works, they have to fix themselves, which is hard for Tony to understand and do. He didn't know how to help other people, and he didn't know how to fix himself. His own childhood was filled with closed doors and cold money. His teen years were the product of having no freedom growing up as well as being so far detached from his peers. Emotionally, he was decades behind them, but mentally he was decades ahead. The only common ground he could seem to find was alcohol. If everyone is blackout drunk, it's easier to just talk without fear of rejection. Of course the drinking led to sex and the sex led to scandals in the paper every other week and his current status as a playboy. He wasn't really, when it came down to it. He just craved intimacy in a way that people didn't relate to so instead he would take what he could get, which was a whole lot of one night stands.
"So that's how it is," Tony teases.
"Captain America." Betty says, with a little bit of awe in her voice. "The article I read said that you had a ring on your metal hand, is that true?" Steve holds up the arm to prove it, and she squeals. "Omg, who is she?"
Nat leans down to grab her knife off the couch, tucking it away into a fold in her sleeve in such a way that if he weren't focused on the movement, it would look like it just disappeared. "This stays between us, Stark. I know that you're going to research the stones, but you can't publish any findings until we're gone. Preferably not ever," she says, freezing him in place with a glare.
"It is." Jarvis says suddenly from the doorway. Both of them jump, and Steve can feel the near palpable shock radiating off of Natasha at the ability of the butler to sneak up on them. "You may keep it, I don't think she will want it. Please get off the counter."
And you're selling yourself short Stark. You've saved countless lives with relief programs and advancements in technology.
The only thing that could go wrong here would be the eventuality that Tony never became Ironman. That... well, Steve couldn't bear to think what that would do to this reality. It was risk that had to be taken though.
"Of course. Sit tight."
Tony wolf whistles. "So you're like, the hot shit."
"Deal."
"It's not weird to... whatever. Um. Yeah. That might be easier. Gives me time to practice."
Tony laughs, but it's a sad sort of thing that makes Steve's heart fall. "No actually... He can't actually talk about our relationship because the public doesn't know I have a son. He gets bullied more than I'd care for, but he doesn't want me to come in and mess with it so.. it stands."
Bucky pokes his head around the corner, his eyes landing on Steve crouching begins the counter with an air of confusion. "Hey Steve... what are you.. doing?"
Ft. Steve being sad as well as more family time.
There was no cutting the wire this time. "Ironman." Tony snaps, a moment of deafening silence crashing around them. Right before his eyes, the army turns to dust. Finally finally Thanos turn to dust as well. He was gone. Tony did it. Tony stumbles forward and falls back into the ground. Rhodey finds him first, falling to his knees in front of Tony. He cups his cheek and Tony musters a small smile.
"Your brother was the first option, but well.." Gideon blinks once, his grip tightening on the glass in his hand. "Anyway, if you're really unwilling, I'm sure we can find someone else, I just figured it wouldn't hurt to ask."
He nods, folding his arms over his chest. He doesn't look up at her, but the tears run out eventually. He feels a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"Lunch then," Nat agrees, walking purposefully towards the SHIELD cafeteria. There was already a table set for four with two extra chairs for Howard and Peggy. For the most part, the facility was shut down entirely, so there was little chance of interruption. Steve jr sits next to Bucky and Nat sits across from him. The two of them do most of the story telling this time around, Steve only butting in to add that Tony was currently almost 2 in this reality.
"It's too late to back out," Nat says when he gets back to the nice ish room HYDRA had assigned them.
"To be honest, I have no idea. In the future, they have these DNA tests, but I've never taken one because I'm afraid that they'll sell it to the highest bidder and someone will try to re make the serum." Tony shifts in his arms, and Steve tries not to cry. Here was his friend, his teammate, his love; dead, yet just now alive.
You want me to beat Steve's ass?
They say your life flashes before your eyes in the moments before your death. Tony would argue that that's not exactly true. All he could see was clarity. Everything he had ever done, every choice he had ever made was all leading up to this moment, this sacrifice. Him and Steve had never had it easy. It had never been easy, but Tony had never been happier to be loved by someone ever, because that was all it took to save Steve's life. No matter what, Steve would be able to walk away from here, alive and with the stone. They could save Earth, save everyone. Maybe Steve would take care of Peter. That would be nice. His rocky death grows ever closer but all he can see is Steve's blue eyes, staring at him with tears streaming down his face. If this was it, Tony was happy to die like this.
Twenty minutes later, Tony walks out into the common floor, sans Bucky. He opens his arms and collapses right into Steve's chest, making his Mario Kart character swerve off the track. Steve couldn't care less, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony's warm body, clinging to him like a drowning man. Nat swings by and grabs his controller, picking up where he left off.
"Of course you've been working hard. Well, I've must be off, but if Clint, Bruce, and Thor show their ugly mugs, I'm afraid we'll just have to preemptively evacuate New York."
"Alas, that means no motorcycle," Tony says, fanning his face with his hand a look of colonial distress on his face as he leans into Steve's chest.
"He forgave you."
"No one is flirting with anyone."
"Tony made some, but they're not even close to cost sufficient, so they were never released." Natasha cuts in, smiling at Steve. If she knew that Steve didn't actually know that, he didn't know, but he did know that she probably wasn't lying. It was entirely plausible, and more importantly, she wasn't a liar.
Tony wraps the gauze around him slowly, watching every twitch of his face. "Oh yeah big guy? What's the first." He can't help the tiny smile that sneaks it's way onto his face.
Tony walks back into the compound, straight towards the lab, where the iron gauntlet was sitting, just waiting to hold the power of the universe.
"Good." Steve says, squeezing his shoulder, while making an unspoken eye contact with Tony that conveyed enough to get the point across.
"The fountain in Central Park." Steve says, shooting Tony and Bucky a thumbs up.
Tony smiles. "Thanks Bucky. Now how about you save me from the scary cake."
"Don't. I'm alright." Steve tries to muster a smile, but he suspects his efforts failed judging by the look persisting on Scott's face. "People die. Tony and I weren't close." He wasn't lying, he wasn't. Tony and he weren't friends anymore; Steve had burned that bridge long ago. He would fight Tony again in that bunker to save Bucky's life, but given the chance he wouldn't lie to him. Not again, not ever.
That explains literally nothing...
Maria smiles after them, shaking her head. "I'm going to sit now, but you may feel free to join."
Peter makes another noise of protest, pulling on Tony's jeans. "I traded Captain America for the lives of all the people that got snapped," Steve says bluntly.
And above all, the idea that everything went how it had to. He hears a strangled, pitiful sound come out of his throat, then he feels pain splitting through his knees. Two hands find his cheeks moments later, and he returns to reality to find Morgan's face in front of his. "Don't cry Mr. Steve." He pulls the girl to his chest, giving her the biggest hug he can muster.
"You need to get cleaned up." Evident by the blood smearing her lips and hands. "Congratulations, dear, they like you."
Ht unwraps the seat belt from around his arm, doing his absolute best to take the pain. If he were like 2% more unstable, he would be wishing he had some extremis right about now. "Jarvis, can you... unlock the gauntlet?" The gauntlet clicks, just above the break. Jarvis doesn't comment, probably so Tony could just focus on his task. His very painful task.
"I'll be ready." Steve's answer is easy, but his mind is racing before he can even get the words out. That's how he could leave. He could go somewhere his mistakes could never catch up with him. Better yet—he could fix his mistakes. Bucky—Peggy—Tony—he could even say goodbye to Nat.
"Okay kids, who wants to go first?"
Not that it was a big deal. Tony was an adult. He didn't need to get married, he didn't need to have kids, he didn't need any of it. Sometimes though, he really wishes he could have someone to share his life with.
"That sounds stupid."
"Nat wouldn't quit asking if he was pregnant," Steve adds with a smile, fondly recalling the exact circumstances of that conversation. She was with Steve when Bucky called in sick for Sam so she heard the bit about the cramps. She wouldn't let up the joke for weeks, even Clint got in on it. At one point she even got her ear up on his belly. Sam, ever the sport, did nothing to dissuade the joke and even played into it more than once.
He smiles up at her. "Go easy on em." She pats his hand.
"You're fucking kidding," Tony says with an amazed look on his face.
Not that he blamed him for that. Nat was rather terrifying. One of Steve's fondest college memories was Nat snapping a dudes finger after he touched her plate presentation of a croissant. Yeah, but somebody had to put Brock in his place, and well.. there was a pretty nurse at the local ER, so maybe he was fine with it.
"Why me?"
"For fucks sake Howard, it's me."
"Are you sure?" Bucky says between heavy breaths.
"Well, they're not here n—"
"Lady Jame expressed an excitement to meet you."
Maybe he could wade through some poison ivy before the wedding. That would probably help him keep his damn head on. God damnit.
She smiles at him. "I'm good right now, thank you."
Steve grits his teeth, but walks down the hall to Bucky's room, labeled with "the better groom," which Sam hadn't known about until it was too late. He opens the door to find Clint sitting there, retelling the story of his own wedding while patting Bucky's back comfortingly. "Clint." Steve says, and Clint looks up at him.
"We're public figures, Tony," Steve says gently, rubbing at his scalp gently.
"Actually it involves her," Steve says, following Thor as he walks. "We got the reality stone out of her."
"Hi." Bucky says, waving at them slowly, his eyes flicker to Steve, then he looks down at the ground. "Tony said you were looking for me."
Every one of Steve's last minute plans go right out the window as he leads Tony over to the couch, tossing a blanket around them. "How do you know?" Maybe Tony was just overthinking it. Wouldn't that be nice. Everything would be fine, and Peter would show up. Problem solved.
With a measurable amount of effort, Steve tears his eyes away from Tony to scan the other people there. More and more people were filling into the massive ballroom, but the only one that surprises him is Wanda, on the arm of Victor, smiling up at him. He had known she was going to a wedding, but if he had known it was going to be this one, he would've never come. She could easily have delivered the cake.
Steve's hums out his affirmation, pretty much ready to give Tony literally whatever he asked for right now. Steve swears, if he asked for the moon on a string, he would find a way to get it for him.
One time, long before the snap, before the takedown of SHIELD even, they had gone to one of Stark's galas together. It was sorta a fun thing, sorta a mission. Fury had gotten intel that some enemy agents would be there to get some SI plans. Steve hadn't wanted to go, and he hadn't been told she would be there, but he did and she was. She had looked stunning, dressed in all red from to the clips holding her hair up and the hoops in her ears down to her pumps. The long dress had shown off her body nicely, with a slit high enough to provide her a full range of motion if the need arose. Perhaps the monochromatic look would've been terrible on anyone else, but she had somehow pulled it off. "Hey there grandpa," she said with her signature smirk on her red lips.
"Of course sir."
"Of course, oh my god!" He strides over to Sam, wrapping the other man up in his arms.
She rises to her feet, looking down at the magic still floating through her fingers. It's like a punch to the gut, the way she admired it. She was dirty from not showering and there was a big red pimple on her cheek bone, but in that moment, Steve could've sworn this was the most beautiful he's seen her. He shakes it out of his head... probably just residual fever shit. "Alright boys, what do you say we test this out." She smirks at them, raising a brow with her eyes a fiery orange. A ball of the magic swells in her hand and she hurls it at the wall. It... spreads across the wall like rippling smoke. Steve feels his chest deflate a little. "Or not..." she looks down at her hand, all the glow gone from her eyes. She sits down at the foot of Steve's bed, hunching over her hand. "Any ideas."
"Peter's a big kid. And he has you to help him." Steve pats his shoulder comfortingly.
Steve nods a couple times, his eyes darting between Tony's face and tented pants. "Use the tie as a blindfold, dear." Tony has to stare back at him for a moment before Steve complies. "You already know who's fucking you, don't you," Tony mutters as a halfway explanation, really more just wanting to get Steve all rumpled up.
Natasha lets out an actual genuine laugh. "No, no, not like that. We're just.. really good friends."
Steve jr. strides up to him and hugs him tightly. "Thought I lost you," he says, one hand finding the cold metal arm.
"Right.. well, I'm sure we'll be able to fit your needs, if you'd like a card." Steve plucks a business card with the words Star Bakery written on it in swirling blue letters.
"Ok."
Then there was Wanda and her brother Pietro that were his youngest employees by far, but when the young twins had come into the store with flourishing Western European accents and nowhere near enough meat on their bones, with resumes and what were clearly their nicest clothes, Steve couldn't help but feel responsible for them. He had taken them on as a kindness, but they had turned out to be wonderful employees. Both could bake well enough and they were good at following instructions, even if they had a bit of a rebellious streak. They had been adopted from Sokovia when they were only 5 by a man who had turned out to be a psycho murderer who's name they never uttered. The cops had got the twins out just in time and they got stuck in the system, but it was the American system at least. When they turned 18, they moved to New York with nothing but the clothes on their back, hanging out around a homeless shelter. That was where Clint had met them and directed them to the bakery. Now the twins crashed in Bucky's old room in Steve's apartment. It was a little weird, but they helped cover rent and they were technically adults, so really, it wasn't wrong.
"Steve. Cap. Steve. Yes really. You're living in the future. Really, we'll be getting responses in moments. Things are faster now." He winks, tapping a few more buttons and then setting the tablet down. "There. You want some ice cream? What about Chinese. I can call Clint for Chinese, he's never doing anything important."
"Going quantum in three..two..one." The machine beeps to life, glowing around him, then he's gone.
After a full night of avoidance, Peter was.. well, not really cornered. He was next to the elevator, but at least he didn't look like he was going to bolt. "What, dad?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ok Bucky, look at me." Thankfully, Bucky didn't look like he was having an actual panic attack right now, so the situation wasn't all lost. Another plus, no tears in his eyes.
"It's rude to be so beautiful," Steve counters, walking away and around the counter to come sit at the stool which Tony was now facing, leaning against the counter with the top two buttons of his shirt undone—you could ask Steve when that happened, but he couldn't give you an answer—a lazy grin on his face.
"God you're acting like a toddler," Steve says, quietly, the hand slipping up the back of Tony's shirt saying otherwise. The elevator opens for them, and Steve steps in, not waiting for the door to shut to press Tony roughly up against the wall of the elevator and kiss him deeply. Tony grins into the kiss as someone—Steve doesn't care who—pretends to gag behind them, pulling Steve down impossibly closer. "You're such a fucking brat," Steve mutters, tugging on Tony's hair gently.
Howard and Jarvis were away in California, and Maria had left Steve and Nat to babysit while she was at a gala. The TV was on, but Tony was much more interested in the little toy circuit board Howard had gotten him. For the most part, Tony would just hit the pieces together, but once while nobody was looking he had made it light up.
"God what a bitch," Nat says, flipping her off behind her back.
"Asgard?"
They're swept into a car and rushed to New York by private plane, where they are all escorted into a private room that, if Steve had to guess, was 32 degrees Fahrenheit, given the ice crystals still frozen of his face laying in front of them. This Steve is hooked up to a machine, although Steve doesn't know what it's measuring given that he was still frozen solid. "We can begin thawing him now.. based on the tests we did on human models, I think we have a basic idea of how not to kill him."
"Tony was a real jackass back then. We met once in '03. I was 19, fresh out of the red room. I was there to take out some guy feeding information to a rival organization. Ran into him instead, he was absolutely off his rocker drunk, and adamant about getting me in bed. I left him knocked out in a men's restroom and took out the man I had been sent there for." She has her arms crossed over her chest, and a near wistful look on her face. Steve can't help but be held captive by the tale about two people he knows better then anyone else, yet both so opposite from how he knows them. It was also one of the only times he had heard a shred of a story from one of her KGB missions. "I'm just glad he didn't recognize me in '10, that woulda been a hell of a thing to explain."
Peter.
“It would be pretty inappropriate to ask for your number right now, huh? Seeing as we’re picking up our closest friends who were both WIA?”
“No,” Tony replies, after staring at the modern Roman god for a few seconds too long. “Um, why?”
“Nope,” Peter squeaked, jumping on the bed and covering his ears. “Not doing this, nopity nope
they would find each other as soon as Tony fucked out of the picture. He doesn’t blame them. He can’t -- he gets it.
guilty for everything. When Peter let go of his lip, he whispered, “Okay.”
to leave. It was located in a really bad neighborhood, pretty much completely run by two rival gangs, and Steve was terrified to let Peter stay there for very long. Virtually as soon as they were able to move all their belongings to Bucky’s home, they did. As far as Peter knew, they moved because it was dangerous, too small, and the most
A week later, Steve had finished reorganizing all of his own things. His art supplies were stuffed into two small, cardboard boxes, taped shut and tucked away in the corner of Bucky’s garage. All of his winter clothes - coats, sweaters, socks, and more - were boxed up next to the art stuff, and Peter’s were on top. He basically packed up everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary for teaching (and his sketchbook, along with the corresponding pencils, because he, selfishly, couldn’t imagine going a day without it) and stuffed it all into the garage, taking up as little space as possible.
prayer,
, but it is
Bucky grinned. “Did you study?”
Still, the image of the two of them, drinking lemonade on a fresh cut lawn, burned into Steve’s mind and closed up his throat. He thought about it a lot - when he was job hunting, when he was tapping his foot and waiting for his interview with the manager, when he was laying in bed at night, one arm curled around Peter and the other propping his head up. He let himself imagine, if only for a second, what life could be like if they just had
“Thank you, Daisy,” he says smoothly, though decidedly not flirtatiously; she’s very obviously in the college-high school age range, or at least much,
-- “I run an art studio.”
seriously COMMENT UR IDEAS FOR NEXT CHAPTER i wanna include bucky but idk what specifically about him y’all would like to see!!!! lmk!!!!! love u all
“Oh,” Peter responded, nodding thoughtfully. “That’s cool.”
Bucky laughs loudly, but Steve laughs
She paused, and shook her head. “No,” she responded with furrowed brows. “But,” she added, “I know he’s been hanging with the Keener boy today. How about I have Clint take you to Harley and you can ask him?”
“Call him Jim,” Bucky adds, a little smirk on his face like he’s spilling secrets or inside jokes with people who could never understand. “We had a little spat about who could be called James. I won.”
Peter scanned the room, looking out for what didn’t make his stomach churn. He
Well. Peter didn’t have a phone, so this concept - Peter, being out of Steve’s line of sight when he was very much supposed to be - left a gaping hole in Steve’s stomach. He was completely sick at the thought of Peter being anything
“Tony, I’ve got your Pink Drink,” calls Daisy, before Tony can find another app to distract himself with. He pockets his phone again, slinking up to the countertop once more as quickly and casually as he can. He’ll mull over the Virginia/Natasha thing a different time.
“OJ was found not guilty, so for legal reasons, that joke is in poor taste,” Peter remarked, as if his mouth was working on autopilot. He blushed when the words catch up to him, but bit down the apology that bubbled up. “But, um, yeah. Apple juice.”
By the time Steve got back to the shelter -
With how embarrassed Steve had been, Tony was really betting for something a little
But there
A brisk glance to Tony’s watch indicates that Rhodey’s flight should have landed a few minutes ago, and should be unloading the passengers soon. A topsy-turvy feeling crawls through Tony’s gut briefly, although it’s mostly positive. (There’s a very small part of him that is disappointed, because the sooner Rhodey’s flight lands, the sooner Tony say goodbye to Steve. And Steve has very pretty eyes that Tony would like to keep looking at.)

and here are the names you cannot forget.
He stuffed his sandwich further into his mouth. He wouldn’t think about that for now. For now, he’d focus on the sounds of his friends’ conversation delving into chaos while he sat, peacefully, in the middle of it all.
“Have you seen Peter?” Steve asked, perhaps a little hysterically, after running back to the front desk and catching May in between calls.
Steve pushed their bodies apart. “Peter Benjamin Rogers, I will pull you out of nerd school and send you to that private junior high if you say crap like that again.”
“Nice to meet you, Harley,” Steve said, voice soft and light despite the pitter-patter in his heart that was just barely slowing down.
He’s 20 minutes early. Tony can count on one hand the number of times he’s been early to anything, so his arrival time actually says a lot about how important this is. And, well, what the hell is a guy who’s 20 minutes early supposed to do except pull out Instagram and stalk his ex’s new girlfriend’s profile in a very polite, totally-moved-on kind of way?
They hugged each other too, bidding each other goodbye with a promise to get dinner sometime the following week lolling off their tongues. Peter waved to Bucky through the window when Steve drove away, and Bucky waved back, his metal arm stuffed nervously into the front pocket of his jeans. He was always afraid whenever they leave for a shelter, like how Steve was whenever he heard on the radio there was an active shooter situation or a high speed chase or an armed robbery, because even without hearing Bucky’s badge number, he always felt sure Bucky was there, doing his job, like he always did; they were both afraid that one day, one of them wouldn’t come home.
“I’m gonna set you up with a tutor,” Steve quipped. “Someone to make your brain exercise.”
Bucky hugged Peter first when they were about to drive away. He leaned down and whispered something in Peter’s ear, and Steve didn’t think much of it because
“Yeah,” Harley confirmed. “Next time he’s here, ask him for that chem set. He loves the nerdy kids. That’s how I fixed Ab-E. He bought me all the stuff I needed to repair her.”
Steve held Peter’s face in his two large hands and pressed their foreheads together. Steve shut his eyes as he felt his son’s small, tender hands reach around and lay flat against his back. “What did I do to deserve such a good kid, huh?”
been such, with Steve’s consistent absence and unavailability when Peter was younger.)
Peter will never choose a real favorite, right? But he will keep stringing you along, ‘cause he’s a spoiled brat.”
- can’t even compare.”
Steve sighed, maybe gasped, and it sounded broken and a little bit exasperated even in his own ears. He swallowed, dropped his hands and began to walk towards the front door again. “Peter’s gonna be late,” he whispered, and Bucky only shrugged.
, not a capital letter in sight, and a little heart --
, amongst other things - so it held a special spot in both their hearts. Normally, Steve said it, and whatever was on Peter’s mind quiets enough that he decides he could wait for a while until he brings it up again; this time, though, Peter was unaffected by the name.
“‘Kay,” he mumbled, cheeks still pink. Steve smiled sadly at him, and waited as his heart cracked inside of his chest.
"Good night, Natasha." He squeezes her hand gently, closing his own eyes. Sleep claims him quickly.
"Do you want to see Peggy? She's busy, but I'm sure she'll make time for you." His voice is tender at that, because of course he knows exactly how much he missed her. How much he hopes she misses him.
"That doesn't sound right." Tony chuckles. "I'll help you find him. I get it. As long as you make him promise not to touch your butt."
Even though Steve hadn't been on a real date in so long, he knew enough to know that it's not really that easy usually.
"And... kiss me. Right now."
His friends were the worst. Sure, they got him out of more sticky situations then he cared to count, but they were so mean.
"I lied. This is very nice."
He puts it down, letting his phone sit on Peters back, his hand resting over the phone. Peter snores once and Tony's heart melts. He was a good kid. The kids at his school were assholes, but lucky for them, Peter was too good of a kid to let Tony have at them or even have a press conference with Peter. Still, Tony wasn't entirely useless, and he had connections with the royal family of Wakanda, so as soon as the SATs were over, Pete was taking a week off to hang out with Princess Shuri. Unfortunately that meant he wasn't attending Pepper and Rhodey's reception, but Tony insisted on Peter taking off for Wakanda the second the ceremony was over. His phone buzzes under his hand.
"And the shadow people?"
"Yeah. Bye sir."
Tony cuts in before they can come to blows once more. "Yippee, how about you take us up now, jackass." The red skull fixes him with a look and turns back around climbing up towards the peak. Tony lowers his gauntlet, looking over at Steve, who has a massively pissed off (and upset) look on his face. Steve looks back over at him, then sighs and follows after the red skull. Tony follows as well, not particularly loving the idea of being left behind, even in his suit.
"We're not naming our—never mind. Yes." Rhodey says, pulling his wife into his arms tightly. "I guess we have an announcement to make you guys." Wanda puts her hands over her heart and both Victor and Peter get the same look in their eyes. Bruce smiles gently, peeking over Tony's shoulder at the pictures. "We're expecting."
He nods, pouting at her. She sets him down in the crib, swiping her thumb on his cheek. "You ready?"

"Oh I'm not, I was going to run by Victor's. Wanda asked me to bring her a dress. Apparently they're going on a date." His voice takes a bit of a mocking tone at the last sentence, but Steve knows that for all his bravado, Pietro actually liked Victor. He was a decent guy from what Steve had seen of him. Very polite. Obviously he had come from money, so Steve had been a bit wary at first, but he did really love Wanda, middle class as she was. "I don't get why she can't come by herself, but who am I to question the mistress."
"If you're gonna kiss I ask you go away," Clint says.
"And I have you to help me." Tony confirms, looking up at him sweetly.
Tony laughs. "It's ok. No actually." He takes his left hand off the controls and wiggles his fingers. "Engaged."
Footsteps approach and a tall man glares down at her. "What do you want?" He says in a gruff heavily German accent.
"Great, thanks doll!" She says. Steve looks down at his watch. Yeah it was time to start.
Well, Pepper gets the beautiful chocolate cake (sans-frosting) smeared on her nose, as does James, who Tony tells him is actually called Rhodey, and all's well that ends well. "Have I told you how pretty you look yet?" Steve asks, holding a glass of champagne and leaning on a pillar near the outskirts of the ballroom.
Tony makes a little huff against Steve's chest. "Great you're enjoying this. Thought you'd be upset your ex and your boyfriend were getting along so well."
"No, because." Tony stands up quickly, and Steve sees his body flinch harshly, his hand clenching tightly at his side. "And then... but you. He.." He begins pacing back and forth, face twisting in pain at each step.
Steve rises back to his feet, thoroughly disgusted with himself. Bucky leans through the window, his eyes concerned as they look Steve up and down. "Don't mention it, really. I don't want to talk about it. Also, would you mind doing a wedding for me?"
“What now?”
“Yes. Joined in holy matrimony, wedded bliss, SHIELD-sanctioned posing for the paparazzi.”
“I do deserve congratulations, don’t I,” Tony says airily, squeezes Steve a little tighter, somehow making it a show while feeling more comforting, grounding. “Landing Captain America is the coup of the century. Speaking of,” and he turns more fully into Steve, “get me another drink, Apple Jack? Pretty please?” Tony bats his eyelashes outrageously.
“We weren’t even gone two weeks,” Steve had pointed out.
And that wasn’t even something Tony thought he wanted to hear, but it gets him right where he lives, and he just stands there for a long moment, trying to think of something witty to say, but mostly just gaping like a fish.
There’s an elevator waiting inside the Avengers’ private entrance, and Steve steps into it with a heavy feeling in his stomach. Even though he’s aware the fight was mostly his fault, and he knows he shouldn’t have gone off the way he did, he’s still upset. Tony’s words still rankle, and he can’t shake the feeling of horror he’d been hit with when he saw that alligator’s jaws crunch down on the Iron Man suit, when he’d heard the screech of teeth on metal and seen the arm buckle, when Tony had been thrown headlong into the tunnel wall, and when Steve had seen all the damage afterwards, when they got back up into daylight. Tony’s refusal to take his concern seriously was just the final straw. Steve’s still not sure if he can face him without yelling again.
It’s a little odd seeing Clint and Natasha in street clothes, especially next to Coulson’s crisp suit and Ms. Potts’s neat skirt and blouse, but there’s something comfortable about it, all the same. Banner seems more relaxed than Steve thinks he’s ever seen him, hair still sleep-rumpled, drinking tea, and nodding at something Natasha is saying. Tony looks like he wandered up from the workshop, stripped down to a grease-streaked undershirt and still wearing what Steve is pretty sure are the pants from the night before. From what Jarvis said earlier, Steve thinks it’s probably a safe guess that Tony slept down there. Or didn’t sleep, as the case may be.
Tony opens his mouth to say something, anything, to make Steve look less like he might cry, but the collective shout and groan of the crowd draws Steve’s attention back to the game, and the moment passes. Tony breathes a silent sigh of relief, and makes a mental note about Steve and hockey.
“I’m… sorry?” It comes out as a slightly bemused question.
“Huh,” Tony flicks his fingers apart for a better view of the joint on the prosthetic he’s been trying to realign. “Has it been that long?”
“Tony.”
“Ready?” Rhodey asks, tugs the cuffs of his own suit.
about doing what you usually do, I will leave you to handle the outcome on your own.”
“Everywhere,” Steve tells him. “For all the good
“Gone?”
“If you think I don’t know Jarvis warned you I’d do something dire if you didn’t pick up, you’ve got another think coming,” Pepper tells him tartly, but she looks marginally placated. She’s stopped scowling at least. “You’ve got your interview with Anderson Cooper tomorrow. I know it will be difficult for you, but you need to not flirt with him.”
“I want to be the little spoon,” Tony declares, both because he does, and because he thinks it will make Steve laugh.
“Are you going to tell me a story?” Tony asks. It’s a little bitter, more than a little tired, but mostly curious, so Steve will count it as a win.
Eventually, Steve finds himself outside a café he’s been to at least a dozen times. It’s usually packed in the morning, but this late in the afternoon there are only a handful of people inside. He orders a drink and settles in at one of the tables, a sketchbook from his bag open in front of him.
“Looking forward to the show?”
“Of course,” Tony waves a hand like it’s a foregone conclusion that he would share whatever information he digs up.
That decided, Steve tucks his pillow more firmly under his head, and lets himself drift off to a slideshow of memories of kissing Tony over the last few months, the cameras and crowds nowhere to be seen.
“What I want to know is how did these things get so
“Help each other out.” Tony’s pretty sure he sounds like a broken record. Or a parrot. He’s usually more articulate than this, he’s almost positive.
“What are the rest of us, rat food?” Barton demands.
“Yes, that’s right,” Pepper answers for Tony, which is probably for the best, since Tony’s not sure what he would have said. “I’m not sure how anyone would find out if they weren’t living together, but these things always seem to get out somehow.”
Steve glances around the space. There’s not much here he’s particularly attached to, just a few things he’s picked up over the last months, and even those aren’t all that important. He’s still settling in, really, hasn’t had time to make much of a home here. “Why don’t you start out here, Agent…” Steve trails off expectantly.
Thor grins broadly. “I had heard as much,” he replies, voice somehow managing to be a quiet boom, perhaps out of respect for the late hour. “I thank you for it.”
Then there’s the sound of inarticulate hollering coming both over the comms and through the air, and pigeons scatter as Tony comes barreling in, the suit like a battering ram, repulsors blazing.
And Steve. Steve doesn’t know what to do with that. “2008?” he repeats.
“Ms. Potts is on the line for you, Sir,” he explains before Tony can remind him that he’s officially not home, and shouldn’t be getting calls, anyway. “She asks that you not make her come down here again, or she will ensure you attend and participate in every accounting meeting next quarter.”
“Mute,” Tony grits out, and Jarvis falls silent.
“Has he eaten already?”
“Phil, you’re looking well.” Pepper’s wearing a proper smile, Tony notes, nothing twitchy about it.
“Jarvis, save this, here, and that,” Tony says, waving the images clear.
“Great,” Tony says again. “Tell Cap to get his spangled butt up here when he’s decent. I’ll fly us out. It’ll be faster than the jet, and if Tweedledee and Tweedledum are coming from SHIELD, they’ll have one, and I don’t think we’ll have space to land two.”
“Don’t let this idiot drag you in,” she warns, jerking her thumb at Clint, who pretends to look wounded.
Steve shuffles through the papers again, and he understands what the aim is, now, but the wording hasn’t gotten any less ridiculous. He wishes, for half a second, that he could ask Tony what he thinks of all of this without so many other people around. He feels like he gets more straightforward answers when they’re one-on-one.
“Ok,” Tony nods, turns decisively away from the mirror and heads for the door.
Bruce hums. “Agent Coulson?”
“I was hoping,” Steve shifts like he’s uncomfortable. “Maybe somewhere else?”
Steve claps a hand down on top of Tony’s, then carefully peels his fingers away, turning his hand over to hold. It’s not ideal, but better than the alternative. Tony shoots him a surprised look that quickly turns back into a fake smile.
“You could.” Tony hadn’t even meant to say it, but the words are out there, and he can’t take them back.
might not always like it, but he knows. We have to be ahead of this thing, whatever it is. You talk about sharing, but you won’t even trust us enough to talk to us about what you’re going through, and you don’t ever actually ask about us, either, you just sit in judgement and get angry that no one feels comfortable telling you their deepest, darkest secrets for you to trample over. Everything’s black and white with you. You make up your mind, and that’s it, you’re right, everyone else is wrong, and how dare we have opinions that aren’t yours.” Tony takes a breath, then another, a third, deeper. This isn’t how he wanted this to go. It’s almost like that first meeting, back on the first Helicarrier, the first time the scepter got into their heads. He feels it fizz under his skin – fight or flight, and he never was very good at fleeing – but this isn’t going to help anything, and he knows that.
“You handled the lawyers?” Tony asks.
Steve thinks for a minute he means something specific, glances at the clock on the stove automatically, but it’s still the middle of the night. Then he realizes Tony just means he needs to do something with his hands, the way Steve sometimes will sketch when he wakes up in the middle of the night, needs something he knows how to control.
This groundbreaking statement is met with nothing but the continued sound of fighting for a long moment, then, “What are you talking about?” Natasha asks.
Steve’s mouth moves a little, like it would try for a smile in daylight, and he nods, pushing himself up and out of his chair. “Okay,” he repeats, and then goes about filling the kettle Tony didn’t even know they had with water, and setting it on the stove to boil while he pulls down two fresh mugs and sorts through the collection of teas Tony had also somehow missed. “Dr. Banner likes tea,” Steve says, like he can read Tony’s mind even with his back turned. “And Natasha. And Clint, actually. Thor won’t touch it, but that’s somehow not very surprising.”
you –” Tony starts, knows the grin is audible in his voice.
“Don’t be such a wuss, Iowa,” Steve sounds like he’s trying not to laugh. “They were twice this size where I grew up.”
“Nothing,” Tony says dismissively, waving it off. “I just wanted to clarify that this arrangement doesn’t have to ruin your life. You can still have one, just make sure it’s discreet, at least for now.”
“Man’s got a point,” Clint puts in, the faint twang of his bowstring sounding odd over the comms. “I’m using tranqs and nets, and nothing’s keeping these things down.”
And this, this right here is what Steve keeps forgetting in the heat of the moment, when his blood’s up and the adrenaline is high, when he’s worried, or angry, or frustrated. Right now, in
“Of course,” like it’s just that easy. “Let me just,” Steve jerks his head back towards the bathroom, and Tony lets him go.
“Well.” Fury narrows his eye at him, then skims a glance around the group. “Anyone else?”
Steve makes for the farthest bar, tucked away in a quiet corner, knows with uncomfortable certainty that he can take as long as he needs, and Tony will keep the vultures so busy they won’t even notice Steve’s absence. Not only has Steve been too quick to judge – and judge unfairly and harshly – but he hasn’t even been pulling his own weight, even though he really is just as much to blame for this situation as Tony. He can change that, though.
stop it. The Maximoff girl, she showed me – you knew. You knew I could have saved everyone. You knew it, at the end, when I was watching you die. When it was too late for any of us. I can’t let that happen.”
interested, and it makes Steve wonder about more than just kissing, if that would be as good, what Tony might be like if they didn’t have an audience.
, and Tony will be damned if he lets his best friend fly anything that isn’t as safe as he can make it. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles the suits he’s making for himself have these days, but Rhodey’s not much for bells and whistles unless they look like rocket launchers. Tony blames the army. Sucks all the fun right out of a person.
Tony blinks.
“Working on it,” Coulson replies shortly. There’s a burst of gunfire reports, and a handful of human screams mixed with the grating screeches from the rats. “More cover for the evacuees would be good right about now.”
Steve suppresses a sigh. “I’ll just see myself out, then,” he says to no one, and turns back towards the door in the glass wall and the elevator beyond.
“Oh?” Tony’s eyes are fixed firmly on his own fingers as they move.
“There will be an after,” Steve insists, tips their foreheads together. “I’m going to take you out for dinner,” he says, voice gone soft.
“Anything you say, Panda Bear,” Tony waves him off, rolling his eyes, and turns back to the schematics he’d been fussing with before dinner.
Steve opens his mouth again to say that he knows that, it took him a while, and some pretty big signs pointing the way, but he’s there now, but Ms. Potts isn’t done.
Possible. Steve is all about Doing Good, and he’s also the type to get a sort of vindictive pleasure out of a place like Maria’s, that sells High Society cast-offs to the middle upper echelons of society for obscene prices, and then donates all the proceeds to a handful of homeless shelters around the city. “Worth a shot,” Tony concedes, and waves Pepper off to her meeting.
Pepper says something, probably introducing the woman, and Tony nods, but he’s still watching Steve, can’t seem to not, stuck somewhere between
“I’ve always been impressed by sculptors’ ability to show the details of cloth in stone,” Steve says, pulling Tony out of his thoughts. “I never really wanted to do stone carving, myself, but I’ve always been curious.”
“For all the good it does,” Bruce responds. “Can you pinpoint a direction, yet?”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Come on, Tony, you know you’re not. You’re not exactly hard on the eyes.”
“Have to keep on living,” Clint had said. “Can’t bring them back, can’t
Tony’s face is trying to do something, but he’s not quite sure what. He’s not sure it knows, either, and it’s still tingling a little, but at least he can feel it. “You just told me Hydra killed my parents – that your now missing, previously presumed-dead best friend probably killed them – and I just had a panic attack on the floor of the house that belongs to a family I didn’t know existed, where we’re hiding from a genocidal robot I accidentally brought to life while trying to save the world. I’ve been better.”
“Oh,” Tony frowns. “No.” He digs through his drawers for socks and underwear. “He lives here, now, so he should be able to come and go.”
“Mm,” Rhodes hums, then gives Steve a surprisingly piercing look. “I’d meant to say this to you before, but didn’t get the chance. I know none of this was intentional, and that you were not prepared for this anymore than he was, but if you do anything to hurt Tony, I will break your kneecaps, and I will enjoy doing it, Captain America or not.”
The corners of Steve’s mouth twitch, like he’s trying to smile, but doesn’t quite remember how. “Not until tomorrow,” he says.
“Nice to see you, Tony,” Tony says, and gets three unimpressed looks for his trouble. “Just finishing the rounds,” he tells them breezily, and pulls out a chair. “Ms. Potts,” he says, and grins sunnily at Pepper.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice sounds far away. “Tony, say something.”
“What do you mean ‘gone’?”
“I have taken the liberty of calling the lift for you, Captain,” Jarvis says.
“I didn’t say it was just about the two of you getting hitched,” Rhodey points out, and kindly doesn’t say anything about the way Tony twitches. “The man has been through a lot, and it’s not going to get fixed in a month, or a year, or even a few years. He’s handling it all a lot better than I would, but he’s still dealing with it, and that’s going to come out in some not-so-pretty ways, sometimes.”
“No,” Steve answers airily, still determinedly not looking in Tony’s direction. “Just you.”
“Fine,” Steve replies automatically, and tries not to wince when Tony’s expression turns skeptical. “This isn’t exactly my idea of a fun time,” he allows, “but I’ve survived before, and I’ll survive again.”
“Did you swallow a textbook?” Tony wants to know.
It’s soft, and sweet, and Tony’s not sure he’s ever been kissed like this. It’s a little awkward, both of them leaning in, sitting on the floor, legs jammed uncomfortably, but Steve’s got both hands framing Tony’s face now, tilting his head to a better angle, and Tony’s got one hand sliding across Steve’s shoulder and up his neck into his hair, feeling him shiver, while he braces the other on Steve’s hip, over the pajama pants borrowed from sources unknown. The thought makes Tony laugh a little into the kiss.
like something as why he does. Tony’s pretty sure this is the most Steve has voluntarily spoken around him since they met in Germany, and instead of being bored to tears, Tony is actually, well, having fun. He can almost hear Pepper’s dry voice saying, “Wonders never cease,” and wonders if she’ll be put out when he tells her he had a good time looking at art after she tried for so many years, or if she’ll just be pleased he didn’t somehow burn everything down by tinkering with things better left un-tinkered with.
“I thank you again, my friend,” Thor beams a little brighter, and then wanders out towards the elevator.
“Her legal background is legitimate, and we don’t want to bring the company lawyers in yet. We’ll have them go over everything just before the wedding, after the news has been leaked, but we want something solid prepared before then.”
“You see?” Tony says to the couple he’s been talking to. “Captain America thinks so, too.”
Steve takes a deep breath and releases it, realizes he was standing almost at attention and forces himself to relax. If he hadn’t had it from Natasha that Tony and Ms. Potts really had broken up well before this charade started, he’d be wondering about it again. As is, he can’t help but think Ms. Potts is a little more protective of Tony than is really warranted in this situation. Steve doesn’t
Taking several deep breaths, Tony reminds himself that he can’t just fly off home to fume and kick himself for being an idiot in peace and quiet. He still has to deal with the press. And debrief at some point, assuming Steve gets his star-spangled panties out of their bunch. And get caught up on the meeting he walked out of. He slowly forces himself to relax and unclench fists he hadn’t realized he’d made.
“Can’t imagine that’s good for you right now,” Steve’s voice says from behind Tony.
“Yes, sir.” Jarvis sounds rebellious. It should probably be at least a little worrying.
“Who are we heading off?” Clint wanders in and makes a beeline for the bag of bagels. He looks a bit like he just rolled out of bed, sweatpants and t-shirt rumpled, hair sticking up. Natasha, right behind him, is, by contrast, in a neat pair of slacks and a carefully buttoned blouse, like she just stepped out of an office meeting.
Given the vast number of children around, Steve has clearly been trying to reign it in, or at least keep it clean, but Tony’s close enough to hear the muttered imprecations. He’s maybe enjoying it more than he should.
“You keep doing that,” he says, and is surprised at how angry it sounds. “Are you waiting for an invitation?”
“You’re still you,” Tony replies. He’s not sure if the question was meant to be rhetorical, but it’s not like he can let that go. “You weren’t always Captain America. You weren’t always a soldier.”
“Sometimes,” Steve says, voice still low, eyes fixed on his hands, and Tony has to shake himself out of his thoughts, “I’m back there. In the middle of a battlefield, or on the Valkyrie and going down. Sometimes I can pull out of it. Sometimes I can’t tell what I’m pulling out of.” He looks up at Tony then, meets his eyes. “Sam asked me once if I was thinking about getting out. Out of the military. Out of SHIELD. Out of fighting. I told him I didn’t know what I’d do with myself if I did. I don’t. I don’t have anything else. If I’m not Captain America, what am I?”
“What happened?”
they got into places before he’d even graduated college.
“Don’t miss me too much,” Steve says, feeling determined now, as he carefully tries to disentangle his limbs from Tony’s. Then, because he can’t pull off pet names the way Tony does, but feels like he has to do something, he presses a kiss to Tony’s cheek.
The penthouse is empty when Steve reaches it. Unsurprising, given the hour, but Steve had vaguely been hoping Tony might be there. He’d have had an easier time getting Tony to agree to going out if he didn’t have to pry him away from a project.
“I feel silly calling it a mission,” she admits, “and I don’t know – nor do I want to know – enough to be more specific.” She shrugs. “‘SHIELD thing’ seemed like a good idea in my head.”
“Right,” he says softly. “Right.” This is home. For now. He takes another deep breath, trying to fix the thought in his mind, and pushes himself up. “Lights,” he tells himself, needing the directive, and gropes for the lamp next to the bed. It flares to life before he can make contact and he jerks back. “What the hell?”
“Mm,” Pepper hums in agreement, focus shifting for a moment off to one side in response to the soft chime of an alert. “I have to go – I have a meeting in a few minutes – but I thought you’d like to know that I also got a call from the manager at Maria’s this morning. The suits you and Captain Rogers wore for the premier last week both sold in time to make the mid-month donation. She said the directors of two of the shelters have already called personally to say thank you. It sounds like it meant a lot to a lot of people to have some extra funding for Valentine’s Day, if you want to pass that on. Maybe soften the blow when you tell him about the wardrobe bans.”
Rhodey can tell he’s hesitating. They’ve always known each other so well. He can probably tell why, too, which is why he grins at Tony all smug and says, “Introduce me to your friend.”
Steve blushes a little bit more. “Some people think it’s weird. I came back from fighting terrorists to teach kids how to draw fruit. But I like it.
It only took a few more days for him to go through all of Peter’s things. Peter had probably twice as much stuff, but Steve let him keep twice as much as he let himself keep (because Peter was a kid and
“It’s no life for a kid,” Steve responded quietly. “It’s time I get my act together. Get us a nice house. With a dog and - and an apple tree, and we’ll bake cookies together in a big kitchen, with marble counters and two whole ovens. Right?”
“Thank you,” Steve said again, and Clint smiled. Peter parroted it, so Clint paused.
And then Steve said, “I sure did. It was near the end of my shift…”
Steve was proud, sure, but he was also afraid that nothing would
“Have a good day, gremlin,” Bucky told him, and Peter’s cheeks might have just ripped apart with how widely he beamed. “Good luck with those tests, okay?”
When Harley smiled at him, Peter thought he’d like to spend hours counting the stars in his eyes, but he almost shut that down in realizing there were far too many to count. Still, he thought to himself,
The man laughs, his soft expression morphing into something even friendlier, glittering with amusement. “That’s nice,” he says, and anyone else would make it sound so disingenuous, but there’s insistence in his voice that tells Tony he means it. “Sorry, then. For bothering you.”
Peter was nowhere to be found.
is pretty strong.”
Bucky only spared Steve a glare before pushing him into the kitchen.
“School today?” Bucky asked, voice riddled with sleep. Peter nodded, bright and excited all over.
“In you go, kiddie. TV’s all yours until dinnertime.”
But Peter
Steve thought to himself,
that came with that.
Steve wasn’t grateful enough, he decided. He’d be better. He’s going to be better.
“Hey, Dad!” Peter said, jumping out from behind Clint. “Sorry, I was gonna go back up to the room, but I lost track of time. Did I freak you out?”
Steve glared at him. “Peter, you are not allowed to kiss anyone. If I find out you are kissing someone, I will have to share embarrassing baby photos with their parents to blackmail you and whoever you’re kissing.”
And this was their fourth home, fifth if you counted Bucky’s (which you probably should, for all the times that Steve and Peter stayed there). They were being evicted once more, because Peter needed braces and glasses, and the district was making a lot of cuts so the art teachers had to buy their own supplies at the start of the school year, and Steve indulged himself a little too much and bought himself new pens. There was a lot of reasons Steve couldn’t afford rent this month. There was a lot of reasons he couldn’t afford it during other months too. Their landlord had never been very merciful at all.
sucked. He knew Peter felt a little left out sometimes, his only access to the internet being his school appointed Chromebook and Steve’s laptop, but they just
, and he throws himself into the arms of a laughing James Rhodes. In his peripheral vision, he sees Steve and the half-assed Keanu Reeves impersonator pull each other in for a super manly bro-hug.
“No,” Peter said finally, and Bucky snorted. “My dad hasn’t got a sugar daddy yet.”
-- is going exactly to plan. He’s got the stupid Pink Drink for hilarious, teasing purposes; he’s wearing two dog tags around his neck, one somehow weighing heavier than the other (likely due to the ring Tony has loped through it); his phone is fully charged, and Snapchat is even open. Tony isn’t one to prepare for things ahead of time -- in college, he never once studied for a test; in work, he doesn’t practice his presentations or speeches, and chooses to wing it instead; in relationships, the most planning he does successfully is writing down a birthday on his calendar just in case he forgets -- but for this, he’s more than just
something Steve
“One day, he’ll get a hot sugar daddy and all your woes will be washed away.” Peter laughed brightly, and almost said
. Don’t worry about it, Dad. I know you do everything you can for me.”
, so he bites his tongue, moves to lean against the wall beside the counter, and pulls his phone out of his back pocket while taking a long and slow sip of his cold brew.
Tony pulls away when Rhodey starts to laugh at him wetly and push him off. On his way out, though, he presses a jumbled kiss to Rhodey’s cheek, as per tradition. “Missed you,” he admits, quiet enough so only Rhodey can hear him. Beside them, Steve and Bucky pull apart, and Bucky throws a hand to push at Steve’s head, ruffling his hair consequently. Steve just chuckles, but it’s so deep that it reverberates through Tony’s chest even from three feet away.
There was a recurring dream that Steve kept having. Peter was setting up a picnic table with plates and forks, and Steve was flipping burgers on a grill. Sam, Bucky, and Natasha - Bucky’s partner - were all drinking beers, talking to the group of Peter’s friends over by the picnic table. Peter’s group kept growing; at first, it was just Ned, but in recent dreams, it’s grown to include Wade, Michelle, and as of late, Harley. Steve served Michelle and Natasha veggie burgers. Peter hugged Steve, arms wrapped around his waist and head buried in his chest, hair bristling Steve’s collarbone.
The sketch Steve is working on isn’t quite finished, but it’s close enough that he could come back to it later and it wouldn’t be a problem. It’s of Tony sprawled out on the couch the way he is now, totally absorbed in whatever he’s doing on his tablet, faint glow of the arc reactor showing through his layered shirts. Steve’s taken to drawing his teammates more, lately, and it feels – happier, somehow. He still draws bits and pieces of the city, both as it is now and as he remembers it. Sometimes he’ll sketch Peggy or Bucky, the Commandos, or other people he used to know, soldiers or neighbors from Brooklyn, his mother. It’s different, though. Not less painful, but less sharp, maybe, more a constant ache at the loss, rather than the wrenching agony he’d felt when he’d first woken up, after the reality had set in.
“Because you’re so good at just letting things go,” Tony says, something much sharper in his words now, and it hits Steve in a way he hadn’t been expecting, hard, right in the chest.
“It’s happened five times,” Rhodey corrects, somewhere between gentle and exasperated. “The last time was when you and Pepper split up.”
Clint frowns. “Will anyone buy that Stark wants a small, quiet ceremony?”
“Sir is with Ms. Potts in the living area of the penthouse,” Jarvis’s reply is prompt, but Steve is pretty sure he’s not imagining the chill to his tone. “Dr. Banner is in the penthouse kitchen. Agent Barton is on the deck. And Agent Romanoff is in the gym. Would you like to go somewhere other than the penthouse?”
moment, there is no mistaking Tony’s sincerity, or his concern. If Steve thinks about it, which he’s been doing an uncomfortable amount of the last five days, he can think of dozens of times when Tony has checked in with him just like this, when he’s made a point of making sure Steve is level. More than once Tony has found ways of helping Steve find an even keel, even if Steve hasn’t admitted to a problem, just done it in a way where Steve hadn’t even realized at the time what was happening. There are probably other times Steve doesn’t remember, times he hadn’t even known there was a problem to be fixed.
“Let me guess,” Natasha gives him a pointed look. “You told him not to bother? Water under the bridge?”
“That sounds ominous,” Banner remarks.
“Morning,” Barton says around a mouthful of eggs, impressively managing not to spray food in all directions.
“No, but it seemed more tactful than directly quoting that you would ‘bang him like a screen door in a hurricane.’” Jarvis’s voice is prim.
“When was –” Steve starts again, but Jarvis interrupts.
Pepper side-eyes him. “The board will be in favor. Captain Rogers is a stabilizing influence, apparently. Can only be good for stocks and for the company itself. That’s probably going to be the general opinion, actually. They’ll chalk your recent better behavior up to him.”
Steve frowns slightly. “What?”
“Man was stabbed and declared dead,” Tony points out, but he’s still frowning.
“Happy’s bringing the car around,” he says when they reach the short hallway at the bottom, leans against the wall by the emergency exit door, tapping something out on his phone. “Pepper’s texting us a handful of restaurants nearby to choose from – what are you in the mood for? Sushi? Steak? Shish kabobs?”
Natasha shakes her head, slicing into a bagel with slightly unnerving efficiency. “It seemed like the quickest way to get you up, and I wasn’t going to barge into Dr. Banner’s apartment and wake him up when I knew I could get you here with a minimum of fuss.”
Even though he knows it would be rude, he’s a little tempted to pull out the little notebook he keeps and sketch, just for something to do with his hands. He’s not nervous, exactly, just uncomfortable, and as much as Tony’s constant movement seems to be a regular source of irritation for whichever unfortunate is sitting next to him in meetings, Steve understands having trouble just sitting still. Especially when he’s uncomfortable.
“Goodnight, Tony.” Steve leans down to kiss Tony’s cheek on his way by. He makes it halfway back to his room before he stops dead, and replays the moment in his head.
doesn’t particularly like art, not the kind of art found in a museum like the Met, anyway, and it’s not like Steve would want to go to a museum with him, in any case. Only then Steve had
“Everyone already knows you won’t take direction, and you can’t stop your mouth,” Clint points out. “Too bad we
“And?” Natasha’s mimicked intonation is not lost on Tony.
“Thor?” Steve asks. “Dr. Banner?”
Pepper’s frowning again. “Did he move downstairs to his own apartment?” she wants to know, and there’s clearly a right answer and a wrong answer here, but Tony doesn’t know.
Tony forces himself not to grit his teeth. “Are you here to mother hen?” he wants to know. “Because I’m trying to work.”
“Seems to me it’s being handled,” Steve says. “We just show up where and when we’re told and look happy to be there. Nothing too new about that. For either of us.”
“That I was not to enlighten Captain Rogers as to your genuine regard for his person,” Jarvis says, only a little stiffly.
Steve doesn’t even get any words out this time, just opens his mouth, and shuts it again when Coulson keeps talking.
“You’re eager,” Tony manages to get out, trying for flippant and falling closer to breathy.
“That’s you done, as well,” Dan-the-makeup-artist says, tucking the last of the ever-mysterious makeup bottles into a case.
“Tony.” There’s a lot of exasperation in just those two syllables. It’s kind of impressive.
The smirk turns a little sly. “Now,” Tony says, steps right up into Steve’s space, tips up onto his toes again, “now, we go get takeout to bring home from the nicest place on Pepper’s list, and let them think whatever they want to think about that.” They’re so close they’re almost kissing, and it’s more distracting than it should be.
Ignoring the heat crawling up the back of his neck, Steve shuts off the stovetop, casting about for something to do with the eggs, which are still mostly liquid. “Right. Thank you, Jarvis. Is there something –”
Tony isn’t sure how to answer that, stares at the cufflinks in his hand, tries to focus on his breathing.
Even though he knows Thor doesn’t mean it that way, Steve still bristles. He feels like he shouldn’t be surprised that Tony might have said something like that, but it still makes something in his stomach clench. He’d thought maybe they were getting along.
,” Pepper says, raises her voice just enough that Tony knows it’s no use trying to ignore her, “to remind you that the fundraiser on Sunday night is black tie, and you are not allowed to leave either before or during the speeches. This is your first official event as a couple, we need to give everyone ample opportunity to see what an adorable and adoring pair of newlyweds you are.”
Pepper purses her lips, and Tony isn’t entirely sure whether it’s out of annoyance over his general existence and inability to do anything other than make life difficult for her, or if she’s trying not to laugh. She’s tricky like that. “Rhodey said he’d send in some initial reports on the body armor tomorrow,” she says after a moment, clearly deciding to just carry on with her to-do list. “Phil said he was on-call for the weekend, so he can come by in the afternoon with updates from SHIELD, if there are any changes since last week. I’d like you to be there in case anything needs further adjusting. The military should have final notes within another week, or so – Rhodey said they’d want to get these going as soon as possible, so they’ll make it a priority. If all goes well, we should present to the board on Monday.”
The greenroom they’re asked to wait in feels somehow too stuffy, too small for the two of them, but Steve sits silently while one of the makeup artists pokes at his face, instead of asking to wait somewhere outside. Not that there’s anywhere he could go outside. There was already a crowd when they arrived, and if the handful of interviews they’ve done so far are anything to go on, it’s only going to get worse until they leave.
“I shall make a note for Ms. Potts,” Jarvis’s voice is particularly dry. “Minced superhero insurance.”
She raises an eyebrow at him. “And we were hungry?”
“Get our things together?” Steve’s starting to feel like a broken record. He looks over at Tony, whose eyes are fixed on his phone again, fingers moving rapidly. He turns back to Coulson.
“You’re a smart guy, Cap,” Natasha says eventually, when Steve doesn’t say anything further. “I would hate to see anything happen to that.” She watches him blandly for another moment, as if watching as he tries to process what she’s just said, then nods her head politely, and walks out of the room.
Tony’s in the workshop when the pictures hit the internet. The notification chimes softly to indicate a new reference to Tony Stark in the media, followed immediately by another for images. Through the haze of Neon Knights and intense focus, Tony recognizes the alerts and categorically ignores them as unimportant until Pepper tells him otherwise.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to be confused. “Downstairs?”
Tony starts to nod automatically, then freezes, mid-nod, and narrows his eyes. “You kiss babies with that mouth?” he demands, and it’s not like he’s never heard Steve swear, but not usually so casually, and he can see the way the corner of Steve’s mouth is twitching, trying to curl up into a smile.
must still be out there, somewhere, among the multitudes of stars.
“Is Tony still in his workshop?” Steve asks, once he’s passed the security guards at the side entrance and is alone in the elevator again.
, any minute now. “I know,” he says, grips Rhodey’s wrists and hangs on for just a second. “And I appreciate it. I do. This is not what I thought I’d be doing with my life right now.”
“Good for the soul,” Tony replies promptly.
track record. And this is going to suck as much for him as for me, and I’d rather not have my inconvenient teenaged crush paraded around making things worse for both of us. I need you to have my back on this, J.”
“I always forget you’re an artist,” Tony says, which, well, it’s not exactly a lie, but it’s not quite the truth, either.
“We never
just tell them the truth.”
“No shit,” Tony grates out, holds on harder. Knowing what’s going on isn’t the issue here.
Midway through June, Tony takes Steve to a baseball game, and doesn’t realize until they’re at Citi Field that it’s Father’s Day. Not that it should matter, they get people coming up to them any time they’re recognized, asking for autographs or photos. The fact that the ballpark is full of families celebrating mostly just means more kids, which is usually more fun and less awkward than adults, anyway.
The suit registers Steve’s grip tightening as they pick up speed, and Tony tells himself firmly that he’s not upset that he can’t actually feel it. He has plenty of opportunities these days to appreciate being pressed up against Steve, feel the warmth of him seeping between them. He doesn’t need this, too, just because Steve looks genuinely thrilled to be clinging to Tony for once, clearly enjoying the way the wind whips past them as they streak through the air above the city. It’s maybe a little inappropriate how much Tony has been appreciating all of the other times they’ve been pushed together, and it’s possible he’s taken more advantage than he should of the constant media presence to tuck in close, or steal a quick kiss or two. But Steve Rogers is a thing of beauty, and as much as he can still get under Tony’s skin, Tony has come to the sinking realization that he truly enjoys spending time with the man, that he likes his sense of humor, and that he honestly wants to learn more about him, hear all the bits and pieces of stories he’s willing to share, and more. It should probably make him feel guiltier than it does, but then he’d have to admit that his definitely-just-a-crush might be a tiny bit out of hand, and he couldn’t handle facing either Pepper or Rhodey if that happened.
“He got better,” Steve feels compelled to remind him.
“Yes, ma’am,” he says, figures that’s safest.
Settling in against the bar, Steve orders Tony’s drink and resolves to be a better husband, even if the thought of being someone’s husband still feels like a pair of boots he hasn’t broken in yet. He gives in to the impulse and touches his fingertips to his lips. If he stops looking at it as a punishment, or something he just has to grit his teeth and endure, maybe they could even enjoy themselves.
The view and the early morning sunshine that streams in when he pulls back one of the curtains go a long way towards making him feel better. It’s hard to hate the world when it looks so incredible.
Tony blinks. That’s really not what he was expecting. “I’m glad?” it comes out as more of a question than Tony meant.
“Jesus Christ, Tony.” Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s spine, comes to rest where the dip of his waist hits the swell of his ass, and Tony shivers, thinks about pushing back into the touch, but twists back around instead. Steve’s eyes go dark as he tracks Tony’s movement, only the tiniest sliver of blue still visible around blown pupils.
The washcloth is warm, and Tony lets Steve clean him up, thinks maybe he should protest, but all the stress from earlier was exhausting, and orgasms make him sleepy. “Stay,” he says, catches at Steve’s wrist when he goes to move away. He maybe shouldn’t ask for this, but his filters are low, and he doesn’t want to sleep alone. Not now.
Tony grins. “She sounds like a classy lady.”
“Consider it done,” Jarvis says.
Steve tries on as vague a smile as he can manage, and nods, hoping he’s not agreeing to anything outrageous. He’s thought more than once that Tony’s testing him, or making fun of him, but lately he’s wondered if that’s just him being paranoid.
“So a marriage is more believable?” Steve’s not quite sure what to make of that. The logic seems right, but what they’re discussing
“We do,” Tony agrees slowly, like he’s waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Steve almost asks if something’s wrong, but Natasha is unlikely to share unless she wants to, and, really, the thought that he might be able to get away from the spotlight dance and whirl for a bit and do what he
Steve stiffens a little and frowns, then remembers that Thor hadn’t actually been present for either the initial meeting that had landed them in this mess, or the planning sessions they’d had afterwards. “I had thought someone would have told you, but this isn’t a real marriage,” Steve explains. “There have been issues with public approval, and Tony and I. Well. We haven’t always been the best at keeping our disagreements in our own kitchen.”
“You’re right,” Steve says, and Tony takes an actual step back in shock.
“On your eight,” Barton’s voice is exactly the sort of casual Tony’s come to associate with a steady stream of flying fatalities. “Ready for pickup.”
One of the elevators that accesses the private levels chimes softly as the doors slide open.
And then Tony’s pulling away, tipping out of the kiss with a rush of breath. There’s barely an inch of new space between them, but the air feels cold where Tony had been, and it’s enough to shake Steve out of it, just a little, remind him they’re in public, and they’re just trying to put on a show. It doesn’t feel like a show, though. Not with Tony still locked in his arms, hair wild and lips beestung, pupils dilated so much his eyes look black, even at this distance.
Steve manages not to jerk back in surprise, but it’s a near thing. His hand comes up, palm catching on Tony’s shoulder, and it might be to hold him still or push him back, Steve doesn’t even know himself, but Tony’s already pulling away, settling back down onto his feet, slightly smug smile making his lips curl. Steve, still a little thrown, realizes Tony had gone up on his toes to reach him, and finds himself smiling back.
“This isn’t so bad,” Steve says, gestures slightly between them.
“Did you sneak into hockey games, too?” Tony wants to know.
Steve glances down at himself, realizes he’s still in running clothes, and feels abruptly awkward. “That might be a good idea,” he agrees, thinks he should probably shower, as well. When he looks up, Tony’s watching him, but he turns away almost immediately. Steve frowns, opens his mouth to ask, but Tony speaks before Steve can get the words out.
Tony’s eyes have narrowed, and he takes a full step the other direction, closer into Steve’s space. “Did I, or did I not, just save your neck?”
There’s the sound of a brief squabble, out of which Barton’s “Shotgun on Cap’s bike!” comes through loud and clear.
“Banner clear.”
Steve tries not to scowl down at him and is only partly successful. “I’m
Tony stops at the doorway to Steve’s room, doesn’t follow him inside. “Jarvis will send you whatever we’ve got. Police reports are starting to come in, and SHIELD and Jarvis are crowdsourcing. I’ll meet you with Mr. and Mrs. Smith at the hangar.” He takes several steps backwards as Steve pulls the uniform out of a closet. “Only a couple minutes’ flight up to the Bronx, and we can get underground closer to the hold-up from there.”
Tony visibly relaxes. “It’s fine. Just caught up,” he waves his tablet a little, as if Steve might need the evidence, or an echo of Steve’s own gesture.
Tony thinks about moving, about sitting up again and trying to watch the end of the movie, or about getting off the couch and going to sleep in his bed, but it seems like too much effort. He’s tired, and Steve’s warm against him, and it’s somehow comfortable having Natasha’s legs on top of his. Figuring they’ll wake him when the movie is done, or if they’re uncomfortable, Tony closes his eyes again, and slips back into sleep.
of you, now, to make this work, and just because he’s Captain America doesn’t mean he’s infallible. So let me know if you need me, okay?”
Rhodey frowns at him. “And that’s what you’re hoping to get out of this? A lack of death?”
“Don’t let Nick hear you, or he’ll get an edict passed saying you’re not allowed out on anymore playdates,” Tony warned, and then they were too busy for Steve to come up with anything else for a while.
“What’s going on out there?” Steve demands, instantly picking up on the change, and appearing again in the doorway to peer out into the semi-dark tunnel.
ever share anything – but I’ve read the files. Stane mentored you, practically raised you, and then locked you out of your own company, and McPherson was a honeypot.”
Steve can feel the spot he kissed – warm, hot, almost, but not unpleasantly so – and he has to actively stop himself from putting his hand to his face to touch it. He sits back down a little more heavily than he’d intended, and winces at both the jolt up his spine and the creak the chair gives in protest.
“Yes,” Tony nods, and he’s still watching Steve like he’s not quite sure what to do in this situation – which must be a first, Steve thinks, maybe a little uncharitably – but is game to give it a go. “She gave the PR team a statement, it should be going out around now.”
. You might think you’ve got nothing besides being a soldier, right now, being Captain America, but you’ll figure it out. You’ve got friends and people who want to care about you if you’d just let them, and your whole damn life ahead of you, and you can do anything you want. But none of it will mean a damn thing if whatever I saw up there comes and we’re not ready for it. Bruce got it. He might not always like it,
There’s a huff of air over the comm, but Steve doesn’t argue. A moment later, he and Natasha jump lightly out of the train. Barton joins them after another few seconds, and Tony drops to the ground next to him. For a long moment, they all just look at each other in the dim lighting.
“Everything okay?” Ms. Potts asks over Steve’s shoulder, not quite in his space – not the way Tony is, and how did Steve not even realize how close Tony was standing to him? – but close enough that no one will overhear.
Steve’s fingers itch to check Tony’s skull for damage, but he’s pretty sure that wouldn’t go over so well. He stands up and puts his hands in his pockets. “We have a dinner reservation at eight,” he says. “We’re meant to be photographed, I believe.”
“Iron Man, report,” Steve doesn’t really sound like he expects much, and he’s clearly not pleased about it.
It feels a little like he’s taking advantage, but this whole thing has felt a little like he’s taking advantage, and Tony just. He’s
Tony feels his hand twitch instinctively to cover the arc reactor, and forcibly drops it back to his side, taps the screwdriver against his leg, instead. “That wasn’t a request for compliments, actually. That was. This is. Not a good idea, Steve.”
The soft hum of computer engines is the only sound in the shop for a long time.
For the fourth time in as many days, Steve jerks awake convinced something’s wrong. He settles almost immediately, but that doesn’t do much to make the experience less unpleasant. He gives himself a long minute to viciously and indiscriminately hate everything, then takes a deep breath and rolls out of bed, padding barefoot over to the windows.
For a long moment, Tony just watches him. It’s so rare to see Steve relaxed, Tony can’t help but want to drink in the sight, just a bit, the way he practically glows in the sunlight, comfortable and easy without the sharpness he usually carries in Tony’s presence. Steve’s shoulders are loose under the plaid flannel shirt he’s wearing, and while Pepper is right, the plaid really doesn’t do as much for him as, say, the workout clothes he wears that hug every line of his body, she’s also wrong, because it gives him a certain softness that’s appealing in an altogether different and less comfortable kind of way.
If Steve thinks about it, he’s fairly certain he’s reading too much into it. Or maybe he’s just being plain stupid. Tony hasn’t given him any indication he’d been starting things up again with Ms. Potts when they’d been pushed together for this show marriage, and it’s the kind of thing that would have been handy to throw in Steve’s face during a fight. Still. He makes a mental note to find out why they split up, hoping it’s a less complicated process than confirming they really
After what might be a few minutes, or might be hours, Tony manages to pry his fingers from Steve’s wrists, winces at the marks his nails have left, little red crescents in skin bleached white from the pressure. “Sorry,” he rasps, lightly touches a fingertip to one of the indents.
“Tired, Cap?” Tony slouches against the wall by the door, somehow managing to make it look like the wall’s sole purpose for existing is to support his weight, and it should be proud to do so.
“There’s a lot you don’t know,” Fury tells him, but it doesn’t sound like an answer. “Nice drawing.” Fury taps the sketchbook.
, doesn’t ask if he’ll still be thinking about it tomorrow, or the day after, just lets himself have this. He pulls Steve closer until he drops down onto his elbows, arches up to kiss him until everything goes out of his head except for
Rhodey snorts.
“What the actual fuck?” Clint demands over the comms, sounding startled. “Is this – are they done?”
Ms. Potts frowns. “I thought –” she turns to Natasha, who rolls her eyes.
And Tony’s out the door before Steve can say anything else, leaving Steve sitting on the edge of his bed with a handful of paperwork that says he can legally cheat on his husband, and no one will mind.
In the half-light of the kitchen, Steve looks pale and rumpled, sleep pants low on his hips and hair sticking up in several directions like he’d been tossing around against his pillows.
Steve’s smile widens to something that looks just as practiced as Tony’s. “Tony,” he nods, and waits until Tony has sat down before he sits again.
“Draw professionally?” Steve asks, looks like he’s considering for a long moment. “I don’t know,” he says finally. “I haven’t thought about it in years.” He smiles a little ruefully, and, “Well, decades,” he corrects himself. “Since before the war. Even when I was doing it for the war effort it was just to be doing something useful, it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing.”
