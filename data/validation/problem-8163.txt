“Hey, finally up?” she says, wiping her hands on a stained cloth.
Steve chuckles when he sees her grimace. “I wouldn't want to dirty any of your stuff, so…”
To Toni, delivered at 0:37: I’d say that’s unlikely, considering we’re in rather different business areas, but you have a friend who’s a mainstream rapper, so… I guess what they say is true: nothing is impossible [shrug emoji]
Her words are confirmed when Toni steps into the tastefully decorated room: Steve’s already there. He already is a handsome person, incontestably, but his degree of beauty only expands when Toni tears her eyes off his face to look down at his figure. He's dressed in a extremely tight-looking shirt, covered with a fake leather jacket. His jeans look splendid on his long legs. And Toni’s always had a weak spot for combat boots - she finds them terribly hot on men.
“We watched movies and ate delivery food.”
Steve grumbles after that comment, which furthermore proves Bucky’s point. Randomly, he blurts out:
“Showering as of now. I was planning on joining him, but heard the door open and close.” Natasha’s lips stretch into a large smirk. “Sooo… How’s Toni? Is she still a wonderful kisser?”
Toni looks up at him and bites her lower lip slowly and purposefully, before spinning on her heels. She catches his arms and leads them to rest on her stomach. He complies and holds her stiffly, still whilst dancing along the song. Steve bends his head down and experimentally licks and softly sinks his teeth on Toni’s earlobe before moving on to her neck. She reacts by grinding, hard, against his crotch.
Toni, still poised even with his unwavering attention on her, winks. “Like what you see?”
“Hey Natasha.” Steve pulls her into a hug when she's at arm's distance. “Where’s Buck?”
“Naaat?” a distant cry calls out. “Do you know where the clean towels are?”
From Toni, delivered at 16:39: dude you forgot your jacket
From Toni, delivered at 0:43: alright then
get to meet your girl?”
To Toni, delivered at 1:52: Oh, I’m sure about that
“Well I don't know ‘bout you, but I've looked at them often enough to notice the green in them.” Toni smirks when Steve blushes.
“Yeah, it would.” Toni stands up, followed by Steve. “My car is right there. I’m two friends a ride back, do you need one?”
“What about you?”
“Yeah? By ‘inclinations’, do you mean just about their preferences in drinks, food and the like, or do you seek to gratify them in other matters as well?”
Pepper starts moving out of the massive room and sweeps her fingers through the folder to ensure that everything crucial is there.
“That’s a distasteful way to bring out what you know is my favourite thing to eat! I know it’s a little greasy and unhealthy, but--”
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:37: Please don't share this spoiler with anybody else
Steve reaches down for his phone, which he dropped by accident on the asphalt when his hands started trembling uncontrollably. Maybe he’s having an anxiety attack, he’s had a few of those before, at big-time events where the whole world might as well have been watching him, thanks to the hundreds of cameras flashing everywhere. He inhales and exhales slowly, to calm himself, before opening the device. He’s planning on calling Bucky, the only person he can think of at the moment, but an unread message catches his eye.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:41: what are you doing?
“Nay, it happened the other way around. Steve tried to kiss the woman, but got turned down.”
The music stops abruptly. A few seconds later, Toni appears in front of him. The corners of her mouth lift when she sees him, and Steve can tell by his reflection on the panel that so did his.
To Toni, delivered at 0:49: I’m not sure. I’ll ask him next time I see him
To fave beefcake, delivered at 7:43: i see youre up as early as usual. have you gone on your morning run yet?
Steve is already one innuendo away from doing something regrettable, like pulling down his briefs.
After exchanging words that are unmistakably goodbyes, Cherry Red Dress turns around and heads towards the bar, accompanied by a handsome young man. Following a second look, Steve recognizes the man: it’s War Machine. He’s a relatively mainstream, but successful hip-hop artist. Also, obviously, ‘War Machine’ is his stage name; if Steve remembers correctly, his actual name is James Rhodes.
To Toni, delivered at 1:15: Ah, right. But I have to warn you first, if we just go around anywhere in New York, we will get swarmed by either paparazzi or fans
A loud gasp is heard, followed by a muffled scream.
From Natasha, delivered at 1:09: No, he left with Scott after we finished cleaning up.
She gulps of her remaining cold coffee and climbs upstairs. An ecstatic squeal comes out of her throat when she discerns two sandwiches on the counter. Pepper must be back from her meeting in DC.
“I didn’t think that, I was citing what you told me--”
“Do you want the short drive or the long drive home?” she asks with a challenging smile while chewing actively.
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 7:57: Are you there?
He lifts the device, turning it around in his hands to observe it from all angles and slides his fingers over the smooth, entirely black front screen. Steve sees his name engraved on the side of the phone.
“Last time you dated someone, you texted him all the damn time,” she remarks dryly.
As for the second image she received, the more she stares at it, the more she laughs. ‘I can't believe I accepted to model for them. I was really craving for attention.’ She saves it and texts Rhodey, with it attached to the message.
Steve, who was tired from the moment he stepped out of Bucky’s condo, agrees. She pulls him towards a more secluded part, away from the blaring speakers, where there are fancy metal chairs and sits down, offering a devastatingly endearing smile up at the blonde man. There are a few people babbling around them, but Toni and Steve care as much about those presences as they do about them.
She has a sarcastic, dry humour that is topped off by cheesy one-liners. She has a cocky surface to her personality, but isn’t really boastful, per say. Steve feels like if he dug deeper, he’d discover that it’s nothing but an armour that hides a marshmallow-soft heart.
Steve eyes down at his figure and scrutinizes his outfit. He loves to wear tight shirts and all, but it’s decidedly more cozy to sleep either shirtless or with a baggy top. However, his wax men’s jeans are, as promised by Natasha, still extraordinarily comfortable. Not that wearing that beats slumbering in boxers only, of course.
“I agree with Bucky. You deserved to win, it's impossible with the kind of fan base you possess that you didn't get voted the most in any of the categories.” Clint runs his face with both hands. “God, I hate those fake award shitshows.”
Not wanting to know what that “something” was, Steve ignores half of her text and decides to ask about how the after party is going.
“You know, I've always found the fact that you're the only one who always nudges me about my sanitary conditions ironic, considering that you're the one walking barefoot everywhere.”
“Oh, thank you. I’m happy that you appreciate them.”
“I don’t know. You’re smart and interpret people even better than Clinton here, but you’re most likely wrong on this one.” Clint rolled his eyes when he heard Steve call him by his full name.
“I heard about the car accident, years ago, you know.” Steve inhales. “I know it probably means nothing, but I’m sorry.”
Steve twines his fingers around her hand. “There are more people than I thought there’d be. Wouldn’t want to get lost,” he half-yells, gazing into Toni’s eyes, a smile hanging on his lips. Toni glimpses at his soft mouth before half-yelling back “sure,” knowing fully that it’s a pretext to hold hands. However, she doesn’t mind. At all.
“Good morning. It’s 9:31AM, the weather in New York City is 32 degrees with scattered clouds and a little wind,” a slightly robotic voice announces, at the same time the manually-tinted windows clear up to leave place for a sunny sky. “You have 9 unread messages on your personal phone and 2 unread messages on your business-only device.”
“You remembering that I don’t consume alcohol. I’m pretty sure that’s literally the first thing I told you when we met. The fact that you remember I have a fondness for lemonade is less shocking, though.”
Toni finally leans in and buries her nose into the crook of Steve's warm neck. She drags her arms to his chest, holding onto his shoulders and inhales deeply his amazing scent. She’d trade anything for a lifetime of just smelling his skin. Toni feels him shiver when she lets out a breath.
“Do you play the piano?” he asks when he notices the three-legged instrument, situated in a room west to the slim waterfall.
“Aw, don’t be dramatic. We’ve been standing here for roughly 5 minutes now and not a single soul bothered us. But to answer your demand,” Toni spins around and points a building on the other side of the street, “it’s right there.”
“Hey! I already gave you a glass, don't steal from me,” Steve exclaims, putting down his now empty plate, planning to tickle her. Before he can even put his hands on underarms, the liquid is gone in mere seconds.
From Toni, delivered at 0:21: im good, thanks for asking
Scalding water rolling off her skin, Toni thinks about Steve. She isn't the type to stress about dates and romantic relationships, so she doesn't. Instead, she closes her eyes and replays the best moments from the party in her mind.
This definitely caught Steve’s attention. His heart starts beating loudly and he's appalled by the idea that one of his best friends and the lady he has a crush on know each other, somehow.
“Hey, I was going to ask you if you wanted to dance? I know that song’s depressing as hell, but it’s perfect for a slow.”
“In Canada?” Steve frowns.
Toni smirks. “Maybe I was distracted by some other stuff.” She grazes Steve’s arm with the tip of her fingers, running them slowly from his shoulder to his elbow. Steve feels his skin shiver at the contact and glances at her hand, but his eyes soon flicker back to her face. His hands come up to her shoulder blades, before he slides them down and holds them on Toni’s hips, rubbing his thumbs in small circles.
“Thank you for the presentation, miss Stark,” the bodiless voice comes again.
Clint snorts and ruffles Nat’s hair. “You look more like the damn interrogator in those secret agents movies when you put on
From Toni, delivered at 1:11: yes it is
Steve proceeds to do as JARVIS said and arrives in a hallway. There's a framed image hung on the wall, and opposite to that wall is a panel made entirely of glass. He peeks into it and sees what is essentially an immense garage of some sort. There are three cars parked diagonally - one cobalt blue, one orange and one grey.
He hesitates between going to the bathroom first to take shower, question of being more presentable before joining her, and going right now. He settles on the latter; the breakfast would get cold after ten minutes of waiting.
Toni gulps down her mouthful and takes Steve's glass, washing down with his drink before he can stop her.
Steve looks at the hefty roman numeral clock hung on the wall behind the sofa. He becomes suddenly aware that Sam has been waiting for him for half an hour.
“And it was an excuse to see me in a towel.”
He stays near the elevator while thinking about what he should say back, his fingers frozen hovering above the screen and his eyes frozen on the racy selfie.
The chorus is playing, but it’s still relatively a very gentle and calm melody. They sway among everyone in the dance floor, Steve enjoying his partner’s touch on his shoulders.
After the four sandwiches are made and done, Steve glances at his phone, which shows that the time is 9:03.
Sam laughs on the other of the line. “What did you think it was for, though? You sounded like you thought I was in deadly danger.”
Steve gets up from his stool to serve himself a glass of water. He realizes randomly that he hasn't gone on his daily run, which normally happens early in the morning. Clint is on his Android, leaning his chin against his hand, his elbow supporting the weight. Steve decides to see if he has anything on his own device, and when he opens his Stark phone with his fingerprint, he sees three missed calls from Sam and the same amount of unread messages from Toni. Steve is still amazed at the recollection of how Toni synced his iPhone and his new phone in literally 10 seconds. All of the contacts, and even the message conversations, appeared swiftly.
(See the end of the chapter for
From Natasha, delivered at 1:05: Sex is best in the morning anyway. :)
“Ah, sucks.” She comes up on her tiptoes, tugging on the front of Steve's shirt, and they start kissing again, but this time it's more passionate. It makes Steve feel feverish and almost like he's high.
“Are you okay? Why are you still wearing your helmet?” She’s right next to him now.
“So, how did you get here without getting trailed by the paparazzi?”
“You see right through me,” Pepper humours her. “But really, I wasn’t exaggerating about the paperwork. You have a mountain of bills, contracts and letters.”
At first, Steve was going to dress up in a suit, believing that they were going to a gala of some sort. Upon seeing him with a tuxedo in hand, Sam hurried to correct Steve's wrong assumptions to specify that it is but a casual party in honour of Erik’s new modelling contracts with two huge magazine agencies: Glamour and ASOS.
Steve pulls out his phone and sees 3 messages, one from 2 hours ago and the two most recent ones from earlier.
“Didn't you have something with Sam?” Toni asks with a smirk.
“I’ll make you spaghetti for lunch. Well, that is if you have pasta and ingredients for the sauce.”
The phone unlocks at the command. Steve stares at her in awe, before returning to the device.
“It’ll be 500$ for both, then.”
She’s walking toward him with a grin, so sure that the man in the white t-shirt riding a motorbike is none other than Steve, despite his face not even being visible. He swallows and judges it best to leave his helmet on for the moment, in case Toni suddenly thinks, 'Oh, maybe I've mistaken that person for Steve' and leaves. That doesn't happen, of course.
Steve wasn’t even surprised. It was typical of Natasha to think 3 steps ahead and not taking risks for nothing.
There are no more than a third of the amount of workers on the job during the day who are present at night, so a great deal of the lights in the public spaces are closed, even though the tower runs on self-sustainable and clean energy.
Bucky grumbles but shuts up, pulling Natasha fiercely against his chest and kissing her on the head.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:55: Okay, hold on
They peel off from the sensitive subject when Steve tells Toni about how he used to weight 45kg at the age of 16, and she says “No waaay! Really?” with a bewildered laugh. Steve did have a very defining shift caused by his (late) puberty.
“You believe in Jesus?”
Steve scoffs. “‘Not far from here’ was an understatement. It’s literally ten seconds away. All right, let’s go.” He grabs Toni’s hand and drags her with him, approaching promptly the edifice with a sizable neon sign displayed on the front.
To Toni, delivered at 1:18: As for the time, unless you had that planned too, is 7:00 good?
“By the way,” Charles continues, “there are still one mic left for any other joiner!”
Steve looks at her with an abashed look, colour filling his cheeks. He finally finds what he's been looking for and takes out her phone. “Hey, I’ve never seen this model before. Is it… an Android?”
He doesn't remember right away why his phone is on silent mode, and is a little taken aback at the fact that it is. He's the type of person who hates replying late to his texts unless there’s something important that needs his immediate attention, so he never mutes his phone. After a dozens seconds of digging, a memory comes up.
In lieu of a reply, Steve simply takes it off, showing an bright but artificial smile. Toni mirrors it, and raises her hand towards Steve’s head, rustling his hair.
“Sounds fun,” Toni comments sarcastically. She plays with a strand of her iron curled hair. “I’m lucky: they can’t do that to me because I have 3 real estates and they never know which one I’m at. Sorry, if it sounds like I’m bragging.”
“I’ll be sure to ask.” Steve pats Clint’s shoulder, then pulls Bucky into a brief one-armed hug and does the same for Natasha. “We’re playing Mario Kart, I hope?” It’s their favourite activity to do when the four of them are together, because they are all individually so competitive that they scream at each other throughout the whole time. Said like that, it sounds… intense, but in reality, it’s probably one of the things Steve like to do the most in the world. It’s like they’re in a real situation of life-or-death, and nothing is more gratifying than laughing maniacally while someone’s pleading mercy for dear life, before pressing the button that sends out the blue shell.
So he does. He leans his head down, closing slowly the gap between their faces while maintaining eye contact, and he’s few centimeters from her lips-
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 20:49: Wanna know if my character keeps his beard?
Steve scoffs and abruptly straightens himself up, their faces now close enough to kiss. He takes off his t-shirt with one hand and throws it away. Before Toni can even react, he attacks her neck, biting harshly and licking several spots. Toni shivers and tilts her head so he can have better exposure. Steve's hands are low, holding her ass, and he lowers both of them carefully, him on top now.
To Toni, delivered at 1:52: But seriously, it’s 2AM and we both need sleep, you chiefly
“The blue shirt highlights your eyes. And you should roll up your sleeves, Rogers; girls love that a lot more than you’d expect,” she informed him with a smirk. Steve executed what he was told with a raise of his eyebrows.
She lets her car park itself and hurries out of it, heading briskly to the restaurant.
Peter was too nice to tell them off, so Toni took the matter into her own hands and hired a PI named Jessica Jones. Every one of the bullies had a dirty secret - drugs, nudes from someone who didn't consent, nudes from someone who did consent but is a minor - that got them expelled. Toni felt like she just thoroughly cleaned a bowl of toilet that had years of dirt and bacteria sticked on it.
Steve forces himself not to look as disappointed as he feels, taking into account that he really wished she brought with her what he came here for, so he could just disappear as fast as possible.
What happened was rather meaningless: they were in the process of selecting a movie to watch when Sam called. It was about one in the morning, but he and Sam call each other often enough at odd hours that he didn't think it'd be any urgency, and Toni coaxed him into muting the phone, claiming he'll definitely call again and disturb them. Steve still tried to convince her Sam won't, but minutes after he did, Sam called him again. Steve recalls her triumphant smile, but thankfully she didn't bother saying ‘told you so.’
“I was lingering for 15 minutes in the entryway of the Tower. You should’ve told me you wanted me to join you outside. Unless you just got here?”
“It feels this nice?” Steve asks, an amused smile slipping out.
Toni nearly drops her propane torch when a remarkably loud ‘ding’ pierces through the relative quiet of her lab. She plugged her Stark phone some time ago - yesterday morning? Yesterday night? Two days back? - to the wall speakers so she could put her favourite Black Sabbath album on blast, but didn’t bother to reselect songs to play when all of Paranoid’s dynamic tracks eventually left place for silence.
Steve smiles at the three strangers. “Hey guys.”
he’s satisfying the alluring craving and want he had bottled inside him for a whole week. Toni bites his lower lip gently, then passes her tongue over it.
Toni chooses to stay in her mustard yellow pajama shorts and red tank top, before she steps out of her bedroom and goes looking for her two phones. “Where did I put them, Jarvis?”
Steve can't help but find her talking like that amusing, and his mouth twists upward. “You make it sound like you’re a psychologist soliciting their patient to recall traumatic events, or something like that.”
From fave beefcake, delivered at 0:39: Well, I’m going to sleep then
To fave beefcake, delivered at 7:44: thats awesome! is it another follow-up for that spies movie?
Steve receives the cup with the most ice cubes and takes a big gulp. “Thanks.” He looks at her, wondering why she kind of just skipped his previous question. She seems to have guessed what he was thinking about, because she bends down to sit on the stairs and pats next to her. Steve takes the invitation and does the same. She leans on his shoulder and cuddles closer. Steve wraps an arm around her
From Toni, delivered at 0:48: no, but i think ive vaguely heard of him..
Steve sighs. The name Stark did ring some bells. Their legacy was initiated by a businessman named Howard Stark, whom he knew a little bit and met once, years back from now, at a charity event. He knew Howard had a child, but didn't have the faintest idea that it was a daughter, and even less that she was this young.
To Toni, delivered at 1:42: You are one of the most successful women to have ever lived, but you don’t even have a regular sleep schedule??
“Ah, right. Almost forgot.” Toni trots to the living room. “Perhaps I was mistaken by the buzz that all the ingested lemonade caused,” she winks at him, “but you seemed to be really awed at my phone’s technologies the first time you saw it, at Charles and Erik’s party. So, I made you a personalized one.”
Steve isn't convinced, so he pushes. “What’s up? Don't say it's nothing.” It's now clear that he didn't get kidnapped or anything, but there has to be a reason why he called five times in the last 24 hours. Did his Instagram get hacked? Sam is still a small actor and doesn't have many social media followers - the most he had was 50k on Twitter, at lest during the last time Steve checked - , so he never bothered to get his accounts verified. Unfortunately, that makes them easier targets to hack into.
From Toni, delivered at 1:12: shame on you and all your ancestors
He doesn’t realize he was feeling a tad bit of annoyance/jealousy, until he breathes out a sigh of relief at the sight of Rhodes kisses another woman, who was waiting for him at the bar. He looks at the familiar face of Rhodes’ lover. Extremely short, straight blonde hair and a face with sharp features? It’s Carol Danvers, an actress whose popularity blew up after starring as the main character of some superhero movie.
“Nah, don't apologize for your fans. It's better to have the public bothering you for pictures and cuddles than mocking you, believe me.” Toni sighs. “Okay, that was a no-brainer.” She imitates a deep voice and mocks herself: “no shit it's better to have fans than haters!”
After his ninth conversation (or more accurately, his ninth small-talk), he glanced at the nearest clock and heaved out a heavy sigh. It had been only 40 minutes since he stepped into this place. Disappointed, but not surprised.
Clint is, unlike most of Bucky’s friends, a rather average person. He isn’t famous or wealthy. Bucky and Natasha, together, paid for the finest hearing aids that were obtainable, which obviously happened to be the most expensive as well. Now that Steve thinks about it, he realizes with consternation that the words ‘Stark’ were printed on both the box and the device.
God seems to have clemency on him, because none of those happen. Steve straddles his motorcycle after putting on the black helmet and flees easily to his house.
Steve turns around all of a sudden and Toni, who was previously looking at everything surrounding her, save in front of her, bumps into him with a yelp. He keeps her from pulling back by holding her body flush against his, using a hand to press on the small of her back. He starts moving to the beat.
To Toni, delivered at 1:44: You know, I actually am a senior citizen. Couldn’t you tell?
The third message turns out to be a picture. Steve taps on it so that image expands, and there she is, wearing said jacket. It’s a selfie, and although only one third of her body is seen in it, Steve finds it impossibly sublime on her, even if it’s visibly a couple of sizes too big. He feels an inexplicable rush of possessive satisfaction at the sight, as if Toni wearing Steve’s clothing makes her his.
He opens Toni’s purse, not without asking for her permission first, and fumbles with one hand, the other still holding his halfway empty glass. Toni shakes her head and takes custody of his drink, smiling a little. “What are you looking for anyways? Do you need a tampon or something?”
“My house has those really high fences with a gate, you know? Those… bothersome freelancers are always parked at that entrance, so I simply went out from my backyard where there’s literally a door conceived for me to go out without having to go through them. I can only use my motorcycle when I do that, but it’s not an issue and even provides me a headpiece in which I can hide my face.”
To Toni, delivered at 1:29: By the way, how do you and Natasha know each other?
“Do I need to force you to shower and sleep, in addition to being your feeding grandma, or is that role enough?”
From Natasha, delivered at 0:30: STEVE.
“Where’s Nat? Don’t tell me you abandoned your dame for Scott,” Steve jokes, faking an scolding tone. “That is very not gentleman-y of you.”
“So, I thought that it would be pretty practical for us to have each other’s numbers.” He adds his number to her contacts and passes her phone back.
“Rhodey had an accident, and at the hospital, when Stephen and the other doctor came to explain what was wrong--”
“Sure, go ahead. Pop one up for me too.”
To Toni, delivered at 1:35: We worked on the same set for a thriller movie about secret agents. There was a sequel. I remember we became friends rather quickly. She was constantly trying to find me a girl to date
Steve, having channeled all the confidence he could, joins the two women with what he hopes is a charming smile on his face. With the three men on his left making a poor effort in looking like they’re just minding their own business and staring ‘casually’ in Steve’s direction, pretending they're admiring the decorations, Steve gets a little more nervous. He knows that Antonia is not buying their act and probably judging them internally.
Steve shrugs off his jacket and covers the most he can manage of Toni’s upper body. He rests his chin on her head but keeps making his attempts at warming her with his arms. Toni shoves her face onto Steve's chest, her forehead pressed against the juncture of his collarbone and his shoulder.
Steve came with Sam, Natasha and Bucky after getting ready at Bucky’s place.
From Toni, delivered at 0:22: what???????????? you two know each other?????????
A dozen people start screaming 'Me!' and rushing to the stage, all wanting to be first and get the mic. None of them beats Peter Quill at it.
Toni separates herself from Steve far enough so that they can see each other's face with having to strain to not cross eyes. Her mouth twitches before she lets out a laugh.
From Toni, delivered at 0:49: is he friends with a girl called janet van dyne
“Then be a good kid and wash up. Your hair looks like it was drenched in Chinese food.”
Steve shouldn’t be surprised by Toni’s thoughtfulness, but he still is. Then again, maybe it’s mainly for herself; she is reknown too, just by a different type of public.
“Are you- are you okay?” Steve asks, worry colouring his voice. Sam sounds like he's either drunk or… drugged.
Steve hears Bucky coming down the stairs, oblivious to the fact that he currently has self-invited company in the apartment. Natasha winces, not wanting them to catch his boyfriend in his birthday suit, which would've let to an awkward and embarrassing situation. “James, wait in the bedroom! Clint and Steve are here!” she shouts, before excusing herself. Steve hears Bucky’s footsteps come to a stop at her words and he senses a moment of hesitance, - presumably Bucky trying to figure out why the two of them are here at the same time, ignoring that it's just a coincidence - then the sound of the stairs creaking reaches his earshot.
“My condolences.” She halts for an instant, taking a sip of the apple juice. "Do you have any siblings?”
“That's intense. You are, as a matter of fact, more like the characters in my own movies than I am.” Steve allows himself a smile when his comment makes Toni chuckle.
In lack of response, she pouts, which makes Steve stare at her, exasperated. Unfortunately for Toni, Steve is as much of a headstrong person as she is, but she looks too dear, even when she’s all sulky, so he proposes to compromise. “Half-half?” Toni capitulates.
She should listen to Pepper and find a way to put up windows. But again, would that really adjust anything about her fucked-up sleeping habits?
put on your shirt, though.” She smirks as Steve slides his hands from her waist down to her hips, then even lower, cupping her ass.
The current group she’s conversing with are laughing, what, every 10 seconds? Steve sneers. Are they trying to gratify her or is what she says genuinely hilarious?
“Never give up, man.” The taller man pats Steve’s shoulder, his lips pursed in a taut line. “Anyhow. Coffee?” He lifts up the coffee pot in clear invitation.
Peter can totally afford his own private chauffeur now, but he likes to text and phone Happy, so he sticks with him for emergency trips and big events.
At that, Steve’s heart sinks, because it was the opposite situation that took place. He mimics Clint by plopping down on a seat, feeling gloomy. Fortunately, he didn’t have to voice anything out loud, because Clint scanned him faster.
“Can I hug you, please?”
God knows how he managed to stay on the list of top 100 most successful actors anyway, instead of getting swiped away by the wave of new hit actors. He’s grateful for it, of course, and makes sure he communicates his thanks during the rare times he says his prayers.
Steve breaks first and leans down, pressing his lips against Toni’s. Her hands fly up to his face in an instant, holding his jaw firmly. He groans faintly, because finally,
Toni knows it’s a bit hardcore for a first date, but the nightclub is extremely near and she doesn’t want for them to part just yet. As a matter of fact, she would have requested to simply stroll around the streets, if Steve wasn’t one of the most recognizable actors worldwide.
From Toni, delivered at 0:46: we became friends and went out together a few rare times
To Hogan, delivered at 9:59: You can cancel your appointment with me. I’ll drive my Audi.
Steve tugs the device into his jeans’ back pocket and goes back to the kitchen, where his friends are discussing about a topic with animosity. He interrupts them to ask what they're chatting about.
“I’m afraid not, sir.”
“Geez, that was fantastic.”
. Steve smiles and decides he’ll bring the jar with the least baked goods in it, deducing that that must be her preferred type of cookie.
Steve’s nonplussed, having absolutely no clue as to why Toni is so suddenly acting like this, and is almost as freaked out as he’s aroused. He can feel his face heat up from bashfulness, too, and his heart is thrumming loudly. The elevator dings and an old man in a tuxedo enters it, not waiting for the still-there occupant to get out first. Steve clears his throat to try to clear his mind and steps out. He doesn’t know how to react, what to reply, but he doesn’t want to leave it on read: Toni might take his lack of an answer as him being repulsed by her. Well, he knows she wouldn’t think that, but he doesn’t want to risk it.
“Yeah, I’m doubtless that there's a high-ranking piece of shit in Stark Industries who's selling weapons from under the administration. I have my suspicions on who, but no proof.”
Steve, incredulous, stays silent for a moment.
To Toni, delivered at 1:39: I guess I should stop keeping you from resting, then. You need your sleep (:
“Sir, please use the stairs that go down, they will lead you to Miss’ workshop.”
To Toni, delivered at 1:26: Did you just call their CEO to arrange that time?
From Toni, delivered at 0:30: by the way, i just texted her because??i’m shocked??
“Bonsoir, oui. C’est au nom de, uh, Antonia Stark, réservé à 7 heures,” she somehow gets out with a heavy accent.
“Do you wanna stay for a little while? I can make some coffee,” Toni asks, staring at Steve like she can sense something’s off.
Toni remembers that was the first time she used wax to remove hair from her body. It was a painful experience, but hey, even she had to admit that her folded legs looked very nice in the picture. They also looked unnaturally shiny - photoshop, definitely.
There are two more photos, damning and separated from the rest, as if to prevent contagion. Leonard Samson and Helen Cho, two more great intellectuals, ornaments in their chosen fields-- psychology and endocrinology respectively-- greatly mourned by friends and loved ones. Having vanished before anyone connected the incidents, they are the only two victims ever recovered. Some mercy, that-- so small it can dance with the angels on the head of a pin. Both were found between six and eight weeks following their disappearances, laid out in an area of atypically high magnetic activity and radiation fluctuation, within ten miles of their last known location. Each was missing some odd item of clothing-- socks gone while shoes were present, bra missing while the shirt was still in place. To make matters worse, their autopsies were as identical as they were bizarre: each dead only a few days, bodies frozen solid in defiance of logic and weather. More baffling still, all natural fluids-- including the vitreous-- had been drained. What little moisture medical examiners did find existed on the cellular level, accompanied by minute traces of a colorless and unidentifiable 'gel' in the lungs and/or stomach cavity.
Hardly an ideal omega trait-- Steve recognizes that, but can't and won't apologize for it. He is who he has always been. A few days of sound mating and biological reclassification aren't going to change that. "I don't have any training," he remarks after a beat, deciding to let the bald facts speak for themselves. "I thought I was a beta and, even if I hadn't, it's not as though Brook's Village has a legion of etiquette instructors."
Of course, he is now his alpha's ward, legally vouchsafed to Stark's mercy. There may yet be retribution.
A little solidity really wouldn't go amiss right now.
He's no one's pet or plaything, to be moved about with no regard for his own will.
He does not accept this-- he
Though the Captain had given no great outward sign of distress, Fury had dismissed him after the official SHIELD review exceeded a dozen replays of the footage. There'd been bile in Steve's throat then, the old insistence that he could take anything the world threw at him, conquered for the first time by an icy wave of loss. Grief was cold, the howling of winds along steel trestles and amongst embers that, while snuffed and dying, still smelled of human flesh. Arctic waves that broke through every barrier, stealing breath and time.
Tony blinks rapidly, the emotions all rushing up at once. There’s a mix of overwhelming awe with a healthy dose of disbelief and then the painful thought that outside of Jarvis, Pepper and Rhodey, no one else has ever cared this much if he eats or not.
“It’s really not the mirror,” Tony says, an edge creeping into his voice. “Just drop it, please. I’m tired.”
to let them even order food to be delivered to the front lobby. Tony stares up at Steve incredulously and that smug little grin curves up even wider as his ridiculous baby blues shine with a mischievous glint.
“I think you should talk to him, Tones,” Rhodey says after a beat of silence.
Tony laughs. “Me torturing you would be letting you know I’m wearing these
“I’ll give him another chance to redeem himself.”
, Steve twisting his body to cushion Tony's fall. There's hardly a pause in the kiss as they land, Tony seating himself atop Steve's thighs while long fingers dip beneath the hem of his hoodie and deftly relieve him of his pants and underwear.
Tony had expected Steve to try to get him to go to bed, insist he needs some rest, but he's inordinately grateful that Steve doesn't. “You don't have to do that,” he says, his voice suddenly hoarse.
“Yes yes
“We’re just chopped liver,” Bucky mutters from behind them.
The edge in Rhodey's voice all but screams that under no circumstances is Tony supposed to throw all of his hard work away, but how the fuck is he going to survive without his best friend? They grew up together, thick as thieves since they met in elementary school and now Rhodey is leaving and everyone is growing up and things are changing and nothing will be the same ever again.
Steve pauses and turns away. “What happened in Siberia wasn’t a choice either,” he says quietly. “It was never a choice between you and Bucky. It was stopping you before you did something you might regret later, and keeping you from killing him.”
“But that never stopped you from doing what's right,” Tony says trying to keep his voice as gentle as possible. He sits up slightly and regrets the decision immediately when the furnace warmth of Steve's body dissipates but he doesn't have the excuse of dozing anymore to press close again.
He sighs, rubs his forehead in a futile attempt to clear the memory and
“Pepper has a little one to take care of,” Rhodey finally replies after a long heavy silence.
,” she replies without an ounce of irony, but Tony knows better.
Did Tony do something especially offensive last week? He hasn't a clue and his brain, something that's usually pretty reliable is failing him now and he has no idea what's going on and Loki looks like he's ramping up to say something big—
Steve nods as though gathering himself. “What you saw in the hallway—with Peggy, that was not anything, I swear.”
“I’m a very magnanimous person,” Tony says archly.
On the fifth day, he skype calls Rhodey and tells him everything. Rhodey is the only one he can stomach talking to, because Rhodey isn’t physically there. Tony can hold himself together a little better when he’s only staring at a screen and a lagging image of his best friend. He can pretend he’s just telling an interesting anecdote and distance himself from the pain for a few minutes.
“We broke up a few weeks ago and we’re just friends now,” Steve continues. His voice is sad and regretful and the lost expression on his face twists painfully at Tony's heart. He obviously cares a lot for Peggy. “But of course, I'm not going to get between this thing you have with Pepper.”
Tony's mental spiral screeches to a halt when Pepper sits down in front of him and places a venti americano with three extra shots on the table. She arches a brow as she looks at him, her face expressionless and pushes the cup forward.
dating for months, and neither of us were smart enough to just say it outright? Fucking stupid. So stupid.”
All he can think is,
Until he remembers one of the letters were addressed to Pepper, and he remembers Rhodey and Pepper’s lingering touches and
“A nonagenarian,” Steve repeats with a sharp calculative gleam in his eyes. The gleam automatically triggers fight or flight in Tony, and he has to fight to tamp down the rush of desire that floods his belly when he stares back at that laser-focused look.
“I, um, saw that the Museum of Natural History has this new special exhibit on space exploration,” Steve says, still not quite looking at Tony. “I saw it on their website and it made me think of you—I mean, it seems like something you might like. So uh, you know, if you want to go—“
Tony laughs again, the sound even uglier this time. “I know you're trying to make me feel better, but it's not really working. No one really loves me, J. I've accepted that.”
The look is always sad and forlorn and slightly accusatory all at once, as though there’s some vitriol on the tip of his tongue but Steve can’t get himself to vocalize the words, before it fades into a shuttered mask of practiced blankness. Tony doesn’t know what Steve's fucking problem is, but if he's not going to say whatever it is he wants to say to his face, Tony doesn't care. He
twenty times and the entire
. The word hurts like a blow and Tony wants to shake his head, he’s not he’s not. It breaks him to hear Steve say these things and it kills him to wonder if he means them. He can barely stand the breathlessness he hears in Steve's voice as he fucks into him, heart aching with the way Steve says his name. He
“Another time,” Steve says. “You need to sleep.” He cuddles closer and winds an arm around Tony's waist holding him snug.
“Fine,” Tony concedes and adds it to the document. “Are we happy, Rogers? Yes? Okay, hooray.”
“We'll be okay,” Steve says after a slight pause. There’s an edge of determination in his voice, and Tony thinks that’s probably good if they hope to get out of this farce alive. He can only imagine the fallout if it ever gets out that this relationship is fake. He doesn’t think he would survive the humiliation and his friends’ reactions, and that's before Howard gets his hands on him.
“His favorite writer is Tolkien,” Bucky says. “The giant dork read
That was when the first fist flew. Before Tony had even realized what was happening, someone was stepping in front of him to block the punch. It was Steve, then scrawny sickly thin Steve Rogers from second period English, had saved Tony from a sure beating, taken it himself and later that day, Tony taped up his bleeding cuts in the fourth floor boys bathroom. They never spoke of the event again, not even during the endless hours of detention they served together.
So Tony tells him. He tells Steve about the new missile the Department of Defense contracted Stark Industries to build with a backup repulsor wave that has the power to decimate an entire city block after its initial blast. He tells him about the new combat aircrafts they're trying to develop with flat turbines in the wings capable of advanced stealth and capacity for more weaponry. He tells him he's on the brink of real artificial intelligence, and if he succeeds, it'll change war forever.
Steve hums, a deep bass rumble Tony feels against his spine. The vibrations travel along his shoulders until he feels as if he’s tingling all over. He doesn't resist when Steve turns him with gentle hands on his shoulders but when Steve presses a kiss to his forehead, Tony freezes, not expecting it. He melts slowly when Steve's lips linger against his skin, fingertips branding hot where they rest at the nape of Tony's neck.
“Does Loki know?” he finally manages to ask.
“And,” he continues before Steve can answer, sliding his phone across the table and tapping the screen to wake it up, “we’re trending on Twitter. It’s humiliating for both of us now if we don’t do this. The whole school already knows. The whole goddamn city knows. We can pretend to date for a few weeks, maybe a few months max, and then we amicably break up and everything will blow over. I get to keep my friends without fucking things up and you get Peggy back.”
“But,” Rhodey continues as Steve laughs, “it
Tony instinctively rolls closer to Steve. “G’morning, love,” he murmurs, still half asleep.
The gravity of the day settles in Tony's stomach sometime around seven in the evening, minutes before everything is set to begin. He’s standing in front of the mirror, tugging at the cuffs of his sleeves and adjusting his collar. He twists his cufflinks for the fiftieth time, and makes one last attempt to smooth down the little flyaways around his hairline. He takes another cursory look at his reflection, critically cataloguing his appearance.
As he's about to leave the kitchen, Jarvis touches his wrist. “Do remember to come up for dinner, Anthony,” he says gently. “You don't eat nearly enough. Mister Rogers and myself as well as your friends worry for you.”
Tony swallows. “Hello to you too, dad,” he says pitching his voice with false cheer and backing it with every ounce of bravado he can muster. “How am I, your only and most dearest favoritest son? I’m doing great, dad, thanks for asking. Haven’t seen you in nearly two months so you probably missed the memo that I’m on my senior trip. I’ll be back in two days.”
,” Tony babbles against his husband’s lips, unsure of what he’s begging for anymore.
Tony settles himself into one of the lounge chairs with his coffee by the edge of the pool to watch. The linen towel lining the bench is already warm from the morning sun shining overhead. He lays down comfortably on his back with a soft sigh, cradling his cup in his hands and trains his gaze on the water. He settles in to work on his tan and waits for Steve to notice him.
“I just can't get enough of you,” Steve murmurs against his skin, and they end up arriving very late to the pool party.
Steve ignores Tony’s demands until he feels his husband is ready, never wanting to hurt him. Tony is near begging by the time Steve withdraws his fingers and slicks up his own cock. He pulls Tony in for another deep kiss as he presses his cock in, pushing slowly through the first tight rings of resistance and sliding home to slick gripping heat.
The second reprimand from Howard comes from abroad. He somehow still manages to find the time to scold Tony even when he's fucked off halfway across the world “in an important conference.”
“That’s not what the letter says.”
“People like us,” Janet says on the first night, “will never fit in with people like them.” She waves a hand at the rest of the circle. “It's not about money. We're all at camp rich kids. It's about how we think. We
Steve presses a quiet and intimate, “I love you so much,” to Tony’s lips for his ears alone, and Tony whispers the words back, his voice thick with tears as he smiles. They’re
,” before diving back in.
“I love every part of you, sweetheart, so much,” Steve says, “but these are some of my favorites. Because this,” he begins, stroking tender fingertips along the crows feet at Tony’s eyes, “is love and laughter. I want you to be happy always, beloved, and I never want you to know another day of pain.”
“Went to my first comic con because of Steve,” Sam says, ignoring Steve. “I think that was what? Two summers ago?”
“Jesus fucking—” Tony really has to talk to Jarvis about being so soft hearted and letting just anyone into his lab like this, it's not safe, it's a breach of security. He’s changing all of his locks and codes and passwords, but first he needs to get out of here. Preferably before he throws up and has another breakdown. “There's nothing to talk about.”
Tony is swimming in the jacket as he settles into his seat next to his friends now, the seam of the shoulders falling halfway down his biceps and the hem of the bright blue edge dropping down to his thighs. He tugs the sleeves over his palms, reveling in the way the leather and wool surrounds him, snuggling deep in its proffered warmth as he presses close to Pepper beside him.
“One more thing,” Steve says. “We go on the senior trip together.”
Tony doesn’t correct him that the search team had found him, Tony had nothing to do with it personally. He had spent his whole life resenting his father for caring more about finding a dead body in the ice than he did about his own son, but he doesn’t tell Steve this. He thinks Steve knows, if Tony can still read him as well as he once did.
Rhodey laughs as he catches him, pulling Tony in for a tight hug. Tony presses a smacking loud kiss to Rhodey’s cheek and says, “I missed you, platypus. Never leave me again. You're definitely not allowed back to MIT, they can’t have you. I'll buy the school this time if I have to, but you're not leaving me again.”
“Hey, sunshine,” Tony replies just as quietly, stroking his thumb along the line of Steve’s jaw. “Last chance to back out,” he says casually, even as his heart thuds.
Sarah's praise and the thought of Steve saying anything nice about him to his mom brings his blush forward and Tony knows his cheeks are flaming red by now. He just barely resists the urge to cover his face.
It's all his own damn fault for being so stupid and it's frankly pathetic that so much of his life has revolved around Steve. He's been in love with Steve twice, and an old adage comes to mind.
“This,” Steve says, brushing his hand down the red and gold peonies on his flesh arm, romance and prosperity, “is for us, our marriage. We beat the impossible odds and overcame everything to be together. We fought so hard for each other, my love, so I can hold you now.”
One night after his shower, Steve sees Tony frowning into the mirror as he’s getting ready for bed. Tony is standing in front of the glass dressed only in his sleep shorts. Steve watches him from across the room as Tony squints his eyes at his own reflection and drags frustrated fingers through his hair, mussing it into disarrayed tufts. He sees Tony heave a heavy sigh as he attempts to smooth down the greying sides again before pinching at the skin of his own belly, his mouth set in a deep frown.
Steve is watching him with reserved amusement. “What kind of boundaries?” he asks trepidatiously. “I’m obviously not going to push you to do anyth—”
pounds with every stutter of his heart.
If this is going to be his last time with Steve, Tony sure as hell is going to enjoy it. He certainly doesn’t have the strength to untangle himself from Steve’s arms to even begin unraveling himself from this mess.
“Fuck,” he breathes quietly to himself. This must be Steve's doing, it has to be, Steve playing dirty and bringing in the big guns, he fucking knows Pepper is probably the only one who can get him to quit early, but he hasn't spoken to Pepper in weeks, the guilt of the letters and the whole thing with Steve eating away at him along with the shit from Howard and he's been avoiding Pepper at school and Rhodey’s messages he's such a crappy friend why would they want to be his friend anymore Pepper isn't here to help she's here to yell at him it's what he deserves oh god this is going to be the end of two of his best friendships he's always fucking everything up—
“Pepper,” Tony sighs, as he inhales half of his coffee in four gulps. The bitter taste of life sustaining caffeine burns as it slides down his throat, but he’s immediately a little more awake. “Virginia. Pepper-up. Pepto Bismol. Moon of my life. My sun and stars. Have I told you how much I loved you today?”
It makes a certain warmth curl in Tony’s chest to hear Steve actually introduce him as his boyfriend, fake or not. It’s fucking ridiculous. “It’s nice to meet you, Ben,” Tony offers, a genuine smile curving his lips.
Oh fuck.
, Steve, I love you so much,” and that’s what finally pushes him over the edge.
Tony pauses. “That’s in February. Do you really think we have to put on this show for that long?”
“Yeah, sweetheart,” Steve says and Tony thinks he might be going into cardiac arrest, his heart is beating so fast. Steve pulls him in for another kiss and all higher thinking flies out the window. All he knows is the feeling of Steve's lips against his and the echo of
“Never better,” Tony lies, reaching for Steve. He reels him in for a kiss to stop any more forthcoming questions.
“So speak, Rogers. I don't have all day.”
“Tony?” the voice says again.
“Oh,” Tony says eloquently. “You meant right now. Like today. Like
He eagerly returns all the kisses Steve presses to his lips, hands trailing enthusiastically over every inch of skin offered to him. He arches shamelessly up against Steve every time, legs falling open to make a space for him. He fits there perfectly like he fits in Tony's life and mind and heart, Tony doesn't know if he could ever do this with anyone else when it's all over.
“You're incorrigible today,” Tony tells him. “Not that I'm complaining—” he breaks off with a gasp as Steve presses an open mouthed kiss to his neck. He nearly arches off the bed at the feeling of Steve's teeth against his pulse as his hand finds him expertly, finger stroking around his rim before pushing in.
Rhodey looks like he’s about to say something else when Captain Rhodes shuts the trunk of their van with a click that sounds of finality and Mama Rhodes walks over to pull Tony into a tight hug.
“You know I gotta give anyone you date the shovel talk,” Rhodey says. “It's part of my job as your best friend and big brother.”
“Why don't you just ask one of your other friends to do this, Tony?” Steve asks, sounding exasperated. “Wouldn't that be more believable?” He looks tired and slightly defeated and Tony can tell he's almost convinced. He's going to say yes.
“Gorgeous,” he hears Steve murmur.
They wake up in the late afternoon when Pepper knocks on their door to ask them to join everyone at the pool. Tony blinks the sleep from his eyes and stretches languidly, the cool cotton sheets a balm to his sleepwarmed skin. He relishes in the secret ache he finds in the dip of his spine as he arches his back, feeling sore in all the right places. He stretches his arms above his head to work out the kinks in his muscles before he sighs with satisfaction and sinks back against the pillows. Steve is awake and watching him with darkened eyes when he looks over.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty,” Steve says as he pads across the rug to rummage for clothes in one of the suitcases and Tony is struck by how domestic it feels. How comfortable, and
They find lethal amounts of diazepam and prozac in her blood, and the press somehow gets ahold of that information. On the Monday Tony returns to school, he’s hounded by journalists on the front steps shouting in his face, “I heard Maria Stark was found dead in her bathtub. Is that true?”
“Finish getting dressed,” Steve tosses over his shoulder as he turns to face the mirror. Tony watches him from the other side of the closet as Steve dresses, making no moves to finish getting ready.
“Okay,” Tony echoes and takes a deep wobbly breath. “I wrote these when I was young and stupid.” He pauses. “Young
The day ends with everyone gathered in the common room with a fire roaring in the hearth, the blaze big enough to warm the cavernous room. Snow is drifting down outside the windows again, pale moon reflected silver glimmering against the dark night sky.
The trip down the aisle feels like an eternity before Tony and Rhodey finally make it to where Steve is waiting. With another touch to Tony's elbow, Rhodey hands him off to Steve and moves to his position in front of them.
The only real part of any of it was Tony's foolishness and hubris, thinking it was ever a good idea to play Russian roulette with his heart. He rubs at his chest and sighs.
Tony has always been the brightest point of any room, but now on some days, he is quieter, blue hints of melancholy coloring his usual luminosity. He’s softer with his children and quieter with Steve. The loving affection is still there, but Tony‘s loud confidence appears hushed and suppressed, and Steve has begun to notice these quieter days are more and more frequent. Tony’s vibrance is dimming. This hushed energy is new.
“Oh? And how’s that?”
“Are you sure you're okay?” Steve asks again, ever intuitive. “You know—” he cuts off and swallows audibly before continuing. “You know you can tell me anything, right? If you want to. If it'll help.”
“Hey, what happened to ‘I can do this all day’?”
Peggy hums quietly and opens her hand to show him the pack of cigarettes between her fingers. “Bad habit,” she says. “I’ll be along in a bit. It was good talking to you, Tony.”
“Who?” Tony asks instead.
He heaves a great sigh and does the only thing he can think of to avoid the Pepper conversation. Just as she's rounding the corner, he reaches out and grabs the front of Steve's shirt with both hands and drags him forward. Steve yelps in surprise as Tony forcibly brings him closer. Before he can rethink it, or give it any thought at all, he's pulling Steve in and standing up on the tips of his toes and he's
Tony hesitates. “I don’t want it,” he finally replies as he leaves to go downstairs.
“Good man,” Rhodey says.
“Yeah, this is perfect,” he lies and closes the minuscule distance between them. He wants to pretend for a little longer.
Tony reads through the handful of letters his mother gives him, each one more loving than the last. He almost drops the sheaf of papers after the reading the first page, hit with the cold realization these words were written by Howard. Tony's brain short circuits, trying to reconcile the man in the letters with the cold, angry man who lives at the bottom of a bottle. He wants to give the papers back; he doesn't feel like he should be reading these.
“I just got here,” Rhodey says calmly. “Besides, you love me and miss me and you were a brat for not answering my calls and not telling me firsthand about Steve. By the way, Mama is cross with you too. She says you haven’t visited even once.”
Steve mouths something against his neck that Tony doesn't catch as he comes, filling him again wet and hot as his hand palms Tony’s cock, stroking him to completion. Steve stays inside him for a long time afterwards, breathing slowly against his neck. Tony curls his legs around Steve’s waist, unwilling to let him go as he draws lazy patterns on Steve's shoulder with his finger, loose looping hearts traced onto skin while his own beats a thrumming
“But I'm so close,” Tony repeats petulantly.
He barely notices the days passing, the hours smudging into one another, and he loses sense of time as the minutes tick past while he’s frantically trying to solve equations and calculate measurements. Every inch of his dry erase board and all of his monitors are filled from corner to corner with numbers.
The trains are often empty at night when Steve rides with Tony to take him home. Tony thinks it's silly for Steve to waste the time bringing him back uptown, but Steve always insists and Sarah insists alongside him. Tony is helpless against two Rogers.
“Not delicate!” Tony protests from where he's seated on the rug by Steve's feet, sorting through a pile of tangled garland. “Don't let the size fool you. I'm vicious and strong.”
“If you're good, maybe I'll let you,” Tony somehow manages to tease, and something dangerous and feral glints in Steve's eyes at his words.
“Nope,” Steve confirms. “She's probably going to be repeating this story even on our wedding day. Bucky is going to know soon too, I'm counting on it. I swear they exchange reports on me regularly. Ma probably tells Buck to keep an eye on me, like she thinks I deliberately get myself into trouble. Can you imagine?”
“And… Steve Rogers.”
“Thank you,” Steve breathes, and before Tony has any time to wonder why he is thanking him, Steve leans forward and closes his lips around the head of Tony's cock.
Their team wins, Tony thinks, but he isn't really sure in the end. There's talk of a party, and Loki is dying to go because Thor will be there, the other footballers will be there, the cheerleaders will be there, even the opposing team will be there.
Tony hums noncommittally and tightens his arms around Steve, dragging his nails lightly over the expanse of bare skin beneath his hands. “Don't want you to go,” he mumbles. “Too comfy to move. You're being a bad blanket right now.”
Tony had often thought of Janet, and how differently her careless rebellion had burned compared to Steve’s bright temerity as they sat for long hours after school in the small classroom, laughing with Steve as he doodled silly drawings for Tony’s amusement.
“Tony,” they hear at the end of the hallway before Tony can leave. “What is the meaning of this letter? Tony!”
“You can’t keep avoiding problems by kissing me,” Steve says, looking slightly dazed and his lips are pink swollen from the kiss.
“Wait, Tones—”
He's seen the new influx of tweets from his classmates and the snaps from acquaintances talking about him and Steve. He's seen how they all wonder why someone like Steve would ever trade the gorgeous cheerleading captain Peggy Carter for snobby rich nerd extraordinaire Tony Stark. Peggy and Steve were a match made in teen romcom heaven, and Tony is well,
Bruce sucks in a sharp inhale. His eyes become wild and panicked, darting from one corner of the room to the next. He doesn’t say anything for a long time, his eyes not quite meeting Tony’s as he chews on his bottom lip.
“You’re beautiful either way, darling,” Steve says, eyes soft.
Steve, bless him, doesn’t notice the turmoil Tony feels swirling tempestuous chaos in his mind. He smiles when he sees Tony, and Tony can’t help but smile back.
Tony thinks maybe Steve is going to see it on his face. He feels so vulnerable and cracked open when he's in Steve's arms like this, and he has to bite hard on his tongue to keep the words from slipping out. He's never wanted anything more in his life, and trust Tony to always want the things he can't have the most.
Steve’s eyes are bright and steady, and his expression is earnest and open. He actually means it.
Steve shrugs and says simply, “Just in case.”
“Not puny,” Tony corrects, slumping further against Loki. “Fun sized.” He wants nothing more than to stay in the lab and work on his robotics project. Sports are stupid and pointless.
Tony frowns. He realizes in that moment he’s never actually seen Steve’s room before despite the many times he’s been over at the Rogers house. They usually spend most of the time in the living room and then dinner in the kitchen before Tony goes home for the night. He wonders if the room is really as horribly messy as Steve claims, or if he’s hiding something. Like a Peggy shrine.
Steve's normally clear blue eyes are darkly intense as he trails long fingers up and down the sensitive skin of Tony’s ribs and skims over his sternum, tracing circles over his burning skin. Steve buries his face against Tony's clavicle as large hands span his chest. The pads of his fingers brush against the peaks of his nipples, and Tony groans, arching up into the touch.
“Why isn’t Pepper here?” Tony finally gathers the courage to ask Rhodey a week after he wakes up.
“It'll be fun, Tony,” Steve reassures him for the thousandth time.
“You're missing out,” Steve replies, taking his hand to coax him off the couch. The fort he made is cozy and dark, the light coming from the Christmas tree and candles just enough to allow them to see. Steve has arranged pillows and throws on the rug and Tony finds himself cushioned in blankets when Steve tugs him inside the space created by the strung up quilt.
Tony sighs, deflating and feeling lost all over again. He had wanted someone to be blindly anger on his behalf, but Rhodey, ever the voice of reason, had never been that person. It's more than he can bear at the moment.
He glances quickly at the notification and with suffocating dread, Tony opens his email to find another one of Howard's curt notes. “
Natasha shrugs again. “That was a dick move, Stark,” she says, and Tony knows Pepper would agree if she was here. He can't help but feel a little ganged up on. “Knowing you wouldn't apologize anytime soon, I did it for you. Also, I promised Loki you are going to buy him his favorite dessert and pay for dinner tonight.”
“I’m sorry for everything,” Steve says, insistent. “I’m sorry for what happened between us, and I’m sorry for not listening. About the invasion. About what was to come.”
greedy to have any part of Steve he is allowed.

Finally, Sam picks up and slurs out a barely comprehensible “What?”

They zigzag through the crowd and sink deeper into it, even though the dance floor really is everywhere. Near the busy bar, Toni spots a number of skilled strippers gracefully spinning around poles - that she bets are coated with bacteria - with men drinking alcohol gathered around their mini-stages.
“Alright, let's go.” Steve bypasses the couch and offers his two hands to lift Toni up. She grins brightly and seizes his arms. They gawk at each other for a few seconds, close enough to feel each other's breath, before Toni breaks the moment and walks toward the kitchen nonchalantly. Steve wonders for a split second if she's figured out he has feelings for her that are of a greater extent than a simple crush.
“Was fun, wasn't it?” Toni agrees, all sweaty. Her high ponytail is a mess. She passes a hand over her head, pulling back the two front strands she left out of the ponytail on purpose. “You are one confident dancer.” She pokes his chest with a finger.
A car in diagonal from them ‘beep-beeps’, then Steve notices she’s clutching her car keys. They enter the silver sports car, him in the passenger seat and her behind the wheel.
The thing is, it isn’t just her physicality and her pretty face. When you look at her, especially when she’s engaged in a conversation, you just see that she’s one of those confident, maybe borderline arrogant, but charming extroverts. When she talks, everyone in her entourage give 120% of their attention.
Steve pulls her chair out and pushes it back when Toni sits down, then does the same. He still hasn't erased the smile from his face, but Toni doubts hers faded either.

From Toni, delivered at 1:45: no, i couldnt tell under the mass of hotness and muscles you muster [heart eyes emoji] you could pass for a 20 years old
When they arrived at Charles’ mansion, they were greeted with a cup of champagne and a blast of deafeningly loud music.
A longer chapter to make up for the huge delay. Enjoy!
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 7:58: Are you ignoring me because I replied late
Steve wraps his fingers around her hand and surprises Toni by bringing it to his lips and leaving a chaste kiss on the back of her hand, instead of shaking it like she expected. He can imagine Sam and Bucky smirking at him and praising his whooing skills in his head. “It’ll be my pleasure to please you, Toni.”
Her cheeks dimples and she says innocently: “I don’t think anyone there would do something like that. The entrance prices is 500$ for women and 550$ for men. It’s basically filled with arrogant snobs.”
Steve wishes he could deduct things as accurately as Clint does, but he knows that Clint is more reading people like books than doing pure guesswork. But again, how does one gather from a person’s face the conclusion that said person ate what food while watching what movie genre?
Steve is a little taken aback, because he didn't expect the subject of the conversation to be about that.
Natasha stares at Steve, incredulous and pensive, before snapping her fingers. “Wait. I know why she did that: it’s surely because she’s trying to go slow with you.”
To Natasha, delivered at 1:08: That’s very nice, Natasha, but I don’t want to know about either yours or Buck’s love life
Peter is Toni’s little brother. They aren’t actually blood-related, but they became fast friends after they met. Toni was instantly protective of him, due to him getting bullied at school by not one, but multiple douchebags.
As predicted, it's not the door in which they got in with that reopens when the elevator comes to a stop.
Toni puts her hands on his biceps before resting them on either sides of his face. The two of them stay in that position for a minute, content with their closeness.
Steve sets his phone down and rubs his eyes vigorously. He tries to think about anything else than the bold, sharp, charming, generous, fascinating woman whom he just spent the best evening of his life with. After 10 minutes of unsuccessful attempts at it, he opens his phone again and starts playing some of the songs Sam recommended him.
The truth is, at first, Toni was only planning on making Steve another one-night stand. Sure, seeing him and his friends’ ridiculous attempts at sneakiness was cute, but he was just another man after Toni’s body, wasn't he? Plus, she hadn't gotten laid since weeks, and Steve was a sight to see. So what changed Toni's mind and pushed her to ask him out?
From Toni, delivered at 1:28: nah, calling their ceo wasnt necessary. i just texted the manager of the company’s closest restaurant location. they reply fast
” She flees after they both thank her profusely in french and closes the curtain behind her.
Steve is about to call Sam when he decides that it would be best not to bother him when he could just take a cab instead. He’s weirdly not tired; adrenaline and a rush of delight is still coursing through him because of the kisses. It doesn’t really bother him too much that that was all that happened, although he had to admit he wished more would’ve happened. Oh well. He’ll take whatever Toni’ll give him without complaint.
From beloved redhead <3, delivered at 7:51: This is only the hundredth time you’ve told me, but thank you.
Steve can’t help but burst out a laugh at that cheesier-than-a-mozzarella-ball line.
“I have lipstick everywhere around my mouth, don't I?”
“No, we’ll be reading books,” Bucky answers sarcastically with a melodramatic roll of his eyes.
“I probably shouldn’t even waste her time by talking to her. She is clear-ly out of my league. I mean, Forbes? That’s just- whew. And at this age?”
Toni shrugs. “You eat really fast. I've just started my second sandwich and you've already exterminated both of yours!”
announces the time and weather, all the while the windows’s colouration somehow clears up. Steve recomposes his posture and mentally calls himself ridiculous for having been startled by Toni’s impressive AI.
From Natasha, delivered at 0:30: The girl you were crushing on, the one Buck told me about is Toni Stark??
“Toni, seriously, let me clear the bill.” Toni argues some more. “Why are you so obsessed with paying if you say it’s no big deal?”
Steve mirrors the same state as her, sweaty and tousled hair. It's an gorgeous look on him and makes him seem a hundred times more edible. Toni can't help lifting her palm and putting it on the side of his face. She even dares to run her thumb over the edge of his mouth. Steve looks down at her with a strange expression. A hopeful one.
She straightens herself up again, her legs in a W from Steve’s viewpoint. His breath hitches when Toni arms cross, each hand grasping a side of her tank top. Steve's eyes are glued on her, but his hands slide up, holding her hips. She lifts her arms and throws her top somewhere on the ground. Steve stares at her body, feeling a rush of arousal and love. His mouth starts feeling pasty and his tongue, heavy. God, she's gorgeous.
Toni doesn't know and doesn't want to think about it at the moment. She’s already feeling too much anxiety from a whole lot of business-related preoccupations. She has a load of contracts to approve or deny and other documents to look at concerning her new plans for clean energy fuelled buildings, automobiles and whatnot.
His eyes nearly start to well up with humiliation. Of course he misinterpreted, he should’ve known Toni was just being Toni, constantly flirting and throwing out mildly sexual jokes. Steve lets out a noise that almost sounds like a sob. At least, no one should recognize him: he’s still wearing the helmet, only he keeps the face shield up, because he badly needs to breathe, gasp in and out fresh air, or he thinks he’ll be sick. Steve stays at his spot for who knows how long, the feeling like his heart’s going to shatter not gone yet. He can’t leave right now, not yet, not when he feels like he’s going to fall on the ground if he moves too much.
“Sure, man,” he retorts, not quite believing Steve, “You'll tell me all about it later. See you.” And with that, he disconnects the call.
“I bet he was. Tasha has shown me pictures of him, and I can tell you that long hair and man buns are very catchy with women.” Toni lies down on the couch. She's already drunk all of her juice, so she sets the cup on the low, oval table. She pats the cushion next to her as an invitation for Steve to mimic her.
“Uhh, JARVIS, could you ask Toni to open this door?”
Steve closes the lights and climbs back to bed, with the brightness that his phone screen emits illuminating his face.
Natasha flicks her lover’s temple teasingly to get his attention back, before they go join Clint.
Steve senses something stir besides him. ‘Something’ turns out to be ‘someone’, who turns out to be Toni. Steve feels too drowsy to move or even gape open an eye, but still forces out a barely audible groan with an interrogatory intonation to it.
“No, I believe there’s only one God.”
To Toni, delivered at 1:12: No
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 8:30: If you reply right at this second, I will reveal the title of my upcoming film
“Do you want to have dinner with me Friday next week?”
To fave beefcake, delivered at 7:50: steve dont ignore me :(
At midnight, Toni easily persuades Steve to withdraw from the discotheque before they both die of exhaustion.
From Bucky, delivered at 21:50: i see you got into deep conversation with that hottie [smirk emoji]. nat and i are gonna leave with a bunch of people and go to my place, alright? feel free to join us if you want to, and i don’t mind if u bring her along
Natasha takes the pot from Clint’s grip and guzzles the brown liquid before knocking it down on the counter with a pensive expression. “From what you told me about what you two did and talked about, during that evening you first met her, it sounded to me like she indeed actually was interested in you. Maybe you're simply biased by your own strong belief that she rejected you because she wants you as a friend. Besides, why would she even invite you to what is explicitly a date, if that was the case?” She pauses to wait for a reaction that comes as a half-shouldered shrug. “Why don't you describe me how that date went and what the two of you did afterwards? I'll analyze the situation and her signals better, being from a neutral standpoint, and also because I'm just much better than you at reading people.”
Her cherry red cocktail dress and her gladiator heels of the same colour fit her with perfection. Her straight, marionberry black locks are up in a bohemian braid bun that shows off a defined jaw complexion. The whole look is completed with stunning honey gold jewelry: drops earring, lace choker and chain bracelets. She has manifestly a Nat-level sense of fashion.
“Shotgun, then,” Clint says while he's still chewing on food, and he grins wider when Natasha gives him the dirtiest I-am-disgusted-by-you face.
Steve types out something else too, but struggles between deleting it, in case it sounds creepy, and dropping it anyway. He thinks ‘screw it’ and sends it, but still adds a winky face to make it seem more like he’s just kidding.
Toni tries to suppress a smile and fails.
Emma replies instantly with a big smile. “Oh, of course you may, darling.” She swirls around and orders a vodka martini. Steve hands the bartender 10$ and tells him to keep the change.
From Natasha, delivered at 23:17: Don’t forget, tomorrow you’ll have to tell me what happened with that girl. I want to know everything. (Can’t believe I finally won’t have to actively try to find you a girlfriend.)
. He stares at the ceiling. “Seriously. That's what you called me five times for?”
It’s true. Toni forced herself to fry two eggs and slick a toasted slice of bread with crunchy peanut butter before even touching her phone.
“I think I’ll pass. Thanks, Barton.” He smiles politely.
From Toni, delivered at 1:15: no worries, ive already thought about that
“Nah, she’s a Stark. Her name is Antonia Natasha Stark. Her dad used to have business with the father of that cool girl I know, who is kinda my girlfriend,” Scott answers with a snort. He clears his throat. “Anyhow, you wanna hear something impressive? I’ve seen Antonia on the main cover of the Forbes, Rolling Stone AND Time magazines.”
Steve feels his face heat up. Should he reveal that he’s a bit of a creep and knew because he was stalking her from afar, a couple of hours ago?
She whips out a box with a soothing, matte exterior. Steve takes it gently from her hands and opens it. Laying on its bottom shines the beautiful dark, almost turquoise surface of a cell phone.
He answers her question accompanied with one of his own, asking if she’s planning on buying it. The thought of Toni watching that film delights him, seeing as he looked particularly good in it. That is according to all of his friends, at least.
He glares at them arrogantly. “Enjoy your night,” he holds open the door for them.
Steve’s brain still doesn’t accept what he just heard and he stutters incoherently. He draws in a breath leisurely and asks, in an equally delicate tone, “Then why did you reject me kissing you?”
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:45: I'm fairly certain he has a crush on you
To fave beefcake, delivered at 11:03: that would not be the word i’d use precisely, but thank you!
“It’s all right. Where do you stay the most?”
10 minutes later, Steve’s already climbing back on his bike. The more time passes, the more his anticipation rises up, but so does his confusion, considering how unbendingly Steve was certain Toni wasn’t interested in him like... that. He hasn’t stopped questioning himself what the cause of her strange change of mind could be. Well, he isn’t about to complain, either.
From No Caller ID, delivered at 0:20: hey. did you get home safely?
From Toni, delivered at 1:39: and its alright. im a workaholic, so i usually sleep during the early morning anyways
She takes a small bite from her sandwich and sends him an inquiring look. Steve, knowing that she’s only joking, nudges her in the shoulder. “Err, no thanks. I don't want to know if you've done a ‘ménage à trois’ before. Nope.”
As if on cue, Steve hears Toni shout, “Steve! There you are!”
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:34: i was busy getting crushed by the weight of all the paperwork i had to sort
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:39: So, what are you doing right now?
She wears her confidence like that a crown. Easy smiles, elegant postures, swell words (at least, Steve guesses, identifying the looks of admiration from the people around her when she opens her mouth). For some reason, her apparent cockiness doesn’t bother good-ol’ humble Steve at all.
His hands leave her waist and Steve rests them on Toni's arms instead, warming up the cold skin by rubbing and massaging them with his hands. Toni's eyes are closed, in opposite to her mouth, and she makes soft noises.
Toni forces out a smile. “Thank you. What about you? Where are your parents?”
From Toni, delivered at 1:16: so i was going to propose going to this vegan place called copper’s branch. apparently, its super good, and i wanna try new things
“On your personal device, they are all from a contact named ‘fave beefcake’, who I’ve identified to be Steven G. Rogers.” Toni snickers at how his tone was pretty much dripping with judgement when he said the words ‘fave beefcake’. “On your business-only device, one is from Happy Hogan and the other from Obadiah Stane.”
Well, that was direct. Steve knows that the emoji was put there ironically, but the rest was surely her purposefully flirting with him. He swallows down the redness of his cheeks and tries to think of a good reply.
“Come on, boys, let it go. I really don’t give a shit about them. It’s not like I ever promoted them, so whatever.”
“Mmf… Yeah I'm alright.” Steve hears him shift, then yawn. “Mmh, sorry, you woke me up from a nap, actually.”
“Oh uh, it was nothing.”
He would normally feel guilty for straight out ignoring a friend’s calls, but he got too absorbed in how Toni was squeezed, almost cramped against him, her hair’s shampoo scent flowing to his nose, that he completely forgot about it fast enough. Hopefully, Steve was right about Sam not calling him for a serious matter. He still decides to reply to Toni before Sam, because he’s old-fashioned and likes to follow the rule ‘Ladies first’.
From Hogan, delivered at 6:45: Good morning. You’ve requested a ride for tonight at 18:40, but Peter Parker just called me to ask if I could give him a lift for around the same time. It’s for a presentation at the GRAMMY Museum. Do you want me to send him a taxi?
With that said, Toni puts backs her phone on Pepper’s office’s transparent bureau (the one with the obnoxious kinetic sculpture) and leaves.
Steve promptly regrets sending his text, again, because it’s, without doubt, the lamest thing anyone could’ve ever replied to what Toni sent him. He pushes down the feeling of wanting to slap his face and strolls out of the building, praying he won’t get stopped by fans, or worse, the pap.
He undoes the first few buttons of his shirt and pushes back his sleeves. With the image of her dancing so hotly and so close to him still printed on his mind with permanent ink, he pours himself some wine. His cell phone vibrates; it’s definitely Natasha checking on him, which makes him remember that he hasn’t replied to her texts yet. A small part of him hopes it’s Toni, but his assumption was right.
Toni in a shower. Mmh. Steve blushes at the idea of water raining down Toni’s nude body, but not out of embarrassment.
“Hey, isn't that Tasha’s bub?” Toni wiggles her eyebrows, which makes Steve laugh and lightens up the atmosphere.
“Don't worry about the motorcycle, I'll deal with it.”
The two of them sip their iced drinks for a minute, before putting them down on one of the numerous tables and going straight to the crowded dance floor.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:50: i need to refresh my memories
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:45: so hes one of my numerous secret admirers?
When Steve glances at a clock, it indicates 22:29, which is shocking, but at the same time, not really. Steve doesn’t want to sound cliché, but cannot find any other word to describe Toni when he says that she’s truly different from anybody he’s ever met.
As if she heard her thoughts, Toni receives a text from Pep at that very second.
Steve pinches the bridge of his nose and cocks one hand on his hip. Of course they already spilled everything to Clint. “Thank you, but I’m already bloated from eating too much spaghetti. And we aren’t dating, I don’t know if we ever will, to be quite honest,” he finishes weakly.
“I don’t know, Nat," Steve sighs. "You’re sure you and Bucky are cool with two extra people?”
She pushes her face back into her folded arms and exhales slowly. Rhodey picks up a muffled ‘all right.’
En tout cas, je serai votre serveuse pour ce soir. Pesez sur ce bouton,” she points a small button on the edge of the table, “quand vous serez prêts à commander ou si vous avez besoin de quelque chose. Mon nom c’est Noémie.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:38: i KNEW they were going to reunite
last year and they're literally from another continent!”
They all laugh, because they all know it was Natasha who abandoned the two guys to go socialize with her 50 other friends.
“Toni is very clearly interested in me as only a friend. I don't want to make the mistake of trying my chance to romantically be with her another time, in case she finally notices. Maybe the first two times she didn't note it, but there's no way she'll miss it a third time. She’d… She’d be scandalized and would end our friendship, which I can’t have.”
Steve shoots his best friend a glare dead in the eye.
“For you, mademoiselle, a délicieux bombay soup with a side of poutine with cremini mushroom sauce.” A brimming bowl made of porcelain ceramic gets placed in front of Toni, along with a small platter full of smoking hot fries doused with gravy.
He was getting old anyway, nearing 35. To add fuel to the fire, he had been doing this stuff for 11 years: his first blockbuster movie was when he was 22. His career stayed steady enough for him to still be a relevant actor to this day, which meant that a notable amount of invitations poured yearly into his mail.
Two waiters barge in, but the young couple wasn’t taken by surprise; they heard their shuffling before they penetrated the room, both with one plate on top of each palm. Toni leans back and gulps down her lemonade while the attendants present the dishes.
Toni laughs. “You say it like you just changed religions.” She takes in a mouthful of poutine and closes her eyes in glee. Her taste buds just died and flew to heaven. “You have to try this.” She shoves a forkful of her food into Steve’s mouth. He chomps on it, then licks a speck of brown sauce off the corner of his bottom lip.
Toni lazily raises her head to look at Rhodey and grunts. “Can’t stop yet. I still have filing to do. Please make me another pot of coffee, baby.”
“It matches your irises,” Toni explains.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:40: eating breakfast
To Toni, delivered at 1:47: I could say the same about you, exempt for the muscles part. I’d replace that for ‘seductiveness’ (;
With the help of Nat, who’s a self-proclaimed fashion connoisseur/expert, Steve settled with a light blue button-up shirt, dark khakis, and to top it off, an expensive watch.
With the image of her gracefully walking and dress swaying a bit still printed on his mind with permanent ink, he pays and thanks the driver, having arrived at his house.
They haven’t even known each other for two weeks tops, but Steve would be lying if he said this isn’t the most in love he’s been in his life, which is kind of insane.
“Oh, there’s another sequel? Are you going to invite me to the premiere again? Because that’d be real cool,” Clint asks, not missing a beat from what’s supposed to be a conversation about something confidential between Steve and Natasha. Before either of them can reply to Clint, they get interrupted.
Then, his mind drifts to when Toni was so, so close, that he actually believed for a second she was going to lean up and kiss him. He doesn’t want to admit it, because he would then get angry at himself for acting so entitled, but he was truly disheartened by Toni’s rejection. At least that’s what Steve thought it was. Why else would she so plainly avoid Steve kissing her?
Toni says nothing and wets her lips before dragging him outside of the house, where there are already couples, small groups and loners who are talking, drinking and/or smoking. She tells him to stay here for a moment, before entering back into the building.
most attractive person he’s ever seen. That says a lot; during his career, he's seen a fair share of beautiful people when meeting fellow actors, actresses and rich - therefore, well-groomed and chic - people.
“Geez, Buck. You throw after parties at every single party we go. Isn’t THAT a little excessive?”
Steve looks perplexed. “Why? Is it because you wanted to turn over a new leaf?”
Steve doesn’t rely on his voice to not be shaky, but he can’t let her know how upset he is, so he croaks out, “Sorry. I needed… some fresh air.” His voice sounded completely normal, and he sighs without making it too obvious, relieved.
They end up taking the highway, even though that delays their arrival by 20 - fun - minutes.
She wipes her mouth with a satisfied smile. “My bad. I was thirsty. Steve, your food is incontestably delicious, but bread in general is pretty dry.”
Steve follows Toni from behind and frowns when she ignores the elevator completely. Instead, she climbs stairs that were in the opposite direction of the ones Steve used to join her. They appear shortly after in a brightly lit living room. Literal rocks that are three times the size of Steve are placed in various places. Toni has already gone to another room, but Steve lingers where he is to take in the beauty of the place. He lifts his head and admires the circular window breaching a wooden and somewhat imposing ceiling. A couch big enough to fit twelve people on it sits right in front of the wall, which is, like the one in the level below, made of glass. Steve turns around to study the artificial waterfall pouring itself into a thin and long drain. He compliments Toni on her interior design tastes and gets a dazzling smile in return.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:46: and i wanna see which ones youre looking at
“Of course we figured that out, Steve,” Bucky replies with a snort, throwing away the fruit’s core. “It’s still annoying. I mean, even knowing all that, why the fuck would the producers choose Madelyne Pryor over Nat for Best Fem--”
“My real dad's gone, but yes, I know my mom.” A smile draws itself on Toni’s lips. “She’s an amazing woman.”
To Toni, delivered at 0:40: Well, I saw you two talking to each other at the party. You guys seemed too familiar to just be acquaintances, so I put 2 and 2 together
She looks at him innocently. “Huh, you two haven’t kissed yet. How strange. Wait, then what did you do when you stayed over at her place?”
“That’s because it's a Romanian magazine and you wanted to surprise Bucky.”
“Sorry, the pants are tight. I am attempting to wriggle into them but my hips won’t fit.” A groan echoes into the short hallway. “Okay, coming.” Toni exits her bedroom and follows Pepper.
Clint visits Bucky and Natasha’s apartment at least one time every single week. When Steve pointed out how uncanny and disturbing that was, the three of them just raised their shoulders and dismissed it. Steve doesn’t even think he knows who knew who first: did Bucky know Clint before he knew Natasha, or did Natasha know Clint before she knew Bucky? Who introduced who to who? The lines are blurred, nobody knows for sure.
Toni grins when Steve is startled. “You said you had an iPhone? Then you can say that JARVIS is similar to Siri, but so much better. He’s basically his own person and has the mind complexity of any average adult, although I did add a few protocols in case of unusual situations. We have conversations sometimes. Right, J?”
“You are truly a genius.”
From Toni, delivered at 1:48: arent ‘seductiveness’ and ‘hotness’ technically synonyms
At the same time, the other man serves Steve with the identical type of soup and a platter of 6 buffalo wings, then proceeds to describe quickly the oil in which they fried the meat in.
Steve slings his arms around Tony’s shoulders to hide the profanity on his shirt as they walk from the space exhibit to other parts of the museum, Steve cheerfully pointing out his favorite sections like the hall of North American mammals which had cases full of taxidermied animals behind glass with beautifully painted tableaux and plastic flora. Tony can’t help but get caught up in his enthusiasm and he relaxes slowly as the day progresses, despite the prickly feeling at the back of his neck that comes with being in large crowds.
“Was she drugged? Was this a homicide? Was she poisoned?”
He's knows it's wrong. He's only just borrowed Steve, borrowing him until he goes back to where he rightfully belongs, and that's with Peggy Carter, not with him. Not with Tony Stark who is all kinds of wrong for Steve. He's not nearly pretty enough, warm enough, kind enough, good enough, enough enough
Steve ignores the comment but he greets no less than eight people who come up to his locker to talk to him. After what feels like an eternity, he finally finds what he's looking for and stuffs the book into his bag.
The bleachers are tightly packed by the time they arrive, and they probably would've been standing at the back if Pepper and Natasha hadn't saved seats for them. They wade through the crowd to get to their friends, Tony clutching tightly at his bag of warm popcorn and Loki glaring down any poor souls who have the audacity to accidentally get in their way.
“I can't believe we're both so fucking stupid,” Tony says again, gentling his voice to soften the sting of the words. He touches the side of Steve’s face, fingers tracing along his jawline and delights in the way Steve shivers.
,” Tony breathes, feeling the breath knocked out of him. He can barely speak around the lump that suddenly rises in his throat. “This is so beautiful…. Is that—is that how I really look like to you?”
“Tony, just think about it. Maybe give the guy a chance.”
It's February when Tony wakes up with the cold realization that he's in love with Steve all over again. Perhaps it was unavoidable all along, ever since he wrote that damn letter last year, but the concrete certainty that explains the ache in his chest still stuns him. Especially since Steve is asleep next to him, sprawled starfish across his bed and hogging up all the blankets.
“I haven't always been that way,” he says, voice hushed. “Been scared of everything my whole life.”
Now, finally,
Tony startles and nearly knocks over his tea when Jarvis reaches over to pat his hand. In that instant, he feels so small, like he's a child with a scrape on his knee again, coming to Jarvis for a bandaid and comfort. He had known with such conviction when he was little that Jarvis could protect him from anything, fix anything, and he wishes fervently Jarvis could fix his broken heart now too.
“Because this is how the rest of the world lives, Tony,” Steve replies easily enough, but there's an edge to his words, sharp and jagged. “This is how I get to school. Not all of us are so privileged with cars and drivers and fancy houses uptown.” He pauses and looks back at Tony, his eyes softening. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you,” he says, his voice gentler now.
Tony makes a decision, just as the silence hangs for a moment too long. “She is,” he replies, and the relieved smile that hesitantly curls Steve’s mouth is enough to make his chest ache anew.
“Don't worry about it, Rogers,” Tony says, trying for levity. “It's not like you're the only one who got one.”
Before Tony can work past the rising lump in his throat to say anything, Steve wakes up with a start, his eyes darting wildly across the room before they settle on Tony. First, they’re panicked and frightened before they settle into forced bleary calm. There’s an edge of relief in the endlessly blue and infinitely sad, filled with silent wonderment. He looks slightly astonished, as though he’s just seen a ghost and he thinks Tony might disappear in the next second.
Tony is at his most comfortable when he’s at home with Steve and their children. He’s usually a ball of kinetic energy and fluttering hands, floating from one end of a room to another, free flowing affection and endless streams of chatter, the embodiment of warmth and love and laughter.
“I love it when you talk dirty,” Tony says, and Steve laughs as he finally allows himself to be pulled in for a kiss. And a second. And a third. “We would’ve left early anyways. We hate events like these. As much fun as it is to grope you in public under the table, it’s much more fun when it’s just the two of us at home, don’t you think?”
The edge of the facility’s grounds is barely an acre to the north, and Tony thinks
He makes sure his tone is empty when he says, “no need, Rogers. It was part of the contract. You got what you wanted, so this agreement,” he waves his free hand between them, “this transaction is over. Payment rendered on both sides, everyone is happy. You get Peggy back and I get my friends back, just like we agreed.”
Bucky wolf whistles and claps. Steve purposefully splashes him as he dives into the pool in one fluid motion and Bucky laughs unrepentantly, cackling even as the water flies into his face.
On impulse, Tony reaches up with one hand to cup Steve's face, and presses a kiss to his jaw. Clint makes a gagging noise. There's a pink flush high on the crest of Steve's cheeks but he's looking at Tony with an unwavering gaze, seemingly unnoticing of Peggy five tables away. Steve's eyes are ridiculously blue, and Tony
As he’s about to brush past Peggy to the door, she touches his arm and he stops in his tracks. Her hand falls away as she looks at him. She’s not wearing her usual red lipstick, Tony notices.
“Fine,” Steve finally mutters, his clenched jaw a strained line of tension. “We'll try this.” He drops a crumpled twenty on the table and leaves before Tony can say anything else.
and he’s held onto his failure so personally, it drags him down like a weighted stone.
It takes Tony a minute to stop shaking when Howard finally hangs up and his phone dangles limply in the lax grip of his hand as he stares unseeing up at the sickle moon. He’s surprised Howard hasn’t bothered to say anything about Steve for so long, but his words are clear as day.
But Steve is a poor planchette and-- while he can not shake his certainty in
Everything in the workshop is exactly as Tony left it. While the tower sustained some damage during the attack, the actual point of Chitauri ingress had been a gaping portal that stretched over the George Washington Bridge and into Fort Lee. The location of that time/space tear was just one more senseless aspect of an attack that had no herald or causation on 'their' side of reality. It was as though some fool god had thrown a cosmic dart, only to miss New York City proper by a hair. Nothing about the battle had been logical, least of all its abrupt ending, but Rogers has turned it over and over in his mind so many times it seems as though one more tactical assessment will break the fragile casing which holds him here, in
It's tempting, even now. Steve has the choice to think rationally, for a little while at least, but it is not yet an obligation. Tony's eyes are dark, glittering, depthless water by the light of golden moons. 'Umber,' Steve thinks, because he has a watercolor stylus just that shade. It's never seemed like a color that communicated passion or tenderness before, but it does now.
monkey on stage, every trick perfectly timed and on cue, but without any real meaning to the performer.
Tony never reacted to Steve's offensive posturing, and certainly not in the way textbooks described. There had been none of the violence an omega was taught to expect if they had the temerity to to balk at an alpha's attempt to bond. In fact, it was the one scenario in which aggression from omega was an acceptable; the 'honor' knife most unbounded omegas carried with them being a supposed token of the pre-Exodus days. It was generally felt that, should an omega succeed in fending off a potential mate, there was something wrong with the match anyway. Yet Steve can think of no example of the situation in recent memory, and the odds for an omega going up against the institutionalized martial training alphas receive are hardly encouraging. Certainly, his mother's honor knife had done her no good.
. Or something roughly analogous to such. Build with chemicals and you get reactions, build with animo acids and you get life. Build with syntax and commands and eventually you get a self-perpetuating program that just
It's true. Steve always turns back to face the enemy, whomever that might be. Now it takes perhaps ten seconds for the wounded puzzlement washing acid-hot through the bond to penetrate a lifetime of habit, reminding him that the grip he faces at present is not adversarial at all. Even then, he only tempers his struggles to avoid harming Tony (all else aside, Rogers does possess a mean right hook) rather than acquiescing entirely.
,' Steve always silently added during his adolescence, thereafter guiltily wondering of G-d could wash your
"I must stop being astonished by you first, I expect," Tony replies philosophically. His hands steal to his mate's hips, turning the omega over gently and massaging the muscles at the small of his back. It's lovely-- helpful
. Tony has been forced to accommodate aliens and so-called magic in his world-view; enhanced humans and hammers that _judge_, to say nothing of the weekly artificially-enlarged monster attacking a national monument. There's just a certain point, however, at which he must put down his stylish Gucci heel. Magic is only science not yet understood-- an argument he loves to pick with Thor, especially given that Jane has unequivocally taken Tony's side. Loki's precious glow-stick is a perfect example. Within the scepter, a stone; within the stone, a gem that contained only
Why is it that, just when you really need to write to take your mind off things, your muse takes off for the Crab Nebula without so much as a post-it note? Seriously, I've been trying to finish this since late August, but I think we're finally good to go. As always, kudos and comments make me a happy little speckle, and keep me motivated to decipher my own bloody handwriting. ^^'
The alpha is purring like a liger now, Steve thinks half-hysterically, still swathed in the surreal impressions they've discussed. The bounding scar adorning his neck is a clear source of pleasure for his mate, who runs a gentle knuckle along the shape of it. Unconsciously, Rogers parts and licks his lips, an instinctual invitation answered with the press of Tony's mouth, though not with the devouring passion he's become accustomed to.
Fire transforms but ice, with its cruel precision, preserves.
Time, and Molecule Man's solipsistic plotting, would show him what he had perhaps already known only in his gut. Beyond the shock and necessity of maintaining focus in a combat situation, had he been angered by the deception which-- though Tony had no way of knowing-- had caused so much turmoil within his own being? He'd been led towards false assumptions as surely as Sister Marie Patrice once guided his cursive, hand-over-hand. That the
-- repulsors instead of rockets!-- and he's a swell guy.' That he was a bit more uncertain about the bodyguard's employer went unsaid. Jan had hummed her agreement, but he had seen Natasha's gaze flicker amidst the kitchen's many reflective surfaces, as if she observed him from all angles and thus knew something he himself did not.
Is that Tony's thought, or only Steve's admittedly vivid imagination? It's rare for bondmates to communicate more than impressions, ideas, or vague memories, but it isn't unheard of.
Tonight, as has become his habit, he heads down to the workshop, the elevator obliging him without a single word. While JARVIS still fulfills requests and manages the myriad ongoing tasks to which Tony set him, the AI hasn't spoken since shortly after the funeral. Information is still helpfully displayed on tablets or via holograms, but it is antiseptic and free of comment-- the responses one would expect from a computer. That Steve is automatically ushered down to the engineer's former domain without direct request is one of the few signs JARVIS is still actively watching. Rogers doesn't know if a system as complex as the one Tony created can 'turn off' its consciousness, nor does he particularly wish to contemplate whether or not suicide can be committed by an entity that was never technically 'alive'. He simply takes these odd moments of consideration-- the channel that changes abruptly when certain footage is sadistically played, the continued delivery of art pencils and appearance of favorite foods, or the faint sound of AC/DC coming from an unoccupied lab in the middle of the night-- as little signs of life. Otherwise, it would almost be the loss of another friend.
to be rescued. Sooner or later, his captors will move him, or feed him, or come to to interrogate (or manically pontificate at) him. Some detail will slip, someone will screw up.
"Steve, I can feel-- are you alright!?" There's an edge of panic in Tony's voice, though its impossible to tell if Rogers himself is bleeding over via the bond or if it is merely an instinctual alpha response to their mate's distress. Regardless, the protectiveness radiating from Stark's end of the connection is powerful and enveloping-- almost but not quite stifling, as an untried swimmer might find the deliquescence of the sea.
"Some nose on that fella," Steve remarks inconsequentially, now leaning against the smooth metal wall of a workshop in an entirely different century, where it isn't illegal to marry outside your race or love someone of the same sex. You can even dance with them out in the open, assuming you can dance at all. He's so tired, running on fumes but unwilling to sleep because he knows he'll dream, and the enemy is moving around in the dark. Redrawing the lines.
. Someone will eventually notice that Iron Man, genius playboy superhero philanthropist and creator of everyone's favorite homicidal AI, is missing.
The rest is a matter of time, observation, and tenacity.
soothing-- causing a now-familiar lassitude to settle over Steve like a mist. While the brunt of bonding heat seems to have passed, it's unlikely to be over just yet. Desire burns like coal fires beneath a barren moon, waiting, mindlessly seeking exit. He could let it rise now to swallow everything, drag Tony down beside him, his own skinny arms like a garland about his alpha's corded neck.
It's true, then, Steve acknowledges-- but only in the dark, empty spaces behind his heart. The reason for the faint thought is two-fold: first, the difference between understanding and acceptance and, the second, sheer self-preservation. He can feel the newly formed bond humming along his surface considerations, what the Church calls 'a twining of the outer souls'. Right now, confusion reigns between the bondmates-- static cutting in and out so often one can barely make out the song. Gender Treachery-- what is more colloquially referred to as 'passing'-- is illegal. Steve can't even hazard a guess as to how the alpha would react to the revelation that he was not, perhaps,
A weakness for the sauce-- how positively proletariat, my dear! Vat 69 or Four Roses, it all comes out the same end. Or up, as the case may be. He was at work at a pretty good (and lately pretty unusual) bender when he was taken, code jumping between his fingers in a way only tangentially related to holographic projection. Out of practice with Ye Ol' Bottle and unable to remember the last time he'd slept, the shadows had begun taking on weird little protuberances in his peripheral vision. All that money and he never gets a good hallucination. It's always the overwhelming sense of a presence (his father, Obie) at his back, or the impression of something writhing beneath solid surfaces. The occasional naked Captain America, or even a few cheerleaders, isn't really asking so much, is it?
Be it the seamy atmosphere of the club, general disinterest, or some combination thereof, Rogers has never made a habit of touching himself. While the Church has no objection to onanism for betas, since all are sterile regardless of male/female secondary sex characteristics, Steve just never seems to have the urge. What would he picture, anyway? His half-worshipful crush on Peggy might move him artistically and emotionally, but there's never been a physical component, and the attitudes he sees backstage have made him loathe to exploit their friendship even in the relative safety of fantasy. In the blank dark behind his eyes, any attempt at strictly sensual enjoyment of his own body has always made him feel self-conscious and oddly claustrophobic.
They sit like that for some time, backs against the mirrored and marble wall, beside the washbasin with its faucet-dolphins leaping in gold. The silence between them is strange, thick but somehow incongruously comfortable. What can be said, at this point? Yet, as Steve gazes on their reflections amidst the forest of nephrite-veined columns, he cannot help but think they look like nothing so much as two boys sprawled and resting, deliberately relaxed to disguise the fact they are hopelessly lost.
"As you likely know, I am their frequent target," the engineer continues. "In fact, I've thought of investing in their drivel myself-- might as well get a cut of the money they're making off me." The prosaic tone melts into something steely, covered over with velvet only for Steve's benefit, "They won't be exploiting
He is not a Man Out of Time, though the media has delighted in that sobriquet ever since the Avengers found him. He has Time in abundance; or rather, a great deal of it has accumulated around him, leaving him untouched. They marvel at him, the glittering and fast-paced people of this brave and unpredictable new world, constantly asking him to affirm the wonders and progress of their modern age. And would they likely stick him in an exhibit next to Piltdown Man if they thought they could get away with it? Brother, you'd better believe it!
amongst betas other polymorphisms just don't understand. Betas enter and leave existence alone; no 'perfect match for them, be it genetic or spiritual. G-d's gift to their sex is that of choice. They can make a pact in full possession of their faculties; '
And, given Steve's physical weakness, what nearly took his mother's life will almost certainly take his.
"Not so well," Tony chuckles. As quickly as the delight appears, it is submerged beneath a more serious look of concern. Stark's face is as mobile as it is neo-classically beautiful, expression not at all concealed by his neat, if eccentric, beard. "Are you well? In pain anywhere?"
is ill-fitting and still not quite appropriate, but he also treasures his new and obstinate doubt towards the Divine. It reminds him of Tony, of old and largely playful arguments he now continues alone-- though with a much more conciliatory attitude-- in the dead of night. Now they can commiserate, he and the memory of his lover, on the imperfect construction of the universe and all within it.
partly submerged-- intersecting in his gut. His eyes feel gummy, but closing them provides little relief. An intolerable brightness surrounds him, light so harsh and unrelenting it feels like a solid thing, despite the fact it has no discernible source. No bare lightbulbs or warehouse fluorescents here, and Stark has come to the conclusion that this diffuse brilliance is a significant decorative flaw. To be cliche is one thing; its almost entertaining to see would-be villains posture in overdone noir, or watch Hydra commandants strut as if they aren't the distillation old-world nightmare. They make mockeries of themselves, and Tony loves to point this out. Even in Afghanistan, he couldn't quite keep a lid on his smart mouth. One of the burlier minions-- a sadistic homunculus Tony dubbed 'Tweedle Three', having used up Tweedles Dee, Dumb, and Doo-Doo-- swore he'd have the engineer's tongue as a souvenir when his usefulness was over. Tweedle Three's attention was far from flattering, but actively loathing Stark kept the bastard's focus away from Yinsen. The nascent Iron Man put an end to the thug, but not before… well.
forbidden by the Church, it's only because no one's been imaginative enough to consider them in the first place), are conjuring an answering fire in Stark. Steve could drown them both right now, and maybe that's only fair.
uncertain of you," he admits. "I imagine you feel the same way about me, at least a bit." Stark has far less to worry about, though. He is an alpha, and so every high card already belongs to him.
-- and so on. And don't get Romanov started on the Leningrad School.)
His distress-- if not the cause itself-- must be evident, for Tony makes a gentle crooning noise, smiling apologetically. "I've been lying here for almost an hour," Stark confesses, "looking at you and trying to think of something charming or clever to say." He rolls his dark eyes in odd self-deprecation. "Preferably both-- I have a reputation to uphold."
Sure enough, when Rogers closes his eyes to quell the remnant dizziness, the alpha's instincts finally overwhelm him. A single finger trails down Steve's knobby spine, followed by the strokes of a full, flat palm. Both touches are soothing, grounding, chased by an answering flair of warmth in their bond. If Stark could have left it at that, the younger man would have simply soaked up the attention like sunshine on a windless winter day. What follows, however, is as predictable as it is irksome, for those same hands come to gather Steve up and haul him into the alpha's lap.
Feeling abysmally foolish and longing for the ignorance of only moments ago, Steve barely notices the sudden liquefaction of his knees. Hands failing to find purchase on the sides of the marble sink, he slides down to the verdant tile floor, hips and tailbone jarring against the hard surface as though to emphasize how ill-suited they are for the task Nature has apparently chosen. His own mother had been a slender creature, and the entry of her son into the world a prolonged and dangerous ordeal. She very nearly perished. Certain persons in the village were not shy about remarking that it might have been better if she had--  she and her runt pup, with her. While perhaps an inch or so taller than Sarah har'Rogers, Steve is thinner still, and of a more 'delicate' (how he

, as profound as a boat suddenly lifted by a mile-high wave. It's nauseous, molecular, and accompanied by a thin high scream. Tony thinks the voice sounds female, but the pitch is so mutilated by agony that it's hard to tell. Distant, but with the force of the desperate. She's gonna hit this one out of the park, folks. He wishes he could take comfort in the knowledge he's not the only human here, but the quality of fear in that cry makes it rather a moot point.
The thought makes him chuckle, a sound thankfully light on hysteria. It's the sort of odd-ball, half-irreverent humor that makes him feel more settled-- a 'what-can-you-do-about-it' whistling in the dark. Moving perhaps a bit gingerly, he avails himself of said lavatory and then even the bidet. Normally the latter might seem like just another facet of decadence, but he's grateful for the lukewarm water, washing himself with his typical detachment. It doesn't quite work, though, no matter how diffident his own touch remains. While there's no actual pain, he does have areas of undeniable hyperawareness, muscles pleasantly sore in a way he would not have credited without experiencing it himself. The remnant sensitivity carries its own vague eroticism; tantalizing, ghostly caresses to his core, his nipples (which Tony subjected to the most assiduous, loving torture), and the bonding scar on his neck. The latter throbs deliciously when brushed by the robe's collar, but Steve has avoided examining it-- either by his own touch, or in the mirror. This new sensuality is already making his body feel like an odd contrivance he's somehow piloting. There's no reason to reinforce such delusions by lingering over that which so blatantly marks him as no longer his own. They speak of 'self-possession', of getting ahold of one's self, but an omega belongs to their alpha alone.
' was his mother's more philosophical approach, accompanied by a heavenward roll of her eyes when people pointed at them on the street. '
The therapist's response had been gentle-- too gentle to hide the scientific caution that motivated it. He needs to work on consciously work on integrating his experiences, she advised. Not only his recent loss, but his displacement and the 'new chapter' of his life as a whole. Given the amount of trauma he has experienced in a subjectively short amount of time, of course his mind would attempt to reject the entire series of events. It is never the less unhealthy to indulge such fantasies. A large part of Steve understands this line of reasoning-- even agrees with it, though his stomach churns when he considers it for any length of time, as though attempting to eject or sweat out poison. Yet a silver of his soul, the same one that allowed him the imagination to attempt survival in this new century, wants to continue arguing. To explain about intuition in the heat of battle, how artistic rules about perspective extend to reality, how some things are just fundamentally
Dimly, Steve feels sorry she's gone-- feels sorry
So here is said genius, ransom value decidedly up in the air, trying to comfort himself with the knowledge that-- personality flaws or no-- not a soul on Earth would want Stark brains in the wrong hands.
Strung up and soaking like salted meat in an abattoir, Tony buries his face as best he can against his aching arm. He doesn't want to think about these things, to trod the circuitous and unraveled roads in the wasteland of his inner mind. There's a reason he's left it a No Man's Land, no jet or road service here. It's not so much that he believes himself above his fellow man-- though he will claim so, at great length-- but that he hit the ground running the moment he exited the womb. His mind moves too quickly, it gets away from him. He gets away from himself, always racing, and anyone who can keep up long enough to be more than a speck in the distance is refreshing. Welcome company, given his only other companionship is that of his creations and his greatest enemy: himself. No advocate of self-awareness, he is always at odds with his own keen perception, which is where drugs, sex, alcohol, and any number of other shiny things come into play. He's been fighting boredom since Edwin Jarvis found him, crib half-dismantled, poking at a radiator in an unused guest room when he was supposed to be down for a nap. Locked doors, boarding schools, social expectations, and lab security systems all suffered the same demolished fate.
Flinching inwardly, Steve realizes he has his arms crossed over his chest, less a gesture of modesty or coquetry than sheer combativeness. If Tony notices, or subjects his mate to any sort of evaluating gaze at all, he gives no sign, instead reaching into a nearby bureau for the complimentary robes stocked by the chamber-staff. Like everything else at the Grandmaster's establishment, the selection is even more gaudy than it is luxurious; concoctions of velvet with plush quilted lining, wispy satin delicacies shot through with metallic thread or brilliants. Shrugging into a mantle adorned with predatory birds, the alpha hands Steve a similar one done in crimson and gold, rooting amongst their discarded clothing with his free hand. When he triumphantly holds up a holopane, the smaller man leans forward eagerly, absently pushing up the robe's long satin sleeves.
Now that its a matter of proving himself, the temptation to lure his alpha back evaporates entirely. While not quite reduced to using the gilded bed-stool, Steve's dismount is far less graceful. The whole sheer-draped monstrosity is on a raised marble platform, too-- it's Roger's considerate opinion that tall people (i.e., everyone else) like to stick steps, even if only a few of them, in odd places on purpose. He takes a moment to savor the borrowed height before descending to join the other man. Level, he barely comes up to Stark's shoulder. While he may be alright in the face, Steve has no illusions about the rest of himself-- even if you leave off digging through his genetic profile, he's no prize. Most everyone in the Imperium meets a certain default standard of aesthetics, by virtue of prenatal care and the selective stock from which this latest iteration of humanity stems. People of his own class may not be able to afford or gain access to some of the corrective procedures the gentry enjoy, but 'biological sports'--
Tony tells himself he's being overly critical of his present abductors. So what if the outré stone walls gleam and issue light while denying themselves as the source, now and then rippling as if with some vegetable sentience? He's uncomfortable, yes, but also unmarked-- there have been no vengeful beatings or applications of 'motivational' pain. In the distressingly varied annals of 'The Abductions of Tony Stark', these particular kidnappers aren't rating very high so far. Perhaps they're inexperienced, or from a more obscure school of torture. He snorts and chuckles to himself at the notion of breaking down 'information extraction' methodologies like movements in art. The Classicists, heavy on the fists, boots, and tooth-extractions; the Baroque adherents with splattered blood-play and iron maidens; the Modernists with their mind-games, water-boarding, and machine guns.
Steve's throat is constricting in a way that can only be remedied by his Tri-Ox pills, but even that thought only summons a coil of hysterical laughter trapped in his gut. Isn't that the old chestnut-- that an omega need have no fear of pregnancy if only they held a capsule between their knees?
Sickly, small, and hardly a sound genetic match for anyone, Rogers had been classified a beta at twelve, and the results were the same when he was retested per mandate at fourteen. No one ever questioned it;
"I…" Tony rests their foreheads together, voice sounding as ragged as his mate's did a moment ago. Is honesty always so painful, scouring against the throat? "I hate to admit it, but I feel much the same." A new variation on his smile-- their variety seems as endless as Stark designs featured on holocast-- is both vexed and self-conscious. "This is all rather surreal, isn't it?"
. They interrupt the flow, as if someone suddenly inserted extra panels into a comic strip, skewing the two dimensional world of 'POW!' and 'WHAM!' until it no longer makes any sense. They have no herald and even less reason for complete retreat, yet their attack stands alone. They have yet to return, left no evidence as to their origins or motive for the attack.
Still, it's not bad work, as work to be had with only a Basic Education certificate goes. They can afford real meat every ten-day-- not synthetic protein strips-- if Steve hasn't been too sick, and they bought a larger heat cube over the winter. More importantly, they can lodge at whatever beta boarding house they choose. No living in a company compound where they garnish half your wages for the privilege of tenancy in a cupboard. Recently, Bucky's started going on about how, in a few months, he might be able to take out a loan on a mid-sized holo vid unit, something he's been lusting after for quite a while.
Slowly, solemn as an art student in a vast Florentine cathedral, Steve begins a circling tour of the room's shelves and benches. Draped as they are by clear, protective plastics, it is still perfectly easy to discern the tools and half-finished projects beneath, even if it isn't always obvious what those projects are
'Problem is,' Bucky always points out, 'you don't have the sense to hightail it out of there once you're free.'
The notion of breakfast has an astonishing effect on Steve, as if the mere mention of food is all his stomach required to roar to famished life. Someone must have hastily stocked the chamber with fruits, cheese, and vitamin cakes before ushering the newly bonded couple inside-- he can still see the detritus on the nightstand, and vaguely remembers licking sweet juices from Tony's fingers while the alpha fed him pieces of a fruit whose center was like a violet star. The 'provider instinct' at work, though Roger is lucky the unidentified offering didn't turn out to be once of his yet-unknown allergies.
was fabulous and fabulously glad that
'You read too much, punk,' that old echo of Bucky comments. 'All that history'll get tangled up like yarn around your brain. How many bombed-out cathedrals, how many little stone churches did we see, surrounded by ash? They showed you too, on film and all-- that terrible cloud. Looked like a mushroom waiting to be picked by the Hand of G-d. Can't you hear the train along the trestle? Ain't nothing that lasts.'
is a GREAT fic along those lines.
- slang term in this universe for a beta or younger alpha in 'drag' as an omega, basically creating the only 'opportunity' alphas have been pre- or extra-marital affairs.
It's a dream he hasn't admitted to since childhood, bright like a vein of silver through the ore of learned practicality. Nothing but mental flotsam from the start, such hopes, but there are still little things he can have. You make do. During festivals and the heavy-traffic of First and Second Summer, the Grandmaster brings in famous City artisans to produce the revues. Play-writes-- such as they are in the dubious genre of the 'boudoir stage'-- and costumers, set specialists who argue over color and lighting, even a hot-ticket 'tweener to headline. On the off-season, though, its just the aging stage manager with Peggy as part-time assistant, so they often let Steve do some of the set design. Especially for the raunchy late-night numbers. 'Just a flat holo-backdrop will be fine,' Reinstein might say, 'Do one of your Post-Burn deco revival things. No one's really paying attention, we just need to set the mood.'
at me like that!
If Tony's 'overheard' any of this, he gives no indication, busy pushing aside the robe's lapel to marvel over the omega's fresh bonding mark. It must be vivid blood red now, though it will fade to a muted but still discernible niveous silver. Steve sways, deliciously lost and clinging to fistfuls of Tony's mantle. Predictably, the alpha employs his mouth for a far more thorough investigation of the new mark, contentedly nuzzling behind the shorter man's ear. It's the sort of adoration that could quickly become addicting. Perhaps that's what Steve is afraid of-- of what things will be like for them beyond the the heats that bind them via biological imperative.
Silence is his only companion, not even the sounds of air ventilation to break up the rhythm of his own breathing. Silence and panic-- that old untrained freeloader, fucking with the values and breaking all the equipment. He's keeping it together despite the closeness of the fluid to his mouth and nose, despite the twin rapiers of anxiety-- being restrained
Phrasing aside, Tony hadn't been all that surprised by evidence of Cap's good opinion, merely disconcerted at knowing it had been so openly articulated. He'd managed to tolerate a 'you're alright, Stark' on their way to the infamous shawarma (along with the hearty shoulder-clasp of a man who still sometimes misjudged his own strength), but made it a point to cut any further praise or attempted apology off at the knees. Rogers, he has learned, is someone who can actually occasionally admit when he's wrong; a terrifying opening Tony learned not to give others long ago. Keep up with the pace, Cap-- it's the 21st century and we're never wrong or really sorry, only sorry we got caught. The potential for real friendship with his fellow Avenger has remained present but untapped, along with the definite attraction a wild dwarf planet might feel for a stable main-sequence star. Gravity which must be resisted because the cost was simply too high. There are things to admire about Rogers; idiosyncrasies to be affectionately annoyed by, flaws and differing opinions held sometimes so righteously that they actually make him refreshingly human. They're both grown men; comrades, fellow veterans of the PTSD wars, heavy on the bizarre histories but not totally without social skills. It could work, this camaraderie, and sometimes it actually does.
a pattern, no matter how bizarre, and therefore an intelligent will behind it-- have been of such specialization, such raw intellectual capability, that the trend almost escaped SHIELD's attention. Each disappearance had been its own miniature crisis, beyond that of a typical citizen's abduction; each case had been classified at once, relegated to obscure clearance levels in whichever security agency got ahold of it first. After that, the intel had been subject to jurisdictional disputes between the FBI, CIA, NSA, DHS, and a host of other acronyms including what many traditional G-men snidely refer to as 'the freak wranglers'. Once Jane Foster numbered amongst the lost, the Avengers personal investigation soon revealed a larger pattern that might otherwise have continued unnoticed. Colonel Fury's ire and cool insistence had ensured the entire matter fell solely under SHIELD's purview, and in short order. After all, the WSC was reminded, one of the 'freaks' being 'wrangled' was-- for all intents and purposes-- a god.

who pushed that precipitous nuke into the portal which so mysteriously and spontaneously opened over Fort Lee, New Jersey. Pushed it through and made it back before the gates slammed, only to fall…)
All of this had left Tony to follow, deaf to the shouts of his compatriots, chasing Steve down isles of industrial equipment while his quarry calculated hasty strategy and at last, massive pot lid in hand, turned for a show-down. Rogers isn't sure what happened to his makeshift shield-- at some point, he was staring at the alpha with a dizzying feeling of revelation and only his bare fists raised. 'Apocalypse,' they called it in catechism class, 'a drawing back of the veil'. He'd certainly
Pull hard enough, dig enough, and you will always find a man behind the curtain-- of that, Tony is convinced. Though he is beyond eager to leave the tender auspices of his current captors, he will make every effort to procure a sample of this fluid so he can deconstruct the fuck out of it.
(Incredible Hulk comics),
Rogers had been ready to fight at first, not quite understanding (or perhaps not ready to understand) what was happening. Stark, having caught enough of the ill-prepared servant's scent, had almost jumped him as he turned from the table. Having enough sense to know the palatial amber-and-carnelian floors of the Grandmaster's banquet pavilion were no place for a brawl, Steve's first thought was to get away from the crowd. Alphas take umbrage occasionally, especially when in their cups. It's uncouth, but so is half of what goes on in such clubs, especially the ogling of 'entertainment' betas dressed and scented in omega 'drag'. Unable to think just how he'd challenged the guest's authority merely by bringing euphoric to the table, Steve had dropped the entire elaborate drink tray (which was thankfully DuraChina) and high-tailed it for the relative safety of the kitchen, where he could at least defend himself without an audience and fight on familiar ground.
. May the fates always be one step behind me!'
, just responsible asset control. Everything else, every ephemeral 'impression', is just a distraction. Rattling his wrists in their bindings as much as he can, Tony smiles as though he knows something. He doesn't, but 'they' don't know what, and mind games are like sex-- it's just not as much fun with only one participant.
bonds. For his part, the beta-- the
It's funny because, while Tony always hated magic, he was the ultimate prestidigitator. He wrapped himself in a cloak of designer-label lacquer, all flash and sheen and every tawdry red carpet cliche, and beneath that disguise wrought miracles which exceeded every imagination of the preoccupied here-and-now. When Steve first met him-- met Iron Man-- he seemed the distillation of every
Steve isn't terribly surprised to find that the bathroom is just as ridiculous as the bedchamber, though thankfully free of living ornament. Almost the size of the suite proper, its gently curving walls are lined with columns of nephrite-veined marble, all gathered in attendance around a central sunken bath. The floor, where visible, is done in tile of greenish quartz. Any pattern it might have is lost under the preponderance of thick white rugs, which Steve can only view with horror, knowing the effort it must take to keep them so clean. The ceiling opens to a stained glass cupola, casting everything in translucent shadows of topaz, lime, and viridian. Even the tub is lined with soft faux fur, the waterproof kind that costs a small fortune and must be replaced regularly. The faucet handles are gold, in the shape of leaping dolphins-- a detail so outrageous Steve actually clamps a hand over his mouth to trap the belly-deep chuckles of hysteria suddenly bubbling within.
Of course, there are also new terrors that stalk abroad in this 'world of tomorrow', a place not shining and prepackaged or possessed of 'ooh'ing crowds and orderly lines, as the pretender showpiece he and Bucky attended had been. The ills of this fresh century are not precisely original, but they are still the likes of which Sarah Roger's little boy could never have dreamed. It's like the good ol' rag-bag; buttons and pockets, swatches cut out of shirts otherwise stained and ruined. Everything from humanity thrown in and rummaged, for evil is nothing new under the sun, remerging pieced together in a way that-- while vaguely recognizable-- still evokes fresh horror. Clouds like poisonous mushrooms, packed into missiles the size of a giant's aspirin
talking to the absent genius, leaving silence in those places meant for technical jargon, and filling in the quips as if-- with enough practice-- he might function as some sort of conduit. He drinks and the ghost of Tony drinks, neither of them suffering for it-- and companionable lapses occur when the soldier's imagination falls woefully short.
The voice sounds vaguely like the village Abbess, but it is really far more ambiguous-- an amalgamation of every faceless intonation of Imperium culture, reminding everyone of their purpose and their place. Steve cannot conceive-- ha, ha!-- of a future with a child, doesn't know if he's ever wanted one or not, for one rarely forms an opinion on the impossible. He would sooner have realistically contemplated what it would be like to sprout wings and fly. How can he look to the future through the lens of his own mortality, and which is more disturbing-- death, which he could accept as honorable if it gave life, or the responsibility of protecting a tiny, innocent creature if he himself should miraculously live?
Steve wakes to the slide of reverent fingers through his hair and the sight of fish swimming unconcernedly above him. It's difficult to say which of these factors is more disconcerting, especially since the fingers belong to the veritable stranger who is now his bondmate. Those same strong, dexterous digits retreat suddenly, drawing Steve's attention from the crystalline ceiling above to the alpha curled close around him. His companion looks torn between fondness, embarrassment, and some other emotion Steve cannot quite name. On a beta or omega he might call it 'tremulousness', but surely no alpha-- least of all the genius heir to the Stark fortune-- would show or experience such uneasiness with their own bonded.
While he has new friends and comrades, a function to fulfill in an age of threats international, interstellar, and inter-dimensional (plus a few more '
"I suppose we should get out of bed," Tony agrees belatedly, harkening back to an earlier part of the conversation as though the last few minutes simply haven't happened. "I'm not so foolish as to think we're completely out of the woods yet, but we should make arrangements while we can." He rolls off the high mattress with ease, looking back at his mate inquisitively. "Unless you'd like to finish the heat here?"
Steve raises an eyebrow. “Why does it cost 50$ more for men? Are they misandrists?”
Toni glances at her car’s electronic screen. Goddammit, she’s going to be late - marginally so, but still.
“All right, is 6 okay? We can grab a hotdog after, I wanna hear all the details about your date. You went to her place and stayed over, right?” Sam doesn't hide the suggestive tone from his voice with that last sentence.
“We’ve been here for a while, haven’t we? Wanna g-”

Steve snorts and gets out of the residence when they are done exchanging goodbyes. He walks to the elevator and presses the button with an upside down arrow. He distractedly thinks about Toni, wondering how much fun it’d be to play games like that with, since she’s even more competitive than Steve himself. The shaft finally reaches the 26th floor and Steve is glad there’s nobody in it already. He finds being in a closed space with a stranger to be one of the most awkward things there is.
She then holds her hand out. Maybe it’s a habit she developed as a businessperson?
“We are so sorry if we're bothering you. We LOVE all of your movies,” shrieks the stranger with the yellow sparkling top.
Steve totally expected her to kiss him, by the way. Toni isn't cockblocking them on purpose though!
“Do you know your biological parents?”
“So, what was the thing you wanted to show me?”
“First off, why are you putting up the quotation marks? He is a hot piece of ass. You should’ve seen him, shame that you were busy with a convention that day.”

It’s loud and dark when they go down the stairs. LED party lights are scattered everywhere, firing colourful lights into every corner of the room. There are a few bodyguards, each of them posted against a wall, to ensure safety. The thing that strikes Toni the most is how colossal the place is; from outside, no one would’ve been able to tell that the basement is this vast.
“Do you want to come home with me? I have... some cool stuff I wanna show you. I’ll send a tow truck for your bike if it's necessary.” Steve cracks a smile and glances down at his shoes shyly, as if he's been waiting for something like that for some time, before looking back up. Toni finds the whole thing endearing as fuck.
“It's okay,” Steve says, smiling gently. “We're doing better now but we were poor when I was very little. Sometimes, the shitty places we lived in didn't have any heat in the winter. Building a fort helped keep me warm, because the space between the blankets was small enough to be warmed by a little electric heater. I was sick a lot when I was a kid. So I would spend a lot of time between blankets like that, trying my best to keep warm. We couldn't afford for me to get sick again and run up another medical bill.”
,” she says.
Tony doesn’t let him get away this time. He raises his arms to loop them around Steve’s neck, drawing him in for another kiss. He coaxes Steve to deepen the kiss with little nips until his husband concedes with a sharp intake of breath, and their tongues are sliding together as Tony presses in closer. Steve’s hands tighten their grip at his waist, thumbs stroking along the dip of his back where his own ink and Steve’s stamp sits on his skin below the layers of his suit, and Tony burns with the need for
“Wanna come inside you,” Steve rasps, sounding wrecked, even though Tony’s the one who still feels the stretch of Steve’s cock in the crick of his jaw.
Steve finally fully turns to look at him. “Yeah?”
Instead of replying, Tony takes one of Steve's hands and guides him down between his legs to where he's still wet and dripping with Steve from earlier. He can hear the hitch in Steve's breathing as he guides two of Steve's fingers in and arches back against the pillows with a loud moan.
After a stretch of silence that is far too long not to be suspicious, Tony pokes his head out of his blanket to glare over at Natasha, Natasha who is—on
Tony isn’t sure whether to scowl or smile like a fool, and he somehow ends up doing both. He’s sure he looks insane, but he can’t stop.
Tony notices the slight discomfort in Steve too, probably because the last time they were together in public a few days ago, a new photo of them ended up circulating on Twitter. Tony slides his arm around Steve’s waist and squeezes softly. Steve pauses in his examination of the placard at the foot of the stegosaurus skeleton to give him a small warm smile that sets a flock of butterflies aflutter in Tony’s belly. It’s foolish for Tony to feel this way just because Steve is standing next to him in public on a fake date.
Tony is about to say more and bury Pepper in an avalanche of praise when his phone shrills with Howard’s ringtone and Tony feels as though a bucket of ice has been poured over him. He’s sitting frozen as he stares blankly down at the phone in his hand, and it’s so fucking stupid that he’s such a coward when it comes to his own father, but dread washes over him at the thought of speaking to Howard. His father doesn’t usually call unless there’s something urgent, or he’s very angry, and Tony does not want to pick up.
“Oh darling boy,” Maria says dreamily. “One day someone will love you this much too.”
“Go to sleep, Tony.”
“That wasn't even the worst of it,” Bucky says.
Their school group gets one of the smaller side buildings to themselves, but it's no less luxurious with high beamed ceilings and a huge common room. There's a sprawling fireplace that dominates an entire wall crowned with a rack of antlers. The floors are piled with fur pelt rugs, armchairs and couches scattered in front of the fire to create a warm semi circle as snow drifts steadily down outside the huge picture windows. All of the guest rooms are comfortable and spacious, dressed with soft grey wools and sheepskin rugs. Tony has to admit he’s impressed as he sets his bags down in the room Steve claimed for the both of them.
“Leave ‘em on, baby,” Steve says, slackening his hand again to rub gentle circles along the base of Tony’s neck. Every so often, his fingers catch against the chain Tony wears with Steve’s dog tags.
Uncle Obie greets Tony warmly enough, but the glare his father directs at him is enough to freeze Tony's blood in his veins. He can see the glass tumbler of amber liquid sitting on the desk by his father’s hand and there's a flush high on his cheeks. He knows what that means, but Starks are brave, so he stands taller and raises the bot in his hands to show his dad.
“Let me show you what I see,” Steve begs. “You seem to have forgotten how beautiful you are, Tony, and how much I want you. I’ll always want you, always have. I want you to see that.”
Steve shrugs. “I figured as much. Which was why I didn't just shove you away,” he points out archly. He pours Tony a cup of coffee from the pot.
Today will be the day Tony finally works up the nerve to tell Steve this can’t go on for much longer. They either make this fake relationship real, or Steve puts Tony out of his misery and goes back to Peggy. He nods as he packs up for the day. He slams his locker shut with a decisive
Christmas Eve dinner is warm and full of laughter and Sarah insists on piling Tony’s plate with her delicious cooking until he's about to explode. Then, she stuffs him some more with mincemeat pie and chocolate mousse until he begs for mercy. Satisfied, Sarah bids them good night soon after dinner with a kiss on the cheek for each of them, and heads up to her room early.
Tony can’t help the warmth that swells in his chest when he watches Steve at work. The realization comes that he’s never seen Steve concentrate on something so hard before, outside of football. He must be working on something important.
“I have so much left to do,” Tony sighs, trying to give Steve an out. “I'm not going to be any fun tonight.”
He barely realizes what he's said, but the sound of the pen stops for a brief moment before resuming. He drifts off again as he feels gentle fingers comb through his hair and there's a whispersoft kiss pressed tenderly to his forehead. He smiles and lets the susurration of pen and paper lull him back to sleep.
Steve hums noncommittally, his eyes intent and nearly black. “Something like that,” he replies, his hands gentle as he guides Tony to turn onto his front.
“I wish you could see how perfect you look like this,” Steve rasps, his throat achingly tight, “how gorgeous you look spread out underneath me.” Steve wishes he has the words to tell Tony he would move worlds for him, but there are no words in any language in the universe that can be enough to illustrate how Steve feels. His clumsy tongue tries anyways. “I wish you could know how much I love you, how much I’ll always love you. Nothing will ever change that.”
He's too scared to do anything like try to kiss her or hold her hand at camp, but he thinks of asking her on a date after they go home for the summer. He thinks they can work despite being on opposite sides of the country. He's in New York and she's in Malibu, but it's surely worth a try, because who else can understand him like Janet can? Maybe she loves him too. Probably.
“Maybe when I was like, five,” Tony replies, still perplexed as he finds himself staring at Steve covering the nest of blankets he made on the floor.
Every gear in Tony's brain freezes and locks, grinding to an abrupt halt. So the rumors are true. He supposes that's why Steve has been moping around in the hallways for the entirety of October.
“Please, Happy,” Steve says, an edge of desperation in his voice. “I just need to talk to Tony.”
“It's not a competition, Steven,” Tony sniffs haughtily. “It's unnecessary pain is what it is.”
“Hold onto that for me,” Steve had told him, pulling on the collar of the letterman so it laid flat, long fingers carefully brushing over where his scripted name was embroidered on Tony's chest. His blue eyes were dark in the low light and his voice was rumbling bass deep as he pressed his words with a soft kiss to Tony's cheek, his lips grazing the corner of Tony's mouth.
“Hey!”
“The news cycle must be real slow to talk about retirees like us again,” Steve says dryly.
. He lost
“Let’s go to the kitchen,” Steve says when he finally gets his laughter under control. “You're staying for dinner. Mom won't hear otherwise, trust me,” he adds when Tony starts to protest. “So we might as well get our asses up now and go help, before she gives us worse shit about walking in on us.”
one,” he replies, knowing the teasing laughter behind his voice belies the truth. He's delighted to see Steve's smile crack into a wide grin.
“My point is, she understands, Tony,” Steve says. “She's happy for us. She sees that you make me smile and walk around like a fucking moron with my head in the clouds all the time, because all I can think about is you. She sees that you make me happy because I fucking lo—I
Natasha and Loki pack up most of the electronics Tony doesn't use anymore for donation, despite his protests that they can be cannibalized for parts. They sort through his stacks of books and papers and comes up with boxes of outdated texts for recycling and old textbooks to give to the library. They clear out most of his enormous closet and help sort his clothes and shoes and boxes of miscellaneous crap into piles of Keep, Donate, and Burn.
“A what,” Tony says, not quite understanding. He's still confused when a pillow hits him in the chest and he blinks down at it, not comprehending.
“This is way too fucking deep for Star Trek,” Tony groans, deflecting and desperately trying to bring the light mood back.
Tony hands the tablet back to Steve and watches as he signs on the dotted lines, curving his signature beneath the clause that reads:
In his disappointment, Tony barely registers the metal that now gleams on Steve’s wrists until his husband outstretches his hand to beckon him close.
—fuck me already.”
Tony can tell Steve is barely restraining himself from thrusting up sharply into the heat of his mouth. He starts bobbing his head along the length of Steve’s cock, swallowing and sucking hard with each slide down, his hand wrapping around what he can’t fit in his mouth. He can feel his swollen lips stretched obscenely wide around Steve, and he looks up at his husband through his damp lashes and the fogged lenses of his glasses to see Steve watching him. The blue of his eyes are a thin ring around his wide black pupils.
“Is the batter supposed to be that color?” Loki asks, peering over his shoulder.
“Hey, is now a bad time to ask if you want to go to prom with me?” Steve deadpans and Tony can’t help it, but laughter bubbles out of him and soon they’re both laughing, unable to stop.
Even from across the room, he can pinpoint exactly where Peggy Carter is sitting with her friends and he feels her gaze the second her eyes land on their table, and on them.
and let him have waffles and ice cream for dinner. Where she gave him quarters for the jukebox and bopped her head to “You Can't Hurry Love.” Where her touch was warmer and her smiles were brighter. Where she sighed and told Jarvis who looked very sad when she said, “just give me another minute and I'll be ready to leave, Edwin.”
It's as though the floodgates have been opened, and Steve is both incorrigible and insatiable. He takes every opportunity to kiss Tony. He would reel him in for a quick peck in the halls, and pull him into little niches and empty classrooms for longer presses of lips with tongue and teeth and wandering hands. Steve meets him every afternoon at his locker, and they go home together to spend quiet golden evenings in bed, loath to leave for anything at all.
Tony laughs hollowly. “I don't have time to play video games. I’m way too busy building actual weapons of mass destruction for Howard in my spare time.”
“Tony,
Steve had always known he would be Tony’s forever. He had resisted the notion on the Quinjet a lifetime ago standing beside two gods, refusing to rise to the bait of a sad man wearing a mask that’s cracking at the seams far too similar to his own. He had been a coward in the dark of night in a farmhouse with danger rising with the morning sun on the horizon curve and their own unknowing destruction not far ahead. He had slunk away in shame and regret and sorrow in the cold tundra bunker in Siberia, his shield and soul left on the concrete floor with no hope for forgiveness, and no king’s share of gold could’ve been enough to seal the pieces of his heart back together again. He had thought he was too late when invaders fell out of the sky with a hail of fire and tar, and they all had to answer the call to arms the universe over, only to lose in the end, and he’d thought the other half of his soul was gone, gone, gone. His heart had broken when Tony stepped off of the Benatar and into Pepper’s arms, to move on away from Steve and cobble together the scraps of a life from the ashes, deserving of every happiness Steve could not give him.
Tony ignored the rest of the team’s catcalls and wolf whistles as he kissed Steve goodbye, telling him he'll see him after they bring home the state title. He was about to turn and leave when he sneezed, the thin material of the old football jersey doing little to keep out the winter cold. Steve had smiled fondly at him and shrugged off his own team jacket, a red and blue monstrosity that he draped carefully across Tony's shoulders. It was still warm from Steve's body heat.
Steve looks like he's trying his best not to laugh. “Oh poor you. I once waited over an hour during a snowstorm, only for them to finally announce they were closing the station.”
“Fine,” Steve sighs. “Since you have so many stipulations, I’d like to add my own. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.”
On the first day, he can barely get out of bed. He wakes up with his face wet with tears after a handful of hours of fitful sleep and wishes he didn’t have to go to school. He stubbornly drags himself to class, ignores every single one of Steve's attempts to talk to him and pointedly walks in the opposite direction when Clint and Bucky try to get his attention. His phone blows up with missed calls and messages. He ignores every single one of them. He blocks Natasha’s phone number.
Tony’s borrowed time is almost up. Even if the farce isn’t ended by Steve, Howard will make sure it’s over soon. He can’t afford to have Tony so constantly distracted, not when SI’s future is on the line and Tony is leaving for MIT in a few short months. Even Howard concedes he won’t have as much time for company work with college courses and bigger projects. After all, he expects Tony to get several degrees in the next couple of years.
“Oh,” Tony says, catching on. “Our fake dates. You don’t—we don’t really have to do those if you don’t want to, you know.”
“What are you doing?” he squawks, vaulting over his bed to snatch it back.
“Anthony….” Jarvis begins.
“There’s no greater joy to me than seeing your smile in the mornings, hearing your laugh, listening to you talk about your newest projects, the rapid fire thoughts I can’t hope to keep up with. I'm the luckiest man in the universe because you let me see these private intimate parts of yourself. I marvel often at how perfectly you fit in my arms, and how anyone can be as bright and beautiful and amazing and smart as you.”
It lurches something in Tony’s stomach, wrenching and aching, and he can’t watch for any longer. Before he knows it, he’s walking again, heading down to the labs to find Bruce.
“There is no
Steve’s hair is darker when it’s wet, water dripping into the line of his beard and he reaches up with one hand to smooth the strands off his forehead. His swim shorts are sitting dangerously low on his hips, leaving little to the imagination where it clings to his thighs. Tony almost yelps in protest when Steve adjusts the waistband, pulling the shorts up, and he looks up to catch Tony staring.
The stadium where the championship game is held is huge and packed to the brim by the time Tony arrives. The fluorescent lights are blindingly bright overhead, washing everything cold and white. The seats are sectioned in a clear division of team loyalty, a sea of green and grey to the right clashing with an ocean of red and blue.
Tony doesn't want it to end, not when it feels so good to be in Steve's arms and to feel his touch and to see the adoration reflected in Steve's eyes, misdirected and misguided as it is.
The new Avenger, Carol is a streak in the sky outside, a miraculous blaze that makes Tony ache for the embrace of one of his suits and the hum of repulsor fire beneath his feet, but the thought of encasing himself in metal even if it’s his own armor makes bile rise in his throat.
“Yep,” Tony says blithely. “Now, if that’s all—”
asked him to do this. I knew what the end result would be, but I didn't know—” he rubs absently at his chest. “I didn't know how
Toni tiptoes and presses a kiss on both of his cheeks, the last one deliberately too close to his mouth. She then turns around and heads back inside the mansion while texting, presumably to the people she's giving a lift to. She looks back at Steve one last time, while holding the entrance door, and they smile at each other, before she disappears out of his sight.
