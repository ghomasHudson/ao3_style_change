"Morning," Steve greets the three Avengers in the kitchen as he walks in, fresh from the shower. It's 6 AM and Bruce and Thor haven't still left their floors, but the two ex-SHIELD agents and the captain are all early risers, and Tony....well, Tony's sleep pattern was rubbish anyway. He'd gone to bed (in his own room, thank you very much) around 1 AM and then fallen asleep closer to 3 AM before waking up covered in cold sweat. Rose and Rick had still been sleeping when he got up and got down to the common floor.
In the end, Tony had added some security systems to the route that the breach had come through, and called it a day. Apparently, that had been a mistake. A costly one.
He had been hung there for at least some hours and his arms had officially switched from numb to leaden at some point. It would be fine with him, since at least now he couldn't feel the throbbing of his abraded wrists, but it was getting tougher to move them around now that he had been there for some time already.
"Follow the Iron Man armor," he instructs as he passes, even while the people seem more than eager to do just that.
The hands returned to his shoulders, keeping him still. "Easy," Bates told him, and Tony noticed that his breathing had sped up considerably. He tried to calm himself down again, find that courage from a couple of minutes ago, but it was hard. Impossibly hard.
Steve felt nauseated at thought and lifted his gaze from the brass table in front of him, eyeing his teammates to distract himself. He'd just delivered the bad news and paused for a moment to let them sink in.
They split up, Barton and Rose taking off to find them a table, and Tony and Rogers walking to the line leading to the cashier, so that they can give their orders. Tony is paying, although he'd almost lost it when on their way to the shop Rogers had been insisting he'd do the paying. The omega was grateful for the captain's consideration, and tried to remember that the soldier came from a different era — one where it would've been outrageous to let an omega pay for themselves — but when the alpha still wasn't willing to understand where Tony was coming from — that he didn't need an alpha to take care of him, especially when it came to money, thank you very much — he'd begun all out arguing with Rogers. That was when Rogers seemed to get that Tony wasn't going to budge, and that this was a matter that would best be left to be, thus he'd relented, even apologizing to the omega. It was obvious that Rogers wanted to keep their budding friendship intact, even if it meant not being able to follow through with all of his principles. Tony'd calmed down with a huff, and Barton had just rolled his eyes at them, guiding Rose along with a hand on her small shoulder.
The only competent part of the whole kidnapping gig so far, had been the part where they had successfully snatched Tony off of a street, and even that had its major weak spots. And the only person that actually seemed to know what the hell he was doing was Bates, and yet here Tony was; still stuck with these two tools.
The alpha has a deathly pallor to his skin, which is otherwise littered with purple bruises or covered up with white bandages, and while the beeping of the heart monitor is steady and strong, the rise and fall of his chest seems too artificial and shallow. In addition to the ventilator and the heart monitor, Steve is also hooked up to an IV drip and a leg bag, and really, Tony is no rookie to standing near hospital beds with people he knows in them, but hell, this one takes the cake.
"Morning, Cap," he replies, not turning from where he's loading the coffee machine. He pushes the on button when he's ready.
he consoled himself.
Perhaps Tony had underestimated Ezekiel's fury, since it seemed that the man was as livid as ever after a few unadvised words from Tony.
. He was constantly picking a fight with Tony, then acting as if he hadn't expected Tony to answer to fire with fire.
"Do you need the rest of us with you there?"
I just realised that I messed up some timelines in chapter 2 *author is cowering in a corner with tears of frustration glistening in her eyes*
He feels himself blushing. "Why are you thanking me? You're not supposed to be thanking me. It's the other way around." He pauses briefly, awkwardly. "So, thanks," he continues, lamely, and exits his kitchen. "And don't break anything!" he calls back when he's out the doorway, and hears Rogers bark out a laugh at the comment.
Tony let out a frustrated sound when the bodyguard pulled out two padlocks and closed them around the loops on the buckles, finalizing Tony's fate for the time being with two soft
Steve looks him in the eye, as if assessing Tony's honesty regarding his words. Finally, he nods solemnly.
"Good afternoon, Omega Stark," he says and Tony smiles at the use of 'Stark' instead of 'Darrow' that he sometimes gets.
Steve takes the piece of art gingerly, bringing it near his face for closer examination. His eyes stray briefly to Tony, before landing on the toddler in his lap.
Tony glanced down at the prints, then shrugged. "Not a fan, to be honest. Major design flaws. But at least that's consistent with the rest of Hammer Industries' products."
After a beat, when Tony still doesn't budge, Rick grabs his wrist. Tomorrow there'll be an imprint of his hand circling it, Tony's sure.
Hey, sorry it's been a while, but here you go!
paying for all, just to be clear) and getting their drinks — an Americano with an extra shot of espresso for Tony, a dark roast coffee with skimmed milk for Rogers, a frappé topped with whipped cream for Barton and a small strawberry sundae for Rose — they walk deeper into the shop to find the other two.
"Yeah, I've heard about your sister's husband, even met him," he replies tersely, straining away from Rick's hand and against the one on his neck as subtly and passively as he can. He's really not feeling it right now.
Especially
Rick or even miss him when he's gone, and he hates his traitorous body for making him so dependent on another human being.
, this man drove him
Now that he was up and about once more, Bates had strung him up again, the chain of his cuffs caught in the hook near the top end of the pole. His arms were stretched high above his head and it felt horrible on his back; a couple of the welts had opened up and began weeping blood into his new shirt, and the burn from the stretch on the muscles on his back and shoulders made him gasp for breath.
Steve looked a bit startled by the notion. "How would they even know to look for trackers?"
Marco let go of him to pull out a chair and Becker unceremoniously pushed him down to sit in it, ignoring the pained hiss Tony couldn't quite contain when his bruised flesh hit the wooden surface. He kept his hands on Tony's shoulders, preventing any further movement out of his seat.
"You've done a great job in raising her so far," he praises, as if sensing Tony feeling guilty over Rose not having enough playmates. The omega feels himself flush in turn.
"Hey," the alpha greets absently, going straight for the coffee that Tony had just brewed. Tony just hums into his own mug as he takes another sip. His eyes are glued to the tablet in his hand where he's looking over the last known location of his teammates on the map, for probably the millionth time. He switches to the email app when he hears Rick approach him behind his back.
"The next-generation transistor thing? Yeah, I was there." He grabs the nearest tablet and makes a note for himself. "On it. But don't expect to gain much from it. Most of their ideas were shit. I won't be passing those along."
"Actually, yeah," Tony said, gasping when Ezekiel's fingers pressed down on a laceration, "but you know, I'm stuck in a basement with some weirdo so—"
Seeing his three teammates all battered up and in varying states of consciousness feels just as bad as it sounds, if not worse. Clint, who is sitting up on his medical cot, sports a collection of bruises and cuts on the left side of his head, and apparently banged his head hard enough to cause his left hearing aid to start failing. Natasha, who is lying in her cot unconscious and under sedation, since she had been operated just a few hours ago. Something about shrapnel, was what Tony had been told, and he'd shuddered at that, the ghost of his arc reactor twinging in his chest.
He had gathered all the Avengers in the compound into the common space living room, taking his usual seat by the end of the coffee table. The plush cushion felt good beneath him and made him feel even worse; here he was, sitting in the world's most comfortable chair while Tony was God knows where, taken away against his will, being tortured for all he knew.
Anyhow, thanks for reading! Please, leave a comment and tell me if you liked the new chapter :)
He brought the baton down again, pressing it beneath Tony's chin. "But you do really know your way around this stuff. Even this little thing," he shocked Tony again and Tony ground his teeth together as he convulsed, "it looks so innocent, yet with correct settings it can kill a man with one little push of a button."
"You'll need your hands tomorrow," he said simply, watching Tony stiffly rub his arms up and down.
"Don't talk back to me," he growled at Tony.
Tony wants to growl at the deliberately patronizing, sweet tone of voice Rick directs at him. Instead, he replies almost mellowly, "Sure," and places the tablet on the side table, on top of Rick's tie and his briefcase. Rick's hand moves to card a lock of hair back over his forehead when the omega leans closer, and traces his fingers down to his neck when Tony leans back, now hands free of the tablet. His index finger dips beneath the collar of Tony's t-shirt and he pulls out the necklace he gave his husband. He smiles when he sees it.
Steve nods. Takes a quick breath and gives the order. Tony let's JARVIS finish the sequence to unlock the doors to the two holding cells and the doors slide open half a second later. An alarm starts blaring.
"Omega Stark," the middle man greets. He's alpha, and so are the two other men by his sides.
When they're done eating, Tony gets Rose to help him clear the table and commands Rogers to pick a wine bottle from the cabinet. He grabs two glasses and heads to the living room with the alpha following hot on his heels. Rose is already off to her room to find something new to play with.
The moment their feet touched the ground, Steve rammed his shield against them. He pinned the shape against a wall behind them, crowding close to them, and listened to their squawk.
He forced his mind back in order, and shot back,
ed softly against the back of his chair. "Yeah, not interested."
After glancing in the mirror and taking in the forming bruises, he swiftly exited the toilet, not willing to risk Becker bursting in and searching him — finding the bobby pin — however unlikely.
"Shutting up would serve you good now," Ezekiel growled into his ear.
"Huh?" he managed.
"There," he says,
"No, Bruce! They almost
"Are you sure about that, Stark?" Ezekiel asked, as if sensing his conflicted thoughts. "I'm not sure when Hammer will be amenable to feed and water you otherwise."
Hammer kept on smiling. "That's right. But oh, my." He laughed again, this time at Tony's appearance rather than his manners. "What happened to your clothes? I'm used to seeing you clad in outfits that are more....well,
They entered the room cautiously; it was dim and spacious, with plastic sheets hanging off of the ceiling. It created an ominous feel to the room, and Steve glanced at Rhodey again as they entered. Rhodey replied to his look with a grimace, his face somewhat blanched.
Dr. Miller smiled again, this time a little condescendingly. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Rogers makes them spaghetti carbonara and ends up finishing the panful together with Tony and Rose. He insist that he'll help Rose with the pasta, so that Tony can eat, because Tony hasn't eaten anything since last night, and
Which is a fair point, Tony has to admit. But it didn't seem like that to him. The man seemed to genuinely know something, and was all too happy to gloat to Tony about it. Normally, Tony would just ask the man himself once he was securely behind the bars, but Steve's shield seemed to have knocked him into a state of coma, so that's out of the question.
feeling.
He took the pin in his hands and turned it over.
He leaned in closer as Tony still processed his words, all of his energy spent on that one confession. "You don't deserve love," Ezekiel continued. He pressed his fingers down on Tony's ribs and Tony groaned. "And yet, you so selfishly crave it." He paused, watching Tony. "Tell me now. You love him, don't you?"
he asked incredulously. The alien walked over to stand next to Spider-Man, her blue skin in strong contrast with his red mask.
"Can I
but he's still asking and making sure that Tony's comfortable and Tony has never been taken care like this before--
"I want to," Steve says, and are those tears in his eyes? "Believe me, Tony, I want to. So badly." He chuckles somewhat wetly and moves as if he's about to leave.
Tony shifted his gaze to his bound hands. He tested the bonds and held back a hiss when the cuffs chafed his raw skin. The zip tie wasn't going to break, and Tony doubted he would be able to slide it from under the bed leg without anyone noticing.
"Ezekiel?" he asked, frowning as he looked the man over. It had been several years since he'd last seen him, but what Tony could remember of him as well as the striking resemblance to his father, Obadiah Stane, were enough to clue him in. This was definitely Ezekiel Stane, in the flesh.
So. It was either crawling in front of Hammer or risking severe dehydration. Great.
"You never fucking
Tony watches Steve's pupils dilate slightly at the mental image, but in the end the chivalrous captain in him seems to win the battle. He sighs, hands dropping to his sides.
Tony just smiles and doesn't bother correcting Rogers. Let him have his beliefs that Tony's marriage is a happy and a consensual one. Also, he feels a little dizzy with warmth because Rogers had just called him 'Tony' instead of 'Stark', and he doesn't want to ruin the moment.
company, to be precise."
"Go ahead," he signals to JARVIS then, and can hear an audio feed turning on with the slightest static at the beginning. "I'm alone, who's this?" he says in one breath, moving towards his bedstand to pick up the tablet laid there, so that his hands have something to fiddle with.
"Thank you, Rose. I like it a lot." Rose beams up at him, and seems to take that as encouragement to talk her head off, since the outpour of questions that had been staunched for the time being starts up again.
And now it was out there — he had admitted to it.
"Hey," Thor protests the backhanded compliment, which goes ignored by Steve. Bruce pats him consolingly. He shares a knowing look with Tony, who sighs, knowing what Bruce is getting at. Steve's a little jittery, probably because this is the first mission since their botched undercover one. Yikes. Tony thinks it's probably no wonder the man is a tad irritable.
"I don't know, Steve!" Jim exclaimed, the sentence bursting out of him almost involuntarily. He slammed the box to Steve's chest as he turned to him. "These bastards clearly knew what the hell they were up against. Believe me, Tony has had his fair share of kidnappings, and grabbing him is no easy task. Especially these days, when he's as paranoid as they come."
Fury says abruptly and the call cuts off. Tony draws in a large breath before clapping his hands together.
Jim watched as Steve peered carefully into the box. He had carefully scanned everything at the scene, recording all with FRIDAY's cameras and sensors to inspect later in greater detail. He had bagged the evidence — Tony's phone, glasses and some discarded articles of clothing — and taken them with him, so the forensics could look them over.
The years fly past, blurred by alcohol, inventing, verbal and physical fights with Rick, and Tony doesn't feel sorry for not getting knocked up. Even though the omega part of his brain makes him hate himself for being unable to give his alpha a child, the rational part is overjoyed about not getting the short end of the stick for once. Rick isn't happy, as expected — thus, neither of them is really happy. But you can't always have it all, right?
," he points at Tony, "you know that I have no other heir for the Stark Industries. How am I supposed to train you now?!"
Becker breathed harshly for a while longer, but eventually both of his hands left Tony. The tension bled out of Tony's shoulders.
"What a surprise," he said, returning his gaze back towards Ezekiel. "I haven't seen you since—"
Finally, we've got some fluff and Tony being happy for once *_* Gotta warn you, though, Rick's coming back home next chapter..... :P boo
But even Tony's security wasn't going to cut it this time, because just then a car screeched into a stop by the end of the alley. He caught a glimpse of it once they were close enough; it was a black van.
"He wasn't your patient," Rhodey hissed down at her. "He didn't want you to operate on him."
Tony tried to hold the shame that flooded his system at bay, because he knew that shaming him was exactly what Ezekiel was aiming for, but he couldn't. He just couldn't, and the age-old burn of embarrassment flared from somewhere deep within his gut, traveling across his body all the way to his extremities. He could hear Howard's voice in his ears, comparing him to Steve, mocking him, and all those others that had come and gone along the years, commenting on his worthiness and lack thereof to stand next to Captain America or on his position against him regarding the Accords. He could hear himself there with all of them, questioning himself and his choices.
Ezekiel grabbed him by the back of his neck and bashed his face into the pole. Tony felt the skin above his right brow splitting open and blood begun trickling down his face.
The next mission is in the early June when they have gathered enough intel to breach the second HYDRA base. This mission is less volatile than the last, with less risk factors such as civilians or underground conditions. It's a simple plan; infiltrate, subdue and cleanup.
thanks for reading :) leave a comment, thank u
"My confession?" Tony asked. Ezekiel didn't say anything else, just watched Tony as he straightened up into his full height. He stepped over Tony and walked back up to the table.
His lungs had stopped working at some point and he had to grip onto the chair, driving his nails into the wood until he felt a nail break. The pain made him gasp a breath in, and he blinked as he forced himself to focus.
So, the moment the alpha makes to grab him, Tony delivers a sharp kick to her forearm, aligning himself with her chest. He spits in her face when one of her hands finds the fabric of his under armor shirt and blasts her against the wall with the unibeam. She's unconscious the moment her head collides with the wall.

"They must've used a scrambler or something similar," he muttered darkly, frown on his face as he leaned in, pulling up the box he'd tossed in earlier. "There have been no blips on FRIDAY's radar and it's been several hours now. They could've taken the implants out by now, for all I know."
and afterwards you will still wear it." He lets go of Tony's face, but doesn't break their eye contact. "I would hate for Rose to wake up to your cries." The words make Tony flinch, his instincts going haywire as they scream at Tony to submit to his alpha and to fight the threat — his alpha — to protect his child. Rosie comes first, always, and Rick knows it. Tony watches as the alpha smirks at his reaction, sensing and smelling and plain old

"Come on," Rhodey interrupted his musings, "Chin up, Rogers. We've got more rooms to search."
Steve met Rhodey's gaze, studying him. He swallowed as he dreaded the word he was about to utter.
"I have been informed that you're having some microchips removed, as well as," she extended her index finger, tapping the glass of Tony's nanoparticle housing unit, completely ignoring his flinch at the action, "taking that out."
After what felt like an eternity, they finally emerged from the staircase. A bathroom was just around the corner and Tony was grateful he didn't need to climb up the second set up to the topmost floor.
She pulled him off of his chair, throwing him away from it, and he only remained standing because Bates was there to catch him. He steadied him and gave him a rough shove forward, causing pain to flare up along Tony's back as he aggravated the bruising there.
"Cap's doing just fine," Tony bites out, spoon digging into his dessert as he savors the taste. "He sometimes helps out with Rosie, as do the rest of the team. Why?" He knows exactly why Rick's asking, but if Rick's going to go down this path, he might as well work for it.
"Over there," Ezekiel instructed Tony, pointing at a spot on the floor and ignoring Hammer. Tony crawled over, for once grateful to be ordered around since it gave him something to focus on that wasn't Hammer's uncontrollable laughter. "Kneel up."
were wrong. And because of you and your selfishness millions have been harmed and killed. My father—"
"Daddy was being careless and had a little accident, that's all. But it's okay now, honey." Even without looking, he can tell that Steve is watching their interaction with a sad expression, and he tries his best to ignore the alpha.
"I can, actually," Tony said, doing his best to stare Marco down from his spot on the floor. "Most times I just choose not to. Also, fuck you."
"No, I—" Tony begun, pushing himself off of the floor, but Ezekiel kicked him down again and hit him with the cane.
"Shut up," Becker growled at him. He leaned closer, eyeing Tony's face, "Marco is trying to sleep," he added with a touch of sarcasm to his voice. And with that and a rough shove, Tony was released. He watched as Becker walked back over to the sitting area and pulled out his phone once again.
"Nat, Clint and I are leaving on a mission in a couple days," he says in a low voice, and Tony frowns at him. "Nat found another Hydra base."
Tony smiles a crooked, a little sad smile up at Steve. "Correct."
crawl up the stairs and into the dining room, while Hammer hadn't managed to get one corrected blueprint out of him.
He stood up and began pacing the space. They would need to start the looking somewhere. He crossed his arms across his abdomen, lost in thought.
He had summoned one of the suits still in the workshop beneath the penthouse floor, then flown a couple of miles before he'd been shot down to the sea. That's when JARVIS had taken over and in turn flown him all the way to Tennessee. From there he leaves a message to Pepper, trusting his long time personal secretary, nowadays a COO thanks to the promotion Tony'd arranged her two and a half years ago, the highest she could get within the company without being the CEO, and his dear friend, to get it and inform others that he was still alive and kicking.
He didn't know much, but he gave up all the names he did. His friend Ed Adams, whom he had introduced to the whole criminal business. His boss Bates, to whom he had worked for previously. Two men he had met that night, Marco and Becker, who had been responsible for delivering Tony to wherever he had been wanted. Two drivers, a man and a woman, whose names he didn't know. The doctor, whom he had been tasked with paying.
"I don't care," Ezekiel replied, curt with a calm and cold voice. He leaned closer, looming over Tony. Tony was reminded startlingly of Obadiah as fury contorted Ezekiel's face. "My wife died because of you. And she was only one of the countless number of people that you've killed.
"Not my strong suit," Tony quipped, almost involuntarily because it just came so easily for him, and almost regretted it when Ezekiel changed the hold he had on his neck to cut off his air supply.
"Hey," Back Pain said from Tony's other side. "Chill, man. It's all good."
"Let's just go," he ended up saying eventually, looking at the floor as he stepped past Rhodey.
"Bring him downstairs for me," Ezekiel said, eyes still on Tony as he stripped out of his suit jacket, handing it to one of the women trailing after him. "A chair will do this time."
Tony nodded again and shifted his gaze to Becker. He was angry, but also surprised. He glared at Tony for a moment, then looked down at his phone screen again.
"Aye, aye, Captain."
"Shut up already," Marco snapped. He sighed again and stood up, walking over to the door where the plastic bag was still lying. Tony watched him pick it up and eye the contents. "Just tase him or something. We'll need to get the hell out of this place anyway. You get our stuff and I'll bring the car around so we can toss him in without anyone noticing."
"You should've put your parka on," Natasha tells him, warm in her own heavily padded tactical winter gear.
"You watch your mouth, you—" Becker's heated tirade was cut off by the sudden burst of laughter. It took him a second, but Tony recognized the sound of it.
Tony frowns, his jaw clenching. "If you were left stranded then this was Fury's fault. He should've made sure you had back up if things went south."
He nearly choked on the gag in his mouth when the belt connected with his already sore and bruised flesh again. Becker's hand buried itself into his hair, pressing the side of his face into the carpet beneath him as he leaned over Tony.
After Tony's sacrifice play, his and Rogers' relations warm up immediately. Tony doesn't know why, but seeing the Captain knelt next to him, laughing at his slightly incoherent rambling as he lies on the concrete after Hulk had caught him, makes something uncoil deep in his stomach. He's relieved.
"We were without protection because you, is what I'm saying. After Thor, alien invasions became the new norm. And with the Avengers, so did the destruction of entire cities."
"It's been almost fifteen minutes already," he said curtly, eyeing Tony as he finally managed to pull the t-shirt over himself.
"Cap? Stark?"
.....guys i'm so sorry, i know it's been v long since the last update. i'll just tell you that i've been very busy with work and my thesis, and leave it at that.
Tony hid his wince at Ezekiel's words; he had hit home, right where Tony's biggest insecurities and guilt lay. And Tony was determined to not let him know that.
Steve would be so disappointed were he to see him right now. All those hand-to-hand combat lessons, and here he still was. Lying on the ground like an upturned tortoise.
"Steve, calm down, you're fine," he soothes, although his tone is harsh like it usually is. He isn't a very soothing person by nature. That was trained out of him.
The concrete was rough and cold under his palms and knees, but he crawled across the floor, up the rickety stairs and across the lobby. Ezekiel walked behind him, not seemingly in any hurry.
Tony drew in a shaky breath, swallowing. "We—"
"Yeah, Becker," Tony called, "Relax about it."
"Yes, she is," he simply replies with a smirk at the teacher. "Okay now, kiddo, gather your stuff and we'll get going."
Tony purses his lips. "Get to bed, I'll finish up here and come right after." They usually slept in their bed together after the other had been away, trying to settle their minds and scent each other after being apart. Again, a purely biological urge because of the mating bond they shared, but nevertheless a real one.
"Thanks, cap," the engineer replies and ducks into the elevator before anyone can stop him and ask him whether he's okay or some other shit.
"Good," Ezekiel said, shrugging off his coat. He handed it to his assistant. "Bring him down," he told Bates, then nodded at his own bodyguard, "You go with."
"Hi, baby," Tony says through a yawn. He holds out an arm and Rose curls into it, and assisted by Steve he heaves the little girl up onto his chest.
"Don't you dare—" Tony begun, but the knot was pushed into his mouth and the ends of the cloth were tied together at the back of his head. Marco pushed himself back up to sit on the bed as Tony glared daggers at him.
Of course, even small amount of partying or any one-night stands were unacceptable for an omega, especially for an upper class omega, but Tony was a student and about to enter an arranged marriage and he couldn't give a crap.
"You really don't listen, do you?" Ezekiel asked. He trailed the tip of the baton across Tony's chest, bringing it up below Tony's chin. He used it to tilt the engineer's head up. Tony reluctantly met his gaze. "How frustrating must that be for Captain Rogers, I can't even begin to imagine. No wonder he hates you so."
"Well what?" he played along.
"I've got some work to do," Bruce says and Romanov counters with a mysterious 'same'.
, the custody of (a) possible descendant(s) and the legal rights to the remaining property of both parties. This contract is lawful and valid until the death of either of the parties, until a clause is broken and the contract is redone or until the alpha descendant of ANTHONY STARK takes over the position as the CEO of
Hammer's brow twitched and Tony knew he'd hit a nerve. He composed himself quickly, nevertheless, laughing softly and carding a hand through his hair. "Oh, Anthony. Still the kidder."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sounds about correct."
"Morning," Rick greets him, walking before him with a briefcase in one hand and a sleepy toddler occupying the other. He places a quick peck on Tony's temple as they begin disentangling Rose's arms from around her Father's neck together.
"You got it covered, you big baby."
Come say hi to me on
"And what would those be?"
Tony grins. "Yup."
"Thank you, крошка," Natasha replies and crouches down to let the girl place the flower behind her ear. Tony thinks that the blue compliments well with the flaming red of her hair. Rosie just giggles at the Russian nickname. The assassin is the last one to receive a flower, and Rose looks proud at what she has managed to accomplish. They'd traveled from floor to floor in search of various teammates, and finally ended up on the common floor where the rest, that is Nat and Steve, were, to gift everyone with a cut flower. Tony'd been afraid that Clint was going to burst into moved tears when Rosie had offered him a carnation, purple in colour to match Clint's gear.
Before he was able attain it, Ezekiel had unclipped the chain from Tony's cuffs and tilted the chair, throwing Tony to the floor. He held onto one of Tony's wrists, twisting it painfully behind his back, until he had attached the chain to both of the cuffs again.
"I see. Although, you seem pretty stressed about it," he adds, questioning, and turns his head minutely to eye the slight rise of a a tendon by the side of Tony's neck. Tony just shrugs, although he must admit that his stress levels must be through the roof for Rick to notice the change from the usual. The mating bond urging him to tend to and reassure Tony must be driving him nuts by now.
"Proceed," Steve confirms lowly. "Check point one," he says when they reach their first check point.
"Why your team hasn't come for you already? Why
"Rosie! Rose!" Tony yells.
, just so happened to stumble upon our planet?"
Tony frowns at the question, confused that somebody's asking. "I don't mind it," he replies finally, deliberately leaving out that he actually prefers Rick being out of town rather than at home. The only thing he regrets about that is Rose seeing her Father less often. Rogers presses on,
"What," he grits out, and shakes Bruce's hand off, turning towards Barton but refusing to meet his gaze. He's feeling too raw for that now.
And so, here he was, staring at a wall. Back to square one.
"Hammer wants you to have dinner with him," Bates replied and Tony wanted to groan. Right. He had completely forgotten about Hammer.
He sighs. "You should go get some sleep, you look awful. I'll serve some dinner for Rosie and keep her company until it's bathtime." Tony cranes his head towards his beta friend, and once again is reminded of how perceptive Bruce really is. It seems like he sees through all of Tony's layers and shields, all the way to the most secret corners of his soul that even he knows nothing about. Like he knows how much this is affecting him.
"Hi, peanut," he says, hugging her close to his chest as she twines her small arms around his neck in her customary choke hold. "I missed you."
"Well, what do you think?" he bit back, trying to convey what he thought of Becker's question, while simultaneously attempting to stay subdued. Just thinking about acting meek and obedient in front of Becker caused chills to go down his spine, but he didn't want to anger the man either; he really wasn't feeling up to another roughing.
"It suits you."
That got him the man's attention. He looked up into his eyes, slowly straightening up into his full height so he could tower over Tony. His hands came up to his throat and Tony mentally prepared himself for another choking, his pulse accelerating. But Boss' hands stopped by his bow tie, slowly,
"That wasn't the case this morning, if memory serves," Becker interjected, throwing a disdainful look in Tony's way.
His pal didn't even stand chance after that. Before the one he had punched had even gone down, he had already grabbed the other one by his jacket sleeve, his free arm extended over his throat, and thrown him to the ground with a loud
The ceremony had ended with him and Rick exchanging rings and sharing a kiss on the altar, and then another hymn beginning as they walked out of the church along the aisle. Then it was time for the festivities, which were held in the ballroom of the Stark Mansion, where Tony listened to countless congratulations from the guests and to almost as much unwanted tips for life in marriage from other mated omegas attending the wedding. When one overly enthusiastic omega lady begun giving him tips on how to please his mate in bed and a younger male omega by his other ear tried to apply them to sex between two dudes, he felt like throwing up. He politely excused himself and went to get another flute of champagne from the waiter.
Rogers actually chuckles. "I bet if she's related to you," he says good-naturedly, then apparently catching himself when a slightly horrified expression crosses his face at the somewhat backhanded compliment. Tony just laughs.
The team lands the Quinjet into the open behind the base, the cloaking still activated. There's some coverage, but the trees are tiny because of the horrible coldness and there's snow is up to Tony's thigh where he lands next to the Quinjet. The underground base is very up North, and Tony's grateful for the suit's great insulation. He pities Clint in his thin winter gear.
"Please, I—" Tony let slip, barely able to breathe. He could feel the odd gravity pulling him down and taste the stale air he had breathed in on Titan. He could see Peter turning to ashes before him, clinging onto him and crying,
," he said and chuckled at his own joke.
Tony let out an involuntary noise and looked away from the other man. "I think you've made your point already."
"Why not? It was published in 1929, when Captain Rogers was...hmm, I believe it would be sixteen then. Am I correct, Captain Rogers?"
"My wife," Ezekiel gritted out and struck Tony again, uncaring of the raised welts Tony could feel forming on his back, slowly purpling into bruises or splitting open and weeping blood. Tony cried out, desperately holding back tears of agony. "My
After a while Rick has to leave yet again, and Tony is quick to follow suit, since now that Rosie is being taken care of he has a leeway to take care of SI business outside of the tower more often. He attends a couple of meetings and goes to see R&D before he has to leave so he can pick up Rose, and this time the whole ordeal goes on without any hiccups.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve gritted his teeth again, trying to swallow down the ill feeling he felt when Natasha cut Dr. Miller again and she let out a strangled scream. She hit her, and Steve could tell that Spider-Man had just flinched back.
"I don't," Tony denied, gritting his teeth.
Actually, it's the exact opposite. He sighs as the tension leaves his shoulders and leans more fully into the warm hand at his neck, blatantly displaying his trust and submission to someone other than Rick, his actual alpha. And he doesn't even feel bad about it, since nowadays despite the mating bond, Steve feels like his alpha, too. Maybe it's the pack mentality speaking, with what the Avengers beginning to grow more and more close, or maybe it's something else, who knows. He doesn't really give a damn anymore. Not since he almost lost Steve. As long as he doesn't get caught submitting to Steve, everything should be fine. Right?
, alpha. Even the law said it, although with good attorneys or the right judge that could
He swallowed. "How so?"
By the time they reached the end of the stairs, Ezekiel and Hammer had stopped talking. They stood there, a polite space between them, and turned their heads to look at Tony and Bates as they appeared in their line of sight. Behind Ezekiel stood the same two women that had stood behind him yesterday, and by the front door lingered Marco and Becker. Marco had a backpack slung over one of his shoulders, but Tony couldn't spare more time to study them, since his eyes flew to Ezekiel at the sound of his voice,
, and he trusts him. He really does, he realizes now.
Marco suddenly barked out, "No, you don't! We need to deliver him to—"
She turned to go, but stopped when Tony called after her. She looked over her shoulder at him.
with your name on?! Fuck you!" he spits at Rick's slightly confused expression (only slightly, since Rick knows Tony well enough by now that he hadn't expected a necklace with his own name to go down well. Maybe he just hadn't anticipated that Tony'd be
"Hey, pumpkin. What are you doing in here?"
"But I know tons of alphas!" he says somewhat desperately. He twists his head to glance at Steve. They are walking along a hallway of a SHIELD facility, and the bright overhead lights form dark shadows that accentuate Steve's features. "When did Fury say I would get access to the files HYDRA kept in the base?"
hasn't come for you already?"
"Yes," Bates said, twisting the rope around itself so it was pressed snugly against Tony's chest. Next, Tony felt it wrap around his upper arms. He sighed.
Tony didn't say anything else, and eventually Bates let go of his face.
"It's not my fault I have a company to run," he hisses at Tony.
Tony coughed and pulled his legs under himself to sit up. "Careful with the merchandise," he quipped. With the current treatment, Tony feared soon his bruises would have bruises.
Tony couldn't do anything but stare. The conversation went a little while after that before Alpha Darrow decided it's time they take their leave. The Starks walked the other three to the front door, and Tony couldn't help the shiver that ran up his spine as he caught the smirk Rick shot in his direction. He answered with a glare.
He was struggling with pulling the shirt on when there was a knock at the door and Bates abruptly pushed it open.
Tony has the time to let his eyes go wide before Rick is all but ripping his shirt off of his shoulders, mouthing at the tense muscle there, and pushing Tony between his hard body and the dining table. Tony's wine glass topples over the edge of the table and explodes in a spray of shards by their shoe-clad feet.
After a moment of mutual glaring, Hammer glanced down at Tony's empty plate. "You should eat something, Tony."
, Tony thought,
"Maybe you'll get her to wake up," he says in way of an explanation, the lines of his mouth tight as he eyes Rose in Romanov's arms. The toddler just blinks curiously up at the owner of the new arms around her.
, was what Becker was, Tony realized. And not the sexy kind, but the kind that would inflict pain and fear and revel in it, regardless of whether he had consent or not. Regardless of whether the one he was hurting was even enjoying themselves. Tony supposed the thought of an unwilling victim might even turn him on, what with the way the man was currently panting.
The bodyguard had walked over to a table by the wall and was returning now with a brown paper bag. She crouched before Tony and pulled out a sturdy-looking leather cuff from the bag.
He mourned after the housing unit, wondering what had happened to it after it had been taken out. He hoped it hadn't ended up in the wrong hands, albeit it was equipped with enough firewalls and fail-safes not to cause him to worry too much.
"Then why do they call you the Merchant of Death? Why do they hate you? Why were the Sokovia Accords ever proposed?" Ezekiel stepped to stand in front of him again. "I thought you agreed with them. You were one of those who signed, yes?"
"There should be some kiddie puzzles in that drawer over there," he says in between bites, pointing a finger towards the said drawer. Steve takes the hint and carries Rose over to the drawer, and takes out a block puzzle. Rose is particularly good with logical thinking (which, really isn't a surprise with her genes), and Tony likes to have her developing those skills from time to time.
"I know you did," Steve tells him, and he sounds sincere, so Tony let's it drop.
eat, if that's what you were wondering. Plenty, too."
Steve's voice was in the other, telling him to walk it off and get the hell up.
"What contract?" Steve grits out. Tony swallows.
"You must be famished then," Ezekiel stated controversially. He stopped walking, turning to look down at Tony. "I'll tell you what, you follow me upstairs, I'll make sure someone fixes you up with something."
Finally, the part that everyone — except Tony — had been eagerly waiting for came. "Do you, Alpha Richard Terrence Darrow, take Omega Anthony Edward Stark to be your lawfully wedded mate, and promise to protect him and to provide for him, in good times and in bad, until death do you part?"
"Paperwork. Boring," he replies easily, and Rick lets out a low sound of acknowledgement.
Tony felt sick. In fact, yes, he had noticed, he had been alerted of a security breach to his servers, but the access had been terminated quickly enough for him to not loose his sleep over it, despite all his paranoia. He had assumed it was a rookie from SHIELD, trying their luck at one of the sturdiest firewalls in the country. FRIDAY had attempted to trace the hacker's IP address, but they had been using a proxy server to hide it.
"Stand him up," Ezekiel was saying and Bates was quick to grab Tony by his upper arms, pulling him up and angling his hands towards the ceiling. Tony noticed a hook screwed to the pole, high above his head.
"Jarvis, what is—"
She looks uncharacteristically still for a moment, before clumsily turning the paper over for Tony to see. Drawn with an uneven outline and colored messily, but with obvious precision, is a picture of two human-shaped figures standing outside, the other dressed in a blue full-body suit, and the other, the smaller figure, in an orange dress. The blue-clad figure is holding a round object with red circles and a star drawn on it, and the two figures are holding hands and smiling while bright yellow sun shines over them in the sky. Tony's heart almost stops beating as he lays his eyes on the picture.
"Kind of," Rick replies, shrugging and walking past Tony to place his briefcase on a side table by the wall. His hands move up to loosen his tie. "R&D messed something up again, but the new tech lead got it under control. Also, now that I remember; you'll need to review and sign a few papers by tomorrow evening. We need to send them along by the day after that. You were in that meeting about it, right?"
After twenty minutes of settling her down, covered in snot and tears by the end of it, and while attempting to reign in his own instinct and emotion induced tears, he had managed to leave the kindergarten that morning, but only to white knuckle the ride back to the tower and then beat the living shit out of the mu ren zhuang at their gym.
Tony graduates from MIT with two master’s degrees the year he turns nineteen. By that time, he's already figured out probably every loophole to the contract, spent nights after nights awake trying to come up with a way to wiggle himself out of this massive clusterfuck, and, so far, hasn't been able to think of even one qualified reason that would let him walk free. It's frustrating to say the least, and he locks the anger and the fear for his future somewhere deep within himself for later exploration.
Tony exclaims, mock-offended. He starts walking again and Steve matches his pace.
"Marco," Becker slurred, but Marco was about as useful as Tony at the moment. Tony listened to Becker's scoff, and then he was being dragged over to the duffel bag by the wall.
I promise we will be seeing some progress soon. Tony will get out eventually.
Tony watches them for a brief moment, calculating his chances of taking all three by himself. He decides that bidding his time would serve him best if his wish is to not get killed. "So you, what, run this place? Want to spill the beans on that, instead? About the people you've been keeping here?"
It's that evening, when Rosie's in bed and Rick is somewhere a couple of states over, when Steve comes up to his floor. He brings his Stark Tech phone as an excuse, asking for Tony to help him adjust the screen settings, but Tony can see right through him, probably because he feels the same way; Steve just wants to spend time with him.
"I know that it isn't well-spread information, but my Mother, who raised me practically all by herself, was an omega. So, no, I do not appreciate literature that degrades omegas like her. Or, any other omega. Such as Tony, for example." Steve looks quickly at Tony, and Tony, for some unknown reason, feels relieved. Relieved to be sure that Steve isn't like so many other alphas.
She didn't know other names in addition to Taylor's, but she had spoken to a man that matched Taylor's description of Marco. For a deal with the prosecutor, she was willing to divulge the conversation they had shared.
"Don't act surprised," she told Steve, the usual irritation present in her voice. Prior to this, Steve had exchanged only a few words with her in total, but the alien was...
It had almost gone all the way to court when Rick hadn't been willing to comply, but when Nick Fury had intervened, directly contacting the other alpha, he had suddenly made a complete turnabout. Tony wasn't sure what the director of SHIELD had told his company's CEO, but it couldn't have been anything good, deducing from his reaction to it. Or, alternatively, it had been something
"Yeah," is what he ends up replying.
"What's up?" he asks, bending down from the waist to look over Tony's shoulder. The omega is seated in his usual spot on the sofa, back against the armrest, and the alpha is stood right behind him on the floor.
"I want you to give me a very good explanation to what
"Well?" Hammer said, crossing his arms over his chest and smiling proudly down at Tony. Tony did his best to let his glare translate exactly what he thought of the man.
Steve commands. Tony rolls his eyes at him, but doesn't disobey. Although, he does descend a little, circling around to keep the base in his sights.
So, how could it have come down to this?
"What are you doing here, Rick?" Tony asks, feigning impassiveness, even when in reality he feels like jumping off of the hospital bed and punching Rick in the nose for interrupting his and Rosie's moment with Steve. He hasn't seen Steve in months and for the love of god he's adult enough of an omega to admit it that yes, maybe he did miss the alpha, and no, Rick is not welcome to ruin the moment.
"I really don't like hurting people," Marco told him, "I don't like hurting you either. But I will, if you force my hand." Tony wanted to roll his eyes at him, but couldn't quite gather the courage required for it, lying as he was on the floor, dizzy and shaking like a leaf. Maybe once he caught his breath.
. She died, because of you."
In February, the team files into the Quinjet and flies up North to Canada.
"Rick," Tony warns, glaring at his husband as he ducks his head to scent along Tony's neck. "Cut the crap. I sat down with you, acted nice and talked even though I'm still pissed at you, so you can stop with the alpha posturing shit right away." He pushes at Rick's shoulders. "I'm tired, let me go to sleep."
"What are you implying?" Tony asked with a dangerous tone.
He twisted his head weakly in the direction of Becker; the large man, having been further away and managing to shield his ears in time, would recover faster than either Tony or Marco. He was already pushing himself up, balanced on all fours while Tony was still lying on his side.
Flying to the edge of the city took considerably less time than traveling there by any other means of transportation. Steve had hitched a ride on the War Machine armor, hanging onto Rhodey's shoulders as they flew over to where FRIDAY had received the signal last.
"Do you, Omega Anthony Edward Stark, take Alpha Richard Terrence Darrow to be your lawfully wedded mate, and promise to respect him and care for him, in good times and in bad, until death do you part?"
He gingerly shrugged off the remains of his t-shirt, letting it drop to the floor by his feet, and kicked off his sweatpants. He picked up the washcloth and wet it, adding a little soap, and swiped it across his chest.
Hammer cleared his throat and Tony reluctantly shifted his attention to him. He lifted his cup. "So," he begun as Bates walked over and poured some coffee into the cup. It was piping hot and smelled heavenly.
"Fuck you, you pea-brained evolutionary throwback," Tony spat at him, twisting and struggling to make picking him up harder than it ought to be. "It's you who's gonna regret ever being born once I'm through with you tools!"
"I want my wife back," Ezekiel replied without hesitation, "But you can't give that to me. No one can."
"You're wrinkling your drawing, honey." He watches as Rosie unclenches her fingers and clumsily starts to smooth out the paper against her thighs. It's Sunday, and they are going to pay Steve a visit since Tony's nerves can't take anymore of Rose's constant questioning about the alpha. Also, the gruesome bruises and cuts have finally mostly healed on his face, so it's safe to bring a toddler to see him.
"That is not good," Steve said with no real concern to his voice. He felt like it was his duty to protest, but he didn't much care what Natasha did to Dr. Miller. Not, if she got a confession out of her, at least. All that mattered right now, was Tony.
He continues on his flight path, and JARVIS displays the outline of the underground bunker that is just beginning to show up on his HUD. It's an active HYDRA base, one of the two they are currently in the know of thanks to the task force that's been working on unearthing them. Ever since the whole fiasco of an undercover mission, the task force has been tirelessly inspecting leads and data gained from recons with great results. It consists mainly of Steve, Nat, Clint and Sam Wilson, along with some SHIELD specialists, so the job of eradicating the bases was naturally handed over to the Avengers Initiative.
"You'll see Steve when you get back, okay?" Tony tries to mollify her, but it doesn't do much. He takes a seat at the edge of Steve's hospital bed and leans in to whisper in her hear, "Maybe you can draw him another picture there? That way it'll be a surprise." It seems to do the trick, as the toddler perks up a little, and Tony answers Steve's questioning look with a small smirk and a wink.
"I'm not going to repeat myself, Tony. Either the necklace now or after you've made Rose cry her eyes out."
"I just--"
Tony couldn't hold in his scoff. "And you're...what? Taking revenge twelve years later? Come on, Zeke. I know you and Obie were never that close, but twelve ye—"
How did you like the second chapter? Leave a comment :)
Steve swallows, and Tony dares to scent the air around him. He almost blushes at the scent of lust wafting off of the Captain. "Yes," Steve finally manages. "That was...adequate." He tries to keep his face serious, but Tony can tell he's about

So, note that this chapter is pure hurt. It gets pretty bad. This means that you should maybe re-check the tags for this fic. I'll also add some additional ones into the notes below.
"Why do you have to be so difficult all the time? Amanda's omega bitch, Carl, is such a good sport. I hear he actually listens to his alpha," he tells Tony as his other hand moves up to unbutton the omega's shirt collar.
"Chatter, guys," Steve reminds them. Clint pokes his tongue out at Tony, and Tony isn't ashamed to admit that he isn't above reciprocating.
All heads turned to his way. "What do you mean?" Steve asked.
"Thanks, pumpkin," Tony tells her, appreciatively, and Rose turns back to Barton so that they can return to their play, grabbing his hand. Her chest is puffed out with pride that she had managed to find such fine gifts. Tony smiles gently at her back and lets the rock fall back to the ground; if he kept every rock and stick and pine cone the kid gave him, he'd already have a roomful. Rogers looks unsure what to do, and Tony laughs at him.
Tony groans mentally, because Rick's right. Rosie had seen the staff preparing them the dining room and crowding in the kitchen, as well as heard Rick's clarification of it being all for a family dinner. Hell, Tony had been the one to tell her to put on a fancy headband, and the kid was probably still in her room, picking out the best dress to match the headpiece.
"Yes, Sir," Bates replied, walking up to Tony. Tony shrugged off the hand that grabbed his arm, but couldn't evade the one that enclosed around his right hand, the one holding the knife. His knuckles were white from pursing his fist around the handle, and yet it didn't take more than the slightest pressure from Bates to make him release his hold.
Tony looked up at him in confusion. He couldn't bring himself to stand up, how was he supposed to walk upstairs after Ezekiel? Was Ezekiel mocking him?
"Next time answer with your mouth empty, okay hon?" Rosie hums at him, always the one to find a loophole to a rule, and chews on the dessert in her mouth.
, Tony almost protested, but held his tongue — his shoulder was still throbbing something awful. Whatever, it would have sounded weak, even to his own ears. He hardly believed it himself, some days.
"Hey," Tony says back, the omega in him purring at the attention his alpha is showering him with. His hands are full of clean plates he'd taken from the dishwasher to put into the cupboard, and he sets them down on the counter top. It's been a few weeks since Tony, Steve, Clint and Rose visited Central Park, although the memory is still fresh in the engineer's mind. Since then, everyone in the team has shifted to first name basis, Tony preferring to use his teammates' given names even in the privacy of his own mind.
"Oh, baby," Tony says softly, unbuckling the girl again and pulling her to his chest, much like he did not that many minutes ago when he first came to pick Rosie up. "They'll be just fine. They'll be home soon," he reassures, although he isn't sure whether he's reassuring himself or his daughter anymore.
"Not so soon, love," Rick reprimands him and delivers a harsh slap to one of Tony's ass cheeks. Tony gasps and tries to wiggle away, but that's when Rick bends over him, pushing his cock inside Tony. Tony chokes.
Come say hi.
But it wasn't Ezekiel at all that entered the basement; Tony frowned when his eyes landed on Bates instead.
With that, he carelessly let go of his jaw and stepped back from him. "He's clean. Knock him out and load him up. He needs to still see the Doctor before we can deliver him to his new owners."
"No, it's not okay!"
"Thanks, honey buns, but you can save it." He doesn't look at Bruce, but he can feel the disapproving gaze boring into the side of his face.
Tony blinked up at him. "Wha—"
something passionate and desperate,

"The HYDRA base we were undercover at was, like, in the middle of fucking

Thank you again for sticking with me and these fics. I really love writing and it's super to hear you guys like reading what I've got to offer. Have a great day ❤️
Rhodey was in the know already, of course. He had been the first to get the call from Pepper and was now somewhere out there, hopefully chasing a lead. He was only the obvious choice to be informed first, Steve had rationalized to himself. Out of the two of them, Rhodey was the one closer to Tony, while Steve was barely in speaking terms with the man. There were too many old wounds, Steve knew. Nevertheless, it still filled him with envy.
He forced his feet to move again.
Huh, so he's been here for quite a while then. "Sorry, Steve," he says while rubbing at his tired eyes. "I didn't realize I had been here for so long. She wasn't a bother was she?" He bounces Rosie on his knee. She waves at DUM-E and Butterfingers on the other side of the room.
With that, he closed the door and left Tony alone in the bathroom. Tony almost wished he hadn't, since the moment he did, the crushing reality of what had happened with Ezekiel felt tangible enough to choke him to death. He felt embarrassed for crying in front of him. He felt ashamed for the accusations he had thrown in his face. He felt guilt for all those people that had suffered.
I tell you to do on the dot, or there will be consequences. You will attend some omega classes at your school, although I'll make sure that they won't put shame to the Stark name by training you into becoming some pampered ditz. I
His heartbeat stuttered when Ezekiel finally stopped moving, standing still behind Tony's back, right in his blind spot. He couldn't suppress his flinch when a large hand touched the skin there.
He let out an explosive sigh of relief when they moved aside another plastic curtain and found an operating table, blessedly devoid of any dead, brown-haired billionaires.
The alpha smiles warmly at Steve and then turns back to Tony. "I have to go now. I'll have my assistant send you an email about that stock meeting today. Also, clear up you evening for me, would you. I want to spend some quality time with my family on our anniversary." He says the last part near Tony's ear, grasping Tony's hip possessively, and they both know that Steve can here his low voice just fine from where he's standing. Tony can see the captain's fists tightening and he suspects that Rick is looking straight into Steve's eyes as he's leaning into Tony's space.
"We were undercover when we got busted. That was when we sent you guys our last transmission and someone found out about it. Spent a couple weeks on the run afterwards, then a few days in captivity when the bastards found us again. They recognized us without our photostatic veils on, took us in and questioned us, mostly about SHIELD, but also about the team, but we gave them nothing. Cap....he took the brunt of the interrogations," Clint finishes with a look towards Steve. Tony feels a chill running down his spine, and he resists the urge to wrap his arms around himself. It would be such an omega thing to do, or at least that's what his Father would think.
"You will choose now, Anthony," his Father told him, taking a hold of his other hand also, shaking Tony slightly. "Either, you will be sent to Portland where you'll enroll at the finest facility for omegas this country has, Portland Academy for Omega Upbringing and Behavior. There you will learn every tidbit of information for what there is to being the pretty little harlot for the upper class." His grip was now bruising, and spit was flying from his mouth as he spoke hatefully.
So, yeah, I'm not a doctor, but I tried to go for some level of credibility. I'm really into realistic writing and I often research some stuff way too thoroughly than I probably should, but I don't know if it was enough for what little medical mumbo jumbo I wrote for this chapter. I hope you enjoyed reading regardless!
The omega twists around between his alpha and the kitchen counter, turning to face Rick. The alpha's eyes look tired, he's sporting a slight stubble on his usually clean-shaven jaw and his tie is crooked. Tony extends his hands to unfasten it, leaving it dangling open from both sides of Rick's neck. "How was the trip?"
, and Tony honestly wasn't sure which phase he preferred.
"Not a chance," Tony growled automatically, glaring up at Ezekiel. His misery was quickly turning to anger.
Thinking back on the lightning of the basement, it had probably been some hours after he had passed out when someone came to get him, nudging him to rouse him from his sleep.
was Tony's immediate answer. He didn't say it out loud, but he could feel his traitorous eyes filling with tears.
Now, enjoy reading the 5th chapter!
cold out there."
"I'm just making sure he learns his lesson," Becker replied, and it was accompanied by the sound of a leather belt sliding off of his waist.
"What for?" was what Becker barked out at him. Tony was speechless for a moment.
Tony crosses his arms over his chest. Usually, it would make him feel like he was confident and in control of the situation, but now the motion just makes him feel small. He uncrosses them. "Clint, it's fine. The contract is almost thirty years old."
So yeah, I went and saw Endgame.....and I don't want to talk about it, at least not the last half an hour. This fic will still however remain completely spoiler free. So please, refrain from discussing about the movie in the comments as well, or at least write a disclaimer for spoiler-y content just in case someone hasn't yet seen it.
"Sure," Tony replied, trying to sound demure in the presence of his family and another influential old money family. He was most likely failing, since Tony didn't do demure.
Yeah, so it's been a while.....
Tony huffed, but it was all bravado. "And what would that be?"
He put the pin into his pocket, patting the fabric once it was concealed. Next, he went and did his business, flushing the toilet afterward and washing his hands and his face. He drank his fill from the faucet, having not realized how thirsty he had been until now. The water and the pin burning a hole in his pocket made him feel more alert, more in control. It was a good feeling.
"I didn't know we had one of those in the common floor kitchen," Tony tells him. Steve shrugs as he pops the lid of the kit open and grabs a small bottle of antiseptic and a couple cotton pads.
Rogers's good at this. No wonder he'd been a captain and a praised strategist during the war. He
"It's okay," Steve reassures again, smiling at Tony. It's a little strained, and Tony thinks he knows why; they still haven't gotten to talk about yesterday's
half of the population."
(See the end of the chapter for
They had been driving for the better part of an hour when the car finally stopped moving. Or, at least that was the amount of time that Tony was aware of, since that was since he'd woken up — they had probably been on the road for a lot longer than that.
"Slipped in the damn shower and banged my face against the faucet." He ponders for half a second whether his explanation had been too long, too detailed to pass as the truth, but relaxes when Clint's face morphs into a sympathetic expression of pain.
"A leopold!" Rose near screams from where she's sitting on Barton's shoulders, pointing towards the feline in the exhibit area. Tony has to stifle a chuckle at the toddler's expense.
He wasn't able to contain the moan of pain at the movement. A burning sensation had flared up along the muscles of his back, and his entire back felt hot and swollen. Even breathing hurt. He didn't even want to imagine the mess of bruises and torn skin his back was sure to be.
He was back at the event venue, out in the alley behind the building. It was the early hours of the morning and he had returned a moment ago, after a handful of hours of chasing leads that lead nowhere.
Tony shrugged. "Not really. I have been kidnapped before, I can take a guess. Money, tech, weapons, revenge, yadda yadda...What I am confused about however, is how you managed to pull it off so far. Not very like you, Hammer.
Ezekiel is a real character in the comics (at least in 616, I think), but apart from some vague traits (e.g. name, intelligence, despising Tony,
Tony yells again, a little more frantic this time, even if he knows from experience that it's to no avail. Rick settles more fully to stand between Tony's kicking legs, and thrusts his hips when the kiss against his neck turns into a painful bite. Tony yelps and tries to twist away.
"An oversight, on your part," Ezekiel said, rubbing it in, "One that I was relying on, since I knew how cocky you are." He grabbed the chair and righted Tony again. Tony grunted as his bruises were jostled. "However, your cockiness isn't what I meant to discuss with you. Captain America is."
"She's a nutcase," the man said, indicating with a thumb over his shoulder. He looked angry and tired, and there was a light coating of perspiration on his forehead.
Also, thinking there was an enemy ahead was easier than thinking there might be a body.
He leaves Steve's side only when it's time to pick up Rosie again, and when the man still hasn't shown any signs of waking up.
Steve raised his hand to cover his eyes as he listened to Rhodey's groan. "Got it, Fri."
"Trust me, even I can't bring myself to believe it," Tony quipped, stumbling along as Marco took him by the arm and pulled him towards the stairs.
Hope that I don't seem like I'm hurrying to you guys. I myself prefer to get over the canon stuff as fast as possible, so that's why the story's been so summarized thus far. Next chapter, the pace will begin to slow, and we'll get to see some domestic Avengers, as well as some Steve/Tony moments. B-) Catch you next time!!
"Don't worry, this is just a little sedative," the doctor replied lightly, "Now, Mr. Stark, do try to be still."
Next chapter: the "quality time"
"When's the last time you had water? When you ate something?" he asked, pacing again.
, he felt horrible.
He was lying face down on the floor, his arms stretched before him, circling around something. Another nudge caused him to groan irritably. He attempted to move his shoulder away from whoever it was that kept on bugging him.
. It hurt so much. And when Rick's orgasm finally shuddered through him, and the alpha's teeth sank to the tender flesh of his neck, breaking skin and mingling their scents, Tony let the scream he'd been holding in slip through his lips. Then, he mercifully blacked out.
Steve was supposed to let out a startled laugh, eyes sparkling as he showed his own hand, but to Tony's surprise, he spoke again,
"Did you really think that was gonna pan out?" he asked breathily, tone bored but eyes harsh.
So, he goes, and ends up entertaining guests for five long hours in total, meeting only once with Rhodey over the span of those hours, until Rick walks up to him and tells him that their driver will be taking them home in half an hour. To
"We know you were there at the time of—"
"I'm sorry," she said. To Tony, she sounded genuine. "I'm privy to all of Mr. Stane's dealings, so my activities are monitored. He would know something is going on and move you to another location before your team could come to you. And then, he would kill me."
It has been a nice few weeks, all in all.
His voice was neutral, neither mocking nor concerned, but it made Tony bristle all the same. "No," he bit out against his better judgement, and leaned heavily on the hand railing as he took the first step up the stairs.
Natasha nods. "Good."
"Yeah," she says, giving up on pronouncing the word. Tony smirks up at her.
"That won't help you get out of the contract, Tony. You know it won't. We're stuck with each other at least until Rose presents and takes over the company."
(See the end of the chapter for
. Get out, now.
"Hey, Steve, Clint," Tony tries, but to no avail. He starts panicking when the two near the elevator and the staircase. "JARVIS! Lockdown on common floor!" he screams and instantly the lights flicker off, replaced by dimmer emergency lighting, and the doors to the stairs don't give an inch when Steve yanks at them.
The man crouched in front of him and unclipped the chain from one of Tony's cuffs, twisting the other end securely into the palm of his hand and holding onto it.
The team has been living under Tony's roof for a little over two weeks now, and the engineer is finally beginning to get accustomed to having neighbours this close to his own apartment (the closest being literally two flights of stairs down, if you didn't count the common floor). He's also starting to recognize some of his teammates' habits and routines, one being Rogers' inhumanly early morning workouts.
With a sigh, he opened his eyes again, focusing on the street on the other side of the parking lot. His eyes widened as he noticed something.
She nodded and hurried away.
JARVIS displays a holographic scan of the contract and Tony watches in silence as his teammates read through it. Even Natasha ventures from the kitchen to join with the reading. Tony doesn't have to. He knows the contract by heart, could recite it from word to word if needed.
"Oh," is Bruce's reaction to the drawing.
Tony met Hammer's eyes, and he was taken aback when he saw surprise etched on the man's face. As Tony watched, it was quickly hidden behind a smile. When the two of them approached the table, Hammer gestured with his hands grandly.
"I'm sorry—"
Frustration made him struggle harder and he tried to wiggle his way up the pole — if he could just slide the chain off the hook he might have a chance at escaping.
So obviously, the PR wasn't always good, but it could've always been a lot worse. To the public, his little stunts that got featured in the media were just endearing, and soon he would settle with the mating bite from his alpha. It made him want to rip his hair out.
He sat up on the floor around the pillar, groaning at the excruciating case of pins and needles in his arms as his nerves decompressed, and was distracted long enough for Bates to pull up a chair and sit down on it in front of him.
The summers in New York can get quite hot sometimes, and the three men and one girl take a break from all the walking and playing around noon. They are seated on a bench near the zoo, which is their next destination, and Tony can't quite get Rose to settle since she knows that's where they are going next.
Ezekiel released his hold on him completely, pushing away from him violently. "That's what I thought," he said, voice filled with disgust. Tony drew in a shaky breath, fighting for control over his emotions.
He heard Ezekiel sighing, and when someone grabbed him, pulling him up, blood rushed away from his head and towards his feet. He passed out.
As he spoke, he walked over to the table by the wall and Tony's body jerked involuntarily against his bonds as he watched Ezekiel pick something up.
PLEASE READ: I just feel the need to point out that I'm not trying to romanticize the relationship between Tony and Rick in any way. It's not healthy in the least. What I'm trying to show you guys is how their relationship has twisted and morphed during the years spent together, in good and bad. They are codependent and they have good moments because they have to in order to cope, but they still despise each other and their marriage is toxic more than anything else.
He stopped, just shy of fifteen feet from Jim.
mad about it). As Tony watches, the alpha's expression starts to grow more and more angry by the minute.
hopes that all is just fine and dandy despite the sudden radio silence. Needless to say, he is also feeling like a total wreck about the whole mission, and he's probably leaking stress hormones pretty much 24/7, since he already has a pretty stressful lifestyle and the added strain really isn't doing any favours there.
Rick flashed his trademark smirk down at him. "I'll be gone in a minute," he said. He bent his head down to kiss the omega, breathing in his sweet scent deeply. Tony returned the kiss, leaning leisurely against the counter. Moments like this were good, they were meant to be treasured. Moments like this when they didn't fight, or they didn't remember the mutual disdain and hatred they held towards each other, or the bitterness that had mustered along the years. This was good, this was home, this was his mate, and even though Tony hated thinking that, it was the truth. And it wasn't going to change.
," Tony said levelly, "I've still got just enough fight left in me." He looked Hammer straight in the eye so the threat in his sentence wouldn't go unnoticed.
Tony's throat tightens up again, and luckily it's Barton that hurries to answer, "He's still under, but he's fine."
Steve is asking over the comms. Tony has his eyes on the horizon, enjoying the feeling of flying through the air. His team is by his back, following him in the Quinjet.
, was more than any omega could ever ask for, and way more than he'd ever thought his Father would be willing to give him. Well, it seemed that protecting the family name went even before his hatred for Tony and his gender, so he guessed he was lucky —, or furious that he was going to be forced to marry his childhood best friend, nowadays a self-centered bag of dicks, Rick Darrow. Or maybe he should be happy that it hadn't been Rick's older alpha sister, Amanda, who was going to be the one to take over the Darrow Industries after Chester Darrow. Amanda Darrow was even worse than her brother, or so Tony had heard.
"No, Tony, don't," Steve interrupts him, shaking his head and carding a hand through his hair. The alpha looks somewhat panicked, which is a rare expression on his face. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. I just--I don't know what I was thinking. You have an alpha and--"
There's a slight pause where Tony suspects the two other conscious teammates are having a silent conversation, before Clint speaks up again,
"What the—" Beard, or Becker apparently, started, raising his eyes from Tony's to look at the others. Tony squirmed faintly against his iron grip; his lungs were beginning to burn.
"Not sulking, hon," Tony replies, turning to smile at her and level a glare at his husband. "Your Father just imagined it, I'm sure. He must be pretty tired from his day at work." Rick's mouth twitches at Tony's retort, but Tony can't tell if it's the good or the bad kind. Either way, he just decides to roll with it.
"Thanks, Steve," he says and smiles a small smile at Rogers' back. The alpha turns and is about to say something (probably, 'you're welcome, Tony') when JARVIS interrupts him.
Nick Fury's professional tone greets him, causing Tony to startle into a focused state.
"Sorry, Tony," Steve breaks the silence between them as they near their table. "I get it now why you didn't want me to pay for the drinks. I'll think twice next time before trying to force my opinion on you." Then he's speeding off to hand Rose her sundae, whom by now is making eager grabby hands. Tony's left in stunned silence. He's so baffled that he even forgets that he'd been planning to apologize to Rogers, too.
"No, I want to know what this is," the archer continues, not relenting. "I knew that your marriage was arranged but this? Who the hell even does agreements like this anymore?!"
, he thought,
Tony turns to face Rick. "Good day at the office?" he asks with a broad,
Rogers huffs at him. "I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. And I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself." And,
Tony raises his arms, repulsors whining. "Stop right there."
As soon as he did, Tony promptly crouched down and pulled open the sink cabinet. He eyed his options; there were metal parts he could remove by hand from the drain stopper, but delicate as they were, they were still too large to fit into the cuffs. He rifled through the rest of the cabinet next. It was empty, save for some toilet paper rolls and cheap hand soap. Nothing that he could really use.
Ezekiel said, indicating to himself, "had vanished. Her mother and father had vanished. She had no one. She died of
"I was just messing with him," Becker said, his voice hoarse, "I knew a snob like him would get freaked out by it." To top it off, he smacked Tony on the ass with an open palm this time. Tony jerked at the impact, but didn't otherwise react.
They walked to the door that lead to the dining room, where Bates stopped and gestured at Tony to raise his hands. Reluctantly, he did, only because he saw no way out of it, and Bates clipped the chain back to the D-rings, securing them to each other. Then, he knocked on the door.
Another half an hour later, there was a knock on the door. As Marco got up, Tony tightened his fist around the pin, heart beating wildly in his chest. There would be no room for errors if he wanted to make a run for it.
They turn back to look after Rose, now accompanied by Hawkeye who's making ridiculous noises to entertain the toddler perched on top of the jungle gym. She just seems confused at the beta's attempts, but amused in any case as she pushes herself over the edge and is caught by Barton's firm hands.
Steve frowned at him. "What do you mean?"
When the data is done downloading, he leaves the control room and goes to help his team with the cleanup. He's starting to think that Steve was right all along. Maybe the HYDRA head was just baiting him to get him all puzzled, to get his attention elsewhere.
when this is happening!"
"No," Becker said, somewhat petulantly.
They reach check point one without further hassle. That's when Steve speaks over the comms again.
"Impressed?" Tony let out with a strained voice.
With slight difficulties — slight being the understatement of the
He supposed he could ask FRIDAY to patch him through to Spider-Man, but it wasn't all that...
has had a bruised face because of Tony for a couple of times, even), but he still doesn't think they need to know every detail of their relationship. He doesn't want their pity and they can't help him either because of the contract.
"Rather I'm up late, actually," he chirps at the alpha, staring at the dripping coffee as if that will make it brew faster. He hears the captain sigh at him.
"It's always just you bossing me around since you can't have a talk with an
Steve might not be coming. Rhodey might not find him. The team operated on too many variables nowadays. Tony had to be prepared to survive by himself.
He groaned when his shoulder hit the ground painfully. "F-fuck off," he bit out, finally mostly in control of his mouth. His words slurred a little and his voice was rough, but hey, at least the message was clear.
"Which will it be, Tony?" Howard grits, fingers tightening on Tony. Tony swallows.
"What happened?" Tony asks, finally properly looking at the archer. Clint shrugs and breathes languidly in before replying,
The crop struck him again, this time near his bad shoulder. "Stand up," Ezekiel repeated, voice low and testy, as Tony struggled to concentrate through the haze of pain.
"So, let's not," Tony cuts in easily, flashing an obviously fake smile at the scientist before exiting the elevator that has just arrived to the common floor. Steve is there, because that's where he always is, and the captain perks up at the sound of the elevator doors. Unfortunately though, the man is too perceptive for his own good and seems to notice something is going on at the first glance at Tony's face.
"Yeah?"
"I'm sure she did it," he told him, eyes trained on the doctor. The door to the interrogation room opened and closed as Natasha stepped in. Steve nodded at him.
"The big guy with the beard?" Hammer asked, cutting into the hash browns on his plate with his cutlery. He popped a piece into his mouth before continuing, "I thought we agreed on not getting too over-eager with the goods, yes?"
"Wow," Tony said, and promptly blacked out.
Maybe the poisoning hadn't been that serious when he'd been pregnant? Or maybe he was just more vulnerable to poisons than she was? Maybe his body had been protecting Rose from the palladium? He didn't know, and it didn't make sense, so all Tony did was thank the heavens when Rose continued to develop normally, too quickly turning from baby to toddler as months passed. It was some time after she had turned two that Tony had to leave to help SHIELD with their problem with this glowing blue cube called the Tesseract. Pepper had offered to take care of Rose while he was gone, and the company was in his reach with one email to Rick or the board members.
Tony, JARVIS and their group of prisoners have almost reached the exit, when Tony hears footsteps coming their way. From behind them.
"Are you now, sugar? Maybe if you'll ask Steve here really nicely then he'll fix you something. Okay, pup?" He eyes the kid, absently poking a finger to the extended hand and making sure she understood before taking a gulp of his scalding coffee.
Thanks for reading, and
Ezekiel peered down at him, head tilted as if in thought. "Good," stated he finally. "Now, stand up."
"Tony--"
The three of them are all gathered around the long table, Rick in the same white shirt he wore for work, sans the jacket, Tony clad in a white, generously loose and soft dress shirt and dark trousers, borderline casual but still formal enough to pass by Rick's standards, and Rosie glammed up in a cerulean blue dress, hair pulled partway up and adorned with Pepper's silver flower headband in a way that Rosie firmly tells Tony is 'princess-like'. She'd made him do her hair for her, of course, and Tony's beginning to question whether passing on his diva genes was a good idea after all.
Twenty minutes later, they are standing in front of a nice-looking café, Rose crowding their legs in anticipation of the ice cream Barton had promised her. They enter, Tony sighing with pleasure at the air conditioning of the coffee shop. He's never liked it when the weather gets hot and humid. Warm? Yes. Scorching? No. It reminds him of that one hot summer day in 1989 and of the desert he'd experienced in 2008. Also, the stickiness it causes is unpleasant.
"Come on, baby, have a drink." He brings a water bottle to her mouth, one hand swiping dark strands of hair out of her face as he tries to prevent Rose from drying up. You never know with kids. One moment they are fine, running around the park with their friends, and the next they are in the throes of heat exhaustion because they didn't notice how thirsty they were in the middle of their game. Tony doesn't want that to be the reason they'd have to stop their day trip to Central Park. "You want a snack, Rose?"
He woke up on an examination table with no idea how much time had passed. Disoriented, his muscles tensed and he made to move his hands to push himself up, but they stopped somewhere around his hips, accompanied by an abrupt snapping sound. He looked down at them, not surprised when he found restraints circling his wrists and ankles, securing his hands and legs to the table.
he yelled again, and something inside Tony broke.
"What do you want?" Tony asked warily. Dina crouched in front of him, facing him.
and Tony can't stop the tears traveling down his cheeks as pleasure gathers in his nether regions, filling his dick with blood impossibly even further. Rick fucks into him unforgivingly, and when he begins to near his orgasm he bites down on Tony's neck, hips pumping even more harshly. Tony whines and grunts and grits his teeth, but he feels himself leaking, even through the slight pain that comes from Rick's rough handling.
"Well," Hammer began, ominously enough, "Zeke thinks that I'm in it for the same reasons as him; revenge, punishment, biblical justice, whatever it is. And don't misunderstand me, because I do despise you, but that's not all." He sipped his wine, as if he was contemplating his words. "Let's just say that I have a vested interest."
"What's happening?" Spider-Man asked, standing right behind Steve's shoulder. He had to be watching the interrogation — his voice was unbelieving, somewhat frightened like someone's who wasn't used to watching violence of this kind. Steve thought it fit with the youthful image he had of Spider-Man. He reminded Steve of his own younger self.
Just over three months after Rose's birth, Tony has to deal with Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer. And also, he's dying of palladium poisoning. Fuck his life.
"Well?" Ezekiel pressed, his tone implying that he was growing tired of waiting for Tony's compliance. "Last chance."
"Congratulations, Tony. A good match, indeed." He flinches hard at the voice just an inch from his neck, nearly dropping his flute of champagne as he whirls around.
"Ezekiel, did you bring Tony wi—" Hammer's sentence was cut off when he burst into roaring laughter. Tony felt his flush deepening. "Oh, oh my—"
The sight disappeared when Ezekiel electrocuted him.
With one powerful movement, he flips Tony over to his stomach, and starts kissing down his back, pulling his shirt out of the way and locking Tony's hands in it. He presses his crotch against Tony's behind, and Tony can't quite suppress the gasp at the feeling of his erection dragging over his cleft.
Tony doesn't even snap at him for using 'Darrow' instead of 'Stark' (even though both are his legal names), since he's too focused on keeping his sobs of relief contained.
"Let me tell you something," the head alpha says, sounding winded from the labor of keeping Tony in place. He leans towards Tony's face, so close that Tony can smell his breath. "Let me tell you something about that alpha."
They struggled for a brief moment before they were interrupted.
The paralysis was starting to wear off, and Tony wiggled his fingers, rotated his ankles and did everything in his power to speed it along. He hated the feeling of being trapped in his own body, of being powerless against everything happening to him. Hated remembering how it had felt to be able do nothing while someone literally ripped the life out of him.
Nebula stepped closer to him, breaking his train of thought. "Are you not going to stop her?" she asked levelly. Testing him, Steve realized. He spared her a glance; her eyes were glued to the interrogation room and unlike Spider-Man, she seemed to be reveling in what was happening.
Marco let out a choked sound, but remained standing as he reciprocated, punching Tony in the shoulder. Tony grunted and kneed him in the stomach, the hand holding the other man's wrist squeezing and twisting. Marco went down, falling on his front, guided by the hand Tony still had on him.
. Tony's eyes had followed his retreat, but now they focused on Ezekiel.
Thanks!
It was a mistake.
All there was was freaking taiga, and all we had time to worry about was not getting our asses frostbitten at night, since let me tell you, this time of the year it gets
Tony sighed. "Well, whatever it is, I'm not helping him with it, and that's all I'm gonna say about it."
First, he would need something metallic.
"Thanks for the assist, guys," he grouses.
He stood back up and looked around the bathroom. There was absolutely nothing in the room that would fit, not that he could see. He was about to throw in the towel when he finally saw it.
Tony clicked off the safety and was quick to train his own gun on Marco's head.
"Of course, Rosie," Rogers replies, already scooping scrambled eggs on a plate with half a toast already on it. Tony grabs a banana from the nearby fruit basket and begins pealing. When Rogers deposits Rose's plate before her, exchanging a 'here you go' and a 'thank you' with her, Tony asks for a knife and a bowl. Steve hands him the items and Tony slices half of the banana into the small bowl, pushing it towards his daughter, and finishing off the rest himself.
but obviously not often enough that Rosie thought it was habitual. But now that he thought of it, he did often end up only cooking for the toddler and then himself just focusing on getting the girl to actually eat it. Sometimes there was just too much everything else interesting to keep her focus on finishing her plate without outside intervention.
"Yes, Sir," Bates replied and swiftly left the basement. At the top of the stairs, he closed the door with a definitive
The door to the viewing room opened and he turned to watch as Natasha walked in.
Steve is silent for a while, and Tony gets to stew for a moment, before the captain finally breaks the silence, "Can I really do nothing to help?" he asks, voice tense and fists clenched, and Tony just stares. He recovers with a shake of his head, and clears his throat.
close to him. His front was pressed against the whole of Tony's back and he still held onto Tony's arms, preventing him from taking a swipe at anyone or moving them away. Tony ceased with his struggling to draw in a shuddering breath when Bates pressed himself even more tightly against him. His proximity was suffocating. "Otherwise he'll find a way out of them."
, it stings alright. It stings and it hits Tony just where he's the most vulnerable, where he hates himself the most. The words keep pouring from Rogers' mouth and Tony has to break eye contact (which he detests himself for, because it's exactly what a traditional, submissive omega would do) because
Steve lets go of the necklace and takes a small step back to give the omega some space.
"Oh, you love it," Rick taunts, like he always does when he gets Tony's body to play against him, and thrusts against the omega again. He does it for the third time, now with strong hands holding Tony's hips in place, and Tony groans, knees going a little weak. No, he doesn't love it, he
"Yeah," the toddler replies him and grabs handfuls of Steve's shirt when the alpha plucks her from Tony's lap. Tony eyes the tray curiously; there's a bowl full of some sort of veggie stew, a cup of water,
"Dad!" Rose exclaims, slithering down the bed so she can run to her Father.
Tony sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. Speaking of headaches...
"Get me his phone," Boss said, choosing to ignore Tony entirely, "Take off his jacket, shoes, watch and belt."
. "JARVIS, pull up a copy."
"You're a doctor!" Rhodey was saying, his voice coming from the speakers by the wall, when Steve tuned back into the interrogation. "You swore an oath, didn't you.
If you wanna say hi, here's
Steve glances briefly at Tony before replying to the kid, "I think this looks plenty hard as it is, but alright." He digs through the drawer again and pulls out an unopened one, this time shaped a little differently. "Does this look good, Rose?"
"Oh, Master Anthony," Jarvis interrupted him, sudden tears in his eyes. He'd reached to cup Tony's head with both hands. They were shaking, Tony had realised. "Remember, that whatever happens from this point onwards, you have nothing to be ashamed of and you have done absolutely nothing wrong. Alright?"
When they began descending the stairs that led down to the lobby, Tony could make out Ezekiel's deep and impassive voice, discussing something with Hammer below them. His feet stopped working and Bates had to push him to get them moving again, but even then he managed only one step down.
Sam and Bruce nodded and got up. Sam walked out of the room, but Bruce didn't immediately leave after Steve had given his orders.
Obadiah Stane is standing there, a smug look plastered on his face. Tony rolls his eyes with a sigh. "That's what I've been hearing all night." Obie huffs out a laugh at him. He extends his hand past the omega to also grab a new glass of champagne.
Steve's mouth has thinned out into a tight line, and his eyes are trained hard on the floor. His fists are wavering slightly with tremors caused by pursing them too hard. "That bastard," he swears softly. Tony doesn't know exactly whom the captain is cursing, and he's to occupied with the fact that
"I don't care!" Marco hissed. "Just get him and follow me. And do not make a fuss!"
"That, I wonder also," Tony tells him absently, not caring whether Rogers had been expecting a reply or not. They stand in the silent kitchen for a while.
Tony agreed; his belly ached from hunger and the tremors from low blood sugar were getting harder and harder to conceal, especially in his left hand. But he didn't trust Hammer enough to eat anything from his table, at least nothing he hadn't seen the other man try first. Tony didn't put it past the guy to try and drug him this early on.
"I couldn't even tell it was a snow leopard," he admits, smiling over his glass at the alpha. Rogers smiles back at him.
He's standing by an intersection to another set of hallways, looking intently at a metallic structure. Tony inches to stand next to him and sees figures on the surface of the metal. He turns his head to watch Clint signing the details to cap, who nods before signing back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Their move went on without any hiccups, all done and finished in one day. Rick had packed up their shared study and bedroom, where as Tony'd packed everything from the kitchen and the nursery, as well as his own room. He'd long since taken residence in one of the guest rooms in their penthouse apartment, preferring the privacy because of his night terrors whenever possible. Some nights Rick wanted him to sleep with him in their bedroom, either to have sex or just clutch Tony against his chest to cover the engineer in his scent. Some alpha urge, he was sure. The mornings after a cuddle session were usually good, both of them lounging relaxedly in bed before they had to leave for work or go take care of their daughter, talking about whatever was going on around at work or at home, either both or the other flipping through a tablet or a cellphone as they did. They continued on with the habit in their new apartment in the tower too, although Tony still slept in his own room most nights.
After paying (after
Rick answers by pushing a couple of fingers inside him. Tony's whole body jerks, and then he lets out an obscene moan when Rick's clever fingers find his prostate. He keeps the assault going all the way until Tony's a quivering, whimpering mess, his body basically begging to be taken by his mate. The scent of alpha, his own slick, and his and Rick's arousal in the air are almost overwhelming, and the feeling causes disgusted and desperate tears to make their way to Tony's eyes.
"Traced his phone?" Steve guessed.
It was obvious to Steve that the man was a scapegoat; he knew hardly anything of the kidnapping, apart from what had been his job to do, yet he would be the first one fingers would be pointed to. The names he had given, all except for Ed Adams, would most likely lead to nowhere, since they were only halves of names, and Steve supposed some of them could be pseudonyms.
However, before he could pull himself up to his aching feet, Ezekiel had wrapped his hand around the back of his neck and pushed him back down. He
They move as quickly as they can, but it's still agonizingly slow. They are just past check point two, when a door is slammed open up the hallway and a unit of HYDRA agents bursts through.
been a headache, since it seems that handling the PR of the Avengers Initiative seems to fall mostly on Tony's shoulders nowadays that Fury works mostly from underground. Not to mention the World Security Council that has been onto them ever since the Battle of New York. They are getting more persistent with their demands and complaints, and every other Avengers-related incident only seems to be like throwing gasoline into a fire.
. Tony can't believe that he's questioning his current opinion on the world's most infuriating person — and no, it's not Rick. Rick is the person he hates the most in the world — because, dear lord, does Rogers manage to wind him up.
"Still," Steve presses, walking to stand before the engineer. Tony resolutely stares past him at the wall. "It matters that I know, even if you think that I can't help." Rogers clasps his shoulder. "Tony?" he asks for confirmation that his words have been heard.
in science too, correct?"
Rick had just sat through the entire ordeal, not moving a muscle as he had watched their daughter running around, amusement evident on his face, and now he was patiently listening to Rosie's eager description of her latest play, which consisted of astronauts, princesses and the stuffed leopard Clint had gotten her. The beta was really hell-bent on spoiling Tony's kid.
Getting into the base is surprisingly easy.
Dabble is a huge understatement and clearly meant as a slight. Tony decides to ignore it. "Sounds like something Mengele would say, but I guess that's not an insult to you guys, is it?"
"Maybe I did," Tony sniffs at Steve, "Next question?"
"Of course you can, sweetie," he says instead. Rose lets out a happy 'yay' at his answer, and Rogers lowers her to the floor so that she can continue to play.
"I know that," he tells Steve, "But I'm still going to investigate it." He moves against the alpha's hold. "Now, if you're done chiding me and not about to ravage me in that broom closet behind my back, I'm going to have to kindly ask you to let go of me."
. The woman was
He stood up and walked over to the table by the wall and Tony was filled with dread as he wondered what Bates might be retrieving from there. Now that they were free to roam, his hands flew to the bit of chain he could reach, fingers straining for the simple swivel clips. He stopped when, after a brief moment, Bates turned back and walked back over to Tony. In his hand he held a bundle of nylon rope.
"Morning, Stark."
And that's how Tony spent his wedding night.
Tony turns to look at the unconscious alpha, the supposed head of the base. "About some alpha."
He'd forgotten that Rogers knew Peggy also. He feels the need to shrug. "It's a beautiful name."
In the end, all he did was grasp his left fist in his right, squeezing tightly until the joints protested against the pressure. He swallowed and looked for an answer.
"The bow is hard to draw with it on," Clint whines, "It'll be warm once we get inside anyway."
Tony thought that his newfound infertility was due to the god knows what substances he'd been consuming in form of the heavy and cloaking suppressants that Howard had him on, or had something to do with the fact that Tony had been late to present and late in the development of his reproductive organs. Or maybe it was just the stress, or maybe it ran in the family. Maria's pregnancy hadn't been an easy feat either.
"Huh?"
was in a car when her driver disintegrated." As Ezekiel spoke, he brought the cane down on Tony's back a few times, emphasizing his speech. "She survived the crash. She was brought into a hospital because of some broken bones."
"If we find a body..." he begun, trailing off like saying those words was killing him. Which, they probably were. They were killing Steve, at least.
A blinding pain burst across his left shoulder where Ezekiel suddenly struck him. He let out a choked-off shout, twisting in his seat as the pain spread. He forced his eyes to open so he could see what he had been hit with; it was an expandable metal baton.
They end up talking about the team, Rose and their day at Central Park yesterday, enjoying the wine as they do. Sometime around 6:30 PM, just when Tony'd begun wondering what Rose was up to, the child makes her way to the living room, first showing Tony a picture she made, then walking up to Rogers and showing it to him, too, albeit a little more shyly. Tony had been wondering whether she was manifesting some sort of hero worship towards the captain. Well, he couldn't blame Rose. Tony'd been probably just as bad, or even worse, with his Captain America admiration when he'd been a kid.
Okay, yeah, this chapter's bad. I'm so sorry.
Tony sighs because apparently the captain isn't just going to drop the subject. He fishes out his new necklace from beneath the collar of his t-shirt, using his index finger. "This." Steve bends closer to take a hold of the small plate and read the even smaller print on it. Tony chest feels somehow tighter at the sudden proximity.
"I'm here to see our dear Captain, of course," the brown-haired alpha replies, walking over and bending down to peck Tony on the cheek. He's clad in one of his work attires, a stylish dark grey suit that matches the streaks of grey hair on his temples.
"Shit," he cursed shakily.
"Howard...." his Mother pleads, visibly rattled at the sight of her Alpha yelling and trashing objects.
"I'm sure Carl would never talk about another alpha like you talk about Rogers," Rick continues as if Tony hadn't said anything, voice once again angry. He tugs sharply at Tony's shirt, and one button comes loose.
At the bottom of the contract were the signatures of Howard Stark and Chester Darrow, as well as the date the contract had been signed on. Which was today, just for the record.
"Tony," Steve says, and there's something in his voice that Tony doesn't like. "A word, please?"
"Thanks, Tony."
Bates took a step forward, while Tony kept his eyes on Hammer and his face carefully blank. He wasn't afraid of Bates, or Hammer using him to inflict pain on Tony, but he wasn't an idiot either — he was the one at a disadvantage here, and painfully aware of that and what Bates was seemingly capable of.
"It happened nevertheless," Ezekiel said, "Over and over and over again. Until...
"DADDY!"
"You're too slippery for your own good," Bates told him, moving in a way that indicated he was tying the rope into a knot. "And your little stunt just now did nothing to discourage me of the fact."
"Open the doors, that taser shit is starting to wear off," Beard barked, his voice breathless, and Luis and his pal hurried ahead to pull open the back doors. "Stop squirming," he growled at Tony, hands squeezing tighter, the strength of them bruising.
like a normal person." He says 'omega' with such scorn that he feels bad himself. Rick grasps his jaw harshly, gripping it with bruising strength. He's stronger than Tony, being bigger and being an alpha in general, and they both know it.
"Don't lock the door. Five minutes, and I'm coming in," Becker warned, eyeing Tony up and down.
He glances up from his coffee mug. Clint's staring right at the side of his face.
Becker scoffed. "Suit yourself."
He merely nodded in answer. Becker frowned at him.
Hammer huffed. "Yes, you would know about that." A brief silence ensued, and Tony could guess which person, and by extension his son, they were both picturing. He held back a shudder at the reminder. "That's why I needed you, actually."
he's compelled to add silently in his head.
"Uh, woah, spooked me over there for a moment, Cap," Tony tries to salvage the situation, heart racing, but Steve already has a dark look to his otherwise bright eyes. The Captain wasn't stupid, after all, and Tony's flinch with a bruised cut on his cheek were clues good enough.
Soon, Rose's cup is empty, and the toddler is drooping with exhaustion. Still, she keeps insisting to go and hand flowers to the rest of the Avengers.
He turns his cool gaze back to Rick, as if urging him to say something, and when Tony turns to look at his husband too, he notices the tight set of his jaw and the carefully veiled disdain.
"Are you-"
"Tell him to come in," he replies, lowering the tablet so that he can peer in the direction of the elevator and the door to the stairs. Soon, he sees Rogers emerging from the staircase, ever the athlete.
," she said, and when she didn't continue half a second later, Steve decided she was too slow and that action needed to be taken.
Tony twist in his chair when he hears a happy squeal from behind his back. Romanov is playing with Rose, throwing and twirling her in the air as she giggles and tangles her tiny hand in the assassin's red hair. Tony feels the tension leaving his shoulders. A plate of scrambled eggs and toast is set before him.
The alpha smiles at him and Tony suddenly feels a little cold. "It wouldn't do good to spill the beans too early, now would it?"
and presses close to kiss the mating bite on the side of Tony's neck. "Good night, Tony." Then he leaves with a victorious chuckle, having won a round in their never-ending battle for dominance.
"First one out!" she exclaimed happily and Tony studied her face intently. It wasn't covered in blood as he had anticipated.
Tony doesn't usually appreciate it when an alpha offers to help him. It makes him bristle, bringing up memories from his behavioral camps about avoiding being that helpless omega at all costs. It also makes him feel weak, as if getting help meant that he wasn't good enough as it was. But when it comes to Rose, he's willing to swallow his pride. Also, Rogers hasn't given off the impression of being one of those arrogant and patronizing alphas Tony's had a little too much experience in dealing with.
Jim shrugged a little, as much as the rigid armor would allow. "As good as you can expect, I presume." He paused for a moment.
Tony tried not to think about wearing underwear supplied by Hammer as he pulled the briefs on. Still, it was better than going commando and anything would help with keeping him warm when he was to return to the chilly basement in the end.
"You know," Tony begun stiffly, tongue working hard to form the correct sounds, "usually people b-buy me dinner be...before getting all h-handsy." Boss didn't raise to his bait, just kept on groping him. "You got a name?" He paused to breathe. He felt like he'd just run a marathon from saying a couple of easy sentences. "G-gotta know who's mom to send the f-f-," he struggled with the word,
"Tony?" Bruce says, and he sounds like it isn't the first time he has said it.
Rick spun him around as he continued stripping Tony, not satisfied until the omega was completely bare before him.
"I'm sure it will. Come on up here," he replies and picks his daughter up by her armpits. She kisses Tony's cheek gently, and it's true; Tony already feels much better.
The other active members would have to be informed later on. They had connections to all except for Thor, for obvious, space-related reasons, as well as for Spider-Man who had kept his identity hidden after Thanos. Steve had no idea how to contact him. It was Tony's people that always called him in, and Steve hadn't exactly been handed a number.
Tony sighed in relief. A hissy fit avoided.
He listened as Becker stumbled over, collapsing on his knees by Tony's side when he was close enough. He took the gun from him and threw it away, along with any chances Tony might have had of escaping that day.
"Why?" Ezekiel repeated. "For you punishment, of course. For your penance. For your confession."
Beard didn't seem to like that. "Didn't you hear me?" he demanded, his voice rising in volume.
"Now," he begun, shifting his gaze from the chain to Tony's face. "You do as I say, and I'll let you sit in that chair," he nodded his head towards the chair behind his shoulder, the one he had dragged over to the pole, "If you don't, you spend the night here on the floor. Got it?"
The three of them drag the agents into the nearest available room, and continue slowly down, all the way through check point two, to their check point three. Natasha and Thor have also cleared their way to their last check point by then, and are waiting now for the permission to start extracting the prisoners.
"You must be wondering," Hammer trailed off, blowing on his beverage to cool it down.
And so they did, walking close to one another, Rhodey's weapons at the ready and Steve's shield on his arm, despite the fact that the building had been declared empty just some fifteen minutes ago. Steve supposed being too careful couldn't hurt.
"You love being the one consoling me, don't you?"
Steve calls urgently, crouching down and none too gently throwing the head alpha off of him. Clint is dragging the other alpha towards his goon partner who seems to have been knocked out earlier by Tony's blast. He watches as Clint begins securing the two together, allowing Steve to pull him up as he does.
"You need to get cleaned up," Bates said, pulling him up the rest of the way. Tony stumbled along as he walked him to the stairs, hands on his upper arms, and stopped there. "Do you need to be carried?"
Rogers promised to make breakfast around 7 AM, so Tony takes a quick nap and wakes Rose up at 6:30, helping her change from pajamas into a floral dress and a light cardigan, combing her hair and adorning it with a small bow pin to keep at least some of it away from her face (when she had been smaller, Tony had used to dress her up in all kinds of headdresses, but nowadays it's usually just easier to pin the long locks back), then helping her on the potty and washing her face and teeth.
With surprising strength, she pinned Tony's thigh down against the table, quickly disinfecting the area and then stabbing the needle in, pushing down the plunger.
"Yeah, I know."
"Since before you murdered my father," Ezekiel cut in. His voice was flat and his face indifferent, but his eyes were blazing.
Rick graduates the same year as him, and their wedding is held in the following summer. It's hot and it's unpleasant and it's everything that Tony hates. He hates the upper class mannerism that he has to keep up with the wedding guests, the fake smiles, the hollow laughter and the artificial pleasantries. He hates seeing the traditional alpha-omega couples where the omega stands quietly and submissively next to their alpha while they talk their head off. He hates his golden accessories and his traditional white dress suit, its collar cut so that it shows off the column of his neck, unmarred by any mating bite, telling everyone that he's pure and desirable.
Tony's eyes tracked Hammer's hands as he smoothed them over the blueprint. It was spread out on the table in front of him, along with an open notebook and a simple pencil. He was standing on the other side of the table, while Tony was seated by it, glaring up at the other man. Bates was lingering by the wall, as was expected, and the study felt small with all three of them cooped up in there, even if it was of average size, really.
, shriek. Tony couldn't twist to see, all he saw was Beard's back and the asphalt, but he could hear his security chasing them down the alley.
"Clint," she tries to calm him.
At the entrance, Tony tells her to take his hand. There's lots of people at the zoo, and he's a little uncomfortable with crowds. He fears he'll lose the sight of Rose or that she'll get taken, especially with Tony's status as a public figure. Perhaps he's just paranoid (although he thinks it's at least somewhat justified, given Tony's history), but he anyway pushes his sunglasses further up his nose, keeping a firm hold on his daughter's small hand. Rogers seems to notice his unease, either from his body language of from his scent.
"Consider it done, Boss," the one he'd thrown replied, giving Tony a nasty side-eye.
"Will she be going to preschool soon?"
He looked at Becker again, who was now back to swiping on his phone.
. First, you stripped our nation of our best weapons, because you decided that manufacturing and designing them was beneath you. Then, you befriended aliens, going as far as welcoming one into your home with open arms."
Tony sighs. "Sure, Cap." They walk into an empty room nearby that they use to store some stuff, like movies and books, and Tony pulls the door closed behind him, muffling out Rosie's laughter as Nat swings her around. "What is it?"
Tony shook his head desperately, trying in vain to deny the statement, but it was too raw, the wound from his altercation with Steve still festering like an untreated cut. "Steve doesn't—"
"No," he protested, but Becker pulled out two zip ties anyway. He tightened them around Tony's wrists in the form of handcuffs, securing then tightly behind his back. Tony hissed at the rough treatment.
Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
"Good thing I'm ready then," Tony said as he straightened up, grabbing the towel from the counter and wrapping it around his shoulders. His hair was still damp from him washing and scrubbing it, and the towel would work nicely to battle against the cold were he allowed to keep it. Bates raised an eyebrow at him, but didn't otherwise comment.
"So what is he?" he asked, not moving a muscle to eat, "Your manservant?"
Becker raised his eyes to Tony's. "No funny business," he added and pulled the door shut.
In his life Tony had been called by many names. Wonder Boy. The Futurist. The Merchant of Death. Iron Man. Some had claimed he was a one man army.
"Good?" Rick asks, voice breathy. He begins thrusting,
His hands were bound before him, secured with handcuffs again, and Becker took hold of them, readying to haul him up.
"Daddy was tired?" she asks, absently kicking her shoes off as Steve's hands grasp at her feet. The two of them look homely, comfortable in a way that indicates love and mutual trust between an adult and a child, and Tony's head feels warm and fuzzy at the thought. It feels like a proper family.
"Becker!" Marco called, hand grasping Beard's shoulder tightly. Beard didn't react to him, and Tony felt his limbs going numb from panic.
"Come on, do it already!" the one holding him yelled, one hand around his stomach and the other pulling his right arm back. He struggled, shifting his weight, and it made the man lose his balance. He fell painfully on his back against the hard ground, Tony on top of him. Tony twisted and elbowed him, but that was about all he was able to do before he froze completely, muscles seizing up.
Tony closed his eyes, not wanting to see the look on Ezekiel's face as he finally admitted, "I do."
How could his designs be out there? It was like being dosed with cold water, the blowback from that press conference over ten years ago fresh in his mind again. Obie's greasy fingerprints all over everything.
"Steve!" Rose pipes up, running towards the alpha with a spaceship in hand.
"So," Rick begins once Rosie has managed to finally clear her plate, and the waiters are placing small cups filled with crème brûlée before them, as well as filling Tony's glass of wine for the third time that evening. Rick requests a cup of coffee, and Rosie is given juice to go with her water and dessert. "How is the good captain doing?" Rick asks, eyes on Tony as he takes a gulp from his coffee.
the amount of posturing you have to endure when interacting with alphas.
"It's fine, Tony," Steve replies and reaches to pet Rosie's head. "She's a good kid." Tony smiles and Steve takes the opportunity to place the tray before him. "Now, take that break and eat. We already did, right Rosie?"
sending his half-empty coffee mug clattering, not shattering, thank god, against the counter, probably scaring the crap out of the other three as he did. Clint and Steve were staring at him with wide eyes, the latter's hand still slightly extended towards Tony, and Natasha had a somewhat grim but a knowing look on her face.
Tony's heart was pounding in his chest, but he made himself meet Ezekiel's gaze.
"What are we going to do, Steve?" Natasha, always the practical one, was the first to speak.
"Rick!" Tony exclaims angrily and gasps when a bruising kiss is pressed against his neck. Rick takes a hold of his flailing arms, pressing them against the table as he shoves Tony down on it, and changes the kiss so that he's sucking a hickey to the long column of Tony's throat.
"I mean it," Steve clarifies from the other side of the counter, having followed Tony to the kitchen. "I'll do everything in my power to help you out. And Rosie."
When the clock ticks a little over seven, they make their way down to the common floor, Rose sleepily clinging to Tony's neck. She's not really a morning person, very much like her Daddy.
The car ride to their home was uncomfortable. The elevator ride up was uncomfortable. The awkward way their luggage had been deposited inside the otherwise furnished apartment was uncomfortable.
"You know that Ezekiel will be back again today," Hammer drawled, his hands moving to rub at Tony's sore shoulders. Tony held back a hiss as his fingers moved past bruises and welts. "You'll need your energy if you're going to survive another session with him."
When he's finished reading, Steve's face crumbles. "Oh, Howard, how could you....?" Tony hears him ask softly, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. Tony's heart aches at the sight.
Then, about five months later, around Christmas, the Mandarin happened. Tony was barricaded with a swarm of reporters as he spat threats at a camera, almost going as far as inviting the terrorist to his home door.
"How would you know?" Dr. Miller asked.
So far, the brick wall had remained silent.
"Becker, that's enough," Marco warned again, this time with more authority to his voice. "I think you've punished him quite...
He took a peek over his shoulder.
Occasionally, he would doze off from exhaustion, which made it hard to keep track of time. However, it was now very dark outside, and Tony was pretty sure they were over the midnight mark.
Tony bristles and abandons his cup of brûlée in favour of taking his wine glass in hand. He swirls the liquid in its vessel, once again remembering his Mother as he always does when he's holding a glass of wine, and takes a sip. "It's Captain America. Who wouldn't be fond of the guy?"
"What'd they say to you?" he asked before she could pull the door open. Her hand froze on the handle.
He groaned in objection, trying to force his muscles to cooperate. His fingers twitched around the metal of the gun, and his shoulder moved slightly, but that was about it. He heard Becker finally standing up, and dread filled his mind. He was in deep shit now.
"You know you couldn't even hold a candle to him," Ezekiel continued, his voice drowning out the others in Tony's ears. He let go of him as if disgusted and the burn of embarrassment inside Tony intensified. "He hates you, just like the rest of the world."
Steve looks at him with hopeful eyes now, and stands up to walk over to Tony. Tony feels like he should shrink back, but he stands his ground, because it's
"Daddy, when I'm big can I become an....an a...."
Tony snorted. "Which there are a lot of," he mumbled under his breath, but sobered when Bates didn't seem particularly receptive towards his jab. "Fair enough," he said in a louder voice, shifting uncomfortably under Bates' intense stare, "So, I suppose Hammer wants my help designing something then, huh?"
Tony pinned him down to the floor with his knees against his back and a hand to the back of his neck. With his free left hand he pulled out Marco's gun from his waistband.
"Yeah," he replies and pushes the cup towards the alpha's chin, until he takes the hint and gulps down some water.
"What I did to Tony Stark?" she repeated, blinking innocently up at Rhodey. She was exaggerating her movements, like all of this was somehow amusing to her. Steve gritted his teeth as he watched her though the glass.
"You too," Tony manages, head tilting to give Steve better access. Steve kisses his throat for his troubles and Tony can't stop the groan from escaping his lips. The hand Steve had politely kept by Tony's back inches lower, resting just above the curve of Tony's ass. "Oh, yes," Tony agrees, one hand bunching up Steve's shirt and the other twisting in his blond hair.
"It didn't happen just on Earth, it happened on every—"
ed. He changed their position, pushing Tony onto his back against the floor and trapping his arms between their chests. He quickly brought his hands in, sinewy forearms pressing against Tony's upper body, locking his bound hands in place. Tony bucked against him, but couldn't evade him as one of his hands moved to pinch Tony's nose shut and the other covered his mouth. Tony growled against his palm, feet kicking uselessly against the carpeted floor.
"Becker?" Bates finally asked, and Tony felt a finger trace across his shoulder blade where there was a particularly sore welt.
How have you liked the story so far? It's been a ride. Also, I know it says 5/6 chapters at the moment, but the last chapter is going to be long, so I might split it into two separate chapters. I guess we'll see in 1-2 weeks.
"Boss won't like that," Luis suddenly spoke up. Beard ignored him in favor of grabbing Tony by the throat and pushing him tight against the floor. Tony's heart began hammering against his bruised rib cage.
After cleaning up and getting away the worst of the dirt and blood on his person, he made use of the facilities. As he washed his hands, he eyed the set of new clothes on the counter. It was another t-shirt, folded on top of a pair of soft-looking pants. In between there were a pair of briefs and socks.
"No, we'll be going with just the three of us. It's supposed to be a covert mission." He raises his head to look at Tony again. "I don't know how long we'll be gone. Probably for at least a couple months. We need to do some digging and then jumping from base to base."
He thought about his mother's words, given to him a few odd decades ago,
They step into the corridor that Tony is occupying, guns up. Three men, two holding guns, the third standing between them with an impressive poker face in place. He seems irritated, but not overly so.
It took an hour for Marco to stir and take the second watch as Becker got some shut-eye. Tony sat quietly on his spot on the floor, watching them and waiting as they switched positions.
"He has to be. It's domestic violence," Steve interjects. Tony grimaces at the word.
"Honey, Daddy's not strong enough to play this game. You gotta ask Uncle Thor to play with you." He untangles the kid from his leg, but doesn't lift her into his arms like he usually would in fear of her noticing the bruised teeth marks there. He's wearing a casual dress shirt, and the collar is high enough to cover the worst of it, but he still doesn't want her to notice and worry. She's always been very good at spotting any little ailments and then mother-henning, despite being only a toddler herself.
The dream dispersed.
It's a soft kiss, a perfect first kiss, leaving them thirsting for more yet conveying the tender feelings they hold for each other. Tony doesn't let the moment stretch too long, just a quick press of mouth against mouth, but it seems to leave them breathless nevertheless.
Rick tilts his head to one side. "It isn't to the Captain's liking?" he asks mock-innocently and twists a little to look at Steve, who seems to be attempting to contain his irritation.
Rose Margaret Darrow-Stark (Darrow-Stark, because Tony had wanted his daughter to have access to both family names) is born in the spring, May 19, 2010. It's precisely ten days before Tony's 40th birthday, when the ownership of Stark Industries would have completely moved to the Darrow family, no matter if Tony'd given birth to ten alpha heirs after that. Tony would've expected Rick to be angry at the fact, but instead he marvels at the wonder cradled in his omega's arms. Tony almost loves him in that moment. For giving him Rose. For caring for them. For the gentle look in his beautiful hazel eyes. Then he remembers the rapes, the abuse and the hateful words, and remembers that Rick is an alpha and Tony is an omega, and that Tony can never love Rick. So, he lets himself pretend, imagining them as a happy family for a small moment, and just almost loves Rick.
"Genius, trophy omega, billionaire, philanthropist." The words fall easily from his lips.
"Rose will be disappointed. I know she's still not past that princess phase which requires everyone to look like they're out of a Disney movie if the situation so demands." He tips his head towards the table. "I think a luxurious event like this is precisely one of those situations."
"You had a thing with that secretary of yours, didn't you? Pepper Potts?" he asked, and Tony felt a hot surge of protectiveness.
He gasped, cold sweat breaking out all over his body. A high-pitched whining was all he could hear. Someone kicked him and he fell sideways, slumping to the ground. The sound stopped and he could again pull in shaky breaths, but the paralysis was still there, still firmly in place. As it ought to be, after a taste of the sonic taser.
come say hi to me on
Well, if nothing else, Tony thinks they are doing a phenomenal job at keeping their affair (if one could even call it that) a secret. Lingering touches and looks, a quick scenting when it was possible. No kisses. Barely any hugging. No witnesses.
Becker growled, eyes flickering rapidly between Tony, Marco and the gun.
"It's really nothing, Cap," Tony says quietly. Steve's eyes snap back up to his face.
"Hey," he greets Tony, taking a seat in the armchair next to the couch. It's Rick's chair, but Tony thinks that Rogers fits better in it. Shame and guilt flood his mind instantly at the thought. Why would he think that Rogers was a better fit for Rick's armchair than Rick? God, he's messed up. He sighs mentally.
The morning three weeks before his thirteenth birthday, he'd woken up to Jarvis gently knocking against his door and entering his room to get him to rise, as per usual. He still remembers the slight widening of the beta's green eyes and the way he'd quickly closed the door and crossed the room. Tony blinked down at him as he knelt next to his bed, himself scrambling up to sit and have a better look at the older man.
Hi again :)
He sighed and let the face plate pop open. "Hi, Steve."
"Everything looking good? We're all ready to go?"
"Can you scan whose it is?" Steve asked, although he believed he already knew.
"We'll start off easy," Ezekiel said, presenting the crop to Tony. He walked back around, standing behind Tony. Tony braced himself.
"Daddy will fall on his butt if he attempts to swing you around like he has seen Thor do it," he tries to explain and takes a hold of Rosie's hands, but still doesn't pick her up. She stomps her foot a little, and Tony frowns. "Rose," he warns.
are responsible for so much pain and suffering that you couldn't even fathom it if you tried."
He rubbed at his eyes, scratched his beard — the exhaustion from staying up all night was beginning to take its toll on all of them. Rhodey's movements were even sharper and angrier than they had been at the start of the night and Spider-Man, seated behind Steve's back, kept twitching like he was jerking in and out of sleep.
given that Tony's married to another alpha. But, it's not like Tony's going to stop Steve.
Two and half years after their wedding, December 17, 1991, Howard and Maria Stark die in a car accident, alongside with Edwin Jarvis, long-term butler of the Stark family. Tony spends the following week mostly in bed, even managing to worry Rick to some degree, despite their more than hostile relations.
"Tony," Rogers cut him off with a sharp look. "It's not an alpha thing. You're a part of my team, so it's my duty to take care of you." At Tony's dubious look, he sighs again. "I help out Natasha with her workouts and training and Clint I help with his relaxation exercises that his therapist gave him. Sometimes, Thor and I try to figure out things like the Internet together and Bruce....well, Bruce I really can't help with anything other than cooking when he's doing it, since he takes care of himself and I don't know half the words that come out of his mouth when he's talking about his work. But you get my point, right?" He finishes, searching Tony's face. "I wanna help my team members. And that entails helping you. Which apparently consists of taking care of your basic needs, like eating and sleeping...—"
"You're just as bratty as I've heard, Omega Stark," the alpha says, prodding back.
The table looks amazing, set with the finest china they own, a stark white tablecloth, a few candles and even a stunning bouquet that consists of roses, lilies, carnations, lisianthuses and irises. A beta waitress who's just in the process of straightening the utensils flanking one of the three plates on the table nods at him respectfully, before continuing on her task.
"Good morning to you too, Alpha Rogers," Rick says pleasantly. Steve's mouth twitches.
"Hi, Mom." He returns her hug, more than shell-shocked, although he's used to getting hugged or kissed on a cheek as a greeting, being an upper class omega and all that.
, because he didn't want to die.
"Daddy! Steve! Look!" Rose shrieks, running towards them with something in her hands. Barton jogs after her. "This is for you," she says, handing Tony a rock, "and this is for you!" she continues, giving Rogers one of his own. The confusion on the captain's face is priceless.
For some reason, it gave Hammer pause. "Yes," he replied and his tone was vague enough to cause Tony stress about what was to come.
where to strike, sees it clear as day.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the alpha leaning over him. "In your fucking dreams."
, not afraid.
It had made him want to cry in embarrassment. With abductors as inadequate as Becker and Marco, two men whose combined IQs were probably half that of Tony's, both men in their early thirties where the first pains and aches started to appear, clearly amateurs when it came to kidnapping a person, since they were barely able to keep Tony in check....with all of that taken into account, Tony should've been gone hours ago!
he thought and blacked out again.
At two o'clock, Hammer seemed bored and somewhat frustrated, and Tony was drooping in his bonds with exhaustion. Hammer was speaking again, gesturing for Bates to haul Tony back to the basement, when he suddenly stopped. Tony's focus sharpened at that and he listened; the distant sound of car tires on gravel could be heard through the poorly insulated windows.
"I know you can, but apparently you won't, so I'm taking over."
Their fight escalates all the way until they are baiting each other for a brawl, Rogers insisting he put on the suit, but they are stopped by the helicarrier suddenly lurching downwards. Tony's and Rogers' eyes lock in the dim glare of the red emergency lighting.
By the door to the dining room, Tony hesitated. The thought of Hammer and Bates seeing him beaten up, puffy-eyed from crying and crawling like a dog didn't seem very appealing. He shifted his feet, pushing himself up so he could walk the remaining distance. His legs protested the movement, but he knew he could manage that much.
Tony's breath left him in a desperate exhale, but still he refused to answer.
"I was just asking the same thing," Steve said, raising an eyebrow.
There's a sudden

If either party breaks the clauses made in this contract, the deal shall be broken off and redone in favor of the party innocent of breaking the clauses. The rights negotiable in the new contract would be the ownership of the
"Okay, are you all done now?" Tony asks the kid after Nat has risen back up to stand, and Rose is making her way to him.
"Thanks," Rose says, attention wholly on the piece of food. Tony quirks an amused brow at the kid.
"Still remember this?" Ezekiel asked, tapping Tony's back with the end of the crop. He walked over to crouch in front of Tony, pushing him back up. "Now, do as I say, and I won't be forced to use it on you again."
"You are the scum of the earth, Tony Stark," Ezekiel finished by saying, his teeth clenched. He glared down at Tony for a moment longer, before straightening and finally taking in his surroundings; he eyed down at the table, then at Hammer, sitting there dumbly, and Bates standing behind his back. "You expect me to share the table with him?" he asked Hammer, waiting to be challenged.
Hammer laughed again, and Tony thought that listening to the sound of it was getting real old real fast. "To the
"Look away," Beard suddenly told Tony, ire coloring his voice. Tony wanted to sniff at him.
"Glad you're feeling good enough to complain," he says and it's truly a talent how the alpha can roll her eyes so noticeably with her eyes still closed.
