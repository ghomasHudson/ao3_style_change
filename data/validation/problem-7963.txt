Tony turned to look at the girls gazing out the windows and it hit him, “Oh, I see. It’s Monday today, isn’t it?”, he asked.
Tony stared at the guy for a good minute then gave a reluctant okay. He was really cold now that it was mentioned. Steve beamed, taking Tony’s hand and leading him to where his car was parked. Tony blushed at the contact. Unlike his cold hands Steve’s was warm, really warm. He feels like he could hold his hand like this forever.
Tears ran down Tony’s cheeks. This can’t be real. Why did the spell have to wipe away the past 5 year’s memories? Why couldn’t it have been his childhood memories? Or his teenage years in MIT? He definitely won’t mind forgetting those. Why did the fucking spell have to take away the memories of his recent time as ironman, as part of the Avengers, being their friend and the most of all, his memories of Steve?
“Nah, you wouldn’t have,” Tony replied softly, showing Steve that he wasn’t upset by it. That had been on him and him alone. He hadn’t driven that fast before, hadn’t realised that he couldn’t let loose like he did when he was on his own.
to eat, man. Give your body some energy and all.” Okay, it was decided then. Tony reached over to give Steve a strong pat on the shoulder. “Let’s go. We’ll take my car and be back in like an hour or so.”
Steve crossed his arms and sighing loudly. Were they honestly about to pick up that conversation yet again? “Tony, we've been over this. You aren't to blame—”
“I’ve been here for nearly 20 hours and I haven’t seen you eat
The noise that tore itself out of Steve’s mouth mirrored his inner frustration perfectly. Tony had been sent her to help him adjust, to make the first few months easier for him to deal with - and he did that, of course, he did.
It was a shame that the majority of his mind was otherwise occupied. Steve did his best to regulate his breathing, to keep it slow and steady as he continued to stare at the lake. Every instinct in his body told him to turn away and run.
Tony got as far as taking one step before realising that he couldn’t catch up to Rogers, not even if he sprinted. “Hey!” he called out instead, hoping to catch the guy’s attention and slow him down.
“I’m truly sorry, Steve. I got distracted.”
The trip to Burger King had been funny, though it hadn't brought the result that Tony hoped for. Steve had taken one bite out of a burger before deciding that it wasn’t anything for him. Well, one bite still counted as a win, right? Better than nothing at all. What couldn’t be counted as a win was Steve not having left the house again since that trip - until now.
“May I have a word, Steve”, a stoic looking girl asked as she sipped her tea. “I heard that the host club has taken in a kitten with no pedigree”, she continued with a fade smirk.
Rhodey gives him the contact information of a highly renowned – and extremely private – therapist the next day.
So he doesn't.
He's still laying in a hospital bed. It's been two weeks, and, sure, Tony still aches all over but it's nothing he can't handle, and he wants to go

knew, was always there to whisk him away whenever the urge to punch someone rose up.
Tony didn’t think it through, now that he’s actually thinking about it, because Steve, thoroughly caught off guard, lands heavily on top of him, which causes him to let out a soft, “Oof,” as the air is pressed out of his lungs.
Still. It’s too early, and Tony wants to sleep and wants Steve to stay, so. No one can blame him if he gets a little bratty about it, can they? And no one can blame him if he, using Steve’s relaxed state, tugs Steve down onto the bed to keep him there, preferably for the rest of the day.
, and he's not going to think about Steve's stupid fucking letter, either.
. Keeping his eyes from sliding shut is an obstacle that Tony did not consider when he decided to wake up and attempt to stop Steve from leaving. He’s already just starting and the mission is practically in shambles.

Tony is falling asleep.
But that wasn't even the big issue. The big issue was that the Avenges were allowed to freely roam and stomp and indirectly hurt people, and Tony wanted them to answer for that. Tony had already indirectly hurt thousands – maybe millions – of people while he'd been making weapons, and he hadn't been answering for that. Was it really so wrong of him to want things to be different now that he was explicitly on the right side of things?
Yes, he can.

War is subjective and history books are written by the winners. Tony knows that like the back of his hand now – he wishes he had known it sooner – and he knows that the statement applies pretty well to the situation with Steve.

Tony wakes up screaming a week after he makes the decision to leave Parker alone.
FRIDAY manages to send a signal to Vision as Tony's eyes slip closed, the song playing out into the room, sung in Captain Rogers' voice.

And Tony knows that, he swears he does, but he gets a little unreasonable and irrational and overly emotional when he’s awake at ungodly hours in the morning, so it’s not his fault that all he does is squeeze harder, shaking his head again, and say, “No,” the pout on his lips audible in his voice. If it’s anyone’s fault, it’s Steve’s, because Steve is just so -

He supposes he could try to figure it out himself. He's certainly smart enough to, and he'd be able to do it without much difficulty, but he'd also probably refuse to one, recognize his problems, or two, not know how to fix said problems.
Now, he smiles for the cameras, but without Steve or anyone else from the team there with him, they feel empty. Wrong. Different. Now, when he has to go meet with someone important when he'd rather do anything else, he doesn't have anyone to make him give genuine laughs, not that anyone would be able to tell the difference between one of his real laughs and his fake ones.
Tony's not sure what Friday decides to put on, but it's loud enough to drown out his thoughts before they can drown him and that's all Tony really wants.

The words come off Tony's tongue as an insult, but Steve, God bless him, hears them for what they really are and just hums again. "If anything," he tells Tony, voice casual but words packed with meaning, "I'm the one that doesn't deserve you."

Tony waves her away, touched by her concern but not enough to show it. He's learned in all his years of life that you don't show your feelings, even to those you trust with everything in you. "I'll be fine, I've been doing this for years."
"It's nice to know you have such faith in my abilities to cope," Tony says, voice sarcastic as he searches for any amount of humor he can find in this situation.
But he also doesn't want to give Rhodey the satisfaction of being right, because he's petty like that, and proving Rhodey wrong will always come before doing something that might actually help him.
Tony hates him. But, you know, hates him in a love way. Rhodey is like the brother he never had, and it makes him sort of glad that he's an only child; if he grew up with a brother like Rhodey, he's not sure he would've made it all these years. Rhodey is annoying.

Rhodey scowls right back. "Tony, you've done nothing but wallow ever since –" He, wisely, Tony thinks, cuts himself off before he can finish his sentence, continuing instead with a sigh. "Look. You feel guilty, even though you shouldn't, and you're keeping everything locked up inside. It's not
Tony waits for a minute or two, staring down at the card and the numbers that he can just barely make out in the darkness – which doesn't matter, he memorized the phone number not long after he saw the card; one of the downsides to being a person who doesn't forget numbers easily – before he starts dialing. He puts his phone up to his ear and raises his other hand to play with his bottom lip as the line rings and rings. A machine answers, saying that the office is closed, and Tony hangs up, cursing as he realizes it's only just past one in the morning.
Even if that means putting up with the man's running habit.
“What’s the time, J?” Tony asks.
When Steve sings, his voice is slow and deliberate and drips with sweetness. It causes Tony's mind to slow down to listen to it, causes the constant buzzing in his head to fade into the background until all he can think about is Steve and Steve's

FRIDAY liked Captain Rogers. He was honorable, and, while wary of her at first, after the Ultron situation, quickly warmed up to her when she was young. He treated her with respect, like he treated the rest of the team, and FRIDAY admired that.

It always happens early in the mornings, and Tony gets the answering machine for the therapist's office each time. He's starting to think that the universe is making him have these nightmares and the want for them to stop so he'll call the therapist's office and have no one answer, just so Tony can be reminded that there's nothing he can do.

Mainly because he’s very much procrastinating, which is going to annoy Pepper, but also because he kept losing to Natasha so bad that his pride has taken a huge hit and he needs time to recover from that.

Therapy would probably help with that, but Tony's pride is too big. And he's also kind of scared. What if all therapy does for him is reaffirm the fact that he's a messed up human being and there's no way to fix that?
“It is five thirty-eight in the morning, sir.”
Natasha sees the moment Tony sinks back into the couch and smirks, knowing she’s had her victory. She sits down next to Tony, bringing her legs up to sit criss-cross. Tony has half a mind to tell her to keep her feet off his couch, but then she’d do something scary like - Tony doesn’t know,
He's lazy, sue him.
"Fri?" Tony questions, his voice standing out in the silence of the part of the Medbay he's staying in. His eyes are wide open as he stares at the ceiling, but he can't bring himself to close them, not with his brain running at 60 miles an hour. "You awake?"
He sits up, his heart pounding in his chest, and he's extremely grateful that both Pepper and Rhodey are away from the Tower right now. Flashes of Afghanistan, and New York and the portal he flew through, and Ivan, and Killian, and Ultron and everything else he's ever been through runs through his mind.

"Yeah, baby girl," Tony says, his voice quiet. "Probably. I don't want you to, and I wish you didn't have to but - you will."
Steve hums, his breath ghosting over Tony's neck and causing him to shiver. "Stop questioning my feelings for you."
However boring it is, Tony finds ways to distract himself. He gets Pepper to bring him paperwork to read through and sign, and he gets Rhodey to bring him Rubik's cubes and other similar puzzles to keep himself occupied. Tony also talks to Friday. After getting her to delete all recordings of the bunker – only off the main servers, though; he instructed her to keep it backed up in a secure place so he could watch it again and again when he needed something to obsess over and dissect – he didn't talk to her for a while. Mostly out of shame, but also because he was - scared.
Tony sighs again – he just wants to
It’s a win for Tony, as Steve is warm and soft, and he buries his face into Steve’s neck, letting out a soft sigh. Steve, in a show of strength that Tony would be more turned on by if he was more awake, doesn’t make a sound or break a sweat as he stands up and puts his hands on Tony’s back.
(Everything is most definitely not good.)

Anyway, Pepper's worry is well-founded, considering everything, but Tony is–
And Tony loves it.
Idly, and not for the first time, Tony wonders if it's his fault. He should've fought harder against the Accords, he knows that, but - He just wanted to be held accountable for things. He wanted the Avengers to be able to face the consequences for the damage they caused in the process of

Opening his eyes and swinging his legs off of the couch, Tony starts to stand up so he can make his way to his lab and get started on some project – he has a lot of them that he hasn’t been working on, and he’s starting to fall behind on his workload – but before he can move any further, Natasha is standing in front of him.
Pepper nods and gives him the most understanding look Tony has ever been on the receiving end of.

The fact that he doesn’t even hesitate speaks more about him than anything he has ever said.

it, so what is he supposed to do when the literal love of his life is playing with his hair – not lean into it?
He lets out a huff and closes his eyes, almost complying with the unspoken order from Natasha to stay on the couch that was clear as day in her voice. But then he realizes that Steve is not the boss of him and that Steve can’t stop him from doing anything.
"Probably off somewhere thinking about how perfectly
Eventually, with Friday being her persistent self, Tony grew a pair and voiced his fears, and, well – Here they are.
Take that, Pepper.
Steve is bright and warm and shines down on everyone, so, for all intents and purposes, Steve
Tony retaliates with a pinch to Steve's side, but Steve just laughs, the sound a warm and fond thing that pushes its way into Tony's chest and curls around his heart.
Tony considers the threat. Natasha, unlike Steve, is a bluffer – it’s probably a requirement of her job and a big part of her skill set – but that doesn’t mean that Tony can tell her bluffs apart from things she’ll actually do. He ends up grumbling underneath his breath as he gives in, but only because Thor is one heavy guy, and Tony doesn’t want to risk all of that weight on his chest.
Tony swallows again, the lump in his throat growing bigger. There's a scar on his chest, one that's there as a result of Steve driving the shield into Tony's chest, and it starts aching as Tony says his next words. "'Cause Steve's not here. Like - normally he'd be here drawing or painting or sketching or something, and. He's not. And it's weird."
Maybe that's why he likes it when Steve sings.
The thing that gets to Tony the most is the fact that he's alone again.
The arc reactor powerd the suit. With the suit's arc reactor destroyed, Tony only has a limited amount of power at his disposal, not nearly enough to power up the thrusters and get out of here.

It's the thought that counts, right?
How long had Steve been lying to him? How long had Steve stopped coming by his lab to hang out and talk (and sometimes have sex, but that's not the important thing) under the guise of
That raises a question in Tony's mind.
He told Tony, repeatedly and with the utmost sincerity, that he would never hurt him. And yet, he did. Captain Rogers left Tony here to die.
. He just wants to take a few weeks to himself and sit and do whatever he wants without having to face anybody. He doesn't want to live up to all of his responsibilities, he just wants to disappear for just two weeks, three at most. After that, he'll come back and work his ass off and deal with everything.
“If you don’t lay back down, I’ll have Thor come and sit on you.”
Tony’s vision is blurry, but he can just barely make out Steve in the darkness – and
"Tony. I know that the last few weeks have been hard, and I don't blame you for wanting to get away. Okay," she adds after Tony gives her a disbelieving look. "Maybe I blame you a little bit, but that's not the point." She sighs. "Things have been hard, and you're still adjusting to being without... everybody else, and that would be completely okay if you weren't on the path to killing yourself."
things was pointless – he still does – but now he can't deny that he does feel
He sees the smile on the blond man's face and rolls his eyes before closing them again. Asshole. "Yes," he huffs, feigning annoyance even though he feels anything but, "the song. Stop being an ass, you know which one I'm talking about."
For a hot minute – meaning for a good, long while – Tony considers going out and finding someone to have sex with. He doesn't even know why, doesn't know why he wants to go party and come back with a one-night-stand. He doesn't do that anymore. He hasn't in a long time, and he doesn't want to break his streak.
. "How the fuck do you always know what I'm thinking?"
Steve, to his credit, doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that Tony's head almost landed on his favorite book, he just sets it aside, somewhere that Tony can't be bothered to look. He threads one hand through Tony's hair and rests the other on Tony's lower back. "Sing?" he questions quietly, his hand softly untangling the strands of Tony's hair in a slow manner that is just -

and Tony can’t have that. So, really, there’s nothing else for him to do but wrap his arms around Steve and cling to him like a koala latches onto their mother. At least, Tony thinks that’s the right animal. To be completely honest, Tony’s brain is only running at about fifty percent of his total possible brainpower, and he’s so out of it that he can’t bring himself to think about it and find the right animal for the metaphor he’s trying to push across in his head.

, even – but Steve
It's a good thing she didn't give in to Tony asking her out because their relationship would've been ruined behind repair and Tony doesn't think he could handle not having Pepper in his life.
He half expects Steve to mock him, but Steve doesn’t do that because Steve is respectful and nice and not one to act like a literal four-year-old. Instead, Steve calmly replies, “Tony,” and that just serves to make Tony even more determined to never let go.
He walks back over to his bed and sits down on the edge of it, grabbing his phone from the nightstand.
Everything is good.
. He's never had his heart broken before, but that's because he never let anyone in as far as he did Steve. No one else knows all of his quirks (read: issues) like Steve does, no one accepts said quirks (issues) like Steve does, no one
What's pathetic is that the only relationships with people he's managed to keep over the years, and not completely smash to pieces, are his friendships with Pepper and Rhodey – and even those bonds get tested sometimes.
The point about all of this is - well, Tony doesn’t have a point. All he knows is that it’s way too early for him to be
at approximately eleven-twenty-four, and there's no reason for you to be out of bed doing anything for the next three hours and twenty-two minutes."
Apparently, he made a sound that was most likely supposed to represent his overall unhappiness with the situation because Steve, dressed in a tight T-shirt and running shorts, is leaning over him and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Tony looks up to see Natasha staring down at him. To anyone else, she’d probably look deadpan and emotionless, but Tony has grown close enough to Natasha to see the way the right corner of her mouth is slightly tilted up and the way her shoulders have lost their usual tense edge to know that she’s amused.

He tells Pepper as much. He expects her to go on an angry rant about

It stabs him through his chest and steals the breath out of his lungs.

come. Now, he's been not sleeping for at least three days only to turn around sleep for two hours, three if he's lucky. It's all adding up. He's irritable – more so than usual – and tired and he can't focus on anything. He hasn't been out of his lab for the past week, and the only reason he's out now is because Pepper threatened bodily harm and Pepper is scary.
Tony doesn't make a sound.
His eyes don't open and he's already shoving himself against Steve's side, contently sighing when Steve turns on his side and pulls him closer, making it so their chests are pressed against each other's and Steve's face is buried in Tony's neck. There's just something comforting about being pressed up against Steve, and Tony can say he does it for warmth all he wants – the fact of the matter is that Tony likes it, and that's all there is to say. Or not say. Honestly, Tony lost track of all the things he can or cannot admit to a long time ago and he doesn't feel rested enough to even
A week after he's released from the hospital and taken off of bed rest, Rhodey tells him to see a therapist.
After the accident that killed his parents, no one sang to Tony anymore. Tony thought that was a good thing, but –
Not enough to make him start doing it regularly, of course not, just the thought is ridiculous, but maybe enough to make him kind of reconsider his stance on the therapy thing.
him, and it's such a difference from the greedy and sexual touches Tony used to get from the endless rotation of women and sometimes men, such a difference from the echoes of Howard's firm grip on his arm and Maria's timid and shaking touch on the small of his back.
Natasha shoots him a glance and follows it up with a sharp grin. “And kick your ass? Gladly.”
"Science."
Long story short: no one is coming to save him, and he's going to die alone.
(He's ignoring the fact that he's most likely doing it because of Steve. The nightmares have been happening for years and Tony's been fine, and then, all of a sudden, Steve shows up as an attacker in one and

around. Rhodey comes by, and so does Pepper and Happy, and Friday is always here. But that's different. He had someone, someone who he let see all of him, all of the things he hides from everyone else, and that's gone now.
(Still, for some reason, he doesn't toss the card in the trash.)
. God.
The look Pepper is giving him is soft and loving and Tony's not sure he likes it all that much. He feels vulnerable, like he's just given out his greatest weakness – which he actually might have done – and he doesn't like it, so he clears his throat and stands up.

Tony is frozen in place, eyes locked onto the fire burning in Pepper's, and her words hit him like a brick in the chest.
Tony has tried to stay awake for as long as possible so he can pass out without issue, and it kind of works. He doesn't ever remember having a nightmare, but he always wakes up in a cold sweat with a pounding heart, and what other conclusion is there to come to?
Tony like Steve does, and Steve
"Well, that was just a guess," Steve chuckles, and Tony rolls his eyes. "But it's easy. You think so loud it's pretty much impossible to
But when is he not?
He's still probably not going to go, but that's irrelevant, so. It looks like Tony is pretending to think about seeing a therapist.
They make sure that Tony going to therapy doesn't get out. The media would start raising hell and giving him shit for it, and Tony doesn't want that. He wants to see if there's any way to fix everything that's wrong with him, and he doesn't want to do that while simultaneously dealing with whatever the media would say. And the fallout that the company would go through if it got out that Tony Stark was going to therapy – even saying to himself sounds weird – is something that no one wanted to think about, so the only people who know are himself, Happy, Rhodey, Pepper, the therapist – who Tony refuses to know the name of beforehand, so as not to give his brain a reason to decide that he doesn't want to go after all – and a few select others who signed pretty extensive confidentiality agreements.
The nightmares about Steve don't stop. They're always about the same thing, with some variation, but they

. He's clingy, and he gets attached too easily, and he works too much, and for too long, and he can't properly take care of himself because he forgets to eat or sleep, and he's an emotionally constipated piece of shit that doesn't deserve love and affection and his recent relationship failure with Steve just proves that.
So, he ends up not responding, laying his head down on Steve’s shoulder while he waits for Steve to relent and climb back into bed and hold him for a few more hours.
Tony doesn't exactly know how he ended up with Steve Rogers – and he sure as hell doesn't know how he hasn't done anything to completely ruin it – but right now, in this moment, Tony knows that he's going to try his absolute hardest to keep him.
But Tony guesses that's what he signed up for when he got attached to Rhodey. Curse him and his need for affection and relationships with people.
Steve has sang a lot of songs to Tony, most of them soft and soothing and

left him to die in the cold, die living one of his worst nightmares, for another man.
– but he can't let Pepper know that.
Pepper frowns. "What do you mean?"
In the nightmare, Steve drove the shield into his chest, just like he had in real life, and pulled it out again. But, this time, he didn't stop there. He did it again and again and again, all while looking Tony right in the eye, until blood was spattered across his face and Tony's mouth filled up with blood as his ribs broke and punctured his organs and Tony

. Steve risked everything, broke multiple laws and forced Tony into this position, for Barnes. Tony gets it. Barnes is Steve's best friend, a friend that was presumed dead for the past 70 years. Tony would do the same thing if it was Rhodey. The issue he has with this is the way Steve is looking at Barnes, a look that Tony thought was reserved for him (Tony) and him (still Tony) alone.

"Please don't take my sunshine away."
– it wouldn't be the first time – but she sags instead, all of the fight leaving her.
The bathroom door opens and closes again and Tony forces his eyes to open. Its opening and closing the first time is exactly why Tony is awake at whatever God-awful time Steve goes on his runs (which is at 5 in the morning

Vision had shown up right as Tony was beginning to lose consciousness, and had managed to get him medical assistance before the damage had become irreversible. Which isn't to say the damage

different. Not in a good way, never in a good way. It was different because this time, Steve had been one of the nightmares, too.
The song starts playing and Tony can immediately feel the difference in temperature as power is taken from the heaters. Tony suspects that he would be crying if he wasn't so cold.
(Though, it might be the song.)
FRIDAY turns the heaters on, and the warmth provides a small amount of relief. He knows the heater will fail eventually, he can already feel his face going numb, and he needs to get some sort of signal out. Rhodey is incapacitated, so is the young Peter Parker, he doesn't trust Natasha, not anymore – if he ever did – Thor and Bruce aren't here, the rest of the team is God knows where, and it'll take anyone else far too long to reach Tony before he succumbs to either his physical injuries, injuries given to him by Steve, or hypothermia.
irreversible because, well, it is – Tony's pretty sure he's going to have a permanent ache in his chest for the rest of his life. But, the doctors said he would be fine, so it's not like Tony can complain.
Tony is just now realizing how bad he was at reading Steve.
“Tony, I’m just going to run for an hour, and then I’ll come back and stay in the bed with you for as long as you want.”
Tony has always liked music.
"Says who?"
"Me being dead is the most likely option."
"No," he breathes out, his voice shaking. "No, it's okay, I'm fine."
After a few moments of silence, Tony speaks.

(Tony, Tony knew, that's why he always doing something.)
Maybe that was the problem, though. The "right side" of things. Is there a right side to anything? Tony had been selling weapons to the US government, but his weapons had also ended up on the opposing side, and each side believed that they were in the right.
After another kiss to his forehead, Steve pulls back, taking his warmth with him, and Tony doesn’t bother to hold back a whine like he normally would. He forces his eyes open again, not even sure when they closed, and sees Steve standing in front of him. He lifts an arm and reaches for Steve, who he sees hesitate as if he’s debating something.

Regardless of Tony’s sleeping habits, he goes back to sleep and wakes up to Steve sliding into bed next to him.

At some point, fifteen or so minutes before Steve comes back from his run, Tony goes back to his bed with the full intent of sleeping for a
But then Steve clenches his jaw, eyes filled with regret. And Tony knows it's all over.
Tony makes a happy humming sound in the back of his throat, and he’s seriously considering staying here, like this, and never leaving. His legs are wrapped around Steve’s back and his arms hang over Steve’s broad shoulders and Tony could work like this, just direct Jarvis to do things for him, or he could look over Steve’s shoulder and work like that. This position is the greatest position Tony has ever been in, and it’s not even mildly sexual. Well. It could be, Tony guesses, if one tried hard enough.

Steve hums again. "Yeah, I know. And it's wrong."
. For once in his life, he wants his brain to stop whirring and figuring things out and examining everything he's ever done in his life, and he wants it to happen without having to work himself to exhaustion. That's usually how he deals with it, he goes into his lab and doesn't eat or sleep until he inevitably passes out and that's that. His brain goes quiet and he can actually get some fucking sleep without the threat of nightmares looming over him like some big bad villain.
"Then science is wrong."
how much the death of his parents messed him up, just like Steve knows that Tony doesn't deal with emotions well.
to let go, and Tony doesn’t know when he got this clingy and attached, but, fuck it – it happened, and Tony is going to embrace it to the fullest extent.
Most of the time, Tony loves the fact that Steve knows so much about him, but sometimes it gets on his nerves.
, in a way. Like, it's still there, but it's more manageable.
“Yep,” Steve says, already turning around and making his way out of the bedroom and towards the elevator. “You know, since you won’t let go of me.”
Tony pouts again as he continues to hang off of Steve. There’s a small bounce in Steve’s steps – because

Running is a practice sent to Earth by the devil him-fucking-self, and Tony loathes it with every last cell in his body.
(Just the thought of it has a ball of negative emotion rising in Tony's chest, and maybe he pushes into Steve's hand just a little bit harder.)
"To go and see a therapist, yes," Rhodey responds patiently, unable to completely mask the underlying strain in his voice as he takes slow step after step. Tony opens his mouth to speak, but Rhodey continues. "You need it, Tones. I'm not going to push you if you're really against it, but. You should consider it, at the very least," he says, shooting Tony a pointed look.
, obviously. He doesn't offer Steve any other reply than the weird huff/laugh sound his throat decided to produce, and it's okay because he doubts that Steve was looking for one, anyway.
But Tony is so

Tony blinks, swallows, and then blinks again. Okay. He can do this. It's all fine. He doesn't have to say too much, just enough so she knows he's
"You haven't slept in three days!"
he’s excited to subject Tony to this – but Tony ignores that. Steve runs freakishly fast – Tony knows that because he may or may not have secretly followed Steve out one day and he saw a blur and that was that – so Tony is most likely going to be bouncing around the whole time, which means he might as well revel in the comfort Steve’s steps are providing him.
Steve hums, the sound somehow managing to come off as amused and a little bit patronising and loving and a dozen other things all rolled into one. "I'm not sure I do. You'll have to be more specific."
with one of those knives she can pull out at a moment’s notice, and Tony doesn’t want to risk that, either.
Tony yelps when Steve pinches his side. It was a relatively soft pinch, one that Tony barely even felt, but still. It’s the principle. “Hey!”
"What?" Tony spits out, angry even as guilt sits in his throat at the sight of Rhodey struggling to walk, even with the braces he threw himself into making. "I'm sorry, I must've heard you wrong, I thought you said –"

“Sorry,” he whispers. “Didn’t mean to wake you up.”
When Steve starts back up his attempts to dislodge him, Tony doesn’t worry all that much – Steve never actually uses the full extent of his strength because he doesn’t want to hurt Tony, which means that the likelihood of Tony getting off of him is extremely low.
He never wants to go through this again, and he'd make sure of that if he could.

A strangled sound leaves Tony throat – there are too many feelings going through his head right now, and he's never been a feelings person – and he decides to skip the dance that they do every day. "Can you

It's not like Tony would be able to cause that much damage, because he's not extremely important to anyone except Rhodey and Pepper and Happy, and he doesn't have a huge emotional impact on the lives of others.

deserve Steve – because Steve is good, and kind, and everything that Tony is not – but Steve doesn't see it that way. If anything, Steve thinks that it's the other way around and, fuck, if that doesn't mess with Tony's heart a bit.
“It’s fine. You’re okay”, she said smiling at him, stroking his head in an affectionate manner. “What is with the big coat on you though?”
~~~~~~
“Yeah, I’m worried as well”, the other agreed staring down at the school gate. Seemingly waiting for said person.
“Ah, I’m so hungry~ I don’t think I have enough energy to make it to the canteen. Brucie, be a dear and carry me there”
“Are you alright?”, Steve asked, snapping out of the thought and Tony knew he was talking about last night. He nodded and thanked him again. “Oh, I forgot to give you your blazer back. I’m sorry I didn’t have enough time to wash it though”, he said taking out the cloth and handing it to Steve.
“We were just leaving”, saying that Tony went for the door but stepped on a banana peel lying at the last step, losing his balance. Tony fell backwards and accidentally knocked down a vase, an expensive vase.
“ ‘I couldn’t fall in love with you. Let’s break up’ “, Pepper repeated the famous last words of Steve Rogers to his girlfriends.
Steve made an attempt to open his mouth in response but then stop. After a few deep breaths he finally spoke. “Tony, you didn’t know who I was when you woke up. You didn’t remember me, about us. I was so scared, so heartbroken when you told me you didn’t know me. It felt like I was torn apart from the inside”, Steve confessed, shedding tears again.
“Hello, it’s Steve”, he slurred out in a sleepy tone. The person laughed on the other line.
“Steve!”, he called again and the blonde quickly looked back, right at him.
Somehow….everything seems to be progressing too quickly. He thought as he walked back to home, wind blowing gently along the way.
I might be busy watching Young Justice so I posted this chappie in advance lol. Btw I can't stand superboy being canon couple with Miss Martian (- . -) I ship him with Robin otherwise no one at all.
“Don’t answer me with a question! And you better not skip it mister. I decided that I’m going to go watch the match today and you’re gonna play. This is what happens when you wake me up for no reason. I’m getting my revenge. That’s all”
“Why did you do that?”, Bruce asked
“Don’t be so dramatic, Tony. I’m sure it isn’t as bad as you said it”, Pepper told him. He wondered what she would react when she finds out that it is exactly as he told her. After talking with them a few more minutes about when they’d have their movie night he ended the call and slept on the couch until his mom came home. After dinner he was still tired as fuck. He’s never like this unless he put up a week of all nighters on his projects. Just one day at SHIELD sure did a number on him. He didn’t think he’ll survive even the month if things keep going like this. The school was not good for his health.
“I’ll give you an example, Rogers. Listen carefully. There are many types of girls. Like the shy looking type or the sexy type or anything along those lines”, Tony blabbered on.
“Rogers, you should lock up even if you have nothing worth stealing”, he said as he peaked inside the bedroom.
Tony felt himself blush, “I…I’m Tony. I got a scholarship to study here recently. So, um, yeah, thought I’d drop by?”, he squeaked out.
Getting into the separate class for the specials Tony let out an annoyed growl. Barnes was waving at him with a smirk plastered on his lips. He really hates that smugness of him. Felt like building a robot to drop the guy off a mountain or something else, something that would hurt. He glared at the guy. But then he noticed the handsome blonde sitting beside him. It was none other than the host club president, Steve Rogers.
“I’m so sorry, Steve. God, I’m sorry. But it’s alright now. Everything’s fine now, okay? You know I hate to see you like this”, he said cupping his face.
Tony followed Bruce to the cafeteria, feeling a light rumble in his stomach. “Damn, you call this a cafeteria?”, he asked amazed, gaping at the huge dining hall. It was set up just like how a high class restaurant would be and they were free buffet at one corner.
“Not at all, Barnes. Just speaking out my mind”, the genius said with a mischievous grin. Bucky tried to get up from his desk trying to punch Tony but Steve pulled him back down
Tony nodded in understanding. So even he has someone he was serious about before. If it was just another one of his flings I’m sure he won’t react like that.
“Oh, no, I was just concerned about Tony. It’s his first time doing this kind of thing”
“Thor where could we find your brother”, Bruce asked the long haired blond.
“And then there’s that face of yours you have whenever you finish a project or solve a difficult problem, which makes you seem like the prince which these naïve girls have been fantasizing. Well, it’s not hard to understand why they would”, she explained.
Seven days to see what’s in my heart. It’s short but it’s enough.
“It’s not like that, Tony”
Steve was watching the film quietly in his seat. He was surprised when there was a heavy mass on his shoulder. He looked to his side to find Tony leaning on his shoulder, snoring lightly.
“Someone of high class like Steve won’t want to really drink something for commoners. You’d probably get stomach cramps instead, my dear Steve”, the girl from before who had asked about Tony said as she set down her cup. Acting all cool and mysterious.
“Why is that? The water is marvelous. One needs to experience this in action”, Thor replied trying to reach for him again. Tony made a run towards Bruce to hide behind him but ended up pushing him into the pool. He fell in yelling ’TONY!’.
“He can be the playboy type”, Bucky told them with a smirk.
‘Oh’ was the only thing Tony managed to let out as the bell rang for their next class.
“Don’t you like Shawarma?”, the brunette asked halfway into his plate, eyeing his junior.
“This smells good”, Steve said getting a whiff of the pizza he was holding.
Tony came over to his side and took it. He soon let out a sigh of relief. “Yeah, it is….Thanks, Pres”, he told the blonde who smiled, telling him that he was happy he could help.
A painful throb hit Tony, like an arrow being shot right through his head. What the fuck is this? It hurts as hell. He clutched his head tightly in an attempt to sooth the pain. But it wasn’t going away. Clenching his hands on both side of his head he let out a whimper of pain, earning Steve’s attention.
“Brother, is there nothing you can do?”, Thor pleaded. Looking over to his brother, Loki maintained the stare for a while and let out a long sigh. He then told Thor that he might be able to lessen the amount of memory loss. But he’s not sure it’s enough and could instead cause permanent damage to the Avenger’s other memories.
“Are you an idiot? Hey, you’re an idiot, right?”, Tony said on the other side of the call. He sounded pissed.
“Not cool, Thor. I told you I don’t wanna go in. I have issues with a huge amount of water like over here for example”, he said pointing at the pool.
“No,no, no. We made a mistake. Sorry, but we better get going, right, Bruce?”, Tony quickly replied trying to shove Bruce out the door.
Tony was laughing so much while Steve profusely apologized as he gave the shoes to be packed by the shopkeeper. He gazed over to Tony who was still trying hard to clam himself down, failing miserably. He felt a bit angry at the prank but…
“I dunno, something cool and interesting like a test or challenge?”
Was he always the type of person who’d go out of his way to make friends with others? The brunette pondered as he and Steve exchanged phone numbers and e-mail address.
“What the fuck?! The hell were you doing in the vents?”, Tony exclaimed as he took the offered hand and got up. “Listening to gossips, playing pranks and hiding from Natasha”, the guy replied simply.
“I’m afraid Ironman has been hit with a powerful magic. Magic which steals his memories of the past 5 years. When did this happen?”, Strange asked, concern acing his voice.
“Do you have something on?”
Tony's promoted to the rank of host and has to deal with a crazy fan
First I want to thank all of you readers for reading my fanfic. A special thanks to those who left kudos and bookmarks. It means a lot since it's my first work in ao3 as well as first time writing BL fanfic.
Not able to form proper words he shouted a bunch of ‘stupid’ and ‘idiots’ and a ‘go die’ to the blond before he went running to class leaving behind a confused Steve.
Steve was lying on his bed, the sheets covering his whole body except the tip of his head. The messy dirty blond hair poking out with his back towards Tony.
“It’s not bad, Rogers. I rather enjoy the food here, not bad at all”
“Hmmm, so it’s gonna start now, huh?”
“Steve…”
Thinking back on Barnes maybe he wasn’t that bad a guy he seemed to be according to Bruce. You can’t be that bad if you fight for the weak, right? Maybe he’ll try to befriend the guy. While pondering on the thought he ends up slamming into a wall.
“Hey, did you guys forget about the pizza already? Someone’s gotta get them right? I told the delivery man I’d wait for it in front of the school gate. Laterz~”, the brunette replied throwing his pen at him which Rhodey easily caught.
“What?!”, she shrieked out.
“Don’t ever do that again. Please don’t leave me”, Steve begged, placing a kiss on Tony’s palm.
“By the way, I wanted to ask..”, Steve started but Tony cut him off telling him not to change the subject.
I think one week is enough for a dream. Steve…he’s perfectly faithful. He remembered Pepper saying that about him.
“Maybe we should stop for the day. We should get back, Tony”
“Tony, yesterday you..”, he said a bit aspirated but got cut off by Tony.
After a while the bus came. The two students stepped up and went into the bus, paying for their ride. Taking a seat Tony let out a tired sigh. “I’m so sleepy and hungry”
“Did something happened, Tony? You seem really pissed”, Bruce enquired.
“Oh? How about I come over there so you can punch me?” he teased, laughing again. He was expecting a smart come back but the line fell silent. Uh oh, he stopped talking. This is scary.
“I’m so pissed right now. I just want to punch you in your perfect teeth”, he gritted out.
“Oh, you must be one of the students who got the proficiency scholarship. You must really be smart as the school only gave out three of them. Come, I’ll take you to the vice principal. He’s the one who deals with this kind of stuff”, Steve said with a smile spread across his lips. And Tony felt as if he’d been blinded by the smile. It’s too fucking bright damn it.
“I can’t help it. I feel as if I’m in a dress. It’s too formal and feels suffocating. Had to mix it up a little”, Tony explained.
Tony was quiet for a moment, grin slightly faltering before he caught himself. “Oh, but I
The fact that it had something to do with Howard, who was a sore topic even when Tony was in a good mood, also wasn’t helping the situation.
A painfully silent minute follows until Steve is apparently satisfied that nothing has happened to his prized possession. Slowly, his hands drop down, both still clutching at the photo like he’s scared it’s going to be snatched away if he’s not careful enough.
did you find this place?” Tony had said by accident, which was true. Kind of. All he had done was hit the road and driven until he’d found himself in the middle of nowhere. Alright, he didn't bother with the fact that he had been hyperventilating during the whole ride but that was just trivial stuff that Steve didn’t have to know about.
That didn’t mean that his heart ached any less when thinking about it.
Rogers looked like he didn’t care that they were standing in what could easily be described as paradise. His stern expression would lead everyone to believe that he was being held captive in the desert.
Tiptoeing to various cupboards proved to be just as useless. There was nothing eatable around, not even some damn
With a sigh, Steve opened the door and stepped inside. The room was just as big as his own bedroom, if not even bigger. It featured the bare minimum - a bed, closet and desk. The walls were depressingly blank, the only warmth belonging to the sun rays that seeped through the large window.
Great. It was the middle of the night and from the looks of it, Tony wouldn’t fall asleep anytime soon. Once he was awake, it was almost impossible to close his eyes again. That - and he was really hungry.
“Can’t remember that I asked you to listen.” He was too baffled to react and by the time he caught himself, Tony had already jumped into the driver’s seat. Steve had no clue where the sunglasses the younger man wore had come from but they did their job perfectly, hiding his eyes and everything they could have told him.
For some reason, Tony hesitated. He should have been ecstatic at the opportunity to get out of there for as long as possible and have some time for himself. Hell, if hit the gas pedal hard enough, he’d even be able to spend a few hours with Rhodey. It was what he had wanted from the moment Howard had told him about this whole arrangement.
“It’s alright.”
“That’s not the reason I’m doing this though. I rarely care about what the old man says.” There was a sharp reply on the tip of his tongue that Steve had difficulties to swallow down. “I think you can use a little break from me.”
Yeah, he wasn’t about to add
look like a prison. I wasn’t wrong.” Steve shifted from one foot to another, suddenly embarrassed by the overall lack of… everything.
surprise him was that Steve apparently had a sense of humour. It was small and well-hidden but it was there. It pleased him to no end.
“I explained to him that it wasn’t your fault,” Steve said, forcing what he hoped to be a pleasant smile on his face. He didn’t want to show how much Howard’s words had bothered him. It would only make Tony think that Steve was trying to give him pity.
He stumbled forward, trying to keep his balance with little success. A loud whine left him as he spiralled towards the ground at a rapid pace, already preparing himself for a broken nose. The arms that wrapped itself around his waist and chest saved him just in time. How on earth Steve managed to close the distance between them that quickly was a mystery to him - must have been that super soldier serum taking charge.
He turned, sheets slipping further down his body. His eyes caught the time displayed by the clock on the bedside table.
Steve knew that he was about to drive off and quickly put a hand on the driver’s side door. “Will you be okay?” He wasn’t about to let him leave, not if he didn’t get a satisfying answer first. Hell, even with that, Tony could still be lying - the younger man seemed to do that a lot - but at least Steve would feel a little better.
Steve wanted to argue, he truly did. He wanted to say that the assumption was nonsense and he was fine with continuing their technology lessons because god knew that he could use a couple more of those.
and there is nothing around here to satisfy this need. Either we go out to eat or we go shopping - your choice.” With that, Tony plopped down on the couch, a good distance away from Steve as the man contemplated on what to do.
it seeping out of you!”
The sun had reached its highest point when Tony finally couldn’t take it anymore. “Listen, I need something to eat or I’m going to get really uncomfortable to live with.”
What the fuck?
“Please.”
Tony turned after failing to receive an answer. Rogers stood a good distance away from him, eyes trained on the spot where the water was still stirring because of the rock’s assault. Come to think about it, maybe giving him a house right next to this big pond of water hadn’t been the smartest idea.
, I mostly mean my ass.”
Painfully silent seconds passed until the tense figure finally spoke up, sounding more confused than angry. “Tony.” The urge to turn around and flee the scenery became stronger by the second. Tony tapped his foot against the ground, fighting against the rising nervousness inside his body.
He picked up a small branch from the ground, throwing it in Roger’s general direction. “Hey! Tony to Steve. Come in, please.” The guy blinked a couple of times before his piercing blue eyes snapped to Tony. From the look on his face, it wasn’t hard to guess that he hadn’t paid attention to anything that had been said.
Steve. Nothing,” he threw back, one eyebrow raised in disbelief. “Because you have nothing lying around here to eat. You must be starving.”
from him, neither good nor bad news. Which meant that the younger man was in no danger right now.
But Steve hadn’t said no. Too confused about everything that had been happening to him in that moment, and far too grateful for Howard and everything the man had done for him up until this point, Steve hadn’t said what had truly been on his mind.
“Not really.” Steve really needed to tone it down with that flush on his face, otherwise Tony would start making lewd comments very soon. The red on his cheeks was just too much of a good look to not be pointed out. “I don’t see much fun in carrying you back to the car and being forced to drive that monstrosity home.
Steve hesitates, watching him in uncertainty. “Tony, you don’t have to-”
The happiness captured in the photo fascinates Tony, his fingers tracing along its edges as he continues to stare. Even his scarred and hardened fingertips, roughened by years of soldering and crafting, can make out the various crinkles and dogears. It almost looks like it has been carried around in a pocket for years before reaching its final destination between the books and old wood - or like it has been crumpled up in the past.
It’s not funny; not in the slightest but Steve still laughs. The sound is as devoid of actual delight as his own was but Tony still counts it as a win. It’s the lives they have chosen to lead, being in constant danger, scared what the next day might bring them, never able to catch a real break.
But it was manageable. The sight he got when his eyes blinked open was worth every single drop of sweat. Steve’s eyes were closed as well, head slightly tilted up as the man enjoyed the fresh air. Tony had been badgering him for days, begging him to come out with him again.
“Yes, he just left.” He tapped his foot against the wooden floor a couple of times. “I think he took your words to heart.” Tony would probably kick him if he had heard Steve say those words to his father but he didn’t know what else to do. Honestly seemed as good of an idea as anything.
“The only reason you’re able to say that right now is because there wasn’t a car on the other side of the roadway when you swerved into it moments ago.” Tony stared, mesmerized by the way Steve’s lips twitched after his comment. He still wasn’t looking at him but he had turned his body so he was at least facing the road in front of them again.
And the fact that his son resented him for it was a small price to pay.
After all, didn’t the younger man have almost everything you could wish for? Enough money to last a lifetime, a certified genius with an intellect that few could challenge
“So, what do you wanna start with?” Tony asked as he threw the stone he’d picked up as far as he could, watching it hit the surface of the water, disrupting the peaceful stream and creating angry waves.
Having being forced to learn everything about the hero Captain America, Tony knew that the guy had been fairly poor before he’d gotten pumped up on steroids. This was probably his desperate attempt to stay a bit longer in 1945… and people had the nerve to say Tony had bad coping mechanisms.
… but that is a possibility you always have to consider and I tend to set stuff on fire even if I don’t wanna. That’s on me.
He did his best to ignore the shiver that ran down his spine.
“Your father is one of my oldest friends,” he carefully began explaining, just to be interrupted by Tony’s loud and dry laugh before he the chance to say anything else arose. Okay, this had been a mistake.
“Well, I’ll be
Tony watched the man quietly, a small smile on his face. Steve was so content, looking like that. The frown that usually rented out his face was gone, replaced by a slight upward curl of lips. Steve was pretty when he looked like someone had just insulted him and his entire family - but he was beautiful when smiling and happy. Okay, not happy but something
Engineer hands, he realised after a moment. The image of Tony locked up in his workshop, tinkering away like Steve had seen his father do many times during the war came to his mind, made him smile. Steve got snapped out of his trance when the hand on top of the desk was pulled back abruptly.
“I know who she is.” Steve’s surprised look when he lifts his face makes Tony smile. “I’ve met Peggy numerous times when I was younger. Dad and she seemed to be good friends. We talked a lot when she visited. She was nice and encouraging where my father wasn’t.” He sits down next to Steve, head turned so he doesn’t lose the hold he currently has on the man’s gaze.
“Come on, we must have an old, unused frame lying around here somewhere. The photo is too nice to go to waste in its current spot.”
good sight - but not enough to distract Tony from the concerning topic at hand.
All the effort for nothing.
“What are you doing up?” His attention snapped back to Rogers. His voice had found some of its intonations again, making him sound more like a human being and less like a robot. It shouldn’t matter - but Tony relaxed a little upon noticing.
Steve heard the front door open and slam shut a moment later. Torn between going after Tony and clearing up whatever was going on with Howard, he decided for the latter. It would probably be easier to get Tony back inside if he could tell him that his father was no longer angry.
The young man nodded as he approached the desk, fingers sliding over the wooden surface. Steve’s eyes flicked down to follow the movement. Tony’s hand looked rougher than he would have expected of a 22-year-old. Even from where he was standing, Steve could make out distinct cuts and scars that ran over the back of it and around his fingers.
But when Howard had come to him with the idea, Steve had done nothing but smile, nod and say ‘thank you’. It was the least he could do and surely, the man knew better than Steve did, right? If he was being honest, he blamed the damn Captain America persona he had been forced to adopt ever since his transformation.
“I’m not tired,” came Steve’s quiet answer. They were in the same room but the guy’s voice sounded like he was miles away. Tony hummed in response, grateful when Steve began speaking again. “I’m not even a fan of this kind of music. It’s just too quiet here.”
A muscle in his jaw twitched. It was best not to think about that.
“Actually, he was well within it.” He had noticed that and was still thankful for Tony ignoring his desire to trying to breach Mach 1 in order to assure that Steve was feeling comfortable - or as close to comfortable as possible after their earlier conversation. “Like I said, either we both are to blame or no one is. These things, they happen.”
Tony walked into Steve’s home, allowing him to push the door shut again and keep the cold wind from entering as well. In the past, he hadn’t minded the cold but ever since he’d been saved from the ice, Steve preferred to be as warm as possible. It was something he should probably talk about and something he most definitely wouldn’t.
“Tony?”
“No, it’s the rule. No uniform, no permission to enter class”, the guy stated.
“Yeah, that doesn’t sound so hard. Easy peasy”
Ahh, watching him sleep so soundly like this makes me want to doze off too. He thought as he also leaned his head on top of Tony’s.
“Stupid Steve. I bet he noticed I was still wearing his coat. Why couldn’t he just tell me? God…this is so embarrassing”, he said to himself.
“But hurry. If this keeps up Ironman will soon lose all his memories and even feelings he had acquired during the time”, Strange added.
“Nothing? Seems like you were trying to hide from me though”, giving him a smile.
“You read my mind, Rhodey bear”, Tony replied, smiling brightly until, “Wait…I feel like I’m forgetting something…”
“Sorry, I couldn’t help it”, Steve told him trying hard to laugh remembering the incident.
Memories of the past flashed across his eyes. About the Afghanistan incident, him being Iron man, meeting Steve, joining the avengers and most importantly, falling in love with Steve Rogers. Suddenly the pain subsided and he was now face to face with a worried looking Steve grabbing him by the shoulders, who kept asking if he was okay?... What just happened?
Steve was about to talk to Tony again when his phone rang. Picking it up he let out a few ‘yes’ and put it away in his pocket. “Seems like I’m needed in the club room. Have a good day”, saying that he ran off in a hurry. Gazing at the retreating back of Steve Tony suddenly shouted startling his friend.
“Yep. Can I ask if you could give me directions for where the special classes are held?”
“But it’s really cold now and dark. The bus would take a while to reach and I don’t want you to catch a cold waiting for it in the night”
Oops….
“I’m sorry if it bothered you, Miss Wanda”, he told her and seeing as Tony was handling things just fine he put his attention on his own customers.
“No, it’s not like that”, he tried to explain but Tony wasn’t hearing any of it.
“Oooo~ Nice”, Tony said giving him a once over. “Now try running over there to the fountain and sprint back here, test it out”
“Why don’t you and Bucky make up again already? This time it wasn’t really his fault you know”
“Um..Tony?”
Peggy had caught her boyfriend being all cozy with one of the football cheerleaders recently so they were having a fight.
“Yeah, but its fine. Why did you call me?”
“Why are you so proud of that? He dumped you”, Tony stated narrowing his eyes at her. But she simply replied that it felt like she had hit the jackpot when it happened.
“Good morning, Tony”, Steve greeted, smiling brightly at the brunette who just gaped at him surprised.
“Come to practice with me and Rhodey. He said there will be a match with a nearby school”
The reason Steve’s popularity doesn’t drop even when he put an abrupt end to every relationship is because he would sincerely do everything his partner wants in that one week they went out.
Tony had just finished selling an important piece of information to one of the mafia boss in Brooklyn. He smiled as he looked at the transaction of 10 million dollars to his account.
“Stop joking around, Peggy. You’re drunk. You’re not in the right mi-..”, he was cut off with her pressing her red plum lips to his. He quickly shoves her off him.
“Yep, got it in first guess. I’m a scholarship student joining today. Just heading to find the damn locker area before I get to class”
“Steve…I’m sorry I left my wallet in the locker. I’ll pay you back later”, Tony told him as they went inside the school building.
“The girls enjoy it so I guess it isn’t so bad”
Tony went inside their apartment and quickly flopped down on the couch. His time at SHIELD really took a toll on him. He took out his phone and saw that there were two messages from Rhodey asking how it went and a miss call from Pepper. Tony rubbed his tired eyes and dial Pepper’s number.
These girls, most of them are pampered and sheltered girls who knows nothing about the real world. In comparison with the other co-ed school, these girls sure have unusual impressions regarding guys.
“Yeah, I am”, he replied looking away, staring out the window. He does not want to continue this particular line of conversation.
When the goal went in again Tony cheered enthusiastically, jumping around in pure joy. Rhodey had gone over to his seat as Tony jumped over the border to hug the guy and slapping on his back in a proud manner.
“Don’t you have anywhere else to be other than annoying me?”, he retorted with a pout.
He saw a tall blonde guy getting out of the passenger’s seat, saying something to a woman. On further inspection he realized it was none other than Steve Rogers.
“Why are you wearing that jumper under your coat? Won’t you get scolded?”
“Standard? ….There is no standard”. Because this isn’t a game.
The pictures on the screen kept changing but I’ve already forgotten what the movie was about.
“The righteous captain is getting angsty”, the dark haired prince said with a smirk. “Alright, fine. I don’t feel like fighting today. Stark, come over here. Out of the armor would be preferable”
“New comrades? Would the lot of you want to be shown around the place? It would be my pleasure to do so”, Thor offered with a huge smile. Before Bruce and Tony could decline the offer, they were being shoved along by Thor and his super strength. For guys like Tony and Bruce, they hardly could put up any noticeable resistance. Might as well went along then.
“What do you want me to do?”
Just as he was occupied in his thought Tony came out from the bathroom wearing a clean shirt and wiping his wet hair with a towel. “Man, that was refreshing”.
Tony who was just a few feet away from them might have heard it too. He shouted at the two players.
Oh no, my wallet is in the locker room!
“Ha ha, very funny. Can’t you just forget the gate incident already?”
Posted on 19/12/18
“He better not try anything though”, he thought to himself as he felt Stark burying his face in the curve of his neck. He was acting just like a cat. Steve was tired after a long day of work. He needed his sleep. Therefore, he’d like to avoid a fight to the dead with Tony Stark for tonight at least.
“Like hell I can wait”
”So this is instant coffee. It looks tasty. Let’s all have some”, Steve said taking a cup. The others looked hesitant though.
“It’s fine, Pres. I’m fine. Stop mother-henning me”, Tony replied brushing off the concerned blonde. He worries too much.
___________________________________________
He then saw the red haired girl, Natasha sitting on a chair near a bar, tending to her knife. Thor and Clint were playing a game, hitting away at the controls and one guy sleeping on the couch, his face covered by a pillow. This room seems like it’s filled with all the people he didn’t want to meet.
“Wow….this looks good, Tony. Would you go and make us some? I’d like to try them”, Steve asked with a smile. Grumbling under his breath about ‘stupid rich bastards’ he took the instant coffee and starts to prepare a hot batch for Steve and the girls.
“Steve? Stark just tried to attack me. Please help me”, she began but Steve cut her off.
After that was the gym area filled with all sorts of work out equipments ever made. Before Thor made them lift some weights the two friends vehemently insisted that they didn’t want to try them out. Next was the swimming pool area. They went inside the building and found themselves looking around the Olympic size pool where Thor had insisted Tony to take a test dive. Which Tony firmly declined, even grabbing on a pole tightly when the guy tried to drop him into the pool instead.
“…The football club?”
“Hmm?”, Tony asked with a mouthful of food, glancing at Steve.
Tony felt like a deadly aura was coming from Pepper, “No way….Agreeing to it so lightly!”, she yelled at him.
“Yeah, that’s correct”, Tony replied after taking a sip of his coffee.
“Did I do something wrong?....”, Steve said staring at the brunette’s back.
“Let’s go”, Tony simply said as he just stood up and hopped down when the bus came to a stop.
I didn’t think the seniors knew. Steve thought looking at the brunette who seems like he was deep in thought.
What he heard made Steve froze in his place. Past five years memories? Shaking his head Steve spoke up remembering the incident with Loki. “I think it might be a month ago when Loki came to attack earth with his beast. Tony got hit with a blast from him. But when we checked he didn’t have any injuries from that so we thought the suit protected him”
If Peggy was drinking that means she hasn’t made up with Bucky yet. She’s always like this. Geez, these two. It’s almost a week now.
“Tony, wait”, Steve said grabbing Tony by the arm. He leaned down to his face, making Tony blush at the action. Wait, what the hell is Steve doing? He thought in a panic. Steve brought his other hand up to brush his fingers near Tony’s lips. “You had a piece of jam near your mouth”, he said showing it to Tony and proceeded to lick it off making Tony blush even harder.
“I see. Then how about it?”
“Should I stop then?”, he stares down at him. “You also don’t want me to put this in either, right?”, he smirked as he rubbed the tip of his cock to Tony’s ball, brushing pass his hole and making it twitch in anticipation.
“I’m afraid I can’t help you. Only the spell caster is able to break it”, the magician replied.
“Get use to that, Stark. Steve is the club’s mother hen and you’ll be getting a lot of that from now on”, Natasha teased in a calm tone.
“I didn’t mean it that way. Don’t get angry. I was hoping we could exchange numbers”, Steve explained. Oh.
That put a smile on the blonde’s face. Giving a grateful smile in Tony’s direction before running back into the game. Though his senior didn’t notice it as he was still busy scolding the guys and even attempting to give them a few punches. Too bad they ran off to the fields before he could.
“Hmm…I guess that’s true”, Tony admitted. Bruce had told him that he didn’t mind spending his free time here. He even added that he was kind of enjoying seeing Tony with the other hosts. Tony felt like Bruce was just having fun at his expense but having him here was kind of calming.
It was a good thing he guessed. Since most of the girls had already gone home. It was nice to not be surrounded by girls for a change. Felt relaxing.
He had already told his other best friend, Bucky about his attempt at trying to confess to her today. It seemed like Bucky was happy for him too. Even wishing him good luck and teasing him about how he already knew he liked the girl. That it was plain obvious, making the blonde blush red.
The guy gave a tsk and started to pay attention to the teachers again. “Don’t worry, Barnes is not a bad guy”, a small voice said. He turned to his left and saw a guy around his height with wavy brown hair and rounded glasses, a small smile on his lips. “Nice to meet you, I’m Bruce Banner. Just call me Bruce”
Somehow, it feels like someone has said that to me before. Although it was in a completely different situation from today’s. I’ve never really had an interest in Steve Rogers but right now I find myself wondering what kind of person he is.
Realizing what he just did Steve quickly let go of Tony, rubbing the back of his neck in a shy manner. “I…didn’t know what came over me. I’m sorry for doing that”
“Are you sure about that? I think you’d regret it”
“Are you Tony Stark?”, the guy asked with a smile, carrying a box of pizza.
He felt like it was going to be a while. But then. “Seriously, Rogers. Don’t answer with your lower region” he retorted to which Steve said “Isn’t this your fault?”.
That ticked him off. Isn’t he the one who has one? Some girl probably confessed to him by now. “No but aren’t you the one who got something on right now?”
The game starts again and after 15 minutes into the game Rhodey got the ball and quickly passed it over to Steve who strategically took it without any effort and aimed straight for the goal as he kicked it. Right into the goal.
“I was certain he’d punch the shit out of me”
“Tony, are you hungry? Do you want some food?”, Maria asked opening Tony’s room but on seeing her son already deep in slumber she quietly closed the door and got ready for her next shift.
He gave him a nervous smile.”Just someone who dumped me once before”
“Don’t laugh while you’re apologizing. That’s just rude. Waking me up at this ungodly hour and I can’t get back to sleep. What now? Make it up to me, Rogers”
He reached out for it and brought it to his face. It was still a bit warm, Steve’s scent lingering on it. Tony felt himself being wrapped up in his warmth. It felt really good. He felt safe, protected from anything that would hurt him. Tony didn’t remember but he had drifted off to sleep clutching Steve’s blazer tightly to his chest.
“Just your shirt…And what are you doing clenching my sock?”, Tony asked as he pointed at it with a blank expression.
“Yeah….I’m fine, um…”
Tony looked up to find Barnes looking down at him. “It’s being handled as best as I can, Barnes. Anyway, why is a school like SHIELD having a host club anyway?”
They were interrupted by a girl calling over for Steve, telling him that he was wanted by the teachers. Thanking her he followed her back. He took a few steps forward, then looking back at Tony he smiled, “I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then”
On seeing the shock state of his lover Steve took Tony’s hand and guided him to the sofa and sat besides him, rubbing his thumb on top of his hand in circles. Trying to comfort him.
This chapter is dedicated to the lovely kurumi_ayokashi1914. Hope you enjoy~
“Oh, a customer?”, Clint piped up, pausing the game.
“Eh? You do?”. Steve was surprised to hear that. He thought only Tony knew him from the club, oh and Thor. When did he got to know the others?
“So, your father was a drunk who left you and your mom to fend for yourself. Who does the chores around the house? Your mom would be awfully busy”
“Please, call me Clint. Catch ya later, Natasha probably near the vicinity now. BYE~”
“Geez, what I meant was. Um, isn’t there a type of face or body that you like?”
“The fuck you staring at punk?”, metal hand said glaring daggers at him.
“Are you alright, Tony? Are you feeling any pain? Do I need to call the doctors?”, he asked him, reaching out to hold his hand. Steve felt a pang in his heart when Tony flinched at the contact.
“Which club do you belong to? Go ahead, answer me”
“Huh?!”
“Y-you didn’t leave?”, he stuttered a bit, “I mean…what are you wearing?”
“Good night then. See you tomorrow”
Tony went to the destination the note had said and was surprised to find the girl he remembered being quite rude to him before. “Why did you call me?”, he questioned.
We’re gonna start this love story of ours all over again and I don't mind it one bit
“You want to die, Stark?”, Bucky clenched his hand into a fist, ready for a fight.
“Hmm, Rogers is so warm”, he said to himself as he hugged Steve from behind, nuzzling his head into the fluff of blond hair. Tony felt that Rogers’ hair was quite fluffy to touch. He wondered if this was what a beast’s fur felt like since Rogers really was a kind of beast.
“You don’t need to bother with me. Seriously, I’m doing great. Already ditching classes on the first day thanks to your friend”
Thor came back the next day, bringing good news as he told the rest of the Avengers about Loki’s location on midgard. The team suit up, ready for a fight. Tony also got into his suit and they took off on the quinjet.
“Ah, Tony, are you alright?”, Bruce asked concerned.
It was a picture of Peggy Carter, one of his best friends and love interest for the longest time. He was smiling to himself. He had planned to finish the drawing and gave it to her as a present for the special birthday party he and Bucky had organized for her.
“I won’t be if I wasn’t detained by the weird students of this place”, he muttered as he made his way to an empty seat between a guy with glasses and a grumpy looking one. He glance to his seatmate and saw that his right hand was made of prosthetic one though he wasn’t sure if its just the hand or the whole arm as it was hidden under the uniform.
Tony laughed a little, “Aww, you’re no fun”
We are happy to give you a scholarship for your astounding works and performance in the field of robotics engineering. All your study materials and lab equipment will be provided for by the school. Therefore we would like you to continue your education here at SHIELD Academy. You can join us whenever you’re ready.
“I can’t do it. Steve, you’re the best thing that ever happened to me.  I can’t lose you. I don’t want to lose you. Please…don’t let me do this. I can’t live without you…please”, he said in between sobs.
“Oh…”, Tony breathe out, he looked over at Bucky and pointed at him,” Even him?”, asking in a disbelieving voice. An angry vein popped up in Bucky’s head while Steve just let out an amused laugh. “You got a problem with me, punk?”
“Rogers!”, Tony called out for the blonde who was walking ahead of him with the rest of the gang. But he didn’t seem to hear him.
“Heh~ Something happened between the two of you yesterday”, a devilish smirk spread out on his lips sending shivers down their spines.
“Thanks. You new?”, she said finally letting him go.
“What did you expect, Mr. Athlete? We’re nerds. Our field of expertise is not sports”, Tony said catching up his breath, wiping the sweat off his brows.
Being apart of the Avengers is not so bad after all.
“Since we are all going to be in the same club. Why don’t we introduce ourselves? “, Steve suggested.
Steve nodded and did as he was told. One of the workers at the shop, thinking he was trying to run away without paying for it ran after him as fast as he could, worried and horrified . The look on the worker’s face was priceless when Steve simply ran back again into the shop.
Tony shouted in annoyance, he just wants to fucking leave the damn room. Can’t this people understand a simple ‘no’. The commotion they created got the attention of a certain blonde who was working on his laptop. He went out to find two guys being dragged by Clint against their will, while the latter simply let out a laugh in pure joy seeing their reaction.
“Hmm… well…a handsome guy”, Rhodey replied as Pepper nodded.
“You’re one to talk”, his friends told him in unison.
“Don’t listen to him, Tony. I’m sure you will survive the rest of high school even if we are not there to help you. Maybe this is a good time for you to make new friends”, Pepper told him putting a hand on his shoulder.
“Sounds like our genius is having a lot of fun at his new school”, came Rhodey’s voice.
They soon reached a room with the ‘Vice Principal’ written in the display sign outside the door. “Here we are, the office of our vice, Mr. Coulson. Just introduced yourself and submit your invitation letter and he’ll sort you out with the details, okay?”, Steve said looking at the brunette.
“It’s instant coffee. You guys did say you needed more coffee”, Tony replied a bit confused.
“That would be great. Thanks. Lead the way then, big guy”, he said trying to keep a cool posture, shifting his gaze away from the blonde.
They want the guy of their dreams to be beyond perfect, which is obviously impossible for anyone. Sheesh. Real life isn’t fairy tales you read in a book.
“It’s her own fault for assuming. They’re always the one who confessed to me to begin with. But they get all disappointed when I’m not what they expect me to be”, he said as he twirl his pen again to avoid the idleness of his body. His hands were itching to work on a new idea that just popped up but he couldn’t until class was over.
“Yes, that is all”
“So, what are you doing here? Aren’t the seniors having class right now?”
“Oooo~ A fight between Barnes and the new errand boy? I wanna watch”, Clint chimed in as he and Natasha came into the class, followed by a meek looking Bruce who was smiling nervously as Thor boomed in disagreeing Clint’s claim saying comrades shouldn’t fight each other, putting a strong grip on Bruce’s shoulder.
“Oh? That time? I don’t really remember it but I guess it might have happened by mistake. I would not have done it on purpose as I have no reason to cast such spells on Stark”
“Same school as me. 2 years older”
Sorry for late update, got busy watching Earths Mightiest Heroes he he.
“Of course I will. Thank you, my lady”, the blonde replied with a smile, leaving her swooning at him, telling him how dreamy he was.
“Absolutely nothing. Please continue to ignore me”, Tony quickly stated looking away.
“Alright, I’ll do it!”, he agreed thinking he would be able to pay of the debt and quit the club sooner as Steve let out a tired sigh looking over at his friends. He wonders if this was a good idea.
“What is it? You don’t have to go to the Engineering club anymore right? You said you already finished the assigned projects for the rest of the year and more”
“Yeah”, he replied, “This one’s Clint. He almost landed on top of me”, pointing to him, “This one’s Natasha. She had a knife on my throat. That one is Thor. He tried to throw me into the pool. And lastly Barnes. He gives off the feeling of wanting to bite my head off and I kinda dropped my lunch on him. So yeah, hard to forget them with those kinds of first encounters”
“I’m not trying to do that, Tony. Have you got a cell phone?”
“It’s pretty nice, huh? The food here is really good”,Bruce told him as they head over to the buffet table. “I bet. It would surely be alleast a 5 star one if it were a restaurant”, he agreed stuffing his plates with the delicious treats. After filling his plate to the brim he and Bruce went to sit on one of the empty tables. They ate in silence for the first five minutes after which Tony could no longer keep his curiosity under control and started to interrogate poor Bruce .
“You better keep your promise, Rogers”, Tony said with a warm smile as the light enveloped him.
“We will forget about this incident but only if you don’t ever come near Tony and you are officially banned from the host club”, Steve added with a serious voice.
He was walking around the hallway looking for the locker room when someone suddenly jumped down from the vents, almost hitting him, scaring the life out of him as he fell backwards. “Oh, hello there. Sorry about that”, the guy said dusting his clothes, “Need a hand?”, he asked looking at Tony who was still sitting on his ass.
Steve smiled to himself. “More like beautiful really”
“Told cha it wasn’t a good idea”, the guy said again and Tony could feel the guy smiling as he said it. He soon opened his eyes to meet with a pair of baby blues staring right back at him. Wow, those eyes sure look like they hold the secret to the universe or something. “Hi, I’m Steve Rogers. What are you doing here? Can I help you?”, he said, his earnestness clearly shown in his voice.
“….It’s….It was just me being clumsy”,
“I…um…do I know you?”, Tony asked tilting his head to the side.
“Huh? What was that? Speak up”. He ordered.
“Ah, sure thing”, Bruce returned the smile.
“I thought you already went home”, Tony started, when only the sound of rippling water was getting to him.
Amongst all the celebration Tony gazed over at Steve and gave him a triumph victory sign, a huge grin plastered on his lips. Steve couldn’t help but do the same. The brunette looked like he was really proud of him.
Pepper bent down to meet his eyes, poking her pen on his cheeks. “It’s because you do unrefined things like yawning out loud with a good looking face like yours that all the girls you’re with always dump you in a flash, you know”, she told him with a serious face.
I entered SHIELD academy through my engineering scholarship as dad stated he won’t pay for it unless it’s related to medical studies.
“I heard today that Steve had taken you home in his car, lending you his blazer and even hugged you this morning”, she said, glaring at him.
“What’s with you?”, saying that Tony grabbed his arm and haul him through the crowd and into a popular Shawarma place Rhodey had told him about.
The morning light starts to lit up his room as Steve rubbed his eyes and felt around the side next to him. It was empty. Stark wasn’t there anymore. Did he go home already?
Thor fished out Bruce from the water and handed him a clean towel to dry himself. Thinking it would be good to let the guy stand under the sun they went out. Their tour was brought to an abrupt halt with someone calling for Thor.
Steve had been awake all along and was feeling quite annoyed at Stark’s antics. He deliberated on what the damn bastard was doing coming at his place in the middle of the night and just getting into bed with him like it was a normal thing to do. How the hell did he find it anyway? But then again, the guy could get any info he wanted so he guessed it was easy.
“I’m afraid that won’t be happening, Miss Maximoff”, Steve said coming out to stand in between Tony and Wanda.
“Tell me, tell me, tell me”, Clint repeated again and again, shaking Tony who had his lips shut tight. “Tony just gave me back the blazer I lent”, Steve cut in hoping to stop Clint.
“Tony, was what you told the girls really true?”, Steve asked after Tony had escorted his guest out the door.
“Rogers? What are you doing here?... Oh my god, you’re one of them aren’t you?”, Tony said, eyes wide in shock, gaping at Steve.
“It’s about time you got conscious of things like that and do something about it”, she continued propping herself on a nearby desk looking down at her best friend.
“I’m disappointed in you, Miss Maximoff. And the reason Tony had to look for his stuffs in the water late into the night was because you threw it there”
Getting desperate one of their visiting team had intentionally knocked over Steve trying to steal the ball to which Steve was given a penalty kick by the referee.
It wasn’t even after 5 minutes into sleep that his phone rang again. He wondered what Peggy wanted this early in the morning.
“So what brother told me about common people not having the time to even ground their own coffee was true”, Thor added.
“Tony…..”
“Really?”
“Huh?”
“I’m glad there’s someone here who knows how awesome I am. On a totally different topic, what did you meant by Barnes being not a bad guy?”
Steve’s eyes widened in pure surprised at the question. Left him dumfounded. He was about to give a reply when the pizza delivery guy pulled up near the school.
“Tony Stark. I know. Good to see you Mr. Stark “, the almost balding guy who was sitting across the room said with a poker face. Tony cringed at the address. It made him remember someone he really wants to forget about. “With due respect sir but I’d prefer if you just call me Tony”, he said through gritted teeth. Coulson gave him a stare and then nodded in agreement. “Then, let me get you registered as a new student here. All your uniform and other essentials will be present in your locker and here is your I.D. Don’t ever lose this. You can’t access anywhere without this with you”, he continued handing him a card which looked like the one that tall blonde, Rogers used to access the gate.
I have no idea what will happen. I always feel somewhat hopeful at the beginning of each week. But I end up not feeling anything for the other person and we just split up and I repeat this again and again.
“The one and only~”, smirking at the comment.
“That was not at all what I was implying, Tony”, Bruce corrected.
“Let me think. Does that stupid person’s name happen to be a Clint Barton?”, he asked , seeing her nod he continue,” He went that way. A few minutes ago”
“Mr. Stark! Did you just sleep during my class?”, the teacher barked at him. Geez, he’s even more pissed today. Why am I always unlucky in his class? Tony thought with an annoyed sigh.
“So seeing me made you have a sudden interest in the grass, huh?”, Steve asked amused making Tony glare at him.
“Strange, can you help Tony? Remove the spell?”, Bruce asked expectantly.
Just as he was wondering whether the girl was Steve’s girlfriend of the week their eyes met for a second when the blonde glanced over. Steve then continued his conversation with the woman for a while longer. Waving a quick goodbye to her the woman drove away giving him a smile.
“I’m sorry”, Steve says, looking kind of down at the comment. Tony couldn’t take the sad puppy eyes he was being shown. Made him feel…kinda like he was bullying Steve. Argh! I bet that’s why girls forgive him so easily.
Tony finally joins the club (as a slave lol)
“Tony?”, he called out, earning the attention of the said genius. Tony looked over at Steve who came by to sit besides him. Tony didn’t say anything, simply stared at him.
“Exactly what kind of guy is he anyway?”, Tony asked.
“Those girls don’t like me as a person”, Tony said as he let out a loud long sleepy yawn after all those all- nighters he had been doing on his machines.
“I second that, I mean the first part but I’ll stand out in anything I wear. I’m fabulous that way”
Steve quickly ran over to Tony’s side. The rest of the avengers present by his side, all looking worried for their teammate. He crouched down, removing the faceplate. Tony wasn’t breathing. Steve suddenly couldn’t breathe either. Tony can’t be dead. He can’t.
“Hey! I’m not always late”, he scolded him making him laugh instead.
“Finally !! Someone who agrees with me. The uniforms are an overkill. I can’t express myself enough, my awesome individuality with having us wear the same clothes. Also it doesn’t stretch enough to ease my vent trips”, he said in a dramatic manner.
“Shut up…What are you saying…How the hell can I stop!”. With that he thrust his cock into Tony’s stretched out hole in one swift motion.
“Why do you keep doing this, Steve? You’ll just break up again in a week”, Peggy said.
“I don’t care. I’m not changing it. Expel me if you want”, the brunette reply.
“I wonder if he’s down with a fever”, another girl said.
“Don’t, Steve. Let the guy decide”
Eh? It’s okay?....It’s fine I’ll just ask one of the girls for which class he’s in. He told himself as he went to his class and enjoyed the pizza with his friends.
“Hmm, cute?”, she questioned to which Steve recalled the time he happened to catch Tony working on his machines through the crack in the door of the Engineering club late into the day. Everybody had already gone home. It was just a few football players staying back for a long practice. But seeing the senior who was well known for his pretty yet at the same time handsome face and for being a playboy busy with his invention rather than girls was a rare sight to him.
“Tony, stop laughing. Barnes looks like he wants to kill you”, Bruce warned while Clint urged him on. But Tony couldn’t stop it. Barnes pulled on his collar, yanking him to look up at him.
Tony sat down at his desk, totally out of breath. The shitty bastard, why did he have to go and do that? Couldn’t he just point it out instead? There was no need to get up close and personal to get rid of a jam. Bruce watched Tony as he slumped down onto his desk and grumbled to himself, giving off an angry aura.
“Cause it’s was the name of a superhero group I liked since my childhood”, Clint said putting an arm around Tony’s shoulder, surprising him.
“Nice to meet ya man. How are your views about our prestigious school so far?”, Clint asked spreading out his hands, gesturing the school.
“Are you sure?”
“That’s cause stuffs like falling in love….You never know when it’s gonna happen to you”, Tony said with a grin, silencing her. Pepper stared at him contemplating thoughts in her head when…
“Not just a host, my dear friends. Steve here is our club leader as well as the school’s president. The no. 1 host with 70% selection. The one and only Steve Rogers!”, Clint introduced him with a grand gesture.
“You really think so?”, he asked in confirmation.
“My fault?! What are you saying when you’re the one getting turned on?”
Damn, I got treated to lunch by a junior. Well, this is the first time I’ve had a proper conversation with Steve. And surprisingly he’s an even stranger person than I thought. All of a sudden he wants to walk home together and asking for my number.
“Tony, are you alright? She didn’t hurt you right?”, Steve asked getting down on one knee to check for any injuries.
“Tony!”, Steve shouted as he watched Tony being blasted across the building with Loki’s magic staff that had been deflected by Thor’s hammer. Ironman made no movement, no sound. He just laid there on the concrete floor motionless. A part of his face shown through the cracks of his faceplate. The captain throws his shield at Loki who had taken their distraction as a chance to escape with his beast, making him missed his target. The fight brought to an end.
“That’s not very nice, Tony; and the special classes of SHIELD are called special class for a reason. The ones in here are students gifted in certain fields. Age and sex doesn’t matter here”
Steve sat across Tony’s table, eyeing him from the corner of his sunglasses. Tony sitting on his usual seat with the sunlight shining down on his features. Damn, he was beautiful. He watched as the waiter brought Tony’s order at the table. The billionaire said his thank you with a smile and Steve was already feeling jealous of the waiter.
“I won’t call it that. His name is Tony. He’s an excellent student even if his background isn’t very good. He is an interesting person to be around”, Steve replied with a kind smile. The girl looked over at him with rather cold eyes completely unnoticed by Steve as he continued to talk about Tony fondly.
“Come pick me up, Steve. The girls want to see you. I want to see you”, she said sounding a bit…drunk?
“Ah! I remember!”
“Yes, it would be a marvelous idea to have Anthony as one of us”, Thor proclaimed.
“So, Steve, why were you crying you eyes out at the hospital anyway? You thought I was dying or something?”, Tony asked as he laid on the bed with Steve following him, doing the same.
“Are you joking with me?” he said to which Tony turned around with a puzzled look.
“Ahh, I see”, the guy replied gazing up at the birds that were singing on the nearby tree branch, with a warm smile.
Vice Principal,
“You weren’t?”. Well, that was embarrassing. And now he really wants to wipe that smug look off Bruce’s face.
“Shut up, Rogers. That was one time, one time”, he replied annoyed, folded his arm and faced away in an attempt to ignore and make him leave.
“Nothing”
“Wh…What are you doing here?”
Tony stood silently in his place. He couldn’t believe his memories were slowly being taken away from him. He doesn’t want to forget. Forget being Ironman; forget about the Avengers and….forget about Steve again…He doesn’t want Steve to suffer because of him. He loves him. Wanted to make him happy, not sad. Ever.
“Oh, right. Thanks man, I’ll try”
“Yes?”, the blonde asked titling his head to the side.
“Sorry about him”, Natasha said as she dragged a protesting Clint away from them, joining Thor and Bruce who had went ahead already.
Running over to the blonde he took out some money from his wallet and handed it to him. “Thanks for the help earlier”
It was Tony that suggested that they find a quite place to hangout without having to be bothered by other people. So, during their break they went around looking for one. They checked out a bunch of rooms but all seemed to be occupied.
“Let’s go see if there are any new styles. I’m in need of a new one”
Picking up the one of the broken piece Bucky asked Steve what they shall do. Steve looked over at Tony who seemed like he was almost in tears. His heart clenched a little at the sight. For some reason he didn’t like seeing Tony feeling so hopeless.
“Just looking for something. Please leave me alone”, he replied in a small voice as he continued feeling around the water for his wallet.
When Tony told his mother about his invitation she was so happy for him that she even cried. Hugging him and how proud she was to have such an amazing son. He wanted to do this for her too. Wanted to achieve great things, excel in his studies and get a good job. He wanted to support her back. She was always working to the bones for him every day. Not really having enough time to give proper care for her son, often getting drunk as well but his mom was all he had. He loved her anyway.
Tony sat in front of the school gate waiting for the pizza guy gazing up at the wide blue sky. His thoughts went back to Rhodey’s words.
Steve let out a grateful smile, holds Tony by the waist and hoisted him up to take him to the medics. Usually Tony would make a lot of excuse and fly off as soon as he could to avoid getting check ups. But this time he looked as if he didn’t know what was happening to him. He simply let Steve guide him to SHIELD’s medical team who took Tony from Cap’s arm and hoisted him onto one of the stretchers. SHIELD’s medic ensured him that they’d take good care of Iron Man and that there seemed to be no major injuries on him. That the hero was just feeling shock from the blast. Hearing that Steve finally gave them the okay as they closed the ambulance door and drove away.
Steve felt that Stark was not honest with himself. Why did he come here? Was it really just on a whim?
“Nope, never heard of it. I am kind of surprised to see that you’re still alive. Thought you were dead”, Tony said glazing over to Natasha polishing her knife and then at Clint.
So why don’t you go out with me, Steve?
“He doesn’t need your type of advice, Barton”, Natasha added ending with Clint yelling at her about how mean she was.
“More beautiful than I am?”, Peggy teased with a small giggle.
Say something. He pleaded in his mind.
“You okay, Tony? Here, come here and take a seat”, Bruce said leading him to the nearest table.
Tony dragged his ass to class. He undeniably did not want to see any members of the host club until club activity time.
“What’s this? You’re already so wet with just my fingers. What a lewd body”. Steve said to him as the hacker panted loudly under him biting on his hands as he tried to suppress his moans.
Tony blinked. Surely, Steve knew. It wasn’t that hard to guess - he had to know. Right? Suddenly, Tony was feeling a lot less sure about himself, his hands starting to fiddle with the grass beneath him. It was surprisingly cool, caressing his skin and grounding him. This wasn’t the time to become a coward just because it was Captain America he was making assumptions about instead of some random guy. “I mean - you’re queer, right?”
“You’re planning on making a fire in this room?”
Steve raised his eyebrows at Tony’s abrupt stop, choosing to remain silent as he waited for the man beside him to speak up again - but nothing happened. Tony shut his mouth so quickly that it actually made a sound and was stubbornly staring straight ahead, right over his car and into the treeline in the distance.
“Just me and all my great deeds,” he answered, coming to a halt in front of the door leading to the largest guestroom. “I told your father that it’s too big but he said that SHIELD insisted.” Whatever SHIELD was. All Steve knew, all that he’d been told so far, was that Peggy and Howard had confounded it shortly after he’d gone missing. Apparently, it was some sort of successor to the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
big of a part Peggy had played in founding the organisation but he wasn’t about to let her be erased completely.
“Alright.” He hands Steve the photo, letting go of it as soon as the other man’s fingers curl around one of the corners. The sinking feeling in the pit of Tony’s stomach only worsens when he watches Steve pull the picture close, observing it intently. “I haven’t done anything to it, Steve. I swear.”
“Hm.” Howard’s barely hidden distaste about his words was starting to annoy him a little. Was Tony that bad of a person back at home? Sure, he caused trouble but that didn’t classify him as an awful human being in Steve’s book and a father should have even more tolerance.
“Did you actually?” If Tony was smart, he’d let the whole thing slide and go back to the cleaning he’s done so little of - and usually, he
being forced. Dad threw a fit a few weeks ago when I blew up something in the workshop. Was totally on purpose, by the way. Had a shit day and needed to blow off some steam.” He shrugged in a manner that Steve would already describe as Tony-like, despite having known him for less than 5 minutes.
“You value that picture, don't you?"
“Yeah, that might be true and all but you still
And what he had was his car.
For now, however…
Steve wouldn’t have liked that but he could have dealt with it. What he couldn’t deal with, what he didn’t
...but they had been around each other constantly for the past couple of days and while Steve didn’t mind Tony’s presence, it was still unnerving him from time to time. Having a little time to himself didn’t sound too atrocious.
you are. I can build a fully functioning robotic arm that works via voice control but oh, Captain America managed to single-handedly save the world in 1945, Tony. What can your robot do for the world, huh?”
Lots of people were up during this time, Tony being no exception. More often than not, he would be out with Rhodey until the early hours of the morning, drinking, partying and not feeling the slightest bit of exhaustion. Sitting in your own living room and listening to the radio was nothing weird.
Thank you so much for the kind comments! They are very much appreciated.
“Tony!” Steve’s smile was gone, replaced by pure panic as he stared at the road. Tony’s eyes followed his gaze in search of what had broken the moment. He was once again in the wrong lane - only this time, he wasn’t alone.
“Do you even know if you have one in those colours?”
Another giveaway are the bright smiles on both of their faces, Steve's smile is full and unbothered with no dark lines concealed underneath it. He still smiles but not like that; never like that. His smile is a reflection of all the pain he has suffered through to get to this point in life, all the battles he fought, all the wounds he endured, all the losses he took. It doesn’t mean that it’s any less genuine but it’s different nonetheless.
Well, he couldn’t turn back time - and god, wouldn’t that be nice? - and the damage was done. The only thing he could do now was to try fixing the mess that he’d caused. Steve took a deep breath and put the phone up to his ear.
He didn’t expect to find the man in question hunched over the trunk of the passenger side of his car, hands grasping the top of the door as he put his entire weight onto the vehicle. From where he was standing, Steve could only see his back - but it was enough to tell how tense Tony was.
After all, the only reason he was here right now, running a track into the brand new wooden floor of his house, was because his old friend had never stopped looking for him; had never given up his mission on locating the super-soldier after he’d gone missing.
When Steve’s words finally echoed inside his head, Tony had to swallow, hard. He had expected that their conversation earlier would be ignored until Tony himself brought it up again. He did not expect Steve to comment on it - and not while they were still in the car.
Him being a good student and listener hadn’t surprised Tony - what
He made it a few more minutes before his stomach won the silent discussion. Tony got out of bed, hissing when his feet touched the cold floor. He hadn’t brought any slippers with him and putting on his normal shoes wouldn’t be worth the effort.
“Tony.” Steve sighed, pulling his hand out of the pockets of his jeans in favour of going to his hips. He was fine with Tony’s resentment, really - with all he’d been told, Steve completely understood. That didn’t change the fact that this conversation was beginning to tire him out. “Do you want me to call Howard or not?”
But Howard had insisted, had told Steve time and time again that there were too many security risks in a crowded area like that. Apparently, Hydra still wasn’t finished and there was nothing they would love more than to take revenge on the man who had stopped their plan 50 years ago.
He watched silently as Tony looked around the hallway, not missing a chance to peek into the living room. “Wow, this really
"You know what, man? Don't worry about it. Besides, the old man would be more upset about the car anyway. Can’t do that to him." Before Steve had the chance to reply to that, the car was moving. It whirled up sand and little rocks as Tony forced it forward, leaving the other man behind to stand in a cloud of dust, coughing as he watched the red vehicle disappear out of sight.
He had to fix this before things got out of control. It was only a matter of time until Captain America was needed again. Howard had implied as much on the phone a few days ago and Steve couldn’t say that he was surprised. There were always battles that needed to be fought, no matter how much he wanted that to not be the case.
“Give it here.” The fear on Steve's face gives away to desperation as he crosses the room as fast as possible without actually running, hand still outstretched and waiting. Coupled with the soft “please,” it’s enough to break Tony’s heart.
Tony didn’t bother with listening, the foot on the gas pedal continuing to kick down as hard as before.
After the little outburst at the lake, Tony had figured that, perhaps, he should start with something more vague; something that didn’t hit too close to home. The presidents had seemed like an agreeable topic. Thankfully, Steve had been happy enough with that option, listening intently throughout all of Tony’s explanations. The atmosphere had been tense at the beginning but gradually eased as time went on.
This place was truly beautiful. Steve just wished that they had given it to someone who appreciated it for what it was. He could have done with an apartment in Brooklyn, something small and unobtrusive.
There was no reply but Steve had said everything he needed to and patiently waited for Howard to respond. He only hoped that Tony was still pacing around the nearby garden or throwing a couple more rocks in the lake.
“Shit,” was the first thing he got out after his ability to breathe had returned. “Didn’t see that.”
awful. Honestly, Tony had it that much worse. They’d have to start from scratch, given the fact that Rogers had no clue about anything going on in this time - he’d barely been outside in the month he’d been unfrozen, hadn’t met with anyone besides his old man and a few doctors and refused to talk about his life before the hardcore icing.
“Big guy, wait up for me!” Tony called out, falling into a light jog in an attempt to make good on the headstart Steve had gotten on him. “Shorter legs and shit. I ain’t as fast as you.” The man stopped and turned, hands in pockets as he waited for Tony to catch up.
.” It was most certainly better than the first thing the young man had said moments ago. “You know, I’ve seen a lot of pictures of you, mostly in my father’s study ‘cause the man is a weirdo, but none of them managed to capture those gorgeous blue eyes of yours.” Tony looked like he meant every word of it, smirk as big as it could be. “Did you absorb the ocean into them during your time as Jack Frost?”
Tony loved blaming other people for all of his problems, yes and most of the time blaming his father was the right step to take - but not now. “It’s alright. We’re not that far away from the spot I wanted to show you. Come on, we can walk there.”
Steve's reply is sincere and warm - just like the man himself. "I do." It’s obvious and Tony doesn’t mind, not in the least. Now, if only the man sitting on the bed could see that as well. “It doesn’t mean I don’t love you, Tony. I do; so much. You have no idea.” Tony believes it all because there has never been a reason for him to not do so. Never. “The woman is-”
Tony’s eyes landed on the water. It had gone still again, leaving no indication that something had ever disrupted it. There was a lump in the back of his throat all of a sudden, impossible to swallow down as Tony stared.
Despite Steve being unable to see it, Tony rolled his eyes. He lifted his hand to show off the key dangling from his index finger. “Did you really expect me to leave my darling behind like that? That hurts, man.”
Perfect.
There was no reply to his little outburst and when Tony turned his head to glare at Steve, all the anger he’d felt up until that point vanished. The man wasn’t looking at him, choosing to instead watch the fields they were driving by. At the speed they were going, there was actually enough time to see something besides a blurry picture of green and yellow.
He waved Steve’s apology off, duffle back dropping to the floor in the process. “Forget it, man. Not like it’s your fault. I guess I just got unlucky.” The grin he shot Steve was all teeth, skin wrinkling around the corners of his brown eyes. “Because let’s face it, no matter what I’ll do with my life, I'm never gonna compare to you or what you’ve achieved.”
“Dude,” Tony jammed his keys into the keyhole and twisted, listening to the engine as it roared to life. The car shook slightly under its power. “You’re one lucky son of a bitch for having me with you. I’m gonna teach you a great deal.”
The rocks were lost to the deep blue underneath where no one would ever discover them again.
Perhaps he hadn’t messed everything up beyond repair.
"Steve, whatever,
and listening, he could read people as well as machines.
“You like it?” Tony asked with a smile. His darling was a chick magnet, though almost none of them actually recognized how great of a car it actually was. They only saw the flashy colour and opened up top and all went wild over it - and him, to a certain degree. “Doesn’t just have the looks but also the power to back them up.”
Tony waited for the other man to reach the car before jumping into his seat, watching Steve’s jaw clench at the action. He’d told Tony to stop doing that after he’d nearly broken his nose thanks to slipping on a patch of wet grass.
It wouldn’t be a lie. Sure, he’d keep out certain details regarding Tony’s own reluctance for the whole arrangement but he wouldn't exactly lie. Withholding information was an entirely different matter.
“Anyways, I was thinking that we might start with a little history lesson about what you’ve missed out on.” Truth was, they’d probably need more than one of those, taking into account all the shit that had gone down during Roger’s time as sleeping beauty. Tony figured they could start little and build themselves a solid base. “I brought a bunch of books with me, or we can check out one of the museums in the city if that’s more your style.”
Steve fucking Rogers, polite as ever, even in retreat. “Okay,” Tony whispered as he began to follow Steve back into the direction they had originally come from. His eyes were trained on the man’s back, not daring to stroll up to him to walk side by side. Steve clearly wanted some space and he’d grant him that.
His health. Tony had endangered Steve’s health - but his own as well. In fact, the younger man had been in a lot more danger while pulling the car back on the right side of the road. Howard didn’t mention that.
Steve was quiet for a moment before a soft ‘Hm’ filled the space between them. “I’m not familiar with this kind of silence. I’ve never lived so isolated before and during—” He broke off but Tony knew what he was referring to.
Howard didn’t seem to agree with him and was unrelenting as he continued speaking. “No, Captain Rogers. I won’t allow my son to hide from the responsibility. He needs to grow up and take accountability for the trouble he continues causing. Otherwise, he’ll never learn.” Steve opened his mouth but was denied the chance to reply. “You said that he was the one driving the car, that he steered it into the wrong lane and endangered your health. I won’t tolerate that.”
At least Steve wasn’t.
Angry about something that Steve had told him, despite knowing that the man could get quite protective when it came to his friends - maybe that hadn't been the best idea. Howard’s relationship with Tony was already tense enough as it was without him driving a knife into it.
“Tony,” he softly called out, making his presence known. A part of him was waiting for Tony to turn around and tell him to get lost - or a much more bad-mouthed version of that statement. The younger man didn’t do well with these kinds of confrontation, that much Steve already knew.
“You know,” A bump in the road made him groan, the sound almost painful. “Last time I was in an airplane it didn’t end that well for me!” If Steve didn’t stop clawing at the console like that, he was most definitely going to leave marks. “Please, slow the car down, Tony!”
Captain America was selfless. Captain America’s only interest was taking care of the people, not himself. Captain America did everything to ensure that those around him got what they wanted. Captain America was happy to house Tony Stark for the entirety of the summer. Of course, he was.
Steve turned his head away but the nervous tapping of his fingers against his knee gave everything away and Tony expected his following words before he actually uttered them into the warm afternoon air. “Can we take a break? Just for a moment or two? We’ve been driving for almost an hour and I’d really like to stretch my legs.”
“That’s not true,” Steve blurted out before his mind could come up with a proper response. “Howard told me that you’re highly intelligent and-”
Barefoot, Tony slipped out of his room and walked down the hallway, the wooden boards creaking softly under his weight. The sound was barely above a whisper but in the otherwise silent house, even the smallest noise carried itself through every corner.
smart when it comes to everything but this. People have always been his weakness ever since he was a kid. He’s never learned how to not say the wrong thing in the wrong time, despite everyone trying to teach him so throughout his entire life. It’s frustrating.
Because reputation was everything that mattered in the end. How he looked to the rest of the world. As long as all those people whose names he didn’t even know loved him, all was good.
“Right. Tony, I’m happy to have you around and help me. I really need it - but I don’t get the feeling that you’re all too thrilled to be here and I don’t want you to feel like you’re being forced to spend your time with me.” It was summer, after all, and Steve could imagine about a thousand things a person like Tony could do instead of being locked up with an unstable war veteran.
It was a little insulting, to be honest. Usually, he was the one doing the ignoring - it wasn’t nice to be on the receiving end.
Tony woke with a start, momentarily confused as to where he was. He shot up in a bed he didn’t know, unfamiliar sheets sliding against his naked upper body. There was pale moonlight shining into the room through a nearby window and honestly, it didn’t look like a place he’d been put into if this was a kidnapping.
No word had been uttered for the past 40 minutes - so, no one could blame Tony for flinching when the man beside him started speaking out of nowhere… and no one could blame him for flinching hard enough to steer the car into the opposite lane.
With a loud and overdramatic gasp, Tony pretended to be hurt. “Why, of course, my lord! I haven’t spent the last 2 hours going over every president that came after Roosevelt with you to be insulted like that!”
With tentative steps, Steve entered the room. Tony immediately caught the action, hazel brown eyes snapping to where he was standing. The fire Steve saw in there took him back. It wasn’t the one he’d grown used to, the soft and joking flame that always kept things interesting.
Until now, Tony had only paid attention to the fact that Steve had spoken up, not to the actual words he had said. His brain did a quick playback, trying to remember what exactly had been asked of him.
Steve Rogers appeared to be just as uninteresting as Tony had expected him to be but at the very least had no interest in money - or anything else, for that matter.
There was a loud huff on the other line. “Still, I am sure that if he hadn’t driven so recklessly, this wouldn’t have mattered. He must have broken the speed limit like he always does—”
“So, this is…?”
Thankfully, the entire road was as abandoned as it had been earlier.
But this wasn’t the way Tony wanted it to happen. Steve wasn’t supposed to give him permission to leave him alone - and certainly not when he hadn’t had a bite of anything in days. “Shouldn’t your super-soldier body be giving you an even harder time for not feeding it properly?”
Naturally, Tony continued doing it. Most of the time it was simply to annoy Steve and see him fighting the urge to smack the younger man across the back of his head. Now it wasn’t the intention of getting Steve flustered that made Tony jump over his car door though - but simply the wish to hear him speak
He didn’t expect the giant hazel brown eyes that awaited him. They were the first thing that caught his attention, practically pulling him in. It took Steve a moment to catch himself but when he did, Tony seemed to be just as caught off guard as he was.
Uh oh
Getting to the car the blonde was greeted by his driver who was telling him he was getting worried and almost searched for him when he took so long to return. Steve apologized for the trouble. The driver who Steve introduced as Jarvis looked at the boys interlinked hands with a thoughtful look. Feeling nervous Tony took out his hand reluctantly from Steve’s.
Steve hurriedly got down as well looking through the crowd of people to find Tony, calling out for him as he does. Finally he found him and reached out to grab his shoulder, turning him around to face him. He has to confirm this.
“Oh ho, now we won’t want that to happen would we. Fine, for you Stark I’ll make an exception. You better bring good results though”, saying that Fury sent him out. Tony had a smug look on when he returned to class without any punishment.
There weren’t a lot of passengers at the time. It was just an old lady knitting on the last row seat and a few middle aged men who passed out in the bus. They must have a tough day at work.
“If it isn’t the new kid, Tony, right? What brings you to our humble abode? Wait, don’t tell me. You’re here to set up a date with one of the host, right? Feel free to do so, the Avengers Host club at your service. We also take requests, care to make one?”,
“Ah huh,I’m gonna pretend that’s supposed to explain everything”, Tony deadpanned.
Steve eyed at him for a few seconds then took a bite of Shawarma. Tony had already finished his plate and was asking for seconds. He ate his next servings with the same delight. The two of them ate in silence. Until Steve broke it.
Even stranger I find it harder and harder to look away from him.
“Rogers, are you crying?”. Tony laughed at his shocked expression.
“I..um I was wondering if you’d want to go home with me in the car”
Steve always causes a stir with that good looking face of his. He thought as he looked at the guy leaning on the walls of the front gate.
“God, Steve, I love you too but I think that’s enough ‘I love you’ for today”, Tony told him putting a hand on Steve’s face with an amused smile. Steve simply brought their lips together again.
“That would be great ladies”, the brunette grinned brightly making them squeal.
Wanda suddenly reached out and grabbed Tony by his tie and pulling him down, landing on top of her. “What did you do that for? That hurts”, Tony winced trying to get up. He noticed a camera flashed from the side.
“I’ll give compliments to the chefs then. Glad you’re having fun though. Tell me if you have any problem. I’ll try my best to help out”, Steve offered.
“Oh that? Didn’t I tell you it was fine?”, Steve said as he took the money. But instead of accepting it he returned it by putting it inside one of Tony’s front pocket. Eh?
He just wishes Tony would wake up soon. So he could give him a kiss and tell him how much he missed him and loved him. That he would like to take him out on a date again. Until then, he’ll be here, by his side, until he wakes up.
They avengers were called out to confront Loki who was causing damage with the creature he had summoned with his magic. It was a dragon like beast. Gliding along the air and breathing out fire. Terrorizing the people.
He went down, took off his shoes and socks. Rolling up his pants he got into the fountain picking up his stuffs. He had found almost all his things except for his wallet. It was getting real late and the sky losing its light making it hard to continue the search. He had to hurry, if he didn’t find it home was a long way to walk on foot and he was tired.
“Yeah”, Steve answered pointing at Tony who was trying to get up from his sitting position.
“PEPPER! That place is crazy. There are people coming out from the vents, pointing knives at me, giving me dead glares for no reason and one of them even tried to throw me into a pool. Some of those people really wants to kill me. I don’t think it’s me not taking care of myself that’ll end up with me dead, it would be cause of SHIELD’s students”
I’m definitely a much more decent person than he is though. He concluded with a triumph grin.
“Sure, why not?”, came the immediate answer.
Built in a famous plot in the uptown district. It was originally an elite school for well bred young women until it became co-ed a few years ago. Ever since then it began taking in boys as well. But the ratio of boys to girls remains low with an overwhelming number of female students. The reason for this would probably be on the fact that the middle school sector is still an all-girls institution.
“Yeah, I do. Please make one for me everyday from now on”, the blonde replied making Tony blush who nodded shyly in his place.
The trio of friends were currently eating lunch together in their special area on the rooftop. “Alright, what’s got you in such a good mood today, Tones?”, Rhodey started ,eyeing at him as he packed up his now empty lunch box.
“Thanks for the concern but I already got dumped”, he admitted with a slight curve of a smile on his lips.
Recognizing the voice Tony turned around, squinting his eyes at Steve in annoyance. It doesn’t matter if the guy’s hot, he really gets on his nerves sometimes.
“I’m sure you will but before that go change into your uniform”, Coulson said typing away in his laptop.
“Splitting up with Bucky is no big deal”, she told him giving him another seductive smile.
But then he got to know him. The real Tony Stark, who underneath all his outside bravado gets hurt easily. His true self, hidden under a number of layers which takes ages to get through but Steve did it. Got to see Tony for who he is, learned more about him. And as he did, spent time with him, talked to him, fought along side him, he also fell in love.
“I…”, he started, “The spell took so long to be removed that it’s impossible to undo now. It can’t be done”, he told them, eyeing Steve in particular. Steve’s and Tony’s eyes widened in horror. This can’t be happening! He must be lying. He must be.
“No, I had some work I needed to finish today and I’m glad I didn’t” came the blonde’s sincere reply. After searching for a good fifteen minutes Steve felt something and grabbed it. He turned around and showed it to Tony. “Could this be yours?”
“You have a talent for football. It’s such a waste if you keep skipping it”, he scolded him, crossing his arms in front.
“Me? I like engineering, especially in robotics. I like tinkering and making new stuffs I guess”
“Geez, I guess this image is going to stick with me till I leave the Engineering club and join the medical line like my dad wants me to”, Tony said slouching on his desk. He seriously didn’t want to follow his father’s footsteps after high school but he feels like he doesn’t have a choice. He can’t keep on disobeying him like this.
“Geez!! I thought you were gone already, Rogers. You’re gonna give me a heart attack”
A vein pop up on Tony’s head, “You don’t need to tell me that. I can tell just by looking”, he grumbled. Realizing something he suddenly stood up surprising his friends.
Pouring hot water in the last cup and stirring the mix he brought it over in a tray, set it on a table and stood to the side. He felt pretty confident. Making coffee was a special skill of his. Who won’t be when one makes it atleast 5 times everyday? He eagerly watched them, wanting to see their reactions when a voice interrupted.
The blonde stared at him for a while surprised by the comment. “Hmm?...Not yet”
Gazing up at his best friend, “I’d be lucky if I got someone as realistic as you, Pepper dear”, he smiled.
“That’s it? I can start attending classes?”, he asked.
“Thank you for your patronage~!”, the delivery guy said as he rode away with a gloomy looking Tony in the background.
“Then how come you’re still sitting here?”
Next was the botanical garden filled with all sorts of exotic plants taken from different parts of the world. Tony made up his mind not to come again after one of the insectivorous plants bit him and another plant burst its pollen when he went near for a look. Making Bruce and Thor laugh the whole way to their next destination. Bruce was atleast trying to stop, too bad Thor wasn’t the same. Maybe firmly declining the offer was the better idea.
“Didn’t you know? Steve Rogers is the president of the Student Union at SHIELD. He’s the school leader. He’s a very capable person with good leadership quality. He’s a popular character at SHIELD. Everyone knows him”, Bruce explained.
Class was finally over for the day. “Tones, wanna drop by McDonalds on the way home? Coach said third years could get the day off”, Rhodey suggested as packed up their belongings.
“Oh really? Then do you wanna try going out with me?”, she asked, amused.
Tony did as he was told and stepped out of his Ironman armor to stand infront of Loki. Loki’s hands lit up a yellow glow and hovered it over the brunette’s forehead. After a minute he put his hands down, looking a bit worried.
Steve finally getting what Tony was saying gave him a smile. “You’re not very observant. Wrong on both accounts”, he told him.
“So, we decided to mix it up. This club does host club activities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while we use Tuesday and Thursday as a normal help club. I rather enjoy it”, Natasha said as she passed their table to get a drink from the bar.
Morning….
“Yeah me either”, Tony said absentmindedly as he continuously clicked up and down on his pen.
“That’s probably not a very good idea. You’d get injured like that”, it said.
“How should I put this?...”,she closed her eyes trying to get the right words out, ”It’s like there’s an air of charisma surrounding you when you do the things you enjoy”
The blonde rubs the back of his head in a flustered manner,“I’m so sorry about that. I just wanted to say welcome to SHIELD. I hope you have a good time here, Tony”
“Who, me? Not at all. I was examining your campus grass. I think you need to take better care of them. They seem to be drying up”
I just have to get 50 customers and the debt will be paid. I know just the story. He smiled making up a story about his life as the host club listened in from the sides.
___________________________________________
“If you say so”
“I see you are already pretty close with the SU president”
Tuesday: Steve realizes his senior is quite an interesting person once you get to know him.
He was able to make out words like he’s so cool, handsome and even cute. Why did they say cute though? I’m more of a manly type.
“Detention after school for you, Stark”, saying that the mean teacher continued the class leaving Tony in a grumpy mood for the rest of the day.
Seeing Tony cry his eyes out, Steve felt as if he’s being engulfed by a wave of sadness. He hates it, really hates to see Tony in this state. He wrapped his arms around the brunette as he continued crying on his shoulder. Tears staining his shirt, leaving behind a wet patch. But he didn’t mind, not a bit. He rubbed Tony’s back, thinking it’d help.
The guy let out a laugh and smirked at him. “Haven’t seen you around here. You’re new right? Otherwise I’m pretty sure I know everybody here”, he said, sizing him up.
“No..”, he told her firmly.
The couple went home with Happy dropping them off at the Tower. They were soon greeted by their team who seemed equally happy to get back their resident genius and friend. After spending a few hours watching movies with the team the couple went up to their shared room.
“Do you know how much we make from one customer? You’d be able to pay off your debt if you could get 50 customers”, Clint piped in.
“Oh…great. It seems like we all knew Tony already then”, Steve let out a nervous smile. So he just introduced Tony’s friend, Bruce to the others.
“There you are, Thor. Why didn’t you come to meet up? The chairman was asking for you,” Steve said jogging towards them, carrying some paperwork. Tony looked in the direction of the sound, realizing it was Steve he quickly dug behind Bruce for cover. He didn’t feel like meeting him again so soon.
Tony got off from the bus and walked in the direction of his new school, feeling a bit nervous. He soon found himself in front of a huge gate. He tried to open it but found it locked tight. He looked around, not knowing what to do. “Why isn’t there anyone to greet me anyway?”, he said to himself gazing up the sky as if a solution would just drop down. He waited for a good 15 minutes after which he started climbing the gate. If no one is coming to get him he’ll just get there himself. He doesn’t need a damn escort. He was about halfway there when a voice called out from below.
“I won’t give up, ever. Until I make you mine again. So what if you lose your memories, we’ll make new ones. Together. Prepare your future self for a persistent courting from Steve Rogers”, he told him earning a small laugh from the engineer.
“New friends? I don’t want to. No, more like I don’t need to. I’ve got you and Rhodey bear. You guys are all the friends I need”
He went over and sat on his bedside, silently watching the rise and fall of the brunette’s chest. The only indication that he was still alive. Steve misses him already. Miss how Tony would keep on talking his ass off. Never the one to keep quite. He used to hate that, no, not exactly hate. He had been annoyed at first. Of Tony, who never seems to have an off button. Always spouting a bunch of stuffs.
“Yeah, it’s the real deal, buddy. I got it this morning. Almost though it was a dream myself. Had to read it a few times to believe it was real”
I don’t know anything about him. And from the stoicism he possesses when he’s working on a machine, I would never have thought that he could be so interesting and mercurial.
He went over to Steve’s place and turned his door knob only to find that the guy hadn’t even locked his door. He went inside looking around for a familiar blond hair. But there was no sign of it. The guy was probably asleep then.
Walking over to the smaller brunette Steve greeted a ‘good morning’ to Tony who returned the gesture with a small smile.
“Yesterday”, the boy simply replied scribbling random formulas in his notebook. He expected Pepper to continue the conversation but she didn’t. There was only silence. He turned to her to see that she just gave him a look, a concerned one.
“Sorry, Teach, I was working on a really important project all night”, he spoke in an attempt to apologize.
“I knew I feel like I saw you somewhere before even if I don’t go out much. Saw you on TV a few weeks ago”
“Good morning, DUM-E”, Tony greeted his bot as he was packing up to make his way to his new school. DUM-E whirl happily in response making him smile. He mom sent him off with a kiss on the cheek and he boarded the bus.
“Yeah, sure”, Tony replied feeling a bit embarrass as well.
“What kind of person is it this time?”, she asked. Steve could hear her smiling on the other side of the call.
Tuesday late evening: Steve and Tony went on their first date after going out.
“Fine. If you say so”
It was nice to have the support of his childhood friend who knew him so well.
“Why call it Avengers Host club? It doesn’t make any sense”
Seeing the tip of a money bill sticking out from his pocket Tony realized something.
“I will”, came Steve’s unwavering answer, looking straight at him. Tony’s eyes closed and his body fell forward. Steve caught him halfway and carried his unconscious lover out the room.
“Well…”
“Tony, you…”, she started.
“I deeply apologize, Steven. I was enjoying showing our new comrades around the school. How can I be of service?”, Thor said looking a bit dejected.
Host club is now open for business~
Seeing that it was Tony he took it. “Hello?”, he started.
A habit like this. The ideal would be to send this to the same person every week. He pondered on whether to continue sleeping a few more minute or get up for school. But then his phone chimed a notification message.
“Is this the Stark residence?”, the guy asked with a friendly grin.
“Then, are you really fine with anyone as long as they confess to you?”, Tony asked, making eye contact. “Even if they are totally not your type?”, he added.
“The hell. Of course I have a cell phone. What do you take me for?”
Dang! Tony couldn’t believe his luck and the fact that he got a scholarship from the best school in the country. Even better news is that he’d be able to have newer and better equipment for his projects instead of simply using old parts since he couldn’t afford good ones. This would definitely help him build even better stuffs than before. Not saying what he made with whatever he got lying around isn’t awesome. He was able to do a pretty amazing job up till now. But with this chance he’ll be able to make the best of the best.
“It was Steve’s idea”, Bucky started as Tony let out a surprised choke. Steve didn’t seem like the type to do that. You really can’t judge a book by its cover after all. “Listen to the whole thing first, idiot. Steve…he wanted to make a group to give out help to people who needed it. But then Clint said he wanted to get girls as well so suggested we start a host club instead. Saying that it would bring smiles to the students here”
Peggy had told him that she and Bucky have been going out for over three months now. And how they weren’t ready to tell their best friend before because they knew exactly how Steve had felt about her.
“Who’s Peggy?”, he asked making Steve flinched.
Steve was busy gazing at Tony as he continued to chat and entertain the girls. He snapped out it when the girl besides him coughed to get his attention. “Did you forget about me?”, she asked.
Standing in front of his classroom he knocked on the door and found it sliding by itself, giving him entrance. “You must be Mr. Tony Stark. Welcome to the school. Take the seat near Barnes.  You’re late by the way”, the teacher, Maria Hill as was shown in the name tag said.
“I was single yesterday, so it was okay but now I’m not anymore. I’m not going to meet with you”, he replied with a small sigh.
WHY did they put a wall in the middle of the hallway?...No wait, this wall is kind of warm. He looked up to see a tall guy with long blonde hair, smiling down at him. “Are you alright, little guy?”, he asked. His voice loud and clear. It’s like he has a loud speaker stuck in his throat. Tony should totally be angry at the address but decide to keep his cool. The guy could easily beat him up with all those bulging muscles of his.
“Can’t I just wear casual for today?”, giving Coulson his best puppy eyes.
Hitting the ‘send’ button he put down his phone and then letting his face hit the pillow. He let out a yawn.
“Hey, Tony! Did you get everything on the list?”, Clint said coming over to meet him with a grin. Tony handed him the bags, Clint smiled as he rummage through the things and took out an instant coffee can. He tilted his head to the side, “What is this?”
