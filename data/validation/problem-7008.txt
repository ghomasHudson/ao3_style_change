“Ohh, last thing,” Tony said, and hopped over to a box to pull out the last decoration. Green branches and small red berries. “Mistletoe! And it should go right in the center of this doorway.”
But Steve couldn’t bring himself to close the gap between them either, so when Tony pulled away, Steve was disappointed.
“Steve, are you there? I was right, the anti-cloaking system, it’s the opposite of that, it’s what keeping them hidden. AIM hacked this somehow. I’m gonna disable it -”
Looking back now, Tony knew that moment was the small spark that ignited his love for Steve. He put the tickets in the scrapbook, along with a few snapshots he took from the boardwalk and pier that day, and turned his focus back to the box, reaching in to retrieve the next memento.
“You know, Tony, I used to chastise you because I thought you were too reliant on your tech, but I have to say, this is pretty satisfying, building the armor and tools you’re going to use to protect yourself in battle. This is pretty fun.”
“Yeah, they can manage without us. Worst case, we’re only going a couple hours’ drive away. If I need to call in emergency transport to get us back to the city it won’t be a huge deal.”
Steve also opened up the message. He felt a small jolt from his heart when he saw his name under Tony’s. But he quickly tried to lower his own expectations. He still couldn’t get a feel for why Tony was acting so strangely around him.
It hadn’t occurred to him until he was lying awake that night that he never finished asking Steve out.
“I know you go around to these fancy dinners and galas and have some of the best food in the world. I want to treat you like the special amazing man you are, right from the start.” Steve started to plate the food.
“Oh he’s always been like this, Sam. Even in the 40’s. Enjoys going to dances and never bothers to ask anyone to dance,” Bucky said. “What? Prove me wrong.” He said after seeing Steve frown.
Tony was waiting, already in the tub and staring off into the distance as Steve placed his robe and towel down and quickly climbed in.
“This is incredible. You’re incredible. Thank you so much.” Tony took one of Steve’s hands, kissed it and squeezed it and Steve’s eyes lit up.
“No seriously, Sam, it’s okay. I was planning on doing some training early tomorrow anyway. You guys have fun. I’ll see you back at the dorm.”
It was early April, and Tony had finally been cleared to resume regular classwork and screen time. He would still have to wait another week to be cleared to return for missions, but it was such a great feeling to start returning to normal.
“Hey, it’s okay. You’re safe now. You’re with me, and you’re safe.” Steve reached an arm around Tony, who was still shaking and pulled the man in close to his side. Tony curled in toward Steve, and Steve moved his hand reassuringly up and down Tony’s back. After awhile, when Tony’s breathing calmed down and returned to normal, Steve moved them both back onto the bed, pulling Tony into his arms and letting Tony lay on Steve’s chest.
Steve moved to the back and crawled underneath the tank, pulling his shield with him. He examined the underside of the tank as best he could.
Tony was silent for a moment. “You all mean so much to me, and when I thought I’d never see you all again - I - it just hurt so much. Being able to barely keep in touch over the communicator kept me focused, gave me hope. But it still hurt so much, it’s still hard to even talk about,” Tony said, his eyes welling up.
“Gotta get them out of here and back to the Tower. But how are -” Tony got cut off by the little red tsum jumping out of his hand and bouncing over to the restaurant area. It hopped up the chairs and to the table, where it immediately started to gobble up pizza.
would not be doing my job if I allowed a security system to make you all complacent at night. So, starting Sunday, you’ll each be assigned to a patrol rotation,” Fury continued to speak as a groan rolled over the crowd. “There’s enough of you where we can do this in pairs, and a couple of pairs a night, so you’ll only have to do patrol about once a month. Assignments will usually be two older students paired with two younger ones. No, I don’t care if you already had plans. You can resell those concert tickets. Your date can reschedule. If it’s your birthday that night we’ll leave you a cupcake. The patrol assignments can only be altered if they conflict with some other academic purpose.”
Steve was quiet as he slowly opened the scrapbook and looked through it, pausing to admire the tickets and the program and the napkin and all the other mementos Tony had managed to fit in the book. “Tony, this is incredible, how did you get this all together?”
Soon, a volley of snowballs and laughter was exchanged back and forth between the two. After they were both satisfied that the other was thoroughly soaked with snow, they put back the tire and went inside to change and warm up.
Tony felt his stomach flip as Steve continued to talk. Both of the younger students hesitated to respond.
Steve moved his hands down Tony’s side, wrapping one arm possessively around Tony’s waist as his other hand made its way to Tony’s ass, squeezing firmly.
“- I enjoy spending time with you, Tony. Plus, like you said - we all need a break sometimes. Thank you for putting this all together, it means a lot.”
“We ran into Star Lord, Gamora and the rest of their friends, they were carrying boxes of snacks, walking out toward Groot’s Grove,” Kate replied, crossing her arms and clearly over patrol.
After lunch, they went on a hike through the woods on Steve’s suggestion. Light snow blanketed the woods, and the men exchanged knowledge about the trees and animals they saw through their walk. On the last part of their hike, they had to walk over an icy trail, so Steve took Tony by the hand and they slowly crossed the ice together, feeling Tony gently squeeze even through their winter gloves. At one point, Tony began to slip, but was immediately caught by Steve and never hit the ground.
“Anytime. We can spend the entire week on this couch staring out the window if that’s what you want. Or -”
From the kitchen counter, Tony watched a small throw pillow fly across the room and land on the floor under where the TV was attached to the wall.
“But then a month ago. I was up in my workshop working late, tinkering with something when I heard a big crash. Ran outside to see a big brown wolf in the moonlight, just standing in the middle of the field. Then the wolf got up off all fours and stood on its hind legs. And I could see it wasn’t just a wolf. And then that wolf turned around, looked at me . . . and fell to the ground and turned back into you.
Steve looked at the mistletoe, and the perfect man underneath it, and couldn’t help but lean forward.
He cupped the side of Tony’s face with one hand as he moved in for the kiss. Their lips met, softly touching at first but as a quiet fear ran through Steve’s head - don’t let him go - Steve pulled Tony in closer to deepen the kiss. Tony let out a small hum as he kissed back, and ran a hand up Steve’s chest as they finally broke apart.
Steve grabbed his coat and rushed out of the club and into the chilly night air before Sam or Bucky could stop him. He quickly walked back to his room, and slammed his door behind him, sliding down and sitting on the floor.
Tony and Steve entered the private residence elevator alone, and stood close together as the doors closed. For the first few floors, there was just silence, nether Tony or Steve able to speak or make eye contact with the other.
Steve slid back into the booth, cheeks burning bright red as Tony was pulled into a dance with a girl Steve didn’t recognize.
Tony smiled and got comfortable in his seat, picking the music for the ride. They spent the next couple hours chatting, Tony sharing facts about his favorite bands - an entire era of music that Steve had missed while he was on ice.
Tony didn’t know how to proceed. He couldn’t see his enemy, and he couldn’t even do a barrage attack because Steve was now mixed in there among the smoke.
bed you needed to be in. And last time I checked mine is plenty big enough for the two of us. C’mon, let’s grab you a change of clothes from the dorm and we can head back to my place.”
Sure, winter was great. But winter in a city like New York just got to be a little too much, sometimes. So that’s what prompted Steve to ask Tony about winter getaways as they finished another training session. Even Captain America needed a change in scenery once in a while.
“Alright, look, we’ve got this from here. Go get checked out in the medical wing, and then to my office for a debrief. We’ll talk more about this then.” He then returned to the large crowd of students now forming around the gate.
A couple hours later, Tony found himself with Steve strolling down the Coney Island boardwalk. The boardwalk was filled with laughing children and happy families; teens excited to finally be free for the summer. The sound of the beach mashed with the roar of the amusement park rides and music.
Steve turned in bed to see Tony sat up, trembling and lightly clutching at his chest. Steve turned on a bedside lamp and shuffled over to be with Tony.
The visor snapped up. “We need to get them all out of this ball pit. But some of them are pretty far back. . .”
He spent a lot of free time in the spring semester lying in the quad, watching Tony zoom across the sky in his Iron Man armor. Even when they started to argue about how to proceed with missions, Steve still admired how smart and creative Tony was - and he said so, which would usually result in a witty comeback or light teasing from Tony. Steve never took it to heart, having been reassured by Widow that that was just how Tony was with everybody.
“ . . . Yeah.” Tony sighed and laid back down on the grass on his stomach, burying his face in his arms.
“Alright, Tony. It was nice to see you. Have a nice Valentine’s Day!” Steve quickly backed away, and retreated back to Sam and Bucky.
“It’s fine, Sam. Honestly, I’m just over this being a distraction for me. Better to just move on, get over it and focus on finishing the school year, right?”
They cooked dinner together (roasted salmon, seasoned potatoes, salad and wine), and rested on the couch watching a show about science.
For Steve, it was a chance to learn and have fun. He’d ask Tony questions about building armor, soldering techniques, and how to program such powerful weapons into such tiny spaces. And an opportunity to just be a little silly - Steve would sing along to whatever song Tony happened to be playing at the time, or making up lyrics. He’d dance around in the prototypes of armor to show off how easy it was to move in it.
Well maybe that wasn’t entirely true. Steve spent a decent part of the weeks following Tony’s entrapment dodging concerned looks and questions from Sam and Natasha. It had been an incredibly difficult time for Steve. He had been in love with Tony since the day they met, but he had never managed to get out the words to let Tony know how he really felt.
Steve’s cheeks turned a bit pink. “Aww, thanks.” He picked a branch and placed a candy cane down, and began to move around Tony as they proceeded to decorate. Ornaments, bells, and lights. Steve wrapped the string lights around the tree as Tony walked back and forth under Steve’s arms, placing ornaments in spots all around.
an improvement - it truly was better to vent to Jan and Rhodey about how much he truly liked Steve. Better than the year or so of vehement denial where Tony refused to even admit he had feelings for Steve, and a million times better than before he had confided to them that he was into guys at all.
“Excuse me, sorry, watch out, apologies,” Steve said as he pushed his way into the ball pit. Steve carefully picked up some of the tsums in his arms as he shuffled to the back of the pit. The tsums gently clinged onto his uniform, and a little chorus of “tsum! Tsum!” followed him as he wandered around. As he continued to gather up tsums the colorful balls of the pit were revealed more and more. Steve continued to shepherd the tsums back to the entrance, and as he turned around he saw Tony, tsum on one shoulder, visor up, with a slice of pizza in one hand and his phone recording in the other.
. One football-wielding robot tries to take you out and want to hide? You’re supposed to be a big brave superhero -”
But now he was an adult, and one with super abilities at that; so as much as he understood and appreciated his mother’s apprehension he wasn’t going to miss out on the winter fun now.
“Alright, settle down everyone. So first, a few announcements.” Fury took a piece of paper from Steve, who as Student Body President was required to sit on stage for these assemblies. “In extracurriculars news, tickets to next month’s Spring Formal go on sale this week. See Student Council Events Coordinator Wasp for more details. The Fitness Club will be doing a charity race through the obstacle course on the 6th. The outdoor pool at the Aquatic Park is now open for the season, and the Collector’s Museum now has a new exhibit on Celestial Artifacts. I believe those of you in Odin’s Relics course are required to go but I encourage you all to check it out because, well, it’s pretty neat.” A small chuckle went over the audience as Director Furry continued.
“You know Tony, you joke but shouldn’t that be a good test? I mean if you could actually do the Charleston while wearing armor the armor would HAVE to be pretty darn flexible, right?” Steve asked, examining one of the pieces of the chest plate.
“Tony, I know we butt heads sometimes and we don’t always see eye to eye. But you know I care about you so much. Both as teammates and as friends. But the truth is, I don’t actually let on
anything burn down, you all have access to the campus alert systems and for the love of god do not wake me unless we are literally at war. Have I made myself clear?”
Tony was used to being watched, to being adored. What he wasn’t used to was the fervent outpouring of gratitude that so easily tipped toward almost cult-like.
Steve laughs. “Dirty slut,” he teases and Tony snarls, kitten weak and just as cute as he wriggles on Steve’s cock.
Wanda can't be pried away from the TV. She watches the news for three days, watches the mutants protesting and fury in a quiet old man who stands as their leader. She watches the arguing talking heads and when Ross gives another press conference, and the speculating hosts wondering if the Rouges were right, fighting the Accords a year ago.
Tony goes still, eyes wide and searching. They hadn’t--the one night they’d spent together, when fighting gave way to fucking in Clint’s cramped guestroom, it had been dark. He might have missed a tattoo, then--and he hadn’t seen Steve naked even when they were trapped in the past looking for that goddamn stone, but he’d seen
--doesn’t kiss Tony and nod, and put the world’s problems aside. It makes something twinge, cold and scared, in his belly.
He knew it and when he held Tony for the first time, saw that familiar shade of chocolate whiskey, he
The royal edict is delivered by the young page, the one who blushes when he looks at Thor and smirks at the Storm lord, who Anthony is altogether too protective of. A good boy, he thinks, idly, as he takes the edict and breaks the seal.
"You're supposed to be sleeping," Tony says, not looking up from what he's reading. "You're still healing."
A child's giggle sounds, when Steve backs him into the workshop table, and Tony jerks back, his heart pounding.
"It's one base, Steve. The council can handle one base. HYDRA is never going to recover from what you and Winter did, after Triskelion. This isn't that."
They move into the penthouse downtown three months after Tony becomes CEO, when Rhodey has returned to the Air Force and Stane has muttered about appearances often enough that Tony had snarled at him.
He's miffed, a little, that the captain stopped, that he didn't take this to it's natural and proper end.
There is a period of adjustment. A few months when the Ironborn march armed through the Keep to protect the queen regent and the young heiress. Months of letters sent from the Six when Anthony sets aside his crown.
He sobs, after, collapses into Steve’s arms and cries, all fitful and guilty, and mumbled apologies smeared against Steve’s throat.
, wants to keep him the way he keeps Rhodey, and he doesn’t know how to do that, if Rhodey hates Steve.
Bucky who lies in bed with Sam, and traces his fingers over the black lettering, and Sam watches him, dark eyes calm and warm and when Bucky murmurs against his throat, “Tell me,” Sam did, spun out stories about the man he loved, before the sky exploded and tore him away.
Today he wants this--Tony spread out like a feast, hips clamped in Steve’s hands as he fucks him, hard and rough, just the right side of too much while Tony’s cock bounces against his belly and tears leak from the corner of his eyes. He wants Tony’s whimpers a delicious duet with his filthy groans, his desperate
“You didn’t,” he says, fiercely and Steve looks down at him. “She made her choice, Steve. She did. And maybe--maybe what we did wasn’t fair. But she made her choice before I fell in love with you, before you ever dreamed about being with me. Peggy died alone because she pushed everyone away from her, and that happened before the divorce.”
Steve cleaned himself up with his shirt, a faded old thing from a picnic Peggy had dragged him to, and dropped it on the floor before he brushed a kiss over Tony’s sweat slick forehead and swiped a finger through his come, licked it from his finger. “When you’re legal, baby.”
She licks her lips, tastes sherry and blood there, and her fingers tremble. She isn't sure if it's fear or arousal, and doesn't want to think about it anymore, doesn't want to think about the ring of black around Tony's eyes and the way he'd clung to Steve, flinching away from even her. She doesn't want to think of the slick puddle of blood or the way Howard had looked, slumped against the wood floor, or the way that Steve had looked, curved protective over Tony.
of it, scrawled in the margin and voice recordings that he doesn't bother to open. "What is this about, really? Is it Rogers?"
The thing about Steve is--he’s miserable. But he’s never let being unhappy stop him, not when he was ten and an orphan in Peggy Carter’s house, not when he was sixteen and furious over Bucky’s accident, not when he was nineteen and heartbroken.
She stares at him, wide eyed and Tony smiles, a sharp dangerous thing. "You don't understand what Steve means to me. And maybe--maybe if I explained it, you'd change. But I shouldn't have to. Not to you. You're my
There’s a beat of silence that lasts forever and then, “Sir, this is Ellen Reed at Liberty Assisted Living. I’m calling--”
He waits until Tony is home, until the shock’s worn off and he’s functioning again, because he thinks if he calls and tells Rhodey when Tony is still unable to answer a phone, the man will come storming in full of fear and fury and he’s pretty sure that it’ll get violent.
Tony still dreamed, sometimes, about the army on the other side of the wormhole, about a mad killer that hadn't come for them, but
He sucks him off over Christmas, gets the taste of his come and the scent of him, expensive cologne and motor oil, and when he kisses Tony, when Tony sucks on his tongue like he would Steve’s cock, he ruts against Tony’s hip and breathes, “When you’re legal, baby.”
“Please, beloved,” Tony gasps, once, and Steve shouts, his name, ripped from him among the curses and pleas and Tony convulses, hole fluttering tight around him.
Tony presses closer. "She wrote to me. Before we married, and gave it to me today. Pepper--when they told me you were dead, Pepper kept me alive. She kept the Kingdom afloat." Steve makes a noise, and his hands tighten on Tony, squeeze him closer. "Rhodey and James--they did their part. But I wouldn't be here, if I didn't have her. I think that's where Stane made his mistake--he killed you and I fell apart--but she put me back together and held everything in place, until I could do my duty."
“I know,” Tony says, “But it’s Howard. That’s just--you can’t expect much from Howard, Steve. He’s not good at living up to anyone’s expectations.”
"I do too, sweetheart," Steve says easily. "But if we moved, we could get that big king size bed you're always goin’ on about."
"I love you," she says, because Pepper has always been braver than he is, and he flinches, a little. "Being your queen. Your wife. Being your friend and partner--that has been the greatest honor of my life, the thing I have loved more than anything beyond our daughter. I will never regret these seven years, or loving you."
Because Rogers might be a shattered hollow shell, might be a rabid dog--but there was a leash, and Tony Stark held it.
They don't talk, right away. There's the mess of getting home, finishing the mission, getting the collar off Wanda and containing her wild, uncontrolled fury in the aftermath. There's Clint's rage to handle, his fury burning hot and deep and
He only knows that when he pulls Tony from the car, and Tony’s legs wrap around him, he’s hard and rutting against Steve’s belly with soft little moans that Steve eats from his lips, and swallows down, greedy for everything his boy gives him, always.
But people talk. At the company, where they will sometimes vanish into Tony's office and emerge mussed and satisfied an hour later. At galas and charity dinners, where Tony always arrives and leaves without a date, where Steve glowers silently at anyone who gets too close to him and grits his teeth when Tony dances with the pretty young debutants of New York's million dollar club.
“Serum happened,” Steve shrugged. “Body pushed it out. I kept redoing it--poor Jones got real tired of me showing up at his tent--but it never took. I had it, when I went into the ice.”
He’d left the shirt and Tony still handcuffed and the next morning, Tony was sitting at the breakfast table across from Peggy when Steve came back from his run, in faded sleep pants and that damn shirt and he’d smiled, a private thing at the reminder of his promise.
Barely, but he does. From the corner of his eye, Tony can see Steve, the tense frame of him, the fury in his drawn set features, and he wonders if he’s right. If Steve would kill Howard, for hitting him.
Later that week, each student received an email with their assignments. Tony opened the message and quickly scanned the calendar, his eyes landing on the following Friday.
But as Tony approached, two missiles shot out from the top of the tank. He quickly unibeamed each on, relieved the work on his aim had paid off, but the guns at the top of the tank made it clear there was more where that came from.
“I love you too, Steve. We, aha, we’ve never actually said that to each other before,” Tony said, his heart slightly racing.
“No, I ran under Sam and Tony’s arms as they both tried to push past each other to get in first,” she replied, as Steve smiled. “So how are you feeling?”
After the immediate battle, the team went their separate ways, but the nature of needed meetings and conferences and investigations occasionally had brought Steve back from Washington D.C. and onto Tony’s doorstep. Apartments had been set up for each of the team in the Tower, so they could come and go as needed or as they pleased. Steve had relocated to Washington DC to work with SHIELD with Natasha, Thor returned to Asgard, Clint went off for “personal time” as he called it, and Bruce retreated back out of the spotlight as quickly as he could. With the exception of Thor the others had all made a trip or two back to the Tower, usually unannounced, but Tony was happy to have them back whenever they could be there.
“The doctors kept asking me for details but I honestly don’t know what to tell them. What happened?”
The door to the common room quietly opened, and Steve paused to take in the scene before him. Not there previously, a big fresh Christmas tree was placed in the middle of the living room, undecorated with the exception of red garland wrapped around the tree. Tony, by himself with ornaments and tinsel in hand, stared at the tall tree in front of him. He hadn’t noticed Steve enter the room, or if he had he didn’t acknowledge it. Soft holiday music played from the stereo as a pile of decorations covered the table, waiting to be used.
So they had waited. Quiet dinners in private rooms, discreet outings, dinner and dancing alone in the Tower. Their time together was sweet and intimate, but Tony also wanted to test the waters. He knew that someday, their relationship would come out one way or another. But how did Steve feel about it?
“Of course. Have to make room for memories, right? Every day with you has been an absolute joy, and I cannot wait to see what beautiful memories we’re going to make in the future. Might as well have a place to put them all, right?”
In the dream he ran until he found a lake. He approached the lake slowly, the reflection of the full moon on the water shining brightly. As he reached the edge of the lake, he looked into the water.
“Like it? I figure it’ll be a nice surprise for the rest of the team when they get back.” Tony handed over a box of fake candy canes.
“So that’s why you wanted the cheese.” Tony finally truly examined his plate as Steve finished grating. “Is that risotto?”
So Steve moved into place as Tony pushed off and plopped onto the tube as they accelerated down the hill. Steve felt Tony lean into his side as they zoomed down the slope toward the lake.
“I mean, hey, Director Fury, don’t feel too bad - those were some pretty sturdy walls you built,” Tony added, which actually got a laugh out of Fury.
The tsums not on Steve quickly scrambled over to the edge of the ball pit as Tony put his phone down and extended a hand to pluck the tsums out and put them down by the pizza.
Steve’s dreams of running through the woods were more vivid than ever before. He could feel the wind as he ran, the crunch of sticks and leaves under his feet.
Steve could hear Tony call out from the kitchen behind him. “So the one downside about this place is that there’s only one bedroom, which you’re more than welcome to. I can sleep out here on the couch.”
And before Steve could finish, Tony dropped down and threw his arms around Steve’s neck and pulled him in close, meeting Steve’s lips for a deep, tender kiss.
So three attempts. Three failures. And all Tony had to show for it was a busted robot, a bad concussion, and a whole lot of embarrassment.
“So, have you heard any more ghost stories since our last camping trip?”, Tony asked as he put a card into the discard pile.
Steve pulled off his cowl and pushed a bit of rubble away from his leg as Tony ran through the wreckage to meet him. “Tony, are you alright? I-“
“Sure! I could recommend a million places. What were you thinking? Tropical island? Rain forest? A cottage off a warm beach?”
The TV played the morning’s news, as Sam, Clint and Nat watched and ate their various breakfasts. Tony was preparing himself a cup of coffee as Steve walked in.
Steve continued to explore the cabin. He opened a door to see a luxurious bathroom, with floor to ceiling tile, couples’ sinks, and a large glass shower and separate soak in tub. The door next to that led to a large bedroom with a king-sized bed.
“You don’t have to, Tony, we’ve shared a bed before. And this one’s massive.” Steve surprised himself with how confidently he had just asked Tony to share a room with him. And before Tony could retort, Steve took both their bags and brought them into the bedroom. Tony didn’t seem to argue about it, so Steve considered the matter resolved.
“Just tell him,” Jan said, taking a piece of popcorn from the bowl Tony had placed on the floor between her and Rhodey.
He pulled the shield over his face and let the ring pulse. He felt the ring get warm, and clicked the trigger. A big pulse of energy fired upward, hitting the interior of the tank and BOOM. The tank exploded in half on top of Steve, as he curled up further under his shield as pieces began to rain back down.
“I’m not going anywhere, Tony. I want to be right by your side, always, and I’m not going to let anything get in the way of that.”
Once up and off the ice, they grabbed some hot chocolate and cookies, sitting at a table and chatting the night away. As the market closed, they wandered back to the Tower. On the way back, Tony couldn’t help noticing the energy around him just felt different. A constant low vibration of excitement, running through his whole body as they walked past the Christmas lights and holiday shoppers. Tony felt a happy jolt when Steve, at one point, patted him on the back while they had been discussing something about charity work. What they had exactly said, Tony couldn’t remember, because all of his focus was on the vibration in his body and the solid warmth on his back.
“What have you been up to while you’re recovering? I mean, besides the whole concussion thing, how’s this school year been? Build any interesting armors?  Have any plans for spring break? Figured out what missions you want to work on this summer? Have you been seeing anyone?”
“I need to tell you something. I’ve thought about this for a long time but I honestly just need to say it and get it off my chest and once I know you know then no matter what I can be at peace.”
Tony moved forward, and Steve knowingly opened his arms to embrace Tony, who buried his face into Steve’s chest. His arms hung around Steve’s neck, Tony let out a small sob. Steve ran his hand reassuringly up and down Tony’s back, letting the other man cry.
It was clear Tony was still upset. “I’m sorry I scared you out in the woods,” Steve said. “Thank you for coming to help.”
Steve excitedly began to open the gift, revealing the hat box and quickly opening it to see its contents. He pulled out the scrapbook, the cover with shiny letters saying “
It was cheesy, Tony knew, but he couldn’t deny the tingle of excitement when the delivery of scrapbooking supplies arrived. Paper, stickers, labels, markers and pens, colorful tape. If Tony Stark was going to do something, he wasn’t going to half-ass it. Nor was he going to pass off the assembly of the scrapbook to a professional - this was too personal, and even with all the instructions in the world no one was going to be able to capture what these memories had meant to Tony more than Tony himself.
Tony immediately jumped up and ran outside, too angry in the moment to finish asking Steve on a date. After several minutes of yelling - something along the lines of “
Tony looked down to see Steve’s chest, a faint ring of light over the star on his uniform forming the centerpiece of the chained armor.
Steve parked in the driveway as they exited the car and brought their luggage inside. Rustic but still modern - it was clear the log cabin was a smart house (Steve didn’t expect less from Tony) and the inside looked like it had come straight from a magazine.
“Yeah, whatever fruity house special they have tonight,” Tony said as he raised his glass to show off a pink drink with two strawberries on the rim.
in your nighttime decision-making. The security system will help us take a proactive stance to ensure safety throughout the campus, from outside threats and internal mishaps.
As Tony said that, a glow emitted through the smoke and a continuous beam shot out toward the campus exterior wall. Chunks of rock began to fly back toward the campus.
Dinner is awkward and tense, and Wanda is withdrawn, sullen when she isn't outright hostile. It's fun, the way that family dinners with Howard and Maria were fun, in the way that Tony thought he'd left behind decades ago.
Sunset hadn't managed to stomach being around Tony for longer than a few months. He huffs a sigh and scrubs a hand over his hair.
He doesn’t know how long it lasts, how long he spends feasting on the sweet pouty mouth, pressing open wet kisses to Tony’s long neck and delicate clavicle, sucking bruises there.
He makes a face when he takes in what Steve's wearing, gives his coffee a mournful sort of stare, before he straightens and jogs after Steve.
“What the hell do you do when a loose cannon controls a weapon of mass destruction,” he murmurs, and rubs his forehead.
Tony gives him a smile, something flickering in his eyes that Steve can’t quite read, before it’s gone. “He does that, sometimes.”
and we both know it,” Steve said. “I’m the only one you want. The only cock you want to taste and the only one you’re going to ride.”
"Everheart has her name on a lot of this shit," Rhodey says and Tony blinks at him. "And you can say what you want about Christine--but you've trusted her since she came to you about Gulmira. Pepper has too."
“I came back for you,” Steve says because he’s never told Tony that and never realized he needed to. It startles Tony silent and Steve shifts. Sits up and says, “In the original timeline--you weren’t mine. You were--the world hurt you. It hurt you until you broke, except you never did. You never lost your kindness. And I hurt you. I didn’t--it was never what I wanted. But I did. And you died.” He chokes, the horror of that moment, when Tony’s heartbeat stuttered and faded and
Tony is staring at him, bright and beautiful and demanding, holding out his hand, and his ring gleams, gold coated vibranium and rubies set to either side a blue-bright diamond. It glitters, a pretty promise he carried with him from his time, his future that he hated, and he reaches out, clings to Tony’s hand in this future he loves, that he fought for, that he gets to keep.
“Too much to ask? Of course not. Actually, it’s a great idea. Just don’t tell Clint we have this though, he’ll eat the whole damn thing.”
The sounds of the forest were gone. No whooshing, no bikes, no smashing, no chaos of a pursuit in progress. He stopped and took a look around. Something wasn’t right. Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that he had eyes on him. He could feel his heart start to race. And suddenly, a searing pain in his left side as he was tackled down to the ground.
“Steve, where did you go? I don’t have a visual on you,” Tony said, as he continued to dodge missiles and shots from the tank.
A gift for Steve’s birthday. Steve was many things, including sentimental. Tony had pondered for weeks over the perfect gift for his boyfriend. He knew that while he could afford anything Steve would appreciate a personal gift thousand times more than just a valuable one.
Steve continued to work Tony open as Tony let out small moans in between repeating Steve’s name. When Tony was ready, Steve slicked himself up and slowly pushed into Tony, meeting Tony’s lips with a kiss as he bottomed out. Steve held himself up with one arm by Tony’s head, stealing loving glances into Tony’s eyes between kisses as Tony got adjusted.
“I’m really sorry, Steve. I wish I could help more,” Tony said sadly from the couch on the other side of the room. They were in Stark Tower, for their weekly study session/project time. Due to Tony’s injury, he wasn’t allowed to look at computer-generated models or use power tools or other machinery. Which made working on their armor project much more difficult. A job once equally divided, most of the work now laid on Steve’s shoulders to construct, wire and test their project.
“Enjoying myself? Tony, this is so nice. Do you know how long I’ve wanted to go on a date with you to a museum?”
Tony moved a hand down between them, slowly beginning to stroke Steve’s cock, gathering the bit of wetness at the tip and moving downward until Steve was fully hard. Then Tony worked up to stroking them together as Steve began to leave marks along Tony’s neck and chest. Once they were both hard, Tony moved his hand off their cocks and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and legs around Steve’s waist.
“How about this - go over to that side of the quad. When Steve comes back around, wave him over. It’s Steve. He’s gonna stop to go talk to you. Then just chat briefly, and say you’d like to hang out with him soon. Like maybe grab a burger and then some drinks at Club A.
Tony looked back to the ground at the loose balls and back to the ball pit. “Why are the balls only red and blue?”
O’Leary’s made some of the best steaks in all of New York, and Tony reserved a private room for the team. Even Thor had managed to come, having decided to spend a few weeks on Earth with Jane. The dinner was delightful, with good food, drinks and just spending time in each other’s company without the pressures of saving the world for once. And Tony couldn’t help but notice the small smiles and glances he was getting from Steve across the table.
But up close? Steve knew all too well that if you stared at New York in the winter for too long, the ugliness began to show. Crowded stores meant annoyed shoppers, mass transit packed with riders wearing multiple layers. Too cold outside, too warm inside; the pure white snow turning into grey nasty mush after just a moment on the pavement.
Nat looked at Tony, grabbed a bag of chips from a cabinet and turned to go back to the couch. “What? Don’t give me that look. It’s actually a pretty entertaining show.”
“Yeah . . . it makes me happy to be able to take care of someone I care about, and to make them happy too. So if I was gonna ever tell you how I felt, I wanted to do it right, and start taking care of you right from the start,” Steve answered as he sat down next to Tony, putting their plates on the table.
But Tony grew quiet instead, looking down at the ground and not saying another word. As far as Steve was concerned, that was all the confirmation he needed to know that Tony wasn’t interested. A little tied up in his own feelings, Steve continued to work quietly until it was time to leave, and he didn’t waste any time exiting Stark Tower.
Tony spread his legs as Steve moved to prep him. As Steve began to circle one finger around Tony’s entrance, he whispered into Tony’s ear.
“I can’t believe Bradley is making a cheesecake again. Didn’t he listen to the judges last time? He’s playing it safe! And that’s hardly a crumble topping! It’s like he wants to go home. Sam, are you seeing this?!”
The rest of the day was uneventful, with the pair spending a few hours reading (Tony) and painting (Steve), followed by a nice lasagna dinner.
Tony jumped up and ran into the Iron Man armor, as Steve grabbed his gear. Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist as they jumped off the roof of Stark Tower. They dropped quickly, Steve grabbing tightly onto Tony. They landed at the front gate with a heavy thud.
After the dinner, the team wandered over to a large holiday market in Midtown near the Tower. Stalls of gifts, food, snacks, trinkets, jewelry and art spanned across the park, surrounding a large Christmas tree and skating rink.
“Because I’m in love with him, okay!” Tony shouted, and turned so his back was now to the rest of the quad. He continued softly, “When I’m just asking someone out on a casual date, someone I’ve just met, when I haven’t really developed feelings for them but I just think they’re cute or cool, it’s
“Bruce, would you like to help me look for a gift for Jane? I’d love to bring her back something from New York.”
Finally clear for a moment, as Hulkling and Hawkeye took out the rest of the agents, Steve felt around his pocket and felt the ring from their armor project.
Tony wandered around campus, looking for Steve. He passed by students going back and forth between classes, others practicing aiming techniques and fighting stances. He moved past the construction zone near the gate of the school, where he saw Pepper observing and taking notes.
Since Tony had gotten injured, it had been that much harder to hold a conversation with him. Steve couldn’t figure out what was wrong, and decided to push a little.
Steve jumped awake in bed, gasping for air and popping out of bed to look at himself in the bathroom mirror.
, Steve thought. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe I just haven’t made the connection with the right person yet?” Steve proposed.
“What are we looking for -” Tony tried to ask before getting shushed by Steve. Steve quietly eyed the stairs near the ball pit, slowly climbing up. He motioned for Tony to join him.
Tony flashed a mischievous smile. “Maybe. But we’ll be here all night waiting for these little guys to crawl over here themselves. Hop to it. I’ll go get the other one.”
“No, no. It’s fine. Um. I mean, it hasn’t been the best semester? Classes are okay. I’ve enjoyed working on this project, I like the concept a lot. I actually haven’t been building other armors, not even because of the injury. Just no inspiration, you know? My choices for spring break are go home or stay here at this point, so I’ll probably just be spending the week at the pool in the Aquatic Park. No missions for summer yet. And no, as far as love life goes I’d describe it as a bunch of tumbleweeds rolling through a ghost town.”
“Wait! I almost forgot.” Steve got up and grabbed a cheese grater and one of the parmesan blocks Tony had ordered, and quickly grated the cheese over their dishes.
“Yes! Please, I’d like to talk to him.” While the whole incident was a bit of blur, the horrified look on Tony’s face when he first found Steve was clear in Steve’s mind.
When Steve saw Tony, he started beaming and jumped off the bars, landing in front of Tony who jumped back a step.
The pair finally ended up back by the doorway to hang the last of the decorations. Green garland went around the doorframe, with Steve and Tony each taping up a corner.
On the TV, four bakers were frantically running around a kitchen set, grabbing supplies from a shelf. A woman dropped a container of flour and it burst onto the floor. A man with a handlebar mustache started whipping a mixing bowl.
Except winter in New York was deceptively picturesque. Easy to get caught up in the holiday displays and lights and joy, to be in awe at the snow falling against the city skyline. New York, at a distance, sparkled in the winter.
They were almost done with the main piece of the armor - the chestplate. Its center was a ring,  that functioned like a mini arc reactor, that clung onto the user’s uniform or clothing. When pressure was applied to the ring, a chainmail like armor would spread out from the center, unrolling over the user’s body. The chainmail mesh provided protection from heat damage, knife wounds and some bullets, and the ring had a trigger that could release a small energy blast when needed. The armor wouldn’t be designed to be like the Iron Man suit - it couldn’t fly, there were no sensors, etc. - but for an agent who found themselves in the need of extra protection, it would do in a pinch.
“Fine.” Steve jumped up and made his way over to the bar, moving past some students and taking some deep breaths to let go of some the frustration he had with his friends before he spoke to Tony.
After a moment, Tony leaned up, closing the gap between them to softly kiss Steve on the lips. The kiss was warm and tender, and Steve immediately pulled Tony back in for another. Steve’s hands moved down to wrap around Tony’s waist, making Tony’s body flush with his. Tony was now seated on Steve’s lap, his thighs slightly squeezing on Steve’s hips.
From what he could tell, Tony felt similarly. Every once in awhile Steve would turn to watch Tony, small headlamp on his head, face buried in focus in a small pile of metal, hands playing with small tools and wires and gears. Once Tony looked up, catching Steve staring, and just gave him a soft smile. Steve felt his heart do a big flip.
On the ground, Steve hooked the ring of armor onto his uniform and pressed onto it. He felt it grip on as the chain mesh began to spiral out and cover his body, going down his torso and arms. The final project would be an entire suit, but at this point in time, Tony and Steve had only been able to finish the chestpiece. It finished unfurling, with the triggers for the center ring landing in his palm.
“Ugh, don’t remind me, actually glad I was in the ice for that,” Steve mumbled, and the mildly dark response got a snort out of Tony, who slightly choked on his drink. Tony couldn’t help but notice the cheeky look on Steve’s face as they both started laughing.
When Steve woke up, he was in a hospital bed. From his bed, he could see a sunny day out the window, with a tree line he recognized as the one that surrounded the Avengers Compound. The beep of monitors rang in his ear, as an aide was restocking one of the room’s cabinets.
“Sure, Mr. Stark,” the nurse replied as she whisked Steve away and Tony quickly left. Steve was so confused, and wondered why Tony decided not to stay. He was cleaned up and went back to his room that night, still unclear how he ended up both outside
“Hey, I know we were riffing on you pretty hard back there, but it’s not to like, put you down or anything. I think you’re just being way too hard on yourself. Yes, the social scene isn’t what it was in the 40’s but I think you’re much more adjusted than you give yourself credit for. As one of your best friends, I know you pretty well, and I can safely say anyone would be lucky to have you as their significant other. I’m sorry we were being jerks, and I’m sorry things didn’t work out tonight.”
It would take several minutes to get students out of their beds and into their gear and out to the main gate, so as far as Steve saw it, right now the Academy’s main defense was Tony and himself.
“Bad - bad dream. Dreamt about Battleworld again. Being lost, in the desert, looking through pyramids - I -” Tony mumbled quickly.
has had this effect on me before. No one has ever wormed their way into my heart like this - without even trying too! I am
Rhodey turned on the game console in Tony’s room as Jan passed the popcorn bowl to Tony, who sighed.
After a flurry of nurses and doctors came into the room, poked and prodded him with questions and random medical devices, Steve finally felt more awake. He wanted to see a friendly face for a change, and couldn't help but be a little hurt that no one he knew was there when he woke up.
A couple days later, Steve was let out of the medical wing and allowed to go back to recover in his personal quarters. He took it slow - slower than he even expected. He found himself frequently tired, often running a little hot, although he didn’t have a fever. It was odd, really, as he usually recovered a bit quicker from past injuries because of the serum - often to the dismay of doctors who wanted him to slow it down.
Director Fury looked over the four students and gave instructions. “Alright. To start off your patrol, the four of you should take one sweep across campus together to see how things currently are. Get a baseline. Then in pairs go around again, in opposite directions of each other. Once that is done one pair should continue to wander the perimeter of the campus, the other pair seek higher ground and engage in more advanced tactics. Decide amongst yourselves how to do that, although looking at you four I think I already know the split. Keep communicators on, don’t burn anything down, don’t
They went down the hill a few more times, and after the final time, they once again landed in the snowbank. When Steve sat up to look for Tony, he got a big fluffy snowball to the chest. Looking from the snowball’s source, Steve saw Tony preparing more ammunition.
“Oh, I know. Figure it’s a good balance to let those two have some fun and make sure the Guardians don’t have
Steve felt a small blush spread as the doctor left. With his room door open he could hear a small commotion as Nat was the first to run into the room.
“Stark! Rogers!” Director Fury shouted from a distance. He made his way through the rubble and let out a huge sigh of relief when he found Tony and Steve sitting together among the wreckage.
“All designer, usually custom made. I can ask if you want, I’m sure they’d love to dress up someone with a figure like yours,” Tony blurted out, slightly blushing and Steve smiled and grew just slightly pink in the cheeks.
“Hey, I just wanted to say I know we haven’t spoken about last night, and we absolutely don’t have to if you don’t want to, but all I
He wasn’t sure how to ask, because this wasn’t going to be just a usual date. Between their busy schedules, and the high profile that came with being part of the Avengers, Tony and Steve had been keeping their relationship out of public view. The team knew, and so did some members of SHIELD, and Tony’s inner circle. But the fact that Iron Man and Captain America were an item was not public knowledge.
“Hey, JARVIS, write down the ingredient list for that raspberry vinaigrette dressing, that sounds good.”
“Tony, you really love me? I had no idea! I’ve had feelings for you since last year! Why didn’t you let me know?”
I feel the same way. I just wasn’t expecting this, you usually get so quiet around me, I just didn’t think you were that interested in me.”
Tony caught Steve as he fell back down. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you.” Tony pulled Steve in for warmth. “Are you okay?”
“If this team grows any further we’re going to need a bigger mantle,” Tony said, watching Steve delicately try to fasten the last stocking over the fireplace.
So once a week, Steve met Tony at Stark Tower to go over that week’s lesson and to start planning their final project, which would be a take on adaptable armor that would meet in the middle between the protective but flexible nature of Steve’s uniform and the durable and powerful nature of Tony’s.
“Seriously, if Fury wants me to go over this new tech and check for bugs, I’ll do it. I don’t know where he’s getting his stuff from but mine is probably better.”
Steve thought about it. “Would it be too much to ask for a few blocks of that fancy parmesan cheese they were cooking with?” he asked shyly.
“Let’s get you back inside.” Tony pulled off his sweater to let Steve tie around his waist as they quickly and quietly. Tony walked him back to the medical wing to get the cuts clean, grabbing Steve a pair of scrubs to wear for bottoms on the way.
Upon hearing the words “full moon” Steve felt his stomach drop, and he turned to see Tony staring at him
much fun. I’m not trying to spend this weekend writing incident reports for Director Fury.” Steve smiled softly and looked back ahead, as Tony felt his stomach do a small flip.
Steve looked around. The dotted lights across a sleepy campus gave off faint glows. What was usually a bustling school was quiet, peaceful. Between the few remaining lights and the height of Stark Tower, Steve could see many stars across the night sky. “Wow. I never realized how beautiful the view is up here at night.”
The sun had long ago set, and the night’s full moon shone brightly through the thick branches of the woods. Steve was running, running, running, until he noticed a change. A sudden, but significant one.
“Tony, what’s wrong? You can tell me anything.” Steve stared back at Tony - into Tony, and Tony felt his heart break.
“Need a hand?” Tony reached out and pulled Steve and the tsums out of the pit. They moved to the floor, spreading out the leftover pizza around as the tsums all chowed down.
- and he felt his body continue to shift. Mouth turning into more of a muzzle, claws coming out of his hands and feet, light brown fur spreading all over his body. He wanted to panic, run, scream, do anything to make it stop. It wasn’t painful, but it was terrifying. He dropped forward, now on all fours, and the instinct to run and escape the indoors hurdled him through the glass window and out onto the lawn of the compound and sprinting into the woods.
Steve kissed Tony gently and pulled him into a quiet embrace, just the two of them alone, city lights glowing around them.
“Steve, we literally fought giant monsters with flame breath two weeks ago. I think you and I can handle a ride on a large tire.”
“Okay, how about this. You go sit on the couch so you don’t turn to jelly on me, and I’ll go make us some hot cocoa and we can talk about this more?”
“Your lover is over by the bar with his friends,” Bucky said, as he passed out the drinks and sat back down. Steve turned around to see Tony, who was in the middle of posing for a selfie with Jan in front of the decorative display at the bar.
Steve leaned over, and opened the drawer with one hand. He didn’t take his lips off Tony’s neck as he blindly fumbled around the drawer until he pulled out a bottle of lube.
Tony sat up. “Wait, seriously? I mean no - no judgment it’s just you’re one of the most handsome guys at school, I’m just shocked no one has asked you out.”
“Just so you know, you’re not alone in that. Leaving you behind, it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done and one of the worst days of my whole life, Tony,” Steve said, reaching for Tony’s hand in the water. “The whole team was devastated, but I mean this truly when I say I was heartbroken, to return to the tower - our home - and not have you there.”
“And that fancy bamboo cutting board Chef Amelia was using to prepare her salad,” Sam called from the kitchen, finally giving in and making himself a meal after several hours of watching delicious food be prepared.
Toward the bottom of the slope, the tube hit a small hill, sending them slightly airborne. They landed on the ice with a bounce and slid to the right bank of the lake. With the distribution of weight, the tire lightly flipped on Steve’s side, tossing him into the fluffy snow on the shore, with Tony landing on top of him with a plop.
Tony gave a nice roll of his hips and Steve began to pull back and thrust into Tony, slowly building up a rhythm as Tony moaned loudly when Steve would pass over his spot. Steve continued to thrust into Tony, leaning into the crook of Tony’s neck planting kisses and words of love into Tony’s skin. Steve was enveloping Tony, his larger frame holding Tony down as Tony gripped onto Steve tighter as Steve thrust faster.
A few months prior, Tony couldn’t have imagined having such a nice day like this, when they had been at each other’s throats working together for the first time. Sure, Steve was still shy, and a little reserved, but Tony enjoyed chatting about what old New York used to be like, and talking about the City’s history that Steve missed. Without the stress of the world ending, and the pressure of meeting for the first time, it turned out Steve was actually really easy to talk to.
the doctors would tell him. But not this time. Whatever had bitten him had slowed Steve down a bit. Steve resigned himself to just take it easy for a few weeks to let the recovery happen. And it did.
“That’s okay. You always look good and we’re not going very far.” Steve blushed and grabbed Tony’s hand, guiding him toward one of the conference rooms.
He smiles during a press conference, and he's got soot on his face and his armor and there's blood trailing down his temple and his smile is shark sharp and challenging.
"Have you heard from Ross lately?" Natasha asks. Steve's in the middle of writing a report on their last mission, a mess of gun-runners in Cambodia, and the question catches him off center. He blinks.
It was always covered, quick and slick, with a smile. But it was never real. It was always just a mask.
Rhodey goes back to the Air Force with the promise of a new flight pack that Tony had tucked away, and he settles back into the apartment with Steve’s blue gaze tracking him, curious and cautious both.
Rhodey flicks an eyebrow up and says, evenly, “I was willing to believe that--but then he kept talking about how he’s talked to Howard. Wanna explain that?”
Obie opens his mouth, and the king shakes his head. "But there is no war to wage here. The only deaths owed are the sellswords and Lord Stone, and they are already dead." He looks at Obie then, and Obie hears the knight move, the rustle of armor shifting, and something wet against his throat.
"I had a meeting with him, on behalf of SI," Tony says, slowly, arching an eyebrow. "Not  any of your concern."
It doesn’t stop her from saying, “You and Tiberius have been friends for years, Anthony. No one has heard from him since he arrived at the villa. We’re all worried.”
Rhodey's lips thin, and he shakes his head. "You know you don't gotta play these games with me, Tones. I thought you learned that shit in college."
He agrees, and he tucks the hurt away and when Tony smiles at him, he smiles back and it feels, almost, real.
“Hey,” Steve says, soft, tugging his attention from the spiral and Tony blinks up at him. “You went away,” Steve says, and Tony flushes. He shifts a little, his legs folded under him as Steve sits down next to him and passes him a bowl of chicken chowder. It’s thick, hearty. There’s a heel of bread, oven warm and garlicky, from the bakery down in Queens that Peter knows he likes.
He wrings three orgasms from Tony before they finally collapse in a sweaty heap next to the come smeared glass, and Tony stares at the distorted city beyond the glass and filth and says, "I'll call the movers tomorrow."
She leaves as silent as she was while he fucked Tony while she stood in the shadows, a ghost he mourned a lifetime ago, and he gathers forever into his arm and Tony smiles up, bratty and expectant and vibrant.
Tony blinks at him. It stings. More than losing his inheritance--the thought of losing Jarvis hits like a blow.
"The Iron Keep will be ruled by Queen Regent Pepper, until Princess Morgan comes of age," he says, and Thor hums, a thoughtful little noise, mildly curious. Bless him, Loki thinks, fondly, he had not one whit of interest in intrigue, in the political maneuvering that ruled the Six.
The signet ring on his hand, Tony has a divot on his back, from being hit with that hand, that fist. There’s blood on the ring, and he wonders, distant and idle, if it’s his blood.
to them. Hating someone, gossiping about who they're fucking--it's not worth being on Tony Stark's shit list.
“Do you remember that flight, when I was trying to get Bucky back?” Rogers asks, and Howard blinks. “I defied orders and flew behind enemy lines, bombed a HYDRA base single handedly for my
This is Tony frigid and rigid and glaring at him, and Steve staring back, burning with hurt, and the team watching, awkward, and
“Well then. Let’s not keep him waiting,” Tony says lightly and ignores the looks Rhodey and James exchange, choosing to lead the way out of the royal suite and down to--
Shoves his hands in his pockets. Rocks on his heels. "You know, Ty told me about the time you seduced him. Rhodey told me when you tried to kiss him. And I never said anything--Ty was a cheating bastard and Rhodey has always been able to take care of himself. But you tried to play those games with Steve, Mama."
He sways a little when he stands, and his stomach turns, but he keeps his feet by sheer stubborn will. "I want a meeting in ten minutes."
“He’s--sleeping,” Tony says, shortly, throwing a quick look at their bedroom door. Steve is exhausted, or the knock would have woken him. “Why are you here?”
He’s shuddering, a fine little tremble that he doesn’t even notice, until Steve’s strong hand cups the back of his neck.
"They have SI weapons," Natasha says, and it silences the room, cold and tense, and his muscles tighten, because--
Tony frowns up at him, and Steve shifts, lowers himself to rest against his chest, peering up at Tony. "You know I'd do anything for you," he murmurs and Tony softens, melts into the couch a little, his fingers brushing through Steve's hair. "I--I don't like that he's using me to hurt you."
Steve murders Howard and stages it to look like a suicide. If you'd to avoid it, please stop reading at the scene break after
It’s the way sometimes, when he’s drifting on the edge of sleep, he can hear Tony masturbate, the slick glide of his fist and the gasping little moans shaped like Steve’s name.
There is nothing there that he recognizes, nothing of his friend in the cold, angry eyes and bitter set to his mouth.
Tony has nightmares, too. It’s worse, he thinks, than his own nightmares, because he can’t protect Tony from them, can’t keep him from what happened to him in that pretty white house on the water.
They don't make it to the bed, not before Steve is dropping to his knees and choking himself on Tony's cock, not before Tony drags him back up and lets Steve rut against his hip and spill sticky and hot against his skin, not before that desperate burning need blunts, just a little.
Steve’s alone in the art store--close enough to closing that the last of the classes have cleared out and he’s finished straightening up. He’s sketching and waiting for the clock to click over, when the door clatters, and James Rhodes steps into the store.
"He'll be there. There's no way in hell Tony will let the Council sit it out, not if his weapons are involved. He's spent too many years burning through every cache he can find. And the squids--" she shakes her head, rueful. "He'll be there."
Tony snorts, and zips away, and it's only as he goes that Steve realizes that War Machine is on the field, that the team looks almost whole as they fight, Sam and Rhodey covering each other, seamlessly. There are new faces and Tony's voice rings out a few times, cutting through the noise to shout over the battle before he huffs and the comm in Steve's ear screeches before Tony is there, over-riding their tech and making the whole thing
meet Tasha--before she says. "Tony let me crash in his guest wing when my parents kicked me out last summer. You watch that man stumble around looking for coffee after twenty hours in his workshop and tell me he isn't an idiot."
They tell the world that Steve is his bodyguard, that he's a close friend and employee and it's the reason that Steve is allowed to press close, to fill in the gaps around Tony, to accompany him everywhere he goes.
It’s so unexpected it drags Jim’s gaze down and Steve--Steve, Steve, Steve--sighs, deep and long-suffering. “What’d we talk about, you being a brat, Tony.”
Steve holds him them, too, and Tony lays in his arms and thinks that of those bloody smears of gore, the face disfigured and caved in, the crescent shaped blade bisecting a body, and Steve’s large hands that leave bruises on his hips when they fuck, and hold him so gently, when he’s scared, and he thinks that maybe he isn’t nearly as scared by the prospect of Steve’s protective fury as he should be.
“I have grieved you for seven years,” he says softly. “And it will destroy me, to send you away. But Morgan is not something I will bargain with you about. She is my child, and innocent.”
Tony shoves his hand in his pockets. "Fury saw the Avengers as the endgame. He saw a team that could save the world, if we played our cards right. And he was right, you know--we did. But that's where he stopped
When Loki reads the news, he is sitting in his husband's lap, and Thor is braiding his hair. A pair of puppies play at their feet, and the winter is just beginning to thaw the Iron Keep. They should return home, soon, he thinks.
"How serious is this?" he asks, pouring a cup of coffee, not bothering to give Rhodey time to say good morning.
“She likes your damn armor,” Bucky grumbles, and some of the tension breaks, as the two knights slip into the workshop. Tony uses their presence to put space between him and Steve, something he knows Steve notices, but doesn’t mention.
He thinks of Steve kisses and the promise he whispers before he goes, every fucking morning, and the way Tony felt so safe in his arms, like nothing could hurt him there, and he carefully tidies the photos, his face very blank. “Thanks for bringing these by,” he says, and Fury smirks.
The knock comes while he’s pouring coffee, when he’s almost asleep on his feet and only the fact that he has mid-terms to facilitate keeps him upright.
"Neither of you are real good at lying," Bucky says, lazily and Steve’s shocked gaze swings to his best friend. That familiar glint he’s seen for
Pepper sighs, and comes to curl in his lap, a familiar weight. Her scent wraps around him, and the pressure of the throne grounds him, and he buries his face in her hair.
The vial of ink sits in his palm, a tiny liquid promise, and Tony watches him, with big dark eyes, small against the sea of pillows and broad bed, and Steve loves him.
Their King still blows up fields and buys out taverns. Their Queen still rules with an iron fist and a kind smile, an ruthless efficiency that sees a prosperity and wealth to the kingdom that they hadn't experienced in generations.
, beautiful, real, solid, close enough that Tony could touch him, reach out and feel him solid and warm under his fingers.
"You can't," she says, a promise. "You won't. I'm the mother of your child and heir. You couldn't lose me if you tried. But sometimes, you have to let go of something, because the alternative is holding so tight you will crush it. If I hold on to you, when Steve has returned--you'll hate me. And if you try to hold us
“Peggy’s always been cruel when she’s hurt,” Bucky mutters, curled around Rhodey in their big bed. “And her godson seduced Steve--she’ll never forgive that.”
“I’m gonna spread you out on the table. The big one where you like suck on those fucking popsicles while Howard lectures me about my goddamn duty, and I’m gonna fuck you. You’re still loose from the truck stop, could slide right in.”
The problem is that he let it go too long. But Rogers--the whole obsession Howard had with them, it was outside his hands, something that Howard refused to budge on, and when he realized that they'd
Tony shifts, his heel brushing against Steve’s cock. He doesn’t actually want sex, but it does what he wants--brings Steve’s gaze up, bright and intent on him. “Why are we worried about Asian politics?”
The arm is silver metal plates, shining and sleek and--”It’ll interface, with his neural pathways. If he wants that.”
Tony fidgets while he waits. Dumee is slumped on the couch, panting lightly, bright eyes fixed on his master, and Tony strokes his ears for a moment, nervous and uneasy here, where he's always been at home.
“Not sure I wanna know any more about what you’re cooking up if it’s from your shop.” Bucky drawls, and Tony flushes.
, a familiar face, a beloved uncle, and while Peggy was wrapped up in SHIELD and Howard was wrapped up in SI, Steve was wrapped up in Tony.
"She took a lot of baggage into HYDRA," Tony shoots back. Steve's face goes stubborn and Tony scrubs a hand over his face. He doesn't want to do this, doesn't want to argue with Steve over Wanda fucking Maximoff.
“We’ve got a problem, Carter,” he says. “And you’re gonna need to be read in on what happened last year.”
He should only ever be happy and cared for, a lazy spoiled prince, bratty and cruel in his kindness.
Steve has never had a poker face, not when it came to Tony, and he can see the grief, watch it spread across Steve's familiar beloved face, watch it age him until Steve's shoulders straighten and he says, "I'm real."
. Not perfect. They fight and Tony comes home irritated and sometimes Steve wakes frozen and still, convinced he's still
"You're not supposed to be here," Tony says, distorted and familiar, and Steve shrugs. Slings the shield and takes out a HYDRA agent aiming at Tony's back. He jumps to catch it and slams it down into another black clad goon.
He’s as big as Tony is small, broad shoulders and narrow waist and narrow sharp eyes fixed on Jim like a big cat tracking prey.
Clutches a case to himself before he says, “I brought--it’s for him. If he wants it. Peggy can call, if he has questions.”
“Nat, if I don’t get some hot apple cider in like two minutes I’m gonna cry,” Clint said, dragging Nat off laughing toward some of the concession stands.
“Noted, both noted. Alright. Good job. You two get out of here. I want you both on bedrest for the rest of the weekend. Rogers, I don’t care about whatever healing abilities you may have. You had parts of a tank drop on you. You report to the medical wing for a check-up first thing Monday morning. Is that clear?”
They quickly got out of the hot tub, throwing on the robes and running inside and out of the cold. Steve shut the door behind them and Tony’s hands were immediately on him, pulling off both of their wet shorts and guiding Steve back to the couch. Tony gently pushed Steve onto a blanket on the couch and mounted him again, naked this time. Steve pulled Tony back in close, kissing him and feeling Tony let out a small gasp as their cocks brushed against each other. Steve began to pepper kisses down Tony’s neck as Tony said, “fireplace on,” igniting the electric fireplace and letting the room fill with warmth.
Steve already understood how frustrating it could be to want to help and know that medically you couldn’t. A childhood of sickness, missed playtime, and hospital visits pre-serum meant that Steve didn’t have to imagine how much Tony would be struggling right now.
Tony thought about the past couple of months since the football incident. “I just don’t think Steve is into me.”
“Yes, ew. I hate seeing you like this. Like the life’s been sucked right out of you. How do we fix this?” he waived his hand generally over Tony.
Faint sensations of being moved, picked up securely, gently placed on a table. The bright overhead lights of the Academy’s medical wing. Being poked and prodded, scans and tests. An overall wooziness as he answered questions and moved his hands and feet as requested.
“Absolutely. That sounds great,” Tony answered, turning back to face forward and then mumbled, “that wasn’t hard at all. Huh.”
