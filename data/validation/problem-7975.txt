today was the day they were presenting their history projects, and peter was buzzing with nerves.
mj leaned her head on peter’s shoulder, which peter knew meant she had something to say to him, but nobody would know. “did he just flirt with you? or was that eye fucking?”
peter felt a swell of pride. "well, i'm glad," he said, resting his hand on bucky's head. they sat like that for a while, until bucky leaned up to kiss peter.
steve took out his phone, taking a picture. without stopping, bucky asked, "why did you do that?" steve just smiled. "well, when you're gone, we're going to miss you. especially him," steve said. "he's falling, why don't we get one for against the window?" bucky did as directed, resting tony up against the glass.
their group was paired with two other groups, flash's group, and another group with peter's kinda-friend miles. their meeting site was outside in the greens, close to where peter had told tony about bucky.
"there's no trouble in, mr. rogers. none at all. i hope you know, he loves you."
"you really don't-."
"hello, i'm peter parker, and today i'll be talking about lgbtq people during the 1940s and how it effects us today."
"so, how did it feel to be frozen for 70 years?" flash asked, smug. "i wasn't frozen," bucky deadpanned. "oh, sorry, killing people," flash clarified, a shit eating grin on his face.
"well that was a sight," steve grinned mischievously. "hey, can i uh- can i kiss you?" bucky asked steve. tony was immediately all over the idea. "oh my god, please. please. so hot." bucky smiled as he stood up, having an idea that would make tony happy.
peter mushed their lips together hungrily. "like this?" he asked, nipping in to bucky's neck lightly. he held in a groan, but pressed him and peter's hips together. he smirked a let peter down from his grip. "like that. go get ready for school, wild one."
peter was staying in the same "dorm" area with his group, which meant they had a central living room with a sleeper sofa and a room with two bunk beds through a hallway.  it was small but homey, and everyone just dropped their stuff at the door before leaving to their first meeting of the trip.
after about thirty minutes of investigating the public parts of the compound, the four of them ended up in the lab's lobbies. "well, sorry gang, guess we're not getting any-."
wade, peter, and vincent dove to grab food as mj walked out of the bathroom. "morning, ned. did you bring this food?" she asked, smiling brightly. "yeah, just thought it would make things easier," he shrugged. "well, thank you," she said, kissing his cheek as she sat on a chair to put her shoes on. peter gave ned a thumbs up, and ned flipped peter off.
"don't do that! are you trying to give me a heart attack?" peter exclaimed, falling down on to his bed, sliding off on to the floor. "sorry. i was just wondering if we could talk," bucky said, scratching his neck.
"we gotta slide these pants off, doll," bucky mumbled, kissing up tony's chest as he shimmied the slacks down the shortest's legs. "it's so cold on this wall," tony complained, and steve got an idea.
at the very end of the main hallway, there were two people talking, in what seemed like a frantic way. "dr. banner?" peter called, and the duo paused. the taller one leaned down for what looked like a kiss and then ran off through what peter knew was the domestic entrance. bruce then came walking towards them.
"ya know, my mom told me to behave on this trip before we left," vincent said, laughing. "isn't it sacrilegious to behave on field trips?" peter replied, smiling a little at the other as they exited the bus. "i guess it is, oh wise wizard."
like clockwork, his boyfriend was at his side. "what do you need, tony?" he asked, smiling brightly. tony brushed a hand up on steve's cheek, then leaned up to kiss him softly.
it kind of shocked peter that wade was going on the trip. he had bad marks, smoked pot in school with reckless abandon, and very obviously switched out his water for vodka. he turned around to shake everyone's hand, and peter noticed light scarring from a burn on his arm, but he pulled away too quick for peter to get a good look.
"sei mio," tony growled, kissing and biting with ferocity on bucky's neck, aggressive all of the sudden. "what does that mean?" bucky panted.
"i didn't choose to go over it, tony did. he said the upgrades to the suit were the only things he could reveal to the public right now. take it up with him!" bruce replied, handing out pamphlets about what they'd be talking about.
"if at any time we do need help, i've got two original sources downstairs," he said, and they began to work.
"this has taken too long. i love you, and i love you, tony. and i love us, together. take him, bucky," steve said. bucky kissed him, too. "i will. however you'd like, okay?"
peter shook his head, wiping away tears and trying to steady his voice. "please let me finish my whole thought, or this isn't going to make any sense," he begged, and tony nodded softly. "of course, peter."
"that was a shit show."
"it's okay, i have a tracker on his phone," peter said, fumbling with the find my friends app on his phone. he had every avenger's name and location up there, along with mj, ned, and pepper. "he's out at the bejing office. i think there's a really big meeting thing there today with a contract to build another weaponry in shanghai. is there anything you need me to tell him? i can send an urgent message to him if you need me to?"
"you, too?" bucky said in a dark, raspy tone, as if he was the one choked.   "no, just... fuck. you make us happy. so, so happy. we have to do this more," tony said. bucky smiled, laughing softly.
"by the looks of it, both."
that night, when peter arrived home from school, he was met with natasha and bucky making dinner, bruce and tony watching how it's made reruns, and clint and steve discussing who would win in a fight- bugs bunny or sheen estevez, neither of which steve probably knew about all too well.
"not too great, as i expected. i did get a good grade, though. people are just assholes i guess," he said, taking a bite from an apple that was in the fruit bowl. "i'm sorry, doll. things really haven't changed, have they?" bucky said, sitting down next to peter. peter smiled and brushed a piece of hair out of bucky's face. "they really haven't. they've gotten better, but people are still bigots."
and hear he did. he moaned the loudest moan bucky had ever heard in his life. "you two are prettier than any dame i've ever been with," he said, and that made tony look at him with blown pupils and even more swollen lips.
peter walked them all the way out to the tesla, where he hugged them both and sent them on their way. he marched back inside, throwing himself on the couch. he would be alone for another hour, so he decided to watch tv in the living room instead of his own room.
"i haven't met your boyfriend yet? am i even your best friend?"
bucky directly ignored peter, opting to go with original plan, tickling him. peter shrieked, trying to slide away from bucky, but to no avail. "buck! buck, come on," he laughed, putting his hands on bucky's arms.
," she smiled, sitting criss-crossed on his bed.
"my family is so dysfunctional," peter said to himself, turning to look at bruce who was eating his dinner peacefully. "thank you for being my one sane family member." bruce laughed a little. "as long as i don't hulk out, i'm there for you, peter. would it help if i signed your permission slip?"
bucky came not long after, pulling out but still holding tony. their lips brushed lightly, making the both of them smile and put their heads together.
their teachers were peter's ap statistics teacher and his p.e. teacher, who didn't care very much about what they were doing during this supposed discussion time. honestly, this is what class with them was like, so he knew what to expect all weekend.
"that was serious!" peter exclaimed. bucky tried to catch his breath as he straddled the bench press directly across from peter. "i'm sure it was," he said, smiling at peter, who was pouting. "oh come on!" bucky shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. all of the sudden, he had this sort of smirk on his face. "don't you dare," peter said, pointing his finger in bucky's face.
he started to walk downstairs, checking tony's labs, then his office, and then tony's "bachelor pad" floor, which is where all of their parties are held. lastly, peter started to check the living quarters, and found tony pressed up against the pantry cabinet by captain america himself. "oh my god, really?" he shouted, covering his eyes.
"goddamnit if i haven't been dreaming of this for years," bucky panted, pulling away from tony for the need to hear something other than wet kisses and moans.
"do you know how weird it is to hear you say dad? i never expected to have kids," tony thought out loud. peter smiled, making tony his own serving. "i hope i'm what you wanted," he joked, switching the plates out as he began eating. "oh, you're everything, and more, peter. honestly- you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. i don't know what i would do without you."
peter made it back to the dorm on time for him to grab breakfast and be at their last module on time. it was security protocols and technology, funnily enough. the last three module runners were maria, coulson, and thor, who looked very happy with his spot in the middle.
tony was tired of being short.
a previously invisible door opened, showing off an elusively shiny hallway, which led to the labs. "c'mon, it's this way," peter said, gesturing for his group to follow him again. "goddamn, peter. this is way too complicated," wade said, touching the aluminum alloy walls.
"well thanks, mj, for those words of encouragement!" peter said sarcastically, sitting down across from her and ned in the cafeteria at their table. "yeah, that's a little harsh," ned said, taking a bite of the bell peppers his mom packed for lunch. mj started to eat her school food, and peter sat on his phone.
"if i remember correctly, we almost did do this," steve said lowly, nipping behind bucky's ear. "with who?" tony demanded.
"woah, woah, woah. i will never willingly give you up, peter parker. you're the best person in the world. you're kind, you're sweet, you're extremely intelligent, you're beautiful, and yes, you may have intrusive thoughts, but i will always love you, okay?"
the closet door opened, and in the doorway stood bucky. "hey, sweetheart. i've been looking for you. the quinjet is ready for you," bucky said, holding his hand out so peter could get up. peter didn't accept the offer.
"what's so funny?" wade asked. peter shook his head, grabbing a croissant from the breakfast tray. "i'm bucky's favorite 100%. you can even ask him," he said, ripping the bread in half and taking a bite. "fine," lillian shrugged, grabbing vincent's arm and her jacket, moving towards the door. "let's do it."
"please don't call me bud, i'm an adult and you're not my young step mother. have you checked the labs?"
"as kind as that is, you are one of the panel members, so that won't help either," peter said. "i am?" bruce asked, staring tony down. "that's news to me."
"how did you realize you were bisexual?" bucky asked. "simple. i had a crush on both ned and mj. i told dad and he basically said 'hey, you're gay as fuck, but you also like girls. no biggie, you just joined the club.'," peter smiled.
“no, sir. i didn’t even know he was a teacher until yesterday. he was a fill in for one of the senior teachers because her daughter got sick,” peter explained, bucky noticeably staring at his ass behind him. “so he wasn’t one of your teachers?”
"good lord! that was graphic!" tony shouted, his papa bear showing. "dad, it was fine! i'm a consenting adult!" peter replied, and bucky looked confused.
"not at all... fuck me up the wall. hard. please?" tony said, and bucky felt weak in the knees. "your wish is my command, princess," bucky groaned, and steve made a noise again.
"hey, peter! how was your day?" steve asked brightly. "for the most part, it was okay. except for this," he said, sliding his permission slip across the table for tony to read. "oh shit, i forgot you were in this program," he laughed. "it's not funny!" peter insisted. "what do i do?"
"thank you for helping me with my french," peter said as he closed the door. "it's no problem,
"i need someone to sign my permission slip for a trip to the compound, but since tony can't do it, can you?" peter asked sweetly. he went to grab it and a pen slowly. "do i have to?" happy whined. "yes please," peter smiled, handing over the stuff he reached for. "you're lucky you're tony's kid," happy grumbled.
"this is why people think we're dating!" peter exclaimed. mj and ned laughed, high fiving. "is that a bad thing?" mj smirked, running a hand along peter's jaw. "ha-ha, very funny. you can't do this anymore at my house," he replied, swatting her hand away. "ooh, why?" ned asked, leaning forward. "i might be seeing someone," peter shrugged.
they leaned in to kiss each other again, and again, and quite a few times, actually, before steve walked in frantically from the lab/office entrance. "oh, sorry, peter, buck," he said, and the couple pulled apart quickly. "i was just looking for your dad, bud," steve said, a little winded.
"his name is bucky."
"okay, that's enough, flash," lillian said, hitting his arm. "i'm curious. was it hard getting adjusted to new customs? gays? trans people?" flash continued. "shut the fuck up, dude," vincent said.
“why are you smiling so big?” vincent asked, he himself smiling. “just thinking about some things. ya know, happy shit,” peter blushed awkwardly. vincent laughed, nodding. “yeah, i really do know,” he said, turning his attention back to the teachers.
peter smiled at tony, then began to cry. "oh, peter," tony said, wrapping peter up into a big hug. peter let himself cry into tony's shoulder. "what's wrong, baby?"
"christ," steve mumbled, shifting to adjust himself as he stared at the scene before him. bucky thrusted his hips up, tony reciprocated with a moan, and steve lost it.
i cannot believe it took me this long to write it, but here it is! THE FIELD TRIP.
"you're fucking bucky?"
"but you're not a normal human being. you're spiderman, remember? that's why you live here," mj pointed out. it felt like a jab to the stomach, but peter just nodded, turning to get his history stuff out of his book bag.
"jesus fucking christ," peter said, dropping his tray onto a table in the dining hall and sitting down. wade, flash, and adrianna from miles’ group were trying to get mj's notes because they fell asleep. "why did natasha keep us an hour later? we didn't do anything special," peter complained. "dunno, but she's fucking hot," wade commented, giving up on asking for the notes.
he woke up the tony sitting in the edge of the sofa. steve and bucky were making dinner tonight-
he poked his head back in, smirking. "dinner friday? my treat." peter laughed, but agreed, and bucky took his leave. peter was left, sitting and grinning like a mad man. “a date,” he announced to no one. throwing himself back on his bed. “a date.”
"well, i love them too.”
peter smashed his lips against bucky's, smiling like an idiot as more tears streamed down his face. "i love you, james barnes. will you move to boston with me?"
tony and steve's relationship had been on and off for the past six or so years. they went from hate fucking (peter hated hearing that too), to a rocky relationship, and now, apparently steve wanted to make it official. "as if everyone didn't already know," peter replied to tony, who had just finished telling him all of this. "i know, right!" tony exclaimed, handing peter one of his books.
"of course i have, it's your dad!"
kids? with bucky? peter zoned out imagining it...
"eugene thompson and his group, and miles morales and his group. i'll let them introduce themselves," peter said, waving. "is there any way you could give us an overview of what we're doing?" peter asked, hoping and praying it wasn't his project.
"peter, you need to find tony and steve right now. i can hold him off for a little bit," thor said, and peter nodded, rushing off into the house.
"fucks sake," bucky growled. "knees," he commanded tony, who dropped immediately, and was nuzzled into bucky's hip within seconds after that. "be a good boy for bucky. he's new, don't rush him too much," steve said, lacing his fingers through bucky's hair to yank him back. he couldn't forget how rough bucky liked everything to be, and kept that up through the whole thing.
the next morning, peter woke up way earlier than he should’ve, in his own room. sleepily, he rubbed his eyes before noticing he wasn’t in the dorm and he jolted awake.
"well, i might have an idea," steve said, and bucky turned around. "what should we do?" he asked, excited to be doing something.
bucky leaned down to kiss peter one final time before going off to play with the kids. “i love you, doll.” peter smiled, blushing lightly. “i love you too, buck.”
none of them had stretched, but they were perfectly fine bullshitting it. they were meant to kick where nat and clint's arms were, which weren't that high, but some people were falling over. peter, ned and mj were the only ones to hit every mark. "good. now we're going to take it up a notch. clinton and i will be walking backwards as you try to alternate and kick our arms. first in line."
"first, we'll be doing punches. it's very simple, hit the pads on our hands as hard as you can. when you punch, keep your thumb on the outside of your fist and a little bit out of the way. let's begin."
“one last kiss?” bucky asked sweetly. peter sighed, walking back over to kiss bucky again. “i hate you,” he mumbled. “actually, i remember you telling me you love me,” bucky smiled. “know it all. yes, i love you,” peter rolled his eyes. “i love you too, sweetheart.”
they only had two classes that day and the rest were cleared for field trip debriefing. everyone was glowing- the teachers, the students, and the other staff going to help with the trip.
"how long was i out?" peter groaned, stretching. "dinners almost done, so for about three hours?" tony replied, brushing hair out of peter's face. "oh. i'll go wash up and be right down."
tony and bucky sat on either side of peter, both loudly bragging about the new m.i.t. student. steve was holding hands with tony on top of the table, having his own conversation with sam and nat. bruce and thor were leaning in to each other, smiling more and lingering their touches. everything was right with the world.
bucky couldn't decide wether to thrust up into tony or grind himself back on steve, and it was really messing with him. "stop, stop," he whispered hoarsely. the two surrounding him completely halted all movements. "i need you both separately. please, this is a lot."
"peter! hello, kids. you're early," he said, laughing nervously. "we just wanted to get a head start, sir," ned said, smiling. "there's nothing wrong with that! i'm dr. bruce banner, and these are my and tony's labs."
“shh, shh, come back to sleep,” bucky whined from behind him. peter kissed him softly, but nudged his arm off gently. “sorry, buck. i need to shower and get back to the dorms before we go to the modules,” he explained, grabbing some clothes from his dresser. “do you really have to go?” bucky asked, reaching his hand out. peter noticed he was shirtless, and it took a lot of effort not to stare.
"not really. it's just for security. someone is going to have to escort the rest of the groups down here- someone who has voice recognition," he said, setting his hand on the fingerprint reader, typed in a code on a keypad, and then said his full name out loud before the door opened.  "that's a load of bullshit, but okay," wade replied, tagging behind everyone else as they filed in to the viewing hallways of the labs.
it was all mundane to peter who dragged himself all the way to his room and flipped on to his bed. he screamed into his pillow before someone called his name from downstairs. "coming!" he shouted, sliding off his shoes, changing into pajama pants, and grabbing his permission slip out of his book bag.
peter blushed, handing tony his plate. "i'm not just here because i'm spiderman, right?" he asked, his voice breaking a little. "oh, peter," tony said, getting up to hug him. "you are my favorite person in the whole world. ever since you were younger, even when you were a brat, you were still my favorite. i love you so much, peter," tony said, and peter wiped away a single tear.
"is this what you needed to fix?" steve asked, sitting down gently across from his boyfriend. tony groaned. "yes, partly. i was going to go over more programs with bruce when he got here later." total lie, but what was he going to do? say all he needed was to change the lightbulbs? or that he finally wanted to be taller than his boyfriend?
"how long will we be in here?" bucky asked. "bruce gets here at 7, and it's 4:30 now," tony frowned, throwing himself against a wall and sliding down.
"it's your choice, just know that you're sleeping in your own bed either way," he said, shrugging. peter looked absolutely incredulous, but everyone else had no opinion.
they made their way inside through the living quarter's door, opening up to what looked like a normal home. it was an open floor plan kitchen, dining and living room with a hall to the left that lead off to the bathroom and all of the bedrooms. on the right, there was a glass door that lead to the expansive gym. ned and mj looked around in awe.
ten years from now. they’re both aged and look as such. they have their own little apartment in brooklyn, just big enough for the two of them, their two kids, and their new puppy. they have an older girl (probably about 6) and a younger boy (about 4), and bucky is play chasing them around the house, dog not far in tow. peter sat happily on the couch, watching them all run around in circles, until bucky collapses on the couch in exhaustion leaving the kids with the dog.
"the hulk watches tv here!"
"thor and hawkeye train over there!"
steve moaned, carefully watching them quietly. bucky started to stretch tony. the only sounds in the elevator were steve and tony's moans and groans. bucky basked in the glory of what he was doing to these boys.
"are there any other questions?" tony asked, and it was dead silent. "okay, then. time to hand it over to your principal! see you tomorrow morning, future!" he exclaimed, guiding peter in to the actual compound.
everyone was in some sort of shorts and tee shirt combo, and mj's hair was pulled up into a top knot. she looked poised and very much adjusted to the environment with her long, skinny legs and her gymnastics background. everyone else looked a little out of place.
peter, ned, and mj brought all their stuff down and set in the back like everybody else, but lingered by the door alone. “this really was one of the coolest things i’ve ever done,” ned said, hand in hand with mj. “i can’t believe i got an internship with dr. hope and dr. hank. and it’s paid, which is almost unheard of,” mj said, smiling slightly.
"yes. beautiful," he said, his head rolling back onto the wall, and his hand shifting back to touch himself again. bucky smiled, looking back to tony. "you're good? no lube and no rubber?" he checked.
"hey, peter," he smiled, leaning on to the cool metal of the fridge. peter, who was sitting on the counter with his head in a cabinet, tried to pull away but bonked his head on the door and mumbled a small," hi, buck."
i’m hoping this chapter isn’t as bad as i think it is oof. ONE DAY UNTIL THE FIELD TRIP.
peter slowly made his way to his room, not noticing that bucky had followed. when he tried to shut his door behind him, bucky caught it, scaring peter, who jumped onto his wall.
bucky moaned, finally clued in as to what they were saying. "oh, fuck. i'll make you happy, steve," tony said, kissing bucky sharply. "steve?" the omniscient super soldier reprimanded. "sorry, sir," tony replied shamefully, and steve nodded in approval.
"are we gonna fuck in this elevator?" steve asked. bucky turned around, his lips wet from saliva. tony looked absolutely wrecked; his hair was all over the place, his unbuttoned shirt was untucked from his slacks, and his lips were kiss swollen and shiny.
"she's off the table," peter said, taking his water bottle, and giving him a brownie. "with who, clinton?" wade replied, making fun of clint as he ate his food. "i honestly don't know. other interns try to flirt with her and she just shuts them out, which she would never do if she was single."
”good, darling. i’ll do anything with you, too.”
sure enough, tony came strolling out of the building. everyone applauded, and he bowed, which peter laughed at.
bucky laughed, walking over to help peter down from the counter. he kissed peter softly before walking over to the fridge to get a bottle of water while peter sat down at the island. "how did your project go?" bucky asked, taking a big swig of water. peter tried not to watch bucky's throat, blushing madly and gulping himself.
steve chuckled. "which one?"
bucky pushed his hips up into tony's, his neck exposed from the hair pulling. steve rushed over, leaving kisses and hickeys all down bucky's neck.
"of course not! and just so you know, if he hurts you, he'll have a lot of enemies," tony warned, making peter laugh. "i don't think he's going to hurt me, dad, but thank you."
"i could say the same about you two," peter said, adjusting in his seat. ned and mj went bright red as they shook their heads. "jesus fuck, lighten up you guys. i don't care if you have or not," peter laughed, turning forward as soon as their teacher walked in and called for quiet attention.
"he did what?"
"i fucking hate him," mj said. "i really do. please tell mr. stark to make flash look like an asshole this weekend." peter smiled deviously. "already done, mj. already done."
they were ready by 6:30, so they decided to head to the labs early. from the looks of it, people were just now waking up, getting breakfast, or even still sleeping. peter guided his group past the rest of their class to the compound.
happy picked peter up in the usual spot, confused as to why peter couldn’t’ve just stayed at the compound. “hey, happy,” peter said, climbing in to the passenger seat with his bag at his feet. “hey, kid. how was your weekend?”
"hey, peter," bucky groaned, putting his head on to peter's toned chest. "mornin' buck. how'd you sleep?" peter asked, combing back bucky's stray hairs. "this is the best i've slept in months, doll."
"i'm proud," she said definitely, throwing him a look. "okay, okay. thank you, mj," he said, smiling a little. "you're welcome," she said, leaning her head on to ned's shoulder.
peter kind of figured he would get put with ned and mj, because of what tony had told him when he signed peter's permission slip. he, ned and mj didn't have to move as vincent and wade moved over to where they sat.
"really, we told you to stop talking," peter mumbled, making the groups laugh. steve looked extremely uncomfortable, probably because flash might've triggered him and/or because he was gay and dating peter's dad (even though nobody knew).
peter just laughed. “if you didn’t get the internship, you wouldn’t‘ve kissed ned, and then you’d never be together. it’s weird how the universe works,” he said, smirking. “did you tell hope to give me the internship?” mj demanded.
"then he's probably out to lunch with pepper and rhodey. have you called or texted him?" peter asked, and steve walked more in to the kitchen. "shit... no, i haven't called him," he cursed, leaning on the countertop.
bucky pulled away from steve to look down at tony. "look, doll," bucky said. "i can't keep leaning over to kiss you." tony frowned, but steve seemed to be catching up.
ned went into the bathroom to change as everyone else packed their day bags- water, notebooks, and pencils. nobody was going to let a single drop of information slip away.
“you’ll help me, right baby?” ned asked. “of course i will. i’d love to be the household income provider. fuck everyone who thinks i can’t,” she said, leaning against him. “let’s not do that much, sweetie.”
tony was dumbfounded and turned on all at the same time. he stood up as well, trying to squeeze himself between the two, not wanting to be left out.
the two of them strolled through the compound greens, coming to a drop off point. there were large stones jutting out, just big enough to hold peter and tony. a fast-current estuary had carved out the rocks, but had lowered over the years so that now, it only came up a few hundred feet instead of thousands. the both took a seat on the same, easily-accessible rock.
when they got to the compound, happy dropped peter off near the lab entrance. “thank you so much again, happy,” peter said, grabbing his bag and leaning down to talk. “it’s no problem, kid. see you tomorrow,” happy said. “see you tomorrow,” peter replied, closing the door. he watched as happy disappeared before heading inside. “see you tomorrow.”
they walked in silence for few seconds until mr. davis grabbed peter's arm. "are you really an intern for stark? really?" he asked, and a sense of dread ran over peter. "sir, i really don't think this is appropriate," he said, turning around to walk back to the compound. the teacher stomped over and grabbed peter's arm again, harder this time.
ned joined him at the stairs to the front door. "hey, man! how's happy?" he said, tugging on his backpack strings. "he signed my permission slip," peter smiled as they rounded to their lockers where they met mj. "hey losers. are you going to that trip to stark tower this weekend?" she asked, and peter nodded. he started shoving stuff in his locker.
after a few hours of working, peter felt successful with his language studies and bid wanda farewell. before she left, she kissed peter's cheek, and told him,"
"i hope your dad doesn't think i'm just going to break your heart," he mumbled, and peter laughed endearingly. he put a hand on bucky's cheek, smiling. "he doesn't, i promise you. we've talked," he said, kissing bucky chastely.
bucky moved fast, shifting tony's legs to around his waist. "yes sir," the soldier said, smiling. he lined himself with tony, ready to push in. "anger really does bottle up when you're angry, i guess," he said again. tony immediately went to defend himself, but before he could speak, bucky bottomed out.
it’s short, i know. this is sadly the end of the series, but be on the lookout for more works of mine. 6 MONTHS AFTER THE FIELD TRIP.
"don't do that, kid! you make me swerve!"
"i wouldn't believe you, even if i didn't know the truth," he said, starting to walk back into the woods, but peter rolled his hand out of the man's grasp and took off running around to the back of the compound where the gym entrance was. the teacher took off after him, way faster than peter thought a normal person could run.
by the time he got downstairs, everyone was at the table, and an already made plate was sat in front of where he would normally sit. he noticed thor had arrived, and wondered if that would interfere with the trip.
"oh, you're fucking serious? let's do it," peter laughed, getting up. mj followed him, leaving ned with wade on the couch watching tv. "why are you coming?" vincent asked. "i wanna see falcon, duh."
"you already have a pet name for me. ooh, i feel like a slut," tony smiled. bucky shook his head with a small grin. "you're sure this okay?" bucky looked to steve for confirmation. "swear on my life. just- kiss him already."
bucky grabbed tony's thighs like he was going to pick him up, and tony jumped into bucky's arms. bucky carried tony until the smaller was crowded into the wall. "can i kiss you?" he whispered. "fuck yes," tony said, wrapping his arms behind bucky's head.
"good morning, kids, or should i say, our future. i'd like to welcome you personally to the avengers compound, where you'll be touring, and the place where you’ll be sleeping  and eating, which is right in that building over there," he said, pointing. “i do hope we can have a good time this weekend, and i can always answer your questions whenever you have them, and i will be answering them now before i give your teachers the rooming assignments."
when bucky noticed the tears in peter's eyes, he sat down on the closet floor and pulled peter into his lap. "hey, doll, what's wrong?" he asked, and peter just sobbed into his shoulder. bucky ran his hands through the teen's hair, shushing him sweetly.
"jesus fuck, you're a great dad. you're literally the best," peter smiled, taking a bite of his food. "i'm glad you think so; i really do try," tony smiled back. they finished their food quickly and said their goodbyes as peter headed off to where he would be sleeping for the weekend.
"it's not about school, it's about you."
“you stopped playing with us to kiss daddy?” their daughter asked, then fake gagged. bucky tickled her a little, smiling as her said,” yes i did! i needed a break and i wanted to be with daddy!” she squealed with laughter, trying to get bucky to stop. “papa, play with us!” she said, pulling in his hand. he groaned and stood up. “fine princess. but you better get a head start!” he exclaimed, and both of their kids ran off with cheers, and the puppy followed, happy to be doing something again.
flash, miles and everyone else came walking in through the door, a stark industries certified tour guide led them through to bruce's care. "welcome, everyone, to stark industries' lab! i'm your guide, dr. bruce banner. save all of your questions until the end, please, where  i, tony stark, and pepper potts will be answering them. right, off we go!"
bucky was already there, in the elevator, probably going to his floor- the second floor. "aw, lovebirds," bucky smiled. "shut up, barnes," tony blushed.
“you’re so amazing with them,” peter mumbled, leaning down to kiss bucky, who was slumped on the couch. “no better than you are,” bucky smiled, kissing him deeper. “ew, papa!” their daughter shrieked, running to jump on top of bucky. their son jumped up in between him and peter, all of them laughing as the puppy tried to get up on the couch.
"whatcha making?" peter asked, trying to look over bucky's shoulder. "what's your favorite food?" bucky replied, turning on the faucet to start to wash the pans. "are you making
"turn off your fucking alarm, i'm up!" wade yelled from the sleeper sofa, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. "you don't look like it to me, fuck face," mj said, going into the bathroom to change. "never mind her. i brought food here so we can eat on the way to the module," ned said, setting a platter of croissants and brioche on the coffee table.
there was a picture of the two of them on the ellis island ferry, hugging each other as their faces were smushed together. the next one was bucky kissing peter's cheek, and then peter on the lips. the next one was bucky staring out over new york from the top of the empire state buidling, and then one of him smiling back at peter. another was a candid picture of peter at one of their picnics in central park that he didn't know existed until now. the last one, and the one that was peter's lock screen, was them at the statue of liberty, bucky picking peter up as they kissed without care.
the module lasted about two hours, and a few people were asleep by the end of it. those who weren't, though, had pages upon pages of notes of new knowledge.
when he woke up the next morning, he turned his tv off, brushed his teeth, and started to get dressed, before tony walked in to his room. "dude!" he yelled, his jeans on but his shirt in his hands. "you're fine, you're dressed. now, i have some juicy shit to tell you."
peter kissed back, but the pit in his stomach stayed for a different reason. peter pulled away slowly. "i didn't tell them yet," he whispered in to bucky's ear. "fuck, i'm sorry. i thought that was why you were here?" bucky replied. peter just laughed, moving to stand with the group.
"i thought you'd never ask."
"kissin' you is a sin, doll," bucky muttered breathlessly. "good to be of service," tony replied, arching his back slightly, also breathing heavily.
they went to do so, and only peter was the one to hit all the marks. ned didn't because he was hemming and hawing, and mj didn't because she was trying too hard. "good. now for blocking. everyone get in their groups and circle up. you'll be either punching or kicking the person next to you, and they have to block it. this is a punching block," she said, demonstrating, "and this is a kicking block," she demonstrated again. the rest of the class was a blur to peter, who thought it was unfair he was training on his day off.
"bucky, the window," he said, and bucky just smiled and laughed. "your boy is a hell of a man," bucky groaned, picking tony up again and pushing him against the glass.
8 HOURS UNTIL THE FIELD TRIP.
peter smiled, his eyes tearing up. “really?” he asked, tears starting to fall. tony wiped them away, smiling back at peter. “yes, baby,” tony replied. peter wrapped him up in a big hug, and tony kissed the side of his head. “go get your boy, peter.”
“of course not! the labs were looking for an intern and i simply sent in your resume for you,” peter explained, and mj hugged him tightly. “thank you, peter. it means a lot.”
“i love you guys,” peter said, leaning his head back against the window. “we love you too, peter,” mj smiled, patting his foot.
"it's still so cool that you get to call him tony," ned said. "well yeah, he's my dad. i actually call him dad more than i call him tony," peter smiled. all three of them burst into uncontrollable laughter, not stopping even after they were yelled at.
bucky put one hand around steve's throat, who gasped, but quickly smiled the smile he saved for certain people at certain times. bucky kisses steve harshly, taking all of his remaining breath away. "what the fuck," tony said, out of breath.
"it's just about what the allies were doing before we joined the war," peter explained, reaching in to his binder to grab a worksheet. "well, they were fighting, i guess. if we're focusing on the american part of the war, we weren't given much information until pearl harbor happened. my japenese neighbor was detained because nypd thought he would start to plan an attack on new york."
about 15 minutes later, they pulled up to midtown high. "thanks again, happy," peter smiled, stepping out of the tesla. people started to mumble and whisper, pointing at the car and 'the big dude (how the hell does peter know that guy?)' driving it. peter saluted to happy, who sped off as he strode inside.
"daring, vincent. jones, michelle. leeds, ned. parker, peter. wilson, wade."
"well i was!"
THREE DAYS UNTIL THE FIELD TRIP.
"you're adorable, peter," mj smiled, sitting up. he blushed, looking away, mumbling, "shut up." she laughed and they hugged as ned got on to the mat. "seriously though, if you get rawed by james barnes this weekend you're telling me all of it."
peter dragged himself up the stairs, ready to start his homework. "hey, peter," wanda called from behind him. he turned to look at her, but she was already in front of him, opening the door to his room. "what's taking you so long?" he laughed, running up the rest of the way.
"well, if i sign it, i can make sure ned and mj can stay in your room with you, and if i don't sign it... well, you'll just have to hide a lot and stay in our part of the compound. no lab time, just watching tv and stuff," tony said, passing the permission slip around.
peter sat speechless. "really?"
"ya lyublyu tebya. vy oba imeyete v vidu mir dlya menya," bucky said, punctuated by kisses across tony's jawline. "you both me the world to me," he repeated himself in english, his voice crooning like the 40's again. "yebat' menya," he moaned, thrusting his hips against tony's.
"oh, definitely. but wouldn't he be doing things to you? like taking you in an elevator while i watch? wouldn't you make me happy?" steve replied, rocking his hips up into bucky's again.
"bye, you two," peter waved, turning around to walk back to the compound. he smiled to himself, happy that hope had given him the opportunity to see bucky privately.
"as hard as it is to admit, i think i'm bisexual too," bucky said, leaning up against the power rack he was just exercising on. "welcome to the everybody-in-my-goddamned-house-is-gay club," peter smiled. bucky laughed, doubling over.
"just here to see my favorite super soldier! and to get help on my world war two project," peter smiled. bucky laughed. "what do you need help with? i wasn't exactly me for the last bit of it, but i can help you," he said, waving peter over. peter moved quickly, sitting down on the bench press that was across from the power rack.
“coming!”
"there he is! fucking ask him, peter!" lillian whisper-yelled. "hey, buck. i have a question for you," peter said sheepishly. with a small smile, bucky nodded in the way peter knew meant continue. "am i your favorite person here?"
mj, ned, and peter stopped at hope's desk before they left; vincent and wade were leaning up against the door talking. flash's and miles' groups had already left. "you wanted to see me?" mj asked, stuffing her notebook in her "marie curie wouldn't treat me this way" bag. "i like your bag," hank pointed, making her blush. "thank you, sir. my mom gave it to me."
peter ripped back the covers to see, gratefully, he had pajama shorts on, so they probably hadn't done anything last night. he let out a sigh of relief before a couple of light bruises caught his eye. there was a set from bucky's hands on his hips and a set on his thighs from that same man's too-good mouth.
"iron man eats here!"
bucky whipped around, going to rip into steve. "what do you think you're doing?" he asked, his hands off of tony, who was holding on to him, kissing him, and touching him all over.
peter smiled at his friends, extremely happy for them. “i’m glad you both got something this weekend,” he said, nodding. “oh, did you do anything with bucky?” mj asked, letting go of ned’s hand as he went to get a drink.
"black window makes food here!"
"and then he fucking kissed me!" peter, whisper shouted, trying to get his point across to ned. they were in study block, but they weren't doing very much studying. rather, they were talking about yesterday while peter copied all of ned's notes for the history project.
"anytime, doll," he kissed tony softly. steve wanted to say something, but knew he would be punished again if he did. bucky turned around, sympathetically reaching out to touch his cheek. "you can say something, if you want," he offered.
peter just wiped sweat off of his forehead and sat down at his desk in his home room. the teachers were about to break them in to groups, and then give them their assigned everything (room, quarter, and teacher). honestly, he just wanted to nap.
"beauregard, emily. harwood, lillian. james, corey. maramount, jennifer. thompson, eugene."
"i'm sorry about how i acted inside," peter said softly. tony rubbed his back. "it's not a problem, peter. i'm sorry about how i acted. i'm supposed to be your dad, and sometimes i feel like i'm more so your best friend in the way i talk to you."
“ahem, is this thing on? oh, yeah, okay. to all of you students here right now- you’re here for a reason. you worked hard, you got into the academy, you kept your grades up, and you had  the will to keep going. the one thing i didn’t have when i was your age? your perseverance. as embarrassing as it is to say, i was ready to throw my life away, even after taking over stark industries. you have the power to create new and exciting things, simply because you want to. i’m going to go ahead and jumpstart that process by offering all of you the cost of your tuition at any technological university you get in to. i’m going to pay every single penny for you to get your education and give back to society. thank you for joining us this weekend, and i hope you enjoy college!”
tony stood at a whopping 5'7. he wanted to be taller, like his boyfriend, and his boyfriend's closest friend. he had just the idea.
"that was so hot," bucky mumbled, taking a sip of his water. peter kissed him. "i was just being matter of fact," he shrugged. "be matter of fact more often," bucky said, getting up to recycle his water bottle and started to pull pots and pans out of the cabinet.
tony smirked in peter's direction. "he did, did he? well, if i'm being completely honest, i think he'd be an amazing fit for you, baby." peter smiled, hugging tony, lifting him off of the ground a little. "thank you, dad!" peter exclaimed. "i thought you were lying to make me feel better earlier."
"i'm sorry, what?" happy said, taking his hands off the wheel as he faced peter. peter almost had a heart attack until he remembered that after the last incident, tony made happy take the self-driving tesla.
the teachers were in awe as they loaded the teens up on the buses, ready to go home. everyone was talking about how amazing tony was and how cool it was that even after having a private expo for them, he offered to pay all of their school expenses.
"i think you should kiss tony," steve said in a flat voice. "i shoul- what? you want me to kiss your boyfriend?" bucky exclaimed.
the end of the school day couldn't come soon enough, even if peter was going back to his delusional family. he still loved them, after all, and he appreciated that they all opened their home up to a bunch of seniors for a weekend expo.
“peter! dinner’s ready!”
"shut the hell up," bucky mumbled, pulling away from steve. he only let go of the hold on steve's neck after he had agreed. bucky walked back over to tony, who was still watching his boyfriend gasp for air, licking his lips in bucky's direction.
"why did you take you hands off of him?" steve challenged right back. bucky pushes tony off to charge up into the blonde's face. "are you questioning me?" bucky roared, and tony felt dread. he hoped steve wouldn't open his fat mouth right now-," well, what are you going to do about it, asshole?"
he made around in time, but the door was locked, and thor was exercising with music blasting through the speakers. peter banged on the door, but to no avail. he could hear the teacher curving around the building, so he just decided to bust the door open.
steve dressed himself, then tony, and watched bucky help himself. "what are we going to do for the next," bucky checked tony's watch," half hour?"
"uh, tony?" steve asked. "sorry, i don't know what got into me," he said, trying to reverse what he did. he frantically pushed the red button over and over again, trying to reverse it, but to no avail.
peter started to get up, too embarrassed and flustered to look bucky in the eye. bucky grabbed his arm and pulled him back down on to the bench lightly. "i'm sorry, peter. i don't know what came over me, i-." peter kissed him lightly once more before he grabbed his book bag and rushed off to his room.
"so angry. i think it bottles up faster when you're short," bucky teased light heartedly. tony frowned, causing the two soldiers to laugh.
"i'm sorry," he said, laughing away his crying voice. "don't be, baby. you'll always have self doubt, and that's what i'm here for. i will always be there for you," tony said.
hoards of peter's very distant acquaintances stood outside of the grounds of his not-home (for the weekend, of course). all of the teachers were at the front, talking amongst themselves, probably waiting for tony to kick the event off.
tony cut him short. "you're not gonna do anything. barnes, with me. now," he said, pointing to bucky, and then out of the door before he started to leave himself.
"woah woah woah," peter said, putting his hands up. "i haven't fucked bucky and he's not my official boyfriend." mj rolled her eyes. "he's fucked bucky," she said. "too much tension for them to have not've," ned nodded.
peter shrugged and pulled the leftovers from him and bucky's dinner out of the fridge to heat up. "is that cassoulet?" tony asked, cocking an eyebrow. peter hummed, turning on the microwave. "who made you cassoulet?" tony asked. "bucky," the teen mumbled.
his project was about the inequality of lgbt people during ww2, and even though he went to a somewhat welcoming school, some of the kids in his class were definitely not going to like his presentation.
"yeah, pete. you're fucked," clint said, his mouth full of both of the dishes made for dinner. "manners, clint. manners," thor said, shoving a whole golubtsy in his mouth.
"good afternoon class, my name is natalia. this is clinton. today we're going to teach you a little bit of self defense and how to keep yourself safe, especially in times like these," she said. her hair was sharply and freshly chopped to her jawline, dyed back to her natural red. she was wearing a leotard, tights, and pointe shoes. clint was wearing a tank top and sweatpants.
peter didn't usually mind school, unless it involved his family. the accords, the captain america videos, and most everything people talked about was his family. come to think of it, peter hated school.
they both looked so beautiful with those age-defying eye wrinkles and smile lines, their hair perfectly poised, jarringly handsome faces smiling their sterling white smiles. tony hit the red fire button, and the elevator stopped.
"hey, baby," peter heard, feeling bucky's metal arm slide down and mess with his hair. "why are you still up?" he asked, kissing peter's head. "the teacher. is he gone?" peter asked stiffly, unmoving.
, both romanian dishes bucky and steve learned from bucky's mother.
"i don't know about you, but i liked it," bucky shrugged. peter smiled at the ground, and then up at bucky. "yeah, i really liked it," he said biting his lip. bucky leaned in slowly, but this time, peter didn't wait. he put his hands in bucky's hair and pulled him in to a searing hot kiss.
"peter?"
"you're not in trouble, michelle. i want to offer you an internship position to you," hope said, smiling. mj's jaw dropped. "you what?" she asked, grabbing ned's arm for support. "yes, sweetie. a paid internship. we could use someone like you on our team," she said, handing mj a card. "can i just get your email and phone number?"
"i still think i'm falcon's favorite," mj shrugged. "i think i'm the winter soldier's favorite," lillian swooned. "he intercepted after me, i think i'm his favorite," vincent pouted, throwing himself on to the pull out bed next to wade. peter just snorted.
when peter got home from school, he threw his book bag down by the gym door and started to rummage for a snack. he was so hungry and determined he didn't notice bucky come in from the gym, shirtless and sweaty.
module three was quantum physics with dr.s hope van dyne and hank pym, and their "test dummy", scott lang. peter really missed them, as he barely got to see his estranged family (affectionately dubbed auntie hope, uncle scotty, and poppa hank, of course) and was really excited for this module, as he really needed to brush up on this subject and there were no better teachers than these three.
"take me slowly," tony said. "take me slowly, gently, and make sure he can see." bucky didn't have to be told twice as he laid tony down. he caged himself over the genius, looking at steve. "can you see?"
flash looked a little bit nervous for a second; after all, bucky's name was still synonymous with jfk's assassination and most of the public still thought the winter soldier bombed the un building. flash's cool demeanor returned, and his smug smirk came back. "james barnes? he chauffeurs now? or you're just a worse liar than i thought...?" flash laughed, walking off to his table of friends.
"always," tony panted, biting his lip. "you've done this before, haven't you?" bucky asked, grinding back on steve. the only responses he got were moans, and he chuckled. "little kinky bastards."
peter slid in to the front seat, smiling. "hi, happy," he said, buckling up. "you're late," happy grumbled, taking off down the wooded path to the main road. all of the sudden, peter got an amazing idea and he gasped.
he swatted her arm, but she shrugged. “it’s true. you guys were flirting. think about all the babies you could have with bucky!” peter made an incredulous face, even if mj couldn’t see it. “we haven’t even had sex yet, in any way, shape, or form, so i don’t know why you’re talking about children,” he whisper yelled. “i’m just planting ideas,” she said, nuzzling in to his shoulder one final time before she pulled away.
ned, mj and peter lulled behind everyone on the dark greens in between the compound and the residence area. "so, you kissed james barnes today?" ned asked. peter chuckled, messing with his hair. "yes, i did, ned. you and mj kissed, too," he said. "you need to talk about that."
bucky got the nerve to kiss peter, lips colliding in a gentle mush. peter moved his hands to bucky's jaw, feeling the sharp contour lines beneath his fingers. they kissed for what felt like a lifetime, until they both (more so peter) ran out of breath.
"so, who's this she?" mj repeated, opening up some sort of breakfast sandwich. "it's nobody, i promise," ned said, taking a bite out of his hash brown. peter took a sip of the coffee, then started to pick out his food. "it's not nobody, she just doesn't go here. why, are you jealous?" he asked, starting to eat his sandwich.
i’m so sorry this is so short! i was on vacation and i bridged as much as possible! ❤️ TWO DAYS UNTIL THE FIELD TRIP.
wade turned back around, pulling out his phone. the rest of the names were being called off of the list, but peter didn’t really care. he had finally come to the realization that he didn’t really need flash or anyone to believe he worked for tony- being a superhero was reward enough, even if nobody knew about it.
"i go by flash," he growled out, getting up to move with his group. lillian reached over to pat his shoulder. "it's okay, eugene," she smiled, sitting back down. he yelled in frustration.
“pretty good, how about you?” peter asked, but happy just took off down the street without replying. “oh, sorry, i forgot you can’t say anything. well, i still hope it was a good one.”
"he's probably asleep, son. you should be, too. i'll walk you back to your room," a teacher said, but peter had never met him. he was a new freshman teacher, so peter had no idea why they accepted his request to come along, but here he was. "okay, thank you," peter said, a little suspicious. the teacher opened the door, and peter thanked him again.
"god damn i love you," steve muttered, palming himself through his sweatpants. tony made a noise similar to a cry, pulling on bucky's hair.
peter thanked happy for the ride home and stepped out of the car. he decided to go up the back path to the gym where bucky would most likely be, partly because he was one of peter's best friends and partly because he needed help on one of his history assignments.
sam came out of the lab and in to the lobby, groaning, thinking there was another group until he saw peter and mj. "hey, cool girl! you're the best," sam said, stretching his hand out for a fist bump. "mj," she said, introducing herself. "sam," he replied, impressed. "told you i was his fucking favorite."
steve and tony immediately rushed to the gym, leaving peter behind without a second thought. the teen wandered about until he landed on the sofa, laying down, but refusing to go to sleep until the guy was successfully in fury's arms.
"no thanks, friday. just here for my field trip," he cut her off, worried she would out him as tony's son. "no need to be rude, peter. i'll send you to bruce."
"b-bucky... i'm gonna... i'm gonna...," tony whimpered. "go on, you have permission," he said, bracing himself for his own climax. when tony came, steve took a picture; it was tony, head against the glass that was steamed over from his body heat, bucky holding him close, and the purple-hued sky in the back, making every sweaty body look magical.
they walked to class together, the whispering not stopping. "why are they talking about you today?" mj asked, sitting down in her seat, turning around to face the boys. "happy started using the tesla," ned said excitedly.
steve stood up, only a little bit shorter than bucky, who had to lean way down to kiss tony. "i don't see why not," he shrugged, kissing bucky hungrily. he left no room for exploration- everything was done beforehand.
"well, we're not all that bad. you guys don't really think i'm lying about the stark internship, do you?" peter asked, trying to start a conversation. vincent shook his head, but wade turned around again, his expression level and uncaring. "look, bud. i didn't want to get placed with you for this very reason. you don't need my approval if it's really true, okay? and i couldn't give a rat's ass if you worked for tony stark."
he and his group trudged back in tired silence. they weren't too far from the building, which was great, because they all were on a strict schedule, especially this weekend. their first module was with bruce in the labs at seven, meaning they had to be up at six, dressed and ready at 6:30, and have already eaten by the time they needed to be in the main compound. needless to say, once they got back to their room, they crashed in their day clothes.
"no, no, what? you kissed james buchanan barnes? the winter soldier? are you crazy?" mj asked, and peter laughed. "bucky barnes is not the winter soldier, first of all. that was his body, but not his brain. second of all, he's an amazing, sweet guy and yes, i did kiss him. twice," he said, finishing his breakfast before crinkling up the wrapper to throw it back in the bag.
"you didn't tell me the twice part!" ned said, and peter just sipped the coffee. "are you a thing now?" mj asked. "no. actually, after i kissed him, i ran. tony told me that i should go for him, though."
everyone took turns punching nat and clint's hands, a little bit bored of what they were doing. "now, kicks," natasha said, demonstrating with a high kick way above her head. "i assume you stretched before this. first person up."
"if you want," bucky smiled charmingly at steve, his voice husky. "yes," tony answered, his response cut short by him pulling bucky's head to face him again, kissing bucky deeply.
"we can't just reschedule... we'll never find time. tell you what- i'll just sneak out after dark and we can go then. is ten o'clock an okay time to eat dinner?" peter asked. bucky placed a long kiss on his jaw. "no, that's very late, doll. you'll have already eaten dinner and i'll have already made dinner for everyone else, even if i haven't eaten. i'll just pull you away from some things, make you mine, et cetera. deal?"
he handed peter the signed permission slip, but kept the pen. peter jumped to give happy a hug, who hugged back reluctantly. "it's really no problem, kid," happy said, taking back control of the car.
steve backed up, pushing himself against the wall dramatically, thrusting up into his own hand. "have fun," he said, biting his lip. tony resumed what he started, only to be pulled up by his hair.
happy drove them all home, picking up cook out for everyone, including himself. when they got to the compound, all three of them thanked him profusely, and for the first time in his whole life, peter was sure happy was smiling a little.
"dr. banner, these are my friends ned leeds, michelle jones, wade wilson, and vincent daring." they all nodded and said their versions of nice to meet you, shaking bruce's hand. "nice to meet you all too. do you know who else is coming?"
it was the same picture as before, except bucky had screen shotted it and wrote over it in red "i love you so much". peter smiled so brightly, holding the phone to his face, almost as if he could feel bucky's warmth from the phone.
peter's spidey senses were tingling, but he gestured for bucky to sit anyways. there was a very awkward silence; the two staring off in to space, or anywhere but each other, really. "we kissed," bucky finally said. "yeah, we did."
"i went to ask him for help with history homework, and he kind of did, in a way. then we were joking around, and- and- he kissed me, and i kissed him, and we were kissing, and it was my first kiss, and i loved it. and then we stopped and then he looked upset so kissed him for what i assume would be the last time and i ran and now i don't know how i feel or how he feels, but i really hope he likes me because dad, i think i'm falling in love with bucky barnes."
"you're both so amazing. doing this? here? now? god, you must love each other a lot," bucky said, massaging the man in front of him's back gently, making sure not to hurt him. "i do. but i think we also love someone else. the same person, and we don't know what to do with him," tony replied, his tone asking steve indirectly for a response. he really hoped it wasn't as controversial as he thought it was.
"in the elevator, can you lift me up? i have to fix something," tony replied. "yes, if it's on the ground floor. don't need you getting hurt," steve smiled, grabbing tony's hand to walk into the elevator.
school had since ended, and it was time to start packing up for college. m.i.t. isn't as close as midtown high. tony had already bought an apartment big enough for him and a guest, or guests (ned and mj insisted on staying at least once a week) in boston.
"could you sign my permission slip, happy?"
"i need you to understand something, peter. i don't want anyone but you. if i wanted nat or clint, i would've asked out nat or clint. if i loved them, i would've been telling them that. but i come home to you, i want you, and i love you, peter stark. i won't ever leave you, and i hope you never leave me."
the bus ride over to the compound was uneventful, aside from the "flirting" vincent was doing. peter didn't really believe mj, but he kind of just wanted to stop him and tell him he was seeing someone.
the labs were set up into a grid of 6, each taking up almost 10 acres of land. there was one long, main hallway, which stemmed into 4 other hallways, making it easier to view what was going on inside. there were also mini, single-file hallways that cut through each lab, meant for up close educational trips like these.
"quantum physics is when you can't relate minuscule things to a definite point. classical mechanics is how things move at everyday sizes and definable points, which uses all of newton's law," she said, going back to doodling. "that was the only fully correct answer we've gotten today. please come see me before you leave," hope said, letting hank start on the next part- the lecturing and demonstrating on scott.
"captain america shits in here!"
peter woke up the next morning in the arms of his... boyfriend?... which was weird, because the last thing he remembered was a very harsh kiss up against his bedroom door before bucky opened it to pull peter in so he could kiss him deeper and harder.
“no, sir. he said he was a freshman teacher,” peter explained. “thank you, peter,” fury said, turning around to walk out of his room, steve and tony in tow. “one last thing- use protection. the last thing we need is for you to have stds.”
"of course."
"well, hype me up, pete," wade smiled, pushing him playfully. peter laughed loudly. "she would never date a high school guy. trust me, i tried," peter said.
ned and mj started a conversation with vincent and wade so peter could talk to bruce. "what the fuck, brucie?" peter said. (it was a stupid name, he knew, but it was the name tony fed to bruce when he was adopted as a little kid).
after they got to the school, everyone said their goodbyes and rushed to their cars, eager to get home and tell their parents about the weekend.
"i've been busy! i told pepper to tell you!" tony exclaimed, and peter sighed. "i forgot none of you had normal lives," he hissed, excusing himself to clear his plate. everyone was cautious to speak until he left.
bucky flat out laughed, as in doubled over laughter. "favorite person here?" bucky replied. a pit formed in peter's stomach and lillian looked hopeful. "you're my favorite person ever," he said, pulling peter in for a kiss.
he started to move his boxes downstairs as per his web shooters, when all of the sudden he felt a weight fall through his throat and settle in to his stomach. he had a sudden realization that most relationships don't last through college or even make it untill then. him and bucky were going to break up.
"shh, sweetheart. it's okay," bucky mumbled, but the young genius just kept crying. "i'm sorry, i'm so fucking sorry," peter said, his voice shaky. "don't pity me anymore, buck. if you're done, i'll be okay, i-."
“i can’t believe that this weekend even happened,” mj stated, shaking her head. her and ned were in the seat across from peter. “i mean honestly, i’ll earn all my money at the internship and i won’t even have to pay for school. what more could i ask for?”
"we really don't-."
the next day at school was interesting, to say the least. it was thursday, and everyone was buzzing with excitement about the trip. even ned and mj, who had been to peter's house, were freaking out. peter was the only one who wasn't, and everyone was starting to become suspicious.
tony smirked a little, then went to give peter a hug. "that's my boy," he said, clapping peter's back. peter laughed a little, smiling again. "thanks dad. we're gonna-."
it was like hell to peter. he would have to stay in his own room, talk with his uncle subjectively about projects he designed, and not be able to have any down time in his private part of the lab, all for the sake of not outing that he was peter stark now. not even his teachers knew that he was tony's adoptee.
"bring him up- stand up and do it there... against the sun," steve said. bucky stopped, still in tony, and cradled him. he stood up, back to the window so the sun would be setting behind them, and continued his thrusts, slowly gaining speed.
and then he was gone. peter sat back down on his bed, head in his hands. bucky was laughing his ass off. “i’ll never live this down. they will never let me live this down,” peter said to himself, standing back up and hurriedly gathered his clothes again.
"bucky, please," tony managed. bucky was going a little too slow, and tony did not appreciate it. "i'm taking my time, doll. unless it's not what you want?" the tallest hummed, pulling away completely. tony whined.
bucky started to stir, but peter gently rubbed his head. this was peter's allotted "phone time" before school so that he could slowly wake up and catch up on his homework or things he may have missed in his friend's lives.
"my life is going to be awful now," peter groaned, making his way through the lab monitoring hallways behind tony. "i thought i made it better! no more teasing!" he said, typing in a secret code to unlock a door that opened in to their living room. "no, but they're going to try and be my friend so they can meet all of the avengers. no offense, but you know you're a bunch of showy whores, right?"
bucky put his hands on peter's hips, peter puts his hands around bucky's neck, and they made out for a while. peter even climbed in to bucky's lap. all of the sudden, tony barged in, making peter jump off of bucky's lap as fast as he could, and onto the wall, apparently.
both lillian and vincent "oh"-ed before returning to their other conversations. "look at you, coming out to all these people!" mj said, smiling. "it's not exactly like i'm hiding it," peter laughed, starting to eat his food. "still, it's not that easy for other people, peter. i'm proud of you."
"time to go!" peter yelled, and they both jumped away. everyone started to walk towards the door, but peter was the last out and signed i love you in asl to the three of them, who signed it back.
before class, everyone settled into their home room before their teacher got there. "he's just nervous that we're going to talk to stark and he's going to say he's never even seen him before!" flash said, sitting on the teacher's desk. "no, he's not nervous because he's already been there, right, peter?" ned asked, and peter nodded. "mr. stark said i was his favorite intern," he shrugged.
"i thought you were gay?" lillian asked, giving someone else her dinner. "what?" peter asked. "you kissed james barnes. you're not gay?" vincent asked. "how the fuck was i not there?" ned exclaimed. "i'm bisexual. i like boys and girls," peter explained. "gay is a spectrum."
all of the boxes sat at the bottom of the stairs as peter curled himself into a corner of his closet. he pulled out his phone, scrolling through pictures of him and bucky throughout the year.
so, bucky and peter ate their last family meal (chicken with thor's special mango sauce and bruce's mashed potatoes, peter's favorite) at the compound, holding hands and smiling as bright as the sun. everyone was there, including hope, scott, hank, ned, and mj.
“good morning, everyone. i’m maria hill, this is phil coulson, and this is thor, god of thunder,” she announced, waving to everyone. she pressed the clicker in her hand in the direction of the power point behind her. “today we’ll be talking about careers in domestic and international security, and how you can get involved today.”
"got a rubber?" bucky mumbled, asking the vague question to anyone in the elevator. "don't care enough for one. no lube is fine too," the genius said, breathing heavily. "just take me."
tony's head hit the floor with a thud, eyes rolling back with it. steve moved over to place his hands there like a pillow, leaning down to kiss tony himself. bucky started to move, and tony made a small noise.
their teacher came in, demanding silence. after a short pause, he asked for the permission slips to be passed up to the front before their lecture began.
about half of the hands shot up, and tony looked a little overwhelmed. "you, yes you, in the yellow," he nodded, as he nonchalantly handed papers to the principal. "do you really know peter parker?" a girl asked. everyone was staring intently at tony, who was even more overwhelmed. "yes, i do know him. he's an intern of mine, he does a great job and works very hard. why?"
. anything for you," bucky smiled, giving peter a big hug. "
his super soldier boyfriend was 6'2, and his super soldier boyfriend's best friend (who also just so happened to be a super soldier too) was 6'3.
peter strolled in to the lab's main lobby, hoping to sneak through the main hall to the house, but all of his teachers were standing around, talking. "how can we help you, peter?" one of the art teachers asked. "i was just hoping to talk to mr. stark," he said awkwardly.
"are you fucking serious? if you sign, everyone will know you're my legal guardian! if you don't sign, they'll make me seem like i have been lying about the stupid stark internship thing! and, if they catch me, i'm fucked!" he exclaimed, trying to gain traction with what he could see happening. "peter's right, but you have no other choice,
"we have to- steve has to- fuck, again," tony stammered. "all in good time, doll. let's get us cleaned up first, hm?" bucky smiled, reaching for his underwear. he cleaned tony up, throwing his underwear in a corner to grab tony's clothes.
"so we just sit here for the next few hours? what are we going to do?" bucky asked, his arms flailing up as he turned around, but he crossed them.
"you're a godsend, parker. a godsend. don't you need to be getting ready for school?" bucky asked. peter sat up on the edge of the bed, and bucky curled himself around peter's back. "is your field trip this weekend?"
"you don't even know the whole slew of things this little genius is into. or should i say... little bitch," steve said, hissing the last bit towards tony, who moaned again, arching into bucky. bucky nodded absent-mindedly, smiling that dumb smirk tony found extremely endearing at him, caressing the muscles of tony's back.
by lunchtime, everyone was pretty much exhausted. they were all sitting back in their rooms, as they had an hour and half break and none of them really ate lunch anyways.
peter jumped on to the ceiling, but slowly lowered himself when he saw fury. the man was intimidating, and peter had only met him twice before. the impression he was making was not a good one.
steve shook his head. "no, but thank you, peter. i was just wondering if dum-e was supposed to be doing things to the suit or not," he said. "for future reference, bruce and i are also heads of the lab and we can answer all of your questions," peter smiled, taking another bite of his apple. "o-oh, okay," steve said, walking out of the kitchen and into his room.
"here's one. what's it like to work in the tower?" mj said loudly. "glad to answer,  sweetie," sam said, still chuckling.
“yeah, thanks man. i’ve got free tuition and a sugar momma,” ned joked, and mj just smiled and kissed him.
the first module was very uneventful, which was good, because the second one was anything but. the panel was bucky, steve, and sam, simply to provide knowledge about what the teens could with technology for the military. in fact, there was a military recruitment area set up in the back of the room.
he especially hated it when he got a field trip form sent home with him for a trip to his own goddamned house- the avengers compound in upstate new york. the whole of his school's science academy would be going for a weekend to see the stark labs, have discussions with bruce banner and tony stark, and sit in at unimportant company meetings as sub-interns. they would also be staying in the hotel-like residential area of the compound with full catering from a private company, all expenses paid as per stark industries.
"well, good luck with that," peter smiled, standing in front of his dad. tony smiled brightly, putting his hands on the sides of peter's head, kissing his crown gently. "you're such a good person. i love you, peter. thank you for putting up with my shit," tony smiled.
"hey, we've talked about this. m.i.t. won't even-."
it only took a couple of hours to complete the project, which was good because it was due tomorrow and tony told peter that ned and mj couldn't stay for dinner.
for dinner?" peter asked excitedly. "of course,
"steve, babe. could you help me with something?" tony called with the voice he knew would get him anything from steve.
"your house is so cool. your family is so cool," ned said, closing peter's door behind him. "yeah, most people think so. being a normal human being in house with them can be the worst," peter said, sitting at his desk.
