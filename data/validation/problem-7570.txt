.  As if there was nothing more important than an omega who could keep house and have kids."  Bucky's voice was surprisingly bitter and heartfelt. Pietro didn't speak, unwilling to break the spell; it was rare for Bucky to speak this lucidly about his past.  "...as if I couldn't love him, even though he was sick and small. Yeah, he wasn't perfect. No one's perfect. That's not why I did it, to have kids or anything like that.  I knew he couldn't. I knew he was always gonna be sick. I did it 'cause I loved him. And he loved me. And maybe I was a fool for thinking it, but... whenever I came home and I saw him smile, I always thought that that was enough."  Bucky looked back up at the television, where Steve was smiling; they were replaying the final clip from his video.
to...if Bucky is with Karpov then I wouldn't even know where to start." Steve sighed and rubbed at his temple.
Donner had never said a thing to Steve or George, but George had talked to Steve over the phone about how strange it was that Donner never talked about going home.  Just "back to Giddy." He did not seem to have any personal effects at all. If he owned anything, anyway, it was probably long gone, thrown out by Gideon.
Tony's fingers were rough and warm in his hair. It made him shiver as he tugged against his hair lightly. Steve still didn't speak. He just savoured the feeling of Tony's fingers in his hair, stroking gently. He didn't have words for this moment- he just knew Tony was going to be okay. That was all that mattered.
"'Course it doesn't really seem like Barnes is capable of any sort of... real relationship," added Clint after a moment.  "It's one thing to have two Alphas, but like you said, I doubt Barnes is capable of any sort of consent. Who knows what's going on in there?  Who knows what he's even thinking?"
.  Steve made him feel like he was on the right track.
Sam appeared behind her with a more lethal type of gun in his hands. "Steve wouldn't want you to fight us. We're his friends. Step down, soldier. And step away from Steve Rogers."
"We both know that if you go visit him then you won't come back," Steve said gravely, his voice a little thick. Donner didn't deny or confirm what he said.
Donner pulled his shirt down.  Tony threw back his whiskey with a grumble.
"Code that is coded to identify human emotions," pointed out JARVIS.  "Shall I call Colonel Rhodes now?"
Howard smelled the aggression and turned to look at him.  After a beat, he said, "Son, go put a shirt on."  He turned back to Steve, examining him.  "...where do I know you from..." he murmured softly, eyeing Steve.
But Tony didn't want to risk getting kicked out of the bed, or Steve pushing him away.  Or, perhaps worst of all, Steve being mad at him.  He wanted Steve so badly it ached, physically and emotionally; Steve's love and approval meant
Tears threatened to well up in Steve's eyes.
"I wasn't in the same class as Ty.  He's about two years older than me," said Rex.  "Oh, but Waffles, I knew him at Pine Hills! Back then his name was Stan.  You should talk to him, too. He only got a partial arvicolinectomy and I hear he's doing really well."  Rex smiled, clearly happy for Waffles. "They closed down halfway through his, uh,
He pulled Steve into his mouth, sucking noisily, playing his tongue over Steve's skin, one steadying hand still on Steve's smooth, pale thigh.  He reached between Steve's legs with his other hand to stroke his entrance gently; Steve's hole twitched in response, already wet. Tony could smell his mate's arousal and the smell alone was getting him off.  This was something that he'd never quite experienced with betas, the sort of maddening hands-off arousal that came from pheromones.
is!" snapped Tony, gesturing around.  "I'm an aerospace engineer, not a fuckin' deacon, I don't know how the hell to get out of here, I don't even
and then hung up, promising she'd call back with news about
more.
"Okay. I'm glad your suit is working better but you really do need to work on your health and safety Tony," Steve with a fond sigh. If Tony was happy, then he was happy, but he didn't like the thought of a dozen pieces of metal all flying at Tony from ten different directions which no real protection in place. The helmet to the back of the head was a clear example of said fact.
"You knew which ones were Stark, because they sounded like--"  The omega whistled. The girl picked it up.
Tony decided to ignore that and focus on Steve's last statement.  "Sure. I want you in the bed. But you don't have to, okay? Steve, I'm always gonna want you.  The one time I thought I didn't, in January... that was a mistake. I don't know what it's like for you.  But for me, your scent, it... kind of makes me crazy, you know? I'll always want you in the bed."
The boys prepare for their first mission together, and HYDRA explores the possibility of bond exploitation.
He let his eyes slip shut. Steve exhaled slowly.
They focused instead on reassuring the public that everyone was safe and that they were cooperating with the government to make sure the gunmen were brought to justice and that another unprovoked terror attack would never, ever happen again.
"You probably should," Steve agreed. "They don't like me walking around by myself, do they? Seems to make them all terribly uncomfortable... you really wanna drink now? They're gonna give you free drinks all night Tony, and you gotta win poker, remember?"
"I never kid," said Tony gravely.  Aria rolled her eyes again.
"...what, 'cause I'm wearing a collar?"
Aria had already gotten several offers.  Banksy had, true to his word, put her in contact with the four omegas who ran SA.  Danielle McDavid an Remi St. Laurent were in Montreal at some summit or conference, but the other two, Tiberius Stone and Wendy Germaine, had both sent her schedules and offered to go out to dinner with Steve to talk business.  With Tony and Steve's one-year anniversary coming up in less than half a year, she and Pepper had both been working on setting up the charity dinner and auction Tony had suggested months ago. (Pepper, for one, was sick of all the damn orchids filling the house.)
decision.  Tony felt invincible and he loved it.
He raised a hand and traced the rime of the arc reactor with his fingertips before his long fingers dipped lower into the definition of Tony's abdomen muscles. Steve smiled when he felt his Alpha respond to the touch. "You know..." His blue eyes flickered down and then back up to his Alpha's face again. "I can hold my breath for over two minutes," Steve told him, tone wickedly innocent as his fingertips continued to draw small, teasing circles on Tony's lower stomach. "
" Steve said quietly and his eyes glazed over with a strange sense of fury. Maybe if it had been done by Bucky and only Bucky, it would have been different (Steve would certainly be more angry at
"The '94 case?" repeated Tony.  His brain reeled back to '94, what the hell had he been doing in '94?  He would have been 24, which meant he was probably snorting cocaine and having orgies and crashing Lamborghinis into the fountains in front of Caesar's Palace.
"Whoa, man, who's that?" she asked.
...jerk.
"Steve, when the war's over, when we go back home, I swear, I'm gonna treat you different.  I swear. I didn't want to hurt you, Steve, you understand that, right? I was a jerk. I know I was a jerk.  I tried my best. But I'm gonna do better now."
"So, yeah, they told me not to make this about status but I am so--" Steve got choked up, then shrugged, then grinned sheepishly. The crowd laughed softly. "Omegas fucking rule! And... and respect everybody!"
it if you could introduce me to Tony... do you guys ever have threesomes?"
"Do... do we know how much we've raised?" Steve asked as Aria lead him away from the stage.
"They're not random!  I've slept with two of them!  And maybe Christina!" Tony turned around.  "Christina, have we slept together?"
The two men from the balcony had entered, the glass crunching beneath their boots, and suddenly the room seemed overly crowded.  Both were in tactical gear, military-style berets on their heads, their bodies bristling with weapons and spare ammo, and there we no doubt in Steve's mind that anything that could be made into Kevlar probably was.
"Or people can't be bothered with him. He's a small fish," Natasha pointed out. "And if SHIELD let a double agent into Cap's house...that looks bad on them."
of us stay with George and Kerry."
Steve turned the page and Tony felt briefly confused.  He was standing there, grinning, holding a loaf of bread.
Tony wrapped his arms around his omega, drawing their bodies closer, and buried his face into Steve's collarbone to huff his scent.  He wiggled his hips, prodding, feeling the resistance. Then he felt it give and he sheathed his length up to the knot with a deep moan, punctuated with a breathless laugh.
God, the things he wanted to do to Steve.  He wanted to mate him, wanted to knot him, wanted to plow him until both of them were exhausted, sweaty messes and Steve was filled with his seed... the thoughts circling through his head were ones that made Tony feel deeply uncomfortable but also ridiculously aroused... "Please..." he found himself begging.
"Are you afraid?" asked Phil suddenly, with his usual calm.
He looked down at Steve.  Steve's mother had been gone for, what... seventy years or something?  He was pretty sure they'd lost their mothers around the same age. An age that was too early and yet late enough that they'd both been expected to man up and bear it.  Steve had been close to her, Tony knew. He knew she'd protected him, in a time when, as an omega, and a rather sick, poor one at that, he could have easily been sold off in an arranged bonding to a less-than-pleasant Alpha.
"I'm sorry to bother you, I just... can I get a picture?" said the girl who was hovering at their table.  She was an Alpha; she didn't look at Steve.
after he went into heat, and, I don't know if you've seen the headlines, but now Captain America is championing omega rights and if anyone gets ahold of what you did--"
Steve felt small waves of vibrations through the wires, and then-
"Cooper's very into dinosaurs right now," explained Laura.  "I made the mistake of letting him watch Jurassic Park and now he's obsessed."
. Don't you think it will affect your relationship? You can hardly carry on as before..."
just there to look pretty, I could make a statement myself.  Are you surprised?"
Happy Thanksgiving to our American readers!
"No.  It's definitely not normal," said Rhodes.  He strode across the lab and hovered over Tony.  The contrast between them-- Rhodes in a crisp blue uniform, Tony in sweatpants-- was striking.  "Hey, buddy.  It's me."
"What?!  No! Oh, no!  You're going to get up, drink some water, put on a big, fake grin, and go support your omega!  Right now!" snapped Pepper, reaching down to tug Tony up by the back of his jacket.
“...Pepper told me to get you decaf.”
Tony sighed, relaxing slightly.  He closed his eyes.  “Hey, Stan?  Do you ever feel like life’s too short?” asked Tony quietly.  “We dragged ourselves all the way out here for what?  To watch some asshole drive my car for me?  ...seems pointless, doesn’t it?  Kind of allegorical, too.  Watching people go nowhere desperately fast for no reason...  I don’t know.  Maybe I’m just jetlagged.  Yeah.  That’s probably it.  Hey… you’re doing a great job.  I’m not just talking about the massage.  I’m talking about everything else.  You’re… okay.  I’m glad Pepper picked you.”  He reached out and patted Steve on the head.  “Let me sleep now, okay?  Wake me up when it’s time to hit the club.  I hear Musk and Hammer are gonna be there.  God, I hate that guy.  Hammer, I mean.  Elon’s great.  Anyway, wake me up in a few hours, ‘k?”  Tony rolled over, thinking.  Why was he here in the first place?  Why was he at some stupid resort in Monaco when he could be out fighting bad guys, or at least sticking his dick in some cute, wild little beta?  It seemed like a waste of his time, to be rubbing shoulders (ha!) with guys like Stan, who was a nobody, and Hammer, who was a somebody who was insufferably annoying.  Yeah, it seemed like a waste, especially if… no.  Tony didn’t let himself think it.  He was fine.  Perfectly fine.
"T-Tony..."
(See the end of the chapter for
responsible?  They went crazy during heats, and it's not like Tony had explicitly asked for Steve's permission when he'd bitten him, either.  Bonding just... happened.
Steve was shooing him toward the bed; Tony was stumbling slightly with exhaustion, but his mind was spinning at a hundred miles an hour.
He stomped down the hallway, carrying Steve, who was squirming a little, and Tony glanced down to murmur at him.  "I've got you," he reassured him.
thought Tony idly.  Natasha was borderline terrifying; Clint was a bit more jocular, and besides, he was an omega; Tony didn't feel at all threatened around him.
"Mating is a rather different thing than making love," said JARVIS.
"And I was surprised at how much hatred people still have in this century. The best advice I can offer is that people need to listen to each other more. There's nothing wrong with having your own opinion. But if it never changes, even when you're faced with new information, then you really need to take a good hard long look at yourself. I met so many Alphas at that conference who had no idea what kind of sacrifice and what kind of horrors a man like has endured as a soldier and they didn't give a shit. They had no respect for me. They thought I belonged on my knees and in that collar and they would never change their minds about. They will never listen. Alphas like
"But when is it?" Steve asked, clearly still curious.
omega," he said proudly as Aria pushed Steve onto the stage.
Fortunately Bucky knew where Steve was, at some swanky hotel in Long Island, which was relatively close.  Thank God for that. Bucky was feeling increasingly worried about Steve, who had felt so panicked earlier and was with some other Alpha.  Bucky was having trouble getting his dander down because he could hear the other Alpha in the background, spitting out all sorts of threats and obscenities.

"...it's okay," said Tony quietly, looking down and squeezing Steve's hand.  "Even if it's
Tony was already gone, while
He wasn't sure who started it but suddenly they were kissing. Tony was winding a hand into his hair as Steve braced one hand against his chest. And people were whooping around them but he wasn't really paying attention. It just felt to be good here with
Nick pulled a face. "Impressive."
The one who had yelled for them to fall back stepped forward.  "...Captain Rogers.  My pleasure.  This is a bit of a mess, isn't it?" he said pleasantly, gesturing.  It was.  "...perhaps we'd be better off making a deal.  We don't want you dead.  And I'm sure you would rather not be dead, either.  We can agree on that much, yes?"
...Romanov.
His grip loosened.  "что такое Bucky?" he demanded.  Curiosity had flooded him.  Who the hell was this guy, anyway?  This guy with a weird smell... an omega who fought back, who punched hard and stabbed him and then tried to order him around... this guy who said words like "Bucky."  His heart was pounding.  Even the fear of punishment and reprimand, of disappointing Karpov, of a re-training session... even all that couldn't stop him from asking.  That word carried
Malick was clearly trying to repress his smile; he had hit them on purpose with the worst possible news and he seemed to know it.  Tony could almost hear Malick's thoughts:
Steve let out a high-pitched whine as Tony's knot stretched him further. His fingers tugged lightly at his hair, gasping and squirming beneath him at being filled again. His eyes rolled back as Tony grazed over that sweet spot inside of him. "F-Fuck..." He gasped out, trembling beneath him. "Please- ah-h... Do that again. God, Tony,
"No. We didn't," Steve said quickly, seeing the panic in Tony's eyes. "My virginity is still very much intact," he joked weakly and moved to steal the second cup of coffee off the tray. Tony frankly looked adorable with his hair sticking up in every other direction. Steve wanted to run his fingers through it and push it back from his forehead.
Tony had said he wanted Steve, and had begun slowly shredding his Styrofoam coffee cup while he waited for a response.  His hands, as usual, had to be kept busy. His lap was filling with artificial snow.
'"I know I left for a day... but I came back. I'll always come back."  Steve nuzzled Tony's thigh and Tony patted his head, and the two of them lapsed into silence, letting the sounds from the television wash over them and fill the quiet space between them.
The photo was awkwardly taken with John's two very own omegas plastered up against Steve. It was all very unusual. Steve didn't really know what the protocol was here.
Steve blinked and looked up, seeing a concerned Tony watching him. "It's not a...scary memory," he whispered. "Just a sad one.  Can we sleep? I mean, you don't have to. But I just wanna sleep it off."
Tony was already moving; he slithered over to Steve and in an instant was in his lap, pressing into him, clinging to him.  Steve could feel his body trembling. Tony huffed against Steve. A confusion of terror and arousal coursed through him. Once again, he was forced to conclude that heats were not nearly as fun as he had previously thought.
Steve sighed contently as Tony's lips dragged over his abdomen. That was common routine, as was Tony stroking him. The foreplay had certainly improved over the period of their relationship, especially as Tony grew more comfortable with Steve's body and as Steve worked out what the hell to actually do. But
Steve vaguely felt like being sick.
The Expo, in Tony's mind, was probably one of the safest places Steve could possibly be.  Top-notch security, worthy of a large-scale Stark event.  Under Tony's complete control.  That would give him time to figure out where Vanko was.  Probably not still in Monaco.  He could be anywhere in France or Italy... anywhere in Europe by now, really.  But since he was working alone, surely he couldn't have gotten too far, right?  And once Tony hunted down Vanko, then he could tackle this whole Winter Soldier business.  Once those two were out of the picture... then what?  Deal with Bucky, maybe?  Find the guy and set him straight about whose omega Steve was?  Tony wasn't sure he could face the other Alpha who had bonded Steve.
He shivered at the drape of the blanket over them.  He looked up at Pepper and smiled.
Banksy got up and began pacing again.  "I mean, he's not really that old, he's barely in his eighties, really, and he's in great health.  Like they said, he's a fighter, and--" Banksy stopped suddenly and then crumpled like a marionette whose strings had been cut.  His previous, slightly manic rambling was replaced with a high, keening wailing that went on far, far longer than was normal.
"Let's go," said Sam, and a moment later, he'd unfolded a massive pair of metal wings and launched into the air.  Tony was dumbfounded; it took him a moment to follow.
"Well, in any case, rabbits are so much more weak-minded than bears."
...except Clint.
"Hey, man, can you talk?  Can you say something?  ...do you think he's homeless?  Maybe some kids beat him up.  Hey, man, come on, what's your name, bro?"
, but didn't know how.
Karpov slammed a fist onto the table in front of him; they all jumped and Pietro hissed with pain.
"Yeah?  Then how come Steve's letting Bucky nuzzle into his neck, huh?" snapped Tony.
But people were watching.  He had to be tough.
"And if the cause for concern is made worse by what you see?" Steve asked, eyes narrowing.
more, though," he added, clearly unable to drop, as Banksy termed it, "Alpha machismo."  Perhaps part of it was because of the two omegas in pre-heat. Or perhaps it was the steady stream of martinis.
, because seriously, if you didn't, you missed a incredible opportunity, Cap..."
heart I've drawn in a week."
Steve. You're
"They're mostly true," said Tony with a nostalgic smile.  "I mean, things have been different since--" He stopped suddenly.
"Hey," he called out.  He looked back at himself in the mirror.  He looked a lot more like himself, his beard shaping into a sharper, more manageable goatee.  "...I left your room alone," he said. "...not really much choice, since you crammed my old reactor into the wall and stuff."  He was trying to downplay the fact that, truthfully, the reason he'd kept all the orchids, and Steve's room, and all of Steve's stuff, was that deep down, he wanted Steve back.
"Is he taking me to you?" asked Bucky.  He was feeling optimistic. He was about to be reunited with Steve and Colonel Karpov and they could go home and live in Brooklyn, one big happy family, and with the two of them at Bucky's side, he was sure he would get over this weird fog that was in his head.  He might not even need his notebooks anymore. (He was on his third. It was black, like the other two.)
"Wait 'til you see the courtyard!" said Tony cheerfully as Steve cut the engine.  He pulled off his helmet and ran his fingers through his messy hair.
Steve followed Tony's gaze out into the water.
Sitwell slammed against the one-way glass, face red, eyes bulging.
She waited by Tony's bed, hoping he'd awake with a goofy, embarrassed grin and crack a joke.
and the heart of any beast or machine was vulnerable.  And he could not let Vanko win.
He decided to ignore Steve.  He didn't want to think about him, or look at him.  He turned to Fury instead.
"...good morning, everyone.  On the advice of Director Fury and SHIELD psychologists, we've decided that monitoring Captain Rogers' and his mate, especially considering both are currently decommissioned, is no longer a practical use of our resources.  So, we'd like to discuss the stipulations necessary to remove the ankle monitors from Stark and Rogers... with, of course, an understanding of certain expectations."
?" she repeated.
Steve's words about not loving him enough were ridiculous.  Tony wasn't the one who had left, not this time. Steve had been the one to demand to be left alone, who hadn't called, who had been out doing who-knows-what with his other Alpha.
"But anything is worth being able to breathe," Steve hummed, closing his eyes briefly.
"Yes, sir.  Quite a bit.  Supposedly, the gas leak caused quite a bit of damage."
"I can... I can see glass?" Steve's eyes fluttered open and he frowned. He reached out, as if he was touching something, but his fingers met nothing but air. "It's steaming up." Then he almost smiled before he was back to frowning again.  His gaze shot up as Tony's fingers brushed against his cheek. Steve's gaze didn't focus on Tony's face but instead hovered over it. "You left me here. It's cold here." He clutched Tony's hand tight. Steve's voice broke a little. "I don't want to be alone anymore."
Steve set down his empty glass and then turned into Tony's touch, head tilting into a ferocious kiss as his hands thread into his Alpha's hair.
"...I love Boswell," he began.  His voice was hard and determined.  "I... I love Boswell with all my heart.  And I always will. Boz was my best friend and my mate and--"  His voice cracked a little. He paused. "--and I love him," he repeated, then took a deep breath and looked down at the paper in his hand.  "I-- I met Boswell in 1982, when I was seventeen years old. He bought me for eighteen thousand dollars, which back then was the price of maybe two luxury cars."
"Steve!" exclaimed Donner cheerfully, dropping into the nearest seat with clear exhaustion.  The baby in his arms was asleep. He beamed wearily. "Wanna hold her? ...did you... did you have a... a nice heat?"  Donner looked suddenly concerned, unsure of how to ask. There was an unspoken strangeness in their connection. Gideon clearly had a "type" and that type was Steve.  He had taken Donner as his mate, dumped him, and then tried to take advantage of Steve.
"Hey Stevie.  Great interview.  Loved the pictures," said Tony cheerfully, wrapping an arm around his waist.  He tried to pull Steve over but ended up pulling himself against Steve instead; Steve was heavy and built like a brick wall, and Tony couldn't really tug him around like he was used to doing with his girls.  "Pizza?" he offered, gesturing to the Domino's box on the coffee table, half-buried in orchids.
"'Mega," said Lila, pointing to Steve.
"No it's not!" Natasha replied as they left in a sing-song voice.
Rhodey's teeth gritted again.  "If they're your friends, where are they now?"
Steve blinked and he was stepping forward towards him, getting too close before he stopped himself. He felt overwhelmed with emotion. With relief. He could hardly breathe.
"Yes it does... I mean, we never lock it, sir," said one of the sergeants.
"Um, yeah, he's out on the pool deck."
"I'm trying," said Tony, straining.  Their fingertips brushed.
"Beats me," said the woman in the red dress, shrugging and walking away.
She made sure the door was closed behind them before turning to Tony.  The surface of the pool was crystal-clear; the sun was shining; it was distinctively non-Christmas-like.
JARVIS summoned the film up on the giant screen on the opposite wall for them without having to be asked, the credits playing out as Steve settled his head against Tony's chest. It was becoming an automatic position. It was comfortable and cosy and for some reason he liked the gentle glow and thrum of the arc reactor. It was oddly calming. It was a reminder that Tony was alive, he was here and he was strong and he was staying that way.
The rest of the drive was mostly silent, except for occasional soft whines from Donner.
He sat back down on the couch, dragging Steve over to rest his head on his kneel, still massaging behind his ear.  Steve wasn't kneeling; he was simply draped like a ragdoll, half on the couch and half on the floor.
"Shouldn't have stayed up so late," Aria said and sent him a pointed look. Steve wished he was just so tired because him and Tony had been lost in bed together. No, it was a far more depressing reason than that.  But he didn't correct her.  Instead, he let her drive him downtown, stopping at another Starbucks for another quadruple shot.
Then, eventually, he climbed down and set out west on foot.  He didn't know where he was going.
"My report on you was honest," Steve said. "So yes, it was good. And it was fair too. But...if you're serious about getting on the team then you have to accept you're gonna see me in danger. You might see me hurt. You gonna see me hurt other people. And I want you to think about if you can deal with that."
"Omegas were not typically paid.  If my namesake was bonded to your father, it is likely he maintained the house as an unpaid domestic servant, receiving in turn free food and board, as would be typical for an Alpha-omega paid of their generation."
"I'm always okay," said Tony dismissively, kissing the top of Steve's head again.  "They call the suits
"If you need anything, here's my card," said Chantelle, offering Rhodes a business card.  She nudged Donner in the ribs with the toe of her pumps. "Donner, you make sure you mind Dr. Emmett."
.  Fate was a funny thing.
"I just feel... empty," Steve said quietly, after a moment, his gaze unwavering. All his politeness had gone. He didn't have the energy to smile, or to do much else. "Just... yeah, empty."
, Tony."
"Only because your foot is screwed," Steve told him and then slid out of the bed.
Tony looked around at his house, the modern, minimalist design.  The only room of the house Tony had ever felt home in was his shop.  The rest was impersonal. Everything was immaculately clean, thanks to the staff.
Tony dug his fingers into Steve's wrists, thrusting into his wet, silky body lovingly; each twitch of his hips was heaven and he hadn't even sunk the knot in yet.  His eyes were closed and Steve's smell was surrounding him; it was pure bliss.
Tony let out a half-sigh, half-groan of satisfaction.  He glanced down when he felt Steve pull away; Steve was smiling up at him, his lips still wrapped around the end of his member.
"Right and they're designed to be a symbol of the omega's service to the Alpha.  Right?"
?  On your birthday?  The hell are you talking about, Steve?" asked Tony, eyes narrowing a little.
Well...
too silly.  (Admittedly, no one except Tony had ever seriously considered
Steve let out a broken sound as Tony's tongue pushed inside of him. He choked, his hands fisting tightly in the sheets with the effort of keeping still. It took everything inside of him not to push back onto his tongue, seeking out more. Steve would accept what was given to him.
The girl cocked her head at him.  "...do you even know what year it is?" she asked.
. I'm scared. And I think he is too."
At this, Karpov hesitated.  He looked at the soldier, then said, "...солдат.  Did you recognize your target?"
"Oh.  Well, good!"
"...could never stay mad at Buck for long. Not even when he bought girls home. Too goddamn charming."
"Apparently it was full of drawings. But apparently most of them were of, like, red skulls, and the Winter Soldier, and--"
"Because you have a scar on the back of your neck!" protested James.
"Just because
"No," repeated Tony, looking quite a bit more sober than he had a moment ago.  He pointed. "That's not Steve's collar."
Tony's mouth twitched; behind his sunglasses, his face was otherwise unreadable.  "...wow, how 'bout that... maybe it's an omen, Steve... about people forgiving us and giving us second chances..."  He realized Steve had been frozen during the entire Beth debacle. Back in the day they'd been a couple of interest.  Both of them had regrettably short names so they'd never gotten a fun nickname like Bradgelina, but they had nonetheless had quite a few headlines together.  "...Beth's an old flame. You'll like her. She's like you, you know, kick-ass and always telling me to drink less," he explained. "She's the beta redhead." He had no idea why he added that.  All his bodyguards were betas and Beth was the only female and Steve could have probably figured out which one she was. "...I guess she's proud of me for settling down," he mused as he climbed into the back of one of three black, unmarked SUVs waiting for them in front of the house.
Tony examined the case carefully.  "I don't think anything'll cut through this... it's adamantium."
The Winter Soldier. had never been tempted before.
"It's a sensible precaution," he hummed. So Nat and Sam hadn't told him then. They were good friends; Steve was grateful to be saved the embarrassment.  Although Fury was a beta, he was, in a way, Steve's boss, and Steve didn't like the idea of Fury seeing him in heat.
AWAKEN, BUCKY!
Steve sighed and dropped his food down on its plate. "There it is."
"Yeah but I've been really good for like, over half a year..." said Tony meekly, pulling the bottle over.
"Maybe you should focus on you for a while," Laura said.
Kerry gave them a thoughtful look.  "...that's... specific. Well, our teams will be flying out tomorrow to their designated camps to help with the shelter set-ups.  George and I will be in Georgia. If you want to be at ground zero on the 4th, then you should probably fly out tomorrow. Like I said, we're serving the warrant at about six or seven in the morning.  But we'll be working all day and the night before to get operations set up. We're expecting that some of the kids are going to be pretty traumatized... physically, and emotionally."
"Fine.  I want pineapple and pepperoni.  I also need a bottle of Jack.  This is my process."
"I've only ever had one proper one," Steve said and Piper looked confused. "Before, I was too sick," he tried to explain.
"Yes... yes. Okay. It's a base. We think we might have a Winter Soldier lead. We don't know if he's there or not, but there might be some answers.  The base is dedicated to the recruitment and study of enhanced persons.  Mutants, mostly, but it's a facility that would have the equipment to work on the Winter Soldier as well. It shouldn't be too much of a fight.  Just a basic in-and-out stealth mission, intel collection.  We thought we'd offer."
"You don't want to go see Karpov with one eye and a mouthful of broken teeth, do you?"
"Are you sure?"
From what Phil found it looked like the Alpha who 'bought' her died. There was no will in place so his mate inherited everything by default. She used the money to go to college and get a teaching qualification. She'd been lucky, Steve guessed...but she'd also been bonded to the man for five years. He had no idea how hard or enjoyable that was for her, and maybe that was for the best.
Hal sighed and walked over; the woman put an arm around her and gently led her out, probably to get some air.  It must have been Steph. She didn't seem angry, just concerned for Hal.  Hal was tough but based on her outburst, the convention was taking an emotional toll on her.
He was shouting to be heard over the ringing.  They could hear him just fine, of course.  Tony didn't wait to confirm this, however; he was giving Happy a shove toward the exit.  If he was being paranoid, he didn't care; he needed to take Steve to the hospital, needed to make sure he was okay, because he would lose it if Steve was hurt, and he couldn't tell how much of the blood he was seeing was Steve's or his own or someone else's, but the sight of it was like a bright red warning sign that he needed to act,
"Steve already apologized," said Tony.
"I'm so sorry, I thought you two were upstairs, that's what Pepper said when I texted her this morning," Aria was babbling, hand still shielding her eyes.
nearly broken down a door on the plane- something that Tony was pretty sure still needed fixed.
"Colonel Karpov says I may speak to the omega.  How's your hand?"
And when Thursday dawned, Tony was up at his usual time, looking well-rested.  Which made sense, since he'd slept away the better part of two days. He greeted Steve with a kiss and a nuzzle, and headed to the bathroom to shower without any indication he'd spent the last two days acting like the world was ending.  Then again, Tony's moods had always been capricious.
Tony was drifting to sleep in Steve's lap, smiling, cuddling into his hard, flat stomach.  Steve's willingness to make this public was almost,
"Thanks. What am I looking at here exactly?" Steve said, flicking through the binder.
He hummed as he began to come down, nosing against Tony's cheek before he tilted his head into a kiss again, letting his Alpha lead as their tongues slid together. Steve moved his fingers out of their grip in Tony's hair and moved them to run down his arms and over the curves of his biceps.
"Gleason just texted. He says you still need to take pills," Pepper said gently.
Tony climbed off of Steve slowly and smoothed down the front of his t-shirt, forgetting that he was in street clothes and not his usual suit-and-tie combo.
"...cameras?" repeated Bucky, brow furrowing.  What cameras? What was Steve's deal with cameras?  Bucky had a flash of memory, a memory of Steve saying he didn't want to mate in front of a camera.  Was Steve saying he wanted to go somewhere to mate? Bucky perked up a little. "Sure, where do you want to go?  ...home?" Bucky's brow furrowed even more. "Tony... you mean that other Alpha? Don't worry about him, Stevie, I'll take care of him."  Bucky most certainly
"Something like that," Steve nodded. He wrapped an arm around Tony and lead him to the elevator. Just as they stepped inside Steph appeared, handing Steve a bag of chips and a collar. "Thanks," he told her and she flashed him a smile.
He'd had the dream again.  He could hear his mother's voice, crystal-clear, like it was a memory.  She was alive, but barely. Head lolling. Calling for her husband, Howard.  Brown eyes filled with tears.
"I don't know," he admitted.  "...because... you and I... are... were... are?... we bonded."  He glanced up, then down again. He knew about Steve's neck. He'd seen it.  His bonding mark was gone, replaced with a new one. He didn't know whether it had been forced or not.
And Tony remembered, heart pounding a little faster, that DeSoto had asked about his neck that very morning.
Agent Simmons complied, and the two of them burst into the ER examination room just as Dr. McCloud was holding an X-ray up to the light.
They had evening entertainment before poker. A famous singer, and then some dodgier sounding rooms, and finally... a casino, which would be set up mainly for card games. Alphas loved to compete, after all.
"I didn't either," said Tony.  "He was always just Ty to me. I haven't seen him in years."
Tony offered it to Steve.  "Penny for your thoughts? ...whatever the hell a penny is..."
Tony tucked his notepad into the waistband of his jeans, looking sobered by the existence of the collar in the exhibit.
"Sir, you have guests," announced JARVIS.
Clint paused for a bit.  "...yeah, actually," said Clint,  "...I wouldn't mind one."
That evidently didn't make Banjo feel any better.
"...when it heals, will it scar?" Steve asked quietly.
Steve looked over when Tony spilt coffee on himself and almost laughed, a hand over his mouth.
"About the same," Steve whispered and nudged his nose against Tony's cheek in a fond gesture. He let his eyes slip. "I feel like...this weirdly incessant need to please you," he hummed, breath tickling against Tony's cheek. Steve smiled against his skin too, eyelashes fluttering down. He squeezed Tony's fingers gently.
a shield was a shield and Steve wasn't going to complain.  He caught the shield as Agent May threw it, and managed to yank it in front of him a split-second before a second whip lased out and cracked against the surface instead of Steve's face.
"...I dunno... I think so..." said Tony, turning to look at Malick.  Malick had a hand on the small of the other man's back. "...he doesn't look that much like you, though... I mean... he's blond, but that's like, half of all omegas, right?"  The omega turned suddenly. The resemblance was undeniable; the man looked like he could've been Steve's brother. Tony cringed. "...I'm sure that's just a coincidence." He was mostly saying that for Steve's benefit.  He didn't want to think that Steve might be Malick's "type," although it would explain a lot of the hostility that Malick seemed to harbor against Steve.
"N-no--"
The discomfort wasn't his.  He loved his house.  He was sensing Steve's trepidation at technology.
"...you'd think most of these guys would've figured out sex by now," said Tony with a wolfish grin.  "And no, you're confused. Missionary is how you have sex with your
"You monsters!" she wailed and Natasha sent her a deadly look over her shoulder.
He tried to remember.  "Well... I just... I wanted to beat up some Krauts," he said lamely.  Hell, everyone had been signing up. It seemed like a good gig, he had an omega and siblings to care for, and he was a strong young Alpha and his country needed him.  That's why.
At some point in Tony's rant, Steve's eyes dropped and then began watering.  He pressed into the wall, smaller, posture submissive, and when Tony told him to kneel, he dropped like an invisible hand had shoved him down.
He grabbed Steve by his shirtsleeve and dragged him away from the trio.
"Oh, it doesn't matter, he won't do anything unless ordered."
Tony closed his eyes and suddenly, in a surprisingly smooth baritone, recited, "
Tony stared at Steve.  They were less than an arm's reach from each other.  Steve was taller.
Tony perked up.  Maybe this was finally his chance to discover something horrible and gets some credit.  He loped across the lawn towards the building, already picturing piles of skeletons or something.  There was a little brass plaque outside the door that said LEARNING ANNEX, and Tony felt a sinking disappointment.  So this building wasn't on the map only because it had been built later than the rest of the school.
Steve winced a little when they introduced him, proudly, as America's only genetically enhanced super-soldier.  Steve didn't really think he should get credit for the enhanced thing. He was just the test subject, really. He'd just had to sit there. But he kept his thoughts to himself.
Steve leaned into Tony's touch and sighed as the driver took them away from the media and the flashing cameras. He smiled in relief and let his eyes slip shut. He didn't think he would sleep again just now but he was enjoying the peace and quiet. Happy got into another car with Pepper and Aria behind them. It was so early in the morning, and considering the night they'd had, they should all really be going to bed.
Her own simulation had been similar, because her experience was similar, having an omega from SHIELD recruit her.  In her opinion, Tony should consider himself lucky.  She had also had to witness Clint getting tortured.  Those memories were clear, clearer even than some of her own, real memories, and they still haunted her.
"...look at you, you're making
Steve sighed down at his plate. "They shouldn't have stuff from...Afghanistan in the test Tony," he assured him quietly. "It's seen as a field risk for omegas, not so much Alphas. But there
"--I just think that, you know, asking for all these special privileges, that's not equality at all, and it's frankly
He leaned into Steve, heavily, gripping his upper arms.  His legs were threatening to buckle under him.
"--sorry, did you said--- I'm sorry, I didn't follow.  You-- HYDRA-- Fury--
He was suddenly aware that his hair was standing up again.  He reached up with one hand to rub the back of his neck, annoyed.
"I guess so," Steve hummed. "Now I'm just really tired..."
It infuriated Tony that, at his age, his father still influenced and affected him so greatly, but it couldn't be helped.  He'd grown up with his father trying to instill more dominance in him, something that, unfortunately, was an impossibility.  What Steve had said, about Bucky being ruined...
Tony groaned after a few moments, but this time, his eyes flickered open.  "Oh dear, sweet Turing... what did I take... what happened?" He struggled to get up with a whine of frustration.  "Steve," he added, firmly; Steve's smell was screaming for his attention. He rolled over weakly, reaching for Steve.  "Omega," he demanded. How the hell he expected to mate was anyone's guess, because he had the groggy post-anesthetic floppiness of someone who was still feeling the effects of sedation.  But the "how" was not important to him; mating Steve was. His groin was aching with desire.
"Maybe...maybe you could get a cat, or something," Aria suggested.
"Steve's with Donner," she explained, then added, "He's puking."
Whatever Steve had said about Pietro and Wanda had gone over his head.  He didn't even really know who the hell those people were. So they had a vendetta again him... big whoop, lots of people did, he was a high-profile billionaire and ex-weapons designer.  Plus, kind of a jerk.
, Alpha."
Steve popped a grape into Tony's mouth. "Food. You need food. I'm okay, trust me. I'm more worried about you right now. Did you even stop to take a breath on your way down here?" Steve sighed fondly. "Remember. Pepper and Phil are here too. We're fine." Sitwell was probably...somewhere, holed away with paperwork but he wasn't really concerned with him. He barely knew the man. Steve hadn't ever had a proper conversation with him.
They set Pietro and Wanda down on the floor leaning against one of the walls. Happy handed out the McDonald's. Aria started stress-eating fries, and feeding Steve the occasional chicken nugget.  Even sedated, Steve's ravenous super soldier hunger made him crave food.
Cooper seemed unsatisfied with the answer but kept his mouth shut.
"Tony, he left everything here; I'm sure he's going to come back before dinner.  He probably just needs space," she reassured him soothingly.
"Can I order another drink now?" he whispered to Steve, nudging him.  This was too hard to do sober.  The only two people in the world with the authority to stop him from drinking, previously, had been Obadiah and Pepper.  He hadn't needed a drink like this since May.
Steve swallowed, his chest feeling tight. He didn't need to see his own point of view to know what Bucky's corpse looked like tumbling down into the crevasse.
The past was past. Tony's "Merchant of Death" title still haunted him but he'd rather try to ignore it. As if it were a ghost whose power came from acknowledgement.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck," chanted Tony.  He deployed flares, released the shoulder ailerons, and grabbed onto a passing radio tower
"Except Barnes has been dead for sixty-six years," said Natasha, crossing her arms.
He turned to face Tony. "You excited?" Steve was obviously very hyper, his face lit up. "This still doesn't feel real."
Rewarded?  What did that mean?  Another cigarette, maybe?
"So... so just to be clear- no battles, no... no tests?  This is just purely exploratory?" asked Tony.
Malick looked straight at him and said. "Traditionally, if omegas
Steve sighed fondly and stepped forward, putting his hands on Tony's arms. He squeezed lightly and then stepped in closer, brushing the damp hair out of Tony's eyes.
and then you show up in a thirty-year-old t-shirt to make a big announcement without consulting me and also get into a feral fight with one of the presenters
On the roof, Tony was eyeing Sam curiously.  Specifically, his neck.
Being pregnant appealed to him, instinctively, but Steve wasn’t honestly sure he wanted children himself. And it didn't matter, anyway.
vacation, you know just... recharge..."
Natasha offered Tony her hand.
"Tony, I need you here for about five minutes, okay?  This is important."
Steve didn't want to face off with Gideon or anything like that. He wanted to simply prove that he was wrong, and shouting at him certainly wouldn't achieve that.  He walked into the crowd, head held high, trying to maintain a quiet sort of dignity.
"Phil already knows about it. I asked him to break it to Nick when he's having a 'good' day," Steve assured Tony, a hand on his arm.
Tony had given some thought to their anniversary.  He'd already made dinner reservations at a nice restaurant and gotten Steve a gift.  He wanted Steve to know that, despite their rocky beginning and a few major speedbumps along the way, Tony was happy.  This wasn't what he'd expected, but that was okay. It was working.
He was pretty sure it was only through her intervention that he had been allowed to leave.  His doctor had recommended an overnight stay, and had let him go with a number of dire warnings about both the wound on his leg (it could get infected!) and the miscarriage (they had to monitor his blood loss!  He was going to experience nausea and low blood pressure and cramps and in rare cases he could go into toxic shock!)
"Good night?" Steve echoed in a bemused mumble. "It's like...four in the afternoon Tony." He kissed the side of his neck and leaned his head on Tony's shoulder, getting comfortable as he figured they'd be here for a while. His whole body tingled with the afterglow, his sense on fire and singing in pleasure.
"I don't think your status is an excuse once you're president of the United State,s Tony," Steve sighed and ran his hands through his hair. It wasn't really the answer he wanted to hear, that Ellis was a beta who didn't give a shit. Was he allowed to go to the White House if he ended up arguing with the president? Or did he have to go and be nice? Steve didn't think he could keep up a pretense, not even for the president.
Tony was half-asleep for this message and had no clue what Gideon was talking about; he tried to go back to bed only to get woken up every five minutes by JARVIS, who kept saying there was someone at the door for him.
"Tell him I'm coming," Steve said wearily, shoulders slumping.  His panic had subsided and left him with normal midnight exhaustion.  He rubbed sleep out of his eyes, yawning loudly, and then leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead, but missed and got his eyelid. "Urgh. Sorry. I'll let you know how he's doing when I get there," he promised and then slipped out of bed. He wobbled a little before he made his way into the wardrobe to get changed.
"Most people rise before noon, sir," said JARVIS.  Tony had forgotten how damned contradictory the program could be sometimes.
because he'd been a teenager and Banksy had looked only a little older than him, and Tony had had a brief crush on him.  He remembered Stane scoffing; "Bonding makes men into fools," he'd said, glaring at the television that Tony was watching, and Howard had smiled faintly and shrugged and said, "So does love, wealth, and fame, my friend."
know all."
"Hey, Pep?  ...seriously, thanks for running the company.  And the charity. And basically everything."
"Don't thank me yet," Steve told him with a small smile.  "I'm just getting started."
... omega... " murmured Tony blissfully, stroking Steve's head.  "Yes... oh, yes... you're sure you've never done this before... oh, fuck, yes... Steve... Steve, will you swallow for me?" He clenched his teeth as he felt Steve's tongue roam over a vein and trace the head briefly.  "F-f-
If Steve's last two heats were any indication, the full heat would come on hard and fast, in less than a day.  If Steve wanted to do his pre-heat interview, they'd have to arrange it immediately.
Steve watched her set down the recorder. He felt indifferent towards it.
Fortunately the arc reactor was so unapologetically ostentatious that most people never noticed all the other scars.  And when they did, Tony lied. Lab accidents, childhood injuries or diseases, motorcycle crashes... Tony had even once said he'd had an accident with fireworks.  And people believed him, because Tony was charming. But Malick clearly didn't believe that Tony's neck was a result of an accident.
Tony was saying the Pepper thing because he didn't want to talk about the other thing.  He knew Steve knew he liked Pepper, and he knew Pepper knew, too. She'd probably always known.  There was a reason the two of them hadn't dated in the last decade. Their working relationship was incredible; a romantic one would probably be toxic.  And Tony knew that, deep down, no matter how much she loved him, she could never really handle him. Nor could he handle her. Tony was too wild and Pepper too organized, Tony too spontaneous and Pepper too mature.  She had a playful side, and Tony had a workaholic side, but at the end of the day, the two of them couldn't have a household together the way Steve and Tony could.
"...Steve? Captain Rogers? Can you hear me?"
"Too-nnnyyy?" Steve nuzzled against his cheek, getting onto all fours. His eyes widened as the dildo moved inside of him. His Alpha still didn't wake up. He looked at the door Tiberius just had left out of it and then shook the intrusive thought away before he slumped back down on the bed and sneaked a hand down between his legs. "If you want something done right..." he mumbled, fixing his fingers around the base.
He found a second blue Ford Focus and pried off the license plate, swapping them.  An easy trick, one that could shake off authorities for two or three days. If you kept finding the same car and swapping plates, you could use the same car for weeks.  Even better, if you could find three or four of the same car and swap all the plates around, you could bamboozle the authorities almost indefinitely.
I've gotta.  I said I would."
Steve pulled back half an inch, still smiling. "Love you," he whispered.
of Steve riding him was getting him off.  He was infatuated and he knew it and he didn't care, because, like he'd said to Pepper, the feeling was so thrilling and intense and wonderful that it was worth every vulnerability.
Jesus Christ, it was so fucked up, wasn't it?
"SHIELD sent me," Maria explained when she met Tony's eyes. "We're aware that, in this state, Steve could accidentally disclose sensitive information. Therefore I am going to observe filming and ensure that anything that isn't supposed to leave this room,
"He's never going to forgive me," Steve whispered. It didn't matter if Tiberius understood him, not really. It just felt good to say it.
. His body ached for it.
Tony let out a noise of protest when Steve threw back his drink.  Immediately, he began looking around for the waiter again.
right and like this he got to watch Tony's face as he came undone beneath him.
" snapped Pepper.
"No," Brennan answered, his eyes not leaving Tony.
Tony and Steve both wore black suits.  There was a strange pit in Tony's stomach that wasn't his and he felt like Steve spent a little too much time trying to fix his hair.  It occurred to him, on the ride over, that he was twice Steve's age, that he and Steve were a younger version of Boswell and Banksy, and his blood ran cold.  Did Steve see it, too?
"Please eat something."
He was trying, stretching; the desperation in Steve's cold, frosty blue eyes was killing him.  He could feel his grip slipping.
Dr. Gleason looked surprised, then quickly masked it.  "Male omegas have a unique reproductive tract, different than women's.  They have a cloaca, not a vagina.  They're completely different."
Wait.  Where the fuck had that come from?  Steve's pre-heat was making Tony stupid.  But he was already bowing down, still wiggling his fingers inside Steve.  "Be a good boy and show me you like it..." Oh, God, what the hell had gotten into hm…
"Oh my God!  They just found him!" she exclaimed.
guy, and also he's an omega, and you said,
He wondered if they were allowed to make jokes about Clint making nests.  The guy's name was Hawkguy, for crying out loud.  He wondered if they were allowed to make Alpha-omega jokes at all.  He probably should have checked how offensive and sarcastic he was allowed to be before demanding to join.  Assuming they even
me right now?"
The four of them sat in a ward together, Tony clinging to Steve, practically on his lap.  Across from them, a woman in preheat was grinning madly. The moment they accidentally made eye contact, she began chattering away.  "Hi. My name's Marissa. My sister's in there. I guess my hormones screwed hers up so now she's having a baby. It's her first one.  Her husband's a beta. I'm going to be an aunt. Sorry, I'm super excited. Are you guys hungry? This place has sucky vending machines.  Why's there a cop with you? Ben's brother is a cop. Ben's my husband. He's a beta. He's with my sister. Her name's Melissa. This is her first.  Sorry, I get chatty in preheat. Have you met the doctor yet? He's a total hunk. Alpha. Bonded, though. 'Just call me Richard.' I like him. He seems pretty busy though.  Any of your guys got change for a dollar? I'd love a Snickers but the vending machine keeps spitting out my dollar. Have you been crying? I get emotional in preheat too. Do you want a Snickers?  I'll split one with you if you can make change." She sprang to her feet and began pacing.
"Yeah," Steve hummed, "I did. But I don't really think I can do a nine till five, Aria."
He opened the box; a pair of bracelets fell out.
"Neither of those are possible," Steve said without hesitation, without blinking.  "I don't have any living relatives, Alpha or otherwise.  And obviously, I'm bonded to Tony, not to--"
"Don't worry," said Tony, suddenly serious.  He traced patterns into Steve's chest idly with one finger.  "I wouldn't. I know how images are. ...can you fucking imagine if people saw me calling you a slut in bed?  We'd both probably get torn apart by our loving fanbases..."
As he descended the stairs, however, he spotted Steve through the indoor waterfall.  About half of Tony's vast living room was covered in a rainbow of orchids, predominantly white but also pinks and yellows, and a few odd ones, a blue one here and a purple one there.  Steve was standing by the window, staring out of it; the vase of tulips that Tony had moved behind a couple of orchids had been pulled out (
"...out for two..." Steve was saying.
"Ah.  Congratulations, sir."
Tony gave Steve a friendly little salute with two fingers and turned to leave, but stopped short as a black SUV pulled up and four people climbed out.  Steve knew two of them already.  "Blinky.  Phil Collins.  Hi," he said.  The other two were unknown to him.  A steely-eyed man and a red-head, both in tactical gear.  Tony didn't let himself react.
"Aren't you two supposed to be honeymooning?"
She fixed him with a sharp, unwavering gaze.  "You have, what, level seven clearance? So you know exactly what I'm capable of," she said softly.  "I'd rather make this easy. It's late. I'm tired. But I have no problem at all pulling a few fingernails off of you if I think it'll make this easier.  So save yourself the trouble, and tell us what you know."
The Alpha laughed again. "Am I really supposed to believe that our precious Captain America is capable of torture?"
.  Your omega."
He leaned over and nuzzled into Steve's neck again, nipping him lovingly.
Tony nodded.
Karpov stared at him blankly.
"Goddammit,
Steve.  I'm kidding.  That was two years ago, it's not a big deal," said Tony uncomfortably.  The only way he was able to think about this stuff at all was through a lens of humor.  Sarcasm was his best defense; Steve's expression was serious and that worried Tony; the last thing in the world he wanted to do was get serious and forsake getting a blowjob.
‘I want two hundred and a good reason,’ Steve said, looking once again at the painting, like it was the most fascinating thing he had seen in his life.
He had been walking around all day, trying to figure out the best ways to get some money, because it really was his last chance. If he didn’t pay his rent tonight he would be homeless. He wouldn’t survive living on the streets for a week. He already had a cold and with his easy fatigability and his heart problems he probably wouldn’t even live through the first night. Not in this cold weather.
Tony nodded, not really paying attention as he was too busy looking around. He didn't like the arrogant little man, who puffed up his chest to show how important he was. He knew Pepper would laugh at him and say they were too much alike and she would not be talking about how tiny they both were.
‘You can’t do that!’ Tony said.
'I don't have a crush on the guy, you know, he is nice to work with,' Tony said as he eyed Bucky. 'The dresses and fake titties aren't really doing it for me.'
'Do you really think I'm cute?' Steve asked, looking at the floor.
'Yeah, see you in New York.'
‘I’ll pay for the coffee and everything,’ Bucky promised. ‘Just keep this guy happy.’
Genius billionaire Tony Stark, owner of one of the biggest companies in the country and self-proclaimed best engineer of the world, was living in a town house. A terraced house, linked houses, row houses, he was living in a house that was squashed in between two other houses that looked exactly the same. Never in his life had he lived in a place like this, but it was his own fault that he had ended up here.
Clint knocked on Steve's door, but there was no reply. He knocked again, harder this time, but still nothing. Clint called his new friend, but Steve didn't respond. That wasn't normal. Clint knocked once more, but when there still was no sound, Clint tried the door. It was open. He pushed it further open, peeking inside. The curtains were closed and the lights were off, so was really dark inside, Clint couldn't see a thing.
That Saturday they met again. Tony had made a pair of really big wings for himself. He was pretty confident that these would work. Steve looked impressed as well. He carefully touched the wings. They were made of paper, like the first ones, but these looked stronger. Tony handed Steve the rope that was tied around his chest.
'But if you only go from city to city you miss out on places like this. This town isn't much, but they seem to have amazing caves, with glow worms! You won't find those in fluffy beds or big pools! Don't you want to see something of this country?'
‘They’re not good,’ Steve answered. ‘It’s the reason why everyone is hanging around the bar. Seeing how the artist himself is flirting with the owner of the gallery, I assume that she gave him the time and space to show his work to the world. It’s going to cost her her reputation.’
‘Yeah, I told you everyone wanted to be your sidekick, right? There are a few hundred people on the floors below. I thought I’d take a chance and crawl through the vents, but the others are still trying to get the alarm off the elevator. Since they’re not here yet, I think they’re all still downstairs, waiting.’
'Gotta go, I'm really sorry,' he mumbled, before he quickly walked away.
They were delicious. The donut itself was nice and soft, still a little warm, and the icing was super sweet, just how he liked it. He couldn't stop a small moan. Only when the donut was gone, he could think straight again. Tony looked at the baker and couldn't help smiling. The guy looked as good as the donuts tasted. The blond baker smiled back.
'You really used to drive a bike?' Tony asked. 'I thought the writers just wanted to make you look cool!'
It was late and most people of the night shift had left, the morning shift had taken over, so it was a surprise to see Steve sitting in the changing room. He was leaning against his locker with his eyes closed, but when he heard the door he sat up.
'Wake up, Cap, we're here!' Tony said. Steve hadn't even noticed they stopped. 'It's a nice city, don't you think? I like it better at night. You should come over sometime, you have a great view over the city from my balcony. You can see so many lights, I'm sure you'll love it.'
Tony flew down the stairs, followed by Steve, who had to run, but easily managed to keep up. He wasn't just strong, he was fast as well. They went back to the main floor and found Natasha and Clint in the same room Tony had left them. They were still fighting. All of Clint's arrows were stuck in the wall and the ceiling. There were several throwing stars and other blades stuck as well. Tony figured they were Natasha's. Since they both ran out of ammo, their fight had become more physical. They were all over each other. Natasha bit in Clint's arm, while Clint was pulling her hair. It was like watching two kids fight.
‘My name is not James Rhodes,’ James explained. ‘James Rhodes is my best friend. I went on that first date with you, because he didn’t want to go on a date with a guy. He is straight, I’m bisexual, so I didn’t mind taking over. I don’t really know why I still pretended to be him.’
But right now he was in a tiny town with two restaurants, three souvenir shops, two places arranged trips to the nearby caves, and a campsite with toilets, showers, and a pool. Steve was looking forward to it. He would pay for a place to put up his tiny tent, he'd grab some food and then he'd take a dip in the pool.
Tony activated a small magnetic field with his suit, something to nullify the force field around the lava, but nothing happened. It wasn’t an magnetic field. Tony stood closely to the wall and looked if he could see anything. Anything that could give him a hint on how to get inside.
Only one more baker to go. Tony worried that the coffee cupcakes were going to win. They were good, but he wasn't crazy about them. He also didn't want the arrogant girl to win. He was about to sigh when he spotted a big plate, filled with colourful, beautifully decorated donuts. Tony didn't stop himself, he practical ran to the last contestant and grabbed a donut.
'I do,' Tony said. 'But I didn't think it was safe to drive to the supermarket with my being sooo tired, right? My machine can only handle beans though. That's not going to work.'
'I tried everything I could. Nothing else could make me fly. I'm sure magic is the only way, but I don't know anyone with magic. I'll never fly.'
'We have rooms,' Natasha said quickly, before they could start a fight. 'We'll make some food for tonight and get some sleep.'
‘Could you be anymore vague?’ Tony asked. ‘What the hell are you looking for and why is it so dangerous?’
Rhodey rolled his eyes. ‘You’re horrible, why am I even friends with you?’
Tony wasn’t so sure it was going to be fun, so he held himself tightly when Clint stepped on the back of the sled and made the dogs run. It didn’t all go very smooth in the beginning. The dogs walked in a different pace, so the sled went from left to right, almost making Tony nauseous. After a few minutes Clint figured out how to keep the dogs under control though and things were going a lot better. Tony dared to let go and take a map, to see if they were going in the right direction. There was only snow and ice everywhere, but with a little help from the sun he figured out there were going the right way.
'No, no, I'm fine,' Tony said quickly. 'Thanks.'
‘I’d rather be on my bike,’ Steve admitted. ‘But we’re short on staff on days like this, so no working solo for me today. That does mean you’ll be seeing more of me tonight.’
‘Okay, fair point,’ Steve said. ‘Still, asking someone to act like your boyfriend is pretty awkward too. But I had fun. I was planning on leaving around ten and it’s the middle of the night already. Time flew by.’
‘Hey, I brought you coffee,’ Steve said as he handed Tony a cup before he sat down. ‘From the machine in the hallway. You sounded like you needed it. Is everything alright? Did I do something wrong? We’re not cancelling the project, are we?’
Steve hurried back to the dressing room. Most of the others were gone already. He quickly finished his make-up.
Tony grinned widely. They made love all night afterwards. They didn't stop until the sun came up. Tony hadn't slept at all when he had to go to his meeting, but he was more energetic than he had ever been. Pepper had been so surprised!
‘Okay,’ Tony answered, a smile on his face. He managed to distract this hot guy. ‘So planes don’t do it for you? I’ve actually never been on a bike before. They just look scary. Whenever I see someone on a bike I’m afraid they will crash.’
‘WHAT THE HELL BARTON?!’ shouted Tony. ‘How did you even get here without being arrested?’
'Hi,' Tony answered. 'Could have known you were Sam's friend. You're both too nice for your own good.'
Worst were probably grocery stores, Tony decided, as he tried to get four overflowing bags out of the trunk of his car. Grocery stores should be used to torture people.
They exchanged phones and put their number in each other’s phone. Tony almost typed his own name, but he noticed his mistake just in time and changed it before he handed the phone back.
Tony had hurried himself home. His parents knew he was back in town for the funeral, but they were surprised he came to see them. They hardly ever saw each other. Even during breaks Tony only slept at home and spent the rest of his time with Steve.
'Hold the rope, even when I'm in the air!' Tony ordered. 'What if I can't come back down again? You'll have to help me.'
'Yes,' Steve laughed.
'Fuck! I'm not alright!' he groaned.
Tony aimed the repulsors in his gloves at one spot and shot. White light came out of his hands and it hit the invisible wall hard. For a few seconds it looked like the wall lit up green, but it was immediately gone again. Tony shot again. The green showed again, except for the spot where Tony had hit it.
Oh, this was bad.
Steve stifled a laugh and began tapping on the table next to his own seat:
"Nah" Tony dismissed. "Dum-E breaks more things than he fixes and U barely does anything. JARVIS is pretty brilliant, though. I made him when I was 15"
He was still clutching Tony, but there was no change whatsoever.
It was just a normal night for Steve, doing his homework while listening to his favorite playlist, one that Bucky constantly made fun of him of because "that music is over a century old, Steve, get with the times!". He was pretty bored, but that was nothing new. He was supposed to be doing calculus, but he had ended up doodling flowers in the margin of the paper. The professor was probably used to Steve's idle doodles anyhow.
"Shut up, idiot" Tony said, pulling him back in to kiss him again. "I love you, too" Tony navigated them to the sofa, and they collapsed onto it, Steve pushing Tony down so he was lying on it and climbing onto him, kissing him harder. Tony moaned and wrapped his arms around Steve, letting his hand rest on Steve's ass. Steve broke away for a moment to gasp for air, and Tony took that moment to ask "Does this mean I can keep my hermit crabs?"
His eyes scanned the shelf for another scent. His eyes caught on 'Spiced Cider'. He smelt it, and his spirits lifted a little. It smelt good, and it wasn't too strong for his mum's delicate nose. However, when he checked the price, his heart sank. It was far too expensive.
"Uh- what are you doing?" Steve asked uncertainly. "In my house, I mean. What are you doing in my house."
"Tony!" He screamed, dropping down to his knees and grasping Tony's wrist hard enough to leave bruises, checking for a pulse.
'So you admit that this is a ridiculous request?' Sam asked as he walked in again, with some grinded coffee in a cup.
'Oh Tony, tell me you're going to show you can walk on those and didn't bet on a running match with Steve,' Sam said. 'He never lost one of those!'
It was all Steve had said when he replied. He didn’t know what else to say and he hoped that James would send him a text back about being too serious. Steve waited a few minutes, but he didn’t get anything in return. With a heavy sigh he fell back on his bed. This was all his own fault. He shouldn’t have listened to Bucky, he shouldn’t have gone on that first date. It was fun while it lasted, but it kinda hurt that it was already over so soon. Steve hadn’t felt a connection like this with anyone in a very long time.
'You can't fly without magic,' Steve sighed after he had fallen on his knees. They both had scratches and bruises everywhere.
Buddy agreed. He gave his opinion about the texture and the taste and agreed with the color. Cupcakes were supposed to be fun. A simple white cream instead of brown could have done the job already, and they would still have looked sophisticated.
'Sam, we need to protect these guys,' Tony said as he walked into the office. 'They're not going to make anything official if we can't protect them. New ID's, new place to live, a new background, the whole shebang!'
'Wow, how do you get your eyeliner like that?!' Lauren suddenly asked. Steve almost hit his eye instead of the lid, but he stayed calm and showed his new friend what he did.
‘You took a mission to get all the super heroes out of your house and now you are inviting them back in,’ Fury noted. ‘How generous of you, Stark.’
Tony wiggled his eyebrows after his last sentence and Steve couldn’t stop a smile.
Until he found himself on the plane back home. His skin was tanned, his hair was getting way too long, his muscles ached, and he felt very relaxed, but also lonely. It wasn’t that he didn’t miss New Zealand, it had only been a few hours, but he already wanted to go back. But that wasn’t the loneliness he felt. He missed Tony. He missed Tony’s enthusiasm, his funny comments on everything they had seen, his complaining about not having enough space, his knowledge about everything, and the never ending chattering. Steve realized he had tried to fill his days with activities, so he wouldn’t hear how quiet it actually was without Tony.
'You're inspiring! And this is definitely for the bedroom, because I'm not planning on painting you with any clothes on,' Steve winked.
'I will,' Steve said.
'Definitely not with the fake tits,' Olivia grinned.
'Everyone else support them with everything they need, keep looking for information and make sure there is back up ready at all times,' Fury warned the rest of the team, ignoring Bucky’s complains. 'We have seen how things can turn for the worse in no time. Keep the gunfight Barnes got into three months ago in your head. Ronan’s men are always armed. We can't have our people in there when things go wrong. Dismissed!'
‘Pff, you guys already decided, so whatever. The Avengers, sure.’
'We'll do that when we have a project to motivate them to play sports,' Natasha said, rolling her eyes.
‘LISTEN UP!’ he said, shutting everyone else up. ‘I’m not looking for a sidekick, so get the hell out of here already. I don’t have time for this shit.’
‘I hope you get to do a lot more ambulance night shifts in the near future,’ Tony said as he put on his coat. He hooked his arm in Steve’s and pulled him towards the exit. ‘Because that sounds absolutely amazing.’
‘About what?’ asked Natasha as she set her tray on the table and sat down next to Steve.
‘What do you know about me touching asses?’ Tony asked alarmed.
'Yeah, I'm the man in charge and this is my brother in law, Mauro. He'll be judging with us today,' Buddy said as he took Tony inside. They stopped in front of two big doors. 'The contestants are waiting here. I'll go talk to them and when I call you in, just follow Mauro. The bakers don't know yet that you're our client for today.'
They didn't defend Steve in every single interview that a reporter badmouthed him in, ignoring the PR team whenever they hissed "that's bad press, Tony, you need to be amicable!"
"Sorry, what?" Tony snapped back to reality.
Then, he threw his arms around Steve and kissed him, pushing his tongue into Steve's mouth. Steve moaned into the kiss and pulled Tony closer, tangling his hand in Tony's soft hair and placing his other hand on Tony's waist.
Steve's mind instantly began translating the taps of his fingers into Morse code. To his surprise, the man was tapping:
He had Sam.
That's why Steve was currently on his way to Tony's mansion, to try and make up with him and maybe even compromise on a new draft of the accords.
A look of realization dawned on Tony's face. "Because my jet crash-landed on a test run and it's currently half-destroyed"
Steve sighed, frustrated, and stood up, going over to his kitchen cupboard and taking out a large coffee mug that Bucky had got him for his birthday that read 'all-American star'. Bucky had said that it was ironic, considering Steve never drank coffee and, according to him, American blood was 79% coffee. Steve had simply told him that that wasn't the correct definition of irony, but Bucky had ignored him. Steve always used the mug for tea, anyway, so it didn't really matter how many times Bucky insisted that he was disrespecting America by drinking tea.
"Tony!" He was sobbing now as he yanked the bottle from Tony's stiff fingers and throwing it against the wall, where it shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces. "Tony! Can you hear me?"
the man repeated. Then, he looked over at Steve and said "Wanna come over so we can have a real human conversation?"
He put the candle back on the shelf with a sigh, and kept looking. There were a few interesting ones, like 'Vanilla Bean', 'Frosted Cranberry', and 'Sweater Weather'. However, Vanilla Bean smelt like maple fudge and his mum hated fudge; Frosted Cranberry's scent was so weak Steve could barely smell it; and Sweater Weather smelt absolutely horrible.
The man's eyes widened in surprise and he glanced over at Steve.
They continued talking for approximately two hours, exchanging strange stories of their crazy friends and getting into arguments about weird subjects, like why banana flavoring tasted differently than normal bananas, and which taste was the true banana taste. Finally, it was Steve's turn, and he shot Tony an alarmed look before he walked into the tent. He came out five minutes later looking very pale but unharmed, with a bandage stuck on his arm. He whispered "good luck!" to Tony as Tony entered the tent.
"I asked you your name," The guy said, blushing slightly. "Uh- Well, I figured if we're going to be stuck in this queue for hours we might as well- well, get to know each other, I don't know? Maybe have a conversation?" The guy was flushed red now. "Uh- sorry, were you thinking of something? Because I didn't mean to interrupt you, it's just-"
"A long time" Tony admitted.
"I've got my own lollipop outside." Tony winked at Bruce and walked outside. Only when he was outside did Bruce get it and yell a scandalized "Tony!"
"Black Sabbath is brilliant! Let me guess, you just listen to weird 80s music like some weird hipster?"
"Steve," The guy said.
Steve stopped. He was on his nightly patrol down the corridors, listening for any parties or any people who were engaged in- well,
He had Clint, but once he had walked in on Clint staring at a photo of his children, and a huge wave of guilt had hit him. Because Clint had chosen Steve, he was now in Wakanda, hundreds of miles away from his family, from his children and his wife.
"Wow" Steve repeated, amused. "You sure are something, Tony"
Steve huffed, and picked up yet another candle: 'Sparkling Snow'. He smelt it, but it didn't really smell amazing. It didn't smell bad, though, and it was affordable. Steve needed a second opinion. He turned to the man looking at another candle next to him.
Steve would have come up with a witty comeback, but he was distracted with the fact that his favorite mug was now broken. "My mug!", he wailed, running over to the broken mug and cradling the broken pieces. He looked over at the guy and narrowed his eyes. "You murdered it. You murdered my favorite mug!"
"Okay," Steve couldn't stop himself from smiling. "Hopefully"
"I don't really read tabloids" Steve shrugged. Then, when he noticed Tony open his mouth to say something else, he added "or watch television"
"Smell this" Steve said weakly. The man looked at him suspiciously, and took the candle from him, smelling it. Immediately, he dropped the candle and put his hands over his mouth as if he was about to throw up. Luckily, Steve caught the candle, and put it back on the shelf quickly.
They didn't make him laugh like Tony did.
Pep? As in Pepper Potts? Steve seriously doubted that the elegant and dignified Pepper would be making the strange chirping that he was hearing inside the door. Steve waited for a moment, then knocked on the door three times. There was a loud "Shit!" Inside, and then scraping noises. Then, the door opened to reveal Tony, his hair messed up and his eyes wide.
Steve and Tony looked at each other wearily.
"Here's my number, cap. You clearly need someone to help you make your choices in life!" Tony said. Then, he winked. "Call me, handsome"
Steve frantically scrabbled in his own pocket, then Tony's, for a phone to call 911 but he couldn't find one.
"Hey, Stevie!" Tony exclaimed. Tony and Steve weren't exactly friends, but Tony always addressed Steve with ridiculous nicknames anyway. "What's up?"
"That's such a cliché question," Tony rolled his eyes. "but yeah. Hopefully"
When the tea was finally ready, he placed it on the windowsill to cool down, and sat back down on the sofa, leaning back. He didn't go back to calculus, but it was a compulsory course so he was stuck doing it at 12 in the night when ordinarily he would have been asleep by then.
"My favorite is Digital Fortress, though" Tony admitted. "It's exactly my type of book. I don't have much time for reading, though. I spend most of my time down in my lab with my machines"
"So there will be a next time?" Steve asked curiously.
Steve put down his phone. Sarah liked Tony, so he probably wasn't an axe-murderer here to kill Steve or a rogue coming to steal his calculus homework. Steve still didn't know what to say, so he decided to take the polite approach. "Would you like some tea?"
Tony didn't respond.
"Don't you have any coffee?" Tony whined. Steve shook his head. "Fine. I'll have some tea. But only if it's caffeinated!"
Tony sat up straight and glared at Steve. "How dare you offer me the bane of America, our Kryptonite, the substance that freezes our coffee blood while putting up a middle finger!"
"That's even worse!" Tony practically yelled. "Ok, it's settled, next time you're coming over to mine and I will introduce you to the world of good music and pop culture"
"Thanks" Steve sniffed. The candle was so strong that it sent the scent right up his nose.  "This candle is absolutely terrible"
"How long did it take you to come up with that?" Steve rolled his eyes.
"That was pretty weird, right?" Steve asked.
"Sorry to bother you," Steve said immediately, "but what do you think of this candle? I'm thinking of getting it for my mum"
"Steve Rogers" Steve answered. "Where do you wanna go?"
Tony never really saw why homework was necessary, anyway. People already go to school to do work, so why should they do it at home too?
Steve laughed and moved so he was sitting next to Tony. "I'm Steve Rogers" He introduced himself.
"Well, mostly AIs. My best one is JARVIS. He has more human thoughts than most humans do, really" Tony said. "But there's also Dum-E and U. They're my actual physical bots, but JARVIS 'lives' in the computer"
"Why else would I ask your name?" Steve asked, puzzled.
"No, not really" Tony replied. Then, he laughed self-deprecatingly. "I usually don't leave my house, you know, except for stuff like work. Most of the time I work from home, actually, so I only have to attend meetings, and my secretary Pepper usually does that for me"
"I own Stark Industries. You know, Tony Stark? I thought you recognized me!"
"RAs are granted automatic access to dorms if they suspect a student is breaking campus rules! Move aside, please" Even when Steve was annoyed, he was still polite.
Steve needed Tony more than anything, and that was why he stepped off the subway and walked two kilometers to Tony's mansion. Tony had since moved out of Stark tower. He never offered any reason to the public, Steve was pretty sure it was because the nostalgia was too much for him.
There was Clint Barton, who was once found on top of the highest tree in campus, shooting an arrow at the nearest target store's logo, which was over a kilometer away. When Steve went to see if it had actually reached the store, he found that it had hit the bullseye.
The man was wearing a business suit, so Steve assumed that he would most likely be going directly to the meeting once he landed in California.
As Steve neared a large closet, he heard more chirping noises.
Now it was Tony's turn to look surprised. Then, he grinned. "Oh, I like you"
Steve closed his eyes and took a deep breath before turning to Tony.
Steve froze for a moment, then replied "As long as you don't insult my tea, I definitely will"
had betrayed him, Steve thought bitterly. Tony had been making so much progress, too. He had given up alcohol, he had given up his playboy days, and he was genuinely making efforts to become a better person. The last Steve had heard of Tony, Tony had taken Peter Parker under his wing and had begun mentoring him.
They didn't show up with two art museum tickets, grinning and ignoring Steve's protests about the price because "I'm a billionaire, cap, I could buy the whole museum and it wouldn't make a dent in my bank account, so shut up and let me take you there".
"Shh, Steve's patrolling!" Tony hissed inside. "Pep, so help me"
"Tony", he said. There was an awkward pause. "Why is there a tank of hermit crabs in your closet?"
Tony was lying on the ground, an empty bottle in his hand. Around him were shattered shards of brown glass, and lots of bottles, every single one empty.
Steve missed Tony, and he hoped Tony missed him too, because Steve had fallen in love with him somewhere along the way, and any hopes he had of a relationship, even when Tony was still dating Pepper, were crushed when the accords came along and Tony started beating himself up with guilt over Sokovia. But that was what Tony always did. He always beat himself up over everything, even if he couldn't have prevented it, even if it wasn't his fault.
"No, no, it's fine," Tony interrupted him. "I'm pretty bored too, really. I'm just here to skip foreign languages."
"Tea just wants to make people happy!" Steve defended. "It's a pure cinnamon roll, too good for this world, too pure!"
"Not so bad yourself," Steve responded shyly. "Have you ever donated blood before?"
He had Scott.
Steve kissed him again. "Definitely"
"Hey, Brucie," He said as he collapsed onto the chair and Bruce began setting up all the equipment. Tony winced when Bruce stuck the needle in. "I always had a feeling you wanted to stab me."
"You jinxed it," Steve warned. "They're going to accidentally drain all of our blood now and feed it to hungry vampirelings and turn our skin into clothes."
"Really?" The guy asked. "I'm here to skip calculus!"
BEEP. Another announcement. "Flight T-2490 is continuing to experience problems and will be delayed another four hours"
"So, Steve, you're also a morally questionable idiot who signs themselves up for torture just to skip a class?" Tony asked him jokingly.
He had Natasha, but she was always distant nowadays. Sometimes Steve wondered if she regretted her choice.
"No, I'm just browsing, really" The man replied. He didn't offer anything else, so Steve walked over to the next shelf. This shelf didn't have anything Christmassy, but Steve figured a normal candle would be better than no candle at all. He picked one up that read 'ocean breeze', and smelt it. As soon as the scent hit his nostrils, he gagged so hard that he almost dropped the candle. The man looked over at him, alarmed.
So he opened every single cupboard, going through each and every one carefully to make sure he didn't miss anything.
Steve was the RA for Floor 4, which was notorious for its rather unusual occupants. Well, unusual was the polite term. Most people called them crazy.
"I'm sorry, but you can't keep them" Steve said regretfully. "It's against campus rules!"
And without Tony, Steve was lonely.
"No!" Tony practically yelled. "Of course not!" He lowered his voice slightly.
Tony threw his arms up in the air. "I don't know, I figured you were being polite! Steve, I'm literally in the tabloids every single week"
They weren't Tony.
It had been almost a year since Steve had fought with Tony in Siberia, and things were mostly back to normal for him. Well, as normal as they could be for someone who was actively being hunted by the government, and someone who had to leave his home country and most of his friends to go live in a country that he had never even seen before. He knew his situation was better than Tony's, though.
Tony burst out laughing, and soon, Steve joined him. "And turn our bones into flutes."
There was Bruce Banner, a mild-mannered student who everyone liked. Steve had never seen it, but many students swore that he had a terrible temper and that he'd once punched a hole through a wall. Steve didn't believe that, but he did see a dent in the wall once when he visited Bruce.
"Actually, my mom works as a nurse and she suggested that I donate some blood as they're having a shortage right now, and it was a convenient surprise that I signed up for the slot where I'm supposed to be having calculus," Steve explained, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
Angry protests started sounding around the airport.
"Do you have a search warrant?" Tony asked pointedly. Steve sighed, frustrated.
When Steve finally reached the tall, wooden doors, he wasn't sure what to do. When he tried the doorknob, he found out that it was knocked, but when he looked up, he saw that a window was open. Sighing, he looked around for the fire escape. However, in typical Tony fashion, there was no fire escape, so Steve resigned himself to the fact that he would have to climb up a wall without any footholds whatsoever.
"Me neither" Steve said, putting it back on the shelf. "Are you buying candles as a present, or...?"
"Sit down, Tony" Steve pulled him back down. "Why didn't you go with your jet in the first place?"
"Uh-well, uh-machinery! Machinery, all over the floor! Wouldn't want your feet getting hurt now, do we?" Tony stuttered.
Yeah, no.
"Tony. You are wearing shoes." Steve pointed out. Tony looked down at his shoes, and cursed under his breath. "Let me in."
"I'm so sorry!" Steve drew a shuddering breath, and pulled himself up to kiss Tony hard. "I'm so sorry, Tony, I'm so sorry I waited for so long, I'm so sorry I was too focused on myself to see how much you needed me, I'm so sorry I didn't say I loved you. God, Tony, I love you so much, please don't leave me, please don't leave me"
His tears dripped onto Tony's face, but there was no change whatsoever.
college and asked the teacher for
"No" Tony said. "It was being remote-controlled. I was testing out some modifications I made to it"
"Okay, okay." Steve laughed. "But really. I doubt anything will go wrong. My mom donates her blood pretty often, and she's always fine after it. Once, one of my friends went to donate blood and they spent five minutes trying to find his veins, but I'm pretty sure that won't happen."
Okay, Steve was even more confused now. "Are you trying to flirt your way out of this? Man, you broke into my apartment in the middle of the night and broke my favorite mug. And spilled my tea!"
When Tony told Rhodey his plan to skip foreign languages by donating blood, Rhodey had given him a skeptical look and asked him if he was sure that he wouldn't faint. Tony had countered him by saying he injured himself on a daily basis, but Rhodey told him that it was a really strange and unsettling feeling to feel your blood pouring out of you through a tube. Tony had shuddered slightly, but anything was better than foreign languages, and his terrifying professor. Not to mention that he didn't do his homework, and the professor had already given him a two weeks extension.
Years later, at their wedding, Tony winked and told everyone that it was crabs that brought them together.
"Bruce threatened to drain all my blood." Tony laughed. Then, a bashful look came across Steve's face.
he thought.
"They didn't come out yet, don't judge them!" Tony tried. They stared at each other for a moment, before they both burst out laughing. They laughed for five minutes before Steve finally calmed down.
A bad feeling settled in his gut.
Tony wasn't there.
Steve didn't know whether to say his name or protest against the nickname. "Steve. Steve Rogers. Not Captain Handsome!"
Just because he was in love with Tony, it didn't mean that Tony got a free pass from campus rules.
"What sort of stuff?" Steve pressed.
"No! I have private stuff in there!" Tony refused quickly.
Tony laughed. "But your mom is a nurse, right?"
That's why he was currently in the surprisingly long queue for blood donation – to skip foreign languages. On second thoughts, it probably wasn't surprising that it was so long, considering many people probably had the same idea as him. It wasn't that original, and his professor would probably suspect something as Tony had never shown any signs of selflessness before, but she couldn't exactly do anything about it, could she? It's not like Tony had to sign a document that read 'why are you donating blood? Please tick an option' that would inevitably reveal his ruse.
Steve cried harder and kissed him again, but there was no change whatsoever.
"You're really not calming me down, Steve," Tony said.
"Me too," Tony said. "But it's just donating blood, right? What can go wrong?"
"No," Steve admitted. "I specifically chose the slot where I'd be missing calculus. God, it's awful."
To Tony's pleasure, the line was moving very slowly, and Tony was near the back of the queue. If he was lucky, he would reach the front of the queue in two hours and he would miss part of the next class too. There was one problem, though. Tony got bored very easily, and five minutes of waiting already felt like an eternity. He idly looked around. There wasn't much to see, really. A few campus buildings, a first-aid station in case anyone collapsed from blood loss, three or four wilting trees and, of course, the rather small tent for the blood donation. It was a cold afternoon, so many of the students were wearing thick jumpers or jeans. Tony guessed that the administration specifically chose a cold day so students wouldn't faint from the combination of blood loss and heat.
There was no pulse.
The bad feeling in his gut grew stronger when he found a couple of whiskey bottles in the top cupboard.
"I need something nice to smell, now" The man demanded, looking around desperately. He picked up a candle that read 'Calla Lily' and smelt it quickly. However, his nose wrinkled again and he put it back quickly. "This is also bad- you know what, screw this, I'm getting out of this shop" Just as the man was about to storm off, he stopped and looked at Steve. "Hey, wanna come with me to eat something?"
Just as Steve was about to get up to take his tea, a figure outside his window wrenched it open and vaulted in, knocking his favorite mug off the shelf where it broke on the ground and babbling at a million miles per hour.
Steve couldn't stop himself from laughing this time, though his nose was still burning too. "It is really horrible, isn't it?"
"Tony!" He sobbed when he finally collapsed on Tony's body. It was only then that he realized how cold and rigid Tony's body was, and how pale he was. "Please don't be gone, please don't leave me" He hugged Tony hard, and cried even harder when there was no response. "I love you, Tony Stark, I love you, please don't leave me"
They didn't wake Steve up in the middle of the night because "Steve, get up, I want to have a Firefly marathon!"
Suddenly, the loudspeakers announced that "Flight T-2490 is experiencing technical problems and will be delayed by another five hours"
Steve and Tony stared at each other in horror.
"Sorry, I'll buy you a new one" The guy said unapologetically, walking over and plonking himself down on Steve's sofa and helping himself to the packet of doritos that Steve had opened. Steve was about to call the cops, but then he noticed that the guy had leaned down to pet Sarah, who was purring contently. The guy picked her up and placed her on his lap, continuing his stroking. Sarah pawed at him gently, and Steve stared in disbelief. It had taken him three months to get Sarah used to him, and even longer to get her to love him, and it took this guy all of three seconds?!
"Wow" Steve smelt the candle again, and shrugged. It didn't smell so bad to him, but granted, he had been smelling candles for over an hour so his nose was probably malfunctioning. He looked at the shelf again, and picked up the candle in front of him, which happened to be called 'Fresh Pine'. He smelt it, and immediately sneezed.
"Tony!" His voice was desperate now, as he rushed through the ground floor, throwing open every door and barely sparing a second to stick his head in each one.
"I already said sorry!" The guy huffed. "What's your name, Captain Handsome?"
"I'm wearing shoes, Tony" Steve dismissed.
He felt something fuzzy on his legs so he looked down to see his cat Sarah happily rubbing her face against his legs. He smiled and bent down to pick her up and place her on his lap, stroking her and getting a lapful of loose fur. He would clean it off later; it's not like anyone would see it now, right?
Steve's face lit up, and he leaned in to kiss Tony softly. The kiss was over as quickly as it started. "Sure"
Okay, maybe this wasn't so bad.
"Yeah" Steve yawned again, his eyes half closed. "I think I might take a nap. Wanna join me?" His eyes snapped open, but Tony was already laughing. "No, I didn't mean it that way! You know what I meant!"
Tony was gone.
Tony looked at him sadly. "I found them all when they were just babies, and I raised them myself. I went to the beach and crawled around for hours trying to find them larger shells. I made sure to feed them only organic food. I talk to them, I sing them to sleep. Please, Steve. Don't make me get rid of them" Just as Steve was about to say something else, Tony jumped up and grabbed Steve's hand, making Steve blush. With his other hand, he opened the tank and reached in to pick up the smallest one. "Look at this one! She's the youngest. Her name is Pepper" Tony looked up at Steve with large, pleading eyes. "Could you get rid of her, Steve?"
"Don't worry, the only thing I'm judging you for is your horrible taste in fashion and music" Steve assured him. Tony looked indignant.
The girl behind Tony made a strangled noise, but Tony ignored her.
"You alright?" He asked, rushing over. Steve nodded, his eyes watering and his nose burning.
There was Loki Laufeyson, Thor's adopted brother, who got just as much shit as Thor did for his name, perhaps even more. He was cold, calculated, and had a silver-tongue that he could use to charm his way out of anything, or even into anything, like the room where the exam test papers were hidden.
homework to do for fun and spent his evenings holding a math textbook while whispering "my precious".
"Well, I work a lot with inventions, machinery, robotics, so I figured Morse code would be an interesting thing to learn", Tony grinned. "Helps me meet attractive strangers"
"It was compulsory in the military" Steve explained. "You?"
To Tony's surprise, the person manning the needle was none other than Bruce Banner, one of Tony's good friends.
Tony smiled.
"Nothing" Steve said. "I should ask what's up with you, considering you look so flustered. Are you hiding something?"
It was only 10, and there were still six hours left until the plane would start boarding.
"Really?" The man looked vaguely curious. "Let me smell it" Steve handed the candle to the man, who took a sniff of it. The man sneezed even harder than Steve had, his eyes watering. "What the hell is that?!"
"Oh, ok" Steve said. "Wait, were you in the jet when it crashed?"
Contrary to popular belief, Tony was a human like the rest of the students and he, too, hated college. Well, at least some classes. For example, foreign languages.
Tony held up his hand for a high-five, and the guy obliged. "I'm Tony."
"Uh, excuse me?" The man didn't respond so Steve raised his voice a little. "Excuse me?"
But that wasn't the only reason.
Steve sighed and picked up yet another candle. It was Christmas Eve and he was trying to find a good Christmas candle for his mum, but he was having a hard time finding something good. He was in the candle section of a large department store that he didn't even know the name of, but the candle section was so large that he didn't even know where to start. He checked the name of the candle he was currently holding: 'Cinnamon rush'. He brought it up to his nose to smell it, and frowned. It didn't even smell like cinnamon.
"Your innocence is so cute", he said when Steve looked at him questioningly. Steve blushed. "What's that book you're reading?"
"40s, actually"
"You can't be serious" Steve accused. "I'm calling your bluff. That can't possibly be true!"
Tony tried to kiss Steve again, but Steve put his finger in between their lips. "Public affection isn't allowed in airports" Tony looked disappointed until Steve said, "but I don't think they have cameras in the bathroom".
Steve tapped back:
He had been in love with Tony for years now.
"Way to kill the mood, Steve," Tony replied dryly. "But no, I've never donated blood before."
Steve stifled a laugh, making the man glare at him. The man held the candle that he was holding out to Steve.
As soon as Tony walked away and through the gates of the reception, his own phone pinged with a text message. He opened it to see a text from an unknown sender.
In the end, it didn't really matter that the flight was delayed for so long, because Steve and Tony found a way to pass the time quickly enough that they almost missed the boarding call.
"What's your name?" Steve asked, realizing that he didn't even know the man's name.
"Really," Tony accused.
"You evil gremlin", the man choked out. "This is the worst candle I've ever smelt in my life, oh my God, my nose is burning and that candle can't possibly be an ocean breeze. A breeze in hell, maybe"
They didn't roll their eyes whenever someone used a word like 'amicable' and say "what is this, a literary convention?", even though they used longer words on a daily basis.
"I live just fine, thank you very much!" Steve retorted. Tony stood up, making Sarah leap off with a sound of betrayal, and picked up Steve's phone, ignoring Steve's noise of protest. He opened Steve's contact list, and entered in his own number. At least, the number was presumably his own.
It was more than a little awkward, but it wasn't uncomfortable, and Steve was enjoying the proximity to Tony, who he had been more than a little entranced by.
"Tony!" He called out in fear, running to the nearest room and checking inside it.
Steve groaned and rubbed his temples. "Tony, do you want tea or not?"
"Definitely!" Tony grinned. "Been waiting for you to ask." Steve held his phone out to Tony, and Tony entered his number. Steve leaned down and quickly kissed Tony's cheek. Tony huffed, and Steve looked scared for a moment before Tony pulled him down to kiss him properly. They both smiled into the kiss, and when they pulled away, Steve's face was lit up with happiness. "See you soon, darling"
Tony had lost his girlfriend and all his friends, and the one friend he still had was left paralyzed due to a hit from Tony's own teammate. He had lost the support of the citizens of the world, as most people seemed to have gravitated over to Steve's side, as they always seemed to.
Steve missed Tony, missed how they would squish up together on the sofa for movie night, how Tony would stagger into the kitchen in the mornings, mumbling about coffee, how Tony's eyes would crinkle whenever he laughed at one of Steve's stupid jokes.
"That's it!" Tony practically yelled, standing up. "I'm calling my private jet, and it will take both of us to Cali. I cannot deal with this. Seven hours, Steve! Seven hours! That's until midnight! I have a meeting in two hours!"
"What type of machines?" Steve leaned forward, interested.
"What do you do? In terms of work, I mean" Steve clarified. Tony looked at him, confused.
The man frowned and turned to Steve. "What?"
"I love you", Steve murmured into the kiss. Then, he froze and pulled away, already apologizing. "I'm so sorry, Tony, it's probably too early, you probably don't like me anyway-"
There was no answer.
And they had betrayed him, too.
"Uh- can I have your number? I mean, I like you- not in that way, just- well, yeah, in that way, but- ugh!" Steve sighed, frustrated at his inability to speak coherently. "I like you. Wanna go out?"
Muttering angrily under his breath, Tony stepped back into the dorm, letting Steve make his way in. As soon as Steve entered, he took a moment to observe Tony's room. It was messy, with piles of books piled up haphazardly in every corner and machinery scattered all over the ground. Steve began going around the room, inspecting every piece of furniture while Tony sat on the sofa like a sulky toddler.
'Stef, you dirty, dirty boy,' Lauren laughed when Steve entered the dressing room.'You had a threesome! Did you like it?'
'Don't blame yourself, Tony,' he smiled. 'I really loved this, I wouldn't have agreed if I didn't like it, okay? Accidents happen. But if you really want to be my hero there is something you can do.'
Even on their 70th anniversary Steve had still chosen Tony first. He couldn't carry him anymore and the sex wasn't what it used to be, but they touched and kissed and loved.
'I'm gonna make it quick, I have a conference call in five minutes,' Tony explained, checking his Rolex. 'Pastries, I need pastries. They taste good, and you can eat them quickly in between two meetings. Or bring a box full of them to meetings, to share, or not. So yeah, pastries. You know what I like. How long do they have, Buddy?'
'Yeah, show me,' Ronan said curiously.
'I'll try to find out more about him. Her. I'm confused about this. Him, I guess,' Tony said. 'What does she look like?'
'We were not,' Steve defended them. 'I kinda grew out of my clothes all of a sudden. I was redressing when you burst in.'
‘Oh, come on, Tones, you have to do this for me,’ Rhodey said. ‘If you don’t do this I use all 274 favors to make you personally clean my house for the next 274 weeks.’
Clint was searching through his bag and fished a comic out. 'Will you sign it for me?' he asked as he handed it to Steve.
‘I’m really sorry, Pep,’ Tony said as he pulled away from Steve, who went back to his sushi. ‘You’ve been in Malibu such a long time and I wanted to tell you in person and the last time we saw each other Steve and I had only been on two dates. You know how much I suck at relationships. I couldn’t have you all excited and then tell you I screwed up again!’
Steve fixed his tie and looked in the mirror. If he’d ever get his own exposition he wasn’t going to make the opening a formal event. He hated wearing suits. The jacket was too tight around his shoulder and the pants were too big around his hips. He’d have to get a tailored one if he wanted a suit that actually fit, but he didn’t have the money for that. He didn’t have the money for a car either, so Steve took his phone, wallet and keys before he walked to the subway.
Steve looked at the hand on his waist and then to the guy who it belonged to. The man was shorter than him, but very good looking. He did look a bit nervous though, so Steve decided not to yell at him. Yet.
‘I’m sure you’d still look great,’ Steve said. ‘You have to keep training if you want to stay in the air force, right? You can probably eat a lot and still don’t gain weight. How else would you get such muscles?’
‘Well fuck you then,’ Tony said angrily. ‘If you’re not going to help me, I quit. I know you’re earning money because of me, so find yourself another hero who can do that. Or let your agents safe the world, see how long it takes before aliens are destroying our cities!’
'This will be your room,' Nebula explained. She opened the door with a key card, before handing the card to Steve. 'Only you can get in here. If you need help, there are several panic buttons as you can see. There is plenty of security around, so they're here in no time. You can do whatever you're comfortable with, just know that customers pay per minute, so don't let them fall asleep. Any questions?'
'Steve?' Tony asked
‘Are you alright?’ Steve asked. ‘Should we take a break? Drink a cup of coffee or something?’
‘Yes,’ the archer said. ‘Just not with this many dogs and not such a big distance. But hey, these dogs are great! They will know what to do. It’s gonna be fun.’
‘I’m not that bad, you know,’ Tony said. ‘I was going to ask our dearest Captain to move in with me anyway, and I have a few more floors left. I didn’t want any losers in my house. These people have proven that they aren’t losers, they are the Avengers.
James 'Bucky' Barnes snorted. 'Because our Stevie has never been a customer. He'll be blushing so badly everyone will know we're faking!'
‘Steve, are you alright? Are you sick?’ Clint asked. ‘Is there something I can do for you?’
'Well, this room is made for sex, we could just go for it,' Tony said as he touched Steve's legs, slowly moving his hand from the knee upwards.
The three of them went upstairs, leaving some very disappointed men behind. Julia brought them to his room. Tony sat himself down in a chair, showing that he only wanted to talk. Steve put a hand on Julia's back to support him and brought him to the bed, where they sat down together. For a few moments no one spoke. Tony shifted in his chair.
‘What are you talking about?’ Tony asked, not looking up from his current project.
Tony could finally take a good look at the man, and he took his helmet off for that. Steve was tall, with nice blond hair, and blue eyes. He was almost twice as broad as Tony, without the suit, and his arms were about as thick as Tony’s legs. This man looked like one of those Greek statues. Nothing terminator, nothing transformer, this man was hot!
‘No family or friends who can help you out?’
‘Thank you,’ Steve said. ‘I have a lot of questions.’
'I'm really sorry,' Tony said again. 'I'll pay your hospital bills, of course, and I'll pay you for all the time you can't work. It's the least I can do. If there is anything else, just let me know. Really, anything.'
Steve shook his head. 'I sprained my ankle.'
'A regular had promised me he would visit me tonight, but he's still not here,' Steve said, pouting in, what he hoped, a cute way. 'His loss. You got here first.'
‘But they’re so tight,’ Steve complained.
‘Well, I’m very glad to see that you’re so healthy,’ Pepper said as she looked at him from head to toe.
Fuck it, Steve was going to do this. His best friend Bucky used to tell him to go big or go home. This was one of those moments. If he was going to jail, then why not go to jail for trying to steal from a billionaire? Steve turned around and entered the tower. Thankfully it was crowded inside. The lower floors were offices and laboratories and all the people working there entered through the main entrance. The hall was big and light. On the right was a desk where two security guys were joking together. Steve used his invisibility to good use. He was so small and insignificant that people never looked twice. Normally it bothered him when people overlooked him, but now he managed to blend in without the security guys even noticing him.
'Wait, it's dark. Why are you big?' Clint asked surprised. When he saw all three of them smirking his mouth fell open. 'True love's kiss! Oh my God, is that why you are half naked? You were going to do the do! What the fuck, you pervs!'
'Send him up!'
Olivia wiped his tears. Steve didn't know what to say. He just sat there in silent support. For minutes neither of them moved. Steve had known he worked with people who were forced to have sex with others, but hearing the story broke his heart.
He showed Tony the bright red high heels he had been wearing at the club.
Tony peeked into the office where the voices came from. The leader of Sam's team was Stefanie. He was here!
When nobody was paying attention Steve clipped a tiny microphone, which looked like a brooch, on his dress and checked with Sam if everything was working. When he got an okay he hid his badge and the card to the room in his bra. Steve looked in the mirror one last time, took a deep breath and with Sam's encouraging words in his ear he entered the club.
‘I’m Tony Stark. I’m a businessman, I was never in the air force, but most other things I told about myself are true. I came to our second date because I really liked the first one and I wanted to learn more about you. I’m really sorry I pretended to be someone else, but I couldn’t continue like this. I couldn’t lie to you anymore. I like you, and I really hope you don’t hate me right now.’
'Nobody,' Olivia said with a deep sigh. 'But you're an artist, you have a way out. Use it!'
'Nope, half of the tower I mine. I have some chalk, I can draw a line if that makes things easier for you,' the archer offered. 'But I'm not leaving, at least not until you told me why you were being an ass to Steve. He had something important he wanted to talk to you about, you just told him to piss off. He felt down all day.'
'Hi, you must be the head baker,' Tony said with a fake smile. He didn't like this touchy feely guy who acted like they were best friends.
Tony got up and walked out of the room, leaving a baffled Clint behind.
Bucky looked up as well now. ‘You’re late. We were almost sure that you had gone home with whomever you had that blind date with. Was it a guy or a girl? Where they hot? Tell me everything!’
'Do it!' Steve ordered. When the pilot wasn't fast enough Steve ripped the door open and jumped out. He fell a hundred meter, before he safely landed on top of the robot. He slammed his shield between the two steel plates of the neck, hoping to destroy some of the important wiring inside.
‘But it’s still a date, right?’ Tony asked hopefully.
Too late. The guy got up from his seat at the bar and approached Steve. Steve's heart started beating faster as he tried to think about solutions. He could chat with the guy until his policeman showed up. That was the easiest thing to do. But if the guy didn't show up he couldn't reject this man. He would have to take him to his room. Maybe he could show him he was a policeman, to make him leave? Should he have sex with him to keep his cover a secret? They couldn’t force this man to keep his mouth shut. Maybe he was even one of Ronan’s guys. That would be the end of Steve. But Steve still didn’t know what to do when the man sat down on the chair next to him.
‘You’re working on the ambulance?’ he asked. ‘How come I haven’t seen you before if you’ve been here for half a year already? We should have bumped into each other by now, and I’m pretty sure I would have remembered you if we did.’
Or maybe not. He could convince Steve somehow that the ass touching was just another eccentric billionaire thing. That it was his way of paying compliments. That he slapped everyone's asses when they did something good. It had to become a thing!
'I guess I am!' Steve said. 'I've been training this morning, I fed the dogs, made breakfast, and packed my bag. I'm ready to go!'
'Nah man, you're better at the leading thing,' Sam laughed. 'But tell Fury, maybe I can get him to upgrade my salary.'
‘Steve?’ Pepper asked surprised. ‘You look…different.’
Pepper chuckled. ‘You’re forgiven. Steve, take good care of this idiot for me, will you? Have fun tonight, and Tony, I still expect you in my office at ten am sharp! See you tomorrow.’
'You okay?'
Tony walked towards the door and tried the doorknob. It opened without any problems. It took some effort to push it open, since it was heavy, but in the suit it was no problem for Tony.
‘Redwing?’ Steve asked softly, every time he passed a tree or a bush. He didn’t really dare to yell, he didn’t want to disturb people who were enjoying their lunch. ‘Redwing, where are you?’
A guy, short dark hair, a goatee, a leather jacket, ripped jeans and sneakers, kept looking at Steve. Looking like he could just eat him up. It didn't help that he was exactly Steve's type. Sam had noticed it too, because he warned Steve not to look his way anymore.
Steve shook his head as he stood up, thanked the director, took the papers and walked out of the room. It all went so fast that he couldn’t quite grasp what had been going on. He’d get a house, he’d get a new life here, in a world where he knew no one. Almost no one. He knew Tony, and Tony was a genius. He could help him with the contract, with the bike, with catching up. Steve went to his room, put his contract in a bag and went to search for Natasha.
‘Don’t you dare touch my ass,’ Pepper warned.
Steve and his team had thought about it too. The gentleman’s club, Apollo, would be easier. But it was a luxurious club with rich customers, members only, which made it harder for uniformed police to fit it in and help Steve out. Uniformed police officers would act like his customers, so he didn’t actually have to pick up clients and have sex with them. Getting membership cards for several policemen was impossible without Ronan finding out something was up. So drag is was for Steve.
‘Yes, I found some, but I’m not sure if they’re the same type,’ Steve said unsure. ‘I got a few other things as well, just in case, and some tools, so we can actually replace them. Here you go.’
'I admit I love women,' Tony started. 'But this is not classy at all! You didn't even bother to give them a head, or limbs. They only have boobs, that are way to big and misshaped. Have you ever even seen real boobs? Nevermind, you obviously don't know what I like, because I'm not a big fan of fondant, I prefer marzipan. But, most important, you forgot I'm bisexual. If you added some male torso's with nice abs I might have forgiven you for these hideous lady-cakes. Even though I'm more the butt-liking type.'
They stayed in the cave for a while, enjoying the view, before they were told to put their lights back on. They had to peddle their way through the calm water, before it got rougher again and they just had to hold on tight. It ended with climbing back up, carrying the tube, until they arrived at the starting point.
Steve gave Clint a sign. The archer released the arrow he had ready and shot it to the exact place Tony had told him. Tony himself was in position as well. The moment the arrow exploded he use his repulsors to move the falling building in the right direction. He had to use one of his small rockets to give an extra explosions when it seemed to go wrong. Tony saw Steve running out of the way. He dove when the building came crashing down, and rolled to get back on his feet. Steve turned to see if they had succeeded.
‘I agree too,’ Bruce said. ‘Short and simple.’
'Dirty boy,' Tony purred.
‘I don’t know who told you you were useless, but you’re not,’ Clint stated.
'Wait there,' Tony said before he ran down the stairs, through the halls, and into the gardens. The boy hadn't moved.
‘Stop drooling, Pep, I already called dibs,’ Tony said as he entered the kitchen.
'You too,' Natasha smirked. 'Too good for drag.  All muscles, but so feminine. It must be your pretty face. You will get a lot of customers, Stefanie, maybe you should switch careers. You could get rich!'
'Can I please be dismissed, sir?' Steve asked.
Steve sighed as he put his tablet away again. ‘Alright, but just this once, and you owe me!’
'Just walk around, sit down somewhere, make sure you look attractive,' Nebula explained. 'Flirt with the guys, touch their arms, but no kissing. Kissing and everything more intimate must be taken upstairs. You get three drinks per evening, but of course customers can treat you. Don't get drunk though. Alright, so if you got an interested customer, you can take him upstairs. In the corner, behind the curtain, are the stairs, bring them there.'
Tony felt weird, but good weird. A very good  kind of weird.
'Hello there,' he greeted the man. 'What's your name, pretty boy?'
‘You can’t fly there in your suit, Stark,’ Fury said.
'Thank you,' she smiled and there were tears in her eyes.
‘And why would I do that?’ he asked instead.
'I'm Steve,' the small boy smiled. 'See you Saturday!'
‘If you don’t shut up right now I will have some of my agents set up a very difficult boot camp for you for the rest of the afternoon,’ Fury threatened. Nobody dared opening their mouth again, even Steve, who probably wouldn’t have any problems with the boot camp.
‘Please, don’t ever call me trophy wife again, Mr. Dinosaur,’ Steve said, but there was a twinkle in his eye and he could hardly stop himself from laughing.
Lauren couldn't stop laughing. Steve could hear Sam groan in a very frustrated way. His grin only grew wider.
'Make him a cup with your machine,' the blond said. 'Make one for me too while you're at it.'
‘Hmmm, you were right, this is heaven on earth,’ James moaned as he chewed on his pastry. ‘This is delicious. If this place was near my house I’d be here every day and get super fat.’
He must have fallen asleep eventually, because he woke up when an alarm went off. Steve quickly turned it off and sat up. He grabbed some clothes out of his bag and changed as quietly as he could. Tony groaned. Everything hurt.
'I'm here!'
'Steve,' Tony said. 'Could you make a smaller version of our logo, so we can use it on letters? I know I said we'd do everything digital, but apparently we're working together with some very old fashioned companies, who don't understand the concept of a paperless office.'
Tony sat up straight in his bed and looked around. His friends were out of town and no one else had access to his penthouse, let alone his bedroom. Within seconds one of his suits of armor flew into the room and folded itself securely around Tony’s body.
Steve knew almost everything about this man, except his real name. He made everyone call him Ronan. He owned several night clubs throughout New York. They looked like normal clubs, but they were used for selling drugs, money laundering, or illegal prostitution. Ronan had a few dozen guys working for him. Now and then one of them tried to get some money for themselves, or tried to talk to the police, but somehow they always disappeared. Ronan was terrifying, but Steve kept a smile on his face. He was wearing an ear piece, a microphone, and contact lenses through which Sam could see the same things Steve saw. Everything was recorded.
‘I’ll be glad to be back in the field again, director.’
'Make sure you're ready in half an hour,' the lady behind the desk said. 'And can I get your sizes, then we can prepare wetsuits for you.'
'Good questions. Regulars know where to go, but send new clients to the left, down the stairs. There they'll have to pay, they just say who they visited and the guy there can check how long he stayed with you. Computers count how long the door has been closed. When the door closes the clients have to pay 10 dollar. After that it’s 4 dollar per minute. You get 50 per cent.  If you actually start working here, and become popular, it will become more. As for going back downstairs, there is a small bathroom through that door in the back. You can take a quick shower if you want. The more customers, the more money you earn. Just come back down the stairs and mingle with the customers again. Oh, before I forget, threesomes are allowed, but cost extra, and you only do it if you feel like it.'
They ran and ran and ran as fast as they could. Steve held the rope tightly and Tony flapped his arms. He jumped, flapped his arms harder, and fell on his face on the ground. Steve quickly came running back to see if his friend was alright, but Tony didn’t let the bruises stop him. The entire afternoon they ran up and down the hill. Tony didn't fly at all, but they had a lot of fun. They even changed places, to try if they could make Steve fly, but that didn't work either.
The next morning Steve was up early. An agent helped him find his way to the gym and the breakfast hall, in that order. When he was eating toast, eggs and lots of bacon, Clint walked into the room, not very awake yet.
'I will check if that's possible,' Sam said. 'The vans have tinted windows, so once you're inside you're safe from the press.'
‘What about The Avengers,’ Steve said.
Tony felt really nice and warm inside. This amazing guy wanted to see him again too. ‘Okay, great,’ he said, almost relieved. ‘See you Sunday then.’
‘Well, he is nice,’ Steve defended himself. ‘And he doesn’t look half bad. I’m just going to give it a try. I know you’ll be there with a box of tissues and a pile of corny DVD’s if he breaks my heart.’
'We can't take the risk!' Sam said. 'That woman was already suspecting something, we can't continue. Stefanie might get in a dangerous situation.'
'I never really did any weird things, but something strange happened when I was invited by a couple,' Steve told as he changed into his jeans. At the same time he checked Lauren's arms for tattoos. 'It was her fantasy to de done by two guys at the same time. So we did that. Super uncomfortable, but they both finished, so I guess they liked it. I was still hard, so I tried to get it back in my pants, but the guy noticed and asked me if I could do him. Secret fantasy. So I did. The girl comes back with towels to clean up, and gets super pissed. She broke up with her boyfriend while I was still inside. She ran out of the house and disappeared.'
Clint walked into the room and gave the door a little push. It didn’t completely shut, so he still had a little light to see where he was going. He walked to Steve and sat down next to him against the wall.
As he got out of the subway Steve pulled his jacket a little closer around his shoulders. It was cold, the sky was grey, and a soft drizzle soaked his jeans. He knew he should have brought an umbrella, it would be really annoying if he got sick, but at the moment he didn’t care.
When the waitress left Steve remembered that he had to answer a question. ‘You asked how I know Pepper, but I don’t know who or what Pepper is,’ he confessed. Better to tell the truth.
‘At least turn your lights on,’ the archer suggested. ‘I was going to get some food, want to come? Or should I bring you something? I can run and get us some burgers or something. I don’t think you’re ready for sushi yet.’
'No, my old man always insisted that dragons didn't exist, even though I could see them. He insisted it were illusions,' Tony sighed.
'Hope you didn't bet too much, because you're losing!' Bucky said as he popped in.
Buddy took Mauro an Tony back to the front of the room and they looked once more at all bakers and their pastries.
‘Sure,’ James said. ‘I know a really nice play a few blocks away from here. I could text you the address and we could go there.’
With a backpack filled with clothes and make up Steve knocked on the back door of the club, as he was instructed. It took a while before it opened and a young woman with blue hair looked at him.
'Nat, it's okay, they have a job for me, but they didn't know how the wall worked,' Steve said. 'Apparently it's been seventy years and the outside world doesn't know about the anti-aging technology anymore.'
'I only know a thing or two,' Steve said, finishing the wing. 'But I'm an artist. Steady hands.'
Through the white curtains Tony could see a body. He slowly approached the bed, with as little sounds as possible. It was practically impossible in the armor. But the body didn’t move, so Tony thought he was doing fine. He got closer and closer until he could pull the curtains aside. He was about to take a look at, when the person jumped up, turned Tony around and pulled Tony’s arms on his back, holding him tightly.
‘Let’s not think about that too much now,’ Steve said. ‘These pastries are way too good to spoil with bad memories.’
'He didn’t kick you out like he did with us,' Steve complained. 'Oh shit, do you think he heard us talk on our first night here and he saw my... night form? Captain America was his hero and I let him down.'
'Me too! Clint grinned.
‘I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted, because this has been your last date with him,’ Rhodey said as he put some lasagna on his plate.
Tony grinned widely in return. Clint pulled a face.
'It's disturbing, even for you.'
With that said she walked away. As she waited for the elevator she looked back at the two guys in the kitchen and smiled when she saw Tony hugging Steve from behind. Yeah, they were good for each other.
'Impossible,' Steve stated. 'How can anyone steal it when you packed it and will take it back to the U.S.?'
‘Natasha does that to everyone,’ Steve answered. ‘She tried to make me date pretty much all of her friends and only stopped when I told her I was waiting for misses or mister right. She moved on to Sam then, he was single too and he actually enjoyed meeting new people. He has been on a few hundred dates and he is still single. Nat isn’t the best matchmaker in town.’
‘Well, Steve, that sounds amazing, but you’re still soaked, and I wasn’t kidding when I said I didn’t want you to catch a cold,’ Tony answered as he shook Steve’s hand. He didn’t let go.
‘Because you secretly love me, but you’ll never admit it!’ Tony commented in a sing-song voice. ‘But I gotta go now, pumpkin, or I’ll be too late for your date. You can’t make a bad first impression. So, how do I recognize this mystery date?’
He was practically sleeping when the water moved. Tony opened his eyes and found Steve sitting next to him. There were a few others in the pool now, a few kids who were splashing around. Probably the reason why Steve got out.
'We could try again, see if the adoption agency changed their minds. We can totally have a child, we can find a way! If necessary we'll find a woman who will take money to carry our baby. Steve, you know I'll do anything for you. You'd be a great father. I know you would. I love you, Steve.'
‘What are you suggesting?’ Tony asked as he sat down in one of the chairs. It creaked under the weight or the armor.
'Tastes good, but if I ask for pastries I expect something sweet.'
Seconds later the sounds of canons was in the air. The big dragon easily dodged them and let out a loud triumphant roar. He made a circle above the army, breathing fire as a warning, before he made his way to the mountains.
'I'm not,' the man said with a grin. 'Don't worry about it. So, are you an artist or are you part of the collection?'
Steve snorted. ‘Alright, I’ll help you search for your bird. But if I find him, you grow your hair out, so he doesn’t have to make his nest on my head anymore.’
‘Pepper arranged a blind date for me,’ Rhodey sighed.
'It's vacation, I need fluffy beds, great food and sun!' Tony sighed. 'Not a survival camp!'
When Tony finally reached the finish line, Steve was waiting, a big grin on his face. He wasn't sweating, not even panting, while Tony was completely out of breath. He lay down in the grass to catch his breath.
'When we bust in there we'll try to get out the prostitutes separated from the rest of the staff and the clients,' Sam explained. 'We'll talk to all of them and the ones who want to take their story to the court will all get a new identity. The ones who don't are free to go. We'll get a chance to talk to all of them, so there is no need for Tony to get a confession out of another girl. We got all the evidence we needed.'
‘Thank you, Thor, we really appreciate that,’ Steve said. ‘But now that Tony and I are dating I would very much like to be the only one touching Tony’s ass. I know you two are great friends and you have this thing going on, but… I don’t know how to say this. I’m…. a bit jealous, I guess. It’s not that I think you’re trying to steal my man from me, but, well, you understand, right?’
Tony grinned. 'Wow, my reputation is even known on the arctic! But no worries, my boss is the one who's interested in him. I only care about the reward I get when I deliver him safely.'
Steve and Natasha were sparring together. She and Clint helped him to catch up to this new world, but sometimes they needed a break and they would practice their fighting skills, like old times. Clint joined them. It was nice to practice with someone else now and then.
They grabbed their things and headed to the washrooms. Tony let the warm water run over his body. The small stall was kind of dirty, but he immediately felt better. He didn't move for almost twenty minutes, until Steve knocked on his door. He dried off, got dressed and shaved himself. He styled his hair and put on some creams, but he still looked tired. It would have to do for now. He was only going to fix his car anyway, didn't have to look good for that.
