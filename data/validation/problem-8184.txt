“Good bird,” Tony told the last one, silently wishing Kevin was just another cybernetic alien he really could take a whack at.  At least S.I. was doing everything that it could to take down the beast.

Looking at him—unaware that those hands had broken him,
Tony shrugged.  “Take a picture.”

“Why?” Tony asked, honestly flummoxed.
Tony, this Tony's reactor was ten years older and God only knew how deep inside his chest.  Every pressurized shove felt like it would puncture the heart.
A familiar specter appeared in the mirror.  “I promised the Moon, didn’t I?” Tony said.
“Yes, it is,” Steve insisted, sliding the cup to Tony.
“Wrigley Field?”
Steve bit the first rib hard on reflex, but Tony’s growl reminded him of their bargain, and he was more careful with the next bite.
“Thank you for your service,” Tony said, looking up at Clint briefly.  “Your grandchildren will be
Steve sighed, then redirected, “What kind of ice cream?”
“Very good, sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. said neutrally.
I wrestled with the best way to approach this set of stories. In the end, I decided that a continuous narrative worked best, even if it meant, gulp, a new work-in-progress!
Steve stepped towards him, then said clearly, “Tony.”  Tony flinched like he was startled and trying not to show it.  He had always been an open book, but Steve did his best to keep the sympathy out of his tone as he offered up, “On your left.”
“Here we go.”  Tony set a hand on the table, pushed himself upright.  “All right.  Pho time.”  He stood up.
Thor growled ominously.  Tony released the singed toy bear and ducked behind Steve for protection.  Sighing, Steve focused on the immediate problem and said loudly, “Thor.”  The god of thunder snored on.  “
Kneeling next to him, Steve leaned over Tony Stark’s mouth and nose, but there was no warm waft of air.  Steve's blood ran cold.  He
Drifting alone on a boat in the middle of a still ocean, Tony asked dream-Marker,
“You’re welcome,” Steve repeated, more peevishly.  “I’d do it again.”
, he thought, and began to laugh softly.
“Definitely not,” Tony agreed, reaching out.  It was tempting, but decorum pressed him to grip Stovok’s covered wrist.  Stovok did the same for him.  “You’re a crazy sonuvabitch.”
“We’re . . . explorers,” Tony managed, and then the riptide yanked him under, and the world faded out.
“Hm, what?” Tony asked, one hand sliding away to rest on his head.  Steve shut his eyes in contentment.
“You’d think a billionaire could afford shoes,” Tony replied, wiggling his socked feet.
The red stellar cloud loomed.  “Sure we can’t just beam down to the nearest planet?” Tony asked.
“Like hell it will,” Tony hissed, reaching for the Swiss Army knife in his boot, using it to cleave off a strip from his undershirt.  He reached out automatically to brace it against the wound, but Stovok intercepted him, taking the cloth himself and pressing it there firmly.  His expression did not change, but Tony thought he looked paler in the overcast light, almost wan.  “. . . How bad is it?”
Even more defensive, Steve reached for his half-eaten bread.  “Well, we had first aid, too,” he justified, slathering the bread in margarine and refusing to admit that he had holed up in his appointed room and ignored virtually every entreaty to come out.  Not long after, aliens had come knocking down their door.  “We had everything we needed,” he defended.  “I have seen nothing we did not have, only improved upon.”

to procure a meal.  Hellcalves didn’t grow on trees, after all, they grew on hell grass, which grew hellaciously slowly, according to the underlings, who were probably lying to him because they were all just jealous bastards.  Tony suspected he might resemble former King Kevin by the time his own “truly dire, gristly in the extreme, ceaselessly inedible” hell meal arrived.  At least he would be permitted the opportunity to name and slaughter the calf himself.
The reminder that they had been forcefully evicted sat sour on Tony’s tongue.  He accused, “You would not let us stay.  You sent us off-world.  How?”
, he begged, as the monster on the other side of the door knocked again, purposefully gently.  It knew he was here, he thought, repressing a sob.  He had no hope of escaping detection for long, but the agony of being found rippled throughout him, making his skin prickle with spiders.  He just wanted to be safe.  Safe from those claws, the greedy ones, the helpful ones, the ones that wanted at his heart, no matter what.  If he let down his guard, he knew that they would use it to their advantage.

Tony shuffled the deck of cards once, silent, thoughtful, then said suddenly, “What’s your excuse?  Did a pretty girl stand you up?”
Steve was honestly amazed at how politely people of the future handled discord.  Being kicked out used to be rather literal.  Now, it meant a winding tour of the backside of the museum.
“Well, with the way things are going—”
“I am told you are Starfleet’s finest,” Admiral Pierce said.  Tony had read plenty of accounts of Pierce’s brutality, his effective and risky leadership.  Admiral Pierce was often hailed as a hero in the Romulan Wars.  “Graduated not only at the top of

Stovok stood.  For a moment, Tony thought he would Vulcan pinch Thor into oblivion, but steam practically vented from Thor’s open mouth, and Tony knew it would not end well if Stovok tried it.  No, the Vulcan merely nodded away from the open dining hall, and Thor furiously stalked off.  Stovok followed.  Romanova slipped away after them.
Steve expected another stupid inquiry—maybe,
“Thank you,” Steve said, banishing the mental film reel before it could pull him back.  He did not want to think about the War or S.H.I.E.L.D.  They just made him feel cold, icy, lost.
“Tony?” Cap repeated, hand going limp on the case.  Cap did not break the hand of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that grabbed it, but he kept his own grip on the handle, refusing to yield.  Cap’s entire posture tensed in readiness, but he never once looked away from Tony, who swallowed, tried to say,
Sizing up the field, Steve tossed the tennis ball into the air and swung.
“You’ve never seen Earth?” Tony blurted out.
Tony, who could come up with time travel and guide him through it, knew what he was doing—
“What bookkeeping?” Clint asked, materializing behind Tony in a disheveled state, missing one sock and his shirt.
The loneliness of the shore was palpable without Dr. Banner and Stovok to keep him company.  Scowling, Tony kicked at the sand, which was hard enough it felt like kicking a rock.  Cursing, he paced back and forth, refusing to even look at the hole in the ground.
They had arrived.
Hugging another brown alpaca nearby, Tony said, “I love you.  I love you.”  He kissed the alpaca on the cheek.
with undeniable affection.  “Love to meet one’a them,” he said wistfully.  “Not a mean bone in their body.  Probably the nicest monsters to ever live.”
—but even the notion of it, that there might never be another stupid Tony answer to a stupid question of his was . . . disquieting.
Tony slammed his knife into the table.  “

“No.”

A hysterical laugh bubbled out of Dr. Banner, anyway.  Tony understood it, even if the sound sent nails against his spine.  With a barely audible, almost missable sigh, Stovok stepped forward and pinched the good Doctor on the neck.  Dr. Banner’s expression did not have time to register the blow; he simply dropped, limp, and Stovok lowered him carefully to the ground.

that would not materialize into a breakthrough.  It was very irritating.  “So, what, we hail the Klingons, ask them to send back two of Starfleet’s finest, thanks?  Do they accept fruit baskets?”
Stovok sat beside him on the BDR, helmet up, expression unreadable.  “Hardly.”
“And it sparkles.”
“How long you been with S.H.I.E.L.D.?” Steve asked.
“I am only half-Vulcan.”  Sulkily, Stovok looked aside.  Tony followed his gaze; on a nearby shelf, the tribesmen had clustered, chatting among themselves.  Tony did not like to think they were actually going into the heart of the volcano, but, well.  He had also fancied himself one of those people who would live to be two hundred.
Romanova greeted him.  He shut the door behind himself carefully and followed her out to the grass, then walked a ways from the compound.
Tony held his hand in place for a few moments.  Then: “Name your price.”
Bruce shied away from the interrogation, even as he complained, “I didn’t put any—”

“You are mortal and feeble,” Thor said dismissively.  Then he captured Tony in a huge, backbreaking bear hug.  “I shall carry the torch of our adventures.”

Nothing about the rest of their lives was easy, but this was.  This was, Tony sighed, eyes shut, holding onto what mattered.

Steve said, “You’ve been drinking.”
Tony sidestepped closer.  “But they
“Pinch did the trick,” Tony lied, a headache low in the base of his neck.  “And since when did you become an optimist?”
In response, Tony kissed him on the cheek.  Steve sighed.
Tony just grunted, then let out a soft, almost involuntary moan of pain.  Steve rested an automatic hand on his bare shoulder, offering his mute condolences.  Tony said nothing.  Steve expected nothing.
There was a response from the other end of the telephone, but Steve had already moved away.
Steve frowned at him.  “What for?”

Christmas was nice.  Tony got to wear a Santa hat and drink before noon, all while berating Clint for ripping open his presents more violently than a hatchling.  To prove him wrong, Clint let Indium, who had shown up to see what all the commotion was about, sniff a box, then absolutely shred the ugly Christmas sweater Tony had gotten him.  Clint then gave Indium an affectionate head rub, prompting Indium to brush his face furiously against the carpet.

“Hundred-and-thirty-seven, officer,” Clint replied.  “Didn’t mean to disturb your evening—we’re on Avengers business.”
“Mm.”
Tony felt bad for disrupting Steve’s sleep cycle—on Christmas Day, no less—but it was hard to resent the help.  Better than trying to do it on his own.  He heard a series of confused clicks, followed by Steve shushing Marker, who quieted down, only to poke his head in the door, too narrow for his shoulders to fit through.

He turned to his team.  He was sure the fear was written on his face before he managed the words: “What do we do?”
“Lotta words,” Clint insisted.  “Who cares, huh?  Battle of the Egos, gotta have the biggest?”
“Good,” Steve said, tucking the cat into an arm like a Christmas package.  “How much?”  He reached into his pocket with his free hand, producing his wallet.  Rico rubbed his cheek against Steve’s palm, then sank his teeth into it.
Oh, good.  That was good.  Steve nudged him up the cave wall.  Somewhat detached from his own body and all the fear associated with it, Tony observed, “Never pegged you for the handsy type.”

“We must find shelter,” Stovok said, voice drained of emotion but on the edge of tension.  “At once.”
“Exactly,” Tony said, turning back to the wheel.  He shook his head to himself, apparently in real exasperation, and pulled back onto the road.

was supposed to follow, he might be better off sticking with what he knew: tan trousers and non-threatening button-ups.  His own baseball cap felt just as silly as Tony’s sunglasses looked, but at least it almost matched the leather jacket that Natasha had convinced him to wear.
“Yeah, that sounds like dragons.”
Nodding in agreement, Tony said, “Godliness suits me, but so do hot showers.”
“You can’t,” Steve agreed.
He found Steve in the kitchen, looking apologetic and almost nervous, saying, “Tony,” but he did not respond to it.  He kept walking, in a daze, towards the garage.  “What happened?” Steve asked, but he was out of sight and out of mind, as far as Tony was concerned.  “Tony?”
“You don’t—”  Pausing, Steve turned to look at Tony.  “Tony, what’s wrong with you?”
“Yeah.  What’s stopping you from drinking?”

They waited three long seconds.  Then Barton said, “Re-energizing in three . . . two . . . one.”
He did not want to choose between them—he hated the thought of choosing between them and sanity and Tony and whatever blurry insanity was on his mind—but Natasha spared him.  “Volkov boyat’sya—v les ne khodit’,” she said, her voice smooth, smoothing over, as near to forgiveness as he would find.  She stood.

Clint hopped over Tony, bounced to the showroom floor, and bolted.  Steve ground his teeth.  “Let him run,” Tony insisted.  “Maybe he’ll burn off some of that energy.”  After a decidedly long moment, Tony shimmied out of the truck and landed on the showroom floor.  Then he clapped a hand on Bruce’s shoulder.  Startled, Bruce ripped the pamphlet in his hands in ‘twain.  “It’s fine,” Tony said, stuffing the ripped pieces into a pocket.  “Don’t worry about it.”
Never mind the time zone difference.  Five a.m. in Juneau was
Tony made a motion like he was thinking about it, bobbing his head back and forth.  “Counter-offer: no.”
Tony thought about bursting their bubble with a remark about Stovok’s half-Terran heritage, then dismissed it.  It was not his place to share Stovok’s secrets, nor was it his place to undermine their one piece of potential leverage.
Bruce stammered, “It’s—not your—least—”
“You have missed your true calling, Stark,” Thor said, pleased, lowering the disposable camera, turning back the film reel expertly.  “You would make a fine mage.”
Giving up the hunt at last, he flattened a palm over Steve’s shoulder and leaned down, pressing an affectionate kiss behind his ear.  Attentive blue eyes drifted lazily shut for a moment, a tiny victory that felt huge, the final click of repairing a suit.  Then they reappeared, half-mast and content.  Neither impatient nor slow, Steve waited for him to make a move, smiling almost despite himself when Tony rubbed his goatee against his neck, shifting to dislodge Tony.
Natasha smiled.  “The worst for us,” she said cryptically, “may not be the worst for you.”
She stared at him.
Picking himself up off the ground—
Ginger hiccupped a few times, her small body shaking with each one, and Steve vowed again,
“Everyone’s got one.”
Steve grimaced.  “I don’t see how.”
He could not force himself to lower his arm.  The simple act of holding the shield in front of his chest brought a measure of security that words could not.  He did not care if he looked foolish; he was

Tony asked idly, “What’d you say to them?”
Only humans loved dragons.  Dragons did not love them in return.
Assisting with damage control, Steve offered Tony a hand up and helped pick the candles before Thor could eat any more.  Thor still managed to sneak a few into his mouth defiantly, but the bulk made it to the trash.
Tony tried to ask, “Stovok,” but Stovok gave him a meaningful shove and a spear embedded itself directly between them.  “Got it,” he redirected, and bolted headlong after Dr. Banner.

Shaking his head, Steve left him and the dog, following his nose to the cookout in the backyard.

“He broke my hand,” Happy seethed.
The Moon, alone, evaded quieting.  One could always look up and find her, whether it was half or quarter or full.  Steve did not ask where Tony found the key, nor did Steve rebuke Tony for fussing around with the telescope for a while, a tinkerer with his toy.  He looked around the room—barren, like a barrack; a place for one thing, and one thing only—and stepped forward only when Tony snapped his fingers lightly, calling him without a word.
“Give me PORK!” Clint roared from the truck.  Natasha, Tony noted, had spirited away the water jug.
Breathless but unable to help himself, Tony began to laugh softly.

“I appreciate your inquiry,” Thor said, giving him a jovial shake before declaring, “Stark!” and marching over to Tony at the gas pump.  Tony hunched his shoulders before steeling himself, miraculously holding onto the gas nozzle as Thor clasped him in a one-armed hug.  “Your knowledge is prodigious.  Tell me about this William Penn.  Is he like Genghis Khan to the east?”

Actinium walked over to the pool edge, then hesitated.  Steve said, “All dragons can swim.  C’mon.”  Actinium bobbed his head, wiggled on his haunches, and finally tumbled headfirst into the pool.  After a moment, he bobbed to the surface, all four limbs kicking in unison.  “Told ya.”
Steve waited him out.

“I didn’t.”

Tony held up a thumbs-up.  Clint grinned, saluted sloppily, and stepped back around in front of the car, holding up both arms and shouting, “Hey, big guy!  Big guy!”  Thor swung around, hose in hand, and doused him.
“Happy, please,” Tony interjected.  “He’s a national treasure.  Don’t chip the paint.”
“Godspeed, Bruce,” Tony said.  To Steve: “There’s like a fifty percent chance he’ll die.”
Tony held his ground, leaning his shoulder into the door.  The silence dragged on.  He heard his own rasping breath, felt his heart pounding.  He felt, briefly, almost like it was not meant to be known, the handle twist with the simultaneous application of a slightly more rigorous push on the door.  He snarled audibly and shoved it back, hard, sending a message.  There was no possible way to lock it again, not with the handle caught between them, but he did not concede to the inevitable.  He would not give in.
Steve did not deserve to see Tony Stark, so bare, so unnerved.  The armor kept creeping over him, inching to cover everything back up, but through seemingly conscious exertion, he kept it from closing in, trapping tubes and wires.  “Must be exhausting,” Steve noted.

Clint’s new toys were all very interesting, but only in a secondhand way, a compartment of Steve’s mind dedicated to late-night bookkeeping.  The main sector was about as quiet as the Cuban café, which was dusting out its last customers for the night.
Natasha arched both eyebrows.  “If I hadn’t,” she said, “and you had stood there and listened, what would you have thought?”
Reeling, Tony pressed a hand to his head, aching with leftover emotions—fury, and despair, and untidy fear, and so many other things Vulcans were not easy to admit.
The cabin door was locked.  It was early enough that Steve could forgive Bruce and Natasha for not immediately rousing to let them in,
“We’re not,” Steve assured, giving Tony a quelling look.  “Just . . . stopping by.”
“Take a Dramamine,” Natasha advised.
“Then don’t insult my coffee.”  Resting an elbow on the bar, Tony put his chin in hand and complained, “I miss my coffee.”
“Never mind.”
“What for?” Clint insisted.
“Oh, he’ll appreciate it.  Give him a kiss from me,” Tony advised.
“I don’t need it,” Tony replied.
“Ever heard of clue?” Clint asked.
“How about a song?” Bruce prompted diplomatically, as Natasha folded onto the ground beside him.
“Aren’t you supposed to—”
“Sir,” Happy said somberly, “it’s my job to be observant.”  He flicked a glance at Steve.  “What’s your job?”
It felt like forever-and-a-day before they heard the trailing edge of familiar voices.
Ignoring the argument, Thor tipped the jar of M&M’s directly into his mouth.
“Hey,” Steve greeted, relief oozing from his voice.  A small echo of a smile appeared on Natasha’s face as she replied:

Even when Steve did not initiate the contact, he permitted it, a gift in its own right.  Pressing both hands against Steve’s back was like . . . sifting two handfuls of sand through his fingers, or maybe gripping a cool decanter of scotch and watching the liquid swirl in the light—grounding, an undeniably real sensation.  So much input was

” he added, irked, when Steve nudged him again.  Tony pocketed his telephone, then looked around, before shrugging.  “Taking a nice long ride on a park bench, ever heard of it?”
.  He changed the subject: “Are we buying a car or not?”
Coughing, Tony said, “I’m sorry, I must have heard you wrong—”
“Women love me,” Clint announced, standing on the porch, feet shoulder-width apart, holding up a monster salmon in both hands.  “Fish

“I should like to ring the Liberty Bell,” Thor announced, rubbing his hands together.  “Surely, it is time to announce to the people the good news of our triumph against the Chitauri.”
Sitting along with the Nibirans around the great ancestral fire of the sleeping volcano, Tony could not help but think about how strangely familiar the scene felt, like stepping into the caves at Lascaux.  They did not look like exactly like Terrans, but the resemblance was still striking enough that he could imagine them in Terran roles, a society that had no need for starships when food was plentiful and the rules were simpler.  But life propagated.  Life always wanted

Exhaling sharply, Steve leaned back.
“Thank you, prey,” Thor said, taking a seat across from Stovok and Tony, nodding once in acknowledgment.  “Your armor is feeble.”
The concussion had already worn off by the time Clint finished buying him an apology sandwich, ignoring Steve’s insistent claims that he neither wanted nor needed an apology sandwich, and they did not have time for sandwiches because they were supposed to be on a grab-and-go mission, besides.  Clint said, “There’s always time for Cuban sandwiches,” and pulled out a bag of Secret Agent Supply-related goodies.

left unsaid.  “My armor protects me from all danger,” he added, which was . . . not untrue.  In his navy-blue, scaly suit, only his eyes were exposed.  Tony was not sure if the Hirogen species’ claim of immortality was bravado or factual, but he doubted Thor would appreciate him pointing out the potential weakness.
“. . . Enlightening,” Tony decided.  Chief Security Officer James Rhodes gave him a look of deepest exasperation.  “Not that I am not delighted to see you, my red-shirted friend, but I am wondering how you are—”
Steve’s stomach growled.  He hugged Ginger more tightly.
“Know what time it is?”
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Tony replied, “Sure.  Let’s go.  Take a

“And I will make a suit,” Tony assured.  “I’ll attribute the rest to Barton failing to reset your shoulder six times.”
“Not even a hint of a grudge?” Tony asked them, sitting on Stovok’s other side.
“I have never seen Earth,” Stovok said.
Then came the unexpected: Bruce videophoned him, holding up
He tossed it over the cat and tucked the furry burrito back into the fold of an arm.  “About the cat litter,” Steve reminded, in a vague hurry.  He hated leaving Tony alone, no matter how much Tony hated being hovered over.  Tony would have divorced him, already, in writing and everything, had Tony not immediately changed his mind after Steve had volunteered to spend the night at Sam’s, as a sort of compromise.
“Are you sure?” the clerk asked.  “Rico’s a bit—”
“Who said we were stopping here?” Tony replied, tapping at his telephone.  He had a thin blanket draped over his legs.  Steve had the pronounced urge to ask if Tony knew that Alaska was a cold-weather territory.
“Welcome aboard, Hirogen.”
“Nah, the Zoo’s closed.  I’m sorry, pal,” Steve explained, indicating the closed gates outside the Lincoln Park Zoo.  “Guess we’ll have to come back another day.”
Steve scowled.  “Look, Tony, just because I’m going along with this—this cockamamie plan of yours doesn’t mean—”
“The universe is dangerous,” Sojef went on, but his calm tone was at odds with his message.  “It is a rather horrible place.”

“Very good, sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. interjected.  “If I may—”
Honestly, if Tony thought he would feel better with brute force on his side, he was wrong.  He really, really, really liked the Mark XX.  He did not want Steve Rogers, drugged out of his

Iron Man continued to shake, angry or in pain or simply cold, Steve did not know.

This.
Clint ate his ice cream with a fork.  That was about all that needed to be said about it.
With a sigh, Steve set his empty coffee aside and got up.  He opened the door.  Clint Barton tackled him.
“Good.”  Tony kept his eyes on the road, but Steve felt the weight of his judgment.
Not one of them had the heart to stop him.  Tony did say, “If we set a forest on fire, let it be known, I said—”  He perked up when Bruce set a plate of cake in front of him, evidently forgetting his ire.  “About fucking time.”
Not right now, I’m not, Tony thought, staring at him in disbelief and dread, because he
It was like entering a dream.  One moment, Tony was seated on a bench beside Stovok; the next, Tony was standing across from him in a strangely lit launch bay.  Tony lifted a hand to blot out the bright white lights, but this was Stovok’s memory; they persisted, muffling the ranked soldiers on every side, in formation.  Stovok stood apart, looking younger and far less daunting in his all gray military uniform, the gold command stripes visible on either shoulder.
“I do not know,” Stovok said.  “I am unfamiliar with their kind.”  He stepped forward.  At Tony’s disbelieving squawk, he explained, “I must perform further investigations.”
He heard movement and there,
“’ey, Cap,” Clint said, chucking the tennis ball at him.  Steve caught it, too.  Tony whistled behind him.  Steve ignored him, getting a feel for the bat.  He had grown up with stickball, but he could rip car doors off their hinges, now.  He had to be careful.
As expected, it shifted the conversation away, some of Tony’s openness shuttering abruptly.  “Well, of course not—if we were all rich, none of us would be,” he sniffed.  He stood up and left the bar.

“I shall,” Thor, son of Odin, peacekeeper of the Hirogens, said cheerfully.  “’Til our paths next cross, prey.”
“You, uh,
“What is that?”
“I want a real answer.”
As if Steve was holding him down.  Steve leaned back, halting briefly at the slice of pain that cut deep into his own torso, a gift from the Chitauri.  Then he said, “Let’s get you up.”

“You ever had an Andorian beer?  I’ve heard it’s the only way to fully actualize one’s highest self.  Or maybe just get shitfaced without the hangover.”  He rubbed the side of his neck automatically, forgetting the spacesuit between his fingertips and his actual skin, where the hypo-spray had taken the edge off the Saurian brandy.  Modern miracles: all the carnal pleasures without the carnal aftermaths.
Standing nearby with Gerald’s and Sweetie’s leads in hand, Tony said, “. . . You jumped in the Niagara

, in the past tense.  All he had wanted to learn was the most relevant, applicable data.  And to his relief, not much had changed in almost seventy years.  Not much at all.
“You know, what’s your number, wow-mine-too, let’s fuck.”  Tony hiccupped once, then toyed with the glass again, almost brought it to his lips before feinting at the last second.
Forsaking humanity’s dire warnings, Thor had climbed over the safety railing and found refuge on a large rock, enjoying the magnificence without interference.  A mere mortal in his own right, Steve had no authority to rebuke him, no doubt that Thor could survive the hellish plunge, should he fall.  Steve also had no fear whatsoever that Thor would fall.  Gods made no missteps, only unplanned diversions.
Steve drew in a long breath.  Preparing to give a speech.
, he thought suddenly, leaning back against a rocky outcropping, taking in the scene, four men braced against the elements.
. o .
He did not need to.  After a few moments, Marker alighted in front of him, flapping his wings.
“Of course you would.”  Shaking his head, Tony said, “C’mon, big fella, we got a starship to talk to.”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., what time is it?”
“Shawarma,” Tony reminded, unfolding his arms and pointing at Steve, apparently for affirmation.  Steve did not grant it.  “It counts.”
,” Pierce called back, matching his tone, and all the extra hands around the case suddenly vanished.  Tony gripped it firmly, annoyed and unsettled.  “I thought you were assisting with search-and-rescue."
In his dreams, Tony walked alongside Marker through a desert, one hand on Marker’s golden hide.  They had long conversations, talking about the weather and the future.  In an accent so thick with his clicks and warbles they nearly overshadowed his words, dream-Marker responded to him.
“Shut up,” Tony told him, signing Steve’s wrist in marker with
“A lollipop?” Thor repeated uncomprehendingly.  “I do not under—”  He paused to watch Clint pedal across the tarmac, yelping loudly:
“Dumb idea,” Tony interjected.  “You’re clearly who they want, why send you in alone?”  He tossed the keys at Clint, who caught them.  “Anything goes
Steve had to know.  He had to be sure.
“That’s great, buddy,” Tony said, sensing an opportunity as he stepped forward and grabbed Bruce’s arms.
,” Steve said, voice creeping into an indignant higher register, genuinely affronted.  “All I did was ask, and you practically hung up on me.”
Tony pulled up sharply enough to startle Bruce out of his feigned rest.  “We’re here?”
Tony met his gaze in the rearview mirror.  “You got two hundred dollars?”
He tried the handle; it opened.  Pushing the door open, he was equal parts surprised and amused to see Tony still sound asleep.  Steve almost closed the door on reflex, then rallied, reminding himself,
“I’m sorry you’re hurting, Tony.”
Closing his eyes, he imagined for a moment that he was
“Yes.”
“A true what?” Clint asked.  “Sprite?”

“That’s gratitude for you,” Sam teased.  “Happy birthday, by the way.”
A rancid thought occurred to Steve, unexpected, unwelcome:
Tony glared a hole into the table, then sighed.  “Nobody’s got the kind of love you’ve got to give,” Tony insisted.  “It gives out, somewhere.”
Stovok unveiled his discovery at the base of the mountain.
Steve walked on, not rising to the bait.
“I still don’t see what you get out of it,” Steve murmured, looking like he could lie there forever, a marble statue made man.

Ignoring the two guest bedrooms, Steve proceeded straight to the master.  “Tony?” he repeated a third time, worry entering his voice as he observed the messed-up bed, the wreckage of a frustrated man.  “Are you hurt?”

Stovok said calmly, “I have nothing to begrudge.”

The gas gauge—handy, that; old cars used to make drivers guess how much gas was left—was still solidly above the “E for Empty” line, but it was nice to get out, stretch his legs, put some miles back onto the meter.
“No, but I have a door I can escort you to.  There’s been a misunderstanding.”
A handful of cards landed on the table.  Clint swiped up his monetary reward with a luxurious
“It’s fine,” Tony said.  “I’ve been meaning to replace my cherished Audi with an even more cherished Audi.”
Thor sighed deeply, retracting his arm.  Steve privately resolved to find a way for him to exercise that hunter’s instinct, all while marveling at the artistic rendering of a red-and-green
There was a shaking of keys sound.  Clint immediately let go of Thor and turned to Natasha, who held up the keys.  When she tossed them his way, he yelped with real joy and took off for the car.
“Captain America kicks bears,” Clint agreed, adjusting the line.

“I do not,” Stovok said.
Steve thought, as Dorothy appeared on-screen, alongside her beloved—“Toto,” he said out loud, remembering Natasha’s clue:
“Well, we have four up for sale, if you’d like to see—”
, but when it comes to you, I’m out of my fucking head.  I just. . . .”  He shook his head.  “I’m happy for you.”
A knock came on the door.
“That’s the one,” Tony said, not bothering to correct,
from the hell hole before pulling out his cell phone and calling the bastard.
“You look tired.”
whispered a terrible little gremlin that lived inside his skull.
Steve picked up his shield from the floor.  “A little mystery’s good for the soul, Barton.”
He started to walk, Natasha matching his pace.  Thor lingered at the scene, looking back at Steve, as if to ask,
“Then it won’t come true.  You told me,” Tony pivoted.
“Don’t talk to her like that.”  Steve didn’t know he had a voice like that inside him, but the thought of either of his new teammates—and they were a team, damn Fury, damn S.H.I.E.L.D., damn it all—blowing each other’s tops off was enough to flip a switch inside him, erasing the fatigue, leaving only cold, stony command in its place.  “You don’t talk to her like that.”
Steve actually huffed once in amusement, continuing to plate cookies.  “Nope.”
“And, this is cooking, which means,” Tony reached for the bag of brown sugar, but Steve was quicker on the draw, “

Grimly, Tony turned one set of lights back on.
Wet cat in towel, Steve admitted, “I am in a bit of a hurry.”
Steve, who had been passing the long boards carefully up to the roofers, sauntered over to tell Tony, “That takes all the fun outta it.”
“We were more than friends,” Stovok said, pacing out the words.  “We were. . . .”  Then he commanded, “F.R.I.D.A.Y., resume.”
The car fell conspicuously silent.

“Ey, Cap’s here!” Clint brayed, manning the grill.  “’Bout damn time.”  Sitting in a foldout chair nearby, Bruce lifted a beer in tentative acknowledgment.  Steve nodded at both of them, then sniffed distinctly at the aromatic grill.  “Lucky get Stark?” Clint asked.
Sniffing, Tony said, “Nice to know I’m still needed.”
Tony nodded briefly.  He did not move out of his own huddle, but Steve wrapped both arms around him, big monster claws turned gentle as they held him together.
, then scrambled to vacate the premises so Tony could sulk properly.

Nevertheless, if transposed onto the densest population center in the United States, the entire city of Juneau, Alaska could fit comfortably within 1.1 square miles of New York, New York without altering the existing demographics.

Bruce blinked once, nursing an entire tankard of ale.  Natasha said with familiar congeniality, “You look like you have a truly terrible idea, Stark.”
Tony shut his eyes, feigning sleep.
“I will take no orders from you!” Thor roared back.
.  Stovok looked hardly a day over twenty-five.  Which, if he had gone through proper enlistment and completed his officer's track, placed him around a real age of around eight-six.  Still fairly young for a Vulcan—only a third of the way through his life cycle.
At least if he had to be stranded anywhere in time, he got stranded with Tony Stark.
Steve had never been a politician.  Steve had never desired to be a politician.  But accepting Erskine’s magic meant accepting a life beyond his wildest dreams—and that included playing the game.
“Cap!” Clint greeted, nearly overturning his little table as he leaped from his chair and tackled Steve in joyful reunion.
“. . . Just how fast does word travel on this ship?”
Steve looked at her frankly.
“This used to be the ugliest outpost in the Federation,” Tony went on, waving his brandy freely, careful not to spill it.  “Can you believe that?  Used to rain three-hundred-and-sixty-five days a year.  Which is amazing, because Risian years are only two-hundred-and-eighty-days long.”  Snickering at his own joke, Tony took an ill-timed sip of brandy.
“The ripple effect will be minimal?  I agree.  It seems that, at worst, you have become . . . part of their mythology.  Starfleet doubts even you would risk your reputation within the Federation to capitalize on it.”

Steve said grimly, “Great.”
.”  And then, despite his burning lungs and exhausted legs, he pushed himself to his feet.  He flicked on his own tricorder beacon, which clicked softly in the right direction.
“Don’t hurt yourself,” Steve advised dryly.  He finally wrapped an arm around Clint’s middle and pried him off the hammer, which clung to the pavement.
“Whales, right?”
“I’m not scared of you,” Tony told her.
Tony actually laughed at that.  “

Aside from the refrigerated rooms in Tony’s sprawling estate, there was little hint of it, outside.  The southern coast of California rarely saw snowfall, unlike the mountainous terrain in Utah.  Only Actinium preferred the sandy shore.  Even Thallium, who followed Tony most places, retreated to spend time with Marker or Snow after short exposure to the sun.

“Yeah.  Yeah, he did.”  Steve toyed over the idea in his mind, but it seemed more like a dream than a real proposition.  He shook his head slowly.  “I don’t know.”
“Mm.”
“Damn,” Tony said, hands off the wheel, examining Clint’s phony passport with admiration.  After five collective hours in the same vehicle, it no longer bothered Steve that Tony did not seem to need both hands on the wheel to drive.  But, after taking a plunge in the Niagara River, he was not sure it would have bothered him even if Tony
Still seated on his high perch, Thor gave a gracious half-bow, one arm folded around his tunicked stomach.  The crowd tentatively applauded, led, Steve noticed, by the museum staffers, who appeared to want to convey an impression of having total control over the situation.  Some of the outlying members of the crowd broke away to explore the rest of the museum, but the majority remained, evidently awaiting to see what might happen next.
Clint clapped, then shouted, “Encore!” while Tony urged:
Admiral Fury inclined his head.  Commander Stovok stood at his shoulder, while Captain Carter sat at the helm.  “I was,” Fury acknowledged.  “But three of my best men have been missing for six weeks.”
Tony swiveled around the support beam until he was hugging it upside-down.  Steve’s heart began to gallop.  He shouted, “Tony!” but Tony let go.
“Indeed,” Stovok replied, stepping on shore, looking neither cowed nor discouraged.  He took a seat.  Tony and Romanova followed suit.  “You were speaking of immortality?”
Tony made a disgusted sound, then shook his head.  “No,
Clint laughed so hard he doubled over.  Bruce just made a mournful sound.

Releasing the board, Iron Man took two steps back.  Then, with a soft hiss, Tony Stark stepped out of the suit.  “OK, let me at him,” Tony said, holding out his arms.
It was surprisingly sweet, like a Terran coconut, with an edge of something creamy that only enriched the overall taste.  He decided,
“Dammit, Tony,” Dr. Bruce Banner spat.  “
“I can fix that.”
Sighing, Steve tucked an arm around him, pulling him closer.  Tony grumbled but went with the movement, which told Steve exactly how desperately he wanted it.  Tony, vulnerable, tended to shut down even harder, running off to be alone.  That he would reveal his hand
Thor brayed with belated laughter, standing up and declaring, “Behold—your king triumphs before you!”
With slightly more speed than Steve would have expected, Tony chucked the pillow at him.  Steve still caught it, but it was close.  Then Tony folded himself onto his front with a grunt, reaching around and grabbing one of the remaining pillows, using it to cover the back of his head.
9:17 P.M.
—” Tony began, then scrambled, nearly knocking over a shelf in his hurry to get out of the way, as something came alive near the floor.
Steve had tried, in the early days, to allay Tony’s suffering, to comfort him during his most tormented moments.  But the bitter truth was, Steve was merely a participant in Tony’s life, capable only of bearing witness, not acting with divine mercy.  He could not accelerate the healing process, and Tony did not want him to bear witness.
Steve took the advice for what it was worth, ignoring Tony until he saw the lights from a small gas station.

Thor hummed, an ominous sound, like he was considering calling lightning down to strike them all down.  Steve would not have put it past him, although it would’a made one hell of an obituary:
Tony merely sifted through his handful of cards, looking up at Bruce, whose eyes were just visible over the edge of the table.
“Where’s Doctor Banner?” he asked automatically, looking around.

“Ahhhh,” Thor said with a twinkle in his eye.  “A bargain, you strike?”  He reached into his own pocket and produced a flask.  “Asgardian’s finest, aged for a

Sighing, Steve said, “I guess you could say that.”
“Yes,” Tony affirmed.
“That’s without stops,” Tony added.  He met Steve’s gaze in the rearview mirror.  “I’ve allocated one rest stop.”

Tony waited.  Then he prompted, “To?”
Steve was right, of course—Marker’s hide, unlike Snow’s, bore short spikes, too stubby to grip.  Flying with him required ropes and a strong grip, under the best of times.

Tony arranged himself artfully on the bench.  “We both know you can finish that report later,” he simpered.
“Portland,” Tony repeated.
Oh, hell.  He was having a heart attack.
“You dyed your hair,” Steve pointed out.
Tony reached for the bucket, plucked another strawberry off the top, shined it on his cardigan.  “So, selfish is

“We could,” Barton said brightly, “but you and your spacesuit would have to travel separately.”
Steve continued vacuuming the kitchen floor.  Tony spotted the power cord and gave it a good tug, yanking it out of the wall.  The vacuuming ceased.  Steve went still.
Given Tony’s zeal for mornings, Steve had pretty low expectations for what he would find upstairs.
Desperately afraid, Tony gripped his own collar, fingers trembling and cold.  He would not allow them to hurt him.  He had refused service for as long as he possibly could, begging Rhodey not to give into his own monster, the one that would say,

“There are signs of habitation on the mountain,” Stovok said coolly.  “It is against Starfleet regulation to make contact with primitive races, as per the Prime Directive.”
Steve ignored him, surveying the chaos grimly.  Front-and-center, wearing his full armor, was Thor Odinsson, heroically playing the plastic guitar, churning up an uproar of applause from the television.  Steve felt a headache come and go in less than ten seconds.

Steve huffed—in derision, in disbelief, “you call it tomato, I call it tomato”—then looked down as Natasha held out the shield to him.  When he reached for it, his fingers trembled.  He hesitated, then committed to the task, closing the distance, bringing the old girl closer.  The shield was light and warm, more like a blanket than a gun.
Natasha never took her eyes off Iron Man.  Steve was grateful; had she turned away, he worried Tony Stark would be
Next round, though, next round, Steve quickly slipped off two ribs before Thor even noticed they were there, triumphantly gnawing on them.  Tony just shook his head in wry amusement, picking up a stack of cards in one hand and a glass of scotch whisky in the other.
Who knew: maybe the calf would usurp him and claim the throne.  That would be a bit of a scandal, wouldn’t it?  Hell could use a bit of a shake-up.  That was what Tony was doing.
. o .
“Are they for sport?” Thor asked politely.
He didn’t know why it mattered, as all of it—every beat of it, from the moment the Director introduced him to the strange new world to the time when aliens began raining down from the sky—had to be a fever dream.  A green Mr. Hyde and a Norse god working side-by-side to reclaim the Hydra weapon for forces of good, not evil?  Delirium.  He had no stake in this world, not really, yet he followed the Black Widow—infamous killer of men—deeper into Stark Tower, all while the turncoat assassin greeted Nick Fury, “Think we might’ve killed your boy.  Send the WSC our regards.”

The Zoo had officially been closed for more than an hour, but the hog keeper said, “Oh, we have special events that run late, they’re fine,” when Steve worried about how disruptive they were being to the animals’ evening routine.
“Sure thing, big guy,” Tony said, back to sulking in his arms, apparently.  “Can somebody turn the grill off?”
Chicago.
“Are there
“The world wants you back,” Rhodes admitted, three days before Christmas.  “It probably even needs you.”
Tony rasped, “J.A.R.V.I.S., lights out.”  As the room dimmed to near-perfect darkness, an ethereal blue glow smoked out from underneath the thin blankets, radiating from the center of Tony’s chest.
Tony struggled not to sprint down the rocky pathway, moving quickly, ignoring the indignant clicks and whistles behind him.  He felt energized and lazy at once, capable of swimming to the bottom of the ocean—or lying in the cold sun with his new Nibiran family.  He used the boost to carry him across the rocks, carefully
It surprised Steve that, even as he all but frog-marched Bruce to their penthouse suite, Steve did not think about slipping off his own shoes and joining him in another room.  Downstairs, Thor remained relentless, sitting in a hotel lobby chair across from Natasha, engaged in a spirited if one-sided conversation with Natasha about the nocturnal festivals on Asgard.  Tony stood nearby, rocking back and forth on his feet, like a paperweight bird that someone had pressed into motion and forgotten about.  Looking for that second wind, Steve mused, wondering if Tony was still rocking as Bruce flopped face first onto the bed.
And it
Tony offered him a fleshy coconut.  “Try this.”
Tony snorted eloquently into the mattress.
Tony reminded himself to breathe.
Tony slid around the bench, posing with his feet in the air behind him and chin resting in triumphant hand.  “Hi, Brucey.  Want a threesome?”
He felt tempted to sit on the rocks and let himself have his fill for a while, at least until he could settle in his mind the precise shade of blue above him, but the others were already moving on, Natasha’s back disappearing into a fissure broad enough to walk sideways through.
They both shared a look.
Tony skidded into home plate, breathing hard but literally glowing with triumph, arms stretched out, blue light bright under his shirt.  “Two-nothing!” he exclaimed.  “Two-nothing!”
“Feeling homesick?”
Hill shrugged.  “Didn’t seem worth the risk.”
Steve was missing.  Steve was missing, in a
With fuller bellies and good spirits, they set off for Mendenhall.
“A day trip, then,” the undeterrable Tony Stark decreed.
it’s in two weeks,” Tony replied, carrying the circular argument.  He peered one eye open at the clicking noise nearby, a blue-tinted face looking back at him.  “Tin-Tin, you’re getting coal for Christmas.”
“Oh, you’re well past that.”
Tony squinted at it, but it was too dark to make out.  Then he saw them, a cluster of cloaked figures, one of whom seemed about half a head shorter than the rest.
“. . . Are you
Tony did not speak until they reached the living quarters.  Then he followed Stovok down the hall, ignoring his own fatigue as Stovok led them all the way to the officer’s quarters.  As a mere consultant—his formal title was “Commissioned MTESC,” which boiled down to professional Multi-Tasker—he had private quarters, unlike the Ensigns, who had to double up, occasionally quadruple up, if they were unlucky enough to get bunk beds.  But his paled next to the space room Stovok led him into.  “Wow,” he said, out loud, looking around the blue-toned room, taking in its utter lack of personal touches.  “Love what you’ve done with the place.”
“We’re gonna be on the national news,” Clint said, awed.  Then: “You think he can make it over the edge?”
I adore you lovely people. Thank you! Truly, from the bottom of my heart. 🐼❤️
“Don’t delay,” Cap Bird told the camera grimly.  “Get your Kevin shot . . . today.”
—Tony said, “Sure, yep.  Pip, pip.  Take us down, Bird Man.”
.”  He neglected to mention his own disbelief in divinity.  It all seemed—rather palpably irrelevant.  Like saying he did not believe in other religions.  They still existed.  Whatever strange concoctions his mind cooked up were just—part of it.
Steve hung back, by the door.  The room was dark.  There was no blue light in Tony’s chest to illuminate the space.
—Tony said dourly, “No.  Take it off.”
Tony paused mid-bite.  “Are you
He was simply . . . beloved.  Exactly as he was.
Grimly, Tony gripped Stovok’s uniform and resolved to outlast the cold night and its singing tribesmen.
“This is for his life,” Steve entreated whoever was listening.
.  Easy answer, there, but he still wanted to hear what Steve had to say.
Steve nodded once, then looked him over.  “Do I know you?”
“Thor would’ve made it.”
“Hipster capital of the world,” Clint said.
to be with people, to connect with them on a personal level, but his body rebelled, reminding him that every jerk in the crowd would have kicked him into the dirt, once upon a time.
Steve lingered briefly on the Dodo, imagining Thor attempting to rotisserize it, before shaking his head in mute wonder and following Tony and Bruce down the hall.
to anybody.  Not even slightly.  Don’t even think about it.”
, even as the mission said—“Starved, actually.”
“Likewise, Ensign Barton,” Commander Pointy replied.
.  As it was, he just made a vague, wordless noise, and the elder frowned.
“You ever seen the Falls?”
“Thank you, Captain.”
“Now I feel like it would be redundant to stop,” Steve said, after Clint had recited the three-hundred-and-twenty-one best things to do in Chicago.
Tony moved obligingly off to one side, flopping down on the bed next to him, enjoying the space.  Steve blinked at him once, gaze flickering over him from head to heel.  Effortlessly pretty, Tony thought, feeling almost soporific, comfortably at rest.

“I hate walks,” Tony complained, kicking at a cluster of loose pebbles on the dirt road, very aware of the motorcycle parked ten paces away and the invisible line playing out between them.  “Why did you bring me here?” Tony prodded.
“It is,” Tony insisted.  “Can’t use the full name, R1D1 is still here,” he said, indicating the golden dragon curled up in the corner, fast asleep by the fire.
They all sat with that for a moment.  Tony looked around the room: at Dr. Banner, seated on a couch, hands anxiously in front of him; and Rhodes, beside him, also nursing a mug of untouched tea; and Hill, opposite both of them in a cushioned armchair.
After a full thirty seconds, Nick Fury said: “
Steve looked at her, the picture of calm, and asked, “Used to what?”
, Tony thought, and picked up a cluster of grapes to watch the show.
Marker did not respond.  At once, at all, ever—because dragons did not bond with humans.
“When Snow left,” Tony rasped, his voice breathless, his battered body resisting the exertion, “how did you survive?”
They just sat and waited as the smell of cookies permeated the air, and the heartbeat of the world ticked on, and something good and easy brewed between them.
On he went.  Steve tried to absorb it all, but his brain kept tripping over its own tape files, rerunning certain clips.
.  So why don’t
Steve said, “Ha-ha,” automatically, the absurdity of the statement so appalling that it triggered his
Tony did ask around the fifth or sixth or maybe seventeenth chant: “So, which one gets the lollipop?”

He gripped the wall with one hand.  This was it.  No way home, no way out, nowhere to go.
For once in his life, he fell in line.
. o .
Iron Man looked at him stoically.  “See, that’s not the thing I want to be thanked for,” he said at last.  “Hold onto me.”
That got him going: Steve had only to walk and nod while Thor relayed his experiences with a rather large assortment of horrifying creatures on faraway worlds.  He had bested all of them in combat, although he did not shy from admitting, “It was on my third encounter with the Ak’ak’chu’la’for that I prevailed over it.”  Steve saw him look at the informational placards with a zeal that almost matched his own, absorbing every word with interest.  “I was under the false premise that Midgard was devoid of monsters,” Thor admitted, which almost made Steve feel guilty for not explaining the obvious:
Steve slid effortlessly into the gap.  Tony made a small noise of despair.
“Don’t delay; get your Kevin shot . . . today,” Iron Man said with an audible sigh.
His soul ached.  It was not merely his heart or his chest or some bodily organ; but something much deeper, much more resounding.  It physically hurt; he wondered, idly and not fearfully, if the ache would kill him.
“That’s you,” Tony said, pointing at him.
, “What isn’t?  What isn’t broken in this body?”  Already out of steam, he let his arm sag, and Steve reflexively, almost without thinking at all, slipped under his slumping arm, propping up the metal man.
. o .
“If you ask nicely, she’ll let you feed the hogs,” Tony interrupted.
Tony seemed floored by the remark, genuinely leveled, in a way that Steve felt strange witnessing.  Before he could rise to Tony’s cautious defense—
“You mean Romulan blood?”  Thump.  Thump.  Thump.  “That copper stuff that flows through your veins, Cadet?  And what does it tell you?  What sort of warmongering do these people thirst for?  What sort of war do
“Food.”
Steve stared at the telephone.  Tony plucked it out of his hand, arching his eyebrows expectantly.
.  Tony waved a hand dismissively, shuffling off into the kitchen.
With a very odd laugh, a sort of start-stop inhale, Iron Man managed, “You touch me, I’ll knock your fucking head off.”
Tony Stark was antsy again.
J.A.R.V.I.S. did chime in, “Good one as always, sir.”
Magnanimously full of hot wings—and hot wing bones, as it was a rare day when Steve could piss off Tony Stark half as much as Tony Stark pissed him off—Steve took in the sights of the city, the unfamiliar sounds and smells.
over to its rightful owners,” Pierce growled.  The lack of geniality was thick; Pierce's blue eyes were nearly black as he stared at the unyielding face of his newest challenger, who looked back just as malevolently.
And he joined Tony, at last, in sleep.
“Your aversion to authority is well-documented,” Stovok replied dryly.
Tony shrugged.  “We came, we saw, we—”  He paused as their otherworldly companion looked back at them expectantly.  “Perhaps we should talk about this later.”
Whining audibly, Tony pointed with the eggbeater.  “
“If you’ll excuse me,” he said, when his head felt full of overlapping conversations, when it would have been a disservice to sit at the table any longer.  “I’ll just be a moment.”

The same loud, upbeat music as before resumed.
Tony stared at the blank telephone.  “Did he just
“. . . No.”
,” Tony hissed.  “Just—shut up.  For five minutes.”
“Pickup lines?” Steve said, feigning ignorance, torn between morbid curiosity and future blackmail.  A slightly more sober Tony might have called him out on the lie, but the distracted, head-nodding version merely said:
Do you know what this means?”
“Little lukewarm, dear,” Iron Man critiqued, one leg jaunted over the other in the director’s chair.  “Is this the

“My question precisely.”
Stovok went rigid.  For a horrible moment, Tony thought he would be boldly tossed aside.  Then Stovok calmed himself, his limbs loosening up again, allowing him to remain.  “I am electing to ignore your provocation.”
“Kiss your wife?”
“. . . All the food in the world, and your favorite is—”

business,” the cop repeated.
Dolefully, Bruce got up and came over.  “Now, don’t you hurt him,” Steve warned, as Tony hopped down and bear-hugged Bruce from behind.
“Aye,” Thor agreed, laughing when Tellurium suddenly jabbed him in the knee.  “I like this one!” he repeated.  “She is spirited.  A true
He did not feel small against the Falls.  He felt weirdly alive, out of space and out of time.
With a beleaguered groan, Tony swiped a broomstick leaning against the wall and approached.  “Drop the vac, Cap.”  He prodded Steve in the back with the business end of the broom.  The clicking stopped.

Tony had come to a haranguing halt in front of Bruce, who was sitting cross-legged in the field with an entire gallon of cider, looking dolefully up at Tony like he wanted nothing more in the world than the power to turn invisible.  “What?  Why are you looking at me like that?” Tony was saying.
I think that covers all the notes! Hope you liked it, next chapter will be PACKED. Thanks again for reading!
“Your optimism is as inspiring as it is misplaced.”
“No,” Steve said shortly, liberating the knife from Tony’s grasp when he swung his arm back to make the throw.  Steve then used the same knife to spear a hot dog off the grill and take a big bite.  “That’s my wish, no arterial bleeds.”
“Stay,” Hulk grunted, which was so surprising Steve’s jaw dropped.  The laughter ceased abruptly from the peanut gallery.  Then Hulk smashed his fist on the ground again.  “Heeeeere.”

Clint seemed almost immune to the alpacas.  He made detached observations and patted them if they came near but otherwise avoided them.
Tony struggled out of his chair.  Snow clicked.  Steve held up both hands, approaching her, careful of those huge, gutting horns.  “It’s okay,” Steve said.  His skin was as white as her scales, but he caught her horn to prevent it from impaling him as she sniffed at the bandages on his neck.  “It’s okay,” he repeated.
“Come back to me,” Tony said.  Steve looked at him, held onto his gaze, let him come into focus, because the rest was entangled, unknown, impervious, and wretched, but Tony was

looked.  He had never made the mistake of writing actual notes, but it was still a window into his soul.
Steve took a seat at the table, casting a rebuking look at Natasha, who looked unfazed.  Bruce had almost succeeded in shrinking out of sight when Steve netted him verbally: “Dr. Banner.”  Bruce winced but peered up at him dolefully.  “What is this?”
Floored, Tony frowned at him.  Rogers elaborated softly, “Almost lost you twice today.”  Clearing his throat, he looked down at their hands.  “I’m sorry.”
“Nah.”  Tony scratched lightly at the back of his neck.  Steve melted for it.  “You got time.”
“I can’t,” he said, and he meant to explain,

Stovok liberated it.  “Captain Carter will appreciate your compliance,” Stovok said.  He swished the brandy once, then sniffed at it.  “I was under the impression high-quality spirits were reserved for special occasions.  Saurian brandy is not for the weak of heart.”
Shaking his head, Steve said, “Bruce, get the knife,” and Bruce took off like a shot, somehow both falling and not-falling out of his chair.
“Oh, it’s not all about you,” Steve cajoled, deflecting the elbow Tony tried to throw into his gut easily.  “Don’t be such a spoilsport.”
“I hate you,” Tony snipped.  Then, when Steve shifted, no doubt to try and free himself, Tony backpedaled, “I take it back.  I take it back.  Please don’t leave.”
They left together.  That brought Tony a measure of peace.  They left together, as brothers.
