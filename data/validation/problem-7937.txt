"I do, Tony. I really do."
They'd had only a handful of encounters where things had gone even half as well. Tony should run away before he ruined it, but... he also never wanted it to end.
Thanks so much for all of your lovely comments!! They really make my day. <3 Many thanks also for reading and I hope you enjoy!
"Are ya hurtin' now?" He brushed his fingers through Tony's hair, pushing some of the lanky strands back so he could see the man's expression better. "I need ya ta tell me if ya are. I'm not gonna leave ya, promise, but we can find better ways ta lay down, ones that won't hurt ya so much."
"That's Tony."
Ah. Yes. Well I-- I've brought along someone to--
? Let them hover around outside until someone noticed they were there? Engage lethal countermeasures to keep them away? Alert the UN?
"I've been working on something," Harley broke in, grinning with his eyes lit up. He looked so excited, so eager... he hoped this had been the right choice. Rhodey and Danvers would have ideas and limits that would keep his kids safe, he knew it. They would hash out a plan to make sure any Junior Avengers were trained and protected as they developed into full grown superheroes. Peter was going to be Spider-Man no matter what, and he had a feeling that Harley might go down that same road. The two of them couldn't be the only ones, so it only made sense to get a workable program in place.
"I don't know why we gotta be here."
"He doesn't mean it," she reported after one scathing round of noises with a quivering lower lip. "He's just worried about me. And Mr. Doctor Strange was being awful rude about him earlier." Stephen's mouth pursed at the form of address while Tony and Shellhead smothered a laugh. "But honest, he's usually not so yell-y." Tony could handle the adults in the room, he decided as he squatted down in front of the girl. He had a sneaking suspicion of why they'd brought her to them, after all, so he figured he'd better start getting to know her.
That thought was acknowledged for the warmth it gave him, then firmly set aside before it could bring him lower than the basement. It was more important to stay in the moment with Tony, Clint and Nat. Especially since now he could see they'd been playing one of the Call of Duty games. It was hard to keep an innocent look on his face but he did his damnedest. Everyone always forgot how good his spatial memory was, and Clint wouldn't know how well Steve knew all the maps until it was too late.
all fired up and ready to go kick ass. Maybe part of him would enjoy that - enjoy it a whole fucking lot, actually - but more than that... he just wanted Steve to
"Yeah?"
"Winter? Oh, right. Ya said he don't like bein' called 'Bucky'."
"As fun as this is I would like you all to leave my tower pretty much now, so. To what do I owe the dubious honor of this visit?"
"I wouldn't bet on that,
"Alright Captain Marvel, Fri - we're going for a serious injury here, not death - we want her and glaive guy off the field, not for the taller half to get a vengeance hard-on."
Because he was amazing and perfect, Steve didn't even hesitate to scoot away when Rhodey arrived on the scene. His platypus had a face like a thundercloud, tension coiling every muscle he had tight. Steve's concession meant that Tony could drag the man down between them and snuggle up to his side the way they had in college. Rhodey always breathed a little easier when he had Tony's head tucked under his chin, and he could feel that tension slowly start to bleed away. There'd be talking later, maybe even yelling... but for now it was enough that his brother was beginning to calm down.
"Yeah?"
With Clint on one side of the large, heavy drop cloth and U ‘helping’ on his side, they managed to get Tony’s latest project covered in time. Everything on the table was largely still in pieces, so hopefully the spy who’d dropped in wouldn’t be able to get enough information to sing. Or maybe…
care, probably. It meant so, so much to have a new set of people who smiled at him and delivered those little touches that were everything to him. It was amazing to have people who didn't flinch back from his own tactile nature, but allowed him into their space freely instead.
Clint answered after the first ring and seemed thrilled with the latest favor he'd be doing for Steve. He'd be there within half and hour and then they could get the poor girl home to be taken care of. The man also promised to warn Tony and get him to have a vet come to the tower pronto.
Probably he wouldn't get to be Captain America, but lately he hadn't much wanted to be anyway. The shine had dulled since the moment he'd seen a shield just like his slice into the arc reactor.
"Language."
He'd kept from communicating with old team, his old
Though that was what ended up on the screen. Steve had campaigned even harder for that choice than Tony had and seemed smugly pleased with his victory from the love seat they were sharing.
“Steven! In front of the children!”
"Easy, sweetheart," he whispered as he tried not to be furious at the teen who'd caused the bout of coughing. "Just breathe... there we go." When he dared look over at Harley the anger in him softened again at the lost, helpless look in his eyes. He'd never stopped crying, Steve realized, and there were bruises under his eyes that were almost a match for Tony's. The kid looked pale and was trembling to boot, lower lip caught between his teeth like maybe he was trying to hold in a sob. "Come here son-- Harley. C'mon over so Tony can apologize proper ta ya without shoutin'."
happened."
would live a lot longer than he would. This just drove that home in 4k crystal clear HD. His borrowed time had started a decade ago, and he wasn't going to get another extension like that. Steve said he wasn't going to leave again, but soon he was probably going to be living in this world without Tony beside him.
The barrier had fallen while he wasn't looking, Vision and Loki supporting Strange while the Sorcerer Supreme's cloak fluttered anxiously behind him. Hulk had already shrunken down to Bruce, the scientist looking a little dazed as he climbed out of the crater; Harley was right there a second later, helmet retracting as he coaxed Bruce towards medical instead of letting him wander the battlefield looking for downed teammates to help. Peter had ripped his hood off as well and was sitting on the ground, panting as he looked up at the Benatar with a huge smile on his face. Pepper had Jess in a bridal carry, the crusty detective clearly attempting to escape a trip to medical and Pep just as relentless in the quest to get her there. T'Challa and his Dora Milaje were searching the sea of dead monsters, finding those that had a little life left after all and handling them with the help of Thor and Drax.
STAR took the chance to go into battle, though she surprised him by not going right for Rogers' throat. She had always been meant for strategy though, so maybe it made perfect sense for her to go after Natasha first instead. His heart was almost ready to burst with pride as he watched the way his baby girl maneuvered through the air. And maybe Natasha used her heavy bracelets to block the first volley from STAR's arc reactors, but the way she held them up only allowed his girl a clean shot at the most vulnerable spot in the design.
"Not my territory, especially since Thor says that he's, you know. Dead."
"Oh yeah?"
Exactly. New Asgard is here on Earth, and many of the resources formerly at their disposal are completely outside of their reach. Asgardians may be different than humans, stronger and more resilient, but those who remain are largely civilians and refugees at that. We cannot ask them to fight all of our battles. Unless the Committee is suggesting conscription?
Harley thought about uncle Rhodey and the way he had to do deep breathing exercises before he stepped into the War Machine armor. He knew that somewhere in the compound aunt Pep was pacing in her highest-heeled shoes and her sharpest business suit, so afraid of losing herself to her superhero identity the way so many of the ones she'd known had. In the gym Rogers would be decimating punching bag after punching bag, with Bucky sitting off to the side without his metal arm, watching on in thin-lipped silence. Aunt Carol was probably still awake and up in space, circling the earth and waiting for any sign that their intel was wrong and Thanos arrived sooner than expected. Harley knew that every Avenger had their hangups, that every single damn one of them struggled at least sometime with the things they did and the things they saw.
And again - a dead ringer for Captain America.
At the very least, they would make Thanos pay for his victory in blood.
"Sap."
"I almost peed myself when you said you wanted to name our girl that. I thought... I thought maybe you'd found me out."
"Yeah?"
"Never had any complaints." That got a laugh, and then a comfortable silence fell between them. He threw the ball for Dum-E a few more times in between doodling - Tony had given him an idea. Nat's birthday was coming up, and she'd probably love a picture of her and Clint as the 'Murder Twins' with the rest of the Avengers as their 'Murder Squad'. It would tickle that dark sense of humor she had, especially if he could get his pencils and paper to behave enough to turn his ideas into some sort of comic.
He didn't know what he looked like as he floated toward Thanos, only knew that his armor was buckling under the power it was trying to contain, pieces of it falling as he... as Soul drew closer and closer. There was fear in the Titan's eyes and arrogance in the tilt of his chin; Tony felt Soul's searing contempt for the being more than he felt anything else. Thanos dared to lift his gauntlet, the toy meant to harness all the power in the universe, and Soul snarled with his mouth. A laugh that felt icy as an arctic wind left Steve's lips, because Space had always had a wicked sense of humor and was almost as childlike as the mortals who sought to steal its power. Time was silent, a sage who was done with jabs and jokes, ready to punish the wayward student who had stepped too far over the line.
"Right as rain. Be even better if you'd stop messing around and take your guy out."
Well, not really. His stomach and internal senses insisted that he was, but he knew his feet were as good as glued down. The sensation was as unsettling as everyone had always described. The feeling intensified, and for a few moments he felt
"A good fight, friend Steven!" Thor boomed, hefting his hammer over one shoulder. His eyes twinkled like they always did when he played the loud, obnoxiously cheerful tourist. "There were several times I almost feared I would break a sweat! You fight well, and you are truly deserving of the title of Shield-brother. Most mortals are so breakable, but not you Rogers-son--"
"STAR might be harder ta convince though. I'm thinkin'
Their girl hadn't wanted to go with her metal brothers to the other world. She'd gone only after a lot of pleading and guilt-tripping; Steve thought fuzzily that it would probably take a while for her to really forgive them for it.
That wasn't to say he hadn't grown to love the life he had built in the future. The Avengers had become family to him once he allowed himself to let them in. He worried about losing them as much as he'd worried about losing Bucky and with the lives they led he knew that was dangerous. Any mission could go wrong, any strangely costumed super villain with an ax to grind and a whole lot of crazy on top of that could be the thing that stole one of them away.
were you in my vents? JARVIS--”
what he needed. Not when Wanda could sense it, sniff it out like a bloodhound; as she stepped off the aircraft she looked unerringly his way and gave a sharp, vicious smile.
"Hourly? Ya think I got nothin' better ta do than sit around'n write ta ya all the time? I'll run outta things ta say before a day's gone by!"
“We never finished that last season of Doctor Who,” Tony ventured, pretty sure he’d get shot down.
Not all of it, of course. The blatant rudeness and the catcalling he witnessed were two things he could do without for sure. He tried to step in where he could to change things when warranted. Sometimes it backfired, sometimes he could help out, and sometimes he very much wanted to get his shield and bash at some hard heads to try and get through to people. It was all too loud for his ears sometimes, and he didn't know why everyone had to be on their cell phones every minute of the damn day, but there were good things too.
"Don't worry. I'll thank her and Tony will too once we get this sorted. Now get home and get your schoolwork done, ya hear?"
Tony hadn't talked to him for three days after he brought the dog home. He might have been more worried about that if JARVIS hadn't constantly been relaying information from him that was all about how to best take care of dogs. There'd even been a few care packages delivered, all of them with Tony's unique gift-giving flair. Steve suspected that he was worried about getting too attached only to have someone snatch the dog away. That was something he could understand, so he figured it was best to let the genius come around in his own time. JARVIS and Rhodey both agreed with him and he could afford to be patient. Especially since he had a little princess to dote on and introduce to the other Avengers.
"Uh-huh. Whatever you say. Hey, you ever hear about the time Tony tried to keep twenty rats as pets in our dorm?"
"It's... it's not
"No, no. It's true. I can't science or math if I'm too mellow. I require a hint of jittery anxiety in order to reach peak performance."
All in all, it reeked of a move made out of terror and despair, not one that had been fully thought out. The two of them really ought to be reunited so they could work it out in person. Beyond that, Peter could probably use some support and guidance from people who knew who he was. Harley was about that same age and looking for a new school to boot - maybe they could be friends without that kind of heavy secret between them.
Talking between kisses was officially his favorite thing to do now, and as much as he loved to hear Tony ramble he'd be pretty damned okay if they just kept doing this forever. "It's in my bedroom," came out in a rumble he almost didn't recognize as his own voice. When he felt the way it made Tony shudder against him he vowed to learn how to use it on purpose.
But Thor is here--
After the past few weeks he didn't think he'd ever doubt Tiny Adorable Steve's feelings again.
"Stop reading my mind and stealing my mystery Pep!" She laughed and then left, fingers swiping carefully under her eyes to save her makeup.
"I cannot
We are aware of those claims and I'm sure Thor will be called in--
before the 'trash' thing and didn't seem like it would go away any time soon. He still wasn't sure if he found Winter's crush adorable or disturbing; Pegs hadn't figured it out yet either. Personally he thought it was the whole 'Agent Carter' part of it that was throwing her. If the guy would just call her Peggy it'd probably clear up a lot of the confusion.
"Tony... it's..."
"This," he started, relishing in the long pause afterward. "Is Rescue. You can change the name later if you really want, but I think it fits. You, Ms. Pepper Potts, have this annoying habit of saving me even when I don't want you to. You've been running my life for years, and you've always been good at swooping in and saving the day when I need it most. I know why you're doing this, and it isn't because you want to finally let everyone know how much of a badass you are under that sensible, non-nonsense attitude of yours." She laughed again with tears in her eyes, and when she put one hand to her mouth, he took hold of the other. "Rescue is sleeker and a lot more agile than Iron Man ever was. She's made for speed, not strength. I knew you wouldn't want to be a tank. A lot of what you've got access to are weapons to stun and distract... but you've also got what you need to take people out if you need to. You're gonna have to work with me a little though. I want you to be able to use your own personal fire power while you're in her, but it's gonna require some tweaking."
Thanks so much for reading! Comments are greatly appreciated and I do try to respond. <3
Tony had been all set to disappear into the workshop once everyone broke up for the night. Thankfully he'd managed to catch his lover in the elevator. Once he'd tangled their fingers together and squeezed gently, the other man had given an exaggerated sigh and asked Fri to take them to their floor instead. The silence between them was more tense than it ever had been before. He worried that maybe even if he didn't go visit Bucky right away that they had been hurt by this.
Which was
He should tell Winter that the Defenders could go home, that they were fine. But he kind of liked the thought of it, being able to see his fella and his friends when he got up in the morning. And that tiny part of him that wanted to be hyper-alert, that was warning that Thanos could be so much closer than Gamora thought, that battle could find them again at any moment... that part of him was able to stand down. The Defenders were there, so he and Tony were safe.
you still--"
Maybe Thanos only had two Stones to their three, but his gauntlet gave him a level of control and finesse that only Strange could match. Thanos could wield them at the same time, while they had split their forces to try and divide the Titan's attention and keep him from being able to get all three Stones in one fell swoop. Maybe their strategy had worked in the beginning, but they also only had a handful of fighter compared to Thanos' seeming thousands. Thanos could afford to use his forces as canon fodder; losing even one Avenger or Defender brought them closer to defeat.
ta think? Far as he's concerned, Rhodey's legs got hurt 'cause-a him bein' down for the count and it's his fault Rogers and Bucky got away" he ignored the fissure of pain that shot through him at the name, knowing he needed to press this point home more than he needed to mourn his lost friend. More even than he needed to respect the hurt that flashed in Tony's own eyes. "Followin' that logic it's his fault ya got hurt so damn bad too. Why wouldn't ya hate him for all that? Not like ya been in a hurry ta prove him wrong."
"It's everything. That earns ya a hug, mister. No wrigglin' outta it either."
"I am. I swear on ma and da's graves, sweetheart. So please open your eyes'n let me kiss ya good morning. Haven't done that in way too long."
Fuck was it nice to have a real team.
"That long, really? Do you think I'm a moron or something?"
"Hey da? Me'n Peter are gonna stay here after all."
"I had
Steve had been losing things since before he was born. His ma had never talked much about the four small wooden rosaries she kept on her bedside, but he knew it was a match for the one he'd kept tucked in his pocket until he'd gone marching off to war. Each was for a little brother or sister lost before they could be born. A more elaborately carved rosary  had gone into a grave with his father and he'd put a matching one into his ma's coffin himself the day she was buried. Two more losses to be marked, one cutting a little deeper but both changing his life for the worse.
Your questions. You just said this interview was to learn about what we at SI are doing to help the New Avengers and their other allies protect our planet from extraterrestrial threats. So. I would like to hear your questions.
"Civics. I need a good civics lesson Fri, and not just focused on the good ol' USA. Gotta know 'bout the world stage too, 'cause otherwise I'm never gonna understand the big picture the Avengers were operating in. My friend Pegs used ta tell me all the time - ‘context is everything, Stevie’," he said, doing his best to speak with Peggy's posh accent. "’Without it you never know if you're stabbing the right person’."
It was a little sad the way some of Tony's life was mirrored in his most 'human' creation.
Affection hadn't exactly been common in the Stark household when Tony was growing up. Most of it had happened in front of cameras or other people. He could count on one hand the number of times Howard had so much as touched his shoulder when there wasn't an audience to play to. Maria had been a little better when her peach schnapps consumption wasn't too high. If she was sober enough to talk without slurring, she usually remembered to give him hugs and speak a few fond words in Italian so Howard wouldn't scold her for being a soft touch. The weeks when Howard was off traveling were always the best - Maria would retreat and become just mom. They would spend time together, laughing and singing and cuddling. She would teach him a little about playing piano and praise him over the smallest things.
He still took the pills, stretched as best he could and gently worked his left arm a little. It was fucked, had been since Leipzig, and no amount of tinkering by Doctor Cho had taken the intermittent ache away. She just kept telling him he was lucky the fingers on that hand were still so dexterous.
"Please. Dum would steal it back before I even sat down." That was annoyingly true. He had to come up with a better punishment. "And what the hell are ya talkin' about?"
The mere thought of that was almost intoxicating. He immediately abandoned Nat's comic and got out a fresh sheet of paper, one he fully intended to keep to himself. Tony had already gone back to his own work, so there was little chance of him snooping. JARVIS would be able to read it, but Steve was pretty sure the AI would keep it to himself. The next time Dum-E wheeled over, he didn't take the ball to throw again, but patted the 'bot on the claw instead.
everyone and everything had initially gotten his back up. And sure, they'd both been in their superhero get-ups, but having yet another person call him 'Cap' when they touched him just... it just dredged up everything he'd been trying so hard not to think about. Howard's son was attractive, brilliant, and an amazing fighter; he was everything Steve used to let himself dream about in the dark of the night. He was also crass, took arrogance to breathtaking new levels, and he touched people like it meant nothing.
"Bullshit."
Rogers and his team were no longer
Back when he'd been a skinny bit of nothing, Steve had known that he was going to die alone.
"The two-a ya need ta talk, that's what. It's gettin' ridiculous. Tony, I love ya and someday I'm gonna put a ring on your finger. Shellhead, you're my best friend'n I love ya like a brother. So the two-a ya not talkin' breaks my heart a little." He was laying it on thick, but it was for a good cause. Especially since the two men were now eyeing each other curiously instead of thinly veiled anxiety. "So me'n Fri here decided ta facilitate the conversation."
taking chunks out of the teams defending them. Well, except for the team taking on the guy who could move shit with his mind, the one who'd tried to tell them to 'rejoice' or whatever the fuck. Strange and Loki had enclosed themselves, Thor and the Hulk in a force field with what seemed like the strongest threat. It looked like a spectacular fight, one half-hidden in glowing gold and green, and it was the only space free of demon-dogs. Everywhere else? Close to a bloodbath.
"The kids would love to have you there, Cap. You could put on the spangles and teach them life lessons," he would say while grinning. Steve strongly suspected Tony had found out about the PSA's Fury had forced him to record.
"You didn't kno--"
"Iron Man."
The ‘bot gave a single beep before heading off to do just that. Tony didn’t watch him though - his eyes were caught on Steve, who was in the process of pulling off his shirt. The sight should be illegal with all those rippling muscles and the almost invisible dusting of freckles Tony probably shouldn’t know covered his shoulders. Just before he vanished into the tiny room where he’d be able to get clean Steve reached for the waistband of his basketball shorts. Quickly he turned back to his work and tried to ignore the way his cheeks were feeling a little bit warmer.
"What did you do with the pens
"Do you wish to go elsewhere?" Thor's whisper was pitched so only he would hear it; the way the god let his voice boom and carry really was an act. "We could go to your quarters so I can marvel over your artistry, perhaps."
"Steve thinks the two-a ya have a lot of history and that ya love each other," his
"Bullshit."
of their time. They made periodic visits home, and... and... "Fuck."
He reached out for Steve who sounded furious and lost, voice shaking with emotion. Just before their hands touched he hesitated. He didn't know if the gesture would be welcome or if he would be shoved away. Hell, he didn't even know if Steve was still with him - he was staring straight ahead, something haunted in the lines around his eyes.
you."
At least Cap wasn't watching him with a dropped jaw and flushed cheeks anymore. Fuck, he had managed to embarrass Captain America. The Man With a Plan had just been forced to watch him shake his ass and whip hair that he didn't even have, and Howard's fucking ghost was going to break through the door at any second to murder him.
. I don't blame you for wanting to go back. I get it, okay? You can
"Hey," Steve murmured, stepping into his space until they were chest-to-chest. "You did good."
"I cannot
His girl made her way to the genius and stopped just a few inches away, tail wagging politely and her gaze fixed on him. Steve knew that he was a sucker for those pretty eyes and he was pretty sure that Tony would be too. Sure enough he reached out after only a moment, fingers trembling a little. When he couldn't quite bring himself to touch her, she gently pushed against his hand and let out one of her happy little sighs before sitting prettily.
"...thanks?"
He wanted to explain that they wouldn't do that - Loki wouldn't just snatch him away again like that, not after everything - but he wasn't sure it would work. Not when Tony was ready to fight them, not when Peter and Harley were on either side of them prepared to do the same, taking their cue from their more dramatic father figure. Dum-E and U were crowding against his back while STAR was on his shoulder - she at least seemed amused by the whole thing.
"Up to a point," both he and his mop-headed kid said in unison. Harley grinned before continuing. "Our GPS is anchored to da, which means we're following his timeline even if he isn't there to live it. We couldn't go there and end up in the 50's, 'cause he's already lived past that. We're working forward from the time Lokes, Shellhead and Stranger Danger sent him back here. So--"
allowed to tuck that tousled head of hair under his chin. It was probably the most perfect hug that had ever happened to anyone, and he'd fight anyone who said otherwise. "So why don't we hug, exactly?" he dared to murmur while his eyes drifted shut so he could really savor the moment. Christ, it was amazing to finally have Tony be so close, and he couldn't help but tighten his arms just a little when it felt like the other man might be letting go.
like he's supposed to. We'll come home tomorrow and it'll be a family day. For now? Stop fussin' over us and get him back to the tower."
"Which is why I won't be. You really should experience 'workshop sex' at least once."
So yeah, he mostly liked Rhodes just fine. It was just...
"I don't know his
"I didn't... from what Howard said I didn't think you hugged," Tony said quietly, sullenly, fingers closing into fists in the back of Steve's shirt. The gesture brought every protective instinct he possessed to the forefront. His arms went tighter as he fought the urge to growl - Howard wasn't around to intimidate, and there wasn't any reason to make Tony uncomfortable. The guy who was Iron Man probably wouldn't want to be treated like he needed protecting anyway.
"You don't have to!" Ca... Steve hurried to say, cheeks flushing darker as both his hands lifted into the air. "It's just... I know we got off on the wrong foot Tony, and I'm real sorry about that even if you usually won't let me say it. Things being sideways in my head was no excuse for the way I acted back then, and I hope you--"
fault, not yours. All ya did was what was asked of ya. I'm the one who went behind Tony's back, I'm the one who didn't tell ya what I was gonna do with the info, and I'm the one who... who made the choice ta leave. Ya didn't do anything wrong, doll. I hope ya know that." Her silence was louder than anything she could have said, and he was such a stupid jerk for not addressing this sooner, for thinking she'd just
"I think I fell asleep on the Quinjet. This isn't the weirdest dream I've had after a fight. I hope you took over flying before I conked out completely. And that you aren't asleep too. Fri could probably land the Quinjet alright, but I'd rather one of us was conscious for it."
When Dum-E went after it with a shrill whistle of pure joy, Captain America tucked his hands into the front pockets of his jeans. Jeans that were a vast improvement over the khakis but could also be classified as cruel and unusual punishment. Maybe even torture. It was hard to remember that Captain America wouldn't like him ogling when the guy just looked so damned good. How was he supposed to not stare at that?
"Liar. Peter checked in while you two were out. He and Harley should be home around dinner time. Rhodey's been showing them after battle protocol or something? Since they're big boys now."
"Tell him to stop rehearsing what he's going to say and get his android ass in here, Fri. He'll only work himself into a dither if he doesn't."
"Yeah, well. ... tell them thanks, I guess."
It had led to him leaving the tower to jog a lot more. He liked the space it gave him, and he knew he needed to start integrating or whatever the way Dr. Greene was always telling him to. Getting a feel for the city the way it was now was something he needed to do... and it was something he could put off when he was completely comfortable staying in the tower all the time. Now that the air there felt charged and uneasy he found himself needing to get out. In the process he was learning that he sort of liked modern day New York City.
though. Steve rolled his eyes every time and some of the Defenders had absolutely no patience for it... but even Loki and Lokes gave quiet little smiles whenever they got to program the gate. Peter was giddy to finally be the one to pick out the symbols - he'd never been fast or forward enough to secure the right. Harley was a good brother for noticing and then correcting that oversight.
"What the--"
"You have seen something that cannot be unseen," Tony intoned, going for drama and playfulness. Cap seemed in the mood to indulge both him and his silly 'bot. He wasn't above capitalizing on that. The fading pink on Cap's cheeks came back full force - he guessed nobody had danced like that back in the 40s. "So I'm afraid I can't let you go, Captain."
“No. I can… Shellhead – my world’s Tony Stark – worked with that Loki ta find a way I could go back and visit.” Panic, dark and shameful and so heavy it could crush him with ease briefly choked him. His
"That's... that's really good. So."
"Aw, no fair," Clint complained when Tony immediately handed the controller over. "No passing off turns mid-tournament. It's rude, is what it is. You're only doing it because you're losing."
That was pretty much the definition of a good day. He was more than happy to take it.
"Wait wait wait. You said ten years."
. He was almost giddy with the success of it, which was ridiculous of him. Maybe he would have felt worse about that if it wasn't the first time he had actually managed to make Cap laugh. Hell, he could count on his fingers the number of times he had even heard the sound before. It was a really, really big development... and he was terrified that if he stuck around he was going to find a way to ruin it. "You both make it so hard to leave--"
"Tony!"
Winter was already striding for the door in a rolling gait Steve had to admit was definitely a murder strut. STAR was enthusing about the 'toys' Tony had made with him in mind. It was nice to see the guy so eager. If he were being honest, he'd sort of expected a blank-faced man with zero personality. That had been wrong of him, and he was glad for the chance to get to know this new version of his friend and brother.
"Even better! I'm all yours kid. Now put that away and let's talk about what we're working on. We can absolutely focus on your stuff, we can play with some of the things I'd been working on before I was forbidden from coming down here, or we can do something new? Or we could each work on our own stuff too. My 'shop is yours, at least until we build you your own."
"Yes Ms. Potts?"
"I will
of all people, he'd been worried. He had been so fucking afraid that he would be found lacking and that Steve would turn him away in favor of a different Tony Stark.
"Ya don't gotta... I wouldn't if ya were
"So fucking gone on you that Nat makes me sympathy cakes whenever I gush about you for too long."
"You beat Rogers up for me."
"Bullshit."
He leaned up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek, hating and loving that he had to lift up a little on his toes to do it. Anyone who saw the gesture was going to have a field day; it was worth it to see the brilliant smile that broke out on the blond’s face.
“That’s enough,” Steve finally interrupted, voice firm. “JARVIS, could you bring up the menu for the diner? I think that’s the way most of us are leaning.”
"You all need to come visit soon. Very soon. Like maybe in a couple weeks?"
The future wasn't what he had wanted, but it wasn't as bad as he had thought when he first woke up in it.
, and we thought--"
~.~.~
He blinked and found himself in the most obnoxiously tacky room he'd ever seen in his life. It was all ridiculously ostentatious to the point of being absurd, and he immediately felt at home. The life-sized golden statue of Iron Man with a tiny Captain America done in bronze perched on shoulder - coincidentally the same shoulder Twinkles had landed on before they left - was probably what really sealed the deal. Before he could laugh as much as that touch deserved and well before he could start exploring the room, Steve and the boys grabbed his arms and dragged him away.
His AI's silence took on a pissy note that Tony knew was probably Not Good, but the circuitry he was working on was way more important than placating JARVIS. His music was still going strong after all, so it couldn't be that bad. If his Black Sabbath cut out then he knew there was real trouble. Until that happened he planned to keep putting the design from R&D through its paces. If it worked, if it could really prolong the life of Lithium-air batteries reliably... well. He would turn his own genius toward solving the short-circuiting problem and bam! The world would be one step closer to clean energy for all.
This was late!! Of course it was, I always am. ;.; This time I have a decent excuse at least. I was in one of the sub-committees that was working on plans to re-open the school I work at which has been a very special brand of hell. There is a 65 living document now, and guidance from the governor, health department and CDC seem to change daily and often conflict, because of course they do.
He had been hearing stories about Captain America even longer - hell, to hear everyone tell it, his very first word had been 'Captain'. A garbled infant's version of it anyway. Tony had no doubt believing that it was the closest Howard had ever come to approving of him. The missing soldier - not dead,
Carol was the first to lower her arms, shoulders rolling back as she prepared herself for the meeting. Not that it was their first - she'd been the point of contact for all the meetings involving the Rogue's and the possibility of them coming back to the Avengers. There was still tension in her frame, and Rhodey was going to break his back again if he didn't loosen up and stand down at least a little.
"Stop laughing or I'll have to spank you. Look." The playful tease gave way to a far more serious tone of voice, one that made Steve stand a little taller and listen close. "I want forever with you and for some crazy reason you want the same with me. Maybe we can't get apples right away and maybe everyone else will think we're jumping the gun, but... Steve. Cookie crumble. Babe. I... I love you, okay? I can't imagine ever not loving you. We've known each other for years, been friends almost as long and now... it doesn't feel too soon to me."
“‘Maybe wanna’ what?”
“When I allowed you entry--”
"I'm sure they'll be happy to be able to train and hang out somewhere other than SHIELD." Her nose wrinkled and her lips pursed - Pepper had
"Because I'm going to kick Roger's a--"
“Butterfingers! Watch your mouth! You see? That’s your influence, Steven. He learned all his bad habits from you.” Clint, practically howling with laughter now, just held on to Butterfingers’ struts as the ‘bot hauled him across the room to the couch. “Any other choice phrases you’d like to teach the boys?”
Then again Tony cuddled with Clint sometimes too, and he was always all over Rhodey. Bruce got just as much enthusiastic touching and so it wasn't anything special. Probably. Tony avoiding him so much lately definitely meant that it was just his tactile nature. Maybe.
Lokes officiated, and nobody dared mention how emotional he got when asked.
worlds. It made him uncomfortable in the extreme, but he was starting to get used to it. Kind of.
"Tony I ain't... I told ya, didn't I? I'm not goin' back without ya, and not without our kids neither."
“I’m not hurting his anything. He and Clint just haven’t made up yet. Now get away from Steve before I have to hose you down, Dum-E. That stuff is… violently purple and I find it offensive.”
"Please be here."
?" Harley demanded, practically bristling with rage. After
"Low blow and also ridiculous. I don't... he really thinks that?"
So this one takes us through about a year and a half with a few scenes. There'll be another chapter to get through the next year and a half to when Thanos will be showing up in my timeline.
"They aren't worth it," he told Steve honestly, even if the realization was only just settling into his bones as truth. "I have more important things to worry about."
"I might agree if you hadn't let me walk into the sofa." Pep sounded more annoyed than amused, but there was a smile tugging at her lips. Hopefully she'd stay in a good mood even after she saw her suit. "Now I'm afraid we're at war. All bets are off."
"Yeah sure. If ya say so. Now. How 'bout that hug I owe ya?"

Hope already had Scott by the ear and was dragging him off. She was scolding him, voice a hissing whisper. He looked terrified and wasn't even trying to fight her, which was a very small point in his favor. He'd earned a lot more when he'd sent the Ant Man suit to the Avengers Compound almost immediately after taking shelter in Wakanda. Scott had been the only Rogue not to keep on with the whole vigilante justice thing. Tony kind of hoped he turned out not to be a shitty person after all.
Wanda was less than happy when Strange got her attention and beckoned to the building. "Why should I?" she demanded while taking a step back. "Is this one of Stark's ideas? We were promised he was no longer in charge--" Tony couldn't help but let out a bark of laughter at the idea that he had
"With a bonus helping of sass, yeah. I know." Harley glared at him, but he also came to a stop. Progress. "What's going on here bud?"
"Give it a rest, ya lug," Steve said, lips twitching form the effort it took not to smile. He
"Corvus Glaive is down, where do you want us Captain?" Peggy's cool report was being delivered to Captain
This interview ended with a hug from Steve and a handshake from Tony. They both said they would try to schedule another sit-down soon, one where we wouldn't have to spend the first half an hour getting to know each other. Look forward to that, and don't forget to check out our website! There will be an extended list of some of Maverick's likes and dislikes - from this world and his own! - along with quite a few photos that didn't make it into this spread.
"Good call Shellhead. Just... keep shooting it to keep it distracted and stay out of its reach." STAR was still in there, still moving and talking and she didn't sound alarmed. Hopefully he hadn't sent her into a pit of acid, because he'd never forgive himself if he had. "We've got to give her some time to work."
Peter only hesitated for a few seconds before taking the offered money and heading back to the counter. There was a skip in his step that hadn't been there before. When he ordered his hands were all over the place in his excitement, the happy tone of his voice reaching Steve's ears even if he didn't strain to hear the details of the order. Smiling, he pulled Peter's abandoned strawberry to him - wasting food was still near a sin in his book, after all - and dumped it in with his vanilla. That was fancy enough for him - he didn't need chocolate chips or gummy worms or whatever the hell else was on offer.
"Whatever. Let's get out of here."
Steve choked on his own tongue at
To be as involved as he wanted to be, he needed information. If he was going to be a useful support to Tony then he needed to understand the context of it all. He'd already done it once in his lifetime - he was eager to do another deep dive into the history of the future. For all of that... he needed FRIDAY.
"How many do you want on timers, Katniss?"
"And Mr. Stark?"
The Stark-Rogers household
"Well, after you told me what they meant anyway."
Next two chapters might go up Tuesday morning instead of Monday night, depending on my internet situation! They's written, just not edited or coded.
"I am," Tony said slowly. "Really close. If I put my nose to the grindstone I could have it done in a few days. The notes Shellhead gave me during his last visit were a great jumping off point. But where would we stay where nobody would get huffy about their place being invaded by AIs?"
"... I'm just so tired,
Before the Avengers, dinner had always been pretty damn predictable. Fancy restaurants when he needed to dazzle, cold leftovers when he didn’t, shakes and protein bars in the workshop, takeout whenever Rhodey or Pep were there to eat with him. There was never any big debate - Pep and Rhodey had established their favorites long ago, and there was only half-hearted banter between them before they settled on something if they were both there the same night. J had long since memorized orders and phone numbers, and if he were being honest with himself Tony could admit that those lists hadn’t changed much since he turned thirty.
Sometimes he wondered what the hell had made Tony so gun-shy about showing real emotions about the things that mattered.
with the pop culture references."
cared about all his kids, not just the ones that had bodies. "But would your friends really want to meet them?" Meet
"So rude."
Maybe it wasn't really that funny - maybe both Tony and Harley were right to be looking at him with the same expression of mild annoyance. But Christ did it feel good to laugh again. This was a release of tension, and for the first time in a long time it didn't feel like something was missing. His fella was right there, judging him, and he could actually enjoy the ridiculous moment he'd found himself in completely.
"I don't need your kind of help. Not anymore. So just... stop. Stop helping me, alright? All I want from you, from
"Probably not, no," she said dryly.
"Of course, Boss. I did suggest--"
"Hey mister. Got the stuff you wanted." Steve looked up to find the boy he'd given a fifty to standing a few feet away, two blue plastic bags swinging from one wrist. "That thing gonna bite if I get close? Rabies isn't how I wanna die."
It almost felt so... so normal as they exchanged a kiss in the soft light streaming through the windows. For just a second he could block out the beeping machines, the way Tony still looked so tired and hurt. He could forget that they'd been apart for actual fucking decades of his time, and the drama of that separation and their reunion fell away. Steve was just a guy with a sweetheart he adored, sharing in a moment that felt so blissfully goddamn
Harley's arms adjusted around him in a tight but comforting hold. They'd flown together like this only once before, but he knew the kid had him. If all else failed, his girl FRIDAY would take care of them both. Just before Harley took off, Rogers finally seemed to notice them.
Coping with small-time crooks was way different than dealing with the aftermath of a battle, he figured. So a more serious, in-depth discussion was probably warranted.
Matt thought the whole thing was hilarious but still wouldn't let the Avengers set foot in Hell's Kitchen.
"Colonel Rhodes will be arriving in less than five minutes," Pep suddenly cut in, voice hard and uncompromising. Maybe Stark men were made of iron, but Pepper Potts was made of pure fucking tungsten. "If you wish to avoid any other unpleasantness, I suggest you be well on your way before then." Her smile was anything but nice, and he was pleased to see that even Natasha was eyeing her warily. "He doesn't quite have my control, you see, and unlike Steve here... well. Where you and the other rogue Avengers are concerned he would rather ask for Tony's forgiveness rather than his permission. If he finds you here I'm certain you'll need to see someone in medical, and I doubt your little stunt will remain off the UN's radar if that happens."
“Why were you in my vents?
“It was nice to meet both of you, but we need to be going. Away.” Tony had to turn his head to hide a laugh in Steve’s shoulder. The soldier was awful at this being tactful socially shit - he wasn’t even trying to be subtle or offer a good excuse. “Have a lovely rest of the evening.”
"See you for dinner? I'll cook." After a sound of agreement and a brief kiss, Steve left the room as well. Tony found himself staring at the spot where the Defenders had disappeared. He didn't like the way it had felt, saying goodbye like that. Thinking of all the times that Tiny Adorable Steve had done it was beyond unacceptable... and he needed to find a way to fix it. So as soon as he finished Pep and Steve's new super-selves, he was going to figure out the problem of his
"But if... look. If Thanos gets all-a them Stones... we still don't know nothin' about the Soul Stone. If he's got that one too then he's gonna be a tough sonuvabitch ta beat. We might lose. If he gets them, if that plan-a his goes right... Winter, he wants ta get rid of half of all life. That's crazy and I hope we can stop it, but if'n we can't... if I'm part of that half I need ya ta do somethin' for me.."
Tony had thought he was done being brave. He hadn't thought he had it in him to make any more leaps of faith, would have sworn he would never put his heart in anyone else's hands for the rest of his life. He'd been ready to commit to the life of a hermit, with only infrequent visits with Rhodey, Pep and Vision. The message the universe was clearly trying to send had finally been received loud and clear - he was supposed to be alone.
It would not be wise, and while we have as long as we need we do not have forever. Space and Time are near. No, they are--
Comments would be loved and appreciated. <3
"Um, Boss? Steve? I hate to interrupt--"
"Yes you are, young man. March."
(See the end of the chapter for
"She?" The little differences were fucking fascinating. He kind of wanted to sit down with Shellhead and make some kind of sprawling comparison chart to have around for giggles and reference.
Thankfully he was used to being torn and juggling those separate parts of himself.
did it feel nice to have backup he could count on.
later.
Well, props and the way Steve was gently gripping his elbow in a silent show of support.
Soooooo... I like the idea of Pep keeping her powers regardless of what happened in Iron Man 3. I like to think that Tony made her version of Extremis a lot less volatile and easier to control rather than stripping it away entirely.
"You'll buy a place?"
He was jolted out of his thoughts when the aircraft finally touched down. A growing unease began to overtake him as he watched the Rogues get closer and closer to invading his life all over again. It was easy to know that Rogers and his team wouldn't be allowed anywhere near him, but harder to feel like it was true in his heart and his gut. Harley moved to stand even closer so their sides were pressed together, and Kamala's arms were suddenly long enough to wrap around the both of them. Steve was still in front of him, and he noticed that several other Avengers had shifted slightly so they were between him and any threat the Rogues may present.
You still feel loyalty to your old boss and I can understand that. We're only trying to get to the truth here, Ms. Potts.
Clint did, and pretty soon after that he was complaining about how unfair it all was. Steve killed him almost a dozen times before Clint finally managed to snipe him. He hadn't stopped grinning the whole time, and Tony was cheering him on all loud and enthusiastic. It was a great way to spend an afternoon, and he had fun even rafter Nat took over for Clint. She was a much harder opponent, and they entered what Tony called 'serious mode' in the span of half a match.
He wasn't sure how much of it he would have if Steve weren't there - maybe it wouldn’t look that much different without the tiny blond - but he did know exactly who he wanted with him at the center of this makeshift family held together by something stronger than blood. So maybe that offer of marriage had come at the worst time, and he probably should wait for a little while longer before he got a ring. Despite that, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he was going to marry Steve Brian Rogers... someday.
"With you there's always a but. What is it this time?"
Stark'? If his lover wasn't so damn good at picking up on his mood and his well...
Maverick
"Uh... what? I don't--"
"Least it means he's stopped tryin' ta impress ya."
“Uh, yes you do. And come on! Vietnamese sounds so good right now. I can’t believe you’re fucking campaigning for pizza - you barely like pizza! You never want it when I want it--”
"I want to help you now. I want... I don't want to have to sit at home and... and wait for news that you’re hurt again. Next time something comes looking for trouble I don't want to sit on the sidelines and hope it all works out. I can't--" Harley's voice broke, and it was hard to know if it was puberty or emotion at work. "I can't sit by and do nothing while you could die. I want to help."
So he missed it when the pair of them moved without waking up, gravitating towards each other until they were in the middle of the bed. Rhodey was afraid to so much as breath, eyes so wide they almost hurt as he put one trembling hand over his mouth. Helen had grabbed him, but this time she was clutching at his arm so hard her nails were digging into his skin just a little. Harley let out something that sounded a hell of a lot like a sob, but Rhodey couldn't take his eyes away, because what if he did and whatever was happening
was feeling and it wouldn't be anything good. He needed to... Tony had to know that this wasn't enough to make him
"This is supposed ta be a good thing."
"... I'm only going to get him hurt again."
in the face, so color him impressed at Shellhead's emotional maturity. He figured it was because Steve had never hidden what Winter had done; Shellhead hadn't lived most of his adulthood believing a
Right. We've received some concerns that Mr. Stark may be attempting to repeat the Ultron Experiment.
"All I have down here for food is coffee and my yummy chlorophyll smoothies. You won’t like any of it and you’re going to get hungry enough to bargain eventually."
Tony guessed he'd never really gotten over the small, fragile hope that Captain America might learn to like him after all.
"Ya sure ya don't want us here?"
He tried to figure out why the fuck at least half of the Defenders core team was loitering in the tower while they ate, but Lokes kept fending them off. Steve didn't seem to notice, probably because he was basking in the glow of having Shellhead and Winter sitting at the same table and breaking bread. It was a pretty new development, and the pair were still stiff and painfully polite to each other.
Finding out that Shellhead was terrified of exactly the same thing had been a revelation. Once they started actually talking to one another they bonded almost instantly. That little twinge of jealously flickered out to nothing, and he was going to miss his other self a hell of a lot. The guy had even built a fist-sized heart out of gears and scrap metal that was stunning; it rested in place of honor on the memorial Steve and the boys had made for JARVIS. Tony might have cried a little when it had been presented.
"Fuck, you're fucking perfect and I don't give a shit what you or anyone else says. Fucking
"Wait, you think... oh my God. Oh my--" Pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, he did his best to breathe evenly. "I have not been
Rhodey and Viz would be moving to the site soon, and they would be the ones to welcome the new members to their new homes. Tony mostly planned for them to commute, though he and Steve knew they would have to stay there for stretches at a time to make sure they integrated well enough to fight. All in all, the New Avengers Initiative was shaping up nicely and should be ready to get off the ground in a month or so.
came along and now Tony won't even look at me. I thought you'd be satisfied with that, but now... now Bucky? You think you can just come in here, dragging some poor imitation of my best friend with you like a dog? I bet you haven't even helped him get rid of the programming, have you?" The pity and bewilderment that had been welling up abruptly turned to anger, but Rogers wasn't done talking. "You're holding his leash and you brought him here to try and steal the last really good thing in my life."
~.~.~
Tony Stark has been known to go to extremes to try and protect people. What's to say this won't go too far? How do we know this isn't something even worse than Ultron?
Thanks go to Arboreal for the idea, and for letting me run with it once it was given. <3 I appreciate the patience and understanding!!
After his quality time with Viz Tony got the same while he got to hang out with one of the kids - sometimes that meant Harley instead of a 'bot. They usually played video games while he and U settled right back into drawing. Dum-E had come up with a new and complex form of fetch that involved keeping score and STAR was pretty much glued to Tony's side. She got to know her nephew during his chats with the genius.
"He should hate me."
The Vision joined them only a few moments later, worry a little alien on his face but there nonetheless. It was quite a nice little family reunion, and Steve only wished his fella wasn't in pain through so much of it. By the time Pepper and Rhodey joined them they had all been in bed all day - even Harley's mother and adorable little sister had come to join the impromptu gathering. There were snacks and everything. Maybe it would have been better if it could have happened on the common floor, but... it was enough.
"If you were anyone else, Steven, I would rip your heart from your chest and present it to him on a platter. I'll give you the chance to
"Ya gotta."
"Oh. My. God. So that isn't just a rumor?" Peter just about knocked his dish over when he leaned forward in excitement, eyes dancing with delight. "It's a real thing? Helen Cho is... oh my God. She's a
And so when the Titan called to Power and Reality, when he tried to turn them against their fellow Stones... they balked. They fought the control he had taken for granted, leaving his attacks weak. Pitiful, really, so insignificant that Soul could bat them aside with one calloused, mortal hand. The skin blistered, but that didn't matter - what mattered was that Thanos was sweating, and that he was staring at the gauntlet as though at a betrayer.
The sex they were having now was
"Ooooh, he's going to kick your butt."
Once Peter Parker and his Aunt May were tucked neatly into their family unit, he had a feeling Tony might even be thankful for it.
to bring them through once it was too late to stop you," Winter commented, voice almost idle. "She told me she had specific instructions not to activate the portal until
"Not qualified and not interested," Steve himself interrupted, looking alarmed as he dropped his arms and backed away from Pepper. "I didn't mind so much helpin' ta lead the Defenders 'cause of circumstances and how well we worked together'n all, but... sorry. Not interested and not just 'cause this ain't my world. Rhodey's a good choice, if ya ask me, and it'd be even better if ya found someone ta co-lead. Me'n Shellhead always worked well together."
Loki's fight with the Hulk had left his living room in less than pristine condition, but his bar had been untouched. Tony had been staring at a glass of whiskey for over an hour, reliving the fight on the Helicarrier over and over. It was supposed to have been caused by Loki's staff, by whatever the hell kind of bullshit magic powered it, but Tony knew better. He remembered the derision in Captain America's eyes and the sneer on his lips. He had countless memories of Howard telling him how little Captain America would think of him, and Howard had been right. Loki's staff had just brought it all to the surface sooner than might have happened otherwise. Captain America was never going to be a fan, and it was probably better this way. At least this way he hadn't had time to
didn't like when people insisted he was the same guy who'd fallen off that train. "He bled out until there was nothing left, and Hydra and the Red Room worked together to shove a monster under his skin instead. I am not," here Winter sneered, finally gracing Rogers with a single look. "
What's this? A chapter you didn't have to wait weeks for???? It's a miracle! :D
Thank Christ he froze instead of jumping, even if he'd done it with the water bottle at his mouth. He probably looked a damn fool but the genius didn't pull away - that was the important part. It was hard to try and keep his eyes from going wide while swallowing enough water to keep from choking
Fingers squeezed his arm a little too tightly at first before easing into something more gentle. "No. Don't suppose it will. How..." Steve swallowed audibly and for the first time since Tony had woken up, the man sounded uncertain. Maybe even a little afraid. "How bad is it? I dreamed... it was bad in my dream, sweetheart. Real bad. How much did he hurt you?"
Tony expected a moment of silence and consideration. Nat and Clint were the Murder Twins; they were a set. They might fight or stab each other with sharp things sometimes, but they were still so intertwined it was hard to know where one ended and the other one started. He knew for a fact that they kept track of each other's heart rates and shit like that. So to ask Clint to keep something from her was... big. The plan that had come together in his mind in a few heartbeats had accounted for that, had contingencies that would carry them right up to Steve's arrival when he would capitulate anyway.
Rhodey pulled away from circling above the Tesseract and joined him on a flight path to the petals of death. One of them seemed to have fully unloaded it's cargo of raging beasts, and two more only had a couple of the monsters trickling out. In unspoken agreement he and Rhodey ignored them and went for the three petals still disgorging small armies onto the battlefield. If they could cut that flow off, the tide of the fight could be turned and maybe they could win even without a last minute arrival from the Benatar. Though he was still kind of hoping that might happen, no matter how annoying Quill was.
Toying with the idea of doing an epilogue/future scene if anyone would be interested?
I'm not sure I like your tone, Ms. Potts. I am here at the behest of--
Also school started back up, which is a yay! But towards the end of October they changed my placement, taking me out of the two classrooms I was working in and moving me to the other classroom in the grade level so I could help out there, which boo. I've been super busy, but finally got up the gumption and energy to finish this.
Maybe she was sure, but he wasn't. He hadn't been face to face with Bucky Barnes in decades, and now the fella wouldn't even use that name. Peggy had told him firmly to use 'Winter' as a term of address because anything else was likely to end with a punch to his face. He hated that name, that identity; he hated what his friend had been twisted into. But if that's what 'Winter' wanted to be called, well.
"Good choice. And pops?"
"Okay. That's... fine. Good. Great. You should learn from the best. Any guff from you and you'll be grounded and your only 'patrol' will be sweeping the 'shop to find and fix the errors of your metal brothers."
"Good work Fri, I want you back on the hellhounds, alright? Kid, you okay?
"Not as big of one as you are."
Rosie's bottom had started to wag along with her tail when she heard Clint's name and by the time JARVIS said 'walk' her whole body was squirming with joy. Steve knew when he was beat - even a trip down to the workshop to see her metal brothers wasn't as fun as taking a walk with Clint. He was her favorite human to traipse around the city with and even her pop and her ma didn't come close to getting that level of excitement out of her.
"I'm not
"It sounds like a challenge, so yeah. I'll work on the project solo, then when we come to visit me and me can get it up and running."
"Hey," he interrupted, stepping back to look Harley in the eye. "It doesn't matter that I didn't think Rogers would hurt him or that I didn't know we were playing for keeps. I put him in the ring with dangerous people, and that's on me. I'm the adult, and I made a bad call. I have to live with that, and I'm going to make damn sure it never happens again."
"Pfft. I can lift anything you can. Might have to put the suit on first, but that's not cheating it's playing smart. And no. Just..."
"Will do Boss. I'll have him bring in some trays too since I anticipate you both eating breakfast in bed."
"But--"
"So. Um. Mister Steve, I asked you here today because--" his voice cracked, a testament to his age, and he began to blush furiously. "I mean." The kid - Peter something - cleared his throat while clearly trying to pull his failing courage around him. "We're here because Mister Stark won't let me... I know I didn't do so good in Berlin and that I got caught under that jetway and all and so it's my fault they - Cap and that guy with the cool metal arm - got away and I didn't listen to orders and I, you know, maybe got really excited about being in my first big fight so it's possible I wasn't taking it as seriously as I should have, but I didn't... I didn't mean to mess it all up and now he won't
"Me and STAR get first crack though. Wait here, 'less ya decide ya wanna get a few hits in. Then they'd be all yours." From the corner of his eye he could see the way the three rogue Avengers were practically squirming with frustration at being ignored. Then Steve leaned up and gave him a sweet, lingering kiss... and half the satisfaction that came from it was seeing Rogers' jaw drop and hearing Sam's whispered 'holy shit'.
So yeah, Nat would have made sense and she would have no problem sending a concerned Clint out to do her dirty work for her. Thor would be the next suspect, but they had parted only a hour before and Steve had told him that he planned on going to bed. Bruce would have been a surprising fourth choice, but even that would have made more sense than who he found once he swung the door open.
, and usually he would turn and offer the man a smile, but he... he just didn't have it in him just then. Staring at the glass as he tried to mentally prepare himself for what was coming was better. Easier.
He didn't try to stop glaive guy from beaming them both up, though he
“You’re all so fucking weird. I don’t know why I let you live here. Brucie-bear, you can stay and I guess Steve can too, but the rest of you are on thin ice.”
He wasn't sure. It was a strange blend of both positive and negative emotions, his thoughts tumbling over themselves as he searched for some kind of equilibrium. On the one hand, having people so firmly on his side was
Mostly he feared that maybe he'd get back to his own world and then not be able to return home. He was also worried that Tony might misunderstand, that he might think Steve wanted to go back for keeps. He was even a little afraid that he might steal Tony and their family and just not let them come back and to hell with what happened to this place…
"I did
~.~.~
They bickered about cleaning supplies while Steve finished cleaning up and I tried to blend in with the sofa I was sitting on. Steve seems to have a particular hatred of Swiffers, so I wisely kept my appreciation of them to myself. I have a feeling I would have been in for quite a lecture if I hadn't, and there were too many questions that needed to be asked first. Maybe it took me a little while to get my courage back since they are a fairly intimidating pair, but I got there eventually.
"You got it, Iron Mom. So will you protect me from wrath coming for me on the red white and blue wings of an eagle? Please? Hawks don't do so well against eagles."
He forced his attention back to the matter at hand - exterminating the last of the demon dogs. There was at least an end in sight now, with their ranks shrinking instead of swelling. The clean-up of hell hounds went even faster once the Benatar broke through the clouds, firing on the monsters while the hatch opened to spit out Quill, Gamora, Nebula and Drax. It was a breeze after that, and much sooner than Tony would have anticipated the din of battle was replaced with the unnerving silence that always came after.
"Only because you and Nat tricked me while I was dying! I was very drunk--"
To anyone engaged in any protests: know your rights and stay safe out there.
By the time dinner rolled around Tony was usually exhausted, so he could shoo everyone else gently away and get some more time alone with his fella. Well, his fella and their metal kids, because the three 'bots had a hard time not being with at least one of them. Steve got it completely so he never scolded or tried to force them to 'sleep' elsewhere. Their charging stations just managed to fit in their bedroom, and as a temporary solution it worked just fine. Sleep was a careful, cautious affair so he didn't disturb Tony too much but he didn't mind because at least the genius was back in his arms.
"Did you just... did you just tell me to get over it?"
Then he got to wake up still tangled with Tony and do it all over again.
As Iron Man, co-leader of the Avengers, he was not allowed to indulge in any of those things.
Fri didn't laugh, but Steve thought she might have if she could. "This Pegs sounds interesting."
"Our woods are big enough for Tappy's family too," he told her with a smile. "You'll have ta help us explain though, and help us figure out how ta get 'em there safely." Her chest puffed out for a moment, like she was pleased with the responsibilities, but then deflated a little. That didn't last long either before that jaw was jutting out in a stubborn set he recognized well - all their human kids wore the expression frequently.
"... you know what? I'm gonna strike the nickname 'Peppy Princess' from my vocabulary entirely."
"He lets you use
"No, that was you and Peter. I spent that whole talk laughin' at you idiots. Besides, if you think Parker isn't gettin'--"
. "Like I've said, there doesn't appear to be any damage remaining to their bodies. Everything has healed quickly - too quickly. What's left is a little bit of scar tissue, and I don't think Steve's heart will ever be quite the same, but overall they're healthy. There's nothing for the Cradle to fix."
“Oh my-- hey Butler Man?”
"A promise. It'll also be a strike on your record."
"Spider-Man and Maverick are ready for new orders, Captain Marvel. Platypus, you wanna come help me blow shit up?"
"Fri says we're needed home ASAP," Tony told him without preamble once he was close enough. "She says it's nothing bad, but she won't give me details either. This better not be a dirty trick to get me to leave without Peter and Harley." He couldn't hear FRIDAY's answer since the nanotech she was using to communicate was linked directly to Tony, so he had to watch his lover and guess what it was. Didn't work so good, mostly because Tony refused to give anything away. "I mean it, young lady," Tony said after a while. "If there's nothing there I'm going to ground you."
“I want Vietnamese,” Clint muttered, still scowling at Bruce. “And that was cheating.”
them, and you don't get bored of throwing the ball for Dum-E, you've never yelled at Butterfingers for taking your mug, and I know U has run over your feet at least three times today alone, but you never..."
“That is cheating!” Clint cried, flinging an accusing finger at Bruce. “You know you’re his favorite and you are playing dirty.” Tony wasn’t really sure what he was talking about - though Bruce was his favorite Avenger if he didn’t count Steve - and he didn’t care either. He wanted to get Brucie his Reuben and tuck him into bed.
~.~.~
Tony slumped over, expression closing off as he came to that realization out loud. It wasn't one that Steve agreed with though. Not given the context and their histories and even the less pleasant set of visitors they'd gotten. God, he wouldn't blame the man for curling up around him and demanding he never leave after the day they'd had. His lover wasn't an asshole - he was human, and he was hurting.
"You made me arrows that explode into clouds of purple glitter. Do you have
"I"m not supposed to go anywhere with strangers. Mr. Doctor Strange didn't give me a choice though." She craned her whole body around to scowl at the man, and Tappy even shook one tiny, furry little fist. He quickly broke into a coughing fit to keep from laughing. "So I probably shouldn't go with you even if it does sound nice."
Winter was immediately, noticeably different from the man he'd known a lifetime ago. For one thing, Buck would have stayed in bed and refused to leave home if his hair had ever been so uneven. He was man enough to admit that it looked extremely attractive, however, the way the top of the man's hair and one side were long enough to reach his left shoulder while the right side was cut close to the scalp. The little braid he could see was a nice touch, and the style emphasized Winter's cheekbones and haunting eyes.
She looked up at him with gorgeous, trusting brown eyes and let her tail thud against the ground a few times. His girl was probably as calm and relaxed as she was going to get which meant he should try to get her out of there. Easing his phone out of his pocket without disturbing her was hard; ignoring the coos of the small crowd of spectators he'd gotten was even harder. He was probably going to be in the news again, which was annoying and made him just a little bit angry every time it happened.
"I tolerate you."
what he needed.
"Harley." Fuck, did his kid think his name wasn't going to be right there on the paperwork next to Peter's? He would
"Going to have to go with no."
"That is patently false."
His search finally yielded results when he looked over at the bar... and what he saw just about broke his heart. Tony was there, a bottle with a familiar label in one hand and a glass in the other. Oh, it wasn't
. That was even worse than the movie. Why would anyone make a stuffed animal that big?"
Steve gave him a warm, sweet smile before tucking his face against his neck. "I am home, ya goof. You're here, ain't ya?"
There's a brief period of time when Tony's personal space is being invaded by two people at a party that he is definitely not comfortable with. It doesn't become anything more/worse, but I wanted to let you all know just in case anyone finds such mentions triggering. It happens in the third section of this chapter if anyone needs to skip to the end of it or skim or whatever.
Her attempt at a Brooklyn accent drew out a bark of laughter. Tony turned their way at the sound, and Steve forced a smile onto his lips before quickly averting his gaze. Probably everyone knew that he was always staring at the genius, but the genius
"Captain? If you'll just step inside, Sir is waiting for you. And may I say that you look rather dashing."
"Sorry he's struggling like he is. I know it's 'specially rough on you and your ma."
It wasn't until he was seated next to an equally zoned-out Tony, both of them eating their stew, that he realized there were other people on their floor too. Peggy was there, talking with Fri about where 'everyone' could sleep. Jan and Hank were huddled together on one of the couches, Clint perched on the coffee table in front of them and all three looking at... something? A schematic maybe? As he chewed on the meat and potatoes in his last bite, he scanned the room again and found Natalia ensconced in one corner, looking over a truly frightening arsenal of weaponry. They were all dressed for combat, his exhausted brain finally registered. They'd... come to fight?
That was supposed to be my job. I brought him to Soul the first time.
With Harley there, smiling and waving brochures in his face, Tony could almost believe it was true. And maybe the other shoe would drop, maybe they would regret it in the years to come, but he wanted more than anything to stay in the moment where they were home, happy, and with nothing more pressing than helping Harley choose a college on their plates.
"Kinda. There's a whole, you know. Set of steps."
"So she's always a spoilsport then. Good to know."
"Holy shit."
For that he could leave their room, he decided as he watched Tony doze in the safety of his arms. He and Viz could get breakfast ready together maybe, spend a little time talking before joining the wounded genius.
"You know... I don't think he did. Steve. Why didn't you punch Rogers in the dick."
"Holy shit. We live here and we didn't even know." Because now that he thought about it, most of their stuff had migrated to their 'vacation' house. When they visited the tower it was just that - a visit. They never went back for long stretches of time, usually only for a couple of days while they took care of some kind of business. Most of the time Rhodey, Pep and their human kids came to them, not the other way around. He hadn't even known Harley had been
"I ain't sure this is even dancin' at all. I think your game and your little sensor thing might be confused."
"Can't wait for ya ta meet her. So whadda ya say?"
"... we need to get her something to eat though. Cheeseburgers first, I think."
"Not at all. Though he doesn't seem to mind James."
~.~.~
, and he hadn't had to bleed for the privilege. An impossible thing had just happened and he couldn't help but believe it, even if it was well after breakfast. Maybe another impossible thing was on the horizon, one that was even better and meant that he had a shot at an impossibly amazing future.
"Yeah. Deal. Whatever. Shut up, I am not blushing."
"Not out loud, but your smile was speaking for you."
"Not my call. I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States, and if he wants to paint my suit--"
It was inevitable, because he was Iron Man.
"Hell, I'd let him kill me before that happened. He and Natalia worked themselves ta the bone ta unravel what those bastards did ta him. Nearly ripped him apart inside too from what they told me. He's been completely his own man for almost two whole years now, so ya can get off your high horse Rogers. I didn't come here ta steal nothin' from ya either, ya dumb prick. I came 'cause Winter didn't want ta come alone, and he only came ta try'n help."
The New Avengers. Mr. Stark may be our CRO, but he is involved in this project only as part of--
"You only like that song so much because it's so relatable."
I would like to remind you that I am also an auxiliary member of the New Avengers, Mr. Poppleton. I am well aware of the internal politics of the Committee regardless of your attempts to downplay them. I am cooperating with this-- this investigation of yours because I believe in the Accords despite nonsense like this, and I will follow the rules and procedures agreed upon in them. You are welcome to ask questions about the involvement of SI in creating protections for our planet and the people of Earth, but I will not tolerate your fishing expedition when it comes to Mr. Stark. It is clear that you came to this meeting unprepared to fulfill your role, so I believe we are done here for now. Do you agree?
"Alas, I have oodles of work waiting for me. We're getting close to a couple major breakthroughs at SI." Usually that was all he would give, because he didn't think Cap would be interested. Bruce might be though, and he did still have Cap's full attention. "I've got a couple different solutions from R&D that I need to play with - and I'd still love for you to come play with me, Brucie - to see which has the most potential. Clean energy is only a few 'eureka' moments away and I didn't need a damned Tesseract to get there. Loki and Fury can both suck it." Tony was pretty sure that was another laugh Captain America was hiding behind one hand. It was pretty much the best day ever, and he definitely needed to get the fuck out of there. "Hope to see you in a couple hours Bruce. If you bring anything but coffee into my workshop I will have to ban you. Later Cap."
"Pops! On your left!"
Though he did wish T'Challa and the Dora Milaje had chosen their building as well. Those dames had the best stories, and the King himself had the kind of wry humor that he appreciated very much.
"'Course. Lady's out. Oh, I like the name Beacon too, but I'm not... I don't think it fits. Next dog maybe."
Then I want to maybe do some newspaper article type things, or some transcripts from interviews? Maybe some communications back and forth from the two teams? 'Cause in this version Thanos doesn't come for another three years, so I gotta get my bbys to that point. XD
Many more thanks for continuing to read. :D
"Bet it's not even close to the craziest story you have. I might have to try and get you drunk so I can hear more." He just rolled his eyes at the tease, shoving against Clint without actually pushing him away. When he looked back up, Captain America's expression was strangely tight as he looked between them, and he couldn't help but flinch a little. It was like he offended the guy just by existing sometimes.
"I think you might be right, Tony. This is clearly the start of something magnificent."
"I saw the memorial for him. Would it be okay if I, you know. Made something? He wasn't mine, but--"
Which didn't stop him from absolutely spoiling Brian, the spitting image of Winter, right alongside his sister. 'Uncle Shellhead' doted on them endlessly, while Lokes looked on with a smile.
The serious tone of his voice sent tingles of delight up Steve's spine, and if he'd been standing his knees probably would have gone a little weak. Christ, Tony was going to start hugging him. Tony was maybe going to
"Can it, short stack - the adults are talking."
So as he sucked down his first bottle of water, using manners his ma would smack his bottom with a wooden spoon for, he deliberately ignored the other people in the room. Because he wasn't a wasteful jerk he refilled the bottle from the sink instead of just grabbing a new one. Clint and Nat made fun of him for it; Tony had put some kind of filter on the faucet and never mentioned it again. During that second bottle he didn't have to think so hard about not listening to anyone else, and by the time he was slowly sipping at the third he was busy thinking about whether he wanted to spend the rest of his afternoon painting or if he'd rather go for a walk. In fact he had almost forgotten that anyone else was in the room...
that Tony might get close enough to touch him.
"No. But I didn't want to spook you and I didn't... I love being your friend. I didn't want to lose that by asking for more. So I figured..."
, and he was so sincere and earnest that it kind of hurt. People did not get like that over him, not really. But Captain America was. Howard's long-lost friend and hero, the one who could never, ever find a single redeeming quality in someone like Tony, seemed like maybe he wanted to be friends.
“Listen my friends! We must not forget the merits of the most soulful of cooking. They are running a special on jumbalaya--”
~.~.~
call ya James."
"Ooh! I do that sometimes too!" STAR launched herself off Winter's hand and began to circle his head, dipping one arm down and then the other as she did. Winter was watching her with another one of those little smiles, and his girl was a gift. "Yesterday my mission was to steal all the pens on the common floor without anyone noticing."
"... once I thought I'd buy a farm and retire there with Pep."
"I love you."
squeezed back, sending him another warm smile as he did. The kids moved to stand behind them, and just before it was too late STAR swooped into the room, toting a heavy-looking bag bigger than she was. She landed on his shoulder with a few feigned pants of exertion... and then they were moving.
"Everyone. It's part of the gig, and I don't think that's a bad thing. It keeps us humble, keeps us from gettin' too reckless. It's
"I know, sweetheart. I know I'm big and prob'ly scary looking. You take your time getting used to me, okay? Kid I sent off to get you a treat should be back soon, unless he ran off with the money I gave him. Never can tell, but you can hope, isn't that right sweetheart? Yeah, you just have to keep hoping. You're gonna be a beauty once I can get you home and taken care of. Always wanted a dog, you know? And Tony won't kick you out, I'm sure of it. Rescued a bunch of rats one time, ain't no way he'd make me put you back on the streets."
"I'm going in!'
Thank God Quill and Gamora estimated Thanos was at least an Earth week away.
Tony didn't want that many souls on his conscience. His hands were bloody enough as it was. But if things didn't change and Carol didn't make the call... he would be the one to tell FRIDAY to do it. All he could do was pray he wouldn't have to.
In a joint statement, the co-leaders of the New Avengers (Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes AKA War Machine and Captain Carol Danvers AKA Captain Marvel) have announced the lineup of the New Avengers Initiative. "The actions of a few former colleagues have damaged our reputation and standing in the international community," Rhodes said when pressed. "This new incarnation of the initiative aims to correct that." Captain Danvers added: "Working within the bounds of the Accords we can and will make a positive difference without violating the sovereign rights of those countries willing to accept our help."
friend, and it had him feeling kind of giddy. Especially with the way Tony had lit up like the sun the first time he had heard Steve use the name. He liked making Tony happy.
- but that would be okay. He would still get to meet his hero, and maybe, just maybe, he would get to see Howard smile the way he did in the pictures Aunt Peggy and Jarvis sometimes showed him.
"Uh-huh. Sure it would." He finished the last of his stretches, sighing happily at the light pull in his muscles. It had been a good match, and it was just so nice to be able to let go. "You ever thought mebbe they'd be happier fawnin' over the real you?"
Probationary
take care of himself. No matter what he thought of himself, Steve knew his lover would have been able to stand up to Rogers and the others even if he'd been on his own. Maybe it would have been harder and scarier, but his fella never backed down from a fight that needed to be fought. "I'm not though. 'Cause even if ya didn't need me ta do it, I still..."
, that he wasn't going to throw everything they had away for anyone, not even Bucky.
"I dunno. Sometimes if you add enough sugar it almost tastes like something."
"I brought a gun."
He has enslaved two of us already.
"No I won't be, because maybe he likes me but he don't want me for that role. Still. I'll take it if I gotta because that kid needs it, but he'll be comin' ta the tower. It's my home too'n I got all-a the same permissions ya do. He's gonna be here whether ya get your head outta your ass or not. But you're gonna be the one ta tell him, face-ta-face, that ya don't want ta work with him. I'm not takin' that bullet for ya, not when I think that deep down ya know that Peter would be far better off if you're in his corner."
"Yeah. Not leavin' his side for a while yet." Steve gave him a gentle squeeze and he let his eyes slide shut as he sighed. It was still so hard to believe that Steve was there, that he had come back. That he was staying. That only happened in his wildest, most unrealistic dreams. Shit like this didn't happen to him, not ever, and he wasn't quite sure what to do with it. He didn't know if he was quite ready to really believe that Steve wouldn't be leaving again.
"Tony... ya don't have ta--"
"Harley!" Tony's shout almost immediately gave way to a gasp of pain and a few hacking coughs that he knew hurt the man even worse. There wasn't much he could do besides shift his fella a little, trying to relieve some of the pressure as he ran a soothing hand down his side.
the way he liked it.
The Vision was one of the strangest, most awkward beings he had ever met and Steve had instantly wanted to tuck the android under his wing and make sure that he was really okay. There was just something so sad about him, even when he gave those small smiles to Tony and fussed over the both of them. He sounded just like Jarvis and the AI named after him, and Christ that must have ripped his fella into pieces when his loss was fresh. It probably still did to some level, but it was clear the two of them had done some bonding. Not enough based on the way they both were still fumbling a little but still. The process had started and he could tell the two of them cared an awful lot about each other.
"Tony..."
feelings?”
Those clever fingers dug into the perfect spot, and he couldn't help but moan and go boneless. Tony only laughed and kept his focus on that area, working it until the little knot of tension was gone. "So how about you call Miss Margaret and Shellhead and get them working on things? I'll talk to Pep, Rhodey and Carol and see what kinds of loose ends we need to tie up before we go. I don't want them calling us for every little thing, especially not at first. I don't mind if it's some kind of emergency, but--"
“You’re cleaning him up,” he finally told Steve. “I’m not dealing with that. He’s going to want to hold a fire extinguisher the whole time and if it goes off you’re cleaning that up too. Oh, and you’re dripping that gunk on my floor, so--”
"See, she gets that from you. If Fri or any of the boys start displaying homicidal urges--"
He mostly chalked it up to Steve not realizing that these days people wouldn’t just assume they were friends. It had been different back in the day, when as long as you weren’t kissing guys in front of anyone people were happy to assume men were only interested in women. Steve was just… just still not completely adjusted to modern culture.
"The other 'bots you're... 'managin' are playing tug of war with a pretty flashy looking wrench - that torque one ya got at mad at me for not knowin' about I think."
"And then you, me and Peter are going to sit down with Rhodey and Captain Danvers and really hash out this whole... junior superhero thing. All the rules and safety features and what it actually looks like. I took Peter into a fight that he wasn't ready for--"
They were on the prowl, the two of them. If Steve hadn’t looked so fucking panicked Tony would have let him have a kinky good time. Threesomes could be a lot of fun if you were in the right mood. He wasn’t, but they didn’t need to know that until Steve had gone to hide with Bruce.
. You're drunk Steve, go home."
"I'm okay. Better than I was," he amended when he heard Steve's sigh of frustration. "I'm only lying a little and only because I'm starving. I thought my little beam of starlight was making us breakfast?"
Because of their relationship - the one they've never officially acknowledged but haven't done much to hide either - Tony Stark was also present during my interview with the elusive hero. In fact, he was alone in the living room when I arrived, sprawled on one couch with his trademark sunglasses nowhere in sight. He was dressed more comfortably than I've ever seen him, including bare feet and a bit of scruff surrounding his usually immaculate beard.
Excuse me?
that we're all afraid of a teammate gettin' hurt or killed, or that a bystander might pay the price for our mistakes. We're always afraid of what might happen if we aren't enough to stop the bad guy. And they don't get much badder than the guys we fought today. So yeah, Peter. I was scared and I'll bet my suit that everyone else was too."
"Jarvis taught her," Steve murmured against his hair. That... hurt, but not enough that it kept him from smiling. Of course Jarvis would have. The man he'd known had been an amazing cook and happy to share the knowledge with anyone he cared about. STAR would have easily been able to charm her way into his heart
"There's a team on standby at the--"
"We can't get married in six months, you mook."
So my brain has mostly been eaten by that monster, and I haven't had a lot of time to give to this. I have a lot of stories left in this universe, to be honest, but they will come very slowly and irregularly.
"We've been upgrading," the little robot snarked, flying through the air between them to join their dance. "Let me try."
Steve was just going to have to suck it up and do it no matter how he felt about it.
"Ha! That's my honey bear, interfering without confessing for me."
"I'd be just as happy to cuddle the fuck out of Captain America. Now that I know you're not hug-averse, buckle up buttercup. We are now people who hug."
Thanks so much for continuing to read!! <3
"I never considered it might be Loki behind your appearance," Natasha answered, making a hysterical laugh start to bubble up his throat. She was so right, just not in the way she thought she was, and fuck they were a mess. "I let it go before and ignored how convenient it was that you showed up just when he was most vulnerable. I should have looked closer."
"It depends on one's perspective, I suppose, and is also entirely dependent on the outcome."
"Shellhead's always been after me ta invest in real estate. I'll buy a place."
"I don't want to carry the guilt of keeping you away from them. I don't want to be that person." Tony looked so sincere, so heartbreakingly honest, that Steve went and fell in love with him all over again. It was sort of funny how often that happened.
"But--"
"You're the pinnacle of perfection and don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise." Bruce rolled his eyes and even blushed a little, but he had that little smirk tugging at his lips again, so Tony was pretty sure he was pleased. "Hey, what are you doing later? I've been playing with energy solutions lately and I think some of it might be right up your alley. I could use another set of eyes, if you don't mind. Then we could blow shit up for a while or work on the Hulk Pants problem if you'd rather be productive."
"Now workshop sex?"
"She won't bite. Hasn't bitten me anyway, but I can't get up or she'll get antsy. Come a little closer so I can reach. Once I've got the bags you can leave. There any change for you to keep?"
“You don’t have to do that.”
~.~.~
"You always were a little shit."
Bucky."
As he thought about it more, there was a tightness in his chest. The world began to tunnel in around him, and the sounds of the forest warped into something almost unrecognizable when they hit his ears. Was he going to pass out? It kind of felt like he might pass out, and he wasn't even sure why--
, the place had come with a large suite for him and Steve, three bedrooms to split between the kids, a kitchen large and gorgeous enough to make Steve cry, and a living room with a fireplace he'd immediately fallen in love with. The garage had been easy enough to re-purpose into a workshop, though it meant he had to be more aware of how loud he played his music while he worked. Steve had claimed the attic as an art studio for himself - their first 'improvement' had been a lift that would allow U access to it as well. They'd added an extension for visitors when they realized that
"... they didn't put that in the history books either. You're portrayed as a very straight virgin in most of them." Steve snorted and buried his nose in Tony's hair, letting himself breathe the genius in one more time. It was so, so hard to let him go, but hugs couldn't last forever.
His new team made things incredibly unpredictable all the time. Dinner was no exception and he got that. Tony knew that always having someone they could eat with was a novel experience for all of them. He knew why they had dinner together every night barring extreme emotional distress, city threatening battles, or looming deadlines Pep would brutally enforce… though that last one only applied to him. They liked the routine, liked having everyone in the same room participating in the ritual. Hell, they even seemed to like the arguments they had over what they should actually eat. He totally understood and appreciated all of it.
Thanks so much for reading! :D
"Sorry. It's just... why now? It's not even the first time I almost died, which would make it a little easier to swallow. So help me understand? Please? Because I'm floundering here, Pep."
And it would be on his own because he'd be losing his Tiny Adorable Steve soon. His team had found
"Cheeseburgers it is.
“You are aware, of course, that I have multiple cameras located in the training facility? There is also a crystal clear audio recording.”
God, he was pathetic. He didn't really know that Tony wanted a dog and he was already planning on them being pet co-parents. But surely it wasn't that different than the 'bots - he always called them his kids now, and the genius never objected. He'd taken to Tony's kids, and if he brought the pup home then he was sure Tony would do the same for her.
"I'm sorry Pegs," he said quietly, hoping like hell she'd believe him. "I wasn't thinkin' straight. I shoulda been talkin' ta all-a ya all along. I promise it won't happen again."
"I have no idea what you're talking about." Harley snorted, sounding so much like Steve that he had to smile. Several Defenders were sure that the kid was somehow biologically theirs and he loved it more than he should. Though he didn't like that it meant Harley was wise to both of their tricks, and was an observant little shit to boot. "Seriously. This is our getaway spot, Harls. We live in the tower."
So of course it was during Katy Perry's masterpiece entitled 'Firework' that he turned - with a very impressive flip of imaginary hair - and came face to face with Captain freaking America.
"Yes! It's Bucky
"Fine then, a year. But we're announcing the engagement tomorrow."
"No you wooon't," he sing-songed before pressing a loud smooch on Tony's temple just to be obnoxious. "You love me and would never make me homeless that way. Because I can't go back to living at SHIELD after such extravagance, Tony. I just can't. Also, I am deeply wounded that you think I would do anything at all to a drink of yours. Cut to the core. Hey Steve, you wanna come with?"
."  U made a chirpy little beep, then came his way. Little disaster almost didn't stop in time, and the only reason Steve didn't tip over was the arm he slung around the 'bot's main strut. "Yeah yeah. Your brother'n sister'n ya are part of the reason why things are so good. Don't have ta bowl me over 'cause of it." The whistle that earned was full of doubt, and as Peggy and Loki chuckled the 'bot headed back over to his new friend.
"Thanks Tony." He got another kiss to his cheek, this one a smacking smooch that was more playful than anything. "But know that ya really are settin' up a revolvin' door. They're all gonna show up whenever the hell they want now."
to go back to the Raft."
"Bruce. Tony."
"If ya say what I think you're gonna say, you'll be grounded for a week. The plane's about ta land. Ya don't wanna be here'n neither do I. There's a few-a us that'd rather be pretty much anywhere else. But ya listen here," Steve didn't have to bend down to reach Harley's level, but he did lean forward and locked eyes with the teen. It was effective in that at least Harley stopped scowling and had a more serious look on his face. "This was an Avengers decision. We all got together'n voted. The three-a ya voted too, and when ya participated in that vote--"
"We gonna watch it'n eat popcorn or somethin'?"
even if they weren't married. "So we could take the time to make it perfect ourselves. Well. Maybe we'd ask Ben and Pep to come for a visit so he could give us some pointers, see if there's anything we need the professionals for. But otherwise I bet we could get it all done with our own hands."
“Eh-heh. Riiiiight. Creepy - I like it. And I’m not lying! So just tell me how long Iron Mom has been doing his… science… stuff.”
A unibeam was his best bet, but he was glad to see Rhodey busting out his missile launchers instead. Rhodey's armor hadn't gotten all the same upgrades as his own yet. War Machine's missiles still had a bit more kick than its unibeam, and they could be used a lot more frequently.
"Punisher is down! We need an evac--"
Nat kept bringing him homemade Russian deliciousness that the hospital staff was too terrified to forbid. Clint in his turn would show up with fun, stupid little distractions to keep Tony from fuming about how he wasn’t allowed to work on any schematics until his concussion was a little more under control. Thor regaled him with epic tales from Asgard and the other realms while Bruce made sure he got the occasional caffeinated beverage and a lot of decaf tea between them.
"I'm really, really glad you two are happy here. You both deserve it."
, taking a moment to organize his pencils.
"Fuck no. I'd be a terrible farmer and so would you. Mostly I liked the idea of being away from the city, out in the country surrounded by nothing but wilderness. Fuck, that sounds corny. I just have always been in the city or at the beach. For a vacation I want something different. Quiet. With maybe space to build a kick-ass workshop to play around in with the kids."
"Forget I asked. I'll have her show me the way. Steven? I'm very glad to see you again." Before he could answer she swept out of the room, already talking to FRIDAY to locate STAR.
"Harley? I understand. Believe me when I say I do. But ya gotta understand somethin'." Steve's face had gone all soft and compassionate, and all he wanted to do was wrap his lover up in a tight hug and hide in him until this was over. "We're a team, right? All-a us. Your Uncle Rhodey and Carol decided we were all gonna get some input on this - they were trustin' us when they did that. Most of us decided ta put our personal feelin's aside and bring the Rogue Avengers back home. They ain't joinin' the team ta be part-a it the way we are, right? They ain't earned that yet. Right now we're just showin' a united front ta bring them home. That's what bein' a team is about sometimes. And if nothin' else, do ya think there's any way Tony's walkin' off this tarmac?"
, at least in the ways that matter. Honestly, if you and Winghead weren't so disgustingly happy I'd be suggesting you track the Loki here down and see if there's something there." Apparently his expression said all that needed to be said, because Shellhead started to laugh. "I know, I know. I just don't... I don't like the idea of him being unhappy, and from what Fri has told me he's got to be pretty fucking miserable."
“We’ve already had pizza three nights this week. I’m getting sick of all the grease and cheese. I bet Tony is too, aren’t you Tony?”
and Steve didn't even fucking have a speech planned yet. "I, uh. Talked to Thor. About what I'd have to do to get an apple. Two maybe, depending on how the serum works out in the end. He thinks I've got a good shot and he said he'd bring it up with his ma as soon as... well. Guess he's going to be talking to her soon."
kept a name. I chose my own." Winter paused, then shrugged one shoulder. "Sometimes I let people call me James."
"Sure it isn't."
"That'd be me, Boss! We did some bonding while you and Steve were asleep. Sister stuff."
Maybe it would be easier if he hadn't seen pretty much this exact scene in the movies. Sure a brightly lit frozen yogurt place usually wasn't the right setting, but for a kid who couldn't be more than fifteen it probably fit just right. And maybe he didn't have any goons hovering over his shoulder, but the teenager sitting across from him still looked appropriately awed and terrified. Where Steve was in jeans and a t-shirt the kid was in his Sunday best - bowtie and all - with his hair slicked back and a slight tremor in his hands. He was pretty sure they were getting to the part where he was asked either for his daughter's hand or for a little help making the kids bully problems ‘disappear’.
Anthony has superior craftsmanship," here both 'bots gave an offended beep and even Fri made a rude noise through her speakers. "But he hasn't yet managed to give his creations such... life. I hadn't expected to see such a thing here, to be honest. I would have thought this little planet centuries away from such a feat. His is special, your love."
“That Dr. Doom is just so…” she shivered theatrically, using the opportunity to press her chest against his arm. He suppressed the urge to shove her away and forced himself to chuckle instead. “He’s so creepy. If it wasn’t for you and that brilliant plan…”
"Get that judgey look off your face, Harley Keener. Judgey McJudgersons don't get cool workshop presents. Also, stop trying to lock Peter out of the work space on that floor. You know you're supposed to share it with him."
So of course that was when Tony laid a hand on his forearm.
"Let's get you home, princess. It looks like you aren't hurt too bad, but I didn't want to put a leash on that awful collar of yours. Cuttin' that off first thing, I promise. I'm gonna call a car-- no, I'm gonna call Clint. Animals all seem to love him, so hopefully you won't run scared once he pulls up. I think Happy might scare ya away even if he's a big softy, yes he is. Clint'll know what to do'n then we'll get you home. Christ, I can't wait to introduce you to Tony. He's gonna love you, I just know it. And I'm sure you'll love him too. He's awful easy to love. Just you wait and see. It might be weird, living with us Avengers, but I'll make sure you're taken care of, don't you worry."
"First off, I ain't no clone. Sooner ya get that through your fat head the better. Nat here oughta know better, so I dunno why she let ya talk her inta this."
"Lies. Most of them are lies and I'm done with those. Now butt out and let him answer my question."
Which was fine by him - he had a castle to manage, dragons to merge, and memes just begging to be sent to his kids.
"FRIDAY."
"I'm gonna need ya ta take a breath," he interrupted, mildly alarmed at the pace and direction of the words leaving the man's mouth. "And stop bein' so damn stupid while you're at it. Do ya really think I'm gonna just go flyin' off just because--"
"Are you going to be on the front lines then Pep? Because--"
"I'd start thinking of a convincing lie then, Spangles, or we're going to be down here a looooong--"
“Woah!” Clint’s concern was overblown - he had hardly even stumbled after launching himself into the air. U had been ready with a handy strut so really everything was fine. Clint didn’t need to follow after him… but it was kind of sweet that he did it anyway. “Tony, I was only a little serious about that whole life or death thing. Why are you--”
"Why'd ya break all those bones anyway?"
It was damn close to a fucking
had already vehemently refused to use the name Captain America in this world, which was sort of a shame because the one they'd wound up with kind of sucked. As entertaining as it would be, he couldn't send the guy out to fight naked either.
King T'Challa AKA Black Panther
Unfortunately, we didn't have all day to sit and chat. Steve and Tony have taken in several teens and a few younger children, and they had plans with 'the kids' later. I've been invited back another time, and I look forward to the chance to get to really prepare for an interview knowing who Maverick is. Before I left, I couldn't help but bring up one last thing.
Tony Stark did not blush just because there was a naked guy a few feet away. Close enough to still hear talking to Dum-E even over the water and his ‘bot’s complaints. Steve was naked and close enough that Tony could see, if he wanted. Could touch if Steve would let him.
“I vote we watch Parks and Rec with dinner.”
"It's bullshit."
." She watched him a moment to make sure her point had made - it definitely had. Having all the Defenders and his other friends descend on them at once would be absolute chaos. Loki would probably love it, but no one else would have much fun. Once she decided he knew she meant business, she gave a brisk nod and then pressed a kiss to his cheek. "There's a luv. You're looking well."
A small part of his mind registered the way Tony's arm had gone slack around him while Loki slid both his arms around Shellhead's waist and squeezed tight. Most of him, however, was numb with hope and disbelief, because if they'd found him, if they'd
"They'll be back soon," he murmured against the shorter man's temple. "And we'll... we'll figure something out, because this
I am offering you the chance to rethink your approach. Again, I am more than happy to go into detail regarding SI's involvement with the New Avengers and some of the leading scientific figures in protecting Earth, but I'm not sure you have enough of a working knowledge of what the project actually is to ask relevant, probative questions.
"I scared three of them away. Viz almost gave the fourth a heart attack when he forgot about doors again. With Friday monitoring me and help no farther away than it would be in a hospital anyway, we all agreed that it would be better if nobody hung around the floor all the time. I was really mean to some of those poor people. Do you think sending an apology fruit basket that includes a note that says I've paid off their debts would work?"
"Yes." The AI's firm response left no wiggle room for him to get out of this and he was proud as hell of her. "Boss was very disappointed when he realized that I was the one who told you about Captain America. I watched him cry. A lot. If I hadn't told you then you would have stayed here when Other Loki came to get you."
"He's better than he was," she told him quietly. Her gaze was on something he couldn't see a million miles away. "Natalia and I tracked him down, but we've done so before as well. Without Loki he would have slipped through our fingers again and be lost to the wind."
"He wanted us to have a mobile base of operations," Rogers said, a tic moving in his jaw. Tony thought maybe the King had wanted the rogues out of his country fast and giving them a... 'mobile base' was the easiest way to do it. "And that's not the issue here. I'm sorry Tony - I thought you would get that phone and my note. I didn't know it would be kept from you."
"Antosha!"
"I certainly don't think so. If you had given them each their own floor," she added, making Tony's cheeks burn as he silently vowed to
The two looked at each other, grinned, then shrugged in unison. "No promises," they chorused. It was creepy and wonderful, because there was the shield and Tony was
"Okay, I changed my mind. No superhero shenanigans for you."
"Sorry. Almost. You got me flowers," he added by way of explanation. "I saw 'em and I... I just... I knew. Had ta kiss you then." Something almost like sorrow passed over Tony's face and he couldn't help the wounded sound that punched out of his throat. He hated when the genius looked sad, especially when it was his fault that it had happened. Tony should never be sad, especially not now that they'd just started. "I'd love to hear your speech, sweetheart. Sorry I ruined--"
"Tony... you didn't have to do it 'right'. You never have to worry about doing something perfect - you're already so damn close to perfect in my book already that you don't have to try so hard."
The look Steve slanted over at him was full of mischief, and sometimes he wanted to kiss the man so badly that he ached with it. Clint smothered a snort in his shoulder and grunted when Tony planted a firm elbow in his stomach. That fucking nickname was going to stick now, and he was going to be ‘ma’ whenever Steve wanted to irritate him.
Surely you don't believe that aliens are on their way to attack.
Hey all! :D
"Love ya too Tony."
She was threatening his
"They came to tell you about
"Get your missiles in there, sour patch. I'll strip the defenses from the outside."
Hope could be a cruel thing. Tony had learned that both early and often, and he was hesitant to give into it again. But he'd heard Cap laugh, he'd seen Bruce Banner smile brighter than the sun, and he been the cause of both. He could give hope one more shot when it came to this.
"Uhm..." Damn it, he was blushing - he'd sort of hoped to avoid the whole thing during his eventual confession. But where he'd jumped the gun and cut off Tony's planned speech, Tony had jumped the gun by
Tony didn't seem to notice, because he never did.
"You think Harley and Rhodey can distract that thing long enough for us to do a combined blast?" As they both shot back towards the Nightmare Beast, it was almost like dancing. They were so well in sync, weaving around each other with ease. It was kind of amazing, something he would be reveling in if only the stakes weren't so damned high. "Dunno if STAR's got enough firepower to blast through from the inside."
"O...kay?" What the hell was going on? "The thing you're not allowed to tell me about - is it good or bad?"
Harley didn't think getting older made coping easier. He was pretty sure it was family that did it.
Dr. Strange
"Mmmm. You better."
"Could so."
"Fri agrees with me or he'd be able to get in. And you didn't answer my question which means--"
"Ain't nice ta kick a man while he's down, Starlight."
"Tony. That's not--"
"Wouldn't dare, you'd disembowel me in a way so impressive Nat would be asking you for murder tips. Anyway. Now that you have stamped the plans with your seal of approval, I'm going to call my construction crew. I'm thinking we'll start with the common floor and the one where the gym will be so I can pitch those to the team and see what they think."
He got it. Honestly the sight of the red, white and blue paint made him want to be sick. All he could picture in his mind was the moment a shield just like it had slammed down into his lover's chest and landed him in intensive care. He would have been happy to never see it again; he could only imagine what Tony was thinking.
Next chapter will be up next Sunday, or you may all come after me with pitchforks.
"Tony, no," he interrupted, for once doing it with laughter instead of scorn. "I don't want shoes, ya mook."
- was a babbling, nervous mess. Steve Rogers was apologizing, to
passed on one of those. So up he got to pad after her, doing his best not to gulp when she plopped down next to Clint.
"Huh? What are ya talkin' about?"
Not happening.
"Already landed. Don't think it's a dream." He looked over the room again, brain just a smidge more awake and aware after the partial meal. "They all look kinda mad. Don't think I'd dream 'em that way." Tony made a considering noise, then shrugged and went back to eating. The food was good, filling and he hadn't had to struggle through making it so Steve followed his example.
him! And that mean old witch in charge just laughed when I told her 'cause she says squirrels aren't any better than mice, and I maybe don't know a lot about mice since I can't talk to them the way I can Tappy, but I think they're just fine! Maybe she's the new... nusa... maybe she's the one that's awful! She's supposed to take care of me now that my parents... but she isn't! She's just being mean about Tappy and saying she's going to take him away and she can't because he's my best friend and... and... and he's been with me even when they... And anyway I'm not going back and you can't make me even if Mr. Doctor Strange thinks you can. And even if you do I'll just run away again! So there!"
Clint didn't rear back when Tony clapped his hands onto the archer's cheeks, which was... kind of nice. It was nicer still when Clint wrapped gentle, calloused fingers around his wrists and squeezed. A smile was tugging at his lips and there was none of the hardness that used to live in his eyes present. Clint was his friend, he realized suddenly. They weren't just teammates anymore.
Which includes, of course, weapons.
"Stuff like that is why you are the softy in this relationship,
They'd think the worst of him anyway, so when he lifted his right hand and waggled his gauntlet-covered fingers, he swept the glass of scotch up in his other hand. Still not to drink - probably - but props were essential to get him through this.
"What else is he
Having to crane his neck to look up at Harley was something Steve didn't think he'd ever get used to. At 18 Harley was almost as tall as Rogers, and he wasn't convinced the kid was done growing quite yet. Long hours of training and exercise had done wonders for a once gangly physique, and from the fan mail he was painfully aware that his son was now considered one of the hottest Avengers to a certain demographic.
"They better not try to come to the tower," Harley muttered before shoving at Kamala again. "And will you get
“He would not. He loves you.”
“No, the point is that you’re covering my ‘bot in that gross stuff. Why you stormed down here instead of just taking a shower--”
"Alas, my brother is still not well. My father's patience grows thin and there is only so much my mother and I can do to sway him. I swear to you that he was not himself when he attacked Midgard." They had been over that several times, but Thor still sounded almost desperate for Steve to believe him. "Loki did not invade this realm of his own free will. To be honest... if he had decided to do so in truth, he would have done so with ease. His trickery may be the cause of much grief, but it could win him most of the nine realms if he ever applied himself. We are lucky that he is so fixed on ruling Asgard and that his emotions regarding even that are so mixed."
"Ah ah ah! No. Until we've all had one of those delicacies, you need to remember that we're all mortal. I know that maybe Steve here confuses you, what with all the muscles, but you still can't smack him in the head with MewMew."
Tony knew that wherever JARVIS was, his brilliant, beautiful boy was proud.
"Pretty much."
. Sure it wouldn't have been romantic because there was no way Tony would want to kiss or anything else with that skinny, sickly version of him... but yeah. It was easy to believe Tony wouldn't have hesitated to get attached to little Stevie Rogers.
Tony stopped resisting pretty quick and began to deliver what had to be a really good scratch because she pressed hard against his leg and made a low sound of pure delight. The genius' lips were curved up in a tiny, barely there smile that lit him up inside and made him warmer than the sun ever could.
"Except apparently when you're sneaking your date into the tower. What are they going to think, huh?"
Tony would never forgive him though, which was the only thing keeping him from making that last concern a reality.
"I need some time in the 'shop. I'll be up before dinner."
It was a risk, but he'd spend the rest of forever kicking himself if he didn't take it.
"Yes. You were an adorable little bucket of sass and manipulation. Everyone needs to know that."
and it was like a Lovecraftian nightmare. Had this sand and glitter between my... uh. You probably don't want to hear that part of the story."
He would worry about them once the fucking
They still hadn't opened their eyes, but now... now Rhodey felt like they actually would again. The fear he'd been trying so hard to ignore, the one that whispered his best friend was dead and gone and his body just hadn't gotten the message yet, began to fade. Hope was a wonderful thing, and he couldn't wait to share it with the rest of their people.
been impressed on her few walks through the facility to meet with Fury to discuss what SI was and was not willing to help the organization with. "I know I would want to get out of there as soon as possible. The whole place is so depressing."
he was being an ass but stopping didn't feel like an option. Since Steve had come back he'd wanted so badly to believe it was forever, that he would be allowed to keep this. Finding out he couldn't
The way she flicked her hair as she turned away from them made her dismissal clear, and he hoped it hurt. He hoped it cut them to their very core, because Pep was the best of them - the best period. He prayed that they knew that, that they understood her worth, so that they would understand just what it meant to completely and utterly lose her respect.
"Give 'em hell, Twinkle Toes."
"Yes my conniving offspring?"
. As soon as Clinton caught sight of him, the ass leaped onto a table and saluted him with a mug full of what he suspected was Asgardian mead.
"... okay. Preemptive surrender then."
"Because you're an ass?" Harley muttered under his breath, a hint of a blush on his cheeks.
"As long as you promise you won't shoot any of them inside the tower." Clint pouted and Tony folded like a cheap suit. "Okay, okay - one with and one without a timer so you know how they fly. But only where we have wooden floors and no furniture! Glitter is a bitch to clean up, you know. It's like sand - gets everywhere and you're finding it in the weirdest places for weeks afterwards. Once I had to deal with glitter on a
He'd always been a man of action anyway.
"Nowhere fatal," Winter 'agreed', all even-toned and matter of fact like he was making any kind of sense. "But Agent Carter said--"
"You let me help you then, remember? You asked for my help and I did it. I did everything you asked--"
"Uh-huh."
Curses. His opponent knew him too well. Apparently. Which was weird because they hardly ever even
Rhodey and Carol were the ones standing nearest to the point of landing, both standing with their arms across their chest. His sourbear's jaw had developed a tic early that morning, it was set so tight, but he was there. He was there even though he'd voted 'no', ready to do what had to be done. The rest of the New Avengers were arrayed behind them, not a single one looking pleased to be there.
Until the attack on New York City--
- you came back for me. You wanted to be here and they can't have you back. I'll fucking fight them if I have to." Because Fri was as much of a dramatic shit as her old man and they both had impeccable timing, the Iron Man gauntlet snapped into place as Tony finished the last word, the whine of the arc reactor already filling the air. "Last time I couldn't... they
"My plans. Five years in is when we were supposed to get together."
Thanks for reading, comments are super-duper appreciated. <3
"Gee, thanks for the reassurance, Natalia."
"No! No, absolutely not. You do
"What the hell, Winghead?"
"You remember that I'm in charge, right? Your ass is still on the 'reserve' list, if I remember right." Rhodey was still swinging around to do as he'd asked, of course. The banter helped ease some of the tension, and he fucking
"We're fine, da. You and pops both made sure of that. And maybe havin' you both around would be nice, but I'm more interested in pops sittin' down and

"Hey! That is Tiny Adorable Steve and you will treat him with the same respect you give... no, wait. More respect than you give me."
annoying sister - he was the only one allowed to tease her.
"When Winghead is done with his primping we'll all talk about it," Shellhead grumbled against Lokes' shoulder. "Don't want to fight about it more than once." That was fair, Tony guessed. "How's the arm?"
With a sigh born of fond exasperation because Harley still tended to do the same thing, he reached for his wallet and pulled out a few bills. "Here. Go nuts, alright? Belly's prob'ly always yellin' at ya, huh? Let's try'n get it ta shut up for a bit."
If the thought put a little wiggle in his hips as he grooved to his music... well. No one would know but his boys. J was the only one who would be able to tell on him, and the AI had seen way,
But the pain will be worse before it is over.
Sorry for the babble, thanks for sticking with me and have a great week! :D
This is soooo late, I apologize profusely. Next chapter is going up too though, and the next two will be up by the end of the week!
“Done, Sir. Captain Rogers’ elevator has been slowed enough to delay his arrival by twelve seconds, which puts him almost a full twenty away. Do try and breathe Sir.”
right. Your handwriting is very recognizable, Mister Rogers, and you don't get to have it both ways. You very nearly killed Mister Stark--"
"Jan." The reprimand from Peggy was unexpected and harsh, but the other woman only grimaced before holding her tongue. "I'm sorry for intruding like this Steven. And to the rest of you as well - we have no intention of harming anyone, I promise you," she added to Tony, who of course still didn't lower his gauntlet. A brief smile tugged at her lips, the same fond exasperation on her face that anyone who loved a Tony Stark seemed to develop. "Or of snatching anyone away. We wouldn't have come at all, but--"
“Excuse me.”
. I just don't know where we could go where somebody wouldn't find us. As much as I love Rhodey and Pep and the other Avengers... it would be nice to not have them 'dropping by' and 'checking in' every few hours. And I wish Carol would stop asking if we want to help out. I know she's trying to help and get us back in the saddle, but--"
"If I hadn't been here at the beginning I would be nervous to meet Steve too. He's so important to Boss, after all." Besides that his and Vision's relationship was already a little strained and strange. Of course the man born of JARVIS would be nervous about a new variable being introduced to their balancing act. They were still so careful around each other as they navigated being family.
"Could I maybe get a wor--"
Fri was quick to agree to his plan - maybe too quick. He hoped Loki wasn't having a negative influence on his girl. All he needed was for FRIDAY to take a page out of the God of Chaos' book. Still. At least she was willing to play along.
“That was a battle well fought. I approve of your tactics!”
people Lokes would deign to call a friend. Besides, he was guilty of doing the exact same thing to both Rhodey and Pepper. So instead of jealousy, there was a warm happiness and just a tinge of relief.
Winter was suddenly at his back, and clapped one hand on the kid's shoulder to gently move him out of the way. Where Harley suggested and might have burst into tears if denied, Winter just acted. He went to Steve's bed first, mouth a thin line as he brushed a lank piece of hair off his friend's forehead. Then he squared his shoulders, put both hands on the side of the bed, and began to shove it toward Tony's.
Steve also knew it would probably be pretty much the only time he left the room, because being away from Tony for longer than it took to go to the bathroom hurt. Even though Rhodey was only a few floors away - and God had he cried right along with his fella on learning about the man's legs - he couldn't even think about going to see him. They'd briefly talked through Fri, the same way he'd exchanged a few words with Pepper, but he wouldn't see either of them physically until that evening when Pep got home from work.
Tony still guarded his flank the whole way there, because he wasn't about to leave a teammate twisting in the wind.
While he reached up and carefully cuddled her between his hand and the side of his neck, he got to watch Steve and Pepper close ranks. As one they turned and headed for the bar to join him, determination clear in both their strides. And maybe he knew his Tiny Adorable Steve would leave, and maybe he was a little upset that Pep had taken his
"A voice in the ceiling. They all treated him like he was
It only took a few quick strides to get around the bed and to his lover. Tony was so lost in misery and self-created angst to even notice his approach. That made it easy to sweep the man into his arms and hold on tightly while also tipping them over onto the bed. The move was unexpected enough that Tony broke into surprised laughter, and with warm affection running through him Steve followed suit. A few moments later they were snuggled together on top of the covers, facing each other and so close that their foreheads touched while they shared breath.
." Tony shifted so they could look at each other, then dragged Steve's legs into his lap. A massage was probably on the way, which he wouldn't object to at all. His genius had very clever fingers, after all. "It's not like we'd be unreachable either, if something huge happened or they needed us to consult. We could even come pop back in after a week or so and then go back. Fuck, I haven't had a real vacation in...." The prolonged silence caused his lips to twitch as Tony visibly tried to remember
He felt the moment Peter began to question himself, and he held in a sigh. As Spider-Man his brother was a quippy little shit who knew he had value; the young man behind the mask doubted himself way too much even after years of work. Before he could nip that in the bud, Peter started babbling nervously.
“Shhhhh!” Tony closed all the pertinent programs with a few flicks of his fingers and hoped Clint hadn’t gotten too good of a look at them. “Just… just shhhh. J, can you--”
"Nat is kinda my go-to agony aunt for this. I think she might kill you if I talked to you instead of her. Or even just to you once in a while when she was off doing something else."
He could feel Winter processing that, mulling the memory over to try and find its truth. It was nice to know his friend felt comfortable taking that time, that he didn't feel the need to either pretend the memory was there immediately or get defensive. At first Winter had treated every mention of a shared memory like an accusation. Now they could actually talk about the past and it was fine, as long as he didn't expect more than Winter could give.
"Maybe. An' hey - once this happens I'll actually get ta touch it proper again. Get ta touch ya all over actually, for as long as I want without the risk of ya fallin' asleep halfway through." That was definitely one of the perks and he couldn't deny he was looking forward to it. They'd managed to get around his injuries a little, and fuck had it chafed to watch Steve be so damn
"More requests for interviews and shit," Tony murmured into his shoulder while setting his tablet aside. "I turned most of them down. If that kid Caleb asks for another--"
Hey, so if the Russian I tried to use is totally wrong and someone more knowledgeable than me can help me fix it I would super appreciate it. <3 Especially on Nat's end - if Steve's answer is a little off I actually like it better that way. XD
"Or I'm just a glutton for punishment."
Out of the corner of his eyes he could see that STAR was glowing a soft pink instead of arc reactor blue, and he couldn't help but grin. His baby girl might have a new hero... or a new crush, who knew. It was hard to tell with AI’s sometimes.
"Okay. Tea is not my thing, but this is my favorite of everything you've made me so far. Keep in this vein, Brucie-bear. No more of the flowery herbal crap."
"That doesn't even make sense. Harley, did that make sense?"
"That story ended very differently than I think you think it did."
Well. That's-- the crux of the matter is-- concerns have been raised--
"Months." He couldn't help but start laughing which put a pleased light in Tony's eyes. A few moments later he pressed his mouth to Steve's in a clinging kiss before settling that dark head of hair on his shoulder again. "You think I'm kidding, which is adorable."
Actually--
"He's like five. He doesn't know what's good for him."
He'd just been afraid to get attached and lose her.
, because he knew they'd ask him to visit. They'd want to see him, to make sure he was okay. They were all dying to meet his family, and it would kill a little part of him to tell them 'no'.
STAR, meanwhile, was perched on Peggy's shoulder, and wow had it been interesting to meet such a young version of his aunt. She was a firecracker, just like Steve had described her. He was pretty fond honestly, and it hurt a lot less than he'd thought it would. Maybe it was the way she sometimes slipped into an American accent, or the way her jaw was just the littlest bit broader and her nose more upturned. Her eyes weren't right either - they were a lovely shade of green where Aunt Peggy's had been a warm but sad brown. Maybe meeting the Defenders wouldn't be quite as awful as he'd though.
I'll be out of town until Thursday. We could teleconference, but I would prefer to meet in person.
, and he would never get used to it enough to take it for granted. And he'd been having a hell of a lot of fun putting together a new superhero self for Steve - the thought of getting to do the same for Pepper had part of him eager to grab a pencil or hologram and dive right on in.
"Sentiment?"
with me."
"I don't sleep much. Don't need a lot of it anyway."
“It was fine,” he said instead of preening the way he wanted to. Steve let out a sound that was close to a growl, glaring back over his shoulder at where Tony assumed Probably-Nathan and Maybe-Debbie were still standing.
"Any reason I'm not gettin' a real one?" Tony froze, and an apology was immediately on his tongue. Before he could actually say anything though, the genius was on the move. He just about died when Tony wrapped him up in a fierce hug, doing his damnedest
he needed to do that - but he was rooted in place. At least that way he could see the way all three humans winced a little, expressions souring.
, like he was the last bit of toothpaste in a nearly empty tube. Just before he threw up... it was over.
4 - I hope you are all safe and doing well. <3
"Sure! I mean... yeah. Probably. Just let me check with Pep to make sure she doesn't need anything, okay? I'll come back in... ten minutes maybe? I'll bring food."
"That'd be nice. We could get married."
"Maybe so, but you're her ma. Gotta have your help with the naming, don't I?" Tony's mouth dropped open even wider than his eyes and he seemed to sag a little harder against the wall. She whined quietly and nudged his hand until he looked down at her, hand moving to scratch behind her ears. To his eyes Tony looked overwhelmed and maybe a bit teary, like maybe he hadn't realized that if Tony's kids were his then his kids damn well were Tony's too. Robot, dog, Avenger... didn't matter. He liked that they were in taking care of them all together.
Steve just had a thing about touching. He had noticed how uncomfortable Tony was and now wanted to protect him. It wasn’t a couple thing - it was a friend thing.
"Maybe a little. But so am I. All-a us are, but at least we got each other. He's got nobody and that ain't right."
"But Shellhead will want to make an
"Very wrong." Winter gave him a wolf's smile before turning his attention back to STAR. "But I will not prove that to her in the presence of a lady." With those words, the little ball of anxiety that had carved out a space in his chest finally began to uncurl and relax. If the other man was starting to warm up to STAR already, maybe they had a chance. Maybe this wouldn't be a disaster, and maybe, just maybe, they could learn how to be friends again.
"A house." Tony shifted enough that Steve's feet were comfortably in his lap and absently began to rub them as he thought out loud. "It would take too long to get one built. I wouldn't mind a fixer upper though. I'm pretty handy, and I bet I could teach you how to use tools too. We could turn it into a fun DIY project. I mean. If you're going to buy the place then we're going to be keeping it for more than just the vacation right?" The way Tony said 'we' had his stomach fluttering pleasantly. He liked the acknowledgement that things were
More than anything you have ever felt before, little Mechanic. But if you can bear it, if you make it through, then the threat of Thanos will be over. Your world and those you love will be safe, and I will never ask this of you again. It is your choice, however. We cannot force you.
"It was sweet-a them ta get Shellhead presents too."
"In fact, he'll probably be happy to have a pretty thing like you living at the tower with us. I think maybe he always wanted a dog too, so he'll probably spoil you rotten. Most all of the kids we've got are boys'n Nat only calls me pops when she wants something. It'll be nice to have a girl in the mix, I think. You'll be our little princess." Responding to his tone, she wagged her tail the smallest bit. It was hard not to fall all over himself in happiness, but he did his best to channel all that giddy joy into his voice while keeping his body relaxed. "That's right. You'll be our little princess and we'll take such good care of you sweetheart. All I need is for you to let me take you home. I'll call in a vet - Tony'll probably make sure it's the best one money can get. He's like that, your ma. Future. Maybe."
"Whoa!" That was Cap interrupting before he could, and he sound just a little outraged. "Tony ain't... I'm not a prisoner, JARVIS. Tell Ms. Potts I'm just fine and she doesn't need to worry, will ya?"
"Yes. Yes it is." Cap looked a little panicked, and Tony thought maybe he was blushing again, which was weird. Any concern was misplaced though. Wasn't like Tony was going to kill him, or could even if he wanted to. Which he didn't but only because Cap was kind of smiling and laughing around him more lately.
Kind of under-edited because I couldn't angst over it anymore, so sorry for any typos!
He refused to do the same; he refused to be that person..
He does not know me. I do not know him.
"Gwen Stacey. She's a good kid, mostly. Gets way too much shit from the media, but Pepper says I'm not allowed to lay waste to any more newspapers."
"Okay. So lets--" Winter didn't even let him finish, just rolled his eyes and then pushed the door open and stalked right inside. "Or ya could ignore me and do whatever ya want. That's fine too. Mary Mother-a Christ this is gonna be a mess."
"Why's it a fanny pack?"
"I do not need the Black Widow out for my blood, so I'll let it go. And I promise I won't say anything to Tones either. Just... I don't think you should worry about spooking him. He's not always the best at picking up on social cues either, so I hope your plan--"
"Bet nothing even happened there."
instead of anything resembling legs or arms, malice in its glowing red eyes. The thing wasn't as agile as he was, but it still turned quickly enough in the air and was after him again.
"Hearing you call him 'Lokes' is so weird."
, which was just... fuck. That was world altering information there. "Still. I got no blackmail to give ya. You said you buy Ms. Potts shoes, right?"
Mary Mother of God he hoped that if they could win the coming battle the same would be true for Tony. He had heard the yearning note in his fella's voice when they'd talked about the constellations in their respective worlds. He saw the way Tony would sometimes try to look up at them and ignore everything but their gentle twinkle; the look of peace mingled with wonder on his face during those precious moments was something to behold. He wanted that for Tony all the time, not just in the calm before the inevitable storm his mind brought crashing down on him.
Thanos had... summoned? Transfigured? Pushing down the need to understand, Tony turned so he could fly backwards and keep his eye on the Nightmare Beast. Its tentacles had a much longer reach than he would have expected, coiling before lashing out and forcing him to dance out of their way. Rhodey and Harley both had flown in to engage it alongside him. Harley was the one to flank it and fire first, drawing nothing more than an outraged roar that sent a shiver through the metal of Tony's armor. A simple reactor blast wasn't enough to penetrate the thing's defenses, and Tony was worried that they might have to get creative.
What if he was
mine. Now we are Avengers, so the both of us belong to you. Also to Tony, Thor and Bruce. So he's not mine alone, but he
"Don't you roll your eyes at me. Now. We should have something to present your mom with, complete with safety features and the assurance that Fri will be able to take over and re-route you back here in case of emergencies. First we need to design--"
"Okay. How about this. I'll make you a suit, because I have had dreams about that and I am not passing up the chance to turn that into a reality. We'll... look. There's time before we have to deal with the next crisis with world-ending possibilities. Probably. So for now let's just... agree to disagree. I'll focus on getting the two of you fighting-fit for now, and on helping vet some new Avengers with Rhodey and Viz. I've got to work on the Accords - not for them, but for all of us. It's still the best option on the table for oversight and we need the goodwill fixing them will bring now more than ever. But I won't... I'll stop looking for loopholes and shit, okay? I won't put any more energy into bringing them home until I've got you two squared away and we have a bigger team. Then we'll all talk about it. Roundtable, democratic discussion. Well, the final decision would come down to the leader of the Avengers, but if I know my Rhodey-bear--"
W-well. I don't-- Of course. What has your company been doing for Tony Stark--
"You aren't as big as me period," he teased just to watch Tony's cheeks puff out in irritation. "Not without wearing the armor or putting lifts in your shoes anyway."
“Iron Mom? Pops?” Steve looked between the two of them, then around the room like he would find answers there. “Is there some kinda mind control villain hiding in here or somethin’? I don’t--” Dum-E finally left his sulk to zoom over to Steve’s side, bumping into him gently before tucking his claw against the blond’s neck. “Hey there buddy. What’s wrong? Your… ma hurtin’
"Harley--"
Emotion lodged in his throat, a confusing mix of relief, shame and love that would be almost impossible to untangle. He believed the man – Tiny Adorable Steve had never lied to him. He didn’t lie and he did everything he could to keep every promise he made. So his lover was there to stay and he wouldn’t leave Tony behind like so much broken baggage. He wasn’t like—
"I was. Sorta. Unofficial-like, I mean."
"It's fine. I'm gonna hop in the shower, so tell Clint he can come in and get her whenever so long as he doesn't go stealing any of my underwear again. It wasn't funny then and it won't be funny now. Underwear theft is
Her eyes looked a little wet, he noted with growing alarm. He had known his friends would be upset, but he'd never... It had been easy to forget, with Tony in his arms and his family steadily growing, that they would be worried about him. They'd had no way of knowing if he was alright and he had let himself ignore the small voice that insisted he get in touch. Doing that had let him keep living in domestic bliss, but it had also allowed the issue to fester under the surface. He could have eased Tony into this
Dr. Greene had told him he should say something. She had smiled when he gave his emphatic no and hadn't brought it up again. The doc was infuriatingly good at waiting him out. His actual shrink, the one still paid for by Fury and SHIELD, had called Steve 'well adjusted' on his last report, which was interesting since they still didn't even talk to each other during their sessions.
Steve was head over heels for the guy within a month of staying in Avengers Tower. Not that Tony noticed, because Steve couldn't help but get tense and awkward whenever they were together as Tony and Steve. Captain America and Iron Man did better sometimes, but that just made everything feel even more hopeless. He’d thought maybe Tony wasn't interested in knowing Steve - hell, he still had been refusing to even use his actual name at that point. Everyone else was 'Thor' or 'Clint' or 'Nat' - 'Brucie-bear' was one that left Steve especially angry and hurt.
You were always meant to be mine. This was always meant to be; this fight, this moment. Your lover, your children... all of it has led you here. Even the Sacrifice of JARVIS was destined.
“Yeah.” Warm, dry lips pressed against his temple and made his eyes slip closed again. Even if it messed up some of the wires and made his chest ache a little he still tried to bury himself in Steve’s arms, face tucked against the man’s neck. “’M here. Not leavin’ ya ever again either.”
He wasn't jealous that Steve had gotten along so well with that other Tony, but hearing stories always made him just a little sad. It was like looking in a funhouse mirror and finding the distorted reflection was so much better than reality. He couldn't help but feel like he'd gotten the shaft while that other Tony - Shellhead - had hit the jackpot... and that wasn't fair. Shellhead's life hadn't been perfect by any means from what Steve had told him. They'd both gone through their share of shitty situations, and they both had their triumphs and low points.
STAR didn't answer verbally, but her location did flare brightly on the UI of his suit. She was hovering around Tiny Adorable Steve, of course, doing her part in that smaller battle. He had a bigger, nightmare fish to fry though, so she was going to have to let that go.
(See the end of the chapter for
, the one that was so much better than anything he'd ever had. The one that came to him to tell him things, that worried about him, that
"Of course Steve. Did you have something in particular you wanted to talk about or are are we shooting the shit again?" He didn't even fight the way his lips quirked up at the phrase. She was certainly something, their girl FRIDAY.
Anyway, if you guys have anything you'd especially like to see in that semi-experimental chapter that will skip us forward in time, let me know! Can include events or the type of media you'd like to see. Please note that they will be text-based only, as my Photoshop skills are limited, I can't draw, and I have no idea how to edit videos.
"Hey," he forced himself to say, proud when it came out more word than croak. "Thanks for, ya know. Seein' me'n all. I know it pro'lly wasn't high on your list-a things ta do."
Warmth crept over his neck and ears as happiness made his heart swell. They'd never... they called the boys and Star and FRIDAY their kids, but they hadn't ever really stated it so firmly before. Not out loud anyway. He pressed a kiss to Tony's hairline and tried to hide just how damn pleased he was.
What's the other reason?
at the time of the delivery he would have made a different call," she continued, voice sharp and decisive as a whip crack. "But in my position as his proxy, I consulted with FRIDAY and determined a course of action that was most beneficial to his health and well-being."
"Carol is pretty tough!" Kamala interrupted as she bounded over. Because she lived to annoy Harley, she immediately jumped on him and wrapped her arms around him. "She'll set the rest of the Avengers straight in no time!" The other teen present was trying to peel the limpet off of him, but Kamala was stubborn as a barnacle. "Remember what she did to the Punisher?"
All of their clothing was rough with visible fraying, the weapons not designed by him worn and sometimes ill repaired. Rogers had the shadow of stubble on cheeks gaunter than he remembered and darker shadows still in those blue eyes. As Sam offered the man a hand up, Tony decided that the hero from all of his father's stories seemed... smaller, somehow, than he once had been. Like maybe, just maybe, he wasn't riding this storm out as easily as he might like people to think.
"I can't wait to be older. It probably gets easier then."
"Maybe a little. Hey Butterfingers, Dum-E. You see what your ma got me?" All three 'bots gave cheerful whistles and beeps before Dum-E pressed right up against his side. Butterfingers began to gesture emphatically - it would have taken him a second to catch on, but Tony always knew what the boys were trying to say immediately.
oughta be the one ta tell her."
"Just to draw or maybe watch a movie." He could have done both those things in his own room, and Tony had a feeling Captain America was upset he was going to be left behind. Not like it was his fault - the man out of time had been invited along. It wasn't Tony's problem if he didn't want to come let loose because he had a stick up his ass or whatever his problem was. "Thanks for the invite, but you go ahead Clint. Have a fun time. You too, Tony."
"'Cause he knows it's awful mostly. Likes ta show me terrible films all-a the damn time. Did ya cry?"
"Yeah?"
Eye crinkles should not be so appealing, especially not on the faces of guys who hated him.
"Mebbe. Except I bet if I asked you'd give me some paper and a pencil."
"Then why are you fucking a guy that stole my face?!"
"It's different."
. Neither am I the
"I was at the same briefing as you were, Rogers." Shellhead's tone hadn't been exactly friendly, but everyone ignored that in favor of focusing on the task at hand. "Don't need you hovering either babe. I've got Punisher, be back after the drop." Lokes peeled away reluctantly, returning to his position circling Vision and Wanda where he did his best to keep the prowling forces of Thanos at bay.
"Iron Man? Are you sure?"
"Should you attempt to hurt either of my parents, I will engage lethal countermeasures. I believe I could, as my sister would say, 'take you' Mr. Liesmith."
The thought let Steve curl up to Tony, who was already snoring the way he swore he  always swore he didn't. After one last sigh and squirm, he let himself follow suit and a comforting, restful blackness soon swallowed him.
"I won't ever leave this world unless all of ya are with me, Fri. I'll die ta keep that promise."
have a chance with Tony after all. Maybe they could be more than friends after all, because even if Tony was pretty tactile sometimes, hugs between friends didn't usually last for five minutes. That felt more like a romantic thing, and maybe it wasn't just wishful thinking to acknowledge that. Maybe... maybe someday Tony could love him back.
(See the end of the chapter for
. It would have all come out in the end, and it was better that Tony hadn't had the chance to convince himself that maybe, just maybe, Howard had been wrong. He hadn't had time to believe that he and Captain America could be
Everything around him was a blur - he knew it was happening and he was at least partly aware of it, but... it was so far away. He could still only feel STAR's grip on his ear and the wild beating in his chest, and there was a growing roar in his ears... and where was Tony?
Hng. I've had most of this chapter done for a while but I wanted to add more news or interview sections but couldn't figure out what kind or what to put in them, and so I had to spazz about that for a while.
"What the hell is going on?!" That was Rogers, and he sounded just as bewildered and furious as Steve had thought he would. Why Winter had decided to go through with this he didn't know. He was also kind of ticked at everyone who'd talked the guy into it. Later on he'd have to make that annoyance known. "Who are you?"
"Thought you had it all figured out Rogers?"
. If I gotta."
had really come back to him? Well. The universe could suck it, because he was going to grab on tight and never, ever let go. Being alone was not an option if Steve hadn't made the smart choice to stay the hell away.
"Now. When are you going to get up the guts to ask my boy out?"
to herd him towards the couch. The big comfy one they usually used to watch movies, not one of the smaller ones grouped in front of the gaming consoles. He had a feeling he was about to be surrounded and forced into a pile of cuddles, and it was definitely not the worst thing in the world. Hell, he'd admit to himself and maybe Steve that he actually loved the nights when they all snuggled down with blankets and hot chocolate together to pick apart some poor, innocent movie that had only been doing its best to entertain them. Nothing was safe from their varied tastes, not even things Tony counted as sacred classics... and he fucking loved it.
"I get it, Harls. I don't want my Tiny Adorable Steve to have a meltdown any more than you do, I promise."
"You pulled rank on me." Winter said, neatly sidestepping the topic that was still so full of hurt. "Told me you were a Captain."
"What..." He would never acknowledge the way Tony had to stop and clear his throat, too choked up to keep talking. "What names were you thinking of?"
If Tony was ready to cuddle the fuck out of him, Steve was fully prepared to plan the shit out of their future.
"So nothing. You're like, my father figure and sh... stuff. I'll take care of you if I wanna."
"How 'bout ya show me my suit? Then... 'workshop sex' before I take ya upstairs'n cook ya a fancy dinner. I'll romance ya, then spend hours takin' ya apart. Does that work?"
's face was even more beautiful than the vengeance had been.
"Why don't you go ahead and ask Clint ta come get her. Never gonna get her to settle now that she heard he might take her out."
It took Steve a while to figure out that there was still something wrong. When it finally hit him, he'd gone to the gym in the tower and worked his way through three of Tony's 'indestructible' punching bags.
"Love you too."
“It was a team effort, really.”
Soul cuts the deepest Steven. But your lover has been feeling echoes of it his whole life. He will bear it just fine.
? Oh come on - you aren't even trying to hide it. Loki is evil and we all know it. He tried to take over the world and he mind-controlled Clint. I can get him down here if you want, Tony, to remind you--"
a date, no matter how his swooping stomach and stupid heart wanted to interpret J's words.
Jesus fuck did the endearment hurt.
Food trucks were probably one of his favorite things about the future, for example. One jogging route in particular - the one he called the 'Tony won't talk to me today' route in his head - let him stop at six different trucks in under an hour to try an eat away his pain. He loved catching sight of same sex couples holding hands as they walked the streets, loved the way they didn't need to be so afraid anymore. There were so many different kinds of people that lived together, and he knew that he was experiencing things from a very particular and limited point of view, but... well. For every instance of hate and cruelty he saw, he could also find a handful of examples of genuine compassion and kindness.
Pepper sighed and reached out for the blueprints hovering in the air. She pulled them close, interacting with his holograms in a way she rarely did. He watched with a mixture of excitement and dread, because if his Pepper-pot told him that he'd gone too far he knew she was telling the truth. She knew that line a hell of a lot better than he did, and whenever he did more than toe it she wasn't afraid to tell him to knock it off. For long, long minutes that felt like forever, she didn't say anything and the silence was only broken by her thoughtful hums.
"We really need to depart, Anthony," The note of adoration in his voice would be sweet if he wasn't a space god who had wreaked havoc on Earth - twice if you counted that whole Destroyer in Arizona or wherever. "Your... GPS," here Loki sounded deeply annoyed while Shellhead smirked unabashedly. "Might work, but there are limits. You're at risk of missing an important appointment."
Comfortable silence fell, interrupted briefly when Steve wandered out in actual clothes, the loser. He caught his dorky
"... fuck it. Fri-baby? Give the kid the same kind of access Harley has, okay? Just... just warn me when he gets here the first time so I can prepare myself to face him. I don't want him to think I hate him, and you're right Steve. I should be man enough to clean up my own messes."
"Excuse you? You are the special-ist, and not in a bad way or in a professional way because it kind of sounds like I'm calling you
"Yeah, yeah. And Tony'n Shellehead too. Anybody else risks losin' an arm though." Making either Tony call him 'Winter' had seemed cruel... and Peggy had suggested he not force the issue with them if he wanted to seem friendly. Winter had, of course, taken that suggestion. Clint was the only one of the Defenders who still tried to use James, and that only when he was perched high enough to avoid immediate retaliation, the little shit.
Life had other ideas though, because suddenly Tony's expression went pinched and unhappy. Another problem had sprung up and he resisted the urge to sigh. He was
"But really, ya don't need ta--"
"Since I get to hold you a lot sooner than I expected I'm okay with that." Tony briefly hid in his shoulder, which he suspected was done to hide a blush. He squeezed the man a bit tighter and ran his free hand down his back. Tony retaliated by squeezing his butt again - probably done to make him start blushing - then tipped his head back to look up at him.
"I will do that Sir, on behalf of both of you. Also, I feel it might be prudent to remind you about the gift--"
"Really. Got sketchbooks full of pictures of you too, 'cause you're so damn beautiful it hurts sometimes. Why the hell do you think Clint started calling us mom and dad? Or why they all try to get you to agree with them on what we eat or watch? They all know how I feel about you and that... how's that saying go? With you goes my nation?"
a voice. Their own personal Siri. He died to save the world and they never even--"
"He's coming with us. I'm not taking him from you." Winter broke off into clipped Russian, and Steve snorted.
Hey all! :D
Really.
. "I'm sorry, FRIDAY. I never should have done it and I won't ever do it again. And if it helps put your mind at ease, anythin' we talk about ya can tell Tony. No secrets this time, alright?"
"Bucky Barnes died in the snow over seventy years ago." Winter's voice was even, but his shoulders had begun to tense. His eyes had gone that pale, almost luminescent gray that signaled 'danger', and Steve was pretty sure his right hand was drifting towards the gun he'd brought. Winter really,
, when he had thought Rogers had been hassling him out of genuine concern and caring.
"Lies."
The Avengers had always been at their most destructive when they were trying to help.
"Done. Harley?"
"What I want is them gone."
. Later he'd get the story on why the Wakandans had given it back, but for right now... well. The two Tonys were arm in arm as they walked out, discussing the proper red to gold ratio and what design to slap on his shield instead of the star.
"No problem. Good luck." As soon as Steve had hold of the bag, the teen was gone - he thought maybe his helper was actually scared of them, which made his willingness to run the errand even nicer. The bag with the brush and shampoo he set off to one side and hoped he would need later. The other bag had two different kinds of treats in it, and he studied them before choosing the jerky.
"I'm in! Oh my gosh, I'm gonna download sooooo many memes on my phone to show you boys. Ooh! Or maybe Tony could figure out how to connect it to the network here?"
Despite that and the more modern sensibilities, Steve could also see touches that made him certain the design had been based off the motorcycle he'd driven back in the war. It was familiar without being threatening because of it, because of course Tony would understand how to straddle that line for him.
"Bring it old man!"
"That sounds real nice Tony."
And really, even if they weren't talking because of Tony's crushing self doubt... he thought that maybe this was another one of his fella's kids. He really ought to be brought into the fold if only so Steve could stop him from looking like skin and bones the way he did.
"Die mad about it," she returned lazily, coming close enough that she could skim affectionately over both their cheeks before going to land on Pep's shoulder. His CEO gave her an undeniably fond smile, then turned her attention back to the three interlopers. Tony took that as his cue to do the same, keeping his arms looped around Steve's waist. His
"Steve? Maybe
"You think?"
"Except me."
. He could jump and flail to metal or hard rock with the best of them, but popular music got his hips interested like nobody's business.
with him. Sure it was sweet and all, but it had just been another reminder that he was on the verge of falling apart. He really, really wanted to be able to have sex with Steve when both of them were completely healthy. They'd never had that, and he was pretty damn sure it was going to be fantastic.
"Everyone?" Peter sounded doubtful, and suddenly he knew what their da and pops meant when they said that sometimes he and Peter sounded so
"Have any of you stopped to think that maybe - just maybe - I can take care of my fucking self?"
"So much shit."
would be coming to stay at least once a month or so. Tony was thinking of clearing out enough space to add a small second house for those who ended up visiting for longer than a few days.
Harley was the more mature one of the pair of them, because he only rolled his eyes and ignored the playful dig. He pulled out his tablet and gave the surface a few taps. Interestingly, his cheeks got a little pink as he did. The kid looked torn between embarrassment and hope when he handed the thing over, eyes trained carefully on Tony's face.
"Oh."
"You don't have what it takes, you or that... little robot thing. Now get out of my way."
"As the billionaire I feel like I should be the one getting the ring." Steve only chuckled while stepping into his space, and fuck did it feel good to have that lean, tightly muscled body pressed against his.
And if after all that and their parting Steve still had that stupid dirty rag, that was his business. Nobody but JARVIS needed to know that he folded it up and tucked it into his nightstand, and that was only because he trusted the AI to keep quiet about it. Even if it had only been a joke, Tony had given Steve his favor and let him play the white knight.
“So does
The process of creating Ultron was interrupted by the Mind Stone, Mr. Poppleton, as I'm sure you were made aware while being briefed for this- this farce.
It was impossible though, and Steve gave up the effort before long. Before they all had moved into the tower even, back when Tony had been hanging out at SHIELD. Watching the billionaire try not to belly ache about the facilities and the tech had been hilarious. He also spent most of their 'movie days' watching Tony instead of the screen. Training with Iron Man was as amazing as it was frustrating. His mind took turns Steve could never hope to predict, which was fine except for the way Tony usually forgot to tell the rest of them the  new plan. When the two of them were in sync with each other, it was dazzling, one of the most exhilarating things Steve had experienced. When they
They were
"Okay, so ya made a mistake," he allowed. Buttering Tony up and painting too rosy a picture wouldn't work, after all. It'd just make him dig his heels in all the harder. "But I also know ya never woulda taken him ta Berlin if you'd known that Rogers'n them would be fightin' like it was for keeps. So now ya know better and ya can move forward -
Steve didn't bother to even pretend to be listening to the conversation going on as he wandered over to the fridge. He was thirsty, and the chance of nobody speaking to him was too high. If it happened he'd just get upset and have to go take it out on some poor canvas that didn't deserve to be treated so bad. The shrink who was sneaking around Fury to speak with him regularly would be proud of how self-aware he was becoming, even if she'd probably say his coping skills weren't exactly aces.
taking a real vacation after he hit twenty five or so. Even most of the shenanigans he had described happened as part of work trips. "Fuck. Okay. So. Vacation."
"No! No no no. I don't want to hear this. I don't need to hear this and I don't want to. Neither of you has so much as kissed a girl. Or boy. Person of non-binary or indeterminate gender?" He'd never pressed either of them about their sexuality and wasn't willing to really hazard a guess either way. They knew he'd be fine with whatever way they chose to define themselves, and he had absolutely no interest in knowing the finer details of their love lives. That's what Steve was for.
