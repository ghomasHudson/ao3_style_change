He nodded rapidly, but before she could demand a verbal confirmation, the doors to the workshop swished open again.
There will be more incoming in this 'verse (next up is a prompted fic for FrozenFlame) so stay tuned if you'd like to see more of them!
“Don’t blame you,” Tony shrugged, carelessly continuing his conversation with Steve despite the man’s repeated attempts to interject. “He doesn’t sound like he’s the sharpest tool in the box.”
The second was that there was a low, dangerous growl floating over the air, that Tony would bet his company was coming from Steve. It had probably been hard enough for his boyfriend to see him coming in with a bruised cheekbone, split lip and the kind of ruffled clothes that intimated a struggle had taken place beforehand, but watching those goons whale on him now? Steve was probably so pissed.
“Too right she does,” Bucky laughed a little, shaking his head as he turned and finished the last of his drink. “Speaking of whom, I wonder why Toni’s skipping out on tonight. She loves a good celebration.” With a look in his eye that Steve couldn’t discern and a far too smug smile, Barnes took a step towards the exit. “I think I’m gonna head to her room, check up on her. Maybe try to convince her to do some celebratin’ of our own, if ya know what I mean.”
Some – closer to most – in his team would probably have been surprised to find that the Thunder God did, in fact, possess some level of volume control. Granted, it was a skill that he’d been made to learn after their esteemed leaders had adopted their son, and it was still something that he had to consciously practice, but he was doing much better with it. He took special care, especially in times like this, not taking lightly to his sworn duty to watch over the little one. The boy had much to be protected from, although Thor was regretful that such a harsh battle as this one had to be fought by one as young as Peter. He had been much older, himself, the first time he’d ever had cause to fear the loss of one of his beloved parents, and though Peter hadn’t been made explicitly aware of the direness of the situation, the Norse God could tell that there was some level of understanding present.
“Clint, stand down!” Toni hissed furiously, shifting Peter away from the scene and ignoring the child’s confused attempts to turn around and see what was happening. In his frozen position, Steve also spared a moment to be impressed by how quickly Toni had managed to turn Pete away, so that the kid wouldn’t have to see this.
Steve knew it was wrong, but he had to try to convince Tony that there was something more; something real between them that just wasn’t with stupid, Tony-ignorant Coleman.
She was not Mother Material, that was a well-documented fact, and despite how many times Steve tried to point out that her actions spoke otherwise, that was an argument she wasn’t prepared to indulge him with.
, a voice in his head sympathetically murmured, sounding vaguely like the love of his life. Like Toni.
Kevin-the-paramedic shot her a look of utter disbelief. “You have a moderate concussion, three cracked ribs, a miniature Grand Canyon ripped into your left bicep, and contusions and bruising to at least 70 percent of your body, and your first priority is getting on a plane?”
He stilled, registering several things at once. One, was that the blade was attached to a staff – sort of like a scepter or scythe – and that it was pressed against his neck hard enough to pierce the very top surface of his skin. Two, was that if he moved an inch in any direction, he was going to be sliced and diced, if not decapitated to some degree. Three, was that the guy holding it (who looked closer to a boy than a man) was probably responsible for the blue things terrorizing the city, most of which had been annihilated by his team already. Then four; and this one was the most horrifying one; was that Tony had his back after all, speaking terms notwithstanding. Because he was lowering to the ground in front of Steve, palms up in a universal sign of surrender.
Somewhere along the line – more than likely, the part of her story where Steve had entered, where the Avengers and Peter had entered – she had found a family that had accepted her, quirks and all. Loved her, even. They’d given her more than her father ever could.
Dragging in a breath that was just a little thinner than the ones before; hardly noticeable unless one had only partial function of their lungs; Toni closed her eyes and let her head fall back against the wall of rubble behind her. She had no intention of passing out – that head wound was not something she was willing to take a chance with – but her increasing difficulty with keeping memories of the cave in Afghanistan at bay, was hindering her ability to take slow, even breaths, which really just created an endless cycle of pain for the genius. Not to even mention that it would be in bad form to tell the kid not to panic when he woke up, while she was expressly panicking.
“Can’t we just let them have him?” she asked half-hopefully, and though the agent sent her a bland look, she had known him long enough by then to see through to the amusement behind it.
“Steve,” she rasped, saying his name like a supplication when finally, they’d managed to get her hooked up to his harness. Steve cradled his lover against his body, as if that would keep her from any more pain as they made the equally arduous ascent. “You got me,” she nodded, as if to confirm it, and slumped into his chest. “M’so tired.”
Bucky nodded; was already reclining back against his pillows. “Hey, since you’re not into him, mind if I make a move?” he asked casually, and the flare of heat and temper in Steve’s gut was both unexpected and irrational. “Tony’s great,” the brunet continued, seemingly totally unaware of the ugly feeling bubbling in Steve’s chest. “Smart, kind, funny… not to mention he’s fuckin’ gorgeous.”
Steve continued: “It took ages for me to show even a hint of a Dominant's notch, and we figured my voice was breaking because I’d been so sick on and off that spring. We only found out I’d presented ‘cause mom sent in a round of tests to be sure I was really over the sweats and could go back to school; they saw the spiked Domosterone in the results and let her know.”
“You do too, Pep,” Tony mumbled.  “Deserve the world. And babies!  And all good things. Everything you want.”
“And, I doubt anybody’d ever call you ‘helpless,’” Rogers ventured, then added with a cautious smile, “Or ‘
Chapter dedicated to thatwhichyeilds and all the kind and generous readers who have helped keep me motivated.  You are wonderful!
Pepper let the silence linger.  Tony fidgeted, free to squirm and toy with his cuffs since it wasn’t a video call.
Steve jolted then went still.  Tony hadn’t hit him hard—it hadn’t really even hurt, just made a loud noise and startled him, but it had been thrilling and surprising and  . . . hm.  (Maybe spanking needed to go on the ‘like’ list after all….)
Steve obeyed.  Tony moaned and pulled at his hair a little harder.  It was rushed and frantic, urgent and heady.  Steve let himself be swept up in it.  (Tony’s in control. . . I’m yours . . . take me . . .)
Steve glanced over at Tony, then looked away, shoulders hunched.  "Uh, sorry, for talking your ear off like that."
Thanksgiving Part II: still no turkey, but talking and bonding and more fluff than anybody asked for...
“I can’t believe you found one,” Steve said, shaking his head and looking at the sleek machine. “I figured a bike like this would be . . . obsolete now. Scrap.”
“Mostly training with Natasha. We’re working on a few collaborative moves with the shield, launches and things.  And I should really do that reading Fury sent over yesterday.”  Steve sighed and reached up to caress Tony’s neck as he added, “And there’s a sketch I’d like to start and, um, that painting I mentioned earlier.”  He paused then gave Tony a shy little smile, “And, well, I was hoping I could take you on a date tonight.  If you have time, I mean.”
“You know what I mean,” Tony said, waving his hands as walked down the corridor. “Why aren’t you giving me combat training anymore?”
A/N:  Oh, wow.  Such a relief to post this!  I rewrote it, uh, quite a few times, really struggling with tone and form.  (I wanted to replicate Tony’s vacillations between past and present formally, but not in a way that would actually confuse readers…)  And the subject matter at the Pierre was really hard for me to balance.  So, thank you very much for your patience!
Steve looked happy but just one notch shy of exhausted. There was a smudge of blue marker on his chin.
Everyone’s attention whipped over to Rogers. It was pretty much the first thing he’d said the entire time.
“You’re frowning,” Steve said, then gestured at his plate. “And your food’s getting cold. Is everything okay?”
Steve hastened to obey.  He scrambled onto the bed, then knelt, legs spread wide, head bowed.   Over his shoulder, Tony was doing something with the tray or box or whatever—Steve still hadn’t gotten a look at it and wasn’t sure he wanted to.  It was cold without Tony touching him.  He shivered a little.  What was Tony planning?
“Definitely American history. I've done a bunch of reading on my own, but it would be good to actually study it formally. Maybe art and literature too? I've always liked poetry, well, some of it.” Steve hesitated a moment. “And, it might be nice to do some basic stuff with science and computers-- not that I expect I'll have much of a nack for it, and, I know that we've got that stuff well covered on the team. I just thought it would be nice to understand it a little better.”
Rhodey let out a little chuckle. “This wasn’t exactly planned. I never seem to manage that.” Rhodey shrugged. “Anyway, it’s good to see you again, Steve, and, hey-- I heard the big news.” He held out his hand with a grin. (Do you mean--?) “Tony’s a lucky man.” (Yes!)
Tony unwound little by little, giving a certain lazy attention to the TV. Together Uhura and Spock were inventing a new interference-canceling communications device. Tony’d forgotten what a good episode it was—he always liked it when Spock and Uhura worked together.
His phone rang. Tony was about to toss it across the workshop when he saw the caller. A little break would be good for him, but he hit ‘answer’ a little harder than necessary all the same.
“Hey, man?” Tony said hesitantly, scooting closer so they were touching. “We’re gonna skip the part with Shelob, right?”
“The steps of the arbitration process are in Section 42, subheading 8,” she said. “Assuming your own committees couldn’t resolve the issue, the matter would be referred to court-appointed negotiator.”
Bruce didn’t tell the others what else Tony’d gotten him, and Tony was just as glad. He wouldn’t even have told Bruce, except that after the quake Bruce had been so worried about the village where he’d lived in Nepal; Tony wanted him to know they were okay—well, as okay as money could make them—and everything was being rebuilt in his villiage.
By ten a.m., Tony had signed a bunch of paperwork, corrected nine errors in the latest phone specs from R&D, and read over four of Pepper’s reports only to agree wholeheartedly with her projected course of action.  As he worked through it all, Tony’s eyes kept drifting over to the end of his table where two-thirds of a BLT sat waiting for him to regain his appetite.  (Turned out “tea sandwich” meant “BLT.”  At least in this case.)
“Those were tricorder noises, weren’t they?” Steve asked as Tony led him to the edge of the ballroom.
“No. Dummy, what are you doing there?” (Oh. Right. Coffee.) “Well, make yourself useful. Find the--” Tony's vision swam. (Huh.) “-- the . . . the--”
The long version: blather on my blog: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/155929617441/the-state-of-the-meredith
And, every now and then, if Tony was a little distracted and took out his tablet to deal with a few little things before getting back to work . . . well, Bruce certainly didn’t complain.
“Bucky lost his mom when she was bringing him into the world,” Steve began, “and his father, well, I never knew the man, but he had a reputation in Brooklyn. He was a boxer, won some big prize fights, but had trouble with betting and drinking so he lost money faster than he won it. He wasn’t very happy with his life and he’d take it out on people—“ Steve hesitated, and his voice went low, “sometimes Bucky, I think, though he never said so. Eventually, when Buck was ten his dad was killed in a bar fight—knifed in the side—so Buck went to Magdalene House, the orphanage next to the hospital where my mom worked. It was attached to St. Mary’s where we went to Mass and where the school was.”
“Well, I’ve been up and working for hours,” Tony said with a grin. “And good news! I solved the problem with the Security Blanket!”
Steve pressed a soft, fleeting kiss to Tony’s lips—then his cheek, his throat. Steve caressed Tony’s forehead, cheekbone, jaw, ran his fingers lightly along Tony’s neck and shoulders.
Steve smiled a bit wider (a more familiar smile) and interrupted, “I’m sure it will be lovely, Tony.”  Steve bumped his shoulder against Tony’s, then quickly stepped away again.
“There in three, two, one,” Tony said, and gave Clint a lift, scooping him away from onrushing spiders. Tony flipped the faceplate up. “I—I’m sorry.”
A sharp jolt of pleasure shot through Steve’s body-- he arched off the bed, pulling against the restraints which held him in place.  The headboard creaked and Steve pressed his wrists back into place.  (Be good!  Stay there!)
“See all those patterns that look like Celtic knotwork or abstract arabesques?  That’s actually really intricate calligraphy, usually verses from the Koran.  Uh, you probably already knew that though.”  Steve peered across the restaurant at a beautiful panel.  “That one looks like a
“Oh my God,” Bruce breathed, “Is it— Did the electromagnetic radiation just—I mean, the force carrier should be able to—”
As Tony shuffled into the shared kitchen, he was surprised to see Steve wearing his full Captain America gear, bent over the dinning room table. It was covered with files, papers, a tablet, and his laptop. Tony blinked. Steve was scowling down at something, left hand clenching a steaming mug.
It felt too terribly pathetic to ask “Is Steve back yet?”; if he was but hadn’t come to find Tony, he didn’t really want to know.
Steve’s mind still felt fogged with lust even as his body went loose and relaxed.  Tony was still on his knees, his cheek now pressed to Steve’s thigh, panting damply against his skin.  (Fuck.)  It was all over so quickly.  Steve covered his face with his arm.
Steve continued, and now he sounded frustrated, a hint angry again:  “I used to get beat up all the time and pinned down a lot.  It seemed like some sick part of my brain was saying that, since I’d never be able to resist I should just give up and
Tony was congratulating Joseph and Janine Jabobs on their daughter’s admission to Harvard—Another Harvard student in the family! Oh boy! What a surprise!—when Clint caught his eye and gestured to his watch. And, look, he’d already collected Bruce!
The room was silent, but for the sound of Bruce’s deep breaths.  In . . . hold. Out. In . . . hold. Out.
After a few (blessedly few) minutes, Steve looked around the table.  “Is there anything else you’d like to add?”
The next day, when Steve came into the communal kitchen, he found Clint and Natasha drinking coffee together and speaking softly.  He nearly retreated, since it looked like a private moment, but he was never going to get to know his team properly if he didn’t try, so he took a deep breath and said, “Good morning.”
“Oh, uh,” Steve said with a frown. “I’m not very good at this, but I was gonna wear a suit. But not the fancy one. Definitely not a tuxedo.”
Tony blinked.  Rogers clearly didn’t get the reference or what Tony meant by it.  Shit.  Rogers lived with
“No, don’t think so.  I’m really in the zone, you know?”  Tony bit his lip.  “But, uh, tell Cap thanks, would you?”  Bruce nodded, but Tony added, “No, seriously, make sure you do.  Big guy gets sensitive about the whole food and cooking and eating thing.”
Tony hopped into the elevator, not waiting to see if Rogers wanted a ride to his floor. Tony leaned against the wall, that uneasy feeling lingering under his skin.
And yikes.  As Tony looked around the ballroom it was a regular Who’s Who of Dominants he’d dated or fucked.
“When he saw there were spiders in the area, he and Javier started making runs to get people off the street. They got an extra forty-five civilians to safety, but—Jerry stayed to guard the door. He-- He didn’t make it.”
the Pierre had been unpleasant—he’d enjoyed it in the moment.  (Whole thing had been his idea, after all.) No, it was the aftermath that hurt, when—
His tablet was on the coffee table. Maybe, if he moved very veeery slowly, he could grab it without waking Steve?
Pep pressed a finger to the bluetooth Tony now noticed in her ear and said, “Yes, stand down and call off the dogs, Happy. No security team required. It’s just Tony being a complete and utter idiot.” A pause. “Yes, I’ll tell him you said so. Talk to you tomorrow.” She shook her head at Tony. “Happy says it would serve you right if I’d shot you.”
Tony couldn’t blame the guy—he was still adjusting to the future. (He had trouble keeping Nixon and Clinton straight, for Christ sake!) Rogers didn’t have the context for the magazines or talk shows; it would just be a bunch of names to him and she wasn’t exactly explaining, except to say they’d all eat him up. And, it had to be weird to hear himself described like that, turned into nuggets of grade-A PR gold.
“Yeah,” Steve growled. “You’re gorgeous, so gorgeous like that . . . Give yourself to me . . .  let go, baby . . .”
When Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s jutting hipbone, his breath warmed Tony’s groin and Tony wondered with a jolt if Steve might actually suck him.  Then again, his half-limp dick didn’t look that appealing (not even to him) and it wasn’t exactly the sort of thing that male Doms tended to like.  They usually thought it was too “subby” to suck cock—and, well, apart from that it was hardly something a beginner like Steve would gravitate towards first, right?  So, Tony wasn’t surprised or disappointed when Steve left a lingering kiss on his stomach and got to his feet, kissing a trail from Tony’s hip back to his neck.
They walked to the restaurant in silence, while scattered hipsters, businessmen, and the occasional fashionista swept past without signs of recognizing them.  (Thank God!)  Steve kept glancing over at Tony with a pensive expression Tony couldn’t quite read.  They walked, a solid foot between them and, after a few steps, Steve thrust his hands deep in his pockets.
Rogers said it with a little shrug, and Tony let out a startled laugh. Rogers gave him a sheepish smile.
Steve nodded, cheek pressed against Tony’s palm, but then Tony was leaning back, taking his hand away.  It left Steve momentarily unbalanced.  He looked up at Tony who was giving him this open, expectant look.
Tony didn’t make him wait any longer.  Steve’s body yielded readily for Tony’s slim finger and, unthinking, Steve bucked up into it, wanting more, harder, faster.  Steve licked his lips.
“Director!” Dominic exclaimed, visibly surprised as Nick Fury entered the room, “I didn’t think you were scheduled for this meeting.”
He stared Steve down.  It took him a moment to realize the Lieutenant Colonel was waiting for a response.
“Sir, Mr. Stark raises a very reasonable objection,” Rogers said, cutting off whatever Fury had been about to say.  Tony turned to look at him in surprise.
“But I wasn’t just small—I had health problems. Sometimes they made it hard to hold a job. I couldn’t have provided for a spouse, let alone children, so I figured it was just as well I always fancied fellas more than ladies.”
“I can see why,” Steve said.  “Though, I’m not sure I could have been as forgiving as the Horta.  And it seems like the miners get a way better deal in the end.”
Tony was struggling to push his unhappy, jumbled thoughts away.  (So, what?  I should be with Bruce because I can’t actually relate to anyone who isn’t a science genius?  Is that it?  Well, you’re not wrong I guess . . . I suck at normal people.  But I pretty much suck at people full stop really.)  Tony spun his brass rat on his finger; MIT should pay him royalties for wearing the damn thing all the time—free marketing, woo-hoo.  (So, Steve’s Captain America.  So what?  Yeah, he’s basically everyone’s ideal and too good for me.  You were too.)    Pepper was fingering her bracelet absently; it wasn’t one Tony had given her.  She raised her eyebrows and waited.    (Steve, he’s so young, so inexperienced—shit, you can guess that just looking at his earnest expression, blushing face, and he’s from the ‘40s, so really-- but I’m trying to do things right.  I am.  So, what, you think I’ll fuck him up?  But Bruce could take care of himself?)
A few more harsh pulls to his hair, a sharp thrust—Tony froze, gasped, then flooded Steve’s mouth with cum. Steve swallowed as much as he could, as Tony continued to give stuttering little thrusts through his orgasm.  When Tony pulled out, a little cum and spit trickled from the corner of Steve’s mouth and down his chin.  Steve panted, trying to catch his breath.  He squirmed—his hands were tied tight.  He couldn’t wipe his chin.  (Oh God, I’ve got Tony’s cum on me . . . I can't move. . .
feeling sort of jittery. His usual workout routine had taken a backseat lately, what with the Avengers and the holidays, so maybe Bruce had the right idea. (Not yoga. Nope! But a workout . . .)
Tony chuckled nervously and rubbed the back of his neck.  He glanced up.  “Uh, yeah.  Steve Rogers, ya know—First Avenger? Big, blond, blue-eyed?”
His eyes were stinging. It felt good to be held, to let Pepper take care of him, even a little, but he’d been coiled so tight the thought of really letting go—
“Oh, okay. Great!” Holding Tony’s hand loosely in his, Steve led Tony over to the couch. “So, I thought maybe you’d like to—“ he gestured.
Part 2 of the Surrender Series is now complete!  (phew!)  If you’d like to know more about the Surrender series, please drop by my livejournal.  (Same username: the_kinky_pet.)  I have notes for three more stories to come and ideas for various vignettes in which I promise you: more feelings, more sex, more talking about feelings, more talking about sex, more Pepper, the Avengers, the Avengers Assembling, some hurt and some comfort.
“Just think about it, Tony,” Bruce said with a little half-smile.  He hesitated, then added, “But this is hard enough without . . .”  He frowned and straightened.  “I’d really like your support. I’ve tried dealing with everything alone, and it’s . . . not so good. So, I just. . . I want to try.  Okay? ”
When he finally pulled away, Tony was panting heavily.  He ran his hand up and down Steve’s neck, alternating firm and light caresses.
“Here, see?  So, you can write in notes and then I can respond in the file—I shared it between our accounts.  So you can ask whatever you want right here, or add clarification or whatnot.”
“Ok.  Well, when he wakes up, let me know,” Tony said, then amended it--not eager to talk to Bruce.  “Or, well, when he gets up.”
Something about Bruce’s smile was . . . off. Tony hopped up and followed him. When he didn’t know anybody was looking, Bruce looked sad.
She climbed one step, then another, moving sinuously. Tony thought maybe she’d trained as a dancer. Or was he making that up?
As always, thank you for joining me on Steve and Tony's adventures!  It's a privilege sharing this with you.
For somebody with such long legs, she sure walked slowly. Tony paid careful attention to their route so he wouldn’t have to ask directions again—he hated that shit. No seriously: even MIT labeled doors and hallways.
“Fine,” she pulled away with a little more force than necessary, then gave him a little smile. “I'm fine.”
“Advice from The Matriarch Rhodes?” Tony asked, peering at the notes. Steve nodded. Tony smiled. “She’s the best.”
Then again, maybe Rogers just wanted something familiar.  That would make sense.  The guy was a stranger in a strange fucking land, after all.
Tony pulled off his cock, murmuring wordless little noises and caressing his hips as he pushed his fingers in and out of Steve’s body again and again.  There was a loud noise filling the room and Steve realized with a strange distance that it was his own voice moaning and crying out, as Tony went on and on, leaning down to lick at his cock until he was at the brink, then and pulling back.  Steve bit his lip and tried to quiet himself, but it felt like he was floating in some strange place where everything was desperate and urgent but calm at the same time.  On and on . . . in and out . . . Steve threw his head from side to side, swept up in the waves of sensation, whimpering, gasping, moaning.  A single tear escaped from Steve’s eye and slid down his cheek.
“America isn’t building the railroads anymore,” Sylvia said. “We’re more than a steel and manufacturing firm.” She turned to include Tony. “In fact, we’re working on a new transparent aluminum carbon polymer. For electronics. I thought you might be interested.”
“Mmmm. Yeah, water,” Pepper chimed in. “Tony, needs more water. To not. Not. Hangover.” Pepper burped and giggled.
Steve turned his attention back to his sandwich, feeling like he’d said more than he meant to already, not wanting to continue, embarrassed to confess what he'd been considering.  Especially to Bruce-- he was like Tony, probably had five PhDs. . .   (I’ve been thinking about University . . . If I’d made it home back
Steve swallowed thickly and something on his face must have given him away because Rhodes added, “I don’t know what the hell you’ve done, Cap, but Tony’s my best friend.  And I would do anything for that idiot.”
Part of Tony wanted urgently to shake him awake, demand that they fix this immediately, but another part of him was desperately grateful for the reprieve, for time to think.  He clutched Steve to his chest a little tighter.
Tony blinked and stared for a moment before answering: “I can’t decide if you’re hopelessly naive or just stupid.”  Hurt flashed across Rogers face.
Natasha nodded and took a place in the armchair near Bruce, who was fiddling with the remotes and talking to Clint. Rhodey grabbed a beer and sat next to Bruce. Tony bent down to look under the counter for more of that Belgian ale Pepper’d brought him; he’d better put them in the fridge now if he wanted to have one later while--
. . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Pepper took another deep breath and began. She seemed to trying for (but failing to recreate) the matter-of-fact tone she used for SI reports: “You’ve been in a coma for ten days, causes mostly unknown.” Tony stared. (
“If you accept the position, Mr. Rogers,” she said, leaning forward, her expression intense, “you would be the canvas for his art.”
“We appreciate being informed,” he said with a nod to Tony and Steve. Then he addressed the team, “I believe you have about an hour for lunch before your next meeting.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Something about it felt off.  Steve was still tense.  Tony wanted to press, but didn’t want to add any stress.  (Maybe he could ask Natasha?)
“Did you mean it, Tony?” he repeated.  It looked like Steve was bracing for a blow. “Is that really what you think of me? Still?”
Something scratchy hit Tony square in the forehead. (Huh?) It happened again. He struggled to drag his eyes open. (Shit. Fucking meds… too slow. Fuck!) Tony flailed upright and blinked as another paper ball whapped his forehead.
Tony moaned, then bit his lip.  He took a calming breath.  (Go on.  Take control.  He wants you to.)
Tony sank gracefully to his knees at Steve’s feet.  Steve rummaged around in the duffle bag he’d brought and produced a long thick line of meticulously wound rope.
Tony took a deep breath.  “If you’re tied up, and I hear you say ‘stop’ I’m going to be grabbing the surgical scissors to get you lose as fast as I can and it’s gonna give me a jolt, like a bad ‘oh shit I distressed Steve’ jolt, but what if you were starting to say ‘stop teasing.’  Having a safeword, I don’t know—it’s like the big red reset button and if I know that you can hit it whenever you want I won’t worry about you as much.”  (Ah, shit.  I’m explaining this badly.)  “It means you don’t have to try and explain what’s wrong—it’s just one word, so even if you can’t put everything into sentences, I’ll know.  Everything stops.  It’s like a panic button.”
Even without a safeword, wouldn’t it be clear to Tony if he was unhappy?  And, if Tony was enjoying it would he really want to stop?  He wanted to please Tony.  Oh fuck.  He wanted to please Tony so badly, wanted to drive him wild with lust and be caught up in the storm of it.  If Tony was happy that would make him happy.  Right?
Steve thrust once, twice, thrice, then arched and went still. Tony felt the hot rush of come inside him, filthy and glorious and
Reassurances offered, Tony tried to rekindle the mood, lowering his voice again, “Wouldn’t you like that? Like to work up a sweat and wrestle me down? Panting and pinned, helpless beneath you?”
“Hey, babe,” Tony said sauntering into the living room with a StarkTab under his arm.  Steve looked up from the newspaper.  (Printed on actual paper and smelling like newsprint.  He loved it…) Tony gave him a devilish grin.  (That bodes ill.  Or, very well…)  “I’ve got something for you,” Tony said.  “Got a minute?”
“The Bite’s perfect.”  Natasha said it softly, seriously, and took a step closer.  Tony fell silent.  He picked up his screwdriver back up; he’d put it down when he saw her reflection on You’s shiny surface.
.  If we weren’t famous, I wouldn’t-- )  Steve couldn’t even finish the thought, couldn’t lie to himself, especially not
“Looks . . . interesting.”  Steve glanced over at Tony’s copy of their spreadsheet.  “This what you’ve been working on?”
“Yeah.  Not what SHIELD’s been using it for, I know, but I was thinking about the retiarius—you know, the Roman gladiator?—and it seemed like it might adapt well.”
“I hate to be the responsible adult among us,” Bruce cut in dryly, the implication that he always was, sitting heavily in his tone as Steve and Bucky exchanged grins, “but shouldn’t we at least pretend to be strategizing? Just for the sake of our reputation?”
boots, I would worry more about not getting everyone else’s up my ass whenever it comes time to spar. Good to see that shiner I gave you faded okay.”
me, Rogers.” Her voice cracked like a whip, but it was the impersonal use of his surname, something she hadn’t done since before they’d become friends, that cut him the deepest. “You don’t get to yell at me, treat me like I’m some kind of stupid, spoilt, rich girl, and then try to explain yourself for it. Get the fuck out of my tent.”
“Who did that to you?” Steve growled without thinking, and even he didn’t recognize his voice in that moment. He wasn’t sure that he’d ever felt such bone-melting fury in his life before. Not entirely sure how it happened, and not really caring either way, Steve was suddenly in front of the genius and taking her arm in a grip so gentle that it completely belied his tone. His concern mounted as he took in the extensive bruising. “Jesus, Toni, what happened?”
He had been struck with a blast of longing so fierce, he had almost forgotten to breathe. In his defense, though, he had been presented with the scene of the woman he loved, holding a child that he knew he was going to be crazy about; a picture of family that would complete the one he and Toni had built in the Tower. He hadn’t known that it was something he’d wanted; certainly, they’d never spoken about it; but seeing it in that moment? The very picture of a future with the love of his life? There was nothing Steve had wanted more, with the obvious exception being the time when he’d been pining over the genius herself. It was the tangible promise of forever.
Anguish now, the likes of which she wouldn’t have felt comfortable showing, but apparently was strong enough to bubble forth.
“I think you deserve some ice cream, little hero,” she teased lightly, and that was enough to distract the four year old. It wasn’t nearly enough for Steve, who looked at her with the forlorn expression of a kicked puppy, but the hurt was too fresh in her mind and heart to handle now.
“Something like that,” Steve replied cryptically, and Toni wondered whether her lover was going to need a lawyer. Before she could ask, her supersoldier zeroed on to the mottled mess that was her left bicep, and grimaced. “Have you taken anything for that?” he asked, sounding like he already knew the answer as he reached out to grasp her elbow, acting as a temporary brace.
“Cap insisted,” was all Fury said in response, and Toni suddenly couldn’t handle being anywhere near him or the stupid SHIELD headquarters.
Steve focused his attention on Phillips, dismissing Howard Stark from his mind. The man was still as derisive of him as he had been when Steve had been scrawny and short, and for some reason, that rankled him more than any drunk patron or back alley bully ever had. Before he could offer up even a token defense, he was being skillfully talked into something else, and even without asking, Steve somehow knew that he wasn’t going to like it.
She swallowed hard as Steve let out a disbelieving laugh and caught the man in a huge hug. Fury and Coulson’s eyes were on her, but Toni couldn’t remove her gaze from where her boyfriend was already excitedly reminiscing with the man he knew as his old friend.
The Thunder God shook his head in the negative. “The Captain is on his way to her, along with the Hulk and the Winter Soldier,” he replied grimly. “For now, I’m meant to be holding the fort at the home base and guarding the little one.”
“At ease, soldier,” Bucky murmured, eyes gentle as he took in the stiff stance Steve had taken. “You doin’ okay?” He winced and shook his head before Steve could so much as raise an eyebrow, pinching the bridge of his nose impatiently. “Stupid question, I know. M’sorry.”
Amazingly, Tony’s lips twitched slightly, but he doggedly refused to smile. Not while he was mad at Barnes. They could enjoy this newfound friendship once Steve was safe and Tony was done being positively furious.
Maico shook his head, but it felt more like he was just trying to bury himself closer to her with the movement. “I want to go home,” he whimpered, and those five words flashed her right back to her son’s tearful plea from a few hours ago.
In his life, Tony had accumulated a lot of guilt. He lived with the guilt of designing ways to make killing easy for years, and the guilt of being the son to a man who still did. He lived with the guilt of knowing that his mark had been on the missile that had killed his mother. He lived with the guilt of knowing that she had given up her life for him, even still.
“Thanks, Uncle Loki,” Peter beamed, throwing his arms around him quickly. Then, turning to his clock, he waited anxiously until it turned exactly 11:11, and promptly looked up at the stars, hands clasped as tight as he could manage. After he found the brightest star, he concentrated on it and shut his eyes. “I wish for Mommy to come home tomorrow,” he whispered, focusing every last bit of his energy on his wish. “Please, please, please. I wish for Mommy and Daddy to come back home, with Uncle Bucky and Uncle Bruce. And for everyone to be happy and together. Please, Momm- uh, please guardian angel,” he hastily corrected himself. “I wish…please…”
Steve nodded in acknowledgement, feeling a small part of him twinge in disappointment, but he was mostly worried. Toni had seemed a little sluggish earlier when they’d spoken, but she had still been all quick smirks and quicker retorts, so Steve had written it off as overprotectiveness.
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Steve clasped a hand over his shoulder. “Sorry about that, Howard,” he apologized sheepishly. He wished he could offer some kind of insight, but with a start, he realized that he had no clue what had set off Toni’s infamous temper. It had to have been something, since it generally took a hell of a lot to work her up to the point of letting her fists talk instead of her scathing words.
Steve chuckled, eyes warming again and chasing away most of the concern. “I know your instincts are buzzing on this one, sweetheart. And I’m listening. I am.”
Finally, Tony dragged his gaze back towards Steve, and something tugged viciously at the super soldier’s chest when their eyes locked. “You’ll know when you’re in love, Cap,” he stated quietly, something painful darkening his eyes to hickory. “It’s the best and the worst feeling in the world.”
She’d long since powered the suit, and effectively JARVIS, down, wanting to conserve power now that she was being forced to use the backup. The darkness, at least, was combated by her arc, and as much as she hated the thing, she had to admit that this was another in a long string of instances wherein the stupid thing had saved her ass.
“Easy, Steve,” the genius murmured, one hand petting the outside of his thigh soothingly while the other rubbed absently at the pre-come that had inadvertently gotten streaked across Tony’s cheek. God fucking damnit, that was so sexy… “Let me take care of you,” he cajoled lowly, eyes sparkling with mischief but somehow simultaneously soft.
Keeping her eyes trained on Clint, Toni spoke low and steady. “Steve didn’t touch me. My asshole of a father is visiting from the past, don’t ask me why, but he grabbed me, and I punched his lights out when he looked like he was going to do something similar to Peter. Broke his face, and possibly my own wrist. That’s the long and the short of it.”
Steve’s first reaction was to crush the camera and the microphone of the reporter spouting all that bullshit about his girlfriend, but it was overshadowed by sudden realization.
“Palladium poisoning,” Steve repeated, and it didn’t sound any less sinister or terrifying the second time around. “Is there an antidote? Some kind of cure?” His heart dropped into his stomach when she shook her head wordlessly, but Steve refused to give up that easily. “What about slowing it down? Is there a way to slow it down until we find an antidote?”
He couldn’t help it, then. He kissed her, hard and fierce, swallowing the surprised little sound she made and licking deep into her mouth to take everything she was willing to give him. He kissed her until she was breathless, until he was breathless, until everything around them ceased to exist. Until his only point of awareness was her body against his.
Steve knew, all at once and with crystal clear clarity, that he couldn’t stop Toni from going after them. It would be entirely the wrong move, not only because he would be standing in the way of her and their son, in Toni’s eyes, but also because he’d be doing the one thing he always promised himself he would never do to her.
For the first time since he’d known her, Toni seemed to be struggling for words. “It’s complicated,” she finally muttered, sounding so miserable that Steve couldn’t even pretend to be frustrated with her.
She hadn’t factored in the aftershocks. Not because she hadn’t considered them, but because they’d been happening on and off the entire day without effect. But the Avengers moving the rubble combined with an already precarious structure and a slightly more powerful aftershock? It shouldn’t have surprised her that this happened. Momentarily, she berated herself for making the supposition that the aftershocks couldn’t get worse than what they’d had. After a main shock as big as the one they’d had, she should have worked on the assumption that a powerful tremor was working its way to them.
she admitted softly, and Rhodes felt uncomfortably like he was intruding on an intimate conversation, all of a sudden. But Rogers didn’t show any indication of wanting him gone, so stubbornly, he stayed.
Rather than shrinking away from his pretty impressive form, Stark only got up closer, chin jutting out in defiance. “Did Phillips tell you that? What a load of bullshit! D’you honestly think Erskine chose you –
Presumably, the partner had answered non-verbally in the negative, because they were frog-marching him through some doors without any more abuse to his admittedly achy body. It had been a long time since he’d been beat up, and despite his familiarity with it, it was never nice to get a refresher course.
The pressure started to gradually increase again, but this time, the pain was miraculously dulled to a slightly more tolerable level. Still excruciating, but his heart no longer felt like it would burst out of his chest from sheer agony, so Steve was profusely grateful.
And for all that he’d done to her, Toni could still appreciate one lesson that Howard Stark had taught her growing up:
Steve buried his face in her neck, grinding against her as if he could get even deeper than he already was. Her body lit up as the motion dragged him over her clit. “Love you, Toni,” he growled into her skin, rough and mindless. “Love you, I love you. Let go for me, baby, please let go for me.”
There were still things to talk about – Tony’s foray back into weaponry, who the kidnappers were, the fact that his boyfriend was a fucking mob boss – but that was tomorrow’s problem. For tonight, Tony just wanted to lay with the love of his life and relish the fact that nothing was actively and currently trying to tear them apart.
It was against her better judgement, but Toni couldn’t help herself as she used shaky fingers to turn her helmet back on. The extra light illuminated the small space once more, throwing her injuries into sharp focus, and if there was anything to be grateful for, it was that the kid looked exponentially better. She’d done her best to shield him during the collapse, but bruises would have been impossible to identify in her first cursory check. Now, though, hours had passed and Maico still looked healthy and unharmed, if a little restless in his sleep the longer he stayed under. It was probably nearing time for him to wake him… how long had they even been down there, already?
Straining to keep his voice level, Steve forced himself to ask, “What wasn’t for you, doll?” And then, because she sounded like she damn well needed it, he added gently, “It’s okay, sweetheart, tell me. We can fix it.”
“I know,” he eventually conceded, rubbing light circles on Peter’s back. “I’m glad she has him in her corner. I just… wish that I had been, too.”
To be fair, he hadn’t realized it himself either; at least not at first. But then, the chips went down and push came to shove and all those other metaphorical things happened, and Rhodes was forced to face just how much of a two-way street their relationship was…
Biting her tongue – literally – she turned around and got back to work on the upgrades she was making to her armour. When they faced down with HYDRA over this; and inevitably, they would; then she was going to need to be battle ready, and with the repulsors in her left boot currently little more than a mass of wiring and parts, she didn’t think she qualified.
Toni sucked in a rattling inhalation but visibly relaxed, her features smoothing out, and at the very least, Steve could breathe a little easier knowing that the pain had subsided. Exhausted eyes, dulled into a murky brown rather than sparkling hazel, peeked at him from underneath impossibly long lashes and he felt his breath catch briefly in his throat.
Smiling faintly at the woman, Toni shook her head once in reassurance. “That’s alright, he’s okay. He’s not much older than my own son, so I’m used to this,” she said, and if Maico’s mother was surprised by her fluency in Spanish, she graciously refrained from showing it.
” he repeated carefully, feeling more than seeing the smile lift her lips. “You’re my heart and my soul and my life, Toni Stark.”
“Just a training session,” he assured her softly. In truth, they both knew that he would say exactly that, whether his call to return was dangerous or not, and dimly, Toni could appreciate his natural inclination to keep her from worry.
“Sweetheart.” Steve cut her off with an equally fond and exasperated look. “You agreed to get checked out by the medics. You’ve been to hell and back. If he thinks that you should go to the hosp-…”
A shock of static was his only warning before Bucky came on to the line that Peggy had commandeered just a few minutes before Toni’s arrival on the plane. “Is she there?” his best friend demanded without preamble. His voice was tense and low in a way that it rarely got, except for moments when he was genuinely afraid. “What’s your status?”
“The echo caught an image of her,” Banner explained without preamble, tired eyes now brightened with anticipation and the promise of success. Behind him, Bucky crouched next to the crater, presumably to keep from adding any instability to the significant dent that Steve had made over the past few hours. “She’s closer from here, and there’s only a few layers of rubble left before we have a clear way down to her.”
Steve nodded as much as he could while kissing his genius. “I got you. Mine,” he growled after the – third? Fifth? – kiss, palming Tony’s ass possessively as he attempted to make it very clear who the man belonged to. “You’re mine, Tony, ain’t sharin’. Nobody gets to be with ya, only mine…”
Before she could react, the child himself was scrambling around her and glaring up at Howard with all the ferocity that a self-righteous four year old could possibly muster. “You’re a bully!” he yelled at her father, with a conviction that reminded her numbly of Steve. She could only gape at him as he launched into his tirade. “You’re a big, mean bully, and you’re not s’posed to hit girls, not
“You’re in love with him, aren’t you?” Sure enough, the elder Stark was like a dog with a bone. “Is that why you haven’t done anything to try to send him back? Back to where he belongs, with a woman worthy of being with him? Or,” his voice turned mocking, “do you actually believe that
He flicked his gaze towards her as she came to stand next to him, somehow managing a tremulous smile. “And yet you keep coming anyway,” he replied, drinking in the sight of her like it was the last time he ever would. Which seemed possible, now, even likely.
“Language,” Clint admonished weakly over the comms, and for the first time, Steve remembered that the entire team was probably listening to this. Tony was going to
His gut was churning, instincts screaming to him that he had missed something vital, had messed something up spectacularly, but he ignored them, willed them away in order to fix his attention on his old friend. Howard was struggling to his feet now, cradling his face, and at any other time, Steve would have been posturing with pride over the mean right hook his girlfriend had, that had probably broken her father’s cheekbone. Instead, he rushed forward to aid the older man, shifting his stance to support him.
He’d never been particularly good at sharing, but Steve didn’t care much about that. He had no intentions of sharing Tony, especially not now that he’d finally figured out that the genius was his.
But this wasn’t a time for wishful thinking, he reminded himself. This was a time for fixing things.
Toni nodded slightly in approval before remembering that she was on the comms. “Good… that’s good.” Maico stirred a little and she spared a moment to run a comforting hand through the child’s hair, soothing him with softly spoken Spanish and experienced fingers. “I’m sorry,” she offered quietly, once the little boy had gone still against her once more. “I was clear of the danger zone even after getting the rest of my employees evacuated, but… JARVIS picked up the kid’s heat signature and I just, I couldn’t… I couldn’t just stand there and not do anything. He’s
That snapped his attention to where the reporter, who’d spewed all that filth about Toni before, was now honed in on the little family of two. The way Rhodes’ spine stiffened, he knew enough of Spanish to understand what she was saying, too, and Steve started towards them to put an end to the slanderous words against his girlfriend. There had been enough times when he’d been forced to sit back and watch as the press tore into Toni just because she made herself an available target to protect everyone else, and he wasn’t about to let that happen again. Not now, when she’d done what he would have never had the strength to let her do, if he’d been given the choice. Not now, when she’d risked everything to do the right thing and save an innocent little boy.
There was enough fury still blazing through his body to make Steve want to cheer her on; but damned if he didn’t know his love better than she knew herself. What she needed, now, wasn’t more anger. Wasn’t more pain or more revenge or more bloodshed or death.
Spiky brunette hair, mussed and naturally curly, peeked out of the entrance to the tent. “Steve?” She furrowed her eyebrows in confusion but threw the flap open in wordless invitation. “Is everything okay?”
“I would do anything for Steve,” Tony interrupted icily, finally whirling around and stabbing a finger fearlessly into Barnes’ chest. Lethal enforcer didn’t even come close to vengeful lover as far as he was concerned. “But I’m not going to stand here and defend myself to someone who was ready to let him die an hour ago.”
Undefined though it may have been, it was exactly what she needed, and Toni shuddered out a breath that was equal parts relief and residual anxiety from the entire ordeal. Bucky held her closer still, thumb rubbing soothing circles at the base of her neck, not dissimilar to what she used to do for him when the Winter Soldier was too close to the surface for him to be comfortable with.
She rolled her eyes a little, but there was fondness in her eyes that was replacing some of the anguish, and Steve couldn’t think of anything he wanted more. Except, perhaps, Toni herself. When she was feeling a little better.
so many fucking times, and I would never have even known until it was too late.” His voice was ragged now, and there were anguished tears in the corners of his eyes, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop. He needed to make her understand, needed to make her see. “I wouldn’t have known until you stopped breathing, until you didn’t get up and I would have had to rip off that helmet and see the most important thing in the world to me just
And now that he was thinking about it, the way Toni flirted, it probably didn’t take her very long if she wanted something either.
He took her lips in a sloppy kiss. One big palm raked down the side of her body, and Toni hummed when Steve curled his hand around her knee and hitched her leg up around his waist. She quickly followed suit, wrapping the other one around him as well, and when he broke away, she wasted no time in helping to divest him of his t-shirt. When it was thrown to some corner of the room, her lover stole another short, searing kiss.
“I’m turning into you,” Bucky was saying in disbelief, but there was a hint of amusement lining his tone that told Steve he was being teased. “This is a horrible dream.”
“It’ll hold,” the other soldier stated confidently, rapping the chest plate with a gauntleted hand. “Gotta work on the impact absorption, because they hurt like a motherfucker, but I’m still secure.”
By the time they reached their room, small trembles were rocking through Steve’s body. Going on instinct again, as she seemed to do a lot, Toni pressed her lips to the top of her lover’s jaw.
At the time, it had felt like a weight close to the world’s had been sitting across his shoulders. How could he, or anyone, have possibly predicted that it would be Toni Stark, the woman renowned for her cold and untouchable demeanor, who would share that load with him?
Toni shrugged, already toweling the area off carelessly and easing surgical thread through the eye of the needle. “I needed to sterilize the wound,” she explained, so reasonably that Steve had to wonder whether this was karmic retribution at work for all the times he’d aggravated Bucky with his reckless tendencies. “I’m good,” she added, glancing up at him when she realized that he was practically vibrating with badly concealed worry. “Won’t even need more than ten sutures. Twelve, tops.”
Jaw clenched, he grabbed his jacket and stormed out of Steve’s study, crossing the hallway and taking the stairs two and three at a time as he headed down to the basement he’d converted into a workshop.
But if that wasn’t enough to break his heart, then the shattering confirmation that she’d been abused for that long, had certainly done the trick.
Since he was fairly certain that he wouldn’t be convincing Bucky to stay behind, Steve had made the difficult decision of leaving Thor behind, the God having shown up within ten minutes of the news breaking. Thor himself had done what he’d always done; nodded understandingly and vowed to hold the fort along with Nat and Clint; and that had left Bucky and Bruce to accompany him. Bruce was a no-brainer, what with the Hulk’s strength combined with his protectiveness over Toni, not to mention the doctor himself. Whatever happened, Steve wanted Bruce in on checking Toni over, since the genius only really trusted her science bro by way of medical.
Though she resented it, the genius knew she couldn’t lie about that. “No,” she admitted after a brief pause, cringing at the dead silence her words were met with. “The suit has its own emergency oxygen supply, but…”
“Sure thing, pal,” Steve nodded, more than ready to get back to his beautiful genius. He just needed to make sure, one more time, that she was okay before he went back to his room and turned in for the night.
Toni shifted just so much until she could watch over her sleeping son. A maelstrom of emotions all battled for dominance inside her. Absently, a thought waylaid her simmering emotions, and as she pondered it, and applied it to a more realistic reasoning approach…
“Don’t,” he entreated softly, muscles vibrating with barely restrained rage even as he pulled her closer with untold gentleness. Steve pressed a chaste kiss to her lips, then another, and another. “That wasn’t your fault, sweetheart. Don’t ever think that. Don’t do that to yourself.”
Toni, hurt and scared and alone, clawing her way up from the destruction and hanging on to survival by a single thread.
“Knock it off, Gomez,” Toni drawled, somehow managing to sound both bored and sharp. “Nobody here wants to see your pale, pasty tail, we’ve all seen enough horrors to last a lifetime.”
Steve instructed her firmly, something fierce slipping into his tone. As though he could impress his own determination over her wellbeing onto her.
“Eight?” The genius whistled low, a sound of amazement that was pretty much universal. “Wow, you’re practically a grownup then, aren’t you?” she asked, injecting admiration in her tone that she knew Peter got a kick out of when she directed it at him.
It was more or less the last words she’d expected to hear from him, misery and helplessness drenching his whisper, and Toni thought her shock was quite evident in the owlish blinking of her eyes and the slackness of her jaw.
She’d only asked him twice before; once, right after she was rescued from The Ten Rings, and the second, after Obi had tried to kill her; and Rhodey had asked her three times, all of them back when she’d first taken up the helm of the company and had been expected to oversee a few dangerous weapons displays, and so Toni knew that if she asked him to now, her best friend wouldn’t hesitate.
“You should go on ahead, Winghead,” he suggested softly. “Clunky metal isn’t really conducive to stealth mode. I’ll find another way in and meet up with you.”
“What’s wrong, Steve?” he asked, achingly soft. The use of his first name simultaneously sobered and thrilled him; the former because of how rarely Tony used it, and the latter because, well… Tony
“Then explain it to me,” he implored instead, pinning blue eyes on her that he hoped conveyed exactly how worried and scared she’d made him.
With a mischievous wink, she lifted his fingers and brought them to her mouth, sucking the digits clean of her juices that had coated them.
“Shall I open a private line to Captain Rogers, Madam?” JARVIS asked gently, and it said something about Toni’s mental state that she’d almost forgotten her beloved AI’s presence.
It had been beyond difficult for him then, away from home and his family without any contact for the first time. The worst part hadn’t been the aching muscles or the abhorrent living conditions or the constant knowledge that lives were depending on him; the worst had been the sheer distance away from everything he’d grown up knowing and loving. It was the reminder, every day, that his Ma woke up praying that she wouldn’t get a telegram about him. The reminder that Stevie was trying to enlist and probably also curled up in a ball at night trying to breathe right because he always pushed himself too much during the day. The reminder that everything could go to hell in a handbasket for him in an instant, and his loved ones would be left to suffer through life without him there to do whatever he could to help them.
Everything around Toni, save for the kid’s soft breaths, was completely still; oppressive in how it totally stifled one who generally surrounded themselves with noises of some kind as a way to drown out the noise in the back of their mind. There was no
“I love you,” Steve told Tony hoarsely, feeling like he needed to say it again and again for all the missed opportunities and all the times when he’d foolishly left Tony thinking otherwise. “I love you, baby, I’m so sorry fo-…”
So, yes. This idea that Toni was a soulless automaton was not entirely out of the realm of what she wanted. But someone had once said to be careful of the lies one told themselves, lest they begin to believe them to be true… and though Toni didn’t make a habit of paraphrasing Dostoyevsky to herself, there was no denying that those words had always rung close to home for her.
“How’s Saturday?” he asked softly, eyes no longer on the screen or the timer or anything, now. He had his eyes closed, picturing Toni smiling at him from underneath her lashes as they danced together to a song that never ended. “Eight o’clock? If you promise to let me keep taking you, I promise we’ll make it a regular thing.”
Steve’s stomach physically lurched with fear and fury, and if he wasn’t been so intent on curling around the grenade, he would’ve gotten in her face about how stupid and reckless she was being. Just because she liked to pretend she was hot shit, didn’t make her
Red crept up Steve’s cheeks, but he forced himself to answer. “Whoever you were with that wasn’t me.”
Things had, of course, gotten better. When Rhodes had realized that Steve was as crazily in love with Toni as one person could be with another, and when Steve had realized just how many awful and sickening things the man had seen Toni through and protected her from as far as possible, the military men reached an understanding. Toni was their common thread and the one person in the world that they would fight heaven and hell for. They would always be suspicious of each other and step on each other’s toes more often than not, but for the most part, they teamed up tentatively to take care of Toni.
So, no. She didn’t fear death, but Toni deeply feared leaving behind those who she’d come to love so deeply and completely.
The thought had no sooner formed in his mind before he regretted it, because in the next second, he felt the cool, unmistakable edge of a blade against the side of his neck.
Toni handed a confused Peter to Natasha, who gracefully stepped out of the kitchen in a way that kept the child’s eyes averted from the tense scene. Without any reservation, the genius came over and forcefully inserted herself between them, pushing Clint back gently with her good hand. Steve relaxed as the motion put space between him and Clint’s knife, but he had to consciously make an effort not to curl his hand around Toni’s hip, an instinctive action he usually did when he had her back against his chest like this.
Steve had been the one who’d convinced him that there was more to himself than a mindless asset; but Toni had been the one who’d convinced him that there was more to
“Peggy!” Toni returned in the same urgent tone, grinning disarmingly and taking off her goggles to face Agent Carter. “Always lovely to be greeted with your dulcet tones. What can I do for you and the Captain this evening?” Though she included him in the question, Toni didn’t even glance his way, and Steve tried to squash the unpleasant feeling in his gut that came from the slight.
She nodded, biting her lip with a look of shame and abject misery that Steve couldn’t stand seeing. “It has a palladium core. Ark reactors… they’re incredibly new technology, virtually unheard of especially in a size this small. Not even my dad knows I managed to build this one, because I don’t want to think about what he would try to do if he knew it could be created and even miniaturized. Because the thing is, while the power source should essentially run my heart for the equivalent of fifty lifetimes, the palladium in it was never meant to be saturated into my bloodstream. It’s caused palladium poisoning; which is seen with these black lines.”
And when, at some point during the night, Peter found his way to cuddle up on Toni’s other side, so that she was sandwiched between them, that comfort was only reaffirmed.
Toni had dealt with that devastation as a little girl, already; hidden in the safe and warm embrace of Jarvis, or her mother. From behind sparks and wires and tools and the wonder of creation, she’d regrouped and realigned her expectations and emotions. She’d learned how to foster the hurt and turn it elsewhere, to anger or belligerence or feigned indifference.
“That wasn’t very kind of you,” Peter scolded the blond with a tone too serious for his age, and with a start, Toni realized that he sounded exactly like a Disappointed Steve Rogers. If it were any other time, the billionaire would have been on the floor with laughter. “You
It was a quick walk to Toni’s room, made even quicker by the haste with which Steve walked in his eagerness to see his dame, and he liked to think that eagerness was reciprocated when Toni was so quick to answer.
Steve half-heartedly kicked the edge of the armchair, not wanting to expend the energy to actually reach his smug friend. “I can pay attention to Peter and think about Toni at the same time, jerk,” he replied automatically, arranging his features into an expression of playful condescension he’d seen Toni pull too many times to count. “S’called multi-tasking.”
“Hey, Sugarplum? Do you think you could stop treating the love of my life like some kind of parolee?” she asked, hoping to catch Rhodey off-guard and succeeding as he spluttered slightly, making her grin. “Seriously. I don’t want to one day explain to Peter that Uncle Rhodey only hates Dad on principal.”
Toni grinned, rocking her chair until it was balanced on the back two legs and propping her feet on the desk. “Oh, J, I love it when you talk dirty to me.”
He still remembered the day that he’d realized how far he’d come – how much he’d gained – and per usual, Toni was right in the middle of that epiphany…
On the plus side, she mused to herself wryly, at least all the times where she’d learned to duck a swing from her old man was now working in her favour.
There was anguish that made the fear seem even darker; shadowed it, like a dark cloud that made all the bad things even worse. She knew that it would be a two-pronged stake to the heart for Steve, no less: the first, because of the residual horror from what they’d just been through, and the second because of the torment over the evidence of it on Toni. Steve’s fears had been confirmed when he’d finally seen her in the harsh light of day. Not the worst fears, of course, but enough to leave him feeling needlessly tortured over her injuries.
Not to say that he hadn’t, before. Granted, the first time he’d gotten the actual words from Toni, had been after Afghanistan, and she’d been high on painkillers and sheer relief at the time, but he’d heard them a lot from her after that. Almost as if the hesitation to speak those three words had vanished after gathering up the courage to say them the first time. He still remembered how he’d frozen in shock, having difficulty computing the words since he’d actually never heard her say them in the entirety of their friendship. Later, he would find out that she’d only ever said them a handful of times before, to her mother and Jarvis, and later still, he would learn that he was the first person in years who she’d been inclined to say it to, and really mean it, but in that moment? After three months of mind-numbing terror that he would never see his best friend and surrogate baby sister again? The only thing he’d been able to think about was how he was never going to let anyone hurt her like that again.
His hands found her hips and, mindless with desire, he yanked her forward, dragging her across the bed to its edge and groaning lowly when she took the cue to unfold her legs and wrap them around his waist instead. In an instant, he stood, taking her with him and turning them around so that when he sat on the bed, she was seated snugly on his lap. Immediately, Toni shifted forward, pressed as close as she could, rocking down against the straining bulge in his pants. Steve jerked his hips upwards in response, a grunt of pleasure falling from his lips, and he was rewarded with the hottest little whimper that had him already plotting ways to wrangle the sound from Toni again. Starting with undoing some of the buttons on her shirt that was regretfully keeping her from his view.
Steve’s face settled into a familiar look of determination. Whatever decision he’d taken in that charged moment between them, Toni knew, would not be swayed or fought with any argument.
If he minded, the soldier didn’t show it. Instead, he offered a lazy little salute of agreement. “You got it, Winghead.”
As if he’d heard her thoughts, Bruce softly and tactfully redirected the EMT to fetch some supplies, and smoothly made the transition to continue stitching the large gash in her arm.
Steve had always loved to watch Tony’s mind at work. It was a thing of wonder, like getting to see the absolute inner workings of something so complex and advanced that you knew you’d never be all the way caught up to it, but could revel in the work of art that it was anyway. And revel he did, especially in those moments when Tony forgot he was there and his hands became a blur of motion as he manipulated diagrams and shot through calculations with a speed that surpassed even JARVIS’.
He’d gone out before, sure, but… this was different. He was with Tony, in that moment, and appreciation for the little things came easy when he was around the inventor. Right now, for instance. He was grateful for New York; he was grateful for chocolate ice-cream and sprinkles. He was grateful for summer breezes and quiet streets and sleepless nights that belonged to nothing and nobody but him and his best friend.
He turned as she came into view, and even though he smiled, Toni could read the concern in his eyes. “Come to co-pilot?” he asked teasingly.
“Do you understand what I’m telling you, Mr. Stark?” Rumlow asked, not particularly kindly. He looked rather bored, honestly, save for the spike of vicious satisfaction that he hadn’t been quick enough to hide from Tony when he’d mentioned Steve’s kidnapping.
He was special. So special, and so incredibly unlike anyone that the super soldier had ever known before. He’d always known as much; of course he had; but when was the last time that Steve had expressed any of that appreciation? Was that why Tony was
to him – so it wasn’t like he was having issues separating out his biological family from this new, adoptive one. But still, he persisted in calling her mommy until she corrected him. The therapist who had worked with Peter for the months following his family’s deaths had theorized that it had to do with the safety he felt in Toni’s presence; that it was something of a coping mechanism, as well as a way to feel secure in this new and unfamiliar environment. After learning that, she had been far more patient, allowing the title only in the moments when Peter seemed most afraid or vulnerable. But if others were using it, Peter was never going to stop.
The ark reactor looked like it was little more than a disk against her chest, but even though Steve knew how invasive it was, he couldn’t help finding it stunning. It was, despite all its faults, the thing that was giving Toni life, the thing that had brought her to him instead of losing her before they’d even met, and no matter what, Steve simply didn’t have the ability to think of it as anything less than amazing.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"No thank you, Captain," she said, her tone cold but scrupulously polite. "I'll take it from here." A slight pause. "Thank you."
Steve nodded, expression turning a little melancholy as he said, “Seems like there are some lessons we never quite learn.”
“We’ll talk later,” Tony said with a resigned sigh, but Cap had that stubborn look on his face, confused and frustrated. He didn’t look like somebody keen to wait. Tony cast about for a means of escape.
Tony sighed and shook his head. “Shut it all down, JARVIS,” he said and headed for the elevator. He’d take the express up to his own floor and his own scotch. (Rogers practically lived in that common room, so, yeah-- no.) Eventually, they’d have to talk, but not yet. Not until Tony figured out what the hell he wanted to say.
Tony very deliberately got out of the limo first, smiled and waved to the press, but didn’t stop at their cries of “Tony! Tony, over here!”
“Calm down, Rogers,” Tony said, jerking himself from his thoughts.  Clearly Rogers misread his silence.  “I know how to use a phone—I could call the Submissive Rights Organization myself.  It’s nothing like that.”
“I was wrong about you, Cap,” Tony muttered into his scotch, then shook his head. (Doesn’t count if he can’t hear you, stupid.) Tony squinted.
Tony nodded and kindly refrained from pointing out he’d spent plenty of time on military bases, what with being Merchant of Death and all, thanks so much.  Sure, this was standard on
“Excuse me, JARVIS? Where’s Tony?” Steve asked, looking up. (Yeah, yeah—not in the ceilings, whatever.)
had an idea, did she?” Tony asked. He shook his head incredulously. “I still can’t believe how buddy-buddy you are with her now, after— Well,
Maybe Tony would tie him up like in his drawing?  Maybe he’d tie him up then push him against the bed and fuck him from behind, murmuring soft and dirty in his ear.  (“You like that, baby?  Fuck!  Take it!  Yeah, you’re gorgeous.”)  Maybe he’d make Steve beg for it.  (“Tony,
Howard told Tony that even when Captain America was frail, even when he wasn’t Captain America yet, he was a real Dom because he was always brave, assertive, and confident; he never backed down, even without the physical strength to back it up.  That kind of inner strength marked him as a real Dom; muscles were overrated.
“That was some romantic story you told earlier, sweetheart,.” Steve teased him softly. He gave Tony a little squeeze. “Practically
Steve shrugged.  “Yeah.  It’s like they don’t want to risk overexposure.”  Steve took another bite of ham sandwich and watched Bruce rummage through the fridge.
Clint laughed. “None taken. My bow came from SHIELD and I still don’t like it when they get too close to it.”
consider a wide array of possibilities: that he’d been too forward; that Steve was just shy; that Steve wasn’t attracted to him; that he’d done something taboo; or . . . or (absurd! ridiculous!) Steve had simply changed his mind.
“Golly. Thanks, little guy,” Steve said to Dummy, accepting the oil can and patting him on the head. “It’s very thoughtful of you to offer me your oil. Very generous of you to look after me . . . And I’m grateful.”
“Got it, J,” Tony said.  (Just as well. Another few moments and he might have jumped his Dom and ditched the gala all together.)
heavier than its size would suggest. The Iron Man armor was up to the unexpected challenge, but probably looked about as graceful as a chicken in flight.
“Mmmm,” Tony mumbled and rolled over, pressing himself up against Steve’s body.   (Oh fuck!)  Steve could feel Tony’s morning erection rubbing against his thigh.  He bit off a little moan.
“Oh my god!”  Pepper squeezed his hand.  “I’m so happy for you!  I thought you’d be magnificent together, but I had always thought he was straight so I never said anything or asked you about it because, well, what would the point have been, but I--”  Pepper floundered, but in an enthusiastic flailing sort of way.  Tony found himself baffled by her enthusiasm but more pleased and touched by it than he could have imagined.
“JARVIS?  Metallica—no, wait.  Actually, let’s rock some Beyoncé. And get up the blueprints for the Avengers’ floors.”
Tony sighed. “Sorry, J.” He shook his head. “Fucking screens. Okay, yeah. I’ll come right back to this after the gala. But now I’d better dash.”
Steve nodded.  Then Tony swung his leg over to straddle Steve’s back.   Steve held his breath, thrilled by the weight of Tony’s body on top of him.  Using the added leverage, Tony went back to massaging Steve’s neck and shoulders, his hands warm and soothing.  Steve took long, deep breaths, relaxing more and more.
Tony didn’t know what to do with that number. It seemed at once huge, yet on some level relatively small.
Tony thought he might have dozed off for a few minutes; he felt alert and rejuvenated when he stirred again in a way he hadn’t earlier.
“Oh, Pep!  You picked the right time to visit!” Tony exclaimed, nudging her affectionately.  “Steve makes
Slow chapter is slow, but finally ready!  This chapter informed by an informal survey taken on tumblr and my magnificent beta. :)
“You know, Tony,” Bruce said, drawing his attention from the other side of the table, “I’ve been thinking about the poly-aramid and maybe—here, can I have that napkin? Thanks. What if—“
“Mr. Stark?” Rogers’ voice pulled him from his thoughts.  “Are you all right?  Is there something wrong with the omelet?”  Tony looked down and realized he’d been destroying the omelet, hacking it into smaller and smaller bites until it was ground all over the plate.  “I can make you another if you--”
They were silent. Tony’d watched Rogers’ interview dozens of times in the past few days—you’d think in all that time, he’d have figured out what he wanted to say about it. The silence lingered.
“Tony, you've been down here for a week,” Steve said, expression softening, voice coaxing. “You need to--”
Tony nodded and took another gulp of coffee.  Steve’s coffee had gone cold, but he took a sip anyway to have something to do.  They sat in silence on the couch.  Steve stared straight ahead, out the huge windows as the sun came up over New York. The rosy-fingered dawn.  They drank their coffee silently, but the silence was starting to itch, a tense scratchy feeling, and nature abhors a vacuum.
and eat a stack of JJ’s waffles before Steve suddenly remembered it was a Monday and somehow this meant he should be doing something productive. Tony convinced him that productivity levels in the workshop were “Epic! Legendary!” and Steve should definitely read briefing packets and work on a new training module with JARVIS there. (Where Tony could keep an eye on him.)
Steve looked at him with a tender, almost wistful smile and murmured very softly, “For love . . . makes one little room an everywhere.”
“I did too,” Fury admitted. “But, whether you believe me or not, I like you Stark. Always have. I underestimated you, but you’ve more than proven yourself and it’s not a mistake I’d make twice.”
“Anyway,” Steve said, standing abruptly. “I’m so sorry. I lost track of time. I—I’d better go. There are some errands I’ve been putting off.”
Everything hurt. There was a vice around Tony's chest, an ache right behind the arc reactor, and his eyes stung and watered leaving his cheeks wet.
“Funds for travel expenses to Manhattan and a good meal on the way,” she said briskly. “One pm tomorrow at the enclosed address if you’d like to meet him and continue the interview process. If not, then I wish you well, Mr. Rogers.”
“It is no problem,” Thor said seriously.  “We shall watch this third Terminator movie some other time.  I am happy to see the comic film Bruce has suggested for us.”
“Yes,” Tony gasped, feeling laid bare by that single word. There was something almost humiliating about being forced to verbalize his pleasure. It brought an unexpected blush to his cheeks with a rush of lust.
Katie was quiet for a moment. “You know your generosity could inspire others to become more involved, to give back to the community.”
“Good.  Now that that’s settled,” Tony leaned closer for a seductive whisper, “I want you to go into the bedroom.”  Tony tried to sound commanding as he continued, “Take off all your clothes and kneel on the floor beside the bed.  I’ll join you in a few minutes.  Just wait for me and don’t move.  Okay, baby?”
And, yeah, Tony should just stop trying to drink while Steve was talking about sex.  It went poorly.  Choking was no fun.
“Excuse me, Captain?” Tony said briskly, doing his best at a military bearing. “I’m sorry to bother you, but this just came in. It’s probably nothing, but I wanted to bring it to your attention.”
“So,” Tony asked, trying for a rakish grin and leaning his hip against the counter. “Any of that for me?”
Tony woke to the sun streaming in through his vast panoramic widows. (He was alone.) He winced and squeezed his eyes shut, calling out a plaintive, “Jarvis?”
(Duh, nobody can keep up with us.  Nobody!  You’re so much better than I am. Never feel bad about yourself.  Oh fuck,
“I’ve got you, darling,” Steve promised, pulling Tony’s hands down around his shoulders.  He kissed Tony tenderly.  “I’ve got you.”
“But to be honest, fighting aliens was probably the easiest part,” the Captain says. Scattered audience laughter; he looks at them. “I mean that seriously. Which I realize is strange. But waking up in the future--not understanding how to do things, even things children now take for granted, and constantly putting my foot in my mouth was hard to deal with. At least fighting to defend my country and civilians was familiar. And fighting was much easier to do when the enemy wasn’t human. Dictators and war-mongers have dehumanized their opponents for centuries, but, well, the arachnids actually weren’t human.”
Toni interrupted him icily, and a whole new wave of horror washed over him when he recognized the name of the headmistress of Peter’s school. Toni couldn’t be implying… no, not…
Before he could stop her, Toni grabbed the bottle of scotch and upended some of it over her wound, lips going white as she sealed them shut in an effort not to cry out from the pain.
“Well, you would know all about falling short of expectations, wouldn’t you Stark?” His voice was cold, acerbic even, as he spoke. Toni’s eyes widened briefly, the hurt expression somehow made worse by the fact that she was so surprised, as if she hadn’t expected he would be the one taking such a direct hit at her.
“Aw, c’mon, Toni,” Bucky wheedled, and it started a round of playful bickering between them. Steve felt strangely content as he watched on in amusement, Toni’s threats getting progressively more ridiculous while Bucky countered with reminders of little things he’d done for her before Steve had even got there.
It hadn’t surprised him in the least when Toni had led their conversation by asking about Peter. She was without a doubt one of the best mothers he’d ever known, despite the fact that she constantly seemed to fear messing it up. Steve knew with a great deal of certainty that there was little, if anything, that Toni wouldn’t do for her son. For their son.
But that was Captain America. Steve Rogers, on the other hand, felt things all the way through to his soul.
She needed to feel safe, Steve knew that. Toni and Peter both. Toni’s safe space was her workshop and the lab, and Peter’s safe space was wherever Toni was, but since the workshop had Howard, and the lab wasn’t kid-friendly enough… where in the Tower was still somewhere Toni felt safe?
Bruce kept her mind alert by shooting theories past her; discussing his latest project and a few new ideas he’d had while she’d been away; and Steve kept her spirits up with stories about Peter, and the rest of the Avengers, and home. Unfortunately, her companions hadn’t factored in their own fatigue and the adrenaline crash they’d had to face eventually, and it amused Toni to no end when she found Bruce passed out awkwardly where he was sat, and Steve nodding off as she spoke, stretched out on the bed next to her.
“I’m sorry, Mom,” she breathed inaudibly, pressing numb, shaking fingertips against the cold plaque and tracing over the engraving. “I’m so sorry.”
Probably the same thing that was said by the fact that he trusted Tony to keep him safe, enough to start getting distracted while a blade was digging into his neck. That he was stupidly in love with the man.
She supposed she’d deserved it, to an extent – deception courted deception – but it had vexed her no less. And then, inexplicably, it had worried her, because what business did this annoying, but admittedly brilliant genius have putting up a front like that? Pretending to be self-destructive and so full of it that she made people with narcissistic personality disorder look modest? What on earth did Toni have to protect herself against?
“We’re less than two hours away.” It was Bucky who offered the update, voice hollow and calm, but Steve could see the way he was battling for control. His best friend usually refrained from giving the reins to the Winter Soldier programming in him, but Steve got the impression that this time, Bucky was only doing it until he could take a chunk out of AIM himself.
Steve took a sip of beer and shrugged. “Guess I’m still intimidated by being here with all the swells.”
“Tony, uh,” Steve began awkwardly.  He could feel Tony brace, as if for a blow.  “I really don’t know.  I—you’re talking about the crying thing, right?  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  I--”
Tony felt a wash of unexpected relief and his eyes prickled. (Fuck.) Steve kissed his thighs and pressed against his prostate, sliding in and out, firm and slick and good . . .
JARVIS’s tone sounded oddly reproachful. Tony wanted to be irritated that his AI had these little partialities and loyalties, but mostly he just felt proud.
“I surrender,” Tony said dramatically, tossing his head back. “Do with me as you will, O mighty conqueror!”
“We’ve even got a secret handshake.”  Rhodey reached out to give him a little shove.  “So spill, man.”
Rebecca shook her head as she continued, “Ockerman’s convinced he’s found Erasmus’ hand in the marginalia of MS.47-79f. I’m pretty sure it’s wishful thinking, but we’ll see. Anyway,” she gave a little shrug, “I’ll have my cell phone on me at all times and will be able to pick up within five minutes—I just have to leave the reading room. The number’s in your phone.”
Jackie laughed. “Oh good. I’ll put them in the Rolodex. And you know who else I just added, on the word of two
“Let go,” Tony said pulling back.  Steve took a deep breath and forced his fingers to relax.  He wanted to pull Tony close again, wanted to protest as Tony stepped away to sit on the bed, looking up at him. Steve stood, flushed and panting in the middle of the room.
“I always thought he died in the war,” Tony said, looking contemplatively into his glass. “It’s what the official bios said, I think.”
“The StarkTab modifications you pulled together look fantastic,” Pepper said.  She looked back to her tablet.  “It should give us a big bump in the third quarter.  Enough for another sixty or seventy million for the Foundation if the projections I ran earlier are on target.”
Cap looked at him, startled for a second, then held out his hands. Tony almost teased him—“Velcro fasteners? So modern!”—but he kept quiet, afraid it would sound mocking.
Another long pause.  Tony heard Rogers take a deep breath, then let it out a little too close to the mouthpiece.  Silence, then eventually, “All right, Mr. Stark.  Good luck.”
script to me.”  Steve said it pensively, then added, embarrassed, “but I mean, I’m hardly an expert.”
making smores?” Bruce protested. Clint just snorted and kept rummaging through the pantries—the many
“Well, if we’re in agreement,” Steve said, eyes flicking over to Bruce as he left a lingering pause. (Damn it, Steve! If you keep offering Bruce opportunities to back out, soon he’ll think you
“So,” Tony said, “we’re going to repair to the luxury of Stark Tower and get out of this shit hole.”  And he couldn’t resist adding, with a sweet smile, “Bruce has kindly accepted my invitation to move in.”
She took one step away from the booth, then turned back to add in a soft voice, “He isn’t always a nice man, but he is a good one.”
“You know,” Rogers said, frowning and hesitant, “I wasn’t always ‘a big strong Dom.’ ” He gestured up and down his body, then said more softly, “I know what it’s like to get backed into a corner.” He frowned as he added, voice firm, “And I don’t like bullies.”
“You say that like it precludes Chinese food!” Tony waved his arms extravagantly and leapt to his feet. “Come on, hollow leg, don’t tell me you couldn’t eat after pounding those bags.”
“But what if I say something wrong?” he asked. “Or use the wrong terms? Or get the presidents mixed up?”
Steve was different. He could be there, a steady, comfortable presence that didn’t demand anything, and yet wasn’t directly engaged in what Tony was doing like Bruce, but was just

.  Steve peeked at him from under his lashes.  Tony’s lips were parted, he was breathing heavily, and Steve could see the outline of Tony’s cock pressed against his trousers.
I’m back!  Sorry for the delay!  Travel, work, struggling to get this chapter right.  (Or, mostly right.)  And I learned how to use photoshop for this!

She smiled faintly when Bucky leaned over to kiss her forehead. “She’s up in front,” he called out randomly, and after a beat, Toni realized that his enhanced hearing had picked up Steve waking up in a relative panic, probably for finding her gone. A bare moment later, she laid eyes on her lover, blue eyes still glazed over slightly in a mix of unawareness and alarm, and watched as calm returned with the sight of her safe and present.
The barrel of his gun still smoked as the goons swiveled around to face him with eyes like saucers. By the time they drew their weapons, the nanotech from his watch was completely activated and covered his arm and chest in flipping panels of a gold-titanium alloy, while blue the same shade of the arc radiated with a high-pitched whine from the middle of his palm. His stance was military but his eyes were something else entirely; shrouded with the danger that came from threatening someone he loved.
“Brucie Bear!” Toni injected as much enthusiasm as she could manage into the address and was rewarded by two small huffs of laughter. She would bet the tower that her science bro was smiling, at the very least. “Fancy meeting you here. Hey, what about the new project? Isn’t it time-sensitive?”
“Sexy,” Toni murmured with a grin, and knew that he’d heard her when Steve barked out a laugh, shaking his head as he crossed the distance to the crowd. Although she generally insisted on protecting herself from the vapid reporters and soul-sucking story-chasers, Toni decided to let it go. Steve needed to shield her more than she needed to be shielded, today, and besides… she liked when he called her his girl.
She felt him grin when he pressed his lips to the top of her jaw, where the blush started, but she was too mellow from her orgasm to be affronted by how much Steve loved it when she flushed. Instead, she started another slow roll of her hips and grinned herself when Steve pressed his hips to hers with a muttered oath.
“Fabrication status of the Mach-12 Iron Woman armour is at 94% and rising. Systems indicate no unwarranted materials’ strain and my servers detect no glitches amidst the wiring or coding of the new features. Fabrication completion estimated at 23 minutes.”
“I don’t understand,” Bucky cut in, looking a little perplexed. “I thought JARVIS did these kinds of crazy calculations all the time?”
“I’m alright, Stevie,” she murmured, as soft and gentle as the reassurances she’d offered Peter. “I’m right here, I’m okay. You got me out of there and I’m safe, now.”
Various aches and pains made themselves known, but Tony didn’t give the beginnings of a damn about them as he clung to Steve. The fear from the afternoon finally pushed its way back to the front of his mind and Tony trembled in his soldier’s arms.
Still. He adopted a lightly stern expression. “You shouldn’t say things like that in anger, Howard.” He was only thankful that Toni hadn’t heard. Upset or not, that would have crushed her.

“Sir? Agent Romanoff noted your return. She asks that I inform you the team will meet for the gala in the common room at 7:40.”
Rogers added, “Perhaps if you just told me what some of the problem areas are, I’d be able to help.” Tony still didn’t answer.  Rogers frowned and added, voice tense and low, “If there’s anything at all . . .
.”  The way she said it seemed almost like an insult, but he couldn’t be sure.  “We could use you again next week, if you’re interested.”
“You got settled in the guest suite okay, right?” Tony asked. “Sorry! I should have showed you instead of JARVIS. Does it have everything you need? I can—“
“Other than finally asking Tony out on a proper date?” Steve shrugged. “Pretty much the same as usual. Working at SHIELD off and on. Minor call outs for the Avengers.”
Tony spent the morning thinking in his workshop and distractedly tinkering around with new arrows for Clint.  Steve was clearly still eager.  A little knot of tension had uncurled in Tony’s stomach that morning, releasing the (absurd, ridiculous) concern that maybe Steve had been lying earlier, that he really had been distressed, deeply & profoundly, that he’d realized this whole thing was a terrible mistake, but couldn’t make himself talk about his real concerns, so little by little he’d reject Tony’s touch and start to pull away until there was nothing left but a terrible politeness between them.  (See? Absurd.  That’s the sort of fucked-up, illogical thing an emotionally stunted genius would do, not Steve.)
Steve curled his hand around Tony’s throat and gave it a subtle squeeze; his lips twisted into a wicked smile as Tony whined in response. Steve rolled his hips very slowly against Tony’s.
“Maybe,” he said, pushing his reading glasses up on his nose. “I had an idea for a variation on Hypothetical 72.”
“Avengers,” Cap said, “Prepare to fall out. We’ll debrief at the Tower. Agents, tomorrow at SHIELD.” Everyone started shuffling off to their respective ships, but Steve added, “Agent James—a word.”
“I have the perfect suggestion!” Tony proclaimed, raising his arms. Clint and Rhodey groaned. “How dare you doubt my taste! Besides, Rhodey, you’re gonna love it.”
Tony felt helpless and fumbly. He started pacing, faster and faster. “Pepper, really. It’ll be okay. And so what if you aren’t partnered up? There are tons of awesome single parents out there! And, you know what? Lots of them work
“I could have found the upper solarium on my own, you know,” Tony pointed out as they trailed after her.
“Yeah,” Tony said, giving her a rueful smile and rubbing the back of his neck.  He took a sip of wine.  (Bleh.  Too sweet for a sauvignon blanc.)  He took another sip.  (Oh, hm. Better.)  He took a breath.
“Hey, Jarvis?” Tony called, pouring another cup of coffee. “Gimmie the specs for the training robots. And let’s get some Taylor Swift going.”
“They got your call in time,” Pepper said. “Spiders damaged the first and second floors, but that was after Jerry got everyone into the bunker, but--” Pepper’s eyes filled with tears, but her voice was steady. “He went back out.”
“No. I mean, yes,” Rogers said awkwardly. “That is, no you didn’t loose track of time; yes, the meeting is tomorrow.”
“Uh, right.”  Tony swallowed, embarrassed and guilty.  “I probably shouldn’t have thrown that away,” Tony conceded.  “I, uh—“
“Yeah.”  Tony left it at that, because he honestly didn’t know what he wanted to tell Pepper or what he’d been hoping she might say.  He’d never actually told her that Rogers had asked him on a date, let alone that Rogers might be making a habit of it.
“Uh,” Tony cut in feeling a little guilty, “I mean, if you actually get to the door first, then that’s fine.  And some subs are still cool with all of it, even in 2012-- they think it’s romantic or chivalrous or something, even if tons of us think it’s orentiationalist crap, so, uh, yeah.  That could have been confusing.”
“You can bring that with you. Hey, if you draw Dummy on your break again I’ll even give you one of these sandwiches.”
tense. But my mind was just stuck in the lab! We’re good.” Steve looked unconvinced. “This is really, uh, nice,” Tony added hesitantly, then with his usual brazenness, “Now shut up and pet me-- we’re missing the dialogue!”
“Oh well! The iPhone! That’s terrible,” Steve said with a grimace. “If a Stark product can’t even match the nadir of engineering fiascos . . .”
Steve kissed him almost desperately and Tony swam muzzily through the waves of pleasure. Kissing, gasping, writhing in Steve’s firm grasp, on and on. . . It wasn’t subspace—(of course not, stupid)—but it was relaxing and warm to take pleasure from Steve and to give it in return.
Thank you so much for your patience and support!  I hope you enjoy the new chapter!  (I worried a lot about pacing, but if I fuss over it any longer I may never post...  so, yes.)
“Well,” Tony said, taking another long gulp of coffee. “It’s stupid-o’clock in the morning and I’m awake, so I might as well get to work.”
Steve caressed the back of Tony’s neck, his hair, his shoulders as they kissed. Tony’s hands fumbled at the top button on his shirt as they kept necking. It was an uncoordinated, awkward tug-pull-pull at the buttons.

“You’re good,” Steve reassured, voice full of warmth (and wonder?). Steve stroked his hair. “I like hearing you.”
Tony laughed. The look of happy anticipation on Pepper’s face was starting to make sense: a business deal
Tony’s breath caught and he felt a (ridiculous, absurd) swell of gratitude. Steve’s feet were there—big and solid and
“Well, I should take these down to him.  Hopefully, he hasn’t gotten too filthy in the past ten minutes down there—it’s impossible to push that man into a shower!”  (No!  No, no.  Don’t!)  She rolled her eyes.  “He’d go to meetings covered in ink and grease if I’d let him!” Her tone was fond.  Something unpleasant was twisting in Steve’s gut.
“Does inventing a highly marketable poly-aramid fabric get me off the hook for the Quarterly Report?”
“Ready for the meeting, Mr. Stark?” Rogers asked at his side, seemingly oblivious to Agent Dickface.
“You didn’t hurt me,” Tony repeated.  He added, voice a little thick, “You were wonderful.”  He touched Steve’s cheek the way Steve loved to touch his and murmured, “You’re so good to me.”
Tony’s humming became more and more deliberate. He realized it was turning into a down tempo version of “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” but he figured Bruce like The Beatles, so that was fine.
Tony stepped away. “No problem.” He scratched the back of his neck. “So, yeah, why don’t you grab a shower and change, then meet me upstairs and I’ll reveal the wonders of
“Looks fantastic,” Tony said, washing his hands at the kitchen sink.  “Did you learn this in Home Ec?”
“Prepare for landing,” Clint called, then added, “Please ensure that all seatbacks are returned to their upright position and all tray tables are locked and stowed. We thank you for choosing Quinjet Air and hope you’ve enjoyed this eleven minute express flight.”
“Knock, knock?” a voice called from just outside the workshop.  Tony pulled the hoodie’s sleeves down over his wrists as he turned.
“I don’t want to see him get hurt.”  Clint shook his head and tried to say it calmly: “So, just, back off, ok?”
“You’re doing great,” Tony reassured him, flying low to pluck a fallen Agent off the ground and away from two oncoming spiders. Tony shot at them.
“Uh, yeah, sure.  Just set it over there.” Tony waved.  He watched as Captain America delivered his lunch, a heaping plate of Bolognese, and wasn’t it just a sight to behold?
Tony knew better than to yank against someone’s grip on his wrist, so instead he went limp suddenly, hoping to let his weight work for him and throw the Captain off balance. It backfired—Cap stepped around him and used Tony’s own weight to pull his arm behind his back and pin him helpless. Tony grunted.
“Pretty intense training schedule we’ve got coming up,” Natasha said. “How were the meetings at SHIELD yesterday, Steve?”
Bruce’s laugh sounded a trifle nervous as he answered Steve’s question: “Yeah, Tony’s surfaced for air a few times.”
(“Don’t use accusing language,” Pepper reminded him in his head. “Focus on your feelings, not the other person’s actions.”)
“Oh, hey,” Tony said, popping up suddenly from behind the counter with two fancy beer glasses. “Rhodey, Cap. Cap, Rhodey.”
And with that, Steve’s resolve caved. He wrapped a hand around his cock and kept sucking the fake dick as he called up memories and fantasies of Tony.
“Damn,” Jackie said, massaging Tony’s temples. “Okay, you’re not the first person to say less than glowing things about him. You ok? How bad?”
it all was. As Tony gave Steve a sweet answering smile, it sent a thrill racing through Tony’s veins to think this conventional ritual now had a personal history, a special meaning intelligible only to the two of them.
Cap shook his head, frowning. “No. I disagree. We should present a united front. If we add Iron Man to the team late, it will look like he’s not ranked the same as the others. Like he didn’t make first cut.”
Tony nodded. “The power of anonymity,” he said with a wry smile. “And distance. Most of them would never say things like that in person or with their real name. Never in a million years.”
Tony grabbed his tablet, pulled up the DOD mainframe, and within seven minutes heard Rhodey bark out: “This is Lieutenant-Colonel Rhodes. Who’s calling and how did you get this number?”
“I’m still grateful. I— uh, it wasn’t fair of Fury to surprise us like this. Or for them to talk about you like that.”
“I’m done for the day—don’t think there’s much of anything more I can do,” Steve said. He glanced over at Tony’s schematics, the gutted satellite, and little pile of arc reactor type things. “I was going to see if I could take you out for dinner, but it looks like you’ve still got a lot to do.”
Steve hesitated.  “I’m pretty sure it’s ‘lay on, MacDuff,’ actually.”  Steve paused and shook his head.  “And for somebody who doesn’t care about poetry, you drop an awful lot of Shakespeare lines.”
.  Since you’re only teaching enrichment modules and aren’t our CO it wouldn’t be against regulations.  And, I, uh,”  her voice dropped, shy or coy he couldn’t tell, “I’d really like to get to know you.”
“Sir? Perhaps now would be an opportune time to remind you once more that you need to prepare for the gala.”
“Oh, I’m quite well,” she said lightly.  “Arthritis acting up a little, but nothing to complain about.  You?”
. Steve’s voice was warm, genial; he sounded truly pleased to see Bruce and to have him joining them for
“No, Steve,” Tony said, waving his fork in the air, “it’s not just ‘good!’ Hot dogs in the park are ‘good!’ This is—“
“You’re, uh—“ (It’s like there are Beams of Earnestness shooting from Steve’s bright blue eyes, like Superman, only--) Tony lost his train of thought for a second. “Uh, you’re welcome?”
“Also, has anybody told Pepper she looks like Taylor Swift?” Clint asked. “The black skinny jeans and red lips really do it.”
Tony nodded, lathering his hair with shampoo. He kept his face out of the spray as he rinsed, formulating a plan.
“But, tell me, Cap,” Tony said, his polite smile at odds with his tight tone of voice. “What sent you rushing onto the balcony?”
Three days later, Tony stood back to admire his handiwork and savor a steaming cup of French roast. Dummy was wheeling gleefully around the workshop playing with some of the fabric scraps and making little whirr-beeps; Tony should really shoo him over to this dock before Rogers arrived to--
“It’ll be poker,” Natasha said with great conviction.  Tony nodded, acknowledging defeat, and went to help Steve with the dishes now piled in the sink.
Tony held his hands up and took a tiny step back. Bruce’s eyes went wide, horror replacing anger. Bruce turned back to his desk and dropped his face in his hands.
In Tony’s room, Steve maneuvered awkwardly to pull the blankets down and then very gently lowered Tony to the bed.  With careful fingers, Steve unlaced Tony’s shoes, eased them off his feet, and tucked them in the corner.  Then he pulled the blankets up around Tony and went to get ready for bed.  Efficiently, Steve brushed his teeth, washed his face and stripped out of his clothes.  He hovered for a few moments, staring at Tony’s handsome face, savoring this marvelous privilege, before sliding into bed next to Tony and curling up around him like a cat.
“Yeah, yeah.” Pepper shook her head. “I’ll head in to the office, then if . . . you’re sure you don’t need me.”
Tony leaned down to trade hot, open-mouthed kisses that left Steve breathless.  As they kissed, Tony brought one hand up to curl lightly around his throat.  The feeling was surprisingly intense—though gentle, there was something masterful about Tony’s touch there.  Steve whimpered and his body twitched, hips bucking.  When Tony pulled back, Steve started to strain up, wanting to follow, but Tony’s hand at his throat stopped him.  He fell back, bound and helpless, gasping and squirming.
cookbook he’d checked out at the Public Library even though there are tons of free recipes online. Steve smiled more at Sunday brunch than just about any other time.
And maybe it was silly to feel such a thrill at that, at being allowed to do this small thing for his lover, but as Steve worked the soap to a rich lather on his hands and ran them across Tony's shoulders, he felt an aching warmth in the pit of his stomach, radiating out with satisfaction.
Tony shrugged the thoughts away and pulled on a long-sleeve t-shirt. (The AC/DC one that was a little too big and had extra long sleeves.)
Steve fell back into step easily, pivoting as Tony directed. Tony shot him a grin and said, “Here, let me spin you!”
It was hard to believe that she’d been younger than Tony was now when she’d died in the crash. Only thirty-six.
Steve bit his lip and for a second it seemed like he might leave it at that, but then words came spilling forth as if he couldn’t hold them in: “I was just looking at the pictures of us together from last night while the coffee brewed and--oh, you know those events always make me uncomfortable, being surrounded by all the swells and society! And--it’s dumb--just, in the pictures, all this--” he gestured down his body, “it
Tony was working on the armor when Pepper stopped by. Of course, he was still on bed rest and didn’t have any tools, but Rhodey’d taken the armor home and JARVIS was giving Tony the readouts on the damage. It would take a lot of work to get in the air again. (Tony felt almost grateful for that. Now if he could just get out of here . . .)
Now, how to move forward?  And what the fuck was he going to say to Steve?  Because they really couldn’t continue like this.
A pause, then she added still smiling, “Though having it’s always a danger at these things; so boring I’m tempted to stab myself.”
Tony lost track of the minutes slipping by. Finally, Steve said quietly, firmly: “You’re right. It was war. I’m proud I served my country. I’m glad we won. If I had to do it again to defeat Hitler, I wouldn’t do it differently. But I’m still sorry they died. That I killed them. Their deaths are on my conscience—I’m still working on penance.”
Tony caught sight of Steve.  He was standing in the doorway to the garage, deep in conversation with Maria Hill who had a hand on his arm as if holding him in place.  He was frowning.
“Without the armor,” Bruce said in his reasonable voice, “you’re the most vulnerable person on the team.”
.) His eyes flicked down to the arc reactor, then back up to Tony’s face with a hint of a smile.  (And, huh, that’s kind of nice actually.)  So, Captain America was more interested in Iron Man than--
?—to get Steve a dildo for practice?  Should he remind him?  (Yes!  No.  Maybe?  Embarrassing.)  Steve nearly laughed at himself.  It hadn’t even been forty-eight hours, way too soon to think Tony had forgotten.  Besides, Tony had been working on—huh.  Steve wasn’t actually sure what to call it.  Project Sex with Steve?  Project Kinky Sex God? (That actually sounds a bit like Tony.)  The images had been, uh, fascinating.  The intricate rope bondage had been especially striking.  Was Tony planning to tie him up like that?  Soon?  Maybe he’d tie Steve up, cover his whole body in a lattice of rope-work that would leave Steve totally unable to move.  Then Tony’d torment him like he’d threatened.  Tony’d tease him at first, just trailing his fingers lightly over Steve’s hole, until he was gasping.  Then he’d finally press inside with a finger, just one, so gentle.  Tony’d finger Steve like that until Steve’s chest was heaving.  Tony’d just playing with him, not filling him enough, not pressing in hard enough, until Steve would be sobbing and begging Tony to fuck him hard and fast and rough and--
When Tony excused himself to use the bathroom, turning down four offers to ‘escort him’, he took his opportunity to blend back into the crowd.
Steve seemed lost in his thoughts; Tony waited quietly and looked away as Steve passed the back of his hand across his eyes.
Steve wanted Tony so badly it was almost pain.  He couldn’t explain it—it didn’t make sense. (Fuck me, Tony . . . please . . . wanna feel you inside me. . .)  Steve’s chest felt tight and he was grateful Tony had ordered him to breathe. (Not enough . . . need your cock . . .)  He rocked back on Tony’s finger as much as he could without moving his knees from his chest or pulling his restraints from the headboard.  (Keep your hands there . . . Tony put them there . . .)  Steve arched and cried out as Tony crooked his finger inside him again.  (Oh, fuck me!  Take me . . . claim me. . .  make me yours . . . please . . . please, Tony)
“And,” Francesca said softly, “Nona Anna lit a candle for you every Sunday.  Every Sunday without fail, for over forty years.”
“I’m well aware of that,” Carmichael said, her smile never wavering. “Hulk actually tests surprisingly well with certain demographics, when given the right presentation, and your reputation as a scientist is consistently well-received. Of course, the public is still fuzzy on the connection between the scientist Bruce Banner and the Hulk, so we’ll need to control that revelation very carefully. If you choose to remain on the team.”
As Tony headed for the elevator, he held back a frown. They should really decide when—and how—to tell the team they were dating. And soon. Otherwise it would get weird. (Weirder than that just was.)
“And don’t . . .” Tony stammered, suddenly tripping over his words. His heart started speeding. “Don’t . . . don’t try to put me under. It won’t . . . I mean, I still can’t. . . I--”
Cap seemed to hesitate for a moment, then got to his feet. The other Avengers followed suit. (Agents included.)
“Now, I was thinking,” she said brightly, “we could start you on Sam’s whip. Then, I could tie you down and ride you ‘til you scream. How does that sound?”
“He might surprise you,” Bruce said, over the sound of his typing.  “Anyway, just thought I’d mention it.”
, though at least that one could be a typo. Still. Proofread, people!” Tony shook his head again. “Gosh, no wonder you’re having a fit, Cap. Writing instruction really has gone downhill! I mean, we used to have quality tolls on the internet. Grammar and everything!”
“Pepper, honey, don’t,” Tony pleaded. “You’ve got this. You wanted to run a Fortune 500 Company? You did it. You wanna be a mom? You can do that too. With or without a partner.”
“Tony!” she called and he paused a moment despite himself, then hurried away.  As he retreated, he could just hear her add softly, “You can still call me
Steve smashed into one of the robots with his shield and barked, “Chatter!” then added a moment later, “What’s PVP?”
,” Tony insisted again. “Just not in a joining mood. But enjoy lunch. And tell Cap I say ‘hi.’ Now scram.”
So, tonight was special.  Tony wasn’t drunk or hurting and Steve was allowed to hold him.  This was okay.  Because, really, it was Steve’s job to look after Tony.  Steve smiled, but for a moment he felt a certain wistfulness.  Tony was strong and in good shape, but he really couldn’t carry Steve, not like this.  He could probably carry Steve fireman style if he needed to, but he couldn’t cradle Steve to his chest, an arm at his back and his knees.  It would have been nice, but Steve was just too big.  (Well, now, at any rate. . . )
“Have you ever tried making it with cayenne pepper?” Bruce asked Steve, joining them in the kitchen.
The admission caught Tony off guard. It was as close as Tony’d ever heard him come to saying, “everyone I cared for is dead.” (How hard was it to say that out loud?)
Steve shook his head and gave an amused little snort.  “Nope.  Business lunch.  Stark Industries something.  So he’d better not forget to eat!”
“I am profoundly sorry,” Rogers continued. He sounded at once more distressed and more stiffly formal than he had after the whole chair-pulling mess. Tony wracked his brain. (There'd been no chair pulling, no bowing, no--) Rogers went on: “I have the utmost respect for you and your place on the Avengers; I never meant to make you uncomfortable or show disrespect.”
Steve swallowed thickly, then added: “If you’ll let me.” He looked up at Tony, wide blue eyes shining and intense as he whispered, “
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve was murmuring softly, running his fingers through Tony’s hair again. “So amazing.”
p. p.s.  Beta and I sent a bug report about the embedded image descriptions not working; still waiting to hear back.  Hopefully we can make progress on that project soon!
Tony jolted at the sound of Rogers’ voice.  He’d been so lost in thought he’d almost forgotten the Captain was there.
Tony’d nearly hidden in the bathroom for the count-down and ball drop, but he’d luckily found himself in Veronica’s friendly arms again and was the contented recipient of one very chaste New Year’s kiss. (Her quirked lips and raised eyebrow offered more, but she let it go at the very slightest shake of his head.)
“Mmm,” Tony murmured into the cup, then took a long sip. “Yay!” he cried, brain suddenly back online. “Pancakes! Cap’s making us pancakes and it isn’t even Sunday—man, you spoil us.”
“Ooh, there’s Pepper!” Tony said with relief.  “Let’s go say hi. See a friend before we have to make the rounds.”
Steve’s smile widened and he began kissing his way down Tony’s chest. When Steve sucked on his nipples, Tony arched off the bed. Steve held him down with strong hands.
Agent Already Forgot Her Name was still standing there in surprise as Tony slammed the door in her face.
“Let me take you out tonight,” Steve said urgently. He caressed Tony’s cheek with gentle fingers and added more softly, “Please? Please say yes.”
So. Underwear. Nothing too filthy. But nothing too dull either. After a moment he slipped into well-fitted black silk boxer briefs (no lace trim, no nonsense) that showed him to advantage. Tony grinned and gave a little shimmy. His dick was certainly nothing to be ashamed of! Rather larger than one might expect from his build. This tended to please Dommes, but annoyed Doms if they felt outclassed. (Seriously, Tops constantly said that
As Tony rode the elevator, he was mentally gloating. (See, Rhodey? I remember food on my own!) Tony was gonna turn the tables on Rhodes and drag
“You’re perfect,” Steve said roughly, kissing Tony’s neck, his shoulders, his cheek. He seized Tony’s mouth in a kiss that Tony returned desperately and seemed to go on and on until, abruptly, Steve pulled back with a sudden breath.
Tony focused on the data, tuning out the arrival of their SHIELD reinforcements, and all the chatter around them.
“Steve?” Tony said softly.  Steve looked up.  Tony smiled at him and Steve relaxed a little.  He smiled back.
Rogers stared at Tony with a pensive frown for a few moments before looking away.  He was biting his lip again.  He stared down at the table, deep in thought.
“No names yet,” the Captain says smiling. “But I’ll tell you this much: I’m attending the Maria Stark Fundraiser Gala with my sub on Valentine’s day. You’ll find out then.”
Push, pull, push, pull, push—(Shit, shit, careful, don’t choke him!) Tony tightened his fingers in Steve’s hair, then let go.
“Wait, there are new ones?” Steve asked Bruce. “I thought the last movie was made twenty years ago?”
(Was I really his first choice? And the way he shot those orientationist a-holes down! Not that I needed
Also warning for Westborough Baptist Church acting like the Westborough Baptist Church. Also, Fox News acting like Fox News. :(
Tony fumbled his through the dark workshop over to the beat up couch in the corner, beckoning Dummy to follow. Tony flopped down low on the couch so Dummy could rest his claw on Tony’s thigh.
Tony skimmed the lists again.  Clearly anything public was a deal breaker, which was just as well.  It was a good idea to keep Tony’s exhibitionist tendency in check.  Then again, his possessiveness would probably have prevented anything too public anyway.  Steve was Tony’s now.  (Mine!)
“Of course you could,” she agreed, “but then I wouldn’t get to ask if you’ve bothered to look at the year end report yet.”
Overall, dinner wasn’t a disaster.  Barton was easy going and unexpectedly teamed up with Bruce to try and keep the conversation flowing.  They talked about Bruce’s travels in India.  Rogers asked questions and listened attentively. Barton added a few stories of his own, and pulled Romanov in, asking her to remind him how such and such happened, or demanding, “hey, tell Steve about the time. . . ”  Bruce tried to do the same with Tony, but having a more limited knowledge to go on, he had a bit of a hard time.  Tony was scrupulously polite—(proud of me, Pep?)—but far from gregarious.
“Yes, of course!” Steve hastened to arrange one of the luxurious pillows on the floor for Tony as the camera skimmed the majestic mountains of the Mines of Moria.
“Are you sure?” Tony asked. “Come on, Steve. We can watch Trouble with Tribbles again. Just to help us get sleepy. You love that one!”
“You’re a fox,” Tony said, bringing a blush to his cheeks and tilting his head a little more. “We both know I’m getting old.”
“Rhodey!” Tony cried into the voicemail. “Merry Christmas! I know you’re not picking up because you’re busy with your family, but merry Christmas to you and them. Hope you’re having fun! Call me later.”
Marseilles was the same as always—immaculate black and white décor and equally immaculate diners awash with sunlight while the fine china and crystal tinkled all around them.  It sort of made Tony want to knock something over.  Or set off his alarm and let “Back in Black” scream from his Stark phone.
,” Natasha said, and the other Avengers joined in thanking their PR gurus for their excellent coaching and for keeping the top douchebags out of the reporters pool.
“I mean it: let go,” Tony said firmly. Belford angled his body closer. (Ew. Yeah. Belford was already sporting a semi and that thought had become deeply unappealing in the past two minutes.)
Pressing his lips together until they turned white helped him to seal away the hurt little sound that built up in his throat the longer he thought about it. With slightly trembling hands, he snatched up the plain white envelope that was sitting innocuously on the majestic mahogany desk in Steve’s study.
Tony had gone on his stupid date; and came back looking happier and more content than he looked around anyone other than Steve.
Yes, it was a risk. Yes, it was a high price. No, it was not negotiable. Because Peter was worth any risk she could possibly take and there was no price she wasn’t willing to pay to do what her son needed, and if she knew anything about that kid, it was that he’d need the reassurance of a little routine tonight. Neither her nor Steve was at home, and maybe he didn’t know exactly what had happened, but Peter had to know that something was wrong, and Toni just couldn’t let him go to sleep, almost guaranteed to have nightmares, if she could prevent them.
The Trickster God cursed under his breath, but to his credit, he didn’t launch into a rant about their father as he might have a few years ago. It was progress, Thor knew, and progress that he fully intended on being happy about. Just a bit later, maybe.
His temper, she knew from vague and blurry memories, would be taken out on his work and her younger self, but not without the harsh comments that Maria had also always had to deal with.
‘Iron Man’ had made a total of one appearance in all the missions that Steve had undertaken since he got together with Toni, and learned the truth, and she wasn’t even supposed to be near this one on account of the fact that she had been struggling the past few days with the increased blood toxicity from her palladium poisoning, but God, she was here and Steve was terrified of what this was costing her, but he couldn’t help also being so
“Twelve more years,” the redhead grumbled, but hugged back with infinite care. “When that kid leaves, you’ll be fair game.”
Steve knew that the words weren’t meant as any slight against him, and he didn’t take it as such either; Peter had latched onto Toni since she had saved him, and for the longest time, she had been the only one he’d trusted. At the beginning, it had been an interesting bond to watch unfold, mostly because the child had brought out the mother in Toni long before she could admit that he had. It’d taken Fate and a little bit of Howard Stark (though Steve was loathe to credit anything to that abusive sonofabitch that he still wished he could get his fists on) to make Toni realize that Peter was her son just as much as she was now his mother, for all intents and purposes. That had been close to two years ago and if anything, the time had only strengthened the relationship between mother and son.
So, although it rankled him to admit it, Rhodes was probably right. Bucky, too. They’d pulled him out of a situation that he perhaps hadn’t thought all the way through, but the fact remained that they were now starting from scratch. They had no idea how the rubble had formed, or how far buried Toni and the kid were buried, or... or even if they were…
She shushed him gently; rocked him until he calmed down to a miserable sniffle. “I’ve got you, sweet pea, I’m here now, and I’m not going anywhere,” she promised. “Can you do something for me, brave boy?”
But apparently, the defense of Toni’s honor was well in hand with aforementioned little boy, who kinda reminded him a lot of their own son.
Regrettably, her bodyguards seemed to feel differently, and Bucky actually growled. “Do you have a death wish, Barton?” he demanded, but a quick glance slid towards the former assassin showed Toni that he hadn’t drawn a weapon. Progress was progress, after all, she noted with approval.
It had been JARVIS who’d gotten them there, but there was still a definite trail of bodies for them to follow into the bunker.
He found the tube, noticed it looked more like a very large inoculation shot, and spared half a second to pale slightly and swallow back his alarm before running back to Toni. “Alright, Doll, I got you,” he soothed as he pulled her back into his arms. Trembling hands took the tube from him and before he could offer to help, she’d uncapped the thing and stuck it just below her collarbone, depressing whatever was inside it with a pained little gasp.
, I’m right here,” she comforted softly, pressing kisses to his cheek and the top of his head at random intervals. “Of course I came home, I promised you, didn’t I? How could I leave my sweet pea?” She kept up the steady stream of reassurances, not having the heart to address the very real chance that one day, she might not make it back home. The very real chance that she would put herself in the line of fire for the greater good of a world that she wanted her son to feel safe in.
Not for the first time, Toni patted herself on the back for having the foresight to design the Quinjet for both speed and comfort.
Toni swallowed, grateful for the cover and solidity of Rhodey’s strong chest. “’Course,” she confirmed, equally quiet. “I always am. You?”
Steve tensed as Man-Child shrieked the last words and the blade, consequently, dug threateningly deeper. A thin line of warmth tracked down into the collar of his uniform, and Steve couldn’t pretend that it was sweat. For the first time in three days, Tony’s eyes flickered to his, and Steve’s chest seized at the wealth of emotions he saw in them.
Brown eyes fluttered shut with the force of unexpected emotion overcoming her. “It’s okay, honey,” she tried to soothe softly, sensing that the time had passed for any more lighthearted banter. Steve was genuinely hurting; understandably so, Toni could only imagine what the past few hours had been like for him; and she was a bitch sometimes, but Toni would never trivialize that. “It’s alright. We’ll figure this out, it’s just like any other retrieval op.”
His best friend fixed him with a fierce look. “Get it together, punk!” he snapped out in a drill sergeant type voice that forced Steve to listen. “You wouldn’t have been any good to us buried underneath that too, you wouldn’t have been able to help Toni that way! Use your goddamn head!”
“Mommy, don’t go,” Peter hiccupped, and if not for the lump in her throat, Toni might have worried that she’d spoken out loud. Little arms wrapped around her neck with a strength that was at odds with Peter’s tiny frame. “I knew you were gonna come get me. Please don’t go.”
They were joined by Bruce, who was already wielding information dug up on his tablet. “We don’t actually have any way to predict when the next aftershock will hit, and how powerful it will be,” the doctor wasted no time in relaying to them, grim-faced. “We have neither the equipment nor the tech, and even JARVIS’ estimates would be rough, at best.”
“JARVIS, please,” he gasped out, stomach rolling as though he were about to be sick, “where is she? Where’s Toni? Where’s Peter?”
Bucky took up his place on her other side while Bruce hovered behind her, and it felt ridiculously like she was being herded into the elevator. It made uneasiness prickle underneath her skin, and absently, Toni wondered how long it was going to take before she went berserk with all the careful treatment. She’d never done very well as a patient, and handled persistent protectiveness with even less grace.
Coulson used his grip on her elbow to steer her away, further from her father and the demons in her mind. “HYDRA tried to time travel, is the short of it,” he answered dryly, and there was no mistaking the derision in his tone. Toni almost smiled at how irreverent the man could sound about people traveling to and from the past.
The former wasn’t a surprise to anyone – he and Steve were brothers of the best kind; brothers chosen; brothers who’d seen through variations of the same war only to find their way back to being best friends again – but the latter was still sometimes met with some disbelief. Understandably so. The only one who seemed to shrug it off as something normal was Steve himself, citing that Bucky had always been a protective mother hen and that Toni tended to inspire that kind of response in anyone who met her and knew how little she cared about her own safety.
It was three in the morning. Tony was in the workshop, staring blankly at glowing blue projections of poly-aramid ratios and tensile strengths, a tall glass of scotch clutched in his right hand. (It was a rule—he could bring a glass down to the shop, but not a bottle. He’d never broken that rule. Yet.) He took a sip. (He had some very large glasses.)
“I assure you I have,” Steve said sharply.  Though it was Dominick who had spoken, Steve turned his gaze to Fury as he added with a bit of an edge, “I have considered it very carefully.  We all have. And I believe we’re committed to this course of action.  If that will be all?”
Tony swallowed roughly.  (I believe the term you’re looking for is ‘emotionally manipulative.’).   But Tony didn't say it out loud.  (Unhealthy orientational dynamics 101, ladies and gentlemen!)
“Oh really?” Tony said softly. He inched closer and Steve could feel the heat of his body. Tony looked up through his lashes and stroked his fingers lightly across Steve’s shoulder and down his arm, then stopped.
Come to think of it, Tony hadn’t spent much time with Steve lately; if fact, he hadn’t so much as seen him outside of training in days, not even working at the dinning room table as usual. (Huh.) Tony frowned. Steve wouldn’t avoid him because of that ridiculous tabloid, would he? Even if Steve were worried about their image, that surely wouldn’t affect his behavior in the Tower and it’s not like he would blame Tony for the tabloid, right? (Right. The idea was ridiculous.)
’s what drove you onto the balcony in December?!?”—but not now. Now, he was half afraid to breathe lest Steve get spooked and go silent.
Tony paused next to the table and made no move to take a seat. Steve, who had been on the verge of sitting, shot him an uncertain look and straightened. Tony smiled at him.
Tony was feeling more and more like Sisyphus.   But Sisyphus with a deadline—they’d be leaving for his ranch soon and would need time for manufacturing before they could go.
“You’re the bravest person I know,” Pepper told him in a gentle murmur. Tony pressed his face closer to her stomach and closed his eyes. He didn’t answer—he didn’t have to when they were like this.
Ten minutes later, he ambled into the kitchen, mostly clean and mostly awake. (What, who could bother to wash their hair before coffee?  Especially after a post-gala Star Trek binge with the team...)
Tony set his tray on the coffee table and flopped down in the middle of the couch. Bruce was giving them a kind of funny look. (Sheesh—we know about sewing machines. Not like it’s thermo-nuclear-astrophysics.)
Steve let out a relieved little breath as subtly as possible, but knew it wouldn't escape her attention. She poured them both tea. (Such beautiful hands . . . Maybe she'd let me sketch them sometime?)
“If you think I’m going to try and out vodka a Russian, you’ve got another thing comin’,” Clint called.
Tony looked at the steaming plate and said, a little bemused, “You really are all about feeding people, aren’t you, Cap?  What’s with that anyway?”
But he wanted to obey Steve more than he wanted anything else. And at least Steve hadn’t said anything about being quiet.
Tony gently tipped the cup to Steve’s lips for him.  The cords at his wrists were a tight embrace, his shoulders suffused with a soft ache; Steve felt helpless and dependent and wonderful.  He drank deep, surprised to find that, yes, he was quite thirsty in fact.
Tony shrugged, then turned to grin at Pepper over his shoulder, saying, “But if they don’t like it—“
Tony let out a low whistle.  “Impressive.  I can alter the gym if you want though.  We could expand into the floor above it maybe.”
“Oh, please,” Tony said, “you can wheel and deal them with your hands tied behind your back. Besides, I bet that you’ve had your pitch and negotiations ready for days and, even if not, Samia’s a boss and can help finish up the prep. And you can practice delegating.”
