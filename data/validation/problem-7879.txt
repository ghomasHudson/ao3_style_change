,” Clint didn’t bother ducking the four pillows thrown at him, grinning through the assault. “Iron can be interpreted as a lot of things.
want to hear were said, and it was all thanks to one Clint Barton. Naturally.
When he said it like that it did sound ridiculous, but Steve had no right to frown. What else was Tony supposed to think of the situation?
Tony waved away the concern, not daring to see the well executed act. “Just need to get the feeling back on my legs.” He tried to plant his feet under him but they bent awkwardly and uncomfortably at his ankles when he put pressure down. He couldn’t feel anything from the numbness but he knew there was supposed to be pain flaring up his leg.
well. You look just as luscious as you had once been in your youth all those years ago. To think
“In case you're thinking something else, they were teasing you playfully,” Bruce explained sometime after their calm walking in a hushed tone.
Going feral didn’t make Steve crave anything. It didn’t make him violent or make him have some insatiable appetite for blood. He didn’t seek power nor did he want to unleash violence on the innocent. Going feral opened his eyes to what an alpha is capable of. What
“We want your body.”
Steve ran a hand over his own cheek and chin. “Am I? Can't think of a reason why I'm glowing. No, actually, I think I can.”
“You always do say the sweetest words.”
He looked to the others. They were still circling Peggy and greeting her with smiles. Bucky especially had her in a hug as they re-marked each other. Further behind them, in the now empty table they had previously occupied sat Rhodey and Bruce, watching their pack-mates fondly. Jarvis was rooted on Rhodey’s shoulder and Vision happily swayed back and forth on the table’s surface, watching their pack. They did not personally know who Peggy was, but if their pack were happy to see her than they were happy for them, too. They would meet the new shifter when the others were ready to introduce them.
The beta hissed in pain, “You little -” and kicked Vision with his other foot, causing the little machine to whine in pain.
An eyebrow rose high. “What for?”
“You two appeared close, though. You chased after her.”
They all eventually passed out, sleeping in odd angles and areas where they shouldn’t have gotten up to. Steve woke up with Tony still in his arms. It was still nice.
“I can’t give him a family,” he covered his eyes, “he’s given me so much, cares for me, loves me, and yet I can’t give him what he wants.”
“I don’t smell anything. It’s all in your head.”
The moment footsteps were heard descending the stairs everyone turned to look at them and simultaneously, except for Bruce, Natasha and Steve, everyone either whistled or gave a bombastic comment.
“Just a couple of more steps. Almost there. Got to find the perfect spot for you to see it all. Here, this will do. All right, now stand here - a little more to the left, and - ready. You can open your eyes now.”
The camera pans the room as the agent moves closer to the wall. Slowly and carefully, revealing the exact state they were all in. Blood painted the walls. The bodies Steve had thrown after taking their lives were twisted in unnatural angles. Broken and red. All of their throats torn and mauled from Steve’s very jaws.
“If you ever want to try your hand with literature I think you can make it. I’ll buy all your work.”
Tony’s breath hitched and his heart skipped a beat.
“I’m heading over to the tents.” The area where the emergency kits and workers were located. “Hopefully Hank will notice my new ribbon.”
him time and
Steve rode him in a manner he had never seen. The heat he engulfed Tony with left and came back and the friction his skin created build up in Tony’s very core. Sensations blended together and all Tony could do was hold on to his alpha’s biceps as his nerves burned from all the pleasure. He held on with all his might, even as his ears filled with nothing but the sounds of their groaning and the wood of the bed creaking. Every inch of his body pulsed and he couldn’t tell where he ended or Steve began.
Tony nodded and made sure his face showed no signs of anger. He honestly didn’t mind. Peter wasn’t a heavy child. In fact, he was lighter than most.
“Are those two…?”
“You're so beautiful,” Steve whispered on his skin. He felt the very impressive girth of Steve’s erection against the small of his back, heavy and hot and twitching. “You're always beautiful, but to have you like this - to
was an idea. They wanted him to recreate his gauntlets. They wanted weapons. Tony could create simple weapons easily, but it wouldn't be enough to escape. Maybe if he were to experiment. To try and improve the gauntlets further. Something could
Tony, not having a single clue to what was happening and feeling exhausted from everything occurring, asked himself the all important question,
Small angst in the beginning, hope in the middle, more angst in the end.
And from the way Pepper’s eyes widened he knew she realized her mistake. He hadn’t told them anything about his name and now it was going to all fall apart.
“I… I just said that out loud, didn’t I?” Steve’s lips curled upward awkwardly, eyes puffy and red and a sob escaped him. “This isn’t exactly how I wanted to tell you.”
” at his ear.
“That hurts, Brucie-bear. That hurts me right here,” Tony pointed at his chest.
He looked incredible, truly he did, he just didn’t bring out the entire potential.
The cockatoo faced away innocently, as if the very thought never crossed his mind. Tony knew better.
He gasped when Steve sucked on the soft skin. His hands grabbed at the blankets for a hold. The sensitive skin made him thrive in pleasure from the touches. His mind going crazy from so much. “
Hulk followed her movement and besides lowering his head to sniff her he made no move to react violently. “Tiny Banner mate.”
“I am impressed,” Loki admitted with a nod of his head. “I did not know our captain was capable of such a feat. Surely Anthony was left without want.”
“Why what?” Steve trailed his fingers through Tony’s mop of hair, strands sticking everywhere no doubt.
The Captain continued on. Their steps became nonexistent against the grass and stones and dead leaves as if they weren’t even present. When they reached a point in the forest where danger had become true Steve pulled his shield forward and stopped. That was the cue everyone needed to pull their choice of weapon as well. Both Natasha and Bucky moved in perfect sync to the Captain with Natasha choosing her gun over the two batons attached to her back and Bucky holding his long-barreled firearm meant to snipe targets without being seen carefully.
“Oh, you want to be on top, do you?” That smirk grew bigger. Eyes full of mischief. “All you had to do was say so, Sweetheart.”
Tony did. He followed his instincts blindly, thrusting clumsily and doing what he could to mimic what he recalled his mate would always do. He didn’t know if he was even doing the simple act of rutting right, and the feeling of shame at his performance was slowly creeping its way in, but Steve easily soothed those insecurities away by the sounds he released. Then, as if Steve had snapped and released the last bit of control he held onto, he took complete control and Tony’s actions became meaningless.
Surely the serpent was angry now from being disturbed. What had Tony been thinking coming to him? “I - I shouldn’t have bothered you. I’m sorry, I’ll go -”
“Jarvis?” he whispered, facing the roof of the shack and unable to see if the umbrella cockatoo was still awake or not.
you like this. There's no way to put it in words. You're so wonderful.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam still had his hand on his shoulder and Tony felt a loss when he removed it. “How do you feel?”
The hand Hammer held on the back of Tony’s neck squeezed. It caused Tony to shiver coldly. Hammer’s thumb was right over Steve’s bite mark. It wasn’t a good feeling. Especially not when that thumb was digging in. It made Tony hiss.
Sam elbowed his mate, huffing in annoyance. “You don’t have a single romantic bone in your body.”
Tony suspected it had been his pre-heat. The nights before it had set in, Steve had been near insatiable. Stating Tony’s smell was different. Sweeter. Signs of change and what they’d later on realize was a heat coming upon them. Steve took him when he could without precautions, neither knowing what would happen a few nights later.
All thoughts seized in his head. No, no, this was all Rhodey doing his little white lies in order to help his confidence. There was no possible way Tony smelled anything but foul. Hammer hadn’t been the only one to comment on his stench. The entire pack gave their own commentary of it, feeling it required for Tony to know personally.
“I didn’t say anything about a no,” Bucky quickly said, glaring slightly at the agents.
“Yeah, guess I did.”
Hope this put a smile on your face and may your day go great!
“Yeah, Peter wants to see the winner.”
The only lion in the pack released a rumble from deep within his chest before proclaiming, very loudly, “None shall out-hunt the mighty Thor!” and jumped after the two betas, creating the massive wave of water again.
Maybe he was overthinking it. Hammer often searched for a night with someone new and younger and often female when he got tired of Tony, but he always had Tony return after he pushed away his temporary replacement. Tony couldn’t imagine Steve doing exactly the same as Hammer by using and then discarding. If Steve’s attention was ever caught by someone else, Steve would never ask for one night. He would make the effort, court the shifter and eventually ask them to join the relationship.
“What if temporarily doesn’t happen?” he said with the smallest hint of fear for him.
He looked to his pack. “Did you know?”
“You would not dare.”
Shifter, but in fact was a
care,” the entire pack made a small movement (a flicker of their ears, a swish of their tail, a tongue flicking, a paw twitching and Bruce, who was now present, rubbing his hands nervously) to emphasize who she meant. “Tony has been with us for months. He’s
Tony held his breath but Steve continued to hesitate.
Rhodey bared his teeth for a second. “Why do you want to know?”
“I scouted ahead,” Clint piped up. “They’re hiding up in this old fort with around thirty feet of open terrain before the forest starts. The fort is large and unbalanced. If we take down at least two pillars the whole thing should fall apart on them. Chain reaction.”
“Only took me two decades” The alpha mumbled to himself but clearly held no qualms with Tony hearing it. “I want to have you in another way. I want you to have
Tony felt his heart sink. He had enough coin to get a new set of clothing. If he managed it correctly perhaps even two sets. Anything else he couldn’t afford it. Not yet until he managed to find a way to earn coin for himself. No matter how tempting the glazed bread was he couldn’t do it. “They sound great, but maybe not today,” he pride himself for managing to keep his disappointment from leaking in his voice.
As expected Clint threw the armor in his arms on the bed and slapped his hands over his hears in a failed attempt at stopping the words.“No! Don’t want to hear it. Can’t hear anything. La la not a word.” He fled out the room soon after, slamming the door and singing in a sharp note all the way down the hall. Easily heard through the walls.
Panic set in. Tony
Tony ignored them, desperate to stop the fighting. Steve had Rhodey in his jaws, shaking and nearly tearing at the scruff. Bucky had the front of his neck, keeping him still and suffocating him.
Tony panicked a little. “Steve? Is this… is this a good reaction?” The pregnancy was unexpected, yes, and perhaps the news of twins hadn’t set in for Tony yet, but he didn’t think the news was this shocking… was it?
“All of us,” Pepper included.
The sudden change in diet had his stomach screaming in protest. Now that he was with child the sensation felt as if it had doubled overnight. As if that wasn’t enough, his sleep was also miserable. How could one sleep comfortably under the blanket of safety when their abductors were mere feet away? Not Tony, and it only added to his anxiety that could prove fatal to his child.
He reached out for Jan’s hand, fingers shaking towards the vial, but instead of grabbing it he closed Jan’s hand over it, hiding it from view. His vision blurred ever slightly as small tears he tried his hardest to hold back formed. This was a start. His pitiful recret. “I won’t need it,” he said with a bittersweet smile. “I don’t - don’t get heats. Haven’t… for the longest time.”
, Tony realized he was struggling to explain. One didn't openly express, not in his case, unless it involved heated scenes where he had to convince Hammer he was enjoying it.
In an act of defiance Tony refused to shy away from it. The Avengers were one thing, but this was Bruce. He had confidence with Bruce. “The best. He makes the perfect blanket.”
Natasha was now standing besides Bruce, blocking him from view from the locals. “Would you care for company, Звездный свет?”
The three blinked. Pepper was the one to say “You… want his hand in marriage?”
The jet had landed near the edge of a marked location with tents and SHIELD agents walking around. From the air both Steve and Bucky managed to see the the collapsion of dirt that created a giant circle in the center. An agent came to fetch them and they were led right to this collapsion that had a opening to it. On closer inspection they found the dirt surrounding this opening were stuck together by some sort of material that, when touched, gave a chill down to their bones. The dirt was frozen and Steve could have sworn that, if it wasn’t for the serum in his body and Bucky touching the dirt with his metal arm, they would have gotten frostbite from touching it with their bare skin.
Tony grinned. “If anyone had a chance between all of us it would be the big guy. You can’t blame me for going with him for protection.”
“Why not? Pretty sure you’re more than qualified to fight the biggest dangers around. You can take on Hydra packs on your own.”
As Bruce asked questions about the cockatoo and the machine, and Tony answered as much as he could without revealing his involvement with the rune on Vision, he looked back to the moment the two first came into his life. They were fond memories Tony was never going to forget. They were on the top of his list of good things to ever happen to him.
“I’ll go order us something. You go ahead and sit with the others,” Steve said, gesturing to the bartender. “Stay close.”
“Very well. Have I divulged the story of Loki and I’s encounter with the mighty -”
He left expecting the end of his days, but death hadn’t come for him. Instead, his home had found him.
In this case, Steve, leader of the Avengers pack, was offering fish to Tony while shifted. Offering what was basically a meal and sharing with Tony, sharing with… ‘mate.’ Tony’s brain might have stopped for a full minute, possibly longer, and no one could blame him for it. This was Steve doing the act.
Tony hushed and soothed the little machine, ignoring his own discomfort in his now wet clothing. Jarvis whistled in concern and landed on Tony’s shoulder, helping with the soothing. Thor, Clint and Sam stood nearby with their heads low, no doubt feeling responsible for what had happened.
to, making his life unnecessarily difficult, it was only right to get as close to any available trade as possible. Have the option of cooked meals and fresh clothes and work for if coin was needed for anything.
Jan sighed in relief. “Finally over.”
The others must have seen it, too, must have always been able to tell from Loki’s eyes the truth behind his words. None of them took his attempted exasperation to heart, not even Bruce. But they did agree to return back to their home. Just standing in the middle of the road unarmed was a very bad idea so they walked back to the mansion together. Steve still flanking him and now their entire pack creating a circle around them.
“They never said anything about looking for new pack mates! I don’t even recognize those two.”
“Spoken as a true fool.”
“Mommy, why are omegas with the Avengers?”
Shortly after returning back to the shacks with their game and wrapping his wrist, they went to the common area and claimed a table and a fire pit for themselves to cook the rabbits. Bruce took the job of skinning the rabbits while Tony went to collect dried branches, promising to only use his good hand. He came back with a fair gathering of wood tucked under his injured-free arm. Jarvis was on his shoulder with small sticks in his beak, and Vision rolling next to his feet with a strap from a bag wrapped around his little spot of ‘neck’ and pulling additional branches.
Somewhere in the town, the sound of a pin dropping echoes, reaching to their room. Everyone respectfully kept quiet except for Vision, who made a long drawn out note. With no response coming to mind to what was stated all Tony could do was pull the outspoken cockatoo into a much-needed hug. Both as an apology and to reassure himself. Vision joined the hug seconds after, feeling forgotten.
“So we’re just going to be straight. We want you.”
Tony drooped his ears slightly. “Trust me, after today it’s never going to happen.”
“If he's going then I am too,” was all the omega said. His hands clasped together and one of his thumbs rubbing over the surface of the other being the only sign of hesitation. That hesitation Tony was sure had everyone in the room focused on it. He was ready to hear their leader say ‘absolutely not’ to him, to order him put and prevent the sense of obligation the omega obviously felt lead him to contribute to a situation he was clearly uncomfortable doing, but then Natasha walked forward and the entire pack stopped, holding their breath.
A hand on his own silenced the alpha. Tony gripped it tightly. Both in comfort and in desperation. He couldn’t bear hearing it. “Steve, it’s fine.”
And from the way Bruce was also staring at her he figured the other omega was having similar thoughts as well, or at least something along the lines.
, “that you and your pack want me to join, but let’s be honest here, what will I contribute to your pack?” Tony tried his hand at a smile but it came out brittled. “I don’t know much about fighting. I’ll just end up holding your pack back.”
Jarvis tilted his head in response, staring at him sideways. He clearly didn’t know where this statement came from but he wasn’t about to argue back until all the information was given. “I fail to see how.”
He thought maybe a bath would help him feel better, to get rid of the filth traveling had given him. If anything it made it worse.
“What’s gotten into you? I can practically smell you pacing from down the hall,” Rhodey had said the day before their pack had planned to head out for their contract. He caught Tony doing exactly what he had stated. Tony was pacing inside his and Steve’s room (their room… something he struggled to believe sometimes) while Steve and the others who were to join in the trip were planning their tactic downstairs.
As they got closer his excitement grew with every step. Eventually buildings began forming in the distance and Tony stared in awe at the sight that was the town of Hattan. Homes that were made of wood and stone followed the road, starting at the border of the town and increasing in numbers the further they went in. The buildings grew taller and closer, stacking upwards towards the center.
Hammer.”
Tony imagined it. Very vividly. No hesitation and no shame as he rode Steve, going as deep as he could without pain. How would his hips move? Would he circle them briefly before he continued bouncing in place? Would he last long or tire out easily after a couple of minutes? Would Steve touch him as he did so or keep his hands to himself? Letting himself be used until Tony’s heart was content?
“Steve is -
All this work they were doing just to get a laugh at Tony’s expense. Maybe he should just let them play it out and get it out of their system. It would get them back home faster and out doing important things like taking down more Hydra packs. The cruelty wouldn’t be any different from what Hammer had always done, and on the bright side it would only be once and then he’d never see the Avengers again. He had experienced worst humiliation. He could handle whatever the Avengers had planned for him.
“I’ll play with him. We’ll play tag. Hide and seek.”
“Steve!” Tony managed as Steve buried his face against his neck and mouthed at his bite mark. The alpha’s erection was pressed on the inside of his thigh, far too close to where he wanted it and far too early for the mixture to take effect. “Wait, Stee-
While Tony would’ve loved nothing more than to already embrace being part of the pile, being surrounded by pack members covering every space and sharing warmth, he understood the Avengers weren’t used to him or Bruce yet and didn’t want to get crowded. He would just have to be patient and maybe one day he’ll receive the physical comfort a complete pack brought. In the meantime he was happy to receive it from another source.
Tears began building but that only seemed to pleased them. “Yer even more beautiful crying. Cry for us, omega.”
“How can you tell?” This wasn’t exactly the most encouraging reaction.
By the time the carriage finally stopped in their destination Tony was almost at his wit’s end. He hardly protested when Hammer dragged him out of the carriage and led him away from the unused road and in through the trees. A forest stretching as far as the eye could see. Hammer and Stane had chosen the area well. Not many travelers used the unofficial road and no doubt less knew of its existence. If one were to hide from the Avengers, this would be the place.
He forced himself to open them again. He needed to see. He couldn’t hide. Not from Stane. Not from Hammer. He couldn’t anymore.
Tony looked away. They were friends, he told himself. Steve wouldn’t allow just anyone near him, let alone kiss him out of the blue. They were a very friendly friend. Different culture, he hoped. Coming from a place where they greeted each other with friendly kisses. Yes, that had to be it. Just friends.
“Do you think it wise, Sir?” Jarvis asked from his spot on Tony’s shoulder as he twitched his head back and forth from Tony to the omega sitting down on one of the many tables decorating the common area.
“My betas will bring you the materials. I suggest you start working immediately, or your bastard might not make it past the week. Don’t disappoint me, Omega. You don’t want to disappoint me.” With one last smirk, Hammer left the room, leaving Tony alone to his thoughts and fears.
“And?” Jan encouraged, “did you find some work for yourself?”
Tony felt his heart stop for a second, and from the way he felt Bruce tense up he knew Bruce had a similar reaction. Jan didn’t appear to mean all her questioning, but even playing around she had hit way too close to home with the last question.
“I’ll try to remember that.”
“Jarvis?” The sight of his feathery little menace sitting close to a strange bird was uncommon. Jarvis hardly gave his time to the wild birds of the area. The intellect he carried made it difficult to socialize with wild birds keened on survival and seeing many species as dangers, including Jarvis himself.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of his situation. Here he was. At the start of his heat with Steve sitting on top of him and holding a conversation together about trust and poetry and trying something new. All the while his body was begging for touch to settle this burn. He never imagined a heat would go in this fashion. “If you want to try this… we’ll try it. Just do something already.
The reason why he couldn’t give Steve a family. His body had given up long ago.
Tony blinked. The praise and affection making his chest flutter and a tingling to go up his spine. “Perfect?” Him? Could he?
Tony found himself a little…
“And Loki.”
He dared to look at Steve once his laughter settled down to something reasonable and found the alpha half-covered by the blue coat and happily staring back at him, overjoyed for some reason and wagging his tail.
“Someone’s hungry.”
By this point Tony was tired of constantly trying to say ‘you don’t have to,’ so instead he just nodded. Agreeing was faster than arguing and this way at least it would get them to their shack sooner.
Some minutes passed and even though Tony felt exhausted he found sleep eluded him, his mind returning back to the invitation and the thought of joining the Avengers making him feel both excited, nervous and terrified.
The Avengers were clad in armor, backs straight, face stoic and postures screaming danger as they marched with purpose. The great Captain leading the pace with his faithful second-in-command, Winter, and third, the Widow, right behind him, creating a barrier and looking every bit as intimidating as the Captain’s most trusted would appear.
Sneaky alpha. It seemed Tony was going to indulge him after all. It was only right that Tony returned the coat, even if he didn’t have a proper answer to Steve’s question.
he cared, showed love in his own way, but maybe that was just Tony neglecting to see what was occurring right before him. As he often had done before, and will most likely do again -
So focused on trying to imagine ways to start on that he never noticed three figures stalking along behind him, getting closer and closer by the second. He didn't even hear anything until a very high pitched sound rang near his ear and sent him jumping up on his feet in fright. Vision, who didn't look any bit apologetic for what he had done, circled around and whistled in success.
The more he walked the more he thought perhaps he missed the building entirely. He went down the right direction and even kept an eye out for the smoke Mrs Par - Mrs
Tony was scandalized at the unflattering sight. “I was not!”
“Hush you. I’m still rational.”
Steve began making his way to the stairs, most likely going to put his armor away for their run, and stopped right as he was about to take the first step up. “No, except… were any of you aware about the name Iron Man?”
was fine. It was Vision that just had an experience. The only reason to be concerned over Tony was needing newly dried wrappings for his sprained wrist now. Also for his wet and cold clothing that he needed to take off if he wanted to avoid getting sick. Something that wasn’t recommended when going pack-less and living in the shacks.
the smile on the cockatoos face.
He almost felt like crying from the frustration. Soon the Avengers would grow tired of him and his internally conflicting nature and Steve would boot him out of the pack because he could neither satisfy nor benefit them, or him. And just like before he’d end up packless again and living in the shacks alone with Jarvis and Vision because, while they would happily kick him out, they’d keep Bruce thanks to Natasha’s insistence. Maybe to save the cockatoo and little machine from suffering for their owner’s incompetence Tony should ask Bruce if he would take them in. They already liked the other omega, and unlike Tony, Bruce would still have a pack.
Before Steve could add in or reject Pepper piped up. “If it’s all the same to you I can remain here and keep an eye on the place. I feel I’ll be nothing but a burden right now. Maybe after a few more days of training with Natasha, and my aim becomes steady.” Pepper looked worried when she said this, as if expecting them to be disappointed.
Just like that, Steve didn’t need a friend brought by the holidays. He’d gone and finally made his own. Thus, he no longer needed to write a letter. He didn’t seem to believe in Santa anymore, either.
“Steve,” the beta purred. “So what brings you and your pack around the area? Are you here to recruit by any chance? Because I happen to know all the talent available,” he leaned a bit so only Steve could hear but didn’t exactly do a great job lowering his voice. “I also happen to be all the talent available.”
Steve was at a distance and facing his direction. He looked on expectantly when he stopped, waiting for Tony to respond, for him to make the first move. The excitement doubled and Tony couldn’t wait any longer. This was it. This was the moon run and Steve wanted to chase him first out of all their pack mates. For one tense moment Tony didn’t move a muscle, watching Steve intently. He needed to make this chase worthwhile, needed to give the alpha a good run.
“No.”
Bruce, thankfully, didn’t give such a reaction. A month together had given him the edge of what to expect with Tony, considering he was going through the same thing. A few rabbits were hardly a proper meal. Eventually it would catch up to them and their bodies would decide it was done being given scraps and demanded proper sustenance. It was only Tony’s luck that his body decided to do so while hanging out with the Avengers.
Rushing a bit in order to avoid any curious gazes Tony retraced his steps from the few times the pack made a trip to Hattan and headed for May’s corner. He had no idea where the blacksmith was located exactly but he was hoping Mrs Parker did and could lead him to the right direction. When Mrs Parker’s building came into view he sighed in relief from spotting the lovely omega up and about and already placing sweets behind her windows for show. Even the child, Scott, was up and running back and forth helping her. She saw him before he managed to say hi and waved him over. Tony took notice of how her eyes ran down his body thanks to Jan’s outfit, widening slightly. She then gave a bright smile meant just for him.
On the end table next to the bed stood a bowl with different bottles of oil and rags. From the door, he could smell the lingering pheromones of the previous guest. The blanket smelled cleaner than the walls, letting him know at least the owner took importance to cleanse more than just the smells. Not ready to lay on the bed yet he made his way over to the corner of the room and curled up. He had a moment to breathe and calm down before his cycle took over. He planned to use every second of it.
Thor released a loud rumble. “Our leader does not fare well in sharing the affections of his proposed mate.”
Hammer cursed. “That thing is going to bring down the whole damn town at this rate. All of you, take aim! Shoot the damn rat down!”
,” Bucky bemoaned, throwing his head back.
. You denied me a family for so long, Omega, and now look at you. Pregnant by a runt. How the Starks have fallen. Your father would be ashamed. Your godfather certainly is.”
Deep in Tony’s mind, the thought of Steve and the others abandoning him came bursting through all sense and logic.
Tony groaned, hoping it expressed everything he had felt and was currently feeling. His heart had calmed down and he felt loose and sated. He didn’t believe himself capable of moving even if he wanted to.
Tony grinned and sat across from him, picking up Vision after an irritating beep and placing him on the table’s surface. “Keep telling yourself that, Brucie. You won’t even give us a chance.”
Hammer never threw Tony away. He just took a break from him.
,” the alpha, the pack
“Don’t tell him that, Steve!”
One last, final, look and he turned away to escape the little area that had become his temporary home. It had taken him weeks to finally finish, but every second had been worth it. Ben had been truly understanding about his reasoning. Now that his projects were over he was ready to get back to work and earn coin instead of spending them.
It took a moment for Tony to figure out the only person left that could’ve been the fox was Natasha, but when he actually pieced it together the only thing that came to mind was,
“More like a curse. Want to trade? You’ll be safer with the other guy than constantly getting hurt.”
Steve licked his own snout and stared at him intently. Tony began fidgeting under the gaze and was about to make an off comment when Steve leaned in and licked the top of his hand holding the peach. It was an affectionate gesture that bordered on acceptance. What Steve was accepting Tony didn’t know but he sure as hell wasn’t prepared for when Steve decided to pump his head against his arm and pushed to snuggle under it. He paused and waited for Tony’s response, hope swirling in his eyes, and while Tony hesitated he still felt the warmth that came from having someone so close and willingly cuddle up with him.
“I’m not. I’m… curious. More than anything. I never really thought about this before.”
Tony didn’t bother to see Bruce’s reaction. Usually, the only expression received when someone explains a poor shifter with the misfortune of
He reluctantly took a sip of the broth. He’d imagine it tasted delicious, but it only tasted of ash in his mouth. He stomached four more sips to appease Rhodey before pushing the bowl away and turning his attention back to the door. He only managed a glimpse of it through the crowd of packmates.
He scanned the area. This was to be his room. The lower level of the fort. Meaning if he was going to try and escape, he would need to go through Hammer’s entire pack. He wouldn’t be surprised if Hammer ordered betas to guard every corner of the fort. Inside and out. In the fort and in the forest.
Loki released a hiss for good measure.
He really hoped the pain was at least bearable.
“What I can say,” Steve continued, “is even from the beginning, I’ve wanted you. From the moment I saw you, I just knew.  It’s not an effort for me, it’s commitment.” The alpha leaned in to kiss his forehead. “You smell of home, of belonging. I don’t think I could’ve stayed away from you for long if you had said no to joining us from the start. Besides -” Steve gave a small huff of laughter, causing strands of Tony’s hair to dance, “I did make a promise to myself when I was younger, and I plan to keep it.”
For a moment Tony feared for Jan. To freely speak about her and Hank’s needs and ask the pack to trade in their planned day in order to get them back safely home, he almost couldn’t believe it. If Tony had so much as breathed a discomfort that directly affected Hammer’s day the alpha would have berated him and put him down for it. But none of the Avengers did so. No, not a single one looked ready to lash out and scold Jan for ruining the day.
“You happen to have a pan of sorts to cook fish?” he asked Bruce.
“What’s wrong?”
Aww yeah, Steve's side.
The attacker, a stubby looking alpha with a putrid smell and unshaven face, growled, swatted at Jarvis and pinned Tony’s arms over his head. “Little omega, I caught ya fair and square. No more games.” The horrid alpha then leaned in to smell Tony’s neck. Tony moved as far away as he was able to, but it didn’t do any good. “Look at ya, I haven’t seen yer face around. Think I’d remember such a pretty little thing like ya with that ass ya carry on ya. Oh, I’m gonna enjoy this.”
They were all shocked to find a large, canine-like creature stand above them on two legs, hunched slightly and with his giant claws hanging by his sides. A large snout carried with it sharp fangs each about the size of individual fingers and diamond, yellow eyes stared into their souls.
“No,” Tony quickly said, wincing at how loud the word was. “No, you don’t have to. Really.”
Praised. He was being
trying to stake a claim Rhodey, Pepper and Happy were slowly getting to know the Avengers.
“Oh we’re going to have a lot of fun. Final answer?”
“No clue,” Bruce answered.
him?”
Tony twisted his neck to see who was responsible for calling his mate. From the door walked in a tall, gorgeous, brunette shifter. She radiated confidence and pure alpha. Eyes so brown and lips so red it almost seemed lethal upon just sight. Beautifully lethal. Tony watched as the brunette alpha was joined by another gorgeous, female shifter with long, blonde hair and equally powerful brown eyes. The pair walked with purpose toward Steve. As if long-known acquaintances. Didn’t even bat an eye at the fact they were fast approaching a dangerous alpha of another pack.
“Many of our pack would be the first to tell you no one deserves anyone, since we are all individuals and not prices to be won,” Steve reached for his chin and pulled him back to meet eye to eye. “I would ask the same of you, since the road to get to you was a pretty long one and I didn’t have the faintest idea of where to look to find it, but here we are and I’m not letting go.”
“Why do you need a rod?” the dirty-golden jackal said through soft barks and snarls. “It'd be easier to just hunt them down than waiting.”
“When we all found you weren't home and none of us could find you I was so scared. You didn't mention anything to anyone of where you were going that I thought for sure you left us, left the pack, and I couldn't figure out why. Did we do wrong by you? Did one of us say something to make you leave?”
knowing he wasn’t the only one wearing night clothing. He didn’t have to explain or make up an excuse.
“That’s right. Steve. That’s me. You’re
Tony wasn’t as fast on his paws. His muscles seemed to have grown weak simply from resting. His cycle taking a greater toll on his body than he thought. He managed to stay upright on wobbly legs with his tail remaining tucked firmly between his hind legs. One paw after another he got himself walking. In the minutes it took for him to reach this step his pack had gotten to work preparing to search the territory. Steve was given his bag that was retrieved from the spot they hid them before the attack. The Hulk was given Bruces’ bag along with Tony’s own. He stuffed Tony’s armor and clothing and gauntlets inside as best as he could with his claws.
Steve released a whine of embarrassment just as Tony automatically said “No,” to the deal. He’d rather go on not knowing the inside joke they shared between themselves than reveal what Vision had said in regards to Steve. It was something the little machine should not have been aware of in the first place, and Tony had done everything he could to prevent him from accidentally rolling in on a heated scene, but somehow the little menace still knew about it and was very blunt on the subject. Tony put all the blame on Jarvis.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that. The alpha was willingly telling others instead of just leaving it alone for them to make assumptions, or not to tell them at all. Why would Steve want them to know when Tony had nothing to show or to give? He didn’t look anything special, wasn’t a prize of sorts, and was probably making the residents pity the Captain of the Avengers for choosing such an omega.
Then Steve stopped. Pulled his mouth away and only left his hand to hold Tony’s erection. Tony whined in frustration at that. He hadn’t been close, but the abrupt stop and the cold of the air compared to the heat of his body left him shivering. Goose pimples and hairs standing on his skin.
All their faces quickly shifted from confused to shocked. Tony counted down the seconds in his mind.
He snorted and reared his head back when something pecked his cheek.
Tony’s face flushed at the compliment while Sam appeared offended.“Mate right here, Clint.”
To his embarrassment his nightclothes were the only set he carried that were considered clean. Life in the shacks didn’t give out chances for luxuries, obviously, and in his case it meant never getting the chance to sleep with the gentle touch of soft fabric on his skin. Sleeping as a wolf at night didn’t really call for clothing and so the nightclothes were hardly used since leaving his old pack.
Jarvis didn’t blink. “Before you do so, Master Wilson sent us to inform you they are residing in the Red Mare Inn, and are in possession of your clothing. When you are finished with your coupling and wish to be dressed you may call upon Redwind or I and we will inform the others to bring your items.”
“But what about the town’s people? They’re going to panic seeing a two-legged wolf running right for them.”
Hulk. Whoever considered Bruce for a mate had to be aware they wouldn’t be courting just one person, they’d be courting two.
alphas. That reason being, the moment an alpha became pack-less all they had to do was simply start another one by propositioning the many betas and omegas desperate for a place. There were plenty to choose from in the shacks.
“Sir? You require sustenance after your strenuous activities.” Jarvis was, in fact,
, the very wings that everyone complained about for being introduced- stretched out as if ready to take off.
Deep breaths. Calm down.
Tony whined and covered his face, “Jarvis no, not you, too.”
All at once Tony's past flashed before him. His short years under Howard's questionable care. The years following up to the day Obie offered a chance where they could get back what they lost. The day Obie introduced him to Hammer. Hammer's hungry stare and the handshake that sealed his fate. Hammer's gentle touch that would soon change to pain and bruises. His soft words that would soon tear him down. Rhodey and Pepper and Happy unable to say or do anything as Hammer and Obie took him from them. Unable to say goodbye.
His own tears started. He had ordered Steve to leave him alone, disrespected his alpha and pack leader, and basically handed over a reason to be kicked out. This was it. Steve was slipping through his fingers.
Next is Rhodey/Sam, beating Bucky/Rhodey and Rhodey/Peggy.
do to give what Steve wanted?
Steve’s own hips pressed down on him, snuggled up perfectly against Tony’s ass and pushing out an undignified squeak from Tony as it grinded the alpha’s erection on him. Close enough that one small shift would put it just over his folds, but not where his body wanted it as heat pulsed and tried drawing the alpha in by sheer force. Steve gave a gentle thrust and caused his heated length to caress against Tony’s inner thigh before pushing against the skin right next to his cunt and keeping it there.
he wanted to scream to the sky. Before, they wouldn’t have batted an eye on him, he was sure of it.
“Bruce?” He called out to his fellow omega.
Steve sounded broken, sounded remorseful, so Tony opened his eyes and nearly stumbled when he saw the building tears in his blue eyes. The alpha blinked, causing the tears to fall before bowing his head and taking off. Tony didn’t see him go. He only stared at the spot the alpha had been just seconds ago. The anger in him had vanished, leaving behind shame. He didn’t know how it was possible since he was the one wronged in the situation, but damn was it happening.
The other beta huffed. “You're one to talk. They're your animal, too.”
“Steve?” Tony said cautiously, worried they might have done something wrong. Steve was his pack leader after all, and friend or not Rhodey was still a stranger to Steve and all his alpha leader was seeing was an omega in his pack getting friendly with another alpha.
need an erection in the middle of training,” but it was too late. Tony hadn’t even realized his eyes wondered down after hearing the mention of it but lo and behold there was the bulge. Then he reeled back in shame at staring at someone’s intimate parts that wasn’t his mate. An apology was ready on his lips, ready to plea he hadn’t meant it to Steve, but Steve cut him off when he used his hand to cover Tony’s eyes. Fear clutched at his heart. Had this finally pushed Steve to the edge?
Bruce walked up to him and set his pack right next to where Vision was waiting. “I can’t feel my toes.”
The bag under him shifted, something inside moving and causing Tony’s hind legs to lift up before sinking down again. Out rolled a little mechanical ball that opened a latch at the top to reveal a small head with two blue lights as eyes and a yellow rune glowing on it's ‘forehead.’ The ball chirped at him, moving back and forth to express its concern. Tony snorted and patted the head gently with his paw.
“Thank you. I’m sorry I couldn’t win.”
from him.
No, it had to be the water, or whatever he was being fed. He had long passed his youth. It would eventually run out.
Sitting on Peter’s little seat was the harness meant for Tony. The basic breast collar, the girth and the reins themselves. Colored in the most beautiful mahogany that was going to complement Tony’s black coat that Tony’s own champion money paid for handsomely. The best for himself and for his boy.
As a reminder, this chapter has bottom!Steve that will continue until the last two or three paragraphs. Be aware if it's not your cup of tea.
“At least he’ll still
Jarvis took four clawed-steps forward and flapped his wings. “I happen to have a name,” he snapped.
Peggy raised her own glass on her spot on Bucky’s lap. “For old time’s sake, Steven. Show these old dogs new tricks.”
“He takes after you then,” Natasha smirked.
Instead of answering Peggy asked her own question, “Tell me, Steve, do you still love Marvels? I know you’ve collected every issue out there.”
The first step out of the shack was surprisingly heavy to do, as if his legs were suddenly tied to boulders. Perhaps he couldn’t do this, maybe he wasn’t meant to join another pack.
The cool of the water was refreshing and helped soothe the heat in his belly momentarily. Without meaning to, he drank more than half and caught himself releasing a whine when Steve pulled the goblet away. “Easy. Don’t give yourself a stomach ache. You have to eat something, too.”
They weren’t given a chance to respond, let alone see the blond beta disappear through the green bushes, not when Rhodey started barking at them to hurry when the noises of gunfire began to grow louder in their surroundings. “Could really use the help in a few seconds, you two.”
The omega held himself straight. Chin up, arms down and marching proudly. While he didn't radiate threat, he didn't radiate defenseless either. Not with the way he kept his face serious and his body language calm as he willingly walked into the danger many in the village, passersby and travelers, including the
“I don’t want to be left behind!” Tony snapped. Eyes tightly shut as his throat burned from the sudden outburst, but damn it all he couldn’t let it go on without having a word in it. He didn’t want to get left behind. Chucked away like a dirty secret or abandoned. He wanted to stay near them all. He wanted to be useful, even if it meant as moral support. He could… he could
Tony jumped, his nose picking up more than what the fire and metal had to offer. The faint scent of alpha leaked through the ashes and grease and all at once any hope he had at obtaining work disappeared in an instant. He had hoped that the blacksmith was a beta, prayed really, so he was given a chance to try. But if an alpha was in charge… what kind of alpha would even allow him near the equipment?
Happy chuckled and shook his head fondly, joining them nonetheless. He took up Tony’s other side and needed to lower his head down in order to properly hug. He stood taller than Tony by two inches, something unfairly done if Tony were to say so, which he did. “I don’t remember you being that tall.”
Jarvis studied him from the bed. “On your right side. It looks like the makings of a nest I’m really tempted on utilizing. A little on the top as well.”
“Well, we had planned on catching some fish for lunch,” Tony turned to Bruce for confirmation if their plan was still a go.
“I’m ready,” Rhodey said as he stood straight and his arms strained holding his weapon of choice. In his hands was the same large gun with multiple barrels and ammunition hanging on the side that the enemy had appeared with prior.
Peggy turned her gaze to Steve, then Tony and then back to Steve. “You did finally find him, right Steve?”
If that were the case then Tony was perfect, so long as Steve hadn’t planned to start a family with him. If Steve wanted the latter… then he should drop his losses and find a proper mate that could give it to him.
do. Counting the hours and keeping his eyes open for landmarks to inform him of their location. The few stops through the journey were quick and efficient, stopping to water the horses and allowing Tony to do his own business, but as the long days continued and the grime and sweat became evident and intolerable, Tony’s determination began to dwindle.
The deceit and shame often warranted the kind of fury Hammer had shown for that brief moment. It must be true… and that meant -
“I try.”
“Don’t be a fly then. Good to know,” Rhodey nodded and, deeming it safe, walked in the direction of the clearing and the fort. A loud gunshot had them all ducking, except for the Hulk, and scrambling to find cover. After a few moments had passed where only the sounds of fire continued, but no Hydra shifter jumped from the trees, Rhodey peeked his head out and separated leaves in order to see through to the clearing. He cursed at what he saw.
The thinking murder had been easy. Hydra hurting his pack was something he couldn’t allow and Hydra taking his pack away from him was something he was going to fight tooth and nail against. His gauntlets would burn the very ground they stood on.
Chaos ensued as both he and Pepper began to struggle. He clawed and kicked at anyone who got too close. The sounds of the pistols prevented Hammer’s or Stane’s orders from being overheard. Panic began to rise as many of the betas realized what all the commotion would soon bring. In the confusion, Tony could see Pepper managing to dislodge her arm from her captors hold and pull down the cloth from her mouth and then nothing else. The arms around him pulled and pulled until he was back on the steps and eventually inside the carriage. Pepper did not follow. When the door was slammed closed Tony kicked and kicked at it. Desperately trying to break it. To get to Jarvis. To Pepper. To make sure they were safe.
Jan soon followed with one of the legs of the deer clamped in her mouth. Steve appeared afterwards with a larger deer than the previous three. But the one Thor carried in his mouth easily beat them all. Tony didn't even know deer could get that big. It easily rivaled him in size, but since he was an omega, naturally smaller, it was a concept not hard to do. Still, he was a shifter. There had to be an exception sometime.
“You’re not old enough to break your hip from Vision bumping on it,” Bruce said. “You’ll still walk funny, but not because of a broken hip.”
with her.
Nothing brought an alpha so close to a blood rage than learning their omega was carrying another alpha’s child.
Tony wisely kept his mouth shut.
How long has it happened?”
“Nothing to apologize for. You saved our skins.”
He wondered if he could add moving parts to it… perhaps a secret compartment to hide a weapon of sorts? An explosive capable of shattering what his gauntlets’ blast could not.
making it up to the alpha.
Bucky cleared his throat at the mention of his name. One hand of his was rubbing the back of his neck. “Sorry, sometimes I don’t have a strainer for the things I say, especially when Steve is involved. Just gotta tease your best friend, you know? No matter who else gets in the crossfire.”
“Because you know me so well?”
The pack leader. Oh, what a joke Tony had made for himself. He found the
“I did. Still the human struggles but he shall never break free again. He has no hold in humanity, nothing to help him. He is gone, just as you will once I end you,” with a roar the hydra struck. Tony barely managing to avoid the sharp teeth.
After nearly two months on the road, the sight of the mansion could’ve brought him to tears. Now he understood what relief his packmates felt upon looking at the building the first time they brought Tony and Bruce to the mansion. Tony had never truly experienced homesickness, but now that he had he understood the importance of the pack and how much he appreciated each of his packmates. The familiar comfort holding them all together as they journeyed far from their den was not to be scoffed at.
Steve broke out a grin before kissing him again in goodnight and waiting on Tony to enter his room before walking away. Tony remained in his room for a total of five minutes before venturing outside again and walking down to Bruce’s door. He pressed his ear next to it, listening in on Bruce’s soft snoring and nothing else. The other omega had gotten the duty of watching over his cockatoo and machine while he took his walk with Steve and if he were to guess from what he was hearing he’d say Jarvis and Vision were also asleep. Not having the heart to disturb any of them and not exactly wanting to sleep alone on his bed yet he wandered away and headed further down the hall. With no clear destination in mind and no clue where certain doors or corridors led he continued his quiet walk blindly, being careful not to wake up any of the others.
“Loki that’s enough,” Jan said, eyes sharp at the python.
“Love doesn’t exactly make you see reason, does it?”
than even Rhodey - was here with him, hugging him, holding him, saying his name, was close enough for him to smell her familiar scent mixed with the scent of travel, and was solid and real.
Bucky was unimpressed again. “I take it this is someone important to you, considering you bit me for them?”
and no
From somewhere behind the Avengers the crowd of fans had rearranged and a bunch of them gave whines of disbelief and outcry. Everyone ignored them.
want to go through.”
“Mister Tony!”
“How is it?”
me to mark you?”
and have complicated thought processes.
Tony ignored the little pain in his chest when he noticed Steve still hadn’t let go of Prior’s hand as he sighed and stood. “This table is getting overcrowded. Let's let the others get a chance to use it,” he said when Bruce gave him a questioning gaze.
Taking the hint Tony made his way back out the doors. Loki said one last thing before closing the doors. “Remember, Anthony, no one has a right to demand something of you and no one should have that control. You are allowed to deny them.”
“Tell you what,” Sam started with a wicked smirk. “Share with the pack what Vision had said and we’ll share with you what we’re talking about.”
They have Tony. They have the one thing Steve could never prepare himself for, and he’s absolutely terrified for what they’re going to do.
Hammer’s eyes narrowed. He hadn’t liked his question. “Long enough. You know I hate being kept waiting, Omega.”
“I’ll make us something to eat as soon as we… you know, seperate.” To emphasize his point Steve ended up pushing his hips lightly, forcing Tony’s own to mimic the movement.
Vision huffed but left it at that. Jarvis pecked him one more time, deciding it enough, before settling down again and nesting.
Steve repeated those words over and over again to the point of creating a mantra. He didn't slow down and he didn't stop trembling, not until Tony calmed enough that his heart wasn't painfully beating heavy in his chest. Steve wasn't irritated anymore, wasn't even smelling close to how he was not five minutes ago. He smelled
If anything the pout seemed to grow stronger with the added tint of pink on his cheeks. Sam then turned to Tony. “We’re teasing you, too. We don’t mean anything by it -”
It wasn’t much to ask for, but it was something Tony would find difficult to do. The instinct to just hide his imperfections embedded deep within his being. Sharp words from his past digging them further and further down, almost out of reach. Soft words of love and encouragement slowly breaking down that instinct, lifting it up from deep within his pit of doubt. He took a deep breath. He could do it. For himself and for Steve.
Turned out, according to Bruce, Tony had gotten a sprained wrist. Tripping on his jump as he ran away from the pack he abruptly bumped into had injured his paw, and continuously using it to run back to Vision and Bruce made it worse. The injury carried over to his wrist and had required to be wrapped. Thankfully, Bruce was a doctor and seemed to know what he was doing. A good rest with no labor on his wrist and Tony should be good as new in a day or two. That meant no tinkering or hunting for Tony, Bruce’s orders.
“Alright?” Bruce eyed his legs.
“Rhodey!” Tony leaped at him in pure joy and licked everywhere he could reach on his face. The years surely lifted from him. He felt like a pup, energetic and eager and whining from the pure happiness he felt. “I can’t believe you’re really here.”
Thankfully, she took pity on him. “Don’t worry. The young love phase will keep you distracted long enough before you see what I mean.” She leaned in closer, as if exposing a secret. “That man doesn’t know the first thing about maintaining his armor.”
“And you will,” Steve said firmly. “You’ll create amazing things, incredible things, things that we could only dream of. I’m sure of it.” The alpha gave his chin a lick. “We’re all sure of it. The pack will support you every step of the way.”
Tony found himself feeling, well, excited when the town of Hattan was within sight.
“Get to work,” one beta gruffed. A balding man with a scar over his eye and a protruding belly. “Your alpha wants these done yesterday.”
“Sir, we shall make noise and continue to do so should you decide not to move. Do not believe we won't.”

That was… if the news of a pup was something they would celebrate. His pack wasn’t malicious, but perhaps a newborn wasn’t something they had planned for or expected as of late.
him. For what? What did you hope to gain from this?”
Their late twenties. Steve, who Tony found very attractive, in his late twenties. That stung Tony a little. If only he had met Steve twenty years prior, in his prime, and hadn't had Hammer as an obstacle in the way. Maybe he could’ve had a chance to be the ideal mate for him. Now? Not so much.

they go for you both instead! Two old omegas that arrived barely two days ago.”
Fout more join the agent against the wall. They avoid touching or stepping on anything. The other agents heed Winter’s advice and backtrack outside. Then the camera focuses on the Avengers again. Hawkeye now has the tranq gun, readying it as he, Widow and Winter get just a little closer to Steve’s form. Thor, Falcon and War Machine aren’t far behind.
There was an evident tremble from Steve. “I can still see them on you. I can still see their faces, the smiles they had as they watched you cry. I understanding wanting to do errands on your own, wanting to be independent, but I can’t stop imagining something happening to you. And after today? I c-can’t - I can’t let you out of my sight. I’m sorry. I’m going to be patronizing for the next few days.”
Steve watched the entire scene and in surprise and shock he let Rhodey go. Rhodey landed on the ground with a soft ‘thump’ and still didn’t move. Tony checked for breathing, relief sweeping him when he noticed the slow rise and fall of Rhodey’s chest. He slowly walked closer, sniffing and relishing at the scent that was pure Rhodey.
“Tony?”
Then Clint’s laughter joined his own and his was accompanied by yips and barks. Then Jan, then Sam, then Hank and then Thor. The lion, instead of creating yips, had rumbles going along and small roars.
Unable to avoid not showing the Avengers his insecurities he stood up again with a sigh and took off his wet coat and waistcoat, leaving only his blanket of a shirt on that clung to his skin. It revealed his angular body for all. He took note of all the Avengers looking him over, eyes glued to every detail of his figure. When he dared to see Steve he found the alpha drinking in the sight he made, eyes wide and mouth slightly open. Tony guessed this was the first time Steve saw an omega as malnourished as him and probably couldn’t believe what his eyes were witnessing.
Even with his old pack he was never separated from them, no matter how much he hated traveling with them and always lived in constant fear of the next trip.
Once within arms reach, Steve planted himself firmly against the wall and opened one of the window’s shutters to peek outside. Tony held his breath in anticipation, expecting the worst. The candlestick and the tension Steve carried lowered upon the alpha realizing what was behind the shutters.
“Not even close,” she flicked her hand, offended. “With Pepper not competing I’m going up against foals. Honestly, it’s not even worth trying anymore. Why did she leave me!”
Tony nodded once. “I’ll be careful, Steve.” He didn’t add the ‘don’t worry’ part, considering his alpha would probably never stop worrying about him. An alpha’s instincts to always keep their mates safe made it near impossible. If luck was on his side Tony might be able to prove himself during the journey and in return possibly lessen that worry to mild natural concern.
Tony burrowed his fingers deeper into Steve's fur, silently thanking whatever instinct made Steve head for town in search of him. Otherwise he'd be in the middle of something he didn't want to think about. “I'm sorry for worrying you.”
, his mate was there. He remembers not understanding why his mate didn’t move. Why his mate didn’t make a sound.
Above the trees, a white feathery bird could be seen heading their way. Jarvis’ facial expressions were hard to distinguish on a good day, but Tony could see the umbrella cockatoo worried and frightened even from a distance. His head crest was extended. Anxious at having seen Tony within Hammer’s hold.
The serpent sighed. “There is much work to be done. A wielder of the arts surrendering his voice to others without a fight is a disgrace I will not stand.”
“Don’t count us out yet, Boss.”
pups to be happy, Sweetheart. Not when I’ll have you.”
“Tones?” Rhodey eventually started, the same as he would all those years ago. “Stop thinking so much. You know what happens when you do that.”
It continued to the third day and reached to the fourth without change. On the fifth day Tony began to accept it was going to be Hammer all over again and soon Steve would demand him to stop speaking to Rhodey, or just kick Rhodey out in general. Perhaps Tony didn’t even need to reveal Steve the truth about his barren nature. He was ready to leave if it meant he was able to say more than five sentences to his best friend.
“The Avengers,” Tony said as casually as he could without giving himself away, even though inside he was fighting to jump up and follow after the youngsters.
“I said no,” again he heard himself say. A foreign concept, and yet he was witnessing it before his very eyes.
,” he pleaded his best friend. He didn’t want his pack to think lesser of him for his past. “It’s fine.”
Tony shifted, "and you, too.”
Looking to Tony was useless as Steve now had him pinned on one of the couches and was slowly undoing his pants. Jarvis was squawking out undignified noises as he tried to cover Vision’s eyes with his feathers. Tony didn't even spare them a glance. Rhodey made a mental note to hurt the alpha later.
“I do, but why?”
“What did I do?” the beta pleaded, now under the glare of the bird and a machine. Vision had rolled up to stare at the beta and gave his best impression of angry steel and gave an offending beep for Jarvis. The beta cautiously leaned away from the table in order to have some distance in case the bird and machine decided to jump and strike.
Tony almost felt bad when the beta released a terrified whine and dropped to the ground, but then Bruce was moving and ordering him to follow as he continued to snarl at any beta or omega in their way and Tony wasn't given any time to pity them.
“Uh,” Tony managed and for a moment he panicked. What was he going to say? He had to think of something. He had to somehow redirect her attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hammer knew of his ability, thanks to Obie, and Obie naturally knew because he helped raise him from a young age. Both alphas always looking for opportunities, they saw the potential his ability and skills had and pushed and pushed him to make rune weapons. He held back for as long as he could. He created mundane things not worth mentioning, and purposefully took weeks that extended into months to buy himself time, but eventually, he'd wear out. Old and broken he gave in and his rune gauntlets came to be. He was pushed to try something new, something never before seen, and when he presented the gauntlets to Hammer and Obie and got their approval he had felt on top of the world for the first time in years. That was until they used the gauntlets to hurt him. Hurt and betray in ways Tony hadn't believed they were capable of.
So if Steve wanted to groom him then Tony was going to remain still and let him, even if it meant being unable to talk or get close to his friends. Tony owed him for letting them stay, so anything Steve wanted Tony would do.
Tony’s face lit up entirely and his hands quickly went behind to cover the little he could. He even turned his body slightly in order to keep his back out of their sights. The flush reached all the way down to his neck, probably matching with the crimson coat, but it was nothing compared to the red Steve had gotten from apparent fury and the near menacing growl accompanied with it. Everyone stopped to turn to him. Steve was glaring at Bucky, having taken one step towards him and looking ready to fight, but for all the intended purpose of the glare the alpha leader was giving, Steve didn’t actually do anything besides continuously release a rumble to let them know his anger was not fading anytime soon.
Ultimately it did. “Don’t say it’s okay. We both know this would hurt anyone’s back,” May waggled a finger playfully. “Behave,” she repeated to Peter and like the good little boy he was Peter listened.
Lack of self-care, playing hero and quick sex in this chapter!
Tony shivered in disgust. The feeling too much and the prickling sensation of tears building up too strong to stop. He curled up, burying his face into the sleeves and allowing the material of the coat to suck in the salty liquid. He started slowly scrubbing away at it, cleaning his face as much as he could without causing a lot of movement and catching anyone who was possibly awake’s, eye.
straight into a pack was shock, disbelief, worry, and in Bruce’s case that involved being friends with the shifter, belated terror.
He asked if he could stay. Promised to be of help and never be a burden. Promised them everything, just please allow him to stay.
When they pulled away it was to their awake team whistling. Natasha shouted a “напиток!” with her mug raised. Everyone did the same and took a swig. Steve had no mug to hold up, but he wanted to join in. He moved his arms so one forearm was under Tony’s butt and the other on his hip to hold him steady and lifted him up high.
“Mind if I talk to you for a moment?” The question was casual. The tone anything but. “Alone?”
Tony blinked. “What?”
“What does the letter say?” Loki came in and sat next to the small genius.
“Doesn’t mean you can’t go see them,” Bruce encouraged.
Already ideas began to fill his head. It would be dangerous and Tony would only have one chance to execute his move, but one chance was better than his possible future under Hammer and Stane’s hold. Anything was better than that.
“You do not create natural magic, but you are capable of manipulating existing magic. To be more specific, magic that reside in runes, yes?”
Later, after Tony had taken the outfit off and tucked it away, he made a decision on when to use that outfit for the first time in public. In the three weeks of living with the Avengers Tony had learned how exactly the pack had earned enough coin in order to afford their mansion. They hadn’t earned it simply from accepting large contracts seeing as one never knew when their next set of contracts were going to appear. They weren’t a reliable constant revenue, but while the Avengers sometime lacked in work as a pack they made up for it individually with their special skill set that brought forth produce.
“Hank, Dear, they’re trying to run away.”
Tony whined as Rhodey gave a chuckle. “It’s good to see you, too, Jarvis, though I don’t remember you being that big. Tony’s been overfeeding you?” He shrieked when Jarvis pecked his nose in retaliation. “I don’t remember you being this violent, either!”
Jarvis whistled in contentment at the sight of Bucky receiving ammo for his comment. The cockatoo was currently nesting on Bruce’s shoulder while Vision was nestled on his side on the couch. Since obtaining his work and requiring hours working at Ben’s forge Tony had assigned his fellow omega as an honorary caretaker for Jarvis and Vision while he was in town in order to avoid the pair from becoming true menaces. There was nothing worse than a bored machine with no one to play with and a grumpy cockatoo complaining about the heat and the oil getting into his white feathers. And from the way Bruce preened while Clint whined about not getting picked to take care of the pair Tony figured Bruce enjoyed watching over the two.
Steve must have been beside himself with worry and rage. What would have gone through his head upon the moment he learned his mate was taken from their home? The very place that was meant to keep his pack safe while he was away? Tony imagined the mansion wouldn’t be home anymore. Not after this. To have it so easily violated without any consequences to the violator and leaving its residents feeling so vulnerable.
Tony waved at them timidly. The motion seemed to snap the Avengers from their surprise as each and every one of them gave their own versions of smiles and grins. And while their reactions were a good sign he focused on the one that truly had the final say. He locked eyes with Steve and took notice of how the young alpha looked resigned for the brief moment as he processed their arrival. Then, when he finally realized who he was looking at, the resigned look melted away and hope, delight and a guarded appearance took over. His eyes were asking a question and Tony had an idea what that question was.
not, hesitate to use his child against him.
“Never.” Steve lifted his hand to kiss the knuckles. “Never.”
“But Sam is the best looking out of all of us,” Clint finished with a cross of his arms, huffing and closing his eyes.
It was like an arrow right through Tony’s heart. He had a pretty good idea which omega the beta was referring to. Everyone was wary of Bruce, so perhaps he had something to give to the Avengers, but Tony? He was wearing clothing that framed loosely on him, had a sharp face that made it obvious he wasn’t exactly healthy, didn’t have any kind of aura that made him dangerous like Bruce, and frankly looked out of place with the entire pack.
“I’ll say. Quick, you cover the north trees and I’ll cover the south. Loki can take the sides. We’re going to make sure they don't leave.”
Tony moved to turn his head away, but Rhodey’s words stopped him and he thought better of it. He couldn’t simply hide anymore, no matter how much he wanted to. He owed it to his pack. “Because I haven’t had a heat in nearly twenty years. I thought my body finally caught up with my… barren… nature. Finally got the clue to stop.”
“No, you wouldn’t. You want to say you would just to punish yourself right now.”
With a cold sweat all three quickly jumped and took to the air, separating. From the ground, exactly where they were standing mere seconds ago, something broke through with a mighty roar that shook the entire foundation and even caused stone and ground from the ceiling that enclosed the place. The thing, the beast, that broke through was the stuff of nightmares, even compared to their own. Dirt and stone trailed down the monster's dark silver body. A body that stood three-stories high on two thick and clawed legs and a long scaled tail with fins decorating the top.
“Exceptional, Sir,” Jarvis said without even looking at him, probably annoyed from having repeated the same answer over and over. Vision had stopped whistling in agreement and instead rocked back and forth in impatience.
He really hoped he wasn’t pushing Steve’s patience.
Tony managed to have a small conversation with Rhodey involving how many months he was on the road searching and the roads he had traveled before Steve decided it had gone long enough and came over to pointedly sit next to Tony and frown at Rhodey. The atmosphere filled with tension from his appearance and Rhodey knew not to push so he excused himself, gave Tony a regretful glance and left. Tony watched him go with a heavy heart, not feeling at all relaxed or cared for when Steve kissed his forehead.
Because of his age and health and scarring he wasn’t in his prime to be showed off, so that marked him off to any alphas wanting a prize. He also never had any experience being a den mother since Hammer’s pack weren’t exactly keen on wanting to be mothered. His years voided of workmanship also prevented him from physically working long hours now. That only left him with one last purpose; breeding. Even that wasn’t an option he could do. For as long as he could remember he had been infertile. Every time Hammer tried to impregnate him it never stuck. No matter what he took, what nasty concoction that promised to aid in pregnancy, how many times Hammer attempted, he remained barren. The fault wasn’t in Hammer. The moment he shared a night with the newest and youngest omega of the pack there was already a future Hammer in the making by the next morning.
Another beta, a dark-skinned fellow, added, “Not a problem. We’ll get deer, as long as you don’t mind company.”
The barrel vanished from sight and a groan of pain told Tony he had struck the gun holder. Their friends quickly jumped to strike in revenge, prompting Rhodey to start shooting one bullet after another and for Tony to charge and shoot anything that moved.
Tony’s eyebrows furrowed. “What? But he’s so -”
Steve waved his offers away. “No, thank you. I’ve got those covered already. Nice of you to offer, though. Sam, since you’re busy keeping a watchful eye on the cart you have pulling duty.”
“They’re already avoiding me as it is. I don’t think you’ll be scaring anyone away from me, honestly,” Tony stood, taking Jarvis and Vision with him. “Your shack, or mine?”
They rutted against each other like teenagers. Against the wall of the communal kitchen. They never even bothered with the zipper of their pants or thought to take this somewhere more private. It was rough and fast and it dulled Tony’s senses of their immediate area. If any of their teammates walked in Tony wouldn’t bat an eye at them. All his attention was on Rogers and only Rogers. The burn that coursed through his body was building and the pressure slowly grew with each desperate jerk of their hips. He groaned, moaned and grunted with each thrust. The release he so desperately wanted getting closer and closer until he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Just for you, Honey Bear.”
“I’m not sure…” Tony admitted. He was to spend time with Steve, if the alpha still wanted to, but other than walk around he didn’t know what else they were to do, or how else he was supposed to use the day until their walk happened.
Perhaps one day.
Tony stopped moving completely. He looked at Hammer with fear when breathing became severely difficult and the alpha refused to loosen it as the seconds ticked by. The anger in Hammer’s eyes really stressed in the danger he and Pepper were currently in. If the alpha didn’t release him his very breath would be taken away. If the alpha moved his arm, made a sudden twist, he could very well end Tony’s life at that moment.
“Something embarrassing, perhaps? An innuendo of sorts?” Natasha supplied with a smirk that had Tony blushing all over again, giving them their answers.
“Nice to meet you, Tony. Looking forward to working with you.”
“Keep me full of you,” Tony agreed. “Such a good alpha.”
Clint gave a snort. “Get the feeling Steve really enjoys how you look in Jan’s outfit, Tony. Gotta say, I’m enjoying it, too.” He gave a wink and a wiggle of his eyebrows suggestively.
in order to defend someone who was a stranger to their pack. There were rules against that, rules that gave their leader every right to kick Tony out of the pack. Attacking the second in command was a huge no for anyone in the lower hierarchy. Being the leader’s mate or not, Tony wasn’t going to be excused for his actions.
Well, besides Bucky and Sam, Steve at least had kept it secret from everyone, too, not just from Tony. Perhaps he was waiting for Tony himself to reveal it? Waited for Tony to learn it on his own. That would be Steve, wanting him to do it on his own instead of relying on him.
Tony walked with a bounce to his step, so much so that even Jarvis was springing up and down on his shoulder from his movement. In retaliation and annoyance Jarvis nipped his ear gently and Tony was mindful to control his steps after that. He was in such a good mood that it felt as if nothing could’ve ruined this moment, that was until an unsavory chill ran down his spine. He had passed May’s corner, unable to wave goodbye to her or Scott because they were away from sight, when an eery sense hit him. His instincts from before warning him of possible wrongs returned, but like before he found nothing amiss. He searched for the source long and hard, his senses on the verge of fear from the unknown.
Tony shivered in delight when Steve leaned down to give his neck a lick. Then disappointment set in when the alpha didn't bite down like he expected him to.
Jarvis whistled in agreement while Vision made his body turn slowly in order to mimic a sensual stance. “Truly, Sir. None will be able to resist gazing.”
“I prefer Widow better. Has a personal touch to it,” Natasha admitted, looking scary just by sitting there next to Bruce.
“You said there was an empty shack here?” Tony communicated through growls. Words clear but accompanied by a gruff tone.
“Considering the ages required to be called a child I highly doubt this to be ‘playing nice with the other kids.’”
really, that they would treat him decently, kindly, with some form of
“Why ever not?” She stared at him. “Do you have a proper reason why I’ll surrender a bath to you?”
Tony blinked back into reality and faced Bruce. “Hm?”
Hammer glared. He kept his foot in place for too long before finally removing it.
“They’re trying to make a run for it and these two grumps don’t want to help me.”
two figures Tony instantly recognized. Two figures he would recognize anywhere. Because they were faces that haunted his past, haunted his present, and now would haunt his foreseeable future.
If Tony’s attention hadn't been caught by the shameless sight he would've thought long and hard about the implication of Steve making sure to mark him in more ways than just the physical. Of course this was also the moment his body gave a valiant twitch for round four and… he couldn't. For the first time he couldn't, not because it was unwanted, but because he had no energy left in him. And he was still hungry.
What would Hank and Jan say after losing their own?
He shook his head. “No, they don’t need any more fans circling them.”
There was an internal conflict in his mind as Tony created the image Steve had just described while also trying to pay attention to what Steve was doing. The alpha’s oiled fingers smoothed the surface of his erection as he sank down slowly. Tony didn’t know which one to focus on.
The next day, Steve woke up bright and early. He powered through breakfast, reassured his mom he didn’t catch a cold from staying out so long yesterday and rushed through the door. He scanned the area rapidly for his friend, crestfallen when he saw no sign of him anywhere.
Another fond memory he had was when Vision first beeped and rolled, signaling he was ‘alive’ and kicking, thanks to the yellow rune Tony had used on him. The little red, green and yellow machine was made from scraps of metal he had collected and modified without Hammer's knowledge. He worked the metal to be strong and durable while at the same time to be light enough for Vision to roll away from danger if he needed to. Though the machine refused to stay more than ten feet away from Tony. On top of that, he made a permanent home in Tony’s bag. Wherever Tony went he was pressured into carrying his bag, otherwise, he was going to have a very annoyed machine following after him and beeping constantly. The one thing Hammer absolutely hated. The irritatingly high pitched noise Vision created would send him to a rage. Tony wasn’t going to give Hammer a reason to take and sell Vision like he had always wanted to.
Steve reached out a shaky hand and gently held the un-wrapped fingers on Tony’s injured arm with his own. “I’d like to get to know you, if you’d let me.”
“What are your plans for the day, Tony?” Sam said before taking a bite of his food, sitting across from him.
Bruce cleared his throat and made to get up, “I’ll go and search for a stone,” but before he could actually set a foot down Natasha reached behind her and offered a flat stone that was perfect to use as a pan. Tony didn’t know when the red-headed alpha found the time to disappear and search for it when he was pretty sure she had been sitting with them the whole time and never moved a muscle. Did she carry flat stones with her for the hell of it? Tony didn’t know if he wanted the answer to that.
Tony must have appeared similar to a fish with the way his mouth opened and closed at a loss for words. Caught unawares, he didn’t have a witty response to the obvious joke.
The alpha smiled. “I’ll see you later.”
Been peeked his head out. That was their signal.
The python hummed. “You are aware how magic works. Your wants and desires of the moment allow for a handle to manipulate.”
Contrary to Tony’s belief, he had some fond memories with his old pack. That was to say he didn’t have them
Thor had taken the situation in his own paws and took a running start to jump over Vision into the river, creating a massive wave that drenched Tony, the jackal and the coyote from head to toes. With a growl of concern, Thor padded through the water that reached his chest and began to softly push Vision towards the edge with his nose. Half of Vision’s body that was submerged resurfaced and once the base touched solid land Vision quickly rolled to Tony’s opened arms.
“What are we up against?” Steve asked.
“Are you still in bed? We’re about to leave in thirty minutes, Steve. Get your ass up and get dressed already,” Bucky said, forcing the covers off and grinning at the blond’s weak effort to get them back.
. Can you imagine it, Darling? All that destruction from a single palm.”
8/17/17 - Change a lot of the part where Tony was being followed. I wasn't completely satisfied with the way it had been before, and I feel this one makes more sense in this situation.
“Maybe I can guard the den while you’re out?”
Steve prowled closer. A growl of approval releasing from his throat. “You don’t know how
“This alpha is ours.”
Resting, right, now that the adrenaline was slowly leaving his body he noticed how heavy his eyes felt. Resting sounded perfect. He leaned his face towards the cockatoo in order to rub his cheek against the soft plumage before laying back down. Jarvis carefully adjusted around his movement and ended up nesting on his chest.
“Helps me get some rest at night.”
“No, this is fine,” Tony reassured, contemplating what the alpha had said. Bruce and him could have a room all on their own. While it sounded like the ideal accommodation he found the proposal lonely. It was one thing to sleep the nights alone in a shack, seeing as the little make-shift housing wasn’t by design to be very spaceful. These rooms, however, they had a lot of space, almost about the same space as the storage rooms he slept in when Hammer tired of him and kicked him out to have a much needed break. Perhaps even more, considering it was near empty and had no materials to fill up the space.
Tony had half a mind to ask what in the world was going on. Steve was one concern, but the entire pack acting this way towards the female alpha after showing how much they cared for her during their travels? It was unusual, but her speaking snapped them out of whatever instincts had taken over. They all returned back to their spots on the lineup, leaving Tony more confused than ever and Steve to order them to get a move on.
There were multiple groans of agreement from everyone, the loudest being from Tony, but fate continued to work against him because the very second they began struggling to move Bucky jumped out of nowhere, rushed to step around the wiggling bodies and hid as best as he could behind Natasha on the top of the pile. The last missing pack mate of theirs joined them soon after, his focus only on the hidden alpha before he actually paid attention to what he was seeing and quickly gave a whine of mortification when he spotted Tony at the very bottom of the assortment of shifters.
“Yes, Sir, we did. You made a startling appearance after chasing prey that led us to them as they passed by and was introduced to one Steve Rogers who invited you to join the pack. It was not a dream.”
True to his word, Steve kept by his side everywhere he went. He waited by the door in the mornings, walked with him to breakfast, joined him on his trip to Hattan (along with literally all their packmates) to speak with Ben about the work, sat next to him during their time of relaxation on the couches, but like promised Steve didn’t follow him to bathe. He did, however, wait for him near the stairs for the walk back when he finished.
With a longing sigh Steve closed the comic book in his hands and carefully held it. The comic was of Marvels and on the front page the image of Tony Stark stood proudly in a confident pose. Besides him stood James Rhodes and Virginia Potts in a similar pose. All three looking in various directions that Steve could imagine being a very dramatic movie poster. On their backs were the infamous wings that created their downfall.
Perhaps the gesture of inviting someone to sit with a pack for something as ordinary as spending time together was outdated? That would explain why these three,
Tony moved away from him. “Stop.
Tony ducked from two heads going for him, folding his wings in a freefall and causing the heads to collide against each other.
- I can’t believe it. I’m really seeing you right now. You’re really here.”
And now since they were both alone with no pack and no Jarvis or Vision or Bruce, Tony was able to ask the question without feeling pitied for it. At least he hoped Steve wouldn't pity him. “Steve,” he started, not having enough courage to actually make eye contact while asking, “you can probably choose anyone in the world to be your mate. They'll trip over themselves at the very thought of you courting them. All the betas and omegas in the shacks you found me at would’ve been over the moon if you had paid attention to them. Why… why me? Why did you choose me?”
Hope you enjoyed!
Tony understood. They’ve been hiding things long enough and the Avengers have been nothing but understanding and caring and they accepted everything he and Bruce had said without question. It can’t go on. It shouldn’t go on. The pack had more than earned their trust.
Something inside Tony flared up and the urge to punch the beta became strong, but he couldn't act out on the emotion because it seemed Bruce had reached his breaking point and released a threatening snarl as he marched up to the beta’s face, growling. The intensity of the snarl was unlike anything an omega was capable of producing, or even a beta, and all the shifters in the area realized this as they grew pale and began stepping down.
Suddenly his hand shot out and grabbed Tony’s throat in a tight hold. It was so fast and unexpected that Tony choked, trying to catch his breath.
Sam waited for them to stop before he continued. “Even if Nat wanted to kill you she'd have to get through Steve first. On Top of that I don't think killing the friend of the person you're trying to court will make a good impression.”
Tony’s eyes trailed to the alpha named, giving Steve’s smile a brief glance before his gaze landed on a round shield held on his back by a strap circling his right arm. That hadn’t been there either upon their first meeting. What or who had the Avengers fought against before they ran into Tony and Bruce that broke Steve’s shield? And why hadn’t Tony thought about the shield before? The Captain of the Avengers was known for always traveling with a shield. Didn’t matter if they traveled for a fight or were out in search of an individual that required a much needed rescue. Papers always wrote of the Captain with his shield.
There was some color forming on his cheeks. Tony was surprised he managed to keep most of it at bay. He had been gawking at his mate, sort of, and was caught red handed, but did that mattered? It was
“Really puts the pressure on I think.”
He was probably overthinking things, but with the pack traveling in a frustratingly slow pace because Bruce refused to shift and Tony refused to leave him as the only two-legged to travel (plus his wrist was still healing) what else was he to think? The ground they could’ve covered had Tony and Bruce shifted would’ve been farther. They’d be out of the forest by now, probably, if only they were walking on four instead of two. But they weren’t and the forest seemed never ending and Tony was absolutely certain the the Avengers were frustrated, tired and wanted to leave the two omegas behind.
“Why you -”
honorable on his part.
What was the correct answer?
is trapped in a hole.”
“You want the sweets or the flowers?”
Tony understood that he was going to be smothered for the foreseeable future. Their packmates were not going to let him remain alone for long.
When the workshop lit up with life following the first snowfall, he got to work helping read the first batch of letters and wrap the toys. They were small tasks, but tasks he took seriously. Menial work compared to what Loki and Thor did, but it was work nonetheless and he was damn proud of it.
Tony clenched his teeth. Annoyance and pent-up frustration was not a good combination. Rogers’ holier than thou attitude was not helping.
Clint pulled away, appearing scandalized before shooting back and wrapping his arms around the beta. “You love my stink!”
When he opened the door he found an unexpected but delightful surprise in the form of Bruce standing just outside and wearing a decent shirt with dirt-less pants and brown boots. The other omega turned when he heard the noise from the door moving. “Tony, good morning.”
“Steve,” Tony whispered, “what are you doing?” The leader of the Avengers shouldn’t make a show in public, especially not for him. He didn’t need to lay some sort of affectionate claim in front of others, Hammer never did.
He couldn’t wait for the next day to start.
Tony did what he was told, taking painfully long breaths that felt as if his chest was tearing from the inside. Slowly, but surely, the pain subsided with each intake, enough so that he managed to take in air through his nose and smell the calming pheromones Sam was releasing. And that was when it hit him. The reason why they looked panicked. He had released distressed pheromones, no doubt drenching the entire room of it and kicking their instincts into play.
In a blind terror, Tony pushed himself as far back and away from the alpha’s boot as possible. Already having been so close to the edge the distance made little difference. Hammer kept his boot in place and followed after him. The alpha’s words were ringing in his ears.
“I shall handle that,” Jarvis said and was seconds away from taking off when Clint’s confused growl stopped him.
Perhaps Tony was taking liberties, but there was something about Steve’s smell that just made him
A future where his pup wasn’t used as a pawn against him was a future worth risking everything. To hold Steve again. To reveal the incredible news. To congratulate Rhodey on being an uncle. To share this happiness with the Avengers.
? I don’t know what he’s doing but it can’t be worth waiting here an hour for. Do you know how much ground we could’ve covered by now?” That voice could have only come from Clint. “Steve can we leave him behind? Loki knows where we live. He’ll find his way.”
Tony was left stunned at the sight he was seeing. The surface of the water shined under the rays of the sun and the small waves created by the wind gave it the effect of flickering stars under the evening sky. Yellow, orange, blue and purple colored that very sky over the trees in the distance. The water reflected those colors and twinkled those stars and it was perhaps the most beautiful sight of nature Tony had seen in a long time. It was almost too beautiful to be looked at by him, but even if he tried to leave or turn away Steve was making it extremely difficult to do so.
Dumbfounded, Rhodey nodded slowly. “Yes?”
Tony rushed to hop on the furniture, waiting for his mate and the food expectantly. Steve placed the tray in front of him before sitting by the edge. The goblet was the first thing the alpha grabbed. “Mind if I see you with less hair, Sweetheart?”
Bruce in turn smirked before bumping his shoulder with Tony’s lightly, snorting when Tony bumped his right back. “You wound me. Where was all that love you talked about?”
“Tones -”
On wards to confidence building in the next chapter!
“Ah,” Steve’s high sense of smell. Of course he’d be able to smell a pregnancy. Especially Tony’s. That meant Steve knew before Tony even learned of it, but for reasons unknown kept it quiet from him. Tony would have to ask him about it.
Surely Steve would have wanted his coat back. Why didn’t he remind Tony of it?
Loki turned his head to point at the new arrivals. “I believe you are acquainted with our guests.”
At least Steve had the unbreakable shield. He had that to rub on Bucky.
Well now, we meet again!
, as if waiting for Tony to do or say something. Tony held the gaze long after the Captain decided whatever he was waiting for Tony to do wasn’t going to happen and his eyes lost the hope. Instead, it seemed as if the Captain came to a decision and looked very determined to do it. He gave Tony a charming smile, teeth and all, and said “Hi.”
“Only when they’re nice back.”
Steve licked, kissed and suck. He was careful with his teeth and pleasured with the utmost focus. As if driving Tony wild was all there was in the world. With skilled manipulation, Steve followed down his erection and took his testes for a moment before continuing further. Tony waited in anticipation. His body already familiar with Steve’s prowess and what he could make him feel.
Against his better judgment, or perhaps finally listening to the little shred of hope he had managed to carry for years, he believed him. Somehow he just knew Steve would truly bring down the wrath of an enraged alpha protecting his mate upon Stane. Would do all that and more to finally prove everything that he and their pack have been doing from the start was all for his, and Bruce’s, well being. The cautious steps. Careful words. The soothing gestures and patience.
Rhodey, who had been in the air for seven minutes now, moved as fast as he could with his wings straining. One hydra head saw its chance and tried striking again and was inches away when a blast of cold air and icicles struck it on the side and sent it falling sideways and away from Rhodey.
“So, uh… who’s your friend, Tony?” Clint said cautiously, eyes on him but no doubt keeping the Hulk in his line of sight.
Steve jumped to his paws, looking rejuvenated. “Not at all! I’ll go get them for you.”
“In assumption, you integrate runes with everyday items and give them a magical quality, and an item that is most often sought for is weaponry, thus meaning the pit is to demand weaponry of you. How close am I to the truth?”
Tony opened and closed his mouth repeatedly. Bruce
“Sounds acceptable.”
I hope you guys don't mind if I take a quick pause from this so I can go and work on my Winter Soldier!Tony fic. It's overdue to be updated and I got the sudden urge to write more angst.
The sob he released from the pure solace was the loudest of them all. The tears the largest.
Could they ever look at him the same way again, after having seen him stare them down with pure malice and rage? With the face of a killer?
“Clint is enjoying Tony’s new outfit made by yours truly,” Jan answered with a flutter of her eyelashes.
Tony lit up at the thought. “Sounds perfect.”
Tony was too worried to be surprised that he knew. “Please.”
Clint gave a push against the mane and tried wiggling from under the feline. “In your dreams, Thor.”
Another thump, followed by very loud steps that faded away. Sam stared at where he guessed the sounds were being created and patted Thor’s arm. “I don’t think anyone else is up yet to calm him down.”
And now Tony was to join their fight by their side. He had one opportunity to impress, and no option for failure. If he could show them he was more than an old, blacksmith omega who managed to somehow win their leader’s heart he could have actual worth and a reason to keep him around long after he becomes the old, blacksmith omega who broke their leader’s heart.
Steve nodded slowly. “I did, too. That entire time, in fact. Kind of rude not to stare at the person when you talk to them.”
Tony casted his eyes down. “I didn’t mean to -”
He guessed he shouldn’t be surprised. When had anything regarding his own life gone right? But he figured since he was with Bruce that, maybe, destiny would take pity on him and give them both a chance to start new and have a decent happy ending.
Tony snorted. “The only thing blinding me is your good looks, Brucie. Don’t hide your body from me.”
In a large landslide, the winner is Loki/Thor!
“It’s the only correct opening that doesn’t consist of traps and dead ends. If we try to enter any other way we might find ourselves at the ends of pointed spears and poisoned darts,” Tony answered, joining her at studying the wall.
“Why should you claim first?” Peggy inquired, raising an eyebrow.
Steve’s smile grew wider. “You remember me from back then?”
Steve chuckled. “That’s one of my promises, yes, but this is a promise I made for you. I promised myself I would never let your old alpha hurt you ever again, and if I happen to run into them I would make sure they never would.”
It was considered a draw eventually, but Steve kept count and knew technically Natasha had won. He wasn’t going to tell either of them that. They’d keep going, wanting to win and Steve wanted his turn already.
“Not if I get to it first,” Sam countered, “and even if you somehow beat me I’m just going to push you off.”
Hank chuckled. “I know that feeling.”
However, there
As Tony took a moment to stare at his pack on his knees, a thought dawned to him. The pack he had put together when he ran away from Hammer and Stane hadn’t been this close to stuffed. Far from it. The small pockets weren’t even filled and the clothing only filled halfway, the gauntlets at the bottom included. What he had now… most, if not all, were a privilege than a necessity, and they were his to choose from.
“All right, no need to snap at me.” Tony reached inside and grabbed Vision’s circular body from the base before lifting him up and placing him on the table. “Vision, this is Bruce. Bruce I’d like you to meet this hunk of metal whose mission in life is to give me bruises, formally known as Vision, but I might rename him as Abuse.”
“May, please.”
It was said in a teasing manner, but it still resulted in Tony flushing, and it was still cheeky enough that Jarvis wasn’t going to let it go without action. The cockatoo shuffled over to the golden wolf’s head and yanked one of his ears.
Ben was May’s alpha, they were mated, someone who managed to win May’s heart surely wasn’t capable of doing wrongs.
Steve looked at him. “Can I help you dress?”
“I don’t think that’ll ever be possible,” Steve said, grinning with an arm over Tony’s shoulders. “Can’t get enough of him.”
“I will,” Tony promised, fully intending on doing the exact opposite. This time he would do better. He was going to keep calm and show nothing.
“No!” Tony cried, “get off,
Bucky/Peggy
“No, you're not,” he repeated. He might have said it with no reason but Tony was sticking to it, proof or not.
“R-really? Sorry, I didn’t mean to.”
Tony wasn’t exactly convinced. He was going to disappoint them both. He just knew it. “But I’m not exactly…
Steve gaped, “
“Be silent,” Loki hissed, sticking his tongue out one final time before pulling away and settling down in his original spot. He curled in thought. “You claim to be barren, and yet I taste fertility in your scent.”
Tony didn’t need to give anyone that image.
What if children? What if an elderly, not fast enough to escape? What if a mother, just wanting to return to her family? A father, who is the only provider for his kids? Grandparents, who just wanted to see their grandchildren, but never saw their innocent trip to the store to buy them gifts as their last day on this planet? A family that will never get to say goodbye to each other.
“I,” Hank didn’t sound excited but he got up nonetheless.
Steve paused, probably imagining the scenario and grimacing. “I’m sorry.”
“I’m very disappointed, Tony,” Stane eventually said. He had the audacity to shake his head. “You abandoned your pack. Abandoned your
The Hulk turned to him with eyes gleaming and a grin slowly forming. Sharp teeth shined under the light.
Eventually, the standoff was interrupted by Bucky placing a hand on Peggy’s shoulder. Bucky’s tone stern when he said, “
Tony blinked back to Sam waving a hand in front of his face. “Huh?”
At one point Rhodey decided to join in on their small pile and trotted over to drape his front leg over Tony’s back and rest his snout over his head. “I remember you being exactly this tall and I’m glad it hasn’t changed.”
Steve/Tony
To the side both Sam and Loki exchanged glances, understanding each other’s pain it seemed. Tony had to wonder how long the two had been mated with the pair that were currently bickering because it appeared to be a constant occurrence they learned to ignore. At least he wondered how long Clint and Sam had been mated. Clint didn’t exactly do a good job hiding it. Thor and Loki, however, he couldn’t tell what the two were to each other. They appeared closest, but didn’t exactly show open affection besides embracing, and that was usually interpreted in many different ways.
“It's… it's not you, Steve, really. It's…”
Hank hummed, not bothering to turn around but playing along. “Can’t have that now, can we?”
“You’re welcome, Sir,” Jarvis whistled.
The dream more than made up for the awkwardness that came from traveling with Steve’s ex-mate, Sharon. She was fierce in battle, Tony could admit to that. She was also very beautiful and he could see why she and Steve had once been together.
. In the end you
“Shh,” Jan interrupted, pulling back. Gloom in her eyes. “Everything we’ve ever done is because we

was met with Steve’s frown.
“Not from where I’m sitting. We didn’t even reach the water yet. We’re still covered in oil.”
He felt mortified at his situation. He was basically walking naked with his arousal out in the open for all to see if not for his fur providing some coverage. It did nothing for the smell, however, and he knew the moment his mate realized this. Steve had stopped with his paw in the air and turned his head sharply. Concern and control were in his eyes. He knew they needed to hurry.
“Not bad,” he said as he jumped down, nodding in approval. “Come on, we need to keep on the edge and take as many as we can along the way. The more now, the less later.”
, but how could she say it so easily? “Talk to him, Tony, before you think the worse. It might not be as bad as you’re imagining.”
“He spoke about it... He knew before?” How was that possible?
The scrawny little alpha child disappeared but Steve still remained, eyes still showing that brittle hope and a bright smile now joining them. Steve leaned over, pulled their intertwined hands to his chest, and gave Tony a gentle kiss on his cheek. If the crowd had been chatting eagerly before they were nearly shouting to each other now after watching their display. Steve didn’t seem to mind and Tony found, while still mildly concerned, didn’t give them much thought. Steve was still holding his hand, was still smiling and wasn’t taking back his words.
Bruce just waved it away. “Don’t look at me like that, especially when your hair is all tousled. Ruins the effect when you have bed head.”
Not wanting to keep the alpha waiting any longer Tony got to work unbuttoning his own pants. It was awkward doing so while still straddling the alpha’s lap, but when his length sprung free he bit back a moan as Steve made a soft noise of appreciation and gently grasped it, running a finger over a visible vein. He groaned out loud when Steve maneuvered his hold to grab both their erections together and stroked. The difference in their size obvious when put next to each other and Tony’s eyes trailed down to Steve’s base where the receded knot was resting. The girth larger than Tony’s own. He couldn’t hold back humping the alpha’s lap after that sight.
All together that giddiness disappeared in an instant.
Tony blushed the moment their hands made contact. “Nothing to apologize for. I’m just sorry you didn’t get to finish your food in peace.”
Hulk nodded before retracting his large arm and holding his paw close to his chest “Puny Runt fine?” He tilted his head curiously.
He rushed to Steve’s room and knocked desperately against it. “Steve.”
“You’re not that old, Tony.”
, Pepper.” Tony didn’t understand. How could they leave their pack just to search for him?
“Thank you for - for -”
You guys have voted and here are the results!
They turned their backs to each other to cover the area. All three standing defensively with their wings expanding slightly in warning. Tony and Pepper gained enough distance to avoid Rhodey accidentally striking them with his poisonous tail. Their own tails flicking back and forth in agitation.
It didn’t sound like a bad life. Perhaps his life expectancy would suffer from living out in the wilds and the possibility of becoming feral could be a real issue, but as long as he was away from Hammer and Obi he’d take anything life would throw at him. Besides, he had Jarvis and Vision. He wasn’t going to be completely alone, just pack-less. He could survive that.
,” Hammer hissed, his face so close now. “You ran off and found yourself a whelp to spread your legs for like the little whore you are. Not only that, you’re now carrying a
Tony didn’t believe he’d get any rest. Not when his body was preparing for a marathon and getting agitated and twitchy. To his surprise, however, the moment he used Steve’s front legs as a pillow time slipped away from him.
While Steve left lingering kisses and marks on his neck Bucky was busy actually inviting Rhodey, Pepper and Happy. “We talked about it and we agreed the three of you would make great additions to the pack. What do you say? You’ll have to put up with
That had them all laughing, lightening the mood. Their laughter seemed to break through Steve for the alpha finally showed signs of life and unconsciously pulled Tony closer to him. Everyone noticed.
He made a noise in the back of his throat. Response ready but unable to say it yet.
“What was that for?” Steve said as he shook his head.
Tony still couldn’t believe this was happening to him. All he managed to say was “L-let me think about it.” The Captain didn't appear to take this answer well. He looked so heartbroken from it. It confused Tony. What reason could he have to have that frown? What was Tony supposed to say? He hadn’t even met the guy yet and falling on the ground didn't count as an official meeting.
Most of all, he’s grateful Tony is still with him and begs with all his might it never happens again.
Steve held tight to him that night. Tighter than usual. Tony understood why. The urge to protect one’s mate from danger was a strong one. For an alpha it hit worse. It went against their very instincts to allow their mates anywhere near it, and Tony could only imagine what was running through Steve’s head at the thought of him joining the journey.
“Never thought a pack would invite me at all.”
Tony watched the interaction, grateful that it had shifted away from him. He guessed since the two betas were seemingly very close they were either mates or very good pack-mates. Either way, they appeared to be enjoying themselves, even if Sam did have a disgusted look expressed for Clint. In his eyes there was fondness but mostly it was obscured from trying to push Clint off, who was now sitting on his lap.
“Anthony! Good morrow. Have you come to join us for the first feast?” Thor said with a smile that was not meant to be in place early in the morning, especially when it was accompanied by a mess of hair that looked to be a bird’s nest.
“You are going to give me a heart attack,” he growled at the unapologetic machine.
An alpha with a very distinctive mustache he just knew was Alpha Dugan eyed him noticeably before a wide grin broke through. “As I live and breathe. It’s true then. Steve finally did go and get himself settled down.” A huge grin broke in his face. “Never thought we’d see the day, Rogers!”
“Guess we’re getting this room. The bird has spoken,” he said to the others.
“There might not be enough room on this table,” Bruce said slowly.
“Nay, should you take a step from this road I shall resort to physical altercations,” said Thor.
and leader of the Avengers, was trying to make small talk with him of all shifters. There were plenty of betas and omegas who probably deserved having the Captain chat them up. Tony couldn’t understand why Steve was even trying with him. All he did was fall face first on the ground in front of the alpha, what was attention worthy?
Was its existence known? Tony couldn’t say. How Hammer and Stane came upon the knowledge was the least of his worries. If the alphas suspected its location was hidden enough from the Avengers then it would be a serious cause for concern. It meant the nearest civilization was miles from there. If Tony were to try and escape while pregnant he would be lucky to see another soul that wasn’t part of Hammer’s pack, let alone run into a town and seek help.
The issue was, Steve looked too genuine and open for it to be all a trick. Some of the Avengers appeared to be too serious to find a childish trick funny, too. They would probably think it a waste of their time when they could be doing something else, like fighting Hydra and saving lives. This was the Avengers, they wouldn’t be wasting their time for nothing, right?
Bracing his elbows down so he could lift himself up Tony was caught off-guard when Steve nuzzled his cold nose against his jaw and trotted off to where the hunters of the morning were gathering without another word.
Now that he had it, he couldn’t imagine himself without it.
“No offense to the Avengers, but maybe them seeing me isn’t a good idea. They could pick up to what everyone is terrified of me for and attack. I’d rather not be known as the omega who killed the most famous war pack around.”
Tony’s breath hitched when he put together where this was heading and what Steve meant.
Tony wondered how many guests that would be. What number were Bruce and him?
“They can help aid against other superhumans. You and Barnes can’t handle everything out there.”
Her eyes softened. It was the subtlest of changes, but Tony was able to catch it. “You’re not the first, trust us. We see it all the time when we have guests over. The few guests that we get, anyhow.”
fight. Probably break a bone lifting something. The Avengers felt sorry for them both.”
” Tony hissed, trying to shush his best friend. He didn’t want his pack to learn anything about his past.
“That’s if we can even reach it without alerting them all,” Sam added. “They patrol on the north and east side of the fort. On the west, there’s a huge drop-off. Once you go down you’ll be easy pickings. On the south the scent of chemicals is strong. Hank thinks there are explosives buried in the ground and ready to mix inside containers the moment you step on them.”
Once was too many already, but for the sake of letting Bruce do something for their moon run Tony was going to allow it. He just hoped Bruce went easy on the scare. Tony already had years of his heart feeling heavy and skipping beats. He would rather avoid them if possible.
Steve shook his head. “I’m fully armored right now. You really think I’m going to be breaking records in this state?”
Hammer wanted something worth his time. Tony would give it to him.
“You’re such a softy. Were you always like this?”
Tony sighed and gripped his best friend’s shirt. “Tell them something… please.” The words of an alpha were stronger than an omega.
Tony had to be extra careful not to accidentally stare at. They had
No worries! Keep an eye out for the sneak peek over at my tumblr.
Tony had once upon a time been familiar with these remedies, back when he had been healthy and young enough to have natural heats. Then those remedies soon changed from suppressants to boosters when he found his body unable to naturally produce heats anymore. These boosters were meant to aid his body and bring forth his times, but they hardly took, leaving him devastated more often than not, and when they
that had Steve eying up and down. The odd urge to
Tony might have gotten a temper from that. While he understood Steve posturing against Rhodey, another alpha, he didn’t get how Steve could posture against Pepper, a beta who was mated with Happy and, as his name would say, she was very happy about it.
“There’s so much more you could create with iron and fire. More than just items to sell and hurt people. Equipment that can help with everyday life, aid with work, create new and improved tools, make a better future, the possibilities are endless. It’s not that I didn’t want to create weapons, I just wasn’t interested in them. I wanted to…”
The tears were back, but not from sadness. Steve slid down from his bed and hit his knees on the ground, embracing Tony and holding him close.  “I love you. I love you so much, Tony. I love you.”
Tony had believed washing along the alpha would have been awkward, or at least an odd experience. Not used to sharing time with others in the care of their bodies, for after a while Hammer had just ordered him to handle it and clean up on his own, Tony hadn't expected much in a sense of ‘comforting.’ Yet having Steve here lathering his own body and managing to casually sit naked behind him without even the slightest hint of it being sexual was strangely... warming. Made him experience new emotions.
, he reasoned and slid his hand down to grasp the base of his member. Commonly small in omegas, but he had no one to compare averages. He gave it three strokes to get it fully erect, then thought better of his stance and kneeled down to prevent any slipping. A few more strokes and he realized the arousal was slowly disappearing. If he didn’t finish this now he was going to find himself frustrated for the rest of the day. A bit desperate he began maneuvering and twisting and stroking, even fondling his small sack, but found himself nowhere near to a climax.
“Jan…”
“They’re frozen,” Peggy pointed at Pepper’s arm that had a water droplet sliding down. “They’re frozen and melting fast and they’re very much alive.”
“I didn't want you all to put up with my scent. I thought I was sparing everyone.”
Damage and issues and progress, oh my!
The offer to join the Avengers pack and to possibly have Steve Rogers, the
Loki held him close with one arm. "All of Yule? Every single day?”
Eventually only the knot remained as the only evidence of what they had just done. That plus Steve’s burning seed and his own slick that had turned cold on his skin and made him feel uncomfortably sticky. What he would give for a bath on that moment. Then his stomach decided to remind him of his earlier problem and the reason why he had woken up in the first place. Because Steve had one of his hands splayed over his belly he not only heard it he felt it as well.
, Steve. Leave me alone and let me - let me -”
A little girl, no older than five and surrounded by adults openly talking about their title as omegas, was pointing at them. Awe and curiosity in her eyes. Besides her stood a woman that radiated alpha and held her chin high. “They’re just there to care for the pack, sweetheart. They watch over the den.”
“Walking, huh?” Sam chuckled. “
Tony’s thoughts were brought back when Steve grabbed hold of his erection. The alpha was balancing himself now, hovering right over it, lining himself up. “My favorite,” Steve said a little breathless, “my favorite thought is you. Sitting on my shield with nothing on. Slicking it up as you touch yourself. My name on your lips.”
Tony followed him with hope in his steps. If there was even the slightest chance of joining the trip Rhodey was the best choice to make it happen. It was still one opinion against nine others, however. If the chance were to even make it on the table Rhodey had to choose his words carefully.
“You had a human?” Tony began retreating back from the threatening stance.
His slicing revealed a stony wall decorated in patterns and holes that created the whistling sound. With his hands soaked in plant dew he placed them over the patterns, feeling the rise of stone that outlined it under his calloused hands and giving a clear view of his sharp claws to the world. With a deep breath he pushed against the wall with all his might but the stone remained stubborn and refused to budge. He gave three more attempts, grunting louder with each push, but the stone stayed in place.
“Hey, Captain, are you back to us?” Clint said, patting his arm in congratulations. “You have a busy future ahead of you. I don’t envy you both.”
He wanted to go
Odin and old St. Nick might have been the faces, but Tony was the operator and he had grown to handle it all on his own with little help.
Some time during the walk Steve sneaked closer to press his flank against Tony’s and had their tails intertwined together. The equivalent of hand holding as wolves. The warmth that seeped through into Tony’s fur was pure delight and reassurance and he knew, trusted, that anything the world threw at them at that moment, Steve would protect them with every fiber of his being.
Steve returned a whine of his own. Equally high and silent and carrying a response.
Steve’s ears perked up. “Well, I hold no promises.”
Tony’s heart jumped. If they were to cross the sea… then the Avengers would truly never find him.
Hammer was ready to argue but must have seen Stane’s point. He exhaled and took a moment to calm himself and regain his insufferable demeanor of before.
From where they sat Pepper and Happy sent Tony questioning looks, clearly confused about what was going on. Tony shrugged at them in a gesture of “yes, this happens a lot, try and get used to it.” The pair nodded slowly, getting comfortable for the show.
Just Tony’s luck that their entire pack were present, wide awake and livelier than Jarvis when he’d found an entire, untouched tree full of nuts. They were all gathered in the common room, relaxing and dressed for the day. Every available spot to sit were taken. Every available soul in the house were present. Every available word Tony did
Eventually, the barriers made themselves known. The hundreds of gathered bodies made it pretty obvious, but the wires that marked and separated the spectators and the racers were impossible to see. The moment Tony spotted even the smallest glimpse of the wire he made his move, rushing forward to grab the spot for himself and Peter.
Bucky was down to a cloth and quickly took it off. “Clint you’re coming with us.”
The sight of the cart made Tony blink. How much were they going to obtain for them to need a cart? Then again, how far away was the town? He was to carry a set of clothing and if the walk was a long one he’d end up getting tired of holding his purchase. The cart was probably a good idea.
Jarvis turned to him. “I shall take that as a compliment, Sir.”
There was no Hammer to intimidate him now and Clint was freely showing and flexing, causing Tony’s eyes to trail every movement and... he couldn’t look away at the display. The body structure was so different to that of Hammer’s and Tony wanted to curiously drink in every detail. Then he made the mistake of trailing up the torso to Clint’s face and ended up locking eyes with him. Clint was smirking, having noticed Tony looking and
Tony tried sounding equally offended and added a gasp. “I would never. The very thought.”
He just didn’t know what he was going to say to Steve. What would Steve think of him wearing nightclothes for their walk? That he was uncaring, perhaps? Wasn’t taking him seriously? Wasn’t putting the effort? With Tony’s luck he’d end up somehow insulting Steve and then causing the alpha to reconsider pursuing him. To realize there were other better options out there.
“I fed and watered him and I believe I left him satisfied, but I can make sure with another round, just in case,” Steve said with a cheeky grin.
Rhodey moved away without command, allowing Steve to curl up against Tony from behind. He continued rubbing away once settled, wanting to comfort and settle worries.
It was survival of the fittest. In Tony’s case especially so. He may have been old but that didn’t mean Tony wasn’t light on his feet. He wasn’t walking around with a stick and he wasn’t sitting for hours on end nursing his tired bones. He could still run, he just wasn’t the fastest compared to all these shifters with less years on their backs. He couldn't last long chasing prey with the way his chest constricted. He could still hunt, more or less. He could hunt as well as a wolf shifter could hunt on his own with his health issues, but considering he was hunting in territory occupied by dozens and dozens of young, packless shifters his chances were limited. Most would have already caught their game and scared the rest away by the time he reached hunting grounds. Tony was lucky if he managed to catch three rabbits.
Tony and Bruce shared one last look again. This was it.
“What’s wrong?” Steve said the moment he noticed Tony’s attitude change. “Was it Clint? Did he make you uncomfortable? I’ll talk to him if he did.”
happen!” Steve’s voice suddenly rose in anger, startling him a little. “What kind of pack just let’s one of their own
No, Tony shouldn’t push it. Steve was already grooming him. He shouldn’t ask for more. He was content with just Steve settling his fur. It was the most he had gotten regarding affectionate physical contact in years. It was enough.
Maybe he was shaking, maybe he wasn’t, he couldn’t be sure, but it was overwhelming and a little voice in the back of his head was shouting at him to say yes, to be selfish and get what he’d always wanted. It was right before him.
It earned him a fond smile. “First things first. You’re going to have to remove your sleepwear. That shirt won’t offer much protection and this armor isn’t going to be nice to it.”
“They were a bit ridiculous,” Bucky admitted.
The truth of it was, Tony did have more control than this. He always had control for when Hammer released the harshest of words at him, but he always prepared beforehand. He hadn’t expected for Loki to do the same and so the tears caught him off guard.
“I know. Pepper can be vicious when she wants to be.”
Steve nipped Tony's neck, right on the spot where a mark would be placed, a silent promise of what he was to do later when they were alone. “I'll run after you again later. Promise.”
There was a faint whisper. “I’m sorry.”
No one dared argue. In fact, no one seemed to know what to say. They all stared in wonder at him. Not understanding
A pause. “Yeah, I could. With the other guy it seems almost fitting that I belong with a war pack. At least this way if I ever lose control in the middle of civilians I’ll have a war pack nearby to stop me. If the famous Avengers can’t put him down, then who could?”
Tony blinked. “Future plans?” That implied many things. Was Steve already planning ahead of his future in regards to their pups? Long before Tony had ever known?
Tony basked in the second kiss his alpha offered, eyes closing in a flutter. “What promise?”
“I’ve got a shot,” Hawkeye says, aiming the gun at Steve. “Better get back.”
From his shoulder he could feel Jarvis leaning in, staring at the stone in wonderment. Vision, too, was staring. His own rune glowing as if responding to the magic.
“Whatever you’re thinking, it’s not true, Bruce.”
“Has anyone told you to work on your pep talks, Jarvis?”
That was all before Howard had passed away and Stane had gotten his hands on him and the deal with Hammer had taken. Years under their care had truly left him with more than his physical scars. He would probably never fully recover after them.
Jarvis didn’t look convinced, but thankfully he didn’t push it further. “As you wish, Sir. Breakfast, perhaps? I believe I heard some of the members of our new pack up and about for the day. Shall we join them?”
“You think you smell… horrible?”
Tony nodded, but he knew it wasn’t all. There was more. There was always more. “She didn’t look to have ended it.”
He was not setting a great example as Steve’s mate.
“They wouldn’t -” but then again how would Tony know? He wasn't familiar with any of the members or how they acted or how they thought. The moment they smell something off with Bruce they could jump and strike without a second thought. “You may have a point.”
The beta named groaned. “Come on, don’t do this to me. I’m your favorite, remember?”
Rhodey was still glaring and made the barest of growling noises but ultimately he was thinking it through. “What do you say?” he asked Pepper and Happy.
His chest ached. He wanted his alpha.
Nearly all at once everyone howled to the sky and Tony soon joined them after his second skin and his fur took full form. He howled loud and howled until all the air left his lungs and then nearly jumped in surprise when a roar accompanied their howls. The roar could have only come from Thor and the image of a lion roaring with a pack of canines was something Tony needed to see. He rounded the tree he hid himself behind and admired the view of his pack mates all facing upwards, standing tall and proud and howling and roaring together.
“Then I’ll give myself a well-deserved smack for hurting his feelings.”
“No need. You’ve done nothing wrong,” Steve hummed. “You’re still up for taking the walk with me?”
The alpha turned to the carcass and began eating, chewing away at what he could in reasonable time. Tony, still holding the leg, turned to look at where Bruce was sitting. It was a mistake to do because the omega was smirking at him, eyebrows raised in expectation, and he wasn’t the only one. Everyone was grinning in their own way, nodding and approving. Clint went beyond that and started wagging his canine brows suggestively. Vision added to it by creating a noise that resembled a whistle.
“With suggestions like those, of course I will.”
“Plain luck I guess.”
That… was interesting. From the sounds of Steve’s past exploits, he appeared nitpicky, or perhaps mindful, of who he claimed as a mate. Had he avoided the subject of marking all together in the past? Strange, for he had been so willing when Tony mentioned the idea the first time.
bad!”
“You look breathtaking, Tony! I almost didn’t recognize you at all.”
“I’m twenty-four years old, Sir. I am hardly considered an infant.”
Steve is finally going to reveal what he's been smelling this whole time.
The second shadow, that to his horror he later learned was Bucky, shoved his flesh arm into Steve’s path while his metal one held him back. Bucky redirecting the attack meant for Sam to himself, defending his mate and ready to risk his only good arm left to keep Sam safe.
“But an
Tony perked up. “Everyone, this is the Hulk. Hulk, this is everyone.” Hulk grunted as a show of hello when Tony lifted a paw to gesture towards him. “He may look grumpy and scary but don’t let that fool you. He’s a softy on the inside.”
“You know what this calls for?” Clint suddenly said, looking at Sam with a glint in his eye.
Tony didn’t think he would have a good night, considering what was to come the following morning. After this night his search for a new pack would begin and the odds of that happening were not in his favor. For one, he had age against him. He was in his forties and not exactly the healthiest he's ever been. He was well past his physical usefulness to the pack when it came to fighting or even traveling. He could hardly walk long distances without getting winded now or carry heavy weights without straining his back. On top of that, he was also an omega and omegas were typically used to show-off as a prize or mother hen the pack. On rare occasions, omegas could join along the pack in battles, but the pack usually preferred having the omegas safe and sound and away from the danger.
“Declarations of love aside, you should really go to him,” Jan suggested. “The poor fellow is going to think the worst and damage could be done if it’s not stopped soon. Don’t worry. We’ll stay down here and give you all the privacy. Just try not to break through the ceiling.”
be alone.”
. That they would treat him as if he was worth something, treat him as if he was someone to be cherished, to dote on, or even just to hold closely. Just be
Keep on smiling and have a great day!
Perhaps it was selfish of him to do so. Perhaps it was a fool's hope. Realistically, he had no control over another's desire. If Steve wanted one more, or a couple more, nights with an old love, who was Tony to stand in the way?
What was it about him that had caught Steve’s attention? He had to wonder. If not an elaborate joke as Tony had originally thought, then what did Steve see in him? Couldn’t have been because of his personality. The alpha barely knew him, and three days wasn’t a substantial enough time to know a person and all their traits. Possibly his looks? For all Tony knew, Steve might have a type. Maybe older omegas was what the alpha found attractive? The wrinkles and the white and dark of his hair was what Steve looked for.
Many others had done the same, celebrating with parents or the parents of partners. The whole team wasn’t here, but those absent still came and wished them a ‘happy holiday’ and dropped off their gifts, snagging some snacks and promising to stop sometime to check the damage later.
Whatever was said after was lost to him. His mind raced at the lack of knowledge he seemed to have. Was it a recent deal? Perhaps, but that didn’t explain why nobody reacted to the news at all. Not even Bruce. Was this old information? Why hadn’t he been told beforehand? Surely they would have thought to inform him about a future pack travel through the land. Had they simply forgotten? But Rhodey, Pepper and Happy were told and they had only recently joined. So just him? Why just him?
How did he feel? In all honesty, he felt scared, terrified of what his future with his pack would be, of his relationship with Steve now that the alpha was aware of Tony’s infertile nature, and of what years with nothing only for his heat to return meant. He also felt hot and felt his body become irritable thanks to his cycle. He had forgotten about the itch that only a partner could scratch and the sweat the warmth brought with it.
Tony eyed the fruits hungrily and seeing as the fish still weren’t done he threw all reasoning for not accepting the offered food out and reached for a peach. He couldn’t stop the moan that escaped him when the sweet taste filled his mouth. It had been a while since he last ate a peach. The things were glorious.
Tony, even shifted, still wore his clothes that were not meant to accommodate the shape of a wolf. Baggy and trapping him slightly they were awkward to take off, but eventually with Steve’s help he was able to tuck Jan’s gift to the side and lie down with his belly exposed for Steve to continue. The alpha seemed to be enjoying doing so. Not once grimacing or acting as if the affection was a chore. On a few occasions Tony would feel his own paws and hind legs twitch without his control when Steve groomed certain spots on his neck. It just felt so good, and it had been so long since someone had properly groomed him. He never wanted it to end.
“Of course you were not. You were just
Jan bumped her snout against the top of his head. “You just gave yourself away. Stop playing possum.”
“I don’t know how to feel about that.” While the idea of Loki capable of making himself or anyone he chooses absolutely invisible (senses wise), the thought of the benefits a silencing cast could do for certain noisy items or noisy armors could really aid for everyday life and battles. He could make it so runes could obscure noise and place them on his gauntlets or his anvil or even Vision for when running was the last option and his little machine required to be hidden.
Vision chirped before the two blue lights dimmed and disappeared. The yellow rune still glowing on his head.
“Come on, Bruce, you really believe that last one? I met the big guy and the last thing he looked like he wanted to do was hurt me.”
know this.”
- please, just
“Tell me, Anthony, do you truly believe you are the only one with a skill worth demanding of? Is my spells not worth a mention? Janet’s skill in attires? Her mate’s skill in alchemy? Clinton’s archery? Steven’s handling of the shield? The idiot feline’s skill to manipulate lightning?” Loki named off in a bored and unimpressed tone, making Tony slowly realize what he was doing with every skill mentioned. “You are special, yes, but you are not the most unique, not with this pit. There will be no difference should the others discover of your skills, but if you wish to keep secrets from them be my guest.”
to the public.
Tony felt movement to his left. A sure sign that Bruce was awake as well. “If you wanted more room you could’ve just told me, Tony.” And yeah, that was Bruce, awake and drinking in the sight of Tony being straddled by a giant wolf.
“I’m holding your hand,” Steve answered as if it was that simple. He even appeared confused by the question. “Unless you don’t want me to. I’m sorry, I should’ve asked first. I just wanted to…” Steve acted sheepish. “ I didn’t want them to say things without knowing what’s really going on.”
“It’s better he explain it to you. It’s important stuff that’s meant to be between the two of you.”
“Then think on it. Work is yours if you want it. Just show up and we’ll work out the kinks of our agreement. Days you’ll come in and what you accept and what you don’t. No need to worry you’ll be working on some shady business.”
“Probably not.” From where he landed Steve ended up with his face right over Tony’s chest. His ear right over his heart. He made a soft noise as he took a couple of seconds to just listen before he picked himself up and off. “Come on. Time to dress you for the trip.”
“Long enough for Clint to come searching for you.”
Rhodey stared at the golden alpha skeptically, probably noticing the two personalities. Pepper and Happy were hesitant, naturally not wanting to make the first move considering this was a much larger
But what if it was not? The way Hammer’s face had gone dark after he sniffed near Tony’s neck. That was no act. There was no reason for the alpha to react so violently. Not unless the words he spoke were true.
“Traitors,” Tony barked at them, his heart still racing. “The lot of you betraying me like this.”
The kid looked at him, giving him a wide gaze, completely opened, and showed very large blue eyes that made Tony feel exposed. Tony cleared his throat and was about to excuse himself and leave when out of nowhere the child patted his cheek and said, “when I’m grown you’re going to be my omega.”
“Sure do,” Clint said.
“Jarvis,” Tony nearly whined. This was his first trip to town and he didn’t want to embarrass the Avengers more than he already did.
Tony’s hand shook without his consent and he knew he probably had the beginnings of an omega smelling of fear. He closed his eyes instinctively. He learned long ago with Hammer and Obie that if an alpha was angry they would lash out, either physically or verbally, and the instinct to cower when it happened was something not even Tony could fight against. Hammer enjoyed the smell of fear he would release. It usually appeased him enough to spare Tony from the blunt of his words and his backhand. It was something Tony relied on in order to lessen the pain, even if it happened against his will and purely on instinct.
“That’s a bit of an exaggeration. I only ever got knocked over twice by a strong gust of wind.”
He clenched his teeth. It never happened. It
going to help.” With a wave of his fingers, the two beta guards standing the closest moved in quick succession, grabbing Pepper by her arms and covering her mouth with a cloth. She kicked and shoved against her captors, struggling in their hold. Tony made a grab for them, ready to bite their disgusting meat hooks off her when Hammer lunged forward in an uncharacteristic move. He seized Tony’s arm harshly with one hand and held him by the neck with his other. In a panic, Tony tried yanking off the offending arm on his neck but it only served to cause him harm. No doubt creating a bruise. Hammer squeezed tighter in warning, making it worse.
Bruce hummed. “I do know that, just like I know that you thinking about something so deeply is a dangerous thing.”
. He didn’t need to turn around to see who’s arm was wrapped protectively around his middle. He could smell it all around him. The wonderful smell that could only come from Steve. In the air, the soft furs he lied on, the pillow he rested on, the smell coming in herds behind him along with the warmth of the alpha’s body plastered on his back. If he were to take a deep enough breath he could note the smell of himself mixed in with Steve’s scent, almost as if making a claim on the alpha.
“What problem are you referring to?” the feathers on the cockatoo rose in agitation, already offended by Tony’s behalf.
The silence that followed showed just how disciplined the pack truly was, something Tony had yet to see until on that moment. He had gotten so used to the pack’s silly banter and his packmates’ personalities and the good-natured comebacks that he never bothered to stop and think exactly how the dynamics of the pack worked outside the den. They may be playful, they may share more than necessary sometimes and help each other where they could, but they were still a war pack, and war required controlled behavior, orders and a good leader to gain victory.
Still, the nagging feeling that perhaps, just perhaps, their new pack mates might have been a tiny bit annoyed by them slowing down their travels wouldn’t leave him, and the urge to do what little he could to please them began rearing its ugly head. It was Hammer all over again. The desire to do everything he could to make him, or the pack, happy and failing miserably because he either didn’t do enough or he didn’t know what to do and left them all unsatisfied.
“Only for you, Sir.”
The heartbroken look Tony must have had from having his fruit stolen triggered Steve to quickly snatch another and push it in his uninjured hand before snuggling even closer, if possible. Tony waved a fist at Jarvis then took a bite of the peach for show.
“Loki,” Rhodey growled from deep in his chest. “I’m warning you.”
, too.
“As you’ve said for the last 34 rounds. One day you shall be victorious, Sir. I have faith.”
“What? You’re not even going to try my cooking before deciding you don’t like it?” Sam placed two more additional plates on the table. This time for Thor and Loki. He gave Tony a stern look. “Don’t break my heart like that.”
What have you been enjoying of it?
“I-I’m still sorry, about not telling anyone where I went. I wasn’t leaving the pack, I swear. There was another reason why I left for town.”
Tony directed his glare to the omega.
Jarvis whistled in agreement before curling up and nesting again on Bruce’s shoulder. Tony adjusted Vision on his hip and began the walk back to the shacks with wobbly legs and a limping strut. There was no way it didn’t go unnoticed and, just as Tony was learning to expect after hanging out with the Avengers for the day, Steve automatically went to his side with a concerned face and said “Are you alright to walk? We can wait for you,” keeping character.
With his heart on the verge of beating out of his chest, Tony slowed down, looked back just in case, and took shuddering and concerning breaths. He didn’t dare rest and kept going in a more sedated pace until he found Vision and Bruce. Vision was the first to reach him, beeping and worried for the evident state Tony was in. Bruce came next, kneeling down and holding Tony’s head up to examine his eyes and his neck, then his back, chest, and legs. That was how Tony found out that Bruce wasn’t just a man of science, but was also a doctor on the side.
It was always about earning as many favors in a short span of time. Packs never remained long and first impressions were important. If you couldn't catch a single lead alpha's eye you were going to be left far behind.
Tony flinched at that. “I-I’m so -”
“You’d be right, Mister Rogers,” Jarvis confirmed. “Sir simply enjoys taking content out of proportion. He thrives on it.”
it. Against
helpful or discreet.
“It's nothing,” Tony said hoarsely, cursing when his voice cracked a little.
“I’ll join if you do,” Bruce answered simply, as if it was the only natural response.
He hoped he didn’t overstep. “Maybe,” he tried for cheeky. Having the courage for it and wondering where that courage went last night.
“But -”
Perhaps including Sharon in their relationship was the better idea. The two of them together would never forget anything important involving Steve. They would help each other. At least, he'd hope. He’d have to eventually talk to Steve about it. Search for the positives and find a little happiness instead of letting it simmer and grow into poison from his… jealousy. Steve did want them both to talk more if emotions were high. He wanted them to have trust. Trying was the least Tony could do.
to him. Tony had turned around in bafflement and saw all the alphas glaring at the poor blacksmith while also trying to fit inside together to create a threatening wall of upset shifters. It was certainly a sight.
If only he could manage to without shivering under Stane’s icy glare. If looks could inflict pain, Tony would be on the ground with bruises, scratches and broken bones. Not a single inch of his body would be untouched.
Steve looked on with worry. “Tony?”
No one in his old pack lent him a shoulder to cry on back when he had really needed it. They probably hadn’t even realized the distress he had been going through at the time. More relieved than anything at the lack of ‘
He started slowly backing away from the door. In his haste to get to the food he had forgotten that he was the newcomer, the recently added pack member, and he had no right to just waltz in and demand a share of the breakfast, especially when it was someone else who cooked it. He was also not invited. Maybe one of the three sitting on the table didn’t want his presence there. Maybe they didn’t want additional mouths to fight against for their share. No, he was to wait for his turn, just as he was always required to wait with his old pack. He was looking out for them by letting them eat their fill. Hammer always said by letting their pack eat first he was making sure they were healthy and strong. The beta guards were protecting him, the least he could do was allow them to eat until their heart was content.
Tony shook his head. The last thing he wanted was for Steve to become a bloodthirsty murderer or any of their packmates for that matter. No one would survive carrying a target on their backs by the Avengers. They went after Hydra packs, raiders, ambushers, killers and more
“I know. I believe you,” he said one more time. If he listened hard enough he almost swore it true. There might even be confidence in the statement.
“Will you join our pack and let me court you?” The fond look was back. “This isn't me playing around. I truly wish to.”
Then cry even louder when Bruce -
“No, no, I meant, get a bigger gun because we’re running in head first and we’re going to mow them down.”
“I’m sorry.”
Bruce was also here, but just like Clint was out cold. He was among the first if Steve remembered correctly. Instead of a couch though, Bruce was piggybacking on Thor, who refused to let him go. Bruce slept through everything Thor was doing. Laughing, shouting, boasting, moving around, Bruce wouldn’t wake but he also didn’t fall. Thor kept a good grip on him and at one point started parading the doctor around, proudly stating, “This is my doctor!” to anyone who would listen.
“Uh, fool?”
“The noise you made,” Steve said, and even with his voice muffled Tony could note the raspiness of it, equally overused as his own. “It was adorable.”
He reeled back in shock. The extent of their action now just hitting him.
hurt to know he was apparently worth nothing that his own alpha treated him lower than dirt.
He never did live that day down, though. Not the greatest “How did you get together?” story. Not when Tony kept retelling it as a “Steve wouldn’t let go. I couldn’t say no.”
“Something on your mind, again?”
“If I am?” The tone she carried - Tony couldn’t tell if it was her attempt at teasing and having a layer of seriousness under it, or if he just wasn’t used to her style of banter.
The Captain’s team had been discovered and the enemies were about to engage.
, alphas weren’t doing it, but the gesture couldn’t have been that old. Time couldn’t have moved that fast. They looked to be in their late twenties only.
High pitched long noise.
Awestruck, Tony grabbed the leg and avoided getting the mess on his hand, cluelessly holding it up. “T-thank you.”
Rhodey and Pepper gave him dead looks, both unconsciously stiffing their bat and feathery wings. The wings expressed more than what their faces and body revealed and all three had learned overtime to always keep an eye on them to see what they were truly thinking and feeling. Tony found it to be extremely helpful in figuring out what his comrades were thinking but at the same time he found it to be an attack because it went both ways and they were more than willing to always point out his stance from the way his wings shifted.
It was almost too good to be true. Tony could decide? “So I just come any day?”
He remembers being shot at, his body twitching at each impact, but not the pain. He remembers their weak attempts with their electric batons that had no effect. He remembers watching some flee for their lives. Watching them like a predator toying with its prey. None escaped.
Instead of denying Loki and calling his bluff, everyone in the room except for Tony and Bruce and Natasha appeared uneasy, and Tony was positive if they all had their tails and ears out they’d be down and in-between their legs.
“Steve….”
As more and more Hydra shifters broke through Clint’s defenses the realization that, perhaps, the blond beta was hard of hearing and required them to be his ears came to light. Considering Tony had known Clint for more than half a year and never once suspected the beta had a disability, the revelation was shocking, to say the least. It changed nothing of what Tony thought of the beta except gain a newfound respect for him. To fight with such a potentially fatal disability in battle and still come out on top, to be part of a war pack known for their many victories and never looked upon as a hindrance, for the very Captain to rely on him and never hesitate with the safety of the pack. It was something hardly ever seen. It was something that absolutely deserved praise and he had to wonder if Clint had ever received his due.
A soft noise escaped from Tony when Steve placed a hand on his side. “Shouldn’t I be the one to pin you down?” He had been the one staring, after all.
“Anthony, you simply must try it,” Thor encouraged.
No he wasn’t, and neither was Bruce, but why did Steve want to know that? Did he really want to stay near Tony, or was this still part of his efforts to pull the prank on him?
One of the heads barked in laughter, “You have been chosen to be the dragon’s new body and yet you know nothing of it. I had expected many things from the dragon’s choice but I am greatly disappointed by this. You are of no challenge to me. Neither you nor your bird and cat pets.”
“Really,” Clint moved forward, and maybe Tony was imagining things but he could’ve sworn Clint was purposely standing with his hind legs out, posing and showing them off. “We should get together sometime to go over it with you. We’ll give you all the juicy details.”
Both Tony and Bruce stopped what they were doing and looked around. They noted how the other betas and omegas were tripping over themselves trying to head to the same direction. They spoke as if someone incredible was present in the shacks, but who exactly was worth all the hype for?
Send them your love and thanks if you enjoyed the glimpse I gave and wanted more.
“Hurry, Uncle Ben!”
“Pompous feline,” Loki muttered.
When the crowd began to grow smaller in size, Tony knew they were nearing the finish line. All the wandering bodies were gathered near the barriers, hoping to see the racing centaurs. Which meant Tony had room to breathe momentarily.
Hank shouldn’t be the one to apologize. Tony should. It had all been his fault. He needed to talk to Hank alone.
Steve couldn’t wait.
“If we do it your way we’ll never get anywhere.”
and I can’t even talk to her because you keep doing this. It’s not - it’s not
Jarvis and Vision were safely tucked next to each other under the shade of a tree not that far from Bruce. The cockatoo bowed his head once and the little machine spun in place in acknowledgement upon seeing Tony and catching his eyes. Mischief was clear in their stances.
Bile threatened to rise to his throat. He should've run faster. He should've brought his gauntlets with him. He should’ve sent Jarvis to fly and get help for him. He should’ve done more to prevent this, but he didn’t. He
Met before? Tony would have remembered running into that alpha. He had that bigger than life image about him that couldn’t be forgotten.
To think the Avengers had set up their home so close to Hattan. All those opportunities where he could’ve had the chance to meet them earlier. Maybe, if that had happened, he could’ve escaped from Hammer sooner and Steve could’ve been interested in him with less years on his back. That was if Steve still had the same interests back then.
“You are misguided who the miniature one is.”
to us. It was something we were used to, a pack we understood, but if someone were to make us choose between a pack full of wolves that cared for nothing but their next trade, or a very dear friend we love with all our hearts, you can bet your tail we would choose you. Don’t act surprise, Tony.”
When Fury mentioned their new mission was going to take place in an isolated location in Sweden, the most deserted place possible, Steve had expected a sort of desolation place with dead plants and visible dried, brown dirt stretching for miles and miles. What he didn’t expect was a sunny sight with grass and healthy trees and… was that a deer prancing away? Anything but this, yet it was exactly what he was seeing.
A few armor alterations, including those for Pepper and Happy, and his whole pack was ready. From what Tony had been able to study while on the road, he adjusted each piece of equipment to each packmates specifications. From Steve’s infuriating instinct to throw his shield at his targets, down to Bucky’s habit to hit enemies with the stock of his rifle.
have that. His mate was in danger and he was willing to fight to the death.
her, but I could never give her all of me. Not when a part of me was already given. I couldn’t completely let go or forget that part. We agreed to end it when I proved too stubborn.”
“What are you three doing here?” Tony had to ask because, while he was overjoyed,
“Sounds ridiculous,” Jarvis huffed. Vision mimicked the sentiment. “Why keep such things to yourself? Mister Rogers has clearly expressed his desires openly, why should you not?”
Against his will Tony let out a watery chuckle. “I love you, too, you feathery little menace.”
Not all questions needed an answer and sometimes the answer was the simplest thing.
The python hissed with glee. “None can best the mighty Loki,” the serpent mocked.
him. For some reason or another, however, Steve didn’t push forward, didn’t ask further about his past. He simply held Tony closer and tucked his nose in his neck. He pushed against Tony, prompting Tony to lie on his back and have who-knows-how-many pounds of young alpha resting his upper body on his chest.
He didn’t hit the floor. Rogers still had him against the wall and kept him there. Rogers’ own heavy breathing was loud. Harsh. Tony could see his chest rise and fall from the extortion. Then Tony noticed Rogers’ arms were no longer holding him but instead were against the wall. One rested on it while the other was through it, creating a hole and adding more work for Tony.
Tony was about to retort, but it seemed the alpha had heard Bruce because he looked behind to them with an honest to God hopeful smile. “I’ll be happy to, should Tony allow me, but I don’t think it’s necessary. I get the feeling it’ll take more than Vision dancing on you for it to happen.”
“We heard,” Jan said for them all. “You left your pack and traveled the land to search for Tony. Anyone who does that for their friend is fine and dandy in my book. I approve of you three.”
“Soon. Let’s get some food in you,” Steve said as if reading his mind.
“You’re all safe.”
With a growl the head that acted as the leader said, “Let us end this. Let the beasts free and end your humanity. You have no anchor here. Nothing will keep you fighting. Let us finish this!”
That remained true even when the Stark pack disbanded and they were forced to find a new business pack. But now, under Rhodey’s command, they looked so carefree compared to the past. Open hand holding, a kiss on the cheek here and there, an exchange of loving smiles. The most affection Tony had ever seen in one week than the years he had known them.
- not unless
“Sir?” His heart skipped a beat at the sound of the cockatoo. “The cakes look especially delectable. Perhaps we should remain and indulge ourselves? With your permission, of course.” The last part was aimed at the two nearest betas.
I'd really love to know what you're all thinking so far of this fic and what you're looking forward to. Do take a few minutes to do so please.
“Yes -
At the same time Steve nearly shouted a “I’ll do it, Sir.”
There was only one way to get his answers and that was to walk right back to the alpha, and there was no way Tony was doing that. Never again. He was perfectly fine with never seeing the alpha or his pack again. One experience was good enough, thank you.
“Oh? How are you going to keep me here, big guy? Steve won’t stand for violence.”
“I do,” an agent pipes up.
Steve pulled back. His ears were low and his eyes were wide. As if he was just as surprised as Tony about their situation.
“Ready?” Steve ran his fingers over Tony’s inner thigh, making him shiver.
He grabbed the very gauntlet on top. Heavier than he remembered, but already he was running alterations through his head to make them lighter yet sturdier at the same time. If he were to add a sharper edge on the surface he could shift the gauntlet to include physical combat as well. With a rune to keep it permanently sharpened and another to make it as durable as steel he could easily slice through layers of chain and leather armor without it wearing out.
“Thanks, Dear, your faith in me is really encouraging.”
It was very biased of him to compare. Perhaps many would pick the beta, most with some form of sanity would and Tony wouldn’t blame them, but Steve wasn’t many, and Steve was the only opinion he cared for. It was also unfair of him to
Steve kissed his cheek. “I trust that you’ll get a belly full of food once the others return with the hunt and once you’re full we’re going to head for the creek over there and wash away most of this grime and blood. Then I’m going to lather your wounds in balm.”
“It’s different, I count that as a nickname, and with two James it’s a good thing we have them.”
