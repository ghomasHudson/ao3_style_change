"Yeah, well, we'll see if that's still the way you feel when you have to push something the size of a watermelon out of something the size of a straw."
"Look, I don't expect you to believe any of this. God knows how set in your ways you can be about things, and compared to what you've seen so far, this is probably kind of far-fetched for you. All I can tell you for certain is that, yes, this is your future, as crazy as it looks, and yes, it is awesome."
Was it sweet? Was it creamy? Was it watery? Was it bland? Did it taste healthy or enjoyable?
Steve shrugged and grimaced almost like he was embarrassed. "Yeah," he said and leaned against the counter-top. "There's good and bad things about both ways."
"Got what? No, I don't, whatever it is."
"Not that Steve won't try every angle," Barnes said. "He wants you to be happy. He might annoy the rest of us to get to that point, but he wants you to be happy."

make me her mother. And yes, I happen to think she and I are both very cute looking in our own adorable way, so she's not wrong on that, either."
"Don't care. Just need to shut Steve up."
"It wasn't Barnes that—" she started to say, but Tony groaned.
And that's when Tony saw it —
"Steve."
The practice labor was hard to take seriously because, well, it just

"So, you went off the deep end."
She patted her lap and said, "OK, bring your leg up," which he did, and for the next twenty minutes or so, she worked in relative silence as she went about giving him a pedicure — not just polishing his nails but trimming and shaping them as well. It was as she was blowing on his toes and waving her hand over them to get the first coat to set faster that Tony broke the silence and said, "You know, I think we've just crossed a new boundary in our relationship."
"But is it possible someone could find them?" Steve asked pointedly, and Thor tweaked a grimace before he said, "Obviously. One has already been found. Possibly two."
"No, I mean it," Steve said with a resolute shake of his head. "You never know. It— It's just bad luck. They buy all this stuff for us — for the baby — and then, God forbid, something happens
"How?"
"Don't worry, Stevie," Bucky said with a pat on this back. "It'll all come out in the wash."
"You know," Barton mused, "with most couples, it's,
Now Tony was grumbling about the gift Olivia had gotten from the one he kept calling 'Barton,' calling him names and threatening to make him sleep in the vents and lamenting that someone called 'Laura' should have known better.
"When you're older."
"You didn't want the living room getting a mess, you shouldn't have brought the food in here," Steve said pointedly.
But he just shrugged again. "No big deal. It's for the best, anyway. I mean, should anyone really trust me with kids?"
Steve chuckled and continued his strokes. "Feels good?"

"There was also a cute little 'It's a Girl!' one," Hill said, taking the attention off the recently departed 'Aunt Millie.' "But I thought that might hit a little too close to home for you two."
," in that disappointed way he was so good at.
Tony just preened and called in the direction of the bedroom. "Rhodey thinks I'm pretty!"
Steve just shot him a look as he attached one part of the highchair to another, and Barton said, "I coulda told you that from that mug of hers."
Natasha hummed as she eyed over the job she'd done on Tony's toes and said, "As good an agent as Sharon is, I'm not sure she's up to the job of handling you two by herself."
"What?" Wilson asked and looked at him. "You don't like 'Stevie'?"
Wait, was he thinking about the Cap again? Jesus, maybe he did have a problem.

daughter to show for it. And can you two stand there and say to me you haven't grown closer than ever before because of this experience? No," she said at their exchange of looks, "you can't."
"Actually," Bruce said as Natasha motioned for them all to follow her over to the elevator, "rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck."
"Actually, that last one sounds like fun."
"I mean, I'm still sore as fuck, but — according to Brucie — sutures held up. Didn't…re-tear anything…down there. I mean, truth be told, it

"Fine," he said with a huffy sigh and looked at the clerk. "Got a room we can talk this out in?" He waved them around a corridor after he'd picked up the IDs that were still sitting on the desk.
," Steve cut in.
"Why didn't it bother me?" he asked without preamble.
"My Jane and I do not require the additional assistance that you and the Captain do. I do believe she was there to inquire as to how my Jane and I fare, but—"
Rhodey just exhaled a breath and sat down next to him on the couch. "Yeah, well," he said and picked up the box with the Avengers mobile in it. He looked at it, inspected it, then turned to Tony and said, "Look, the nursery stuff is cute, but please tell me you drew the line at sex toys."
"Tony, we're in
The guy scoffed a bit. "Yeah? Dressed like this?" he said and took a noticeable glance down at Tony's cleavage, rubbing his hands against the tightly-clad denim of his hips. "No one would believe you weren't asking for it."
He opened his eyes and stared at the radio, dropping his hand away from his neck. He listened a few moments then started laughing, full-throated, belly-clutching laughter. He fell back against the coffee table laughing, and he wiped away the old tears of fear that had fallen and got up. A children's song. He'd almost had a heart attack over a children's song!
Steve glanced back at him and grinned. "'cause we're soul mates." He nudged him with his elbow and added, "It's you and me until the end of time, from what it sounds like."
"Then that's all that matters. Now, come on. You can buy me a coffee, and I can pretend I didn't see you buy one for yourself, too."
the hell was going on there that he wasn't understanding?
"Oh, they're my relatives now?"
Steve swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down, and he took a steadying breath and said, "Are you sure?"
Bruce yanked off the tube of blood and stuck another empty one on.
"Yeah, and it was actually fifteen thousand, but I knocked a thou' off the asking price because I'm a nice guy," Barton said.
"Is there a difference?"
Steve just raised an eyebrow at him.
"Don't be ridiculous," Steve muttered and, soon enough, Tony felt the tantalizing sensation of Steve's hand running down the inside of his thigh like he was trying to gain his bearings and see what Tony was up to. He shivered as Steve slid his hand over to his crotch, his hand covering Tony's. He took a gentle hold of Tony's hand and used it to make Tony thrust into himself with his own fingers a few times, and Tony spread his fingers apart to get the stretch he so desperately needed. "I should just do this," he said in a sleep-heavy growl, like he was still waking up but knew exactly what it was he wanted to do. "Make you come like this."
Tony sighed out a breath. "Well, as he's oh-so-eloquently pointed out in the past, he's sucked my cock before. I guess drinking my breast milk is no more disgusting than swallowing down my come. Only time I taste myself like that is when that fucker kisses me right afterwards."
"The point remains. Your first name sounds better with my last name. Wait, is it too late to change?"
Tony was equal parts ashamed and not ashamed to admit that yeah, he kind of wondered what it tasted like. Olivia slurped it down like each feeding was the last taste she'd ever get, and not that he wanted to guzzle down a bottle of it himself, but he just…he
He looked Tony up and down, brow knitted in confusion, and Tony said a husky, "Why, Captain. How forward of you."
," and Tony looked up and said a none-too-quiet, "
Tony just braced himself against the back of the couch and leaned against it, digging his fingers into the plush material, and he closed his eyes and waited for the overwhelming sensation of pain to leave him, counting backwards from one hundred just for
Thor cleared his throat, still toying with Mjolnir as he said, "The Goddess Esmeralda's hexes are unbreachable. I do remember now that she places protection upon each conception that she blesses. It is to prevent it from being undone. The health of the mother is most important to these spells. So long as the mother remains healthy, so, too, shall the child that grows in her womb."
"Which one?"
He expected another shot in the ribs at that, but he got nothing. In fact, he'd noticed the little monster's activity had quieted quite a bit as of late, and he could only presume it was because he'd run out of room in there. Bruce had run some tests the last time he'd been up there and had determined everything was progressing normally, so he wasn't worried on that front.
Steve just shrugged. "That's what he says, anyway," he said but shot Tony a look as though to say,
"Why? Pepper's clearly her mother, and Pep's better with that sort of shit than I am."
He shoved the rest of the powdered jelly into his mouth as Steve said, "They didn't exactly
"Olivia," he countered. "I was waiting for my daughter to come back, not Captain Anachronism."
"Power's been out in the city about eighteen hours now," Natasha said. "Not looking like it's coming back any time soon. Had to set up a food and water station down in the lobby."
He glanced up at Steve pointedly. "I don't even get to choose my own fake name?"
"I still don't understand what your problem with it is," he said as he poured himself a hefty serving of the black liquid god that did not have the power to do
The little girl in the crib started to whine, and just as he was about to make a move to go to her, a voice behind him said, "Oh, no, you don't. I'll take care of the munchkin. You go brush your teeth. I absolutely refuse to give you your real Christmas kiss until you brush your teeth."
," Steve murmured with a slight shake of his head.
"Suck," Steve ordered him.
"Evidently not if we can still hear you," Tony said as the elevator opened, and Tony opened his eyes and saw they were at the lab level. Steve motioned Thor and Barton off, Thor dragging the Iron Man armor with him, before he hit the button for the penthouse.
"Stop," Tony said and stilled running his fingers to gently slap Steve on the side of the head. "Don't even go there. Don't ever say you don't deserve this. You deserve it. Trust me."
But Steve pressed forward and added, “Honestly, I think you’re the one that really keeps this bag of mixed nuts together. You gave us somewhere to live. You give us gadgets and gizmos. You make sure we have everything we could possibly want. I…don’t know if I — if anyone’s — said it enough, but…
"Why?"
much of a waste, but it did seem a bit frivolous to spend so much money on
"Might be handier than you think," he replied, and Tony rolled his eyes and turned to see Steve paging through the book, jaw set and brow furrowed in utmost seriousness.
"OK," Barton said, "but you gotta make sure to get them all out in one breath, otherwise your wish won't come true."
"Yeah," he said with an exhale of breath. "I, um, I always wanted my own studio."
"What are you implying?" Tony asked, though a small, fearful part of him already knew the absolutely impossible answer.
This is a story about a man that gets turned into a woman and gets pregnant by another man that was frozen in ice for 70 years. And yet, this chapter is what causes me anguish because it's just too outlandish for me. No way would the city clerk's office allow this to happen.
"Then go to an actual doctor," Bruce said and pushed past him as he made his way over to one of his computer models. "I'm not a general practitioner. I wouldn't even know what to look for."
And then he'd shrugged like there was nothing he could do about it and took a drink of water from the glass on the table on his side of the bed. Tony watched for a moment then said, "I'm sorry,
"Every kiss begins with Kay," Steve intoned, and Tony glared at him.
"Just get me a coke," he muttered and sat back against his chair, folding his arms tight over his chest.
Forget the danger or the insanity of the situation. Tony wanted this kid, damn it!
"OK," Doctor Ganford said as she hung up the phone. "Serena is going to take you over to the exam room now. We'll go over more of your medical history and what to expect over there. I just wanted to take this opportunity to meet with you and discuss your rather…unique situation. In here, you can be 'Tony.' Out there, you'll be only 'Natasha.' How does that sound?"
He spun around to see his over-seasoned friend standing beside him, and Tony sighed a little and said, "No, just…checking things out."
Bruce made a face and scratched the back of his neck. "I would rather you stay down here. There's at least some equipment here I can use if I need to. Besides it— It's messy, Tony. I mean it can be really, really messy. I don't think you want

"Both of my grandparents. Yeah, Gramps was kind of a blonde, but my

He plastered a tight smile over his face, and Steve reached out and took gentle hold of his chin, tilting his head up just the slightest.
a sore loser," Barnes said and shoved a forkful of eggs in his mouth. Barton, seeming to figure the pissing contest was over, turned to Steve and Tony in confusion. "Wait, your 'best pal'? Then why didn't you go with 'Clint'?"
"Merry Christmas," Steve replied with a smile, and he raised his glass a little, Tony matching him before they clinked the flutes together and pulled back to each take a sip. Well, Tony took a sip. Steve downed his in one gulp.
"Oh."
Wilson ignored him and said to Sharon, "Seriously, do not say anything bad about Cap's princess unless you want him to give you that guilt-inducing Stare of Disappointment."
"So very, very many."
"Look, man," he continued, not unkindly but with a firmness to his words that said he didn't entirely sympathize with Steve, "you broke his heart. Now, I don't know what he was like when you actually said the magical words—"
Tony just rolled his eyes. "Look, it totally makes sense to me."
. The King could take a candleholder to bed, and the Council, neither the Church, would not care much so long as he produced a legitimate male heir to the throne. But the King seemed to have no interest in producing an heir and securing his line and, thus, securing the continued peace and prosperity of the land his father had worked tirelessly to forge into one united kingdom. King Anthony was too busy cavorting with his high chancellor to bother with that.
Steve shook his head and grunted out a negative response as he stuck the orange juice back into the fridge.
The song ended, but Tony held fast to Steve, hand firm on his shoulder, cheek tight against his. Steve didn't even bother to ask if he wanted to stay out there for another song. He just started to sway with him again as the band launched into another standard, and he would have gladly stayed there if not for Pepper saying from behind him, "I'm sorry— Steve?"
He thought it might be difficult to get Steve to show up later that afternoon when the festivities were slated to begin, but there he was in a tight pair of jeans and an even tighter t-shirt, smiling and thanking all the attendees for their well-wishes as he ambled through the crowd. He ducked out of the way of a silver star that was hanging just a little too low from the ceiling and pushed his way over to Tony, folding his arms as he looked down at him and said, "Happy?"
Of course, now that it was out and collected in bottles that Steve could use to feed the baby when Tony was sleeping or showering or just wanted a break — and Steve, as it turned out, loved sitting in the rocking chair and giving the baby her bottle…so long as he was wearing a shirt — that brought up a whole other issue. Namely, what did it
And then together, because that's what they did, they set the slice of cake down on a plate, and Steve held it up and said, "Who wants the first piece?"
He stopped a moment and thought about this.
Because — going out in public, letting people see him — that would be tantamount to accepting what had been done to him, and if he accepted what had been done to him, and he accepted that he was a woman and that he was pregnant, then what did that say for who he really was?
"So, what'd you want to see me about?" Barnes asked, gruff, maybe slightly annoyed, and folded his arms tight against his chest.
"I want… If we do this, I want… I want to make something clear. I want to try something. I put this on you, you're my Antonia Natasha, understand? I know you're still Tony; I know what you still think of yourself as. But if I put this on you, you're my Antonia with everything that comes with it. I call you 'Antonia' or 'Antonia Natasha.' I tell you 'good girl' instead of 'good boy.' I treat you exactly as I would if you had been born this way, which, really isn't that much different than I treat you now, as far as I'm aware, but with this, there's no question. You're 'Antonia.' You're not 'Tony.' If you're OK with that, I'll put this on you. If not, then I won't, and we'll just do what we've been doing, OK?"
"What? Why?" he asked and looked between all three.
Barnes just shook his head a little, like he was having a hard time accepting whatever it was he was thinking. "Never thought Stevie'd get married before me," he murmured. "And to a rich feller at that."
But Natasha just stepped over to him and said, "Why not? It's tradition for the couple not to see each other before the wedding, and we know you two would never do that voluntarily."
"—Yeah, that's—" He shook his head. "That's not what a best friend does. I think you should demote him."
"Easy? Really? Look, I don't have a

"Yeah? Well, I demand to speak to your supervisor."
Steve shrugged and said a quiet, "I don't

"I changed mind."

But while the wife was practically glaring daggers at him, the husband had his attention directed at Steve and was saying something like, "Isn't that...?"
for ways to die, but, I mean, I'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure here from people telling me, 'Hey, Tony, don't die unless you want Cap to go postal.'"
"Right," he said and grabbed what looked like a couple of unused sketchbooks and the pencil case. There was one sketchbook buried at the bottom of the pile that looked like it had been used since it was purchased, and Tony itched to pick it up and page through it, but he knew that would be the utmost invasion of privacy — even more than what he was currently doing — and he figured even the Cap deserved
It was when Steve was finally able to sit down and enjoy his second slice of cake when Tony felt it again — the fluttering — and he gasped and dropped his fork and then, without preamble, grabbed Steve's hand and pressed it against his lower abdomen.
They went silent again, and the song changed from slow to upbeat. Steve couldn't recognize any of these songs to save his life. He glanced at the toddler in the backseat, and he returned her smile in kind when she grinned at him and waved her toy at him. She babbled something at him, and he was able to catch the word 'Daddy,' but beyond that, he was lost. He shifted his gaze to Tony, and though knowing he risked falling right into Hydra's trap, he sensed that the words Tony had spoken cut more to the core than he wanted to admit, and Steve knew that if any of this was real, if he had indeed married a
"Man, I've just accepted that as their default," Wilson said from behind.
It looked like pretty much every gallery Tony had ever been in: white walls; pale hardwood floors; crisp, clean lighting; a very staid and clinical atmosphere. The only real sense of color about the place came from the assortment of plant life scattered here and there — a ficus here, a philodendron there. Even the informational materials presented about the show — the placard at the front, the captions along the way — were devoid of almost anything resembling color. The photographs were, of course, all black-and-white.
She dipped the brush in the bottle and began to apply the second coat, and as Tony took another sip of his somewhat watered-down beverage, the door opened, and Barnes and Wilson came strolling through, arguing about something that had happened earlier in the day.
"I should have stayed," Tony said and shoved the piece of chicken he'd almost forgotten about in his mouth.
"The man!" she cried into his shoulder.
"What have I
Look, it had definitely been an experience. He could say that for certain. And it hadn't been a
"How do you know? We're 'bondmates' or whatever," he said, using finger quotes on the word. "Maybe if we're not within arm's reach of each other at all times, we die?"
Tony sipped down some more of his drink. "What?"
"What?" Bruce asked as he organized the already-filled tubes.
Rhodey jerked a thumb at him and said, "Is this guy for real?" while Barton rolled his eyes and said, "You say that shit on purpose because you think it's funny, don't you?"
"Kinda feeling bad about everything," Barnes added. He looked down at Tony. "I don't think he realized just how difficult this whole thing has really been for you."
But Barnes, though, oddly enough, fit into the gang of idiots with much more ease than Tony had thought he might enjoy. In fact, Tony had presumed that Barnes would spend most of his time in the penthouse with him and Steve, but he was barely there except for when the others were, seeming to prefer to spend his time with Barton or Natasha or even his
"No, see, that's where you're wrong. Because it does. It totally does. If you really don't want to be separated from your…"
"Wait, whoa. Are you implying that I'm thinking about Cap's trouser snake?" "I swear to god you're proving my point and you don't even realize it."
Steve turned sharp eyes on him.
"I know! I know! You don't want to get hard in the field."
"But it never even occurred to either of you that, you know, maybe if Tony
"I hope Daddy comes home soon," she said as she bit into her third quarter.
Thor wouldn't meet his eyes, however, and instead fiddled with Mjolnir and bowed his head.
Tony turned to Bruce and the doctor. "If you figure it out, don't tell us. We'll wait and be surprised."
Steve turned back around to face him. Oh. Right.
you, Steve. I know your tells. I know how hard you're fighting right now to keep from giving anything away to me. I know you're wondering how I knew that, and I know you're wondering how Hydra knew your deepest, darkest fantasies — and thank you
But Bucky had eventually confided in him — after Tony had already told him — that there was some more cleanup that had to be done; namely, additional Winter Soldiers that Steve was sure even SHIELD didn't know about and a book that held the sequence of words needed to trigger the Winter Soldier. Much as he trusted James Buchanan Barnes with his life — and, more importantly, with the lives of his husband and daughter — he knew he wouldn't rest easy until that book was in his hands and he was lighting the match to burn it out of existence.
"Oh, are you sure?" Tony said. "You don't think it's too
But Steve just stared at him. "Are you trying to say I'm too much of a stick-in-the-mud, or is that a really bad attempt at an age joke in that Prohibition came in
He didn't know how long they'd been walking for, and truth be told, he didn't
He nodded. She was right. He knew she was right, but he couldn't help the twinge of hurt that fluttered in his chest at the knowledge that she was only humoring him — that she didn't believe that he could feel that Steve was still alive and would return home to them, bruised, probably, frustrated, but whole.
"No, there's nothing to worry about. You're in here under assumed names. They're just going to think someone was pulling my leg and I was too gullible not to believe it." She looked back up at Steve and said, "What about your medical history? Ailments, surgeries, allergies—"
"I can't believe I just listened to you ramble about what Captain America's dick looks like."
"Uh, I don't know," she said, hands still resting on his belly. "Maybe because she's kind of the last thing I remember about our relationship before we ended it."
"Or maybe I'll learn some language you don't know, and I'll talk shit about you."
," then looked around for something to clean himself up with.
"Practically," she said with an easy shrug, and Tony rolled his eyes.
"You really are, you know," Tony said, all false-bravado.
"Must be the mother, whoever she is."
"Tony," Natasha said, her frown morphing into a knowing look, "just let Bruce look at you. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for Steve. You know Steve would want you to."
When the last of the soap was washed away, Steve shut the water off and guided him back out of the shower, and he wrapped him up in a big, fluffy towel and dried him off, rubbing the towel over his skin in so soothing a way that Tony began to feel almost boneless in his grasp.
Steve — sitting on their bed and making like he hadn't been reported dead two days earlier. Oh, he definitely looked like he'd seen battle — he was sporting cuts and bruises that hadn't been there when he'd left — but he wasn't... He wasn't
She thinned her lips, her eyes softening. "Oh, Captain. After what I was able to do to your bonded, do you really doubt my abilities?"
"Please tell me that's not a fetus, Bruce."
"Honestly, I feel bloated and kind of achy and I've been having some pretty bad acid reflux lately, but other than that, yeah. I feel fine. Why?" And then it hit him what Steve had said before asking Tony if he was OK. "
"I was told if you want gelato, we have to go get you gelato, though," Barnes added.
The wait staff came into the room after that and began to bus their dishes, and Tony didn't miss the lingering looks of one of the waiters, almost like she was trying to figure out just what was going on and what she was seeing. Her coworker unceremoniously elbowed her and nodded at her to get back to work, and Tony quickly averted his gaze when it seemed the inquisitive one was about to look in his direction.
"Excuse me?" Steve asked, lips pursed and eyebrow raised.
"Try me."
," JARVIS said.
"Well, evidently—"
Steve's eyes narrowed, and his voice was low as he said, "Don't ever say that."
point or redeeming value to this movie?"
Or are we talking the dry-rotted waistband of a thirty-year-old pair of sweatpants?"
"Because you created a scene."
He then felt Steve's hands on his breasts through the material of the negligée, squeezing and kneading, and he let his head dip a little as he huffed out a silent moan, and Steve pinched his nipples through the gown and said, "You've definitely gotten bigger. They used to fit better in my hands."
She shrugged. "Well, whatever. Again, not my only charges." She moved her hand in that way that indicated she wanted them to hurry things up. "Come on. Come on. Time is of the essence."
His finger no longer sufficing to soothe or distract, Olivia let out a pitiful screech of a wail, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut as tears began to slide down his cheeks as well. He took a deep, shuddering breath and tried to let it out in a calm, even sort of manner, but a strangled noise came out of his throat instead, and that was it. That was the breech in the dam.
Tony opened his mouth to say 'bingo,' but Steve said, "No, of course you're welcome here."
"You really like him?" Tony murmured to him, and Rhodey exhaled a breath.
Deciding it would be best to attempt to blend in with the rabble, they walked a few blocks away from the Tower before they hailed a cab, Tony barely raising his hand in the air before one was pulling over. As the car pulled up to the curb, some asshole in a business suit attempted to steal it from them, but Tony shoulder-checked him and said, "Yeah, I don't think so, pal," shoving him away as he opened the door and slid into the back seat. Steve apologized —
"Too tired to even fight me back on that, huh?"
"What? Why?" Steve stopped and turned to him, concern etched over his face. "Are you OK? Are you feeling sick? Do you need—"
stop talking about this?" he asked.
"No. Please. Don't. Stop," Tony said when Steve had pulled his hand away, deadpan and droll. "Seriously, what the fuck? How hard is it to open a bottle? I'm not getting any younger, Steve."
"They invented inside jokes right after they developed fire," Bruce said, and Wilson clapped his back and said, "See, man? I knew you had it in you."
"Uh, didn't you say I have a handy-dandy uterus stuffed inside of me?" Tony said. "Pretty sure that's what it's used for."
How old was he when he had his first period?
The smell that greeted his nostrils told him that yes, really, and he threw a glance at the kitchen and wondered if Tony...
hyperbolic, don't you?"
," JARVIS replied, and Tony went into the closet and pulled out the small trunk where they kept their most intimate possessions. He flipped the latches and opened the lid, and he looked over the neat array of toys and implements they used for their play. He picked up the black leather collar, the one with the garnet and yellow topaz gemstone accents, and he brushed his thumb over the jewels and nodded his approval before he reached in and grabbed the leash that went with it. He thought about pulling out some of the other toys, but he figured he'd wait on that. He wasn't even sure Steve would be open to the collar.
"I think we can take it as a good thing, yeah."
"Aside from the obvious," Tony added.
"Again, that's a chance I'm willing to take."
"Yeah. You say people'll pay out th' ass for that kinda shit an' it's yours and Daddy's duty t' help people that don' have what we do."

"Mmm…but not in the same way. He has been fighting from the moment he came into this world. He endured nothing but struggle for many years. In some respects, it is all he knows, all he remembers. But you—

"What?"
, Unca Bruce!"
"Form?"
"You're lucky I love you. Come on, I'll take you home, and then I'll see if I can find a grocery store that's still open."
Bruce smirked at him. "Thanks," he said a little bemusedly, but Tony waved him off.
Shit. Oh, shit. He'd fucked up. He'd
"Really?" he asked, unable to hide the genuine surprise in his voice.
He adjusted the sheet a little, and Tony bit his lip as he realized Bruce was pulling it open a bit more, leaving him slightly exposed. He'd had exams done before for this stupid thing, but the only other person in the room had been Steve, who was…pretty intimately familiar with that part of his changed anatomy. Steve he was OK with seeing that. The others currently in the room with him? He was not.
"Yeah."
Bruce shook his head a little, and he shuffled over to a cabinet to grab some supplies. "You couldn't eat a whole side of beef," he said as he collected empty tubes into a little basket. "I don't even think Thor could eat a whole side of beef."
Tony swallowed down to tears of love and gratitude that were threatening to surface and said, "Hey, I might have lost a lot of things when I pushed your ten-pound child out of me in front of Bruce and Natasha and Barnes—"
"It is," Tony countered quickly. "It is. It's her, and I can prove it."
The creature began to stir again, and once more, Steve held his breath and hoped the man — good God, it was a man — would fall back into slumber. But his hopes were dashed as the creature groaned deep in his throat and uttered exactly one sentence:
"Uh, isn't that

"Huh?"
Twenty-five. Jesus. He was almost twenty years younger than Tony. Physically, anyway.
He nodded and checked his watch. "Good. We good? We ready?" he asked just as Hill stepped in from the press room.
expect you to believe it. You want to know why? Because it's the truth. Because I did get turned into a woman. Because Steve and I
Barnes's eyes went wide as he realized what Tony was hinting at. "No, come on, that's not fair!"
"It's bullshit," Tony cut in. "I ever hear a man say that and he's
Steve was up and alert. "Is it moving?" he asked, getting out of the chair before he'd even asked the question.
"Would I lie about something like this?"
"That if I died, Steve might kill himself?"
He motioned to what Tony knew was his place setting and saw a large mug of steaming hot coffee sitting there.
"Don't worry about it," Rhodey said in reply. "Not every day your daughter from the future shows up in your workshop."
He sighed out a breath and stared out the window beside him, watching the traffic pass as he rubbed a protective hand over his belly. He really did wish his mother was here to see this — wished his mother could meet her grandchild. His mother would know what to do about this. His mother would know what to do about all of this. She could probably even give him some pointers about this whole...exercise of sorts. Because whether he wanted to admit it or not, he was going to be a mother himself. He had no choice in the matter, and technically, 'mother' was the proper term. He was pregnant. He was going to have a baby.
"So, musicians getting toked out of their minds didn't start in the '60s?"
"You want to retire," Steve said, trying to save Tony the misery of having to say the words himself.
Steve nodded. "OK," he said, both looking and sounding relieved. "OK," he reiterated and exhaled a breath.
Barton glared at Steve with his murder face then turned to the others and said, "You know if it's ever a choice between us and the princess, it's always going to be the princess, right?"
"Oh, here," Tony said and reached out to take her from Steve. "I'll do it."
"Even Jim?"
"And lazy as I'm known to be, can we
Tony just arched an eyebrow at him. "That's an awful lot of detail to remember, babe."
"Who watched her...be born," Bucky added, but Sam looked at him and said, "It's not cool to brag."
Anyone.

She shrugged. "I dunno. Y' had one, but then y' took it out, 'n' sometimes Daddy gets a yucky look on his face when y' talk 'bout it 'cuz they had to play Operation on you 'n' Daddy says he doesn't like t' think about it."
Tony didn't know whether that was a slight at his figure or the fact that the woman didn't have much time to work with.
Tony felt the blood drain away from his face. "You…have a brother?"

Natasha winked at him. "I think you'll knock Steve's socks off."
Means I get this over with sooner, right?"
Tony blinked at him, suddenly realizing that maybe that hadn't been the right thing to say. "OK,
"What?"
themselves some more of them."
"Exactly! Not to mention that no one's seen Tony Stark in weeks."
He sighed out a breath and said, "So, are we ready for this?"
Yeah, growing old with Tony sounded nice.
"I don't know," Other Tony with a slight shake of his head, and Tony startled at the very…
Tony rolled his eyes. "What were you supposed to do? Jump after him?" He gave a hard tug on Steve's hands so that Steve would look at him, and when he did, Tony shot a pointed gaze his way and said in a very clipped and harsh tone, "Stop jumping off of, out of, and into things. You are going to kill me if you keep doing that. My heart cannot take you pulling that stupid shit time and time again. Are we clear?"
wanted that breakup as much as I did. Well, no, I didn't
"I'm sorry," he said, "are you the one that's sitting here gender-bent, preg— er,
"What the hell are we supposed to feed them—"
What did that say about who he really was if he did that?
He nodded then said, "Mary Poppins?"
Rhodey made a face and said, "Look, Tones, I love Pepper. You know I love Pepper. I think she's fantastic, and she is so good at getting your ass into gear that she deserves a damned award for it. I just don't think she's the girl for you."
He squawked out a laugh. Wait, did Steve
The media—?"
"Print's dead, babe. And it's not a— I do not have a—"
Tony and Rhodey glanced back to see Happy looking at them expectantly, like he was awaiting information for their most-pressing issue, and Tony and Rhodey exchanged glances before Rhodey said, "Nothing, man. Sorry. I was just asking Tony if he was happy because I switched out his shitty coffee for my better one."
"Fucking menace," he muttered.
"How come no one makes fun of your age?"
Steve swallowed and nodded, and he broke their gaze to glance down to Tony's crotch, and he picked his hand up and reached down to brush the knuckle of his index finger against the sensitive, but cloth-covered slit of his labia.
Barnes grimaced a little and rubbed the back of his neck with his metal hand. "Yeah, you and Steve weren't there."
Steve shook his head a bit but wouldn't meet Tony's eyes. "Me and Howard. No. Absolutely not. It never even occurred to me." He looked up to meet Tony's eyes, and he watched as Tony searched all over his face before he seemed to find what he was looking for.
He just nodded and murmured his thanks, and Rhodey strode over to the steps and went upstairs to the bedroom.
"Do that," Steve said with a decisive nod. "Let us know what you find."
He found her in the room next to what he took to be Tony's, one that looked like it was being set up as an office, and he watched as she looked around with her hands on her hips and said, "Unca Bruce, wha' happ'ned t' all my stuff?"
"Or maybe the Von Trapps," he said, ignoring Rhodey's jibe at him. "You know, 'cause Nazis."
He'd been caught unawares while he stopped to take stock of the situation, ending up with a shot to the arm and a shot to the belly. Tony heard the grunt of pain over the comm line, but when he pressed for information, Steve told him to forget about it and concentrate on his own objective of securing the warehouse, and against his better judgment, Tony forgot about looking for Steve to make sure he was OK and went about the not-exactly-arduous task of taking care of any Hydra rats that were trying to jump ship. He ended up in a slight firefight with one of them that wasn't as keen on giving up the battle as some of the others were, but he was able to duck out of the way of anything that could potentially damage the armor — and therefore him — and instead was able to finally disarm the guy with a well-aimed repulsor blast.
Tony watched as Bruce sighed a little, pushed up his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose, and said, "Yeah, Tony, for
you want to keep her here."
Wilson moistened his lips to buy himself some time to formulate another response then said, "You're both a pain-in-the-ass in your own unique way, and you're both kind of fucking neurotic in your own weird ways, and you…kind of balance that out with each other in a way that I don't think
There was what looked like a film of some kind showing on that odd rectangular wall box. He stopped and watched it a moment, forgetting that he was supposed to be looking after a toddler. It only caught his eye because it looked like it was supposed to be capturing the time and place Steve had just come from — Hydra's way of trying to lull him into a false sense of security perhaps? — though some of the details didn't seem quite right. Before he could get too distracted, he turned from the picture to the little girl on the floor, who stood next to the large, decorated evergreen and pulled at the ribbons hanging off of a large box that was wrapped in some kind of shiny and colorful paper. Christmas wrapping paper was expensive. Steve had never bought any in his life, as he hadn't had the money. He picked up a smaller box and turned it over in his hand. This alone looked like it would have cost a small fortune in paper.
"I'm sorry. Did I give details? I can give details, if you want. You know what Steve's really good at? When he takes his finger and—"
Thor frowned. "I enjoy the taste of both dependent upon my mood, but that is not what I meant."
"Hey, man, I don't care," Barnes said, hands put up in slight defense, and Tony realized then he'd uttered probably every single word of that rant aloud. "I don't know that anything like that is possible," Barnes continued, "but if Steve's genes are as stubborn as he is, well, I guess I wouldn't be surprised."
bathroom for just the two of us." He grinned a little. "How does a suite at the Four Seasons sound?"
. Trying to see what had grown or what hadn't. His belly wasn't the rock-hard flatness of Steve's abs — it never was as flat or rock- hard as Steve's, but whose was? — but it definitely didn't
"I think it's pretty," he said, tightening his arms and holding him close. "And besides, 'Tony' still works for it. Or would that be 'Toni' with an 'I'?"
Seeing nothing — and feeling nothing (well, he had to make sure) — he made his way out of the living room and over to the bathroom. He flicked on the light and stepped into the room then stood in front of the mirror to take stock of himself.
"Mine," Tony grumbled and pulled the container closer to his person. He'd already spooned some out in a bowl, but sharing was overrated.
She made another 'hmm' sound and said, "If I'm hearing you and your Captain correctly, I'm getting the sense that your greatest concern is the actual
Tony pulled back to glare at him, but the mixture of love and teasing he saw staring back at him softened him a bit, and he sighed a little and admitted aloud what he'd already admitted to himself.
She smiled and nodded. "Sure! Bring him along if you want."
. But he'd thought, at the very least, he could see him this morning for breakfast. Now—
"Until they die."
"Sure. Now, go stick that one sheet in the oven. J, start the timer as soon as the old man does what he's told."
Tony rolled his eyes, but evidently Thor and Steve's attempt to assemble the highchair had caught his attention, and he turned and stared at them a moment, confusion spreading over his natural murder face, and he pointed at them with the hand that held his beer bottle and said, "Uh, does anyone know they're doing that?"
be trying to poke holes in their relationship.
Tony continued rambling, but Steve had pulled himself together long enough to focus on what Tony had said about he and Howard having 'something going on together.' He didn't want to know what Tony had meant about Howard spending the rest of his life looking for him, though if this was true — if Steve had gone back with the knowledge that he'd
, I am in no position to judge anyone about their lifestyle choices. So, did this fella have a name or was this one of those sordid trysts—"
"It's about following directions," Rhodey said as he cut into his waffle. "Can you follow directions?"
If this was what that other Steve Rogers was like, and if the other Tony Stark was anything like him, then there was no question in his mind how that other Tony had fallen in love with that other Steve. Because, if he was being perfectly honest with himself, he…was kind of in love with
"You're going to wish you hadn't said that," she mused, glancing to him briefly before she went back to looking at a tablet.
Steve stayed uncomfortably silent on that, staring instead at the wall beside him, and Tony rolled his eyes.
One of the best things about Steve was how no-frills the guy really was.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I get that feeling, too. If I'm reading him right, he's got a bit of a soft spot for her. Gotta be something more to it, right?"
"That was— I shouldn't have—"
"So sensitive. You love it. Don't tell me you don't. I can tell you do. You love when I touch it. I've never seen you more sensitive to any touch I've ever given you."
"What sort of people do we let you hang out with?" he muttered to himself and shook his head a little, and he watched as she scowled at him and sat back in her chair, arms folded.
His asshole friends had decided that he and Steve weren't allowed to see each other until the actual ceremony.
Tony was left gasping for breath, his knees embarrassingly gone weak, by the time Cap pulled away, hand still at the back of his head, his fingers stroking the nape of his neck in a fashion that was both soothing and titillating. While Olivia wrinkled her nose and grumbled at what she'd just seen — kissing boo-boos was OK but
"Mmm… You've said many times before."
“Well,” he said, dropping his voice an octave from his normal speaking voice, “we’ll just have to do something about that, now won’t we?”
He stopped, something sharp and painful hitting him in the chest. He turned to Steve and met his tired anguish and said, "I'm your…" He frowned and motioned over himself, unsure of the word he should use. 'Husband' in spirit but 'wife' in body?
the annoyance of being left out, but it was still nice to know his hard work was being appreciated.
Silence before, "
Tony gave a sharp look up at him, and he grinned in return.
He went in the fridge again and looked around, and he grabbed the small bottle of red stuff and set it down beside her plate.
"OK, Tony," Bruce said and squirted some of that gel onto his abdomen. "Just relax."
He awoke the next morning, his shirt front completely soaked through. At first, he wasn't sure what it was and, with Steve snoring beside him, he reached out and grabbed his tablet and quickly Googled the issue before coming to find, like the slight leaking issue he'd had towards the end of the pregnancy, it was par for the course. He then read a little further, coming upon words like 'engorgement' and 'mastitis,' and he set the tablet back down and again wondered why something that was supposedly so 'natural' would have so many complications from it. Either Mother Nature was a stone-cold bitch or she was as naïve as Esmeralda and thought this was what people
I was born?"
Tony picked his head up to look at Steve, and he watched as Steve stared at him and blinked, his mouth opening and closing a few times like a fucking guppy fish because he couldn't seem to formulate the words he wanted, and he finally said a somewhat unsure, "OK— Are you OK? Are you feeling OK?"
Thor, not seeming to realize he'd said something he shouldn't have, pulled out the pile of deli meats and cheese and condiments he'd found and dropped them all onto the counter. He turned to Tony and beamed.
Steve raised an eyebrow. "Then maybe we shouldn't have a private conversation in a public restaurant."
Tony nodded and went to say 'thanks' but instead what came out— Was a sob.
Tony humphed and rolled his eyes. "Gee, wow, thanks for the expert opinion."
/tall; tawny/fair; brunette/blonde; brown-eyed/blue-eyed; lean/built). But it was in the way they blended and complemented each other, the way that one took gladly what the other offered, the way Steve liked to marvel at advancements and Tony liked to show off. It was in the way they innately understood each other — even if they didn't always agree — and the way they could communicate with nothing more than meeting each other's gazes. It was in the way they could have an entire conversation with each other with barely a word uttered because words were superfluous. Each somehow knew what the other was thinking, like they were connected on a level no one else could match, something that made Bruce scratch his head and Barton roll his eyes and Romanoff gaze at them impassively almost like she was bored by it all.
"If you rat me out to the others, I'll deny everything."
He gave a curt nod and added, "Come by here at 3:45 tomorrow and I'll perform the ceremony myself."
He drifted off as he felt something wet and warm sliding down his face, and he laughed a little and reached up to brush the tears away.
He wanted to stay there, with Tony and Olivia, forever.
His feet were beginning to ache — fucking stilettos — but he still pulled himself back up to the upper level and stumbled back over to the table, grimacing and trying to keep as much pressure off the most sensitive part of his feet as possible. He sat down in his chair in a huff and went to reach for his soda, only realizing at the last second that the one he'd grabbed had come from the guy he'd just chased off.
— but his back hit against the wall, and the guy rested his other hand at Tony's other hip and pushed right up against him.
"Look, does it matter?" he asked and dug out the first spoonful. He shoved it into his mouth, his taste buds savoring the creamy chocolate and caramel flavors as he added, "I was kidding myself with this whole thing, anyway. I'm not Peggy, I'm not Howard, and I'm not
Bruce just sighed a little but didn't say anything, and Tony shook his head and sat back down at his worktable.
"The button on the door handle right there. See it?" He didn't take his eyes off the road as he motioned to the spot in question. "Push it away from you once. That'll put it back up."
"'Steven Stark' sounds better than 'Tony Rogers.'"
He continued to rub at his lower back, and Natasha watched him a moment then said in a soft voice, "You know, Steve might make it back in time yet."
"The laser light spectacle is most advantageous to simulating situations we have found ourselves in in battle."
He tried not to think that a dream where he had been, for all intents and purposes,
"Hmm?" he asked and slid one arm around Steve's lower back while his other hand rested over Steve's hand pressed against the baby's small back. "Well, I was awake, and the bed was empty, and I got kind of lonely and decided to come searching for my strong, handsome soul mate."
She grabbed the carafe, a none-too-pleased look on her face, and made her way back over. "You're going to be a pain in my ass tonight, aren't you?"
his flesh and blood, no matter how much he tried to deny it.
Only, that brought up another issue, namely, did Steve like his female form
to attend. Besides, they wanted to get this whole thing out in the open now and lay everyone's questions and concerns to rest, what better way to start doing that than by showing up to the Stark Foundation gala, pregnant and glowing and hanging off the arm of a handsome super soldier?
"Of course!" the woman said, smiling like it was obvious. "Eldorado's gold and the fountain of youth rolled into one. The attempts to recreate it have left…something to be desired. Nothing can ever compare to the original formula."
Sam shook his head. "Yeah. No. I don't think they ever actually made that decision, and no way in hell would they pick you."
Tony hummed and said, "I wouldn't go that far, but OK."
"Was that OK?" Steve asked, and Tony rolled his head and just looked at Steve, blinking dumbly at the nervousness he saw reflected back at him.
"Did I just make it weird again?"
"You tell Steve about this," he said as he went into the kitchen and over to the coffeemaker, "and I'll let Barton use your main server for target practice."
"Kind of. I mean, not that I want to stay this way forever, but…" He made a face again, flattening his mouth and continuing to avoid Steve's gaze as he folded his arms, resting them over the decorative little ribbon of material that sat just under his breasts. "I don't know," he muttered. "I'm not going to stay this way
"Yeah."
"Your rather overt hedonism of those years does not detract from your inner nature. After all, you are the one to have provided your friends with a home, are you not? You are the most concerned for their welfare and well-being. You ensure that they have all that they could possibly want or need: necessities like food and clothing and shelter, the tools of their trade to ensure they can keep on acting as protectors of this realm you call 'home,' a place to gather and a reason to be. You need these people around you — you wish them to be around you."
"He saw it," Bucky said. "He's playing dumb. He's a shit liar. He'd be asking more questions if he really didn't know what you were talking about."
Wilson put his hands up in surrender and squeezed his eyes shut.
She nodded and took the last bite of her sandwich. "Yeah," she said with a mouthful of bread, peanut butter, and jelly. "They've always been married."
found out about this! We didn't know this was her intention back when she turned me back the first time!"
Steve just nodded, and he let go of Tony's hand to wrap his arms around Tony's frame and pull him into a warm and gentle embrace. Tony went with it, letting go of Steve's face to put his arms around his neck, and they sat there wrapped up in each other for several quiet moments before Steve said, "I do love you, you know."
"Honey, it's the
Bruce frowned. "I could have been in Calcutta," he said almost wistfully.
Tony 'hmm'ed then said, "Steve Rogers, you
Tony Stark — his tender, gentle, caring, and funny Tony that looked at him like no one else ever had. It was a dream, and a pipe dream at that, something never to come to pass, something to be left to the wastebin of history like everything else from what he had once considered his life.
"I think you feed more than most babies," he told her as she drank. "Clearly, that's your father's fault. You have his appetite."
fittings to get this perfect, but of course, the time doesn't allow for that."
" he squeaked because this voice fucking sucked sometimes. "They couldn't have waited
Rhodey face-palmed, and Tony made to cover the phone like he could block out Olivia's voice, turning to glare at her in a '
"I know," Steve said and leaned down to kiss Tony. After he'd broken the kiss, he added, "I'd just feel better if Bruce was here with you. Humor me, please?"
"You weren't here when they all noticed it. Could've heard a fucking pin drop at how quiet they went. But you saw the way they practically ran out of here with all their bullshit excuses — like they couldn't get out of here fast enough."
got you like that?"
"Yeah, well," he said and got up to put Olivia back in her bassinette. "There are ways to get milk out outside of having a newborn suck on your tit, as it turns out." He set the baby down in the bassinette then turned to Steve. "Evidently, we're talking feet here. And yes, I will be testing it. For science."
Tony made a face and said, "Yeah, that's great, Brucie, but I don't think Barnes and Romanova are going to want to stand here holding my legs like this for the next several hours. That, and I don't want to lay here like this the next several hours. And I have to pee."
"So, what's that thing on the wall?"
had interactions with some form of not just future
Tony scoffed. "Yeah, after exhausting every alternative and trying to find some way to be right on a technicality."
Tony jumped from the coffee table back to the couch and put tight arms around his shoulders and held him close. "Nope. Not going there. Don't go there. It's a bad place. Nothing's going to happen to us, babe. You can let yourself be happy. You can let yourself relax. You're stuck with me. In this life 'til we're old and gray and forever after that. No one's taking us away from you, and that's that."
"But it's the truth. It's what's gotta happen. Brucie did the ultrasound. I've got parts inside of me that I shouldn't have, and one of those parts is housing something that shouldn't ever be inside my body."
Tony shrugged. "Honestly, you're not wrong. Which is why we use the rest of our lives to make up for that shit."
to listen to you. They know Captain America won't lead them astray."
Unless you're looking to hit up the clubs, in which case you're probably better off having either Goldilocks or Asshole Barton show you the moves, though I don't doubt for one second that they could both get you to embarrass yourself in five seconds flat."
"Well, I didn't think I had much
"So!" she said with an exhale of breath, and Tony met her gaze for only a moment before they were both suffering from a sudden onset of watery eyes, and Pepper pursed her lips in some half-hearted attempt at getting her emotions under control before she blubbered out a happy, "I'm so proud of you, Tony."
"Probably."
"I wanted 'Steven.' Steve wanted 'Anthony.'"
"Tony, he…he worries," Natasha said, and Tony turned betrayed eyes on her.
"You're lucky," he muttered and began to spread some of the preserves onto his toast.
"You, too," he finally said because he suddenly remembered the Cap had been orphaned at a young age as well.
Barton just patted him on the back. "You don't have the same upper-body strength that you used to. Sorry. You can probably swing your hips better than I can if it's any consolation."
He continued to ramble, but Tony just said, "Honey, honey,
"Far less entertaining for the rest of us, too," Barton agreed.
"If you insist," Tony said with a shrug and slunk off the bed. He reached behind and undid the zipper then unhooked the halter band and slid the dark red fabric down his body until it pooled at the floor. Standing in his black-and-red bustier, garter belt, and stockings, he turned to Steve and put his hands to his hips. "This enough, or you want me to…?"
, but why can't you just admit to yourself — if just for a moment — that maybe that
"J?" he said with a sigh then tucked the ring away in the drawer for safekeeping. "Remind me to put that somewhere safer for the duration."
Steve just laughed and went back to polishing.
"I cannot be a parent, Steve," Tony finally said, his face still in Steve's gentle hold. "I can't— I can't do this."
strange stuff out there we never could have even imagined when we were kids."
She smiled and shook her head a little but said nothing.
your fault. Don't you get it? It's all me! It's all on me! I'm the one that jumped to a conclusion without talking to you! I'm the one that screwed up!"
"Like you wouldn't believe! I have an appetite again, I have a sex-drive again— Incidentally, I wasn't joking about getting that suit on my bedroom floor."
"If you really want to do this," Steve said, "we'll find a way to make it work. I wasn't sure if you actually still wanted to get married."
"If it's worth it to crawl back into bed or if I should just say the hell with it and stay up."
Steve stood in the middle of the living room, the lighted evergreen partially obscuring his view of the kitchen from where he stood, and so he went over and took a good look at it for the first time since they'd put it up a couple weeks back, only now noticing the chintzy plastic Avengers ornaments that dotted the branches. There was a green Hulk and a mighty Thor and a suave- looking Hawkeye and a cool-as-a-cucumber Black Widow.
He was proud of himself for getting the word 'portal' out without breaking out into a cold sweat. He'd...had some incidents as of late.
Steve just laughed, especially in that Tony didn't move one millimeter away from him. "Hey, I was including myself in that age thing. And I never said it was
But Steve was looking at him in that devious way that he got when he was calling Tony's bluff. "You'll go to a real medical doctor if I go with you? Fine, I'll go with you."
"I'm positive."
"Not following."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Date?"
"Honestly wasn't even my best, and I'm kind of ashamed over it."
pregnancy articles. I do try to keep aware of what's going on in the world."
Tony awoke to the sounds of clanging, what he took to be pots and pans being banged around in a kitchen.
"Hey, I didn't
"You had to kiss babies during your tenure as a chorus girl, didn't you?"
The outfit was actually pretty tasteful and chic, he thought. Stylish — not like those garish outfits he'd seen in movies or TV shows. Understated. Sophisticated. He had to admit, he wasn't actually embarrassed to be seen in public looking like this, and what's more, he'd even picked it out himself. Natasha and Hill and Pepper would be proud. Steve, though…
"Yeah," he'd said with a choked laugh when this realization had first hit him, tears blurring his vision, "you're Steve's all right."
He rubbed his abdomen some more and closed his eyes. He thought he'd been lying yesterday when he'd told Natasha he had a 'gut' feeling that this was a boy. He thought he'd been lying because, much as he was afraid to admit it, his 'gut' feeling was that it was a girl. And that disheartened him just as much as saying 'boy' because he was certain that this girl wasn't
Pepper just shook her head, and Natasha checked her watch and said, "We better get a move on if we're going to get down there by two-thirty."
"I'm not even sure I would have gone with Cher," he replied then looked over at Heckle and Jeckle. "Wait, seriously, is that what he's up there doing?"
Steve nodded. "That's the one," he said then grinned like he was proud of himself, and Tony smiled back despite himself.
But she just blinked and said, "Nothing." She smiled at him in a way that was meant to be reassuring but was tinged with something worrisome. She took the espresso-to-go that was handed to her and said, "Come on," as she took a firm hold of his free arm and began to pull him toward the door.
"You don't normally walk home, do you?" Tony asked and pulled onto the road.
"How are you feeling? How are you doing? I don't talk to you enough."
"Ugh, attacked in my own home," he muttered and shoved half of the remaining half of doughnut into his mouth. It was only then that he realized the others were…packing up to leave?
"Whatever," he said unfolding his arms and and waving his hands in the air like he was wiping away the conversation. "Look, are you taking me to one of those joints or am I going with you and Brucie to this boring-ass— Wait! No! That's not the word!" he cried at Steve's pointedly raised eyebrows. "This highly intellectual and stimulating show of appreciation for some dead chick with a camera?"
He shrugged but didn't stop rubbing Tony's back. "Nothing to tell."
He thought about it. "Not really. That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. This is
Look, I know it probably comes off a little biased, but seriously, Steve, we are probably the most attractive couple in existence."
Bucky groaned then said, "Would you give me that baby?"
"You could always just say to me, 'Hey, Roger, can we talk?'"
had just broken.
Steve glared at him. "I thought we agreed not to talk about that?"
"And we're gonna have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny-fucking-Kaye, right, Tones?" Jim said, but the tone and the excitement in his voice made it sound like he was quoting something rather than coming up with it on his own.
"There," Tony said and pulled back, proud at his accomplishment. "Let's see how long it takes
A daughter.
"I wouldn't say he was
this is what she wants?"
Rhodey just made a face and said, "Nah, wouldn't want to trouble you. I can cook 'em myself."
Rhodey just waved him off and stepped into the elevator, and Tony heard him say, "Yeah, JARVIS, is Bruce around? Think I'll go hang out with him until those two get out of their system whatever it is that…" He shivered and shook his head, and the doors closed.
"And after I just took a nice, clean shower, too," he mused and dipped a finger into the come on his chest. He swirled some on the tip, met Steve's eye, and then stuck his finger in his mouth, and Steve closed his eyes and said, "You're so goddamned lucky I'm done for a while."
"Why not?"
"I'm sure there's space for it somewhere in this building," Natasha said.
" Barnes asked, genuinely confused, and Tony shrugged.
Steve huffed out a breath and then said to Natasha and Bruce, "He's a lady."
"Modest fella."
Steve chewed and then swallowed his bite and said, "I could try."

"The TV." She nodded at the contraption on the wall, eyebrow still raised and mouth pursed into what he could only describe as a patronizing frown. "We lost the signal."
"Not even for Cap," Wilson replied. "I mean, I can admit: He's a good-lookin' dude. But he— Yeah, he's not my type."

"Vampires aren't real."

"So, you're just assuming he hates you and wishes you were your father without a shred of evidence?"

she looked like.
Tony took the breadstick out of his mouth. "Not without you thinking about me going down on you, anyway."
God, did they have action figures, too? Little toys with their likenesses? Or maybe they looked more like those cartoon Avengers that were on her t-shirt. Those were more vague resemblances than anything that spoke to being completely modeled after the real McCoys.
"Steve, you're not a useless relic—"
Barton, ever the asshole, did what he could to get #LadyLiberty trending, but he also tagged under #beautygraceMissUnitedStates, which clearly went over the heads of anyone not well-versed in Sandra Bullock movies. He thought it was hysterical. He was the only one. Bruce totally didn't chuckle at it, and Natasha didn't smile at it, and Wilson
"I thought you said you could explain?"
He met Tony's eyes and grinned at him, and Tony grinned in return before he said, "Say, babe?"
"Yes, sir."
He sighed and took his place in line and waited, and for some reason, he expected for someone to point and say he wasn't actually a woman and he had no business in using that bathroom, but he was able to get in and do his business without one word said to him and barely a look sent in his direction.
Just another one of those things he couldn't figure out about this odd time he'd found himself in.
Tony coughed a few more times before he was able to collect himself, and he looked Steve dead in his crystalline blue eyes and said, "I'm sorry, did Captain America just admit to smoking marijuana? No, don't tell me. You didn't inhale."
Tony glanced up and met her gaze, and a slight shiver went down his spine at the way she seemed to be able to bore right into him and read his deepest and darkest thoughts. He'd thought only Steve could do that.
"I'm not…really into that."
"Science," he corrected. "I don't actually have to be in the suit to control it. You losers are currently readying for takeoff while I get to sit here in my lab and stuff my face full of ice cream and cheeseburgers."
"Merchandising. It's the American Way."
The guy just stood there a moment, staring like he was trying to make sense of what had just happened, and he blinked a few times before he narrowed his eyes, his mouth formed into a scowl
His engagement band.
"Except when it isn't. Except when given the choice between his husband— wife— whatever the
Steve just closed his mouth and nodded, but evidently unwilling to let that be the end of it, he took a breath and said, "You know, Tony—"
. Me." He opened his eyes but didn't look at Tony. "There's a…book." He snorted a bitter laugh. "Guess it's like an instruction book. The care and maintenance of Winter Soldiers. There were words in it— I can't remember them now, but if I ever heard them again — the right sequence—" He shrugged. "They'd have me."
did that say for who he really was?
He scowled a bit as Steve leaned in and wrapped big, strong arms around him, pulling him close and cradling him against his chest. Tony sighed and went with it, resting his head on Steve's shoulder and putting his arms around Steve's ridiculously narrow waist.
"Well," she said as they met up, "last chance to back out."
Had Olivia only learned it from him or was it some kind of 'magic' as that Cap had said? "You mean who I let her go back with?"
"First of all, what's the deal with that water birth stuff? I don't get—" He shook his head and decided it wasn't a path he was interested in traveling. "Anyway, no, I am going to a hospital where there are people, in theory, that know what the fuck they're doing and, god forbid anything happens, will be able to

"Is this a craving?" Steve asked, and Tony chewed and swallowed.
Steve shrugged then said, "I guess he's got some time built up."
Steve nodded his approval, and Tony went to the fridge and pulled out the half-empty jar of organic blueberry preserves. "Steve, I swear to god, if you were double-dipping in this jar—"
nowadays."
"You're cool with the microwave, right? I don't think I have an actual teapot here."
"No, I really don't," she said, sounding like she wasn't in the mood for any of his jokes.
"I don't know. Is it?" Steve asked, but the elevator door opened, and the next words out of Steve's mouth were to Sam.
He was struck first and foremost by a portrait of what appeared to be the photographer sitting on the wall that lined the sunken plaza of Rockefeller Center. Sitting to her left was another young woman that bore a familial resemblance to her, but with dark hair and features that suggested she probably took more after her other parent. Though the scene was New York, both girls looked like they had just stepped out of a store display window on Carnaby Street in 1967: bold-colored mini dresses; long hair; heavy-lidded eye makeup; one in knee-high boots while the other wore those loafer-type things with the low, chunky heels. Both girls were sitting slightly turned and cross-legged to show off long, lean legs, the hems of their dresses
"Why?" Steve asked earnestly as he weaved them through the crowd. "The only people that matter will know where to find us if they need us."
"Your girlfriend," Steve said, like he didn't believe a word of what Barton was saying.
Other Tony reached up and scratched at his forehead. "Uh," he said, like he was trying to be a) casual and b) buy himself some time, "my mom had them. Her father had them. No idea why. Guess he was a big Captain America fan?"
"Some people may have felt my presence
"Did you… Did you
Hydra. This has nothing to do with Hydra. Actually, no, that's a lie—"
He skipped that for the time being and went on to the other questions. He skipped 'email address' and 'home telephone number' and put Steve's number on the 'cell phone' line. He got confused when he saw something asking about 'father's name' until he saw something asking for 'mother's name,' and he assumed it meant his parents.
"Oh, right. OK, look, I know I probably shouldn't say this given the weirdness of the situation, but, honest to god, Steve. I can't help it. I feel like a goddess. I feel like a goddamned goddess of fertility like this."
"Wait," Barnes said after a moment and shared a look with Wilson. "Did you— Did the gutter mouth that is Steve Rogers just tell someone else to watch his language?"
OK, Natasha had. Barnes had been a typical guy about it.
"Actually, I didn't, but I'm starting to get the picture."
Bucky shrugged. "None of us except Stevie's boyfriend."
"Whelp,
Tony just shook his head.
"Oh," Wilson said, "then I
"This," he said and motioned down at himself just as Steve stuck his head under the shower head to wash the remaining soap out of his hair. Steve didn't ask him anything more, and he didn't say anything as Steve ran gentle fingers through his hair, no doubt getting himself soaked in the process. Instead, Tony opened his mouth and let it fill with some water before he sloshed it around and then spit it down toward the drain, doing what he could to rinse out the acrid taste of bile.
"J?" he finally asked.
"First time for everything," Steve said and tucked her back into his arm. "You really don't like formula, do you, kiddo? Well, I'm sorry, sweetie, but Mama's not producing the good stuff anymore. You're just going to have to get used to it."
Steve sighed out a breath, and Olivia slapped her hands on the tabletop and babbled incoherent sounds. "You know," he said above his daughter's babbles, "I really don't understand where this idea of me being 'squeaky clean' came from. I'm not—"
Sam nodded again. "OK, well, that would be the
Tony glanced at Barton a moment before he stuck his finger into the cake and grabbed a dollop of filling and wiped it on Steve's nose. Steve, adorably, crossed his eyes trying to look at the glob of white sugary glop that was now covering the tip of his nose, and Tony grinned and leaned forward, licking it off and making an 'mmm' sound as he did so.
She merely pursed her lips and raised an eyebrow at him. "It's what she thinks happens."
"OK," he said and flashed a grin at the waiter that had finally arrived to take their order. "But only because you asked nicely."
"He wasn't actually Native American, either," Bruce added. "I think his parents were Italian."
"Nothing like that," he assured with a laugh. "Just...did some thinking. Realized how lucky I am. How much I love you and appreciate everything that you do."
He blinked and frowned. "Uh, isn't that standard protocol? Thought that happened to everyone?"
"Really? Yeah, so when I hand over my Blue Cross card with the name 'Anthony Stark'—"
"She's the CEO. She doesn't have to deal with that shit, does she?" Sam asked.
needed to shut his fucking gob before he kicked him in the fucking face. He
"And it's like, no matter how many times you tell the kid to settle down, he doesn't listen." He glanced back at Steve. "He really does take after you, doesn't he?"
He narrowed his eyes and fought very, very hard from reaching up with the gauntlet and wrapping metal fingers around Steve's neck.
"Whatever," he muttered and grabbed the remote and turned the TV on. "Hey, so, question," he said and flipped onto one of the news networks, "Steve and I still the news
But Rhodey just stared at him, and Tony shrugged and said, "All right. Topic for another time. So, is it a woman? Are you ditching me for a woman?"
"I know, Steve. But we're running out of options here. The longer the fetus gestates, the harder it'll be to…fix…things."
Happy pulled into the basement garage not long after that, and as he popped open the door, Pepper put her hand on his arm again and asked if he wanted her to ride up in the elevator with him. He assured her he was a big boy that could get to his penthouse on his own, and she smiled a little at him, teary and nervous and said she would find a way to make this right for him.
Pepper just looked between Tony and the little varmint that had attached itself to her. "What is she?"
Olivia continued to squawk, and Tony — in pain, exhausted from childbirth and childcare, sore from his prior Hydra-busting excursion, and wanting to stop the painful throb on his ears that was his newborn daughter's shriek — cried out, "But Bruce, she's hungry!"
Jim rolled his eyes and muttered, "They're toddlers. When you put the two of them together, they're toddlers."
of all places, but he doesn't want to talk about that. Just wants to keep reliving the good old days and talk about random shit that happened in 1935.
"And, don't tell me. Yours left you high and dry."
"They both sound the same," Steve countered. "And in that case, the comparison should be between 'Steven Stark' and 'Anthony Rogers.'"
Rhodey just glanced between Steve and Tony, still seeming to have trouble comprehending what he was hearing before he said to both of them, "And you're OK with this?"
"Here," he said and shoved at the two. "Thought of you two when I saw it."
has the ear of the God-anointed ruler of the realm. I know you have come to me hoping for an easy way to fix this problem you appear to have. The King and his chancellor have been good to me. I will not lift one finger to hurt either of them."
Steve pulled up to the designated area then put the car into 'park.' He glanced over to Tony and said, "You ready?"
"Yeah," Tony said and set the items down on the table. "She's thoughtful like that." He moved over to Steve and said to the little girl in his arms, "What'cha got there, baby girl? You got a cookie? You wanna share your cookie with Daddy?" Tony stopped cold and blinked. "In a different context, that's absolutely filthy, and I should be completely ashamed to even put any thought like that in context with my child."
"Don't tell me," he said as she frowned and held the bottle out to him. "Daddy puts ketchup on his eggs."
Steve was silent a moment before he said, "You sure?"
I'm supposed to be done by, or—?"
"Uh," he said and winced a little at another pain radiating from his back, "yeah, I noticed— It started a couple days ago, I guess. I thought Steve and I were just being a little too rough with, uh—"
Steve just hummed in agreement. "A lot of burglaries. A lot of break-ins. All kinds of stolen merchandise. It's going to take the city a while to clean up from that."
Whatever.
"You're pregnant!" he cried. "You're
The narration continued with more footage of the event and speculation as to what Tony's comments meant, but Steve just sat back, floored and speechless.
"I know my limitations, Steve."
"It's not?"
Thor gave a curt shake of his head. "That I do not know."
Cap swallowed and nodded. "Yeah," he said. "My dad, uh, died in the war. Never met him. Really only knew what my ma told me about. Ma, well…"
"Hey," he said and nodded his head toward the dance floor. "Come on. Just one."
"What else is new?" Rhodey said and sat down next to him while Bruce sat down on the other side of him. "So, you're really doing this? You're really getting married?"
Steve just shook his head. He reached out and began to push that 'corn popper' toy, as it was called while Tony, done with his phone, looked over what appeared to be a comic book of some kind and muttered, "And who the hell wants to read Avenger adventures featuring Hawkeye? He sits in the corner, shoots arrows at you, and makes asshole comments like he thinks he's the funniest fuck in the world. No one wants to read about him."
She blinked again and looked from Tony to Bruce to Steve and back again then said, "Well,
"I didn't say you were, but I sense a
"Likewise."

Steve that much more.
Steve glared at Bruce then turned to Tony. "Tony, honey, you need to eat."
him — not necessarily as a lover but as a person in general. He could take lusting after the Captain from afar so long as that's all it was and he knew and understood there was no chance of it ever progressing beyond that.
Steve shot him a sideways look. "So I'd do your paperwork for you?"
So, he enjoyed the stereotypical female pursuits, and he honestly hadn't found himself with any restrictions as to what he could do simply because he now had tits and a vagina. Yeah, OK, there were restrictions — he couldn't go out in the Iron Man suit now — but that was because he was nine-and-a-half-months pregnant and could barely fit into his pajamas let alone a metal exoskeleton. Besides, if he wasn't so goddamned tired all the time, he could just fly the suit remotely.
"The amount that I needed. Are you OK?" Bruce said and crowded him a little in concern. Tony waved him off.
"Cap won't let us eat
"I have put out word that I seek audience with her. She will know where to find me."
Now he was going to have to wait eight more fucking hours to see Steve again. God, he didn't even know if he'd make
"Oh," was all Steve could be bothered to say about that. "We're married?"
"No, it was hard to concentrate."
Steve looked at him, pain and a little concern written over his face. "You think that's a good idea?"
"Uh, I don't know," Barnes said, "maybe by getting frozen and unfrozen a gazillion times over the last sixty years."
But now…
"What happened? Am I dead?" asked the voice whose inflection sure sounded like Tony's but whose tone was anything but, and Steve choked out a laugh but hedged on exactly what to say in reply.
"Like something that isn't like either one of those names. You really want to saddle your kid with a name like that? She'll forever be compared to her grandmothers, who I'm sure you both hold in high regard, and when she doesn't measure up to that— Stark, you know what that's like."
"Oh?" Steve said and stopped playing with his food. "Any inklings or plans?"
what I mean, you filthy, dirty, old man. But we have fun together, right? And that's what counts."
or good enough for
Barnes sat back as though burned. "What? No, that's—"
Natasha got to her feet then leaned up against the rocking chair and began to run light fingers through his hair. "What do you mean?"
"I just, I don't…" The words wouldn't spill out of his mouth no matter how hard he tried. "
Steve opened his eyes once more, and though his mind was very much for the idea of going another round, his dick felt otherwise. Still, he leaned over Tony and, beginning just below his navel, began to lap up the spilled come, the action earning him a breathy exhale and a, "Jesus fuck, I didn't think you'd actually do it!"
The car arrived at the floor, announcing its arrival with a 'ding.' The doors slid open, and as they did, someone said a quiet, "
Pepper went quiet for a moment, and she squeezed his hands some more and said in a low voice, "David Welch is here, by the way."
. Thank you so much for this. It— You have no idea what it means to me."
She reached down and grabbed her small purse from the table. "Yes," she said and pulled her phone out to check it. "We'll be there." She nodded upstairs and added, "Now, go show Steve. I'm surprised he wasn't down here to see this dog-and-pony show for himself."
Tryin'a sleep!"
can't
"Uh, what?"
, Steve?"
"I did not call you 'fat'!" Steve said with a laugh. "Stop that. Bruce is going to think you're being serious."
Steve shot a look at the Iron Man before he turned to Thor and said, "I never grounded Iron Man."
"Did you get lucky? Please tell me you got lucky."
"—and sure, yeah, OK, maybe get more people talking about Captain America being seen out and about with someone that is, what they think, not Tony Stark because, you know, it's not like I have a
"Tony, I don't
"What?"
"I'm hungry, Steve," he replied and scowled when he couldn't quite break off the bite he wanted with just his fork. He picked up Steve's knife and began to cut himself a portion.
Still, it was Obadiah Stane that had set him on edge, had always looked at him with equal parts distrust and disgust. When Howard was alive, it was no big deal. Howard still owned and ran the company, and Stane had no power or authority over him. When Howard died and Stane stepped in as intermediary, suddenly Steve noticed a change. He even noticed it about Tony — the contemplative looks Tony would sometimes give him like he was trying to figure him out, and Steve could only wonder if Stane, who was the other real father-figure in Tony's life, was filling his head with stupid notions that he was only with Tony for his money.
He did exactly as he'd explained to thin air, setting the dishes to wash and dry, and he turned back to the baby that had awoken and was blinking sleepily at him.
"Hmm?" Tony said, doing a quick scan of the perimeter to make sure everyone was satisfied with their food and drinks. "Always," he said, unthinking, and turned to look up at Steve.
God, how fucked up his life was.
"Yeah? What kind of research?"
Tony made a displeased noise in the back of his throat and didn't even try to hide the fact that he was rolling his eyes. Bruce just stared at him flatly before he continued.
But Tony just met his eyes and said, "Look, we'll get pizza, grab a few beers, and then Bruce and I will get back to work trying to figure out how to get her the fuck back where she belongs."
"Running your foot up my leg!"
— with his child, mind you, which is a fucked-up miracle in and of itself — and I was trying something on the other day, something I'd actually been wearing for a while but I'm starting to get just a little too, well,
please."
"OK."
about his child. He didn't want him to have any information that he could somehow use against them. Barnes had murdered his parents. What was to stop him from doing the same to his child?
Steve glanced around the room again and began noting entrances and any structural weaknesses that could be—
He turned his attention to Olivia, and he frowned when he saw she'd gotten sauce on the front of her mostly-white dress. "Oh, baby girl," he said with a sigh and dipped a napkin in his water glass to try and dab some of the sauce off the pale front of the dress. "Yeah, that's my fault. I didn't have your bib snapped the right way. At least we already got the pictures."
"Pepper was good for you," she said, "but I think I knew then you two were better off as friends."
He went back to mixing the child-approved concoction, and Rhodey said, "Which you have done nothing to dissuade from the moment she arrived here. And if
"So," Rhodey said and finished the last of his waffle, "what's on the agenda today for you two?"
been listening to what I've been saying since January?"
But Barnes looked at him — really
Steve stopped just as soon as he'd stepped off the elevator, the Iron Man armor right behind him, and Tony watched as he swallowed and raked his gaze over the sight before him. Tony had hedged his bets that the look would appeal to Steve, but he hadn't honestly been one hundred percent sure until this very moment.
It was right before Christmas. He was home, lying on the couch, dressed like a bum in a Mister Softee t-shit and wearing a red Santa hat on his head. His mother, dressed so impeccably in her blue suit, hair and makeup done, sat at the piano. She was playing that song from
He awoke to the scent of bacon frying and coffee brewing, both things that were guaranteed to rouse him from his slumber and lure him into the kitchen like a siren song.
"Yeah? Well, just give 'em the usual bullshit song-and-dance—"
Except—
Liar.
"Is he happy?"
me no matter what."
"Because of craving sweets."
"She looks like me."
," JARVIS replied.
"Prove it."
"Same shit, different day," he muttered.
Rhodey leaned against the table and folded his arms. "So, that's it? She looks like you and she believes what she's saying, so she must be your future daughter from another dimension?"
"Yeah," Steve said, and Tony could actually hear the smile in his voice. "They are."
He hedged and said, "I don't know how fitting it is to wear
"Don't mention it, babe. I got you covered." He picked up his own menu and opened it. "God, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse."
They both went quiet again, and Tony looked over to the window and watched the raindrops cascade down the glass, and he swallowed and thought this might spoil everything, but he needed it to be said. He needed to clear the air with Steve.
Tony laughed and continued to let Steve play with his hand. "However you want, babe. Could have taken mine. Could have taken yours. Could have made up our own. We decided to hyphenate. Legally, we're both 'Stark-Rogers.' And it's
Warmth and happiness flooded Tony's body at that, and against his will, he found his eyes welling up with tears as Steve continued to caress his arms.
"How so?"
— well, it stood to reason that he wouldn't want to face the man any longer than he absolutely had to. And it wasn't as though he could explain
"Is that a problem?" Steve asked and glanced up at him a moment. "Also, she is my child, and I am being useful," he added and set the tree cutter down and picked up a candy cane.
"Never too early to start planning the next meal, Steven," he replied with a waggle of the eyebrows.
"Talk about what?" Steve asked, trying for faux innocence or confusion but failing miserably.
"David Welch," Pepper said.
He made a face. "We have to go shopping?"
"What?"
and Natasha, evidently sensing an opening with which to change the subject, looked up at Tony and said, a more open smile on her lips, "Feel better?"
Honest to god, sometimes they really did have a mind of their own.
Jane just sighed and rolled her eyes, but Darcy stared at Tony very seriously, head tilted like she actually wanted to
With nothing to do until the results came through, they assumed the positions that they had taken so many times in the past with Tony at his computer working on projects for the team —
"Steve, don't talk like—"
She just smiled at him, which was answer enough for him.
"Die," she finished for him, saying the word he couldn't bring himself to utter.
was hoping for a girl — for one girl in particular? See if Tony was still attached to that little ball of fire that had been taken from him much too quickly?
what he was doing. He
Steve was still inspecting the ring as he said, "Our anniversary date. Maybe something else."
But he didn't know if Barnes had informed Natasha or Bruce or Hill of what he'd already informed him, and not wanting to get into it then, he just said, "I did what I had to do."
Tony bit his lips as though to suppress a reaction of some kind then sobered and cleared his throat. "Honey, trust me, this is
"Uh, Steve?"
"Coming from which side of the divide?"
Steve shrugged again, like he was ashamed of what he felt. "Kinda wouldn't mind a surprise. I mean, I kinda want a boy — I mean I
And speaking of having to pee…
He smiled back in teary-eyed gratitude at her while Steve reached out and pressed a kiss to his cheek. He
Tony pulled the mug out of the microwave. "She just thinks Friday is better. It's what she's used to."
"Any idea where he was headed?"
"Well, clearly, in complete contrast to your nickname, you can't see shit."
He sighed and rolled his eyes. "Fine," he said and dropped his hands away. "I guess we…" He took another good look over Steve and let out an obnoxious and dramatic sigh.
And then, to prove his point, he stabbed a couple of bits of scrambled egg onto a fork and then ever-so-lightly touched them at the large, ugly puddle of red glop, taking only the tiniest portion of ketchup onto his eggs.
He shrugged. "I don't know how we'd do it. No clerk would believe I'm legally Tony Stark."
but, if his hunch was right and this was the real deal, he wanted it to be a genuine surprise for Steve.
"That…doesn't look like a Santa or a candy cane," Steve said as Olivia munched on the cookie.
Steve glanced down at his legs and saw how his pants were soaked through to just above his ankle. He hadn't noticed the cold before, but now that he thought about it— He felt a burst of hot air hit his legs, and he knew then that whatever Tony had done had been for his benefit. He could almost believe everything Tony had said and done this morning had been sincere.
Bruce twitched an amused smile at him. "Not all of them, Tony. It's still the safest—"
"Hmm...always did know how to woo a fellow, didn't you?" he teased then reached out andnplaced his hands on either side of Steve's waist. The lopsided smile morphed into a sultry leer, and Tony ran his hands up from Steve's waist to his chest where he flicked his thumbnails over either of Steve's nipples and gently kneaded his fingers into the firm flesh of Steve's pecs. Steve could only think for a fraction of a second of how different and yet similar it felt before Tony was all but purring at him, "Mmm...show me what you're made of, soldier."
Something to remind him of Steve. Goddamn it.
After all, of the four people in that room, he was the only one literally in the middle of pushing an entire human being out of him, so he was sure that counted for something, and it was probably about four more pushes after that that Bruce said something about crowning. Oh, dear fuck,
"Mmm…my apartment, my sausage," was all Tony could be bothered to say, as he'd completely forgotten about the dried blood covering the front of Steve's uniform and had nestled himself into Steve's embrace. Steve's arms really felt
, all right? She was there. She was from another universe—
"No," he said. "Just hungry."
"No, it's fine. It's fine, Stevie. I get it. You'd rather hand your own child over to strangers from California than anyone here in this room. Hey, that's your prerogative. You're her father. You gotta think about these kinds of things. Not like you're gonna be around forever..."
"Steve, what are you—" he tried to ask but was silenced by Steve's mouth on his, and when he opened his mouth in a gasp, he was rewarded by—
"I feel like shit, Steve's due home any time now, I need to prove I'm fine otherwise he's going to be on my ass to go to a doctor — and like I already told Brucie, not the good kind of being on my ass — so I'm making Brucie go through and give me a checkup. He thought he felt something funny in my abdomen. It's probably a tumor. I need to find out what it is before Steve gets home so I can make sure he never finds out about it."
Bucky just shrugged, moving from the bottom 'E' string to the 'A' string. "She should have options, don't you think?"
The doctor nodded, typing and swiping again, and murmured, "The girls in the office are going to have fun with this one."
"She's called herself that," Steve said and reached out to grab his tablet again. "She was kind of groaning about it at the time, but—"
"I mean, is this permanent?" he asked, ignoring Tony's utterance. "Are you turned into a woman for the rest of your life?"
"Mmm… Yeah, but only when you're
Steve walked over to him, and he took the collar from Tony's hands and turned it over in his own, inspecting it, weighing it, almost like he was buying himself time. When he finally spoke, his voice was so low and so full of want and possession that Tony almost sank to his knees.
He moved aside to let the staff set it on the table in front of him and Steve, marveling at the design of it. It was tiered, three square layers atop each other, the icing or whatever that stuff was called an almost royal purple color with what looked like hand-crafted marzipan calla lilies placed around it and tiny, decorative silver balls stuck with precise measurement along the intricately- decorated sides of each layer. Maybe it wasn't what Tony would have ever picked for himself, but it still was a pretty nice-looking cake.
"All right," he conceded, letting Tony win for the second time that morning, "then what do we do about it?"
"Guess I'm out of a bed for the night," Rhodey said as he stood beside him, and Tony nodded toward the stairs and said, "Take mine."
would have shunned this woman if she really had been just a gold-digging whore out for Steve's money and fame — out to take advantage of some void left by the god- awful Tony Stark. Just what did Captain America see in that train wreck anyway? He could still remember the more cynical columnists and TV talking heads and radio morning show clowns setting up their countdown clocks to see how long it would be before Captain America came to his senses and dropped the dead weight that was Tony Stark on his ungrateful ass. They, of course, were having a field day with this news, half of them convinced Steve had finally dumped Tony for someone 'more fitting' for him while the other half thought Steve was so messed up by the ice that he didn't realize he'd gone from an alcoholic albatross to a 'stupid skank' (as one of the morning show assholes had called him; Steve had almost broken his tablet when he'd stumbled upon that).
He whirled, arms out and poised to defend against attack, his gaze settling upon a lank woman with long, honey-blonde hair and bright emerald eyes. Her gown was the same pale, shimmering thing he'd last seen her dressed in, that cocksure smile just as annoying as it had been the last time he'd seen it spread over her ruby red lips.
rueful as he said, "They're not
"Safety?" Steve asked, almost like he was a little insulted by her words.
"Because physically, I'm not a man at the moment, and you fell in love with me when I was a man."
"No, it isn't."
"Yeah."
Though it seemed a damned sight safer than whatever clusterfuck that other Cap had taken her back to. The blood on that uniform had been a little too fresh, now that he thought about it, and the noises in the background of that wormhole-thing hadn't been the most…comforting of sorts.

him, "you're tall."
Tony waved him off and said, "These things never start on time, anyway," then turned to Steve and asked, "Is it OK? How does it look? Should I have gone more 'professional'? I was trying to do 'cute' but 'fun' at the same time."
Steve, of course, looked not just presentable but
there, and he gasped and nearly dropped the baby when a tall woman with long, honey-kissed blonde hair turned from the broad, floor-to-ceiling window, her gossamer gown swishing with the movement, flecks of something glittery catching in the soffit lighting above.
"I knew that!" Olivia said and pouted a little, seemingly annoyed that Tony had gone to someone else for this information. Or maybe more that he had gone to the vastly inferior 'Jarbus' for it.
He took a deep inhale of breath to steel himself then shook his head. "No, we can't. Besides, we're almost there, and Nat and that bitchy woman put so much effort into making me look presentable, and
"What?

Tony rolled his eyes this time and sat down on the couch beside him. "Yeah, no one under ninety uses that expression anymore, old man."
that had gone on while he was gone.
"No, Tony, that's not—"
Tony took a breath and put a hand to the door handle as a valet approached his door.
"Anyway, I, um,
"And the soap tablets," Steve said as he cooked up the eggs. "Machine doesn't dispense those on its own."
"How?" Pepper asked. She reached out to the table and picked up what Tony suspected were the remnants of her drink. "Because he paid to get in.
that's what you meant."
The table was too fucking uncomfortable — everything was too fucking uncomfortable — and so he spent much of the next several hours pacing around his lab, a hospital gown Bruce had rummaged up from somewhere covering him and sharp, mind-blowing pains coming at regular intervals. The gown he'd been provided with after his water had broken and soaked through his clothes, and he wasn't sure he'd ever forget the humiliation he'd felt as he'd stood there, fluids leaking out of him as ever-present confusion and slight disturbance spread over Barnes's face as he pointed at Tony's soaked bottom half and said, "Uh, are you having control issues?"

was he saying this? Why he was he going this route? Why? What had possessed him to take up Tony's offer after all? That's what he was doing, wasn't it? Taking up Tony on his offer? Asking Tony to teach him how to dance? Asking Tony to hold him in his arms and sway with him and—
"'Neat' is old-man for 'cool' or 'awesome,'" Tony explained to the others.
The other two hummed their agreement, and Tony rolled his eyes. "Look, it is not just—"
The kitchen door opened and slammed into the back of Steve's chair, and after jolting at the hit, Steve squeezed his eyes shut and plastered a tight smile over his face then took a deep breath and opened his eyes again, taking in the sight of Tony sitting across from him.
"How has this affected your relationship with Captain Rogers?"
sounds a little more feasible."
He stopped short a moment, mouth dropped open and eyes blinking beneath furrowed brow. He had taken it for an absolute truth that Esmeralda was dead and he would never again be faced with the
And was it his imagination, or did Steve seem a bit disappointed by this turn of events?
While the details for Tony's big revelatory press conference were being worked out (Steve wanted every 'I' dotted and 'T' crossed if they were really going out there like that), Tony thought it might be fun to get the public worked up a little bit first.
Steve just closed his eyes and shook his head a little, but he opened them back up and said, "He didn't recognize Nat, did he?"
Tony glared harder, if that was possible.
Tony set the container down and watched as Steve pulled out the paper plates and a box of plastic flatware. "What are you doing?" he asked as Steve moved the stuff over to the table.
"Nothing. Just wondering if Cap finds that endearing or disgusting."
"No, of course you're not."
"Steve, what are you—" he tried to ask and then screamed out a laugh as Steve reached down and scooped him up into his arms. "Steve!" he cried and smacked at him. "Goddamn it, put me down! I'm the size of a whale! You'll break your back!"
"You don't know the first thing about running a coffee shop."
Oh, poor, naïve man.
"Come on, Tony, let's face it. If we were on a playground, you'd be pulling his hair and calling him names."
Bruce just smiled at them, a soft, knowing sort of smile that Steve took particular notice of. "No, it's fine. I, uh, forgot what I needed to bring, anyway. I'll be back in an hour or so."

"I'm going to hazard a guess and say, yeah, it probably does—"
to watch themselves— I mean that was— I—"
," Bruce murmured while Thor frowned at the characterization.
"Eh," he said with a shrug. "Weight off my shoulders, I guess."
He thought about this a moment, standing in the middle of the kitchen with bottle parts in his hands, and he wondered if that was also part of Tony's problem. For all the groaning and grumbling Tony had done from, well, the moment he'd realized what had happened to him, if there was one thing Tony really did seem to enjoy doing it was nursing the baby. Steve suspected it was partly a hormonal thing (as the reading had told him) and partly because it was something that only Tony could do — that this was something he and he alone could do for his daughter and he took a special pride in that. Honestly, outside of the conception itself, Steve was starting to even wonder what the point of the male half of the species was — at least, he was starting to wonder what the point of the father was. The understudy to take over the role of the mother when she (or he) was under the weather or just needed a break? Anyone could do that. Anyone could do what Steve was doing and what Steve did on a daily basis.
Pepper just put her hand on his arm, gently, like she was trying to break bad news to him. "We may just have to."
"I know there's a couple of bottles of milk in the fridge, but that won't last long. Do we have any formula?" Steve asked and rocked back and forth as he tried to soothe the unhappy infant, but Tony shook his head.
else in the world could manage."
"In lieu of bringing wedding gifts for the groom and groom because that would just have been really tacky — I'm a fucking billionaire — I was going to insist that guests make donations to the charity of my choice, and if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to come."
"Good," Tony said and clapped his hands together. "Then it's settled." He motioned to a cot in the corner. "There, or—?"
But Steve ignored him and instead said to Thor, "Sounds like you know what you're talking about."
Steve continued to give him the soft, boyish smile. "I suppose I should file that information away for future reference."
"Of course she does. I'm her papa."
Natasha he tried to talk to while she was getting dressed for something, her hair pulled up into a ponytail and a black leotard hugging her frame. She slipped some things into a bag and said, "Tony, if you need something, I'm not the right person to ask. Steve makes the decisions for the team. If you need me to talk to him about something—"
"Tony," he said with a somewhat pained sigh, sitting in his chair at the kitchen island and pressing his face into his hand. "We've gone over this. It's a good idea." He pulled his hand away and looked point-blank at Tony. "We just want to — we

"Well, I don't know about

feel right. And then I find out that I'm pregnant. I'm a man, and I'm pregnant. I have a uterus and a fetus growing inside me. And then the troublemaker that turned me into a woman in the first place comes back, turns me back into a woman, and tells me not only can I not terminate this pregnancy, but I have to carry it to term unless I want to prematurely end my life. Because she claims she's bound the parasite's life with mine. Because she says my fiancé and I are 'soul mates,' and this is what all 'soul mates' want. Because she's insane.
"No," Barton said before he could respond, "but he's got a real kink for 'Captain.'"

do not need help carrying this stuff out to the car."
He swallowed, reminded himself that Tony was upstairs and safe, and said, "What are you doing here?"
"What? No! Wait— Steve can't go! Make him come back! I need him—"
He sat back in his chair and folded his arms as he watched the scene unfold before him — watched as Steve comforted and conspired with DUM-E — and, for not the first time in the last few months, he thought of a little, blonde-haired chatterbox with big, dark eyes. He'd told himself he wasn't going to think about her, and so far as Bruce and Rhodey knew, he hadn't. Bruce had brought her up just the other day, and Tony had been able to bluff his way through a game of 'Olivia
Steve's mouth parted into a small, tender smile, his entire face softening to gentle understanding. "It's a boy."
"Eh," Tony said and made a face. "He did go to art school."
"Good," Steve said and led him up the steps and over to their bedroom. He closed the door behind them and ordered JARVIS to dim the lights to twenty-five percent. JARVIS complied, and the lights dimmed considerably in the room. Steve let go of the leash, and he ordered Tony to stand still, hands still behind his back, and he went over to the dresser and pulled out two of the scarves they usually used in this kind of play. Tony watched as Steve tossed one onto the bed then twisted the other one around a bit so that it was little more than a thin strap of satin, and he came back over and said, "I'm going to blindfold you now."
"Are you taking lessons from Barton now? They're breasts, Romanoff, and I don't have as much practice dealing with them as you do. Besides, it wasn't my idea to wear something that leaves so little to the imagination."
Welch motioned around him. "Supporting the cause. I've been a fixture at these Foundation galas for years—" He shot a look at Tony. "Isn't that right, Stark?"
"That I used to be a man. Although, I did tell one lie. Told him I still had my cock."
And hoping that Steve never, ever found out about it. Fuck, if there was one thing he could say for Natasha, the woman knew how to kiss like she meant it. Of course, that just meant he couldn't lord over Steve that kiss he and Natasha had shared back during that whole mess with SHIELD any longer.
He huffed and sighed and bookmarked the atrocity of the white set painted with hideously gaudy flowers. "How 'bout we put that in the 'maybe' pile, OK?"
"That's not the only reason," he countered stubbornly.
That included everything that wasn't the squeaky-clean account of the man SHIELD had listed simply as an advisor. Brilliant though this Tony Stark may have been, his equally flippant and narcissistic attitude toward anything he saw as beneath him was not worth his time in the least.

And I know you think I'm crazy, and I know you think I've flipped my lid, and I know you probably think this is just because I'm like this close—" he held his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, "—to dropping a kid, but it's not, all right? It's something— It's more than that. It's— I can't describe it, all right?

. You may have the mystery of your mystery woman a little longer." He picked up his spoon and pointed at Rhodey with it. "But seriously, if I don't meet this mystery woman until the wedding, I'm going to be fucking pissed. I just want to put that out there right now so there's no confusion about it later on."
"Nothing. There's been a...incident...with Iron Man. Nothing major. Don't worry. But I need to get him back to the Tower ASAP."
"I want it, Steve. I want this kid."
"Have you ever heard it before?" Steve asked with a glance to him.
Barnes just reached over and clapped him on the back. "Ah, come on! I didn't mean anything by it!"
Tony startled a bit, not really sure how to respond. It had been just over twenty years, and it wasn't like he and Howard had been on the best of terms
On the other hand, it did make him wonder how good a lover he'd been in the past. He couldn't possibly

there would be disgusting and click-baity titles attached to them.
"Lot's changed since Hydra got their hands on you," Barton said. "The Pill. Free love. Trickle- down economics. The McRib. Your little virginal pal turned into a sex god."
As he put the sandwich together, he heard Olivia quietly singing some song to herself — a really old one, he thought, maybe even from the forties, which...yeah, would probably make sense if the Cap was really her 'Daddy' — and when he turned around to hand her sandwich over, he saw that she was drawing patterns on the tabletop with her index finger, seemingly lost in her own little world. He set the sandwich down, and she stopped what she was doing and eyed it a moment before she said in a small voice, "Papa cuts it into little triangles."
"Yeah, you aren't really up on your 1991 through about 2008 gossip, are you?"
"No, you're not," Bucky said, seeming to agree. "You went and got all…respectable."
"You're lazy. The machine literally does all the work for you except putting the dishes in and taking the dishes out."
He closed his mouth and swallowed, his throat choked with emotion, and Steve had set the fork down and was resting his arms on the table, gazing thoughtfully at him. He reached up and brushed away some of those stupid tears that had collected on his eyelashes, and Steve reached out and brushed a few dark tendrils of hair away from his face.
"Who says we keep that shit to the bedroom?"
doing this!"
Tony turned and saw the entire pajama-clad brood filing into the room one after the other: Natasha followed by Barton and Wilson and Barnes (who kept trying to get around Wilson only to have his way blocked each time) and Bruce (who at least appeared to have shaved since he'd drained blood from him) with Thor bringing up the rear. He frowned at them, watching as they all situated themselves around the island, taking what Tony had come to realize were their 'usual' spots, and he folded his arms and said, "What the hell are you people doing here?"
