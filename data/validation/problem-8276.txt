Tony stared at her. He couldn’t tell what was worse: that he was about to be caught out in his own lie, or that she had known of such a specimen and failed to hook him up. And she called herself his friend??
He would return. They needed him; as disliked as Steve was, sometimes Sharon felt like she was the only one who knew how badly they needed him.
“Excuse me,” he choked out instead and ran away.
Steve was stunned. The comment came right out of left field, an arrangement of words that Steve never thought he would hear. He stared at Tony as if he’d told him Santa decorated his front porch with Rudolph’s hide.
“No, that’s not what I mean,” Carol interrupted him, speaking firmly but without raising her voice. “Steve, think about it. James said they were really manipulative assholes, they would know how to push his buttons.”
“Officer Jane Foster, allow me to introduce Captain Steven G. Rogers,” Tony said in slow, patient words that gave Jane the chance to compose herself. The young officer did her best, tugging her jacket into place and standing up straight with her shoulders back.
“Yes, ma’am,” he promised.
“Never have I met a man so happy to lose,” Tony teased as his ‘defeated’ husband indulged in his extensive consolation.
“How’s that feeling, Rogers?” he asked then with quiet, cautious words. “You think that’s going to be enough, or should I get something more serious?”
It hurts like hell.”
“I’ll take care of him,” she said, and for the first time, it didn’t sound indecent; it sounded affectionate and protective. “You two watch each other’s backs out there, you hear?”
“Yeah, I’m fine, Tony, don’t worry. I’m okay. But, uh, Tony,” he said, wetting his dry lips and the decision came to him so easily then, when his world had narrowed down to the concern and affection staring back at him in Tony’s eyes. From one stuttering heartbeat to the next, Steve became determined to do what he knew was right. This was his chance; Tony might say no, but what kind of man was Steve if he wasn't honest? If he didn’t try? He swallowed back the bitter lump in his throat and found his voice again.
This is the best chicken soup i’ve ever had
Tony slipped his hand further into Steve’s, and as Steve had asked, he led the way down Harrington. As promised, it was only a block away from Maitre Choux. Tony told him about the projects he had been folded into at work, and the handful of graduate students he was supporting through their dissertations. One of them was even working on solar powered continuous glucose monitor that Tony was really excited about, though they still had work to do on the software.
She watched him cautiously and kept her hands in her lap. She wouldn’t stop staring. “Your Majesty, are you well? We all saw… we saw what happened,” she lowered her voice to say, clearly trying to be gentle about something so awful.
- catch Brock’s eye.
“You’re quite the inspiring muse,” Tony teased in a soft whisper. “But even I can’t write that fast. Would you like to see how it begins?”
Even with his mouth stretched around the thick base of Steve’s cock, Tony slipped his tongue out to slobber saliva over Steve’s balls. There was no question what he wanted, and given his admirable behavior so far this evening, Steve had no reason to deny him. He pulled Tony back by his hair until the head of his cock rested against Tony’s panting, wet, open mouth, and with two quick strokes, Steve emptied himself into Tony’s mouth. Tony struggled to swallow all of it, and while Steve privately relished the pretty picture of his come painted across Tony’s face, this was meant to be Tony’s reward, not his punishment. Before it was too late, Steve pulled Tony’s mouth down over his cock again so that all of his come would fill and comfort his pet.
“I know just the thing,” Jan promised, and as Steve grabbed his leather duffle and work bag, she got the hint and made to follow him out of the apartment. “I’ll send you two options today.”
Tony clearly frowned by Steve’s unexpected suggestion, but Steve got out of there before Tony could ask him any more questions and wake up further. Steve was still waking up himself as he wandered down the stairs, got the coffee started, and with a big yawn he opened the door to grab the morning paper.
On the morning of his first full day in Seoul, Steve woke up to a video from Jim where Tony and Lila were showing the PM’s children the stable of royal horses where they all visit Damask, the little black foal descended from Hypatia’s sire. Damask would one day be Steve’s horse, but for now, it was an excitable, curious bundle of nerves and curiosity that - to the children’s delight - would do almost anything for treats.
Eventually, Tony had enough. Sitting in his hot tub and watching his phone was pointless. He climbed out of the jacuzzi, bundled against the winter chill in a thick bathrobe, and made his way to his suite. Water dripped in his wake, leaving a trail from his rooftop lounge, through the apartment, and into his closet. He had left Duckie sleeping in his bed in the morning when he left for his workshop. She had stayed with him for months on and off, but aside for the small collection of toiletries next to the second sink in his bathroom, there was no sign of her presence. He had not invited her to more, and she had not asked for a drawer or space to hang up her clothes. They both liked it that way.
“And we especially didn’t want to see you skewered by a scared cow!”
“Feet on the bench,” Steve instructed once Tony had adjusted enough to stopped squirming and whimpering on the full length of his cock. “And, remember: everybody is watching.”
“I came here with Tony Stark,” Tony heard Steve saying after some time, and some of the Scraps turned to glance his way. Their looks didn’t convey loathing as strongly as Tony had expected, but they weren’t particularly kind either.
The audience laughed, and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle, too, though in the end he just shrugged it off. “Once you get past the Louboutin, Peter Parker is the least intimidating person you could imagine. It doesn’t matter how famous you become, you’re still a person at the end of the day, and if you’re nice, people will want to spend time with you. I mean, listen. I do it every day: Tony is my partner and my best friend,” he added in a show of giddy playfulness he rarely revealed on camera, “but if you don’t think I’m his biggest fan, too—I see his movies in theaters - by myself or with friends though, because if you take Tony to a movie he’s in, he won’t stop talking. And he’s got all these incredible fans, too, there’s a great community online that I’ve been following for years,
“I see this is where you have been hiding today, Your Majesty.”
If anyone else had spoken, or an hour had gone by, Tony didn’t notice. All that existed was Colin Farrell and his gorgeous, Irish voice. “…say that last part again,” Tony purred, “but slower.”
Steve frowned a little to himself, but it wasn’t like he could hide forever. When Tony cupped his cheek, he pressed into it gently, then opened his eyes to look up at Tony.
Tony gasped dramatically at the betrayal. “Then watch me win
“What would be the fucking point? Everything is illegal,” Steve muttered while the morality box charged him another five credits. “Wait, is sodomy illegal again?”
“Steve?” Tony slurred, his voice still hoarse from sleep. “What’s goin’ on?”
Of all the things Tony could ask in the middle of a confession of his feelings (that Steve refused to call love yet), that wasn’t close to what Steve expected. His cheeks and the back of his neck warmed so quickly he knew he was blushing, and he couldn’t help but laugh and roll his eyes at himself.
The question caught Steve by surprise, and he straightened enough to put distance between their lips. It was almost enough for Tony to regret his question.
Tony shivered in his arms. He pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, and with shaking fingers he clutched at the cavalry jacket Steve wore. A lifetime of instruction and coaching made any outward expression of vulnerability impossible, but Steve wasn’t only his spouse and partner. Rather than a Crown Prince or a Prince Consort, Steve was his equal, in rank and in power, and while titles meant little to Steve, he had learned that it made a difference to Tony, who had never had an equal.
He sent Steve the edited video, preceding it with the caption,
Tony.”
Adding insult to injury, this was the most physical attention Tony had received in weeks. It didn’t matter that his hole burned from the extensive and abrasive intrusion, that tears stained his cheeks, or that every time the master’s blunt teeth scraped over his balls, Tony felt faint with fear. By the time Steve reacted to his pet’s unexpected shout and freed Tony from the master’s greedy mouth, Tony’s balls were drawn up against his body, his cock was leaking precome all over his abdomen, and his thighs were tender and quivering with need.
As they arrived to their floor, Tony led them down to the left. “My domicile is this way,” he started to explain. He showed Steve how to open the scanning pad, then invited Steve to press his palm to the scanner himself. “It will not hurt, Steve Rogers. Just a light touch will do.”
“I trust you, Tony,” he swore, “whatever happens, I trust you. I want to be with you, but I can’t do that if I can’t be honest.”
“Yes,” she said after a brief pause, not bothering to remind him he had no right to ask such a question. “Four years.”
Josh mirrored Steve’s amusement with a smile as he continued. “You know, at that first screening, I remember the audience came out of it looking really shaken. The movie carries this… very human element to it that is unique and gritty, and it’s uncomfortably real. You’re putting forward a side of American gothic we haven’t seen before. How has the experience been so far?”
Steve shrugged, confused by Brock’s apparent disbelief. “What, like it’s hard?”
With a gasp, Steve arched off the bed and, without thinking, brought his hands up to fist Tony’s hair in his surprise. Tony whimpered around his mouthful at the sudden sting of pain, and immediately let go of Steve’s nipple.
“I’ve had your cooking,” Steve said in soft, delighted words. “Of course I’ll say yes.”
Using the tunnels, they got to the Governor’s offices in no time. Tony unlocked the door with his palm print, and they breezed past the security guards who were not expected or trained to engage in human altercations.
“Your trust and your affection are for me to earn, not for you to prove,” Tony said slowly, and with the gravity of a promise. “You never have to prove anything to me, Steve.”
Steve startled out of his thoughts and it took him a moment to find Tony standing beside him. Tony smiled back at him when Steve’s gaze finally focused on him, and he sunk back on the couch to find his place under Steve’s protective arm.
Steve woke up the next morning and found himself in bed, undressed to his boxers. His head was throbbing and half his face felt tight and weird. It took a minute before he spared a thought for the world around him and realized someone was in bed beside him. Was it possible that last night hadn’t just been a terrible dream? Had he been punched in the face at a screening of Batman Returns? Had Tony taken care of him all night, waking him up every two hours to be sure there were no lasting symptoms of his injury?
He closed his eyes, let his head fall back against Steve’s shoulder, and as a broad paw of a hand dragged its heavy claws across Tony’s soft inner thigh, Tony dared to imagine what it would be like to be forced into a position where he would be taken by any and all who wanted him.
“I think that’s a very good place to start.”
“Ze did,” Steve replied absently, rolling the sleeve down over the full length of his cock before lining up and pushing into Tony with one slow, smooth thrust. A whimper escaped Tony’s lips, and he moaned deeply on his next breath as he did his best to adjust to Steve’s imposing girth.
“Fine. I’m leaving two men with you,” Bucky conceded, “I’ll take Natasha. I’ll call as soon as we find him.”
“Didn’t two new offers come in for you yesterday?”
“Can, uh. Can you function like, you know. Like a human man?”
Finally, Clint sighed. He could only think of one way out of this mess.
The news anchor interrupted the footage to introduce an audio recording of the king’s address to the royal guard. They called it his final speech.
Steve’s curious confusion turned stiff and alert at the sound of Tony’s name. “What? No. He’s busy with the election. What’s happened, Buck?”
“That’s fine with me,” Steve assured him, “I like long drives.”
“Approaching critical overthinking tipping-point,” Tony whispered in his mock-narrative of Steve’s play-by-play.
Steve choked on a laugh before he could contain himself. “Tony! After all the practice Bucky got babysitting me before our engagement, I’m pretty sure nobody’s getting past him. Myself included.”
But Steve gave him the same long-suffering and grudgingly amused side-eye he always did, and instead of expressing frustration with Tony’s mixed signals, he gave Tony one of the four hot dogs he ordered and continued his earlier train of thought. “Did you have anything on your plate except our story on Wayne HR?”
It was only a few minutes past four in the morning, not that that mattered anymore either. He thumbed at his phone with clumsy fingers, found Pepper’s contact, and called her. When she didn’t pick up the first or second or third time, he climbed out of bed, threw on his robe and walked across the hall to bang on her door.
“You know, Clint was telling me about how great you were when you competed. The best of your generation, he said,” Steve said quietly when Rhodey was out of earshot. “I’d love to see what that looks like.”
“I do, Pookie,” Brock assured him with a quick flash of his smoldering smirk, the one that always left Steve weak in the knees. “But the thing is, if I’m gonna be a senator by the time I’m thirty, I can't keep dicking around.”
Kill, sure, but what about maim? Tony really didn’t want to be the first.
Steve responded with a deep, predatory growl. “Think you’re ready, Tony? Ready to take it?”
“That pretty much became the deciding factor,” Tony agreed, “it was either ‘Red, White, and Brew,’ or ‘I Miss Brew.’”
Steve laid a hand on Tony’s forearm to stop him there. He squeezed Tony’s arm gently in a silent expression of his appreciation, but he didn’t need anyone to fight his bullies for him.
Steve,
“My friend from work, Pepper—your mom met her, actually—”
His hair was in wild disarray, he had pulled his jeans and (probably) Steve’s shirt on before stepping out. He was still rubbing sleep out of his eyes when he came around with small, drowsy steps, following his nose directly to the kitchen. Tony draped himself against Steve’s side and nuzzled into his neck with a playful little rumble.
“Please,” Tony whispered, speaking softly so only Steve would hear. “Eyesight is precious and fragile, Captain Steven G. Rogers. You must give it time.”
“A good signal that I do what?” Steve drawled. “That I’d rather wear silk than buy groceries?”
“Absolutely,” Tony promised. He’d meant to say more, maybe boast a little about how that wasn’t all he could do given the right data, but his words caught in his throat when Steve’s lips turned up in a hesitant but hopeful smile. It was the first time in the past seven months that anything Tony had said or done made Steve smile.
Tony grimaced at the thought, but found he couldn’t disagree. Steve’s assessment rang too true. He took a look around the kitchen to be sure he’d picked up everything, then put the kettle on for tea. Chamomile was necessary after the day he’d had.
“I think he’s just demonstrated he’s well matched for your guys, Buck,” Steve drawled. For a moment, Tony blushed at such a blatant expression of pride, but then he noticed Bucky rolling his eyes and snickering, and Steve smirk, and it occurred to him slowly that Steve’s intention had been to tease Bucky.
Bucky was on his heel in an instant. “Steve, what are you—Steve!” he snapped and shut the safe where Steve kept his weapons from his time in the army. “You know we can’t do that, what do you think you’re doing?”
“Tony, you,” he choked out, but he could get no further, and all around him Tony could hear echoes of feet rushing and chairs scraping across the floor outside their private room in the restaurant. Any second they’d be interrupted by people who knew better.
“James Barnes,” Tony said to Bucky while Steve was busy receiving a hero’s welcome. “We seek the multi-MDK maniac Rumlow, also known as Crossbones. He has evaded our surveillance for many days, and Steve Rogers believes he is doing so by hiding in the tunnels. Do you know where he could be?”
“Captain Carter’s not gonna sink more detective hours into this,” Natasha said, “it’s only us.”
“Jane Foster? Wow,” Sharon couldn’t help but say. “Nicely done.”
“Now, you two go wash up, get dressed. Ties!” she insisted, “You have twenty five minutes, go!”
“I told her I was going to ‘meet the parents,’ and—it’s not like she knows much about my life, she just—I talk to her once a month at most, about what clothes I need,” Steve explained, the lie spilling from his lips easier with every word. “Maybe I said something, or, or she just extrapolated, but, uh. She sent me these.”
“Sounds great, Steve. I can’t wait, I’ll see you then,” Tony smiled warmly into the phone before hanging up.
“No, we concluded the day early,” Tony said with a smile and scooted his armchair closer. “In the spirit of ‘my husband deserves to stop studying and start celebrating Christmas.’”
Apparently it could get worse than his partner crushing on his godfather. So much worse.
“So let’s focus on that,” Steve suggested and walked over to Bucky’s desk with his notes from the night before. “Tony’s been—”
Tony walked up to the unassuming little restaurant on Cahuenga. Nobody bothered him, nobody stopped him for autographs or questions, or did any of the things that he knew happened to Steve on a regular basis. Quietly, he prayed he’d been right about this place, that he had chosen a small enough spot that even the people’s Captain America could walk in for dinner in peace.
“Liked th’show?” Tony wondered, his words slurring drowsily.
, moving them to the bed and ease them back down, taking care with laying Tony back on the sheets and following him down, covering him, rocking slowly and gently into him through his orgasm.
“This has been a tough case, Steve. You had my back when it mattered, I won’t forget that,” Tony told him in a calm, gentle voice. For once in this whole mess of hope and excitement and insanity that was his partnership and friendship with Steve, he knew precisely what he wanted.
Tony was going to throw himself to the wolves and hope it was enough.
“Buttered biscuits and baked brie,” Steve added, and Tony just moaned with delight. “And a side of homemade apricot jam.”
“Tony, your nose is really cold,” Steve warned him quietly, but Tony only cuddled in closer.
“First of all, none of your business: I don’t kiss and tell,” Tony told her, scandalized by the mere suggestion that he’d ever share such information.
Carol didn’t say anything for a long time. She texted a cease and desist to Sam and Bucky, but otherwise remained silent. Instead, she ordered herself a Coke, and she sat next to Steve for a long, long time. As long as it took.
“Brock,” he said excitedly, and the two haughty lovebirds stopped what they were doing and looked at him. “Remember the time after Winter Formal? When we spent four incredible hours in the hot tub?”
They said goodbye to Dum-E, shut down the lab, and made it back to Tony’s dorm room within the hour. Tony’s energy was fading fast, and Steve helped Tony to his desk. He left Tony sitting there for a few minutes while he filled up the tub and dug through Tony’s closet for clean linens. With all the practice of growing up with a nurse for a mother, Steve managed to pull the bedsheets off Tony’s bed and get fresh sheets down before the water levels became dangerously high.
“They’re made here in Brooklyn,” he explained when Bucky had been silent for a little too long. “You don’t—if you don’t think she’ll like it, you don’t have to, you know—don’t feel obligated, it’s okay—”
Agneta must have been lost in her own thoughts, because it took her some time to realize someone had spoken to her. It took her longer still to recognize him. She looked old enough to have grown up with Howard as her first king, which meant she would have seen photos of Tony since he was born. She rallied to attention, sitting up straight while trying to bow her head out of respect.
They went to the bank, but that was as far as they got with their plans. Everything derailed after Steve made a comment about how Tony could easily infer London’s early history and development by studying a map of the city streets.
Tony’s playful expression fell into awkward disgust. It wasn’t every day Tony Stark looked stumped, and Steve inwardly preened from his front row seat to the spectacle of Tony processing Steve’s comparison and the realization that inevitably dawned on his face.
“We got through everything in my notebook, so Scott gave us a list of comedies to catch up on,” Steve answered simply. “To balance out the depressing things.”
Cut to an entirely different kind of foe, one that Steve (despite his best efforts) can't punch in the face.
Hours later, when he stirred awake by the early signs of dawn, Steve made up his mind. He rolled Tony over again, letting the boy lie on his belly while Steve knelt between his spread legs. He had three more canisters to fill before they could go home.
“Sorry,” Steve started to say and back out, but the man seemed to come to life and waved him in.
It took a moment for Tony to catch his breath and clear his head. Bond knew what he was doing, Tony could practically feel the cocky smirk in Bond’s voice. That smug bastard.
Tony steadily towed Steve towards the bar where Rhodey would presumably be, but Steve was so busy taking in the scene that he had trouble keeping up. And, cliche as it was, that mechanical bull was particularly intriguing.
“Even better.”
His peace didn’t last for forty minutes.
They were standing in the entryway of Tony’s living room. It was not large, but it was plenty for one, and to the right, there was even a small dining area leading to a kitchen. All of the furniture in the living room, the dining room, and what of the kitchen that Steve could see from the doorway, was a compulsive man’s nostalgic ode to 60’s diners that never existed in the 60’s. Posters set in glossy white frames hung in the living room to commemorate Carl Sagan’s
Steve recognized the look on his face and started packing up. “You’re on the job,” he said without preamble. “No. No, you’re not going to give those assholes running the lab any ammunition against you,” he insisted, even grabbing the paper plate Tony was still using in his hurry to clear off the table and get them moving.
Maria stomped out of the kitchen in her Sunday best and a mean look. Both boys straightened in alarm, as if they’d somehow gotten caught in the middle of misbehaving.
Maybe Steve could sense his reluctance, or he simply didn’t like the thought of Tony working on a hungry stomach, but Tony could feel Steve grow tense under him. Instead of voicing his thoughts, Steve only pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s temple and said, “We have yesterday’s shredded barbecue chicken. How about a quesadilla? You can eat it in the tub, or in bed.”
Did he watch the source material to form his own opinion? No.
“Tony Stark trusted me to support you in his stead,” she told him, as if there was nothing unusual about standing sentry at his side in a barbershop.
Steve liked where her head was at, but when he looked at Natasha, her expression was as unclear as ever. When she finally spoke, it caught Steve well off guard.
But Tony didn’t look as calm as he sounded. If anything, he looked tired and anxious, like he was waiting for the final blow to come any second.
Now, Steve wanted nothing more than to be the little spoon. He wanted to feel Tony’s heartbeat steady and reassuring against his back; he wanted to feel his even breathing warm his neck. He wanted to hold those calloused, scarred hands in his hands until he fell asleep, and cradle them throughout the night whether they twitched in Tony’s dreams of endless paperwork, or they clenched in the odd nightmares that followed the less humane duties of his position.
. The Flower Crown should have been mi—”
It was the future Steve struggled with. Imagining a future without Tony was still miserable, and now, talking about where he would be living in New York after graduation cut him in a way no physical wound could hurt. How could Tony talk about home as if it was a place? How perfectly had Steve failed in his expression of love and commitment that Tony hadn’t learned that
“This is Tony Stark,” Tony answered the phone and made sure to shut his door for privacy.
in the design of lace garters. There were only two sizes available, and Steve totally knew how to put tights on. Maybe this wasn’t so scary after all.
“Warm me up in your bed,” Tony whispered, reaching to brush the pad of his thumb over Steve’s full bottom lip. “I’ve been waiting all week, Steve. It’s baby-making time, are you really going to make me wait any longer?”
“Now, unless you’re some kind of millenial polygamist, it looks to me like you’ve got someone mailing you a selection of engagement rings. Does that sound like love to you, Steve?”
Steve looked at Bucky. “Which way, Buck?”
But god, it was a good life to live.
Steve could feel his neck and his face warming up. “Uh. About that,” he said as casually as he could, but Bucky was already narrowing his eyes at him.
Strong, gentle fingers stroked through his hair, easing Tony back to consciousness.
“Anyone ever tell you,” Steve whispered, brushing his fingers through Tony’s hair, “that you are gorgeous first thing in the morning?”
“That’s it?” Flora wondered out loud, frowning a little in her concentration.
Steve must have sensed some distinction between the way Tony mumbled his name now and how he had said it before in the heat of the moment; without releasing his mouthful, Steve looked up Tony’s body to meet his eyes, and he hummed around Tony’s balls in question. Another full-body shudder rolled through Tony from the divine vibrations of Steve’s mouth, and he was just about to attempt speaking when Steve dug in against Tony’s perennium with the knuckle of his thumb, twisting and grinding to stimulate his prostate from another angle. With his fingers teasing it from the inside, and the firm pressure of his thumb from the outside, Tony’s mouth fell open with a silent gasp, and he melted back into the firm cushions of the couch.
Tony pursed his lips in consideration. “A 16th century villa with original, hand-painted tiles.”
“She was helping me find an engagement ring for you.”
,” Steve complained, “that’s not the point! The point is, I looked up for one second between positions and he was right there. Staring at me. I was face to face with MLK’s portrait.”
The third victim was the one who’d finally convinced Steve that this was all a bigger case. He’d been a quiet philosophy student at Columbia University, a privileged young man with a clear plan in life, whom his friends described as someone who only pulled his nose out of books twice a week to practice Capoeira. He’d been missing for almost ten months until a few weeks ago, when his remains were found behind his old apartment building.
Warning: sexy-time tags apply here.
Before Tony finished snarking about his tragic lot in life, Steve abruptly cut him off by tugging Tony’s chair away from the desk and spinning him around. Speechless, Tony watched Steve sink to his knees between Tony’s feet.
A sudden knock on Hawley’s office door shattered the tension in the room, and Steve jerked up in his seat to put as much distance as he could between himself and the professor. Whoever was on the other side of the door didn’t wait to be invited, but brazenly pushed the door open and stepped into the room.
“Happy,” he said slowly as he hesitated on the curb, staring up at the imposing grandeur of the hotel he had no business going to for a casual lunch. “Is Tony here?”
A shrill note of white noise filled Tony’s head.
Tony blushed furiously at the Steve’s word choice, while distantly the morality box spewed a ticket and announced, “Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are fined five credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
“You are not the first to remind me that your safety is none of my business, Tony. But you know as well as I do that in my absence James will find fewer obstacles in his job, he’ll be able to protect you more effectively.”
He could have sworn he heard Steve chuckling in the distance. “Yeah? And why’s that, Stark? So you can lock me up for doing my job again?”
“I called Dr. Betz, Natasha is on her way to personally escort her to the palace,” Pepper began with an unflappable calm that Steve appreciated now more than ever. “The four scheduled meetings can be postponed without major consequences, I will make those calls personally. The only time sensitive appointment this week is in two days with the US Secretary of State.”
It’s a stormy, gloomy winter night, and nobody wanted to watch any of Sam’s three movie suggestions. The majority didn’t want to watch
“Yes.”
“My dear acquaintance Virginia Potts serves as the Editor of Archival Media in the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. She recently discovered a set of cinematic discs from the 21st century, which she generously copied for me. I spent this entire weekend studying the cinematic re-enactment of the fabled hero Captain America!”
Brock’s mouth clicked shut, but that didn’t soothe the sudden anger burning in Steve’s chest.
The tension in Steve’s posture faded so quickly he nearly melted off his seat, and before Tony noticed the enormous, goofy grin of relief on his face, he hid his expression again by polishing off the last half of his beer.
Tony couldn’t resist singing along to the classic tunes with a bright smile on his face. “They are mini-tunes, but I believe in your time you called them commercials, or advertising jingles. They are most cheerful and evocative - does it not bring back fond memories, Steve Rogers?”
“You come into my house, and you say ‘who?’” Steve growled into his hair with feigned anger thundering in every word. “We respect Tolkien in this house, you weasel—”
’. “Oh, he did. In the middle of set—but I got him back, I beat him in a hundred meter sprint.”
“Five exclamation marks,” Steve noted dryly, interrupting her with the only thought he had on the issue. With his poor approval of Jean clearly expressed, he easily moved on. “Table everything; Sitwell first.”
“Until last week, I thought the serum would keep me like this forever. That nothing would change for me, but I’d have to watch you and the team grow old. I never thought I’d be—that the serum wouldn’t take that from me. What you told me last week was a dream come true, and since that day, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you”
Tony heard Steve rumble in his discontent and pull the blankets up around them before he realized he’d been shivering. Steve must have mistaken Tony’s shivering for feeling cold, and Tony didn’t correct him. He indulged in the way Steve bundled him up closer and gently rested his cheek against the back of Tony’s head as they sat together in silence for a while.
As a gold class officer, Bruce outranked Tony. There was no reason for him to follow through with Tony’s request or to do as Tony said. But they both knew that the treasure of having a family with a woman he cared deeply for was greater than any duty, and the fear of losing it all too much to bear. So Bruce nodded, and he promised to do as Tony asked.
He pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead and leapt out of bed.
“By your own account, you have not met anyone whom you are willing to trust in eight years. In all the time you have been away from home,” Dr. Odinson summarized. “How does that make you feel, Tony?”
Tony’s laugh still carried in his voice as he finally conceded. “Saturday, eleven o’clock. It’s a date.”
With a few grumbles and a lot of yawns, Tony reluctantly agreed that Steve was right and finally hung up. Steve pocketed his phone and sat down to read the card again. Just because Tony needed to rest didn’t mean Steve couldn’t be close to him.
In a place so foreign and different from anything he’d known, he had friends in his peer group and an ally among the faculty. There was no telling how any of this would shake out, but Steve could live with that. Good people were reaching out to let him know he wasn’t alone, and for now - for Steve - that was enough.
“Tomorrow is the Wayne Charity Ball. Tony Stark’s big dream finally come true?”
Or, that’s what Tony had come to expect.
Tony moaned in delight at the sudden attention, already close to the edge and hungry for a fuck himself. The thought that his body had such immediate effects on whatever Steve was thrilled him; in this alien world, this was a source of power he sorely lacked otherwise, and it left him heady with excitement over the possibilities. So while Steve tried to get off with quick but painfully dry frottage, Tony sucked down one of his own fingers, coating it with as much spit as he could before reaching down and sweeping his wet finger over Steve’s full bottom lip.
“Long live the king,” the anchor echoed in a somber tone. “No comment yet from King Steven, who is currently in Berlin to negotiate the potential expansion of Stark Intellicrops into the global market.”
But Tony wouldn’t be alone. He had Rhodey. Rhodey, who was there from the start when Tony first fled, who helped Tony try to pull himself together to get past Steve. Anyone with access to internet or a TV would know Steve was in town, and even if Tony thought the city was big enough to preserve his anonymity, Rhodey wouldn’t leave it to chance. Rhodey would find a reason to be there at the youth center, just in case, because despite whatever Tony said, he wasn’t over it. He might not admit it, but just knowing that Steve was in town hurt him.
“It’s been a long week,” he whispered, weaseling his way into Steve’s personal space to slip his long, mischievous fingers under Steve’s soft flannel. Steve’s response was immediate. The sensation of Tony’s calloused fingertips drawing absent patterns over his skin teased a full body shudder from him, and he leaned in close, his dark eyes intent on Tony’s lips.
“In my defense,” Tony said over his excitable group that clearly had learned more about penises than any other school group in the zoo that day, “the bees also have exploding testicles.”
“You have one more job to do, my pet,” Steve told him quietly. “Then we can go.”
Steve sent off his last email while Bucky grunted and groaned and tried not to pull his hair in frustration. “So what if he’s read the Fellowship? What half-assed hipster hasn’t read Tolkien by now? Besides, he’s an author—”
“Oh, dear,” Bond snickered in undertone, clearly making an effort to communicate without being overheard. “I like you, is your mouth this filthy in person?”
Ci manchi = "we miss you"
Steve frowned at the thought. He pressed his lips together and held his breath, willing away the sudden and unwanted reminder of how one day he really would have to figure out his life without her.
“—you
Hell, if Tony didn’t love that man. He’d trade any Manhattan zip code for Brooklyn or the Bronx in a heartbeat. He’d eat ice cream in Van Cortlandt instead of in Central Park any day of the year, live in some average apartment building without a doorman and arm their home with his own damn security.
“Still feeling sassy, Rogers?” Tony growled down at his unrepentant partner. Steve batted his eyelashes up at him and opened his mouth to speak, but before Steve got a syllable out Tony cut him off with a kiss, a playful, biting thing that turned Steve’s delighted giggling into a quiet moan of satisfaction.
“Clint—well, he didn’t say, actually, but he said you weren’t talking about me. And, I. I don’t …if you don’t care, then I don’t care, Stephanie,” he finally said, more carefully. “I trust you, and, I care about you; I care about you very much, in fact. If, you would still have me, that is.”
Graham was out of his seat with gusto, and to the thunderous applause of the audience, he led Tony and Colin around to an attached, round platform beside the main stage. Two mats were already rolled out for them. Tony unbuttoned his suit jacket and held it out to Graham, and Colin soon did the same.
“I am not asking to have children with you, Tony,” Steve said more gently, and leaned in closer. “I’m not asking for a commitment. I’m asking for one night, together.”
about the price of freedom.”
The next morning, Tony woke up feeling better rested than he had all week. Clearing his conscience, the decision to prioritize someone special over a career move, and the relief that his feelings were reciprocated, it was all almost too good to be true.
“I’m not
Steve leaned in with a quick, chaste kiss, a last touch while they were still in private, before he opened the door and stepped out ahead of Tony. The coast was clear, not a soul in sight.
Your face sounds weird. Is it in town?
Bucky looked confused, but agreed without argument. The Scraps started picking up their scant gear and heading back, until Steve called Tony’s name. As one, they stopped in their tracks and stared back.
Steve couldn’t have contained his laughter if he’d tried. He leaned back in to kiss the bridge of Tony’s nose. “Mellow apologies, Tony,” he teased him quietly, sneaking kisses of Tony’s lips now and then between his words. “From now on, my kisses will be yours and only yours for all tick tocks to come.”
Careful of Steve’s recently recovered injuries, Tony sat up and straddled Steve’s midsection. “Let me get this straight,” he asked in a playful parody of an interrogating officer. “You wanted sex, but you invited me out at
“You straight people always say that like it’s an insult,” he said quietly, but it was the flash of hurt in his eyes and his resigned expression that had Steve choking on his words.
The next Monday Steve was over forty minutes early to Platt, Hawley & Associates. He parked his car in the farthest corner of the parking lot and did his best to control his breathing on his relatively long walk to the lobby. Hawley’s office door was still closed, and Steve was too jittery to sit still in the lobby.
“Something to check off the list before he shows up on set this summer?” Josh said with a laugh. “If Spider-Man is mysteriously written out of the fifth Captain America movie… we’ll know why. But to bring it back, this story, we’ve had some questions amongst ourselves now of why, what brought you to this project. I believe this was your only project last year, is that right? What was it about this story that stood out to you?”
approach them from behind? If Steve could see in the dark, the safest place for him would be in the front of the line. Steve would see an oncoming attack and have a chance to prepare himself, or have a chance to run if Tony was mauled from behind.
Steve’s constant presence hadn’t always been easy to deal with; Tony’s studio was already small, and Steve’s limited ability to move or do things for himself made things worse. But even when he was miserable and bored, Steve had managed to ask for space and silence, and he didn’t take it personally when Tony left the studio for hours for some much-needed privacy. Sometimes all Tony needed to find an even keel again was to go down to the local pub, enjoy a pint or two while pretending to follow the game.
Beside him, Bucky, Carol, and Sharon applauded and hollered at the top of their voice when Sam’s name was called. Carol’s wolf whistle might have even rattled eardrums. Steve quickly put his phone away to join in the ruckus, and by the time Sam made his way across the stage, accepted his degree, and completed the herd, Steve forgot about Tony’s last text.
him,” Steve replied, adjusting in his seat, half-heartedly busying himself with putting little touches here and there for highlights and shadows while Sharon got herself settled on her end of the work bench.
Tony waited with bated breath and barefaced hope, and, luckily, he didn’t have to wait very long. He couldn’t see his own face, but by the way Steve rolled his eyes and quietly chuckled with a slow shake of his head, Tony figured looking goofy was better than not having cinnamon buns with breakfast.
He’d almost convinced himself when Bucky marched off.
“I got you,” he whispered, and when Steve blinked his eyes open and looked into Tony’s eyes, he found himself believing him. “You’re safe, Steve, it’s my idiot—”
“Whatever you did or didn’t do, he has no right to talk to anybody that way,” Steve said as he turned to face the man waiting for them in the lobby.
Tony didn’t speak the whole drive home, and for that, Steve was grateful. If he had to hear one more word about ‘venerable Governor Alexander G. Pierce,’ he was going to start throwing punches. On one hand, Steve was glad this long, impossible day was finally over, but on the other hand, he was growing increasingly concerned with the presumed sleeping arrangements. He had been frozen for decades, his skin ached to be touched, and thanks to the adrenaline spike following the chaos outside Taco Bell, his blood was still pumping in overtime for any kind of gratifying release.
Steve kept it simple: a machine with a collecting canister attached on a piston rod, and an adjustable sleeve that could be fitted over a hard cock or a fist to simultaneously harvest and inject from Tony’s body directly to the wearer. The sleeve cut out any intervening process, and allowed whoever was fucking the human to mainline his hormones directly, making Tony irresistible—and, most importantly, priceless.
“But his heart was still beating—”
That night, Steve had turned off his alarm. He’d put in enough hours at work already, and he was so tired by the time he and Tony crawled into bed to sleep that he wouldn’t be good to anyone if he didn’t get any sleep. And still his phone woke him much too early at 6:40 the next morning.
“You were fucking me five hours ago, how much more real—”
There was no fate in hell bad enough for the man responsible for writing those lines.
“I was cursed never to return,” Stephanie explained in a patient voice. “My curse will only be broken when a Chief of my kin becomes my bride. Are you here to bring me to her? Tell me, what is her name?”
Still can’t believe you pulled off this look
Steve reached out with his tongue and lapped at Tony’s balls while he still could, all but slurping the soft skin up into his mouth. Tony choked on a shout of surprise, and around him, Steve responded with a deep, guttural moan. The blood drained into his cock so fast Tony was sure he was becoming dangerously lightheaded, and he barely managed to keep his eyes open and on Steve’s face, but he was transfixed. As his cock grew harder, Tony stared, wide-eyed, as Steve’s spit-slick lips stretched obscenely around its girth, and Tony could practically feel Steve’s throat being rubbed raw with every eager bob of his head.
Tony’s expression turned grim, but he didn’t let it stop him. “Targeted interventions are easier,” he promised. “We can fund post-doctoral fellowships for psychologists specializing in family and trauma counselling to work out of small clinics in villages.”
With his back arched and turned towards Steve, Tony reached behind his head to jerk Steve in for an insistent and covetous kiss. Steve stilled his hips and hurried to sweep his hands up from Tony’s hips to brace his weight in the difficult position, holding him as they kissed. And since the position made it so very tempting, Steve pinched and tugged on Tony’s exposed nipples, made so vulnerable to his touch while Tony turned his body and reached back for him.  He released it to grope and knead Tony’s firm chest in his big palms, and just when Tony relaxed into his firm massage, Steve rolled and tugged his nipples sharply between his fingers, teasing him until Tony all but shook in Steve’s strong arms.
Steve had never been so amused at being proved wrong. He grinned at Tony in return, and reached back to give his knee a pat. “Maybe next time,” he promised with a smile still in his voice.
“Yeah,” Tony grinned, and with a mischievous wink he held his jackets open so Steve could better see the design. The t-shirt hugged him without looking inappropriately small, and despite Steve’s best efforts, his mouth ran dry at the clear outline of Tony’s strong, lean torso, his narrowing hips, and the obvious outline of the swell of his ass in those jeans.
“A coke, a coke is good; no ice!”
“Forget coffee in bed: you make the coffee now, that’s number one,” Steve started listing off his future crimes, and Tony was so upset and heartbroken that he dissolved into a fit of giggling again. “Two: I’m never shaving again.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony slurred, half-asleep. “So sorry, Steve… never, never wanted to leave you.”
“It’s only a start, but the schools onboard with re-introducing shop classes to build houses for vets have seen great results. The kids seem to get a lot out of it, teachers say that working together toward a common goal is bringing them together, and the homes they’re creating are really something else.”
She didn’t seem relaxed enough in his company to lie down, so Tony found another pillow to support her back so she could sit up more comfortably. Then he sat down in a plastic chair provided for visitors, a very clear sign that he had no intention of leaving soon.
The man wrinkled his nose and waved him around, encouraging him to take a seat at the nearest empty manicure station. “I got you, take a seat.”
Tony opened his eyes again to take in the creatures crowding around him. They stood much closer now, almost close enough to reach out and claw at Tony’s exposed thighs themselves, but this time Tony savored their sadistic pleasure. Their hunger was palpable, and knowing he was what they craved fed into his depraved fantasy. To them, he was only a body to be used, to be fucked and milked in turn as a source of temporary relief. They would take him all at once if they could, choking him with their cocks and tearing into his ass two or three at a time, heedless to anything but their own satisfaction.
“I didn’t want to go too fast, I thought I’d let you drive. Kansas is a little different from New York, I didn’t want to pressure you or, you know. Make you uncomfortable.”
Tony tried his best to keep a straight face, but Steve caught a flash of his grin before Tony could hide it behind a mouthful of food.
“They’re not even engaged,” Rhodey said. “Maybe they’re announcing their engagement?”
“Interesting friends you got there,” Tony told Steve with a look that left Steve dying to know what those two had said. Before he could ask, however, Tony turned his attention to Bucky.
“Well,” Steve said after a moment, then, figuring he had little to lose, and Tony didn’t exactly strike him as KGB or the likes thereof. He shifted in his seat and pulled out a singed USB. “Think you could get into this?”
“Can you walk?”
People barely noticed them when they joined the market. They were as noteworthy as any other couple without blue sashes or ermine to decorate their respective wool coats, and instead of shiny designer shoes, they wore sturdy boots made for the winter weather. Tony had even indulged in wearing his old red and gold scarf that his mother had knitted for him while she was pregnant. They told him she had worked on it a little bit every day since she learned she was expecting, and she wanted her son to know how long she had thought of him and waited to see him.
“Captain America, sir. The year is 2164,” Tony tried again, speaking slowly and as simply as he could. “It has been one hundred and forty seven years since you were sentenced. The reason for your early release—”
But then he gave himself a shake and gently pushed at Steve’s shoulder. “Love where your head’s at, but econ first. Come on, we might as well get started,” he added, to Steve’s mild disappointment. It wasn’t like Steve didn’t think they’d work; after all, that was the main reason Tony had come down for the three days while Patrick was away. He had just hoped it would be more naked tutoring than the traditional, sexless kind.
Regardless of where in old Terrini one was, every summer solstice began with games for the children, perhaps a strategic choice by their ancestors who recognized the relative peace families would enjoy into the afternoon with tired, well-fed children. Children competed in obstacle courses and in animal husbandry to win raffles to various afternoon entertainment, such as canoeing or pony rides. Not to be outdone, the adults spent much of their days in similar attempts to one-up each other for bragging rights. Everything from caber tossing to three-legged races to eating competitions were widely popular, and it seemed no-one was immune to the lure of victory.
Isn’t that silly, boo?”
Steve, on the other hand, seemed less taken by Tony’s unexpected appearance. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony asked, stepping in closer and reaching to squeeze Steve’s arm gently. “You alright? You’re pale.”
A weight Steve had lived with for too long lifted from his chest as the pieces all fell into place.
“Make note of that door, Sam,” he told his partner then. “He handled like a dream, might as well make him a regular visit.”
Steve frowned to himself and glanced up at the hat.
“Hey, Rogers,” Maria said, politely standing no farther inside Steve’s room than she’d been invited. “You done with the depos?”
“It ended earlier than I thought,” Tony said after a momentary pause. “It’s a bit of a long story, but I happen to be in Brooklyn, if, um. If you’re free?”
“Roll over, babe,” Tony told him, sitting up and widening his stance to give Steve the space to turn onto his belly while Tony straddled his body. His complaints were short-lived and superficial, and soon, Tony had freed him of the red and white jacket. He shuffled down the length of Steve’s body, sliding the elastic waistband of his bottoms down his waist, over the firm, ample curve of his ass, down his thick, strong, long thighs until he could pull them and his shoes off.
Just because things were complicated didn’t mean Steve couldn’t extend an olive branch.
The guards were getting closer to their corner of the office. Tony had no time to lose. It was now or never.
boundaries. And,” he added quickly, “You can pocket all your single gay acquaintances, because I’m already seeing someone.”
There was a knock at the door as Jane announced herself. “Lieutenant Tony Stark, Lieutenant Bruce Banner informed me of what vexes you. May I be of assistance?”
“That’s ten miles of marching and the Army fitness test, on top of weapons assembly, which already—”
“I swear to you that I will not let you down, Captain. It happens that I am educated in your personal history,” Tony added, the confidence in his voice growing with every word. “I understand that this has happened to you previously, and without aid. I will not let that happen again, sir. I intend to be here for you at every step of your acclimatization, and I will not allow for you to be unprepared in this new life. But our society… we do not aspire to individuality or freedom of choice the way they did in the 21st. We are unified and uniform, and those who act differently are not well received. It is how we maintain harmony. My only intention is to warn you, Captain Steve,” he finished more gently. “For if they cannot see that you are handsome, it is their loss, and I will not allow you to take their limited vision to heart.”
“I need to tell you some things,” Tony said in a nervous rush, then cleared his throat and tried again. “Three things. Important things. They’re not all good things, so get ready to be mad, but if you could hear me out before you got
“I said, right, Tony?” Bucky brushed off without so much as blinking. “Steve isn’t the most confident baker, he doesn’t just watch the Bake Off: he studies it. And I’d say it’s paying off. Don’t you think Steve’s big, robust buns would be great for any filling? Tuna or chicken,” he added a beat later almost as an afterthought, hooking his thumb back towards Clint.
Tony stared at the fat little donkey sitting in
Steve knew how powerful prostate stimulation could be, he knew how it always gave him the upper hand. This was his first time on the receiving side, first time to feel utterly exploited for his own benefit and pleasure. Then Tony rotated the vibrator gently inside him, until the curved shaft wasn’t just adjacent to Steve’s prostate, but spooning up against it. Steve’s eyes rolled back in pleasure, his hips stuttering back and forth as he mindlessly tried to get more friction; he was so close to the edge that it hurt, and he sobbed with it, pitiful and desperate.
“Am I on glue here, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Brock?” Steve bit out, one raging word after the other. “We took the same LSAT, we’re taking the same classes—”
Steve raced out of the apartment after Tony, and by the grace of whoever was watching over him, he caught up to Tony before the elevator doors closed.
Steve frowned at the thought, finding himself feeling bad for baby Tony. Tony probably never had to worry about whether adults fighting would lead to him being kicked out of the house, but that didn’t mean the fights weren’t scarring.
“Of course it is,” Bond eventually said, his voice colder and more distant than Tony had ever heard. The line died, with no other words or explanation.
“Right… well, turn over whatever you’ve managed to find, and—”
“I’m in,” Steve said with less of a forced smile. At least games made the time pass faster.
“I finally get to spend time with you like this, I don’t want to see you go,” he admitted with his newfound courage. “Not without me.”
“Only tell me when, James,” she promised. “I will bring the caviar and the champagne.”
“Lieutenant Tony Stark!” Jane cried in her excitement as she rushed forward to greet them—or, by the look of her unblinking gaze, to say hello to the legendary Captain in person. “Radiant greetings, Tony Stark, is this—are you, uh. Captain, uh. Captain America, sir?”
Rhodes walked up to Tony’s sleeping form to wake him with a gentle touch. “Tony?” he said in a lowered voice, “hey, Tony, wake up.”
“Wow. It’s a wonder you’re still single, Stark,” Steve sighed half-heartedly, but he left the door open when he turned and shuffled back to his couch.
He was speaking with the building security when Tony called his name. Steve spun on his heels to see Tony shuffling down the stairs, pale and wide-eyed. He had his phone in his hand.
“It’s Tony,” Steve said quietly, looking at a particularly captivating crack in the pavement he wish he could fall into. “He… uh, he’s been stressed out. I think. He’s not really answering texts, or phone calls. I don’t know wh—”
“Try me.”
Without another word, Steve turned his back on the floundering man and left. Sharon startled to attention and leapt into action to keep up with him.
“You know, you’ve never been more convincing. But why don’t you show me more so I can make a well-informed decision?” he said, handing Steve the key. “And, Steve? Just in case that wasn’t clear enough, your husband-to-be wants you to start this very important, intensely thorough inspection in the bedroom.”
Steve could understand if they both saw the wedding as an impulsive mistake and decided to move on amicably. And when he was perfectly honest with himself, he could admit that he’d be (more than) open to agreeing that it was a lucky accident and giving them a chance. But he couldn’t handle the mixed signals. Tony felt something for him—something Steve badly wanted in his life—but Tony also seemed determined to undo their marriage. As time passed, his attempt to protect Steve from making a mistake sounded increasingly patronizing, and Steve wished he could pin him down and demand the truth.
New Yorseylvanians were told there were dozens of Scraps, but with his own eyes he would say there was easily hundreds living in the sewers. In the short walk back to the main camp, Bucky had confirmed at least one of Pierce’s statements: they chose to live here, free with their children and their lives, far from the unbearable utopia above.
For once, Tony snorted on purpose. “The joke’s on you, I love your beard.”
When the whistle blew, they made it almost five steps before their uncoordinated effort led to tangled limbs and an immediate collapse. Steve had gotten his arms around him and rolled to take the fall; at the time Tony had been mortified, but in hindsight his memory of their first three-legged race was filled with Steve’s heartfelt laughter and the safety of Steve’s strong arms. In subsequent years, Tony grew increasingly receptive to practicing in advance, but since it turned out that Steve intentionally sabotaged them every year, they never really won. Or, well… he
Since Steve’s first appointment was in the afternoon, he made a video of his morning for Tony. He watched the sunrise rise over the Seoul skyline from the comfort of a jacuzzi big enough to stretch his legs in. The breakfast feast was unlike anything Steve had seen. In his childhood, cheese, eggs, and nuts had been his typical breakfast, and he had come to love the addition of cold cuts, bread, and vegetables from Machtberg’s customs. Rice and short ribs were so unexpected that he couldn’t help but tell Tony about it, and he tried everything - the seafood salad, the spicy stewed fish, the cold cucumber soup - and told Tony how it was.
The table assured her and Sam they weren’t going anywhere until they were fed, but as soon as the hosts were out of earshot, the table turned as one to conspire.
“You’re leaving us?” Bucky asked, confused. “I thought you were coming with me and Natasha.”
“Mom’s got brunch with her work friends on Saturdays,” Steve replied thoughtfully, “but I’ll ask about Sunday.”
“I’m… I am busy today, meetings; I cannot,” Tony mumbled, partly to himself. He turned his body towards Steve and immediately sagged into Steve’s side, nosing into Steve’s throat. Almost any other circumstance, and Steve’s heart would have melted with affection. But Tony hadn’t meant to lean into him, he simply wasn’t able to hold himself up. Steve did his best to temper his concern by wrapping his arms around his husband and nuzzling his hair. A part of him wanted to be frustrated and angry, but Tony so unexpectedly frail made it very easy for Steve to remember what really mattered.
There was a brief pause on Sarah’s end, but it was so quiet Steve was half-sure she’d put him on mute.
Sweat broke out across Tony’s forehead. He watched as Steve Rogers scanned the people sitting at the bar over Jane’s shoulder until Tony caught his eye.
Steve made for the bed as soon as he got in, shedding clothes and stretching out under the covers with the proprietary leisure of a tomcat. Tony crawled in after him at a more subdued pace. Steve had taken one look at him before his expression grew concerned and he rolled up on his elbow to lean in close. “Sweetheart,” he whispered softly, reaching for Tony’s hand and bringing it to his lips for a kiss. “What’s bothering you? Talk to me.”
“Tony, there’s been a misunderstanding,” Steve whispered before he lost his courage. He tried to smile to ease the surprise, but it didn’t help. The easy smile faded from Tony’s expression, and he frowned with concern. “It’s nothing bad,” Steve hurried to reassure him. “I, I have a personal shopper, Jan. Jan van Dyne. I don’t always have time to shop, so if important events come up, I ask her for help.”
“Not an option, partner. Where you go, I go. Come on,” he said as he grabbed Steve’s offered hand and helped haul Steve to his feet.
In one smooth, practiced move, Steve twisted his hand and let the canister locked and loaded on his forearm swing down into place. The blunt, pointed head of it fell right into his palm, and with his three fingers stretching Tony's hole, he eased the canister in through his fingers, where it gathered some lube off his glove on the way.
“I’m not asking you to wait for him, Steve. He wouldn’t want you to, either,” Rhodes said before Bucky or Steve said anything else. “It’s not fair, and it’s a shitty situation. I get that, Steve. I just know something of what you’re going through,” Rhodes finally explained, a little more quietly. “And I wish I’d had someone to tell me it wasn’t anything I did wrong. And I was just a best friend who was too black. Howard didn’t want me alienating future investors.”
Still, Brock didn’t say or act on any of the treats Steve laid out for him, and eventually Steve realized that his old tried-and-true strategies wouldn’t cut it anymore.
Bucky adjusted his sunglasses using his reflection in window inside TD Bank, much like he had another dozen times in the past twenty minutes.
“No, these appointments are for you,” Happy told him with a hint of impatience. Finally, when Steve had stood in the same place for too long, he reached over and pushed Steve aside so he could close the passenger door.
“Steve! What are you doing?”
Steve insisted that he was alright, and that Tony had no reason to worry, but Tony wouldn’t have any of it. He towed them back to Steve’s place within the hour, invited himself in and helped Steve get comfortable on the couch before dashing into the kitchen to raid the freezer.
Tony blinked his eyes up to see concern in Steve’s expression. Steve dropped the sweater he’d been rolling up and came to Tony instead, kneeling at the bed in front of him. He held Tony loosely in his arms, giving Tony enough distance even in the strong, protective circle of his body. Tony never felt safer than in Steve’s arms, and inwardly he wished Steve would hold him closer and squeeze him tighter like he would never let go.
“I don’,” Tony mumbled quietly, moaning with relief as he all but melted under Steve’s touch. “Don’ make face...”
(Not that Steve loved him yet, of course. No, Steve
Steve peered up at him with a little frown. “Captain America?”
Rhodey smirked, and pushed the big red button to start the clock. “Ten seconds on manual, Tony—don’t fall!”
“Then that's what we do, Buck. We break the law.”
“So am I,” Tony replied without the earlier glimpse of mischief. “I’m wealthy, I’m educated, and I’m a white man. I make a living writing books about characters who are not always wealthy, white men who graduated from MIT. You’re not the first person I’ve met who had opinions about me,” he said in a gentler tone of voice. “But you are one of the few who’s been willing to admit it. And if you’re willing to communicate, I’m willing to try.”
have a reason, Tony, it’s okay. That’s valid, and I’ll divorce you if that’s what you want. But I already know what I want. I’m asking what you want.”
They caught each other up on the more banal events in their lives as they made their way to their old favorite haunt. Bucky was barely surviving Natasha’s increasingly involved interrogations about what she was getting for her birthday, while Steve was still reeling from the unexpectedly complimentary phone calls he’d received from parents after the field trip. Apparently, a handful of his students were now glued to nature documentaries, and wouldn’t stop talking about everything they’d learned at the zoo.
Steve checked his watch and allowed a few seconds to pass so that Tony could get comfortable in his new cocoon. Then, slowly, Steve lifted the covers enough to lean in after him, nuzzling into Tony’s soft hair and up the back of his ear, where, softly, he spoke to him. “Tony?” he murmured under his breath, and with some added concentration, emanated both heat and the faint scent of a crackling log fire, something he had learned was particularly enticing to the repressed but adventurous type.
“Are you at a good stopping point?” Steve asked, and even though Tony’s shoulder twitched at the question, he nodded in the affirmative. “If it’s not, you can finish.”
“‘m shot,” Tony whined, then whispered, “wanna sleep… sleep with me, Steve?”
“I know, I really don’t want to miss it! It’s such an exciting game; I’ll hurry—” Tony started to assure him, but Steve shook his head. He knew what he was supposed to do.
“I oversee lectures at the vocational institute on Nk-nmwyn. We have a series on their kind coming up, two females but no males. All costs covered, of course, with a good stipend,” it assured Steve before Steve could dismiss the offer. “And a handsome fee for each female the male can breed.”
“I—well, I guess tonight's the same as tomorrow morning,” Steve said to himself. For a second, Tony thought he’d been day dreaming again and missed a step, but then Steve leaned back and reached for the ball chain that carried his dog tags around his neck. He held the dog tags in the palm of his hand, weighing them and his decision one last time before gently threading the chain over Tony’s head.
Steve grinned and shook his head. “We are making struffoli,” he corrected with a playful note in his voice, “it’s not Christmas if only one of us works.”
A short silence hung between them until Tony sighed his surrender. He didn’t say a word, but Steve thanked him all the same, kissing the crown of his head and easing them back under the covers. He pulled Tony against his side again, and despite his earlier reluctance, Tony easily followed his lead now, pressing so close that he all but draped his full body over Steve.
“She’s been drinking, so she isn’t pregnant,” Carol said, which Tony could back her up on - he’d been watching; pregnancy had been his guess, too.
“Funny you should say that,” Tony observed with a quiet, thoughtful hum. “Did you know that Rhodey always knows when we’ve spent time together? It’s almost as if there are visible signs on my body that—”
“Give him a chance to explain, Buck. You don’t have to love him,” Steve gently pointed out, “you just have to be nice.”
“Sometimes, I get …a little rough. I’ve even been rough with you,” Steve said slowly, choosing his words with care. “I don’t mean to. I never mean to. But, something happens, a thought or a word, and it’s like a switch inside me. I have scared away partners in the past. Scared myself, if I’m honest. I never even thought I’d be able to tell anyone that I fantasize about hurting someone during sex—”
As he listened, Tony rolled to drape himself over Steve, loosely embracing him and resting his chin on Steve’s chest comfortably. He hummed in understanding and asked, “Have you had sex since you moved to Fiorera?”
The happy Taco Bell patrons lingered under the colonnades, flashing smiles and jewelry at their pleasure. Steve was starting to wonder what special attraction this 22nd century society had to light and shiny things when a moving shape in the shadows caught his eye.
It happens
Steve frowned a little at the monitor. “Didn’t you wear that last week?”
“And if Uncle Tony isn’t with us, Uncle Rhodey won’t come,” she concluded without so much as a peep about their (her) plans. “We love you! Be safe!”
; this is
They were going to go to jail. They were going to go to jail and it would all be Tony’s fault. Kind, gentle, gorgeous Steve who’d have every man with a pulse after him and his gorgeous lips, it would all be Tony’s fault for dragging him into this. Maybe if he gave himself up—maybe if he pretend he’d done this alone and left Steve to hide behind the cover of the ancient sculpture he’d be the only one convicted of the crime and Steve could write the story. Maybe he’d even share the byline with Tony so they’d have one last story together as partners.
“—into trouble, and how dare you bring that look
What rational thought Tony could muster assured him he would do the same had the tables been turned. But if Tony was honest, his facade of well adjusted poise was crumbling and he had looked forward to a night of taking comfort in Steve’s effortless strength. There was a surety to Steve that grounded Tony with purpose, and he needed it now in the aftermath of his abduction more than ever.
“Tony! Over here.”
Steeling himself, Tony dared to glance down at his chest. The angry, bleeding lines, the jagged edges of his skin curling back from the wound, it was all enough to make Tony sick.
“Incontrovertible. Look it up in the dictionary. Now, listen to me carefully, Jasper,” Steve told him with a cold, quiet professionalism that had even Sharon closing her eyes with a shudder. “I’m firing you because you are incompetent, entitled, and lazy. If you spent half as much energy on your work as you do cheating on your wife, you could have made a decent assistant to someone in the basement. You have thirty minutes to pack up your office. One more word out of you, and Sharon will have armed security escort you off the premises.”
Steve stared at Tony, wide-eyed. He wanted to laugh. He wanted to cry. He wanted to know why he hadn’t insisted on combining his group with Tony’s so he could know what the hell dueling penises actually meant.
“I really hated you, for a while,” Steve told him from the kitchenette. His back was still turned while he puttered around, and Tony stood in the small entryway of the room, watching him from a distance without adding a word to the conversation yet. Eventually, Steve came back with two cups of coffee. “You made my life a living hell. Hate mail, phone calls—people were calling my mother, Tony, do you understand how scary that is?”
Steve listened to Tony’s argument without interrupting him. He needed to do well this weekend, but he couldn’t do it at the expense of his grades. More importantly, there was something about having Tony next to him that made him feel like he could take on the world and come out on top. Having him close through the challenge would be a dream come true.
If Steve wanted to get away, this was his chance.
Hours passed, and Steve never called. All day, Tony watched his phone like a hawk. He finished his workshop, he attended his meetings, he plodded through the emails that needed answering, but all the while, his phone never left his sight, and it never rang.
“TV?” he asked and held up the remote, apropos of nothing. Tony didn’t say anything, but the way he kicked back on the sofa, stretched his legs comfortably, and turned so he could watch TV with his head comfortably rested on a cushion was affirmative enough.
“...how old is the guy supposed to be?”
A young receptionist was currently cuddling a lapful of Seamus and, by the looks of it, he was venting his day’s frustrations on the little dog. Seamus couldn’t have been happier. Steve’s whole expression warmed with a smile when he noticed Tony approaching through the scattered crowd.
“Now you’re thinking like a lawyer.”
“I get it if you don’t want me to meet him yet,” Jane prefaced this time, “but I’m curious, Tony! Who is it? Point him out!”
Even on his shittiest day, Steve couldn’t look at that ring and imagine himself admitting to Tony that he
Steve needed a moment of silence to regret the serum’s two-fold curse of enhanced visual problem-solving and an eidetic memory.
“Coat room, where yours should be,” Steve said, and with one last, quick peck on Tony’s lips, Steve leaned back to put some distance between them and gently gestured for Tony to give it to him. “I’ll put it away, you should get a drink.”
“You look awful,” Steve mumbled in a deep, gravelly voice, and without looking up or taking his sunglasses off, Tony huffed in tired amusement.
And Steve didn’t hesitate to shake every one of their dry, filthy, unmanicured hands, introducing himself as only ‘Steve’ and repeating each Scrap’s name to enhance his learning.
As if he had heard the sudden roar of insecurities in Tony’s spiraling thoughts, Steve chose that precise moment to turn and notice Tony standing awkwardly in the entryway of the office, staring at him.
By the time Pepper let herself into their bedroom, Steve had the covers pulled up well over Tony’s ears and his face turned so Pepper couldn’t see more than some of Tony’s unruly hair over the covers. Even so, Steve took the precaution of gently cupping one hand over Tony’s face while finger combing his hair with the other, shielding him almost entirely from view.
“Tony, shut up,” Steve mumbled, making an effort not to slur his words to sound more serious in his demand. “Please, don’t make me wait longer, want to feel you now. I know what I want. Fuck me.”
A slight tension around Steve’s mouth eased not to have to say the words out loud, and he cleared his throat to steady his voice and soldier on. “Knowing what I did, you’d still marry me?”
There was a moment of stunned silence, but Tony was quick to applaud and cheer for the winner, and the audience happily followed his lead.
At least now he knew she worked with Professor Hawley; he’d find her another time.
Tony smirked at him and chewed on his bacon with a smug look. “Not the first time I’ve been called that, and it sure won’t be the last,” he said. “But I am a disaster who’s got a fence to finish up. Should be done by lunch?”
Brock blushed a deep shade of red at the memory and looked like he was about to choke in his effort to bite his tongue. Sharon cut a betrayed look at her fiancé.
Steve groaned and rolled his eyes. “No, wait, Tony, I didn’t mean—take your time, I’m sorry. That was sarcasm.”
to pick the only person in a sea of people whom she knew, and you want to know if this is typical?”
“No? Then get out of my sight: pack up your office, and stop wasting my time. I have work to do.”
“Thank you for telling me, Steve. For your trust in me,” he whispered, brushing his lips over Steve’s in a soft, adoring kiss. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you. I’m grateful you were strong enough. Grateful you survived, to have you in my life.”
“I, I uh,” Tony floundered in a way Steve had never imagined possible. “You weren’t, um. You weren’t supposed to hear that yet.”
Then, as if on a whim of curiosity, he wondered, “Can you still carry me?”
“I practically lived in your bed for the past five months,” Steve continued, and it was enough of a non-sequitur that Tony gave him a curious look. “The more I think about it, the more I want you to have it. The mattress. I’ll order myself another one,” he promised when Tony’s jaw dropped. But Tony didn’t look mollified; he was gearing up for an argument. Steve quickly pushed the John Lewis bag into his hands before he lost ground. “The money for the mattress and for my share of living expenses is there.”
“Happily?”
“My love, I believe we must fire all of our attending staff,” Tony began with a begrudging smirk. “There is an alarming rash of insubordination spreading among them. Coulson left clear instructions forbidding me from calling you this morning. Forbade
He could hear Tony smiling, but he didn’t care. All he wanted in that moment was to get his hands on Tony, and to hold him close. Tony readily obliged.
“Honey, what do you want me to say? I tried to scare you off the coffee, you drank it anyway. You could have listened like a good kid so mommy and daddy didn’t have a kid hopped up on caffeine, but you snuck some coffee anyway, so mommy and daddy let you go run outside with the dogs until you were tired. Either way, your height wasn’t our concern,” she concluded. “Of all medical myths, mommy and daddy were much more interested in the g-spot.”
“Of course,” Tony grinned, thanking the waiter again as he sat up to get himself situated. He raised his glass, and said, “To a life worth living.”
“You have my number, Tony,” Steve reminded him in a soft whisper. “Don’t hesitate to use it.”
Tony took a moment to wash his face and brush his teeth before settling in on Steve’s enviable couch with his phone. He had emails to address, news to read, and he had almost finished drafting his out of office autoresponder when Steve shuffled out of the bedroom in nothing but his boxer briefs and a navy blue silk robe.
“Those pecs make up for a lot, Rogers, but you are going nowhere fast…”
The answer was obvious, and Tony gravitated to the wheeled in tray of food like a moth to a flame. After the day they had had, neither of them was particularly talkative. They grabbed a plate each, found some comfortable spot on a couch or in an armchair, and tucked into their food with a bottomless appetite. The lamb rump was tender and beautifully seasoned, and even Steve, who probably should have gone light on those potatoes, threw caution to the wind and scraped up every delicious spoonful.
“Dinner,” Tony said casually enough. “Burgers. Good ones.”
“I don’t care,” Fury told her, and from Sharon’s left, Steve cleared his throat in a silent plea for immediate silence. “Make it legal, Rogers, and get Hill the paperwork so we can forget this ever happened.”
Steve blinked at him, suddenly alarmed, as if he’d possibly missed Tony’s last request. “What? What does that mean?”
“My parents are filthy rich,” Tony corrected quietly, and he resumed rubbing Steve’s back, as if he recognized that the news of his parents’ wealth was a shock Steve would need help recovering from, more so than the shock of their welcome only minutes earlier. A dog weaseled its way closer, rubbing its head against Steve’s limp hand in an explicit request for attention. Steve couldn’t even muster the energy to pull his hand away.
So when the hoodie and t-shirt wearing students paused their tired shuffle across campus to openly eye him in his form-fitting, short-sleeved button-up and jeans literally made for his body, Steve only smiled back. If they only saw blond hair and big pecs when they looked at him, that was fine. Soon they would meet as individuals, and Steve only looked forward to showing them that he was more than their unintended preconceptions.
“Tony, please don’t tease me,” Steve begged him breathlessly. It would have been a perfect opportunity for teasing or making Steve work for it, but Tony only laughed and rolled to his feet.
“Sorry, not sorry,” Tony said with a satisfied smile, but he melted back against Steve’s chest happily, pleasantly boneless in the embrace of Steve’s body and their warm bath.
“So, so… so fucking…
No necklace, no ring.
“Fine,” he eventually conceded. “But we do it my way and on my terms. Is that clear?”
Steve made his way there through the pouring rain only to realize he had never seen Caffe Italia during a lunch rush before. The space was overrun, every table (even the ones squeezed into awkward corners) occupied. Even after all the time it took for Steve to wait in line for his coffee and his biscuits, there was still a body in every seat around the little cafe. Apparently, nobody felt the need to face the awful downpour so that Steve could have a seat and take a moment for himself to recover.
“They were short conversations, sure, but you left everybody smiling. Every day you were on set was brighter because of you.”
There were a lot of things that Steve couldn’t remember from Thursday night. He couldn’t remember the drive from Boston to Quincy; Google told him it was a twenty to thirty minute drive, but Steve would have sworn on his ma’s life that it was no more than five minutes. They’d gotten into Tony’s car and started talking about anything and everything - from their most memorable travel mishaps to their favorite literary villains. When Tony told him they were going to visit a chapel built in a former lighthouse, Steve couldn’t help but tell Tony that he’d never been to a lighthouse, and how one of his bucket-list holidays was to one year spend September driving up the Eastern seaboard from Georgia to Prince Edward Island, where he’d heard the fall foliage was something out of a storybook.
“You said you liked honesty,” Steve reminded him, a touch bashful. He knew it was unusual, but Tony wanted honesty, and wasn’t that the whole point he was trying to make? “Sex is kind of easy, one-night stands, whatever. Spending time with someone, listening to them, remembering what they say… that takes effort. And for someone like me? My life is my job, I’m away for business a lot. The effort feels pointless. I can’t plan a future, I can’t make any promises, and that’s never been a problem. Until you. The more I learn about you, Tony - how clever you are, how you treat people in need who have no business asking you for help - the more I want to know.”
“Steve, this is the gym floor,” Tony told him slowly, then gently guided them both back into the elevator. He didn’t push any buttons, and let the elevator continue on its predetermined route. “Did you just get here, or were you in the city?”
“What! The Rock bench pressed you?” Tony said with a snap of attention, clearly shocked and very intrigued. After a beat, he whispered, “How many reps?”
“Wait. I’m what?”
Steve laughed and stole a kiss from Tony’s smiling lips while he had the chance. “There’s someone else who is delightful and wants to meet you,” he said then, still smiling at Tony because he just couldn’t stop. “I want to introduce you to my mom, Tony. It would mean a lot to me, and to her.”
“Wait—so, what, an hour ago it's pointless, and now all of a sudden it’s foreplay?” Tony teased, sipping his water to clear his throat. “Alright, darling. I'll bite. What’s in it for me?”
“I think it’s time to discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?”
Steve blinked down at him, so conflicted Tony almost felt bad about his demands. “But, Tony,” Steve whispered, concentrating so hard Tony could practically feel him willing his erection away for a sobering conversation. “We need to talk. I’m worried about you.”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat in his shock. It was one thing to have a partner who wanted to know your fantasies, or thought they were a turn on… but someone who would consider bringing it to life?
Her quiet sense of rebellion made Steve smile, and in that realization, he found himself happy to spend the afternoon with Jane. “Airplanes don’t go that far. You’d need a rocket or a space shuttle to see the stars. It is possible, just not with airplanes.”
“If you say so,” Steve conceded, albeit skeptically.
“What if he meant I ‘go hard’ as in it’s overkill? That I’m coming off as desperate?”
The announcement that enough food and supplies was available for the survivors did nothing to reduce the line of people waiting to offer their help. One young mother arrived with a large vegetarian stew full of various beans, legumes, potatoes, and figs for survivors who could not eat meat, wheat, or dairy. A teenager stood patiently in line for nearly an hour to donate his favorite childhood books; in a trembling but determined voice he told Steve that while he loved them, he didn’t need them the way some kids at the camp might. They were stories of young folk heroes, champions of kith and kin that children could identify with in times of hardship.
“Congratulations on Foster,” Fury replied without a smile or even a hint of satisfaction.
“Why, I don’t know if I should get lost in your sweet blue eyes, or wrap myself in your big arms,” she purred, holding her hand out to him with the intention of having it kissed in greeting.
Then, all at once, Steve seemed to remember where he was, and who was with them.
“I,” Steve bumbled for a moment, then quickly cleared his throat. “Does, uh. Is that a good thing?”
“It could have been worse,” Steve said with a lopsided smile, and it was the truth. After all, Howard hadn’t shot him. “Tossing hay bales off a moving truck might be my new favorite work-out.”
“Right, sure. Pepper - you remember Pepper? You’d like her, Steve, she’s, she’s a force of nature. Pepper noticed early on that… maybe the women and the, the partying didn’t work for me. She’s perceptive like that. She didn’t bring it up, until my mother stopped by around Christmas last year for lunch. She, she has this way of talking that just, I don’t know, works? So, we talked, I told her what was going on, and then… then she asked the simplest question,” Tony said with a thoughtful, marveling smile on his lips. “She asked me why I don’t start my own company and hire anyone Howard fires. And I… Steve, I don’t—it had never occured to me, you don’t—”
“You hardly got to see the city,” Steve noted on their last evening in the city. They had enjoyed a long dinner and decided to take a stroll around the city. It was drizzling and the streets were fairly empty, but neither of them were in a hurry to get back to the hotel. They walked arm in arm, squeezed together under a big umbrella.
A quick search on his phone provided more good and bad news than he’d imagined, but he picked up his muffins, plugged in the address, and started on his way. Five quick minutes later, Steve stood in Harvard Square in front of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. Even though the volunteers couldn’t give the food to those staying with them overnight, they themselves were allowed to have the muffins, and Steve’s night was made infinitely better by seeing the surprise light up in their smiles.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony mumbled quietly, dropping the issue before he lost his last ally. “I’ll go wait for him outside. He’s punctual, we shouldn’t be long.”
liked it,” Steve promised him, sounding achingly sincere for someone who Tony knew was so bored and done with the day. “For a movie on this scale, I think we really needed another hero. Not someone secondary or someone who’d bend over every time he heard Captain America said so. Then for this hero to be someone like Iron Man, I think we’re—we owe a lot to the writing team. He’s not the creation of a German scientist, Iron Man is what and who he is by his own doing, he’s… he’s a hero we can all aspire to be more like. You don’t have to be a billionaire genius to be a hero, but sometimes you can just look around and think, what can I do to make this world a better place?”
She wasn’t smiling back at him. She
“And so polite! I am fundamentally impressed, Captain.”
“Fine, whatever, I’ll do it if you’ll put some big-boy pants on—let’s go have some drinks, relax, have a good time…”
Six days later, they were all in the deep end. By the time they got through all of the fan letters, they had twenty-nine reasonable leads. Steve had assigned them a handful to six detectives while he and Bucky pursued five suspects themselves. It was enough to drive a man crazy. Everything was moving too slowly, too many leads were ending in dead-ends, and by the time all three of Antonovich’s alibis checked out, Steve was at the end of his rope.
“Darling, I’d love to show you, but I’m hardly in my prime,” Tony conceded, and his grin faded. “I’m out of practice—”
“I called Sam. He’s on his way, he’s better at this,” Tony said in the end, quiet and defeated. Steve hated the sound of it and wanted so badly to assure Tony that it wasn’t his fault, but he felt strangely disconnected from his body that by the time he moved Tony was gone.
After updating Bucky on the four letters Tony had identified and on the Ivan Antonovich, Steve called it a day. It was well past nine when he left the building, over thirteen hours since he’d gotten in that morning. He knew he needed sleep; he was tired, he could feel it in the tension in his back, the headache behind his eyes. He walked the whole way home in the hopes of feeling sleepier by the time he got home, but it was no use. The last thing he wanted to do was get into bed.
How nice of Benedita, taking Tony’s boyfriend somewhere secluded, beautiful, and tremendously romantic. Kind, generous Benedita, who was two years younger than Tony and had flawless skin and a smile to light up a room and spoke a gazillion languages (probably) and who, at this point, had enjoyed as much of Steve’s free time since they moved to Portugal as Tony.
“They’re looking for a threesome,” he explained as soon as he came back around to Thor and Bruce. “She and her partner are trying to get pregnant, and they want a, and I quote, ‘willing donor.’”
While Tony felt the first letter was most troubling, Steve found the fourth letter most disconcerting. In it, a man who had recognized his philandering wife’s behavior in one of Tony’s books blamed Tony for his ruined marriage, his lost fortune, and his limited custodial rights. He was exactly what they were looking for: an avid reader of Stark Adventure novels with a clear motive. A man with nothing to lose.
“That’s above my paygrade, Mr. Rogers,” Happy replied with a shrug. “Oh, and the Boss asked me to take the flowers back to your place.”
“Steve! There you are,” Tony said past the crowd of people surrounding his partner.
“No!” Tony grunted emphatically, and before Steve could do much to stop him, Tony tried to push himself upright in bed. His arms, otherwise so strong and capable, wobbled under his weight. He struggled to open his eyes, and when he did, he couldn’t focus.
“Stark, let me go first,” Steve said quietly. “I see better in the dark.”
The hut with gluhwein had been their first stop, though Tony was the only one who went with wine - Steve immediately changed his mind to rum and hot chocolate, and both Bucky and Natasha chose something non-alcoholic while on duty. They made a point of visiting every artist hut and buying something small from each of them. Tony picked up a snow globe for Lila and a ceramic mug Natasha was eyeing. Steve, who had been curious but uncommitted to most of the trinkets sold at the huts, was the first to notice a shimmering ceramic Christmas tree ornament of them riding a toboggan. Their little cartoon-like selves looked so happy on this imaginary toboggan adventure that Steve picked it up and turned to show Tony immediately. They barely noticed Bucky paying the artist while they laughed over the adorable ornament. The artist bashfully told them that this was one of the few ornaments of the monarchs he had left - everything was selling like hotcakes, particularly an ornament depicting their wedding earlier that year.
Tony’s smile only drew wider as he listened to Steve share what he’d observed in California over the past week. “Are any of them ready for people to move into?”
Bruce Wayne.”
Tony couldn’t have contained his smile if he’d wanted to. He draped an arm around Steve in return, hugged him close, and they held each other as they drifted off into a safe, peaceful sleep.
“How come you never take that off?” he wondered out loud.
Tony recognized Steve’s voice before he recognized the hooded man in his office.
Tony stared at him in silence while he tried to reconcile Bruce’s words with what he knew about his friend. “
Steve looked genuinely confused this time, and he sat up to grab his wristwatch off the bedside table. “They’re up at 5am?” he wondered, dubious.
Two months. Was it too soon? Did love have to follow a timeline? What was the difference between love confessed after 6 weeks and the love confessed after months—
Their parents were good people and thankfully got along, but they rarely agreed and were even less helpful. You didn’t ask them for input unless you already knew what you needed and only wanted them to feel included.
“Tony, hi!” he said with exuberant false cheer, as if Tony’s call was the biggest surprise of his lifetime. “What a, a great surprise. I thought you were busy tonight?”
One call to Coulson was all it took for the arrangements to be made, and for Steve to make peace with this newfound limitation of what it meant to do his best. As a farmer, as a soldier, and as a prince, his life had only ever been about doing more: to be more vigilant shepherd, to stay awake longer so his men could sleep in the field, to study for hours on one subject after another. But as he had heard Rhodes tell Tony weeks ago, this was not only his life anymore, he shared it with another person. A person whom he loved deeply and wanted to honor. It had all gotten away from him so quickly, and on that final flight back to his husband, Steve swore to himself that he'd never allow his duty to so easily lead him from the vows he made to Tony again.
,” he said in an undertone, “now, let me.”
“Steve, we’re going somewhere you won’t tell me about, for reasons you won’t explain, after weeks of excuses Lois Lane wouldn’t even believe—”
In an effort to minimize collateral damage, Steve instructed Bruce and Tony to help direct all patrons a safe distance away from the building. Armed only with a stun baton and a whistle, Steve went in after Rumlow alone. After all, the serum made him stronger and faster - even with a scattered collection of weapons, Rumlow would be an easy match without Hydra at his back.
“Fair enough,” he said, “my number is 918-432-1857. If you remember it, call me and we’ll find a time for that drink. Cause right now, I’m leaving. Bye-bye, darling,” he added, even blowing him a kiss as he passed to steer Bruce towards the curb and the nearest waiting cab.
His hand print got him into his own apartment just as Tony had promised. The lights came on as he asked, but instead of the light in Tony’s place that mimicked the 21st century light bulbs Steve was used to, Steve’s apartment was filled with something approaching natural sunlight. His furniture was sturdy and functional, and while they looked comfortable, none of it looked particularly personal.
“I’m going to take them home and find a place for them upstairs where I’ll always see them until you come home. I miss you, Tony. Thank you for thinking of me.”
“He’s not cheating! I know where he fucking is!” Steve snapped. Sam and Bucky stared back at him, and it took a second too long to realize he’d shouted at his friends. He didn’t raise his voice, not with friends.
“That’s it? You’ve made a career as a copy editor?”
Steve frowned down at the small bundle of Tom Ford nail polish bottles. “So why did you buy sixteen of them?”
“Captain Steven Rogers,” said a woman who was dressed in a silk gown matching the Taco Bell color scheme. Steve tried to look her in the eyes instead of staring at the conical hat on her head. “We decided amongst ourselves that you simply must tell us of the crude ways of the 21st century.”
They looked at him like he was a stranger off the streets who’d invited himself to a space intended for those special few who knew better.
And as she tucked a lock of her hair behind her ear, Steve saw it. The six carat rock - Brock’s grandmother’s ring. The ring that belonged to Steve.
“And here is your prize, Captain!” Karl said as an assistant walked on stage to hand Steve the smallest, fluffiest dog Tony had ever seen. Some of the crew melted at the sight of the adorable puppy, but it was Steve who cradled the small thing in the palm of one hand and held on to her with the other. She was squirming and wriggling with all her little might as she tried and failed to reach his face and lick his mouth; Tony could only sympathize. Steve contained her efforts all too easily, cooing and praising her in turns.
“She does,” he said, but he glanced down at his own tie to try hiding his blush. Tony watched him curiously, because if Clint was the one worried at his marriage ceremony, something wasn’t right.
New Yorseylvania’s Taco Bell was a sight to behold. From the tall columns stretching overhead to shoulder broad archways, to the decorative mosaic floor, all aspects of the restaurant were built with flawless black and white marble. Rich, plum-colored velvet curtains were gathered at the sides of every window and archway, adding an ironic elegance to the Taco Bell palette. A mariachi band played in the entry hall of the restaurant, creating a tasteful atmosphere for the restaurant patrons to enjoy as they stood in line to order their meal at the counter.
“Sure made me feel like shit,” Bruce muttered, rolling up on his elbow just long enough to take another long sip of his tea. Tony reached over and scrubbed a hand through Bruce’s curls, ruffling them up affectionately until Bruce was too amused not to grin back. When he was happily relaxed on the floor again, he hummed in question and asked, “So what’s going on then? Is Steven’s being stubborn? He’s a
Who wants to know?
“Would you two knock me up! We have no time to waste,” Tony all but shouted at them both. Beside him, Steve groaned.
Steve blinked and looked around in confusion. “What the hell was that?”
“You’ll want an extra cord.”
“I couldn’t,” Tony struggled to say, and he glanced around them surreptitiously, clearly trying to gauge how many might be eavesdropping on their private conversation. “Steve, I couldn’t see a way out. I was selfish, I wanted every second with you to, to be perfect. Just us. I thought—”
“You really think Odinson can help?”
There was a soft beep from the front door before the door swung open.
Tony was quick to agree, and, together, they went back to the truck to grab Steve’s luggage before making their way to Tony’s room. It took a moment for Steve to realize nothing they were passing on their way there looked familiar.
Tony looked at him like he didn’t know whether to laugh or shout himself hoarse. Steve had to hand it to him; those were both good options, given the circumstances.
A soft, mustard colored blended yarn caught his eye. He lifted it in his hands and tested the spun thread between his fingers. There was no information attached to the hefty ball, but instinct told Steve it was a classic tweed, and most likely a blend of cashmere and silk with traditional merino wool.
If only it could be someday soon.
“Don’t you think I know that?” Tony cried, then shut his mouth and ran a hand through his hair. When he seemed to have pulled himself together, he continued. “I know I was an asshole. I was hurtful and manipulative. A liar.”
“Sir, I’m not interested in your son because of your money,” Steve said as calmly as he could. “Nothing he said of you or his childhood lifestyle suggested you were wealthy.”
Smiling and crying in his shock of gleeful excitement, Tony pulled back to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck, keeping him captive for kiss after breathless kiss until Steve had no doubt of his answer.
He showed Tony the reservation confirmation for the tree house—
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, step away from the benevolent Governor Alexander G. Pierce this minute,” Fury said again. Steve had nothing left to say, and with a final pitying look, he turned on his heel and walked away before he gave in and strangled the man with his bare hands.
“Romantic, intimate, embarrassing—you name it, Tony, and it’s about you,” Steve confessed in a rush. Tony’s affirmation left Steve feverish to tell him more, to tell him everything he’d been dying to say for so long. “I can’t stop thinking about you. Anything that happens, I want to tell you about it. Every night before bed, I want to hear how your day was; every morning I want to know if you’re alright. I can’t stop thinking about kissing you,” he added softly, almost growling around his words. “I can’t stop thinking how you’d feel in my arms.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve whispered, carefully lifting Tony off his lap before sliding out from under him.
“Bold of you to think you aren’t already asses,” Natasha drawled, but then with a little smirk, she said, “but Talia won’t harm you. Besides, I can do one better.”
“We’ll see you kids in the morning,” Howard said before any more could come of that conversation. “Tony, we sure could use your help mending the fences to the east, near the lake. Hogs’ve been tearing everything up this season.”
“Pretty sure I just pissed off Bond,” Tony said quietly. “I just… I don’t know how.”
“You think I’ll miss seeing you in one of the most iconic roles of all time? I have three alerts set on my phone about it, I—” Steve abruptly interrupted himself and paused the video. “Did—did she just say—”
The bubbly, cheerful woman with her mop of white and grey curls studied the men for a brief time before smiling at Rob Brydon.
“Danielle?” Sharon guessed; when Steve hummed in confirmation around his first drink, she quickly added, “I called her like you said, and told her that if she doesn’t turn her manuscript in on time, you won’t give her a release date.”
By the time Steve caught up to Rumlow, the villain had circled around the compound and taken an older man hostage.
Steve didn’t break his stride as he walked up to them with a smile that was all teeth. “Thanks for inviting me, girls,” he said cheerfully over their gasps and nervous giggling. “This party is super fun!”
scary pink thing.”
“I can’t believe it’s over,” Tony said first as they made their way out of the Burbank recording studio. They had just finished the last of the voice recordings, lines of dialogue that had been changed in the editing room or needed to be cleared up.
“It’s
Steve folded himself into the passenger seat in the squad car left for them. Tony watched as Steve tried to get comfortable, but the car simply wasn’t made for someone his size. He could either sit so his hip dug into the center console, or so his shoulder pressed into the passenger side window, and neither felt particularly comfortable. He never once complained, but Tony wasn’t blind to his discomfort.
They pulled into traffic smoothly, gliding between cars as easy as breathing. Even when Tony eventually leaned into Steve’s broad back, he refrained from any full-body clinging to Steve’s body.
Worse than that, Superman wasn’t available anymore. The pictures and fandom were all Tony had left, because nobody had seen Superman in fifteen years. Not officially, anyway. Witnesses at various natural disasters sometimes claimed to have seen the blue tights and the red cape seconds before the worst of the storm was diverted, or that time a bridge near Vancouver had crumbled and more than forty cars should have crashed into the ravine below. But chunks of the bridge magically remained airborn long enough for the cars to skid back to solid ground, and some people claimed to have glimpsed the red cape take off.
Steve’s smile only grew wider and brighter. He kept eating the great, date-night food on his plate and watched Tony half-heartedly put things away and clean up around them.
“Mom, you’re messing up his hair,” Clint complained on Steve’s behalf, as if it had happened so often in his life that Steve was more worried about his hairstyle than the affection shared.
Tony followed Steve’s intent stare and found the mask. The insanely realistic mask without eyes and lips that looked more like it had been peeled off someone’s face than created in a blazing all-nighter fueled by Red Bulls and coffee.
“Thanks, but I have enough friends helping me, Tony,” Steve replied, doing his best to stick to the facts. “If next week is bad, I can call you? Cliff wants to take me to lunch my first day, but I’ll be home by six. I know that’s late for you, but I can call Tuesday at lunch—”
Steve grinned at the question, but shook his head. “No, no of course not,” he replied, smiling at the thought. “Some might have guessed it, or now they’ll start figuring it out, but it’s not something I advertise. Sometimes I see questions and answer them - it’s a great way to pass the time on set, I can tell you that much. And when big news like this breaks out, it’s the best. Everyone descends on the blog and it’s a lot of fun. But they don’t need to know who I am, and I don’t need them to, either. It’s my chance to be excited and a fan without having attention on me, you know?”
Tony sat ramrod straight. Was his life a joke? That had to be it: his life was a cosmic joke. Here he had a prime opportunity to fawn over the strong adonis whose confident, commanding voice left Tony weak in the knees, and instead he had to find a casual, non-psycho way to laugh off the fact that he’d left his house that morning with a dog and a butt plug.
“Yeah, here and now with me,” Steve said with a smile. “You’re even wearing a suit, you look great. Just give the key to the valet.”
“Steve!” Tony wheezed down the line.
“Teeth,” Steve murmured, already half asleep on his feet. Tony chuckled quietly, but he obliged Steve with a gentle pat on his back.
“Shower’s the first door on the right the way we came, use anything you want in there. Clint has his own,” Tony was saying while Steve looked around the room. “I’m gonna grab something from the kitchen, you want anything?”
,” Tony snapped, and again Steve was struck by how terribly transparent his friend could be about hiding his concern behind anger.
Tony blinked at him, still busy shaking out the faint ache from his fingers. “I studied the creative brutality of Jackie Chan on laserdisc for many years, Steve Rogers.”
“No, not again,” he heard himself groaned hoarsely, and he dug his fingers into the firm, meaty muscle of Steve’s shoulders. Steve pulled off his cock then and eased the rhythm of his fingers until he was only slowly, gently, pumping his fingers in and out of Tony’s body, giving him a sliver of satisfaction.
“Tell me about your day? This is delicious, by the way,” Tony mumbled between bites of food. He probably should learn how to cook soon; Steve’s food wasn’t Michelin quality food, but it was a delicious part of coming home. Tony had only felt peckish when Steve asked him if he was hungry, but after tasting his first bite of hot, gooey cheese, grilled onions, and the flavorful barbecue chicken, Tony realized he was starving. He couldn’t eat fast enough.
It took Steve a moment to recall Tony’s earlier messages. “He says he wants to talk,” Steve said with a shrug, and he pulled out his phone to check. A new text from Tony had popped up on his lock screen since that morning.
From the gurney, Tony whined and turned towards Steve’s voice, suddenly worried about what Steve would choose. Steve let go of the gurney and took Tony’s hand instead, bringing Tony’s hand to his lips for a soft kiss.
“We’ll see you back here at three, Mr. Rogers,” he heard Tony call his way, before Steve could make his mind up about combining groups or not. “My phone is on if anything changes.”
“Mr. Stark, you can’t think that way,” Steve said, but he ended his statement with a tired sigh that caught Tony’s attention. “I understand where you’re coming from, Mr. Stark. Trust me, there’s… sometimes, what we do doesn’t feel like enough. Burglars whose escalating crimes are seen as unrelated and dismissed with probation; violent exes who only go away for a few months on attempted murder charges because we caught them before they had a chance to go through with it. Times like that, I wish I could operate without a badge. Bend the rules. But we don’t play the parts we wish we could,” he finished softly. “Our choice is only to make the best of what we are.”
Steve’s lips twisted in a rueful smile. He covered Tony’s hand with his own and gave him a fond squeeze in return. “I don’t remember the last time I made you this mad—and I know it’s me,” he promised in undertone, bringing Tony’s hand up for a quick kiss before having to let go to change gear. “I didn’t want to make it worse.”
tied these crimes back to my books,” Tony whispered with a huff of wry amusement. “You said they were handled by three different precincts, too, right?”
Steve was stretched out on the floor on his back, one arm tucked under his pillow, and the other draped casually over his middle. Without competition for couch space, Tony had taken up the whole thing by draping himself across the three seats, his cheek cushioned on the edge of the seat only inches over Steve’s face.
“Yelena Belova,” Tony confirmed, running the trace with both English and Russian spelling to be safe.
,” Tony firmly pointed out. “Not that it’s any of your business, but I get plenty of dates on my own.”
“Don’t brush it off, Tony. I think there is a need, your questions are important. I’ve been thinking about it, too, actually,” Steve admitted, and in his curiosity, Tony perked up enough to meet Steve’s steady gaze.
“Fine,” Tony eventually spat out. “Sure. Maybe I keep people at a distance until I get to know them.”
“So he distracts the public with some charitable acts and you decide he’s a good person? We like to think we know people, but all of us wear masks. You never know who anybody is, and you know why?” he said between his second and third shot. “Because the second someone sees you for who you really are, they will use it against you.”
For all that he loved him, Steve couldn’t bear to look at him another minute. He got up and threw the cloth napkin in Brock’s face, then stormed out of the restaurant and their relationship.
Steve continued drawing absent patterns over Tony’s arm without saying a word. He had learned to give Tony the space to lose himself in thought, as he often did when thinking of his mother.
And when he started commentating, it didn’t end.
If Tony didn’t know him any better, he’d say that Steve looked taken aback. “Really?” he cleared his throat and swallowed before trying again. “I thought you liked Mr. Wayne.”
“Which is not an obligation, Tony, despite what she likes to think,” Steve reminded him (and himself) while he busied himself pulling the freshly dried laundry out of the dryer. “She invited you to dinner this Thursday at 5:30pm. How would that work for you?”
“He didn’t break into the house,” Tony hurried to say while kicking his unaware brother under the table. “I needed to reach something in the living room, there was nowhere to rest the ladder, and the chairs were too short.”
“You know what? On second thought,” he said quickly, “you’re right. You probably haven’t changed that much. Southern food, constant manual labor—why should you look different after eight years of sitting at a desk and walking a few dozen miles a day? Unless, that’s important to you.”
Steve dared to look up, dared to straighten up to stand tall beside Tony. That was when he finally made out the two men standing on the raised porch with rifles in their hands.
Tony blinked across at him, dumbfounded. “Come again?”
“Time is relative,” Jane reminded him with hearts in her eyes. “Pepper’s engaged, James is dating an amazing woman… you’ll graduate in seven months and what will you have to show for it? A robot?”
To make it worse, Thor wanted to go all out for his friends with a suckling pig. He’d made it sound so easy, but it turns out that without Asgard magic, a pig needed more than 90 minutes to cook all the way through. Steve didn’t want take-out on a night he hoped would be special and memorable, so Clint came in clutch with plans for a comforting, homemade dinner.
Warning: the religious laws of Qatar outlaw homosexuality, and the brutal punishment for that is (briefly) mentioned.
As if the experience had not been mortifying already, Tony rubbed both hands over his blushing face and groaned into his palms, as if hiding himself from the world would somehow help him escape this minor nightmare.
“And they accuse me of being romantic,” Tony muttered in feigned irritation, and he felt Steve’s silent laughter against his chest and in the strong arms holding him.
“Easy, Tony. Pace yourself,” Steve soothed and helped Tony find a more restful position on his belly. Tony grit his teeth and did as he was told. The next words out of Steve’s mouth were unintelligible to him, but they weren’t for him: Steve was giving the other masters a piece of his mind, and to Tony’s relief, the others stepped away from his body at once.
Steve could practically see Tony rolling his eyes when he pushed his hips back and snapped at him. “If you don’t give me that cock in the next second, Steve, I swear to fucking god—”
to talk but had nothing in common to talk about.
“I’m your lucky star,” Steve teased, then with a quiet laugh he quickly added, “just a government grunt with friends in low places. I would have been screwed without your help, so I pulled some strings. Was it too much?”
“You know,” she started awkwardly, then stopped herself abruptly. Steve watched as she reconsidered and tried again. “I’ll fall asleep if I work in my room, so I’m heading to the library. Want to join?”
“I took English in school, sure, but to perform in English?”
“No,” Steve said with the distaste of someone who knew he was being duped. “You can’t…  right? You can’t ride a manatee.”
“Hey! Hey, everyone: use your indoor voices, please,” Steve called over the ruckus, just barely managing to lower their collective volume by an increment or two. It wasn’t until Tony had stopped laughing and spoke up that the mass of children clinging to his legs finally quieted to hear his answer.
“Guess he wants to look a little more special for the first date,” Sharon supposed, shrugging to herself and glancing Steve’s way as she asked, “It’s been five months for you and Tony, hasn’t it?”
Tony would have laughed if the answer wasn’t so ambiguous.
A muffled
“Is it just me or do some of these jokers look familiar?” Bucky whispered, and Tony caught Steve mutely nodding in reply.
“What?” Steve finally asked, looking from Clint to Tony. He was sure he was missing some important piece of the conversation, but he was also sure he didn’t like where any of this was headed. “Tony, what’s going on?”
“This isn’t funny!” Steve complained, but Tony’s attempt to silence himself only made him snort loudly. Steve shouldn’t have found it endearing.
Steve was calling.
“You want any music?” Happy asked in return, blatantly avoiding Steve’s question. “NPR, maybe?”
He wouldn’t gasp, he wouldn’t jump. He wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of knowing she’d scared the living daylights out of him.
“In your email,” she said, while Sam chimed in to say, “It was a group effort.”
He promised they only required six months of him. He would come back to New York then, one way or another. He promised he’d come back for Steve.
“I’ve never seen him fall asleep on a stranger before,” Steve said softly, clearly not wanting to wake his dog.
Panting and dazed, Steve glanced back over his shoulder. By some miracle, they had gone undiscovered, and in his rush to keep it that way, he pulled out as quickly as he could without hurting Tony, tied off the condom, and tossed it into the potted plant a few feet away. They were both zipping up when Tony tripped over his unmoving feet and slumped backwards into Steve’s arms.
“Kisses?” Tony whispered playfully, and Steve kept smiling at him, adoring and inviting, until he was distracted by the soft touch of Tony’s lips.
Steve threw him away from them with a thud and a clatter of jewelry. He scrambled away from them, then quickly pulled out his hand-held computer. His fingers flew over the keyboard with newfound motivation.
She left them a portfolio of recommendations both domestic and international. Steve enjoyed looking through it and talking to Tony about the exciting places they could go in their celebration together, but Tony had barely heard a word.
Bucky watched him quietly for some time before replying. “We had to pull out of tunnel 11 last year. That’d be my guess.”
Steve knew from studying the history of the kingdom that before King Howard’s exceptional intelligence and advanced weapons technology Machtberg had been a simple country of miners. They were a small enough country that the wealth of the mountain had been considerable in its time, but there were many facts he knew without truly understanding.
with the opposing counsel?”
Note: Updated sexy-times tag.
“What’s that?”
Steve gathered Tony’s struggling arms in one big paw and held him down. Tony stared up at him, wide-eyed. He knew better than to fight Steve, but if he could only convince his master that he needed a second to recover, to adjust, maybe—
“Oh, shit—stop! Don’t move,” a man’s voice told him in a commanding tone Tony didn’t really appreciate (but obeyed instinctively). Whoever the man was he approached from behind, and before Tony could lift his head to turn and look a big, turquoise butt plug dropped to the ground in front of his nose.
Steve was sitting just a few tables to his left, his back to the wall and face hidden under a baseball cap. Tony smirked at the conspicuous disguise but made his way over without delay, squeezing Steve’s shoulder gently in greeting as he sat down across from him.
“You did it,” Tony assured him, and Steve purred when he felt the unmistakable touch of Tony’s lips on his forehead. “I love you back, Steve. I’ll be right here so rest now, and then you come home with me.”
Tony hesitated for a moment, glanced at Steve with a considering look, then quietly said, “A younger brother. He’s back at home. He likes the ranch life better than I ever did.”
“I,” Tony stammered, choking on his own words, and if Steve wasn’t worried before, he feared he’d lose his cool any second until Tony coughed up a breathless, disbelieving laugh.
“Goodness, no! I find my job deeply fulfilling: I uphold peace, tranquility,” Bruce replied, palpably shaken by Tony’s whirlwind dreams of long-forgotten barbarism. “You're addicted to a distant past, high from its harshness, buzzed by its brutality. The venerable Governor Alexander G. Pierce has sacrificed much to create our peaceful world, and frankly, as your friend, I must strongly advise you to reconsider your hobbies if you ever wish to mature. A certified adult would not dream so fondly of violence as you do, Tony Stark.”
” Tony started to say, but thankfully someone came up to offer him a bow and quiver before he gathered too much steam. He shot Barnes a withering side-eye before remembering that he was in public, and quickly did his best to restrain his flare of competitive indignation.
Contrary to what people might believe, Steve was aware of how people perceived him. He had a lifetime of experience in being judged. As a kid, he’d been smaller and weaker than his peers, and his closet of hand-me-downs from kind neighbors and Salvation Army sales finds made his and his mom’s circumstances obvious everywhere he went. As an adult, people measured his tailored, brand-name clothes and his expensive car against his youth and treated him as a spoiled child of wealth who had side-stepped effort and hard work by coasting along on a trust fund and his good looks. A dim blond who wouldn’t open the New Yorker except to look at the pretty pictures. A man whose greatest aspirations were to host charity events for underprivileged youth in the Hamptons and to snare a trophy wife who could pop out three handsome kids (and at least two sons).
They got back to the office and took their saved seats on either side of Bruce just as Yinsen walked into the conference room.
“Rest, my pet,” Steve told him in a whisper, rubbing down Tony’s flanks with a warm, reassuring touch. “I am here. No-one will hurt you.”
“You got it,” he replied with a smile and a wave to his students, as if he wasn't experiencing massively contradictory epiphanies at the same time.
“No… it sounds so nice,” Steve mumbled, barely intelligible but very insistent. Listening to Tony’s voice, hearing his smiles, his laughter, and having his attention, all of it was infinitely better than being left with the thoughts swirling around in the forefront of his mind. “It’s still cold here,” he said then, clearing his throat so maybe Tony could hear him better.
“If I read one more script about soldiers or police officers or special agents, I’m going to scream.”
Bucky swiveled in his chair with no intention of standing to greet the very special Special Agent and his trailing entourage. Steve resisted the urge to roll his eyes but when Hammer asked who of them was Rogers and who was Carter, Steve pushed off the desk to stand at his full height, looming over Hammer all too easily.
Tony audibly floundered on the other end of the line, and oh how Steve kicked himself for dropping that particular line when he wasn’t there to see Tony’s face in person. If only he had had the time to cherish it.
“Rhodey,” Tony said right off the top, which made sense. “Anna Kendrick. Emma Thompson.”
He pushed his door open, hung his coat and his keys up on a hook by the door, then threw on the lights.
“Lieutenant Bruce Banner, stand down,” Fury said in a tone that brooked no arguments. “We uphold peace and we continue the order of New Yorseylvania as we always have. That, is how we will live.”
The redhead’s wry look softened into a smile of understanding. “The professors? Yeah, they do that. Socratic method.”
. All rational arguments for comforting Steve abandoned him, and instead  Tony fought back the overwhelming urge to pull Steve into his arms.
Steve and a handful of brave New Yorseylvanian peace officers arrived in time to see masses of museum patrons fleeing the Governor’s compound.
“Then why don’t you go eat your tasty lunch, and I’ll help the kids if they have any questions. And Friday night, I’ll toss your salad and we’ll see how good it really can be,” Tony murmured quietly and so matter-of-factly that Steve nearly choked on air.
is out there sending my man flowers, Pepper.”
“Do not fear: I will not breakfast alone. I took your advice and called Lila,” Steve heard Tony explain in the video, confirming Steve’s own guess. “She and Shuri are here now and they have graciously allowed me to join them today on a visit to the Queen’s Troupe and the visiting exhibition of Victor Hugo’s artworks. Incidentally, Shuri let it slip that her brother’s birthday approaches. How do you think he would like a Super Soaker? From us both, of course.”
“Yes, baby,” she promised, and turned on her heel to do that exactly.
There was a long pause on the other end of the line before she spoke again. “Son, I know that sounds reasonable,” she confessed in a suspiciously gentle tone. “But some things we need to know early on—”
Steve grabbed Sitwell by the throat and lifted him off his feet. Frozen in shock, Tony stared up at the bald man, wide-eyed. He should perhaps have felt alarm or discomfort from Steve’s behavior, but he was in absolute awe. Sitwell wasn’t an underfed man, after all, and Tony found he couldn’t resist glancing at Steve and the way his uniform strained over his lifting arm to contain his power.
Their most consistent ritual was the morning shave. Every morning that they were both in the White House, Steve shaved Tony’s beard. If Tony had big matters of state or a televised speech to deliver, it was an old fashioned shave with a straight razor, but days that were more casual and administrative, Steve was happy with a regular double-edged razor.
“‘s ok,” Steve rasped stubbornly, and when he squeezed Tony’s wrist again, Tony gasped and pulled away.
After a moment’s hesitation, Steve dared to nose at Tony’s soft hair and breathe him in. He savored the spicy, clean smell of him, nearly losing himself to his overwhelmed senses. But this wasn’t just some physical spell, so Steve pulled back before his eager hands and pounding heart got the better of him.
Clint frowned, but in the end, he only sighed and said, “At least get a saddle on him first.”
—and Tony didn’t have the spine to walk away.
Steve sat motionless on the sofa for some time thinking about what he should do. His first instinct was to call Tony and leave him a video message thanking him for listening to Jim and Natasha, but if Tony saw him now… Steve couldn’t do that to him. In the end, Steve decided to take a quick shower, take the sleeping pills Coulson kept offering him, and left instructions not to be disturbed for ten hours.
“Sorry ‘bout the shitty news, dude,” Patrick said after a beat, sounding sincerely bummed out on Steve’s behalf. He pushed away from his desk to rummage through his drawer for a second before stretching across the room to offer Steve an unopened bottle of Johnnie Walker.
“We will never speak of this,” he muttered at Tony while they clomped along the trail.
It was common decency, and yet Steve’s heart fluttered. What would a cool person say? Damnit, this was high school all over again.
But who was he kidding?
He needed back-up.
“...unless he didn’t get it,” Sam said after a beat, sitting up in his chair. “Is it too late to get an annulment?”
Tony rubbed his palms over Steve’s back in big, soothing circles. “Come on, Steve. Let’s get in bed.”
“So, how do you feel about using that dragon now?”
“That’s a spectacular question that I can’t wait for Steve to answer over dinner,” Tony said with an innocent look and a helpless shrug. Carol wasn’t exactly the patient type, and she looked ready to tackle him to spill the damn beans - except with her sparkling white pant suit and all the media focused on them, she had to keep her fists to herself. Instead, she satisfied herself with making him pose for a picture with her and smiling at him with far too many teeth.
, I need to demonstrate that I can speak to the fairer demographic, not just the men.”
Her reaction was the last possible one Brock would have anticipated, and with a frown of irritation, he turned to take in the people milling around him. People were tall and lean, willowy almost, like they had never seen a protein shake in their collective lives. But in contrast to the fashion of his time, none of them showcased their bodies in skinny jeans, fitted tees, or sheath dresses.
“You broke up with Brock?”
But Pepper had promised him the phone call went well. She wouldn’t say how well, or share important details, like whether Steve asked about him, or said anything about him, or in any way sounded happy, sad, or love-sick over the phone.
“Room service!”
“I’m a fan, why wouldn’t I talk to other fans?” Steve asked in a tone that suggested Jimmy’s question was the silly one, leaving the ‘duh’ implied.
“For our first date back together,” Tony whispered softly, “let’s go to the clinic tomorrow. Have every fucking test so
“Shh, down, girl—enough,” he managed when he finally pushed her away. She rolled off, obedient but grudgingly so, and lay as close to his side as she could, begging for more pets and love with her whole body. Her butt shook with the force of her wagging tail and her toe-beans flexed into the bedding in her excitement, but she was determined to lay still on the bed like a good, patient dog.
“...Steve? What’s wrong?” Tony asked, looking down at himself to be sure he wasn’t bleeding through his vest or something. Workshop scrapes usually looked worse than they were, but Steve never liked the idea of Tony’s blood leaving his body.
“I’d like that, Steve,” he said in the end with a fond smile. “Fifty days.”
Steve perked up at the question, grinning wickedly at the thought. “Oh, I sure hope so, that would be so hot—”
Steve jumped out of his skin and clutched at his heart. When his eyes focused on Tony, Tony was standing right in front of him, reaching for Steve’s hands. Steve reached back for him with unsteady hands, and Tony frowned in his concern.
With a shake of his head, Tony quietly snorted to himself and leaned back in his own seat. “I am a writer. Not for books,” he clarified, before Steve asked, “I write about tech and anything that runs on an engine for
“You come on my cock,” he reminded him, grinding into Tony’s body after a particularly rough thrust.
Tony shut the door behind him, leaving the demands and the responsibilities behind him to the extent that he could. He was tired, so tired his fingers curled around his work phone even though he couldn’t remember if he was still holding it. Tired enough that when he acknowledged the soldiers he passed, he wasn’t sure whether he did so in English, Spanish, French or Russian.
,” Tony croaked, feeling his soul crumbling under the weight of the words. The committee wouldn’t pass him if he just got up there with a robot and monologued like some benevolent Bond villain. Proof, he needed to show them
“This isn’t about trust, Pepper,” Steve lied without so much as a second thought. “His Majesty is my husband, and unless Dr. Betz feels that Tony needs specialized care, I will care for him.”
If he didn’t know any better, Tony would have guessed his friend looked afraid, but that wasn’t his Steve. Steve Rogers jumped into any stunt with gusto. He faced crowds of thousands with infectious confidence and walked into every meeting with a warm smile and a firm handshake. Fear itself would know better than to mess with Steve Rogers.
“You’re not the boss of me,” Tony groused, but he eyed that water bottle, because if he thought about anything besides the fact that Steve hadn’t mentioned him, or asked about him, or even called him, he’d probably realize he was kind of thirsty.
“Good! That makes two of us, Tony! Would you please go and do your monologue, do the sketches, then come home so I can fuck
“That’s why there’s two of us,” Steve teased, whispering the words into Tony’s hair before pressing a kiss to Tony’s temple. “You’re the genius, and I’m the iron man.”
break into GayArrangements.com to dig through their membership records, but without the necessary paperwork legally allowing them to do so, none of it would hold up in court. The last thing they needed was to build a case borne of the poisoned tree.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Are you doing this on purpose?” he complained, giving his mom a warning look before turning to glare at his dad and brother. “This is fun for you, embarrassing me in front of Steve?”
He pulled down the tattered scarf obscuring half his face, and Tony watched as horror flickered across Steve’s expression.
- he had such thick fingers after all, and technology wasn’t his strongest suit. He had meant to buy it for himself, but autofill had charged it to Tony’s credit card and arranged it to be delivered to Tony’s address while Steve was entirely helpless to stop the transaction from going through.
“Wanna take a last ride on the Captain for good luck?” Rhodey teased, and Tony snickered at the old, childish joke. “Show ‘em all how it’s done?”
Slowly, Tony rolled to the side enough so he could see Steve. He hadn’t turned the lights on or pulled the curtains aside to let the sunlight in, but there was still enough light in the room for him to see Steve looking like a dream in his dress blues.
“What—what do you mean?” Steve stammered, momentarily breathless. He was bracing himself and gearing up for insisting that it
“Then you know, it just takes over. There’s nothing you can do about it. So I turned to him and I said, ‘Would you like to follow me to my college and I’ll suck you off?’”
Steve jerked his chin in an uncoordinated attempt to nod. “What if I wanted to stay?”
Steve spun around and came to an immediate halt at the sight of Tony in his evening wear. He was dressed in a crisp, black kimono, and Steve’s gaze swept over Tony’s strong shoulders, and down his finely made robe that left little to the imagination with its wide, plunging neckline. Under his kimono and framed by the alluring contrast of black fabric against his naked skin, Tony wore delicate silver chains that spilled down from a necklace and drew Steve’s attention down along his long, lean frame. With his every movement, the silver glimmered against Tony’s tan skin as if to remind Steve never to let his his attention stray from this man.
“Yes. Alright, good people,” Hammer recovered said after a loaded pause. “Back to work, chop chop!”
Steve whistled for the dragon while he was still in Clint’s cell, then snuck out to meet her under cover of darkness. He slept under the protective cover of her wing like he had every night on the road. Anyone who tried to visit the Chief’s betrothed was turned away by the threat of her dragon’s wrath, and it was not until sundown that the dragon lifted her wings again to allow Stephanie to emerge.
“It’s been years,” Steve said under his breath, keeping his eyes turned down as he spoke. It was easier to find the words if he looked at Tony’s chest rather than meeting his eyes. “I never liked… never, I guess, really had anyone I thought—I mean,” he cleared his throat and tried again. “I know it can be good, and I think it could, with you. I want to try it, bottoming,” he finally managed to say, even if in a whisper. “For you. I trust you.”
“Oh, thank god,” Steve sighed with a breath of grateful relief, only to immediately catch himself. “Oh, no. No, Steven, not good,” he mumbled to himself, but by the time he tried to stop Bucky, Bucky was nowhere to be seen.
Steve clapped a hand over Tony’s mouth and stopped dead in his tracks. The uninvited touch of a stranger - and a stranger who had just slid down a grimy ladder into the sewers, no less - was enough to make Tony want to scream, but he choked down his reactionary alarm and tried to focus.
“You okay?”
“That does sound rough,” he seconded sympathetically after his first bite. “Does he have a reason for doing it?”
“You’re alright, angel,” Tony cooed at her, rubbing her flank and pulling her close to kiss her brow. To hell with Mr. Perfect; impressing fleeting eye-candy wasn’t half as important as reassuring his little girl that she was loved and forgiven. “That’s my good girl, Marple, such a good girl.”
“Tony, I got it for you.”
“Nick Giordani, November 29th,” Steve said with a quiet sigh. “His body was discovered two days later at GMD Shipyard, posed nude. Amy Nyugen, December 7th, posed nude in an alley between 86th and 85th; her case was initially with the 62nd until the 20th found Tara Jones in the Seventy-ninth Street Boat Basin, also nude, also posed. That’s when we noticed the pattern.”
The exhibit plaque described it as a Magnetic Accelerator Gun, or AcMag. It was from the late 21st century, and it manipulated magnetic fields to pulverise its target.
“Your spit, it’s—” he tried to say, but he was too far gone to string sentences together. “Drives me crazy.”
Steve forced the rest of the dildo into him, one bead after another, and despite the grip Steve had of his cock, Tony’s orgasm tore through him once Steve started fucking him in earnest in tandem with the beaded dildo.
Steve followed Tony’s lead into the apartment building. Tony unlocked the building’s front door with a retinal scan, and engaged the elevator with his palm print.
“Really?” Jimmy laughed in genuine surprise, and Steve turned his attention back to him. “Do you—do you ever, like, talk to them?”
If he hadn’t known Bucky like he did, Steve might have believed him.
like a man. He sure filled out his uniform with excellent potential, but what if you got down there and his sperm were as hot as his laser vision? Or maybe his alien body was simply at a different acidic point and would chemically fuck your shit up from the inside?
He crawled a little closer to the other pets and laid down a respectful distance away. Tony guessed they were both somewhat older than him, at most in their mid-twenties, but it was difficult to tell in orange light. As they realized what he was trying to do, they both looked up to watch him. Tony scrambled to think of something to say.
“How come King Howard invited American soldiers after the war?” he wondered after a long, meditative silence.
“I went to the meeting,” Steve said without prompting, already sighing at the memory. “The producers were interested, no question, but the director… after the first couple of minutes, he was silent. Dead silent.”
Steve watched color rising in Tony’s cheeks as he stared down at him. Unbidden, Steve found himself marveling at the affection and warmth in Tony’s beautiful brown eyes. His breath caught in his throat at the odd thought about his friend, and he probably should panic or run away or call his therapist, but Tony turned his blushing face into the couch cushion and groaned.
“And what predator do you know more powerful than Woman?” Tony whispered, and gently he clapped Clint’s neck in encouragement. “Come, I think we’re onto something. If we thought to seek refuge in such a cave, why should not the Last Chief have done the same?”
On one hand, Steve was inwardly pleased by the photo they’d chosen of him - something from the Armani fall collection earlier in the year where he was fully dressed. The close-up photo of Tony in a well-cut suit, smiling at an event of some kind, was also very flattering. Steve resisted the urge to ask if he could keep the paper.
Mrs. Hansen told them how she’d only guessed about the cheating, but it wasn’t until one of the women he’d hired grew a conscience and called her that she knew for certain. The sex worker had seen a family photograph in the husband’s office, and told Hansen later that their daughters reminded her of a childhood photo of herself and her baby sister. That memory had inspired her to come clean with Mrs. Hansen the next day.
Tony sighed inwardly and tried to resist his initial temper at the conversation they never seemed to resolve.
Sarah dumped her purse and her big winter coat over an empty kitchen chair and wrapped her arms around him. “Honey lamb, what’s gotten into you?” she murmured into his hair, holding him tight. “What are you doing?”
am I?”
“Baseball. Until eight,” he promised.
“Your Majesty! Forgive me,” she said in a rush, scrambling to get out of bed. Whatever her plan was, Tony feared she was trying to stand to bow, so he placed the food on a small table provided for her and hurried to help her get back into bed.
Steve blinked his eyes open and turned to Tony with an unformed question in his expression. Tony immediately quieted. What were the odds that Steve hadn’t heard so much? But as Steve pushed himself up to lean against the cushioned headboard of their bed and pulled Tony with him, his thoughtful, attentive look quickly put Tony’s last hope to rest. There was no doubt he had heard every word.
The thing was, Steve loved it when Tony stayed the night. They’d either cook or go out for dinner, then collapse together in bed to just let the day roll off their backs. Sometimes it was as quiet and peaceful as reading their own books or magazines, but as their nights together became less of an exception and more of a norm, they started watching TV shows together, too.
Which was to say, if Steve’s kitchen was suited to anything, it was getting through pining after an unattainable crush.
Like an ant under a magnifying glass on a sunny day, Steve could feel Tony staring at him. He refused to turn, refused to look at anything but the eight thousand dollar watch on his wrist that assured him that time hadn’t stopped, and that he was still a safe man: a man of means.
“Sure you don’t, like most of everyone in Gotham.”
Tony glanced into paper bag long enough that Steve knew he was thinking. Eight stacks of fresh twenties still in their wrapping from the bank. A genius like Tony didn’t need more than a second to realize he had 16,000 pounds in his hands.
She must have been satisfied with his answers, because she smiled back. “You asked him yet?” Steve was too surprised to do anything but nod, but she only seemed happier for it. “He said yes?”
Warning: Mention of past drug abuse and past sexual acts (not between Tony and Steve).
Tony eyed Steve like he couldn’t be sure if this was a joke. He glanced at the pictures for the sake of having done it, but all he could do was shrug. “They look like people that could have appeared at my book signings, sure. He looks like he could have appeared in my bed. But I’ve never seen them before in my life.”
,” Tony reminded him, but angry and stressed as he was, he still came around the couch to kiss his own husband good-bye.
“Thank you for being on time,” Tony replied, “you ready to go?”
“I, well,” Tony stammered for a moment. “I, I wanted to tell you in person? I—is now a good time? I can pick you up.”
“And you become
to dinner tonight, and you let me read to Seamus again before you head back to Boston.”
Tony couldn’t identify those words or languages, and it didn’t seem like they understood him either. He’d known that the aliens harvested all around the Earth, and that the harvesters often specialized in different genders and cultures, but Tony hadn’t faced any evidence of it until this moment. Foolishly, he’d always assumed that if he had the chance, he’d be able to communicate and bond with other Terrans. It hadn’t occurred to him that they wouldn’t speak English.
“You know,” he said, “I was afraid nobody would show up. Seamus always looks a little glum when that happens, you’re really going to make his day. He likes being pet, too, if you like, but he’s happy just listening to you reading for him if you prefer that. What book did you bring to share with him?” he asked then, clearly eyeing the book Tony had grabbed out of the display earlier.
Peggy cleared her throat and Steve looked up from IBD just in time to see
There was no reason for Captain America to know anything about him, but Tony didn’t care. All that mattered was that he wanted Tony. After all these years of people thinking he was too strange, his hobbies uncouth and his excitement uncivilized, somebody was finally interested in Tony as their steward.
Bruce moved aside a multi-colored puzzle cube with great caution so that he could perch on his partner's desk. He waited patiently for Tony to finish and disconnect the call before shoving the unlocked tablet under his nose.
He squeezed his sore cock harder. He whimpered pitifully, breathlessly, and his body convulsed from the painful sting of the bleeding cuts left across his shaft. But over the sound of his heartbeat pounding in his ears, he could make out the soft, appreciative groan of the crowd, and the involuntary jerk of Steve’s hips under him.
“If you think more carefully,” Steve drawled, “a close friend of yours recently got you something very colorful… literally colorful…”
It was waking up in the morning with Tony in his bed that was the problem.
Tony openly stared; he couldn’t believe his ears. This was, without question, more than he could have hoped for two days ago. There was a momentary hesitation stemming from suspicion and cynicism, because something wasn’t right.  This Adonis in his lap, with his broad shoulders and stunning pecs, should know better. Except, nobody knew what was right for Steve better than Steve, and if
Of all the conversations to have instead, this had to be it.
“That, well. You’re not wrong,” Steve agreed with a quiet laugh. “This story has a way of staying with you.”
Steve grinned, and, thoughtful as he was, offered his drink to Tony. Tony downed it like a shot.
“Where am I?” Tony had mumbled drowsily when Steve lifted one of Tony’s legs to rest against his shoulder.
The elevator doors pinged open on the twelfth floor unnoticed. Santa himself could have entered the precinct to rub his existence in everybody’s noses and not a single detective would have seen him coming. Some detectives were occupied with interrogations and a handful of others divided their attention between their phones and taking notes, while most were on the move. It was nearly five o’clock, and they had places to go and paperwork to file before admins left for the day.
. Days, weeks, maybe even months ago, Brock had planned this moment. How many nights had they spent together after Brock had decided Steve wasn’t good enough? How many times had Steve reminded Brock of how much he loved him without knowing the reply he got in return was a hollow lie?
“I think the audience is too busy staring to laugh, Tony,” Graham observed in a grave whisper, and everyone, Tony included, laughed.
“I hope Vargas gets a shot in before Bond kills him,” Tony grumbled with feeling. Not that anyone believed it; all Q-branch analysts remembered their first dance with an operative they’d like to smack around, and for many of them, that dance had been with Bond himself.
“But you make me
“Steve Rogers, how certain are you of this decision?” Tony whispered, looking at Steve with a grim expression.
Sure it was disgusting, and maybe his sense of smell was more about guesswork than it was five years ago, but at least he was free. At least he was alone. At least he was safe. Between the natural stench of his swamp and the coming storm, he could sleep tonight without worrying whether this would be the night when the Women found him.
“You know the cast and crew would have wanted to be the first to congratulate you, right?” Bucky added more quietly, and his less absurd point made Steve pay attention. “Let people know you’re planning to be open about it so we can speak up. Nobody wants to throw you under the bus if they think you’re trying to stay private.”
All at once it caught up to him—the delayed plane, the missed connection, the shitty turbulence that kept Tony on the edge of his seat but Steve somehow slept through—and Tony shot up with a startled breath. “I’m up! I’m up,” he promised, grasping at Steve’s arm to help push himself upright. “Shit, I’m good. Are we late?”
Tony blinked up at him. It wasn’t a question he had expected, and he eased his grip of Steve’s hair and started to absently stroke his hair and rub his scalp as he weighed his answer. Steve sighed softly and eased himself down on Tony, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder happily while he waited for Tony’s answer.
Tony frowned and barely contained his whine. “You’re leaving me to handle a predator?”
“Alright: fifty times,” Steve changed his mind as Tony complained again. “Keep talking, Tony, this is only getting better on my end.”
“Honestly, I think it’s hit and miss. His parents know but I doubt he’s told his grandmother; he introduced me to her as his ‘friend’ last summer. And she really liked me,” Steve felt compelled to say. “Sharon’s from Connecticut. She belongs to his country club, and I’m sure someone in her family got here on the Mayflower.”
“Home field advantage,” Steve said in understanding, and Bucky nodded.
“Queen Sarah came to power under different circumstances, and Terrini was a different place. Mächtingen do not expect us to, to rub elbows with them at a Christmas market. There will be knives and alcohol, if it gets dangerous—”
“It’s for you,” Steve told him, and smiled to himself at the way Tony’s eyes grew wide with excitement. “I wanted to apologize for, you know. Earlier. If you wear that sort of thing.”
Tony’s regained spark of attention faded at Steve’s question, and he walked around to set the platter on his coffee table and take a seat on the couch. Steve could either sit beside him on the soft couch, or on a hand-carved armchair.
“It’s not like they’re
“Giordani, Nguyen, Jones,” Tony said their names as if they’d been family, people whose welfare were dear to him. “Did they suffer?”
“Is, uh. Is the serum fading?” he asked without looking up from the documents. He couldn’t look at Tony, not now.
“I already felt like an idiot for being the most awkward person in a the history of conversations, ever,” Steve explained, which wasn’t a lie, but it also wasn’t the truth. “And if he’s important to you, I just. I hope I didn’t make a bad impression.”
Steve wasn’t as lucky. Bucky chewed him up and spat him out for causing such an unnecessary scare. When he hadn’t answered the bathroom door on Bucky’s first, second, or fifth knock, Bucky feared the worst. Stane was still presumed to be alive somewhere, it wasn’t impossible to think he’d retaliate against the king who now sat on his old throne. Bucky’d immediately sent security out looking for Steve while he took it upon himself to become a human battering ram.
Tony suspected few, if any, could ever muster genuine compassion for Women. He doubted he ever could himself.
“But you already
“He attacked me!”
When he got to the 17th floor, Bucky was already waiting for him in the elevator lobby. They ran at each other, each pulling the other into a strong embrace from either direction. For the first time in over twenty years, they were inseparable again.
“Sure, honey, I’ll try to remember that,” she said with her usual cheer, and none of the touching heartache she’d spouted seconds ago. “You just make sure you’re both here for dinner next Thursday at 5:30pm. He doesn’t have to bring a side-dish, but remind him that mama prefer reds to whites.”
Tony watched him fix the shirt and get dressed. He smoothed out Steve’s lapels and tied his tie. He kissed him goodbye and watched him walk away.
Round after round they advanced well ahead of their competition, until it was only the two of them and a third man left in the game. By then the targets had been moved so far back the colors were nearly indistinguishable from each other. Tony managed to hit the bullseye with his first shot, but the second arrow strayed and cost him a point. Bucky tied him, but couldn’t score a perfect twenty either.
“It’s weird though, isn’t it?”
sent me a "I didn't know you could do that" prompt, and so I wrote this (my first prompt fill! =D).
Tony Stark posts a photo of what looks like a ceiling with a mysterious message that sounds a lot like…… an ENGAGEMENT announcement???
Despite his attempt to keep his composure, Tony’s lips thinned in a sudden flash of anger. “For six months,
“Breathe,” Tony told Steve in a whisper. This time, Steve did as Tony said, breathing in slow and steady through his nose. With one hand on Steve’s hip, Tony shuffled just a little closer, lining them up carefully, and then there was no turning back.
“And I haven’t been cleaner in my entire life,” Steve complained in return, his lips tugging up at the corners as he strained to keep from grinning.
“Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. I need a break,” Tony grumbled mostly to himself, then with a quick check-in with Bucky he threw down his headset and walked away. If he was going to deal with 007 again, he needed something a hell of a lot stronger than coffee.
, it’s really funny looking, because it’s all coiled and bunched up, like a corkscrew telephone cord.”
Tony keened like a wounded animal, clawing at the bedspread and biting into his pillow with Steve’s every touch, his ass pumping down on Steve’s fingers even as he tried to draw away; Steve brought his dry hand up to the small of Tony’s back, and with a firm pressure stilled Tony’s attempts to pull away long enough to slip in a second finger beside the first.
“If you’re just saying that…”
Steve took long, measured breaths in the early stages of fighting off his gag reflex. Every time he swallowed, his throat constricted and kneaded the length of Tony’s cock in quick pulses as his body tried to resisted the intrusion. Before Tony had the chance to adjust, Steve pulled back only to swallow him down to the root again, repeating it more eagerly and more quickly until he was bobbing on Tony’s cock, fucking his throat raw.
