Natasha sat on her bed, resting her elbows on her knees and her head in her hands. Clint moved so he was standing next to the end of the bed while Bruce came to a stop in the doorway. Clint did not think that was the smartest place to be as it could lead to Nat feeling trapped, but he held back from saying anything. Instead, he waited to see how she would react to this intrusion upon her space. She did not, so Clint went on ahead.
"Do you think I'm doing the wrong thing?" The question gave Steve pause. He felt as though Tony had just asked the unanswerable.
"No!" Rebecca's face was bright red, and tears were streaming down her face. "It's too cold! I wanna go in!"
"Well," Lara said. "They said in the security office that it was on floor P1. Could something in the lab have broken to cause this." Bruce shook his head.
Remember kids, in real life, you don't want to go unfreezing people from ice. The curse of Ötzi is very much real. (Look it up.)
"Are you kidding?" Steve questioned. "After hearing what Tony went through, it just scares me more."
"Steve!" she called after him. He didn't hear her or at least acted like he didn't. "Steve!" He still didn't stop. Natasha moved faster to catch up to him and grabbed his shoulder. He instantly spun around with a surprised look on his face. Okay, maybe he really didn't hear her. "Hey," she said cautiously. "Are you okay?"
"So?" Rhodey said. "That still doesn't mean he should have gone and done this to you. I mean, fucking hell, he was too much of a coward to show his own damn face. That tells me he knew what he was doing was going to hurt you and that he did not want to suffer the same consequences. Christ, even now no one thinks it is him. I've heard these tabloids throw out a dozen possible names as to who that could be and not once have, I heard the name 'Tiberius Stone.'"
"The Disciple's Wing?" He was practically stuttering with shock. "But, Brother Daniel, I just lost my job. Shouldn't I be moving to the Proles' Center?"
"Well, as I said, we started off at the gala," she said. "Then I noticed that Tony was drunk and making people around him uncomfortable, so I took it upon myself to remove him from the situation. In hindsight, I was probably too pushy and that caused him to lash out at me."
Already, Natasha was feeling that hurt. Clint wasn't dead yet. Hill assured her of that much, but things weren't looking good. Even though it had only been less than twenty-four hours, Clint had already progressed to the "spewing blood out of every orifice" stage of Ebola. Apparently, despite being one of the most well-known symptoms of the disease, uncontrolled bleeding usually didn't start until five to seven days after becoming infected. The disease had been genetically modified, most likely to speed up the time frame of its progression. As a result, Clint was on a ventilator, likely only hours away from death. That was, unless Natasha could get Sharpton to talk.
"Usually," he said with a shrug. The doctor's smile didn't waver as she approached with an extended hand.
Tony put his phone down on the table and sunk into his seat, shutting his eyes. Unsure of how much time they had left in the flight, he wasn't sure if he should fall asleep. Instead, he kept his eyes closed, and his mind on the very edge of awareness. He could hear Steve, Bruce, Barton, and Romanoff strike up a conversation. At one point, Steve ran his hand up and down Tony's arm in a comforting gesture. Tony smiled and leaned into the touch. It was lovely, peaceful. He liked it. He could spend the rest of his life like this.
"Levels are holding steady," Pepper remarked as Tony came closer to her, not bothering to look behind her. "I think?"
"Let them grid themselves," Loki dismissed as an illusionary image of himself appeared in front of the Other. "I will lead them into glorious battle."
"Yes," he said. "My dad… He wasn't always the person people saw him as. A lot of things happened over the years. It changed him. I doubt he was anything like the man you knew by the time I came along."
Natasha did, though. She kept pointing out all the reasons that brining the dog back to the hotel with them was a bad idea. Even when Clint brought up the "we can't just leave him out here" argument, Natasha pointed out that they didn't have to; they could easily drop him off at the nearest emergency vet's office or animal shelter. Clint didn't listen to her, though, and just went ahead with what his gut was telling him to do. Was that true impulsiveness or just stupidity? It was probably a mixture of both.
So, for what felt like the eightieth time that day, Steve got up and started wandering the halls. He had been told that this floor acted as a pseudo-hotel for people connected with S.H.I.E.L.D. and its investigations. Currently, though, he had the entire floor to himself. It would have been nice, but Steve was starting to get a touch of cabin fever. He was desperate to at least
This was why when she heard one of the side doors squeak open, Natasha immediately pulled one of her guns from its holster and pointed it in the direction of the defenseless nurse who just walked in. The woman held up her hands to show that she had no weapons and carefully spoke in calm tones.
"Oh," she said. "Yeah, of course. Just wait one second." She gestured to the small sitting area before turning to go back to her computer. "Sit down. Make yourself comfortable."
"Because eventually, you're going to have to make a choice," Carol said. "It might not be today, but for your sake, I hope it comes sooner rather than later. That day I could have either shrugged off the consequences of my actions and kept on drinking, or I could accept that I needed help and start reaching out. Thankfully, I chose the latter and I was all the better for it. I gained a new best friend and my sobriety helped me to repair my relationship with my old one. I'm not going to lie, it wasn't easy – especially when I was going through withdrawals – but I'm glad I made that choice. God only knows what would have happened to me and who I would have hurt if I hadn't. When it comes time for you to make that choice, I hope you remember my story and I hope it helps you to become better." Stark looked down.
Dr. Smith must have been, too, because all she told him to do was take aspirin for any headaches and to stay hydrated. Carol let her go back to check on Jessica before sitting back down in the desk chair.
"Hey, when that girl called me 'Killer Queen' back there, was she talking about the song?" Tony laughed.
"That man I was talking to before," he said. "Stark… Tony… Can I see him again?" Dr. Fox stopped in his tracks and hesitated a moment.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you." Slowly, Knežević got up from behind the couch. His eyes took in the sight of his two young daughters. They were both the spitting image of their mother with their dark skin and curly hair. Audrey's eyes were wide with shock and recognition while Stephanie's eyes narrowed in confusion. Heartbreak hit him hard. His own daughter didn't even recognize him. It almost brought tears to his eyes, but relief quickly came in the sound of Audrey's voice.
At that point, Steve knew he would not be able to beat around the bush anymore. He looked Tony right in the eye as he said, "I'm just scared, okay?" Steve looked away from Tony. A few moments passed before he heard him give any type of reaction.
Parting ways in the parking lot, the two men got into their respective vehicles and headed to their homes. When Rhodey reached his, he made a point of running that tape over one more time as he pulled into the driveway. After getting out of the car, he swept the pieces up, took them out to his backyard fire pit, and set them ablaze.
"I have tried," Lara said. "Steve has tried. Pepper has tried. Rhodes has tried. Hell, JARVIS has tried. None of us have gotten through to him. While, yes, I do recognize that my most recent attempt hurt more than it helped – and I do intend to apologize for that – it doesn't change the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. could have intervened a lot sooner and that could have made the difference."
Charles smiled before placing his finger back on the shard again. He looked Marx directly in the eye as he asked, "what would be the best way to install socialism in a capitalist society?" Marx said nothing in response, but Charles could feel his left-hand twitch of its own accord. He didn't move or say anything, not wanting to sever the connection while he was in the middle of transferring the information. Eventually, he felt his hand stop moving and only then did he feel safe to remove his finger from the shard.
A few minutes after Hill had finished speaking, Natasha lifted her head and pulled her hands away from her ears. Slowly, she turned to Steve and looked at him with wide, pleading eyes. It was clear she was fearing the worst and was trusting him to break it to her gently. Luckily, Steve could oblige.
"I don't think I can," he answered. "That's more secret S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff. I probably can't comment on that." Everhart looked annoyed.
"Everyone's fine," he said. "Well, Pepper sustained a minor cut to her cheek, but everyone else is fine. No explosions, nothing serious happened." That last part was somewhat of a lie, but Steve did not think he could explain Captain Danvers to him right then and there. Nonetheless, Rhodes seemed to relax a bit at that.
"Oh, go screw yourself, you little bitch! I hope the cops catch you, you dumb snake!" He shouted more verbal abuse at her until she was completely out of earshot and sight. She didn't care. She's been called worse. She just wanted to find a nice comfortable alley to rest in and sleep until the next century.
"Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube," Fury said as he stepped into the room. "I was hoping you might join him."
Although the conversation was somewhat tense, Bruce had to admit, he did feel a little bit more at ease. He supposed that it was probably because it had taken his mind off the situation, if only for a few moments. Before he could really think about it, though, he heard a knock on the doorframe behind him.
"After my mum died," Oswin said through shuddering breaths. "My dad married another woman. Things only got worse from there and eventually, I hit a breaking point. I ran away from home, for real this time."
She took a deep breath of oxygen and could already feel the edge taken off her alertness. They must have turned the Anastasia on. However, she could hear what the doctor said next clearly.
"At the labs, probably," Sharpton said. "He hardly ever leaves, even for holidays." Natasha brought a hand to her earpiece.
"What if their actions were justified," Tony said. "Who's to say I didn't do anything wrong? I mean, you know what I'm like when I'm drunk."
Natasha raised her hand to the side of her head. There, she could feel the handle of a knife. She'd rather have a gun when facing the unknown, but she'd take what she could get. Wrapping her hand around the handle, she waited for the moment to strike.
"I wish I could say you have no taste," Lara said. "But I've seen Steve, so that be an outright lie. You agree with me though, right Pepper? Those workmen were sexy, right?" Pepper fought back a smile as she swallowed down a sip of her drink.
Tony was then led by a pair of agents to the other end of the room. A panel slid out of the wall, revealing a hidden doorway. Tony then followed the agents through the door down a narrow flight of stairs. At the landing there was another door that was twice as thick and had six different sets of locks; the door to the interrogation room.
Steve gave her a quizzical look, but it was washed away when he heard the clicking of high-heels coming down the hall. Turning to look behind him, he could see Pepper coming towards the waiting area. He felt an instant feeling of dread upon seeing her. Even though he didn't know her at all, he could tell by her crossed arms and the downward-directed gaze that something was wrong. Quickly, he stood to meet her, and Lara did so as well.
attracted to Tony, there was no chance there was anything more behind this night. None. Just two friends going off to spend a night on the town. Completely innocent and normal.
Shortly after that, the event ended. There were no more disruptions and no more bizarre questions. Everyone else just had normal, respectful questions for all of them and they were able to end it without any walk-outs. Once they said all their goodbyes and thanks, the five of them walked off the stage, only stopping to allow crew members to remove their microphones. Tony was impatient and ripped the thing off halfway through the removal process. He needed to get some air and a drink.
"Someone's targeting the Avengers," she said. "You know it. I know it. Steve knows it. Tony knows it. Bruce knows it. S.H.I.E.L.D. knows it. The only one who remains blissfully unaware is Thor, and that's only because you can't exactly Fed-Ex Ebola to Asgard."
Clint was stable for the most part, however, his blood pressure was dropping. He wasn't quite in the danger zone yet, but he would be if the doctors didn't get it under control soon. Hill had relayed the information that Subarian had given them and apparently the doctor had sounded more hopeful about Clint's prognosis than Subarian had been. Steve hoped he was right about that and wasn't just futilely keeping their hopes up.
"Sure," Tony said. "Just shut the door behind you." Lara nodded and did as he asked before nervously taking a step forward.
liked him. He liked him so much that when he stayed over at Steve's during the Hurricane the previous week, he almost kissed him.
"I understand that," Steve said. "But I also understand that as a patient, I have the right to refuse any medical test that I feel is unnecessary."
A large creature with a face like a turtle and that swam through the air as a whale emerged from the portal. Tony wasn't close enough to it when it came through to try and take a shot at it, and even if he could he doubted it would do any damage. The thing looked like it was heavily armored and as it got close to the ground, foot soldiers had descended from its inner shell onto the streets below. He suddenly wished he had enough time to grab a second drink, but he shook that thought off. He had to keep his head in the game.
"The test showed that you have a depressive personality and you have difficulty asserting yourself." Lara frowned.
"Hey, what's today's date?" That first question didn't set off any red flags for Steve. In fact, it was a totally normal question that someone filling out various forms would ask. However, Steve had no idea what the date was. In fact, as far as his internal clock was concerned, it was Wednesday, February 8th, 1945. He knew that was spectacularly wrong, but his brain still hadn't fully adjusted to the fact that sixty-five years had passed him by in less than the time it takes to blink your eyes.
"Alright, Sir," JARVIS responded. "Would you like me to save those search results?" Tony paused for a moment as he reached to open the door.
"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "I have my phone, which means I have JARVIS, WI-FI, and access to my personal database. That's all I really need."
Yeah, I am not feeling good right now, so if you have any questions about this chapter, just leave it in a comment or review and I'll reply when my brain isn't running at a speed of 0.001 miles per hour. I'm going to go back to bed now.
"Sure," Tony said. "Well, Dr. Banner and I get along pretty well. We've been collaborating on a few projects in the past few months. He's also working in SI's Radiation research division and it's a privilege to have his insight."
Hector Fair – who seemed to have regained the ability to think – took those words as encouragement to open his mouth again.
"Because we're a team," Natasha said. "And if you really want to try to conquer this, we'll help you."
As far as she could tell, Carol was only a little scraped up and had a few minor flash burns from the explosion. It wasn't any worse than what a sunburn would normally be for a human. There was blood on her person, but she was sure the EMTs had dismissed it as an "unknown substance." She was thankful that she wouldn't have to explain it right then, but she knew once she got to the hospital, it was going to come up.
Both members of the legal team wore the same grim expressions on their faces as they explained that they didn't have much of a case for slander against Freeman. Slander was one of the hardest things to prove in court. There had to be solid evidence that the person had the intention to hurt or defame and while that might be as plain as day to anyone that he was trying to hurt SI and Tony's reputation, they needed tangible evidence that Freeman had done exactly that. Yes, they did have a recording of the press conference and an explicit transcript of everything that he had said, but that didn't prove his intent. They needed tangible evidence of that, too, and sadly, they didn't have that. Pepper and Lara could testify that they had spoken to him beforehand and were led to believe that the content of his speech to the media would be much different, that could all easily be dismissed as hearsay.
"Oh for goodness sake, Vasyl," Lorraine practically groaned. "That's exactly what got you put into prison in the first place!"
"Well, I'd say it makes me a terrible person at least." Bruce couldn't help but frown at that. "Anyway, do you know what Barton is sick with? Is it curable?"
"Do you think you'd be able to rob a place like a lab or something?" He had to know. This girl could be the key to getting to see his girls again and providing them the life they deserved.
"Did they know before his rather alarming appearance in Stuttgart?" Again, Tony replied that he couldn't comment. Freeman cut in then.
"Escort a lady?" It was a clever cover and one Tony would be stupid to refuse. He hooked his arm around hers and together they started making their way towards the back of the room where the bar and refreshments tables were located. Tony tried not to lean on Romanoff too much – still trying desperately to give off the impression that he was fine – but again, his body and his impaired coordination skills didn't seem to want to comply with his desires.
"But Jessica's fine?" Carol nodded. Tony let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. "Good. Glad she wasn't killed because of me."
He was able to connect to the network without a problem, but the real test would be getting the call through. He normally didn't video chat with Laura. The quality wasn't always the best and there was always a noticeable lag in the transmission. If he asked Laura a question, it would be a few seconds before he'd get a response, and not through any fault of either of them. He'd rather call her, but Hill couldn't give him a work-around that was compatible with his phone. This was the best she could do. He could try IM or e-mail, but that felt too impersonal. Video chatting was probably his best choice, especially because it had the bonus of being as close to an in-person conversation as they could possibly get.
"Yes," Everhart said. "But once he heard the name 'Tony Stark' he had to have made the connection to your father, right? Do you think there was an expectation there for you to be like him; a legacy to live up to?"
Instantly, the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors started to back away while the CDC crew hovered close by. Smith hopped down from her chair and rushed over to Tony. Tilting his head up, she began to prod at his glands.
"No!" Loki struggled to sit up as it became clear that he was going to have to bargain for his own life. "I can still be of use to you!"
"When I worked for the Secret Service, I ran into S.H.I.E.L.D. a few times," Lara said. "They tended to be very helpful, especially those times when someone tried to kill the President with a freaky experimental ray gun."
"I can't either," Natasha admitted. "But can you at least stop pacing and relax a little bit?" Steve nodded.
It was difficult for him to say all of that – so much so that he forced himself to spit it out in a rather rushed manner, but it was what needed to be said. Pepper was absolutely stunned into silence.
Plunging an airplane into the Arctic Circle was a lot like that. Only instead of the anticipation of the drop, it was the actual drop itself where he was building up the fear, and the actual landing (or rather, crashing) part he was dreading. Giving one last glance at the photo of Peggy he had placed on the inside of his compass, he tightly gripped the control wheel and pushed it inwards, sending the plane into a downward descent. His heart clenched at the change of altitude, but he continued pushing forwards. What he was doing was the only option; the right option.
Blood was on the floor. It started off as little drops sprinkled about on the tile, but as the trail got closer to where she was standing, the droplets turned into more sizable puddles. Her face transitioned to an almost impossible shade of white and her stomach churned in an entirely different way.
When they arrived at the station, Lara headed for the basement level as that's where she remembered most of the restaurants being. There was indeed a place that sold ice cream and they did have a diabetic-friendly fare in stock. Unfortunately, the only flavor they could offer her was vanilla; the blandest of all the ice creams. She could deal with it, though. She wasn't
"That's never stopped you before," she said. "In fact, isn't that what you have Lara doing right now?"
"Sorry," she apologized before scurrying up on Stark's six. Natasha shut the door behind them and pressed her head against its cool wood. Carefully, she found her center again.
By the time, the movie was over, everyone had finished eating and no one was up to starting another one. Pepper – quite understandably – wanted to go home and get some sleep while Lara figured she should probably get back to her apartment "before the real weirdos started coming out." Also, by that point, it was probably safe for Carol to leave. However, she was advised to leave the city via normal transportation means like the bus and at least wait until she reached the suburbs to try flying. Carol understood and thanked them all for having her before leaving.
Steve and Tony had talked about plenty of other things, but for some reason, he homed in on that simple conversation starter. He wanted to draw something red now. Was that weird? It probably was, but who cared? Now, he had bigger things that he probably should be worried about.
They were both reluctant to leave Tony behind. Rhodey was especially so as he was keenly aware of the fact that Tony had been left at the hospital way too many times at way too young of an age. However, they really had no other choice. Both Rhodey and Happy had to work in the morning. (Although, Happy's work was probably going to consist of waiting for the hospital to release Tony.) So, they had to get home to get some rest.
Tony's heart swelled. A smile was on his face as he leaned forward and kissed Steve's cheek. Steve responded with a kiss on the lips. Settling back in to get some rest, he could feel his entire body buzzing with ecstatic energy. It took a while for him to fall asleep properly, but his last thought before he drifted off was
Looking down at the page, he found that hours had passed, and he had written several pages, explaining how multiple societies that he had never even heard of managed to successfully adapt communism (or at least, a governing style similar enough to Terran communism.) Reading it all back, Charles found himself lost in thought. He took all the information he'd been given and translated it all into his own ideas and thoughts about how American society was set up and how communism could fit into it. A few of his thoughts he scribbled down on a fresh piece of paper before he had his breakthrough: religion was never the enemy, religion was the answer. What was the best way to introduce Marxism to American society? That would be to infiltrate the church.
"Alright, boys," Natasha said. "That's sweet and all, but we kind of want to be able to eat breakfast off that counter tomorrow."
"I know I know," he muttered in response. Slowly, he dragged his head up to look Steve in the eyes. "I just wish we had more time together." Steve gave him a warm smile.
"No," Steve said. "You've done a lot for me and I really appreciate it, it's just…" A hard lump formed in Steve's throat. He couldn't say it.
As she picked up the popcorn, Lara kept glancing at the TV. Every time she looked up, she hoped the closed captions would reveal something new, but she found that the reporter was just babbling on, repeating the same three bits of information she already knew. It was par for the course for broadcast news, but the captions just made it far more grating. The only thing that changed was that after about thirty minutes, the station was finally able to bring images from the scene via their "Sky Eye Traffic-Copter." As far as Lara could tell, the explosion hadn't happened too close by. The site appeared to be by the water, while her building was more in the center of Hell's Kitchen. That came as some relief, but she still scrutinized every breath she took carefully, on high alert for even the slightest whiff of gas.
"I am the rightful ruler of Asgard," Loki said. "Cast aside by both my kingdom and my supposed family."
They fell into a silence again, but this one was much easier than the ones that proceeded it. At least that was until a particularly painful flash of lighting traveled across Tony's brain and he was unable to suppress a groan.
"Probably due to the drugs he was on and the trauma of the whole situation," Coulson offered as an explanation.
Again, though, she knew Pepper wasn't going to let her even argue to stay. She was dangerously sleep-deprived, and she knew for a fact that she didn't have enough insulin on her to last until morning. Honestly, she couldn't even convincingly argue with herself to stay. How was she going to convince Pepper? So, she reluctantly nodded.
"Oh." Disappointment was clear in Stark's voice. "Well, if you don't mind, do you think I could have a look at them sometime." Old dread started to stir up in Clint's stomach.
"Said something I shouldn't have," Tony admitted. A pang of guilt ran through him again and he had to remind himself that the fact that Steve still hadn't summoned S.H.I.E.L.D. to come pick him up was probably a good sign. It meant that he wasn't mad at Tony specifically at least. That, or he was so fed up with S.H.I.E.L.D. that spending time with someone who knew his deepest, most well-hidden secret and could potentially use it against him at any point in time (not that Tony would) seemed more appealing. Ever the optimist, though, Tony held out hope that it was the former and moved on to his next concern. "What about Pepper?"
"Alright then," he said. He heard Lorraine say something resembling "alright," before he slammed the phone against the receiver.
It was only then that Natasha relaxed. Trusting that the AI would alert them if Carol tried anything funny, she stepped into the local elevator with the others.
"Mmhm," Tony agreed as he stared disappointedly at the center screen. Pepper gave him a friendly peck on the cheek.
"No," Rhodey said. "But you can promise me you won't do that again, no matter how tired or distressed you feel."
Tony panted hard from all the screaming. Steve just stared. It was easy to see that he wasn't expecting all of that. He blinked, trying to get a grasp on everything. Tony, meanwhile, recovered and walked right past him.
Steve gently pulled back and Tony ran his tongue across his lips, trying to savor the taste of his boyfriend while he could. His cheeks burned as he caught his breath. He was probably a sight to see, but Tony didn't care. In fact, he wouldn't have minded ten more kisses like that, even if the cost were turning into a complete and utter hot mess. Tony's eyes met Steve's and he watched as the sweetest, most sincere smile spread across his face.
After that, not much happened. Tony and Happy chatted for a bit before Happy had to go back downstairs. They said their goodbyes before Tony headed for the local elevator. Briefly, he considered checking to see if Bruce was around before deciding against it. He didn't want to keep Steve waiting any longer, even if going to Steve also meant falling into the cold, cruel clutches of sleep. For Steve, he would face anything. So, he hit the button for his and Steve's apartment and waited for the elevator to come to a stop.
"…After that… I called Carol… …And she took us here…" She paused for a moment to catch her breath. It wasn't long enough, though. "I really didn't mean… …For it to be Stark. I swear on my life… They wanted me to go for… Salinas."
According to Tony, Stane had been one of the more homophobic members of his father's circle, often making jokes that upset Tony when he was younger, but now just irritated him as an adult. While Tony did not think that Stane would be openly hostile to him if he came out about his sexuality, he still clearly feared his reaction.
"I've been looking after him since I got back," he explained. "He's been a good boy. The most he's done is cry when I don't give him enough attention, but other than that, I've had no problems." Clint smiled as the puppy started licking his face.
"That's the thing," Carol said. "It's not detecting any known lethal poisons. Although, his blood-alcohol level is through the roof. Are you sure he's not just drunk?"
"I'm pretty sure those are all from the D.C. trip," he said. "There may be some stuff about the bio-terror attack, but I can't be sure. It seems to fast for them to have already made their report." Pepper shrugged.
A few days later, Steve was sick and bedridden again. Ever since he was a little kid, Steve had a weak immune system and struggled with various ailments. Chief among them was his asthma, which made breathing difficult, especially when he had a cold.
do to make this easier for you?" Steve gave Tony's question a moment of genuine contemplation. The corners of his lips began to rise.
"Yes!" he said. "Exactly! Only it doesn't even feel like I have a clear goal. I'm running just to… Run and that's fine if you know where you're going…"
"Was?" Tony looked away from him at the question. Steve knew what that meant, but he wasn't exactly processing the information. He was being told that someone he had just spoken to a few days ago had died and had a son. (Well, not in that order, obviously.) One would say he was taking it a little too well, but he also had enough valium in his system to knock out an elephant. He'd probably have some form of emotional reaction later when the drugs wore off, but for right now he was completely numb to it. However, he could see in Tony's reaction that he wasn't completely numb to it, so he said the only thing he probably could. "I'm sorry."
"Outside of that," Natasha said. "A professional? Like, maybe Andrew or one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. councilors?"
When the plane finally came to a stop and they could get off, Steve stood up, but Tony didn't move. He wondered if Tony fell back to sleep and tried gently shaking his shoulder. When that didn't work he called his name.
Dr. Smith had told him that they believed that the powder had been genetically modified Ebola and H5N1. While the idea of that terrified him, at the same time he realized that he probably didn't have it. Other than throwing up that one time, he hadn't been sick at all. In fact, he felt much better than he had in days. Either he wasn't infected, or the combination of Ebola and H5N1 was a miracle cure for withdrawal symptoms.
And never did I think that I would be caught in the wave you got me, 'cause boys love boys and girls and love is not a choice!
"I let my concerns for you cloud my judgment," Natasha explained. "I let my feelings drive my decision-making. I'm not supposed to do that. I'm
"Thank you!" Tony glared at the doctor. That wasn't any way to talk to a patient. If he could, Tony would rip off the man's protective suit and breathe on him. The only thing that stopped him was the fact that if he did go through with it, then they'd be stuck in quarantine with the doctor until the CDC made their determination. Instead, he just watched as the doctor unloaded his pent-up irritation on anyone who would listen, and the nurses prepared their equipment. He did, however, take a few steps closer to Steve.
Since he didn't want to wake up or let go of Tony, he chose to ignore it. However, the person on the other side of the door appeared to be impatient as they took the lack of response as a go-ahead to enter the room. It was Natasha's form that slipped around the door.
"You remember that vision I told you about?" he asked. "The one Loke made me see?" How could she forget? Clint was forced to watch as Laura and the kids were killed in less than a minute and were forced to relive the nastier parts of Budapest. Just hearing about it was terrifying enough. She couldn't imagine being forced to watch it repeatedly. What made it even worse was that he was apparently still plagued by the vision now even months later when he was out of Loki's control.
As if that wasn't bad enough, Lara realized as she stepped out of the shower that she didn't have a hairdryer on her. She groaned internally at herself before throwing her palm against her forehead.
The man stopped speaking suddenly. Steve realized that he must have said that last thing aloud. He tried opening his eyes again and this time he was rewarded with bright streams of light pouring into his pupils. Everything was blurry at first, but after a few seconds, it all came into focus. A man with black hair, brown eyes, a warm complexion, and a neatly trimmed beard stood over him. From the look the man was giving him, Steve could tell that the man wasn't sure what to make of him.
"What?" he said. "Just because you're a girl and I'm a guy you think you can just hit me and get away with it? You know the cops aren't going to buy that shit! Guy hits a girl; he gets the book thrown at him! Girl hits a guy; they make excuses for her and a white knight rides off with her into the sunset!"
"It'll also leave enough power to lower the emergency blinds. Sorry." Clint would be angry at Stark for not mentioning that a little sooner, but it looked like it had genuinely slipped his mind. Besides, he had other things he could be focusing his emotional energy on, like not panicking.
"It could be helpful," Natasha said. "Talking about this with someone who knows what they're talking about." Steve looked unconvinced. "That private talk I was going to have with Stark today was going to be about him possibly seeing a councilor if that helps."
"Yeah, you're probably right." Just the thought of having to stand in front of a room full of strangers and having to talk about the worst mistakes he'd ever made in his life made Tony shudder. He was barely able to talk about that stuff with
"Good morning ladies, gentlemen, and assorted members of the press," he said. "Before I hand over the microphone to Miss Potts, I have an announcement I'd like to make."
"Yeah, that is a good deal." The officer's face lifted for just the briefest of moments. "I'd consider it if the Bureau wasn't filled with some of the vilest, low-life, bottom-feeding scum that ever walked the face of the Earth! Tell them they can kiss my ass!" The officer let out a sigh of aggravation.
"I'm still not taking the risk," Lara said. "I didn't dodge the bullet just to get hit by a ricochet. Do you know how long it took me to be able to open my mail without having an anxiety attack after 9/11?"
"Uh, listen," he said. "I don't know if you know this already, but Stark's kind of…" His mouth froze mid-sentence and stayed that way for a full thirty seconds before making a face that one would make upon being force-fed a slug. "You know what, it's not my place. Never mind. I'll unlock the office for you, so you can make your call."
"Hit me with it now," he said. "It'll give me one less thing to worry about." Lara nodded. She got out of the recliner chair across from Barton and set her laptop down in front of Tony.
"You too." It was clear that Happy was just saying that to be polite and all conversation died there. Tony fell back to sleep quickly, leaving Steve to stare out the window at the passing landscape as they made their way to Malibu.
"The last time I saw Stark was when he and Nat got up to get drinks." Hill's gaze landed squarely on Natasha.
"Basically, every Tom, Dick, and Harry out there wants Tony Stark's signature, and they want it now." Tony shrugged at Lara's brief, yet apt summarization. Pepper did not seem as impressed, though.
"Sir," she said. "I know this is a shock and my own response was inappropriate. For that, I apologize, but you need to calm down." With that, Rhodey took a deep breath and found his logical center again.
However, it was futile. Nothing came out of the portal and from the angle he was at, he could see the bright light from the nuke detonating. It was over.
"Given that it is in the new health and safety protocols that yourself and Miss Potts put in place that I am to ensure that you have slept a minimum of six-hours for every twenty-four you've been awake, I would have to say so." Tony groaned again.
"That's understandable," she said, putting a hand on her shoulder. "Believe me when I tell you that we're all worried for Tony, too. We wouldn't be here if we weren't."
"That still doesn't change the fact that I need to go to work," he said. "As much as I'd like it to." Steve shrugged.
The car gave a jerk as it backed over the VHS tape and the distinctive sound of plastic cracking could be heard, but Rhodey was not satisfied. He shifted the car to dive and ran over the tape again. He backed over the tape at least three more times before he finally felt that it was good and thoroughly destroyed. After that, he pulled out of the driveway and sped down the road, leaving behind the mess of scattered plastic splinters and ruined film tape across the pavement.
Sure enough, Rebecca came running back around the corner with Bucky close on her heels, yelling for her to stop before he told on her to their mother. He kept trying to reach out to catch her, but the younger girl had an unstoppable amount of sheer will and determination to get away from her older brother that gave her a boost of speed that managed to just keep her out of his reach. Despite this, she wasn't exactly paying attention to where she was going, and neither was Bucky as he was too focused on trying to grab her. As a result, when Steve stepped into her path to try and gently stop her, she ended up slamming into the sickly boy at an incredibly high speed. Bucky slammed into them both and the force of it all sent them tumbling to the ground, with Steve taking the brunt of the fall.
"Oh God is he an idiot," he said. "He spent half the week trying to convince me that recruiting the Avengers and then he screamed at me when it didn't work. If I never had to be in the same room with him again, it'd be too soon."
"The invasion," she said. "Why did you stop it?" Glancing over at the employee standing next to the woman, Tony could see that they clearly weren't expecting her to ask that and were in about as much shock as the rest of the room. He looked towards Freeman and Lara. Lara was staring at the questioner with narrowed eyes while Freeman mouthed to him "don't answer." However, Tony felt compelled to at least say something, especially with all the awkward tension filling the room.
Thankfully, it ended up being correct. As soon as Sharpton gave Natasha the information she wanted, she let her go. Steve let out the breath he'd been holding. There was a little bit of a resurgence of the fear when Natasha froze as she started to leave, but thankfully she took all her aggression out on the door rather than on Sharpton. The Police Chief let out a sharp gasp of surprise, but Steve and Hill were unphased and quickly left to catch up with her.
"I don't know how to explain it," Natasha said. "But something about her just seemed so unsure as she was speaking. She tried to hide it under a tone of confidence, but it was still an apparent façade."
"He's not," Fury said. "I sent Commander Hill to the hotel to inform him and the other Avengers of the situation. He should still be there."
Before Carol could react, the door in front of her was ripped open and a shooting pain traveled across her back. Stumbling forward, she quickly lost her footing and began a rapid decent down a flight of stairs. She tried to use her powers to stabilize herself, but all she ended up doing was blasting the wooden steps into splinters that flew right up into her face. She slammed into a concrete wall hard, leaving her dazed for a few seconds as she fell to the floor.
"No! I don't even…" Lara took a deep breath, clearly trying to calm herself to attempt to gain some semblance of control over the situation. "Let's just go back to the hotel. You're not in any condition to stay."
Before Tony could respond or ask questions the door to his bedroom opened and Pepper came rushing in. Tony didn't realize that Steve wasn't lying next to him until he saw the super soldier moving to stand in the doorway. His attention was quickly recaptured by Pepper, though, who was pressing her hand to his forehead, concern crystal clear in her blue eyes.
Something I forgot to put in that disclaimer in the beginning, but a section of this chapter is based on Robert Downey Jr.'s own words to a reporter who was pushing him too much in an interview, even quoting him directly at points. So yeah, credit to RDJ for that. Also, the next chapter is going to feature some of Scarlett Johansson's own words to a guy who was being sexist (and kind of a creep) towards her in an interview, so if I don't remember, credit to her, too!
"I've been awake all night." Unsurprised by the admission, Tony leaned in to wrap his arms around Steve and pressed his forehead to chest.
"Why?" Adoniram asked. "So, you can tear down our defenses? Inform your superiors of our weak points?" Carol narrowed her eyes.
"They shut down Park Avenue," Tony explained. "So, once you get outside just follow the directions of the police and National Guard. They'll get you off the island safely."
He waited a minute or two to see if Tony would reply. He was doubtful he would and rightfully so as Tony had been texting him at one AM. He was probably either fast asleep or still so absorbed in whatever project that he was working on that he hadn't been to sleep yet. Steve hoped it was the former.
"So, we're back to a first name basis now, huh?" Tony pushed himself to sit up. Steve felt like he'd gotten the wind knocked out of him. His gaze went down to the floor. "What? Nothing to say to that? You seemed to have plenty to say before."
"Nothing," Tony said. "I was just thinking." Steve raised an eyebrow to try to prompt him further, but Tony did not elaborate; he just reaffirmed his grip on Steve's hand. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. All I can say is 'hold on, it gets better,' which is about the worst advice you can give to someone in any situation, but… I am trying to understand, okay? I know that doesn't make any of this better, but I am trying." Steve nodded.
"He wanted to make vaccinations and treatments for various biological agents more accessible for the average consumer," Sharpton explained. "Something about 'dark times ahead' and people needing to be prepared for the worst-case scenarios. I don't remember, but it sounded like a good idea to me. He wanted to test his vaccines against both the unaltered and altered versions of the diseases, but in order to do that he needed to be able to expose subjects to the diseases. We had the equipment and took all the safety precautions but couldn't get approval from the CDC. So, we obtained the diseases from the Black Market and Dr. Subarian headed up the research."
Once again, I want to stress that I don't intend for this break to be permanent. If I don't ever post again, assume I'm either dead or locked in Onision's basement. I will still be writing the entire time. I just want to get ahead of myself so I can be able to update regularly. I hope you all bear with me on this. I've already started Chapter Thirty if that makes anyone feel better and I hope to get as many chapters as I can under my belt before I return.
"Well, consider yourself reassured because I feel absolutely fine." Pepper gave him a disbelieving look. He knew he had to change the subject before she got a chance to argue otherwise. "Listen, what I said earlier – the 'higher standards' thing – I'm sorry. That was a low blow and I shouldn't have gone that far."
A beat of silence passed. Tony squeezed his eyes shut as if that would protect him from their pity. He could feel Steve softly rubbing his thumb over his knuckles.
"There was nothing for the serum to fix because there was nothing wrong," she said. If homosexuality truly was a disease, he would have been cured of it, but there was no disease to cure. It was just the way he was, and nothing could change that. I also realized the fact that he felt safe telling me that was huge. It meant that he was serious about me; that he wanted to have a life with me, and honestly, I had wanted that too…"
These people were despicable. They were preying on people's grief, fear, and anger in the wake of a horrific tragedy. Having spent almost twenty years of her life as a sort of galactic first-responder, Carol could think of very few things lower than that. However, she couldn't see as to what end the people running the Church hoped to achieve with this. Money? Power? Something far eviler? The possibilities ran through Carol's head at the speed of a turbo jet. It was a wonder she had been able to drift off at all.
Stark fell silent. Clint couldn't blame him for that, though. Everything he did was quite repugnant, especially when you added opening the letter to that list. Eventually, Stark did speak up, and what he said surprised Clint.
Stepping across to the other side of the room, Steve stood across from the doctor, her wide, dark brown eyes drilled directly into him the seriousness of her words.
"Well since Lara is the biggest Queen fan I happen to know; I would say probably yes." Carol let out a breath of relief.
"As much as I'd like to stand here and speculate about what's going on in that over-zealous nutjob's head, our ride's here." Tony's announcement was immediately followed by the Quinjet swooping by overhead and coming to land near where Loki was sitting. Glancing around, Steve tried to find some sort of path or clearing that led up to the top of the cliff. He couldn't see one.
"Your right," he said. "It's more likely she and Barton would stage a heist at the nearest Staples." Pepper let out a short snort of a laugh.
"Alright," he said. "I want to talk to Steve. Can we please have a minute alone?" Natasha looked away for a second, considering the request.
"Just call as many reporters as you can," Adoniram said. "Put a particular focus on those Stark has had an issue with in the past, but make sure Everhart comes first. She really knows how to get under his skin, if the D.C. interview is anything to go by."
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hellicarrier base has been attacked and in the scuffle, Agent Phil Coulson has been killed and Thor and a Hulked-out Banner are now MIA. What remains of the Avengers is broken and scattered. With very little hope left, can the team pull together?
"I don't know," he said. "You're nice enough to offer, but I don't think that's really a good idea." Salinas frowned.
As if on cue the gem in Loki's scepter began to glow and Loki's eyes drifted shut. When he opened them again, he wasn't in the deep underground tunnel anymore. Instead, he was in space, standing on the surface of the asteroid where he found himself abandoned on oh so long ago. The hooded figure that had discovered Loki that day – whom Loki had come to mentally refer to as "the other" – stood before him. Loki tried to give off the utmost sense of restraint and confidence as he looked his previous tormentor in the eyes.
"Thanks." She shrugged out of the winter coat she'd been wearing and thrusted it towards Bruce, who hadn't realized her real question had been "do you mind if I use you as a human coatrack?" He gathered the jacket into his arms while Betty excitedly stuck her hands into the glove holes on the side of the box.
"I wouldn't mind another." In moments Tony's lips were crashing against Steve's again. This time, Steve was conscious enough to respond back. It made the kiss that much more enjoyable.
"You're all set," they said. "Now all you have to do is wait for further instructions from the CDC."
She had her iPod queued up to "Another One Bites the Dust." Not her favorite Queen song, but good at drowning out background noise in her experience. Quickly after entering the building, a commotion could be heard. Lara started turning her iPod up, but as she kept going, the commotion grew louder. Turning her iPod up to the maximum volume, she finally saw what was causing all the noise.
"I told you," Lara said. "They were the pre-flight entertainment. They were a group of children who looked like they were born black but had their skin bleached and forced to preform a song wishing us good tidings on our aviary voyage. You know, sort of like Michael Jackson. Wait, it's not racist that I dreamt that right?"
than earlier. At that point, Steve realized he should probably be doing something to bring down the fever, so he went into the bathroom, soaked a cloth with cold water, and pressed it to Tony's forehead. It wasn't much, and it probably did little to help, but at least it was something.
Thanks to Balletgrl046 for leaving kudos and bookmarking, along with kagsfan on AO3! I hope you both have a happy holiday! :)
By the time Tony made his way to the bridge, the rest of Fury's rag-tag team of misfits had already gathered in the bridge; Natasha, Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner, and Steve… Tony tried his best to keep his frustration with Steve off his mind, but it was rather hard to do that when he was looking right at the man. Luckily, Bruce was discussing what Loki and his cohorts were up to with the cube, so it was easy for him to distract himself with something more important.
"See you there," Coulson said with a nod before heading off into the ship's main cabin. Natasha started walking in the other direction and gestured with a small jerk of her head that Steve should follow her.
While he waited for the call to be transferred, Rhodey checked Tony over again. His pulse was still slow and his head still warm. Despite that, Tony did not look any worse for wear. In fact, one could easily mistake him for being in a very deep sleep. However, that was not the case. Tony could be in danger and whether he did that to himself or not didn't matter. Tiberius Stone was responsible for this. Of that, Rhodey was certain.
"Because it's been three months and you have yet to hire a new one," Pepper explained. "Plus, I believe it's in my contract that I can pick my successor."
"How well do you know Captain Danvers?" Tony raised an eyebrow to the question but didn't even bother to think about arguing over its legitimacy.
"Tony, you know that's a one-way trip…" The shock in Steve's voice was palpable. Still, that didn't deter Tony. As scared as he might be, this is what needed to be done. Still he couldn't bear to hear Steve's voice for even a second longer. He didn't want to hear Steve's pain once he was gone.
"Aunt Peggy told me." Just like that, all the air drained from the room. That had to be a lie. It couldn't be his Peggy. She would never betray him like that.
Hope everyone's enjoying the longest day of the year. Personally, I'm more excited about tomorrow. Pray for the Wicked and the Sims 4 Seasons both come out tomorrow and I'm going to be babysitting my six-month-old cousin who is the definition of adorable, so I can't wait! Also, there's something you probably can't wait for what's going to happen tomorrow... Ooo, you better get excited!
a sedative!" the woman said. "It's a form of anesthetic, more commonly used on animals than on people!" Rhodey's heart dropped at the words.
"I'm going to be fine." Natasha opened her mouth to reprimand his use of the f-word, but Clint beat her to it. "Ah, ah," he said. "I said 'going to be' that implies that I plan to be in the future, not denying that I'm not fine now." The corners of Nat's lips raised into a smirk.
"I understand what you're doing and why you're doing it," he said carefully, still trying to figure out exactly what he was doing. "If the situation were different, I'd be right with you."
He immediately took off towards the portal, hoping he could do something to stop the Chitauri soldiers before they made it to the ground and started hurting civilians. Although, yes, the streets were mostly empty, there were still a few stragglers and gawkers about plus the massive police presence down below. Not to mention the reporters out to get their fill of blood and guts in living color… With those lives at stake, Tony knew he had to either contain this ASAP or at least buy them enough time to at least start running for their lives if he couldn't.
"We're done," she confirmed. Tony stood up and started to take off his microphone. Everhart, meanwhile, turned back to look at Freeman and Lara.
Eventually, Oswin made that last left and ended up in front of a set of steel double-doors labeled "Chem. Lab 1."
Running his fingers across the cool tile floor beneath him, Tony couldn't help but wonder what the hell was wrong with him. It's not like he wanted to be like this. He wanted to be able to sleep through the night, but he just couldn't. Even having Steve by his side didn't seem to do anything to help. All that he found that's helped was using alcohol to numb himself. He knew that wasn't healthy. He knew that if he wasn't careful, this could turn into an addiction, but it was keeping him disconnected to what happened. If he could stay disconnected from what happened, he could make it through the day. That's at least what he told himself.
"Oh, she said softly enough not to wake Tony, but loud enough for Steve to be able to hear her. "You're awake."
It was only eight o'clock at night, but Steve was at a loss for what to do. He was wide awake and couldn't focus on reading the files anymore. He would go and do something else, but apparently, he was only allowed to be on this floor. The door to the stairs was locked and every time he tried to go down in the elevator, it just stayed in place with the doors wide open. He also hadn't seen a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent all day. He supposed they were trying to give him space to adjust, but Steve was finding it more frustrating than helpful.
"No, Loki," was Odin's only response. So, without any fear, sorrow, or hesitation, Loki let go of the staff, all the while with Thor begging him to stop. He couldn't be stopped, though. He fell slowly into the dark void of space, keeping his eyes on pretend sibling and parent until he felt himself being pulled into the twisted vortex created by the destruction of the Bifrost.
By the end of it, though, he still didn't know what was wrong with him. Dr. Wayne and the nurses with no explanation or even the slightest indication as to what was ailing him. In a way, that was distressing, but in the end, it was what he had wanted all along. As he had thought to himself earlier, Laura and the kids didn't know, so he wasn't going to know either. Although now he might be finding it at lease somewhat frustrating, it was still fair. The rest of the situation, however, was becoming less so.
Loki fought against the pain and lifted his right arm to his abdomen. Struggling for a second to find his voice, he whispered the familiar words of a healing spell. He knew in his weakened state, trying to use magic to heal himself would counterintuitive given that it would drain all his energy, causing him to pass out again, but at the same time, if he didn't heal himself he'd just be a sitting duck. The pain running down his spine started to fade, as did his perception of reality.
"Unnecessary? It's keeping you alive!" Lara shook her head. "They're crazy if they're not going to cover you because of that."
I'd just like to take a moment and just ask you all to pray for my computer's soul. It keeps having all these boot errors and I don't know how to fix it.
believe in such false profits, sir." The taller man's tone held deep conviction as well as sharp notes of lividity.
Tony buried his face in Steve's neck and didn't look at anything the entire way up to the apartment. He just breathed in Steve's natural scent and slowly felt himself slipping into unconsciousness. That was until he felt himself being placed down on something soft. Waking up, he realized Steve was lowering him onto a bed –
"Why were you in such a rush anyway?" Maria asked. "I mean, you shot out of here like a bat out of hell."
Tony studied the man's features closely. This time, it was completely undeniable that this man was Steve Rogers – or his look-alike clone, but Tony's mind didn't want to go down that rabbit hole of possibilities right now. He stared at the other man's face in complete disbelief. As if to make sure what he was seeing was real Tony reached out a finger and touched Steve's cheek. His skin felt ice cold and his eye twitched in reaction to the touch. Tony pulled his hand back so quickly you would have thought he burned it.
"Yeah," Margot said. "Like when we first got married. Remember that? You looked so handsome that day. I felt like I was the luckiest girl on Earth."
The fourth and final time Tony woke up that morning, he was clutching his own ears and begging for the pain to stop. There was a loud, high pitched noise coming from somewhere in his room and Tony's eyes desperately sought out the source.
Tony wasn't sure why he was doing this. It wasn't like he'd ever met the man before or knew anything about him. Well, that's not true. He knew what others had told him about Steve Rogers, but that wasn't the same as knowing the man himself, especially when you considered the high pedestal that Howard Stark put Captain America on.
"No," Tony said. "You grabbed me and dragged me out of there! If the roles were reversed, you would be screaming assault!" He didn't know what it was he said, but Lara went completely pale and it looked like she started shaking a bit.
"Hate to say this, but I'm kind of on limited time here," she said. "Can you get on your computer and look up where the closest bus station is to Avengers Tower?"
"He's asleep," Fury said. "He's still not showing the same signs as Drew, though, so I think we can say that Dr. Smith is right." Carol nodded.
"You're kidding me, right?" Bergeron shook his head. "You don't honestly believe that this girl has powers, do you?"
early in the morning?" Steve questioned. "Are they crazy or is early morning drinking acceptable now in the twenty-first century?"
got cleared to come off bedrest. You still aren't cleared for field duty or even to be out in the public."
"Tony, it's your turn." Tony glanced down at the letters in his tray. All he had were the letters O, T, T, O, I and an extremely cluttered board to work with. If "K-I" was considered a word, maybe…
"I'm not that great at judging what's safe and healthy…" he admitted. "If I was, I probably wouldn't be in this situation in the first place."
"Casse couille." Lara feigned offense. Tony ignored her and turned back towards the bedroom. "If I must get ready now, can I at least wake up Steve? He'll make the process so much more enjoyable."
"Certainly." The television then changed from an image of Johnny smiling insanely as he killed the last police officer, to one of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent once again trying to rip the elevator's control panel off the wall. About four other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that Lara could see had joined him as well, likely having come out of the woodworks while Lara was being attacked. She was twice as grateful that she hit the button for the doors when she did.
"That's easy," he said. "I want everything." He could hear Tony inhale sharply and go stiff, but still, he continued. "I want
Is it possible to get sun poisoning even if you weren't in the sun that long, like ten minutes at the most? Not the right place to ask this, I know, but I feel like I'm going to pass out and that's the only questionable thing I've done in the past few days, otherwise there's no explanation and answers would be appreciated, thank you.
"No." The force with which Hill gave her answer was frightening. Any S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who heard that would have instantly backed off and dropped the issue. Tony wasn't a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
"Tony Stark." Steve's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Name ring any bells?" It did, but he wasn't sure how. For some reason, his mind was foggy, and his memory was cloudy.
"No." Although, yes, he did recognize that Lara did need to apologize for grabbing him, he knew he probably shouldn't force her to do it now. She looked scared when he walked in and probably didn't need to be pushed like that.
"Still, you couldn't have grabbed one of those paper crowns on your way out?" The agent rolled his eyes and walked away. Tony thanked his retreating form before turning and moving back over to the window that overlooked the interrogation room.
"Seriously, though," Banner said, even though he was smiling, too. "Only do it if you feel up to it. If you want to rest, that's fine, too. We'll leave you alone." Clint shook his head.
Steve and Tony have made amends, and just in time, too! Loki is about to make his move and the Avengers need to come together before it's too late!
"Water under the bridge, so long as she doesn't do it again," Steve's mother assured. "We better get going, though.
"You're right about that," she remarked. Clint found himself looking down as well, his thoughts trickling back to Coulson's death again. Needing to change the subject to something else – anything else – he just brought up the first thing to come to mind.
"Yes," Tony said. "I'm not drunk. I know what I'm asking. I'm just sick and tired and don't want to be alone."
Yeah, as I write the author's note to this chapter, I'm currently writing Chapter Twenty-Six, which makes me nervous... I like having chapters finished ahead of time because I know how frustrating it can be to have to wait for an author to get their shit together to post a new chapter. I'm going to apologize in advance as if I do end up catching up with myself, then it might get a little frustrating waiting for me to put out chapters. Hopefully, that won't come to pass, though.
"I don't agree with him," Romanoff said. "I'm just saying he has a point. The public perception of the Avengers is probably already bad given that we skipped yesterday. Missing the State of the Union… We might not recover from that."
"Pleasure to meet you." It was clear that she was only saying that to be polite as she extended her hand out for him to shake.
The drive out to Newark felt longer than it should have. It was supposed to be one hour, but to Natasha it felt more like ten years. Her thoughts were mostly on Laura and the kids. Although she, Clint, and Laura had all planned for what to do if Clint was killed on a mission, planning for it and carrying it out were two different things. None of them could prepare for that hurt. They liked to pretend they could, but the truth was it was impossible.
Clint was fine as he stood from the table and left the room – or at least he acted like it. He started to falter a bit as they walked through the kitchen and by the time they were out into the hallway, he was leaning against the wall for support. Natasha rolled her eyes and quickly tried to slip under his arm to try to support him.
"True," Tony said. "So why don't we ask the person whose call it is?" Tony turned to Steve, who was still mostly supporting his weight. "Steve, do you want to go with the nice S.H.I.E.L.D. lady…" Steve took notice of how blatantly the redhead rolled her green eyes. "…or do you want to help me sneak out of the hospital, sneak back in, and watch the law of averages slowly kill me?"
"No, no." Adoniram shook his head. "Don't worry about that. I have a new job lined up for you and trust me, it will have you doing good work for the Church."
A new religious movement has taken advantage of the Battle of New York as a means to spread its influence and gain members, but what does this mean for the Avengers?
"Oh, you poor thing!" she exclaimed. "Come here and get kisses. You deserve kisses." Lara then started smooching the top of the dog's head. The dog didn't seem like he was suffering in the least.
"Save it," he said. "Just don't talk to me and we won't have any problems." He then increased his pace to get ahead of her. Natasha frowned.
It was clear that the Other had some sort of connection to the gem. That's how Loki had been psychically pulled in to the conversation, and he could imagine that was how the other was able to harm him even though he was only a mere illusionary image. That… Loki didn't even want to think about all the horrible scenarios that could go along with such a thought. Instead, he got up and got back to work. His plan was far from being completed and he would get nothing accomplished if he just sat on his ass all day.
"Oh?" Before Carol could press him further, the elevator chimed and the doors slid open. The two of them stepped inside and Tony hit the button for the security floor. Once they were moving, Carol looked at him expectantly. "Well, I'm all ears." Tony took a deep breath.
"I don't think anything here is big enough," Steve said. "This whole suite is too small. He'd stick out like a sore thumb."
However, before that happens I should also let you know that I'm going to be taking another hiatus. It's not going to be as big as last time! Let me assure you of that! I'm just not going to be posting in November or December because even with the pandemic going on, I still have a lot going on other priorities around that time that take precedence, and I know I won't be able to write fast enough to keep up with posting. As of right now, I'm writing chapter forty-nine and I almost have all of January covered, so things are looking up. The last chapter that's going to be released before I go on hiatus again will be chapter forty-four on October 28th. So don't worry, we still have plenty more stories to go before we have to go on pause! Look forward to that!
Steve went straight into the bathroom and started looking to see if there was any place Tony could be hiding. The cabinet under the sink was too small and the bathtub was clearly empty. Unless he figured out a way to climb to the ceiling and camouflage himself as part of the stucco, he wasn't in there. However, he did find a reason to hold out hope.
"If we just left it at that, then we wouldn't be here, now would we?" Lara knew Dante wasn't listening anymore, but it just felt
"They're vintage," Natasha said. "He's very proud." Steve, didn't know how to respond to that, but luckily this time he caught sight of another familiar face in the crowd of S.H.I.E.L.D. airmen and agents. Albeit, one that he hadn't met before.
"I get that she's upset," Steve said. "I would be, too, if it were you, but I feel like she just took it too far. I get that she and Barton are as close as family and I get that she just lost Coulson, but it doesn't mean you respond like that."
"Well, I kind of wanted answers." That came out much slower and groggier than Steve wanted it to. "Still do…"
"I'm sorry, Nick," Tony said turning the holographic screen around to reveal a schematic that was in the Phase Two file. It very clearly a weapon that looked very similar to the Hydra gun Steve had set down on the table. "What were you lying?" Fury's posture straightened, and his one eye was wide as he looked at the schematic.
They hadn't said everything that needed to be said, but it was a start. The start of what, Tony wasn't sure, but it was enough for now. They could hold each other in silence and be at peace. After the morning they had, they deserved it.
"Sir, you're aware that most pharmaceutical medications become inert after the expiration date, meaning that it is going to be ineffective in treating your flu-like symptoms."
"Because in the altered report, my comments about Stark's mental health were removed," Natasha said. "I thought that by bringing the matter to your attention not only would you look into possible issues within the agency, but you would also heed my advisories and get Stark the help he needed."
"Not a phone." That was the best answer he could come up with, because God only knew what kind of high-tech communication devices Carol owned. It was probably only something he could create in his wildest dream's wildest dream.
"I could hear you over the comms, honey," Tony said. "You were, in fact, gaping, but then again who wouldn't? None of us has seen anything like that before. Well, other than Thor, since apparently giant birds are common wherever he's from."
The four Avengers started making their way to the south-west stairwell. It was eerily quiet when they stepped inside, as it would be since they were the only ones using it. Clint's mind filled the silence by tallying the moments he likely had left to live. Unsurprisingly, it came out to be far too few.
"What can I say. I don't hold back." Her mouth tasted sour from the venom she had to keep out of those words.
Oh yes, Tony noticed as soon as she set the paper down in front of him. There were some cells that maintained the normal, rigid, round look, but the majority were elongated and amorphous in shape. He almost immediately knew what this was.
A war to formed within Steve; part of him wanted to help Tony get better, and the other part wanted to protect him no matter what. It was chaos, and all he could do was hold Tony tighter as the debate raged on in his head. It was so intense that Steve almost missed the door.
Taking in that information, Natasha calculated how to proceed. Even without the board meeting, there were a lot of things they needed to discuss. She knew where she wanted to start but bringing it up in the correct way was going to be the hard part. Stark had shut down all her previous attempts to discuss the issues they had, and he was liable to do so again. She wanted to have an open, adult, and overall amicable conversation with him and to do so, she had to approach the topic carefully.
"Actually, if you were having a heart attack, you'd be more likely to go completely unresponsive." Tony wished Lara were not sitting on the floor so he could shoot her a proper glare. He could settle for sarcasm, though.
"Probably," Stark said. "But I'm afraid if I kill myself now, my ghost would be doomed to haunt this room without entertainment forevermore."
Tony didn't need to enter the override code again as Happy had his key. It took a few moments for the elevator to reach the penthouse as it was ten floors above them. In those few moments, Lara managed to slump against the wall and fall asleep. When it stopped, Happy had to lift her into a fireman's carry while Tony led them to the first-floor guest room. He held the door open for Happy as he carried Lara inside and placed her down on the bed. She didn't stir and both Happy and Tony were careful to be as quiet as possible as they left the room and shut the door.
trilogy on DVD, but she was grateful for it. Otherwise, she'd have nothing to keep her entertained until he got back.
"Knežević," she amended. "I'm sorry but this is clearly not a suitable home for two children to be living in."
"You gonna give me a lift?" Clint turned to Tony and asked. Tony walked over and grabbed him by the quiver.
"Hey, you got yourself into this mess!" Knežević shouted. "I didn't hold a gun to your head and tell you to rob that place! You did it yourself! Hell, you were stealing shit long before I came across you! Something was bound to happen eventually!"
For a moment, he pondered the idea of going to sleep. However, a little voice in the back of his head reminded him that falling asleep when you might have hypothermia wasn't a good idea. Something about dying in your sleep…? He wasn't sure, but it was enough for him to force himself to keep his eyes from drooping shut. A few moments later, Salinas reappeared. He had two blankets draped over his arm (one of which was the same shade of blue as Steve's uniform, which made the corners of Tony's lips rise a little bit), a pair of slippers and a pair of socks in one hand and a glass of water in the other. Salinas put the water down on the coffee table and handed him the blankets.
"Two-hundred miles with a dog and a guy with a hangover," Lara said. "I'd rather drive to Vermont and back with a sick kid."
"It's just JARVIS; an AI," Tony quickly corrected before moving on to the more pressing issue. "Did Pepper say anything else before you left?"
"Why?" As bad as he felt for Tony, Rhodey could have smacked him right then and there for asking such a stupid question.
What still wasn't clear though was the connection to Winnifred "Oswin" Oswald. There were many reasons to just write off the happenstance of her house being blown up off as a coincidence – the most outstanding one being that Oswin was illegally squatting in the building. It very easily could be that Knežević had forced her out of the home, or worse killed her, and no one would be the wiser.
Tony, however, wasn't having it. As soon as Steve started lowering him onto the bench, Tony started resisting, pushing Steve away and attempting to stand up.
"I have to agree with Mr. Schaffer," the man to the right of Schaffer – Marvin Weinstein – said. "After all, who knows who this mysterious thief was and where they got the access codes. For all we know, it could have been an employee."
"Yes," Adoniram said. "But placing him with them would arouse suspicion. Besides, we shouldn't be tempting the women into breaking their chastity vows. Also, isn't the phrase 'keep you friends close and enemies closer?" Salinas raised an eyebrow.
"Okay," he said. "I understand." Truly accepting that would take much longer, though, but Betty seemed to understand that.
"Of course, you don't," Romanoff said. "But if you're drowning your trauma in alcohol, you're obviously not completely fine mentally or otherwise."
Clint's gaze went to the vinyl divider that separated him and Stark. He couldn't see through it, but he knew Stark was on the other side. That served to make things a little less creepy. At least there would be a witness if the doctors decided that he was beyond the point of saving and they might as well take his organs while they were fresh. (
"Ah," Thor said. "I understand now. So, since the people of Earth lack a dedicated avian species to ride, they construct these metal sky birds to take them from one destination to another."
"Not that far," she said. "Like Cabe said, she pulled him offstage before he could do any serious damage."
"Alright," Rawls said. "I'll leave you to change into your hospital gown. A nurse should be in to take your blood shortly."
"Seriously," Tony said. "If you want to talk about anything – it doesn't even have to be what's bothering you – just anything you want to talk about, I'm all ears. We still have two hours to kill." Tony saw the expression on Steve's face change to one of contemplation before moving to arrange himself, so he was comfortable again.
"Okay," Stark said as he set down his glass. "Let us say I believe you. You truly had my mental health and safety as your first concern. Why the hell did you let that party escalate like that? Don't try saying that you were drunk, too, because we both know that's bull crap." Natasha sighed.
