Tony raised himself on his toes and pressed a kiss to Steve. “I’ll see you when I get back home?” Tony questioned hesitantly. Even though they had just shared a kiss, Tony knew all too well how things could change quickly.
“You all created a royal fucking mess, you know that?” Fury exclaimed in a voice so low that was bridled with anger. “It’s like you all just decided to see how much we can screw things up and had a contest.”
When the meetings began, Pepper only briefly participated in the shenanigans Rhodey and Pepper were a part of. The rest of the day consisted of meetings, setting up meetings, Tony making sure things were meeting their deadlines in R&D. At some point Tony had broken away from Pepper and went down to the lab and she wouldn’t have even noticed until FRIDAY alerted her that Tony had set something…correction three things on fire.
“Well, I remember one time I came home to Tony sporting a bruise on his cheek and Howard telling him that Captain America would disapprove of Tony running rampant through the town doing as he pleased. And then he said Captain American would have done far worse to discipline him, he wouldn’t take that type of attitude from his fellow soldiers.”
“Yes, webbing it up,” Tony replied. “Your Aunt May started using it and well it caught on. So if you get up to webbing it up, make sure you at least tell APRIL to let me make sure you are okay. And if you happen to stumble over something…”
Tony hummed. “Yes, you can bring your little girlfriend and your band of science geeks…hey no offense I myself hold that title with honor. Okay, now seriously do your homework kid. Alright yes…mhmm…yeah you too. Good night,” Tony said before handing the phone up.
“Get off of me,” Tony rasped making his body rise from its lying position. “You should go now, before you get in trouble.”
Then he added, “Sorry, if my face is screaming murder. It’s not directed toward you at all. It’s directed to that fucking asshole who I’m pretty certain, when I…its definitely not directed to you sweetheart, never to you.”
“Yeah, literally all love up until the day after. Like a few hours pass and it’s like he keeps growing distant.”
Tony growled and pushed her away. “I don’t need you to check my wounds. I need you to get me the hell out of here or hell just show me how to get out okay. I don’t need you placating me or treating me nicely because you may not be on the same level as your fucked up sister, but you sure aren’t helping me. I need to get out of here. Come on Cali you have to see this isn’t right.”
Bucky by then had entered the den. Now Steve and Bucky were standing opposite of one another. Natasha had also stood up behind Steve. Now Steve was in the middle of the two. His breathing grew haggard and his head was spinning.
Steve reached over and snatched a piece of Tony’s funnel cake before popping it into his mouth. Tony’s eyes widened and his mouth opened and closed as though trying to figure out a response to it. Steve made motions to take another piece, but Tony was prepared this time. He held his plate away from Steve.
Next chapter will be a little time jump (or if you people want to know what Steve does to Ryder, I guess I can add that chapter in before the time jump *wink* just comment and let me know.)
“You…you promised no marks that would be visibly. You pr-promised,” Tony said rising from his curled position to look angrily at Ryder.
“Then he would take his clothes off, pretty fast. You’d watch on amused because he looks like some eager little puppy. Then he’d ask you if you were sure again. After that he’d probably spread you apart real nice,” Ryder further explained sliding his hands down Tony’s legs and spreading them.
Steve shrugged sheepishly. He grabbed a skillet and placed it on the stove. Reaching into the refrigerator he grabbed a stick of butter and cut a square. He turned the burner on and placed the butter on the stove. Then he turned to where Bucky was adding some salt into the water.
Steve rocked forward, pitching Tony down lower onto him. “Well, I’m already in the lead. And I’m not known for falling behind.”
Tony immediately grew pale and his eyes dimmed slightly. He swallowed a lump in his throat and turned toward Miles, refusing to meet any of their eyes. He opened his mouth to say an equally stinging retort, but figured he just couldn’t…not today.
His breath hitched and the fingers tracing circles on Steve’s knee stopped its movement. He fought hard to stop the string of memories now rushing to his head. He wanted to stop the associated pain gnawing in his heart. He didn’t want to go there. He turned his face into Steve’s chest, a certain sense of nervousness settling in his chest.
“You know you can’t take this away from me, right?” Bucky said with a completely straight expression.
Natasha swung Julie onto her hip. “Of course I can. Besides our group will be the best. And I can teach you all how to sight if anyone has rigged the games, so you can appropriately decide the next course of action,” she whispered to them.
Tony looked up at Steve once more before opening the box. In the box laid a thin silver bracelet. The silver bracelet was a simple silver band with markings engraved in them. The markings are set in a smooth design outlined by the silver. With the marked engravings were pieces of sapphire interwoven with it. Tony marveled at the bracelet and watched as moonlight caught on some words engraved within the bracelet.
Tony blinked his eyes rapidly, trying and failing to keep the moisture from clinging to his eyelashes.
“I said the future not the present. Get some sleep Steve. And look over the document. If you need to talk more or confess your undying love for Tony come to me,” Natasha said hoping to light the feeling in the room.
But now here Tony was looking at Miles’ bedroom that was distinctly missing a little boy’s presence. His bed was still made and the nightlight in his room was nowhere to be found. He entered the room in hurried paces. There was no reason Miles should have
Natasha stood up straighter, thankful that she had the support of Sam and Bucky. Going into this, she thought she would have been arguing with Steve alone. She would have made him see reason and his mistakes, but it was nice going in with backup.
“I can’t say that it wouldn’t bother me that you wouldn’t want to talk to us, but at the end of the day this concerns you. And if you don’t think that telling us will make you feel better…or help you recover then you don’t have to tell us in order to appease our wanting to know what happened to you.”
“Are you quite finished?” Isa questioned eyes becoming alight with fire. Her posture straightened and she focused all of her attention toward Steve.
“Because if a man followed you out of retirement, he would follow your instructions to just be quiet,” Natasha rasped. “Tell him to stop.”
Steve paled, when he realized that Isak…Ryder was getting sexual satisfaction from this. He picked up on the dilated eyes and the breaths coming in harsh pants as his eyes greedily soaked in the bruises littered on Tony’s tan skin. His mouth parted and his tongue stuck out to tease at the bottom lip.
“Sure, golden boy. I’m sure you just have a dark side waiting to pop out. Let me guess, it’s like the little grumpy in
A women’s voice echoed in Karen’s office. “Oh, Evan he sounds wonderful. We’ve been wanting to adopt for so long and now that this is finally happening.”
Sure, he commented him on his body, but after seeing at sometimes made Steve uncomfortable, because for Steve the experiment had still only happened a short while ago and he was having trouble adjusting, Tony had begun complementing him other ways.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Okay, no clearly mine is the best. Okay, I even added a little tiny Iron Man.”
Steve said thank you once more, before wishing that Mr. Moore enjoyed the rest of his day and he left.
“He’s fine, but he’s a little shaken up. It would probably do him some good to see you right now though,” Natasha said. “I did promise him that I would send him to you and your kid takes promises seriously.”
Tony’s breathe caught and he wiped at his eyes, vision in front of him going blurry and he didn’t want one moment of this picture of family to be wasted. His eyes cleared and it centered again on everyone in here not a moment of love lost between anyone.
Steve’s head bobbed up and down on Tony’s cock. He took a moment to look sparingly at Tony, eyes growing brighter with mischief.
Peter steeled Ryder with a heavy gaze, not bringing notice to Harley walking behind him. “Is there a problem?” Harley implored looking at the tension resting heavy on Peter’s shoulders.
“Let us handle things, okay punk. We’ll get her to speak whether she wants to or not,” Bucky claimed.
Or would he wrap him up in and towel and speak softly to him as he usually did when he had those waterboarding sessions?
Steve tried to manfully stifle the coo he wanted to make at the adorable tired expression. He notably failed, when a quick awe slipped his lips and Tony raised one eyebrow artfully at him in response.
Both were uncaring to the bullet wound making a gaping hole in Ryder’s side. Neither did they care also for the strangled gasp that gurgled out of Ryder’s throat as his body reeled with the impact. He reached forward and pressed three fingers into the wound, watching as the skin gave way and stretched painfully.
When they reached the bedroom, Steve first took Tony’s shoes off and then placed him under the covers. He looked at his face void of any pain and felt a warmth settle nicely in his heart. He hadn’t had the chance to look at him like this since the time they went to Clint’s house and had to spend the night together.
There were a few more voices that were muffled in the background. Steve’s voice traveled back in his ears.
Bekah sniffed and wiped at her nose that was beginning to run. “I know and that’s what makes this so hard. I…Steve I love my kid unconditionally. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do for my children. But at the end of the day, when I leave this hospital and go home…I’m going to feel empty.”
“Look man, you are noble as your Captain America title suggests, so do the noble thing and let me go. You have no proof. You refuse to bring Tony in here to back me up. He spent the most time with him so he should know. So I don’t know what it is that my brother has you so infatuated with him-”
He hadn’t talked to Ryder, since then. He didn’t even talk to him, when he found out that Ryder was the reason that he had been denied admission into all of the universities he applied to, resulting in him having to go to community college.
Steve’s anger grew with each growing second, just thinking about what all Tony had to grow through. The anger continued to hit him like harsh tidal waves, until Tony sat up so his eyes were directly in Steve’s line of vision.
The voice laughed then quieted. “Well dear let the time of the Starks’ control over our lives end fairly soon.”
“You’re always so good for me. I love how you trust me so easily, trust me to take care of you,” Ryder whispered into his neck.
Sam was always the one sitting at Tony’s desk, reading through the various books that Tony had scattered around his room. Sam noted with great fascination that Tony had a list of books that could rival his own back home. He had made it a mission back then to read as many as he could, so that when Tony came back they could have conversations about it, maybe grow in their own friendship.
“He accidentally scratched his thumb on one of his toys. Now I know why those toys have those little hazard warnings,” Harley muttered as he wrapped the Band-Aid on Miles’ finger. “Alright there you go kid.”
“Look Mr. Rogers my boss hasn’t been able to get a good sleep in forever. Between dealing with the effects of the war between you all, the Accords, dealing with the board of executives at SI, becoming a father, and having to get ready for all the holiday functions…he’s been running haggard,” Peter explained.
“I know,” Bucky said cheekily. “But seriously where is the resident genius, seeing as though he isn’t here with you right now?”
Tony trailed off on this rambling of better juices, until his phone went off. He looked at it quickly and typed a response, before placing it back into his back pocket. He took the bowl from Steve’s offered hand. Steve didn’t want to pry, but he also wanted to know who had texted him that made his face scrunch up for a few seconds before smoothing out its expression.
Steve kissed Miles on the cheek. “Indeed, you will always be our bambino. Forever and always. Now I guess, I’ll seriously go before-”
They surveyed the parameters of the location where the driver always dropped off whoever he was called to drive. From there they had about 600 mile radius to narrow done. Their weapons were drawn and their plan was set. It was time to find Tony and damn anyone who tried getting in their way.
Bucky looked at Steve concernedly as Steve tightly grasped his phone. Pepper shook her head as Steve asked if she got news on Tony.
There’s a second, where Tony gave Steve a chance to say something. There was no verbal statement on Tony’s part, but it was implied. Steve pursed his lips into a thin line and staves off the innate yearning to get on his knees and plead that Tony forgive him for this.
“Before Peter, Ben and I were trying to have kids. We miscarried once, and nothing anyone said was of much help, but I read this thing one day…it said that even though they were gone, some of the fetus’s cells would always be inside me. That I was…I was changed forever because we had shared a body even for a short time.” The breath she inhaled then cut its way into her lungs, because no matter how many years go by, breathing in the reality of that loss will always tear at her insides. But she’s grateful, in a way, to be able to share this with Tony, another person who has lost a child in a way that’s invisible to the rest of the world. “The people we love change us, Tony. I get that in your case that’s turned up by a few dozen notches. But what you shared with that Peter will always be a separate thing from what you have with this version of him. Letting your partners connect with him will never touch it. Nothing will touch it, because the two of you changed each other forever.”
“…err, Mr Rogers? There was some kids TV guy named Mr. Rogers, wasn’t there? Come to think of it you two have a very similar energy. I mean he spent less time punching out bad guys and more time hanging out with his neighbours, but still. You both cultivate a kind of goodness that would be sickening if it weren’t so obviously sincere. Oh come on, the name Rogers is starting to not even sound like a word anymore…Cap? Captain America? Look, if you’re waiting for me to do a swooning thing—”
“Of course you can come, Peter. You told me to never talk to you about anything remotely related to SHIELD, and this technically falls under that category. Plus I figured you had enough going on, fixing things with your aunt and your friends. I assumed more social stuff would be the opposite of what you wanted.”
The problem came when they trooped back into the house. Almost everyone took a shower (even Steve, who annoyingly didn’t look like he’d ever had so much as a drop of sweat on him), and while most of them did so in pairs or threes to 'save water', it was still past noon by the time they were all finished. Which meant lunch. And Tony so, so was not ready to have to deal with food again so soon.
“A form of tantric massage. The external prostate massage—the way I touched you right near the end, there—it’s very common for it to bring on some pretty intense emotions.”
.” He knew he was verging on pleading, but Steve had managed to get through the rest of this, somehow, without taking it back and begging Tony to stay. That was all he felt anyone could reasonably ask of him, he felt.
This proved to be a more challenging instruction than Tony would have guessed. He was immediately confronted with the purple kneeling pillow, nestled invitingly in the corner, but he still felt oddly reluctant to give away how much kneeling had already come to mean to him when things were just starting out. But if not there, then where? A chair might make Clint think he was avoiding the option of being touched, but the couch might make it seem like Tony was pushing himself on Clint…He stood motionless in the centre of the room until an amused huff sounded from behind him, where Clint stood holding two bottles of water and a small black duffle bag that he must have come up with.
It was midmorning at SHIELD, and Tony was in Steve’s office again. Steve himself was not working on their project on account of being on an incredibly tedious conference call, but Tony (who had not even offered to leave for said phone call) was in his usual spot on the couch.
But there had been a sense of anticipation building in Tony all day. It had been clear from fairly early on that they intended to have him scene with the entire team; Rhodey’s presence made that particularly clear. He needed to know, like an itch underneath his skin, how they’d planned for this to end.
when I have Natasha waiting for me downstairs. You need to take someone down. You’re no used to us half-alive from prolonged dom-dep. Denying yourself headspace ain’t gonna bring him back, not to mention it’s about the last damn thing Tony would have wanted.”
“Dionne Brand, huh? I’m impressed. Her later stuff is great, but a little more provincial. This one really captures the global scope of the post-colonial experience.”
“After the press conference?” He confirmed the guess with a short nod. “The tailors are coming by in fifteen minutes, we don’t have enough time to get into this now I suppose. Meet me tonight, fill me in on the details?” He hesitated, and her gaze narrowed. "I’ve had enough surprises from you for several lifetimes, Tony, you owe me this at least.”
Whether from embarrassment about having her love-affair with Italian food exposed, or for some other reason, Pepper had quickly shifted the conversation at that point, and Tony had considered the matter dropped until he’d been in the kitchen loading the dishwasher.
Gradually the team trickled up to join him, and Tony did his best to feign some level of normalcy while they ate greasy take-out and watched a Pixar movie marathon that had been Natasha’s surprising choice. (It was, at least, far better than spending the time immediately following a battle alone.) After a while, though, he started to notice two things. The first was that Phil never joined them. While a little disheartening, this was not altogether surprising; from what Tony now understood of the handler position, the bulk of Coulson’s work typically took place in the before and after of a fight. What was surprising, though, was the fact that one additional member of the team kept vanishing, only to reappear and send another teammate . There was little predictable about the how, or why, or when of it; they were gone for varying lengths of time, and though there seemed to be a clear order to who departed when, it had apparently been decided long in advance since none of them spoke their intentions aloud. One by one someone would stand, wordlessly leave the room, and then return looking far more settled than when they had left.
“As I’ve said, there is no sex during check-ins. All we’re doing right now is ensuring that continued deprivation does not interfere with your health.” Bruce’s voice had never lost that even, smooth, professional tone he used during check-ins; if anything, he sounded a little more detached, like the fact that he was about to massage Tony’s prostate was just another task on a checklist he needed to complete. It was utterly humiliating and painfully, stupidly hot. “I’m going to insert the first finger now. The lubricant might feel a bit cold, but there should be no discomfort.”
When Tony entered Phil’s office, it wasn’t filled with its usual silence punctuated by the occasional scratch of pen on paper or quiet currents of air as Phil’s fingers flew over the keys of a holo-keyboard. There was a record player in the corner that Tony had never noticed before, and it was playing what he could swear was—
The though was cut short by a metal hand shooting into Steve’s field of vision. It crumpled the virtual document into a ball, just like a sheet of paper, and then made a throwing motion. The wadded-up hologram landed in a digital basketball hoop that immediately lit up and dinged obnoxiously. (Bucky had picked the gesture up from their Tony. Once he’d realized all the truly useless but entertaining things Tony had programmed his holograms to do, the two of them had spent weeks playing a series of silly and escalating games all over the tower, many of which Bucky hadn’t realized until long after the fact had also been designed to help him train and build up the dexterity of his then-new metal hand.)
1. Yes, Dr. Banner does provide check-ins to Switch members of the team. They are mandatory the morning following a scene where the Switch has been in a submissive headspace, and are held a minimum of once a fortnight
“Don’t you see that that’s better, though? You catch the things we miss, like with the kids. I mean, the concept of childhood as it exists now barely existed when I was young, especially if you were poor. And so many of the other people who work for SHIELD lost out on childhood for one reason or another; they don’t care about stripping that part of a recruit’s life away because it’s not something they ever had. But we can want more for the next generation than that, and you do. You always have.”
He didn’t have to keep his thoughts of mindless celebrity gossip much longer. Harley went toward him and motioned for him to stand up. Steve walked to him.
Bucky really prayed he didn’t drop this kid. Miles squirming to get away from him certainly hadn’t helped, but he was beginning to settle. He kept his eyes on Tony as though making sure he wouldn’t leave.
“You’re right and I don’t know yet. I haven’t been placed in a situation where I am met with returning. But at the end of the day, I was still built for that. I know how it feels to kill Steve and I don’t want you to have any remorse. Killing through revenge can be detrimental to your mind Steve. I just don’t want this to cost you.
He glared leeringly at him, once and then once more, the second glare looking just a bit too long on the point where Steve’s pulse thrummed underneath his neck. Bucky’s hands reflexively tightened on his gun. Clint moved forward two steps.
The corners of Bucky’s lips lifted slightly. Tony smiled widely. “Okay dark humor. I can get with that.”
His voice sounded gutted as though he was deeply impacted by the memory. Steve wondered how much was for show. He wondered if it was possible for Ryder to even demonstrate such a demonstration of blatant sadness.
“Miles Morales!” Tony shouted more so from earth shattering terror rather than anger. His immediate response was to walk toward the refrigerator and reach his hands out to the boy. Unfortunately, his height did factor in and he just had to choose the refrigerator that was too tall.
Clint and Bucky had settled on some Cake Wars show. Steve also became intrigued in the show and they all watched it with conversation filtered in on how they wondered if those cakes actually tasted good.
” she hints with eyes, eyes flickering to one person in particular so quick that no one could know who she directed that statement to. “Though I’m not sure of that anymore,” she whispered more to herself, than to the others.
“I’m sorry I have to take this,” Steve said looking down at the unknown number. Not too many people had access to his number so the few people that called him have to have called for a reason. Taking a chance, he answered the call.
But it had seemed that Miles had realized that perhaps Tony wouldn’t be leaving this time. The first night Miles hadn’t come to his bedroom, Tony went to go see if everything was okay. Miles had been in his bed, a coloring book laid upon his lap, and fast asleep. He had woken up a little after Tony had sat down on the edge of his bed. Miles had blearily looked at him, tossing aside Mr. Penguin in favor of climbing into Tony’s lap.
“You okay, Steve?” Tony questioned. “I know it’s a lot, so if you want to maybe cool things down a bit…I know you were like interested in me, but maybe knowing all of this you aren’t anymore, which is totally fine. ‘Cause hey I get it not everyone wants someone who…”
“For what it’s worth Rogers, I truly hope that you can heal everything that we’ve managed to break.”
“Exactly. You didn’t meant to. It wasn’t a conscious thing. It was unconscious,” Pepper realized, eyes widening with the realizations she just made. “Which means that somewhere deep inside of you all, you really think that Tony isn’t fit to do what he was doing long before the Avengers came along. You all collectively set out to blame him for anything wrong that happened due to the Avengers because you all never thought he deserved to be an Avenger. You all never trusted him.”
“I’m upset because my boyfriend’s been basically whoring himself out to the next available person, while I’ve been away,” Ryder hissed snapping his eyes to Tony.
Tony was like a brother to him. Sometimes he was the only one who was able to put forth as much energy to something as Clint did. Sure, they argued a lot, but it was never…well mostly it was never real anger. It was something shared between siblings, brothers. Clint remembered the many times Tony would come sit next to him, not talking, but knowing that Clint just enjoyed having another presence behind him. Tony knew how Clint didn’t like to always feel alone, because good things never happened when you were alone.
A tear fell down as he looked at his bags. He reached inside of one and took out a square box. Reaching inside he pulled out the bracelet that he had given Tony. He ran his hands over the smoothness of it.
Enjoy this chapter, while I run off to take my final on a Saturday...I repeat a final on a Saturday. It's safe to say professors just don't care.  But hey I have something to look forward to after I either pass/fail. I can reply to your comments from last chapter so yay!
Tony looked up at her from his spot on her lap and for a brief second his vision cleared. The chattering of his teeth broke up a few words, but Natasha was able to piece together, “Natasha? That…you’re here? You all finally came? Steve? Steve here?”
“Those two instances are not the same. Your brother did everything on his own. He was not manipulated into acting out criminal offenses,” Steve told him.
“Don’t do what?” Tony said, his expression clearing off. “I said a lot of things. Also don’t do things is pretty much like asking me to do something.”
“I don’t,” Tony said hoarsely. “I’ve asked you many times to go slower or not so hard. I’ve asked you not to hit me. I’ve told you that you’ve hurt me many times. And you keep
Steve rolled his eyes at the two, before bringing his attention back to Tony. “What to watch on TV. Bucky just turned on some show with…I don’t know what it is to be exact. But right now there’s this girl whining about how unfair it is that her sister thinks she can just take her clothes? I think? Oh wait…no someone…I think her mom is telling her that her sister can borrow her clothes, when she’s taken clothes from her mom? I’m confused. Why is this so important?”
The light coming from the lamps seemed to swirl in his vision. Miriam tossed that bottle aside and grabbed another one.
His mind filtered away from that image and he pressed a hand against his slowly hardening cock. He wished Tony was here. He had been gone a month with Miles, Pepper, and Rhodey. He hadn’t had a month to explore a “soft” side with Tony. But this month allowed him to practice. He took a few of his employees of the CMPNY and tried seeing how to be soft. Miriam had been a delightful study.
“It’s not a date,” Peter said bringing Tony back to their conversation. “My decathlon group is going to the movies.”
And Tony had feared there may have been a few out there who said he deserved it being the Merchant of Death and all.
Steve nodded and stood up. “And I’ll be the first you tell, when he arrives. I don’t want him anywhere near Tony. Don’t even mention his name.”
“I think you should concern yourself with finding a new place over wondering whether or not this spaghetti dinner was a date. Because I can ease those concerns right now,” Steve said standing up. “It was.”
Steve looked behind himself and turned to where Tony was pacing back and forth. One hand held the phone pressed to his ear and the other was gesticulating wildly in the air. Tony turned toward him and Steve raised an eyebrow. Tony faked a smile and then returned to his call.
“Look I know we have a lot to talk about, but I’m not ready to talk today. Plus I need to take care of a sick kid right now. So excuse me. I think you all should take today to get settled in. Your floors are pretty much the same. If you have complaints, let me know. And we’ll hash everything out like adults tomorrow.”
“And you thinking to yourself,” Ryder’s voice grew to a faint whisper, “whether you had gotten it all wrong.”
“Jack doesn’t let you stay with him?” Steve questioned, hoping that the boy wouldn’t mind this one interruption.
“No, but I’m getting close. I knew his daughter and she said he’s somewhere in Venezuela. I just need to narrow down on who’s sighted him, but hopefully it should be soon,” she said. “I have to go Ryder will be back soon. But thank you for talking to Tony.”
Clint waited for Tony to go back into the kitchen before following him. Clint excused himself stepping over Natasha’s leg and went into the kitchen. The sounds of Natasha and Steve debating over what to watch next came to a soft whisper as he walked away. Tony was gathering some more popcorn and he didn’t register Clint coming behind him until he turned around.
“Again may I remind you that Steve pushed his shield right into your chest and destroyed your arc reactor? And you think you love him,” Ryder said pushing against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony raised a hand to muffle his sob. Cali winced as she watched the tears stream down Tony’s face. Tony continued listening as Miles kept talking, imploring whether Tony would be home soon.
Fortunately, I have amazing friends that I can depend on who have helped me through this emotional time and I am so thankful for them. I am doing so much better and I am at a place mentally where I feel at peace.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
“Can’t I just plan a nice date without having to celebrate anything,” Steve questioned, guiding Tony by the waist to sit down. “Simply put it, I think you are always deserving of nice things that I am always willing to give.”
“I feel like I’m in some daytime soap opera. Nat make it stop, it’s giving me hives,” Clint said coming closer to them from where he had been setting up the candles.
Tony watched for a moment as Steve curled into the lingering warmth that Tony’s presence was leaving on the bed.
“You don’t have to,” Steve replied swallowing down his need to tell Tony how much he wanted to stay, how much he needed to stay. “Tony…you don’t have to get it.”
“Your baba will be sad if you don’t eat your food. He wants you to be big and strong too. Don’t make your baba cry,” Bucky sang picking up a grape and tossing it into the air.
“I thought we we’re meeting up at the front desk, but that’s okay. I ended a bit earlier so let’s leave now. Perhaps we can even still catch breakfast,” Ryder cutting Harley off and throwing an arm around Harley. “I have a car waiting for us outside, so we can go now.”
“It’s okay Tony. Miles is safe. He’s not hurt. He’s right here with you Tony okay. Look at him, nothing is broken,” Steve whispered into his ear. “He’s okay Tony. He’s okay.”
“Okay, just stay here then and don’t talk to strangers,” Steve told him, before walking toward Bekah’s room. When he arrived, Bekah was sitting up in her bed a tired, yet restful smile lighting up her pale features.
“But I both know you won’t. Your misfits know that you won’t. You know you won’t leave. And the times you tried, well…”
They saved him from that room and placed him in one just like it. Making up his mind, he tiredly pushed himself away from the pain and ignored the way his legs trembled. He was unsteady and he felt as though all at once tiny needles were being stabbed into every part of his body. His vision swam and he felt his head loll back.
“My, my captain. What would the people say about your language?” Tony croaked, laughing as Steve bit at the corner of his thigh. “And I’m completely fine with this plan of yours, but time is ticking.”
Tony tilted his head as he thought. He snapped his fingers and answered with a smile. “Yeah, he did actually. One day he gave me a granola and yogurt.”
One of Ryder’s hand kept still on Tony’s waist and the other pressed lightly against Tony’s neck. Tony pushed at both hands and Ryder looked at Tony directly in his eye and kept going. By then Tony couldn’t even say anything because he was trying to hold in that air to breathe. But eventually it was too much and Tony embraced the darkness like a welcomed comfort.
“You have two hours, before he heads to the Raft,” Natasha explained. “If you want to do what you planned, before he’s gone. I suggest you do it now.”
A nurse brought in an extra blanket and pillow. Steve felt for Tony’s hand and noted, displeasingly, the still cold nature of it. He placed the blanket on top of his jacket and leaned his head down to rest on the spot near Tony’s lap.
Mrs. Thompson sent a sympathetic glare to the two. “I mean if my family was like theirs I am certain that I would have to act out in some way as well.”
Oh…right. Shortly after that the whole things with the Accords, Civil War, him finding out about his parents, the whole course of things…Tony hadn’t taken time to actually get someone to fix the wall. In actuality, he had all the time in the world given as to how he wasn’t in official Avengers business.
Steve immediately brightened, imagining that this meant he could get the chance to spend more time with Tony. “Yes, we would love to go. Sounds fun.”
When he woke up, the first thing he noticed was the hand in his clenching and unclenching. He rose from his lying position and noticed Tony was awake and looking at him.
Tony shrugged. “Well, that’s not too much more to it honestly. We started drifting apart and soon I stopped caring what the reason was.”
“I’m getting there,” he honestly replied, leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder and interlacing their fingers, allowing himself to slowly close his eyes in the presence of those who loved him and would protect him.
Isak only nodded. “Mhm, nice detective skills. I’m ambidextrous though…so. Nice try. Now as I was saying, maybe…just maybe the media would like to see how much of a whore your little teammate was. He probably got off on being reduced to that.”
“Look I just don’t want to lose any more family okay,” Peter admitted. “I know you can keep yourself safe. You’ve been in this business longer than I have, but I also don’t have friends who have the potential to nearly kill me. At least I don’t think so? Maybe if Liz takes up her father’s profession and comes back then maybe I guess. Ned definitely not-”
The two wrestled some more over the remote. Steve held Clint in a headlock just as his phone began vibrating again. He managed to still hold Clint, while answering the call.
All of a sudden, he couldn’t stop his body from bowing over. Everything came to him at once and Tony stayed there all the same rubbing a hand across his back, whispering, “It’s okay.”
“I can’t tell if you’re lying or not, but that creeped me out. Could they have downloaded pictures of cute puppies or rainbows instead?”
“Fuck what needs to be done. I’m the leader of this team. You are not. Be mindful of that, when you’re suggesting what you believe one of my teammates should do. I am the one who cares for their livelihood and their well-being,” Steve said.
Steve cleared his throat and looked down at Tony with a grandeur of love and affection spilling into the space between them.
“He knows that if you can’t cook there are still places you can order food right?” Steve said. “A granola and yogurt aren’t for dinner. That’s like a snack.”
“Now wait just a moment,” Tony began to argue. “You will not regard Peter and Harley as though they are two teenagers with discipline problems. I will not allow them to participate in that narrative. Also how do you feel as a grown adult talking badly about some kids? You do not see myself nor Principal Davis engaging with that rhetoric do you?”
He distinctly heard a ringing go off on his StarkPad and ignored it thinking it was part of the game Miles was playing. So when Rhodey’s face immediately showed up on the screen before him his face immediately paled.
He needed confirmation that no one would leave him again. He wanted confirmation that someone wanted and needed him without the added expectations of Tony giving them something in return or with Tony receiving bruises.
Steve wondered whether this unhappiness would translate well, if he were to “accidentally” let a few into Ryder’s cell tonight.
“Shh, we have already made decisions. Last minute statements will not be put into consideration, especially from one not having voiced his own opinion when we actually needed it,” Julie said, eyebrow lifting and lips pressed together in a smooth smirk.
Steve’s arms tightened around Tony with an intent that Tony was completely down for. Tony gave a slight shift in movement, the result being Steve’s short gasp of breath. Tony smirked smugly.
Steve nearly broke the phone that was in his hand. He ignored the inquisitive looks that the others had as he passed to the gym. Steve didn’t even realize that he had spent an entire day down in the gym, until he looked at his bloodied knuckles and the clock hanging on the wall. He sat down and angrily pushed away the fact that he had wasted a day looking for Tony was holed up in the gym, when he should’ve been questioning CMPNY members. His frustration kept him awake well into the night and he figured he’d get rid of his pent up energy in some manner, before he pushed it on some underserving person.
Tony knew he didn’t have long before those patches and pills began to affect his body. He closed his eyes and tried channeling the last bit of energy he had. He didn’t know if it was truly the fear of not knowing what would happen if he was sold or whether Tony had gotten so tired of people touching him without his fucking permission…but whatever and wherever the energy came from he was thankful.
Clint rolled his eyes. “If we see him. He’s probably still holed up in his lab. Be surprised if he comes up to give us a hearty welcome.”
When Tony went back to the gymnasium, the only ones who were still there were the interviewees and Principal Davis. Principal Davis seemed to be commending them on handling themselves well and interacting with the guest speaker nicely.
Natasha went to him and tried to help him with taking them off, while also trying to see just how unfocused his eyes were. Tony’s wet body nearly slid across the floor.
“Tony has done nothing to deserve this. He has not once said anything bad against you. He even looked after your family, when you couldn’t. However, you want to pick fights and goad him, into what reacting negatively?”
“So you see you’re in no position to make threats, when I have a presence in every single factor of your everyday life,” Ryder laughed.
Isa sat down in the chair previously occupied by Tony and opened up her briefcase revealing 14 individual packets. She placed nine aside. “You know you are all in the minority opinion right now. Nine individuals have already signed the Accords.”
Peter leaned back and allowed his eyes to close with the thought that nothing would ever break them apart again and heaven have mercy on whoever tried.
“It’s always cold in here. The room is like this one…like the one,” Tony trailed off, hopeful that Steve would understand what he was trying to say. “And I asked her to crack the door, but she didn’t crack the door.”
“Ugh don’t remind me,” Tony teased. “Let’s just pretend that we only have to live for this spring break vacation.”
“Alright, alright. I won’t bring in Ms. Karen, but you’re going to have to talk to me then. You can’t keep this inside,” Steve told him.
Shame coursed through Steve and he immediately drew his body away from Bucky’s. Natasha pursed her lips together, wondering if Bucky had gone too far. Bucky’s eyes widened and his chest went up and down, trying to regain his breath. When he realized that Steve was no longer going to be wrestling with him, he took his seat next to Natasha again.
Bucky and Natasha followed both looking at Fury darkly. The others immediately started saying how they had come in without them even noticing, which was crazy…but then they realized Tony could get into anything if he really wanted and Fury had access to every single door.
“A decent guy…albeit a little misguided at times. I just… I love you Tony. I want what’s best for you. If this letter makes you feel hopeful inside, maybe this is what you’ve been subconsciously waiting for. Maybe things have happened to lead to this moment,” Rhodey announced. “Look that ball’s in your court. You can choose to ignore Rogers or to hear him out and I don’t know try things.”
“The Accords are just helping give us normal citizens a peace of mind knowing that while we have you all to protect us, there are provisions made to make sure that if you plan on making bad decisions you are held accountable.  Tony even got rid of the Raft as a punishment. The Accords allows you and your council along with UN representatives to appropriately come up with a course of action. It could simply be just rebuilding the small business shops. It could be a month’s suspension.”
Tony grew excited too at the thought of seeing his son, Peter, and Harley. “I’ll be glad to see them too.”
The two continued in companionable silence as Peter went through the photos and chose some to send over to Steve. Eventually he found the ones he wanted and then pocketed his phone.
“So you want me to what go prove that he is Ryder and get him to confess…” Tony didn’t finish his statement. “I need to be in the same room as him and..”
Peter seemed to be debating about what to say, until he turned to Miles. His eyes lightened briefly and he walked toward him.
“Well, if you’re quite certain I know all that happened why are you asking me? Surely, we were in the same room when the events transpired, or whatever events you’ve manipulated yourself into believing has happened.”
Steve smiled as Tony smiled at the fond memory. Steve had been worried that this would bring up bad memories, but so far it was going good.
“Or maybe he didn’t do it quite right, in order to leave Tony satisfied. Maybe he needed a firmer touch,” Isak hinted. “And I suppose you could give him that, huh Steve. You weren’t jealous of Ryder in the sense that you wanted him, but you were jealous of what he did with Tony. You wanted to be that firm hand, huh?”
The visitor smirked and opened his arms. “You know you haven’t made it really easy to find you little brother.”
“I say all of this because Tony has decided to welcome you all back to the Tower. He realized that it became a home for all of you and that’s where you would all like to go. He has created a floor for all of you. Each of you have been given your own floor, but if you want you can all live on one floor together. There are four bedrooms on each floor.”
“No?” Tony laughed. “Yes. Ryder you and I aren’t happy okay. Maybe we need the break to see what makes us happy again. You don’t make me happy…at least not with the way you are acting right now.”
He remembered later finding that bracelet with a note attached to it, the note he later found out was written by Ryder.  He also remembered how close he was that day and the days following from losing Tony.
The doctor brightened and waved him off. “Of course, of course. I’m sorry. Sometimes I forget that this time you’re not here to visit the kids, but because Mr. Stark’s in here. Please do check on him and whenever it is convenient for you come find me and you can visit the kids. And maybe when Mr. Stark’s up to it he can come as well.”
“You can’t touch me. Nope can’t touch me. No touching. You’re not going to touch me,” he repeated over and over, his eyes widening fearfully. “Can’t…Ryder promised. He promised. No more touching. No more touching.”
She turned to Rhodey, wanting a little assistance. Rhodey perked up at Pepper’s insistence and picked up where she left off.
Tony felt himself growing nearer and tapped Steve in warning. Steve only took this as encouragement, pressing harder on Tony’s prostrate and curling his finger toward himself. Steve’s tongue swiped at the head and Tony’s hip went up body chasing all the remaining physical gratification that Steve someone hadn’t completely wrung out of him yet.
“Tony, kotyonok,” she said hoping the Russian term would soften her voice and smooth over how her voice trembled. “I need to put this towel on you okay? Can I…”
He remembers him thrashing nearly knocking the doctor’s head. He remembered him yelling that he wasn’t going back again. Steve had only managed to pull himself away, when Natasha eased Tony’s tight grasp off of Steve’s hands.
“Webbing it up,” May announced. “Hey, stop laughing. I’m serious. He’s on break now so he’ll have more time to web it up and I’ll be out trying to outsource to a Eerin’s Media and selecting optimal media platforms for my them to use. Like seriously you can literally google how to appropriately determine the best combination of media to achieve your marketing campaign objectives. But nooo I have to fly out to Utah, while my nephew is here webbing it up and missing his curfew.”
Lying down after Tony successfully managed to get Steve to his sixth orgasm via a hand-job, since even he knew when to tap out after Steve had eaten him out to the point where Tony was so shaky at some point his eyes blacked out for a moment. Steve had only managed to get him to four because Tony was so determined to fixate on Steve. He was not going to lose and besides that meant Steve could always aim for the fifth orgasm another day.
“No, I told you not to come in unless I gave the word. I didn’t. It was stupid of me to not do that.”
Steve would be very welcoming of Tony’s words and then he would steer him toward the right direction. He had a month to persuade Tony to get rid of the Accords. At least that is what Pepper had seemed to imply. He looked at the rest of his teammates and decided that for them he would be the one to help Tony see the downsides of the Accords. Sure there may have been changes made, but at the end of the day it was still a restriction on their powers. If only Tony could understand this…but he couldn’t because he was Tony Stark.
Rhodey began to stand up. “And look I’ll come with. I’ll provide entertainment during the meetings.”
“This is a dream. When I wake up, you’ll be gone. You’re always gone. You’ll be gone, like always. It’s just a dream, just a dream,” Tony sings.
“I literally came to you and Sam a month ago, asking if it would be alright if I proposed to Tony so close to the date of your anniversary, to which you readily agreed saying that more ways to celebrate the month are always exciting,” Steve groaned.
Now excuse me to go sob into a corner because I really love this chapter and ughhhhh I hope you all do to.
“Oh, right. Guess the effects work faster than I thought. I’ll have to congratulate Bruce on that,” Tony said, moving his head to the side and studying Ryder. “It’s going to be hard for you on the raft. You have a lot of former CMPNY individuals there who are not satisfied with the way you left them to take the fall. I hate for it to get out, that you’re completely paralyzed and defenseless.”
“Ned,” Peter said quirking an eyebrow. “I was really only able to get this intern because of Mr. Stark.”
Tony easily went into the hold, turning his head to Steve’s heart, the beat lulling Tony into a sense of comfort.
“Okay. You both have fun. I’ll be back to pick you all up shortly,” Happy regarded Tony and went back to the driver’s side of the car.
Rhodey left to go back home. Tony told him that he should be with his family on his road to recovery. Tony wanted to imply that he was Rhodey’s family, but he didn’t want to be greedy. Rhodey still had people in his life who loved him. Those people could help heal his heart. Tony could only try to heal his legs.
“Tony,” Pepper breathed out. “Of course. We’re family and we love you. In any way you need us, we’ll be there.”
So he figured he could make his way into the kitchen and maybe just grab a cup of coffee, before everyone started filing into the room. As quiet as he could he left Harley’s room. It was still only six a.m. in the morning, so he still had at least two hours before everyone began filtering out of their rooms.
Steve raised his eyebrow and shifted in his seat, allowing for his legs to splay slightly open. He hated what he was doing, but sometimes you had to play the part. This was just another simple undercover thing that he was doing. But instead of it just being a mission, it was for the benefit of Tony. Opening his legs, just for Isak’s eyes to potentially show interest even for a second was fine, if it meant Tony didn’t have to open himself up to get Isak to announce his true identity.
Tony raise his hands in defense. “He’s at Michelle’s. They’re studying at Leauna’s for their academic decathlon or something of the sort. Peter thinks it’s a date.”
“Don’t think that you’ll be able to take Tony away from me. I know what this spaghetti dinner was all for. Don’t take me for stupid,” Ryder growled.
Tony held in the compulsion to answer him with a yes. He had wanted to know why. He wanted an explanation beyond the reasoning of why Ryder had just gone mad. There had to be something that drove him to do this…drove him to treat Tony like this.
Tony tossed his head to the side and saw another patch had taken its spot on his leg. The previous purple one had begun to turn gray and now it seemed they needed another one. Tony tried pulling his arms, but again the hands on his wrist stayed firm.
Steve poked his head out of the bathroom door, “Tony, serum might have enhanced a lot, but not everything pre-serum was small.”
He had called on himself to think about that sonnet his mom had imparted upon him. After that day with his thoughts of his mother and her wisdom on love surged through his mind, that sonnet had stayed with him. It was something that encourage him even now as he looked back at the
Harley shifted on his feet. “Oh Mr. Rogers didn’t tell you? Well, since you were gone for a month Mr. Rogers agreed to take me to see my mom every week and then figured it’d be easier to watch me. I think he’s trying to be like a mentor or something. I’m not really sure. Pretty sure I’m the mentor in this relationship. I mean he’s kind of behind on things. Like he didn’t know what Uno was? Uno! Like how do you not know that game,” Harley sputtered.
“What can’t you two get in your head? I’m not good for him. I’m doing this because I love him,” Steve rushed out. “You think I wanted to tell Tony I had to leave. You think I wanted to make Tony feel like me leaving was his fault?”
“Hey, no. You’re nothing short of beautiful, amazing, perfect, genius, and all the other good words in the world. Knowing all of this won’t make me feel any differently about you. It just makes me upset and highly ticked off that someone wanted to taint and abuse all the goodness inside of you,” Steve stressed
Heat mixed in with the cold and the sharp turn of temperature disoriented him. He felt dizzy and fragmented…like he didn’t belong in his skin.
The shelter was a large ten store home that was previously some office building. But it had been nicely renovated to house nearly 150 families with makeshift apartments nicely designed to accommodate anyone who entered.
Pepper’s eyes widened and then her expression smoothed out. “Tony calm down. You’re working yourself into a dizzying state. There is neither rain nor storm that would make Steve say no or break up with you. It’s just-”
“Don’t you think we should stop? I’m pretty sure this could give him alcohol poisoning. I didn’t sign up for murder,” Cali stressed out looking worriedly at Tony.
Bucky winced at that particular memory, remembering how he thought he was being so discreet. Newsflash he wasn’t, but honestly that was Sam’s fault. If he wasn’t so darn expressive and loud, but Bucky was 100% to blame seeing as how he could never keep his hands to himself. Sue him, his husband was fine.
“It’s good to see you Pete? Where’s MJ? I thought she was flying back for spring break as well,” Steve began to speak as the two of them made their way through the airport to head to Steve’s car.
“And I knew it wasn’t healthy. I kept coming here, because I wasn’t ready to say goodbye even though I told everyone I was done. Healed even. But you were the only one who knew how much you actually hurt me and I wish sometimes that I could have done more to make you feel just a semblance of pain I felt.”
These thoughts traveled through his mind as they entered S.H.I.E.L.D. everyone was still a little wary of placing themselves in this building, but they had nowhere else to go.
Peter lifted a shoulder casually and then responded saying, “Yeah, she was planning on coming, but she didn’t want to come back home for a week break then fly back to Wakanda to finish up the study abroad program for this semester. She said something along the lines of not disrupting the education experience of wealth and knowledge she was accruing for her studies in developmental cultural progress in the African Diaspora.”
Ryder looked about the room, for whatever reason Tony could not understand. No one was in the room and only he knew of who was really listening from outside of the room. Ryder kept his focus on the mirror, eyes peering into it as though it would reveal all that were behind him.
“Tony isn’t one to just open himself up to someone. You know that. You’re going to have to actually try and realize that if you want the chance to be with Tony you need to fight for him though.”
“Natasha is correct,” FRIDAY inserted. “Might I suggest DUM-E that you find Tony something that is actually drinkable. I doubt his body would handle lighter fluid particularly well.”
Steve reached out to grab Tony’s waist and settle him down on his lap. Tony gave out a startled sound of surprise, before resting his arms around Steve’s neck. His cheeks flushed with heat as he took in Steve’s expression.
“Knowing that you would have stayed. Spreading your legs open for any ounce of affection. Man those days you would cry out for me. You confused me, never knew if you wanted me to get off of you or pull you closer. You know that? You were the one that was manipulating things. I mean how could you say you wanted something and then change your mind?”
And with this question Tony truly brightened up, face wide with joy and excitement as he explained his plans for the shelter and all the new things that were happening. Pepper and Rhodey were content to listen to him talk. At one point Tony had grown flushed with embarrassment, but Rhodey only urged him on eyes kind and wanting to know more.
“Nothing,” Pepper addressed. “Alright come on our lunch has already extended its little bit of time. Alright Tony time for more meetings.”
Steve watched as Tony gradually became distressed. Tony leaned against the counter and ran his hands through his hair messing up the perfectly styled do. Tendrils of hair fell softly against Tony’s forehead casting shadows on it. Steve reached out and let his fingers lightly push back a strand of hair.
He couldn’t do this. He didn’t want to be here alone. Acid built up again and Tony’s body heaved expelling it from his body. He rolled his body away trying to get away from the pungent smell of it, but it stayed stagnant in this enclosed room.
He tried lowering his voice and extracting the defensive tone from his voice. “Sorry, it’s just I really like Ryder and for Steve to pull this so late. It’s frustrating. Maybe a year ago…and crap I don’t know. It’s confusing. Steve can’t just do this and make me feel hopeful for something that can’t happen.”
Tony’s heart stuttered. Pepper and Rhodey had made it a habit of telling Tony they loved him every time a conversation ended. Tony still hadn’t gotten used to this, but welcomed it all the same.
He shouldn’t want them to push Ryder away, when they came back. He shouldn’t want them to come and protect him from Ryder. Perhaps they wouldn’t even care. They probably wouldn’t care because Tony deserved what Ryder did to him. Maybe they wouldn’t even notice. But why should he want them to? He doesn’t know which is worse.
“You know Tony doesn’t like that particular nickname,” Steve noted as he leaned back against the counter with crossed arms.
“Look Stark. He has a wife and kids, both of whom know that he is in SHIELD custody. If he goes missing, the first person they are going to point fingers toward us. Now we can’t really afford to go through a scandal like this.”
Harley’s bottom lip trembled and tears openly poured down his cheeks. He pulled the covers up further underneath his chin. Steve stayed rubbing a hand over his back until he had exhausted himself so much he feel asleep.
Isa had left nearly five hours ago and everyone had dispersed onto their own floors to go through the document. Steve knew that most of them would have it signed by the end of this week and Steve did not know how to exactly feel about that information. He wanted to talk to Bucky and see where his head was at and maybe persuade him back onto his side. But after everyone had dispersed, he couldn’t find Bucky. FRIDAY had mentioned he was still in the building so he wasn’t worried, but he didn’t want Isa’s explanations to be the last thing Bucky heard.
“You sure? I can…I can always just talk to my therapist about this. I mean I probably will tell him everything, but I thought it was nice to tell…because I can’t exactly see my therapist right now. But I didn’t think about how much it might mean for you to…”
He couldn’t call Steve and tell him when he comes this time he should stay…that they should all stay. It wouldn’t be fair to make them do something they don’t want. So it’s okay if they didn’t even come back here to him. He could make them a Tower separate from the one he had renovated. He had been optimistic when he started remodeling. But now…maybe they wanted a place where he wouldn’t be. He couldn’t make them stay with him.
Winston’s darkened eyes traveled to the spot where Tony and him were about to be join. By now Tony was openly begging for both of them to stop. Ryder looked on amused and Tony could feel Winston’s cock beginning to rise in interest. He closed his eyes and just resigned himself to this. Just as he felt it begin to press inside of him, the weight from Winston’s hands were gone and there was a thump on the floor.
He made sure everything was in its place, when he heard footsteps behind him. Immediately he straightened his shoulders and turned to Tony who was sluggishly walking into the kitchen. Tony’s eyed widened upon seeing the meal laid out before him. He shook his head as though trying to wake himself up.
“Well I always wanted to take the kids to this villa my mom would take me to, when I was younger. Howard would rarely come on those trips, so it’s something that still has a nice feeling attached to it,” Tony said.
“I don’t know. It’s not like it’ll change anything. I mean he wrote a letter after everything went down with the Accords. This letter is probably just more excuses and reasons as to why he chose to leave me…the tower,” he quickly corrected, but Pepper and Rhodey had already caught on.
But they…they were going to sell him. Ryder promised him…he promised him he at least would never do anything to seriously harm him. But when Ryder was gone? He looked at the two unconscious bodies and felt proud. He hadn’t let them touch him. He did good. He didn’t let them touch him. If Ryder was here, he would have saved him earlier. Only Ryder could…
Tony wanted to thank the pilot, but the pilot remained silent besides telling him they had landed. Tony nodded and exited the plan. He watched as it flew off and went inside. He first went to his room and tried cleaning up. Cali had done wonders to his face, but he needed to shower and get rid of the smell of alcohol. While in the shower, he had time to think and think he did. By the time he looked presentable, he knew what he was going to do.
“Look, you’re free to join us. I made a lot,” Steve told Ryder, though he wanted nothing more than to tell Ryder he was free to leave. In fact, he was encourage to leave.
Tony followed Miles’ instructions and the two continued coloring, until Tony noticed nearly an hour had passed and he remembered Karen needed him to go to her office to tell her it was time to start putting decorations up.
Peter kept reading the messages as they came in, “Uncle Bruce said he’s got the playlist going for tonight. Uncle Clint and Aunt Nat said they’re making sure that other heroes are on call for tonight so that if something happens, you both won’t be called in.”
. And this was beautiful. For a few minutes all that Ryder did was massage his scalp and hum a song under his breath.
“See this is how you should respond when you think of Steve doing anything with you,” Ryder said kissing Tony’s tears away. “You know I would’ve never let Winston hurt you like that. You know that. I’ll protect you. I protect what is mine.”
“I am warning you. I have a kid in my possession. It would not do good to kill me right now so…” Tony continued to ramble on, but stopped when he realized Bucky was just placing his legs on top of his lap. Now Tony was able to fully stretch out without being in slight pain.
Tony moved to walk away, but Ryder reached out and grabbed his arm. His fingers tightly curled around Tony’s bicep and he squeezed it pulling Tony toward him. From an outside perspective it would look like Ryder and Tony were just engaged in a comfortable embrace. Tony muffled a noise of surprise at the abrupt movement.
Miles looked up from where he was now connecting the dots on his coloring worksheet. Ryder reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of bubble gum balls. He waved them in the air and held it out to Miles.
Tony’s eyes brightened with the power of the sun. “I vote time with my favorite deadly assassins, please.”
Natasha hoped they found Ryder just so she could put her knife in between his eyes. Images filtered in her hand, but she had to stop herself. Her main focus was Tony. Tony was starting to shake.
When Tony questioned how were his remaining seconds, Fury stared at him and stated, “In pain, kept saying the fire was melting everything inside of him.”
“I don’t mind if the shirt gets wet, but I’m still a little cold. So do you mind just rinsing my hands?”
“The sparks grew rapidly and always seemed to stay rooted in my chest. Oftentimes, I never truly knew how to deal with this feeling. I never put a name to it. In fact I tried pushing it aside so many times I lost count, but some things that you try hiding are the ones that are the most special to rediscover.”
“Mr. Stark I appreciate all of this, but the movie starts in two hours and with the traffic and the distance I really need to go.”
“You know they’re probably plotting against the both of you as you take your break,” Tony told them with an eyebrow raised. “Natasha probably began thinking of this as soon as she asked you both to join her group Wise up boys.”
Natasha kept her hands firmly in Bruce’s. While everything was happening in the interrogation room, Natasha had been mentally preparing what she wanted to do with Ryder. Surely, no one expected for Ryder to leave without being graced by the Widow’s bite.
Natasha scrunched up her nose and raised her body up slightly to put the coffee mug and its offending drink out of reach. DUM-E beeped discontent and grabbed U. U didn’t seem all the keen on being pulled away, but went nonetheless. Later they both came back with three of Miles’ juice cups.
“Well, I am going to leave you all here and go visit my man,” Ryder announced. “Oh, but before I leave I want to give you these invitations for a party this Saturday. Now it’s a surprise party, so please do your best not to spoil the event for Tony. It is truly going to be special.”
Tony’s heart softened at the gesture that someone was so happy for this engagement that it brought them to happy tears. The night continued in this manner, food being passed between each other, chairs being brought out so that everyone could sit down.
Natasha who had just walked in smiled in a pleased manner. Bucky, Clint, and Steve were soon to follow. Tony raised an eyebrow to her as if making sure that was okay. Julie looked up at Tony and asked again.
“So I wanted you to have something of all of them even if it’s something small,” Steve explained. “So the designs I found were the ones you made with your mom, when you were young.”
“He isn’t?” Bucky said turning away from the soapy water. “Huh, okay. Then where is the tiny genius.”
Miles’ attention was immediately taken away from Tony and steered toward Diana. Diana’s mom smiled warmly at the two.
“It should be enough,” he whispered soft enough that it was nearly muffled. “I’m sorry my thoughts are all over the place. I kept on debating with myself over which conclusion was better.”
Steve didn’t stop, but continued to push Tony higher. Tony’s fingers seized movement on the back of Steve. He only continued to grasp onto him tightly, legs falling apart on the bed from where they once wrapped itself on Steve’s waist.
“Well, I certainly wish we didn’t have to do board meetings, but alas we kept pushing them back. So voila we have four today. All back to back,” Pepper said.
Steve’s expression turned solemn and he bent his head forward so as to not meet Isa’s inquiring gaze. Natasha who had lifted her eyes from her own packet watched Steve and decided she would have to privately talk to him later.
Bucky let out a soft chuckle that nobody besides Steve could hear. Steve brightened at the sound, but decided not to draw too much attention to it. If he did, Bucky would no doubt try hiding it again. Bucky said Steve always became this overexcited puppy every time Bucky portrayed another emotion than brooding and deep reflection. Bucky had wanted him to stop looking at him like that because it had made him feel like Steve was constantly waiting for someone to come back, who was used to exchanging jokes and laughing. And Bucky wasn’t that guy anymore…at least not completely. But Bucky hadn’t wanted to give Steve false hope of “his” Bucky returning.
As the minutes passed by, the sun broke through the room lighting up everything and settling it in a nice soft glow. Tony breathed in as the kitchen filled, various bodies running into one another grabbing food onto their plates. Sam and Bucky were the first to come in bickering, arguing over Bucky leaving him behind in his run.
“Are you serious? So it wasn’t about you playing hide and go seek with your little assassin buddy?” Pepper spoke out, but was calmed down by Phil gently placing a hand on her shoulder.
By the time Steve had dropped (which thankfully Harley was on time…or early however one wanted to put it) Harley off at school, he began to spend the rest of the day running errands for tonight.
Tony smiled to himself as all of the children ran to go play with the toys he had brought for this week’s visit. Karen, who was the owner of this orphanage shook her head at Tony.
“Weren’t you the one telling me you wouldn’t be tricked into signing them out of school early?” Happy questioned seeming thoroughly amused at the two new additions.
“Don’t you think there’s something wonderful about a man with scars,” she addressed toward her sister.
“You would tell me, if you were really Ryder, right? You wouldn’t be so cruel as to have me believe the one person that has ever loved me truly and has taught me true love and sacrifice is dead. So please,
Ryder leaned forward and rocked his body down against Tony’s. He pressed forward and Tony felt the reactor press into parts of his body that it wasn’t intended to be near.
“As long as you tell me the truth, you won’t be punished. Everyone out there already believes that you’re Ryder. So you don’t have to lie to me, never to me. I know it’s you. I’ve slept beside you for months and I am saddened that you think you could hide yourself from me,” Tony explained, softly.
For a moment he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He felt chocked in his room. He leaned over his body and placed his head between his knees. He tried coaching himself through breathing. He grabbed his knees to stop them from trembling. Something rang in his ears and it pounded against his head. After his breaths had calmed down and his mind’s thoughts came to a slow stop, he stood from the bed.
It was beautiful to see everyone together. The business in their lives, all the pain and suffering…it all brought them here to one another. Although cliché, Tony supposed that love had been quite effective in melding things together.
Tony used to think it was so charming. He used to dream about making that small easy smirk cross Ryder’s features.
His bright eyes staring at him would have been adorable, if it hadn’t been for the thinly veiled edged of panic taking over his expression.
When Tony came back to their table, Steve smiled at seeing the bracelet adorn Tony’s wrist. Tony saw Steve’s gaze and gave a discreet smile. Steve went back to talking to Thor, who was completely enraptured with the small portions of food they were serving. Steve and others had tried many times to explain the concept of appetizers, though Steve admitted to himself his own explanation was rather terrible.
Steve leaned forward replacing his fingers with his mouth on Tony’s pulse point. Tony’s eyes rolled back and he moaned at the pressure. He sighed softly, feeling Steve’s breath fall on him like a cool breeze.
“You all went to an amusement park?” Tony said, thoughts of the coldness slowly fading into the distance.
“I love you so much that sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe because you’ve taken nearly all the air in my lungs. And it scares me,” Steve admitted. “It scares me because I never want to lose you. I’ve lost so many people in my life and I had gotten used to it, but now…”
Natasha nodded. “He’s right. You know usually when you love someone, you fight for them. You gave up without even trying. I’m sure you had a deeper friendship with Tony than he does a relationship with Ryder. So no you don’t love him.”
“Hey, Cap, welcome home.” Tony, previously hidden by the shadows of the setting sun, waved lazily from the kitchen. The first thing that stuck Steve, even before his mind caught up enough to panic at the thought of being alone with this man, was the fact that Tony wasn’t wearing his boots with the lifts in them. Their Tony had barely ever worn the things, but this version had dug them out of the back of the closet on his first full day in the Tower and had practically lived in them ever since. But now here he stood, nearly a full foot shorter than Steve and padding around the kitchen in Steve’s sweater and a pair of soft, worn jeans. He looked truly at home here for the first time, and a vice tightened around Steve’s chest. “Can you fill that?”
? That would be a bit rich from the woman who wanted me tarred and feather for the mere act of producing and selling weapons just because I didn’t know how and under what conditions each and every one of them would be used. Well I’m not going to give you absolution, Brown. And your sanctimonious ass has no right coming in here and expecting it.”
“Shit. I’m sorry. I’ve done this, I mean with like, dates and chocolate strawberries and stuff, but on most of those occasions I was pretty drunk, and I don’t—”
It had been..weird to be on the other side of all of it. Thor had been so incredibly sweet and responsive, the best submissive a first-timer could have asked for, and there had been something heady and exciting about having someone that powerful under his control, happy to be moved and touched and denied all at Tony’s leisure. But Tony spent a lot of the scene with the uneasy feeling of someone sneaking a glance at an opposing team’s playbook during the big game.
, because those had just been the items covering him. Now Natasha was stripping away everything, every bit of dust and every city smell and every touch that hadn’t been her own, so that all he could feel was her.
After days of avoidance, Tony and Phil catch up. Meanwhile, Steve and Pepper talk next steps in the battle with SI.
Instantly, all traces of softness were vanished from Pepper. It was just as ominous as watching Thor summon the thunder, or Natasha produce a weapon from thin air, and Steve reflected that while Rescue was great, Pepper really didn’t need a suit of armour. She was her own suit.
Content Notes: The first 'vision' relies on a cut subplot from Endgame involving Natasha running an orphanage for kids left parent-less by the Snap. The vision takes place after Nat's death, and as such may be triggering for those who have faced traumatic losses of parents or other caregivers. Skip down to the next question if you want to avoid.
Nevermind actually composing the message itself, Rhodey spent a good thirty minutes just trying to figure out who to address it to. His first thought was Steve; he was already the team’s leader in so many ways, and while they’d all seemed happy enough to be incorporating Rhodey into their relationship, it had been Steve he’d dealt with so far for most of the logistical stuff.
“Okay. So if the contract is overwhelming you then we need to start by making it a bit more manageable. You’ve put a lot of question marks and notes around the stuff on pain. Not something you’ve done much before, right?” Tony shook his head. “One way to think about it is by type—the big ones are stinging, cutting, and thudding. JARVIS, sort all relevant tools and acts under those categories please?” The document was reorganized in seconds, and was already several pages shorter. “Any Dom worth your time will help you experiment with all of them anyway, so this isn’t supposed to be a definitive thing. Exploratory contracts are there to help your Dom get a clear sense of what your limits are and what you’re particularly interested in. They know things will evolve as you get more experience. That said, any initial thoughts on which of those styles might appeal more?”
Tony noticed Natasha first, mainly because the sight didn’t make sense. She was perched on a ledge in the northeast corner holding…was that a bow? (Was this universe somehow so backward that Nat, not Clint, was Hawkeye?)
love you—that’s not a lie. And as far as I’m concerned that’s as much as anyone else needs to know. When I agreed to the super serum I never once consented to giving up every shred of privacy I had, and nor did you or the other Tony when either of you became Iron Man. The thought that he could help, I don’t know, shield you from some of that, create a kind of barrier between us and the rest of the world, I find that kind of beautiful in a way. Like a gift you’d be giving each other.”
Steve is also pushed into entering therapy in this chapter. Nat had warned him before he left that this was coming so it's not entirely a surprise, but the timing definitely is unexpected to Steve, and he's not really given the option to refuse.
The team moved around them with perfect coordination. Some of the circumstances might be glaringly different, but the general dance of coaxing an overextended Tony into allowing them to provide his basic needs was far from a new one. While Steve steered Tony into the nearest kitchen chair, Bruce and Clint got to work on food. There were no leftovers from the beef barley soup of earlier (probably for the best, soup could be a challenge when Tony was clumsy from exhaustion), so they began assembling and toasting a simple grilled cheese sandwich on gluten free bread and a bowl of Greek yogurt with honey. With quiet directions from JARVIS, Thor was putting together a smoothie to accompany the meal; Steve was relieved to note the hefty spoonful of protein powder that went into it. Natasha had disappeared into the penthouse bedroom, probably to make preparations that would streamline getting Tony clean and in bed.
When the rest of the team began streaming into the penthouse for dinner by what seemed to be an unspoken agreement, Tony almost resented them for it at first. Far from what he’d expected, his afternoon with Natasha, Clint and Phil had been the calmest and most relaxed he could remember being in…well, years, probably. Thanos had weighed on his mind since the first attack in New York, staining even his best days with the sickly hues of hopeless anxiety that came from knowing with complete certainty that disaster was coming while being unable to convince anyone else to take the threat seriously. (Out of everything, that might have been the hardest thing to forgive his Steve for. Not even Siberia had been as great a betrayal as Steve’s almost glib insistence that the team would handle the threat of Thanos ‘together’ only for them all to refuse to help Tony prepare in any material way before the threat was already on their doorstep.)
“Want me to return the favour?” Steve offered. As he’d anticipated, Thor shook his head; when he was nearing the end of a scene, Thor usually chose to avoid orgasm. He found that staying hard helped head off the worst of his drops, which could otherwise be quite severe once he was released from bondage. “Alright. You did beautifully, darling. I’ve just realized I left that case of juice you like upstairs after movie night, so I’m going to run up and get it, okay? I won’t untie you until I get back, and then I won’t leave again. We can stay together for the rest of the day. Sound good?”
fast. As soon as they realized who had joined the fight, all three of the others abandoned their solo efforts to take one another down and joined forces. Fist Girl, who it turned out was also highly elasticized, made frequent attempts to grab her out of the air while Lady Hawkeye sent arrows that impressively predicted America’s flight path. Spider-Girl seemed at first to be trying to outrun the speedy threat, though after watching for a couple of minutes Peter realized she was trying to lead America into the traps laid out by the others.
“One day—when you’re ready—I wanna know every damn thing that ever happened to you over there. But for now let’s stick to the facts. You don’t know this stuff, so do what you do better than almost anyone else: research the problem and figure it out. Take the contract to bed, with access to a search engine and maybe some porn and a heavy-duty vibrator or two,” here, Tony made a thoroughly undignified speaking noise. “Stop trying to think about what he would have wanted, or even what your team wants, and just…fantasize. Take the pressure off it and explore.”
that—” Bruce laughed, a full-on belly laugh that highlighted how many more laugh lines this version of Banner had than his counterpart, and Tony was momentarily distracted enough by the combination of that sight and sound that he didn’t even register being guided onto the hospital bed. He was definitely right to guess it was souped up; the mattress was at least a Queen, and the thread count of the sheets was probably triple that of anything ever used in SHIELD medical.
(How long had it been since anyone had catered to a simple creature comfort of Tony’s like that, even if it was technically made to other-Tony’s preferences?)
Still, Tony took his time drinking the tea Steve had made them both. It was lemon, and while herbal wasn’t usually Tony’s…well, cup of tea, Steve had put some kind of rose flavoured honey in it that tasted amazing, especially paired with the delicate little cookies that were laid out on the coffee table.
“Come with me, then. I don’t need Rescue if I have Iron Man, and from the sounds of it our little ruse implying we’re not as close didn’t really work anyway.” Steve’s gut dropped, but before he could even process his own panic, he grew aware of the sudden quiet in the room. Tony had been silent for several beats too long, and appeared intensely interested in an unremarkable spot on the kitchen floor. Steve went from attempting to at least pretend he was watching television and not listening to their conversation to practically staring a whole through the other man. (Since when had Tony ever been reluctant to get in the armour, especially to protect the people he loved?)
“Well he called me Platypus and Honey Bear, for one,” Rhodes said, leaning against one of the treadmills with a smile both fond and pained. Their Tony had always called him Popcorn. “Other than that…he’s pretty scattered. It came in bits and pieces, and I didn’t want to press too hard on anything; he came close to what looked like a panic attack on two separate occasions.” Steve’s gut clenched, dominant instincts screaming at him at the very notion of his (a, goddammit,
Having a muzzled version of the world’s most powerful AI on his side was frustrating as hell, but the very last thing Steve wanted to come out of any of this was for Tony to feel as if he were truly alone. He agreed to JARVIS’ terms, he made what felt like dozens of plans and contingencies and alternates with Natasha. And then they waited. Each day the anniversary drew closer, Steve started to feel more and more desperate. He started pondering the viability of truly disturbing methods like kidnapping Tony; when he confessed to Natasha, sure he would face scorn and judgement about his dwindling sense of ethics, she shook her head impatiently.
Steve picked up his shield. It felt heavy in his hands in a way it rarely did, but he knew as surely as he knew his own name that Tony would not easily forgive him for only feigning a full effort. He threw the shield, not at Tony but against the furthest wall. It sailed a perfect path toward the armour, promising a brutal impact that never came. Like Clint’s arrows, it was knocked from the sky with multiple blasts from the three energy beams; it clattered to the floor twenty feet away from Steve. The Hulk whooped; several of the others began loudly placing bets on the outcome.
They spent the rest of the day together. Tony drifted in and out of sleep a couple of times, and they watched some goofy television while Clint put a heated shoulder pad on Tony’s upper back and shoulders to ward off any potential strain. They were in the middle of a debate over what to order for dinner when JARVIS’s voice cut through the room like a blade.
Mostly, though, Tony watched Phil and Natasha. He tried not to be overly obvious about it. The last thing he wanted was to make either of them feel like he was staring in a bad kind of way. Because honestly, there was something kind of beautiful about them.
“You can’t tell them. Or…or him. Nothing good ever came of him knowing me, Natasha. I need you to promise me that you’ll never even breathe his name to me or to anyone else ever again after tonight. Keep an eye on him, keep him as safe as you can from a distance, but never let him so much as get a whiff that you or any of the Avengers are involved. Will you do that for me?”
Just when Tony was working up the nerve to ask, Bruce exited the elevator and made his way to Tony, nudging his shoulder and reaching a hand out for his empty plate.
Steve didn’t bother to force himself to listen to the quiet pleasantries the two exchanged on the way to the elevator. The entirety of his attention was on the man who stood in his arms, eyes drooping and head falling forward and then snapping back up as he fought the lure of sleep.
“Tony, shut up.” He had snapped out the words without thinking, before even realizing that there might be enough of his Dominance pressed into them to make Tony’s submissive side react. And wouldn’t that be a horrible way to re-encounter his sub after years apart, to start issuing orders that Tony would feel compelled to follow? He was halfway to an apology when Tony answered, apparently unbothered.
Then the heat started to feel like it was seeping right through into his muscle and bone, which, honestly, was kind of awesome. His carpel tunnel, despite Clint’s obsession with getting it assessed, really wasn’t all that severe, but Tony did still work at screens and keyboards of various kinds for most of the day. Add to that the stress tremors that he’d developed in his left hand and arm in the weeks leading up to the Civil War, which had plagued him ever since, and he was rarely what he would call comfortable. Except now.
“Are you telling me Tony Stark blackmailed an underage kid into crossing national borders and fighting a bunch of superpowered adults? Please tell me you’re kidding right now.”
Phil had returned to the penthouse with all of the items Natasha had requested. In seconds he’d been kneeling on the pillow, a warm brown collar wrapped around his throat. Then Natasha had opened the ornately carved wooden box she’d asked for and retrieved a handful of what looked to be metal spheres. They were just slightly smaller in circumference than a standard watch face, but Natasha’s hand dipped under their weight in such a way that suggested they were quite heavy. (That ruled out silver and steel, then, unless the latter was heavily reinforced with something. Maybe adamantium?) She had looked at Coulson in askance.
Steve exchanged a glance with Bruce, who smiled a little ruefully. Clearly, they were going to have their hands full today. What neither of them counted on, though, was the two problem-children actually helping each other. After throwing numerous confused glances in Bucky’s direction, Tony set his fork full of gravy-covered sausage down.
With a heavy sigh, Natasha drew another piece of wood towards herself, this one finished and one Steve recognized immediately; it was the box that held the spheres Phil handed to his Dominant(s) at the beginning of every scene. He gaped.
“I’m pretty sure he said something about moving to Toledo with his fiancé while he half-ran out the door.”
Steve reacts angrily to Tony near the end of the chapter. Tony is in no danger, but obviously doesn't have the best history with angry Steve, so he's on his guard.
“He did, yes. But those provisions still require the consent of the executor.” She didn’t need to say more; the implication was abundantly clear. Tony would need her permission to access anything, and right now Pepper didn’t intend to give it to him. The cruelty of it shouldn’t have cut very deeply, not after everything else that had happened in the last few years, but somehow it did anyway. Even when he’d had nothing, he’d almost always had Pepper.
“No.” Bucky was standing, his usual sniper patience apparently not enough to carry him through this conversation sitting, and though one spoke to Natasha, he looked directly at Steve, blue eyes shining. “We all doubted Stevie this week when we shouldn’t have, me more than anyone. And let’s try not to forget the guy is pretty decent at strategy. Hear him out.”
we’re going to do this, I want that paperwork filled out in as much detail as you can give me. It’s fine to not know something because of a lack of experience, but if I think you’re willfully omitting information that I need to keep you safe and well, then deal’s off and you start with a gentler Dom. Got it?” His smile when Tony replied with a quiet ‘yessir’ was almost wolfish.
“Given any more thought to any of the extracurricular options we discussed during our last meeting?” Peter winced. Pretty much everyone in his life—the school, May, even Tony had brought up getting involved at school, but he’d been pretty solidly put into ‘loser’ slot immediately upon entering the doors of Midtown High. He’d then moved over into the more specialized ‘loser who also falls asleep in class a lot’ after the bite and taking up the Spider-Man mantle. And while Midtown might be more evolved in a lot of ways, it was still a high school; there was very little point in trying to move out of one of those boxes once you’d been put there. Peter didn’t see a whole lot of point in trying. “Well, Mr. Harrington has suggested, and I quite agree, that you might do well on the academic decathlon team.” This time Peter couldn’t quite hold back a snort, though he tried his best to turn it into a cough at the last minute.
“Gwen! I’m really sorry I couldn’t make it to the show on Friday. How’d it go?” An odd expression slid across her face, but when Gwen shrugged with her usual air of nonchalance, Peter decided he must have imagined it.
Tony! Given how much time Peter had spent with the man as of late, it shouldn’t have come as quite such a shock to realize that he had someone to call, now, when things got weird. But then, Tony had been pretty deliberate about keeping a careful distance between himself and Spiderman, offering suggestions that often felt more academic than personal. Peter didn’t need his caution or detachment now, though. This blurry-fast dude was going to tear the man in front of Peter apart, and he had no idea how to fight an enemy he could barely see.
“Look, I just don’t want to end up paying interest when someone realizes there’s been a mistake here. So unless you can tell me who my mysterious benefactor is—”
As to others who have regrets, there are unfortunately many to choose from in this regard.After all, practically no one listened to Stark when they should have.
By now, Tony was well used to waking with at least one body pressed up against his own. It was the kind of thing that still felt slightly unbelievable in its banality; even a couple of months ago, the thought of being accustomed enough to the constant presence and touch of others that he wouldn’t feel startled by it all over again in the morning felt unachievable. But now even the less familiar press of Bucky’s metal arm against his stomach made Tony feel more at home in his own skin. He wondered privately if a collar might make him feel this way all the time, a constant physical reminder of how much Tony had keeping him here.
(And if it was easier, too, to throw himself into work a little bit to avoid thinking too much about the looming anniversary of the other Tony’s death, well, Dr. Domen said as long as he wasn’t going into complete denial or allowing himself to get too isolated from the team, that was probably okay.)
) until he was sure the boy was asleep. It didn’t take all that long; Peter had clearly been exhausted long before the emotional upheaval of being kicked out of his apartment, and that was outweighing whatever weirdness he must have been feeling about sleeping in an unfamiliar place. At least in sleep Peter looked like a kid, starfished on his belly with one leg under the covers and the other on top. He was hugging his pillow, too, in a way that gave Tony the bizarre urge to get him some kind of stuffed animal, even though that would be way age-inappropriate and probably freak the kid right the hell out.
Much of the emphasis in public discussion of Tony Stark’s recent press conference has been on his father, Howard Stark. And I’m not arguing that Howard’s actions are excusable, or that we shouldn’t be talking about them! But I’m more interested in using this space to think about his son, and how his actions today as well as over the past few months since his return seem to suggest that Tony Stark is stepping up as a crucial public figure in the fight for more progressive orientational politics.
“So you’re not going to rat me out then, Platypus?” Tony teased, hoping he had managed to keep the thread of anxiety from seeping too much into his tone. Dr. Chimva appeared to be ignoring the entire exchange as she started unpacking gear from her bag and muttering about the lack of sterility of the room. (It was true that they’d be better off doing this in the med-wing that Bruce had built, but Tony would never make it through the next morning’s check-in with a straight face if he was hiding something like this from Bruce in his Dominant’s own domain.) Rhodey rolled his eyes.
The extent to which Tony wanted that was frightening. It had been an option for a matter of seconds, and already he felt like he might fucking die if Coulson took it away. There weren’t words to communicate desire that deep or guttural; Tony sank further onto Phil’s cock, trying to demonstrate the extent of his need. Phil made a gut-punched sound that took the shape of Tony's name.
And yes, maybe she should have called for help sooner than she did when it came to the latter issue. But however else she delighted in being a killjoy when it came to nonsense like structural racism and people who apparently wanted to make polio a thing again, MJ was still a damn bro when it came to helping those she loved get up to mild mischief while avoiding punishment from parental units of all sorts. So she waited it out. She found what would pass for a bucket to try to contain the mess, did her best to keep Peter’s annoyingly soft little curls out of the splash zone, and she didn’t take any photos or videos. Not even early in the evening when Peter attempted to develop an ill-advised drinking song about the booze he absolutely insisted on referring to as Thor Juice. His horrible attempts to rhyme had included mentions of Bruce (as in Banner), Seuss (as in Dr.) and a
Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad? Liz was always kind to Peter, even after his already poor reputation had started to plummet. Sure, his chances of getting the date he’d once dreamed of were nonexistent. Not only would she never look twice at him that way, but Peter could never be with her when he couldn’t tell her that he knew that her Dad’s sudden absence from school events was not due to business travel, but because he was awaiting trial for stealing and distributing alien weaponry. But that didn’t mean they couldn’t be friends, right?
“I know what you’re doin’, brat,” Bucky told him, though his knowledge of Tony’s entirely unsubtle attempts at edging Bucky somewhere at least Dominant-adjacent did not prevent him from sliding his arms around Tony’s waist. He didn’t seem to run quite as hot as Steve did (probably owing to the bastardized version of the super-soldier serum he’d been given), but it still felt extremely pleasant, and less weird than it should have given their relative lack of interactions like this, to snuggle in against the planes of Bucky’s toned chest.
Steve’s therapy session was winding down for the day. They’d mostly discussed Steve’s art classes, and his other attempts to build a life for himself outside of the team. They’d set goals for their next session, and Domen was sliding her sleek tablet into her briefcase when JARVIS alerted Steve to an incoming call to his personal number.
Bucky knew what Steve was planning. Maybe he wasn’t clear on all the details, but outside of his Winter Soldier persona, Bucky wasn’t a subtle man. His disapproval had been just as easy to spot as the signs of his recent and extremely happy reunion with Sam. (Bucky wanted a future, a life here. He didn’t need Steve anymore, didn’t deserve to be weighted down by Steve’s stagnant refusal to move forward.)
And sort of relatedly, the last one contains some insecurity on the part of the Switches in the Tower about the Dominants having time/interest for them with a full-time sub around. This involves reference to a past event in which two of the Switches attempted to Dom for one another while not in the right headspace, which is not considered safe in this universe. No one is hurt beyond a tweaked muscle, but it's a serious issue that is taken seriously by the Dominant who is hearing about it.
Finally, Steve snapped. Got the kid into a modified crab hold and let the true extent of his strength turn it into something brutal enough to make the other man release a piercing scream that painted the walls of the gym. The room, filled just moments before with taunts and shouted wagers and encouragement for both sides, was suddenly silent. He released Alex as quickly as he could, and was attempting to reach out and help the other man to his feet, when a flash of red hair near one of the corners revealed Natasha, reclined across the ropes as if lying on a hammock. (Steve had long since learned to stop bothering to ask when she’d suddenly appeared somewhere without his noticing. She never answered anyway, and it gave the woman way too much satisfaction.)  She made no attempt to aid Alex, and needed only one venomous stare to essentially forbid Steve from doing so either.
Tony returns to Malibu, and finds some unexpected ways to work through his still-conflicted feelings.
So it made sense, in a way, that Bruce was the one to start nudging gently at the thick, heavy walls Tony had put around himself, keeping almost every one of the other team members at a safe distance. And it started harmlessly enough. Natasha had been offering Phil, who had come up a bit since the afternoon but was still not quite at baseline (at least from what Tony could tell) bites of pasta off her own plate, while Rhodey scooped a heaping serving onto Pepper’s plate, ignoring her half-hearted protestations.
“Hush now. You had plenty of chances to talk to me this morning, and you chose to take none of them. It’s my turn right now. I know you have mixed feelings about punishment and discipline, but it’s extremely natural for submissives, especially new ones or those ranked extremely low on the orientation scale, to seek out regular correction. It shows them where the boundaries are, and it reminds them that their Dominants care enough to enforce them. It’s healthy and natural and entirely normal. And some part of you knows that, because you’ve already asked for it once.”
Except that when Tony opened the book, it barely looked like Howard Stark’s machine-precise handwriting. It was messy and frantic, the letters smudging and running into one another and drifting suddenly off the lines. Howard did many things drunk, but keeping written records wasn’t usually one of them. There was something different about this book. Tony knew that before he realized that the messy sketch on the first page was of a uterus.
! Is that so fucking terrible? I have lost—everything, Bucky, over and over again. I used to think of myself as a dancing monkey, a puppet in this silly nationalistic show—annoying, sure, but ultimately worth it because it got me where I needed to go. But Captain America is so much worse than that. The serum…all it’s ever brought anyone is death. Erskine, you, Peggy, all of our friends, and now—and now…please. If you’re right, then just let me have the hope, alright? It’s gotta be better than this.”
4. An interesting question. At present, the team knows relatively few good things about their counterparts. Stark himself often wanted to avoid thinking about the things and people he was actually missing, and he also wished to avoid giving the impression that he preferred those versions of his partners given his own anxieties about measuring up to the man he calls Mark II. However, I expect this will change in the coming weeks, now that he has freely chosen to remain in this universe, and because certain conversations (those regarding Stark’s children, for instance) are long overdue.
like it is here, you know?…god I hate metaphors. They really love metaphors here, everyone’s always telling you something on like five different levels and clearly they’ve infected me.”
Fuck this Steve for somehow knowing or guessing that anyway. Tony had been content to ignore the damn berries and all their taunting (
“I guess I should have warned you—anywhere there’s a repulsor there’s now also a camera. Provides full 360 visibility around the suit. Want to try again?”
“Like it when you watch me,” he confessed, no longer sure he was play-acting at all. “Like the way it feels to have all your focus. I’d do anything to get you to look at me like that, Steve, please, pleasepleaseplease—”
“I…yeah, I guess that’s true. That’s how Coulson and Clint, and Nat to some extent, have always operated, I think, long before I was in the picture anyway.” Tony nodded, summoning the chart from the Wakandan report back to him with a complicated gesture Steve hadn’t seen before. (Had he been upgrading SHIELD’s holoscreens too, somehow?)
was Clint in a truly Dominant headspace. The flashes Tony had seen so far during carefully curated moments in the penthouse hadn’t even come close to showing him what that really meant. He remembered again how it had felt during their date to realize how deadly Clint was, how intimately he knew the human body and all its weaknesses. “You always have the power to alter or end a scene if you want or need to. And we’re new to one another, so in addition to your full-stop safeword remember you have the option of using yellow, too, if you need something to slow down but not halt entirely. That power is all yours; I’ll never do anything to you that you don’t want or can’t handle. Tell me you understand that.”
“Screw confessing,” Steve said. “We don’t need a confession from a dead man. We covered up “Ryder” last time, we can do it again this time. We’re the only ones who have to know.”
And for those reasons alone, did Steve finally finish taking the slowest shower to mankind and get out.
“First that was one time and I apologized. Every other time was consensual. Plus I thought you were of the forgiving nature. How long must you hold that over me? Didn’t Bucky kill your parents and you forgave him?”
Tony turned his head to the side. “I know…I think I know that. But sometimes when I looked at him, I just remembered the guy that was my first friend at MIT, the one who taught me how to play beer pong, or the one who brought me snacks to the labs on campus even when it was fifteen minutes walking distance from our dorms.”
“Why do you think it should be sooner?” Tony said. “I mean I know we’ve been dating for a while and…heck maybe you’re right? Maybe I should make it random and propose today. Pep! Yes, that’s what I’ll do. I’ll propose today. Come on up up up. Let’s go find a ring before I have to head back to my prison time.”
Steve’s glad that Clint came into that restroom stall. He loved Bucky and Natasha. He truly did, but he knew they would try talking to him, offering words of comfort, but what he needed right then was silence. There were too many things going on in his head at that moment.
He just couldn’t turn them off. He walked through the hallways and his steps wore lethargic as if he had been up all night. He practically had been up for more than 48 hours. He briefly wondered if Tony would be proud.
“Well, I can say that I did not think you would be back to visit me all this soon,” Isak said. “I guess I should feel flattered the Avengers think I am someone of such importance that you must occupy your day with me. Unfortunately, it is not for the reasons I wish. As I have told you I am not my brother. I do not know what I must do for you to get that through your heads.”
Tony stepped back and released the rings one by one each circling the bottles before landing on it. Tony straightened his shoulders and smiled at Jaime who looked amused as Steve looked on dumbfounded.
He grabbed his clothes and went toward his bathroom and softly closed the door. He stepped out of his clothes and slowly eased his aching body into the shower. As the warm water traveled over sore shoulders, Tony looked down to see his skin beginning to redden from where Ryder’s grasp had been too tight on his hip.
However, he didn’t miss the way Tony fearfully whispered, “You know I’m not like that anymore Ryder.”
Bruce walked in, rubbing at his eyeglasses before setting them down on the bridge of his noise. “Please, Thor no five minute conversations over pop tarts, before I’ve had the chance to at least have some tea.”
A string of rushed words came out and there was a silent quiver to them. Harley remained silent, but Steve could see the way his fingers seemed to tremble.
Before Steve was even able to hand Miles a cup of apple juice, Ryder had handed Miles a cup of his own. Miles looked wearily at the cup, but deciding that he was thirsty he accepted it.
A few moments of silence passed between them and Tony wondered if he should tell them everything else. If he should tell him about Ryder. Rhodey had just told him not to shut him out, so maybe he should let them in. Tony struggled for a moment to breathe and debated internally, if this was the time to say something. Maybe if he had someone on the outside telling him to get out of this relationship and tell him he didn’t deserve this…that there were other people to fill the void of making Tony feel wanted and needed…
Everyone was gathered near the entrance of the carnival with varying levels of excitement. The three surrounding orphanages, Karen’s, Magnolia Orphanage, and Makalni Orphanage all brought their children ages four and up to attend the winter carnival. Tony had been busy running circles making sure each child was in their appropriate group. So far the only ones who wanted a change in groups were the little black widows.
“And the only thing I can think of is that, you honestly think you deserved that treatment,” Steve slowly said as though finally realizing what he suggested. “Is that what you think? That you deserved this?”
Bucky shook his head. “No way. Come on between the two of us and our skill set we should be able to face off Natasha and a group of little girls.”
Steve began to walk to his room and was slightly alarmed to see Ryder walking toward him. He scowled at Steve’s presence and then sent an unimpressed glare to Steve. An expression flashed across Ryder’s face, but it was too quick for Steve to place what it was. Steve straightened his shoulders and Ryder shook his head and regarded Steve as though he was a child.
Clint raised an eyebrow at him. “Where are you off to this early in the morning? And don’t try telling me you’re off to go for your morning run because I’m pretty sure your clothes aren’t appropriate for running.”
Steve noticed Tony did that a lot when he was nervous. Steve imagined he was nervous for his response.
Winston grabbed his free arm and dragged the tip of his cock against Tony’s hole. Tony tried clenching his legs and stopping them from spreading. Ryder laughed.
“You make it a habit to step on kids,” the small boy questioned tossing the covers over his head. He turned red eyes to Steve. His mouth was turned downward and his brown hair stuck up at odd ends.
“Oh, and leave the door cracked please,” he shouted after them. Peter nodded and left the door slightly open.
The phone call was cut short as Tony hung up. Steve looked at his phone confused by the sudden abrupt end to their phone call. Steve sat the phone on the coffee table and figured he would just see what that was about, when Tony came back.
“We have agency without regulation. We don’t need this and maybe you should stop listening to Tony. He has a very biased opinion of all of this,” Steve said softly in hopes of Pepper not getting offended on the sake of her friend.
Bucky knew that Steve’s mind had been changed. He knew that look. It was the look of a guy, who knew it was stronger to stay than to leave. He let his own bags fall back to the ground.
He allowed that for three more times, holding his breath and counting the seconds. On the fourth time, he locked onto the hands holding him and pushed the body down into the water. Jack fumbled a bit in shock from his place behind Tony.
His thoughts were cut off shortly, when Natasha wrapped an arm around his waist somehow allowing Tony to lean on her and decrease the weight on his leg. Clint also took to noticing trivial things in the Tower, making them walk slower.
“Oh, so now you love him. Tell me did you love him, when you were walking away? Did you love him, when you almost killed him? Did you love him when you blamed him for Ultron? Please tell me if I’m wrong, but that doesn’t seem to define love,” Ryder suggested.
“Protect me!” Tony screamed. “That’s what you tell yourself? That was not protection. I don’t need your protection. I have never needed anyone’s protection. What I needed was honesty. What I needed was for you to tell me everything and let me deal with the consequences. Sure, would I have blamed Bucky and resented him? Yes. But I would never have tried to kill him or punish him. I would have just needed time, but you took that away from me.”
All of them looked around and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. They gave one more cursory glance.
Clint stared at her and wanted to tell her he had been making an effort. He wanted to tell her that he was trying to make things go back to where they were, but they couldn’t. He didn’t know if he deserved for things to go back the way they were.
“Why do we have to go to you and not Tony first?” Sam questioned eyes looking up from the revised document.
He was breaking up with Ryder because he couldn’t take it anymore. He didn’t want to be like that woman’s brother and end up in some less than desirable situation. He had desired the physical presence of someone that wouldn’t leave, but Tony knew he was better off being alone. Plus he had his son to think about.
Ryder shrugged his shoulders. “We all have our defense mechanisms and if yours is to believe in the false surety of safety offered by your family then who am I to deny you. Miriam be a dear and clean up Tony. He smells dreadful.”
“Alright sweetheart, let’s take a breath,” Steve calmly said, laughter at the forefront of his words. “That all sounds amazing, but you know what sounds even more amazing?”
Steve grinned, settling back and covering his cock up with a generous amount of lube. Tony couldn’t help himself, but lick his lips at the sight. Steve moved forward, hands still wrapped around himself, as he pressed a long and deep kiss to Tony’s mouth.
Steve stepped closer to where Tony had found himself kneeling on the floor. He wrapped his arms around Tony, who didn’t return the embrace. He fought against Steve’s touch, fists coming like blows against Steve’s chest.
Diana looked at Miles and contemplated whether she really wanted to play with someone so young. Since there weren’t too many kids on the playground she agreed.
He did turn it, and things got so much worse. There was a different sketch, this one of a circular orange object. Underneath, in printing so messy it took Tony close to two minutes to decipher, Howard had written ‘The God Stone.’ The next page elaborated on this rather melodramatic title, which turned out to perhaps not be nearly dramatic enough.
He was pulling apart the muffin, which smelled incredible and was still steaming for goodness sake, when Tony flopped gestured expansively to the contract.
He thought about crying off then, because now that seeing Peter and Harley again was such a real and immediate possibility Tony was fucking terrified. The magic, though, seemed not to differentiate between thinking about them and feeling indecisive about actually seeing them, because this particular wave was an onslaught.
Steve’s every muscle ached pleasantly. Even with all of the EDITH-led solo missions he'd taken on lately, it had been ages since he’d felt truly challenged on a physical level. He’d forgotten what it was to get enough of a workout that he felt tired—actually tired—rather than simply taking the edge off the overfull energy stores the serum had gifted and cursed him with. But Bucky and Sam, who between them had super-soldier enhancements, military training, and intimate familiarity with Steve’s fighting techniques? They’d been more than a match for Steve on several occasions, especially when they’d put aside their snarky competitiveness to work together.
Thank you all so very much for your comments, kudos, and questions. It might take me a couple of days to get caught up with replying, but I am very much looking forward to it! <3
“It was nice of you to stay with me. You didn’t have to.” Steve sighed explosively, displaying for the first time the kind of anger Peter had expected to be encountering first thing.
Seeing as Tony was, for once, being truthful about his health status, his ended up being the briefest of Bruce’s checks. He stayed for everyone else’s—Clint was put on a day’s bedrest to avoid further straining his healing ankle, and Bucky was administered super-soldier proof pain meds to treat a broken bone which was already in the process of healing. Then Tony made his way to the penthouse feeling oddly let down. It wasn’t like he had wanted to be detained for hours, but the way Clint had spoken about this whole process with some weird mix of reverence bordering on fear, he’d somehow expected more than being quickly looked at and then dismissed by Bruce.
Tony’s mind and body were both at war with themselves. By the time Clint’s little speech was finished his cock was half-hard, rising as if to seek out more of Clint’s razor-edged voice and his calloused hands and his keen regard that saw so much and gave away so little. This was every fantasy he’d had about Clint over the past few days come to life and turned up to eleven. But it was also terrifying. Tony wasn’t even bound down to anything yet; Clint had really not done any more than talk, and Tony felt more exposed than he’d ever been. His hands fell to his sides, gripping at the sheets in tight fists.
His agent was, however, visibly flourishing in Masdee’s company. Steve had seen hints of this side of Talia—dilligent, eager to please, respectful—but usually only for minutes or even seconds at a time, buried as those traits tended to be under displays of defensive posturing. Masdee, though, drew these things from Talia seemingly without effort or thought. Even in the face of legitimate temptation to do otherwise, Talia had respected Masdee’s authority over how matters would proceed in Wakanda. She’d been visibly pleased, twice now, to receive verbal or non-verbal praise. And unlike at SHIELD, where such behaviours often accompanied by a visible internal struggle on Talia’s part, she appeared utterly at ease with herself. She may, Steve realized, have even been smiling slightly as she thumbed through what he knew to be a thoroughly depressing account of Kaikara and Ochen’s childhoods.
Dr. Chimva has also reserved the right to request other material (including brain/body scans) depending on the results of the original workup.
“Morphine doesn’t work on me, my system burns through it too fast.” Tony winced. Of course this Peter wouldn’t have found a work-around to that issue yet, not without Tony’s help or resources.
“Sure, sugar cookie. You just get settled back at my feet next to Thor the way we discussed and I’d be happy to feed you.”
“He didn’t ever talk about it, so this is just me extrapolating from bits and pieces of ranting over the years. Take it for what it’s worth. But I’m pretty sure Tony had feelings for you. He was probably tempted to come back to you as much as to anyone else. Just like Peter, you’re welcome to continue being pissed off that he didn’t. To be honest, I really don’t care. But whatever relationship you end up having with his memory, you need to decide right now to stop letting it interfere with your relationship with his kid. You made a commitment to him, Rogers. My Mom, she used to say family isn’t a one time thing. It’s a choice you make and then you keep making every single day. To put someone else first, above everyone and everything else. It’s damn hard work. Tony was a genius at this age too and I practically raised him, so believe me when I tell you it’d be a full time job even without all the freaky spider stuff.”
He meant for Tony to fetch a cloth, but Phil should not have been surprised that Tony opted for a different method, nuzzling his way between Phil’s legs and beginning to lick at the slick patches of spend (his own and Clint’s) on his thighs. He spared a lazy thought for whether their sweet, orally-fixated submissive might go in for full-on cock nursing, but if that worked he suspected it would
Steve looked out toward the ocean as he considered his answer. It had been so long since this topic had even come up; he was sure Tony still had some lingering insecurities about potential comparisons, but more and more he seemed to be realizing that he was loved on his own terms, not as an imperfect mirror of someone else.
Eventually, when he felt somehow both near sleep and intensely awake, Tony was rolled onto his back. The position wasn’t a simple mirror of how he had been on his front; he lay with his back against Clint, inclined upward enough that he could watch with hooded eyes as Thor and Phil slid a pillow under his hips, then another under each of his knees after they spread them and pulled them into a slight bend. He whined lazily at the latter, which caused Clint to chuckle in his hear.
None of this, however, meant it was any less frustrating to watch Peter walk (well, limp—Tony had just barely restrained himself from remarking on the fact that it was clearly too soon after his injuries for Peter to be webbing his way across the city after anyone, let alone Toomes) out of the Tower. The irony of the fact that he’d spent so long pushing one version of Peter away and now found himself fighting the urge to cling to another was a horrible kind of irony. He gave sleep up as a bad job after less than forty-five minutes of lying there and tasting regret like bitter metal in the back of his throat.
A loud splash echoed the room; Clint and Rhodey seemed to bring out the kid in one another, and from what Tony had gathered, they were in the middle of some kind of diving contest. Or was it dunking? It was hard to focus much on the details when Bucky’s gaze had turned hungry, and his hold a little more possessive.
“I don’t know if I want to spank him or fuck him more,” Bucky declared to fevered nods and murmured agreement from the rest of the team. For his part, Steve sat frozen in his seat as the news replayed the clip of Tony denouncing CNOW and categorically denying the possibility of his company’s future relationship with them.
Given that he’d had no idea that top-drop was even a thing that could happen until his Dominant was in the midst of it right in front of him, Tony thought he’d done fairly well. Of course, Bruce had been the one to actually do the majority of the work, but Tony had at least had the presence of mind to realize that Steve would probably find it reassuring to see Tony checked over by an actual doctor.
“God no! I’ve heard enough stories to know I likely would never have even had the chance to meet him were it not for you and Rhodes. I’m nothing but grateful to you, Pepper, and I’m sorry that we—that I did a poor job of showing it. I know better, now, and I promise I’m going to do better. Starting with asking for your input.” He tapped the holotable between them and opened several screens, one of which he maximized while sending the others into a corner. “This is from an agent of mine in Wakanda, on behalf of her Dominant and CO. Princess Shuri was contacted two days ago and asked to provide the most senior member of her medical staff. Specifically, the requesting agency wanted someone familiar with DNA, classification testing, and identity confirmation.”
Phil set the stack of paperwork he was filling out onto the couch next to him. Even this simple act was done with the kind of precision and care than most people took with far more delicate procedures. Though its mechanisms were unclear to anyone but Phil himself, there was a definite logic in the order he put each sheet of paper down, patiently and all without a single bend or crease; there were no flags or post-its to serve as visual organizational cues, but Tony doubted the other man needed them. He didn’t even seem to need to look at the pages themselves to confirm their content. The pages themselves were probably for someone else’s benefit, Tony mused, not Coulson’s. When he arrived at the last collection of documents, Coulson kept it in his hand and looked at Tony for the first time.
While many expected this announcement to be followed by an intense press tour full of intimate sit-down interviews, or a more aggressive presence at SI from Stark himself, the Avengers’ PR staff instead announced early this morning that the team intends to take a month long leave of absence. Their specific destination was not provided, but the purpose of this extended break is hardly a mystery: as Tony Stark himself made clear, he and his partners are still healing from the events of recent years, and obviously wish for both privacy and time to focus on that process.
With Coulson’s departure for SHIELD, Tony found himself entirely alone in the Tower for the first time since arriving in this universe. It was the best chance he was probably going to get to leave undetected, and he gave the possibility real consideration as he wandered down to the shop. If he stuck around much longer, he was going to start getting attached to this version of the team, who was so close to his own and yet nothing like them at all. As Tony didn’t really have anything to work on down here (he’d completed his repairs and upgrades to Rhodey’s armour several days prior), he ended up perched on one of the benches, patting absently at Butterfingers.
“I didn’t know, Tony, I would never out someone on purpose. I was chasing down a lead about your college admissions paperwork; something seemed off, and I thought maybe your Father had, I don’t know, forged your test scores, maybe? Tried to make you seem smarter than you really were? By the time I realized what it was I was actually uncovering I stopped, I tried to convince my editor to just drop the story, but she just assigned the piece to a new writer and used everything I’d found. All our work is on a shared drive and I couldn’t remove it in time.”
Tony didn’t want to turn the page. He didn’t want to imagine a man he had laughed and joked with just this afternoon in this much pain, and he definitely didn’t want to let himself wonder how Howard still could have ended up feeling so indifferent towards his own son when he’d fought so hard to help bring Tony into the world.
Your comments, kudos and questions remain wonderful bright spots even on more challenging days. Thanks to all of you who make this fandom such a wonderful home to keep coming back to, and I hope you're all staying safe and well!
Which was how Steve had found himself inside one of the numerous Iron Man armours that dotted the penthouse. Each member of the team had allowed themselves to be spotted outside the armour a few times (none of Taskmaster’s people would have been foolish enough to believe the team would abandon Tony when they were facing a threat like this.) They also made sure to let several of the suits be taken out early, so that the invading forces could find them empty and assume all the suits were unmanned. Meanwhile, the team spent the majority of the battle hopping in and out of different suits. To avoid tipping their hand by having Taskmaster recognize any of their fighting styles, JARVIS mostly controlled the actual actions of the suits. He was just as vicious as Steve had seen him be on the day the other Tony had died, if slightly more restrained.
“Before this goes any further I’m going to have to demand that you tell me that I am cool in every universe. I mean, I’ve always known it to be true, but it would be nice to have confirmation, you know?”
“You can come as soon as Steve and Thor do, honey,” he promised, and Tony all but sobbed out his gratitude. The vibration of that was enough to finish Thor off only a few seconds later. Steve allowed his own thrusts become greedy and uneven, chasing orgasm with abandon now, and he bellowed Tony’s name as he came. As Bruce’s hand brought Tony closer to his own release, he shook his head, trying to fight it off the way that Steve had found he so often did, as if afraid to let the pleasure all the way in.
“Well, this is a first. I’ve heard you come up with a lot of ideas I disagreed with, Tony, but never one so goddamn stupid.” Tony flinched as if he’d been struck, because it felt worse than a physical blow to have this version of Steve, the man he loved and respected beyond anything, speak to him like this, even if (especially) Tony deserved it.
“Permission to alter the Thursday protocol?” Phil had drank almost half a bottle of scotch single-handedly, so the formality of this request would have once surprised many in the room. But like his teammates, Clint had long since learned that until his lover reached the tipping point into complete inebriation, his diction and speech tended to grow more, not less, precise. (Probably about a 6 on the scale, then.)
“So this is where you ended up, huh? Doesn’t seem like Tony to not have made better arrangements for you.” DUM-E made another noise, this one a beep that sounded almost like a whine. Quickly, he withdrew his hand, unwilling to face the potential that Tony had not just the world grieving for his absence, but his own bots as well. “Hey, I get it. I expected…well, definitely nothing about how things have played out. But look, there’s no reason for you guys to be shoved in a corner like this. FRIDAY, lights to 50%. These their charging stations over here? Talk me through setting them up, would you?”
“Gonna get yourself spanked if you don’t watch out,” Steve said. “Snarking on Phil about communication? Really?” Tony didn’t response beyond a snicker and a sloppy kiss pressed against the column of Steve’s neck. Steve, meanwhile, focused on attempting to control both his hands and his racing thoughts. He wanted to wait until their upcoming date, wanted so badly to do things right, but God Tony was testing him today. Steve had seen him post-scene before, of course, but the combination of getting regular time in headspace and bonding with another submissive had Tony loose and playful in a way Steve had never seen before. Tony, he realized with a delighted start, was learning to accept his headspace enough that he didn’t mentally check-out or fall asleep once a scene was over. And while non-verbal, dozy Tony had his own charms, this…this was on another level.
“Cap—err, is it Major?” Steve had had slightly higher hopes for Jordan, he really had. No one had anything but absolutely glowing praise for the man, a six foot three category eight dominant from Kansas who was looking to enlist with SHIELD straight out of college. But this was why he agreed whole-heartedly with the HR people that it was important he be here for at least a part of the intake interviews: it wasn’t always easy to predict who would suddenly turn overtly fannish when confronted with Steve.
“Alright then. Take 24 hours and decide if you wish me to communicate a message to your own universe, or begin the process of researching how to return you to them.”
“Yeah. He did. And if you need to be pissed at him forever about leaving you then that’s your business, kid. I’m not going to try to convince you otherwise, and I won’t let Tony do it either.” He pauses just long enough that AI-Tony could speak if he wanted. He doesn’t. “What I do know is that he loved you. As much as he was able, in ways that weren’t always healthy or fair, Tony loved you. Tony was also raised by a man who was broken the entirety of his child’s life, and he very nearly took Tony down with him. And whether you agree with his choice or not, I think he truly believed—believes, wherever he is—that the best way he could love you now was to be healthy and whole somewhere else rather than broken with you.”
, baked pastries full of cabbage and cheese, accompanied by a borsht soup that she appeared to be trying to teach Clint to make;
And speaking of Toomes, how had he managed to get on both Tony and Peter’s radars while staying off of SHIELD’s? Steve was going to have a whole lot of questions for the New York team come Monday morning.
Some of the tension drained from Thor’s shoulders the moment they were buckled around his wrists—the constant effect bondage had on his partner was predictable and welcome to Steve, who reached out and touched his cheek.
The next day, Steve ran several miles above his average to work out some of his anxiety through sheer physical exhaustion. Then he showered, ordered the dishes JARVIS said had were Tony’s favourites from the Korean place on 51st, and made his way to the media room where the AI informed him Tony had been all afternoon. It seemed uncharacteristic of Tony to have spent the day watching movies when they had a time sensitive problem on their hands—and why not just stay in the penthouse instead of the theatre-style space they never used unless they had company that included small children?
After dropping that rather remarkable bit of news, Rhodes shifted his chair back several inches from Steve as if he preparing to be hit. And honestly, Steve expected at least some degree of jealousy to flare up at the news that the other man hadn’t needed an invitation from either Tony’s current partners to feel responsible to and for him. (How could he summon any of that resentment, though, when Rhodey had proven his constancy and love across all universes, even the ones where the team had failed Tony?)
, too. Steve had been elated to learn how often he donated his work to organizations for low-income partners who would normally never be able to afford custom collars. He also made a lot of designs that accommodated a range of body types; Kala’s shop was one of only three in the city that made collars for those with necks wider than the industry standards, and he also worked frequently to make unique pieces for those who couldn’t or chose not to wear leather, or who couldn’t wear things around their necks.
The longer Tony spoke, the more he started to see the holes in the plan. It was probably weird to ask for the wedding, which was ostensibly the only one of the ceremonies not about Dominance and submission at all, to be in a space designed to honour someone who had placed those needs above all others, even her own freedom. Not to mention it would be way more efficient to just do both ceremonies on the same day, and given that Tony was the one forcing them to have two separate ceremonies in the first place, that was probably the least he could do. Steve cleared his throat, cutting through the mental noise in the way only he could.
“Because baba is somewhere I can’t do that right now, okay? But know I miss you so much okay and I love you,” Tony rasped.
Steve and Tony made sure to do one more double-check of their items, before they were fine with checking out. Miles made one last effort to get some fruit snacks, but Tony remained strong in his decision. Maybe they would come back next week and get the fruit snacks.
Steve looked down at Tony. His body writhed below him, face scrunched up in a type of satisfaction that Steve was thankful only he got to bring to Tony. Steve reached between them to grab at Tony, fingers swiping at the slit and causing Tony’s body to arch forward, sending Steve just a little deeper.
He had enjoyed that look of haunting desperation on Ryder’s face. He had marveled at how Ryder appeared to just wilt before him. He hated the fact that Ryder still believed Tony would come for him.
They watched as Ryder and Tony stumbled outside of a room. Ryder looked startled at the three people in front of him and he leaned against the wall. Steve ran his eyes over Tony making sure he was physically fine.
“Ah, it’s fine,” Peter said though wanting to argue that it really wasn’t. “Just know he can’t eat oranges or anything hard and spherical. It’s easy for them to accidentally choke on things like that. I can write down all the things he can’t eat, if that would make things easier for you? I know Tony used to have those things written on the refrigerator, but it looks like someone removed it. Probably because everyone’s had it memorized by now.”
Tony pretended to think this over, even at some point sharing a series of facial expression with Natasha all of which meant nothing, but were hilarious to act out. Finally, Tony pulled back and nodded.
Bucky hummed in agreeance. “Yeah, that would probably be the best. So are you making dinner for Tony and the kids?”
“Don’t you fucking dare interrupt me, when I am talking to you. You know what’s a joke is you wearing this gift of Steve’s. What’s this him branding you as his,” Ryder said tugging on the bracelet on Tony’s wrist. “I noticed it wasn’t there, when I first saw you. But it was when you two came back.”
“Add mine to the list. Midtown cafeteria food sucks,” Harley gripped. “Why didn’t you tell me that Peter?”
Tony looked back and smiled smugly. Steve raised an eyebrow and raised a hand as though motioning that Tony should carry on. Tony made it three steps, three shaking steps might he had, before his legs buckled underneath him. Steve was there within a second, arms wrapping around his waist. He tried reigning in laughter over the fact that Tony looked like a newborn gazelle learning to walk for the first time. He knew his laughter would not be appreciated.
Miriam smiled darkly. Choosing not to say anything, she opened her suitcase and in it revealed bottles of different alcoholic beverages. Tony immediately felt anger. He had been working on his sobriety for years and he would be damned if it would all go to waste by these two women. Miriam grabbed one bottle and closely inspected it.
“Aww, such a disappointment. And here I was thinking you would finally let your hair down a little and let me play. Tony does after all, such a nice little plaything for us just getting him ready for Ryder…”
“Good so sit back and listen Mr. Rogers,” Isa hissed. “Do you want the police to run around the city with no rules?”
Tony refused to play this game any longer. He refused to make it seem as though he was truly oblivious and that Ryder was that great of an actor. He had been a little unsure toward the beginning of the conversation, with how comfortable Ryder had seemed by it all.
There was one particular lazy Saturday morning where he decided to make breakfast…rather loudly…and well Steve was immediately reminded of Natasha’s skill with knives.
“Oh, Miriam please stop. I’m sure Steve doesn’t want to hear all that,” Ryder whispered abashedly, averting his eyes back to the document he was signing.
“It’ll be fine. No need to be nervous you’ve done grand openings before,” Rhodey said, removing his hands from Tony’s so that he could eat his remaining French fries.
Tony quickly stepped aside and tried shaking his head from the fog that had settled over his eyes. He turned to Sharon and gave her his full attention.
There in that folder was just all of the documentation, photos, transcripts of an interview with Tony.  He had remembered Tony leaving briefly two days ago, for a few hours. Is this what he had been doing? Some of the photos looked like Tony had taken them himself.
“This looks awfully a lot like a date,” Ryder exclaimed angrily as he came upon Steve and Tony. “Is there something I should be made aware of?”
He pulled down Tony’s underwear and ran a finger around Tony. “He’d probably be so gentle making sure you’re fully stretched. And just when you feel like you can’t even take his fingers, he looks at you again for permission then enters you,” Ryder moaned.
“Okay, I sent some of the pics to you,” Peter said. “Also Pepper just texted in the group text and she said she’s keeping Tony occupied and that you owe her so many new shoes, cause he’s already driving her up a wall.”
“Peter school comes first. We’ve already talked about this. May is allowing you to keep this side job in return that your school work doesn’t suffer. Look if you have anything you need to get handled let me know. Maybe you can take a break during weekdays and just focus on your education. Then like on a few weekends and a few days in the summer you can go back to your full slinging webs and sticking on buildings.”
“I want to have forever with you and so it hurts me, when you don’t feel the same. It hurts me, when I see you with other people even if you are just naturally flirtatious. It shouldn’t anger me so and I should not react to you in a violent manner. You’re right I shouldn’t have raised my hand at Miles. I hope you can forgive me like I can forgive you for cheating on me.”
“Yeah, cause you worked oh so hard on that spaghetti. Truly, I see Master Chef in your future,” Bucky teased. “But did Tony tell you that he’d rather be here than with Ryder?”
Steve immediately got up and walked slowly out of the waiting room, ignoring the concerned glances of everyone else. Once out of sight, he quickly ran to the restroom. He swung open the door and ran to the toilet expelling all of the nonexistent contents he had in his stomach.
Silence encompassed the room as the two thought about what Tony said. Rhodey was the first to speak.
Tony looked up to Steve, eyes bright with unshed tears. He looked back down toward the bracelet not wanting Steve to see him cry.
By then the two were standing up, with Steve briskly following Tony around. To anyone else they looked like two children playing a game of tag. Karen watched as they passed her and shook her head amusedly before returning to her conversation with one of the donors.
Silence passed. Tony’s brow furrowed at the question. Why did they have to ask? Couldn’t they just look at him and see that he was fine. He was fine. No, he was better than fine. They all found him. Ryder was out of his life. Case closed.
“Yes, everything’s good. I was just asking if it would be fine if I could go to the movies with MJ,” Peter rushed out.
Steve remained silent, only choosing to sit opposite of Tony. He kept opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water. Tony delighted in this small sense of uncomfortableness coming from Steve.
“I’m just going to talk to you through your mind and hopefully you can help us find where Tony is, yeah?”
“I’m here. I’m here,” Steve whispered. Tony’s breathing was still a little haggard and it made Steve worry about the exertion he may be placing on his lungs. “Hey, sweetheart. Can you match my breathing?”
Steve’s eyes grew heavy and he became tempted to fall asleep right there. However, he didn’t know how Tony would respond to waking up with Steve still in his bed. He had wanted Steve to be there until he feel asleep, so that’s probably what he should do.
“Oh, Winston was here. He’s moved up faster than I thought,” Miriam addressed to Cali who was trying to make herself seem small.
Why going to take your girlfriend on a date? Finally admitting that your legs aren’t the only thing getting stretched out.
His hands hovered above his body not wanting to touch it…not wanting any evidence of what had happened when his eyes felt shut. A broken cry caught itself in Tony’s throat and almost choked him.
The three of them then left to go to Harley’s classroom. Harley silently entered the classroom and said goodbye to neither his classmates nor his teacher. However, that didn’t stop them from excitedly telling Harley they would see him on Monday.
Without any warning Tony’s head was forced down into the warm water resting in the bathtub. His eyes opened on instinct and his body inhaled a gulp of water. He struggled against Eva’s hold and tried latching onto skin and found a piece to claw at. Then his body was springing forward outside of the water.
“Look I’m going to Karen’s in a bit, so I don’t really have time for a heart to heart right now. Maybe later?”
A sharp gasp escaped his lips as Tony was brought back to the land of consciousness. Instead of Dr. Sana’s office he was in his bedroom. The question she asked was still at the forefront of his mind, going unanswered as he adjusted to being awake again.
“It’s either bring Tony in or let Isak go,” Coulson stated, not wanting to agree with Fury on this, but not knowing how to solve this situation any other way. “It’s the last thing I want to do. Trust me, but unless we have valid verbal proof it will look like Captain America and his Avengers are coercing a civilian to admit criminal offenses, due to emotion and the public will turn on us.”
Natasha nodded solemnly. “Well, it’s never too late to make amends. Who knows what the future might hold?”
“But you’re a part of his circle,” Steve grit out still holding Miriam by the lapels of her jacket. “I do not have time to be playing this game with you.”
She had seen firsthand what could happen on both sides of the coin after one’s abuser was dealt with. She had no doubt that Tony wasn’t aware of her increased presence. At first she was concerned that Tony would be cautious of her increased presence, but Tony hadn’t much minded.
“I don’t think you did,” Steve exclaimed. He stepped closer to Ryder. “I’ve known Tony longer than you. I get that you were friends in college, but you don’t know him. So you can’t speak for him or claim to know his best interests.”
“Yes. I have never been interested in men. I know my brother was open to everyone. He was always more free as a child. Have to say though his relationship with Tony might have been the most healthy one he’s had in a while.”
Steve comfortingly patted Natasha on the shoulder twice, before heading to Tony’s lab. That had been Peter’s place of comfort, since the news of Tony’s kidnapping. Steve had attempted in easing the concerns of the two teenagers by distancing themselves from the situation. Unfortunately, there was no way one could be distanced from having a noticeable gap in their lives. Pepper had been great in watching over Miles and Harley. She had decided that she could help by watching over the young boys, while maintaining SI business. News had gotten out that Tony had to cancel a lot of his upcoming meetings so she had to deal with that, on the added fear of knowing why he was really absent.
Ryder looked down sadly at Tony. “You know I hate to do this to you Tony. I never wanted to hurt you,” he choked on a cry. “But you drove me to this. You and your father.”
Coulson made his way in the small cell and positioned himself in the dark corner of it. Natasha nodded once at him in acknowledgment of his presence, before turning her attention back to the girl.
“Pre-serum Steve had less control of his response to bullies,” Bucky grit out knowing exactly the headspace that Steve was returning to. “And let’s just say underestimating him is when you lost the fight. I mean sure there were a lot of times that I had to get involved, but that’s because those bullies never took him there…to this place.”
Steve walked through the tower, having taken a shower already feeling greatly refreshed. He guessed the others were right in him needing to leave for a bit. Though a quick bit. Seconds away from Tony already felt like too much. He knew he still had hours, before the boys came and left. So Tony was in good hands for now, but that didn’t make the desire to go back to him lessen in any way, shape, or form.
“Now why on earth would I tell you that?” Ryder questioned. “Don’t want you running away from me, after all of the fun that I have in store for you.”
Tony sputtered and strongly tried ignoring how his heart jumped in his chest. He had hopes that what he had read from Steve’s letter was true. Of course he also told himself not to read too much into it. Though now…perhaps with Steve actually here maybe he was being honest in his letter.
“And I also saw that. Like I said you’re just a child,” Natasha said leaning back and pulling Tony slightly into her.
“I suggest you do as we have been asking, one more time. Confess that you are Ryder or I’ll leave a mark on your tongue for every single lie you have told since you first entered Tony’s life. Then I might get a bit creative and leave some more on your body. I’ve been told I am quite the artist. Guess, it’s time to add body artist to my portfolio.”
He went down to the gym, knowing exactly what he needed. He went through about forty punching bags in one hour, just all imagining them as Ryder’s face. He wondered if Bucky or Natasha would teach him how to use a knife in some creative ways. He wondered how many ways he could perfect, before the five day time span was up.
Her sentence was cut off as Steve tightened the grasp on Miriam’s neck. This only served to amuse Miriam as she huffed out sharp breaths. Steve’s eyes, alight with anger, rested at the spot between Miriam’s eyebrows.
“Oh, is this how Bucky forgot his and Sam’s two year anniversary?” Natasha said, sitting down at the table and helping Steve untangle the lights.
“And that would have been your fault. Again. You wonder why all your family is gone? It’s because you make decisions like this without any guidance.”
But Ryder had never gotten the chance to fuck Tony, when they were in college. Maybe that’s why when he first came back into his life, he was ready to share that part of himself with Ryder. It was him being allowed to have part of that bit of his youth back. He hoped that his promises of taking care of him in that respect would have been true, but it hadn’t been. Tony had only seen that, when Ryder took him apart with no care of how uncomfortable Tony had been. Tony had always wondered if his parents hadn’t come over that next morning, if his first time letting Ryder in would have been as amazing as Ryder insisted and not as painful as the real version that he had experienced.
“Look don’t lose hope. I am certain you will all find Tony and we will all be arguing in our group chat, which by the way I’m still highly upset I’ve been reduced to using primitive methods of communicating.”
He then wondered what would happen if he told Rhodey that he had tried telling him about Ryder before. He could just imagine Rhodey’s eyes feeling with shame and guilt. Tony couldn’t do that to Rhodey. He was already going through so much. Tony couldn’t possibly add to that. So he had to make sure he never let it out that he tried to tell them. They didn’t need that added stress. Tony would just have to keep it to himself. He was pretty good at that.
Principal Davis leaned forward and rested his elbows on his desk. “Yes, and that is what counseling will be provided for.”
They finally found Miriam eight days after Tony was taken. It had been hard getting a location on her, seeing as though she hadn’t worked at the hospital in a few days. Steve had implored that the hospital staff tell him whenever Miriam was set to have a shift and he also placed a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on standby just in case she chose to arrive earlier.
The woman’s face paled greatly. “Of course,” she said. Then as if realizing Steve was there, she turned toward him and held her hand out to shake. “Hi, I’m the head nurse, Miriam,” she greeted warmly shaking Steve’s hand.
“Yes,” Pepper said tugging him forward. “If you’re a good boy, I’ll take you to that bakery and get you some treats for you, Steve, and the kids.”
Miles nodded his head eagerly. “Okay baba. No more cookies for me. Here Peter,” he said taking the rest of his cookie and holding it up to Peter’s mouth.
Steve inhaled shakily rubbing his hands with the back of his palms. He felt the unevenness from where there was dried up blood caking in between has handprint. For a few seconds, he kept his palms at the balls of his eyes just trying to escape any source of light that could stream through.
“Slow down Harls, you’ll get yourself a stomach ache. And okay, that’s fine. I can drop you off and Tony can just drop Miles off so we aren’t having to rush him, okay?” Steve said, grabbing a muffin that Bucky had set outside for all of them.
Steve stepped closer, relishing in the fact that there was now no space between them. “I nearly can’t remember a time I spent not loving you. I only regret that I didn’t do this sooner.”
Also Tony’s ears felt clogged up and his tongue felt heavy. He wanted to insert a joke and say it was left over from the time he brought a one night stand over and things got a little heated. He didn’t say anything, in fear that his transparency would leak over into his ability to actually lie. He hadn’t wanted to tell them how this huge hole in the wall was from the time Ryder had shoved his body so hard against the wall that his should popped.
“You need to leave Mr. Stark,” Cali explained looking for Tony’s shoes. “And I don’t know if you’ll have another opportunity to actually get away before Ryder comes back and you both try acting as though nothing happened here.”
“No, it was really great, actually. It’s just—” Tony stopped mid-sentence to take out his phone, and whatever he found there brought a look of almost vicious satisfaction to his features. He lifted it to his ear and started talking without having dialed a number, which meant he had to be speaking to JARVIS. “Have the legion monitor the building for any sign that Toomes is moving out…yeah, him too. Thanks buddy.”
“Good boy.” Just as he had in the privacy of his own room, Tony’s body responded to the praise like he’d been electrocuted. Except now Clint was here to see, and there was not a chance in the world that he’d missed how his words had affected Tony. (Hawkeye never fucking missed.) “Now isn’t that something. You talk a big game, Tony, all tough and shit, but deep down you just wanna be my good boy, hmm?” Tony shook his head in denial and reached down to grab at his own dick, to seize back some measure of control. Clint knocked his hand away almost lazily.
“And yes, questions. All the questions. The memo says a whole bunch of things about your program trying to force people to change their orientations and submit at work. I’m positive that’s not what it’s doing, but can you tell me what it is doing, and what the hell Wakanda has to do with anything?”
Tony woke with that uncanny feeling where his body knew it was in the wrong place while his mind was still working to catch up. This was kind of unexpected in its own way; he wouldn’t have thought he’d been in this version of the Tower’s master bedroom for enough cumulative nights for his mind to have reset itself, but then again it was basically his old room with a couple of minor shifts..
Yes, there was quite a lot still to do indeed. But for now Phil was perfectly content to praise and pet his submissive for just a while longer.
“Good. Yes. Hi. Kente cloth was developed by which cultural group?” Peter waited a few seconds for the multiple-choice options. The girl grinned. Undoubtedly she wanted to make him look like an idiot, and she would more than likely succeed. However, he was pretty sure he knew this one, so at least he’d have some dignity left when this was over.
In the wake of what felt like a shattering of himself, time became a distant, abstracted concept. Tony was vaguely aware of the soiled towel being removed, and Bruce bracing him around the waist to slow his face-first collapse onto the bench. He knew Bruce was speaking, too, but as he didn’t seem particularly surprised or upset by Tony’s general lack of responsiveness. So Tony let himself drift.
Content Notes: There are two scenes in response #3. The first contains a scene in which D/s verse Tony fails to safeword when necessary. It also contains a brief mention, though no direct representation, of a former abusive relationship Tony was in with Sunset Baine. Feel free to skip if either of these are trigger areas for you, or let me know if you need more information before deciding whether to read. The second scene in that response includes the use of a safeword (which is, of course, respected and treated safely and kindly.)
“Twenty with the belt now, sweet boy.” He unbuckled the leather and teased Phil with it for a couple of of minutes, trailing it down his back and against his sides and across the heated skin of his ass. Phil’s legs flexed, toes curling against the footrests of the stand as he visibly fought between twin urges to press up towards Steve and remain still to avoid further stimulation from the cock sleeve.
After nearly two years of self-neglect and denial, the instinct to deny JARVIS’s description of the situation was strong. Surely this wasn’t top-drop, Steve was just a bit foggy this morning, that’s all, and maybe he should have eaten a bit more before he went to bed. His eyes found the arc reactor again, the memory of Tony handing it to him with so much trust and bravery just as powerful as it had been then. (Tony trusted Steve. He couldn’t betray that now by lying, not even if the thought of waking his peacefully sleeping lover made Steve ache all over with shame and regret.)
“You know him? Spiderman?” Steve asked, gaze darting between Natasha and Tony. She was the one to nod after first giving Tony several seconds to offer any information he wished. Steve hated the way that Tony seemed to be making himself smaller by the second, curling in on himself as if eventually, if he found the right configuration, he might just blink right out of existence.
Eventually, they wound up in an elevator. Tony selected one of the dozen levels all marked as training facilities.
Several members of the team had been in favour of making the collar entirely on their own. They probably had enough skills between them to do it, but they were unevenly distributed enough that some people would likely have felt far more included and involved than others. Phil had been the one to veto that particular plan after finding an exhausted Clint trying to read up on the basics of leatherworking in the vents at SHIELD.
. Actually empty. Everyone we’d ever put away, on solo missions or as a team…one of ‘em made it through the breastplate my uniform, I remember because Tony had just upgraded it and I was thinking about how angry he was gonna be. How I’d probably have to dig him out of the shop—he always took it so hard when our tech or our suits didn’t hold up in a fight. He wanted to protect everyone…he used to go to hospitals and cuddle the babies, you know.”
“You can’t seriously be planning to execute Clint’s plan?” Clint’s outrage doubled at that, and he vowed to refuse to put out for Steve for at least two weeks. Phil rolled his eyes.
When Clint finally made his way back to the bed (still fully dressed, the bastard), he was holding two short lengths of rope in one hand, and two leather cuffs in the other. He set them down on Tony’s bare chest, then sat down on a wooden chair next to the bed and arched a brow in silent question. As soon as Tony reached out to touch the cuffs, he knew he was lost. The rope seemed perfectly fine, but the leather was butter-soft and thick and it smelled the way that only the high quality stuff did. He was also fairly certain he’d seen Thor wearing them at some point. Clint confirmed this when he asked.
