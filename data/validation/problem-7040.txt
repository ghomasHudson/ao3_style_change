Stunned at his words, Tony just seemed able to stare at him in contemplation. Or was that adoration? Steve hoped for the last because he was sure that's the way he was gazing upon Tony.
“Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes” he politely greeted the moment he was at a decent hearing distance while extending his hand for a shake. He wasn’t surprised when his unwilling host didn’t take it.
So! I wasn't sure to post this chapter two as it is. First, because the first part was already published in the one-shot, and second, because of the explanation of the power of the name thing. Why? because that plays a role in the looong story, but it won't have much meaning in the few chapters I'm going to upload. At the end, I decided to put almost everything as it is as a promise to myself that I'll keep writing and finish this one day. Hope you don't mind that nor the cliffhanger!
, together, are going to get past through this, even if I understand if you are still mad at me. I swear I’m sorry and that it won't happen again. Dame or no dame.”
“Okay, okay, calm down, keep your panties up, I'll explain: we had a date, at that fucking restaurant,” he said pointing at the now shriveled newspaper as if it offended him, “I was working late, so I told him I’d see him there. Regardless of my best efforts I was 30 minutes late, but considering my record, he probably was expecting it; I was giving my keys to the Valet Parking and when I looked over for our usual table – in the corner and next to the window –, he was there, kissing that… woman. She had her arms around his neck and he had his hands over her hips. I freaked out. I snatched my keys back from the poor boy and decided to drive all night so my head could believe my eyes or whatever.” Then he looked over himself as if appraising his attire for the first time, "The shirt will have to be a story between drinks. Strong drinks." He finished with a fake smirk. “Then I came here and the rest is history.”
“Before you ask why I’m here: I just don’t want to stay in the Tower right now and I can’t go back to the Malibu mansion because I have an important and boring meeting this morning and Pepper would fucking skin me alive if I don’t show up in time.” Rhodey was about to comment on the billionaire’s babbling when Tony asked, “Do you have coffee?” and without waiting for an answer, he went into the kitchen in search for his equivalent of a Holly Grail.
not better than ‘Thug-number-one’ or ‘Scarred-face’, by the way. Was it Tony’s imagination or Bates’ scar was shaped like a small hydra? God, Tony didn’t know if his terrible headache was because of the fanaticism or if he’d taken a stronger-than-usual hit to the head; either way, he was definitely fucking feeling it.
“And why ‘Tony’?” James asked perhaps, Steven thought, founding the nickname too disturbing from his original name, especially for a lord. He obviously thought that a normal noble would go for ‘sweetheart’ or ‘darling’ and leave his name intact. It just proved how little James knew Anthony.
“Maybe that’s why I’m trying so hard for you to approve us being together,” at Rhodes poorly disguised confused expression, Steve elaborated, “Because I know what it means to care for someone to the point of wanting to shield them even from themselves. It’s even easier to understand you when it’s the same person we’re worrying about.
After a few moments of stunned silence on Tony's part, obviously not knowing what to say at Steve's words, the supersoldier decided to help him a little.
“What can I say? I’m a handsome omega.” Anthony half-joked because they both knew how true that was. “But you never led me to believe you were that possessive.”
, was his first thought. The red, blue and white were replaced by full-on black. His hair looked darker as if it had toned down the blond sunshine that it used to be in order to match its owner’s transition to a darker life. His now-bearded face did nothing to hide the sharper, unforgiving and full of rage look of the supersoldier. Finally, he held a grey disc as a weapon that matched his dark uniform; similar to his symbolic shield but not quite the same.
Instead, he tightened his grip until he saw a small wince show on Tony’s face, and then he squeezes a little more until the genius stopped struggling in order to glare a Steve freely. As Tony allowed some twisted version of calm take over his features, Steve was able to relent his hold enough for it not to hurt anymore without losing any ground, "Calm down, let's talk for once."
“He’s just trying to be a good friend and look after me, you know that, right?” Tony asked hopefully. Steve couldn’t help but feel worse at how blind he had been to be unable to see such an amazing person as the one standing before him; even when trying to please Steve by telling him what he wanted to know, he would still show loyalty to his best friend trying at the same time to defend his actions. He was still trying to make Steve understand how much Rhodes meant to him.
The injured animal recovered fast and with all the rage that only an animal could possess, it made to attack the brunette again. It was an unexpected turn of events when instead of Anthony having his throat bitten out, he got to hear a choked wail instead.
And it hit Steve like Thor’s thunder; Tony was thinking about what would happen if they got together and then broke up. He was willing to put aside his desire to be happy with Steve in order to protect what all the Avengers had worked so hard to build. To maintain the status-quo that they both had broken over and over again with their fighting and general pettiness.
More background building for the main, sorry about that. I hope you guys still liked it and that you'll leave tons of comments and kudos to inspire me to edit faster.
Anthony was a genius; educated in all arts, but excelling in all sciences. Steven barely knew how to read and write, and that was because Anthony taught him so he could try to read the same books he did while they were apart and thinking about the other. Not that Steven was stupid, far from it; Anthony considered him one of the most intelligent people he knew, maybe not cultured, but intelligent like nought. It was the fact that Steven had been left alone the moment his mother died when he had been barely ten years old, that he’d had to fend for himself.
It was something in the wording of the last phraise that had Steve understanding just how important Rhodes was to Tony. No ‘fuck off!’, nor ‘go stick your nose wherever it’s your business’, not even ‘leave
I ask you once again that if you see a grammar error or something of the like, please do inform me so I can correct it since English is not my first language.
A week later, after all the necessary preparations and Wanda’s blessing, Steve had the small purple vial ready for use.
“Peter, get away from him!” Tony yelled at his son in terror. No, please, Peter was just beside the Winter Soldier; he was going to kill his son just as he had killed his parents in cold blood, “Now!”
! That's the way it is and the way that is better for everyone involved! I think it’s time for you to accept it and
Looking at the horses’ impatience, Steven realized how late he was and he finished stuffing the last of the animal food faster. “Now, come on! We are late for everything, give me a hand.”
“You wouldn’t,” Rogers said completely sure of himself. Rhodey was now more than ready to forget his gun and go for the sniper rifle just to prove how wrong the captain was. “Tony wouldn’t let you.” he added.
Without saying anymore, he went out of the door happily, following the ruckus that was already happening upstairs.
“Well, even if I didn’t win the bet, I can say the show was worth my money.” Spider-Woman broke the silence with a satisfied smile and looked over at them leeringly. The look alone made shivers crawl up Steve's back.
off.” He tried to slam the door in his face, but the cheating bastard’s reflexes still were of a super-soldier and kept the door open.
“I was there when it happened, okay?!” Tony exploded jumping to stand and making the chair fall backwards with a loud crash. “I was fucking there when they were kissing!”
And that's it for now. This is my first R rated fic ever and I blushed while writing every word so please do comment on my success/failure.
“That’s just-” Steve had a hard time imagining Tony being tortured in those caves, but the image of a little Tony Stark being kidnapped as if it were a regular occurrence made him want to be sick. “How many times?”
“What would make me the happiest it would be to see you happy, Tony. Especially with me,” He continued, “I have proved today how selfish I can be, I know, but please understand. At first, I was afraid that you would find happiness with someone other than me. But I’m not stupid, Tony, I was ready to let you go if you found someone better, but you haven’t slept with anyone other than me since the first time we did it right on this couch.
, I fucking didn’t give you any sort of pass to order me around. You are just trying to take it without asking me. This is not the battlefield, I don't have to do anything if I don't want to. I gave you nothing and I won't give you anything, so let me go. Let
“Damn it, Tony!” He cursed with his Captain America’s voice, losing his internal battle and being the first one to resort to screaming. He got so upset about the comment that he immediately separated their bodies enough to shake Tony a little. The anger that he felt when the argument had first started returned to him with a force equal to a punch from the Hulk. “We have been through this, so drop it! You can’t do or say anything to change my feelings for you! Why is that so hard to understand?!
“God Tony,” Steve groaned appreciably when Tony rubbed himself over Steve’s still covered manhood in order to accommodate in a position over the blonde’s lap that allowed the genius to nag Steve for his honest belief in his stupidity. “If it were for me, you would always be hard and naked. I will never get tired of looking at you like this. ”
, which is way better. Braver even. You should try it sometime,” the Captain implied sarcastically, “The problem is that the guy I want to be with is a total
Steven wouldn’t have any of that and kept it slow as they become one. Reassuring himself that the sounds coming from his beloved meant that he was still alive, that he heard Anthony’s calls just in time; that they could be together in their veiled cottage, dreaming of the day when they would finally be allowed to be together without hiding or sneaking around so they could steal just a brief touch. A look.
on us?” Tony asked incredulously and probably a little offended, "what is it today? The 'play-with-Tony's-life-and-decisions' day? What the actual fuck?!"
“Colonel, I’m not asking you to change the way you see me,” Steve offered trying to approach Rhodes from yet a different angle. “I know that I can't get everyone to like me and it's not my goal in life. I just want you to, not even to approve of us, but to accept our relationship for Tony’s sake.”
“Isn’t that great, man?” Tony prompted squeezing Steve a little. “I think I can finally go steady. Well, if that’s what Cap wants, of course.”
Steven discovered a magnificent grey and black horse, probably a Belgian battle steed, in one of the finest stall´s they had. He immediately knew to take extra care with the stud as it was most possibly Lord von Doom’s. Not that he liked the man, he didn’t need to meet him to know that he probably came to court Anthony, even when the young aristocrat would try to deny it for his sake, but Steven knew all the trouble he could get in if the horse wasn’t treated with the utmost heed. All the unwanted attention Steven and Anthony could get.
boyfriend in what could only be called a possessive grip, and the colonel seemed to be concentrating more on glaring at the super soldier in full hatred mode than embracing his friend.
“You're well aware that I don’t think about anything else but you and when will I have you in my arms again, Tony,” Steven clarified holding him a little more tightly, but never losing eye contact. “But if I remember correctly, we agreed to meet an hour
“So, are you eating the sandwich?” he asked casually. That was simple enough, Tony’s normal answer should be a quick ‘No, I’m not hungry!’ if the hex wasn't yet working.
“You’re probably right, Jan, I would want Tony to get along with Bucky, too. But I don’t know what to do to make Rhodes like me,” Steve confessed. “He was pretty clear about his distaste for me, and it’s not like he even let me defend myself.”
Just as quickly as the inquiry popped in his mind, though, his resolution grew in response. He had long ago decided that there couldn’t be a better reason to die for. Painful or not.
Rhodes made a pointed cough in order to startle them so that they would have to turn around to face him. No walk of shame would be made in his apartment without Rhodey enjoying it. Even if Tony looked smug, Rogers appeared quite tense and mortified. Good.
Like Steven, Bucky was tall and had well-formed muscles that held the posture of a confident man. His blue eyes were more of a pale, almost grey, colour and his squared head held a strong jaw, but not as sharp as Steven's. His hair, in contrast with Steven’s blonde, was a mess of black waves that seemed untouched but for his fingers. Sometimes it reminded him of Anthony's dark hair, even if just for their mutual habit of combing it with his fingers when no one would actually force an actual comb on them.
“It is quite impressive, my Lord,” Anthony commented dryly when he looked at the stud. “I am sure he is the perfect specimen.” For what Anthony knew about horses, he was being quite curt.
It didn’t take long for Pepper to send him a short message with the date, time and place where he was expected to meet the Colonel. She didn’t even write him to say if Rhodes was aware of the meeting or not, only to ‘be punctual’.
“Steve, nothing happened.” He reassured quickly before Steven could tighten his hold even more. “We just danced and talked until I got murderous thoughts. And then some more.”
. He had been wrong. Rhodes didn’t like him because of the way he had made Tony feel the first few months, when they were fighting over every single thing, just to make the other feel bad.
Rhodes was actually surprised by the defense. It wasn’t every day that Tony Stark, eccentric billionaire, made an obvious show of affection with people being witness of it. Maybe it was because it was Rogers and Tony was such a softie that he didn't even stop trusting him. Damn.
“Of course you thought that," With a frown taking place on his face, Tony pushed himself completely off the couch and started to put his pants on, completely forgoing his underwear that was nowhere to be found, “Because you’re Captain America and whatever you do is considered by your book as the right thing, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, I asked him what the hell did he do to make you punch your way through all my sandbags the day he came over. I had a vested interest in asking, you see, especially considering that we had about fifty of them, and you had to sweep the sand all night leaving me all alone in bed. You’re making the people who sell me all the boxing equipment quite happy, Steve.”
Rhodey sighed heavily for what felt like the millionth time that morning. At least he knew that all the trouble Tony'd caused would be paid big time with his suffering when the fury-of-Pepper fell upon the genius the moment she notices he wouldn't show up for the meeting.
As the panic of barely missing death faded a fraction and he was able to pay attention to anything else but the frantic pounding of his heart, he noticed that he was surrounded by a familiar pink magic field and all four bullets were still visible on its wall as they had been interrupted in their trajectory to Tony’s certain death.
“Including Peggy?” The question popped as if Tony didn’t expect it to be asked, but the hope and fear reflected in his eyes as he waited for Steve to answer were plain heartbreaking, so Steve didn’t resist the answer that he knew was coming slip smoothly out of his lips. Clear and truthful.
“Thor.” All of them replied as one, easily ignoring Tony. Some were bitter about it (Clint), some apparently nonchalant (Natasha), some reluctantly happy (most) and some ecstatic (Thor and Jan).
“Anytime, Cap.” And before he could step on the gas, he added; “Sorry about the future harassment you have to endure, but I have my money on you, so good luck!"
“Absolutely,” he agreed easily. It wasn’t like he hadn’t imposed on himself the task of looking after Tony in any possible years ago.
“As thrilling as that offer is, I do not think it-” Anthony started now bluntly putting a hand on the other man’s chest to push himself away.
He wasn’t about to accept his fucked up destiny quietly just because of that, though. He was better than that.
“And you did,” His lover agreed gratefully, smiling warmly at him. “And I know you did it for me, so I’m really happy to have someone like you with me, but if you think I’m hardheaded, then that’s because you don’t know Rhodey, at all. He’ll come around with time, Steve. With a
Anthony wouldn’t meet his eyes. Steven knew he was trying to repair the little slip with being courteous to the tall guest.
“Don’t sulk, Captain!” Happy asked with clear amusement. "You have to know that I really do like you and that I think that you're great for the boss.
was close.” Anthony tried to make light of the situation the moment he was able to use the oxygen for more than just panting loudly while trying to remove all the splatters of blood on his face with his sleeve. His heart was still beating a mile per hour; he even felt a little faint but he wouldn’t admit that even under torture. Besides, the spell protecting the cottage was more than enough to fend off the whole wolf-pack and then some.
His proud, manic expression suddenly changed when his gaze fell upon Tony again, his voice turning seductive and only accomplishing to further anger present company, “And talking about beautiful, I can see why you’d love this sweet-ass,” the crazy man dared to lick the outline of Tony’s ear; it was disgusting in so many levels. The genius tried uselessly to throw him off again --to at least create an opening for someone to stick something sharp in this bastard, anything, really-- but his captor seemed like he hadn’t even noticed he moved, “I only spend a little time having fun with him and we haven’t had the opportunity to
He bolted for the door of the cottage the moment it was within reach, opening it with a smash. He waited a few seconds of Steven being involved in a heated fight with one of the wolves before the blond got himself free and ran to enter behind Anthony. Just then did the brunette slammed it back shut.
This time, Tony’s shock at his own honesty didn’t last long. His face went from astonished to confused to furious in no time. Steve let the shorter’s hands go so the genius could properly flutter them around to punctuate his righteous fury.
Steve knew it was just a matter of time before he found out the reason behind the Colonel's latent resentment; after all, it was bound to happen at some point. What surprised and embarrassed him was that it took him so long to figure it out.
“Pete, trust me,” Tony barely managed to hear Steve say, and suddenly, he was breathing fresh air. Well, at least more fresh tan inside.
It took courage not to stop immediately to look around for the exact source of the sound. “Great, a pack of hungry wolves and I’m alone in the middle of the bloody forest.” He whispered while starting to trot, even when his poor sight was proving to be insignificant against the urge to get away from the hungry noises. He tried to hurry even more his step the moment he heard a third, followed by a fourth, howl, however, this part of the forest was well known for its thickness and it was making him unable to openly break into a sprint. "At least they're not damned magical creatures. Thank the gods for the small miracles."
“To my initial surprise, I found that they were really scarce the girls that complained about the boss’ treatment; most of them were already dialing on their mobiles to brag about it the moment they’d get in the car, or they were just happy that they managed to get into boss’ drunken pants.”
The moment Steven let him go, Anthony was capable of appreciating more of the alphas features. His lover had a masculine face with a strong, powerful jaw and a large but sharp nose that perfectly matched his frowning lips. With all the commotion, Anthony wasn't capable of acknowledging his alpha's attire, and even if it was over now, he was too close and too mesmerized by the sky blue eyes staring back at Anthony for him to care.
“That’s certainly not true.” Steve refused to believe that the way people these days saw commitment was anywhere near true. Especially when they were so open-minded about a lot of other stuff nowadays. “Tony and I fight every now and then and we are perfectly fine.”
As Rhodes finally relaxed the crushing hug in order to look at Tony at arm length, the deathly glare turned into a soft stare (Steve could bet it was a rare sight on Rhodes). If Steve hadn’t understood right at that moment that Rhodes cared and felt responsible for Tony, then what he said next made it perfectly clear.
what he’s going to say,” Steve stated with determination. There was no doubt in his mind. There couldn't be if he was willing to go this far.
“Steve, what are you saying?! You should’ve kicked his ass, anyway! He’s being a completely unfair asshole!” Jan yelled while pacing on the kitchen’s floor with absolute rage. Everyone had already left to mind in their own business after breakfast, so the blond didn't mind the loud talking and the furious pacing. Steve knew she didn’t really feel like beating his lover’s best friend up was the answer, but her anger was genuine and Steve was glad he had someone like her to support him. “You didn’t deserve that! Is he blind or something?! How dare he think that you only like Tony because it makes you look like a Good Samaritan!?”
“So we could be honest to each other no matter what,” he took Tony’s chin and made him look at him directly in the eyes, “and so you would finally understand what I'm trying to tell you.”
“I have the right,” Steve revealed and followed his statement with a chaste, loving kiss, “I have the right to demand things out of you, Tony; you gave it to me. Just like I gave it to you. We have to talk about this.”
“You look like a hobo.” He stated taking in the genius appearance. Tony was wearing dark pants along with a seemingly old undershirt that showed under his black, fancy and undone button up that wasn't at all flattering to his appearance considering it was missing a sleeve. He was dirty, smelly and looked out of place sitting in his spotless kitchen table. “Or a mental creature, take your pick.”
“Don’t you dare to imply that I do anything without thinking of what’s best for him.” Rhodes threatened in a low voice. Steve decided to let him get it out of his system before he tried once more. “I just want to keep Tony safe, mostly from himself; and that includes
Steve took the opportunity and he grabbed Tony’s pushing hands from his chest and held them between his bigger ones, “Do you want me to?”
“You’re better than you think, though. But I’m not defending you to yourself; I have to do enough of that for you in front of other people,” the Colonel replied playfully. “You certainly are unpopular around the wrong crowd.”
Steve sometimes forgot the danger of displaying any form of affection towards Tony in front of the little, devious woman, even if Tony wasn’t around; she seemed to be over-interested in their relationship. Tony suspected she was taking pictures of them making out and selling them on the internet to the highest bidder.
Steve knew that this was somewhat an empty threat considering the competent port that this man carried. He wouldn’t use his men for a personal matter, Steve was almost sure of it; if not for the words exchanged, then for Tony’s obvious admiration for his ‘Rhodey’. Even knowing this, Steve couldn’t stop the small shiver that traveled down his back.
“Don’t be absurd; you could’ve easily pushed her away before the whole world took a picture of your little display. I think you can handle a fucking girl in the strength field, super soldier.”
“Of course you wouldn’t know anything about all of that, because you just got your ass unfrozen and barged into Tony’s life with the sudden purpose of making him miserable for over six months.”
It came to the moment when not even Steven could keep the pace slow, and he angled himself to hit the spot inside his love that made him lose his composure more and more with every contact.
He was almost there, anyhow; Anthony could already distinguish the marks of the almost invisible path of bindweed just ahead of him. The moment his feet brushed the hidden lane, he didn’t waste a breath to run along the now visible pathway with all his might. He knew by heart to take the left turn towards the small cottage that will surely meet him at the other end.
Steve felt the words like a slap from the Hulk. The supersoldier swore he heard a little part of his heart breaking in pieces at such an
The endearing term immediately went straight to Steve's southern regions and the blush on his face returning three-fold. However, before the blond decided if the next course of action was to say something in return, hide his face between his hands or just plain push Tony down the couch again and do him thoroughly, they were interrupted.
“Well, if you were going to forgive him anyway, why didn’t you go straight home to him?” Rhodey asked him as if in a last attempt to make Tony reflect on the subject.
“Then maybe you should talk to him,” Jan suggested, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Clear things up.”
"Because I trust you the same as you trust me. Because I know you and I know all this drama –yes, shut it, what we are doing here is a drama– it's just another excuse for you to bail on us because you don't want to end up getting hurt."
Steven could just imagine the too fake smile on his lover’s face; it was almost enough for him to relax a little, only to tense ten times more when the duke in question made his way to Anthony's space and took him by the waist as if he owned him.
“Of course, dumbass, now hand me that cup ‘cause I haven’t had a decent cup of coffee in a while.” And just like that, Rhodes was his usual self around Tony, and Steve couldn’t stop regretting that he had just lost a battle to the Colonel. He comforted himself with the internal declaration that this whole conversation was merely Round One; he definitely would not lose the war.
Looking at the bright side, with Wanda's help, Steve would avoid the trickier task of asking Strange a very personal favour, even if Wanda was still struggling a little to control her powers. It didn’t make it anymore easier to ask her, though. However, his life was hard enough without the beating around the bushes, so he just decided to go for it and be honest.
After his question, Steve waited patiently for the magic to beat Tony's internal struggle to answer it.
“You may have thought you fooled me when you got home drunk and with hickeys all over your neck, but then I always took you to my bed, jealous out of my mind, so I could examine your body thoroughly,” at this, Steve made a small pause where he ran his hands over Tony’s body, earning a shiver. Tony stopped sobbing and was listening to him intently. Steve didn’t dare to break eye contact.
“I just want you to be happy, Tony. I hope you get that through your thick skull.” Rhodes declared slowly while slapping Tony lightly on said skull. The way he said it implied that he didn’t want any confusion about his words from anyone present. “And I would support you no matter what, man. That’s what I’m here for, you know? To punch you in the face when your stupidity reaches high levels; which is all the time.”
“Hey, Rhodey, come on, cut me some slack here, man.” Tony’s muffled yell could be easily identified as persuasive. It wasn’t like James was anywhere near him to fall for that. Besides, he had heard it an infinity of times before and he was pretty much immune. “Just give us ten minutes and we’ll–”
“No! Of course not!” Steve clarified in earnest. The single purpose of this whole thing was to be able to care for him the way Steve wanted to -the way they both wanted to, damn it- and to stop the horrible and torturous dance they kept doing. “I just want him to tell me the truth, just
Steve put the freshly brewed coffee in Tony's favourite cup along with a stuffed sandwich and some bacon, he put it all on a tray to carry out and ignored the scrambled eggs that everyone was eating. Brushing off his nervousness with a firm shrug, he took a deep breath and decided to also put on the tray a small bowl filled with various fruit. Tony’s health was still Steve’s number one priority. Now and forever.
As Steve had anticipated, but still hoped it didn’t have to happen, Tony snapped out of his self-casted spell and rapidly tensed again. The genius pulled his arms away from his neck and on his chest in order to make another weak attempt to push Steve away. His eyes returned sharp and were now narrowed. Steve couldn’t care less and just moved his hand cupping Tony's cheek to join the one surrounding the genius' waist to properly squeeze him tighter towards Steve, effectively trapping Tony’s arms between his own and his chest.
Steven grinded his teeth while efficiently saddled Mephisto, but when he went to prepare Vision for Anthony to ride, he was stopped by the very guy that he wanted to punch in the face more than anything right now.
“Yes, preferably by my hand.” Rhodey said dead serious. The honesty in his tone made Tony make a double take and drop his jaw a little in shock.
annoying – if War Machine showed up and killed his boyfriend because of mediocre paparazzi work. He took a deep breath and chuckled at the article again. The probability of it being true and he not knowing it by now was really slim. If it weren’t Tony calling him – which admittedly wasn’t all that common – then it would be Pepper letting him know of his role in the national icon’s demise while she was effectively tying up the last loose ends on the Judgment Day that would be about to fall upon Rogers.
“Okay, okay, I got it. Please stop being so damn cheesy in front of me, man. You’re freaking me out.” The sudden change of expression and tone was pretty evident when Rhodes' eyes were redirected to Tony, who let Steve go with a grin on his face directed towards his friend. “I think it’s great, Tony, really.” Steve’s enhanced hearing didn’t miss the acid undertones of the Colonel’s words.
“But you have to remember that I was just angry and I didn’t really know you and it–” Tony started in a rush.
“You sure?” Rhodey asked but he made sure that Tony couln't possibly interpret it as anything but agreement, or worse, give him a window to any kind of backing down.
It didn't come as a surprise to Steve Rogers when he first realized that Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes had some kind of problem with him. It wasn’t a secret either, or at least the Colonel didn’t waste much effort in trying to hide it any time he was anywhere near Steve.
“Get off me…” Tony ordered resignedly after a full minute of stubborn silence when he seemed to admit to himself that Steve wouldn't move until he got his way. Instead, he tried to put some distance between them with a tight grip on Steve’s shirt. At this point, Steve was grateful at the connection rather than put off by it.
Rogers glared at him with defiance while going after Tony who was shouting after him. The blond crossed the door and closed it behind him, finally interrupting their death-staring contest.
“Sorry.” He apologized regretfully. He really did feel bad when Tony had to buy stuff because he broke them; he had enough to repair because of Bruce hulking out as it was. At Tony’s wave of dismissal, he inquired, “So? What did he tell you when you asked?”
“I do know who Tony is, of course,” she finally snapped out of it just to clarify, “What makes me astonished is that you’d want to use magic against him since he hates magic so much. That means a big risk to your relationship.”
Rhodes had sat on a table by the window. He hadn’t waited for Steve to order, since he was already drinking his black coffee as if it was water. It somehow reminded Steve of Tony and not for the first time he questioned himself what those two have exactly lived through together.
“So,” Happy began with what Steve assumed was going to be an awkward conversation. “I know that Pepper and Rhodey were a little unfair to you. Pepper admitted it herself,”
“It certainly does not. I don't know if you somehow missed it, but I am a genius, which means no stupidity.” Tony affirmed in a soft voice. Even if his words expressed something entirely different, that was a tone Steve knew from experience was reserved for only a handful of people. Thank God that Steve was included in that exclusive group, because if he wasn’t, he’d probably feel a little left out and even
This was one of the things Steve loved about visiting Tony to the workshop: his banter with Jarvis was always fun to witness. Steve allowed himself a fond smile without daring to move from his spot and cause them to stop.
“I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried everything normal and not-so-normal and I had accomplished nothing to fix this. I need alternatives, options, and I don’t know anywhere else where I could go for an extraordinary solution but here.” Wanda kept an unresponsive silence as her way of letting him finish blurting information. “I need something to make someone tell the truth.”
“See? This is why I get confused when people ask me if you’re any shy in the sack.” Tony joked and pulled him down for a mind-blowing kiss.
ruin anyone’s family, and before you protest, let me clarify that your birth-family was ruined by Howard, not you, and the times that we split the Avengers before was quite a team effort of you and me being unreasonable.”
a messy sob. Now he had to try his hardest to make him stop crying, to comfort him and to stay making amends for what he had done. He moved his thumbs up to Tony’s face so he could tenderly wipe the few tears that were able to fall despite the genius’ effort, "We love each other, it's what matters."
A little exasperated by the subtle doubt reflected in Tony's words, Steve pulled Tony closer with a sigh, but with a happy smile, "I'll take it." He knew better than to look a gift horse in the mouth.
As expected, Tony was in front of him in a blink at the mention of coffee and was already downing it with huge, scalding swallows marked by Tony’s Adam’s apple and a painful beat of nervousness from Steve’s heart.
“Anthony would be thrilled!” Lord Stane intervened readily. At Anthony’s scowl, the older noble threw a menacing glance at him for a moment and then he referred to the young heir. “Do you not think so as well, my Crown Prince?”
“You are up,” Rhodes stated. And was that anger that Steve was sensing? “Look Rogers, I don’t think I have a lot of time so I’ll cut through the crap. I don’t know what your intentions are, but let’s get this clear–”
His dislike for Rogers, though, didn’t automatically make him a cheating rat, and Tony would be annoying as hell – yes,
“Bullshit!" Steve accused, raising his volume even more, "You couldn’t be more in love with me even if you tried!”
The genius immediately put his hands up in mock surrender, "Please don't tell on me, dad! Mommy is scary! I'll be good!"
when all the craziness took place, the Colonel understood easily enough that even a well written press either lied, or at least exaggerated what actually took place in such a way that, even after all those years, it didn’t cease to amaze him.
"You know I hate it when you say stuff like that. Please stop, you are upset because you think one day I'll leave you for some girl." Rogers said. Even for Rhodey's ears, it sounded as if the mere thought was ridiculous for the blond. "I understand how you feel because that's exactly how
“This, Tony, is the exact same potion that I gave to you, an Honesty Serum, just adjusted to being able to work even with the Super Soldier Serum. I asked Wanda to do two potions for me so -”
He tried to be mindful of his step, yet he almost stumbled over a big root sticking out of the ground regardless of his efforts. The brunette cursed the same way he was taught he shouldn’t ever since he was a toddler. There were moments like these when Anthony wished that he'd had the time to collect one of his inventions before venturing into the woods to better illuminate
“And that was the resume.” Steve knew that Tony was probably molding whole phrases for the sake of his anger. Steve considered the words rude even diluted like that.
“Then again, alpha” he repeated this time pointing at himself to emphasize. “I’m possessive by nature; I get all crazy when I’m around you. I can control it when there’s a lot of people because I know they wouldn’t try something funny, but you’re making this difficult by telling me you were dancing with another man after we just had amazing sex.”
“Fine, but you can’t ignore this, Tony.” He relented, putting back the phone to its place. The finality in the Colonel’s voice, however, was enough for Tony to actually consider his words in a contemplative silence.
An awkward silence followed and Steve fidgeted a little, "Sorry, you probably don't want to talk about it-"
With a loud creak of wood lashing out, the first trap went off just a few meters away from Anthony, accompanied with a pitiful wail from one of the unlucky creatures. The closeness of the sound had the brunette scared enough to finally surrender to his survival instinct and call for the only person who perhaps could hear him this far into the woods.
As I explained in another one of my stories, I'm still in the quest for making my stories a little more legible by spliting chapters and getting a beta. I don't know how that last one works, so meanwhile, I'll split this story and keep counting on you guys to help me improve my stories.
“Captain,” He greeted while offering his hand for a shake and Steve shook it gladly. Here was the last friend of Tony’s who, the three together, meant a great part of  the genius’ world  and he hadn’t even tried to threaten Steve yet, which was always a plus. He was probably the one that he spend the most time with in comparison with the rest of Tony's friend since Pepper was always traveling for bussiness and Rhodes was on duty. Happy usually drove Tony and him to a lot of social events where they would pretend to go as friends.
Tony’s astonishment was so obvious that Steve had to stare a little. The super soldier knew that the genius couldn’t deny the truth of his words anymore. However, that was probably why the utter
Surprised by her knowledge of what was happening, Steve turned to Natasha to gauge if she has been the one to spill the beans, but she only shook her head in amusement at his betrayed expression.
“Well, there are generally three problems with that request,” Wanda informed and Steve deflated a little. “Number one: I cannot allow such a thing to fall into the wrong hands.” Before Steve could protest, she continued; “But that’s not going to be a problem since I trust you and I can't imagine you asking for this if it weren’t your last resource. Even though, I would have to make the proper amount for just one use and one use only.”
At Steve’s question, Tony pulled back a little so he could cup the blonde’s cheek with one hand and force him to look Tony straight into his eyes. “Steve, what’s wrong?”
“And now everything is all better and you love each other? Don’t make me laugh,” Rhodes continued his tone full of skepticism. “I know that Tony really cares for you, and that’s the only reason you’re still alive, Rogers. I know you’re not so dumb that you can’t see how much Tony cares for you and that he would do anything for you. So cut the crap and make your intentions clear, because I’m not buying your fucking lovey-dovey stunt.”
And before the whole sentence leaved his mouth, Steve could hear the constant bip of his phone’s line indicating the dead line.
“You… you hexed me,” Tony whispered even lower in disbelief, then, he seemed to snap out of it and the fury came back tenfold, “Oh my god! You hexed me!” When he made to pull away, Steve easily let him, “Get out!” the brunette demanded with a shove to blond's shoulders, “Get the fuck out, Steve!”
“No! I don’t want that at all!” Tony denied immediately, though it seemed that the words were once again pulled out of him by the potion rather than by choice, as he hurriedly slapped his forehead in exasperation at his words.  Again, no matter how dreadful it was forcing Tony into this, Steve couldn’t help but thank the magic in their systems; if Tony's answer had been any other, if everything had been a product of Steve's imagination, Steve wasn’t sure he could have been able to take it.
“I lost about a year ago,” Jan confessed happily bouncing from foot to foot. “I couldn’t believe you guys couldn’t just get over yourselves and get to it already! Though Logan was the next one to lose and he's usually pretty good at it.”
“I want to be able to touch you anytime I want, anywhere I want, and I want you to stay with me forever; I want us to be together, no matter what, and I want to stop saying stuff this fucking melodramatic, so I also want you to apologise every fucking day until we die for this awful fucking cheap trick that you pulled. And for what happened in the so-called Civil War," he added like an afterthought.
“I do deserve it,” Steve agreed easily with a chuckle. However, he sobered quickly while he added in a serious manner, “But my intentions were noble, I swear.”
was almost out of his lips when he received a stronger jab on his ribs, taking some air from his lungs. He masked the choked sound by coughing a little, not that these people would pay attention to him when all eyes, including his, were on the pair walking towards the thoroughbred stud, who neighed at their approach.
Just how long were these people outside the workshop spying on them. Steve made a mental note to ask Jarvis later.
“Now who’s the cheesy one?” Tony teased, but then he relaxed again in his best friend’s arms. “Really, Rhodey, this is good for me. Steve is good for me.”
?” Steve asked insulted. The Colonel could dislike him all he wanted, but Steve wasn’t about to let him jump to conclusions, which sounded more like accusations, just because he possibly thought that Steve was stealing Tony away. “Who are you to question my intentions?”
“He was just upset because he was the one who found me almost death in the desert, Steve.” Tony stated, trying to defend his friend a little. “He was pretty upset that you thought that the suit was some kind of toy for my entertainment when I built it to escape a facility where I was being tortured for kicks. I guess he took it personal.”
Suddenly, Tony was collapsing on the chair next to his and letting his head fall miserably on the table, “I don’t know what to do, Rhodey. I don’t want to face him until I’m sure I’m in my right fucking mind, you know?” Rhodey opened his mouth to protest, but Tony beat him to it again. “No, screw that! I don’t want to face him at all. Ever.”
“Well, he is rumoured to be quite…” James searched for the word, apparently impressed with Steven's omega antics. “reckless.”
Realizing he had closed his eyes at some point, Anthony quickly opened them again just to find the same animal that was about to kill him laying beside him dead and spilling blood in great enough amounts that the brunette had some of it over his face and clothes. It was nearly decapitated by what looked like a round shield with the royal family’s crest displayed proudly in the middle. The panther that symbolized the power and protection that the royal family bestowed over all of their kingdom surrounded by the glorious red and gold was enough for Anthony to sigh in relief. He would recognize the weapon anywhere.
“Should you be telling me this?” Steve couldn’t stop himself from asking. He did want to know, but these were Pepper’s thoughts, nevertheless.
“He is worth it to me!” Steve exclaimed, slamming at the table once again and this time he heard a distinctive creak, “You are worth it to me! I don’t give a damn if you think you're scum or anything you got inside your stupid head! That’s right! Don’t look at me like that! Even though you're a genius, you're pretty dense! I just want you to take your head out of your ass for a second and admit that you love me! That we can be great together!”
Tony and Scarred-face were only three meters away from the door that was clearly the scaping plan when suddenly his captor stopped. Tony turned for a second to see Hawkeye covering that exit and frustrating his kidnapper’s escape, casually resting against the door as if waiting for the weather to change so he could go outside.
“Love potions are forbidden even in the dark arts, Captain,” Wanda clarified unnecessarily. Steve didn't even know if she was just teasing him on purpose or just plain warning him.
“Indeed, my friends!” Thor boomed happily taking a step to be front and centre of their little circle, “Rest assured, I did not cheat as I recall warning the participants of this mighty competition of divination that I was an expert in the matters of the heart!”
?” he asked hitting the nail head on. At least he’d stopped trying to get away in favor of what seemed to be headed to a bad-cop-interrogation. “Did he say something to you?”
fill the void within him in an entirely different, unexpected way. That was something he wouldn’t ever be able to repay.
When it came to Tony, he wasn’t the perfect soldier everyone expected him to be. Tony, Pepper and Happy were all he had left outside of his military friends and he was willing to leave behind stoic professionalism and welcome raw emotion if it meant Tony would be safe and sound in consequence; even if that emotion often entitled him to knock some sense in the genius’ hard skull.
“Because, Colonel, even if I don’t think I’m good enough yet, I’m not prepared to let Tony go without giving my best to be able to become what he deserves one day. I’m selfish that way.” He stated seriously. “That’s why, even if I owe you so much for taking care of him while I wasn’t here and therefore made possible for me to meet him, I won’t give him up even if you don’t approve of me, of us. I promised Tony that I wouldn’t let go, anyway.” and Steve couldn't help but smile at that memory
WHAT happened? This all started as a challenge to myself to write a 1500-2500 word story, and look at this! Challenge FAILED. That being said, I was going to wait till I reached 100 kudos to post the next chapter, but I couldn't get them before Monday (the promised update date), so this is for the 97 people that kudoed my first chapter! You rock!
Steve needed a few seconds to process the question and try not to stutter when he answered. “Nothing, I was-”
fact. He didn’t want Steve to get any ideas now that it was highly likely that he was going to die. Steve looked quickly at him with what only Tony could interpret as a hurt look, a staggering contrast with all the aura of murdering intent that he had on a second ago, but Tony ignored him in order to keep his concentration on Scarred-face, “So, whatever you’re planning-”
Even James only allowed to be called "Bucky" by a handful of carefully chosen people, and only because he had insisted upon it fiercely the moment Steven found out that his middle name was Buchanan and he'd declared that it was simply off the question to be called that.
that overcame the brunette's deep-blue eyes when the genius reflected on Steve's words was easier to distinguish than ever.
“No, he stated that clearly enough himself.” He murmured a little angrily. “I just want to know what would you suggest to be a good approach with him so he’d stop insulting me for an instant and start to actually listening to what I have to say. And of course I would be willing to listen to what he has to say in return.” He added quickly.
Steve didn’t know if he was more grateful that this didn’t end with violence, or because the word being repeated again and again in Steve’s head led to the possible scenarios of Tony’s face and actions when he told him later about it. Overall, he was glad that he’d tried to communicate with the stubborn Air Force Colonel once more.
His role as the perfect best friend had been fulfilled; Steve Rogers’ honesty once again beats the colonel’s general dislike of him, and Tony is happily making out with him in his shower.
That’s when Steven noted the new horses on the guest’s stalls. They probably arrived just after the sun came down while Steven had been running towards the edge of the woods. Steven’s heart sunk a little when he realized that it would have been his turn to tend to the twelve new gest horses but was too busy waiting at the cottage for Anthony at the time. Then a pang of guilt came through when nobody approached Steven to nag him about his last night’s whereabouts, proving that James Barnes, the other stable boy and Steven’s best friend, had covered for him on his free night.
“Steven Rogers! Put me down this instant, you fucking tyrant! You will- oof!” and down he went not-too-gently when Steve dropped him on the couch. Before Tony could recover from the shock when his back hit roughly the couch’s cushions, the blonde sat beside him and manhandled his little genius onto his lap, effectively trapping him again within his arms, “Let me go, Rogers! This isn't fair, how could you?!”
The effect was immediate; Barnes stopped shrinking on himself and listened to Bates finish the enchanting words with even more murderous intent, “That’ll cost you, Ублюдок.”
“Damn, it's hard to think about the future when all I want is to go for a round two with you," Tony declared unwillingly, making them both separate a little to look at each other's surprised faces, "Sorry, I know it was out of place, but it’s just too fucking hard to concentrate when you are shirtless and touching me. Fuck! I can’t control this shit! Make me shut up, Steve!”
“Shut up, Anthony.” The Lord ordered in dismissal. Steven could see that the prince had a response ready for the lord, but no word left his lips. A silence spell, then. How much Steven wanted to grab his shield and cut this cruel wizard’s head right off! “Do you not see that the stable boy was about to say something?”
Hearing about Steve’s lover from someone else felt like a punch to the gut to Tony. Suddenly, he had to keep his eyes shut as he was unable to withstand the humiliation of realizing that he was so damn weak that his ex-husband and his lover had to come to his rescue. Because he wasn’t strong enough to defend his own son. How pathetic was that? No wonder he got replaced in a beat.
“You can’t begin to understand how happy you just made me with those words,” Steve continued softly, kissing Tony on the space between the eyebrows, “I feel like I could live forever just for the memory of them. But it breaks my heart that you want to apologise for the best thing that has ever happened to me.”
Afterwards, they would remain in the doorway that leads to the outside world, the one that forbids their relationship, and they would pretend they were kissing goodbye a loved one as if they would welcome back to each other later in the same day when the sun hid behind the mountains, even if the truth left many uncertainties.
“Your Highness,” Steven and Bucky said simultaneously along with a deep bow. “You would be pleased to know that they are healthy as ever, my lord.” Steve replayed looking meaningfully at Anthony, but his body language was one of an exemplar stable boy.
I hope you enjoyed the story and that you leave your comments and constructive criticism. As always, I will appreciate it.
He went to the kitchen to grab the key for his room and opened it as quietly as he could. Thankfully the guy did close the bathroom’s door so he didn't have to be especially sneaky.
“Yes, I will help you, but I won’t do a normal truth serum,” She answered resignedly, and before Steve could protest, she continued, “This is the third difficulty, even if he took a truth serum, he would have the choice to remain silent; as long as he does not speak, the truth would be hidden.” At the blonde’s frustrated expression, she awkwardly touched his shoulder as if in a weak attempt to comfort him, “So that’s why, after hearing what you really want, I am going to prepare for you an Honesty Serum. It will take longer, about three days, but I think it's better.”
Only then did Steven deemed necessary to notice the other nobles present. Lord Obadiah Stane, soon-to-be-king Prince Robert Bruce Stark Banner, his wife, Duchess Elizabeth Ross, and Gene Kahn, Lord Stane’s chief of security, followed them both from an acceptable distance. Steven soon realized that they were there to
“Which leads to the second problem,” the witch continued as if she hadn’t listened to his gibber, “I need to know who is it that you’re trying to cast a spell on if simply because I need something of that person for the potion to work and I need to know how much to make depending on height, weight and complexion, so it would be enough for just the one time.”
The easy disavowal of Tony's fears seemed to startle the genius a little, “What?” he asked incredulously, looking at Steve as if he was crazy, “How can you be so sure?”
"...I am," Tony finally replied, looking intently and directly in Steve's eyes. The storm in his dark blue eyes finally settling down and allowing the calm of Steve's sky-blue ones reflect on them, "
"Yes I am, I am jealous. But that's not important here. What is important is that I owe you an appology. Tony, I can't even begin to say how sorry I am that you saw what you did, but I know you're sure that it meant nothing to me."
“Steve Rogers, stop thinking perverted thoughts and focus!” Jan nagged at him and Steve realized that he had spaced out a little.
“You already let yourself into my floor. If you put one foot in my house, however, I’ll charge you for breaking and entering.” Rhodey threatened without giving up a single step. “That would be before I put a bullet in your head.”
"It surely wont." Rhodey made sure that his eyes were looking directly to the super soldier as he said this. No question in his words. The colonel's threat matching the determination reflected in the blue eyes.
the guy for insulting him and ‘hurting his feelings’. He would rather have another pleasant chat with the Colonel.
“As I was saying, breakfast and a bath.” James reminded Steven teasingly. “But seeing as you’re struggling to get this done in time and that you’ll probably fail in life without me, I’ll go change.” That’s when Steven noticed that Bucky was still on his sleeping garments.
At the thick silence that passed between them, Steve stubbornly didn’t leave Rhodes eyes for even one second. He tried to read his expression, but the Colonel didn’t show more than complete seriousness.
Anthony didn’t have much time to reproach himself his weakness when a strong hand gripped his upper arm not-too-gently and pushed him to his feet in haste as if he weighed nothing. “Tony! Keep running towards the cabin! I’ll cover you!
“You better;" Steven demanded, knowing that asking for it to never happen again was just plain unrealistic, "you give me this kind of frights at least once a month.”
“Wow, when you put it like that it’s even worse.” Steve affirmed while trying to suppress a flinch. “But there’s nothing I can do. Tony told me to give it up.”
Now that he was forced to look at the open space of the warehouse and that his son wasn’t being shot at the immediate moment, Tony could finally take in the scene. Judging by his stance, Peter had frozen mid-step in his one-track mind mission of freeing him and had stopped when he saw their kidnapper put a gun to his dad’s head.
“I was tired of you denying me,” Steve whispered with regret in his voice, ”I can see the truth in these wonderful eyes, yet you are never honest with me. I tried everything but in your stubbornness, you wouldn’t consider
“You amuse Lord von Doom, Anthony,” von Doom commented in third person with a low cackle. “You seem to believe that an omega like yourself is to do anything else but what an alpha orders him to do. You seem to be in need of a lot of… enlightening.”
However, he still remembered their first argument as a couple, when Tony had thought that fighting over his lack of self-preservation instinct warranted a break up. Steve had never laughed so hard in his life. Then they’d had tons of glorious make-up-sex.
“I could put my clothes back on if you want to,” Anthony teased, making an attempt to free himself as if going to search for his clothes that were nowhere to be seen in the surrounding area.
“I went looking for help; a different kind of help,” he announced slowly. Steve knew he was staling, but he wanted to keep that position forever and Tony’s reaction to the truth will be explosive if he's lucky, “I went to Wanda and convinced her to make me an Honesty Serum.”
This story is planned to be very long, but I am stuck with real life like I was never stuck before and I don't think I'm going to post more chapters in long while, so I just put the first chapter and the beginning of the second one as a one-shot and see how it works for now.
“How dare you, Rogers? You have no right to force me to talk to you! To do anything! Let me go fucking
At first, Steve had been surprised that Tony had a friend like Happy when he first met him.  The super soldier had thought that Hogan didn’t look like the kind of civilian who would stick with Tony’s eccentric ways in the long run. However, Steve could effortlessly see what Tony liked so much about Hogan's easy way after he spend more time with the chauffeur; it was probably a tempting thing to have near when you have people as organized as Pepper and Rhodes around all the time.
“They shouldn't do that, it is too early to vote for the movies we're watching tonight,” Steve couldn’t help but feel indignation. Really, what some of the Avengers wanted to watch baffled him, still. Well, it was more Clint and Logan than the rest of them, but with fewer votes in favour of sanity, more the chances to get stuck with two indescribable movies, "Where are they now?"
“He thinks I’m scum, Jan.” Steve confessed the next morning after Tony had ran to his workshop while muttering something about never being enough coffee in the tower. He remarked his words with a resigned sigh. “I tried to talk to him, but he kept making accusations that made me want to kick his ass into a far away universe even more than I had ever wished to do to another villain. Thank God that we were talking over the phone; I’m not so sure I’d had been able to contain myself face to face.”
The smirk he received in reply was enough for him to ignore the confused stares of everyone else in the room, along Logan's scoff, and to resume his exit of the kitchen to head downstairs.
the words that he ordered his mouth to pronounce, “Huh, it seems that I'm unconsciously aware of how
“I wouldn’t dare." Steve replayed with fake innocence, which earned him a stronger bump on his shoulder that made him laugh again. "Hey, I can imagine how hard it must be for a beta like yourself to get an alpha. I wouldn't use sarcasm in such a case! Only respect.” They both chuckled at their antics when they started to push each other around, but before they could start a real wrestle Steve got all serious and looked at James straight in his eyes. “I can’t thank you enough, Bucky.”
At least Steve wasn’t as upset anymore as he had been when all of this disaster of a conversation started. Small victories considering how utterly annoyed he still was.
Before anything hit Peter, though, Bucky Barnes seemed to miraculously materialise in front of the kid, shielding them from the unavoidable bullets with his metal arm.
Steven then hurried to feed the horses and started to clean the stalls while the horses were distracted eating. He decided to start with the recently arrived horses because he didn’t know how long the castle’s guests would resolve to leave, even when his usual routine demanded for him to start with Anthony’s most beloved horse, Vision, a beautiful, black, faithful to Anthony like no other, Arabian stallion.
“A pleasure as always,” Hogan complimented politely, “And answering your question, Pepper didn’t exactly send me for the boss; she told me about your conversation last night over dinner and I thought it would be a good idea to contribute a little to the little assault you three seem to have going on now better than later so you can get this over with, if you don’t mind.”
Bates, however, didn’t seem surprised or even truly disappointed by this turn of events, “How anti-climatic. You can’t blame a fella for trying, now can you?”
“Keep your cheating mouth shut, Rogers, you’re making a scandal.” The colonel demanded. If Tony heard and confronted Rogers before he was calm and ready, it could only end bad. However, the second the words left his mouth, Rhodey knew he had fucked up. His insisting that Tony wasn't there just made itself an obvious lie for the simple detail that he owned the whole floor and no one would really be able to hear them even if they were screaming bloody murder and going for the guns.
Tony’s embrace made Steve relax his serious stare a little, and he was unable to stop the warm smile that followed his lover's actions.
Steve allowed himself to be backed up a little to be able to look at the man between his arms, only to find that the glaring has stopped, but also that Tony wouldn’t meet the blonde’s eyes. Steve gently moved his left hand that was firmly planted against the wall and slid it slowly against Tony's shoulder, then up his neck, until it finally found his stubborn man's cheek to rest on. He massaged gently behind Tony’s ear for a moment, just the way the genius liked it in a subtle attempt to calm them both completely. It seemed to be working for both of them when Steven noticed that his angry panting turned back to natural, easy breathing and Tony's shoulders drop as the tension slip away from him. Finding no more resistance, Steve directed a little force into his left hand to cup that handsome face up so that Steve could meet those distressed blue eyes with his own determined ones.
“He really left me without any other option,” Steve defended himself with determination in his bearing, even if there were internal voices yelling at him about how much of a human scum he has become for plotting to do this to Tony. Wanda, ignorant of his inner battle, just smiled knowingly with a small nod as if she was humouring him. Steve wasn't going to get into more detail than what he had to, so he decided that changing the subject was his best option, “So! What’s problem number three?”
“We are not idiots, and every time we have learned from our mistakes. Besides, I believe that we can be fairly selfless when it matters. Tony, we complement each other, we challenge each other to be better every day, we have screwed up so many times that we can predict our next screw up. There is no way that you and me together, as a united, unbreakable front, would fail at keeping what's important to us.”
“You should probably go now before I embarrass myself further!” Tony yelled suddenly taking the tray from Steve’s hands and putting it roughly on the nearest worktable. Before the supersoldier could comment on that, Tony was right back into the blonde’s personal space trying and completely failing, to push him towards the exit. “Like I keep doing in front of you. But I’m probably very sleep-deprived.”
“Captain, what I’m trying to say is this: yes, I’ll hold a grudge on you if you ever hurt the boss’ feelings, but I know the boss is a big guy who can take care of himself just fine and I’ve got more faith in you than anyone that has ever ridden this car with me before.
This time Steven had to be restrained physically by Bucky. There was an instant when he couldn't care less for the consequences;
“Oh, come on, that means nothing,” Tony was obviously trying to pull it together so fervently that Steve wanted to cry in the face of absurd denial. How far would this man go in order to tear them apart even if he obviously didn’t want to?
Even with all of his resolve and annoyance at her negative persistence, listening to her uninterrupted point of view over the subject made something inside Steve turn with dread. He definitely didn’t want to think of the possibility that her words were true and all he has been doing is pining after an idea that simply wasn’t there.
Before Tony could do anything more than to gape at his son in action without his suit, the genius was being dragged back by both thugs that still got their tight grip on him. However, it wasn’t even two steps back that both soldiers were yanked away from him; the first by one of Peter’s webs and the next by the force of two well-aimed knives; the first one went through the soldier’s hand that was aiming his gun at Peter with a sickening sound of cartilage breaking, the other encrusted in the thug’s neck probably before he could even register the pain from his hand.
to cover it,” He agreed easily, relieved that her doubting was over. “But I'm no saint. I think I deserve exactly what I'm getting, considering our history of painful up and downs. I'm just out of options. But the important thing out of all this interrogation is that this means you’re going to help me, right?”
“Rogers! Stark!” Rhodey heard a little crash and a curse courtesy of his best friend as a response and couldn’t help but to smile a little at the mental image of Tony hitting his head as retribution for giving the colonel the worst day off ever. “Don’t you fucking dare! Get the hell out of my house, before I start shooting through the door!”
“I can’t,” Tony whispered with obvious distress, all the fight gone. The drop in volume was so sudden that Steve almost couldn’t hear him even despite his super-hearing. “Steve, I can’t, so please let it go. For both our sakes,” he begged.
“Tony,” Steve replied with a pleading tone, “Please forgive me. Please. You have to understand. You left me with no other choice. I really feel guilty about this, but it needed to be done.”
And just like that, a pair of lips were seeking his own in order to cheer him up. Steve allowed himself to let go off Tony’s hands in order to cradle one of his lover’s cheek with his left while the right went around his waist and pulled him impossibly closer.
“What?!” Peter jumped at the order trying to go round Steve, but he got his son by the shoulder at his side in a smooth movement, “You can’t do that! I won’t forgive you!”
It wasn’t long before they laid satisfied between the sheets of the small bed in the cottage. They knew it was meant for just a person, but they never did anything to change it, since they didn’t need more space. Anthony was more on top of Steven than in the bed, anyway and that’s how they preferred it.
the one who can’t keep his mind out of the gutter.” Tony teased while trying to make his smirk look like a sweet smile and failing horribly. The brunette was now running his hand all over his chest with obviously faked innocence.
When Steve's and Tony's brain got over the fact that they apparently have been very obvious in their little drama, and finally caught to what was actually being asked of them, the serum took over their lips and instantly answered the little brunette.
“Mr. Rogers! Mr. Barnes! How are the horses doing this morning?” Anthony asked hastily as he walked towards them. His tone serene, but his eyes begging Steven for forgiveness.
When Anthony made to respond, a terrified scream that he would deny even after death left his mouth as a wolf finally caught up to him, tackling him to the ground face first. The beast, hunting predator that it was, didn’t waste any precious time and went straight for the genius’ jugular.
Over the corner of his eye, Tony saw a couple of AIM soldiers aim at his son’s back. Tony recognised the look in Peter’s widened eyes as his spider-sense warned him, but one of the goons had a machine gun, “Peter!”
When Steve made a move to go after him, praying that Rhodes had forgotten he was in the room, a firm hand on his shoulder that was probably meant to hurt him a little – if not for the super soldier serum it probably would have– stopped him right on his tracks. No sudden invisibility today, it seemed.
“True as it may be that your taste in music is impossible for me to comprehend, sir, with all due respect, you haven’t been able to sleep well for the last week and you’ve been down here for thirty-two hours straight. Even Dummy doesn’t seem to know what to do with you anymore, sir. If my advice is to be taken, you probably should-”
“Well, then.” The Lord agreed smugly while making a dismissive gesture with his hand so the other two horses went ahead. “You should remember your place, servant.” The Lord advised almost spitting the last word. “I should warn you to keep your eyes low when you are in the presence of your masters since you are not worth more than the filth around this place.”
“Well, it’s surely not because of that big smile and kind words of yours,”Steve replied sarcastically, “I just think that we started with the wrong foot and if we talk this out maybe we can find some common ground where at least we can tolerate each other for Tony’s sake.”
Without taking his eyes away from Tony’s, afraid that this calm truce will break by the wrong movement, Steve reduced cautiously the distance remaining between them to nothing, but he didn’t meet resistance when their lips met again. It was a tender kiss; gentle and soothing. Steve wanted to pass on every emotion he was feeling through that simple touch; he was begging Tony to finally understand, to let actions speak the words that the genius wouldn't listen to.
