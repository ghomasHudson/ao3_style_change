"You're pulling your punches," Steve returned. "I can always tell when you are."
"The important thing is that I came back before I seriously hurt someone," Wanda corrected. "Or killed them. Studying magic is a harder way to be in control again, but a better one."
Wanda winced; she could still hear her children's screams as Mephisto had re-absorbed them back into himself. She had been able to make them exist while she was around them; if she had been more knowledgeable, more experienced, more skilled, would she have been able to make the spell permanent, make them real?
"Couldn't you trade for them, or just buy the rocks from them?"
Don hesitated, then slammed the end of his walking stick against the ground.
She took a step forward, then grabbed at the altar rail again as the floor lurched under her feet. She could still hear Chthon's whispering, a faint susurrus of sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once. It was too indistinct to make out words, but the volume rose and fell in waves, as if Chthon were alternately shouting and cajoling.
Steve looked at Sam with a pained expression. Next to him, Wanda had buried her face in her hands.
He was already sitting upright, one hand pressing at the ache behind his eyes, trying to wake up enough to focus on what the mansion's systems were telling him, when the building's intruder alert went off.
"Do you want tips on the best way to flutter your eyelashes?" Pepper asked him now, voice completely deadpan. "You know, for next time."
"Loki," he said flatly. "What brings you to this place? I took precautions to prevent anyone from teleporting in." He had not designed them with a god in mind, even a minor one, but they should at least have given him a warning. Alarms should have sounded, defenses been triggered.
"So, you don't know what's wrong with them, and you don't know what to do about it?" Sam said..
"Carol," Steve ordered, "get on the radio and see if you can get them to back off.  We-"
Clint half-raised one hand. "I didn't, actually."
"That's different." Jan set the ice cream container down, hard. "That
“I could take a look at him,” Wanda said after a moment.
"Hank!" Clint yelped from somewhere behind them, his voice actually cracking, "I thought you liked women!"
Loki's left hand brushed the hilt of her dagger. "I have ways."
Tony looked up, the faint light from the window making his face appear washed out, his hair and goatee even darker than normal.
If some supervillain ever made it necessary to send Jessica back into the Shadow King's dimension... Even the thought made her stomach twist and her throat close up.
She had been wondering that herself. If Chthon had been able to flatten Strange so easily, how had she managed to get free of him? "I did use it," she agreed, "and it didn't hurt me at all. And Strange has twice the experience I do with magic."
What-  She shouldn't be able to hit so hard.   It was like being smacked around by the Hulk.   Even with magically boosted strength, Sin was barely five foot four and shouldn't have had the leverage to throw him around like that.
If he were being honest with himself, Tony looked more relaxed at the moment than Steve had seen him since he stopped drinking. Apparently, the secret to getting Tony to relax was forty-eight hours without sleep, mild blunt force trauma, and listening to his team trade embarrassing secrets with one another.
Luke and Jessica Jones look at him.
Then he left the kitchen as quickly as he could without actually looking like he was fleeing.
Trusting that Wanda's magic would work as she'd said — having brought her along, he could do no less — he ran toward the nearest black-clad man, slamming his shield into the man's arm to encourage him to drop his gun.
Whatever reply Zemo might have made was cut short by a howl of wind as Agatha Harkness raised her arms skyward and began chanting, Wanda's hex spheres impacting harmlessly against some invisible shield several feet in front of her smoke-wreathed form.
Steve's shield whooshed through the air where she had been, a fraction of a second too late, and clanged loudly off one of the support pillars that held up the third-floor balcony.
"We know she's getting something out of working with him," Sharon said.  "Maybe she's just in it for revenge.  Maybe she
"At least we know it won't be you," Tony offered, reaching out to lightly touch the back of one of her gloved hands. "Not this time." They could be thankful for small favors there – short of Stephen Strange, any alternate host Chthon could possess would lack Wanda's innate magical powers, and at least wouldn't have a connection to the interdimensional Nexus and an omega-level mutant's power levels to augment his own vast wellspring of power.
"That's why I like my hex powers." Wanda gestured with one hand, as if throwing a hex sphere. "They manipulate probability, not reality itself." She turned back to Tony. "I don't see any sign of the spell, either." She looked away then, shaking her head. "I'm sorry that you got caught up in this. There must have been some scrap of Agatha left in there, since she didn't wish to use me as Chthon's vessels, but I couldn't get through to her."
"I know apologies can't bring Erwin and Clytemnestra back, or make up for what I put Rhodey through, but it was the only thing I could do."
"I think we should all go to bed," Steve started. Everyone ignored him.
do calculus in their heads didn't usually find it easy and fun. Hank's explanation through gritted teeth that he'd been working with extra-dimensional mass transfer on a daily basis for years and was never, ever wrong about it, and by the way, organic chemistry was not a "soft science" hadn't helped matters.
He spread his hands apologetically, waiting for Ben's follow-up question.
Sharon looked distinctly unimpressed.  "This kind of thing is why we broke up," she said, looking back over her shoulder at Tony.  "More than once."
Jan took it from him and stuck it behind her back, snuggling into it, and the tense set of Hank's shoulders eased slightly.
"Vividly. Just think about how angry it will make them to know that Captain America is fucking a guy." He said the words deliberately, not bothering to soften it with a euphemism. "Maybe we shouldn't have kept it secret in the first place." He'd been made forcibly aware over the past year of how much the actions of a single individual could affect the entire superhero community, the entire country; people listened to him, even when he didn't want them to. Maybe for once he could use that for a good cause and not have it backfire painfully.
doesn't like it."
Better? Tony looked like he'd just been electrocuted. And he had to do this once a day?
"It-It wasn't like-," Hank stammered,  "Ultron wasn't-"
There was an endless eternity of silence, and then Hank's voice came over the line.
Steve turned, grinning up at his teammate. He knew that it was never a good idea for a man to let himself get too cocky or complacent, but he allowed himself a moment to luxuriate in the joy of having his team around him again. Thor's cloak was flapping slightly in the fall breeze, his armor gleaming in the sunlight even more brightly than Tony's did. Several yards away, Clint and Carol were giving statements to police officers, Clint's purple leathers a garish splotch of color that nearly rivaled the billboards and neon signs around them, and if Steve looked up, he knew he'd be able to see Redwing circling overhead, keeping an eye on the situation from above for Sam. If it weren't for the absence of Wanda and Vision, Steve could almost imagine that the disasters of the past few years hadn't happened.
Killing the guards at the front gate might have been worth the extra time after all, if only she could be sure that they had the right clearances. The ten minutes that had elapsed since she and her men had slipped past them weren't long enough for a severed hand to cool to the point that it could no longer trigger a biometric lock.
Steve didn't have to hold back, knowing that Sam was the same height as he was and closer to the same mass than either Tony or Clint. He didn't have to pull punches, because Sam wasn't going to let Steve hurt him. Not like Tony, who after years of hand-to-hand combat training still had a habit of leaving himself wide open to blows that he ought to have dodged or blocked, because the armor would have been able to absorb them.
"It's also blatantly a man's watch, doesn't actually fit you anymore, and doesn't match the dress. If you really need to know what time it is, you can ask your date." Jan held out her hand imperiously. "You can have it back when you get home."
Tony was attracted to him. Tony cared whether or not Steve was interested in him. Tony considered Steve to be "the right kind of man," whatever that meant.
Of course he would. And then he'd go from working at only partial capacity to being an active liability for Steve and the rest of the team, with no one but himself to blame. Tony stared at her for a long moment, trying to come up with an appropriate response, humiliatingly aware of Sharon and Hill standing
"Yeah," Rhodey snorted. "Because you were really in a state to give me instructions." He turned back to Steve. "It's not a choice for these kids; their powers aren't some experiment they volunteered for, or a suit of armor that they can take off if they can't handle it. If no one takes responsibility for training them, they're going to get hurt, and they're going to hurt other people."
There was, Tony though, no good way any explanation that included the phrase 'completely sterile' could end.
"She brought me back from the dead, and she healed Cap's broken jaw that time in England. Maybe she could have kept that guy alive."
The plane's wheels hit the runway with a jolt, and the malevolent force Wanda had sensed lurking in the corners of her mind rushed in like water filling a bowl.
An answer would have been redundant, and he didn't wait for one.
Luke  could just be screwing with him, but Peter doubted it this time.  He  sounded too amused for that.  Everyone had known this was going on but  him?  "And you didn't tell me?" he asked MJ, in what was hopefully an  injured tone.
needed to be told. She'd spent so much energy coddling his fragile self-esteem once, and she'd sworn she would never do it again, but... he
"Rhodey wants to have full military honors."
Agatha's house had always been filled with a comfortingly old-fashioned collection of Victorian clutter, but Strange went her one better. The walls were lined with book shelves, most of them jammed with leather-bound books, but some of them holding statues of strange, tentacled monsters, braziers cast in fanciful shapes, crystal balls of various sizes and colors, including several made from actual rock crystal, and one subtlety inhuman skull. The lettering on the spines of some of the books seemed to writhe when she wasn't looking directly at it.
It wasn't that funny, but Steve found himself smiling anyway. Smiling was better than the alternative. "I'm glad you're not hurt. I was worried there was something else wrong with your heart."
"I took out about three times as many of them," Clint said, but he didn't sound as if he meant the objection. Hank had been on the receiving end of enough actual resentment from Don and Thor recently to know when he heard it. And when he didn't.
They should have helped her, should have tried harder to get through to her. Should have noticed something was wrong before it was too late; by the end, whatever had been looking out of her eyes hadn't been Wanda anymore. The real Wanda, the woman Tony had been on a team with for years, would never have attempted to destroy an entire race of people.
Steve vetoed that with a head shake.  "No, you're staying here, too.  He wanted you as well as the book."
"Hank's running some tests on mutant blood chemistry for Beast," Steve offered. Despite the seriousness of the topic at hand, he couldn't keep a smile off his face; Tony worried about any phenomenon he couldn't explain and therefore have at least the illusion of control over, but watching news broadcasts of men and women weeping tears of joy over their returning powers was enough to make Steve willing to accept the mysterious return of the X-gene with only a few reservations.
ooOOoo
The chaos around them surged again, and for a moment, she could see nothing but black and red, hear nothing but Chthon's whispers.  Then they were descending.
It had only been a week since the last time the two of them had shared a bed, but it felt like much longer; Steve closed his eyes, and thought about rolling over so that he was closer to Tony, close enough to wrap an arm around him and lay his head on Tony's chest. Lying like that, he could hear Tony's heartbeat, and Tony would lay a warm hand on the middle of his back, between his shoulder-blades, and run his fingers through Steve’s hair. It was the one thing Steve had found that always kept away nightmares, and even though he hadn't had any lately, he just... slept better that way.
don't have time for it. And I'm not going to bother him with something that I might be able to fix with a single line of code tomorrow."
Predictably, none of the invaders did as she said.  The woman took a step forward, her hand going to the back-up weapon she wore in a shoulder holster, and Clint fired a burst of energy at the floor just in front of her feet.  It lit up the hallway like a lightning flash, rendering everything in bright blue-white and sharp-edged shadows.
"The voices in her head," Sharon muttered. Then, slightly louder and with significantly less sarcasm, "When she fought us, she kept saying, 'You killed me, you killed Brock, I'll make you pay,' over and over. She may not have any endgame beyond causing as much damage to SHIELD as possible, and with James up here recovering from her poison, any SHIELD employee might do as a temporary substitute."
Maybe it was good that he couldn't remember the entire thing very clearly. At least his vivid memories of her naked body and the vague idea that it had been pleasant were all he'd taken away from it, and he didn't actually know what Wanda was like in bed. That would have been... wrong. Even more personal than the things he did remember.
"Just pick one and open it," Tony suggested from the bed, where he was leaning back on his elbows and looking thoroughly debauched in a way that begged to be sketched, if only Steve had known which box held his art supplies. "I don't know what's in them, either." His own collection of boxes was smaller than Steve's, but only because at least sixty percent of the things he'd wanted to bring over from the tower were already sitting downstairs in the mansion's lab. Several of the larger pieces of equipment had had to be hauled over via quinjet.
"He'll come around eventually," Jan said, trying to sound certain. "And he doesn't need you to be angry for him."
Could have- Clint blinked at her, about to ask what she was talking about, but she didn’t give him the chance.
Tony made an absent noise, then started to pace back and forth at the end of the bed, left hand rubbing at his temple.
"I'm surprised you were able to get a coherent sentence out of me at that point," Tony admitted. He kept his voice light, acutely aware of Steve sitting only inches away from him. Most of the interview he'd granted Ben and Sally Floyd was a blur, and the hours after it were one long, grey blank. It had been dark when he'd come to himself again, his knees stiff from the way he'd been huddled on the floor, and his head aching dully. There had been sunlight in the room when he'd spoken to Ben and Sally, and the notation in his schedule had blocked out time for them for an hour in the afternoon, starting at four-fifteen.
Maya smiled with cheer that he expected wasn't even forced, and advised Tony to see it as just one more scientific challenge to solve. She avoided pointing out that she hadn't wanted to give him the Extremis in the first place, which was nice of her considering that she mentioned how much easier it would be to fix it if she still had access to the Mandarin's rings at least three times, and pointed out twice that it was Tony's alterations and additions to the original Extremis coding that had made it vulnerable to the data corruption in the first place.
At least Hank
Loki raised a mocking eyebrow. "Which one?" Her glance around the room at the other Avengers – the first time she'd looked at any of them, save for that one glance at Steve – made her meaning obvious.
Jan coughed into her arm again.
"Clint thinks that you should get married in costume."
Steve shrugged, looking faintly embarrassed. "It was afraid of my shield."
"That doesn't count," Steve said. "Cooking is a basic skill."
Nowhere in the article, Steve noticed with a detached calm that surprised him, did Floyd directly say that they were involved. She didn't need to. In concise, clear language, she described Tony's shock and dazed grief when she and Ben Urich had spoken to him after Steve's... after his death, and contrasted it with his clear joy at having Steve back, given how 'obviously close' they were. They had refused, she reported, to respond to questions about the nature of their relationship. Again, technically true — Tony had apparently refused to speak to her at all.
"Ask Tony once he comes out of this," Carol said. "I wasn't there, I just heard about it from Clint." She glanced at Tony, her eyes lingering on him for a long moment, then looked back at Steve. "He is going to come out of this, Steve."
"You're no fun. You do know that, right?"
"You shall pay for humiliating me at our last encounter, Captain!" Zemo shouted. "This time, the Masters of Evil will not be defeated!"
"You don't actually want to hear the rich businessman whine about how hard his life is," he said. Steve looked at him silently, and he sighed. "Apparently you do." He paused for a moment, then said, "I know people don't want me for myself. I'm not stupid. They want my bank account, or my body. Once they see through the glossy shell and realize what I'm really like, they don't stick around."
"Jen was already going. I could have gone, or called in some favors to get one of our auxiliary members to return to full-time status." It wasn't as if the Avengers were lacking connections in the superhero community. This probably wasn't a conversation Wanda really wanted to have, though. Time to change the subject.
"I know this is my own fault, but I really didn't mean for it to happen." One of Tony's hands rubbed up and down Steve's back. "I won't let it be a liability for the team. I promised Wanda I'd be there if Chthon got her again, and I promised you—"
Tony made no move to get up. "Actually, I was thinking of just staying here until the hot water runs out. Just send your electric bill for this month to me."
"It's not your fault," Steve said, to Wanda. "Like I said, if we blamed everyone on the team who'd ever been mind-controlled for what they did under mind-control, we'd have to court-martial pretty much everybody except Jan."
Halfway to Steve, the cat froze. For a long, motionless moment, he stared at the vault with his back arched and his tail puffed out like a bottle brush. Then he hissed and streaked out of the room.
Steve almost never mentioned dying, even after he jerked out of sleep gasping for air and shaking, something he'd done a lot those first few weeks. It didn't seem to bother him now, but Tony reached for his hand anyway, laying his own hand overtop of it and brushing his thumb along the back of Steve's knuckles. There was a faint, white scar across one of them, barely detectable even by touch. It was the only scar on Steve's body, now that the bullet graze by his hairline from fighting Red Skull had long since healed away into nothing.
Steve hadn't read
Tony appeared behind Hank and Wanda, his altered appearance completely concealed inside the Iron Man armor - Jan was too busy trying desperately to think of what on Earth she was going to say to Hank to even be disappointed.
"I thought the Dr. Faustus leak had been handled."
The screams from the corner suddenly stopped, and Jan looked over just in time to see her begin to run towards the broken window.
long.
"You're pulling your punches," Steve informed him. He crouched down beside Tony, hands resting loosely on his knees. "I shouldn't be able to do that so easily."
Hank's frown had shifted from irritated to stubborn. "I'm not going to drop or suppress a line of scientific inquiry just because the results could be used badly. All science can be used badly."
It had taken all of Jan' powers of persuasion to keep him from asking the poor kid for a tissue sample from his wrist. '
They didn't make any sense to Steve, either, but at least Tony seemed to realize that he hadn't been acting rationally, if not actually that he'd been wrong.
"That would be from stepping in powdered glass while I helped rescue your ass from that restaurant. The jet boots must have slagged it." Rhodey bent down and picked up the bundle of purple feathers the cat had just spat out at his feet. "Here," he said. "Go chase something."
Which was all to the good, considering that Rhodey was one of the few people Tony had left outside of the Avengers at this point; he'd never had that large a support network to begin with, and now Happy Hogan was gone and things were apparently awkward with Pepper as a result, which wasn't surprising, but was unfortunate. It also meant that, old disagreements or no, Rhodey had a power to hurt Tony that few people possessed these days.
“I could have undone the rest of what he made me do, too.  Given everyone their powers back.  I should feel guilty about that, but instead I just keep thinking, I could have had him back.”
He wasn't going to go downstairs and apologize, he told himself. He'd had a point, and completely justified reasons to worry.
Sam borrowed Redwing's eyes for a moment, using the falcon's vision to look through the top floor windows. There was always a moment of disorientation when he did that, as the world came into sudden, startling clarity. He'd occasionally wondered if this was what it was like for nearsighted people when they put on glasses.
He was going to be fine.  He’d wake up any moment now, and smile at Steve, and offer some bullshit explanation about how deliberately allowing himself to be impaled had been the only way to save the world.  Then he’d apologize insincerely, and do the exact same thing all over again three months from now.
MJ  finished her set and left the stage, coming to sit next to Peter.  "So  how did I do?" she asked, as the band started to play dance music.
"On that note," Steve said, "good luck dealing with your superpowered teenagers."
Wanda made an affirmative sound, and finished putting together her sandwich. "Carol came by yesterday," she said, as she carefully spread butter on each slice of bread in a perfect, even layer. "She wants to talk to you about Loki."
He scooted slightly closer to Tony, wrapping an arm around his shoulders, and let the feel of Tony's body against his, warm and close and
Arguing with Jessica was a lot more cathartic without the worry that this would be the time Carol finally went too far and lost her for good. With less to lose, there was less to fight about.
"Pepper's always telling me to put together some kind of-" Tony broke off, gasping, then ground out, "some kind of prepared remarks for these meetings."
Tony raised his eyebrows. "I'd like to see you wear heels."
"The SHRA has, thankfully, been repealed-"
"Does anyone here have a smartphone?" Tony asked, as Clint caught up with Steve, breathing hard through his nose but not winded. "You." Tony indicated the youngest of the police officers, a woman whose tightly curled natural hair was pulled back from her face by a glittery pink headband. "You have one of my phones. Give it to me." There was a moment's hesitation, as she eyed him skeptically, then he added, "Please. I can hook it into the building's security cameras."
Pepper raised an eyebrow. "So we're going to be professional now? I suppose I should give you the message Captain America left for you later, then."
Considering the number of women he had dated, slept with, and then moved on from - and Jan, moving in the same social circles, had heard stories long before she ever experienced his talents in bed for herself, some of them accompanied by satisfied smirks, and some full of justified outrage at being abandoned mid-date because of 'company emergencies' that Jan suspected had involved a pressing need to don armor and jet boots - it could hardly have happened to a more deserving member of the Avengers.
"I've had three in the past two years," Clint protested.
"Yes. I left the ice pack in the kitchen. I don't think it's actually as bad as it looks, though." Nothing was torn, after all, or moving his arm would be infinitely more painful. "It really is just bruises, and I heal from those pretty quickly."
He should have expected that this fix would turn out to be temporary, too. Maybe he had, on some level.
"Well, that's flattering." From the tone of his voice, Tony was more than willing to have this fight, and there was something oddly satisfying about hearing the confrontational edge in his voice, and seeing him toss down the micro-tool he'd been holding and shove himself to his feet. Even obviously tired and headachy, with circles under his eyes and late-night stubble blurring the edges of his goatee, he moved gracefully. "I gave you my word, Steve."
"Great." Jan flashed him a brief, unconvincing smile. "Wanda. You can come critique other people's designs with me. It's always useful to have a second opinion."
"What?" Steve asked, his hands stilling.
Sam extended one arm, letting Redwing walk down his shoulder to his wrist, and then flung him up into the air. Then he nodded to Steve and pushed open the door, hoping like hell that the building manager wasn't going to be hiding under his desk or screaming incoherently. The last thing they needed right now was to be stabbed with a Mont Blanc pen.
"A while?"  Hank's shoulders twitched, the attempt at a shrug cut short by the fact that at least part of his weight was hanging from his arms.  "I don't know.  Long enough to be thirsty, not long enough to start desperately needing a bathroom, and definitely less than twenty-four hours."
"I bit my tongue when Doom zapped me."  Which had probably looked gruesome, but was completely cosmetic.  The nosebleed the feedback from his armor's frying systems had given him was a little less so, but it was nothing that hadn't happened before.  He'd brought it on himself, really, between falling so easily to Doom's modified weaponry and then being stupid enough to try using the Extremis to reactivate their communication systems, which was a mistake he wouldn't be making again.
Tony stared at him, eyes wide, his expression shifting from confusion to a sort of frozen horror. "Oh God," he gasped hoarsely, pushing himself up and away from Steve. "I'm sorry. I'm sor-"
"Yeah." Steve winced. "I'm sorry you got dragged into this."
He would be a terrible parent. Half the time, these days, it seemed to Tony that he could barely take care of himself, let alone another person. Not that it was going to matter, because regardless of whether or not he was taking the coward's way out, there was no way he could go through with this.
"I had some..." Don hesitated, "family business to take care of. I still do."
The Wasp sighed, the sound audible even at this distance. "No one hates you, Hank."
ooOOoo
It hadn't been like that, for Clint. Not exactly. There hadn't been any disgust or fear; he'd always thought that Wanda was attractive, always liked her. It was why her betrayal had hurt so badly. Mostly, there had just been a feeling of confusion over why he was there, why he was doing what he was doing. Like Carol said, it had been like watching himself from a distance, while someone else controlled his body.
It was impossible to tell how many hours passed before a pair of Doombots teleported into the middle of the warehouse floor in a flash of light.  For a moment, Jan's vision was blurred by a smeared purple afterimage.  Then it cleared, and she was able to recognize the man held slumped between them.
"I should strangle thee," Thor told him, the familiar pronoun slipping out without thought.  "What medicines dost thou take?"
ought to be able to get at least one vaguely positive reading."
“He damaged it fighting the Mandarin.  It hasn’t worked properly for months now.”
It was good to know that he hadn't lost his touch.
have seen Tony, if only briefly, if he'd thought to come and wait here earlier. Still, resenting whatever reporter they were meeting with was irrational and probably petty. "I'll let you get back to work."
"Which is what, exactly?" On the one hand, it was very flattering and affirming that Hank and Reed had followed Tony's lead and treated Peter like an equal in all matters scientific. On the other hand, it meant he ended up asking more questions than he had since Dr. Connors' class.
The ability to surf the web with your brain must be nice when you were laid up flat on your back.
It was most certainly not nothing; Tony was hunched forward, curling in on himself as if in pain, and Thor could hear a slight wheeze in his breathing. He did not need Don Blake's medical knowledge to know that this boded ill.
Pepper had thanked him, too. Tony closed his eyes, forcing himself not to stiffen under Wanda's touch, and was suddenly grateful he had refused her offer of food as his throat closed up and tight pain seized at his chest. The air in the room felt thin and hot, suffocating.
Wanda looked down at her hands, then back up at Clint, her face carefully expressionless. "I think we need to," she said. Her voice was even, but Clint could hear the strain in it.
Having Steve to come home to, knowing that Steve's hands, his mouth, his body could actually make having a woman's body... not exactly a substitute for his own body, but fun nonetheless, that Steve
Back to obsolete technology, then.
That was good, Steve thought. Wanda deserved to have something go well for her, after the last year. First the loss of her children, then her marriage ending, then Immortus's attempt to take over her body... At least she was back, now. He'd been worried when she had briefly joined forces with Magneto that they had lost her. Possession was a hard thing to come back from, and Wanda had already had to do it once before.
Sam had a point, he reflected. Tony was actually handling the situation far better than Steve had expected, unless he had lost it just now as some form of re-directed stress, which Steve supposed wouldn't be surprising. From the sound of things, SI's board of directors was being less than supportive about the whole thing, and the media was having a gleeful field day with it. Awkwardness aside, it might be a good thing Tony was staying in the Mansion; it was harder for reporters to get access here.
Clint had been standing there for a couple of minutes when the nurse from before, the good-looking, blonde one, materialized next to him.
His own grave wasn't there anymore. It had already been empty, and Steve had asked them to take the stone down the last time he'd been in DC. Standing there and looking at his own name carved into the white stone, no different from thousands of others, he'd felt cold, numb; seeing the physical proof of his burial had made what had happened to him real in a way that even Tony sobbing in his arms hadn't — he'd been dead,
"Has he figured out how to turn Iron Man back yet?" Steve asked, though Hank's less-than-enthusiastic demeanor had already told him the answer.
The armor's override code did nothing.  Steve tried it again anyway, then a third time, then gave up and started wrenching at the edge of Tony's faceplate.  The fact that the armor was dead didn't have to mean anything.  Tony could be completely conscious and unharmed inside it, trapped inside his own unresponsive armor.
Strange took a step forward and allowed the Cloak of Levitation to float him gently down to the street below. Behind him, Daredevil climbed down the building façade like a cat-burglar, dropping the final ten feet in an acrobatic jump that would have done an Olympic gymnast proud.
"I could have told him that," Hank said. "In fact, I think I did." He sounded more like his old self than Steve had heard him sound in, God, almost two years. Was it being in a lab, surrounded by people he felt comfortable around, or the fact that he had used his size-changing powers again without losing control and without disaster striking?
Tony reached out and caught Steve's wrist, tugging him back over to the side of his completely unnecessary infirmary bed.  "Are you okay?" he asked quietly.  As annoyingly irrational as Steve was being at the moment, he still didn't like the idea of letting him storm out still angry at him.  Especially not after Doom's little bombshell earlier.  It was probably too much to hope that Steve had forgotten it in the heat of the moment.  Not when it had stopped him cold in the middle of a firefight.
Could any of them touch it safely, other than Loki herself?
This, now, with Steve wasn't going to last either, he knew. As much as he found himself wishing that it could, Tony wasn't going to lie to himself; eventually, he was going to revert back to his own gender, and then Steve would understandably lose interest in the physical part of their relationship. And even if that didn't happen, if Tony turned out to be stuck this way, Steve would eventually find someone who deserved him more than Tony did, who could make him happier than Tony could. Someone like Sharon Carter, whom he'd had a crush on for ages and would probably go back to in a heartbeat if she were willing to have him; Steve had broken up with her several times before, and they always seemed to end up back together in the end. Or someone like Bernie, the woman Steve had almost married a few years ago, someone who could offer Steve a chance at a normal life. Even as a woman, that was one thing Tony couldn't give him.
"Thank you," she whispered. "There was no one else I could have asked. Thank you."
"Does Tony know you're already planning your appeal to the state supreme court on his behalf?" Sam shook his head, grinning, and answered his own question. "Nevermind, he's marrying you. He probably does."
"You have a screwdriver," Don observed.
He had said the same thing in the Meridian. "It's okay," Steve said, his throat tight. "It was a dream, remember?"
Tony paused in the doorway. "It's not taking advantage of me if I want it," he said, without turning around. Then he was gone, leaving Steve alone.
"If you want," Don said quietly, after Jarvis had left, "I can run the same tests on you that I did on Wanda. If you're worried about dying and coming back, or about being exposed to Chthon in Transia."
The pain in his side was sudden and blinding; Strange grabbed for the altar rail, fighting the urge to curl around the pain, his concentration shattered for one brief, fatal moment.
those things. By really stupid, dangerous methods. I can't go back and undo them, and I can't ever apologize enough, but I really am sorry. I... you need to believe that."
"I wasn't going to lie," Steve said. "I just… it's not the kind of thing you talked about when I was growing up. You could be arrested for doing the kinds of things that-" that Tony and Wanda had talked about so casually. "I've never told anyone before," he concluded lamely.
Zemo had nearly taken his head off with a ray gun then, while he stood frozen, and Steve had knocked him unconscious with his shield without regard for what damage he might have done in the process.
"It does not seem meet to me that Doom should be permitted to walk free from this latest piece of villainy," Thor grumbled, glaring at the newspaper in hands. He had been following the United Nations hearings on whether Doom's attempt to cave half of Lower Manhattan into the sea constituted an act of war, and whether international trade embargos should be placed on Latveria, with poorly concealed ire.
Steve nodded distractedly at Jan and followed Tony out into the hallway.
His pulse throbbed painfully in his temples for a moment, warning him that any more attempts to use the Extremis to interface with equipment other than his armor would be a mistake.  He was treading on the edges of his promise to Steve as it was.
“Yes?”  Then confusion instantly melted into contriteness.  “Sorry.  I’m not supposed to do that, am I?”  Tony closed his eyes again, and groaned faintly, his fingers relaxing in Steve’s hand.  “I feel much too good, even with the pain.  How much morphine do they have me on?”
“I’m sorry,” he offered, not quite sure what he was apologizing for.  “You’ve just woken up, I shouldn’t-“
Tony grumbled something under his breath, but it was clearly a token protest. In the end, Steve was pretty sure Tony enjoyed the photography exhibit, too. He had something to say about all of the pictures, even if it was only to make fun of them, one hand on either Steve's back or his arm the whole time, and kept smiling up at him. When had Tony smiling - a real smile, not a fake one for cameras - become unusual?
"That's not the issue at hand," Tony said, looking Layton straight in the eyes. "The issue at hand is how we're going to pursue other avenues of funding, and other sources of income. The ebook reader has generated a lot of media buzz, but it's not going to be a major source of revenue the way the Starkphone is."
Sin blocked the face of his shield with the spear, breaking the force of his lunge with a strength she'd never possessed.   It was like slamming his shield full on into a stone wall, but the jolt that shocked up his arm and into his shoulder was oddly distant.   His ribs, still bruised from the fight yesterday, didn't even twinge.
The energy was different in nature from the hot, orange-yellow-white power of the spear, moving in slow, sullen coils that pulsated with the unhealthy red heat of an infected wound. In the spaces between them, Strange could glimpse a cold, black absence of light, from which emanated unfelt vibrations on the same bone-hurting frequency as the power that had hummed through the cathedral door.
Then he had sworn that he would not move back into the Avengers mansion, that doing so would be to symbolically forgive Tony and Hank Pym their betrayal, just as treating them as the shield-brothers they had once been would be.
There were times when he hated trying to coordinate things with city authorities, especially now that he no longer had the authority of SHIELD to back him.
Steve was frowning, his eyebrows drawn together in a way that was usually endearing but that, right now, was just irritating. He was going to be stubborn about this. Damn it. "We can't just hand Loki that kind of power," he said. "God knows what she'd do with it. She might not be as evil as Chthon, but she's a lot less predictable."
It was silly, but something inside of him relaxed at the knowledge that Tony and Jan were back safely, despite the fact that charity fund-raisers weren't in the least dangerous. Steve was contemplating abandoning Dashell Hammett and going to bed when he heard the quiet sound of bare feet against the living room's wooden floorboards.
"We thought you could use the back-up," Tony said, as a repulsor blast took what remained of the Doombot square in the chest.  "Agents Carter and Barnes are on their way, along with whatever SHIELD can scramble."
His Avengers communicator chose that moment to chime, rescuing Steve from the conversation.
"I'm more sure about this than I've been of anything in a long time. It just," Steve spun on his right foot and kicked out at Sam with his left leg, only to have Sam block the blow with his forearm at the last moment. "It feels right."
Steve's chin went up slightly, his jaw tightening.  "I think I do."
That didn't mean this prescription was for one of those things, though. Cap was probably forcing Tony to go to doctors' appointments and other 'good for you' things these days, especially after the poison incident. Cap
"Don't let him near his power tools or his office," Don said, to Steve. "He doesn't actually need to be lying down, but he does need to be resting. It's only been three days. I know SI gives up to a week's worth of medical leave for this."
Don had hoped that deactivating Jan's energy-bubble would be simple and quick, something Hank could do by yanking out a few wires or pressing some buttons, but several endless minutes later, when Hank started mumbling things under his breath, he realized with a sinking feeling that they weren't getting out of there for a while.
Tony swatted Steve's hand away and glared up at him.  "I forgot for five seconds during an emergency situation while I was half conscious," he snapped.  Purple and grey sparks flickered at the corner of his vision for a moment, and he blinked them away.  "Sue me."
You couldn't save everyone, no matter how good you were or how many powers you had.
This time, there wasn't any empty space between them. Steve slid over until he was lying half on top of Tony, wrapping an arm around his waist and burying his face in Tony's neck. There would have been interesting possibilities inherent in this position, especially after a week spent apart, but right now, they were both too tired to do anything more than just lie there.
"Not anymore." Steve shook his head. "None of us are in any state to stand up there and let reporters ask us questions."
"It's been almost a day and a half," Clint interrupted miserably. "We thought it would wear off, but it hasn't. And it turns out Wanda's chaos magic isn't exactly up to breaking spells cast by a god of chaos."
The world lurched sickeningly, the ground pitching under his feet.  His ears popped as the air pressure plummeted, and Wanda’s voice echoed through his bones, his head, the ground under his feet.
DeFalco raised his eyebrows, looking suitably impressed. He was actually looking at the slides this time, and not at Tony's breasts, which were nearly invisible under his suit jacket anyway, thanks to expensive tailoring. "I have to say, Ms. Stark-"
Tony glanced over the menu; standard French restaurant fair, which meant Steve was going to get French onion soup and beef wellington. It was what he got every time they went to a French restaurant, to the point that Tony had once teased him for having such unadventurous tastes and taken him to a sushi restaurant the next time they met up to discuss Avengers business. He'd ordered the most bizarre and vaguely terrifying-looking sea creatures on the menu, just to see Steve's face when their food arrived, only to discover that Steve's tendency to order the exact same thing every time they went to a given restaurant concealed a hidden ability to eat absolutely anything.
He avoided using the Extremis for the rest of the day, relying on clunky laptops and cell phones and even letting one of Fury's minions fly him back to Stark Tower in an aircar — disconcertingly, Barnes had shown up to drive it, despite undoubtedly having better things to do. When he called the armor to fly him home at the end of the day, he remembered why.
What would it be like to kiss him now, to feel the rasp of stubble along his jaw, to wrap his arms around someone every bit as tall as he was? He had forgotten how gorgeous Tony was, or at least, forgotten the impact of it.
Wanda's eyebrows shot up. "He actually said that when he dumped you? Why were you dating him at all?"
"Five months, two weeks, and three days ago," Tony said, without turning to look at Cap.
He couldn't do that, but he could take a step closer to Tony and rest one hand on his shoulder.
"You're sure he doesn't get turned inside out?" If it happened in zero gravity, Marcus's insides could float all around the spaceship.
"How did you manage to knock Atlas out?" he asked. "I was a little busy at the time."
"Wanda!" Jan landed lightly on the floor, growing to full size as her feet touched the wooden floorboards, and rushed forward. "What happened?"
"This is Iron Man, requesting assistance. Is anyone there?"
"Your apartment-" Tony started, then broke off. "You should have told me."
Tony arched an eyebrow, looking amused.  "Because two glasses of soda are so very heavy."
"Well, he is your-"
"You're warm," Tony mumbled into Steve's shoulder. "Not going anywhere."
MJ was silent for a moment, regarding him seriously. "No one should have to make those kind of decisions," she said finally. "I'd be worried if you wanted to."
She shoved away the memory of Vision disintegrating in front of her eyes and braced herself for Strange's answer.
The armor, Tony decided, could wait. "Sorry, Shellhead," he murmured to the half-completed pile of parts on the workbench and floor. "I'm afraid you come in second this time."
"Hey," the man held his hands up, palms out, smiling easily, "I was just trying to be friendly."
"Sorry." Tony started to stand, gathering the discarded shoes up in one hand. "You don't need to hear all about my problems."
Tony went rigid, back arching, as the spear punched easily through his armor.
Steve shook his head.  “It wouldn’t work.  You’re too tall, and you weigh too much.”  Even slightly underweight from his recent hospital stay, Tony had a good four inches and thirty pounds on Sharon.  Steve could pick him up, with a little effort, but tossing him around a dance floor in some of the more athletic swing moves wasn’t going to happen.
He looked... if he hadn't
"Talk to me, Don."  Jan waved at him, the gesture over-exaggerated, probably so he could see it despite the poor light and her size.  From this angle, half-sitting/half-lying against the wall, all he could see was her upper body, the rest of her cut off from view by the floor of her prison and the back of Hank's head.  "I'm going to go stir crazy in here."
"Let him go, you-"  There was a thud and a muffled grunt from behind Sam, and Hank's voice cut off abruptly.
Jan stood in front of the open window, air from outside blowing in onto her face, frozen with horror.
"You'd better hope so."  Barnes shook his head.  "I wish we could help more.  I owe Pym for the snake venom thing." Barnes didn't believe in being reassuring; Tony liked that about him.
Carol’s answering smile was a little strained, and her voice was suspiciously thick as she answered, “Oh, good.  Thank you.”  She turned to Steve, smile still fixed in place.  “You go first.”
“That makes two of us.”  But- “Why me?”  It ought to have been Vision.  He’d been her husband, and she clearly still loved him, for all that their relationship had ended.
They'd all let it happen, the same way the rest of the team had let Marcus take her.
Tony was buttoning his own shirt back up when Steve arrived, fingers on the button one down from the top. He was a lot... smaller.
"I could have hurt you." Tony lifted his head from his hands; even this close, Steve could still barely make out his expression in the dim light. "When that poison was affecting me... it's a miracle I didn't hurt anyone. Next time something like this happens, I might."
"She means, I'm afraid, that your cybernetically enhanced friend is in a catatonic state." A dark-haired man in a white lab coat stepped out of a room a few feet down the hallway. "Thanks, Dixie. I'll take it from here."
Jan watched him stride toward the door, resisting the impulse to rub at her temples. Steve clung fondly to the belief that he could make things turn out the way he wanted them to by sheer force of will. It was endearing, most of the time, but sometimes...
Manual data input was clumsy and slow compared to using the Extremis, but it was better than sitting around doing nothing while Sin and her collaborator planned their next move. She'd already cut a swath through SHIELD's scientific staff, and SHIELD didn't have any personnel to spare right now.
"I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy," Steve said, heat flooding his entire face and neck. "I can't help it."
“Oh,” she said.  “Clint said he was using it less often.”
"I think that would be good." Wanda backed slowly away from the display case, nearly bumping into an older white man who was trying to look at the case of lab instruments.
"I hate the Kingpin," he said. Because he did, he really did, with a kind of dark intensity that was especially scary for the fact that he'd never felt it before. No matter how much he wanted to hate Norman Osborn -- for Gwen's sake, and maybe especially for Harry's sake -- he was and always would Harry's father, and as much of a psychopathic bastard as he was, Harry had loved him, and Peter could never quite bring himself forget that.
"No," he said again, "but I don't have a choice. I have to go to this and at this point it's too late for me to get a tuxedo in the proper size."
"I gathered that," Steve said, and took the phone from her. He brought it to his ear and found Peter midway through a stream of fast-paced speech. "-fire me again if I don't get the Bugle an exclusive, or maybe just fire me on principle for knowing all about it and not telling him. I can tell him no, though. It's not like Jameson hasn't fired me six times already, and he's mad enough right now that he'll probably do it anyway no matter what I do. And I can find out who took the picture, if you want; there aren't many guys good enough to get that kind of a shot in that kind of light. It was an old-school camera, right? That doesn't narrow it down much, but-"
Steve could feel himself smiling. He dug his toes into Tony's thigh and settled back against the couch arm. "I'll hold you to that."
He opened the magazine, flipping through it to find the article. "That's why she kept calling Pepper," he muttered, staring down at the first page. "She was trying to get a quote."
"Better Tony than me. I get enough anti-superhero shit on a daily basis as it is."
"Why do they keep asking me about that?" He gave them the same answers every time, the only answers he had. "Do they think my reasons are going to change?"
“They’ve finished evaluating your teammate,” he said, to Carol.  “Ms. Maximoff is being allowed visitors now.”
Barnes snorted.  "An office building would work just fine.  All you need is someplace with a basement.  Or a storage or service area that no one checks that often.  Hell, a restaurant with a walk-in freezer would work."
"I'm not sure. I keep thinking that I may be imagining it, because Loki's powers and my powers are both chaos based, but I sense Chthon's touch in it. Loki's a chaos deity, but Chthon is raw chaos itself, and the magic wrapped around Tony is raw chaos. That's part of what makes it so difficult to counter. And the structure of the spell..." She took another sip of her tea, resisting the urge to wrinkle her nose at the taste, then set it aside. "It feels more like witchcraft than sorcery."
Thor regarded him levelly. "When you first spoke to me after my return, you concealed from me certain things you had done during my absence."
She left the goons to Clint and Wanda and strode toward Doom, ignoring the blasts of energy he fired at her.  It was like wading directly into a fire hose; she had to lean her body forward slightly to brace herself against the force of it.
"Let's move this inside, people," Steve said now, nodding at the mansion's back entrance. "The sooner we get all of this over with, the sooner you three can go home."
"And look where that got us." MJ shook her head, frowning. "You know, I may not be a spandex-wearing hero myself, but I'm pretty sure wanting that kind of control is the path to supervillainy."
"All right," he said, smiling again. "Pear ice cream it is."
He started to roll back to his feet, and Steve kicked his legs out from under him. "The police have this entire building surrounded," he said. "You're not getting out of here. Why don't you drop your weapons and come along like a good wannabee Nazi thug?"
Tony let go of Steve and pulled back, looking him directly in the eye. His eyes, at least, hadn't changed. They were still the same shade of grayish blue they had always been. "Steve," he said, voice low and husky, "nothing with you could be casual."
It was terribly unfair, she thought, not for the first time, that while she and Vision had needed to resort to magic to try and have children, Tony, who was risking his future chances of ever being male again so long as he remained pregnant and who had never wanted a child in the first place, had conceived without even trying to.
It was ridiculous to feel as if he'd let the older man down when they barely knew one another, but Tony still felt an uncomfortable sense of shame when he thought about Byrd's probable opinion of his descent into drunken uselessness. Byrd had been one of the few people in either business or in Washington who had taken Tony seriously from the beginning. "He'll still be trying to get Iron Man to work for the government when they force him to retire thirty years from now. Iron Man's armor has never been for sale, gentlemen. That's not negotiable."
a surprise," Carol muttered. "I vote no."
Tony was poking at the anti-teleport device again. Had he been this bad at putting work down for five seconds before the Extremis? "I try to avoid the New York Post. Do they still run that awful picture of me from six years ago every time they mention me?"
"You had to regain control of your technology or people might have died," Steve said, carefully. "You do realize that the tactics you were using could have killed people. Did kill someone."
Jan was shouting, hammering on the energy bubble with both hands, heedless of the pain it had to be causing her.
Given the deeds they had been willing to admit to, given that he already knew they possessed no honor, how much worse must these unknown things be for Hank and Tony to be ashamed to speak of them?
"No," Steve said.
He was still in surgery.  It had only been forty minutes, Steve reminded himself.  Not long at all, for broken ribs and a huge, jagged-edged puncture wound.  There was no reason to think that anything had gone wrong.
in brightly colored letters. "Come on; Ansel Adams awaits."
"He doesn't," Carol said. "Jessica's done some digging on him – he's pretty much A.I.M.'s puppet, more of a figurehead than an actual leader. Whatever they did to him to keep him, well, alive's as good a term as any... his sanity didn't come through the experience intact. Not that he was all that sane to begin with," she added.
Of course it had influenced his actions. He'd tried not to let it, to do what Steve would have done and soldier on regardless of what it cost him personally, no matter how much it hurt, but in retrospect... He'd lied to Steve to protect him, kept secrets from him for what Tony had thought at the time was Steve's own good. If he'd been acting entirely rationally, maybe he'd have done things differently, allowed Steve to make his own choices with all the information available to him, rather than not explaining things until the situation had gotten out of hand and it was far too late. Steve had insisted more than once that he himself would have tried much harder to come to some kind of compromise if he'd known what Tony's true goals had been.
The Wasp would be willing to tell him, but the prospect of asking her was unsatisfying. He wanted to hear the admission of deceit from Tony's own lips. He was the one whose betrayal had struck the deepest; Hank had been ill, in the past, in ways that interfered with his judgment. Tony, whom he and Don Blake had both accounted a close friend, had no such excuse.
Tony was still moving, grabbing Sin and jerking her around, and Steve had a long, horrified second to both see Sin's arm draw back, to see Tony thrust his repulsor gauntlet into her chest, and know exactly what each of them was going to do.
She dodged and swerved around energy bolts and flying pieces of metal without thinking about it, and threw herself under another blast of raw chaos from Sin — no, Chthon; she knew better than anyone that that wasn't Synthia Schmidt anymore — to land on her hands and knees at Clint's side.
Steve's voice, from behind him.
One booted foot hooked his right hand out from under him, and he collapsed back to the floor.
Don Blake had wished to discuss this with the other Avengers first, but Thor had over-ruled him.  Loki was Thor's area of expertise, not Don's, and the rest of their teammates were either wounded or distraught at the moment.
"I just feel bad," Tony went on. "I told Steve I'd be back this morning."
Tony had never expected that he would pray for the Sorcerer Supreme to come and save them, but he seemed to have been doing that a lot lately. Maybe if Strange showed up in time, he'd have more success shutting down Harkness's ritual than he had breaking Loki's spell - she wasn't a god, after all, just the servant of one.
"I stopped counting after the third time," Hank told him. "They did have a nice close-up on Maddigan ranting about the beauty of destruction in the name of science before you guys took him down, though." As far as superhero-related publicity went these days, that was firmly on the positive side. A.I.M.'s poison gas attack on Wall Street was recent enough in everyone's memory that they were still being unanimously portrayed as the bad guys, and the perky, unblinking news anchor had chirped that a little property damage incurred in the name of stopping another round of mass toxin-induced hysteria was a small price to pay, especially in a major tourist area.
"I found it helpful," Barnes mumbled into the table.
Apparently it
"So said to yourself, 'I know; I'll ask Hank,'" Hank said, in that bitchy voice he used when he was being snide to people, usually Clint. "'He doesn't have any professional ethics.'"
"I was angry with you," she admitted. "For a long time." She wasn't sure when that anger had gone away, when thinking of Hank had started to inspire regret instead of outrage. "You hurt me."
The reflection was too blurred for that detail to be visible, but Thor had seen the old scars from needle and torn-out stitches with Don Blake's eyes and knew them to be there. Not even sewing Loki's lips shut had been able to halt the flow of lies that spilled from his tongue like poison.
By the time Hank had finished smashing the robot's head into the floor, exploding arrows had taken out three of the others, and Clint was wrestling with the final one, his bow lying on the floor several feet away. The robot had him pinned against the wall, and was slowly strangling him with a hand around his throat – or would have been, had this been real. Its hand was actually just wrapped loosely and completely harmlessly around his throat.
ooOOoo
"Damn it," Steve swore, his hand dropping back to the bed. He grabbed a fistful of the sheets, crumpling them between his fingers. He had no idea what he was supposed to do.
"My armor's got four times the firepower of Tony's," he said, in a conversational tone. "If you hurt him, you'll get to experience it firsthand."
The antidote skidded across the pavement, rolling toward the curb. Tony reached for it, and nearly overbalanced as the ground lurched under him. The canister skittered away from his fingers, his hands clumsy as they'd rarely been even when he'd been drinking. What the hell was wrong with him? He hadn't hit the lamppost hard enough to have a real concussion; he'd only been out for a few seconds.
of the blows Steve had been shrugging off throughout this sparring session. It was possible that he was a little rusty, thanks to spending the past month letting his cracked ribs heal, but he was giving it everything he had, even though part of him winced every time he threw a punch at Steve. "Force equals mass times acceleration, and you have about forty pounds more mass than I do."
He had a point, but still... "Maybe you and Beast should talk to the rest of the X-Men before you publish any of it, just in case. Or to Jan. Or anyone who's not each other, Tony, or Reed Richards."
Tony forced down the impulse to snap that he didn't want Fury's business anyway. Not now that he knew how little he could trust the man. Fury knew, better than most people, why Tony didn't want his armor in anyone else's hands, how dangerous it was. "Iron Man is aware of that," he said. "That particular bodyguard has been fired and replaced. Wishing that our problems didn't exist doesn't help anyone. We have to move forward, not dwell on previous mistakes. SHIELD is still involved in several patent lawsuits with SI, which would make a business relationship extremely," Tony paused, searching for a word that would not raise eyebrows in polite company, "awkward. If the judge rules in our favor, SHIELD will have to compensate us for their unauthorized use of Stark designs."
New York.
Tony and Jan followed him to the lab, Clint trailing along behind them, his bow still held loosely in one hand. As Hank started to set up his work station, he unstrung his bow and ran his hands carefully up and down its length, feeling for flaws or weaknesses. Hank pointed to the far side of the lab without looking up. "Take it over there before you break something."
Bucky had carried that copy of
Loki's finger slid slowly down the side of his face, coming to rest under his chin. "If you reconsider, Son of Odin, you have but to call me. I am always willing to negotiate. You have but to hold this ring, and utter my name, and I shall hurry hence to do thy bidding." Her hand closed around his right wrist, gripping just hard enough to remind him that she could crush every one of the delicate bones there with a single squeeze, and forced his clenched fingers open, folding them closed again around something hard and round.
Hank blinked, his attention suddenly utterly focused on Don.  It was the kind of look some of the surgeons Don had known had gotten when they'd opened up a patient, or that Tony gave machines.  To be on the receiving end of it was disconcerting.
"I believed that I did," Thor corrected. "I have learned that there is more that I do not know."
had altered their memories, too.
Steve looked back over his shoulder to see Clint climbing through the hole in the door, bow in one hand, but quiver conspicuously empty of arrows.
"You should have picked better allies.  At this rate, we'll have you on the ground long before Sin gets here with the spear."
He sent one more silent status update to Steve's communicator, and fired his boot jets.
"We haven't run the second-level tests yet," Hank protested. Expecting him to work out in the training simulation room was unfair; the mansion had a perfectly good gym with weights and punching bags and brand new exercise equipment expensive and fancy enough to make luxury health spas weep with envy, and, most importantly, nothing in it to remind him of the powers he wasn't able to use.
Visiting the mansion in order to speak to Jarvis, or Captain America, or another of his teammates, or to discuss strategy with them, or to perform any number of other duties required of him as an Avenger... He had decided that those did not violate his oath. Not as long as he still slept elsewhere.
Strange, Steve thought, was in his element.
After a few long moments during which all of the victims of the toxin failed to move, Tony let himself relax, hunching forward to ease the ache in his lungs. Hank's antidote really did work, it seemed, even if the part of him that had seen one too many horror movies kept expecting one of the men or women who had been affected to suddenly sit up and try to bite someone.
"Right." Clint said. "I see what you mean. I don't know, he seems fine to me." He shook his head. "It's still weird hearing people talk about that. I only saw it on TV. It feels kind of like it never really happened, but then someone will say something, or not say something, and it's like they're all having this secret conversation that doesn't include me."
The air felt wrong. There was chaos energy here. Energy much stronger than her own aura, stronger than the elevated levels of chaos power she had sensed in the air over the past month. That was why she hadn't felt comfortable in the room at first.
The thought made Steve feel sick to his stomach. "When was this?" he asked quietly.
Wanda blinked. "You're joking, right? This bag has half the clothes I own in it." She hefted the duffle bag, which was, admittedly, large, but still barely big enough to contain a week's worth of clothing, when you added shoes, and offered Jan a wry smile. "I usually try to travel light, but we didn't know how long this would take."
Then she was gone, and the mirror showed only Doom himself, alone in an empty cell.
"I was a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants long before I was an Avenger."
"I'm disappointed in you, Victor."  The voice seemed to come from everywhere at once.
"As current chair-person, I hereby call this week's Avengers meeting to order."
Clint couldn't blame her. He sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to see them. Looking at Wanda sitting there on the lab bench was bad enough.
In order to avoid ruining Logan's attempt to pretend that  he was only at the Blue Note by accident, Steve and the others had sat  down at the table next to his, rather than actually with him.  Peter  stared dreamily at MJ, Jessica Drew waved away the stream of free drinks  various men kept sending her, and Steve leaned his shoulder against  Tony's, sipped his coca cola, and pretended it was nineteen thirty-nine.
There was more than one reason why Hank missed the ability to shrink down.
Whatever problem might have once existed between Rhodey and Tony, they had obviously dealt with it. Even the awkwardness that Steve was thought he'd picked up on after Tony had told Rhodey that he liked men seemed to have dissipated.
Steve’s own cracked ribs had already healed, so maybe Sam had a point about the super soldier serum having a mild healing factor.  Not that he planned to admit it.
She strode forward – behind him and slightly to his right, he could hear the Falcon's hard light wings snapping out, hear Iron Man's repulsors crackling – and then she was in front of him, towering over Don by half a foot. "The day will come when you will wish that you had accepted my aid, Thunder God." She reached out and laid one finger against Don's face, just beside his left eye, the end of her talon-like nail resting against his skin. It took an exercise of willpower not to flinch.
, with years worth of scars and damage erased, that wouldn't get sick, wear out, or fail him.
"I'll do it," Clint said.
Tony was frowning at Strange as if personally offended. "This entire thing doesn't make sense. Wanda used the spear's power, and she's fine."
"You know," Sam said, after he had given Steve several silent minutes to appreciate the woodcut's workmanship, "I keep renewing my membership, but I don't think I've been here in a year."
"My point," Steve told him. "Fox News still likes to show clips from several of them. Everyone go get some sleep," he added, to the room at large. "I'm gong to call Ben Urich and tell him the press conference is being pushed back to tomorrow evening."
Tony didn’t reply.  Steve wasn’t sure he’d heard him.
Byrne, thank God, did as he was told.
Perhaps they would escape from this place yet.
He'd spent a lot of time recently staring at Steve, drinking in the sight of him. After knowing for so long that he was never going to see Steve again, it was a little bit like coming into the light, every time Tony saw him. Steve alive and breathing wasn't something he was ever going to get tired of looking at.
"You're not the only one on the team," Steve said finally, forcing the words out past the tightness in his throat. "It doesn't all come down to you. I should have seen it coming, too. We all should have." He'd taught Wanda and Clint how to fight; they, along with Pietro, had been the first team Steve had really led. And he had let both of them down. He hadn't been able to get through to Wanda, hadn't been able to save Clint.
