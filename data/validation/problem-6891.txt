Tony can hear has grown so loud, so sharp and distressing that his shoulders tense in a way it almost makes his back hurt. With every single step, every centimeter he gets closer to the exit, he gets more and more alert, more
“Ok.” Sam replies, perfectly appeased, as if it’s that simple. Steve is surprised with his easy compliance, but he has no time to dwell on it, because as soon as Sam turns his head, he blurts out:
“Well—” Tony shrugs, with all the nonchalance he doesn’t feel. “It’s not like it’s unexpected. It’s been a long time coming, I think.”
“I apologize for making you upset.” He says, and even though they all can hear it, it sounds like something that is meant only for Wanda.
She makes an annoyed click with her tongue, shaking her head minutely and raising her shoulders in a tense position. Steve can see that there’s an entire conversation going on inside her head, a struggle for what to say next, or if she should say anything at all; And Steve looks at her face and waits like a miserable soul, as if he was begging her not to break his heart.
Despite the incredibly rude phrasing given by the broadcast, not even mentioning her name, Steve has no doubt in his mind that the woman Tony is engaged to is Pepper Potts. Not only because everyone in the world knows who the CEO of Stark Industries is, but— who else would it be? Who else would Tony love enough to marry other than Pepper, the woman he adored, the one who has supported him for years, even before he was Iron Man? Steve hasn’t seen Pepper in a very long time – and when he thinks about it,
, and Steve will not back down on this argument, he will not concede the slightest possibility that Bucky might be
“I actually do.” Tony tells him. “And if we do manage to get into Wakanda, you’ll have the biggest, most advanced technological workshop at your disposal.”
Scott Lang is a twitchy, fumbling mess, eyes wide in child-like wonder and innocence, messy hair and stubble and rumpled clothes, just like Tony remembers him. He sits with hands resting on his knees, right leg bouncing anxiously as he avoids their inquiring gazes by looking around the workshop with clear nervousness in his face, browns slightly furrowed and mouth twisted in a pensive expression.
“He can only learn what Howard has given him to learn, unfortunately. I don’t think Tony has access to the internet or things of the sort. It’s a shame, really, he could learn so much more, but I do understand the need for discretion; a computer program that
T’Challa is an honorable man, much more than Steve is - he is young, but his nobility shows through all his mannerisms and actions, the confidence and serenity of a mind that is much older than the body, much wiser, much
He shakes his head, forcefully trying to dispel these thoughts, exhaling a harsh breath in a futile attempt to calm himself down. Nebula notices, and looks at him with questioning, intensely measuring eyes, awfully knowing; And for the second time since they’ve met, which hasn’t even been all that long ago, Tony finds himself taken aback with just
He purposefully shifts his weight so he won’t be able to bounce his leg, and keeps his jaw locked tight so he won’t click his teeth.
“Not me.” Tony says, maybe a little too readily, and he tries not to wince as he amends, “But in the end, it was kind of a group decision. We were down a few members, so there was extra room for her anyway.”
And Tony shudders with the strength he can see in them, with the force Nebula seems to be able to carry even when she has apparently lost it all, a force not even the entire universe could contain.
“No, of course not.” Ms. Carter huffs. “He asked my name and my designation, so I introduced myself, and told him I was a friend”.
It takes less than twenty seconds for Tony to get a little helpful not on his HUD to alert him two other people have been connected to his comm lines, and it’s shocking even to himself how much he wants to sigh in relief knowing he can now hear Natasha’s and Clint’s voices.
And then, they all look at him, expectant, and Steve can only stop himself fast enough not to splutter as he turns to Stark and asks, incredulous:
“So he’s fine now?” Scott asks, sounding a bit manic to be honest, like he’s afraid Steve’s lying or playing a prank on him.
She comes in empty-handed, calmly and quietly. Somehow, it’s exactly this kind of thing that reminds him how deadly Natasha really is; because she doesn’t look like someone who is living on the run. She never does. Steve sure feels like it, and he probably looks like it too, but Natasha always seems completely unfazed by her circumstances.
“Think about it.” Rhodey makes an open-handed gesture, as if presenting an invitation. “We all know the reason why Loki came all the way down here was to get some revenge on Thor for being King. Maybe he was being manipulated or maybe he wasn’t, but there’s no reason for him to choose
And Tony had always been so soft, so… weak to some things. Heart too fragile, even before the shrapnel, to the hits that actually weaseled between his ribs and expertly tore into the malleable, pliant, meek flesh beneath.
He captures them and changes them, she’d told him, and makes them follow his lead. They are extensions of his mania, of his arrogance and villainy, and seeing as they obeyed his commands, and Nebula clearly defied them, Tony just assumed… she and Gamora would be the defectors. The only two who managed to get out. That they had a
Steve keeps staring at her, because now he needs to hear the rest. Have they been talking this entire time? It’s… It’s sort of dangerous – not like Steve would
Which was, for starters, not true, because Tony would have definitely gone out with Steve if Steve had asked, and two - Tony knows for a
, for fuck sake, what could have he possibly done by just being asleep? He tries to rationalize it, but he has to stop himself, before his assumptions leave the realm of normal possibilities and plummet straight into catastrophizing. So he’s lost. He’s lost, and he hates it, and he squeezes her tighter in a meek effort of conveying his feelings without actually having to say them out loud, fearing that bringing them to light might be even worse than let them live under his skin.
There’s a ridiculous moment where he chews with difficulty and wipes his face at the face time, no doubt looking like a complete idiot, if the way Sam is looking at him is any indication. He wonders if there’s an old man joke coming on when Sam finishes his bagel, but it never does.
Completely at lost, Tony turns to Pepper – and Pepper’s gaze is steely, hard, unyielding stone, her teeth shut together in a false composure,
his way out of this discussion, to weasel away from it with almost disgustingly polished practice, but this is
, because Tony has already saved the world once and he’ll do it again, no matter how many times he must.
Whatever happened on this end, Steve muses, is not truly the issue; Although, it had not come without a price.
Tony knows he’s probably not being as discreet as he should with his staring, but he doesn’t really care, even if he’s being intense enough that it makes Nebula raise her gaze and look at him uncomfortably, her entire face scrunched up.
Like he’s deciding if Steve is an enemy or a friend. Like he’s panicking, a little, and if he had the armor, Steve isn’t sure he wouldn’t have called it on instinct.
cut off at the middle of a breath, surprised and confused. Natasha frowns so deeply her face must hurt, so many questions dancing behind her eyes, but she won’t say a word. Sam looks like he has completely given up trying to understand what is going on in Steve’s mind.
“We need a time-limit.” Tony gravely says, and, immediately, the entire mood of the room plummets to levels below the ground. It’s like being
It’s awful of Tony, absolutely awful to think that way – but who else would understand that feeling if not Bruce? And Thor – Thor is destined to be a king, surely he could understand the need of reassuring the people and prioritizing them instead of his own power, right? Many kings don’t, historically speaking, but this is
It has changed him, Steve recognizes. Not completely, not to the point where he doesn’t recognize himself, even though at some points, it almost looked like it did. But although he is still Steve Rogers, he is no longer the Steve Rogers that left the bunker in Siberia years ago, the Steve Rogers who abandoned his shield, the Steve Rogers who hadn’t realized how much pain he had been causing.

“And the other part was the Stone, and Maximoff.” Thor concludes. “Assuming her connection with the Scepter is what caused him to become our enemy, the Stone might also have left other things behind.”
Tony would thank her if he didn’t know any better. Who knows what sort of creepy telepathic conversation they’re having right now. He doesn’t even know what Natasha is alerting him for. Is she trying to stop them from fighting? Well, that’s nice of her, but Tony doesn’t really care right now. He’ll fight Rogers if he has to, even if he is
They stare at him, aghast, all eyes dropping to the glowing shine of the reactor in his chest, resting easy over his heart, as if to protect it.
” Tony gasps, bracing himself against the table with a sudden lack of breath. “Wait – Why didn’t you
If there were even police officers nearby. Or security. Or anyone who could’ve helped Tony, in case Nebula hadn’t been an ally, but an enemy.
“And after losing her brother and her home, losing him too…” he comments, almost in a whisper. “I think she took it pretty hard. I thought it was best to leave them talking for a while.”
Vision stares at him for a long, painful minute, waiting for something more than just this… This complete numbness, but Steve has nothing to give him anymore. After a complete lack of an appropriate response, Vision turns, throwing Steve a worried glance for as long as he can manage before turning his head and walking back out, his steps light and soft, until Steve can’t hear him anymore.
He kind of wants to insist on his question, but at the same time, he doesn’t. He wants to ask so many things—
, and Tony turns to look at him on instinct, and it’s so jarring to see those blue eyes staring back with something other than the rage he last saw there, to look and see that intensity, that sad, deep, tight sorrow simmering below the surface, and to feel it weight on him like a physical thing, like a touch he cannot brush off. His eyes, the beard, the dark uniform - it gets under Tony's skin, somehow. “What happened out there? When he snapped his fingers?”
Guessing never did him any favors. And with his mind becoming a game of dodging landmines, landmines that sound like
, the one with his shield vandalized in plain sight, a mockery of spilled blood and fear, Steve is holding tight to whatever information about them he can find. He wishes he could make this better, that he could send a message to the world and
Nebula seems by FRIDAY’s existence. He clears his throat softly, trying his best not to be so obvious about his sniff, and says, “FRIDAY, this is Nebula, but you can call her Avatar. Nebula, this is my girl, FRIDAY.”
The visitor sighs somberly. “You have to come with me. Disappear. Leave all sensitive material and dangerous equipment behind, and work to take down HYDRA from the inside.”
. Tony has no idea. This entire thing is not making much sense to him right now. He needs a break, he needs to eat and sleep, and maybe tomorrow this whole thing will be a little less impossible, a little less outrageous than it is right now.
“What about the buildings?” Bruce asks, from where he’s standing near the jet, from the point with most visibility from the ground, away from the smoke. “There might be people trapped in them!”
“I’ve updated his code a little bit.” Howard says suddenly, startling her, and she almost knocks down the keyboard when she shoves herself back and around to find him leaning against the doorframe.
For a second, he thinks he heard that wrong. But he knows he didn’t. And immediately he feels his defenses rising, arming his feelings like a tank, ready for a fight. “I’m sorry?”
Tony waits for a second, the silence torturous and the wait even more so, but Nebula doesn’t elaborate further. “No one else?”, he anxiously presses.
“Them, those four.” Rhodey points to them discretely. “They said they passed a place, it looked like a school, but there was someone inside screaming about…
T’Challa watches him for a moment, perhaps waiting for Steve to say something else, but he never does. He doesn’t know what else to say. He’d like to offer help in revising the Accords, but he can’t, and he’d like to ask T’Challa more about Tony, but he won’t. Steve has done what he could. He has positioned himself against the Accords, and now he has to wait to see how they develop; and he has given Tony a way to reach him, and he has to wait for him to make the phone call. The ball is no longer in his court.
“Are you alright!?” Tony inquires nervously, holding himself tightly on the sofa’s cushions with fear. “Pep!?”
Her lips give only the smallest of twitches, but there’s so much emotion in the movement he can’t look away.
A lot of it it’s just guessing work, but once he recognizes a pattern of commands, a backlog including last known flight paths, he follows it back home to the main commands registered and finds a system of coordinates. It’s like the world’s most unnecessarily complicated GPS. There are some specific locations, recurring numbers showing up sometimes more than four times across the entire log, but unfortunately, Tony doesn’t know what any of them mean. He has no idea where they lead to.
“He kept me alive, for one. You’d think for someone who was so adamant in killing us he would have done it at the first chance he got. I was vulnerable.” Natasha muses, echoing Tony thought’s so closely it almost makes him break out in hives.
, he said once, and Tony can still remember his voice perfectly, the slight tilt of sarcasm, highlighted by the now deeper tone of his puberty,
these people, when he has spent so long relearning how to fight alone, how to make the tough choices even if it killed him inside. He doesn’t have the time to adjust to the idea that this is how it is now, that he’ll have to find a way to make all of these people not to step on each other while trying to help, that they might not be able to finish their mission because they lost their rhythm, they’re completely out of sync.
“Definitely upset.” Bruce murmurs to Thor, not nearly as silently as he thinks. “Is that why you weren’t together? When I fell down here, and Thanos was coming? Because of this Accords?”
He genuinely didn’t think it would turn into a fight, he thought it would be safe enough, even more so if he gave the kid an upgraded suit, but still – he should have known. He should have at least thought
at them, listening in without even attempting to disguise it. Although, Tony ruefully thinks, what’s the point in trying?
And just like he predicts, Bruce’s gaze fills with something darkly sorrowful, something that holds a terrible
“You ok, man?” Sam asks, quietly, but when Steve hears the lock click he shifts his gaze to the door, just a second before it opens, and the sound is what startles Sam into looking backwards, successfully interrupting their entire conversation.
Pepper’s eyes go unfocused, lost deep inside her memories, and Tony knows the question is probably much harder to answer than it should be, that she’s probably completely out of touch with time, that the hours blurred together so messily in her panic and anxiety that the past, the present and the future are no more than muddy water, than grime and mud, a mess that’s almost impossible to clean and make clear again.
It’s hard to accept the disparities between who he was and who he is, what he wished for and what actually happened, what is
“Yeah, Cap. You two really made heart eyes at each other at every chance you got. It was disgusting to watch.” Natasha replies, equally blunt. And then she continues, after a soft sigh, “I mean it, you know? You are very different people. You are practical when he’s rambling, he improvises when you don’t have time to plan. You saved his life, and he saved yours. And you two saved ours. Every time.”
“It was…” He falters. “It was just a safety measure. I know how you feel about the armor. I know you don’t…”
So, he pushes his lips into a thin line, and nods curtly, hoping uselessly that Bucky won’t push the subject.

“Who are you to talk, Tony?” Clint bellows, and even though Natasha restrains him with a sure grip on his shoulders, it’s not enough to contain the rage that he shoots at Tony with his mere words. “Huh? Who are
He couldn’t be the same Tony who was working on his own when he was dying from Palladium poisoning, he couldn’t be that wild card whose only plan was “attack”. He changed for the Accords, he changed for Pepper, he changed for Peter, and for himself. Those two years after the Accords were first implemented where absolute hell, yes, with the Compound’s empty hallways and the ghosts of happy memories that now couldn’t be trusted anymore – but they had also been some of the most important years of Tony’s life.
, but Tony does care for him. He cares a lot. So yes, they go to dinner, and Tony starts spending more time with Steve as he catches up with the movies he lost, as he brings up questions after finishing one of the many history books he has bought, as Tony gifts him a phone and they spend hours arguing over whether he should have a Twitter account or not. It’s so ridiculously
“She knows me too well.”, he says, faking smugness, and he hopes his eyes, gleaming with unshed tears, or the soft choke on his voice don’t give away all the softness inside that is beating vulnerable and tender on his chest.
He has no idea what makes him say what he says next – maybe he can’t stand the silence, maybe he is afraid of his own mind and what he’ll find there, maybe… Maybe he’s afraid he is
Pepper, it's been a pleasure to write your arc. There's so much more I'd like to say but I can't, because I couldn't possibly say them through Tony's eyes - some things, come from Pepper's heart and her heart alone, and no other character would never do them justice. Maybe sometime in the future. And there are
“And as a King… My reasons are not nearly as simple as my actions as the Black Panther.” He pauses, because his words sound so heavy Steve can imagine how he feels them on his tongue, the same way they all do when they talk about it, unable to ignore.  “Right and wrong are rarely so easy to define, Agent Romanov. I cannot blame you for acting as you think it’s right. I can only hope you don’t regret the choice you make.”
, the thing Tony heard over and over again when he was a child, when scientists like Sagan and Toon talked about men like his father like they were men who would help the US and the USSR to destroy the world. Tony had been the
Tony leans to the side, mostly using the pressure of the unknown person with him to keep himself supported, as his left arm is mostly numb and is barely doing anything to hold his weight. He looks over the person’s shoulder – a
“Well,” Tony asked as he rifled through the cabinet, grabbing napkins and paper plates. “What do you think?”
Steve kissed back like a man on a mission, lips soft and probing, tongue sweeping into Tony’s mouth like Steve was trying to learn every secret part of him. Steve’s hands slid into Tony’s hair, soft, gentle, almost reverent, and Tony whined, a little noise that was barely audible over the sounds of their lips coming together.
“Yep.” Steve sipped his coffee slowly, and Tony waited to see if he would elaborate. “She’s better. Right now. They don’t like to throw the term remission around lightly, so it’ll be a while before she’s officially out of the woods, but… Things are okay. They weren’t for a while, but we’re better. For now.” Steve set the coffee down on the table and rubbed a hand over his face. He looked tired, like the weight of everything had just settled on his shoulders. “The bills are just left over from her last treatments and her last hospital stay. It’s not cheap, and our insurance wouldn’t cover everything. Haven’t lost the house yet, but the longer I have to put off payment, the more it seems like a possibility.”
friends who had kids. Or maybe he just needed to make more friends. Spending day after day with his attorneys and his father’s executor could get old pretty fast.
Tony hadn’t been expecting that. He’d been approached by his fair share of interested strangers, but nobody so tall and blonde and handsome had ever said he looked
The weekend finally came, and along with it, his mother’s piano. They’d somehow managed to get it into the house - Tony really didn’t want to know how - and he stared at it for a long time, not sure how he felt about having it in his space. Before he could even convince himself to sit down on the bench, he took a picture of it and sent it to Steve. Steve's reply came almost instantaneously.
Steve was right. Steve had told him. Not just that first time, when they’d talked at the table, but several times after, when Tony had hinted that it might be time for Steve to accept help. Tony hadn’t listened. Tony had thought he knew better. There was still a part of Tony that thought he was right and Steve was wrong.
When they were done with the children’s songs, he tucked the book away and pulled out another piece, one he hadn’t expected to find. The pages were old, and they’d clearly been damaged by the light, but the music was still readable. “My Mom had a thing for older songs,” Tony said to Carter. “I know this one from a really sappy movie.” Tony began to play the song,
He saw Steve look him over, saw the empathy and concern on Steve’s face. “Are you alright?” Steve asked.
“You know,” Steve said, and this time he was the one to crouch down to Carter’s level. “That’s an excellent idea. What do you say, Tony? Can we treat you to some ice cream?”
They drank a glass of wine each, sitting together on the love-seat, close but not quite touching. Tony set his empty glass on the coffee table, and he nearly stopped breathing as Steve shifted closer, their thighs brushing together. “I need to tell you something,” Steve said.
The reality of those thoughts, of his own ulterior motives, was just starting to dawn on Tony when Steve demanded, “How did you get this money?”
“It’s… something for you,” Tony said lamely. Suddenly he’d lost all his nerve. Some cowardly part of him wanted to snatch the letter back and pretend it had never existed.
“That would make you my absolute hero.” He might’ve sounded just a little bit desperate, and he didn’t miss the way Steve’s eyebrows rose just slightly. Amusement? Interest? Tony wasn’t sure.
Tony again insisted on calling Steve a car, and he walked Steve to the door, carrying Steve’s bag for him and tucking it into the front seat.
He reached for the book full of children’s songs he’d taken out of the piano bench earlier that day. He started at the beginning and made his way from one song to the next, singing softly, trying to keep his eyes on the music enough to read it while Carter danced and wiggled around the room. It was oddly therapeutic, playing music for someone other than himself. And Carter was too young to know how to hold back her enthusiasm.
Tony couldn’t do anything but stand there looking guilty, wishing he could melt into the floor and disappear. Steve shook his head, slamming the two halves of the check down on the table. The sound rang in Tony’s ears, harsh and angry.
“Can I get you a cup of coffee?” Steve asked after Bucky had made his way upstairs. “I just made a fresh pot.”
“I…” Steve trailed off, searching Tony’s face. “I don’t think I’m interested in being just friends.”
By the look of it, Steve’s house was a family home that he’d inherited, or else bought from his family. It didn’t look old, necessarily, but well-loved. It had a kitchen with a window that looked out on the backyard, which seemed fitting for a man with a family - or with a daughter, at any rate. When Steve led him to the dining room, they all but bumped into another man with brown hair and big blue eyes.
Tony was met with two expectant faces, and there was no force on earth that could’ve compelled him to say no. “You know, my number one rule is
“So,” Steve said as he was bundling Carter into the car, which Tony was relieved to see had been outfitted with the booster seat he’d requested. Just because he didn’t always like kids, didn’t mean he didn’t know anything about them. “You think you’ll find yourself back at the park next week?”
He finally managed to drag himself into the shower, where he stood under the scalding water until his skin was red. He pulled on sweats and a tee, then sat down at the piano, playing through his mother’s old song books until his fingers were sore.
“I would never,” Steve said, sounding a little devious. He slid into the car next to Carter. “I’ll text you on the way home so you’ll have mine, too.”
Steve sat down in the chair beside him, mug held between his palms. He seemed relaxed, as if Tony’s invasion of his privacy hadn’t really bothered him at all. “It’s alright,” Steve said. “You would’ve found out eventually.”
“Of course. It was fun. Goodnight, Tony.” Out of nowhere, Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand, squeezing it gently.
“You still did exactly what I asked you not to do! Tony, I told you, I want to do this on my own. I don’t want assistance, I don’t want charity.”
“I know.” Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand, and Tony looked up in surprise. “Bucky says I’m stubborn. That it was stupid for me to let pride get in the way of something that would really help my kid. And me. As usual, he’s right. I’m sorry I shut you out. It wasn’t fair.” Slowly, gently, Steve threaded their fingers together. He squeezed Tony’s hand. Tony squeezed back. “Bucky also says I was stupid to let you get away once, and I sure as hell shouldn’t do it again.”
“It’s okay, I’ve got it.” Steve swept a gentle hand through Tony’s hair. Tony felt his whole body relax in an instant, and he leaned back against the counter to keep himself from pressing forward. Steve always handled Tony with such care. Tony had never felt that kind of gentleness, never gotten that kind of attention from anyone. He closed his eyes, just for a few seconds, then blinked them open when he felt Steve’s palms cradling his face.
They stayed outside long after they’d finished their pizza, until the sky began to darken and the sun set. Steve told stories about his childhood, and about Carter, most of which had the effect of making Tony laugh out loud. It felt good to laugh. He didn’t get to laugh much anymore.
Steve stood and stepped in close, and suddenly Tony realized just how tall Steve was. Steve crowded into his space, his hands finding Tony’s waist as he leaned down to kiss him again. “Lead the way,” he said, following Tony toward the stairs.
“Always,” Tony said. The one habit he’d never break. No matter how spectacularly he blew up his personal life, he would say ‘always’ like everything was perfect. Every time. He shifted from foot to foot, uncomfortable. Even if Steve was here to make amends, Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for it. “Um. Can I help you with something?”
Steve disappeared into the kitchen, and Tony busied himself checking a few emails before setting his phone down on the table. There was no tablecloth, which probably made for easier cleanup, and there were papers strewn across the center, like they’d been brushed aside in a hurry. Tony didn’t mean to snoop, but he’d been so buried in documents all week, it was like his hands moved all by themselves to pick up one of the papers, then another, then another. Medical bills. Hospital. Durable medical equipment. Prescriptions. There were some complicated drugs here. And some absolutely enormous costs. What did Steve have that was so expensive? He didn’t look sick.
It was… It was unsettling, in the most nerve-wrecking and volatile way possible, all madness and raging emotions and an explosive reaction he just couldn’t contain.
the malice and the mocking he misses, but the banter, the feeling of always being on edge, of being kept on his toes at every single goddamned second, knowing that, at any moment, Tony Stark could turn his world upside down.
The information Tony had given him about the updates could not be random. He thinks about this every single day since Howard and Maria’s passing, because he knows somewhere in Tony’s database, there’s a secret responsible for the attack in December of 1991. There must be. But he doesn’t know how to find it, and no matter how many times he asks, Tony refuses to tell him.
“Thank you, T’Challa.” Steve exhales, feelings his lips twitch in a semblance of a smile, a genuine smile, something he hasn’t done in a very long time.
, out of all of them, is something that brings her some peace of mind, even if it’s just a little. “We couldn’t find a place to stay in this building, so we’ll be here for tonight, and tomorrow we’ll look for a new hotel that’s closer.”
Tony walks away, pretending he’s not hyper aware of the sound of Rogers’ steps echoing behind him, twin beats against the floor, as they both follow Rhodey out and proceed to have the most awkward ride of their lives; The three of them dead silent in the enclosed space, pretending they’re not aching with the instincts to shift and move to try to dispel some of the suffocating stuffiness of the elevator.
He opens his mouth, not even sure of what he wants to say, so he opens and closes it like a fish before finally managing to ask, “Sorry, are we talking about that same… sister? Gamora? Quill’s… whatever, girlfriend, or something?”

“Allowing just one guy to use it is just them assuming that this one guy knows better than to abuse his Time-powers, is that it?” Barton asks.
The others stare back, uneasily, but they force themselves to relax. After a few seconds, they breathe, they pause, and then, they truly retreat, eyes soft and mellow again, dragged down by their grief, and there is no place left for the misplaced rage to burn beneath the bone-deep exhaustion.
sounding very much like he doesn’t realize other people can hear him – like he used to do before, and, it pains him to admit, he had almost forgotten what it sounded like.
“Thanos doesn’t think he can lose.” Nebula snarls. “He thinks whatever happens, the Stones will always come to him. He’s insane. He thinks it’s his…
Even inside the jet, Tony can feel a slight sting on his cheeks, around his nose, skin pulled tight, and he’s twitching in place nervously, adrenaline pumping strong in his veins, and he can’t wait to step out of this goddamned Quinjet and head to his lab, to tinker, to
a fan of kids - she was cute. She wore a flowery pink dress over a white long-sleeve shirt, with purple stockings and the smallest Mary Janes he had ever seen. She couldn’t have been more than three feet tall. White-blonde hair fell past her shoulders, held out of her face by a half-pony-tail that sat high on her head.
“Come to the party,” Steve said, soft and persuasive. “Tinkerbell will be there. And we’re having ice cream."
Tony tilted his head up, giving the man a once-over. He was wearing converse, loose jeans, a t-shirt, and a flannel jacket lined with fleece. Pretty suitable dad clothes for this time of year, if you asked Tony. Pretty good looking dad, too. There was no doubt the man was fit. Athletic. Attractive. Tony couldn’t decide if the man’s face was more reminiscent of Abercrombie model or Disney prince. Maybe it was a little of both.
“Don’t be sorry,” Tony said. “I… Shit,” he repeated, because once apparently wasn’t enough. “Are there not grants for that sort of thing, or… I don’t know. Charities? Hell, I’d give you Howard’s money if I could,” he thought out loud, only half joking.
Damn it, Tony was slow, and apparently getting slower. Steve had come alone, at night. He’d brought wine. He looked impossibly handsome. He’d worn that shirt and those pants and he was biting his lip and Tony wanted to
“Fine.” This conversation wasn’t going the way Tony had planned, and he couldn’t help the resentment that spilled into his voice. “It’s Dad’s. Howard’s.” The slip made him want to kick himself. He hadn’t called Howard ‘Dad’ in years. Why now? “The estate finally released the funds. I transferred them to the foundation, and then wrote a check to you.”
He sent messages. Messages of apology. Messages asking what Steve wanted him to do, if Steve was okay, if Steve was ever going to talk to him again. No response. The radio silence was deafening, and Tony still couldn’t figure out if he deserved it. He considered deleting Steve’s number from his phone. He thought about throwing his phone out the window, but that would have been a childish, not to mention expensive, outburst. He settled for turning it off and tucking it under his pillow.
Tony crouched back down to Carter’s eye level, holding out his hand. “Nice to meet you, Carter. Officially.” She stared at his hand for a moment, then shook it hard. Tony laughed again. He’d already laughed more times today than he had in the past week. He was starting to rethink this whole ‘not a fan of kids’ thing. Maybe he needed
“This is Bucky,” Steve said. “He’s an old friend. He babysits for me when I work. Or when I need a few hours to just be a grown-up.”
It wasn’t until dinnertime when his stubbornness returned full force. He went up to the spare room and rifled through the file cabinets until he found the checkbook connected to his trust fund. He spent another ten minutes looking for a pen - most everything he did was digital nowadays, except signing the paperwork for his thrice damned inheritance - then wrote another check to Steve. He dug through the desk drawer and managed to find some bright orange post-it notes. He stuck one to the front of the check, scribbling a note on it.
At the end of the evening, Steve helped Tony stow the leftover pizza in the fridge, and Tony called his private car service to take Steve and Carter home. Steve had resisted at first, but Tony had argued that it was easier than calling a cab, and it was one expense that was already covered, since his drivers were paid a monthly fee.
He was famous for blowing off important investors and falling asleep during board meetings. Or at least, he had been. Was he becoming a better person now that he’d finally gotten out from under Howard’s shadow? Or was Steve just easy to listen to?
Tony dislike kids? Or had he not met enough of them to judge?), Tony reached out and took the flower crown, setting it on top of his head. “How do I look?”
“Another story you won’t find in the papers. You’re getting the inside scoop here, Steve Rogers.” He looked down at his hands, thoughtful. “It’s been a few years. When my mom died, I couldn’t find it in me to play. And then when I moved out of the house and away from the old piano, I just never bought a new one.”
“This is our usual spot, Monday, Wednesday, Friday,” Steve said.  “If you ever wanted to join us again.”
Tony closed the door and waved goodbye, and the towncar pulled down the street and turned left, disappearing from view. As he trudged back inside and closed the door, he felt his pocket vibrate. He pulled out his Starkphone, and a text appeared on his locked screen.
This was spinning out of his control too fast, and Tony didn’t know what to do. “I know that. I know not everything can be perfect. I just thought-”
“Nice to meet you, Tony.” Steve looked down at the girl. “This is Carter. You two have obviously already met.”
“Steve, this is exactly what charity is for. For people who need help and don’t have other means to get it!” Tony knew that Steve was proud. Tony understood that Steve didn’t want someone else to ride in on a white horse and save him. But Steve needed to think about the bigger picture. He could lose his house. He could lose Carter. And if Steve lost either of those things, then Tony would lose Steve. Tony wasn’t about to let that happen.
They left the park a few hours before sunset, walking together to Tony’s favorite pizzeria. Halfway through the walk, Carter insisted on holding Tony’s hand, and she swung their arms every couple of steps. Tony smiled to himself. He couldn’t help it. It was cute.
Steve shook his head, like he knew that wasn’t true but didn’t want to waste his breath arguing. “I actually came to bring you this.” Steve handed him a bright pink envelope. “Carter said she wanted to invite the Piano Man to the party. That’s her name for you now.”
Tony hadn’t had any idea that looking at those documents would be opening that kind of can of worms. “Shit.” There was nothing else to say, or nothing that made sense.
in his will. Things I have to accomplish before I get my inheritance. And I’m making my way down the list.”
Slowly, Steve opened the envelope. Tony stood stock still, waiting. Bracing for a bad reaction. Hoping for a good one. After what felt like hours, Steve looked up at Tony with accusing eyes. “Explain this to me.”
The party was an unmitigated success. When Tony arrived, he was greeted at the door by no fewer than four of Carter’s friends, as well as Carter herself. She grabbed his hand and tugged him inside, dragging him through the house and toward the backyard where Tinkerbell was setting up a magical play area. Steve had even filled up a kiddie pool, and Tony wondered if he had any hope of keeping his clothes dry through the end of the party.
Tony and Steve texted regularly throughout the week, and Tony found himself holding his phone under the table during board meetings just in case, waiting for the next message. He knew they were supposed to be just friends. Still, part of him wondered if they could ever be more.
At first he was embarrassed that whoever it was had caught him at home on a Saturday night. He was Tony Stark, for goodness’ sake. He used to throw parties that lasted all weekend long. Now he was sitting inside alone on a Saturday reading a book. What was happening to him? Maybe he was finally growing up. Too bad Howard wasn’t around to see it.
Tony took a deep breath and let it out slowly, hands sliding into the pockets of his slacks. “Yeah, well. Howard and I had a complicated relationship.” He let a little humor creep into his voice. “That’s the story you won’t get in the papers. Don’t tell anyone.”
Tony hadn’t expected the man running the ice cream truck to hand Carter the container of sprinkles, nor had he expected his whole hand to be covered in the colorful sugary pieces. This was a day full of surprises, he supposed. And he couldn’t find it in himself to be upset by any of it. He ate the ice cream, sprinkles and all, and didn’t object when Steve offered him a wet wipe to clean up.
“It doesn’t matter anyway. I can’t give you Howard’s money because I don’t have access to Howard’s money, because it’s being kept safe in some sort of super secret account until I ‘clean up my act.’” He hadn’t meant to sound so resentful. It had just sort of slipped out, like it always did when he talked about Howard. He stared down into his coffee cup, then took a sip, looking up to meet Steve’s expectant, curious eyes.
“I was sorry to hear about your father,” Steve said, probably thinking it was the polite thing to say.
A few boxes of pizza in hand, Tony led them back to his townhome. It was an old brownstone, and from the outside it was starting to show its age. Inside, the place was fully restored, with brand new hardwood, a fireplace on every floor, and modern furnishings. It wasn’t completely to Tony’s tastes, but he’d let someone else design it before he moved in, and he hadn’t seen a reason to bother changing anything.
Three hours and two scoops of ice cream later, all the guests had left. Steve was doing the cleaning outside while Bucky handled the inside, grumbling about how much glitter was stuck to the kitchen’s tile floor. Carter had found Tony and insisted they watch a TV show together. After the first few minutes, she had clambered onto his lap, resting her head against his chest.
Tony clenched his jaw. Swallowed. Listened to his own heartbeat pounding in his head. He could barely see through the tears gathering in his eyes. He turned around and stalked out, his footfalls quick and quiet, the only sound the screen door clattering closed behind him. He made it to his car with seconds to spare before the panic swallowed him whole.
That was a dirty trick. Tony thought back to that day at the park, his hand covered in sprinkles. “You know I can’t break my number one rule.” He sniffed, then shoved his hands into the front pocket of his hoodie. “I’ll be there.”
Tony pursed his lips. He thought about saying something snide, but decided it wasn’t worth the effort. Besides, he didn’t want Steve to think of him that way anyway. He didn’t want Steve to know him as difficult, snarky Tony Stark like everyone else did. “I’ve been dealing with… things. For Howard. Mountains of paperwork. So many lawyers. I think I’d rather have my teeth pulled.”
“No problem.” He heard Bucky’s soft footfalls behind him, and then the creaking sounds of the staircase. He grabbed the remote and turned the TV off, standing up and making his way to the kitchen.
Tony wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. “Well,” he said, just barely holding it together, “she has good taste in friends.”
Tony laughed. When was the last time anyone had used the word beautiful in relation to him? Not since his company had released the new Iron Man tech, and that hadn’t really been about him, had it? It had been about his machines. Still, somehow it was easy to take a compliment from this small little person and believe it. She’d said it so easily, like it was an indisputable fact. Maybe that was what Tony needed to make people see him differently: not a suit of armor, but a flower crown.
When Tony was at work, he threw himself headlong into his projects. He paid attention during meetings. He asked questions and demanded answers. He was suddenly more involved than he had ever been, and he couldn’t tell if his colleagues were pleased or terrified. At home, Tony couldn’t stop feeling lonely and empty. He struggled to sleep at night. He thought about buying more alcohol, but didn’t. He fell into a mindless routine, staying awake until just before dawn, sleeping for a few hours, then ordering takeout and sitting in front of the television. He was doing just that, eating egg noodles out of a takeaway carton, when the doorbell rang.
Tony snorted. “Ouch. You wound me.” He led the way up the stairs, hanging onto the stack of pizzas and plates with one hand as he nudged the door open with the other. Steve and Carter followed him up. Tony set the boxes down on the wooden table, then pulled out three chairs. Carter ran straight to the table to claim a chair, but Steve paused, arrested by the New York skyline.
“That’s too much pixie dust,” Tony said. “Now I”m going to fly away!” He jumped up and took off at a run, and Carter chased after him until Tinkerbell recaptured everyone’s attention.
Tony thought about saying no. He’d never told anyone about the piano, about his mother. About what it meant to him. He wasn’t sure he was ready to invite anyone else into that mess in person. Still, it was one of the conditions in Howard’s will. And he’d probably be asked to prove he’d played it, which would be easier if someone was there to listen. Steve had trusted Tony with the gritty details of his financial problems without batting an eye. Tony could trust Steve with this. “I’m having the piano moved into my place next weekend. You could come over then.”
–, but she doesn’t understand that Tony can't stop this. Not after what he saw in that cave, and the chance to stop it all so close to his own reach.
“We’ll just have to be convincing.” Rogers decides. “Maybe General Okoye is not willing to listen, but I believe Shuri would be. She seemed… understanding – from what I could tell.”
“That’s going to be some news tomorrow.” Tony mumbles to himself, leaning back in the chair. “The press is going to put us through hell.”
“But he—” Tony chokes on air, and he coughs a little, trying uselessly to get rid of the oddly tight feeling in his throat. “He needed

“These batteries.” Tony interrupts, before they can start their maddening debate again. “Could you make them yourself?”
Tony has to fight very hard to resist the urge to roll his eyes. Lang is so weird. Really, why did Pym choose him? Not that he’s a bad guy, far from it, but Pym and Lang, working together… Tony is having a hard time wrapping his head around that one.
“You would know.” Tony jabs, through a false smirk - if he dares to stretch his lips too wide, there will be too many bared teeth to disguise it as a smile.
Ross huffs out a weak laugh and turns to leave, not sparing a single glance back. “Don’t forget we have a meeting tomorrow at noon. You better bring me some good news, Stark.”

hits him; Just as unexpected as the calm, as the completely abnormal reaction to just stand there and not do anything, even as Barton goes unhinged and crazed right before his eyes. Good.
Princess Shuri finds him first thing in the morning, while he’s wandering back inside, walking through the halls like a damned ghost.

And the moment grows heavy between them, too heavy for words, so they say nothing – But Nebula’s hands are amicable on his wound. Careful. There is no wrath in them.
, and Tony jerks in surprise, his entire brain stopping in its tracks so suddenly it's disorienting. “We didn’t have the best relationship.”
“Yeah, uh. Morning.” Tony replies, after a weird, awkward attempt to clear his throat. It feels horribly sore, and he’s not sure if it’s from the noises or the
He won’t pretend he understands what exactly goes between Wanda and Vision, and what kind of feelings keeps bringing them closer to each other.
“Of course.” He exhales, and tries to put on a reassuring smile, though he knows it barely tugs at the edges of his lips, more grimace than happiness. “It’s fine. Yeah. You’re always welcome, Smurfette. You too, furball.”
The phrasing is a little distasteful, maybe. It certainly leaves a somewhat dry feeling in his mouth, like he’s just swallowed chalk; But it seems like it’s just him, because no one else reacts as if it sounded as bad as it felt. It’s a temporary divide, Tony should keep in mind. It’s to make it faster. They’ll come back. And so will Nebula and Rocket, and then, they’ll fit all the pieces together and they’ll make this right. That’s all it is.
Wanda squeezes back, her eyes shiny and her smile hopeful, and she repeats, “I’ll see you soon. Be careful.”
They steer the conversation to another direction after that, deliberately avoiding all topics that might be too painful to approach. They talk for hours. It’s hard to keep the conversation light after that kind of beginning, but they do try. They talk about Bucky himself, and how he feels. They talk about Wakanda. They talk about time.
” She growls fiercely, and Nebula throws a glance at him, his expression betraying a hint of curiosity at Pepper’s callous tone.
he is with her attitude. This is not the time for this. Natasha is clearly emotionally compromised about something, something she won’t let Steve or Sam help her with, and throwing bitter words at the King of Wakanda is not the way to act, if you know you’re already imposing on someone’s hospitality. She sounds
“The Benatar.” Tony reminds them, raising his eyebrows, and then turns to Thor. “It can cut through shortcuts across space, or something like that. Nebula did the same thing when she brought us back. Would you be able to guide them to the forge if we needed to?”
“You want two aliens and a scientist with no Hulk walking around the massive mob with torches for no reason?” Clint asks, in a sarcastic tone.
Steve, never trusting anyone and always trying to carry the entire world on his shoulders, unable to give up on his ground,
So, there you have it: Chapter 3, Part 1. Brace yourselves, this is the beginning of the downhill. And if you don't see what the hell Wanda has to do with Bucky and Siberia yet, don't worry.
” Bruce continues. “It’s not… the first something like this has happened in history. The world was once in a ten-year-long winter, with far less than what we have today, and we still made it out.”
“I do not know the name you use, but yes, it sounds like the structure surrounding the star.” Thor affirms. “Stars are dangerous to approach, since they pull all objects who dare to come close into their cores. The structure is circular, and it surrounds it completely, so it stops the pull of the star from causing damage to whatever is outside. Since all power is enclosed, when you open it, it beams light into the forge, lighting it up.”
, to the man Steve knew ever since he was a child and no bigger than a goddamned twig. He wanted to give Bucky back the life that had been taken away from him. That’s all it was.
SHIELD’s satellites are probably still running, he guesses. Fury used to have the biggest database in the world, the very own database HYDRA tried to use when Rogers stopped their attack in Washington in 2014, and if there’s one thing that Tony is sure of, more than anything else, is that Nick Fury is a wary, sneaky son of a bitch, and that database has

Under the smoke. They can see it, when the Quinjet starts to turn, and the wind blows strong enough to clear the sight, to see it beneath the rubble.
. It is nothing too serious, nothing involving blood or any kind of objects, but it does mention some unhealthy behaviour and unconscious self-harm in Steve's part, such as neglecting his basic needs and seeking risky and painful experiences, and it's always important to be careful with your mental health. So please, be safe.
Because just like he can remember Natasha’s resentful stare and her harsh, accusatory voice, he can also remember her
Maybe she did. Maybe that’s what happened. Maybe they opened Tony up and when they realized how messed up he is inside, when they saw the huge lump of the mesh rearranging itself inside Tony’s body to keep him from bleeding out – too much, at least –, they realized they wouldn’t be able to cut it out without killing him. And Nebula knew. Nebula knew the mesh responded to him, the same way the armor did. And she instructed them, not giving away too much — just enough, enough so they could help Tony, because Nebula is the wariest being Tony has ever met and she obviously didn’t trust anyone. She
He doesn’t listen. He keeps pushing, distressed, even as the wall pushes him back. Even when he can’t breathe, even when he starts to sag and his sweat turns torturously cold. Even when his entire body goes numb and heavy, and he feels himself go empty, even as his mind still burst with static and jolts with unexplained adrenaline and anxiety, a muted cry of despair that goes farther and farther away with every beat; Until he feels like he’s once again trapped inside a bubble, encased inside an armor of foam, everything dull except for the sharp edges of the fear inside his head.
He feels himself sway side to side, like a child trying to console himself, the hopeless pleas of a broken man. He’s shaking so violently, like his body doesn’t know what to do with itself. Like it doesn’t know how to respond to such agony. He feels his mind

Tony doesn’t seem to take it personally, but Steve regrets not taking his chance to give Tony a hug.
The Accords are still a sore subject for him, and he fears they always will be. A part of him hoped, even if silently and secretly, that the Accords would just fall apart after they left, that the world would realize on its own how much the Avengers are needed and how terrible it would be to keep them trapped. How petty and childish of him; but he did wish for it, even if he’d never said it to another soul.
T’Challa takes a breath, inclining his head towards Natasha’s direction, as if he’d been expecting this. When he speaks, his words are slow, considerate, and very carefully planned:
There are no fights. There are no tears. If they didn’t know better, it would be a day like any other, inconspicuous and stilted, the very same normal day in a normal life they all pretend they have, even if they all know it’s a lie. It’s not a lifestyle, it’s a
“Follow me.” Nebula says, all business, and Lang has no choice but to skittishly tag along as both Nebula and Rocket leave the view of the camera, walking towards the elevator, before FRIDAY cuts off the feed.
He would have gladly spent the rest of his life fighting her if it meant this hadn’t happened like this.
“The White House.” Barton twists his lips in shameful admittance. “We won’t get there in time to stop them.”
They were supposed to be together – maybe all of this wouldn’t have happened. Maybe they wouldn’t need to reach this point, but they
Pepper slowly steps out, walking back towards the elevator and into the Compound, still in the armor.
“He took her and what did you do?” He asks, because he has to keep pressing, has to keep her talking, so the others won’t have time to intervene and make any sort of accusation.
The lights inside the Jet go lower, enveloping them in dark, the default lighting settings when in flight – and instead of being soothing or stealthy, as it once it had felt, it now feels oppressive, dirty and cowardly, as if to hide their faces from each other as they all swallow around nothing and press their lips together in the closes thing they will ever come to a prayer, a plea to the universe that will never be voiced out loud, the useless hope that whatever they may find in DC, that it’ll be something that will not result in tragedy.
“Time to hear the verdict.” Tony tells Nebula, not as a command or a reminder, but a simple, crude remark of a fact. This is it. They need to talk about this. They need to know,
, but you do remember that I’m not the one with superhuman stamina here, right?” Tony pokes fun, bringing himself up to lean over Steve’s chest, reaching up to kiss him. Steve doesn’t deny him, despite knowing
“It will have to be.” It’s all he says, and then he shuts up completely and says nothing else at all.
“How is that any better than trying to freeze him long enough to get the Gauntlet?!” Rocket exclaims.
“The original material is an ancient metal, called Uru.” Thor explains, with the familiarity of someone who has heard or told this tale a thousand times before. “The Dwarves where the only ones skilled enough to use it. It had many forms, but they are all equal in one way: their ability to withstand grand power and magic, without coming apart.”

“It is… unlikely.” Vision hesitates. “I cannot give you any true confirmation as the trial has not occurred yet, but for now, Mr. Lang is being detained at a penitentiary in Pennsylvania, not in any prison administered by the military. It is believed his lawyer will conduct an appeal to have him transferred to a correctional facility or something similar, but it is unclear if it will be an option. I’m afraid I don’t have all details about his defense appeal quite yet.”
“We know, buddy, that’s kind of why Vision got that name.” Barton reminds him, exactly as Tony did, though he doesn’t seem unwilling to listen to Thor’s theory – but at the same time, unable to not point out the obvious conclusion.
, so weird how earnest he sounds when he says that, like he truly believes it, like he’s that man from so many years before, the one who Tony still hadn’t realized had a dark side too, the one Tony had naively believed couldn’t lie, could be trusted.
Tony stops suddenly, realizing he’s getting stressed over it again, and takes in a deep breath to calm himself down.
Something has definitely shifted from the way it was before, disrupted from its original axis when Clint, Wanda and Scott left. Or maybe when Natasha brought them the news – and only now, when the rooms are suddenly just big enough for the three of them, and not terribly cramped, he can finally feel the way his breathing echoes against the walls when he’s alone, his enhanced hearing making his own sighs resonate like the sounds of missiles cutting through air; almost silent, always deadly, no matter if no one else can hear them. Like a looming threat that only he can hear.
It’s the first time Tony has heard Bruce describe Hulk’s feelings and their symbiotic relationship with such complexity.
"Thank you, Steve." Wanda exhales, and her voice is overflowing with gratitude. "I was worried. Worried he wouldn't want to see me ever again. And now he's here, and I don't... I don't want to run away again."
“You know why.” It’s what he chooses to say. It’s the coward’s way out, he knows, but he takes it anyway. It’s not like it isn’t true. T’Challa knows. He knows why Steve is so damn worried about this. There is no need for the group therapy – Steve is not willing, nor strong enough for this right now.
But Steve can’t antagonize her. She’s Bucky primary caretaker now. There’s nothing to gain from being rude to her. She thinks she knows what’s best, he knows it, but she’s young and probably a bit too idealistic, and Steve’s known Bucky his whole life. He can help Bucky.
“Divide and conquer.” Tony half asks, half clarifies, looking at Rhodey for support, to receive back a sharp, assured nod.
“Could we ever fix this? Fix us?” Steve asks, pleadingly, feeling a surge of desperation of reassurance he doesn’t know where it comes from, all he knows is that it’s so overwhelming he almost starts shaking.
“Vision did give us important information.” Bruce offers, both as consolation and an enthusiastic reminder. “We know how to make a Gauntlet.”
They will never agree, Tony realizes, panicking slightly. On anything. They are all right and they are all wrong, because there is no right and no wrong, there is no protocol describing what they should do in case of apocalypse. But if they don’t agree, they’ll fight, and if they fight, they’ll part. That’s the thing. The thing is that Tony knows what happens when people part because the situation gets dire, he knows what happens when everyone starts following their own agenda to survive, he knows where this leads them.
“We’ll go looking for the sanctum. If we find anyone who can help, we’ll bring them back here with us.”
.” Nebula growls back, equally hushed, and pushes Tony down by his shoulders when he attempts to get up. “If you don’t stop running around you
, of what he thought he had. Get up. Get on the ship. He thinks of no more than just this, just those two easy steps, and whatever might come next is a problem he won’t think about right now.
And Steve is glad Bucky is getting help. He just wishes taking his arm off his shoulders and letting him leave didn’t feel like losing him all over again, every single time, and he doesn’t know what he can do to make it stop.
Tony knows Nebula doesn’t need his help. She might even beat him up herself for acting like she does. But it’s
Steve pokes at them, and he doesn’t flinch when the sharp sting of pain crawls up from the back of his hand into his arm.
The lower part is a little darker, and even if there is more room in between the oddly shaped honeycomb shelves, to allow a small seating area with simple wooden tables and chairs for a reading room, it still feels like an extremely private space, something that intruders should never even know the existence of, much less be invited inside.
he is the only one who was there in Siberia, he’s the only one that knows what happened – but if Steve tell them, will they understand? God, Steve wants them to understand so badly. He can’t stand to stay quiet while they argue about Bucky right in front of him, not after everything, not after so many months agonizing over every single one of his decisions and his mistakes.
“Good.” Sam nods, as if that’s all he needed to hear. But then, he pauses. “So… Where is that badass metal arm of his? Didn’t think he would just take it out while he’s on a walk.”
“Does Steve have a license?” Bruce frowns, leaning forward on his chair so he can look at the others.
, where billions of possibilities can arise, billions of chances for other people to carry on and continue to keep the world turning faster and becoming brighter, Tony's life is a more than fair trade, and he's happy to give it and make it happen, no questions asked.
“I kinda have to go with Nat on this one, Cap.” Sam says, stepping a little closer to Natasha so he can look at Steve, as if he needs to observe his posture to gauge if Steve is really telling the truth. “You just don’t do shit like that, man. That’s a huge secret. And the guy was your
Steve waits for a few seconds, wondering if she will do anything besides just stand there, and when she doesn’t he decides to step forward, trying to keep his steps light and silent, the atmosphere of the cold night and the fake anonymity that the darkness grants them feeling far too sacred to be disturbed by the loud sound of his boots.
That answered that question, then. No other adults at home. Still, Tony didn’t want to blow up what was clearly a potential friendship with any kind of unwanted advances. Yes, Steve was attractive. That didn’t mean they couldn’t just be friends.
“Thank you,” Tony said to Steve as Carter ran back toward the playground to play with the giant tic-tac-toe board. “You didn’t have to do that.”
In the following week, Tony made time for the park, stopping by on Monday and Wednesday. The outside air and the good company were exactly what he needed to break up the monotony of meetings and phone calls and paperwork, and more than once he was enlisted to give Carter a piggy-back ride, which he discovered was more than enough exercise for one day. He and Steve texted, sometimes late at night after Carter had gone to sleep.
and his heart nearly melted when Steve picked Carter up and danced with her. It must’ve been soothing, because Carter was asleep by the end of the song, her head heavy against Steve’s chest. Tony lifted his hands and stood up slowly, closing the piano as quietly as possible.
The next time Steve and Tony took Carter to the park, the leaves were just starting to change colors. The three of them played tag - Carter won every time - and then Carter made flower crowns for each of them. When it was Tony’s turn to have his crown bestowed upon him, he bowed extravagantly, saying, “Why thank you, my lady.” He knelt down, and she placed the flower crown delicately on his head. He glanced over at Steve. “How do I look?”
The invitation short circuited his brain a little. He felt warm and fuzzy and strangely validated, because for once, he’d actually made a good first impression. “I’m wrapped up in meetings for the next few days,” Tony replied. “But Friday I’m free. I’ll see you then.”
They sat in silence, ruminating, sipping their respective coffees until Steve said, “It’s more fun to play the piano for someone, isn’t it?”
The park was his new favorite place, and Steve and Carter his new favorite people. He wanted to say yes - but with his new work obligations, he couldn’t promise anything. “It’ll depend on my schedule,” he said tentatively. Then, he had a brilliant idea. “Let me give you my number, and I’ll text you when I’m free.” Tony held out a hand - without hesitating, Steve slipped his phone out of his pocket and passed it over. Tony punched in his number and added his name. “There,” he said, handing it back. “This is my actual cell phone, so it’s top secret. Don’t go giving it to reporters or weird stalkers or anything.”
Bucky was quickly becoming Tony’s new favorite person. He tried not to sound too desperately hopeful. “Yeah? And do you agree with him?”
“I was wondering if you might want some company,” Steve said. “And I brought wine.” He held up the bottle as if it was some kind of incentive. Tony couldn’t fathom how Steve hadn’t figured it out by now - Tony didn’t need any incentive to want to spend time with him. None at all. Steve’s company was more than enough.
“Thank you,” Tony said sincerely. He was about to ask the obvious question - where are your parents? - when he spotted a man jogging up to them.
The next few days of meetings brought Tony nearly to his breaking point. He seriously considered going out and buying more alcohol, then thought better of it - he’d dumped it all down the drain for a reason, and damn it, he wanted to meet all of Howard’s stupid conditions just on principle. When Friday finally rolled around, he was relieved not to have to put on a suit and tie, and even more relieved to spend the afternoon in the park.
. Tony was getting the impression that Steve was one of those good people he kept hearing about, the ones that were always kind and selfless no matter what. It felt good that someone cared, even if it was someone he’d only met a few days ago. Maybe there was something to this whole friendship thing. Did he and Steve count as friends? He wasn’t sure.
“They get bigger every year,” Steve replied, but there was no bite in the complaint. Tony wasn’t surprised. He was sure Steve enjoyed spoiling his daughter on her birthday. Plus, a bigger party meant more friends. Every kid needed friends.
Tony dropped the stack of papers as Steve walked in, but it was too late. He knew he’d been caught. He winced, glancing guiltily away as Steve set a mug of coffee down in front of him. “Sorry,” he said, wishing he could actually kick himself. “Sometimes I have an impulse control problem. And I’ve been dealing with so much paperwork I just sort of want to…” He shrugged helplessly. “Pick stuff up.”
the entire way to the door, even as he divides his focus into keeping himself aware of his surroundings, looking over his and Nebula’s shoulders every few seconds, trying his best to make sure his footsteps won’t make a sound. He takes it all in – the emptiness, the upturned waiting benches and the scattered items on the reception balcony, the dim lights down the hall to the right, the
Wong looks at him, face impassive, but at the sight of Rogers’ pinched brows and honest eyes, Wong gives him a tight, almost imperceptible smile and a small, agreeing huff; An enormous concession, considering how stoic he always is, and he walks up to the back of the room in quick strides, purposeful and knowing, and they all watch as he grabs a book with a shiny, circular design in its cover, decorated with what seems to be something that emits a faint glow right at the center, removing it from where it’s stuck to the shelf with a
“It was.” Clint agrees mournfully. “But she did do it, Steve. It happened. People are going to get mad. People will want revenge. It’s just what happens in this kind of job. There’s a lot of consequences when we get things wrong.”
“It’s working.” Nebula assures him, as she holds to her batons with clenched fists. “Put your helmet on.”
“Did he kill them? His people?” Rogers asks, and his voice cuts through the line of focus Tony had between himself and Bruce like a knife, slicing the fake casing of security so easily Tony struggles not to wince.
“Probably.” Bruce heaves, and it has a hysterical tone to it, a laugh that’s not really a laugh, full of nerves and jitters. “And our initial prospects are not good to begin with.”
He’s using a completely destroyed Captain America suit, dyed darker and torn and ragged, missing the silver star on the chest, no helmet in sight, and seeing it it’s like being punched in the gut.
“Isn’t there a better way to do it, though?” Sam continues, and Steve is thankfully still paying attention this time. “Now that there’s just three of us, maybe we can get away with using with something more… efficient.”
“Cap?” Natasha calls him, when she notices he hasn’t stepped out of the Quinjet. She hasn’t seen it. She didn’t notice it.
Tony’s suggestion is off-handed at most, but Rogers nods like it was a request to be fulfilled, and he assures, “We’ll do it.”
He scoots back, and lays on the pillows, just so he can rest a little, and while he waits, he doesn’t realize he’s falling asleep before it’s too late.
Sudden and broken and – a gleam, a tear, right there, trickling down his fur, and Tony’s own eyes burn and water out of
“I was looking for answers on how to defeat Ultron. Though we defeated him together, you were the only one I saw.”
But what is Tony Stark next to the trillions who have just passed? Who is he, a mere speck of nothingness in the middle of space, empty inside, with no strength and no purpose anymore? He could’ve gone with the others, turned into dust, and what difference would that make? None. Tony might die inside this spaceship, bleeding out slowly, long before they even reach Earth, much less reach
“He died because HYDRA was hiding inside our walls and we didn’t know.” Clint sniffs, but there is no sign of tears in his eyes. There is only a fierce, firm conviction, something Steve knows its unbreakable and impossible to change. “So? How do we know we can trust every guy who puts on a mask and a tight suit and calls himself a hero? That’s right, we
“I did the same thing, you know.” Sam mumbles, like a shameful confession. “When Riley fell. I thought it was my fault. What kind of partner was I, if I let my wingman fall and I couldn’t do a goddamn thing?”
over it. He has no grudge when he speaks of Wanda, even though he has implied that Wanda has somehow messed up badly with his head, and he has no grudge for Tony for Ultron, as he has no grudge for no one, not even for
Tony doesn’t actually need Bruce’s help, but he’ll say he does, if that takes Bruce out of that room for a couple minutes. He doesn’t look close to going green, but if he is going green, Tony would like to avoid it. And maybe more than anyone else in this room, maybe even more than Rhodey, Bruce is neutral ground, he is the only voice Tony will stand to hear with any composure, until the raw, vulnerable feeling sleep left lingering behind, the hold of Pepper’s hand still searing in his own, finally gives a little, and lets him
, he never will be ashamed of protecting people and doing all he can to keep the world safe. It’s not about fame. It’s not about glory, or status, no matter what he made people believe during that terrible year of the Stark Expo, because he just… he was just trying to have some happiness and adrenaline before the Palladium took him out. But it was never about that.
“Thanks anyway, big guy.” Tony awkwardly says, his lips twisting in discomfort. “I’m sorry. For your friend.”
“Knowing what kinds of fun toys Thundercat was using, I don’t doubt it.” Tony extends his hand. “Hand it over.”
“He said his job was done.” He remembers Natasha saying in a hurt whisper, that echoed through the quinjet like a gunshot. “And there was nothing else to say.”
Barton fumbles like he suddenly took a hit to the head, shifting in his feet and mouth opening in shock, no words forthcoming, only a confused mumble and an outraged expression, as if he can’t process the information correctly in his brain. Rogers and Romanov, in turn, immediately stiffen, eyes zeroing on Nebula with uncomfortable precision, the critical stare of a threat assessment, and Tony unthinkingly jumps to her defense, stepping closer to where she’s sitting and fully prepared to step in from of her to make himself a shield if he has to.
He lays down and Bruce sets up the machine, and the cold of the bed against his naked chest makes Tony shiver, the hairs on his forearms standing up with a prickly sensation, his muscles tense. The acute awareness of it is the only thing that stops him from blurting out something he will regret, so he welcomes it, and he lays his head down and breathes in deeply, his thoughts in turmoil, and watching Bruce the only thing he has available to distract him from the temptation of
he could act when those ways and customs showed themselves to be foreign or contradictory to him – but truth is,
“Before we go, I need your help, Brucie.” Tony says, his voice extremely casual, which is good, because as soon as Tony says his name, Bruce damn near startles. “I need you to come with me down to the med bay.”
, but he knows it’s not his place. He has no right. Even if the pain in Tony’s chest seems like it echoes in Barton’s own, Tony cannot move, because what sort comfort can he offer?
He needed to find Bucky, find his best friend, and make sure he was safe. Make sure they were together.
It’s crazy. Crazy to see how many people are so ready to jump the gun and express opinions on their conflict without knowing how terrible the situation they found themselves in was. How many people are condemning them, condemning Tony, with absolutely no idea how hard it was to make a choice. They shouldn’t even have to
He should at least say something, right? He can’t go off like this, without a word, like there was nothing wrong.
no chance of bringing everyone back, and then – Then he’ll join her downstairs, with the SHIELD agents and Ross and Carter, he’ll go on recon and rescue, he’ll rack his brains for the best designs he can possibly produce for survival measure necessary, and he’s gonna put all his back and heart into it, with no questions asked. He’ll do whatever she asks him to, he’ll follow her lead, as he does in SI, as he does outside of the walls of this Compound, when he trusts her to be his CEO, his partner, his friend. His safe place. If there is no other way, he’ll do it.
“No.” They would try to keep him out of harm, in fact, and they would keep him confined in this place for as long as they deemed necessary. And Tony can’t have that. “But I need to be somewhere else. I have to find my friends.”
And Jarvis knows there’s more to it than just what meets the eye. He’s not naïve enough to believe otherwise.
Why wouldn’t he assume that? From the moment they first met they clashed, heavy impact at full speed, destruction and chaos, snarls and stares and a jolt of electricity so strong Steve can still remember how the hairs on his arms stood in shocking goosebumps when Tony took a step closer; Right in his face, his eyes burning in rage and defiance, gleaming like the whiskey he was addicted to.
“What he’s saying,” the raccoon rasps, sauntering forward with faltering strides, like the exhaustion doesn’t allow him to walk in a straight line anymore, as if to put himself between Pepper and Bruce, to make himself the focus and to be heard. “is that saving the people won’t be enough. You can’t just gather everyone who’s left and try to rebuild what you had with half the population. That’s not how it works, because that’s not what’s killing the planet. Before you fix that, you can’t fix anything else, because it won’t stick.”
. No need for this ominous, very threatening, not at all creepy warning and cutting stare, no matter how well-intentioned it might be.
“Play nice.” Tony chastises with no real heat, blinking twice rapidly to dispel the awkward sensation that threatened to creep into his brain. “She’s a friend.”
“She has been gone since after the battle, Bruce.” Natasha says, softly. “There’s nothing we can do. We have to wait for her to come back.”
“Tony?” Rogers says, strong voice cutting deep through Tony’s despair, and Tony raises his eyes to look at him and realizes his vision is blurred, his eyes burning with tears, his entire body shaking and sweating cold, breath stuttering in his throat.
“I know.” Bucky sighs, turning his head to the side, raising his hand to brush his fingertips to the petals of a light pink flower, so small and delicate it could simply disintegrate if touched too harshly. Bucky’s touch is so gentle it barely moves the flower when he brushes against it. “But I get it. Where else would they put us? The bigger the threat, the stronger the cage.”
“Nothing. I’m just… asking.” Bucky says, and they both know it’s not true. “I mean… I’m safe here. I’m not going anywhere. You could… You could go back, and I’d stay here. Maybe you can work something out if I’m not in the way.”
Steve has to hold back a sob, and it gets stuck in his throat painfully, scratching and cutting like he is swallowing down a handful of razorblades. “I was trying to protect him.”
“Would you like to read them, Captain?” T’Challa offers once more, a hint of something gleeful on his voice, so well hidden he can barely see it, though his eyes are shining with a brilliant hope. “I would be glad to provide them to you.”
, he said. He probably believed it, too. For all of Tony’s hopes for a brighter future, despite his borderline naïve desires sometimes, he is a Stark, and Stark men are always taught to see the worst, sometimes even before it arrives.
worry out of the way. “Are you saying that all of the visions Wanda created are destined to become true?”
that blooms in his husband’s face. It’s so deeply entrancing. The Captain, stalking forward like a lion, crawls over Antonio in a graceful move, and places himself between Antonio’s thighs, a place that now belongs to him, and him alone.
“I don’t know.” Bruce flails a little, erratic. “It’s not the same now. I lost time. After he came out to fight Ultron, I never came back. Like I was sleeping. For all I know, I had been Hulk for two years when Thor found me.”
“Because I saw him too.” Thor clarifies. “And yet, I saw none of you. Only Stark. And he was the one to bring Nebula to us.”
, to leave without a single thing, to strip him of whatever he could to make him hurt, seeing as he had failed to take Barnes out of his grasp. It’s
Steve, the one who Tony expected most to take the lead and impose himself on the situation, to come up with some sort of solution the same way he had offered insight on the steel gates mere moments before – just… just stands there, seemingly not fully comprehending what’s going on, passively waiting, not even fully observing the room with his eyes glassy and lost in some distant place as he averts his gaze.
He went to the post office to buy an envelope and mail the check himself. While he was there, he bought stamps with the Calvin and Hobbes characters on them, though he didn’t have anyone to send any letters to. Maybe he just wanted to know he had the option. Maybe he’d write a letter to his friend Rhodey, who’d been gone for six months in the army on a need-to-know mission doing god knows what.
“It’s alright, Tony. This is something I want to do on my own. Money is tight sometimes, but we make it work. I want to be the one to make it work.”
“Hi,” Tony replied, pleased and surprised all at once. Steve hadn’t called, hadn’t even texted. But of course, Steve had known Tony would be home. Steve pretty much knew about all of Tony’s plans nowadays.
It was the tail end of summer, turning quickly into fall, and the park was busier than it had been on Monday. Still, Steve Rogers wasn’t difficult to find. He was seated on one of the benches at the far end of the playground, watching Carter climb the ladder, run across the bridge, and descend the slide over and over and over again.
Tony glanced back out the window, not quite ready to hold Steve’s gaze for so long. “The sunset’s beautiful.”
But Steve was already ripping the check in half. Tony felt like tearing out his hair. He settled for clenching his fists so hard that his nails would leave marks in his palms.
“Well. She was my first official friend.” Tony felt Carter getting heavier in his arms and glanced down to see her eyelids drooping. “Looks like someone’s had a little too much fun today.”
He’d brought the check to give to Steve himself, tucked into a plain envelope with Steve’s name on it. He’d set it down on the table, then stepped out into the entryway to hang up his jacket. When he got back, Steve had already found the letter and picked it up.
“Do you think it’s really possible?” Pepper asks, in a whisper. “To get them back? Bring everyone back?”
“He didn’t.” Wanda says, and her accent sounds stronger when she’s feeling so emotional. “But he said it would be soon.”
Dum-E does find his way back to them, and, shockingly, he has also done exactly what Nebula has asked him to do. He brings Tony a water bottle, taken from the mini-bar, and the bottle is still intact except for a tiny indentation from Dum-E’s a little too tight grip. Tony doesn’t know if the same can be said from the mini-bar – but it probably can’t – but he doesn’t mind. He takes the bottle with a slight, faint smile at the corner of his lips, an emotion frail and humble, something bittersweet; and he says
Tony’s mouth twists in frustration, his head pounding with exhaustion, and yet, he is the one who turns and says:
– their leader, and one of his most praised skills is his strategic proficiency, so his decisions hold much more weight than other members of the team. Tony knows that. Tony has seen it for himself.
“Look, pal, I’m not one to talk about family and stuff like that, I don’t exactly have any memories of what it was like before all…
And it’s guilt and sorrow and affection and grief and everything else, all mixed together into a hurricane of emotions that wrecks chaos in his body, and he can’t sit here and act like he’s noble when the only thing keeping him upright is something so frail, so excruciatingly… so – so
“They did.” FRIDAY adds, and a profile for Erik Selvig is also added to the board in 2012, along with notes for the Chitauri army.
of this bullshit, tired of pretending they can make this work like before, tired of trying to be calm and
But Steve doesn’t actually care enough to do it. Just let it grow out. At least, it’ll improve his disguise.
But Tony hadn’t treated him right. He got the kid into messes he didn’t need to be in, just because Tony couldn’t leave him alone, and he had been aching for an excuse to get in contact with
“Relax.” Clint says – and the drawl of the last vowel, the lazy tilt of his tone, it’s all so familiar that it’s hard to conciliate the idea that Tony hasn’t heard that in so long. “You know I never miss.”
The kid died on the street, and he’s still here. No one could’ve reached him, not even an ambulance.
“So you’re leaving? With us?” Steve asks instead, trying to make it sound a bit like a question, but also as an affirmative, and somehow, he messes it all up and it comes out sounding like a petulant inquiry.
Except for one thing. Bruce immediately opens his mouth, his eyes wide and frantic, but Tony doesn’t let him speak.
“We were trapped on a planet… I don’t know how I got there, or when. Hulk shut me out completely. Where Thor found me, found the Hulk, I hadn’t been awake in years.” Bruce tells them, voice nearly dream-like, as if he can see the events play out right before his eyes as he recalls them. “In that planet, they…
“Ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Holt, Secretary Ross and Judge Talbot are leaving the plenary, after fourteen hours of deliberation - to announce what is the final verdict for Scott Lang, codenamed Ant-Man, who sided with Captain America and the Rogue Avengers in a fight against the Sokovia Accords.”
“He took the Stone and left. Opened a portal and stepped through, just like you said. And then we were up there, trying to get back. That’s when it
Tony lets out a terrible, terrible laugh, scratchy and sour, that hurts his chest as it comes out. “Oh,
But he doesn’t stop. Whatever it is about Nebula that made him hesitate – and it could be a whole lot –, Bruce shrugs it off almost immediately and keeps walking, stepping heavily on the ground when he gets out, as if he can finally trust what’s beneath him with his weight, and he all but jogs in Tony’s direction just as Rhodey did, hard, deep lines of worry etched on his face, jittery anxiety so clear it ages him years and years with just the creases on his forehead.
anything if he keeps undoing all of our attacks. Either we keep him busy so he can’t use it, or we get it from him before he even gets the chance.”
She sweeps her gaze through all of their faces, but when her eyes land on Steve, her words are clipped and tense, heavy with unhappiness.
He sits, on top of his worktable, next to the mockup of the Gauntlet that still makes his skin crawl with the too uncanny similarities, the lingering feeling of the scorching hot brand of despair and fear carved into him on the sandy ruins of Titan, and –
(Oh, sorry. I guess not everyone gets a free pass on being irrational once in a while, isn’t that right?)
“You know, I—” Tony shrugs, full of fake nonchalance. “Postponing the wedding would be easier than… Than – cancelling it.”
“He wouldn’t.” Nebula says. “His planet rejected him and his message when he warned them hunger would consume them. They cast him out when he suggested they should kill half the population to save themselves.”
