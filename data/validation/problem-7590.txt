Leader leed
“And don’t even think about asking Harley to bring you. That’ll just end up with you in trouble.”
Peter let out a shuddery breath once he was done his bottle. Mama hadn’t left him. He wasn’t alone because he was big. He didn’t like being alone. He looked up at Mama, his bottom lip poking out. Mama made the same face back at him causing Peter to giggle. His Mama was really silly.
“His plane has just landed, we have a bit of time before we have to meet him, we have to hurry though!” Peter wiped the sleep from his eyes and hopped out of the car, taking his Dad’s hand so they could rush to the gate to get Harley. He just hoped none of the press was there.
At Peter’s nod, Bucky happily took the bottle, gripping it with two hands and tilting his head back to drink. It was delicious! Papa was right. It was way better than pancakes. Although Peter looked to be really enjoying them.
“Thanks, Buck. Tony will be starving I’m sure.” He commented flexing his hips to set him off again. Tony whined but pushed back at the same time, willing to take more, causing Steve to grin. Training such a responsive Omega was going to be a lot of fun.
“Room- Peter- What?!” Tony exclaimed, he couldn’t keep track of their conversation. No way was his little Peter seeing him like this. He was the purest and most innocent omega he has ever seen. Way too innocent for seeing his Dad in ways no kids want to see them.
Peter grinned, this was going to be awesome.
“Clint,” Bucky warned when he felt him tense up as Bruce approached. Clint couldn’t help it though. He really hated his blood being taken. After a few seconds of Clint staying tense Bucky sighed and moved his hand from his stomach to his cock, wrapping his fingers around it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He exchanged glances with Steve, knowing it was Peter that was awake and not happy.
“Okay. Let’s go have some food. I’m sure Harley and Mama are already there.” Steve said standing Peter up before hopping up himself. He was watching Peter closely enough to see him stiffen.
“What’s wrong baby? Why are you so sad?” Sure, it seemed like a stupid question but if there was one thing Tony knew about his kid was that Peter liked to vocalise what was wrong with him, he just needed prompting sometimes.
“Yes. We’re going and that’s it.” Steve’s tone was final but that didn’t stop Tony from shaking his head.
Steve sighed, his worry wrinkle on full display. "I don't know. When he first woke up I noticed right away that his grip seemed pretty strong, and it seems like his hearing is a bit more sensitive too." He dropped his head, letting out a heavy sigh. "I know your father said that he wasn't going to turn Peter into a super-soldier, but I'm starting to wonder if he did anyway. Maybe not quite to my extent, but… if he's still growing, Tony, then—"
"Not yet, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said quickly. He shot Peter a conflicted look before returning his gaze to the chessboard. "Colonel Rhodes is heading back up to the base to see what's going on now, so hopefully we'll hear something soon."
Sniffing, Tony glanced up at the clock. It was already 2030, only thirty minutes before Steve was due to pick him up, which meant he had just enough time to call Peter before he went to sleep for the night.
As soon as he heard Steve brushing his teeth, Tony crawled into bed, groaning as various joints cracked and popped as he attempted to relax into the mattress. Back when he and Steve first started sharing a bed, Steve would often rub Tony's shoulders for him at night, massaging away the tightness from a day of working in the lab or dealing with the Stark Industries Board of Directors. Afterwards, as long as Tony was still conscious, he would return the favour, kneading his knuckles into the solid muscles of Steve's shoulders and back and chuckling at all the silly noises that Steve made.
"What
"Cap, Nat's right," added Clint. "Let's at least let her try."
"Oh boy," muttered Tony. "Not exactly sure I'm up for watching that."
Her announcement was followed by a series of thundering footsteps, clomping down the wooden stairs like a stampede of wild animals. Gwen quickly closed her laptop and got to her feet, grabbing Peter's wrist and jerking her head down a short hallway off to the left.
"Uh huh." Peter turned to face the screen as the lights grew dim and the trailers began, forcing all of his churning thoughts to the back of his mind.
A moment of eerie silence fell across the panic room, with everyone holding their collective breaths.
"Peter, I really don't think that's—" Papa started, just as the alien's hammer closed around Peter's body. Grimacing, Peter wiggled his arms down to his sides and pushed outwards, breaking the hammer's hold just in time to web onto half of a taxicab and send it hurtling down on top of the alien.
"What the hell does that mean?" Tony snapped, swearing as the Hammer suit tailing him fired a compact missile, impacting it between his shoulder blades and briefly knocking him off course. "What do you mean you can't get in?"
"I'll stick close to him, hon," Tony murmured. "He—he'll be okay."
Natasha lets out a sigh.  “Not ready?  Or not willing?”
"'Night, Uncle Thor," Peter said, grimacing as Thor clapped him on the shoulder, still munching on what remained of his taco.
"Yes, sir," he finally said. He gently squeezed Tony's hand. "It is understood, sir."
"Are you all right, Master Peter?" asked JARVIS. "Shall I summon Mr Wilson or Agent Romanoff?"
“I have to keep being the favourite some way. It just so happens this is an easy way. C’mere champ. I have a few things for you.” He ignored the pointed look that Steve sent him and opened his arms to let Peter jump into them.
They both knew he was little for a while now and were treating him as such when he allowed it, mostly when he was tired, and usually he only let Tony coddle him, always claiming it was his ‘Mama instincts’, with Steve he’d glare and move away from him if he tried which frustrated Steve to no end but made Tony laugh.
Finally, Natasha smirked, “Good staredown kid. The cute factor does it for you. Here I got this for you when I was visiting Ireland a few weeks ago.” She threw four different types of chocolate bars into his bucket and Peter gasped when he saw what they were. Dairy milk had to be the best chocolate in the world and she got him four! The plain chocolate, mint crisp, golden crisp and Turkish delight.
hurt. He clutched the top of his head trying to stop the tears from coming. He wasn’t even sure why he
Peter fist-pumped the air when he saw what his Dad was handing back to him. Yes! He loved apples and peanut butter! Harley needed to come over more often, he was getting all of his favourite things today!
“Baby, we didn’t hear you was all. We didn’t mean to ignore you. I’m really sorry you felt ignored though. Can you forgive me?”
Steve adding his mark to Peter would send out the signal to everyone that Peter had double the protection, not that Tony’s scent wasn’t protection enough. Tony was still Iron-Man and famous. His scent attached to Peter had already done its job. Adding Steve’s would just solidify any of the truly idiotic Alpha’s that thought they could take on Iron-Man’s pup.
Tony rolled his eyes at his new Alpha’s logic. “I’m sure we’ll be able to make it back to our area before that.”
“Wait, Harley is coming?!” He asked excitedly, he loved when Harley came over.
Natasha took a sniff of the air and made eye contact with Bucky, nodding her head. Clint was oblivious to a lesser Alpha and the smell not being strong enough yet. Bucky jerked his head to Natasha so that she would get Steve and quick, Tony would be getting desperate soon.
Bucky just huffed a laugh in response. “Sorry darlin’ but if you want some sweets later you need to be well rested.” He said, throwing himself onto Peter’s king size bed. “Thanks for giving me an excuse to get out of the most boring meeting in history though.”
After Bucky basically broke down Peter was taken out of his nursery and brought back into the living room where the rest of the Avengers were still lounging.
“I know you don’t want him to have a Twitter, either do I, but we need to let him have some freedom; otherwise, he’ll grow to resent us and that’s the last thing I want. Especially since he’s signed up for college classes next term.”
Bucky laughed again, “I’ll let them know. It’s about time someone didn’t let you away with anything. The Captain America title will get you nowhere with Tony. You give him hell doll, it’s the least he deserves.”
Clint blushed and nodded his head, glad he was going back over Bucky’s need and didn’t have to look at Bruce any longer.
me! Because I asked nicely if I could wear clothes.” He pouted up Bucky, looking for sympathy.
Tony knew Peter loved Harley. Loved having him around. Peter had never given any inclination that he didn’t. Now Tony had to wonder if every time Harley came around he was jealous, not because Harley was bigger than him, but because he felt like Harley would come one day and just take Tony away from him. His poor baby was living with that fear every time he saw Harley. It was no wonder he asked Tony to sleep with him every night. Now he didn’t even want to see him. By the look on Harley’s face, he felt just as bad as Tony did. Both of them looked up when they heard Steve’s footsteps.
“Now want to explain to me why you’re trying to pass as a lesser Alpha?”
“We’ll have to be quick. Peter’s room is a bit away but he could be back any minute. I need to take the edge off. Don’t come.” Steve punctuated each word with a thrust. He quickly realised that Tony riding him wasn’t going to get him to come quickly. He gave his ass a smack and pulled Tony off of him, directing him over the arm of the couch. He wasted no time fucking back into him. Using him hard and quick, pulling him back to meet his thrusts, the wet slap of skin on skin furthering his arousal. He brought one hand down to hold onto Tony’s cock, murmuring his approval as he swirled his thumb in the slit, smiling when he heard Tony’s whine.
“What’cha get me, uncle Bucky?” He asked, searching his pockets, making Bucky laugh as he hit tickly spots on him.
Peter hopped out of the car and took the hand his Dad held out to his begrudgingly, not saying anything while Harley and his Dad talked about their plans for the weekend, again not asking Peter his opinion at all. Peter supposed it didn’t matter because obviously they didn’t want him there either way. He stayed quiet the whole way up to their floor, not seeing Tony and Harley’s glances at him or the quiet conversation they had over his head.
“Now or never Tones.” Steve grabbed his hips as he pounded into him, and Tony could feel the come coating his insides. It was enough to send him into his own orgasm, a big enough one that it left him shaking afterwards. He felt Steve’s knot tying them together once more and sighed, he was never getting to his lab.
Was he still getting a cookie?
Everyone looked to it to see who it was as it was the first exciting thing to happen in the last 20 minutes.
“No. You can do it the old fashioned way and get the followers before you get that little blue tick. And I think Papa will mind but I’m after putting as much protection as I can into it so it won’t be too bad.”
"Oh no, you'd just do it on accident because you were too drunk to see straight, isn't that right?" Tony said. "Nothing's ever your fault, is it? Always blaming everyone else for everything that goes wrong because you can never own up to the fact that you're the failure! It was
"Yeah, and in another week I'll finally be able to join you again," Papa said eagerly.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"Remind you about the giant-wannabe thing," stated JARVIS. "It has been duly noted, sir."
"Yes, Captain," answered JARVIS. "How may I be of service?"
And once all that was done, all that would be left for Steve to do would be to activate it, and almost thirty years of harsh military rule would finally be at an end.
"Carol would do it too, Tony, you know she would," Steve said. "She's told us some stuff, about what happened after Colonel Rhodes' accident, and… well… let's just say that I know she would do it."
Or, in this case, after watching one of his best friends get killed by Thanos, along with his brother. Steve had once thought it impossible that he could ever feel any sympathy for Loki after what he'd done during the Battle of New York, but from what Bruce had described, both his and Thor's ends had been brutal.
Tony was quiet for a moment, his body relaxed against Steve's. "No need to be sorry, honey," he finally whispered. "To be honest, I get more appreciation from the team—and you especially—than I ever did from Howard. With him, everything I did was always just kinda… expected."
Peter, who deserved everything that was good and decent in the world, and yet somehow wound up with Tony as his father.  For thirteen years, Tony had thrown himself into being the best father he could be, all while trying to keep up the appearances of the flippant playboy that Obie seemed to feel was necessary for his image.
"I'm not quite sure that I understand the question?"
"I agree, little guy," Steve said, tossing him a brief smile. "Sam, we're supposed to touch down over there, by the main palace building."
"Yeah, they weren't bad. Not quite up to Times Square's standards, but I'll take this over the stupid touristy crowds anytime."
Steve let out a frustrated noise as he glanced over at Peter. He knew that Dr Cho had warned him it could be days before Peter woke up, but the thought of leaving him made Steve's heart feel as heavy as a lead balloon. The chance—albeit small—that Peter would wake up and find himself alone was almost too much for Steve to bear at the moment.
"Yeah, I know." Pushing himself up, Peter practically fell into his papa's open arms, squeezing his eyes closed as Papa's strong, steady heartbeat filled his ears. "I'm just… I don't know, I think I'm just—"
"Honey, are you seriously trying to tell me that that kid's been calling you Papa for the last couple weeks or so, and you've been confused as to why?" asked Tony. "Steve, come on! It can't be that big of a shock to you."
Steve glanced up at Tony, quirking an eyebrow in question that Tony almost completely missed because he was too busy staring in awe at his drop-dead gorgeous husband. With his sun-bleached blond hair, broad shoulders, strong arms, and ever-so-slightly tanned skin that was currently sprinkled with water droplets from the lake, Steve was every bit the living, breathing image of the most erotic human Tony could ever conjure up in his mind or anywhere else.
"Barnes here."
“I hope so,” Steve said softly, clearing his throat as he handed Peter his shopping bag, along with a flyer advertising the store.  “And if you wouldn’t mind telling your friends about this place, I’d appreciate it.”
Warmth burst across Steve's chest, and he slipped his fingertips underneath Tony's shirt, craving the feel of his skin against his.
The girl startled, almost as if she wasn't used to being addressed in such a manner. She took a single step forward, biting her lip.
"I do believe so, sir."
Papa's haunted blue eyes stared up at Peter for several heartbeats as he tried to swallow, no doubt trying to reconcile the garbage HYDRA had been feeding him all this time with the reality that Peter was there, right in front of him.
Setting his water glass down, Steve padded out into the hallway and towards Peter's room. While JARVIS had said that he was doing fine and Steve had no reason to believe the UI wasn't telling the truth, he still preferred to see for himself. With so much uncertainty surrounding them—gods, aliens, other dimensions, Peter's health, and Tony's ongoing obsession with hunting down and destroying the Ten Rings—Steve felt he could never be too careful when it came to either of them.
"Sometimes resting can be just as important as sleeping, mo grá," Steve murmured as he trailed the pad of his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "And sometimes rest can even lead to sleep, if you allow it."
Peter shifted on his squashy couch along the side of the jet, rubbing at his scratchy eyes as he tried to keep from yawning. He'd called Ned so he could help distract him from his father's latest freak-out, and it had worked for a little while. But the last ten minutes or so had turned into nothing but a whine-fest, and Peter was rapidly getting over it.
“Because unless I am working with incomplete information, no military branch of the United States currently has any official business in Sokovia,” said JARVIS.  “Which means that—”
Next week’s chapter will post on Wednesday, November 25th, as both this week and next week are going to be extra busy at my house.
But he
"No, I will not," Howard said firmly, his eyes narrowing into a fierce glare. "As you may know, my young son is still trying to recover from nearly dying during his surgery on that fateful day, so I do not believe it would be in his best interests for me to leave the house at the moment."
"He was," Steve replied. "And as far as I know, he didn't even realise that he'd been snapped. None of the people who were in Wakanda seemed to notice that anything was different."
"Half that time," Phillips cut in. "Yeah I get it." The colonel leaned back in his chair, letting out a heavy sigh. "I'm sorry, Tony, but unless something weird happens that's the best we're gonna be able to do. General O'Brien was adamant that we only convert three of the aircraft over to the vibranium cores, so…"
"We are approaching the mark for initial satellite deployment in ten seconds, Captain," JARVIS said.
"Okay, so she's probably not one of them," Steve murmured as he wrote down the lady's name and what state she represented in his notebook. He had already been watching the debate for over three hours, pretty much ever since he and Tony had dropped Peter off at school, taking detailed notes as he tried to determine exactly how many of the senators were hooked in with HYDRA and who they all were.
Steve's throat bobbed as he swallowed. "Yes, please," he whispered. "It—it itches."
"He took two of our guys with him," said Green Lady.
"I'll find a nice spot on the low ground," Bucky said, his expression so similar to how he had been during the war that Steve nearly did a double-take. "And I'll take 'em out, one by one."
wanted to kiss her.
"Goodnight to you, Master Peter."
But, since Papa and Dad still refused to let him start training with the team again, the arm-wrestling and his sparring sessions with Uncle Thor were all that he had.
"Yeah, you are," Peter interrupted. "And that doesn't make any sense at all, Dad. Like,
Tony thought fiercely as he grabbed one of Steve’s zip-up sweatshirts and headed for the elevator.
Tony nodded, sniffing. "Yeah."
His entire life will be nothing more than a zero sum.
And then, all Tony would be able to do would be to step back and let the chips fall, hoping like hell that they fell the right way.
But Steve didn't enjoy thinking about his recovery, so he always just changed the subject, something he knew hadn't escaped Tony's notice. He didn't like remembering the weeks that he spent in captivity with a busted-up foot that still ached whenever it rained, being drugged into believing that he was fighting against his own husband.
"No!" Tony cut in, shaking his head. He looked towards their bedroom door, calling Peter's name. "Pete! Oh God, Pete, are you okay? Pete—!"
"I see," the HYDRA agent said. "Well, then I guess we still have some more work to do." He nodded towards the young woman, who's name Steve couldn't seem to remember at the moment. "My dear, if you don't mind?"
Tony’s lips twitched as he tried to hide his grimace.  Despite his reputation, he didn't really enjoy meeting new people.  People couldn't help but size him up as soon as they learned his name, and after a lifetime of it, Tony was beyond over it.
“Look, honey, all I’m saying is that I could be out there in only a few hours,” Tony said to the phone screen clutched in his hand.  “Then you'd at least have some decent company on this goddamn wild-goose chase Fury’s sending you on.  And with no backup, by the way.”
And then, if that hadn't been enough, having to watch Tony fall from the sky right afterwards. Being chased back through the closing portal by the rapidly expanding fireball, his limp body twisting and turning in the air as he fell, all while Steve watched helplessly from the ground below.
"Everything okay?" she asked once he was settled, his blankets pulled up to his chest. He had noticed that he'd been feeling even colder lately, corroborated by one of the doctors earlier who had increased the amount of the oxygen flowing into his nose.
“Sounds good.  Thanks.”
"Well… I guess—I guess you can't," Howard finally said with a shrug. "I guess you're just gonna have to trust me."
"Mr Stark," Dr Strange said with a sigh. "As I'm sure you are already aware, I would not have been able to help your son anyway, so this is really a moot point. However, this impending crisis with the stones is not, and therefore absolutely must take precedence at the moment."
"Something amusing, Mr Stark?" Phillips asked once everyone had left the room.
"Sure thing," Sam said with a nod. "See ya later."
Steve had thought that he'd discovered the limit to his panicking ability when he saw Peter fall into the fire pit at the HYDRA bunker, but even that didn't compare to the horror he felt when he saw Peter disappear under the water. The thought of his beloved son frozen in ice, drowning, and knowing exactly what it felt like… how terrifying it was…
They had theories, of course. Bruce, Natasha, Clint, and Bucky had been working almost nonstop in Tony's lab ever since they brought Peter back to the Tower, trying to discover the identity of the mystery assailant and who might've programmed him to attack Peter. They were hypothesizing that whoever it was had ties to either the Mongolian HYDRA base or to the group of thugs trying to steal from Damage Control, with Steve going even further and suggesting that the two were somehow linked.
“Is this a rhetorical question, sir?” asked JARVIS.  “Or would you appreciate an actual response?”
"Hey, Dad!" Peter called as Dad finally landed a shot right below the Hammer suit's neck, sending it crashing towards the floor.
Steve knew about JARVIS, but he didn't know what Project Phoenix was yet.
"Yeah, that's more like it," grumbled Tony. As much as he appreciated Bruce and the work that he did, there were occasions where he tended to get ahead of himself, and at the moment Tony had absolutely no patience for it.
“Uh huh,” Peter said eagerly as he headed towards the back.  “I can’t wait to go ice skating tomorrow!”
"You are?" Peter exclaimed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. "I mean, not that that's bad or anything. It's actually pretty awesome when you think about it, and—"
Peter was instantly suspicious. He knew Mama said underwear but he definitely didn’t mean it in the way Peter did. “Diaper?” He asked, wanting to cut all the bullcrap.
“Pancakes?” Bucky asked if Peter was having pancakes, so was he!
“Oh look, there are some photos of us at the airport.” Harley burst out laughing as he scrolled through the photos people took. There was one of Peter staring at the camera with his arms crossed over his chest, sticking his tongue out while Tony and Harley hugged.
Steve noticed he didn’t say anything to deny it though.
“Pete, I need you to put a pair of shorts on and nothing else, then come back out and we’ll watch some Star Wars okay?”
“Ah, I get you. I’ll just pop that in the note to the examiner. I’ll buzz you into the waiting room, there are refreshments in there for you and the little ones along with a play area. I’ll need one of you to fill out this form for James and give it to the examiner when you go in to see her.
“Of course I love Harley. Our relationship is just a small bit different than mine and yours. That’s not a bad thing. Think of it this way. Harley is more like one of the adults than one of the kids. So even though he plays with you and watches movies with you he’s still an adult and he’s treated like one. You’re a kid and will be treated like one. There’s no need to compete for my time Pete because I’m always 100% focussed on you, even when I’m talking to someone else.”
“Go to your Mama, please. Tell him what you did. I have to wash your brother.” Peter’s face fell. He wasn’t allowed to stay with Dada and Jamie, even though Jamie was sick?
“Anyway, the entity said to us that with the destruction of the stone the earth would return back to before Thanos but it wouldn’t be without its own consequences. Obviously, we asked what they would be. More out of curiosity than anything else because we were always going to take the option where everyone gets to live no matter the consequences.” He rushed to reassure when Peter looked at him with a pout. “She told us that while she didn’t agree with Thanos’s method she did agree that a lot of the universe was in disarray and something needed to be done about it. While this didn’t help with the supposed overpopulation it did bring in a system that worked and made the order a common thing. The way the entity explained it was that everyone has a secondary personality in them, which in what we refer to now as the WBT or the world before Thanos, that comes out as personality traits that make up the whole person. So for example in the WBT, we’ve come to the conclusion that no matter how strange of a way I showed it, I was always taking care of people. Building the compound, fixing armour and making new ones, keeping certain baby spiders safe.” He tickled Peter slightly who giggled at the fingers dancing across his ribcage.
“I’m waiting for you! I’ve to scent you so my smell would be more prominent.” He played it off. Not wanting Peter to know that had happened not ten minutes ago.
Steve looked down at his son, who was so clearly trying to be convincing even though his argument was extremely flawed.
Harley shrugged. “I cancelled on them. I’m extended my trip to a week instead of the weekend so I’ll go see them when you’re in school. I’d rather hang out with you.”
Tony threw his head back and laughed, he couldn’t wait to tell Steve this. Their sweet innocent Peter was already getting the best of the paps. It was a proud moment for him.
“So what? I can’t go back to work?” Tony didn’t think he could do that. “Steve, I’d go crazy within a day. You have to let me into my lab. Please.” He nearly choked on the word but the thoughts of staying out of his lab for another week sent a bolt of fear through him. Steve hushed him and was quick to reassure him.
"No, I haven't seen him yet," Peter said with a shrug. "Usually he's been in here for coffee at least once already, but JARVIS said he was still sleeping a few minutes ago."
"Exactly," said Tony. "But here's the kicker. In order to keep the Meridians from trying to sabotage the system—which, once they find out that we even have this device in the first place they're gonna be
"No, no, don't you be trying to give me any of that bullshit, Steven, you know you're a goddamn terrible liar!" barked Phillips. "How many times have I had to tell you that?"
Peter was still grinning as he hung up the phone, placing it on his bedside table for Ms Sharon to pick up later. Then he shook his head, wiping the happy tears from his eyes as he tried to calculate the actual odds of Steve and his father getting together.
" said Cindy. "And his hair, and that accent? Who could resist an accent like that!"
"Pardon me, sir, but Chief and Miss Stacy are down in the Tower lobby and are requesting access to the penthouse."
"Uh huh," Peter said as Tony gathered him close, all shaking limbs and chattering teeth. Peter's hands scrabbled at Tony's arms, gripping handfuls of his shirt just like he always did when he was a baby as Bucky draped a blanket across his shoulders.
that he either couldn't understand or didn't care about what the adults were saying at any given time. The fact that he'd been out of school for so long only added to that stereotype, which meant that Peter had overheard people talking about a lot of things that he really had no business listening to.
Lifting his head, Steve glanced around the jet. The twins were sitting with Natasha and Clint on two of the middle benches, their heads tucked together as they softly talked, while Sam and James were manning the cockpit, each taking two hour shifts on the controls to help ensure they would both be as fresh as possible once they landed in Wakanda.
"Very good, sir," JARVIS said. "And Dr Banner reports that he and Dr Cho are about five minutes out. They are planning on transporting Captain Rogers to an Atlanta hospital once he is stabilised. Dr Cho has requested that an entire section be cordoned off for his care."
allow any of those soldiers to leave with that biological, is that understood?"
Tony shrugged. "Can't hurt for recruitment if the aircraft are actually enjoyable, can it?"
“I am unsure, Master Peter,” answered JARVIS.  “Based on what that document seems to be implying, it appears that a secret fringe division of Stark Industries was responsible for the creation of bullets that explode just after impact.”
"Um, I hate to rush you, Cap," Sam said once they'd all ordered. "But we probably should start talking before these guys have too many beers."
Tony grinned, sending a burst of warmth across Steve’s chest as he squeezed their intertwined fingers.  “We shall.”
"Yeah, that's it," Tony rushed out. He scrubbed his palm down his face and sat back up, turning back to face Peter. "You hear that, Pete? Papa's never gonna leave us, so we're gonna be just fine."
Not surprisingly, the following day seemed to fly by in only a matter of minutes, to the point where Tony could hardly believe it as he and Steve pulled into Sarah's driveway to say goodnight to Peter. He had been working frantically all day long, uploading the latest version of JARVIS into Steve and Carol's X-302s and double-checking everything from the satellite mounting brackets to the mechanism he'd derived for Steve to deploy the tesseract. Since he couldn't just mount the tesseract on the outside of the aircraft, Tony had to come up with a way for it to be stored inside the aircraft itself. Thankfully, when he had designed the X-302s he'd left a mechanism in place from earlier aircraft that could essentially function as a type of bomb bay door, and while Carol's was sealed shut since the X-302s didn't require such a mechanism, the door on the underside of Steve's aircraft was now functional, allowing him to deploy the tesseract once all of the satellites were in place.
"Dad said there's no way to determine what it means until we're able to meet with a representative of the Wakandan government," Papa cut in. "We've got Director Fury trying to open a diplomatic dialogue now, but there's so many government loopholes he's gotta jump through first, and—"
"Well, nothing like reliving your own past while trying to inspire your future, yeah?" Tony said, tilting his head. "But—"
"What the hell?" he yelled as he took off running towards the bank, slipping and sliding across the ice as he tried to stay ahead of the crack, which, in his increasing panic, almost seemed like it was following him.
And even now, after all the time that had passed, Steve could still hear the echo of Tony's panicked cries in his mind as he attempted to get Peter to take a breath, terrified that he was going to lose the son that he loved more than anything. Tony had later told Steve flat-out that if Peter had died there in that endless sea of sand, he would've refused to go back with them. He would've blamed himself for Peter's death, and all of his will to live would've vanished.
"Phillips knows how I feel about you, Tony," Steve stated. "I told him."
Tony let out a soft chuckle, his beautiful brown eyes crinkling as he grinned. "Damn right, baby. I am your husband." He closed his eyes, burrowing further into Steve's embrace.
"Honey, you don't have to—"
"Shh, Gwen, it's okay," Steve whispered, handing the distraught girl a tissue. His own stomach was in knots having to listen to her describe Peter's thought process for leaving the bus, but he couldn't tell her to stop when she obviously needed to work through it. "None of this is your fault."
"Yeah, he told me," Peter said rapidly. "So… what did you guys find? Did it really come from space?"
the searing heat from it.
"What usual standards?" he heard Tony mutter.
"It's kind of a long story, little guy, and I'm not sure Thor's up to telling it again just now," Papa said gently as Peter sat down next to him. He curled an arm around Peter's shoulders, kissing the top of his head. "Just suffice it to say that he's going to be staying here on Earth for the foreseeable future."
“There is nothing paranoid about me caring for your safety, child!” Dad snapped.  “As much as it may surprise you, there are plenty of people out there who would just love to get their grimy hands on you, and I can’t take the chance that someone’ll—”
"I'm not dating him, Bucky," Steve said quickly.
Steve begged, his blue eyes glassy with unshed tears. "Please, I'm begging you, just give me one minute to explain. If you still want to leave after that I'll understand, but please, just let me tell you the truth. Please?"
One thing at a time.
in his nightmares, this time it had been different.
"Well, anyway," Steve said, clearing his throat. "Give me five minutes to get changed and then we'll go. Okay, little guy?"
"Well, that's not too surprising," Steve muttered. "He got his homework done though, didn't he?"
"But there's no goddamn way that I'm okay with just sitting here and waiting for Pete to show up on the camera feed either," Tony added. "So now that we have this location, we should—"
Shrugging, Peter moved his knight, splitting two of Uncle Bucky's pawns. "It's okay. Girls are… complicated. Way too hard for me to figure out."
"Yeah," Peter said. He curled his arms around her waist, ducking his head so he could kiss her. With him up at the Compound every weekend, they didn't get very many opportunities to do things together outside of school, and he had been looking forward to this evening for the entire day, in spite of the reasons for it.
"Hey now!" protested Bucky. "Whose side are you on here?"
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop at the mention of the bunker, and he swallowed hard, prompting Tony to grab his hand.
And Steve intended to keep it that way.
Those three years also saw the transformation of the entire Langaran society from a civilian-led republic with a strong military component to a full-on military dictatorship. Peter supposed that they had initially meant well, trying to maintain order during the panic that followed the country-wide loss of electrical power. But it had been twenty-eight years since the Battle of the Continents. It was far past the time for the military to start loosening its iron grip on the nation and allow it to rise up again.
"Yes," Peter rasped as he gratefully stepped into Dad's hug, tipping his forehead against his shoulder as Dad rubbed his palms up and down Peter's back, trying to warm him. Tears welled in Peter's eyes as he sensed the guilt radiating from his father in waves, even though, as usual, he had absolutely nothing to feel guilty for.
As Dad and Papa loved to joke, apparently Peter's appetite was trying to make up for a lot of lost time. Peter had always been able to eat a ton, or at least he had before his bum heart made him almost too weak to eat. But ever since he woke up in that metal tube down in the basement lab at the hospital, his appetite had been about a thousand times bigger than usual.
He technically can’t forget anything, but it would still be nice to pretend.  Even if it’s only for an hour or so a day.
Steve and Sam were just finishing up their session when Tony stepped into the penthouse, Steve's worry wrinkle taking hold the second he glanced in Tony's direction.
"I see it!" responded Steve. "Eyes up, everyone!"
"Yeah," Peter agreed. "But the big question is, how many of him are there?"
, Steve, and you're not supposed to be walking on those burned feet of yours anyway," Tony snapped, his shoulders sagging as soon as the words left his mouth. "Babe, I'm sorry. I'm just… tired."
Peter shook his head as he grabbed onto Steve's shoulder, sliding slowly onto the bed. "No, he wasn't able to get away yesterday. But when he called me he said that his boss told him he'd make sure to get him out in time tonight."
"No, no, I don't think you're joking," said Steve. "I'm just really glad I wasn't one of those people."
"Yes, I goddamn
But that was
"Okay, good." That probably meant that Peter hadn't heard about what happened yet. "Get Pepper, Rhodey, and Sam on the line, will ya? I need to talk to them."
there's no way in hell I can say no to that," Tony managed once he regained the ability to speak. A low growl escaped from his throat as he cupped Steve's face, capturing his lips in a bruising kiss before reaching down to the floor for the bottle of lube. With shaking hands he slicked up two of his fingers, plunging them into himself as Steve curled his hand around Tony's cock, causing him to cry out.
Peter nodded against Papa's chest. "And you've gotta stay that way, okay? Promise?"
They were almost there. Only a few more seconds…
"Just three," answered Tony, his fingertips digging into Steve's flesh. "Honey—"
As soon as he heard his dads' footsteps disappear down the hallway, Peter grabbed for his phone, typing out a quick text to Gwen that they had said yes to the dance and that he would talk to her more about it tomorrow. He smiled when he got a response barely three seconds later; she'd apparently been waiting to hear from him.
But since he’d actually dozed off in the shower more than a few times recently, he forced himself to resist the temptation.  Maybe he could close his office door and catch a catnap after he showed Obie the simulation results.
him? You told
"No no, that's not what Phillips meant," Uncle James said. He let out a heavy sigh as he looked at Papa. "In fact, I'm supposed to relay a message to you, Captain. Three days from now, before you'll be cleared to return to active duty, you have a meeting scheduled with General O'Brien at 0800 hours."
By the time the two engineers had returned to the Compound, the pager's battery was dead, leaving no easy way to trace the signal it had been transmitting. After several hours of tinkering, Bruce and James were able to identify the frequency of the transmission but not the strength, which meant that if Fury had originally meant it to transmit out into space, they had no way of knowing how far or in which direction.
“Then we’ll do that together too.”
As soon as they exited Peter's room, Steve took Tony's hand, trying to guide him back down the hall to their bedroom.
"I'm sorry, sir, but Air Corps regulations prohibit me from discussing my personal life while on duty," he stated. "And since I have been cleared by the base's medical office and am now officially back on duty, I am therefore unable to provide an answer to that question without being in violation of Air Corps protocols. Sir."
Tony thought.
It was all just a bit discombobulating.
"And I should probably tell you about the mission, since—"
"Yes, it would," answered Steve. "Thank you."
"It looks like home!" Peter exclaimed, nearly knocking Steve onto his ass in his haste to scramble out of the car, his brown eyes wide with awe and wonder as they took everything in. "Papa, it's
"I love you, Tony," he whispered, leaning over to capture Tony's lips in a hard kiss. Then he lined himself up and began pushing inside him, careful to take it slow despite Tony trying to hurry him. Once he was fully sheathed he paused for a moment, his eyes squeezing closed as he sucked in a few deep breaths, taking in the incredible sight, smell and feel of his husband's—his
"Of course I am, Senator, since he was my husband's closest childhood friend," Tony said. "Unfortunately, Barnes was presumed killed in action during World War II while attempting to capture a high-ranking HYDRA official, so I'm not exactly sure why bringing up his name is necessary here, unless of course it is your intention to cause my husband unnecessary pain by reminding him that he was forced to watch his best friend fall to his death."
Steve gave a single nod, his fingers twitching slightly in Tony's as they rubbed up against the cool metal of his engagement ring.
just a little bit louder it’ll help keep his pre-race jitters to a dull roar.
But what had started out as an offshoot group of some especially messed-up Nazi scientists had sprouted over the decades into such a massive and overbearing organisation, with tentacles extending into nearly every single aspect of military and civilian government and intelligence communities that at the moment it seemed that rooting out every last one of its members would be impossible. Especially when they were so damn good at hiding their tracks.
Steve nodded against Tony's shoulder. "Yes. Especially today." He pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek. "Ready to get some sleep now?"
"Нет," Winter Soldier said, so softly that Tony at first thought he had only imagined it. The colonel started, obviously shocked at hearing anything other than what he had expected.
And he knew it was even worse for Tony. While Steve had no memories of Peter from when he was well, he knew that Tony's vast memories of him as a happy little boy running around outside and climbing trees haunted him as they watched Peter grow weaker and weaker.
Tony breathed in, his fingers curling around Steve’s dog tags through his shirt.  “Copy that.  I’ll keep ya in the loop.”
The smile dropped from Dad's face like a rock. "Not if I can help it, Pete. Not like I need his permission for anything."
"There's a bit more to it than that, but you've got the basic gist of it."
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a pause as everyone took a collective breath, with Gwen finally breaking the silence by clearing her throat.
Tony held onto the steering wheel like he was afraid it was going to disappear as he pulled into the parking lot of Peter’s school.  He had spent the entire day yesterday going over everything he and Peter were able to find regarding the production and shipping for the exploding bullets and the rifles, matching up shipment manifests and obtaining security footage from the warehouse to corroborate their theory that Obie was colluding with Justin Hammer’s company to supply insurgents in Sokovia with weapons.
Tony forced a smile. "Ah, you know me. I'm always one for a good party."
There have been plenty of gold medals won over the years because one swimmer out-touched a competitor.
Tangible things. Things that he could manipulate at will whenever necessary.
"Now, go ahead and run the end of the cinnamon along the finest side of the grater there," Steve said, smiling at Peter's look of intense concentration as he grated the small stick along the sharp ridges. "Good! That's right, we don't need too much. Just enough to help keep Dad's nose and lungs nice and open so he can breathe."
Scott bobbed his head. "Um… okay. So, then, T-Tony, I'm really sorry. I'm an engineer, but I still don't understand much of anything about this stuff. Hank just said that as long as I didn't mess too much with the regulator on the suit that I'd be fine, so…"
"Nope. You were full-on, Петр, the Colonel and I both saw it."
A thought suddenly occurred to him, his eyebrows knitting together as he tried to make sense of the zig-zaggy timeline.
"Yes, well, good day, Captain," Stacy said with a nod. Steve got the impression that he had more to say, but he had neither the patience nor the time to listen to him at the moment.
"My son's name is Peter Stark-Rogers, sir," Steve said firmly. "And that video meant to implicate my son was sent to various press outlets as a deliberate attempt by an enemy of our family to not only discredit us, but to also put us in danger. And since then it has been completely and thoroughly debunked, as I'm sure you're aware."
“Yeah.  Um… how many outstanding military contracts do we have?”
"Do you know how long Peter was submerged, Captain?" Dr Cho asked as she activated a warming blanket, covering Peter's lower body up to his chest.
"Pete? Something on your mind?" Dad asked.
"Okay, but what if we can't defend them?" asked Wong. "Bringing both stones together might just make it easier for Thanos to get his hands on them."
"Goddamnit!" Bucky yelled as he knocked Steve out of the way and pointed his rifle inside the tank, firing once.
"It—it didn't—it didn't pass," he murmured, cupping Tony's cheeks with trembling hands. "Tony—it didn't—"
“So, do you wanna talk about it?” Tony asked once Steve’s breathing was back to normal.  “I don't know if that usually helps you or not, but—”
"Yeah, see ya."
"So… um… when—when's the interview?"
"I'm pretty hungry too, actually," Peter said, muffled against Tony's shoulder. "Can we start eating now?"
Pressing the UP button, Steve curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, drawing him close and burying his nose into his hair. At the insistence of Colonel Phillips, both Steve and Tony had showered and changed clothes prior to Steve's discharge from the emergency department, and while the hospital-provided soap wasn't quite as nice as Steve's usual grapefruit shampoo, he still loved the smell of Tony's freshly washed hair.
He drew in a deep, slow breath, smelling the salt in the air from the Mediterranean Sea just a few metres away and feeling his limbs grow heavy with it, almost sinking into the plush cushions of the lounge chair. He could hear Thor somewhere a bit further down the beach, no doubt telling Bruce and Clint yet another one of his grand tales of victorious Asgardian battles, while Tony and James discussed the latest upgrade Tony had made to James's War Machine armour, one that Peter had helped design. Peter had gone into town a couple hours ago with Bucky, Nat, and Sam to shop for souvenirs to bring home, which Steve assumed also would include a nice gift for his lady friend.
"Hey, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said as he stepped into the room. "Thought maybe you might be up for another chess game now that you're done eating?"
"No, no, no!" he cried, his voice rising with every word. He pushed against Tony, nearly sending him off the side of the bed as he tried to crawl away. "Oh God, Papa, I
“Yes, sir,” Pepper said as she began matching his strides down the hallway, the mug cradled in his hands.  “However, I do need to inform you that you have—”
But impossible or not, that's exactly what was happening.
"Okay, bud, just… calm down, okay?" Tony said. He huffed out a sharp breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Pete—"
“Shh, baby, it’s okay,” Tony whispered as he kissed the top of Steve’s spine, right below his neck.  “I promise I’ll go slow.”
A soft smile spread across Steve's lips as he stared at the drawing, trailing his fingertip across Peter's round cheek smashed up against Tony's side. Peter's cheeks weren't quite as round anymore, and his jawline had sharpened up a bit more over the summer as well, only adding to how much he resembled Tony.
"Yeah, but that's the thing! What if it wasn't?" Scott asked. "What if we could somehow control the chaos, and fix all of… this? What if there was a way that we could enter the Quantum Realm at this point in time, and emerge in another point in time? Before Thanos?"
Steve watches him go, his heavy footsteps perfectly echoing the heavy beats of Steve’s heart.
"I'll talk to Fury about it," said Tony. "He may not have eyes and ears everywhere like he used to, but his net is still pretty wide. I'm sure he could find a way to track Beck without being obvious. Beck's got a pretty specific skill set, so he'll most likely try and go to a competitor, especially if he thinks he has some inside knowledge of my company that would make him valuable."
"I'll try, okay?" Peter answered, his heart dropping at the look of anguish on Gwen's face. "I'll at least text if nothing else."
"Mmm," grumbled Clint. "That's 'cause you just keep babying them, ya big pushover."
"Uh huh," said Peter. "Enjoy your day off."
"Sure Ned," said Gwen, with a rather exaggerated smile. "Peter?"
said Uncle Clint as he hurried to catch up with her. "You know I like the red so much better!"
"Um… well, I'm pretty sure that we didn't give you a choice in the matter, here, Steven," Hammer replied with a humourless chuckle. "So, ah, you may as well get started,
He felt Steve shudder against him as he drew in a deep, shaky breath.
"But then they obviously didn't get it, right?" asked Clint.
"And what?"
“Oh God!” Steve choked out.  “Oh God, I didn't—I didn't mean to—I didn't—
taking Tony's right hand into his as they started to sway back and forth.
"Oh," Peter got out just before she kissed him again, lingering as long as Peter dared to right in front of her house.
—filled Tony with a dread almost more paralysing than the news itself.  Tony could survive with a broken heart if he had to, but he would rather die than subject his precious son to that same pain.
The demons were just going to have to stay locked up for awhile longer.
“Mr Obadiah Stane, I am Agent Fury of the FBI,” Fury said, flashing his ID badge with a flourish.  “And you, sir, are under arrest for violating the Economic Espionage Act, for conspiring to arm insurgents against a duly-elected government, for conspiracy to commit treason, and, based on these last few minutes that we just witnessed from down the hall, assault on a highly-decorated Officer of the Army.”  He reached behind him for his handcuffs, taking hold of Obie’s wrists.  “You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law—”
Mama opened the back door and Peter scowled at the car seat.
“Clint?” He demanded when he stayed quiet, his voice going down an octave and slipping into his Alpha voice. It made Tony whimper at the sound of it. His heat was making him crazy, he needed Steve locked to him, not this artificial cock that didn’t stop the burning need. Now Steve was using his Alpha voice and Tony wasn’t sure what he did wrong?
Also shoutout to the user that suggested the shirt. I liked it so in the story it goes.
Tony squawked. “Steve, no. I have so much to do this week and Pepper will literally kill me if I don’t do it. Do you want me to die?”
“Tony is fine. He should be coming to in a minute once he calms down. It’s about Clint.”
“Probably, he’s more than likely going to throw a major tantrum. Nothing we can do about it though, other than braving the storm. I’m hoping Peter will help him adjust.”
Peter nodded, “Yeah, Jamie. You’re sick. Mama is gone to shower, but Dada will try his best.” He said, getting a laugh off of Dada.
Steve raised an eyebrow at his Omega glaring at him. He had not been expecting this when he walked in. From Peter maybe but not from Tony.
The whole wearing a diaper thing was something else he needed to be able to control. He should know when he needed to pee or even poop. That’s not something his mind should forget how to do. He wondered if he would be able to hold it? He hadn’t pooped at all today so he may just wait until he got the urge and hold it until he got to a toilet. If Mama and Dada wouldn’t bring him, he’d sneak away from them and use it. Surely it wouldn’t be too difficult. They’d be super busy with Jamie being so little.
| DooDooDooDooDooDoo
If nothing else the smile on his face was worth it because Tony knew their son.
“Do you think they’ll fall asleep in the car?” Steve asked Tony quietly. He didn’t want either little thinking they were going for a nap. It would be a sure way to keep them awake.
“Looks like someone finally decided to wake up Mama.” He commented, “Come up here to me, your poor Mama needs to pee.” Peter grumbled but didn’t kick up too much of a fuss, cuddling into his Daddy’s chest when he was close enough, earning a laugh from the captain.
“Mama, why are you driving?” He asked it wasn’t that he minded him driving but when Uncle Happy drove his Dad would normally sit in the back with him.
“Bye guys! Can’t wait to show you how many sweets I get.” Peter called over his shoulder. Tony who was following behind them stopped and looked at the rest of the team. “You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Peter is having a sleepover with each of you until that bucket is empty, just FYI.”
“Yeah, Mama.” Peter said softly. It wasn’t spending time with Harley but Peter loved his movie nights with his parents. He was always allowed to stay up late to watch them.
“Eh Papa? I just told someone I’m 14. Is that okay?” He asked, staring between his parents who were still sitting on the couch in front of him.
Finally, he sat back and looked up at his Dad, who smiled down at him. Peter loved that smile. It was so different from his press smile or his meeting smile. There was something softer about this smile that changed his Dad’s face completely, making it more relaxed.
“Only with you sweetheart. And only because we love you so much.”
Tony felt Peter trembling and pulled him closer. He knew Peter wouldn’t understand the whole traditional aspect. Maybe that was his fault. He did tend to baby him a lot but in his defence, Omega’s were always more innocent and affectionate compared to Beta’s and Alphas. This was why he told Steve to let him break it to Peter first before he came in and explained the rest.
The kid had to learn a few things for himself.
“Steve Roger’s, Steve?” Peter couldn’t believe it. He wouldn’t have thought Steve was going to be an Alpha like that.
“Steve.”
“Okay sweetheart. How about a little snack and then we’ll get dressed and go trick or treating. Go say hello to your aunt and uncles.” He put Peter down and turned him toward where the rest of the Avengers were sitting.
“Are you sure Mr Stark? I don’t know what to say.” Was Mama sure about what?
Peter nodded and looked out the window, surprised when he saw the Avengers tower in front of him. He didn’t realise they had gotten there so quick. Peter was just glad he didn’t fall asleep on the way home like he usually did.
Tony parked up, but kept the car running, Peter would be sure to wake up if it was turned off. Raising the music a little, Tony jammed along to all the rock classics, taking a minute to take a picture of Peter and send it to Steve. He got a response straight away of three heart emoji.
Steve saw his hips rotating even more, obviously trying to get more friction on his cock, “Stop.”
He unbuckled him quickly and slid his arms out of the belt, bringing him over the buggy that Tony had set up, rolling his eyes fondly when he saw another blanket where the headrest was.
Hey! So yeah it's like 11 days before Christmas but look, the Halloween story is done so yay! Sorry about the delay but it got done!
Peter couldn’t say he was too upset over it though, he didn’t like camera’s going off in his face all the time.
“Jamie does need your help,” Dada said, taking him out of his highchair. Peter stood, waiting for Dada to take Jamie out of his one. Dada made a good choice in taking off Jamie’s clothes before he picked him up. Jamie didn’t stop crying and whining throughout the whole process, looking at Peter like he needed help. A sudden thought came to Peter, that Jamie looked up to him, and wanted him to help him. He felt his tummy go warm at the look that Jamie was giving him. He ran over after Dada had his clothes off and Peter held back a giggle at seeing Jamie’s tummy. He reached up and took Jamie’s hand to let him know he was here. Jamie’s grip was surprisingly soft, yet strong enough that Peter wasn’t in fear of their hands separating.
“Oh, baby.” He heard Mama say but he couldn’t respond. Now they’d never think he was a big boy. This was all ruined! Peter fell onto his bottom in defeat, crying his heart out. He would never be a big boy now. It wasn’t fair!
Peter grinned, Karen was awesome. He’d figure out a way to go as an AI for Halloween and go as her next year. Right now though he needed to get upstairs and get things together! He’d have to be smart about it if he wanted to get out of his after-school ‘eye rest’, maybe Papa would let it go this once so he’d be able to spend his time getting ready! Who cared if he was ‘grouchy’ without the nap. He was sure he’d be okay today. The sugar would keep him going.
“Amazing. Now Bucky I’m going to show you some blocks. I need you to take a look at them and sort them into three groups for me okay?” Bucky nodded eagerly, he liked blocks. They always looked so fun to play with.
“Excuse me? What is happening in here?” Tony asked, getting everyone to stop for a second. It was all he got before Peter launched himself at Tony, sobbing into his neck while Tony rocked him. Jamie had stopped hitting Steve and was now pouting at both of them, his pale sweaty face taking a green twinge once more. Steve barely made it to the skin before Jamie was throwing up once again. Tony heard Peter gagging and felt something wet hit his front. Peter just threw up on him. This day was never-ending. He met Steve’s eyes and knew that he felt the same. It was going to be a long few days with two sick babies.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, my big boy. Did you have a nice bath?” Peter nodded shyly, opening his mouth for the applesauce which tasted really good, opening it more eagerly for more. He was taking his last bite from Dada when he heard a weird noise coming from Jamie. He and Dada both looked over in time to see Jamie vomit all over Mama who just looked resigned. There was a beat of silence and then Jamie let out a wail. Oh boy.
“Oh god, Alpha, I’m-I’m.” That was all Tony could get out before he came explosively against Steve. Steve tried to hold back but Tony clenching down on him trigged his knot and before he knew it they were tied together again.
“You want Mama to have a cookie as well?” Peter nodded happily, hoping this made him feel better.
Peter reared back, his eyes wide. “No! I don’t want him to go!” Before Tony could say anything else Peter was up and gone, screaming for Harley not to leave him. Tony didn’t have it in him to give out to Peter for running and shouting in the house. He followed at a more sedate pace and got to the living room in time to see Harley tearily hugging Peter back.
Clint gulped, this was not going to be fun.
“Does that mean I’ll have a brother? Will he be my big brother or a baby brother? Can he be my baby brother? I promise I’ll protect him!” He begged, causing Steve and Tony to laugh at the excited little.
Who do you look like the most? Your Mama or Papa?
“Sorry Papa, I was just so excited to go home so we could get ready!” Peter’s voice was muffled in his Papa’s chest but he didn’t care. He loved hugs off the man.
at it. He wasn’t going to open it.
Bucky finally let go of his cock, which was leaking by this point and red. Bucky said he was only allowed to come at the end if he was good and his stupid Omega traits took that seriously. As much as he wanted to come he didn’t want to disappoint Bucky. The thoughts of the physical were freaking him out as well, he was extremely relieved that Bucky was staying close to him. When Bucky moved to stand up, he involuntarily moved Clint with him so that Clint was standing in front of Bruce.
“And- and they just ignored me the whole way home Papa. Mama doesn’t want to spend any time with me at all because Harley is here. Do you think Mama likes Harley better than me?”
Peter lay down and relaxed, delighted that his uncle Bucky was here as well. There was one thing bothering him though. “Papa, am I not too old for all of this?” He asked. No one else in school seemed to have schedules as he did, or naps got spankings still.
“In here Pete.” Peter went into the living room where his Dad was, dropping his bag at the door on the way. He’d pick it up later.
Peter put down his phone and pouted at it. “That last person was mean.”
“Maybe but Peter isn’t lacking anything in life. He’s well balanced, happy, well adjusted. Peter is aware we baby him and doesn’t mind it because that’s the kind of boy he is. He actually enjoys it because he loves the attention and loves seeing us happy. He’s not being held back and that’s all that matters. He had a great day today and that’s all that matters.” Steve said, running a hand through Peter’s hair.
“So- it’s cause you love me that you give out to me? Do you not love Harley?” Peter was devastated to think that Harley wasn’t as loved.
“Okay. Let’s head into your room and I’ll get the shower ready for you. I’ll leave fresh pyjamas ready for you on your bed as well. Make sure to clean behind those ears.” Steve teased, earning a small laugh out of Peter. It wasn’t the usual happy giggle he was used to but it would have to do. He could see Peter was trying.
“Okay, Mama. Peter sits in the car seat this time.” He made sure to emphasise the ‘this’ just so his Daddie’s wouldn’t get any ideas in the future. He was rewarded with a kiss to his forehead before he was expertly strapped into the seat and the door was shut on his side. Peter looked down, pulling at the harness to see if it would come off.
This wasn’t fair! Peter let out an involuntary wail the more he thought about it. What was he supposed to do now?!
Steve slid out of Tony and saw himself back on the chair, Pulling Tony so that he was sitting on top of him, and slipped his cock back in. “Tony, Bruce needs help with a question.”
“I’m going to check on Bucky. He probably slept through it but you never know.” Bucky was notorious for being a deep sleeper. Peter had woken up early from the nap, Tony wouldn’t be surprised if he fell back asleep. They’d have to change him though. He put his sweatpants on backwards and had two t-shirts on. He also had the flaps of his vest hanging over the sweatpants. It was extremely cute to look at and he made Friday get some photos of Peter but it wouldn’t do after that.
Hey! A new chapter is up! It's been ages and that's nor right but life etc. Let me know what you think of this chapter! It's only a short one I know but if I didn't post it today it would be another week before I was able to get back to it.
Peter grinned, “Awesome! Thank you so much for letting me have twitter! Can I put a picture of the two of you?”
“Do you think Papa will mind?” Peter asked as he cuddled into his Dad and watched him go through setting up his account first, giggling slightly at the name he created. @Iamironman was such an obvious username. He had to provide a copy of his passport to get his account verified. “Can I get my account verified like that?” Being verified straight away would be sick!
Peter slumped back against his pillows, his fingernails digging into his palms and cringing at the gross rattling sounds that he made with every single inhale. Papa had told him after the trial mission that the only part of being in space that he hadn't liked was how cold it was, and the thought of his poor papa up there all alone… slowly freezing to death…
"Shh," Gwen whispered. "It's okay, you can tell me."
"Then we best get started," said Howard. He pointed towards one of the electrical techs, then checked his own timepiece. "Vita ray commencement on my mark. Mark."
"Yeah, usually," Peter said as he peered through the telescope again, his heart starting to thud when he saw how much bigger it had already grown. It also didn't seem to be travelling across the sky, like a comet normally would.
"Well, Captain Rogers, you are absolutely correct." Tony shuffled through his slides, locating the diagram that gave the details of the central engine. "The two twin engines are regular jet engines designed to be used under normal aviation conditions beneath the planet's atmosphere, each containing enough power to safely land the aircraft in the event of a single-engine failure, and—"
"Please," Peter croaked through his raw throat. "I just wanna go home."
"And once we do, I've got some friends in the FBI who are ready to help," said Stacy. "As well as myself."
“Thank you, Miss Potts.  That’s all for now.”
Tony frowned. "That's a bit weird, isn't it? I mean, it's not like I'm gonna complain that you were only shot at once during a six-hour patrol, but that doesn't happen very often, does it?"
"Honey," Tony whimpered, his teeth caught around his lush bottom lip. He was already close. "I'm—I need—I need—"
"Ahh…" Tony said slowly, grimacing. "Um, how many people are we thinking here?"
"I know. And that's okay," Steve said with a nod. At the moment, he honestly didn't care how long it took if it meant they could get their son back. "I'll… I can be patient."
And there was even whipped cream on the top.
“Steve, maybe you're making a bigger deal out of this than you should,” Natasha says.  “I mean, who knows?  Maybe the dad will meet you and decide that he doesn't want you anywhere near his kid?”
“And what benefit might that be?”
"But—but, you guys told me to get the wizard!" Peter wheezed, blinking as the ship flew through a huge, puffy cloud. His lungs felt like two massive blocks of ice in his chest, his throat so tight he could barely speak. "Daddy, I can't—I can't breathe!"
"Goddamnit, Pete!" he said, panting as his helmet disappeared. "That was way too close!"
Peter shook his head. "Dad, I don't—I was just trying to finish this, and—"
"I'm here, sweetheart," he said, much stronger than he'd sounded before. "JARVIS is starting my approach now."
"All right, sweetheart. All right," Steve murmured. He sucked in a deep breath, squeezing Tony's shoulder.
“What?” demanded Peter.  “What do I have to understand?  I thought you loved Steve!”
“You still sure about this?” he asks.  “‘Cause… oh God, Steve, I’m about ninety-eight point seven percent sure this is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch, and—”
Tony instinctively reached for Steve, only to have his arm grabbed by one of the other agents. "Use against me?" he said as he tore himself free. "They don't have
Davis began, clearing his throat.
"Yep, got it."
"I have to," Peter finally answered. He let out a hapless shrug, biting his bottom lip. "Otherwise, what's the point? What's going on, it needs to stop. It all needs to stop. 'Cause if it doesn't, then what happened to my papa's papa, and my Uncle James, and to you, it'll just happen again to someone else down the road. And that's just not okay."
Peter shot her one of his
"Really?" Rogers said on a gasp. A wide smile stretched across his gorgeous full lips, the little crinkles by his eyes only enhancing his overall hotness factor. "Oh, that's great! Um… would tomorrow night work? I could grab us something and pick you up here at 2100, if that's okay?"
"I've been trying for his entire life, babe, and I'm still not," added Dad. He brushed the hair from Peter's forehead and kissed him, his fingertips rubbing the back of Peter's neck like he loved. "I'm gonna get Papa back to the base now, bud, okay? He needs to rest."
Clearing his throat, Tony schooled his face into his usual I-don't-give-a-damn-what-you-think-of-me expression that he always wore when dealing with members of the government or press as he stepped inside the room, blinking against the explosions of camera flashes as he made his way up to the tables set up near the front, with Steve right on his heels. At Rhodey's suggestion, Steve was dressed in his full Army dress uniform, and he cut such an incredibly handsome figure that it had taken nearly all of Tony's self-control earlier that morning to not grab him by his perfectly pressed lapels and drag him back inside their apartment.
"Got it," replied Natasha, approaching one of the computer terminals as Steve headed for the first set of doors, again breaking the lock easily with his shield.
It would help if Steve could get his own thoughts in order about what happened during Peter Stark’s swimming tryout yesterday afternoon.  But since he spent almost the entire night attempting to do so and still managed to fail in spectacular fashion, he honestly has no clue how to explain any of this to Natasha in a way that would make sense.
Seven different levels of hell, all of which almost took Peter's life or the life of one or both of his dads.
"Ah huh. Even if they're now inspiring other people to try and play superhero?" asked Mr Stacy. "Does that change your opinion at all?"
Peter maybe wasn't an official superhero, but he was strong and fast and… well… sticky enough to be able to defend himself if necessary, and especially against someone who wasn't enhanced. And as far as anyone knew, George Stacy was just a regular guy who happened to be a police chief. There was no way he'd be able to beat Peter in a fight.
"With my help, I believe that he can," Helen said. "Dr Wright has pioneered many new techniques during his twenty years of practice, and is the only orthopaedic surgeon that I would personally trust with the captain."
"This isn't how I'd planned to do this at all," Steve blurted out. "But… I'd love it if you could close your eyes, and imagine that we're out near the baseball field where we used to have our picnics, and that I'm standing in front of you right now, holding both of your hands. Can you see it, Tony?"
And since Steve's instincts were usually spot on Tony knew better than to discount them, especially since he had been so much better lately. His twice weekly talks with Sam and daily sparring sessions with Thor had both done wonders for his mental health, and while the nightmares hadn't gone away completely, they had at least decreased in both frequency and severity.
"Oh, how cool!" Peter exclaimed. "I've read about those magic pools in some of my books!"
"I never said you were," Steve said. He dropped his shoulders, letting out a heavy sigh as he glided his palms up Tony's back. "I just… want you to remember that you're not alone in this. I'm here, and so is the rest of the team. And none of us like to see you like this, under so much constant stress. Especially Peter."
"So Fury's gone, then?" the woman interrupted, and Steve could've sworn that she looked almost sad.
"Yeah, I'm—I'm okay," Peter said, flinching as something he could only describe as a giant wearing a space suit suddenly skidded to a halt about ten metres away, connecting its massive right fist with some weird alien's chin and sending him flying into a pack of what looked like really bad-CGI versions of the wargs from Lord of the Rings. "But—but what—? What
"Peter, that's not being respectful," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "It doesn't matter how smart you are or how strong you've become, you're still a child—"
"I always do, little guy," said Steve. "Sleep well."
In fact, as Tony stole a quick glance up at him, he was quite certain that he'd never seen a more exquisite sight than Steve's beautiful face twisted in pleasure.
"Mmm. I'm sure Uncle James will give them a full report anyway. He always does."
"Yeah, it's done. Gwen and I did our homework as soon as we got to her house."
There was a short pause while the UI pondered the question. "I believe the interface is working, sir. It is simply a problem of your eyes being unable to process the imagery the interface is sending you."
"I do," Steve whispered, tightening his arm around Tony's waist. He trailed his fingertips up Tony's abdomen to his chest, circling the arc reactor, the soft blue glow reflecting off of the silky ivory sheets. There were still plenty of nights when his dreams haunted him, when Tony's bright blue light dulled to grey before disappearing completely, and he cried out in anguish.
"No, no, no, Птер, now's not the time to give up!" cried Bucky from the bed. He tucked Peter to his chest, giving his cheek a light slap to try and keep him conscious. "Stay with me, kiddo, you need to fight this!
"No!" screamed Image Peter. "You can't have me!"
"Well, that's very generous of you, Mr Stark," added Stacy. "I know we're all looking forward to it, and Gwen especially."
"Two."
of people treating him like nothing more than some helpless little kid, when he'd been the one who had come up with most of the Phoenix mission in the first place.
"Copy that, Two," Tony said. "Steve, how's it looking?"
"As you wish, sir," JARVIS said, followed immediately by the familiar sound of his repulsors charging. They fired a split-second later, emanating the sound of his conventional suits almost perfectly.
"Oh, no! No, of course you don't have to explain it!" Lang exclaimed. "I mean, I don't even know who your father was, Mr Stark, let alone—but you're—well… you're Iron Man! My daughter even has one of your action figures! And personally, I don't think your suit is cute at all. I think it's totally badass."
Steve's flight suit was plastered to his body with sweat as he pulled the aircraft to a stop and opened the canopy, handing the groundsman his helmet before jumping down. His legs wobbled a bit as he landed, not too surprising since he hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, but also because Anthony Stark was still standing on the observation deck next to Phillips and staring directly at Steve.
“Oh God!” Tony said on a gasp.  There was no way he could tell Peter that Steve had been kidnapped.  Peter had been so worried for Tony while he was being held prisoner in Afghanistan that he’d lost almost fifteen pounds, and was barely more than skin and bones by the time he and Tony were reunited at Bagram Air Force base.
"It's nothing," he said, sniffing. "I'm just—"
"Indeed, Captain," said JARVIS. "I can assure you that neither of these young men were aware of the final product."
Steve grinned, sliding his hand across the console to cover Tony's knee. "Well, like I said. I was really proud of what you did for Scott today. You gave him a job and made it possible for him to see his daughter in the span of only a couple of minutes. Tony, he's going to get his entire life back on track now, and it's all thanks to you."
It was ignorance.
Steve chuckled, his lips now trailing down to meet his fingers, still trailing back and forth across the sensitive skin of Tony's waist.
Just… gone. Vanished. Disappeared.
That was all Tony had ever wanted. For his sweet, beloved boy to look at him like he loved him, and was proud of him.
"No, Captain," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter's parachute deployed, but it was then released only two point four-five seconds later. It is my understanding that he went aboard the ship as it exited Earth's atmosphere."
Steve was
"Hey, Dad. How was your day?" Peter said once he answered the phone, his voice so small and tired that Tony's heart lurched.
“Come in?” he heard Obie say through the thick mahogany wood, so petulant and sing-songy that bile rose in the back of Tony’s throat.  Obie was clearly sitting in there, likely half-hidden in a cloud of cigar smoke, expecting Tony to show up and capitulate to his outrageous demands that he cut Steve out of his life.
But as the alarm sounded and all of the lights began to vanish across the non-essential sections of the base, Steve's thoughts suddenly shifted to young Peter, sitting alone in his hospital room with nothing but an old notebook for company. He very much hoped that Peter's father had been able to make it in to see him before the lights cut out and all civilians were supposed to be sequestered in their homes, because while he believed that he'd managed to brighten Peter's day a bit, he had a strong feeling that Peter would have far preferred the company of his own father to some random pilot. Especially if the father was as loving and protective as Sharon had indicated.
He had overheard Dad and Papa arguing in Dad's lab late one night when he was trying to retrieve one of his books from the living room. Peter normally didn't like to eavesdrop on his dads when they were bickering, as their disagreements usually were something along the lines of how Dad wasn't taking care of himself the way Papa wanted him to or how Papa was working himself too hard in the gym. But then he had heard Papa say his name, and his curiosity ended up getting the better of him.
"Sure, little guy, it's okay," Papa said, a sort of sad smile on his face. "Long as you're back up here before bedtime, okay?"
If only Tony could have even a fraction of that kind of courage.
"How sick was he?" he quietly asked. "My papa, how bad was he?"
With wide eyes, Steve hurried over to the food line, barely noticing what he was grabbing as he filled his tray.
"I know you are, sweetheart," he whispered as he brought their joined hands back down onto the table. "But I'm still not letting you leave until Shuri says it's okay. She wants to make sure that you don't have any issues with the skin grafts."
Tony's eyebrows immediately shot up. "Now wait just a goddamn minute, Nick. You promised me after Steve got attacked that all of HYDRA was finally accounted for, and now—"
"Mmm," grumbled Bucky. "Not sure I like that. If we're gonna be risking our lives to get there, I'm gonna wanna know why!"
"You do remember that none of my PhDs are in repairing spacecraft, right?" Bruce said, obviously just as frustrated as Tony.
"Yeah, and we know all of 'em," added Tony. He grabbed the stuffed polar bear he'd snuck out of Peter's room, scratching it behind its fuzzy ears. He'd been doing that a lot in the last few months, fiddling with Peter's toys while he tried to work, and even more so in the twenty-four hours since Scott Lang showed up on their doorstep.
Surprisingly, despite his swirling mind, Steve was able to doze off for a couple hours, only waking after the Quinjet began its descent into Namibia. Blinking his eyes open, Steve raised his head, pressing against a sore spot on his neck as Sam's voice came over the intercom.
"Oh, I'm sure you'll eventually be able to figure it out,
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
Tony started, like he had forgotten Steve was there. "Um… well, I'm thinking that somehow my arc reactor was able to ward off the more direct effects of this Mind Stone," he said. "'Cause Loki tried the same thing with me when we got to the Tower after the portal opened up, only it didn't work."
"Are you familiar with the name, James Buchanan Barnes?"
The Avengers were supposed to fight the battles that regular people couldn't, and since Peter was in no way a regular person, that meant he had an obligation to help.
"Who, me?" Peter asked as Steve tore his eyes away from Tony just long enough to look Peter over, guilt piercing him like a bayonet as he noticed that part of Peter's face and neck were bright red and covered in small raised blisters, like he'd been out in the sun for too long. "No, I'm not—"
"I wasn't asking about the Meridians, Steve," Tony said. "I was asking about you."
After pondering for a couple of minutes, Steve typed in another query, this time searching for the names of current and former civilian scientist liaisons, a list for which his clearance level was just barely high enough.
, Steve thought as he ran his thumb across Tony's knuckles, his breath hitching when Tony's fingers tightened around his.
"Oh, I usually wind up going through at least five backpacks by the end of the year," Peter said quickly, fighting the urge to cringe a split-second later. "I mean—I sometimes forget where they are, or I—"
"Is there a problem, sir?" Tony asked.
Iron Man, damnit—there was no way he was going to complain about the way Steve's large hands were currently sliding across his head and body.
"Uhh, you know about Thanos?" asked Bruce.
"We know, Peter," Papa said softly, kissing the top of Peter's head. "Uncle Bucky could hear the words in his mind too, which is why Uncle Sam got him right out of here as soon as possible. He wasn't gone yet, but he was slipping."
"Whoa!" Peter exclaimed. "You really think we're travelling at Warp Six right now?"
"That's fine, Sam," said Steve. "Thank you."
"All right, Tony, I get it," Steve said quickly. "And for Peter? I'm assuming you're making something for him as well?"
Are you sure?"
A knot rose in Peter's throat as he watched his father exit his room, slumping back against his pillows as soon as the door closed behind him. Dad hadn't sounded that optimistic about anything in months, and Peter knew him well enough to know that he hadn't just said what he'd said for his own benefit.
“And I just told
"Uh huh, I know," said Peter. He had heard a few students discussing the news stories in the hallways that day, and Ned had even asked him about it during lunch, telling Peter that the president of his mom's book club had called her that morning to ask if she knew if the Avengers were heading to Africa yet.
The cracked and leaking dam that had been holding back the raging river of Peter's emotions for most of the day finally broke, and he crumpled forward, knocking the tray aside as he collapsed into his father's arms. Dad immediately pulled him close, burying his nose into Peter's hair as his entire body shook with sobs.
"Okay, but just… hang on a second, yeah?" Tony asked. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose with shaking fingers. "It's not that I mind you guys visiting with my son, 'cause I know he loves the company, but don't you think that someone should've asked me first?"
"And again, Steve, this is not your fault," Natasha said. "From everything I've heard, our boy was a hero while all of this was going down."
Once again Wanda's eyes filled with fear, and she glanced down at her hands, twisting them as flashes of bright red light sparkled between her fingers. Peter instinctively gulped and stepped back; apparently she was the one who had caused him to have that horrible vision where he saw Dad and Papa's graves, and saw Gwen fall to her death.
And now that Steve was pretty much his second dad, Peter wasn't going to do it to him either.
"Is that why you can't explain to us how your suit works, Mr Lang?" he asked. "Because you don't know how?"
"Do we know if there's any further information on Raxton in these files?" he asked.
Because their phoenix had not only been reborn from its own ashes, it had also carried Steve safely home from space on its wings and healed Peter's broken heart with its tears.
“Yes,” Steve managed to whisper.  He pressed his lips to Tony’s one final time before pulling back.  “Yes, I really want that.”
"Nope, you know that's not gonna work on me, honey," Tony interrupted, gently but firmly. "You can't be mother hen-ing everyone else and then forget to take care of your own stuff, right?"
"And none of the team has a problem with it either," Bucky said firmly. "In fact, Carol came right out and said that if anyone said anything about either you or Tony that she didn't like, she'd kick their ass. And you know Mitchell and Lorne are scared of her so they're not gonna try anything, and you know Sam won't either, so… it's fine, Steve. No need to worry about it."
A soft smile stretched across Papa's lips, and he reached for Peter's hand, giving it a light squeeze. "Sometimes I forget just how perceptive you are, little guy," he said. "Don't ever lose that, okay? Empathy is so important, and so many people seem to have forgotten that."
"Okay, but honey, just listen for a second, yeah? Yes, we are stopping him. We have been stopping him. But we're nowhere near to actually getting
"O-kay," Tony said slowly. "But—"
Peter's heart fluttered.
"As long as they don't figure out where he's hidden his arrows," Natasha answered, barely hiding her smirk. "Or ask him for help with their math homework."
Steve’s blindness to Brock had translated to abject denial that his shoulder was as messed-up as it was, and that denial ended up costing him everything.
"You did
Rogers immediately nodded, his frown deepening as he sat back on his chair.
"Nope, nope, don't ask," Peter said quickly as Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky launched into one of their verbal jab competitions. He leaned closer, whispering, "It's a Monty Python thing. I think."
"All right, and does that also include the rules for expanding your team?"
"I'm not gonna be injecting Finley with anything, Ned, okay?" Peter said. "And especially not some other animal's DNA. I'm not gonna create some mutant, glowing fish in my bedroom."
He may be a super-kid, but he was still just a kid. And he deserved to keep whatever innocence he could for as long as possible.
"Steve, as soon as we figured this out I texted the guy's picture to Bucky and all six of the security guards stationed around the theatre, so they know who to look for if Smythe does try to show his face," said Tony. "But chances are very high that the feds are gonna be picking him up in the next few minutes, so we won't have to worry about him for too much longer."
he thought, his shoulders sagging in relief. He laid back against his pillows, trying to relax.
And ever since then they've been trying to get him back, either to figure out where they went wrong, or use him to perfect their conversion process.
"We shall."
"I do," Steve had said as he placed his hand on Peter's shoulder. "And I love you as well. You're like the son I never thought I'd get to have, and I am so lucky that I got to meet you."
"Uh, yeah. Why wouldn't it be?" asked Peter, and Tony could just picture his son's eyebrows knitting together into what Tony had long-ago affectionately dubbed his
Peter launched a web in the direction of the oncoming sentry suit, gripping it tight as it yanked him up out of the sand and into the air. The monster immediately lunged for Peter, grabbing onto his ankle as Peter struggled to hold onto the web rope with his sand-slicked hands.
Gasping for breath, the man frantically shook his head, his lips moving as if he was trying to speak, which only seemed to infuriate Tony even more.
"Oh, it is!" interrupted Gwen. "Nice, that is. Your papa was right, it looks—it looks good."
"Mmm. I think you don't give yourself enough credit," muttered Steve. "You and Peter are so alike, in so many ways. Most of what he knows he's learned from you."
"Hopefully," Peter answered. "I'll still have to ask, but I don't know what excuse they would have for saying no."
"Not exactly," replied Steve, low and tight as T'Challa began chanting a traditional Wakandan war chant, one his warriors answered in turn.
Steve shook his head, holding out his arm for his shield to return to him. "I will
"Nah, it's just the first day, I won't have too much," answered Peter. "And that sounds awesome."
"Which is probably why he only lasted a few days," said Steve. "Hopefully this guy will be better."
Steve thought desperately.
Tony understood. No one understood fighting demons better than Tony.
"Nope, nope, we're not going there!" Tony cut in.
He couldn't allow himself to wallow in his own uncertainty, though. Not when there was so much work to be done, and so many other grieving people to attend to.
Dr Strange pursed his lips, glaring at Mantis. "For the last time, they are not dead! I have been dead before. Dozens of times, in fact, so I can assure you that none of the missing persons are dead! They have simply been… relocated. Now, if all of you are finally done asking all of your foolish questions, it is time for us to get going!"
"No!" Papa shrieked from somewhere behind him, sounding very far away. "No, please, don't hurt him! He's only a boy!"
“Pretty sure I never will be.”  Steve was just leaning down for another kiss when Peter reappeared from the back, groaning in mock-disgust.
Grandma nodded, briefly cupping his cheek. "As you should. Bucky and Sam should be here in about an hour or so, once Bucky's done with his physical therapy. I've asked them to bring along some board games, would you like that?"
"Yeah," Steve said. "And I can't wait."
“That’s… not why I’m here, Mr Stane,” he stated, in the same voice Tony had heard him use with his subordinates hundreds of times.  “But since you’ve asked, allow me to introduce my compatriots here.  First we have—”
agreed Ma, placing her hand proudly on Little Steve's shoulder. "
“That is correct, Master Peter.  However, Special Forces operate under a different set of rules from the regular Army squadrons, and are therefore not included in discussions involving official military presence.”
"That's 'cause I am!" Clint answered, clinging to Thor's arm for support as he caught his breath. "So why the hell don't you two get a room and spare us the unwelcome sideshow, eh?"
Tony shot his husband a deep, menacing frown, almost growling when Steve gave it right back to him. "See? I can do it too."
He and his teammates were going to overthrow their government.
"Two Dr Pepper floats, please," Papa said to the waitress once they were seated. As soon as she stepped away, Papa leaned forward, his blue eyes radiating concern. "So… I was talking with Chief Stacy up at the school while we were waiting for you and Gwen, and—"
"Didn't anyone ever tell you guys that guns are dangerous?" Peter called as he swung down to the van, running straight for the weapons when one of the guys pulled back his arm, which Peter noticed about a second too late was covered in a long, silver-coloured gauntlet that looked like a very crude version of one of Dad's gauntlets. The man's metal fist connected directly with Peter's midsection, launching him backwards at least ten metres. He landed flat on his back, briefly knocking the wind from him as the men jumped into the van and started to drive off.
the goddamn time to be starting that argument again, especially when you can't even walk!" Tony snapped back. "Now, get into bed, soldier, and that's an order!"
"All right." Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's forehead for good measure before sliding off the bed, the strong muscles in his arms, back, and shoulders rippling deliciously. As soon as he'd crossed the spacious room to the bathroom, Tony flopped onto his stomach, burying his face into Steve's pillow and breathing in. It was an extremely poor substitute for the man himself, but it would do well enough until he came back.
"You know what to do, my dear."
Stepping into Tony’s office, Steve’s heart skipped a beat as Sam, Bucky, and Colonel Rhodes all immediately shot up from the couch.  Both Bucky and Colonel Rhodes were dressed in their military uniforms, their jackets carefully draped over Tony’s jacket holder, and Bucky had also removed his prosthetic arm, his empty left shirtsleeve carefully pinned out of the way.
"Longing!" the monster roared, his sand-laden foot pressing even harder as Peter attempted to squirm out from underneath it. "Rusted! Furnace! Daybreak! Seventeen—"
"As he should," answered Steve. "I know he managed to get me completely hooked after only a single conversation."
do you mean you’ve lost contact with him?” Tony snapped, glaring bullets up at the visage of Nick Fury on his viewscreen.  “For fuck’s sake, Nick, it’s been almost four weeks!  Steve’s radio silence wasn’t supposed to last this long!”
" Tony said, rather cheekily. "You think you're up to the challenge?"
“Yep, that was me as well,” answered Steve.  “And thank you, little guy.  You’re very kind.”
"You don't need to worry about anything, Pete," he murmured into Peter's hair. "I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, and neither is Papa."
“I’m not delusional, Tony, and I’m not Captain America right now,” Steve says.  “This is me, Steve.  And I’m telling you that I'm in love with you.”
"Pete—"
As hard as it was, Steve simply had to trust that Peter would fight just as well—or likely even better—than he did during their training sessions. He was still plenty nervous, especially since Peter was a lot like Tony out in the field, meaning that he was both constantly improvising and had a tendency to lean a bit too far towards self-sacrifice than Steve would've preferred.
They had made the Avengers disappear.
“I see,” says Mr Rogers, steepling his hands on the table.  “You do know that swimming isn't a completely individual sport, right?  There are relay teams.”
"Please, Thor, continue," said Steve, barely clinging to his patience. "We're kind of on the clock here."
"But that can mean a lot of things," Steve said quickly, his mind racing with all of the various possibilities. Peter's absence could simply mean that instead of leaving the schoolbus transporting him to his museum field trip that morning, he had stayed put when the alien's ship had arrived, knowing that his dads wouldn't want him placing himself in unnecessary danger.
But he also knew that he couldn't allow Tony to blame himself for something so completely out of his control, no matter how badly he wanted to.
"I know," Steve groaned against him. "I know 'cause I can feel you. I can feel you all around me." Steve's words were choked, which meant he was getting close. "You feel so good, Tony. So incredibly good, I can't—I can't—"
you, and there wasn't a single damn thing that I could do about it except hold your hand and beg you to stay with me!"
"Yeah," Tony murmured, but Steve wasn't convinced. His body was still rigid with tension, his fingertips digging into Steve's shoulder blades like he was afraid to let go.
"Are you sure that's all it was?" he asked, quirking his eyebrow in such a perfect imitation of Tony that Steve's heart lurched. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you almost dented the ceiling with how high you just jumped."
Not something that he would ever experience. And especially not with his
Which for all intents and purposes were already complete, since Peter apparently never made any mistakes.
Tony cut him off with a raised hand. "Scott, please, just… stop. This isn't gonna be
"Very good, sir. Estimated length of time required for the assembly is eight hours."
Tony smirked as he took another sip of his beer. "You know that'll mean fewer distractions for Pete though, right?"
"You are most welcome."
"No, he's not!" called Green Lady. She stepped over to Blaster Guy's opposite side, her fingers curling around his arm. "Peter, you're not gonna hurt the kid, right?"
"I can't wait to see it." Tony pursed his lips, drumming his fingers on his desk as he struggled to think of how to bring up the unpleasant topic.
was the first movie that Steve, Tony, and Peter watched together after Steve moved into the Tower.  It was Peter’s idea, thinking that it would help Steve start to feel more comfortable in this time, and while he remembers Tony grumbling a bit at the choice, he also vividly remembers Tony sticking around for the entire show.
“Ah, sure,” replied Colonel Rhodes.  “But so long as you didn't add anything since I last checked ‘em over, I’m pretty sure everything’s here.”
Because as much as Mags might like to think otherwise, Tony is just not ‘good’.  He’s the son of a man who’s literally made billions selling weapons, and was barely a hair’s breadth away from following in Howard’s footsteps when he got the phone call that would take his entire life and turn it right on its ear.
"Ah, yep!" Peter replied. "Just give me a couple minutes!"
"We'll come with you," Natasha said as she hooked her arm through Wanda's. "Gotta make sure that you stay out of the kitchen."
And of course, at the end of the night, once all the gifts had been opened and the enormous Christmas dinner had been eaten and all the games had been played, Tony and Steve had tucked Peter into bed and retreated to their own suite. Christmas marked the anniversary of their first night spent together, and they celebrated it by making love until the very wee hours of the morning, just like they had four years ago. They had even slept in the nude afterwards, something they usually only reserved for getaways when Peter wasn't with them.
Which is exactly what he did once he got home. After downing a massive mug of Papa's hot chocolate and taking a quick shower, as soon as Dad and Papa exited his room after tucking him in, Peter pulled out his two networked laptops and got to work, programming his JARVIS overrides Hufflepuff ten through fifteen while his dads worked—and argued—in Dad's lab, discussing the very things they didn't want him to overhear.
