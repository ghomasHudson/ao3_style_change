The light comes first, and then the sound and the concussive wave, exploding outwards with enough force to throw Tony backwards for the second time. The entire field is bathed in smoke, billowing out from where Loki had been standing in thick black and grey clouds. Amora hasn’t stopped screaming, her voice high and awful in the ringing silence, the Hulk roaring onto the scene as The Winter Soldier opens fire. The Hulk brings a hand down towards him, and he tumbles sideways, loosing another round of shots. The other woman blasts The Hulk backwards. There’s blood on Amora’s face, thick and viscous. It isn’t hers, and Tony has a moment to be worried that he’s done the wrong thing before Amora vanishes in a flash of green, the rest of her allies disappearing with her.
“Oh fuck,” Tony whispers. He stumbles back, sits down heavily on the edge of his bed. And then he’s sobbing: big, great heaves of it, quiet and desperate. He’s crying like Steve hasn’t seen him since he gave up drinking, like every sob is taking something precious and necessary from him.
Over the speaker system, he could hear AC/DC crooning “I want a mistress for Christmas” over and over, and he shook his head as he crested the top of the stairs. Leave it to Tony to pick a song like that. As he made his way through the crowd, the bodies began to get more and more packed, until finally Steve was forced to come to a standstill some good thirty feet from the walkway above the space shuttle where Tony was standing and chatting with Pepper. He looked incredible, decked out in a dark red tux that gleamed with a subtle floral design as he moved in it, and as Steve watched he turned to face the crowd with a wide grin.
“You had two years to tell me-” Tony begins, before a sharp spike of pain stops him in his tracks, panting. They’ve been down this road before, and it always ends the same. He suddenly feels very exposed, and he pushes himself to sitting. “Maybe I should go.”
Tony wrinkles his nose at him. “That was in the trash. It’s got other people’s spit in it.”
His hand pulls away, and Tony reaches back, catching Steve’s fingers against his for a moment. Steve breathes out, and then he steps back. Tony immediately misses the warmth, the security of having Steve behind him. He listens as Steve goes through the process of unlocking the door.
“Just look!” Peter says.
“I’m still here,” Carol tells him, and her voice betrays just how much she’s hurting, too. “I’m here, Tony. I’ve got you.”
He doesn’t fear the Hulk, exactly. The Hulk knows him, loves him even. He’s part of Bruce, after all. He’s all the broken bits, the child abuse and the suppressed PTSD, the shaking anger left over from trauma that Bruce never talks about. Tony’s not even sure Bruce remembers half of the things that have happened to him, but he wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t. The Hulk is a walking personification of C-PTSD, and both Bruce’s protector and his inner child love Tony. Perhaps, he thinks, Bruce has a point.
“Almost, gorgeous, I’m almost there.”
“There is no way Loki is touching me when I’m mind whammied.”
Tony rubs at his brow. “And bring me some aspirin?”
“What does that matter?” Tony asks, bewildered. He’s too tired for this.
Steve hummed in agreement, rocking his hips in a rhythm now. He could feel the pleasure building low in his gut, and he wanted it. He wanted to come on Tony’s knot. It always made the alpha absolutely crazy, made him rough, and Steve wanted to feel him while he was gone.
“Baby, please don’t cry,” Tony implored, looking a little panicked, and the sight of his alpha caring about him right now, the sound of Tony’s voice murmuring sweet endearments, was too much to bear. It just made him cry even harder.
“If we had more girls…” Natasha cuts in, and Tony sighs.
Xavier smiles. “I want you to consider, Captain; every other member of your team grew up in a broken home. Most of them have been involved in the military or some sort of violence since childhood.”
“Get him out of here,” Tony says, glancing at Amora. “I’ve got Cap.”
“I said everyone.”
“You’re too much,” Tony says, embarrassed now. He covers his eyes with one hand. “Go on, then.”
“’Course.”
“He left for Asgard, to help with a political matter. He won’t be back for weeks,” Steve elaborates, when the woman doesn’t seem inclined to believe them.
did the banner!! <3
There’s a war coming, Tony knows. He’s been preparing for it. There’s so much work left to do.
There’s no quantifiable reason for it, but Reed forcing his way onto the case dramatically changes Tony’s emotional landscape from dispossessed malaise to driven focus. A bit of colour returns to his cheeks. The light reappears in his eyes.
Five minutes, and he gets sick of looking at the blank monitor.
Pepper raises an eyebrow at him, but doesn't say anything else about it.
“Big,” he manages, and Tony fails to suppress a simple, male kind of grinning pride that bubbles up from somewhere caveman stupid in his otherwise highly evolved brain. “Fuck, that’s so- it just keeps
“Have you seen
Steve wants to reach out, but he doesn’t know if that’s allowed. He wants nothing more to take Tony’s face into his hands, to kiss him again. He almost wishes he hadn’t done it; now that he knows what it feels like, it’s almost impossible to resist. He settles for nodding like a fool.
He hadn’t spoken or seen Peter in months, he’d tried not to think about him too much, the idea of fate had kept him up many nights in the past couple of weeks, the fact that he had the power to decide if he didn’t want this kid and his family but he couldn’t make himself want it any less. He hated the idea that this had to happen to him, some how, someone wants to marry him, not the funny, know-it-all, millionaire student but this new him, the lonely but powerful millionaire business executive who had all the time in the world but no one he’d share it with.
Steve rolled his wrists, prepared for the worst. The high pitched squeal of the lock on the door made Steve flinch at the sound. He closed his eyes briefly, opening them to find Directors Carter, Pierce making their way in to the cell. Peggy had a sober look on her face, guilt clear as day. Steve rolled his jaw around his mouth. He was fucking piss at Peggy. She called the order on his detainment as far as he could understand. He just needed to figure out why she even called it in the first place. Time to ham up the acting!
Steve tightened his grip and so did Tony’s subconsciously with his grip on Peter. “I don’t want to hear another word about your wrong opinion of your son. Tony is my friend, he cares about my wellbeing unlike you. Tony took me to the Smithsonian after I spoke to Dugan and Morita, He showed me my mom’s recipe book, on display, He showed me that not everything was lost from my life, Did you that Howard? Of course not. You thought throwing me into a battleground would fix everything!”
“Please, get me home, I want my dad’s back, I want my home, you’re not …” Peter chocked back his tears, “You’re not you …yet, I need to go home.” Peter looked up the stairs again, “How do I do this? I might never go home, how… how did you cope with it? Never knowing if you were going to wake up?!” Peter fell back against the wall, not dropping to the floor but leaning and hiding in the shadows.
Peter woke up again in a dark room, he was in the middle of being place onto a bed, tiredness still settling in his bones, reluctant to move. His Dad’s whisper voice filled his ears “Poor kid, he’s exhausted, should we get him some tea for when he wakes up?” A soft hand gently moved his curly hair out of his face again, “Maybe, make him feel at home again? He will be glad to be back home in New York.” Peter curled around the hand that was gently petting him, he let out a mix between a hum and a sigh, relaxation setting into his bones, “Dad? Can I just sleep till tomorrow? Promise I’ll get up for school this time, promise?”
“You want Anthony don’t you.” Steve stopped let out a breath that might as well have been pure steam of rage. “What is it?” Howard asked rhetorically, “Does he remind you of a younger me is that it? Grow up Ste, you may be 25 but you are just as old as me!  He’s an idiot spoilt rotten kid and you are a decorated war veteran, a hero of our time. He’s not worth your time Ste, waste your time with some chick from a bar, not my idiot kid who idolises you.”
The loud thump of six knocks of the door echoed through the flat. Followed by a loud, “Tony, It’s your old pal Obadiah!” Tony let out a sigh and reshuffled his hoodie. He muttered to himself, “Let’s get this over with.” He shut the door behind himself, leaving Peter standing in the middle of his room with nothing to do. He decided it was time to figure out a way home, he searched around his room for his wrist band shooters and the suit. Pulling off the covers of the bed on to the floor frantically searching for them. He pulled the large pile of new clothes Tony bought for him off the chair on to the floor. Turning a full 360 degrees around, He finally looked up on the ceiling, the shooters were still attached to the blanket hanging off the light fixture, he must have climbed up with its last night. He could hear the faint polite chat between Stane and Tony, the shuffling of paper work. He pulled out the suit mask and wrist bands and sat them up right on the desk, turn to check the blinds were still shut and the door was closed, Peter turned his attention to Karen.
Peter decided that it would be best to shower and get changed for the day, start afresh with Tony when woke up from him nap. Shutting his bedroom door behind him, Peter began to strip off his clothes from the morning walk, he picked out a pair of blue jeans, a worn but fitted black crew neck jumper. Walking through to the shower room, he tried to relax his mind.
Home, something that until now, Steve hadn’t even realised he’d given up on. His Tony, was alive and well, he needed a shave but other than that he was living his life. “Tony. I thought you were dead, If I had known, I’d have come straight home! … You thought I would have left you alone?”
Natasha, crossed her arms as Peter stood up, using his Uncle as a crutch. “I owe you for that. Not Shield and certainly not Captain America. But the next time we see him, I’m not stopping. As for you, child. Don’t get in my way, I’ll kill you before he could.” She walked in the opposite direction of the alley back towards the apartment. Peter had recovered his breath, but Barton refused to let go of the kid, however, he didn’t say anything the entire way back.
work.
“Well, with a little stop at the – “Howard was cut off by Tony, “at the Pentagon, right?” He leaned over his mother shoulder to ‘whisper’ in her ear, “don’t worry you’ll love the holiday menu at the commissary.” She tried to hide her smirk at Tony’s attitude. Peter was just amazed that a man who pushed his son into a mirror, can turn around he chat politely like this. But then again, this seemed normal to everyone.
Surely, she thought, he can’t be dead, Peter was alive- Oh god, the kid! Where was he? She just stood still in the middle. Was the kid dead because Tony died? She marched over to Carter, “How do we find out what happened. Who lived? Who died? If you don’t tell me, I’m going to scene to find out.” Peggy sat up when her phone rang, she answered it, “Yes. Yes. Ok Thank ready to go in five.” She stood up to grab her coat, I need to inform the Jarvis family of the situation. You three. Orders, find him now, kill him and bring back the formula. Don’t come back till you do.” And with a sweeping throw of her coat over her shoulders she was out of the office.
and Clint marched quickly down the hallway to a locked down. Clint stepped aside, gesturing out for Steve to ‘go right ahead.’ Steve boot kicked the door off of his hinges.
“Peter, are you ok?” Steve understood now why Tony was so protective of Peter. Before Peter could answer a loud bang came from the orb, everyone in the room stepped back, the orb began to expand rapidly. “Figures are off the charts, this can’t last long!” A scientist called out to the room, Steve stood in front of Peter and Tony, trying to protect them from the expanding purple orb. Director Carter was shielded behind Coulson and Fury as the noise of the orb grew louder. With a large spark of energy, the room flashed purple.
Steve boot kicked the apartment door open, shield at the ready in front of his upper body. Natasha’s two pistols point round the outside of the shield, her arms outstretched in front of her. Tactical plan, infiltrate through the front door, scout the rooms, assess the current position of the target and determine the assassin’s target. Steve made his way through the empty apartment, shoulder pushing his way into the main bedroom. One bed, sheets covered in a thin layer of dust, A desk with one desktop computer. Recently used, the power was still on. Steve checked the bathroom, blood in the sink. No Shooter.
Before Jarvis could stop Tony reaching the door, he’d swung it open. He guessed right. Romanoff stood with a bewildered look on her face. “Holy shit you’re actually alive.” She pushed a lock of her hair out of the way of her face, Tony then realised that it was quite windy outside the mansion today. He gestured for her to follow him inside, taking her through towards Howard’s office. He called out to the kitchen as he walked by. “We will be a while Jarvis. Just clear my plate.” Opening the double doors to the office, he walked in with them, Natasha followed, her eyes wandering around the room as she made her way over to lean on the oak wooden desk. Tony slammed the doors behind him.
Tony looked away from Peggy, she was suppose to be on his side but Steve didn’t even know what was going on? He was alone for months because his aunt Peggy wanted Steve to produce the
“What happened to your wallet anyway?” Steve pulled out and handed Clint the fifty dollar bill. “Oh, nothing but why spend mine when I can get yours.” and with that Clint smirked and jogged out of the car park and down the street. Steve shook his head to himself and pulled the passenger door shut again. Left alone with his thoughts again. He shouldn’t let them wander, but he couldn’t help himself. He was heading back to his apartment, the place where his parents started their lives together and the last place Steve stayed with Tony, his stuff was going to be all over the place. Steve closed his eyes and rested his head back against the headrest.
Tony had asked him to protect the kid, Tony knew about Peter, who he was, and he made --Tony happy. But right now, this kid, was just that, he was a kid, who was as lost as he was last year when he woke up from his years in the ice. “Peter, I’m not going to say it will be ok but… I’m here, so is Tony and I promise you I will find a way to get you back home.”
Could he just forget Tony? He was never going to get him back, there’s no way to spend another decade in the ice as trade to get to Tony back. He knew himself, he’d spend the next years of his life mourning the lost of his own future, his only family. Could he just forget? To leave the pain behind. There will never be another Tony, fact. He and Tony were suppose to get married? Fact? The memories with Tony were some of the best he had. Fact. Forget the only good thing he’d experience since the 40’s. But then again, the man who wanted all that, a family, the white picket fence and the house on the corner… that man died in the ice. Is it worth it to forget Tony?
Dear Tony,
Steve wakes up the next morning late enough that sunlight is streaming through blinds he forgot to close the night before. He stretches thoroughly between his Egyptian cotton sheets (a tip from one of his LJ friends who is a self-confessed hedonist, and boy, is Steve grateful to her) and, as last night's events catch up with his sleepy brain, wonders if it all really happened. Maybe Katya will never call. Maybe it was all a spur-of-the-moment crazy notion and that'll be the end of that.
consent is sexy. look at that, something we agree on.
"Beg pardon?" he says, letting his head roll to the side to find Katya propped up on one elbow, grinning smugly as her bright green eyes trail down his body and back up again.
I keep thinking i see you out of the corner of my eye. I’m pretty sure it isn’t you. The men i see never look back at me, just keep walking like nothing’s the matter. I even thought i saw you here tonight. But the man had a dark beard and longer dark hair. Of course it wasn’t you.
"Well," she drawls in that deliciously dark, purring accent of hers. "The girls were right. I know we didn't exactly negotiate prices, but boy, you are worth every cent you charge. Will six hundred do?"
"Maybe I can try to find out," Steve says slowly. Stacker is pretty high up the foodchain. He might have heard a thing or two.
. When he finishes the sixth book, Steve puts it down gently, and then goes and takes a long shower, trying to convince himself that he should stop crying, it's not that bad. He goes out to the store and buys eight pints of Ben & Jerry's, which, as far as he's concerned, goes a long way towards making this era a good one to be alive in. He eats two of them before he goes to bed, and clutches at one of the pillows he bought last week, and tries desperately not to ache at the memory of Doc Erskine, and Peggy, and all the people he lost. He decides to take a break before he tackles book seven. The way the emotional wringer has been tightening over the books, he thinks it might be a good idea to try and get some distance from it for a little while.
Phil whimpers quietly in Steve's ear. "And here I thought I had a quiet evening at home to look forward to," he says wistfully.
"Shit, let me catch my breath," Tony mutters, pushing himself off Steve with what looks like a Herculean effort and walking around his desk to press at a panel on the wall. "I'm not a young man anymore, I gotta pace myself." It slides open to reveal a box of condoms, several bottles of lube, and an assortment of sex toys Steve has never seen in one place despite his activities this past year.
"Hmm," Phil says. "Can I ask what's brought this on?"
"Oh," Steve says, trying and probably failing to hide his relief. "Well, that's fine, maybe some other—"
"What?" he rasps, rubbing his eyes with one hand. "Did something explode?"
Phil's hands are everywhere, stroking over Steve's neck, down his shoulders, over his sides. Phil sets up a languid roll of his hips that makes his chest slide against Steve's, and Christ, all that
"And I think very highly of Phil," Steve replies.
"No. I don't want that."
The thing is that, for a while now, Phil has been not-so-subtly pushing him to find someone to see, on whatever basis it worked for Steve. It was him that balked every time. But – he'd promised himself that he'd start taking risks again, hadn't he? If he ever wants to start dating someone for real, he needs to learn how to talk about himself beyond what art medium he prefers and how he takes his coffee.
"Promise me no speeches," Steve hisses desperately. Tony looks obnoxiously smug. It's a fifty-fifty toss between Steve wanting to punch him and kiss him stupid.
Steve shifts under the scrutiny. Sam smiles and changes the subject to the movie they're about to watch, so he's good enough to recognise closed and/or uncomfortable body language. He wouldn't be a good therapist if he didn't, but it always used to surprise Steve how many of the so-called mental health professionals went into a case thinking they knew all about the patient and expecting to have their preliminary diagnosis confirmed; which, in Steve's opinion, was a bunch of baloney and irritated the shit out of him. It may or may not've been one reason he wouldn't talk to the SHIELD shrinks beyond surface facts.
"I think flying commercial will drive you up the wall," Phil says measuredly. "But we could make it work, if you had your heart set on it."
, erudite and knowledgeable on so many subjects, it makes Steve's cheeks hot. He wouldn't have supposed Tony to know about hand-blown glass, for example, and yet he had been treated to a ten minute walk through the process, complete with some very interesting hand gestures. The mercurial shifts of topic leave Steve in a strangely meditative mood, simply following along where Tony's mind chooses to lead them, content in the moment even when Tony proceeds to lambaste a particularly unpleasant example of woodcarving. It is with some surprise that Steve hears his stomach growling and realises three hours have passed in aimless exploration of the many pretty things in the store. Steve knows that it will become a favourite haunt on the strength of their scented candles alone.
"Shit," Tony mutters, while Steve leans closer to the holo hovering in the air before them.
you, and unless you're hiding a deranged serial killer behind that pretty smile, there aren't too many things that would be a dealbreaker. Just don't lie to me, and we're sparking."
we don’t have to if you’d rather not.
Clint freezes, mouth dropping open. Phil observes him for a second, then gets up to walk across the room and into Clint's space. Clint stares up at him, caught in someone else's crosshairs for a change and, surprisingly, looking quite happy to be there.
The art store owner is a charming middle-aged South-Asian woman who looks him up and down and immediately hands him a leaflet for a life drawing class. He's flattered, and a little amazed, that she could tell he's an artist just by looking at him, and tells her so.
"I'm afraid it has the better of me, ma'am," Steve says sheepishly. He can't understand what is so special about a line and a dot.
The bartender is looking at him strangely – or, it seems strange, until he works out that the guy is staring at his lower lip. Steve licks it purposefully, and the bartender blinks.
...But, why the hell not? Steve is all about new experiences these days, and he enjoys meeting new people, getting drawn into strange conversations that dash off on myriad tangents. And the sex, well. He's already established he enjoys
Holy wow, Steve thinks faintly as his dick stirs in his tailored pants. Would he be down for that. Heh,
"You know, you're not at all how I thought you'd be," Steve muses, eyeing up a potential dining venue. It's on the small side, with checkered tablecloths and white wooden chairs, but most of the tables are full and the smell of marinara sauce wafting through the open doors is irresistible.
ur in public ull b fine
yeah. we have a date. :)
A small movement brings his gaze to Tony, standing a little to the side, not quite between him and the agents. The look on his face is strangely defiant as he stares them down; but as if he senses Steve's attention, he turns and his expression immediately shifts. There's something comforting in it, an unending river of support telling him that Tony will stand beside him in whatever he chooses. Through the months they've been together, Tony has told him in so many ways that Steve is the man he loves, and that Cap is a part of him, not the other way around. He can do this, if he chooses. He can become the symbol again, even if just for a little while - time enough to do the job, then step into the shadows again.
ATTA BOY
"Is that Barton?" Steve demands. "Tell him about our arrangement up front, okay, don't screw this up for yourself."
'Kid.' Jesus. This Stark is something else.
He files the revelations of the day away, to be taken out and examined after he's finished doing his job. Which, bearing in mind Tony is looking close to the end of his tether, appears to include distraction. He nods when Phil catches his eye from across the room. He's got this.
Sam kicks him again. Steve glares at him.
Thank god for hidden balconies. Sure it’s freezing out here, but that just means noone else will want to intrude on my place.
"Oh my god, Jarvis has a more stringent moral code than you, this is amazing." He's safe. (He isn't sure if that's a relief or not, is the rub.)
also hot
The noise he makes is on the wrong side of obscene, but Shawn seems to like that, kissing him harder before he drags him around the corner and into the bedroom. Shawn heads straight for the bedside lamp and flicks it on, before pushing his own jeans down his legs. His dick springs out, thick and heavy and curving to the left a little, and Steve's mouth
Tony's eyes sparkle with the challenge Steve absolutely intended.
Coulson looks down. Steve hasn't known the man long, but it strikes him as uncharacteristic.
Natalie stares at him for a moment, then throws her head back with laughter.
"You look very familiar, young man," an elderly lady standing across from him says. She leans on her cane to peer more closely at him. "Have you been in one of those promotional television campaigns?"
Tony looks like he's chewing on words that Steve knows are going to be a punch in the gut.
"This complicates things," Phil muses, turning towards an old-fashioned drawing board - probably to keep their operation offline. "If we have to keep the military out as well as HYDRA…"
"Traffic was good. Plus, I had incentive to rush a little." He smiles at Pentecost, making it open and full of intent.
"Yeah, uh huh. And how d'you think I got here, kid?"
"It's not your fault. Besides, they're right. I am a fossil. The modern world is… Well, it's going to take some getting used to. But, uh, if it's okay, I'll keep your number, too. In case of emergencies."
Steve smiles at him. He knows he looks fine. He spent enough time on his appearance this evening to rival even the UN New Year's Ball that Katya had taken him to last year. Steve has never been particularly vain – you couldn't really, when the world was determined to knock the little guy down to where he belonged – but he couldn't deny that it felt pretty awesome to be the subject of that frank, appreciative gaze.
"Always so dramatic," Phil murmurs, and it startles a laugh out of Steve for real.
"Then you haven't been paying attention. Did you realise you never asked me to keep tabs on you when you were out with him? You trusted him from the start, even when you knew nothing about him but his name. Also, and don't jump down my throat, but he's an asshole and you have a type."
Five minutes later, Steve is alone in his new apartment. He looks at the worn carpet, the squishy couch that seems close to his own age, the bare bookshelves, the desk tucked away in the corner.
i kno were kinda new
"Now, Steve. You know that I know that you liked all those things, and it just seemed silly not to buy them."
Tony Stark referring to something as 'snooty' is not something Steve wants to forget anytime soon.
"Mhm. Considering that's an original Lichtenstein, and over there you've got a Leonardo drawing sitting in plain sight, your attempt at modesty is dead in the water."
Tony pouts. "Don't get too close to Agent, he'd taze you and then I'll be the one carrying you out maiden-style."
He tries not to think about it too often lest he jinxes it, but by the time a month goes past with no contact with Pentecost, Steve has given up hope of ever hearing from him again. Which is, of course, when his phone rings late one afternoon, 'withheld' flashing across the screen.
Never let it be said that Steve isn't good at following orders.
"Thank you, Sam," he says, doing his best to breathe through the lump in his throat that's big enough to choke on.
There’s just no one. They’re – you’re – all gone.
Sam throws his head back and laughs and laughs – which is actually hilarious, because the joke's on him and Steve tells him so.
Tony's head whips around, eyes dark and wide. "Why, Sergeant, you don't beat around the bush," he murmurs, licking his lower lip.
"Care to enlighten me on how you figure that?" Tony asks, hope stealing in at the edges.
I still really, REALLY hate that it’s gone. There’s a ball of dread thick in my gut that doesn’t let me relax. I’m sitting here waiting for the other shoe to drop. You’d think I’d be used to it by now, but I’m not. I’m really not.
"So why did you?" Steve asks, genuinely curious.
. Then General Okoye graciously accompanied me to dinner. Do you know how wonderfully strange it is to walk around without spotting a single landmark of global capitalism? No McDonalds. No Starbucks. Burger King, Dunkin Donuts? Forget about it. All the food is ridiculously fresh, locally grown in the land or in some kind of adapted greenhouses. And there's so much of it! To a guy from pre-war Brooklyn, it's a little overwhelming. Not even the modern New York can compare with walking the edges of the city and seeing whole fields of vegetables, enough to feed the entire nation if needs be.
"Likewise, JARVIS," Steve replies, folding his hands behind his back into a loose parade rest by force of habit. "Tony."
with him? He should call back and cancel.
"You're such a charmer," Steve deadpans. Tony grins at him, wagging his eyebrows. Ugh, why is Steve attracted to him?
Perhaps there has been a security breach on your private server, because I received a large number of emails this morning addressed to me, which seem to have been sent by mistake.
starmichaeltrinion: dude you should TTLY GO FOR THAT
I find myself daydreaming like I did when I was a boy and I liked someone. Will you call? Will I see you? Will you forgive me and be my friend again? Even in my daydreams, I can’t hope for anything more. I should stop letting myself have them anyway. If wishes were horses, huh? But I can’t stop. Even when I try not to, I still see your face everywhere. It’ll be a thousand times worse when I make it States-side. At least in Wakanda, I knew I wouldn’t see you somewhere on the street. I could trust in that, day after day.
"I'll give you a few for testing, if you like. Or, you can come back here, and we'll try 'em all."
"I promise, Sergeant Rogers, that I will not let him make a speech."
"Sir," Steve amends, hearing his voice go high-pitched and wrecked. Well. He guesses he'll add that to the list of things he's discovering about himself. "Sir, please, I got ready for you, you can just fuck me."
He lets himself grin as he leads the way to the cash registers, relieved when Tony waits calmly for him to pay instead of waving his card around like Steve questioned his manhood. Tony follows him down the street, moving the conversation to cars and the petty yet undeniable pleasure of watching a super-expensive Lamborghini trying to navigate a speed bump. Steve snickers, helpless to stop himself. Tony has a way with words, painting a picture that somehow manages to transmit all of the languid, decadent enjoyment of the summer day in Italy when it had happened.
Peter woke up in his room, a broom handle poking his sides. “Peter, wake up, you need to get up now, Obi is coming over.” Peter grumbled, he rolled over on his other side. “Why, he doesn’t even like me, can’t you leave me to sleep like a normal person.” Tony let out a sharp laugh, “Normal people can’t fall asleep on the ceiling. But yeah normal average kid.” Peter’s eye shot open. Sat up, right angled to the floor. He stood up on the ceiling, placing his right hand in the grip position he lowered the rest of his body off of the ceiling, until he was the right way up and dropped gently to the floor. “Uh, sorry, I’m up now. Do I need to help tidy anything?” Tony laughed and turned to walk out the room, “Nope, just needed you off the ceiling in case he got nosey again. Steve usually just stands at the end of the hallway and keep him in the kitchen but he’s just nosey.”
When Tony had finally calmed down, he walked back over to the kitchen and began to prepare an old family recipe for Italian pasta. Well, the Jarvis family recipe but Tony was allowed to know it. Peter just stood and watched Tony’s expressionless face as he chopped large tomatoes. Tony didn’t look up at Peter but he could see the gleam of tears in his Dad’s eyes, held back behind the Stark bravado.
“Cool, glad we have a big family rather than a tiny one, it’s just me, Howard and mom, well, and Jarvis cause he checks up on me more than my mom does so he should count.” Tony turned around to lean against the counter as Peter placed the casserole dish into the oven and set the timer. Tony pushed himself off and headed down the hallway to his room, “guess it’s time to ask the question, how did you get here? What were the events that placed you here?” Tony called out from down the hall. Peter panicked, how do you explain to your Dad who isn’t your Dad yet that he is superhero just like his Pops, along with two super spies, a Norse God, an irradiated scientist, his digital butler gone sentient and a witch who….yeah where do you even start to explain that to a guy whose only concerned with his PHD just now.
Tony heard footsteps outside the door, rolling out of bed. He gently snuck around the bottom of the bed, his sock covered feet helping silence his footsteps. Placing his hands carefully on either side of the peep-hole, Tony leaned forward to gaze through. He shot back in fear at a gentle knock. Tony, stepped back, quietly, he opened the door. It took him a few seconds to decide to open the door. It was his Aunt Peggy.
‘freaky how science creates him in so few years.’
Peter sat up, he felt powerful and exhausted at the same time. He focused on the final image of his Pops, paused at the end. His gentle smile, he’d been sitting in his Art studio, Peter spotted himself on the couch, covered in a torn spider suit and bandages, he’d just come back from a building fire, he remembers the burns and their pain, he was asleep in the background.
“I told him to leave.” She sat up straight, crossing her legs and gripping each end of the chair. “He knew it was going to happen. Peter, he just sat by and told me I should say goodbye, I didn’t realise why until Peggy told me and he just… he just sat there, he couldn’t even look at me.” He drank again. Natasha gripped the chair a little tighter. “Do you blame him?” Tony rolled his shoulders, he hadn’t made up his mind yet, On the one hand, he didn’t truly believe Peter knew the entire time he was here that his parents were going to die. Part of Tony’s thinking process was that he just couldn’t talk about his parent’s deaths at least 20 years on. He’d gotten married, had a kid and still couldn’t talk about that day. On the other hand, had he just sent his son to 1991, he maybe never knew this was going to happen. But Peter made the decision to not tell him. It still hurt.
His thoughts made him fall behind, he ran along the cat walk, leaping over the edge, he swung on the overhead piping, to land on a lower level of the cat walk. Bow drawn again, to watch over Steve.
Tony, he’d met
Even Romanoff opened her mouth slightly in a gasp, quickly looking towards Clint, who turned his own head back to her, he didn’t know how this was going to go down. “You asked me to protect Tony, when he’s in danger right now… and so is Howard. Where are they now?!” Steve stood up straight, hands gripping the centre of his belt. “Howard is an hour out. He’s just landed in DC, he will drive over here, drop it off, pick up another security detail and then hide in one of his many islands, as far as I know Tony is with his family.” Steve shook his head repeatedly. “Put me on security detail, now.”
Steve walked over the metal gate that was connected to the gauntlet, waiting for the gauntlet to spark once again. “Good luck Captain.” He gave a nod to his team and turned towards the anomaly. Taking a deep breath, clutching tightly at the straps of his shield, he stepped through.
Things were calm now. The bodies of the dead had been removed, the stains cleaned. The smell of antiseptic was maddening, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to leave. It still didn’t feel real. He still felt like he was going to wake up at any moment. Tony took a long gulp of his too hot coffee. The glass of the holding cell was one way. He could see in but they couldn’t see out. He’d been standing there for nearly an hour, just watching. Steve was asleep. The kid was smushed next to him. They were on the floor, despite there being beds in the cell. It only occurred to him after the fact that this might be exactly what the two had escaped from.
“ No, my boss is a lawyer. A good one. Steve got off innocent.”
“You want to keep living like this? Or do you want power?” Tony asked, annoyed. Behind him he heard Steve get up and walk over to him.  “We shouldn’t have left New York.” Tony grumped, squirming away when Steve dropped a hand on his tense shoulders. It was too hot for affection. When Steve pulled away completely to go back to the kitchen, Tony turned fully from the generator to look at his face, worried he might of started a fight-
“What, Kid? Don’t you want to be called something else?” She didn’t answer him. She kept her knees pulled up to her chest. “Do you have anything to eat?” he couldn’t help but ask the question. To his surprise, she nodded. She moved to the far back corner of the room, next to the toilet. She pushed on the wall, something he hadn’t even thought to to.A compartment opened, no bigger than a foot all around. Something clattered down inside. She came back to him with brown speckled blocks that looked more like sponges than anything.
Tony lost sight of them when Steve dropped to the ground in front of him, and Tony nearly chocked on the popsicle in his mouth when he moaned. Steve didn’t waste any time, he doesn’t even pull Tony’s pats down all the way before he takes Tony all the way into his mouth. The why of that is immediate. Tony has to shove his hands into Steve’s hair and pull hard to refrain from jerking forward. Steve’s mouth is
A slat in the wall opened up and a tray of food pushed through. He rushed for it, he hadn’t eaten anything since he’d arrived. It wasn’t a lot, a sandwich made only of bread and cheese. The way the kid was staring at him he could only guess she was about as hungry as he was. He offered it to her. She shook her head. Shrugging, Steve took a bite, but before he could eat any more the tray shot out of his hands and hit the wall.
Deciding that enough was enough, Tony got up. He needed food and the Denny’s around the corner was open twenty four hours. As there was nothing more entertaining that the crowd Denny's drew at midnight, it would be the perfect pick me up.
“That’s a shame,” Tony couldn’t help but say aloud. Steve, in his grogginess, nearly turnd around a socked Tony a new one.
“If you’re looking for another hummer you’re gonna have to look somewhere else-“ Clint jumped into the pool and let himself sink, Tony was left to just stand there indignantly.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, I’ll clean it up-“ came a second voice, an incredibly familiar voice. Tony perked up in his booth, trying to see into the kitchen through the service window.
angry, he could feel it, it was heavy and suppressing, and away was the urge to vomit. It was replaced by a new urge. Steve wanted to hurt the man in the white coat, he wanted to make him feel what he was feeling all because-
“ Yes, thank you I-I’ll get the money to you by the end of the night. I’ve got to get back before Tony gets to the office but-” She stood, the thought of not being there when tony arrived was nerve wracking. She was never late. He’d know in an instant that something was up it happened out of the blue. “ This needs to stay under wraps. Keep it as safe as you can, and call me as soon as you have this Bucky guy. I want to talk to him myself.”
It was dark in the apartment, Pepper had the feeling it was because the power had been shut off. The man sitting in front of her didn’t exactly seem to be like the type to care much, though. His hair was too long, and he was unshaven. He was missing an arm-there was a prosthetic in the corner by the bed, and for a moment Pepper almost felt bad for waking him up.
“You might have to stick around so I can fix her.” Tony hadn’t even realized the low tone of his voice until Steve was looking at him, wide eyed, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, face cast in the red glow of the traffic light. Boy was that a pretty picture.
Morgan gasped. They were calling her name. She didn't know what to do! Does she run away?
When he’s done he more or less collapses onto the floor, pulling Steve down with him, kissing him thoroughly. It’s not as round or dirty as the ones before, but it didn’t need to be. Steve hadn’t even opened his eyes yet.  They just sit like that for a bit, more or less sprawled in a heap on the floor, leaning against the wall and one another, catching their breaths.
"We need you to take us there." Natasha said. Her voice was soft, but firm. "Not only so we can get the information on the Kid, but also so we can try and figure out who these people are in the first place. We can't just let this go. Not investigating this now could only lead to more...incidents like this one."
“ I still owe you, don’t I?” He asked, and Tony moaned aloud when Steve dipped his head low and swirled his tongue around his belly button. Without warning he took him all the way into his mouth, and Tony bucked his hips up. Steve stayed still, and Tony moved his hips experimentally, thrusting up into Steve’s mouth. Steve looked up at him, those blue eyes searing, and Tony couldn’t help it. He fucked up into Steve’s mouth, over and over and over, and Steve just laid there, adjusting his position every now and then, keeping his jaw relaxed and his eyes on Tony. He moaned when Tony came, pulling back before he was finished-Tony wasn’t sure weather it was an accident or not, but the sight of Steve with his face messy was something he’d put away for the jack off files in his mind. Not that he’d needed those lately.
“I’m gonna come in you Tones. It’s gonna be a big load, it’s gonna fill you up. Two and a half weeks, babe, all of that just dremching the inside of your ass. You’ll be full. You won’t be able to move without me dripping out of you.”
"I'm sorry," Tony said, simply, too quietly. He grabbed a sandwich half and was out of the kitchen before Steve could blink, let alone respond. He was left there to finish putting together the last sandwich on his own.
“ No, no he just seems...off is all, Tony. I don’t want you getting hurt. There’s just something about him that doesn’t sit right with me.” Pepper said, earnestly. “ I mean, he goes out and half the time you don’t even know where he is. Didn’t you tell me you caught him coming in late a few weeks back?”
“I wanted you to know what it’s like.”
“ I love you, you know that?” He says, and it sort of too much. Tony still feels like he doesn’t deserve to hear it, not really, but Steve thinks that he does. He says it all the time.
He breathed, taking Tony in, drinking in the sight of him with his hands in his pants.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have talked like that.” She’d been hurt and it was his fault. He knew what they did to her. Every single cut, every single zap with the prod they’d given him, they’d given her too. All because he wouldn’t talk. He still wouldn’t. For the first time, Steve looked the kid up and down. She’s propped herself against the wall. Most of her wounds were dressed, but many had already bled though bandages. They didn’t look like they’d been changed in days. How long had he been out?
Steve looked between the two of them. They were right, it was obvious they were right. That didn't mean he'd have to like it.
Tony also decided he’d have to say no to Steve a little more often.
Pepper was running late. Pepper never ran late. That was enough to make Tony worry right there. He paced his office, muttering curses, trying to organize files and make sure he had the correct documents in his briefcase for the consultation that was scheduled for fifteen minutes  from just then. He’d managed to dab a bit of concealer on the light bruise of his eye. It wasn’t as bad as he thought it’d be, but the bruise made him feel guilty all the same. He should've known not to press like that. He hated when he had to deal with it himself. He'd wanted to apologize again, but it didn't seem there was any time for it. Steve had left around the same time he’d gone up to the office, not before kissing him and telling him that he loved him. Tony was positive Steve telling him he loved him was the one thing he’d never get tired of hearing.
“ I love you,” Steve huffed, along with a loud moan, and then Tony’s thighs were sticky but he didn’t care, he was turning over and pressing Steve into the mattress and kissing him, kissing him with every single bit of life he had.
Steve set Tony’s tablet back down where it was and moved to unlock the door. He laid back down on his side of the bed and closed his eyes, thinking. There were a lot of things he hadn’t told Tony. A lot of things-besides the obvious. Maybe if he started talking Tony would be less compelled to feel the need to look after him. Or it would get worse. Either way, Steve had to talk to him. He couldn’t keep the things he'd done from Tony for long- it was classified , it couldn’t be found on the internet, sure, but Steve had been terrified None the less. Especially when  the trial started and articles were written about him, he was terrified that somebody somewhere would dig up information on the Howling Commandos-he would’ve been done for. But they didn’t, and he wasn’t, and now he’d have to tell Tony.
The voice was so familiar. She can't remember where she heard it last.
“Wanted to save it all up for you. Two and a half weeks…” Steve shook his head a little, looking directly into Tony’s eyes.
Steve didn’t miss the disapproving note in her voice, and didn’t say anything as he entered the office and closed the door behind him. Tony was on the phone, so Steve didn’t say anything. He just put his hands in his pockets and walked around the room, letting Tony’s voice wash over him. He moved from one framed piece of artwork to the next that adorned the walls of Tony’s office, studying them as if it were his first time seeing them rather than the hundredth.
“Shit,” Steve huffed, and only then Tony realized he had to be putting on quite a show. A bead of pre come appeared on Steve’s dick, and Tony lapped it up, sucking the head into his mouth, never breaking eye contact. Steve’s hands were suddenly in his hair, tugging lightly, and Tony really went to work. He swirled his tongue around the head as he ground into the seat, getting closer and closer to his own release as he took Steve as far as he could go. The zipper of Steve’s work pants bumped against his nose. He hummed and sucked hard, feeling light headed as he gave one final roll of his hips down into the seat and came right there, with Steve’s dick in his mouth. He pulled off with a groan, just in time to catch Steve’s load on his face. Before he could do anything Steve was pulling him up, and god, he was strong. Tony felt like putty as Steve kissed him, but not before licking himself from Tony’s lips and around his mouth. After one more kiss Steve took off his shirt and used it to wipe Tony’s face as clean as he could, and Tony let him, hands wandering over the now bare chest as he did his best to find the ability to speak. The windows of the truck were fogged over, and Steve’s chest was still heaving, and Tony was proud. He’d done that.
As it turned out, Steve had no gag reflex. Tony knew this because all at once his entire cock was in that mouth, Steve’s nose bumped his pelvis and Tony’s hips bucked of their own accord. Before he could apologize Steve was sucking hard, and he was done. It was game over. Tony came, and Steve just kept sucking as hard as ever until Tony started to squirm with the sensitivity of it. There was a rustling as Steve got back up on his feet and kissed him again. Tony could taste himself on him.
“Hey,” Steve protests, “no, Tony-”
“Oh, now he tunes back in,” War Machine snipes, sounding more relieved than irritated.
They drive in silence for a while as Pepper processes this. Tony doesn’t mind. If he is grateful for anything in his life, it is the fact that his relationship with Pepper has maintained this comfort, that he can sit with her without the stifling instinct to babble. He enjoys driving. When he looks over after a mile or so, she has a thoughtful expression on her face.
"Sure you are,” Tony says, and holds his breath as Steve leans down closer, enough that he can feel his breath on his face.
It’s a long drive back to the tower.
“Yeah,” Steve said. No use in denying it. “I can’t…I can’t sleep in the penthouse. It’s too much.”
Steve leans over and turns off the tap, then begins the slow process of stirring the salt into the water.
“Tony,” Steve said, stepping forward. He grabbed one of Tony’s waving hands, pressing his fingers to the scarred knuckles. He waited until Tony stilled, met his eyes. “You’re the strongest person I know.”
You’ll notice that the chapter tally has jumped again. Sorry about that! It’s taking longer to get through these big plot points than I thought it would. I may have overstepped myself and gotten kinda crazy with how many plates I’ve got in the air in this fic, so it’s definitely gonna be longer. Hopefully that pleases some people? I mean, that means more story? Right? >___>”
It was a strange juxtaposition to now, knowing mothers and old men he’d never met have mourned his passing. He’s read countless of his own eulogies. He’s woken up in a body he thought should be dead three times over more times than he knows, which is truly saying something. It isn’t like a good Catholic boy to take miracles for granted.
Steve blinked his eyes open, breath stuttering in his throat. That had been happening, too; minutes where he lost himself, trapped in a fugue.
And that's a wrap! I struggled a lot with the ending for this one, and I'm still not sure if I'm happy with it. Meh. C'est la vie.
“Steve?”
“The day after Happy died, I woke up and I thought, Oh. So this is the rest of my life,” she whispers. It is barely loud enough for Steve to be able to pick up on it even with his superhearing, and for a moment he is deeply ashamed of himself for listening in. Tony stiffens visibly in her arms. “It’ll get better, Tones. I promise.”
“Again?” Bucky sounds equal parts tired and unsurprised. Steve’s chest aches.
Tony screwed his face up, sipping petulantly at his coffee. “That’s stupid.”
Steve just hummed, pressing a soft kiss to the skin there. Tony was warm, his fingers curling through his hair, and Steve was going to have to share him, tomorrow.
Still, as he watches Loki meet Natasha blow for blow, nearly pinning her twice, he decides that the biggest difference was that Loki was just that much smarter than his brother. Those flashes of knowledge suggested something so profoundly ageless that it was beyond human ken, even for someone like Tony. Sure, Tony was a genius, but no matter how quick he was, nothing could really compensate for thousands of years of experience. So while Thor was strong enough to knock any human out with a single OP blow to the head, it was Loki’s bladework and swift, economical movements that truly betrayed his inhumanity. He seemed to know Natasha’s moves even before she could make them. It wasn’t until Loki had won two sparring sessions, however, that Tony realised that he was
“Winner’s prize,” he drawled, and Steve felt himself flush bright and obvious. “Isn’t that right, pretty omega?”
“Where’d you go?” Tony persists, and Steve huffs a sigh.
“Do I need to?” Natasha asks him, and Tony smiles thinly at her. “I didn’t think so.”
If he could feel his heartbeat, he knows it would be thundering a mile a minute. Instead, all he can hear is the faint whine of servos as Tony leans down, still mostly covered by the suit. He hears the clank as Tony braces a hand on the metal side of the chamber, and then his breath, coming closer. Closer.
“I need to feel you,” Steve says, a shuddering breath escaping him. He runs his fingertips over the nano-housing, then trails them down Tony’s stomach, ghosting over his cock. “I need…I don’t care who’s on top, but I need…”
“He said he wants to be a good soulmate,” Tony grumbles, his lip curling into a sneer. “I tried telling him he wasn’t obligated and he got angry. Then he hid in the gym, like always. I’d tell him to move in there if he didn’t mysteriously disappear every time I need to use it.”
“Seconded,” Tony says, a triumphant grin on his face. Steve can feel how hot his face is, his whole body thrumming with it. Then Tony twists, unexpected, and pokes Steve right in the ticklish spot on his ribs.
“It’s good,” Steve whispered, shaking his head. “You’re so fucking good, I just- I love you, Tony,
“I can’t,” Tony says, because they’ve had this conversation before. They’re trying to undo everything that Thanos did, and that means the hope that Pepper and Peter and Happy and everyone can come back. “I…we were talking about
. Steve forgot, sometimes, how alien the man was. He forgot how little he knew.
. You’re talking like I can’t do what you’re proposing, but I
Tony has nothing to say to that, so instead he reaches out and picks up the discarded bottle of lubricant, taking Steve’s hand in his and pouring a generous amount over his fingers. Steve watches with half-lidded eyes, and Tony eyes his cock with a speculative expression.
Steve called out to his son, “Fallback Peter! This is too dangerous!” Peter shook out the nerves from his arms and neck, preparing to run towards his dads. The Gauntlet sparked the ground directly in front of Peter. Peter caught off guard fell back a step. Deciding not to waste any more time, he leaped into the air and ran along the ceiling gripping his mask between his hands. Dropping down behind his Pops and calling the elevator down to the lab. Steve twisted his bad arm to make sure his son was safely behind him. Peter realized that his Pops was still wearing his pajamas, barefoot and ready to fight in an instant, ready to protect with his shield. His vibranium shield.  OH SHIT!
Tony became aware of himself as he watched the bathroom door shut with a chuckling Steve, clearly back from his run with Peter as he was drenched in sweat. Tony reached down to continue getting dressed, as he pulled the polo shirt over his head, Tony panicked as to where his notes on the possible time machine idea he had created had gone, quickly surveying the room he spotted the notes neatly stacked in order on the carved wooden desk.
--------
The couple turned and made their way into their home, Mrs Stark pulled off her gloves and place her sunglasses on top of her head, “Tony, I’m glad your home. How are you?” She immediately made her way over to her son, taking his face in her cold hands, her gentle touch breaking Tony’s frown, “I’m fine Ma, how was your trip over?” He watched her face closely as he removed her hand, “It was fairly good, your father insists on driving as if we are elderly old hags, honestly we would have been here an hour ago if he had actually taken the new freeway!” Tony let out a gentle laugh for his mother. She reached down to pull down his T-shirt further down his body.
A Stark pillow fort was not something to messed with. Peter remembers the first time he and his dads built a fort. He had come home from a sleepover at Ned’s house with a bunch of his friends from school. Peter had explained to his dad’s in detail about how cool their blanket fort was. It neatly fit into the small space of Ned’s bedroom using two chairs to hold up the roof. Peter at the time mistook his dad’s disgust at the level of skill as excitement and before Peter could finish telling his story his Dad was already on plans A through G, on how to show Peter the coolest pillow fort in the world.
Glancing around himself, Steve glanced up to the lighting catwalks above him. Clint was perched on the railing, arrow at the ready and aimed at the power breaker above his head. He nodded. three, two, one. The room went dark, Steve thrusted his fist forward, shattering the glass of the display case, grabbing the transmitter, he quickly turned into the crowd of people rushing towards the exits, hearing the confused screams of the public and the security guards calling for backup was slightly overwhelming, he tried to just focus on the person in front of him, checking behind him quickly, he couldn’t see Clint anywhere, so he calmly followed the crowd out on to the main street. Making his way through the crowd, he kept his head down and took a couple of alleys back to the truck at the multi-storey car park.
Left with his own thoughts again, Tony focused on the digital black clock on his desk. When the clock ticked over to four am, Tony snuck out of his bed. He slowly opened the door, stepping carefully across the hallway. He carefully turned the doorknob into Steve’s room and shut it behind him. He turned on the bedside lamp.
“Night Dad.” Tony froze for a second before giving Peter a soft smile and walking through to his room. Peter groaned at his own actions, he was such a dipshit. He fell back on the bed with his hands covering his face in embarrassment. The dust flew up off the pillows and sheets. Peter groaned again.
Tony’s date actually had gone well in his books, his date was good looking, handsome, not quite a full arse hole but acceptable for the Stark family tree to accept, but the entire time he sat across from Justin ‘sour face’ Hammer, he just couldn’t help but feel the pressure to decide who Peter’s dad was? It could have been the guy across from him, but he actually couldn’t stand him! But Tony just decided to at least give the guy a second date. Tony remembered the moment why he stopped liking Hammer.
“Go out with me.” Wow. He really knew how to woo ‘em. “I like you,” He added, hating how it was all playing out, eyes darting away from Steve’s face when he turned to look at Tony.
“ Not hungry.”
Tony was pulled from the depressing thought by the blast of the whistle. He watched as Steve stood and pointed at a few boys roughhousing in the deep end. The boys dispersed, and Steve sat back down. He looked over in Tony’s direction, and Tony hurriedly snapped back to his book. A kid jumped into the pool, splashing Tony and just about every body else in a ten foot radius. Tony stood, cursing under his breath. He pulled his chair away from the pool muttering all the while. He could’ve been home. At his own pool, away from the filth and the crowd of the community pool, but he just had to give in to the stupid desire to see Steve Rogers sitting up on that chair like some kind of work of art. Pitiful, he was pitiful and ridiculous and-
“Yeah, I’m finished!” he said, walking after her feeling lighter than air.
“Oh, look at you.” Maria Stark rushed over to him, slinging a bag off her shoulders and taking his face in her hands. There were tears in her eyes, but she was smiling.
“Oh yeah. It’s working.” Steve went on, pushing the last bit of the popsicle in his mouth and pulling Tony into a bruising kiss. His mouth was sweet, the lat bit of unmelted popsicle residing there. At least until he pushed it into Tony’s mouth with his tongue. A shiver went through Tony’s body at the burst of chill and sweet flavor ran over his tongue, making his dick twitch hard in his pants. Steve huffed a cool laugh in his face, his eyes were way too bright.
“What happened to your eye?” She asked, almost as if she’d read his mind.
“Am I losing it? Oh my god I’m losing it, I can’t — are you really standing there?”
“So you’ve said. I just don’t like leaving messes.” Steve said, turning back to the sink to finish the dishes. Tony frowned, sliding off the counter to walk around Steve's side so he could look him in the face.
“ I can’t hear you, you need to speak clearly. ‘I won’t hit my kids’ It’s not hard to say, It’s kinda common sense, really.” Steve said, holding the guy further away from him. He’d loved the shirt he was wearing until the asshole had bled all over it.
“It’s kinda hot in here. Might wanna fix those generators before we do that again.” Tony laughed and smacked Steve’s arm, but he sat up anyway.
“I don’t see why you have to do this every morning.” Tony groaned, pulling a pillow over his head as Steve walked around the room to get dressed for his run. Things had gone well. There had been a first date, then a second, and a third and a fourth. Around the sixth Steve finally agreed to come home with him. Sex with Steve was nothing he’d ever experienced. It was always so focused, no matter how fast or slow they went, like Steve’s only intention was to get Tony off, like that was the whole point of it for him-and Tony couldn’t complain, he’d never had a partner make him feel better. He was getting antsy just thinking about it, so he put it out of his mind and sat up. “Really Steve, can’t you just sleep? Like a normal person?”
“It looks like it hurts,” Tony said, a little crease of worry appearing on his forehead. Steve sighed and grabbed Tony’s hand as he lifted it to touch his face again.  He pulled him close and wrapped an arms around him.
"I know." he said, chewing the inside of his cheek as he thought. "I just don't see another way."
That’s what sends Tony over.  He thrusts hard one more time, pressing Steve forward into the wall, shoving him into his own mess and dumping his own deep in Steve’s ass.
“ You’re going to kill her,” He breathed. “She’s a child.”
“What’s going on here?” Tony asked, getting on eye level with the still half hard, brick red member.
“Hm?” Steve just took a bite of the popsicle and raised a brow as if Tony couldn’t see that he was half hard under the stupid Target cargo shorts he was wearing. (Steve refused to let Tony take him anywhere a t shirt cost more than 5 dollars.)
“You’re doing it again,” He said, putting one hand on the base of Stark Tower, leaning over to throw up. She stuck to him like a magnet, but didn’t touch his skin. He finished vomiting, and he took her hand again. They stood outside the tower, looking up at it. Tony was in there. Tony loved him. Had loved him. Tony thought he was dead. It took two and a half years, but Tony, like everyone else, had given up. They’d buried an empty coffin and put his name on a grave stone. Steve knew, because they’d put him in front of a screen and forced him to watch it. He remembered hearing the Kid’s gurgled noises of pain in the next room. He remembered wishing they were forcing him to watch them run their experiments on her rather than what was on the screen in front of him.
“I think you know what I’m talking about.”
And then Steve was gone, lost in a mass of people heading to bars and strip clubs, and Tony was left standing there, staring like an idiot.
“ You know that wasn’t fair,” Steve murmured, nipping at Tony’s earlobe. Tony shivered and pressed up against him, kissing him hard and dirty. Steve could taste himself on his tongue.
Steve turned, he hadn’t even heard Tony get off the phone.
“ Go on, Steve. I’m listening.”
He was home.
“ You...let me…” Steve huffed, sliding down to sit next to Tony on the floor of the shower, reaching out to him, but Tony was to focused stroking himself hard and fast, and Steve just watched mesmerized and lazy, smiling as Tony grunted and came. He reached out, pulling him close, lax under the warm spray of the water.
“Blueberry pancakes, and a pot of coffee.” The grumpy waitress had appeared once more, and Tony couldn’t help but be slightly frustrated that she’d pulled him from a very
Tony was in a place. That was the first thing that struck him when he opened his eyes. No inky blackness, no hellfire. He was in a field.  The grass was tall, the soft breeze barely disturbed it and wafted along something strong and floral. The sky was so bright and blue he had to squint his eyes to look at it. Tony lay there on his back in that field for a very long time. He’d been stunned. Where was he? What had happened to him after the snap? He felt fine. Better than he had in years. The thought bothered him.
