“I'll be damned.” He examines the frayed ends of the wire. “Wusn't sure that'd work.”
“S’pose I don’t.”
“Well, what did you have in mind? Can’t be my soul, I’m afraid it’s already spoken for.” Tony tries not to shift under the scrutiny he receives upon saying this. He wonders if the not-horse knows he accidentally punched a thoroughbred in the face not long ago. “I hope it won’t offend if I offer you an apple; a friend of mine, who looks much like you, enjoys them immensely.”
Tony rebuilt his whole right arm and shoulder with armor nanites. If he touched Steve with that arm, it would feel like touching this toy.
wait how did you make italics
we used this to great tactical advantage
“Fine, right, I get it, you’re Captain America, you can do whatever you want, how dare I interfere. Did it occur to you, Rogers, that I
Steve’s hearing had improved after Rebirth, of course, and now he also knows some of Natasha’s techniques for maintaining at least a low-level awareness of what other people are doing and saying even while focusing on something else. And, well, he’s already been more aware of Tony than he should be—of his presence, his voice, the way his smile quirks up on one side, the dexterous way he moves the fingers of the gauntlet, the way he seems to light up from the inside when he’s talking about his tech. So deciding to track Tony more consciously—for his health, obviously for his health, so that he could help in time, if Tony’s hurt again—shouldn’t be much of a change at all.
“Then you can see how he feels then,” Bucky says brightly, like this is a solution that in no way could result in Tony ending his friendship with Steve. Again. “And if he seems weird, just ask him about it. You guys can work it out.”
How did Apple get to town to ride out with everyone to the mines, when last we saw her she was at Doom Manor? Um,
He tries to shut down the part of his brain that’s cycling
For now, they tell the NMAT their favorite foods and what they’re in the mood for, and after providing lists that include fettuccine alfredo, chanterelle mushrooms, Chinese steamed pork dumplings, lemon meringue pie, smoked gouda, eggs over easy, Caesar salad, matzo ball soup, millefeuille pastries, and kalamata olives—generates a five-course meal with flavors from all over United Space.
He doesn’t have to clean it off. His uniform would cover everything.
Tony—one foot on the curb, the other still in the air—flails, fails to catch his balance, hears brakes screeching, horns honking, feels fingers grasping his wrist—feels time suspend. Like being hung on wires over a stage. And then with an intake of breath the streets of Pleasant Hill move around him again. The hand on him tugs him all the way back to the sidewalk, spinning him into an off-kilter pirouette so he faces his rescuer.
“Go wake the doc in case any of these men still have a pulse,” Rogers orders, reloading his gun and turning back to the street. “I'm gonna go cuff—” But Turk’s gotten up, seemingly under his own steam, and Rogers barrels off after him.
“Stop.”
After dinner, Tony says, “Why was I in a coma?”
I’d say more of a Wan Shi Tong.
Tony sneers down at Steve. “Playing dumb doesn’t suit you.”
“Certainly. Whenever you like,” Lieutenant Gonzales replies before Tony can respond.
They’re interrupted before the second word is out of their mouth. “Sounds like Hell in a Handbasket is the way to play it.”
let me know he’s not interested?”

Ha. Valid
“Would you want to know?”
century has to offer on his own. Or maybe someone else will be there to help him. Someone clever, someone who can keep up with him, with this.
so we end up in a part of a library that isn’t connected to any others
Tony clears his throat. “Yeah,” he says, turning away, “if we’re not here, definitely bring me here. I might not be able to talk, but JARVIS can help. There’s this heat thing that it helps to put on my chest, but the robots can cover that. It just” —he winces— “it helps to have someone with me. Just to, I dunno, confirm that it’s real? That sounds stupid. I mean, it’s like, to remind me that there’s nothing actually hurting me, and that I really can breathe, and that the pain is real but I’m going to be okay.”
“Oh,” Steve says breathlessly, his hand coming to cup Tony’s cheek from behind, “you’re crying.”
“Of course I’m Steve. I’m your soulmate.”
no monsters so far
The moral of this story is not that lies are bad or that lies are good.
He crosses the threshold where skin and fur give way to teeth and sinew and finds it in himself to be glad for the unending teeth, line after encircling line of them like rows of seats in a coliseum. After all, without them, he’d have nothing to hold onto as he climbed down the creature’s throat.
There’s a strategy meeting the next day, going over what they know about AIM and their plans—which isn’t much, but at least now everyone’s on the same page. Natasha, Peggy, and Coulson report on the intel they’ve gathered, then Tony talks them through his analysis of AIM’s last video transmission.
we haven’t talked about it yet so I was gonna wait to tell you
“—completely irrelevant—”
“But this is adorable,” Tony croons. “That’s why you’ve been so eager to give it up? Do you love me, Steve? Do you care?”
“Eliot’s right though, this isn’t the plan,” Parker says.
“So do you know why she’s not working here anymore?”
When he’s cried out, he kicks open the door of his forge, tosses the bottle onto his anvil, and smashes it to smithereens before it has time to roll away.
Did you know that Tigra can’t talk to cats either?
No, fuck that. He swallows around a piece of hard metal, like Iron Man’s armored cock is slamming against the back of his throat. Tony made this from the same building blocks he uses to remake his body, and Steve wants it to enter him with the full force of a tactical battle armor.
But it's Steve. He wouldn't say it if he didn't mean it.
“You lemme know if you need a hand, y’hear?”
“I think this one is like a cheeseboard,” Tony says, spreading a creamy violet something onto a something-else that looks like steamed flatbread. “See, this stuff is fermented, this is some kind of jam or chutney, I think these are the fruits from that ocean moon the computer was saying are kind of like apples, and this is a little charcuterie section.”
By Tony’s estimation, the bloodsucker deserved worse, but instead of saying so, asks, “And how
When the door to his cell opens again, an indeterminate amount of time later, Tony expects it to be more men coming to hurt him. He’s almost looking forward to it. It would be a reprieve from his endlessly circling thoughts of Steve, and maybe his body will hurt in new and distracting ways.
“I don’t think you’re taking this seriously, Mister Stark.”
“And now you do,” Tony points out, unsure of his role in this part of the conversation.
Tony runs, the ground convulsing under his boots. He sprays flame from his gauntlet to keep the others at bay. It's not lost on him that what Doom has pulled from the abyss is just what those creatures want.
Steve grins and rides into the setting sun.
Rhodes’ eyebrows approached his hairline. “You just said the same thing twice.”
That’s how Ensign Sindrison finds them. He doesn’t seem surprised that they’re both going right back to when and where they left. In fact, when they step into the room containing the device, there’s already a portal already formed. A dozen or more mechanical arms with funnel-shaped metal at the ends are pointed at the center of the room, beams of light and energy shooting out, the portal forming where they all intersect.
“Right. Steve.” Finally they’re getting back on track. “Is he a flowers guy? Not that I think he’d feel, like, emasculated by flowers, just, would he like them? Or chocolates maybe? Or something that’s not so consumable, jewelry maybe, or is that—hm, or would gifts make him feel weird, like, obligated, you two grew up in the Depression, right, so—”
“He's nothin' to do with me. I ain’t got any magic book. An’ ain’t you got plenty on your table with Fisk and his band of executioners?”
Tony’s left him a note; a paper one. How quaint. It’s on a corner of copy paper totally unlike the hotel letterhead that sits on the polished mahogany desk. His handwriting is the same, blocky and utilitarian. There are depressions in the paper under each letter, deeper at the joints; Tony used a crappy ballpoint pen, the kind that left-handers have to fight against to keep from jumping over the paper.
“Nope, just me,” Steve replies.
that was nonsense. probably magic
By the time Steve gets there, Jan has Tony on his feet and is helping him to the back door. He’s leaning heavily on her, clutching at—his chest? They’re almost out of the club when Jan lifts her head to glare at everyone staring. Steve turns away, feeling sheepish. He ducks his head, his eyes on his shoes as he makes his way back to the pool table.

or any version, even
“You’re grown-ups,” Rhodes said. “And you’ve already managed 3 weeks of this.”
“What should I have done instead?”
This time when the doors finally open, it’s James Rhodes blocking the doorway, looking unimpressed. It doesn’t help that Steve’s never sure how to address him. They don’t really have classes together, and while they’d spent some time together when Rhodes first joined the Academy, it hadn’t been long before the Civil War business interrupted everything. They haven’t spent much time together socially since then, mostly just nodding at each other across the bar at Club A when both their groups of friends are there at the same time. It’s fine in combat situations, when they both have the task to focus on, and Steve can just call him War Machine. But he’s not wearing the armor at all now, not even the black gauntlet that matches Tony’s red one.
Steve first read
Outside the windows of Club A, the marquee of Stark Tower flares with the words STARK, STARK, STARK—a lot like the inside of Steve’s brain, really. On the dance floor, Tony himself dances, moving like molten metal and light given form. He dances how he flies: effortlessly and joyfully. He flashes a dazzling smile—not toward Steve, he’s probably looking at Eric or Pepper or one of the other beautiful people who are already gravitating toward where Tony and Jan are dancing. Fuchsia spotlights and blinking string lights reflect off the brick walls, off Tony’s skin, off the smooth metal of Tony’s gauntlet. The arc reactor glows cyan through his dark tee, drawing Steve’s eyes across the club like a ship to a lighthouse.
“He came to me and suggested it himself,” Jen tells him. “He said Tony would’ve wanted him to.”
the Archives are FOUR storeys right?
“Yeah, way to respect boundaries,” Parker teases. Her tone shifts abruptly as she says, “Great. Good talk, next check-in is on the schedule. Bye.”
“No problem,” Otto says, barely sparing them a glance.
Tony tells himself it doesn’t matter why Steve’s agreed to talk and just starts talking. He begins with the Armor Wars. How different things are now.
Level 370: 27790
Tony decides to let him.
What follows is pandemonium. Steve thinks his brains have turned to tree sap trying to twig what’s happening.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stark!” someone cries. It’s Red Wolf, and from the sound of it, he’s practically at Tony’s front door. “Stark, are you there?”
After a moment’s hesitation, Tony leans in and sniffs it too. “Better than all that peat.”
For a moment, they both smile.
The next day he visits Coit Tower. He climbs up and down the stairs twice before he starts getting strange looks. He wanders through the streets of Telegraph Hill, counting wild parrots. After the forth he climbs Coit Tower twice more; none of the faces he sees are the same.
the iron man there has a secret identity
“Yes,” Tony says, sounding like he’s the one who’s swallowed a river of mud. “I got your message.”
. You can’t—you don’t need to—”
“Tony Stark?”
The next shot fired isn't from Steve’s gun.
Most people would expect that consistent honesty is important for a team. Would imagine that a team could not be a functioning one as long as it contains two members who lie to each other so often that it took three weeks and rather extraordinary circumstances before either of them noticed that they were under a spell
I mean yeah probably
“Hey,” Tony says, making sure Steve knows exactly where he is before he sets a hand on Steve’s shoulder. He’s not sure what’s happening, how Steve moved so fast, if this is a PTSD thing or a Steve thing or if there’s some kind of history between him and Brian.
do you know anything about L-space?
okay jan you can put the ladder back now
Deals 3690 damage, plus 235 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 350 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 375 per tile if target is Cap.

They sit like that longer than they need to. Eventually they get to their feet and set off again. Tony tells Steve some of the news from town he’s missed, and how Tony’s about to hornswoggle Victor von Doom—and has already pulled one over on Mister Wong, as well. It doesn’t much surprise Steve that all their trudging and climbing is toward a fight, nor that those three strangers are something unearthly.
“You just move in?” he says when Steve lets them into his bare apartment.
– Entrails, intestines
affectionate, Tony notes) sigh is interrupted by Parker saying, “So, which of you is usually—”
Tony wonders if the yelling will come during this nebulous
Steve does touch him, but not in the way he expects. He gets an arm under Tony’s knees and scoops him into his arms. It hurts, of course it does, because Tony’s back and thighs are still covered in welts, and the moment Steve takes the weight off Tony’s arms, every nerve ending in his body erupts in pain. All Tony can do is curl in on himself and bite back a scream. A wrenched, cut-off moan escapes him instead.
Thank you for going to the Archives and for being such a good friend to Doreen. I’m glad you’re Avengers.
did the Doctor say anything else?
“Uh, because you have the serum back?” Tony crosses his arms. “It’s okay, I know you probably want to go run, like, eighty million laps around the stadium just to celebrate that you can. The episodes are fifty years old, they’ll wait another few days.”
Tony nodded. “That’s not what I thought you’d say. So why are you asking me questions now?”
,” Spencer growls.
, is that Virgle Groslin’s body washed up the night before on the banks of the Kirby River, crawling all over with dragonfly nymphs.
At last Steve finishes, his come spurting across Tony’s ass and lower back, the strangled sound he makes loud in Tony’s ear. For a moment he stands there, as if to catch his breath, listening to Tony hold back sobs. He dips a finger into his rapidly cooling come, swirling it, then bringing a dollop of it to Tony’s lips. Tony clamps his mouth shut, but Steve pushes in anyway.
There’s mud in Steve’s lungs. There’s mud in his nose and ears and soaked into his clothes and all over his skin. He’s crouched over, mud underneath him, knees sinking further with each mud-filled breath. He coughs, and what comes out is mud, too.
“What?” Steve releases Tony, looking him in the eye, rearranging the duvet over their shoulders.
“I know you were—surprised to see me last night,” Tony says, the words tumbling out of him like he’s been saving them up. “I’m not going to hold you to—I know Registration—”
Well, I wanted to thank you too, anyway.
He travels the city on foot, which doesn’t take him far—his body is old and weak without the serum, and he’s not going to push himself when there’s nothing at stake but his pride. Mostly he keeps to the Richmond District, and sometimes he cuts through the park to the outer Sunset. He buys a new phone next to a surf shop and blocks all the phone numbers he can think of before they have a chance to track and call him.
“Well, folks think the book is magic, anyhow.”
He shrugged. Natasha had always thought him beautiful. Jagged, with a hint of violence, like a spider web pattern left by a bullet in glass—and all the more compelling for it, rather than despite it. He tucked a strand of hair behind one ear. “Does it matter?”
uh not exactly
you know I can kill you with my brain
yeah so
“What are you doing here?” she asked, hating the reassuring tone that crept like an uninvited guest into her voice. It wouldn’t do to reveal emotion.
A man wrapped in white cloth pulls up to the shore in a small punt. Its sides are painted by algae in a noxious green like the soup Bruce’s been cooking up. The man beckons them, and, with a glance at Tony, Steve climbs into the boat. Tony follows. The boatman lifts his pole and ferries them across the river in silence.
In which Steve enjoys himself, Tony's problems with the nanite network continue, and Friday dispenses medical advice.
Registration is over. The superhuman community is united. It feels nothing like a victory.
One night at an Extremis bar in Nob Hill, a woman with pearly skin and a fervent look in her eyes takes a seat next to him. She taps her Louboutins fast as a hummingbird’s heartbeat. “I’ve met Tony Stark, you know,” she says.
Steve doesn’t hesitate. “Override,” he says. “Steve Rogers. 34-44-54-64. Armor order: disassemble.”
Steve tries to tug his hands away; Tony’s grip tightens in response. His skin crawls. He’s never been more aware than this moment that the man with him isn’t Tony, not really. “Don’t say that to me.”
Steve shakes his head. His eyes drop to his shield, which he lowers. “No.”
Tony wonders what Wong thinks Tony’s going to do with it, if not use it, but he’s a practiced liar and offers plausible deniability by saying, “I’ve had plenty of practice resisting temptation since I left off the hooch.”
“But I’ll already be there,” Steve points out. “In this hypothetical scenario, I mean. So is there at least something I could do before Jan or Rhodey got there? If we’re at my dorm or practicing or something, should I bring you here?”
JARVIS still won’t let him in.
“It’s already happening, I’m telling you, we can’t stop it—”
steve who’s been showing you avatar the last airbender
there was this whole thing with the cyborgs and shields were thrown and repulsors were blasted etc
He’s roused by the sound of voices and gunfire, echoes of his dream and too-bright memories. He fights consciousness as long as he can. Rogers' voice is the first thing he can make out when he wholly wakes.
“We’ll find something together,” Steve says, almost like he believes it, “and when we’re ready we’ll be a united front. And—if that means I stop fighting registration, then that’s what I’ll do.”
Tony’s been cooped up in the tallest tower of Doom Manor for nigh on three nights and he’s feeling not a small bit like he’s in a Mary Shelley novel or a fairy story about a prince turned into a horrible beast. At least Tony has, unlike the heroes of those stories, made his arcane bargain with full knowledge of the consequences.
When at last Tony’s body is singular again, he eases the gag out of Steve’s mouth and rubs his back while he gasps and cries. Once Steve catches his breath, Tony replaces the gag and fucks him again. Tony still hasn’t undressed completely, his wrinkled clothes hiding the lithe lines of his body, and with each thrust the zipper of his fly rasps against Steve’s skin. If his attention is elsewhere, if he’s operating armor or meeting shareholders or designing bombs in his brain, he gives no sign of it. He fills Steve up and lets him imagine that he has Tony to himself.
“You thinkin’ about conductivity?” Tony wonders, a bundle of wires already in his fist. He crouches until the ends meet the puddle of water, which lights up with a buzz that knocks the man flat on his face.
Steve is still in charge. People insist they want it that way. He gets back to work.
And there goes Steve’s anger, the lid blown clean off. “Just gonna give up then, are you?”
Deals 3475 damage, plus 190 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, or 235 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 300 per tile if target is Iron Man.
“What are you doing,” Steve says. His hostility is tangible. Tony can taste it: bitter quinine and sour lime. “Tony, what the
. He says, “You mean more than anything else ever has.”
uh no reason except i think all the doors and windows have disappeared
Tony doesn’t bother to stop himself from rolling his eyes at Steve. “Of course I would.” Before Steve can try to put into words what that means to him, Tony’s talking again. “So? Did I cheer you up? Are you ready to be distracted by snacks and video games?”
"Which time?" Steve asks. The hard expression in his eyes belies his mild tone.
Tony’s got plenty in his pack that could be used as a weapon, but he’d prefer not to fight if he doesn’t have to. Plus, he’d rather save that fuel for later. “Riddles. Best of three.”
“Not even when the crawfish whistles on the mountain,” Natasha replies, already lifting up a chunk of silver to give it a good look.
The sorceress was—in what Natasha considered an amusing coincidence—hiding in the Forbidden Zone. When questioned, the sorceress admitted that she had cast the spell in order to try to disrupt the team. Under the impression that compliance would be rewarded with leniency, the sorceress lifted the spell.
Steve redirects his ire into the battle. The Skrulls are doing this to manipulate them. He’s not going to let them succeed.
Nat’s face twists sourly. “I’m not sure,” she admits. “But I think it’s something to do with his arc reactor.”
“You’re still healing,” Tony says. The
there’re these big patterned bits with a lot of teal that kinda look like rugs but not
Steve shrugs, smirking. Snow silently settles onto the roof. “I like having you here.”
“So time travel has been mastered, then, I take it?”
Tony nearly rolls his eyes. “If you have the same plans you did an hour ago, then yeah, of course it would be.”
- Drunk
, and by the Gregorian calendar it’s the year 2491.”
“Hi,” Tony says, setting his stylus aside and getting to his feet. It’s not a reply to what Steve’s said, but Steve doesn’t want to know anyway, not really. This isn’t them, not any more: Steve doesn’t visit Tony in his workshop. Tony doesn’t explain his latest schematics or test builds or armor modifications. Still. It’s hard not to imagine—
we are in transit but currently passing through shelves of scrolls and clay jars
“And Jan told you what’s going on with Tony.”
Steve. please. I’m begging you. I’m literally begging you. try to be a little more genre-savvy. we’re at a superhero school. some of our classmates are literal sorcerers and magicians. and we fight gross interdimensional monsters, like, once a week. do not go through the secret door. I already see a landing coming up we’ll be right there

“Like you’re remembering things that can’t be real.”
It’s wrong to miss it. It’s wrong to want more. Tony used him, like he always does, and he’ll do it again.
(He’s not British though. He’s Gallifreyan.)
“No sign from any of my fellow legal staffers that the new security guard might be Captain America,” Hardison supplies.
Aw, you recognized him by his eyes! ::smiling face with three hearts::
The knocking stops. Steve lets out a relieved breath.

Carol says, “I can’t. I can’t talk about him. Not yet. I know you cared about him, but you weren’t there. You didn’t see him. You hurt him, and I can’t forgive you yet.”
Without thinking—because when does he ever stop and think—Steve surges to his feet, stepping to block Tony’s path. The room spins. He gropes behind him for the bed and falls back onto it.
would you say I’m
He opens the panel for the security system locking the door. Without specialized tools, there’s no good way to make the door open without setting off alarms. And the last thing he needs is for Steve to know he’s sneaking around behind his back, looking for answers Steve doesn’t want to give.
“Oh. Loki told me.”
“I like you desperate,” Tony remarks, and replaces the gag. “You’re going to have to be patient again, now. Can you do that? Wait your turn like everyone else?”
“Stop it.”
Hey Hawkdude! Have you learned to talk to hawks yet?
“Steve—what—” Tony takes a step toward them and the lights go out. They return a split-second later, feeling brighter and bluer, and when they flicker again Steve’s dressed in red, white, and blue, a metal disk on his back with the same finish as the bowling ball he hurled, and the man in the purple hat is a different man, a violet cowl pulled over his face, a sword tucked into his belt and a gun in each hand. The room snaps into darkness again—dark, light, on, off—and Steve and the other man are gone, a smear of blood left on the polished floor—the lights flash, a warm, dim, yellow that makes Tony blink, and Steve comes toward him, carrying a water bottle from the vending machine, a sheepish expression on his face—
of course he was
right of course my bad
“Can’t say as I have.”
okay so
“I hope not,” Steve says, his hands sliding inside of Tony’s suit jacket. “We’ll be awake this time.”
He thought Tony saw him as a person. Not a comic book hero or a poster above his bunkbed at boarding school—a friend.
Tony rents an apartment for Steve’s next visit. The note on the bed says,
what does it mean if a guy you like acts really protective of you?
He shouldn’t have to remind himself that he’s always dreamed of Steve wanting him this much.
Steve ducks his head, shrugging. He locks the door and re-arms the security system.
“Do you use Extremis to knock me out?” Steve asks.
I literally can’t picture it but also the steve there didn’t know it was me in the armor!
Even if the ice never melts, there’s solid earth beneath it.
Steve emerges from the coffee shop with a pair of steaming paper cups. Tony takes his eagerly, the warmth already reaching him through his gloves. “You brought me coffee,” he says, giving Steve a peck on the cheek. “My hero.”
“I did say that.” Steve tries to be grateful that he has time to prepare answers to some of these instead of being blind-sided by them. “‘Would you say that the role of Captain America has shaped your identity?’ Really?”
Tony reminds Steve of the time Tony thought he was the Chameleon. How easily they patched things up back then.
The first time Steve met him, it was early in the morning, and Stark was out and out sober.
Leave it to Steve to repeat Red Skull’s mistakes all over again. Tony wonders what Steve asked the Cube for. A soulmate worthy of the Hydra Supreme Leader, perhaps. Whatever it was, he’s not expecting Tony’s best self. He’s not even expecting an equal—let alone someone superior.
He’s already half-hard again, anyway.
“Thank you for sending it.”
Nat’s blank face has taken on a cast that Steve can’t quite interpret. “When are you hanging out with him again, just the two of you?”
“It’s not a quiet book. It can be quite charming, even. And I’m near enough charmed to open it myself.”
“What do I—right. I must have some ulterior motive for not wanting you to die. I don’t know why—I’ll just go, shall I?”
“Steve. I…” Tony shakes his head. “I’m not an easy person to love. To be with.” His words catch, raw and quiet, in the back of his throat. Steve thinks Tony might be trembling.
what???
Team Iron Man Escalation tiles stay on the board even after Iron Man is downed.
There’s a roaring in Steve’s ears that has nothing to do with the volume of gunshots. Sharon’s still yelling, the crowd is still pulsing and bellowing. Why isn’t Tony moving? Is it Steve’s blood, was he hit again, what’s—
“Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?”
Tony thinks it might be nighttime. He doesn’t move when he hears Steve approach; Steve will arrange him however he likes, regardless of what Tony does. Tony doesn’t flinch, either. It’s a minor victory, but he’ll take it.
Especially since we haven’t found a way to communicate with anyone else.
hey nat
Instead Tony leans in unsteadily to kiss him, and Steve leans in to meet him. He welcomes Tony’s mouth, so hot and alive, with his own. His kiss is firm and searching. Steve squeezes Tony’s hand, his thumb still resting against Tony’s humming pulse. Alive, alive, alive.
“Flat-leaf parsley or curly-leaf?” Steve asks.
“Oh my god Barnes, do you have
“I’m sorry I let my personal feelings take over. I don’t like being kept in the dark.” Steve looks at Tony from under his eyelashes, a small smile unfurling from his features like a butterfly emerging still damp and delicate, fresh from its chrysalis. “Especially when it’s you.”
“No,” Steve says. “Don’t.” He tries to roll to one side and knock Tony off him—but of course he doesn’t have the strength.
Tony blanches. “If I didn’t know you better, I’d say you were trying to humiliate me.”
Sorry Buck. I got a little carried away.
—and lifts the shield over his head—but before he can bring it down over the Skrull’s neck, the false Iron Man throws his upper body between Steve and his double.

need them, if Tony chose it. Once Steve is immobilized to his liking, Tony prepares Steve cursorily and then drives into him in a single violent stroke.
—Steve stands in Tony’s workshop, now, in the present, still speaking, but what is time to Infinity—surely nothing that follows one moment after the last, first in/first out—

Brickenn is rendered in negative space. He has few words to offer, and fewer still to describe himself. The loss that defines him is that of a single pinprick of light vanishing among a firmament still teeming with stars—an absence visible only to those seeking it.
“I’ve loved you for so long, Steve.”
the second voice says.
Tony grins and winks at Steve. “Speaking of—” he starts.
“Do let me know if that changes,” Wormseed says mildly.
“Why do you think?”
“Yes, I think I saw you and your associates hanging around the night he died. Unfortunate you weren't able to conclude your business. Might I ask what those pursuits are? I could be interested in a stake.” It’s only because Tony is himself trying not to blink that he notices the other man hasn’t.
“Let’s focus here,” Spencer cuts in. “What now?”
Tony knows Steve’s brave, but he hadn’t been expecting this. If Steve can promise to rethink his ideals, to admit he might be wrong, to commit himself this way, it’s the least Tony can do to promise the same. He can’t think of a time Steve’s backed down like this before. He still doesn’t know how this could possibly be happening, but he doesn’t need to for now.
The arc reactor presses gently against Steve’s chest; he’d expected it to feel warm, or for it to vibrate, maybe, but it just feels like metal through two layers of cloth. The novelty of it serves as a forceful reminder that they’ve never hugged before.
An hour later, Worley Honton is dead. He’s in a heap, bleeding slowly into the rug in his hotel room, a hole blown straight through him. It’s charred black round the edges and the skin blushing round that, like a gunshot wound, except that this bullet would’ve had to’ve been the size of a dinnerplate. Steve can see through it to the flowers tufted into the rug beneath.
“Yeah, usually it’s not a big deal, but it flares up really bad sometimes.”
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Steve croons. “I’m here now, and I like you just the way you are.” He mouths along Tony’s jaw. “The man he wanted you to be wouldn’t know what to do with the power I’m offering you.”
sure of how fast Steve can move and how fast Tony can’t.
“Hey, so. I hate you too.”
“Tony,” he says, or tries to say, but he thinks maybe all that comes out is more mud.
whatever
for real. don’t do all the studying without us
“Steve.”
Steve’s kiss is no surprise this time, and no less delicious for it. He takes both their cocks in hand and tugs them to completion, his mouth still on Tony’s when they come. Steve’s still hard after that, and begs Tony to take him in his mouth again. He comes twice more like that, clutching Tony’s biceps nearly hard enough to bruise, whispering about all the things he’s imagined them doing.
It feels good to have Tony’s arms around him, nestled against his back. “I’ll make you a new one,” Tony vows as they canter off. “A bigger, brighter star. Bulletproof.”
I’ll shut up
The damage from that battle is, according to Pym and Reed, what caused the fault. Tony replaced the helmet and had diagnostics running on the rest of the armor. To all appearances, it was pristine. But it hadn’t been, and then there was Tony, fully armored, bleeding out from a few measly bullets.
I dunno man
– Tortuous, unfair, not quite moral
“Old habits,” Steve replies, half-shrugging.
Tony accepts the change of subject with some relief. “Yeah, I liked the BI-RON MAN one especially.”
Stark begins the story. He talks with his hands, and his hands talk with his whole arms. Steve can't help but notice how often Stark turns and grins at Neppie.
he had this glowing wand/laser pointer/doohickey and like pointed it at our phones and it made a little noise
The others aren’t there for long, really. Not nearly as long as Tony was gone. Tony and his partners claim the bed, so Tony’s right in the middle, and he doesn’t push Steve away when he leans against him. Tony never takes off his shirt or pants, but Steve can feel his skin through the fabric, can feel the muscles in his arms move as he lets first the woman, then the man, ride him. Steve shuts down his mind and focuses on the points where his body touches Tony’s.
“You love it,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, wrenching Steve’s head back further. “This is all you’re good for: a fuck. A hole for me to use. If you were any more pathetic you wouldn’t be worth the trouble. There are people in this city who’d pay me to pick them, you said so yourself. Everyone wants to give themselves to me: their money, their power, their bodies. You aren’t special. You’re just the one in front of me right now.”
Steve shook his head again.
Steve ignores that last comment. “Well, I didn’t, ah, tell him how I feel.” He tries to muster up a smile. “I did though, ask about the toy?”
Steve doesn’t flinch, but his body jerks. Tony’s kiss is all gin and teeth and tongue and the bite of lime juice over fresh cuts. He takes his time, lips pushing and tongue prying at Steve’s mouth, kissing like he’s trying to steal Steve’s breath away.
Sorry Bucky, I have to cut this short, there’s an ape here who might be injured. Thanks for talking with me, I’ll let you know what’s going on as soon as I have a chance!
I have my gauntlet and nanotech and everything
that would be amazing
Even someone who hasn’t been repeatedly mind wiped and mentally reprogrammed can’t remember
The cobalt of Tony’s eyes glints with the sky-bright blue glow from the node embedded in his chest. He searches Steve’s face. Steve wants clarity between them, but he doesn’t mind being a puzzle to solve as long as Tony’s here to decipher it. After a moment, Tony nods.
“Well, Mister Honton? Is it anything to concern myself with?”
get worse at communicating with each other,” Rhodes stage-whispered to Natasha as they headed toward the medical wing.
Captain America (Casualties of War)
Three days after “West Side Story,” the truth of the spell finally came to light.
A tear-track runs down the corner of one eye to Tony’s chin. His throat works. “Okay.” He opens his eyes. “Let’s—” He breaks off.
The smell of putrid meat dissipates the further they walk from the hellmouth, though Steve can still feel its hot breath on his back.
He has to, given what Tony must be thinking about him after
“Nope.” Tony scowled. “Why are you asking me this?”
“That was my idea!”
“I was about to ask you how, if—how you could fight me like this,” Steve says. Tony’s eyes are huge and searching, like he’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. “But I guess I know exactly how.”
“Yes, oh my god, if Ty’s involved in this shit too, that’s just sugar glazing—”
“D’y’know the song?”
All Tony can do is breathe around Steve’s cock as it slides in and out of him. Steve’s head is thrown back, his expression beatific, and Tony tries not to choke with the awareness that the real Steve has never touched him this way. The one Tony wants has never wanted him. It’s only this sadistic facsimile who delights in using him this way, and if it weren’t for their soulmarks, his interest in Tony would be in how easy Tony is to hurt, and nothing more.
“I’ll let you get back to monitoring that, then. You kids have fun.”
A liver spot recedes, then vanishes entirely. The saggy, wrinkled skin on his hands retracts, growing taut and smooth. By the time he has his phone out, his hands are perfect, nimble and rosy. His reflection in the phone is that of a young man with thick blond hair and hard eyes.
It doesn't have to mean what Tony wants it to mean. But, if nothing else, Steve wants to work together.
basis with the CEO of Viastone,” Hardison grumbles.
When Tony comes back with Banner, the four fellas are hanging by their wrists from the porch of Fisk’s casino.
Reed’s not the only one from Tony’s side acting as a witness for the defense. Jan and Rhodey are there too, and more surprisingly, Carol.
And we learned some physics!
“Yeah, you’re management, I know. Still. You and Stark talk, or something?”
Steve gathers Tony in his arms. Tony comes easily, tucking himself against Steve’s front, resting their foreheads together.
Tony winces. “I can—”
If you get a chance, please tell Doreen I said hi!
i was giving you time to collect intel
“Then how do I show you?” Steve asks.
There’s a strawberry-milkshake-colored tinge flushing Steve’s face and ears. Tony’s heart flutters to see it.
wooden shelves. balconies and bridges and galleries
Steve’s hand is still in Tony’s hair, the other wrapped around the small of his back. He pulls away with reluctance, a fond smile on his face. “What’re you packin’, then?”
The men talk amongst themselves as they work. The one with the loudest voice also has the most to say about their task. He ponders what will be the most painful, debilitating, humiliating.
The other Captain America pivots toward him, shield perpendicular to his body. Steve’s ready for him. He punches his double with his shield over his knuckles. A repulsor is being fired, low to the ground, and Steve leaps to the air before he realizes why he’s doing it, clearing the repulsor blast and kicking forward. He aims for the other Captain America’s star.
Later than evening, Tony turned to Steve—who had barely left Tony’s side throughout the whole party, not that he would admit it or Tony would realize the implication—and said, “Where’s the illustrious Agent 13? I was looking forward to seeing her here.”
“Glad to hear it,” Steve says, a smile lighting his eyes.
And—oh. Right. Tony really was just going to show Steve his cheese fridge. Along with other people, apparently.
“Do you want to move in with me?”
“He wouldn’t,” Steve replies, holding back another groan. He can feel the scuffs in the laminate faux wood of the table through the elbows of his jacket. “He’s too polite to make a fuss.”
are we talking hot librarian like Rachel Weisz in the Mummy?
Steve nearly whines when Tony pulls out. He tells himself it’s because his throat is still so dry and raw, that that’s why he craves a burst of Tony’s thick come hitting the back of his tongue. Tony takes himself in hand and finishes on Steve’s face. He makes pleased sounds when Steve tries to lick it up without being asked.
yes but also novels with libraries in them, like Neverending Story and Asimov and stuff
He takes deliberate steps through the ankle-high fur of a breathing, blinking creature that, to all appearances, is buried in the sand with only its face breaching the surface. That face reminds Tony more than anything of a dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel looking out from a lady’s purse—if said spaniel were the size of a stampede and had red instead of white around its corneas. The teeth, too, are uncanny, too high in number, stuffed together too tightly, and set in too many rows. One tier springs up behind the other, like once the first set of teeth was done coming out, a few other sets thought they’d join in, too. The nose, though, is a round, wet, black thing not at all unlike the kind found at the tip of a cattle dog’s snout. Lucky, the hound kept by the Barton clan, has a nose just like it, if a great deal smaller.
we’re trapped in a maze of moving stacks
A few minutes later Loki, no doubt bored by the lack of attention, huffs and says, “Armor Man had to leave Dr. Pym’s Nanoscale Materials seminar in quite a hurry.”
“How come it took you three weeks to notice everything you said to me was a baldfaced lie?”
thanks for listening to me though
Steve swallows a chunk of unchewed cookie. “You’re welcome,” he says. “I’m glad you like them. And wow, these really are amazing!”
“Can’t say I do. How’ll some singin’ do instead? More likely to keep you up all night than put you to sleep though, I’m told.”
Yes, they were fighting. Tony died thinking Steve hated him. Steve thought he hated him, too, which is worse. “I miss him,” is all Steve can say, and they speak of inconsequential topics until Sam leaves.
“Is this because I hung some things in the spare closet? Because I—”
Steve hums noncommittally.
“Yes, we will,” Steve agreed.
Steve’s prepared for a blow this time. He imagines the weight of his shield—the one he left behind when he left Tony behind. He’s made himself vulnerable to an attack, but he’s ready. Whatever fury, indignation, or derision is coming, Steve’s braced for it.
“Like it was yesterday,” Tony says, and he thinks he’s going to remember Steve’s shy smile and pink ears but instead there’s gold at the edges of his vision, like he’s looking through a gleaming mask, and there are ice crystals on Steve’s eyelashes, and Tony thinks,
“Tony. What are you talking about?”
This is almost a consolation.
“I’m getting—weird readings,” Tony says after a moment.
sure thing
he seemed really surprised to see us and kept asking if we’d “been in the computer” and “what year we’d arrived” and “why we hadn’t teleported out”
Two guys take the lane next to Steve and Tony’s, one wearing an olive green tee and faded yellow sneakers, the other in a knit purple hat, both nearly Steve’s size. They play side by side in peace for some time, long enough that thoughts of the little girl trickle out of Tony’s consciousness like droplets condensing on the outside of a glass.
oh hey speaking of librarians
He was lucky he wasn’t severely injured. I wonder if the layered rugs helped cushion his fall.
Alt: We’re Just Fighting
They take turns flogging the vaults of his feet, first with a switch, then a cane, and he cries out after barely a minute. He bites his tongue and tries to sink into the part of his mind that severs him from sensation, but he can’t. He knows it’s only going to get worse. Other parts of the body adapt to impacts. The soles of the feet don’t.
“Right.” Tony affixes a cocky grin to his face. He’s got this. “Check this out!”
She nods, looking thoughtful. “I’m Lieutenant Gonzales, you’re on the exploration vessel United Space Ship
Sam lets the matter drop, fortunately. Less fortunately, the topic turns to mind control and mindwipes. Perfect. Just in case Steve forgot why he and Tony weren't friendly before this, why they aren't on the same team, the rest of the meeting will remind him. Tony ducks his head and keeps his eyes fixed on his hands, careful to avoid any chance of eye contact with Steve.
“Yeah, well, I don’t think I’d have appreciated your company just then.”
“Right, not if I can’t ‘follow through,’” Tony sneers. They’re so close together that their noses brush; Tony’s face floods Steve’s vision. “And what would following through look like, Steve?”
“I know it’s not what you wanted, it doesn’t change what happened, but, now you—at least you know I don’t want to hurt you, right?”
Steve hunches over his beaker. Yeah, it’s definitely weird. And probably at least a little creepy.
Level 370: 34715
He’s prepared for the dizziness when he stands this time, taking slow breaths. He pulls the chain over his head and carefully, slowly, telegraphing his movements, steps forward and places it around Tony’s neck. Tony’s grip on the arm of his chair has gone white-knuckled. He searches Steve’s face, but Steve doesn’t know what he’s looking for.
“So we were just sort of floating, weightless, inside of this glass bowl, except it wasn’t glass, really, it was some kind of energy, with these little pink and purple pulses running through it, and the whole thing was hovering in this kind of—I don’t know, wireframe. Like a cube, but just the outline, like it was a neon sign.”
Sam says, “Steve, I know he was… important to you. But I don’t have a lot of nice things to say about the guy. You wanna talk, I’m here to listen, but I don’t know if I can do much else.”
I also heard you didn’t need America at all
“Well, won't be long now before the town comes out with pitchforks begging 'im to arrest me. And that sheriff, he’s a strange bird. Some kinda freethinker, I hear. Wants that first amendment stuck to—and all the other ones, too. Thinks women oughta get the vote, even.”
goddammit. I blame your influence for this, Tony
omg omg omg
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s gotten Tony’s face all muddy, though tracks of tears have washed it off in crooked lines, like the lines of riverbeds on a map. “Been wantin’ to do that.”
Then, instead of telling him off for setting off fireworks indoors, she smiles again, this one a plastic thing, like a fake rubber plant from Ikea. “Very cool,” she says, and Tony doesn’t know whether to scream in frustration or moan at the ghostly pressure that’s riding his dick like a mechanical bull.
“I’m fine, you can go now,” Steve says, ducking back under his blankets.
so are you guys skeletons now or…?
He pushes his finger in, two knuckles deep. Steve squeezes his eyes shut. “I can’t stop you.”
Stark snorts.
and after we convinced them we weren’t villains or lmds or whatever
Steve masturbating.
Steve watches in growing rage as his closest friend in this century betrays him again and again, attacking and imprisoning their friends, destroying the very freedom Steve thought they’d been fighting for.
please return to the primary debrief
“Oh!” Tony takes a moment to recover, then he gets to his feet, the high-watt smile back on his face. “Sure thing, Cap. Can’t get enough training in, huh?”
“They only have so much space in the headlines, babe,” Tony says.
“Wanna tell me about it?”
and if you’re in this library but don’t see him you have no way of knowing when you are and could get eaten
“Yeah, uh, I was looking at the American realists, you know, but all the Hoppers I found reproductions of seemed too cold and lonely for a bedroom, and I thought some of her early Precisionist stuff might be your style? And I thought the Wyeth ones matched the backyard.”
“Don’t,” he croaks, still trying to tug his hand away. He doesn’t think Steve will stop, not any of this, no matter what Tony says, but part of him wants to see how Steve will respond.
. Maybe Steve wants Tony at full strength before punching him in the face; Steve has funny ideas about fairness like that. "Of course." He catches himself chewing on his lip and tries to smooth out any expression on his face. "Were we, are you and I" —he tries not to hesitate, but he falters— "together?"
“Yes,” Tony said quickly. “I mean, I don’t want to kiss you.”
i take it recorded knowledge includes digital stuff
“And I know it sounds crazy,” Steve goes on, his voice firm, “but when I try to remember, it’s always stuff from a World War II movie—”
“So we call Tara. Hammer and Stone already don’t trust each other, so she and Alec and Stark can do the Soft Shoulder or—”
“And the paps are gonna be at this one?” Parker asks.
Transforms 4 tiles and stuns enemies for 3 turns.
“What do you want me to say? You said I’d crossed a line, with Cloak and Wiccan. I tried to talk to you, I practically begged you! And now you’ve come here and disabled my armor. Seems pretty goddamn straightforward.”
God, Tony must hate that. Steve can think of few things Tony would like less than having a problem he can’t fix—and when that problem is himself, well. “And he doesn’t want to see me.”
He can’t help but wonder sometimes what it would have been like if they’d met in the evening, when Stark was deep into his cups and barely able to keep himself upright.
“I feel like I’ve known you for years,” Steve says, then frowns, like he’s not sure why he did.
In the business of espionage, there is no admitting of anything, least of all lack of knowledge. Those who know pretend that they don’t, and those who don’t carry on as if they do. It is likewise considered a weakness in other circles she’s encountered, such as among CEOs, academics, internet forums, and battle strategists. For James to even say that he lacked knowledge of something, let alone such a fundamental question, was astonishing. It was so audacious that hearing it felt as if she had stumbled upon him nude, unarmed, and asleep in foot-deep snow. Without her permission, her heart rate spiked.
Steve wonders if Brickenn really thought he’d see Earth again. He’d spent years living with the reality of its absence, visiting it only in his mind—long enough to inextricably entwine memory with imagination.
He meets Tony’s gaze, face and body twisted up like a spring. Tony isn’t quite sure what’s happening, what Steve’s thinking, what Steve’s feeling.
has to help make sure all this happens on track,” Tony adds, arms in an expansive gesture to encompass the room, the space station, the whole of United Space. He bites his lip, eyes darting to one side, says, “Especially now that I know that’s where you’ll be.”
He’s dated a few people but it didn’t go anywhere.
: all what?
“What?”
“Have you noticed that when we ask questions we’re able to tell the truth?” Steve asked not long after Sam and Rhodes had departed.
“Hey Steve,” Rhodes says. “What’s up?”
you are. Steve, Steve. My dear, naive, idiotic Steve. I spent every day of my life trying to live up to you. Everything I ever did—including the things you hated me for—oh,
Grants a burst of 50% health.
She asks him why he would ever leave such a paradise, and he closes off again, replying tersely that he’ll return when his work is done.
The damage done in the fights with Simon and Apocalypse is conspicuous in its absence. The mundanity of it all is overbearing: the familiar configurations of electronics and drawers of tools and placements of worktops; the at once unfamiliar arrangements of parts and furniture orchestrated by past versions of himself—versions remembered and forgotten and overwritten. A jumble of time travel and Infinity Gems and the messiness of human thought, presented as a tidy, well-organized workspace.
Wormseed sneers. “Not for long.”
“Sure,” the guy says, a blush turning his ears the color of a strawberry milkshake. “I’m Steve.”
“Yeah, I do. But I still don’t—I couldn’t, I can’t sit there and do nothing.”
“Cap! Is Iron Man on the team?”
or because we still have to get ready for that presentation for dr. pym?
So! Who needs to be punched and/or covered by squirrels?
“I do not look like a basset hound.” Not Steve’s cleverest retort, but the topic already has him on the defense.
hard topic
Hello, Mr. Barton. How may I help you?
“Friday? What’d I have for breakfast?”
(This time, he didn’t mention it to Bucky. He’d been embarrassed enough, thanks.)
Striding from one mound of earth to the next is slow going, and he loses his footing more than once. The river water is more mud than liquid, his boots sinking inches with each moment he stands there, his trousers soaked through with muck up past his knees. Each time he stumbles into the water, the agitation floods the air with the mossy, smoky smell of peat. He tries not to think of Scotch whisky.
no because one of them had a FACE
After a pause, Spencer says, “Thanks.”
When Tony reaches his forge, Wormseed is there, leaning on the outside door.
The thing is, though. It was like the other Tony was jealous of himself?
“Stark,” comes Spencer’s gruff voice the moment Tony answers the call incoming on the Leverage line. “We got your payment.”
“You didn’t need to. I figured it out.”
They chase each other and dart away from each other like a pair of blue jays going after the same grasshopper. Steve tosses himself through the room like he’s his own shield, finding angles and arcs to intercept Tony’s flightpath. Tony twirls and flips like an acrobat somersaulting from one tightrope only to land on and ride a unicycle across another.
wait wait wait
there was another captain america and iron man there
“And Worley had it? If it’s worth that much, he needn’t've come all this way an’ try an’ get money offa me.”
“Our minds were wiped,” Tony reminds him. “We were mind-controlled.”
“Whatever you want. I mean it.”
“Pardon?”
Maybe
“I don’t think it’s a good idea” —Tony barks his not-laugh again— “but—but I’m really glad you’re here.”
He leads her through the living room, the dining room, the den, the spare bedroom they use as a TV room. The idea of showing her the space he’s turned into a workshop makes his hair stand on end, but she just hums when she sees it and makes another note on her tablet.
Steve shifted, making the plastic bed frame creak. “Yes.”
Steve falls asleep reading reports in his small room, tucked into a remote corner of the helicarrier. He wakes up, his eyes burning with tears, an ugly, gnarled grief strangling him from the inside. There have to be hidden security cameras and bugs all over, placed there by Maria, Fury, and any number of government agencies from any number of countries—but there’s no hiding this. So he cries. He curls in on himself and sobs until he falls asleep.
. “Do I,” he says archly.
“Can I—can I hold your hand?”
So Steve just says, “Hi.”
PASSIVE: If Iron Man is below 15% health, this power becomes
He’s not supposed to do this alone.
“Me too,” Steve says, whispering so as not to shatter this fragile moment. “I feel the same way,” he says, then realizes this isn’t entirely true. Steve feels that, and plenty more he’ll never have the chance to tell Tony.
“You do,” Tony says. He sinks back against the headboard, pulling Steve into his lap with him as he does. “Even if I hurt you?”
“He collapsed. Bug Woman had to practically carry him out of the Blasting Range,” Loki says, sounding excited. Steve clenches his fists and reminds him that punching Loki won’t actually improve the situation. Well, it might feel good, but it won’t help Tony. “She neglected to take a selfie to commemorate the occasion. It seems she is capable of restraining herself at times.”
“I need you,” Steve says, opening his eyes to find Tony’s expression a reflection of his own. “I can’t do this, any of this, without you.”
Steve doesn’t think he’s doing any of those things.
“Please,” Tony says, panting, internally reviewing the helicarrier’s security footage from the past week. He needs to know what Steve’s been up to. What Steve’s going to ask him for. “Tell me what you want. Let me make you feel good.” There are so many vulnerabilities in the helicarrier’s systems. He’ll have a bounty of opportunities to disable or destroy it when he needs to. “Thank you for giving me this chance. I’ll do whatever you want, whatever Hydra needs me to. You’ll see.”
so obviously we were both like what the fuck, are you okay, etc
He sags, buries his face against the broad wall of Steve’s chest. “Every way I’ve ever tried to be better, it was because of you.”
Tony only obeys because trying to twist away wrenches his injured side. A new kind of hopelessness swells inside him. Steve curls Tony’s knees into his chest, presses the head of his cock against Tony’s crease, then shoves inside, only Tony’s saliva smoothing the way.
This is the last line of
Worried about what Tony might do, no doubt. "What did I do? What don't I remember?"
“Sam’s Cap right now.”
The book is warm even through the fabric of his clothes, warmer even than standing in the bright noonday sun. Forgetting it’s there is hard to do with its heat drumming against his breast.
He was going to let Steve
“Don’t seem like the sorta thing that’d be in Timely,” Steve notes.
It’s 54F and overcast when Steve lands in San Francisco. A private car service takes him to a hotel in Pacific Heights; the driver doesn’t say a word beyond, “Sir.”
“You’re the one whose face is all over the news. I wasn’t even there.”
“Is that true?” someone says. Tony’s missed another chunk of the conversation. He’s not sure who asked the question, and only realizes it’s pointed at him when he looks up to see everyone looking at him.
He almost speaks when Steve starts undressing. But he doesn’t know what purpose it would serve. Antagonizing him? Goading him? Begging him not to touch Tony again?
“You give me too much credit.”
“No, c’mon, it’s weird,” Steve whispers back, watching Otto’s return to the kitchen out of the corner of his eye.
“Yeah man, I got that,” Sam says gently.
He tells himself it’s the evening chill that sets him to trembling. It could just as well be his hankering for a tipple. He’s already heading to hell, he tells himself.
Steve wants to hit something. His fingers try to curl into fists, and the letter starts to tear along one of the folds. For the first time in days his heart is racing, and he’s feeling, he’s feeling so much, too much, his rage is large enough to swallow cities. Tony, the futurist, no doubt predicted Steve would react like this; but if he did, he would’ve been entirely wrong about the reason.
“Might I?” Tony wonders. He doesn’t carry his wrist piece anymore, but he has a knife up his sleeve instead. It’s warm in his palm; not fever-hot like the book, but familiar and solid, like a river rock left on a sunny windowsill.
By the time Steve makes it to his suite he’s so hard it hurts and he can’t think of anything but the toy stuffed into his jacket. He’s half undressed when he reaches his bedroom, his pants, belt, jacket, socks, and shoes a trail behind him like fairytale breadcrumbs. He reverently sets the toy on his bed. He means to take the rest of his clothes off and find his lube, but he can’t take his eyes off the thing. It’s perfect. It’s real. And Steve talked to Tony about it—god, the way he spoke to Steve undid him, gentle and straightforward. Trying to show Steve it was no big deal.
I’m fucking with you
Five minutes ago, Steve would’ve agreed. He might’ve—he
Correct.
Steve counts his breaths. He doesn’t bother trying to break or slip his restraints. Ten minutes pass with nothing but the forced air of the environmental system skimming Steve’s skin. Tony’s come is dry and itchy in Steve’s crease and down his thighs. A quarter of an hour. A half. Steve fills his mind with numbers to the exclusion of anything else. He reaches a count of two thousand breaths—nearly an hour. He wonders if Tony’s going to leave him like this until the last trace of Extremis vacates Steve’s body. He wonders how Tony will look at him once he’s no longer beautiful, once his body no longer belongs to Tony.
“Don’t be dense,” Tony snaps, amusement gone. “You’re special and you know it.”
“No, I’m asking you, will you move in with me?”
He reread the whole book that night while the snow fell, and in the morning dragged himself to work, sapped of heat and wakefulness, aching in new ways. Still, he started it again the next night, slowing down to savor the overwritten emotions and ostentatious alien landscapes.
I’m familiar with the concept, yes. Are you conducting research?
Ben Urich is alone in the newsroom when Steve walks in, watching him warily. As well he should; if anyone should be speaking up about Mayor Fisk and Governor Roxxon, it's a newspaperman. That's not what Steve's here for this time, though.
“They’re, uh, also sharp enough to use as weapons,” Steve says, shuffling his feet. “And strong enough, too; they’re adamantium under the gold.”
and she was all like, “get back! and try to make yourself bigger than the librarian!”
“I hunted down our friends. I used Thor’s DNA to make the abomination that killed Bill. I betrayed you. All of you.” Tony’s voice is so matter-of-fact it makes Steve want to scream. Tony is a liar, a hypocrite, a turncoat, and he’s standing here, saying all this like Steve doesn’t already know it, like it explains anything.
Tony’s not ready for this. He’d rather they go back to kicking him.
Tony isn’t sure whether it’s politeness or habit that makes Steve ask, or if it’s some kind of trick question. His answer is the same regardless. “I’m fine, Cap.”
“I don’t think so either.”
“Hello there,” Stark says when they arrive. His eyes twinkle and are, for now, unclouded by drink.
How many times has he awoken in the night? Fully dressed, a laptop or stack of files in his lap, overcome by a devastation that strips the air from his lungs. How many nights has he turned his face to the wall and cried?
“Can’t Friday monitor us just well from our quarters as the doctors can in here?” Steve asked the room, cutting Tony off.
“Just carried it out here ‘cause of molasses, huh,” Stark says, barely looking as he reassembles the contraption's innards. “That a fact?”
of dollars to make himself feel better, and you can’t say no, can’t be ungrateful, not when he’s given
“I’m so glad,” Tony says, surprised to find he’s shivering. Isn’t it August? “That’s all I want to do, Steve.”
Steve's expression goes tight and tense, but he nods. "You were in a coma."
Steve’s smile gives Tony goosebumps. It’s bright, and just the way Tony loves to imagine it. “Try me.”
Tony lets Steve take his hand again and lead him into his bedroom. Steve strips out of the bulkiest parts of his uniform and without further preamble tugs Tony into his bed. Tony must be able to read every wish and desire in Steve’s heart, but he settles against the mattress wary and frowning like he doesn’t know why he’s there. Steve wraps his limbs around Tony’s body, hoping that will be explanation enough. It feels like he’s holding a firefly in his fist and watching the light come through his fingers, knowing he’ll have to open his hand eventually.
what’s the topic?
Tony shakes his head. He startles when Steve’s bare fingertips brush over his eyelids. He blinks them open, not knowing when he closed them. One of Steve’s gloves is on the floor. This can’t be happening, not now, when Tony’s so thoroughly ruined them.
But Tony won’t imagine—
Jan bites her lip and looks away. “It’s—I’m only telling you because I know you’re worried, okay?”
James found the nearest security camera, stood square in front of its line of sight, and waved at it.
Wong plucks a book from a crowded shelf. His house has more books than the town library, more even than Tony’d once had in the halls of his New York City mansion. The tome Wong sets on the table between them looks ordinary enough, to Tony’s eye. “I’ll give it to you,” Wong says slowly, “only because I don’t want it in here a moment longer.”
omg have I been brainwashed by a 1990s mixed drink commercial
yeah it’s really neat actually
Missions and cases and meetings tangle together. Steve’s recall is perfect, but right now, he can keep track of the days only if he concentrates, if he grasps and presses until they’re in reach.
He helps Tony use the restroom. He cleans Tony’s cuts, scrapes, and welts, and even bandages them in places. He pops Tony’s shoulder back into place. When Tony cries and shudders, Steve strokes his face, and when Tony tries to curl into a ball, Steve pulls him open like he’s prying a stubborn root from the dirt. He brings Tony more food, and feeds it to him a bite at a time like a child.
empty. A void where his organs should be.
The others press in closer and push him toward his door. “Let me go!”
“So it would be a mistake to trust you now.”
“No?” Tony laughs again. He catches Steve’s wrists in one hand, his movements instantaneous and effortless. “Can’t stand the reminder of when you were the one calling the shots? Or do you just like to pretend you never noticed what you did to me?” His expression darkens. “Disappointing you is devastating, you know, for those weak enough to care.”
lucky the dog
Tony takes an involuntary step forward before he can stop himself.
Steve shoves Tony onto his back, sits on his chest, and pries his mouth open. He settles his weight there, watching Tony’s face for the pain to hit him. Tony tries to brace himself, but Steve lifts Tony’s arm above his head and then Tony can’t stop from yelling—expelling the only protest his body can muster against the throbbing pain radiating from his shoulder. Steve grabs Tony’s chin, holding his mouth open so he can slam his cock down Tony’s throat.
The device is warm and buzzing under Steve's fingers. "I can," Steve says, and Tony's smile turns knowing and rueful.
Steve weighs his choices. If he refuses, it’s not like Tony will leave. And there’s no postponing the inevitable—Tony knows what’s happened, and he’s not going away. Steve takes the edge of the blankets and pulls them down his face, watching Tony for his reaction.
They get to their feet; Tony sees Lester on the ground in front of the casino, a bullet in his forehead. There are plenty of other gunmen still standing, though, barrels pointed at them both.
It’s not that Steve might not have clicked on those, if he’d done the search himself in the first place. (If he’d had someone to teach him how to use the internet other than a ten-minute video.) It’s that he’d have known who was presenting the information. He’d have been able to look up the dates of any clips he saw.
“That’d be a good title for the article,” Friday says.
I’m as sure as I can be
. “We should try that sometime,” he says, a giddy smile on his face. “Do you want an armor? I could make you one. It could have a star-shaped arc reactor.”
and it’s a morning class right
Lieutenant Gonzales shakes her head. “It could. That sort of thing has the potential to, that is. But it hasn’t.”
Tony stops talking. Steve can barely hold himself still. He forces sincerity into every line of his body.
Before he can say as much, Black Bolt speaks—and it’s not Black Bolt.
The day goes on without Steve. The passage of time is meaningless to the roaring in his ears.
The not-horse peers at him. “You don’t know where he is.”
right
“Exactly,” Steve says. “You didn’t. You could’ve done anything, and you didn’t. Not many people could resist a temptation like that.”
“And better lit,” Steve agrees.
And then Tony’s arms are around his neck, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder and Steve wraps his arms around Tony before he’s fully processed the situation. Tony’s in his arms. They’ve slept side by side, in this bed, and now they’re holding each other. Steve’s had dreams like this.
His faceplate showed his eyes. So I’m sure, yeah.
and then when we went through the secret door our hands brushed
Y’know what Clint?
but so after we got separated from the doctor
now it sounds like you’re innuendoing something
Tony is dying. "Guess I don't," Steve says.
yeah I asked him why he has a british accent then and he was like “for all you know british people have gallifreyan accents”
Steve doesn’t expect Pepper to want to be Iron Man any more than Rhodey did, but he asks, and what she has to say is the worst of all.
“Thanks, Otto,” Steve says, as the owner of the PH diner sets their orders on the table between them.
So Tony sings:
“It’s perfect, Tony.”
Steve’s fingers feel thick and clumsy as he struggles to unbutton his shirt and shrug out of his undershirt. He can’t entirely swallow, and his mouth floods with saliva, trickles down his chin as he sucks. The only way Steve could be more attracted to the armor is if it had a big shiny erection, and that’s exactly what he has in his mouth. Tony built Iron Man out of genius and hope and sheer force of will, and what could be more Tony Stark than that?
If he goes a few days, or a week, at a time without sleeping, it only means he’ll sleep soundly when he finally collapses in bed, deep and dreamless.
Stark catches Steve’s eyes in the mirror and lets his hands, which have been holding his head up, drop to opposite elbows. He lets his head fall into the bar, his arms catching his forehead. “Can’t’cha let me alone for one night?”
Tony tries to see Steve as an artist would. He tries to flatten his perception into two dimensions, carves it up according to lightness and darkness. Here a patch of sun, here a shadow, here a highlight of molten gold haloing his head.
you, the Spanish Turnabout pays off at an airport!”
so he took us up this spiral staircase to where the books got really creepy
“Yes,” Tony says, a little breathless, because the wind’s been knocked out of him.
Steve wraps an arm around him and gives him a peck on the top of his head—because it’s nearby, and also the least muddy part of him. Tony wriggles closer, until they’re close as cat’s breath. “Guess I’m not gettin’ the mitten when we’re topside,” Steve says.
“That won’t disrupt the timeline? Change history?” Tony asks.
“You were on a mission last night,” Steve points out.
“Uh, yeah you were, you were right behind me.”
It is the same with lies: there is often only one way to tell the truth, but there are many different ways in which one can tell a lie.
He’s still arguing with JARVIS five minutes later when the doors slide open with a pneumatic hiss. Jan steps forward, her arms crossed. “What’s up, Steve?” she says. She’s smiling and her voice is friendly, but Steve can see she’s tense and doesn’t want to be talking to him.
Fog creeps up the edges of the sky as they approach the Pacific, but is still overwhelmed by clear blue. “It’s never like this in the Presidio,” the driver says as he takes Steve’s bag and starts carrying it toward the little inn where Steve has a room.
we have not encountered any hostiles since the robots
“Do you want to stay?”
“You won’t have a choice. You can’t hide anything from me. You can’t manipulate me the way you did him.” Steve sounds almost earnest. “He didn’t deserve you. He wanted to change you. But I know you better. I appreciate you.”
I’m counting that as inappropriate innuendo: 4
But he’s not frightened of this. This is what has to happen. And he has time to say goodbye.
When he heard the approach of vehicles, he held his empty hands above his head.
okay so we went through that secret door
not particularly
Tony doesn’t roll his eyes, but he makes it clear that he’s thinking about it.
The outlet highlights the conspicuous absence of any phones, tablets, or computers. Steve must not want him to learn what he’s missed from the news. Tony remembers sitting up in a bed like this one, in Oklahoma, what feels like a lifetime ago, and reading headlines calling him a fascist and a monster. Accusing him of rolling out the red carpet to let Skrull ships into Earth's airspace. Blaming him for Steve's death.
Tony’s attempt at an innocent expression are met with an indulgent eye roll.
He jogs up and down the stairs on Lombard Street while cars of tourists slowly wind up the road. The sun glares through the solid wall of fog, casting no shadows on the coral-colored bursts of hydrangeas.
Happy Hannukah!
“Rest,” Steve says.
“Okay, so, what’s the angle with Stone?” Spencer asks grudgingly.
Converts chosen tile into a 3-turn Countdown tile. Countdown Tile deals 780 damage when it reaches 2, 830 when it reaches 1, and 940 when it reaches 0.
“It—” Steve starts.
And though she doesn’t mean it to be, this is also where Steve’s reminded that Carol stood by Tony, listened to him, when Steve wouldn’t. He shouldn’t hold it against her. He’s glad Tony had a friend who was worthy of him. He just can’t abide her sympathy, which he doesn’t deserve, and right now he can’t stand her company, either.
He’s struck by the idle thought that he and Steve could talk about guns, since Tony knows guns, too. Maybe use it as a starting point to talking about the war and the haunted expressions that sometimes cloud Steve’s face. But then Tony can’t think of the name of a single model of firearm, or when he last used one, or why so many details about propellants and rapid exothermic combustion leap to the front of his mind. So he kisses Steve instead.
for one thing
if you’re hurt or something you’re in big trouble
“I’m guessing you two didn’t talk about the massive boner you have for him,” Sam says, like he’s trying to be causal and mild but his shit-eating grin is peeking out the edges.
Spencer snorts. “Tell me about it.”
