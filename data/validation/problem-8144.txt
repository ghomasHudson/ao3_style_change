The blinds close as soon as Rogers gets into the room.
After a battle, Tony flies home Steve and Steve only – he never took anyone else with him. They go to public events together. They occasionally eat dinner together, somewhere. They…
Next to him, Steve coughs again.
He can’t think of what to say.
The future is going to be gay.
They get as far as removing their own shirts when the only thing Tony couldn’t possibly plan against happens.
“And yet I only made it stronger. You were the one— the
Tony’s heart is hammering so loud he’s afraid Steve will be able to hear it and realize everything.
It’s Steve Rogers that he wants to learn all about, though.
The worst kind of hurt, for men like Stark, didn’t come from just some deaths – not even from those of his own family. The man had too much blood on his hands to give a shit about something as simple as death.
If Steve doesn’t stop talking about forever, he might start to believe it.
meant to be romantic, after all.
The original plan was to take Steve to the nearest closed room and ravish him, but having Steve this close in a deserted hallway makes the plan adjust.
So, he allowed himself to be selfish once again –
. “Ten minutes,” he agrees.
Steve grips his shoulders in a strong vice and moves Tony’s entire body in front of the punching bag. His Cosmo splashes all over his hand. Tony can’t find it in himself to care.
Tony is hyper-aware of Steve’s every movement, so he doesn’t miss the way Steve’s cheeks color and the way he takes a little breath, barely a moment before saying, “Sorry,” voice scarcely a whisper.
“No trouble at all, I love cooking,” Steve says, then takes a hand to the back of his neck as his smile turns sheepish. “And yeah, I did. I figured you’d be hungry by now.”
– although he didn’t need one.
He’s afraid Steve is going to hear the beating of his heart.
But then, screaming turned to sarcastic remarks, and remarks led to teasing, and before Tony knew, they became friends. They became close friends. The teasing acquired a playful note, and Tony’s sexual desire paved the way to an accelerated heartbeat around Steve, and to the stupid impulse to grab Steve’s hand, or to fall asleep on his chest and wake up next to him.
Steve’s voice is firm, but his body inches closer to Tony’s, effectively trapping him between Steve’s body and the punching bag. His eyes are heated and hard, hands still on Tony’s shoulder, and that’s going to get painful real soon.
Now if everything is going south, it’s no one’s fault but Tony’s.
do it.
Tony never had a chance to resist him.
When they hear a shriek coming from the elevator, they jostle apart, Tony immediately sitting up and willing his face not to blush, Steve blushing deep red and trying to get his hair in order –
Besides, it’s not like Tony isn’t already vibrating off his skin at the very thought of it.
sneak out for a while, go to the nearest closed room, and it would be easy. They would come back before people noticed they were missing. They could get away with it.
He can still taste him in his mouth.
The kiss is perfect and too short at the same time, and when Steve pulls away and whispers, “Let’s go to bed,” Tony only steals another peck before he collects his notebook and pencil, and gets up.
It's now basically canon that Tony made the stealth suit to show off Mr. Rogers' ass. (Not that we didn't know that already.)
Tony doesn’t try to dance properly. He’s perfectly content with wobbling a little to the soft, muffled words of the song. It’s talking about how the love of his life makes the singer feel brand new, and Tony would become the world’s best vocalist just to sing it to Steve the way he deserves.
Sometimes, though, Stark’s blinds are closed – like now.
If that is all he’s ever gonna get from Steve, he’s glad he can at least imprint the sight of it into his memory. Another thing that will forever be burned into his brain.
love him, so much his heart and mind hurt, so he murmurs, “I love you.”
His first reaction is to ask
Tony kisses him in reply.
Not moving from the fireplace, Tony turns around. As imagined, Steve is sitting on the couch. He’s smiling at him, has a book in his hands, a blanket on his legs, and there are two cups of steaming hot chocolate on the table next to him. “Welcome back, honey,” Steve says, still smiling.
Tony tilts his head and watches him in return, and his breath catches yet again.
Tony’s heart jumps in his throat like it’s never going to find peace again.
Then Tony gets on his tiptoes and kisses Steve’s mouth.
When Steve’s brain decides to clear out, the first person he properly see, crouching down next to him, is… not his Tony’s.
Unfortunately, Tony knows these types of people. They want to thrive in their harem of equal-shitty-but-less-powerful men, they want to soak up attention and bask in compliments, but only in the sleazy manners that they’re used to.
, Tony can relate to that.
! In the mornings, they don’t arrive for breakfast together.
Tony’s heart lurches in his throat.
Sometimes, Tony wonders whether Steve is even able to express emotions through something other than violence.
The man in front of him is smaller than him, has blonde hair, and is holding a deep blue mask in front of his azure eyes— Tony doesn’t recognize him.
Tony lets Steve’s cock pop out of his mouth with a lewd sound and looks right up at him. “You should put your hands in my hair, I like that.”
One year spent deciding the best way to bring the Avengers apart, against all hope.
“No.”
That’s something he would have never, ever,
Tony doesn’t even notice.
Tony stifles a sigh, before turning back.
Then Steve puts his hands in Tony’s hair, and just like that, Tony melts and whimpers.
“Oh c’mon, Steve—” Tony cuts in, cheeks still flushed. He looks at his Steve. “Don’t be rude to your nicer counterpart.”
“You’re so
“Villains should really aim for your legs and that’s it, I don’t understand why they don’t think of that,” Tony mumbles, and at that, Steve just has to laugh.
(They say alcohol is good for wounds anyway.)
Tony smiles as Steve turns to face him. He sips his Cosmo as his other hand moves to Steve’s abdomen. He feels every single muscle of his six-pack as he brushes his hand up, lingering on Steve’s pecs before sliding up his neck.
Thinking about art, something else crosses his mind. “Oh!” He exclaims. Steve looks a little startled, by the sudden burst of energy. “I just remembered! We were searching for a new cartoonist, the last time I talked with Pepper. Couldn’t have been more than two weeks ago… We are probably still looking.” Tony feels like he just defeated the most insurmountable obstacle and is now holding in his hands the latest artifact he spent over a month looking for. “You should bring your portfolio to Marvels headquarters. I can put in a good word for you,” he says, smiling encouragingly.
Steve smirks. “Sometimes you’re awfully slow, for being a genius,” he says. He laughs a little at Tony’s indignant face – and right before Tony can protest, he pecks him on the lips. “Yes, really. I don’t remember the last time I looked at you and didn’t feel the urge to kiss you or hold you in my arms.” Tony’s heart threatens to beat right out of his chest as Steve strokes a thumb on his chin, inching up to brush his mouth. Tony parts his lips involuntarily, and Steve’s eyes go dark, zeroing in on his mouth in the fraction of a second. He brushes Tony’s lower lip for a moment, before consciously stopping and looking back up. “After last night, after knowing what being with you – albeit just for show – feels like, I just knew I couldn’t go back. I wanted everything you’d want to give me. Hence, the whole—” He gestures at the table.
He decides to pick the most pressing reason, so he says, “Thank you for saving my life.”
that, no point in repeating yourself, Steve.
The man smiles. “For someone who wants to hide, you definitely stand out,” he says.
It’s a leap of faith – but once you jump, you cannot go back.
The man bites his lip. To his surprise, Tony finds that he wouldn’t mind if they talked a little bit more.
The things Steve does to him, really.
Steve has a body built by the gods. Nobody seems to appreciate it enough.
He manages to bring Steve up with gentle pushes on the back of Steve’s head, and Tony looks at him in the eyes before leaning up to kiss him. Steve closes his eyes, he’s gentle, and Tony keeps looking at his eyelashes in wonder. Lips against lips and warm, content feelings are Tony’s only focus.
Tony shivers at that, his own free hand sliding up on Steve’s hip without Tony consciously moving it. Steve is wearing Col. Littleton suspenders over his shirt, the jacket of the suit handed over at the reception along with his coat, and Tony has to struggle not to let his hand wander, feeling the muscles beneath Steve’s formal attire. Given how soft the fabric is, he’s sure he would be able to feel Steve’s six-pack even through clothes, and it’s not a risk he wants to take tonight.
Wow, the
– and being happy had always felt more like a dream rather than a real possibility. No, it’s always been about the perfect, idealistic, pure person that somehow chose to love the broken mess he is. It’s always been about Steve.
At that, Steve’s breath catches in his throat. Tony tries to stop the umpteenth shiver at the thought of making Steve Rogers lose some of his cool while working.
Jarvis diminishes the brightness of the blue and adds some gray here and there. Tony is still not a hundred percent satisfied. “Remove the red, please.”
Tony has never been strong; the name of his first weakness— Steve Rogers.
Steve looks absolutely delighted. “Long before last night,” he supplies. Tony nods, before realizing Steve is talking about himself. “Me too.”
“Steve,” he protests weakly. He makes no attempts at effectively stopping him, though, so Steve doesn’t stop: his mouth moves from his neck to the hollow of his neck, to each clavicle, and he kisses his way down, and Tony whimpers. “You’re a menace.”
He should have known better. Steve knows him better than most people – heck, he’s probably the person who knows him better than everyone else.
When it’s over, Tony enlarges the blueprints in natural size, then takes a step back to admire the suit.
With five different calls to Assemble and the constant raining, it has been one of the toughest weeks Tony and Steve have had in their years as Avengers.
Steve turns to look at him, biting his lower lips, and smiles. “Of course I am. Might take a little, but I promise I’ll be back as soon as Tony’s fixed the watch, and villains decide to let us free for the weekend.” Tony smiles at that. “I’ll see if my Tony can come, too.”
. The world can’t try to implode twice in a day. There’s gotta be some cosmical law about it.
“Yes” was the word he was itching for Stark to hear.
“5.45pm, Sir,” Jarvis replies.
When the orchestra is ready for the first verse, Tony and Steve are ready to take the first step of what looks like is going to be a very romantic Foxtrot.
Tony closes his eyes, leans closer and kisses him. Steve sighs and kisses him back, the hand that was holding his chin now tangling up in his hair. Tony moans softly into his mouth, melting against Steve’s chest. This is his personal addiction, it has been for a few years now, and he never wants to go back.
He takes the head in his mouth and starts sucking and licking, as if trying to coax as many droplets of precome out of him as possible. Steve’s fingers tighten in his hair as he visibly tries not to buck his hips forward, and that makes Tony moan around Steve’s member.
They seem… arguing? No, that’s not properly arguing, Steve decides. The tones are— worried, maybe, excited? Scared? One is strong and sure about what he’s saying. Steve doesn’t know what he’s talking about – it’s all a bit blurred around the edges, still. But the sound of it penetrates his foggy mind as he blinks a couple of times, focusing slowly, almost like an old camera lens.
“I think Cap and I are going to call it a night, guys,” Tony says, and his voice is slightly rougher, and that would be embarrassing, had Tony any resemblance of shame left. “Have a good night and Merry Christmas again.”
Natasha’s words come back to his mind, her tone somewhat more smug than how he remembered. “
to let down your guard?” he asks, appalled. “You know, that’s the perfect moment when a supervillain would strike – when you lower your shield and decide to trust him. That’s pure tactical mind, and here I thought you were the tactical one—”
“Tony,” Steve rasps, and Tony’s breath hitches.
This is another make-pretend. This is just— two Avengers, trying to throw a bad guy in jail. That’s all this is.
His expression is so similar to his Tony’s that he doesn’t even think before saying, “Gosh, you’re magnificent.”
, talk about dreams coming true!
Steve didn’t intend for the whole setting to be romantic, surely, Tony chastises himself. No need to indulge in these ridiculous thoughts.
Unfortunately, blessings on that evening could be counted on the fingers of one hand. They made little to no progress with their plan yet, first because they haven’t been able to spot Immortus so far, and second because Tony is unsure when their act should begin, to be credible when they do meet the guy.
Tony blushes as he remembers the feeling of Steve’s lips against his, Steve’s mouth swollen with kisses, his strong hands keeping him close, or sliding down his body—
Tony almost laughs at the irony of it.
– why would Steve do that? But it’s not like he never brought Tony some food down in his lab – in fact, it was quite common he did that, especially if Tony was going through one of his inventing spirals and lost every cognition of time. Besides, it’s rude to ask the reason behind someone doing something nice for you, Tony’s fairly sure. Ninety-percent sure.
They didn’t part on the best of terms – Tony acted pretty childish; he is man enough to admit that. It’s just that… Last night was a lot.
(Everyone sees the news. Everyone's watched clips of him breaking his own buddy’s face with his fists. Derek’s not going to risk it.)
When Steve agreed to take part in this plan, Tony had been surprised. He thought it was going to be him and Clint, or him and Thor if he was lucky.
Inspired from Avengers: Endgame.
“So?” Steve urges him, and Tony sighs.
His mouth is open, but no sounds come out. Everything is drowned by the cries.
If Tony wasn’t in love before, he would be now.
Set post Avengers (2012).
, and Tony was always this close to just slamming Steve against the nearest wall and kissing the living daylight out of him.
Tony immediately doesn’t like that look.
Tony feels his arms being lifted. At the same time, he feels Steve’s intake of breath and almost senses Steve’s chest expansion, right next to him.
Yeah, that’s quintessential Tony Stark.
How could Steve still think that? “No bother at all,” Tony says honestly. He smiles.
Thus, Tony cups Steve’s face and kisses him, giving in to everything he’s been dreaming about of doing for the better part of the day. Steve’s mouth immediately parts under Tony’s, allowing their lips to slide together and taste each other.
In response, Steve quirks up an eyebrow as if to say,
Tony closes his eyes at the touch. There’s nowhere else he would rather be. “No, it’s okay. It’s probably going to be a long night and I wouldn’t be of much company.”
Jan is trilling next to Pepper and him, and Tony lets the words run as soothing background noise. All around them are people holding their masks up by the stick and swapping them around, clearly to compliment the choice of the mask of the person they are speaking to.
Tony is calmer, but his heart still hasn’t returned to a regular rhythm. He takes his own arms around Steve and holds him, tight, like he’s everything that keeps him anchored to reality.
The words go straight to Tony’s cock, and he moans aloud.
Steve’s overwhelmed with fondness. He wants nothing more than just hold this Tony in his arms and never let him go, protect him from everything and everyone, forever.
He should focus on Steve’s words. He’s doing his best to teach him some of the team’s fight moves, some of the ‘gut instinct’ that let him defeat the Adaptoid, and Tony should be grateful and repay him with attention. It’s the least he can do.
Steve holds him as he kisses him thoroughly. It’s filthy, Tony’s positive he tastes of come, but if Steve’s cool, then Tony’s cool too.
But the nails come back, and his head starts bleeding again.
When he reaches the main floor, the smell of roast beef makes his stomach rumble.
Just a moment later, voices start to fill up his ears. Two voices, to be precise, both of them male, both of them with a heavy New York cadence – yet so different from each other.
, crisscross their legs in alternated hooks as if led solely by desire. It’s natural, easier than the other dances – it’s all instincts, it’s less performing basic steps, and more learned response after provocation.
Steve relaxes under his touch and Tony slides his hand down Steve’s back, savoring the curve of each muscle under his palm. He resolutely ignores the infinitesimal part of his brain that is disappointed.
It’s just— There are just a couple of hiccups. One tiny hiccup, really.
As he passes next to Steve to leave for the bedroom, he feels the blinding urge to reach out and cup Steve’s face to kiss him goodbye.
Tony notices the crowd has basically dissipated when they complete the first round of the dance floor with no one getting in the way.
“That’s not your faul—” Steve interrupts him, but Tony is nothing but determined. “And it was me who lost my temper in debrief over nothing.”
, the things he would let Steve do to him. The things he would do to Steve. All kinds of things that would involve him and Steve doing the do, honestly. Tony is this close to losing it.
He wonders where Steve has learned how to dance, and why. Maybe it was a way of passing time in the war. He’ll have to ask him.
Eventually, Steve lets go of Tony’s arms. Tony instantaneously misses the warmth of his hands – but that’s okay, because Steve is still next to him, and Tony is grateful.
Nevertheless, Tony’s hand is still on Steve’s hip and he’s at his third drink, and they just
This is going to go either extremely well for their plan, or extremely badly.
“You’re coming back, right?” Tony asks him.
Tony freezes.
It takes Tony all but a handful of seconds, and when he’s satisfied, he grins at Steve.
He should’ve remembered to order Jarvis to lock the living room. It’s unfortunate how his brain becomes mono-tasking, when… otherwise occupied. With Steve.
“Can I have one too, please?” comes a small voice from Tony’s back.
“It’s okay, Tony. I’m okay.” Steve’s voice is in his ear, and Tony shivers. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
Tony wouldn’t admit it out loud, but he looks forward to cuddling as well.
Steve squares his shoulders. He already figured Tony still has a way of making this work, Tony guesses. He isn’t wrong.
The minute he spends rushing to his car manages to freeze Tony deep to the bone, and he spends the whole drive to the Tower shivering and shifting. Not even the pre-heated seats and warm AC can stop the tremors in his body.
Tony barely has time to register the burst of happiness on Steve’s face, before he’s on him, kissing him within an inch of his life.
Steve smiles. “We will, I promise. N—”
Tony puts his mouth on him and kisses his covered length. Steve moans like he’s being strangled – and the sound goes straight to Tony’s dick.
After the movie, they go to the main tree in order to open their presents at midnight, as per tradition. Someone suggested doing a Secret Santa on the first year, but after a smart comment made by Tony, they decided everyone would get presents for everyone, and that rule hasn’t changed.
Today is no different. Derek knows what’s gonna happen a few minutes from there: Rogers is gonna come out and look fucked out, and Derek’s gonna pretend he doesn’t know Rogers was in there
He could probably crack a joke – that’d be easy. But he just doesn’t feel like it, especially not after last night, after everything that happened at the gala, after the way he behaved in debrief.
Tony isn’t used to this.
Steve stops stalking and smiles shyly, curling up a little on himself.
A shiver runs through his body. Tony’s eyebrows shoot up with incredulity, because he honestly
could use that information for their own advantage.
It’s one of the perks of working at SHIELD: he wouldn’t admit it out loud, but there’s something quite… stimulating, about being privy to most of Stark’s day. He could see every twitch of his eyebrows as he focuses, every barely-suppressed sigh, every smile and every frown. He could count how many steps he takes when he’s uncertain about something, and could almost make out every word when he’s arguing with someone.
freaking out?”
He looks up through his lashes and the angle makes his stomach twists fiercely. Steve is looking down at him with hazy eyes and his lower lip between his teeth.
“I wish it was,” Tony huffs.
He finds Steve looking at him with wonder in his eyes.
He’s saved his life so many times in the field.
They should probably get up, but the thought of moving away doesn’t even tempt him.
The kitchen is blessedly empty when he gets there.
They might be undercover, but inappropriate touches remain as such, no matter the circumstances.
The sound of laughter bring Tony back to the people in front of him. Jan and Pepper are both looking at him as their hilarity dies down.
A slight nudge on the right side of his mask, and Tony is ready to go.
Tony finishes the drink with a face, before chasing another waiter to get another drink. When he makes his way back to Steve, he eyes up the drink in Tony’s hand and his face twists into his best Disapproving Glare. “Tony…” he begins.
Tony doesn’t really get how that is
“The sentiment is mutual, Steve,” Tony replies just as quietly. Then he smiles a little and says, “I would always save your life, too. Always.”
The flutter in his stomach comes back stronger than before, and this time Tony gets very close to blushing.
They can’t ignore a call to Assemble – well, they
“The only thing we’ll succeed in is wasting time that could be spent in a very different way.”
Steve brings his right arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him closer. He’s leaning on the open doorway, the night wind soothing their tuxedoed bodies with fresh air. Tony feels warm and happy right there at Steve’s side, as though his life couldn’t get better than this.
But tonight, Tony is fairly sure things are going to be fine. It’s a rainy day in the middle of November and there’s no indication that anything unusual might happen in the near future.
Clint stares at the scene in front of him, Tony and Steve still bickering, still very much close to each other, and the realization hits him like a full-speed train.
He opens his mouth and lets Steve deepen the kiss, offering his lips and tongue and soul up for Steve to claim, to take, to mess up.
“I wonder how she refrained to comment thought,” Tony says, a smirk still on his face. His hand still hasn’t left Steve’s chest.
of Tony Stark is compressed in a smaller version of the man he loves. He’s absolutely mesmerized.
Tony has a strong sense of deja-vu as he’s pinned on the door and Steve presses into him with his whole body. Every point of contact with Steve’s body on fire. His lips tingle and his head is pressed firmly to the door as he lets Steve maul him, his hands everywhere and not where he
“How are you so calm?” he blurts out. As always, his brain and his mouth work together to make him die of embarrassment. Tony curses himself silently and takes another sip, trying to appear put together, despite the question.
It was a
“It’s much more fashionable,” Jan replies. “I had the best time designing mine and Miss Potts’ one. You just love to be the eccentric, marvelous Tony Stark.” Her words are without malice, and Tony laughs.
But Tony doesn’t think about the kissing sounds the Avengers must be hearing through their mics. He doesn’t think about Immortus watching, or any of the guests either, for that matter. Tony doesn’t think at all.
The moment between them is broken, the slight tension Immortus left behind the only thing lingering around them. Tony slides his hand off Steve’s hip and takes a step back. He allows himself to mourn the loss of Steve’s hand on him for just for a moment, before sighing.
Predictably, Steve is an amazing dancer.
All he can think about is tasting it.
“Please let’s?” Tony asks.
Tony is about to shake his head at Steve, when he notices Steve’s gaze.
“And Thor always drops his guard, like that,” Steve says as he lowers a little, in order to demonstrate his words. Tony is finding it pretty hard to focus on the tactics and moves. He swirls the pencil in his hands as he notes down what Steve’s saying, but his mind is elsewhere.
Steve gently cups his hand on Tony’s face. “C’m’here,” he mumbles, and Tony goes willingly. His knees are wobbly as he stands up and wipes with one hand the excess of come from his chin.
“Exactly.” Tony nods. “We have to be quicker, blunter. Not exaggerating, but it’s not a marathon anymore.”
to keep his job.
Then Tony realizes their Avengers alarm didn’t go off. It’s Jarvis, so that means… “I’m sorry to interrupt, but there’s been a major security breach at Stark International.” Tony groans. “Ms. Potts is waiting for you on the phone, she’s already heading there. She sounds… apprehensive.”
Which stands for catastrophically worried.
, Tony knows. He also knows he is going to vibrate right off his skin.
He’s tempted to start researching everyone again, but another rumble of his stomach makes him decide to get something to eat, and then have some shut eye.
He knew Steve Rogers knew about the death of Tony Stark’s parents. He also knew he hadn’t told him.
, just like that, Tony can’t think.
Tony tries not to think about how that same voice was calling his name just the previous night. He tries, but it’s really, really difficult not to.
Tony swears under his breath. If he’s going to spend Christmas Day with a cold – or worse, a
Tony is not a sane person.
He sips his Martini Dry while he returns to Steve, noticing with a surprise that he, too, has a drink in his hand. Tony feels a fraction better. Maybe he isn’t the only one nervous.
Steve lowers his gaze and shakes his head, like he thinks Tony is only saying that to make him feel better, but he knows better.
without even saying it out loud.
He didn’t think it when Steve got on his knee and honest-to-god asked him to spend the rest of their lives together, because life – especially for them – was too unpredictable and risky not to live every single minute like their last.
“I couldn’t have done it without you and your tech.” Steve’s voice is firm, like he’s trying to prove a point. Steve’s hands are caressing his back, his shoulders, and then sliding up his neck until they’re holding his face.
Immortus is disgusting, and Tony is absolutely ready to shove him in a cell and throw away the key.
Tony’s heart starts hammering in his chest again. It shouldn’t come as a surprise anymore, but Tony still manages to be caught off-guard by the kindness Steve keeps showing him. He supposes that will never change.
Tony smiles and bumps his forehead against Steve’s. “I love you too, Steve.”
“It’s a 400-metre dash,” Steve concludes.
It’s a flash thought, but irrationally, Tony hopes they could keep doing this. Dancing, being close to each other to the point of casual touches;
, alright, and he can’t comprehend how anyone with a brain could disagree with him. He’s the scientist, he
He’d discovered, later on, that the very leaders of the group that brushed off the death of his family as a “casualty” were intimate with each other.
Tony silently agrees. Instead, he says, “That’s because you’ve never seen him in action, J. He could do better, trust me.”
He can’t wait to tell his Tony all about this. He’s sure even him would become smitten as soon as he’d land his eyes on tiny Tony.
Steve lets him go and smiles at the other’s face. It’s a mixture of shock and uncertainty, and Steve nods at him.
make me feel brand new, Tony. I’m old, I’m ancient, and yet you never make me feel like that. You make me feel alive.”
Seconds or minutes of pure bliss pass, the kiss has shifted to small little pecks all over their mouths, and Tony feels giddy with happiness. He feels like a teenager.
He knows the answer anyway, Tony figures.
In the silence of the room, Tony can almost hear the beating of his own heart.
So the thing is, Tony is really wound up, and it’s all Steve’s fault.
He focuses on the scene in front of him, trying to decide what’s the best smartass comeback he could pull off. Their tit for tat is not hard to follow, so that’s not slows to a stop his attempt to reply.
Steve took the first step, actively sparing Tony from further worrying about the plan, but exposing him to a whole new category of overthinking.
one who realized how to take it down.”
“Yeah, it’s my shield, I’m not going to battle without it.”
“I remember the rain had caused the picture to blur a little. I was so fascinated by those unintentional shadows, that I had to pick up a charcoal and a sheet of paper. That was the first time I drew something. Of course it was going to be you,” Steve adds quietly. His eyes are lost for one moment, then he catches Tony’s eyes in his and continues. “I drew over and over again, and then one more time. I tried to replicate the exact picture, down to the faintest shadow. It took me two days, but I did it. I was so excited, I started trying different techniques, playing with the shadows… I think I still have the first page of that newspaper.”
They each take a step back – and Tony has to stop focusing on how much he misses Steve’s heat already and start focusing on whether Coulson might have any kind of problem getting this – and Tony turns towards the host.
He needed Steve in bed with him
When the debrief ends, Tony gets up and leaves the room before anyone else manages to stand up. He doesn’t look at any of them, least of all Steve, and heads straight for the workshop.
“Aww baby, what’s the rush?” Tony asks him, still joking. Steve stiffens next to him at the nickname. He brings his hand around Tony’s waist and pulls him just a tiny bit closer.
He smiles at her, then dips his head, excusing himself from the ladies as he sees two men approaching them.
Silence stretched in the Siberian room for the sweetest seconds.
The other man’s cheeks color just a tad more. Tony is enthralled. “Yes, it really does.” The man’s words are quieter than before. He doesn’t lower his gaze after he speaks, so Tony doesn’t either.
He looks so debauched, Tony almost falls to his knees right there and then.
But right now, nobody is joining them on the dance floor for a Foxtrot. Tony can hardly blame them – it’s not a very common dance.
He finds he doesn’t care at all.
Steve Rogers has been his friend for the better part of two years now. He’s a normal human being, with his values, virtues and flaws. Tony has learned a lot about Steve during these two years – how he prefers his coffee in the morning right after his morning run, how he likes to take out his frustration on the reinforced punching bags in the gym, how he’d rather stew in silence and misery than ask for help. It’s a whole other process, discovering little things about him; very different from what learning everything he could about Captain America has been.
Steve’s catching up. “We just have to up the pace.”
screwed.
Tony tries to catch his breath as he realizes he made it through a damn Foxtrot with Steve, without ever rehearsing it beforehand. He feels a surge of pride at that. There couldn’t have been two better people for this job, honestly.
He spent over one entire year planning this. Crying, screaming, wishing he was dead. Listening to the voice mails, to the last things left of his wife. Of his family. All of them, dead, because of those who were supposed to protect the world.
Wait a second. He looks at other Steve, standing next to Tony and looking so much bigger than him. Is this Tony really—?
Tony can’t help it. Like a moth to a flame, Steve is irresistible for him, and Tony finds himself holding Steve’s head and kissing him with intent, music forgotten in his ears, alongside with the crowd and the mission and his own name.
A much bigger part of him, though, is genuinely curious. “Say, gentleman, what is it that you mean?” he asks the man, returning the smile with an ease he thought had abandoned him, at least for the evening.
He couldn’t do it, not really – he couldn’t rely on his forces alone. More powerful men than him had tried without succeeding. No, he needed something else.
The impulse is harder to fight than the urge to kiss him.
When Steve brushes Tony’s cheek with his hand, Tony opens his eyes with the tiniest sliver of hope.
“I just don’t want to scar our teammate here. We need all of them sharp and focused.”
Steve’s only answer is to smile.
okay.
“What did I miss?” Tony asks, smiling. Their good mood is contagious.
The trip to the main living room is quick.
When he’s close enough to count the droplets of sweat on Steve’s back, Tony rolls the dice and puts a hand on Steve’s bare shoulder.
“Oh thank God,” Clint sighs, standing up. He’s so ready to leave that kitchen.
He can feel the others’ curiosity, but he knows they won’t ask – so he decides to sort of answer the unasked question anyway. “So if you have any questions about this, I’ll try to answer them myself. For the specific ones,” he looks at Tony again, “I’ll gladly take them to my Tony, and we can try to come back here together – so you can geek out all you want,” he finishes, smiling.
Steve nods. “Yeah, that bothered me too. Fury believes Immortus never considered us guests; just snoopers. I think Immortus wasn’t quite as ‘low threat’ as we believed, but it’s over now. He’s accused of attempted second-degree murder. Don’t worry about it now,” he finishes.
When he feels Steve relax under his mouth and kissing back more eagerly, Tony opens his eyes and breaks the kiss and takes a good look of Steve.
“Coming, Jarvis,” Tony says. He pouts at Steve, which elicits a laugh out of the super-soldier.
“Mr. Stark, may I have this dance?”
Tony’s breath hitches. “Really?” He can’t help but ask, amazed.
Tony’s never been happier to have taken part in a mission. He drinks in Steve’s flushed cheeks and his kiss-swollen lips again. He feels like walking on sunshine.
Tony frowns. That’s way past lunchtime. “Why didn’t you wake me up for lunch?” Steve must have decided to eat by himself after all.
Improvisation. They’re always good at that. Have been since the very first time they fought the Chitauri together.
“That’s not true,” Steve says, and this time he’s sitting straight and looking at Tony right in the eyes. “It wasn’t ‘nothing’, and you know it.
Steve feels his heart burst. He takes him in and squeezes him hard, feeling Tony missing a beat in his arms and hugging him back just as strongly. Steve loves the feeling of dwarfing Tony like that, and if he holds on for more than necessary, chests pressing together and hands stroking all over his back, well, you can’t really blame him.
When Steve calms down, he lets Steve’s dick slip off – but not before kissing the head one last time – and looks up at him.
When he gets to the living room, he all but sprints to the lit-up fireplace. He groans when he gets close enough, fingers almost brushing the flames and face heating up with warmth.
He knows kissing is more comfortable in bed anyway, especially when it leads to something else afterwards.
He desperately hopes Steve won’t notice how much meaning there is behind his every movement.
he thinks, light-headed. He's finally happy.
Being the focus of Steve’s desire is heady and every bit as thrilling as the night before, if not more. Arousal courses through Tony’s body and he grows hard in his pants, but he ignores it to keep kissing Steve. He has all he wants in his arms already; everything else is trivial.
The man must have been observing him for a long time. It’s nothing short of flattering. He wonders how old the man is – his earnestness and gentle features reminds him of past years, of his energy and innocence right before he decided he wanted to live his life going on adventures, in search for mysteries.
, thank you very much.
Tony wants it all, so much it hurts.
“Hey, are you okay?” Steve sounds mildly concerned.
What he didn’t foresee, though, is that such high-quality materials were going to be pressed together and feel incredibly soft, molding perfectly to their frame like a second skin, and leaving nothing to the imagination.
Tony would give up his fortune for him.
Maybe they should have practiced in the limo.
Now they’re in the ballroom, after shaking hands with only a few people. It’s a blessing, considering the type of characters around them.
Tony is sure this is not going to end well, and he can’t even say why. He can’t label the sensation, but the itch is there and he can’t quite scratch it, no matter how hard he tries.
He grumpily looks out of the windows as he waits for the traffic light to turn green. The streets are full of people trying to squeeze in some last-minute gift shopping. New York City has never been more alive.
They don’t even step away from each other. Clint rolls his eyes hard.
Steve’s hand tightens on his side as his eyes find something in Tony’s and mirth leaves his expression. His eyes darken and his lips part, and it’d take a far stronger man than Tony to prevent his gaze from dropping to those lips.
Tony closes his eyes and rests his head on Steve’s chest. He deeply inhales the scent so unique to his husband and feels at home.
God, he just can’t help himself, can he?
He stands corrected from what he thought earlier – Steve is not a professional dancer. Professional dance is supposed to show emotions without any personal involvement, every touch carefully measured.
“I’ll tell you what I
frequent,” Steve says, his practiced smile never leaving his face. After saying so, Steve slides his free hand around Tony’s waist again, tugging him that much closer.
Steve moans into his mouth. The sound goes straight towards Tony’s lower body, and he curses himself for not being as young anymore. He bites Steve’s lip in reply, and this elicits another moan. Tony is in trouble; he’s addicted to those sounds and those lips, and he doesn’t want them to stop.
Tony is a little jealous of his innocence, in a way that makes him well-disposed towards him. He smiles a little. “You’re quite right, although there is no lady in sight for me.” He deliberately pauses. He doesn’t ask the man why he came and talked to him if he thought Tony wanted to be alone. He just waits a couple of seconds, in which he figures the man must be asking himself that very question.
Hence, the dinner and flowers. So it
It’s not his finest moment, but Tony has waited a long time to do this. There will be time for finesse later.
Instead, Steve
Steve feels a bit sorry for them. He doesn’t even remember a time when he and his Tony weren’t together, but he can’t imagine his life without him, without being able to kiss him and hold him whenever and however he wants. He’s such a constant and a big part of his life, Steve feels empty on behalf of other Steve and not-his-Tony.
Steve kisses him briefly before leaning away, just to be able to look at him in the eyes. “You sound pornographic when you come.”
.” He beams at him.
Tony nods. It feels weird, knowing that Steve is privy of this trivial little thing. It makes him feel open, like Steve might just peer inside him and it would be enough for him to discover his deepest secret.
Steve smiles too, and Tony’s world lights up that bit more just like that.
Tony is nothing if not determined, though.
Steve is writhing under Tony, hands roaming all over his body, and Tony shudders at the sensations. He’s fully hard in his pants, almost-public place be damned. He feels victorious as he steals kiss after kiss, as he tastes the inside of Steve’s mouth with his tongue, chasing off any remaining trace of champagne.
“Nat and Clint are on a mission for SHIELD, they should be back in a couple of days. And Bruce is still with Thor in London. Leave it, I can do it,” he adds, as Tony opens the tap to rinse his glass.
“You’re the worst, Rogers,” Tony mutters. When Steve flashes him one of his beautiful smiles, Tony sighs. “You’re also impossible to resist. Come on, let’s go.” He holds out an arm, and Steve takes it. He tries to adjust the tie with the other hand, while Tony snickers – he couldn’t care less about the status of their figures. “Aw baby, don’t worry about that. I like to think people will look at us and
After hours of watching Steve move in that ridiculous suit, Tony can’t really be blamed for breaking.
Tony chases Steve’s mouth for a last, lingering kiss, before they properly break apart.
“Are you going to be around for lunch?” he asks Steve.
To be fair, it’s not
He doesn’t wince when Steve hits the punching bag behind him.
. He doesn’t know much about the man, doesn’t know if he will ever see him again, hell, he doesn’t even know if he will keep the secret of their encounter. And by the way, he should really ask him to keep quiet—
“God, your lips are so red.” Tony is drawn by his mouth. “You look fucking edible.”
If it wasn’t for Steve, Tony would be dead.
His fingers are still stroking the ring – and Steve can
Derek has a perfect view of Director Stark’s office.
The next thing Tony knows is they’re kissing like their lives depend on it. There are tongues and tilting heads, and it’s infinitely hotter than the little peck from before. It has intent, it reeks of want, and Tony doesn’t even have time to worry about how Steve will interpret this, because Steve is kissing him back with the same amount of passion.
Every time, he prides himself in knowing what’s gonna happen as soon as the man gets in Stark’s office: sometimes he can hear soft thuds or muffled moans, or aborted grunts, hell—even the deepest silence is telling. Every time, when he finally comes out, Rogers is equipped with flushed cheeks, disheveled hair and hooded eyes.
Tony ignores the warning and dives deeper on his dick, hollowing his cheek and looking up through his lashes. He doesn’t want to miss Steve’s face when he comes down his throat.
It wasn’t easy. Oh no, he had to bend over backwards to find out that particular piece of information. It went under the almost inaccessible “classified information”, probably because there was a high chance that the
Tony’s oversensitive cock twitches helplessly in his pants, and Tony whimpers. “Fuck.”
Steve smiles. “I could see that. It was painful to watch,” he says, smirking. Tony makes a mock-offended face, and Steve laughs. “In the best way,” he adds. “When I said the total blackness made you stand out, I meant it.”
“Don’t bullshit me Rogers, did you know?”
Therefore, he did his homework. He studied. He figured out a way to take the Avengers apart from within.
He’s not.
“Could you please—”
Were Tony a younger man and had any naivete left in him, he would have blushed. The world showed him so many beauties, but it took quite a few things in return. Naivete is one of them.
Tony sighs, disappointed at how little he managed to find that they didn’t already know. They either kept their dirty business off the internet, or there was nothing more to find. This option worried Tony. If shooting guests was something that didn’t raise a single eyebrow, then…
It’s like a blow to the gut; it leaves him breathless.
“Tony,” Steve whispers on his mouth. He’s still stroking Tony’s cheek— Tony leans into the touch and closes his eyes for a moment, happy.
, because Steve’s right there and he just bared his heart to Tony. Tony kisses him because they’re going to be better than okay, after all.
“It’s not a party, Tony.”
“You didn’t,” Tony says. “If anyone went too far, it’s me.”
Then, three things happen in quick succession.
Tony just waves a hand at him, trying to will down his giggles.
If only he could get hard again.
He feels delirious.
Tony kisses him because he’s in love with him.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice is steady and reassuring, and all Tony wants to do is keep hearing it for the rest of his life.
They slow down to open legs after, the music shifting to a calmer pace, but the song isn’t over yet. Tony circles around Steve’s axis as he follows him with his gaze, heated and ready. Tony feels trapped in Steve’s eyes, like he cannot move, like he cannot breathe without him.
“He says hi, by the way,” Steve continues. “My Tony. He told me to say hi to our ‘awesome counterparts’ and that you would be interested in my GPS-watch,” he finishes, looking at Tony.
Tony smiles what he hopes is his most charming smile. “Pleased to meet you, Mr. Rogers,” he says. He holds out his hand. Tony doesn’t know him— he should really start paying more attention to art. Jan and Pepper would be delighted, too.
He tightens the knot behind his head and turns away from the mirror.
He’s wanted Steve Rogers ever since their very first encounter in Berlin. He just wanted to sleep with him at first— he’s daydreamed about it an embarrassing number of times, especially when they used to argue all the time. And the arguing… Well, the arguing led them into each other’s personal space
“Don’t ever thank me for saving your life,” Steve says. “I will
He doesn’t really blame Pepper for not telling him – he never really asked, and it’s not like he ever expressed much interest in cartoonists, not even when prompted.
It’s no secret Tony is nothing but a slut for all sorts of pain, especially when Steve is in the equation.
(Tony hopes he is a stranger. The contrary would be quite embarrassing.)
Tony is impressed by his boldness. He has to give it to him, Steve’s doing a bang-up job.
Tony is
– he can’t even think about him without scoffing – is in there.
(He could, but he
They keep breathing like this for what feels like hours. Tony is trying to will his heart to beat at a steadier pace, but most of his attention is focused on Steve’s warm body next to him, on his breath on his neck, and warmth is good, warmth means life and it means Steve is still with him, he’s not going to leave, and Tony can breathe a little easier with every second passing.
Steve watches as another man approaches him. He’s blonde, tall and built, and Steve doesn’t need to see the striped shield to understand that’s— himself. A version of himself. This Tony’s Steve.
He leisurely sips a Cosmo of the same shade of red while his eyes caress Steve’s back, muscles flexing as he pounds the reinforced punching bags. He’s wearing only a tight wife-beater and some sweatpants.
Steve’s fault – the circumstances, both past and present, are to blame as well – but if you had to name one person, it would be Steve.
Besides, Steve knows the override codes to get in as he pleases. They were supposed to be for emergencies only, at first, but with time they have sort of evolved into Steve’s free let in whenever Tony forgets to eat and has locked himself in, in order not to be disturbed.
In retrospect, that whole period was quite interesting.
In fact, they’re looking at each other, close – as in, physically close – enough that there’s not even a foot between them, and they’re looking into each other’s eyes and trying to hide their grin as they bicker.
“Tony?”
It’s time to leave them to enjoy the evening.
them at the same time. Tony wants, he
Tony tangles one hand in Steve’s hair and kisses him. For a second or ten, the only sounds in the room are their breathing and the wet brushes of lips on lips. The new knowledge color their kiss with hope and warmth, the melancholy of before that Tony hadn’t realized he was feeling replaced easily, like the night turning into a day.
“But where would the fun
“You have a nice mansion,” Steve replies without missing a beat, chin up and red on his cheeks.
“Hey,” is Clint’s first reaction. Then he hesitates for a moment. He thinks of Nat’s reaction when she’ll know that Clint called dibs on
, alright. Those were just facts. People
Tony would happily follow him everywhere.
They are going to be okay.
Maybe they should have practiced at the Tower – right where they have sofas available, walls, beds, and most importantly, when the only one watching them is Jarvis.
Tony nods. “He should be able to leave as well, provided he sets everything correctly.”
Steve snorts a laugh. “God, you’ve been awake all night, haven’t you? You need to get some sleep,” he says.
He fucked up, bad. He should have done his research properly. He should have been more attentive, should have noticed something was off.
“Your words tiptoe, but your body struts, darling,” Tony says.
Steve sighs. “I wasn’t finished with my workout, Tony.”
The other Steve is chuckling a little. “Oh, so
“Soon,” Steve replies, that’s all Tony can take. He takes his hands to Steve’s chest and shoves him a little, trying to get more room to move.
“It’s
Zemo had watched the Quinjet fly away from Sokovia like nothing happened, and had noticed something the public press didn’t say. He’d noticed Iron Man flying away with Captain America in his arms, and he almost didn’t spare them a thought, in the frenzy days that followed. He remembered watching them and being surprised, before all he could feel was pain, grief, anger.
They’re both leaning on the kitchen counter, engrossed in their conversation like Clint’s not even there. It would be perfectly normal, if they were talking about a new schematic or a new training project.
He’s sure dinner is going to be delicious, even if cold. He doesn’t care one bit. He’s ecstatic Steve feels the same way, and cannot wait to date the hell out of Steve.
That’s why he participated at the ball, Tony figures: every member of his magazine receives an invitation.
Tony closes his eyes and thumps his head against the door, hard. He cannot, for the love of whoever’s out there, believe this.
Eagerness and openness? They are not very fond of those. They’re too pure of values to mean anything for them.
Steve smiles a little. “You know, I’ve always wanted to meet you.” He pauses. He seems meditative for a little. “I had to dream about going on adventures with you, being your best man in the field. I was a very sick kid… Up until three years ago, I used to spend a lot of time in bed. My best friend Arnie and I would buy issues of Marvels Magazine together, because money was tight. We never missed one,” Steve says. He takes a deep breath as if to steady himself, like it’s him who has to steel himself for those words. Like they’re not touching something deep inside Tony.
Steve doesn’t. “I would love to.”
Tony feels delirious.
They stare at each other for a couple of seconds, before Steve blushes. Tony is sure he isn’t faring any better.
“Since when does Steve Rogers drink?” Tony teases. He watches Steve getting closer and closer, stopping only when his body is pressed up to Tony’s right side.
“I’ve wanted to do that for so long,” Tony whispers, eyes trained on Steve’s face to pick up every shift of expression.
His first instinct is to find a bottle of liquor and drink himself into sleep. Luckily for him, he doesn’t have alcohol in the workshop, so he settles on focusing all his attention on research. He digs up everything about Immortus and his gatherings, collecting little information but new names, and then he digs up everything on those names too, and before he knows it, Jarvis is reminding him that he’s been awake for almost twenty-four hours.
“Are you?” Steve asks with mirth. It’s a fair question.
And today has been the happiest day of his life, so he goes all-in.
. “I’m afraid I did let my work get the better of me just there. It’s second nature, I guess – nevertheless, I am sorry.” The man bites his lips. Tony doesn’t stare. “I am an artist. I observe things, and I couldn’t help but notice that…” He trails off. He blinks his eyes up to him, and Tony notices the man’s eyes are at the exact same level as his mouth.
Pull them apart, the others would fall like dead leaves on the ground.
The look in Tony Stark’s eyes was all Zemo needed to see to realize he had succeeded.
Tony smiles up at him as he rubs his head towards Steve’s fingers. He closes his eyes for a moment, enjoying the sensations coming from his head that make him shiver.
Jarvis changes some of the fabric and adjust the colors just so.
“I mean it, Steve, I can’t do it.”
is the lucky one, not the other way around.
“Of course you don’t,” Tony says, morosely. He brings his drink back to his lips and makes a face at the slightly warmed up state of his Martini. “I should’ve known this was going to be a problem,” he mutters.
Steve’s mouth crashes onto him, hard and demanding, his hands sliding up in Tony’s hair, tugging and pulling, and Tony reciprocates blissfully.
Tony nods. “Yeah, that’s probably for the best.”
A blow to Captain America’s face, and just like that, Zemo knew he had succeeded. He’d simply needed to push the first domino card, for the past year to gain meaning. One push, and the death of his family got avenged. One push, and the lives of those murderous vigilantes got crumpled and fell apart. An organization, hurt to its core. One heart, broken.
He wants to fall asleep next to Steve, and wake up to the sight of him in his bed.
“I can’t believe of all the people who would figure it out,
Steve’s chanting his name in a rough voice, and Tony doubles his efforts on his quest of making Steve come.
Hardly anyone has ever been this kind to him. With Steve, Tony feels like he matters. Steve actually
“Yes.”
The mask is heavy on the right side because of the black rose and long feathers embellishing that side. Jan insisted on trying out some of her new designs at the masquerade ball tonight. That’s why Tony has a rigid mask with elaborate lace patterns, and polished, shiny quartz circling the opening for the eyes. The petals of the rose are made of tulle and the center is mostly satin, and behind the flower, three long feathers stand out and curve slightly near the end.
He takes a sip of his drink – pointedly ignoring Steve’s incredulous expression – before talking. “It’s a habit!” He protests. “I’ll hold onto this one, another one
Jarvis silently adjust the model of the suit like Tony demands. Tony twists it a little, working on every angle and manually tightening the suit’s measurements where doable.
Tony represses a sigh of frustration. He gives a longing look at the bed, then stands on his tiptoes to steal another kiss from Steve’s lips.
Steve steals another kiss before stepping away. “Ten minutes tops.”
Unlike the previous dances, tango is based on passionate body-on-body contact.
of him. He wishes he could have him under himself, those gorgeous eyes staring up at him as he takes in every detail of his body. He wishes to kiss him, and it’s a fierce urge, like nothing he’s felt before, and Tony is left breathless for a moment.
The Tower temperature is not high enough to warm Tony up, so he rushes to the elevator and doesn’t even take a detour to his bedroom to lose the jacket first.
Tony’s head is spinning at the fact that he can
Sometimes, when Steve is immersed in his training, he gets lost in his own head and doesn’t hear Tony’s approach. Steve’s knee-jerk reaction to someone startling him is punching the other person square in the face.
Steve laughs, head thrown back and all.
The sound of the orchestra starting to play again startles them both to their surroundings. Tony looks around, finding Immortus at the corner of his vision, and exhales with relief. The plan is still on – and it does seem that they’ve made progress, if the way Immortus is tensed up is anything to go by.
Neither does Steve, if the way he tenses is anything to go by. “You would be surprised by the circles we
Tony seems shaken back to reality as he blinks a couple of time. “Uh, yes! That’s not what allows you to be here though, am I right?”
It’s an irresistible spectacle; one of Tony’s favorites.
Steve and Tony’s job is to get him as worked up as possible in a semi-public environment where he can’t do anything about, in order to make him commit a mistake and catch him red-handed.
“You are,” the man smiles again, this time a little more genuine. “I was surprised to see you, both of you—” he adds, looking back at Steve for a moment, “since we never officially met. But it’s good to have such dignified guests in one of my parties.”
They barely kissed, and Tony already wants more. To the surprise of absolutely no one.
Tony gets more comfortable on the sofa, maneuvering them so that he lies on top of Steve, and starts deepening the kisses, intent clear in his actions as he moves his body on top of a very interested super-soldier.
He’d never bet on Steve being a better schmoozer than him, and yet here he is, staring dumbly at Steve’s perfection and almost slacking at his own duties as schmoozer and host.
, Tony’s new addiction is sweeter than alcohol ever was for him. Tony chases Steve’s lips with his own for a little while, then whispers, “God, Steve. Want to get out of here?”
Jarvis doesn’t reply.
to thank Steve for.
They part after a couple of seconds, barely leaning away without taking a single step back. Tony instantly misses the heat against his mouth and the faint taste of lemon tea on Steve’s lips.
Tony is pretty confident the Avengers won’t have to be called to assemble again, at least not today. Even the bad guys have to rest sometime, right?
Tony doesn’t relent, his mind set on tasting Steve’s soul through his mouth. He pushes Steve harder on the wall, his hands moving from Steve’s chest to his abs to his biceps, never slowing down, determined to take as much as possible.
There are a few rounds of applause when the song finishes.
and excited, it’s like all the energy and life and the very
Tony laughs a little before stealing another kiss. “You up for it again
“From someone who can actually cook, yes.”
Tony can’t even black out the windows and walls – that would raise questions, and he doesn’t have time to think about explanations.
“Jarvis, what time is it?” Tony asks as he rolls out of bed.
“It’s just Clint. And he’s just about to go home. Once there, he can relax and forget about it plenty.”
Tony is almost leaning in again, screw décor and all, when Steve tenses up. Tony barely has time to tense up as well, trying to understand what he did wrong, when Steve glances to Tony’s back and he breaks in his fake camera smile.
So he slams Steve against the nearest wall and attacks his mouth.
The laugh makes both Tony and other Steve turn towards him. The mood feels a whole lot lighter now, so Steve decides it’s okay to let his own guard down as well, and be himself. “As much as I love watching myself bicker with you,” he looks at Tony, amused, “I don’t have much time here. I’m going back to my world in –” he checks his GPS-watch on his left hand, “fourteen minutes and nine seconds.”
Steve chose to love him, and all Tony can do is never let him regret it.
His cheeks burn, along with his neck and chest. He feels feverish, like the room has suddenly become twenty degrees hotter.
Tony's heart clenches a little.
Steve is still mimicking the Hulk where he attacks with just instincts and no tactic, and he’s doing a masterful impression as always, and Tony would do anything to keep him alive.
Steve almost sighs.
“I think it’s going to be fun. Just picture Immortus’ face when he sees us kissing right in front of his salad.”
Tony is impressed.
blush, realizing Steve is expecting an answer to a question Tony didn’t hear. “Sorry, what was the question?”
They continue to move together in a trance, the music a mere ornament for their movements. Everything else lies forgotten as the music builds up once again.
Steve places his arm around Tony’s waist and holds him tight as they begin to sway a little at Hucknall’s lines. Tony smiles – all he does is smile, smilesmilesmile, and he can’t even bring himself to stop, because he can’t really imagine a more perfect day. It’s so much more than he has ever deserved, and he just lives it moment after moment.
Tony doesn’t know when Steve became such a good kisser, but he’s thanking and sending his blessing to whatever the reason.
“What is going to be a problem?” Steve asks, worry making its way to his tone.
The man keeps holding the mask very close to his eyes. Despite his earlier words, Tony wishes he would lower it. He’s fairly certain the man is gorgeous – the features of his face are sharp and kind at the same time – and he has a clear view of his beautiful eyes, but… Tony wishes he could see
Tony enjoys it too much to call him out on his mother henning.
Worth a shot, though.
. They have only known each other for a couple of hours, and Tony is already thinking about
Tony barely has time to nod in response before Immortus turns and walks away.
Steve is moaning over him, his hands in Tony’s hair tightening and relaxing without any kind of rhythm. His grip is strong, and that thrills Tony more than he’s willing to admit out loud. Tony knows Steve too well to know he won’t push his head down his cock, not if Tony doesn’t give him blank card beforehand, but the thought that he
“I’m thinking of bringing you with me, on adventures,” Tony says. He’s never done it before – only his friends and the chronicler of Marvels would join him. Cartoonists only got the story from the chronicler, and then they would illustrate it based solely on the words.
Tony’s mind supplies. God, he would give up his entire fortune to be able to kiss Steve whenever he wanted to.
Had Tony been paying attention to what Cap was trying to teach him, he would have predicted Cap would eventually catch on to his lack of concentration.
He’s looking at Tony, fond and – hopeless.
It’s probably the truth.
please
Steve’s expression softens further as he says, “I’m sure they were exactly what you needed.”
“It’s okay, Tony. Next time,” Steve says, smiling ruefully.
and knows Steve is, too— so he swallows his pride and calls in a favor from Nat. He instructs Jarvis not to be contacted for SI business, short of Pepper or Happy about to literally die. He makes sure to have his schedule cleared for two entire days.
Tony knows this, but Steve doesn’t.
“Don’t,” Tony interrupts him, putting a hand on his mouth. “Say those words. I’m ready to bet our case of blue balls is those words’ fault. Don’t say ‘em.”
Steve’s aborted movements ignite the fire in Tony’s lower belly, making his cock twitch. Tony abandons any trace of plan and goes down on him, taking all he can of Steve in his mouth as he tries to pull every trick he’s learned over the years at once.
Tony hums happily, leaning on Steve’s shoulder as he untangles his hands and puts them near the fire. Steve brings his hand around Tony and holds him closer, and it takes Tony less than two seconds before turning on his side and looking at Steve.
Steve looks at him funny. “I asked, do you think my attitude might have compromised the mission?” He finishes the question in a whisper.
so bad, he’s been wanting this for over a month – he’s been wanting this for years, way before he and Steve got together, and Tony can’t quite believe he is about to have it.
(Tony would just like to say that the comment was
“Hey, hey, Steve,” Tony interrupts him. “Hey, it’s okay. I wouldn’t say we’re used to it, because we’re not, but we’re equipped to deal with physical intruders. It’s probably going to be a tech problem only, don’t worry. Besides, I’ll go there with the Suit ‘cause it’s quicker.”
and ignoring him.
Perhaps Steve’s right, after all, and he should stop drinking for the night.
The look of happiness on Steve’s face makes Tony involuntarily smile up at him, before realizing he just gave in to
Clint almost counts that as a win – before remembering that Steve usually goes jogging in the morning and Tony doesn’t.
He’s not coded to resist him.
Steve barely has time to feel disappointed, though, because he takes a good look at this Tony and the first adjective his mind comes up with is ‘breathtaking.’ The man is breathtaking.
This was Tony’s reasoning for getting both of their tuxes done by his tailor, despite Steve’s protests. It was for purely aesthetic reasons.
Steve’s fingers are still caressing Tony’s hair and he’s still kissing him, softer this time, when Tony comes back to reality.
Tony is back to the previous night. He’s back in Steve’s arms. They’re dancing again, Steve holds him close. They’re kissing, Tony can feel Steve’s body against his like they never parted.
It doesn’t take a genius to realize their night is going to take another direction entirely.
The man brings his left hand to the back of his neck and smiles, sheepish. “That you’ve been trying to avoid large groups of people, or tried to stay by the walls the whole time… But even your mask alone is telling enough, tied to your head so people aren’t encouraged to start conversations very easily.” He concludes with a shrug. “You struck me as someone who prefers to be left alone.”
The two leaders of the Avengers – and his friends – are fucking together. But also,
“Not really,” Tony says. Steve makes a vague noise, but doesn’t lower his hands. “It was original. Among the people downstairs, nobody surprised me once, tonight. Sure, they probably scared me, made me jump a little,” and isn’t that a surprise, how relaxed he feels now? “but I never felt more inclined to start a conversation than with you. Not for a long time, actually.”
“Take your coat off, come on,” he says. At Tony’s pout, Steve smiles again. “You’ll warm up sooner, I promise. I’ll help you,” he offers, wiggling his eyebrows in an exaggerated gesture. The proposal loses the innuendo as Steve wiggles the blanket as well, and Tony laughs.
See, his strategy wasn’t a hit and miss.
“Well, now I know for sure you’re wrong,” Tony says, faux scoffing. He does feel a little relieved, though.
Tony shakes his head. Good god, he needs to snap out of it.
Tony is delirious with greed.
It comes easy as breathing.
make me want to know all those things. You make me want to keep up. You, Tony. And I love you,” he says.
Tony shakes his head fondly, before standing up on his toes and kissing him lightly. Steve replies immediately, parting his lips and licking in Tony’s mouth. Which reminds him—
They managed to get the job done and arrest Immortus, but it nearly costed their lives. If Steve hadn’t noticed the sniper in the high gallery, they’d likely be dead.
Clint never turned around this fast, in his life.
Tony can’t believe Steve is in his arms.
So, instead, he just loses some tension from his shoulders. “You couldn’t help but notice…?” he asks, calm.
Tony nods and melts in the embrace. He nuzzles his face in Steve’s side and inhales, filling his lungs with Steve’s smell. There’s a hint of floral in there, like his usual shower gel.
The job, right. That’s what this is all about. Tony knows.
Tony stalls for an entire minute, merely enjoying the show, before he takes a sip and walks over to Steve, giving in to yet another temptation.
Derek always replies to Rogers’ greetings – when they’re there – with impeccable politeness. He smiles through his teeth and bids him good day. He wouldn’t want to get on his bad side— everyone knows how that ends, really.
As always, Tony can all but wholeheartedly agree with that expression.
Tony is willing to take the risk. A broken cheekbone would only make oral sex all the more interesting.
Eyes sparkling, his words are so passionate that Tony feels his heart skip another beat.
Tony nods. “I promise. J, note it.”
“I mean, if even your lady has left you alone…” The man smiles a little.
save your life,” he repeats, quietly.
Not that he ever doubted Jan, but the final result is, indeed, a work of art. Something worth of being looked at twice. It’s a lovely mask.
“Uh…” Tony says tentatively. “Thank you?” he says in a small voice, the words almost sounding like a question.
(He would laugh, if that didn’t bring back the retching. That’s always a mess.)
But make-pretend with Steve of all people is legitimately going to drive him insane. There have been a few obsessions in Tony’s life, and almost all of them had to do with science. He never really thought too much about people: he could’ve had anyone he wanted anyway.
“Don’t blame her,” Steve says, frowning a little. Tony finds it adorable. “It wasn’t Miss Pott’s fault. I believe Miss Van Dyne wanted to know who the new cartoonist would be, so Miss Potts introduced me to her. And broke the news to me, as well. I wasn’t supposed to know until next week. I should have suspected by the invitation to the ball, though.” Steve bites his lower lip and blushes again. “That’s why I decided to speak to you. I was going to introduce myself. Miss Potts said you would be delighted.”
Tony stops and turns around to face Steve leaning on the doorway. “Yes?”
That’s the moment Tony realizes he might be in love with Steve.
He has a perfectly trimmed goatee, brown Bambi eyes just as deep as his Tony’s, deeper bags under his eyes and a light frown, which makes the whole appearance just a tad cuter.
It’s no secret that Rogers fucked his way up to the Commander position. You do not die as a convicted person and come back to life to be Commander without some help.
you’re all nice and earnest to make people like you?”
There’s something warm and addicting about being called “Mr. Rogers.” He knows it can’t possibly last, so he wants to hear it over and over again while he can. After all, those will be his happiest, albeit most painful memories, when Steve inevitably leaves him.
Tony’s cheeks get warm. God,
Tony wants to ask aloud. It’s like the orchestra is set on pushing them to their breakpoint.
He watches as realization dawns on Steve’s face as well, shock morphing his face as a fierce blush colors his cheeks. Tony would be amused by how much Steve’s blushing, were he sure he was faring any better.
Tony is covered in goosebumps. He doesn’t care about the sounds that escape his mouth.
The first time it happens, Tony doesn’t even notice anything’s out of the ordinary.
This means he is now free to spend some time with Steve and Tony alone, and what he sees makes him frown,
Tony shakes himself back to reality. He can’t get distracted; not right now, when the suit is almost finished.
It feels good, it's like time is stretching out impossibly, and just moments before it becomes too much, Steve lowers his arms and exhales next to him, and Tony follows.
Tony is sure fate is determined to stop them from having sex.
“You bet your fine ass,” Tony mutters. “Jarvis, put Pepper through,” he says, leaving the room. He doesn’t even try to cover the hickey he feels forming on his neck.
“Jarvis, I told you, you have to tighten it up in the lower regions.”
Clint wishes he hadn’t noticed.
Hand still grasping other Steve’s, he brings him into a loose hug. “You know,” he whispers, very quietly, “It’s very hard for me to imagine a world where I don’t love Tony.” He feels other Steve stiffen just a little, but he doesn’t let him go yet. “I look at you, and see proof of what I’m saying. I’m sure every version of Tony feels the same way, too.”

Their over-the-top behavior could only have that one explanation, after all.
So he includes Steve too, trying not to laugh at other Steve’s baffled expression when he tries to convince him that yes, he’s there because his Tony wanted to
There’s nowhere Tony would rather be.

All he can feel is the raw burning of deep scratches. All he can hear are high-pitched screams.
Looking at his reflection in the mirror, Tony agrees.
is what prompts them to look back at his face.
He watches Steve figure out which song it is as another blush colors his cheeks, but it only takes him half a second to recover and steel his face into determination.
Steve attacks his mouth again, silencing Tony with his tongue in an open-mouthed kiss that does nothing to dampen the fire inside Tony. His thigh is still between Tony’s, and he’s moving back and forth, thrusting pointedly – and Tony is losing his mind.
“No need to apologize,” Tony whispers back. He makes no effort to move, and neither does Steve. “We have to practice.” He’s proud of how little innuendo he manages to slip through the sentence. Maybe he’s really become mature.
He’s just taken half a step back when the cellos join the piano, and Tony freezes on the spot. He knows that theme. He
For now, Tony is still trying to catch his breath, when he sees Steve trying to get himself together and open his mouth.
Tony and Steve move closer to the free space at the center of the room. They hadn’t danced much during the evening: they had opened the first dance according to tradition, but there hadn’t been much room for more than a slow dance, so they had settled on just sitting and sometimes greeting the guests and chatting with them.
Post Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Steve holds him tighter. The next kiss lingers a little longer, before Steve breaks it to whisper, “I love you too.”
The sense of deja-vu is broken as Steve thrusts a leg between his thighs. Tony rolls his eyes and moans wantonly into Steve’s mouth, his perfect thrust igniting every nerve of his body via his dick. He grips Steve’s ass and squeezes, feeling the firmness of the flesh under his fingers shift ever so, as Steve moans and thrusts his thigh against Tony’s dick again.
Tony fears he won’t be able to stop.
Their eyes meet again and Tony notices Steve’s blown pupils. He suppresses a shiver at the intensity of Steve’s gaze, because holy shit but that doesn’t help at all. It was— just a brush of lips, barely even considered a proper kiss, but here Tony is, unable to focus on anything other than the tingling sensation on his lips, Steve’s gaze boring into his soul, his cologne-masked scent and his hand still on Tony’s hip.
He did just agree to dance a Tango – the passionate dance par excellence – with Steve.
Steve shakes his head and squeezes him a bit tighter with the arm that’s still around him. “No, I wouldn’t. And I wouldn’t care to, either.
“It was my fault,” Tony whispers. He knows Steve can hear him anyway. “I should’ve listened to you. Shouldn’t have attacked the Adaptoid like that. I’m sorry.”
The room is large and full of masked people.
Life has taught him that a lot of the things he does are going to backfire spectacularly, and this is definitely one of those.
“That won’t be necessary,” Steve says. Tony doesn’t have the time to feel his hope dim, because Steve says, “I already did that. Apparently, I now have a job at
Tony looks at the suit in front of him. “Perfect.”
’-induced headache. It is also quick enough for Tony to be left panting when the song ends, though.
Steve beams and Tony kisses him again, because he’s bursting with happiness, because he
But the lack of any proper sleep and the constant efforts of being Iron Man and Captain America take their toll on them with every movement, with every kiss.
Before Steve can reply, Tony leans in and licks a stripe up Steve’s jugular. It’s purely selfish, aimed to savor and not as much to make Steve feel it.
, they’d be fucked.
Like, currently? The bastard is filling out every single inch of his suit and smiling charmingly at some donor. He’s all attentive and friendly, politely coaxing money out of people with nothing but his wholesomeness.
, then he still has a lot to learn. Tony had told him it’s barely September 2012, and yeah, he was meant to get there in September 2013, but he’s sure his Tony is going to fix that as soon as he gets back.
“I wanna leave you two alone probably
“I’m not going to drink this,” Tony cuts him off. “It’s just for having something to do with my hand. Besides, it takes a lot more than a couple of drinks to get me drunk.”
Sure, there’s that, and there’s Steve spending a great amount of time in Tony’s workshop, and yeah, they spar together, and eat together, and also
“Tony.” Steve sounds a little sterner now, so Tony looks up at him through his eyelashes, kissing his neck one last time before pouting.
“I know. We wanted to. I wanted to,” Steve adds, a little quieter. “I wanted to feel close to you, and that was the only way I could do that. I’d never thought I would be able to meet you, one day, but it was my deepest dream.”
That’s how, not long after, Steve tries to push Tony off his cock as he manages to say, “Tony, ahh, I’m going to—”
They kiss hard and rough, then Steve’s mouth is against Tony’s throat, right on his pulse, licking and biting. Tony’s heartbeat is loud in the room, hands grabbing each other’s shoulder and pushing their bodies closer.
The serum won’t let them last, anyway.
“I love you,” Tony whispers between kisses.
It almost feels like fate. If fate has the name of his lovely friends.
He looks back to his computer – because
The only thing that exists is Steve, his hands on Tony’s body, his mouth parting under Tony’s tongue.
wanted to know – there was a reason why he firmly rejected Nat’s words. He doesn’t want to know what Steve and Tony are up to, when they’re alone – violation of privacy, boundaries, not his business, nope, thanks.
