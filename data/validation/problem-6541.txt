As Tony explained how the suits were also temperature controlled, Steve took his time approaching him from behind. Steve inhaled then exhaled deeply as he slowly rubbed Tony’s arms from behind.
Tony stared at Steve before turning slightly to hide his expression which had twisted up with his emotions. They stayed like this for some time, with Tony struggling with whether he should just give up and leave.
Gamora left the office first, followed by Nebula. Nebula walked ahead of her sister, but Gamora stopped her as soon as they were a few feet away from the office.
Tony nodded as he ran up the bleachers while Peter ran to the stage. Tony waited a second before jumping on top of the robot, straddling it as he opened the top of its head.
Mr. Beck smiled slightly before leaning back in his chair, swiveling back and forth. “No worries, Mr. Stark. We can wait a bit.”
Tony nodded as he stepped to the side to let Steve in. “Uh, Peter’s over at a friend’s house…” He said as Steve walked into the foyer.
"Tony, you don't have to walk so slowly." Steve whined as they finally approached the entrance to the building.
Steve could see Tony, out of the corner of his eye, grinning uncontrollably. “Point one for Team Rogers. Exactly.” Tony slid the image of the vibranium core to the side to pull the Synergy device apart for Steve.
Tony mouthed the words to the song as he watched the computer run the numbers for the program. He swayed from side to side in time with the music, motioning a bit with his hands. Tony then half crossed his arms so he could rest his chin on his fist. As J.A.R.V.I.S. finished with the diagnostic test, Tony noticed something off about the sequences.
Peter and Tony nodded, smiling back at Steve in such in unnerving way that made him cringe, but he brushed it off, knowing that it was no use in pushing the matter any further. Steve shook his head as he opened the door to leave the lab, looking back at Tony and Peter as he walked down the corridor to the elevator.
Tony immediately noticed Loki as he crammed himself into the huddle. “Loki! Long time, no see!” He practically shouted, shaking Loki’s hand vigorously. To Steve, Tony sounded like he was already tipsy.
Tony stood completely still, too shocked to even open the envelope. He looked back toward the security desk before quickly accessing the private express elevator. During the trip back up to the penthouse, Tony stared blankly at the letter, debating with himself whether he should read it or throw it away.
“…how…did the specs turn out?” Tony still had his back toward Steve as he entered. His voice sounded stressed.
“Tony…” Steve managed to turn onto his side, “can you…help me…please?” His muscles gave out again, causing him to lie face down on the floor.
Steve nodded as he waited for Tony who definitely had more to say. “…but I thought we had good times, Steve…I really thought that…and I still do…”
Steve watched as Tony looked away from him, unaware that he was causing Tony so much stress on top on the arms dealers confrontation. Steve hesitated before continuing again.
Peter spun around to face Tony who was smiling at the nine-year old. Tony then reached downward, hoisting Peter over his shoulder.
Tony nodded before taking a moment to peal the covers back on his side. Steve shrugged before removing his pants and over shirt.
“Specs coming your way, Banner.” Tony spoke into his earpiece as soon as the device stopped glowing and generating.
Steve groaned as his internal clock woke him up, instantly disturbing his half sleep. He opened his eyes to see that Tony was still sleeping next to him. Steve’s hand was wrapped around and underneath Tony’s waist, naturally pulling the latter close to his body.
“Is that right?” Tony winked before letting go completely, and Steve’s face flushed once more from the suggestive tone evident in Tony’s voice.
“Was a piece of shit, Steve!” Tony had whipped his body around as he threw the diary across the lab away from Steve, “I can’t believe you read this. This is an invasion of my privacy!”
Bruce’s face got even redder. Tony knew he should probably lay off his friend, but he was trying to deflect attention away from himself.
“I hope that’s not a reference to Howard, Rhodey. And if it is, you can go promptly fuck yourself.” Tony sneered as Rhodey laughed.
Not only had his father kept from him how he truly felt toward him, Tony had never lived up to the image his father saw of him. What did he have to show? Pepper often deferred to him for serious company decisions, but she was the CEO of Stark Industries and he lost control of his dad’s legacy project. He had his own kid now to take care of, but how much of Tony’s baggage from his relationship with his father may have appeared in his relationship with Peter?
Tony was barely paying attention to Bruce as the latter was going on and on about the new upgrades to the Synergy device.
He swiveled back and forth in his chair. It was strange to think that Steve possibly “liked” him, but what did that even mean? Bruce wasn’t clear…or maybe he was. Was this a sly attempt on behalf of a friend to tell him to go for it? Bruce did comment on Tony possibly getting or asking for a date in the future with Steve, but maybe he was also teasing him. Tony couldn’t be so sure. He probably meant that Steve liked him enough to tolerate his antics, but then again, that could also be the way the rest of the team treated him.
Steve looked back at Tony, already expressing concern. Tony sighed loudly, struggling on how to begin.
Steve laughed as he gently caught Tony by the arm before he could get away any further. “I don’t mind, Tony. Actually, I’m kind of glad.” He said kindly.
And it felt like the longest trip ever walking from the threshold to the table. He gasped for air before plugging the charger in, placing the phone on top the table. Tony then rocked back and forth on his heels, keeping his mind off the fact that he was in Steve’s bedroom, alone with Steve.
Tony coughed before looking up at Steve. “Uh, would you like to stay over? I know it’s a weeknight and all, but—”
Tony barely acknowledged him as he began sobbing quietly with his head in his hands. He could hardly function after it was discovered that the Synergy device had been the cause of the explosion. Not only did it almost kill Steve, but the device was becoming more of a liability for the company.
Also, learning that his lab partner had gone out of his way to defend him in front of Obadiah had been certainly unexpected, but of course Steve had only done so as a loyal team member. There’s no way he was interested.
Tony could tell that Steve was still embarrassed but decided not to tease him about it. He leaned inward to kiss Steve, breathing deeply as the kiss moved slowly between them.
He then grinned to himself as he sipped out of his drink, suddenly hearing his name called in the distance. As soon as he realized that his name was being called away from the huddle, Tony turned, now standing alone away from the rest of the group. All at once, he felt uneasy.
Something about Tony’s expression still had its usual flare for the press, yet something about it suggested something else. Steve wasn’t quite sure what it entirely meant, but he wasn’t turned off by it at all. Actually, he found himself drawn to it and, by extension, Tony.
After placing the plates on the counter, Tony turned around to lean up against the counter. “Uh, Steve…I need to tell you something…”
Steve punched in the last figure. He looked at his watch; his timing was getting better with each practice run. He walked away from the Synergy device while looking down at the tablet he was holding. He had managed to figure out and memorize all of the possible figures and functions that could ever be entered into the device. It had only taken him about a week or so to be super quick about it, but he was finally willing to give himself some praise.
Natasha continued to smile as she watched Clint try to reach for some medicine on a table near his bed. She chuckled as she grabbed the bottle for him.
Exhaling with relief, Tony slammed back down into the bed, but he groaned in pain as his body made contact. He looked down at his right arm, which was covered in bandages before craning his neck to look back at Steve.
Steve nodded as Tony pulled out his tablet to find equations from Clint and Natasha. “Everything looks normal…” Tony had mostly said to himself.
On top of that, Steve hadn’t seen Tony all day to ask for advice on how he should proceed with meeting Obadiah but figured he could convey neutrality easily while also being on guard. Also, if anything about the meeting appeared awry, Steve would make sure Tony was aware.
The two grew silent for a moment, but Tony could see Sam staring at him as if something was bothering him. Sam then looked around before inching closer toward Tony to lower his voice.
Steve nodded as he placed his hands on his hips. “I should really apologize. I realize I haven’t since the argument over the failsafe…it’s obvious that it’s still bothering you…”
Tony sighed again as he looked directly at Steve. “Please get him out of here.” His voice rose in earnest, but that didn’t stop Steve from gently grabbing Thor by the arm to lead him out of the room, followed by Bruce who attempted to calm Thor down as much as possible. Tony waited for the door to close before inching into Loki’s personal space.
Pepper sighed. “You think you don’t deserve happiness, Tony, so you self-sabotage instead.” She explained as gently as possible although the words hit Tony as if he had fallen off a tall building before colliding with asphalt.
The security guard gave him the once over before looking through a series of unclaimed badges in front of her. She finally found Steve’s before handing it over. She pointed to the sign-in sheet again.
But before Riri could explain, her phone rang Beyoncé’s “I Miss You” on the loudest volume possible. Riri took her phone out of her coat pocket before tapping on it a few times.
Tony turned onto his other side to grab his phone that was on the bedside table, before turning back onto his back again. On top of worrying about Thanos’s next move, Tony was struggling with deciphering Steve’s intent. Steve appeared more comfortable around him lately, even after Tony had ghosted him for a year and had kept him in the dark about his battle with depression.
Steve caught himself. What was there to hide? Steve was genuinely trying to work on his friendship with someone he cared about. And he was close with Peter, so it was also important for Steve to see him.
Steve shook his head a few times; it wouldn’t hurt to ask, right? He wanted to spend more time with Tony that went beyond late nights in the lab or in Tony’s bed. Steve also wanted to get to know Peter; it would be weird to try to pursue something with someone without establishing a report with their kid.
Tony straightened up before shuffling downward to get off the bed. He took a moment before rising to face Steve.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he scooted closer to Steve, reaching out a hand to caress his side, “remember the first time we did this and I told you I would like to fuck you if you wanted it?”
Tony grunted a non-committal reply as he shifted onto his other side while Steve got out of the bed.
“What do you think of the new upgrades to the device?” Tony began, determined to change the subject to avoid looking silly.
“Oh my god…” Steve and Tony turned around at the sound of Strange’s voice who had appeared behind them.
Steve nodded as he scooted even closer toward Tony. Tony turned his body some more as he swallowed a lump in his throat, anticipating the worst, but not entirely sure why.
Tony waited for the older man to continue, even though he could really care less at this point. It was becoming clear, especially during the final interview stage, that Obadiah had been slowly trying to push him out of Project Synergy.
Tony turned around to look at Steve; he looked to be mentally processing the situation before answering, taking a moment before addressing Steve again.
The conference room rumbled as everyone’s attention was captured by Thor barreling into the space, dragging Loki behind him with Steve following behind. Loki, still tied up in the jumper cables, was trying to wiggle away from Thor. Natasha and Bruce lunged toward Thor to get him to let go of Loki: Bruce held onto Thor as Natasha grabbed Loki before throwing him in the nearest chair.
“Tony, I think if we get the robot to face away from us, we can disconnect the wiring from the back.”
And as soon as Tony uttered the comment, Steve felt like his body might topple over from how heartbreaking the words came across.
“Uh, yes.” Tony mumbled. He coughed before crossing his arms. The rush of the elevator and the lingering feeling of Steve’s lips on his was making him feel nauseous.
“I hate looking like the bad guy, but could you tell Bucky we’re all eating lunch here today? We have that deadline on—”
Steve nodded before taking a deep breath. “It’s my fault…I don’t think I’ve ever really explained to you how much Bucky means to me, but it’s purely platonic, Tony…”
“So,” Steve started, clearing his throat, “Sam just told me he’s planning on moving in with Shuri.” He offered causally.
“I need the two of you on the finishing details for that postponed simulation for the board. We’ll also use it as an opportunity to guard the device closely while we track down Loki.”
“…please don’t pick up…please don’t pick up…” Tony wished to himself as he listened to the phone ring.
Tony let out a sigh of relief which shocked Steve; outside of their conversation, it never occurred to him that someone like Tony could be this vulnerable.
you’ll be the first to find out.” Tony answered with a slight edge in his voice. He knew that some of Stark Industries’ employees were actually minions for Obadiah. If Obadiah discovered anything before Tony announced it, it was probably because of one of them.
“You know, Dr. Banner is great. Tony seems to really appreciate having him around at work and helping out with Peter.” He offered, attempting not to make it obvious he was prying into her dating life, although he was failing tremendously.
“We gotta call Bucky. Once he gets into town this weekend, we’re celebrating. That means going out, Steve.” Sam poked his flabbergasted friend a few times in the chest before shoving past Steve to get to the fridge. He rummaged around a bit before pulling out a bottle of champagne. Steve stared dumbfounded at his friend as Sam produced two plastic champagne glasses from a grocery bag shoved in a corner on the countertop.
Ever since he tried fingering with Tony, Steve couldn’t get the feeling out of his mind and he thought maybe he could try taking things further. He read up on what he needed to do to prepare himself for such an undertaking and was now waiting for the right moment to talk to Tony about it.
Tony nodded, seemingly relieved. “Not that there’s any competition, because there isn’t, but I’m a little surprised I didn’t have to compete with a contract from Justin Hammer.” He scoffed at the idea of Shuri working for someone like Hammer whose company’s output was nowhere near the quality of Stark Industries’.
As soon as the ringing ceased, Tony’s breath hitched. “Hi, Tony.” Tony could hear the weary tone in Steve’s voice as he answered.
He didn’t know how much longer he could take; the sensation was more than he could handle as he felt himself coming to the brink.
“Mr. Barton’s vitals are good. We’re just keeping him under for the rest of the night and into the morning to give his body a rest.” He calmly explained.
“You’re going to get me into a lot of trouble saying that, Rogers.” Tony smirked before hopping off the table. He continued to watch Steve with the same flirty smile before arriving at a console where he manually changed the playlist.
Tony’s facial expression contorted a little into a look of concern, but then he laughed again, seemingly fine. Well to Steve anyway.
Tony laughed. “I know you keep them in the top drawer, so I just lifted them when you weren’t looking and shined them up for you.”
Steve nodded wordlessly again as he swallowed a lump in his throat. He thought about the way Tony had been with him in the car, feeling him and taking his time. He appreciated that Tony was so patient with him, which eased him even more as he looked back at Tony, giving him a kiss before climbing on top of him.
“…but I think it looks good on our end for Synergy…” he motioned toward Tony with his drink, “…we just can’t have any more accidents. But I don’t think I need to tell you that.”
tell me you were seeing someone else, you didn’t even tell her that you and I used to date, Steve!” He motioned back and forth between himself and Steve.
They gathered around each other with Steve and Tony standing close to one another to the right of everyone else. The photographer looked beyond his camera before motioning with one hand at the group.
Tony smirked as he crossed his arms. “It took some convincing, but everyone else is on board, including Fury.”
Tony laughed as he leaned over Peter to help him with the food. “What do you think? Should we taste it again?”
happy now, Obie. Are you really here just to gloat? I’m more worried about Steve now than the fucking project at this point.”
Steve laughed as he joined Tony at the console. “I think they’re great. I’m ready to test them out in the field.” Tony felt Steve place a hand on his shoulder.
you want to me.” Tony responded as he pushed downward into Steve, grinding against his body. Tony took a moment to effortlessly remove his briefs before grinding on Steve again.
After a second or so, Steve reached for some tissues next to the bed, handing one to Tony. Tony grinned as he accepted the tissue.
Tony stopped next to the bed, leaning on one leg. “Uh, you can change your mind if you want…I won’t be offended…” He offered meekly.
Pepper nodded somewhat. Tony could feel her watching him. However, he looked up to see that she was wearing a caring smile.
“No offense to Dr. Banner and his capabilities, but you’re the best brain we have on this project, Stark. I think Rogers would benefit learning a thing or two from you.”
Obadiah quickly followed him. “Bigger? Thanos, I understand that you’re trying to create your ‘super’ weapon, but you should take what you have here and sell it to the highest bidder. This is almost close to what Anthony managed to cobble together.”
Steve took his time sitting up in the bed before responding. “Of course, Tony. I don’t think you would have asked me to marry you if there was even a possibility that I would say no to adopting Peter. You care about him and only want the best for him.”
Steve’s body relaxed as he let Tony touch him. He finally felt his body melt into the mattress as Tony took it as a sign to push in further. Steve moaned loudly as Tony went in slowly before speeding up. He pushed up against Steve.
As he tried to find the best way to start a conversation, Steve mentally replayed Tony’s past behavior: his outburst from the first simulation run through and subsequent situations; his consistent self-deprecating humor; how uncomfortable he appeared whenever his father was mentioned…
Steve glanced at her and smiled. He had enjoyed getting to know Natasha; she was just as level-headed as him, if not more, and he knew he could always count on her.
Strange smiled as he shook Steve’s hand. He glanced over at Tony who only shrugged. Strange simpered, obviously now revealing that he had figured out that Steve was the person Tony had been experiencing panic attacks over.
“…you’re right…but he probably doesn’t want to talk to me now…” Tony relented, “we’ve been avoiding each other all week…”
They kissed each other for some time; taking their time, moving slowly. Tony moaned as he bit Steve’s bottom lip before using the opportunity to feel every inch of Steve’s lips. Steve squeezed him tighter, and Tony could feel him trying to hold onto him as gently as possibly, but it also felt like Steve would never let him go. Or possibly never leave him. He never felt this vulnerable with someone before.
Steve remained silent, knowing that Tony was referring to the time Obadiah accused him of sleeping around with Tony before they got close. However, the sudden shift in Tony’s tone was jarring; he told himself to wait a moment or so before responding.
“…I thought maybe I could read to you for a bit before I need to pick up Peter…” Tony pulled out a couple books from the bag, spreading them out on the bed as if Steve could see them.
“So, I’ll probably have you stationed over at this console, but I may move you after learning more about the device after we test it a few more times.” Bruce shuffled around Steve, moving back and forth between various-sized consoles. He picked up a few gadgets, turned them over and over, before setting them down in different locations.
Steve sighed. “I forgot that had I told him before coming out here that I wasn’t looking for a relationship…but I had said it because he thought he was the reason why Sharon and I weren’t seeing each other anymore…”
Loki looked back and forth between Thor and Tony, his face working with constructing any possible lie he could conceive. Natasha interrupted his mental dealings by slapping him across the head.
Steve never verbally responded; all Tony could hear behind him was Steve wrestling around possibly putting his shoes on, the door open, then shut close, followed by footsteps down the hallway. Tony waited a second as he groaned to himself. He turned around to sit down on the edge of the bed, now fighting back a sob that had formed in the middle of his throat.
Tony took his time before answering. “I was just…thinking about…my dad…” He admitted and a little surprised with himself that he had.
Steve sighed as he watched Tony pat his side of the bed. Steve took his time getting into the bed before Tony handed him his gift.
“So, uh…” Tony started up, trying to refocus on his plan and Synergy, “I have some things I would like to test out before Shuri and Banner go back to working on the device…”
“…I just wanted to apologize again…for earlier…I’m really sorry…” Steve let the sentence drag out through agony.
“Same here, Rogers. But you’re not winning any points leaving so soon.” Tony made sure to convey with a smile that he was only teasing, which seemed to work because Steve grinned back.
.” From the tone in Tony’s voice, Steve could tell that that was the end of the conversation. No further questions asked.
“It’ll only change slightly, just enough for someone to do a double take if they’ve met you before.” Tony returned with the glasses, handing one to Steve. Their hands brushed up against each other, but neither acknowledged it as they continued with the plan.
Tony thought again. He shook his head as Steve kissed him; he seemed unaware that Tony was fidgeting around, fighting himself not to say his thoughts out loud.
Steve listened to Tony tap a few times on his tablet. “Here’s the sequence: Open brackets: epsilon inverted, beth, 34450 divided by 45, closed brackets. Open brackets: omega, ominus, delta, 345 divided by 1234, closed brackets.”
He danced with Bucky and Sam for a bit as everyone else danced around them, dancing to a few more songs before everyone took their time walking back to their tables. As he walked toward his reserved table, Steve had noticed that Tony was no longer sitting at his table.
“Also!” Tony waved his hands around, “you can bring a plus one—or not! It’s totally cool either way.” He smiled unnervingly at Steve as he told himself to stay calm.
Steve’s eyes widened. “Really? How can we even do this if we don’t have control over the project? Also, the Synergy device—"
Steve smiled meekly as he commanded himself to relax. He turned to face Tony more directly, immediately caught up in Tony’s scent reminiscent of his shower. Steve breathed deeply as he reached over to wrap both hands as best as he could around Tony’s waist. Tony let his body be pulled closer toward Steve who used the opportunity to run his hands along Tony’s backside. Steve gazed at Tony for a second or two before moving inward for a kiss. Tony kissed him back slowly as Steve held onto him even tighter. After a moment, Tony gently broke away, but he kept his hands on Steve.
The Synergy executive committee was meeting with the senior members of the board in the nicest conference room in Stark Tower. Obadiah was sitting at the head of the table giving his opinion on the next possible move for Synergy, facing Tony who sat on the exact opposite end of the table. As he spoke, Obadiah kept glancing furtively in Tony’s direction which annoyed Tony to no possible end.
“Look, Tony, last night was a mistake, we’ll never do that again, okay? I really just want to be friends with you—”
Steve dragged Tony to duck underneath a table. “Okay, I’m only going to say this once considering how dire the situation is,” Steve glared at his husband, trying to keep his anger in check, “but, Tony—”
Tony sighed. “The executive committee met with the board and we have two options: either we give Synergy to the government or bid for open contracts.”
Steve shrugged as he groaned. He never understood why everyone else he knew was so casual when it came to joking about sex.
Tony nodded as he could feel more tears running down his face. He held still, watching Steve continue toward him before pulling him into a secure hug, which Tony gratefully accepted. He hugged Steve close against his body.
Steve continued to moan with unrestrained pleasure as he turned more into the mattress. Tony turned with him, spreading his ass cheeks even further apart as he pushed downward in Steve. Steve felt Tony place a hand on the small of his back and both legs on either side of his body.
As the elevator doors closed, they stood on opposite sides of the car as it ascended to their floor. Tony turned to smile at Steve. Steve smiled back, laughing to himself before Tony walked over to him, wrapping a hand around Steve’s neck, kissing him deeply.
find Steve attractive. But besides tolling in the fallout from his last relationship, the thought of even thinking about pursing one with Steve seemed like a bad idea to begin with. He didn’t even know him. He would probably barely see him. He was probably already seeing someone else.
Steve stood in place as he watched Tony walk toward their lab, puzzled by the suggestive tone in Tony's voice.
As he approached the front door, Steve considered riding his motorcycle to work. Maybe, he began to wonder, he could suggest a joy ride with Tony around the city for a bit after work—
Next to Fury was a larger, muscular man with blond hair. He was smiling, but not in a creepy way. More so in an overly welcoming way that Steve didn’t really feel from the first two. Next to the blond giant was another man lounging in a chair at the table. He was dressed more casually and seemed to be bored already.
Steve smiled back, but he was sure he looked edgy. Tony grinned toward the direction of the crowd outside, which was growing restless with anticipation. One of the backstage managers walked up to Tony and Steve, motioning with her hands that the presentation was ready to begin.
“Tony, thanks for the offer, but no…” Steve sat up rigid in his chair, “I haven’t heard from you in over a year…” Now there was no way Steve could stay cool without confronting Tony.
Bruce scoffed. “Okay, Tony. You were all…,” he hiccupped, “…weird and awkward around Steve the first couple weeks.”
Steve looked away from Tony as he finally let Bucky drag him back to the dance area. He had been watching Tony the entire time during the ceremony and ever since the reception started, but he told himself that he needed to relax and let Tony come to him when he was ready.
“Steve…” Tony started, wringing his hands, “I should have told you this instead of giving you a hard time about Bucky…”
Steve nodded as he reached out to rub Tony on the shoulders. “I understand where you’re coming from, Tony. But the team needs you until the final decision. Just think of the team. Not Synergy. Not even Obadiah.”
Tony slapped the edge of the countertop as he pretended to be upset that the score was now even. He pointed at Steve.
“Then, if all goes as plan, Dr. Blake and Dr. Banner will receive the specs to create the material. And today…” Fury looked down at some notes on a tablet he was holding, “…we’re trying for something simple. Let’s try a television remote.”
Steve furrowed his brow. “The accident wasn’t Tony’s fault and you know that, Mr. Stane.” He glared at Obadiah who tried to reciprocate, but Steve was staring him down too intensely and it was obvious that Obadiah was becoming uneasy by it.
“The local police are surrounding the area, but I’m getting a reading from Romanov and Barton that this isn’t your grandma’s Sunday dinner explosive…” Fury continued.
Steve nodded as he followed Tony who made sure to say goodbye to the appropriate people before quickly marching out of the lounge.
Tony lingered before gently breaking away.  “Ah, well…oh, you shaved your face!” Tony awkwardly motioned with his hands to draw an invisible beard around his own face, “the uh, beard was kind of growing on me…”
Steve looked at Tony who still looked annoyed with their conversation before accepting the comic from Peter.
Everyone nodded. Steve adjusted his chair to get a better look at the map, but in doing so, he inadvertently scooted his chair closer toward Tony, which he had thought was physically impossible given the space. Tony didn’t seem to notice or didn’t care; he stayed in place with both elbows on the table.
After the press event, Steve had surprised Tony by actually following through with the two of them spending more time together to work on their friendship. They had made plans one afternoon while working at Stark Enterprises, but Tony was still conflicted: although he felt that maybe somehow he could get Steve back, it seemed as if during their conversation Steve was truly looking for a friendship and that maybe his relationship with Sharon was leaning more toward the serious side than anything causal.
Steve looked back at Tony who barely seemed present. Steve had wondered if there was something going on; that morning Tony appeared hardly responsive and edgy. Steve had figured his lab partner was having a rough day and decided not to press it.
As soon as they arrived back to their suite, Tony walked toward the bedroom. “I think I’m going to take a nap then do some work.”
Tony sighed as he rubbed his forehead. “Why would you do this? Even if you don’t care about Synergy, you put people’s lives in danger, including your brother’s.”
Steve’s last comment sucked all the air out of the space. He glared back at Tony, feeling a strange mix of emotions he hadn’t felt since they broke up. But after what felt like forever, Steve turned away from Tony, walking to his table, yet he was too angry to work.
Steve winced; he had been sure that the only people who knew about Clint was himself and the rest of the team who had just learned about it that morning.
“Thanks, Steve.” Peter answered as he unbuckled his seatbelt, but before he could get out of the car, Tony gently grab him by the elbow.
The Synergy team crowded into one of the smaller rooms reserved for private meetings shortly after Fury called the team to discuss the next phase in their project timeline. This tiny room, whose occupancy limit was five at the very most, was the only one available because Obadiah had reserved all the available conference rooms to accommodate a visit by the Stark Industries board for a press event not related to Synergy.
Bruce rolled his eyes as they all began taking material out of Tony's lab and down the corridor to his lab.
“I know what I’m doing, Banner.” Tony barked. Steve could feel Tony struggling against his side to move him out of the way, but he was now mostly holding against Tony to keep him in place.
Before Steve could figure out what to do, he felt a hand clap his shoulder which was accompanied by a hearty, joyful laugh.
After another hour, Steve and Tony paused for a break. They stood chatting in the lab for a couple minutes before they were interrupted by Clint, Natasha, and Thor.
“Okay, okay. I’m sorry. Relax, Steve.” But he couldn’t stop himself from laughing as Steve’s face turned even more red.
The two men avoided each other the rest of the day. It was extremely awkward, but Steve figured it was probably best to prevent any more outbursts.
Tony watched Steve work out of the corner of his eye. His lab partner, although probably focused on his work, acted as if he was the only person in the lab. Ever since that simulation, Steve would only speak to Tony on a need-to basis.
Tony nearly blinked with disbelief; He never expected Steve to give a shit about anything going on with him after the first simulation debacle. Or maybe his lab mate thought it was work-related?
Thanos scoffed. “Loki tampering the device wasn’t part of the plan. He doesn’t have the grace that Dr. Selvig has with the device, hence the unnecessary lab explosion.”
. That doesn’t even come close to what I’ve said to you.” He looked upward at Steve with a genuine smile.
“I gotta say, I’m impressed with your punctuality, Rogers.” Tony attempted with a lazy smile. Steve only nodded but didn’t say a word as he began studying some data from the other day.
Tony had been working on the Synergy device and reviewing his dad’s schematics after arguing with Steve earlier that morning. He was beginning to regret accepting Steve’s invitation to the bridal party getaway; he was confused by what Steve wanted, but then again he was also confused about what he himself wanted.
Loki stared at Thor for what felt like an eternity before breaking out into a high-pitched maniacal laughter, shaking the tiny café table with him. Eventually his laughter subsided as he stared off, looking at nothing again.
Earlier that night, Tony had stayed in his office for some time before Rhodey found him. Tony reluctantly explained what was going on and Rhodey managed to convince him to put on a brave face and come out to the party. Tony avoided Steve as much as possible before he left earlier than he had expected, but Tony was relieved that he had; he knew he would end up saying something else that would ruin the entire party.
Tony smiled as he closed the gap to kiss Steve. He then straightened up to walk back to the bathroom. “Don’t get too used to it, Rogers.”
Tony looked downward so that Steve couldn’t see that he was blushing from the comment. “Uh, well,” he cleared his throat again as the tingling sensation in the middle of his chest reappeared.
Tony sighed before walking away from the door. He walked over to the other side of the bed, facing away from Steve, trying to figure out something to say. He knew running into Tiberius had set off this whole chain reaction, but there was something off about Steve musing about Bucky after having been so freaked out that people thought they were messing around when they started working together.
“That leaves Rogers with Dr. Banner.” Steve smiled at Bruce who acknowledged him with a kind, yet nervous looking smile.
Obadiah was reading some papers next to a bookshelf near his desk. He looked upward somewhat to acknowledge Steve.
“Okay, I’m all ears, Tony.” Pepper stepped closer toward Tony, indicating that she was also concerned that they may be overheard.
Tony scrolled down until something caught his eye. It was a notation to a function that had been rendered obsolete in the newest iteration of the device.
Tony nodded; thankful he didn’t screw up again. He pointed back toward the café. “Can we drink our coffees together and talk about the weather or sports?” He joked, which made Steve laugh a little.
“Was I obvious? “Bruce asked, readjusting his eyeglasses. He was grinning a little, but it was on the shy side, typical for his anxious behavior.
“Okay,” Shuri started, seemingly unaware of the tension in the room, “I’m patching Fury and the team through now…”
“And!” Tony sat up straight, waving his drink around as he almost splashed some on Bruce, “Natasha was giving you eyes while Barton was singing!” He nearly shouted. Both Tony and Bruce made another face at each other before ensuring that Natasha was also out of ear shot of their conversation.
Tony shook his head, but he stayed on the couch. “No, Steve. I mean, I do know you…this whole situation is so fucked up…I just really miss you—”
He then rolled over onto his back, smiling up at the ceiling, thinking about the way Steve felt on top of him. He looked at his phone before placing it on the bedside table. He returned to looking up at the ceiling, too excited to sleep. Tony then turned over onto his side to grab his phone.
“I’m sorry,” he wiped his eyes which were wet again from laughing too hard, “I should have told you what it feels like the first time after I pull my dick out.”
Tony laughed again as he kissed Steve before sitting up straight. “I suppose you’re right, Rogers. But the suits are great, am I right?” He winked at Steve before rising from the bed, wiping himself off with a tissue before zipping up his pants.
“…you know what the best thing is about having this device locked down?” Tony started up again as Steve walked toward him, “I can test these scenarios I’ve been tinkering with in the simulation suite…”
Steve laughed quietly. He turned to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder, looking downward before looking up.
Tony considered Steve’s obvious half-truth. Tony remembered Steve appearing completely fine in the morning despite having been a wreck the night before. Maybe he was trying to tell Tony that whatever happened between the two of them was a mistake? Then why would Steve have dinner with him? Maybe he felt sorry for him?
Steve stayed completely silent, trying to process what he had asked for, but he couldn’t help himself as he rubbed Tony’s backside.
of May, Mr. Stark is recorded saying that the trip to Malibu will begin promptly at 8:00am on the 15
Bucky perked up. “He came to your graduation today. Also, Sam said something about the two of you sleeping together—”
Steve nodded quickly as he kissed Tony back. Tony hummed quietly as he let Steve kiss his neck, pushing more into his body.
“You and I both know this isn’t true. Others know this isn’t true. So, one jerk thinks they know everything. Who the fuck cares?” He was now leaning up against the table and staring intensely at Steve. Steve felt uncomfortable which caused him to shrug a little. He was beginning to feel silly for getting so upset.
Natasha nodded her head with a sigh. “Yeah, it’s looking like that might be the case. I don’t mind doing it, Clint, I just want to make sure he’s interested.”
After an intense exchange of wit between Tony and Peter, Peter ultimately stumped Tony with what he had learned that day without Tony letting him win that time around. They finished eating dinner soon after as the familiarity mounted to new levels of intimacy, and of course Tony donned the mask of shame until bed time.
“Okay, so we’ll grab Loki then I’ll call Tony.” Steve reminded Thor who barely responded as he marched toward the building. Steve stopped him short with an outstretched arm before entering.
“And as you know from reading the initial dossier, the device is equipped with a vibranium core. This seems to be the only metal that not only keeps the Synergy device operating at efficient levels, it also keeps it stable.”
Tony unbuckled his seat belt, lingering a bit before reaching over to stroke Steve’s neck. Steve breathed deeply as he accepted a kiss from Tony who then moved his other hand to rub Steve’s leg. Tony kept rubbing until he bumped against what felt like a semi-hard erection through Steve’s pants.
Bruce shook his head, his expression hardening again. “Shit, Tony…” he looked directly at Tony, “the device isn’t generating the detonator…” he tapped on the tablet, “it looks like it's being held up by the last unfinished round of safeguards…”
, and Tony has volunteered his resources to help his kid win his school’s science fair. Some cute moments between father and son transpire, but also Tony gets ahead of himself which may or may not result in Peter’s project destroying the school’s gymnasium.
He pretended to study a section of the device as he fiddled, when in reality he was still mulling over his actions from a few days ago. He really didn’t feel like talking about it, especially now since he was in the process of repairing his working relationship with Steve. He also had hoped everyone would just let it go.
“…I’m so hard for you, baby…” Tony reached downward with one hand to rub both himself and Steve together. Steve gasped as soon as Tony’s hand griped his hard cock while he rubbed his hands along Tony’s backside.
Tony looked confused as he answered. “Steve, you don’t have to do that…” He let Steve continue rubbing his arm.
Fury stared Tony down as if silently telling him he had no idea what he was talking about. “How can our legal person do his work if he’s unaware of the specifics? Besides, the point of this venture is to collaborate with others, Stark. Now, I know you don’t usually like working with other people but think of this as a mentoring opportunity.”
Steve groaned loudly, using the pillow that had been underneath his body to hide his face. Tony kept laughing as he laid down next to Steve to hug his body.
back to the bed.” He motioned with his hands to demonstrate Steve’s failed excursion to and from the bathroom.
Steve grinned before motioning for Tony to follow him. Tony returned the expression and followed before he realized that Steve was leading him to his bedroom. He stopped short at the threshold and panicked.
They met each other near the middle of the office. Tony let Steve rub his arm as Tony leaned inward toward Steve’s body, making a move to hug him. Steve reciprocated the hug, practically holding Tony.
“Uh…” Sam looked at Bucky who was coughing loudly before looking back at Steve, squinting his eyes in disbelief, “is, uh, Sharon busy…or something…?”
Steve pulled back to look at Tony, rolling his eyes in the process. “I know that, Tony.” He leaned inward to kiss him, lingering for a bit as everyone around them cheered on.
Tony couldn’t stop himself from expressing how surprised he was by Steve’s response. “Really? Uh, I mean…that’s great!”
“You can chill with the pleasantries, Thanos,” Tony responded curtly as he stood across the table from Thanos, “we know what you’re up to, and we know you’ve been using Stark Industries employees to do whatever the hell you’re trying to do. Tell us where this fucking super weapon is.”
Steve tilted his head back to smile at Tony before leaning in to kiss him. “Let’s get back to the party.” He whispered.
Tony, now trying to keep a straight face, shook his head as he stepped away from the bed to examine how much damage Steve had done to his face.
Bucky wiped his eyes as he let out another sigh. “Cap! You gotta admit that that there is some cosmic trickery.” He paused for a second as he appeared to be remembering something, “actually, Sam had asked me before we found out that you broke up whether he should plan for you bringing Sharon and I
Loki’s expression softened before he shook his head. “Would love to, you know, support Synergy and all, but I have to get back to something I’m working on but keep me updated.” He snapped his fingers in Steve’s direction, obviously insincere about the whole situation, before disappearing back into his lab.
Natasha nodded as she exited the room to call Fury. Tony then turned away from Loki toward Bruce to tap on his phone furiously.
Suddenly, as everyone else waited anxiously for him to respond, Loki began to laugh. The laughter started out quiet, but then rose to a high maniacal register.
Tony couldn’t even answer Steve with a nod; he was too upset with the entire situation. He choked down a few sobs as he watched Steve reel from rejection.
Despite the terrible pain he was experiencing from his injuries, a stupid grin crept up onto Tony’s face before he answered.
Tony rolled his eyes, but Bruce continued. “If for some strange reason Steve turns you down, I’ll cancel on my colleague, okay?”
Peter groaned as he tried to grab Ned, but the latter had evaded his grasp by taking off toward the main entrance to the school building.
“The equations will then be sent to Rogers and Stark who will input the numbers into the Synergy device.” Fury nodded at Steve and Tony.
Tony sighed. Peter wore a wristwatch Tony had designed for him that included J.A.R.V.I.S., and Tony had forgotten that he had the computer programmed to keep him informed of Peter’s usual arrival on specific days of the week.
Steve sat up, staring intently. He took a moment before responding. “Tony…are you trying to break up with me?”
“Hey, there’s our star player! Banner just told me you were up all night?” Tony greeted Shuri as she walked up to a coffee maker on a table in the corner of the space.
Tony stepped forward. “Listen, Thor. I want to find your brother just as much as you do. However, we need to figure out a plan. That’s the only way.”
Tony waited for the call to end before launching himself out of the bed to quickly find some clothes. He jogged into the kitchen to search for his keys before tripping over himself to put his shoes on as he jogged to the elevator.
want him to find us like this?” He questioned, heavily emphasizing the word “don’t” as he seemed to be analyzing Steve’s behavior.
Tony waited another second before unzipping Steve’s pants. He then unzipped his own before reaching past the opening of Steve’s to his briefs. Tony moaned as he felt Steve through the fabric, before tugging it down to pull out Steve’s cock. Steve’s breath hitched as Tony felt around before pulling his own cock out. Tony then tugged on Steve’s shirt, struggling a bit to remove it smoothly, which prompted a laugh from Steve as it caught on his nose before he was freed. Tony laughed with him, straightening up to yank of his own shirt before pulling Steve back down on the bed. Tony hesitated before wrapping a hand around both of their cocks to rub them together; he wasn’t sure how far Steve wanted to go.
Tony and Peter were standing in the middle of Tony’s lab, standing over a robot they had been working on for the past month.
“Why?” Bucky shrugged, “because you’re fucking my best friend? You can’t even fully commit there either.”
Steve stared at him intently, making Tony feel anxious, before turning to exit the space. “Okay, just call me if you need anything, okay?”
“The only time we’ve spoken to each other was when we were arguing in front of everyone over Synergy…I haven’t heard from him since. This is the longest it’s been and its annoying the shit out of me.”
Steve sat rigid on the bed, too paralyzed to answer back. He tried to remind himself that J.A.R.V.I.S. was just a computer, but as the thought bounced around in his head, it brought him to the realization that he was in Tony’s bedroom.
The minister then asked for Sam and Shuri to share their wedding vows. Sam cleared his throat before laughing to himself.
Steve smiled as kissed Tony back, nodding. “I love you too, Tony…” He repeated quietly as Tony caressed his face once more before turning toward Bruce.
Thor and Steve were sitting in Thor’s car on the other side of a street lined with rowhouses. Thor pointed to the building at the corner. Steve squinted as he looked out the passenger-side window: the building and the entire street did not look how he had pictured Loki’s favorite hang-out spot to be.
“Steve, I need to tell you something before I go down there…” Tony rested both hands on Steve’s face, “this is absolutely
Steve had his back facing Tony so he couldn’t see how pained his expression had become. He exhaled with relief thinking maybe Tony hadn’t picked up on how much he was looking forward to spending more time with him.
Tony thought instantly. Tony knew it would be awkward seeing Steve’s best friends again, but he thought he wouldn’t have to deal with speaking with either Sam or Bucky until the wedding.
The provocation nearly knocked the wind out of Tony; despite how contentious their relationship had become since launching Synergy, Tony couldn't believe how blatant Obadiah was acting. He felt like a kid again getting harangued for fucking up over and over.
Tony pointed to Natasha. “Romanov, why don’t you hang out with Thor and Banner until you get your lab mate back.”
“But my friends call me Thor!” The tall blond man shouted with gaiety in a British, maybe Australian, accent. He walked briskly up to Steve, giving him the warmest handshake he had ever received up until that point in his life, which he wasn’t sure was physically possible.
Tony walked into the living room before crouching down near Steve. “Oh, that looks like my mother’s jewelry box…” He said quietly as Steve handed him the box.
“Thank you for telling me,” Sharon started, smiling somewhat, “and I had a really nice time with you, too, but I understand. And I also think we’re probably better as friends.” She patted Steve on the hand before gathering her things.
Steve knew that telling Tony that he loved him was risky, but he never thought Tony would break up with him. Steve also thought that Tony would reach out to him eventually, but he hadn’t heard one word from Tony in over a year, and Steve didn’t want to make things worse by constantly calling his phone or visiting Stark Tower unannounced.
“I really thought you would have to negotiate. She could really work anywhere she wanted.” Bruce said almost immediately as Shuri disappeared out of sight down the hallway.
“I think we’ll go with this set. What do you think, Parker?” Tony placed Peter back down on the ground next to him before straightening up to look at the numbers.
He then pulled a slender device out of the breast pocket of his jacket, “but it only messes with your biological makeup incrementally to make some of your more distinct facial features a
Tony looked at Steve, thankful he didn’t try to hug him, before looking away once more, sighing heavily. He wanted to believe Steve that this could work, but the reason they were in the mess they were currently in was because he got scared and ran away. He wanted to tell Steve that, especially in light of what Sam told him at the press event, but Steve was with someone else and he was right when he had told Tony he had missed his chance to make things right.
“Rogers!” Clint appeared at the other end of the hallway, “we gotta go!” He waved for Steve as he shouted.
Steve nodded as Tony reached him to kiss him on the cheek. “I’ll see you later, okay?” Tony said as he sprinted out of the bedroom. "Thanks for the quickie!" He then shouted from the hallway.
Tony chuckled as he walked around Steve to look at him from behind. “But you did such a great job last time.”
Steve sighed once more. “…I have to be honest with you…” he inhaled deeply, “…I’ve only been with two people...” He quietly admitted.
Yes, Steve admitted he was attracted to Tony, but sleeping together? Steve hadn’t even processed his feelings that far. And to add insult to injury, Obadiah’s allegation made it seem as if Tony was still living up to his playboy image by sleeping around with everything in sight. Surprisingly, that angered Steve the most. Tony had his moments, but Steve felt like he could trust him.
Maybe Bruce was on to something. Tony ran a replay of the last couple weeks. Steve had been reacting positively toward him, so it was good to see that the first botched simulation hadn’t ruined their working relationship at least. But was there really a strong enough connection for Tony to ask Steve out? Like “out” out, not a random lunch between work colleagues. He still wasn’t sure.
“Hmmm, just happier…” It sounded like Peter had sensed Tony’s uneasiness and attempted to correct himself as much as possible.
you would like to discuss with me, keep it to Synergy, all right? You had your chance to explain yourself, but you blew it. I’m not discussing it with you, okay?”
Pepper watched Tony eat another piece of fruit. “…I talked to Obadiah about Loki’s termination…” She volunteered, her voice lowering as she inched closer toward Tony.
Tony waited a second or so before sliding his phone back into his pocket. He walked up to the nearest console to finish his work.
As Tony explained dinner, Steve, upon entering the kitchen, immediately spotted a small child standing on top a step ladder below the stove top, stirring something in a huge pot with a giant wooden spoon. Steve stopped short from entering; meeting Peter was now the real deal.
Tony looked back and forth at the two women before answering; he was surprised by their abruptness, however, he managed to remain cool.
Tony, who was quite drunk himself from the Jörmungandr, had figured it would be easier to have Steve stay over at his place before driving him home in the morning. He wasn’t planning on anything beyond that, really; he was honestly trying to make sure that Steve did get home in one piece, but it would be easier for him to do so if he slept a few hours first.
“Huh. Who knew making out was the only thing you needed to break the ice with Steve?” Bruce pondered out loud almost as an unintentional joke.
Steve kept smiling before his expression changed slightly. He then walked up to Tony, giving him a tight hug. Tony, somewhat surprised by the suddenness of the hug, took a second before hugging Steve back. They embraced each other for some time before Steve let go to kneel in front of him, which quickly freaked Tony out; he wasn’t sure if Steve was about to propose or offer him a blow job.
After a short while, most of the guests had dispersed to watch a firework show on the waterfront, while some other guests stayed in the main area, listening to the live band. At this point, Tony was sitting by himself, drinking a virgin mojito. He needed the space to clear his head before possibly making a decision he might regret.
“Uh, hey, Rogers…” Tony dragged out, “…are you, uh, busy?” He asked, praying Steve wasn’t about to tell him he was with Sharon.
do great, especially for it being your first time, Rogers. And it’ll only get better, I promise.” Tony offered as he patted Steve on the chest.
Steve stepped forward to prevent Tony from trying to grab Thanos. “Why did you go through all that trouble to damage the Synergy device when you needed it to build your weapon in the first place?” He stepped in front of Tony to keep him behind him, “and why have Loki almost destroy it in the lab explosion?”
Gamora nodded as she reached out a hand to rub her sister’s arm who at first recoiled before settling. Gamora knew all too well what their father was capable of, which is why she had sent the weapon’s data to the Synergy team.
“Fury, can we have a vote about this at least?” Bruce turned to look directly at Fury to avoid acknowledging Steve and Tony.
As soon as they reached the scene, Steve and Tony jumped out of the vehicle. They set themselves up somewhere near the crash but with enough space to generate specs for the equipment.
“Steve, are you serious? You said that the interview went really well. Or that you thought so anyway. And you got a call from—what was her name again? Ms. Potts? She called you the other day. Why would the CEO of Stark Industries take the time to call someone they weren’t planning to accept into the program?” Sam had poured himself a drink, taken a quick picture of Steve with his phone then the two of them together by the time he refuted Steve’s unnecessary worry.
Tony quietly groaned to himself as he tried to unbutton his shirt. Steve nodded before kicking his shoes off. He unbuttoned the first few buttons of his shirt before shuffling up the bed to lie against the headboard while Tony lingered at the edge.
“I don’t know if you remember this…” Tony began in a whisper, “but do you remember when Peter and I were working on some wayward robot and it freaked you out?”
Obadiah took a deep breath. “Let me take a look at it…I remember Howard talking about something a long time ago that may shed some light…”
“Wow, Rogers,” Tony looked around Steve’s office as he walked in further, “this is super nice.” He sat down in front of Steve’s desk, still grinning which both irritated and charmed Steve at the same time.
Tony stared at Steve’s back, thankful that the conversation hadn’t take an ugly turn, but was confused by Steve’s behavior. He would have thought by now that Steve would have said something about the way their relationship ended.
Tony clapped his hands together to indicate he was ready to move on to the labs. “Okay, let’s roll out, gang.”
staying there until we figure out a plan.” He waited for Thor and Natasha to leave with Loki before turning to face the remaining group.
“Um,” he now felt like he was on the verge of crying from all the emotions he was beginning to feel, “why don’t you make sure you’re ready to go? Banner and Rhodey are coming over early, so we can hang out with them for a bit.”
“Okay, gang. Here’s the real deal. Everyone’s suits are in their labs. The material should shield us from whatever this virus is.”
“Steve, you are so hot even when you’re embarrassed.” Tony chuckled, trying to get Steve to let go of the pillow.
Tony turned to face Obadiah who was still very silent. The two men stared at each other as Fury and Pepper continued to comment on the news.
“Steve!” Tony shouted again. He tried to move toward Steve but was stopped by someone grabbing his arm.
Steve turned to face Tony. “Dr. Thanos might use his weapon in less than a month, Tony…we have to let people know…maybe the government could issue a lock down—”
“Uh,” Tony told himself he just needed to focus on Steve, “…I’m glad my original plan of blaming your recovery to avoid this event is finally paying off so we can leave early.”
“Please,” Lupho practically got into Tony’s personal space, also shooting him daggers, “enjoy the party. We’ll have one of our people send for you in a moment.”
Tony nodded at her as he straightened himself out. “Okay, showtime.” He winked at Steve before jogging out onto the stage to an uproarious round of applause.
Tony waited as he ruminated on Steve’s encouragement, which the latter was definitely good at. However, it equally perplexed Tony to hear Steve persist relentlessly about continuing Synergy when it seemed like Steve, based on the argument over the failsafe, was more concerned about safety.
“You wanna get out of here?” Steve quietly asked after pulling away again to look downward at Tony again.
The press pool grew quiet as soon as Steve finished his comment. Everyone else at the table also remained quiet. Tony turned slightly to look at Steve.
Obadiah rolled his eyes as he listened to Pepper a bit longer before gruffly saying goodbye and hanging up.
Steve nodded again, making sure Tony was stable before jumping up to run over to the device. The device was shaking wildly, more so than it had ever done in the past. Steve searched around until he found the slot for the chip, inserting it as firmly as possible. After a few seconds, the device stopped shaking, but it continued glowing an assortment of colors to indicate that it was compromised.
“Okay,” Shuri started up again as she opened up the device, “let’s see what we can finish before leaving this resort…”
Steve let out a whiny noise as he shuffled underneath Tony, but he smiled to convey to Tony that he knew he was attempting to ease his apprehension.
Shuri shook her head. “We can cancel that, Clint. Maybe a government lock down is a good idea, just in case…”
Bruce rolled his eyes as he appeared to be coming up with possible scenarios for his future date with Natasha. Steve was listening, but his ears began to pick up on a conversation next to their huddle.
Tony inhaled sharply as his sometimes-personal doctor and friend, Stephen Strange, shook his head before turning around to close his medical bag. Tony let his feet dangle back and forth while he stayed put on top of his desk. Both men were in Tony’s Stark Industries office.
“Thanks for the flight, T’Challa. That was really nice of you.” Sam straightened himself out as soon as T’Challa let go of him.
Strange nodded with a heavy sigh as he stopped the car in front of Marcus Garvey Park where the medical clinic was housed.
Steve turned around to join Tony. He laughed as he ran a hand through his hair before placing his hands on his hips.
Tony remained calm before responding. “We’re putting the device on lock until we can keep the team safe.”
Steve rolled his eyes with a sigh, but he reciprocated Tony’s expression. He took a deep breath before positioning the device underneath his chin just as Tony had done before. He closed his eyes and clicked the button, anticipating the worst. He felt a little prick before his face went numb. His eyes widened as Tony leaned forward to watch his facial features morph.
Mr. Beck coolly clasped his hands together. “The policy at the school dictates that for any serious academic offense, we speak to the parent, parents, or,” he looked directly at Steve and Tony, “guardian or guardians of the student in person.”
“…hey, Sam…” Bucky’s tone dropped as he walked slowly into the kitchen to perch himself against a counter.
Steve shook his head, still trying to understand what Tony was asking him. “Of course not, Tony. Isn’t that…physically impossible?”
“…Mr. Stane only served as a cog in the wheel. He wanted to take the company away from you, Mr. Stark, and would stop at nothing to do so. Once he handed over the device, I was planning to eliminate him…tying of up loose ends as it were. You know it goes.”
To Tony, however, it still felt as if Steve wasn’t bothered by the kiss. He wasn’t sure how to interpret it; Steve’s behavior over the last day and a half had appeared completely different from when he ran out the morning after the party. But Tony told himself not to be weird; if it came up, it came up. Right now, he was just having a nice dinner with a friend…
Tony laughed back way too loudly. “You know me!” He turned around to walk over to Bruce, holding his tablet out, “also, here are the drawings for some safety uniforms.”
Tony joined him at the console, equally frustrated. Above the console was a projection of the scant amount of information the team knew about Thanos’s weapon. And next to it was a list of the random sequences that had been sent to Tony the past week. Tony and Bruce were at Stark Enterprises earlier in the day to discuss the mysterious email and perhaps its connection to the super weapon.
“Obie, I swear to God,” Tony inched himself further into Obadiah’s personal space as he felt himself losing his patience, “if I find out you had
Bruce and Tony were walking through one of the glass corridors after one of the team’s weekly Project Synergy meetings. Tony had been avoiding Steve most of the morning and during the meeting; he was still too nervous to ask him over for dinner.
Tony pressed a button. “We now have full access to a material resource called vibranium.” A holographic image of a tube containing a glowing blue substance appeared in the air above the table. Everyone, if they weren’t already standing, rose out of their chairs to look closer at the image.
Steve took his time before responding. “I’ll only do the promotional tour if Tony comes along. He and I are a team.”
Steve looked away, embarrassed that Tony’s comment made him blush even though he was still irritated with his behavior.
Tony couldn’t believe the progress he was making with Steve. He knew he was pushing his limits, but Steve seemed to be enjoying it. And, although he insistently teased his lab mate for preferring to stay in to going out most nights, Tony could easily picture himself spending one of those nights with Steve.
Tony was taken aback. He remembered that there had been some fiasco related to planning that day, but he had forgotten that it had something to do with Pepper’s birthday. Yet, that couldn’t have been the reason why Pepper left. But before he could say anything Pepper continued.
Tony turned his head to look directly at Steve. “Well…I’m glad you didn’t…you saved my ass, Rogers.”
He waited as Tony slowly looked up at him; his face was streaked from a few tears. “Peter’s parents died the same way mine did…”
Tony laughed nervously as he finally let go of Steve. “I thought a salad would be the easiest thing to contribute to a meal that will be no doubt delicious.” He grinned at Steve.
Steve stayed on the bed, still deciding whether he should leave. After a while, he got up from the bed to walk out onto the balcony. He found Sharon speaking with Natasha, but there was no sign of Tony. Steve told himself that they should probably stay at the party a little longer, just not to make a scene before heading out.
Tony was standing in a group with Rhodey and Pepper out on his balcony, discussing everything except business. It was nice having such a great group of friends, Tony thought as he listened to Rhodey detail his and Pepper’s vacation plans together. However, listening to his friends made him miss Steve even more, giving Tony more confidence to show how much he cared about him and missed him.
“You’re breaking hearts all over the world anytime someone pays you a compliment, Rogers.” He continued to smile as he joined Thor and Bruce out in the hallway.
Tony could feel the temperature in his body raise, but he tried to remain calm in order not to get into it with one of his dearest friends.
“Just that Tony Stark seems as much of a jerk as his celebrity personae.” Bucky scoffed. Steve had told his friend over the phone how unapproachable Tony had appeared during the interview. And of course, Bucky had been more annoyed than Steve.
Tony looked at Steve as if he were confronting a scared animal, taking his time stepping out the shower before reaching for a towel.
The last time anyone had called Tony reckless—and it stung—was his dad. The memory blinded Tony with rage; this person he was beginning to trust, his so-called “teammate”, or whatever the hell was going on between the two of them, was treating him like a petulant child in front of everyone.
Steve pushed his body more into Tony’s. “Ah. Yes,” Tony started as he began to wake up fully, “I guess it is morning.”
Tony cringed before letting out a weird cough, shuffling around meaninglessly before he answered Steve.
Pepper smiled, although it was weaker than usual. “Tony, it’ll be okay. And I’m going to keep you updated, all right?” She let go of the elevator door before stepping in. She waved as Tony waved back at her.
The blast had injured Steve while also causing severe damage to Tony’s lab and the labs surrounding it. The main corridor leading to the labs had been emptied at the time of the explosion, so Steve had been the only person to sustain a significant injury.
Obadiah pointed behind himself to call attention to the entire board and Fury. “I would like to show them the device, Dr. Banner.” He grinned, which looked a little menacing, but Bruce remained unfazed.
Tony tapped on the tablet, finding the construction documents and the codes, and Steve grabbed the Synergy device. Tony motioned for Steve to follow him out, walking through the first floor, avoiding other guests and security guards before finding the stairs to the basement level.
Steve returned to studying the vibranium core. He took a notebook out of his bag and began quickly sketching. He jotted down a few notes around the drawing of the core before closing his notebook.
Dr. Selvig nodded as he took a deep breath. “I was the one who tampered with the device for the board presentation, but I did not attack Mr. Barton…”
“Is this yours, Rogers? And how did I miss this the last time I was here?” Tony pointed at the bike with a toothy smile.
Some crumpled-up pieces of an iron frame that once held up a section of the bleachers landed in front of the group. Ned screamed as Peter pulled him further away from the rubble.
And like that, the end of the month finally arrived, and Steve and Sam were on their way to the Stark Industries board event.
“Of course, Steve.” Steve could see out of the corner of his eye Sam giving him that infamous goofy grin.
Steve could feel Tony letting him take control, but he wasn’t sure how long he should continue. Tony smiled through the kiss before placing a hand on Steve’s chest. He bit the bottom half of his lip as he looked upward at Steve. Steve smiled back, pulling away, inciting a subdued laughing fit between the two.
stupid. He did come all the way to Brooklyn to talk to you, Cap.” He chuckled as he jabbed Steve in the side a few times, but Steve barely responded.
the program to really participate.” Obviously emphasizing “running” in response to Steve’s comment about Tony being in charge.
“I think we have the algorithm functioning more or less how we want it. We should be able to create scenarios out of this, also.” Tony turned to face Steve and smiled. “Good job, Rogers. This is great work.”
“That sounds like a plan to me,” Tony added before pointing in Clint’s direction, “Barton, go with Thor and Romanov to S.H.I.E.L.D. We may need more eyes on Loki…I don’t buy that he’s telling us everything.”
Steve made a cute whiny noise as he let Tony hold onto him, turning his head to a degree to kiss Tony who was in the process of nestling his nose against his ear. Tony turned some more, ending with half his body on top of Steve. He breathed deeply before pressing his lips against Steve’s again, moaning quietly as he pushed downward into Steve, but not too much.
“How long is he staying?” Peter asked trying to get out of his seat. Tony reached over to help him with the belt.
Tony smiled back, but his attitude was diffident. He was still worried about the future of Synergy and whatever the hell Obadiah was doing to try to stop it. However, he could feel Steve’s sincerity, knowing that the two of them would try to work together despite the odds.
“…after the trip to the Hamptons…I…ugh…” Tony rubbed his forehead with his free hand, “…this whole thing is a nightmare because of me…” He groaned.
“Rogers,” Tony motioned toward Steve with one hand before Fury could respond, “I get why you’re not pleased, but, as you
Steve groaned as his eyes flickered opened from the morning light. He shifted, realizing that Tony was lying halfway on top of him, sleeping soundly. He smiled as he rubbed Tony’s back before turning toward the bedside table to check the time. It was early in the morning, so he still had some time before needing to meet up with Bucky and Sam for brunch.
“I’m usually better at holding my balance…” Steve muttered, finally getting up to sit down in his seat. His face was rosy but that was mostly from feeling Tony squeeze his body before letting go.
But Steve didn’t seem to notice as he began talking to Tony about Synergy and Sam and Shuri’s upcoming wedding. They talked for some time before Tony thought he should ask about Sharon to ensure Steve that he was trying at their friendship, although it still hurt to know that he most likely missed his chance with Steve.
Tony smiled wearily at them before shuffling around. “Peter, what if you sleep on top of me that way Steve can squeeze in? It’ll be tight, but we can make it work.”
Tony nodded slowly; the feeling he had earlier when he was on the bed with Steve appeared again and he couldn’t make up an excuse this time.
Part of him appreciated that Steve hadn’t taken a picture of the core on a smartphone, which would have been impossible anyway since his lab partner didn’t own one.
Tony smiled as best as he good, laughing quietly. “Thanks…Rogers…thank you for that…everyone else is okay?”
“Of course…I’ll send you an encrypted email as soon as I get back to the Tower…or…” he shuffled back and forth on his feet, “I can call you? Your number is still the same, right?”
“Tony, I did my homework and cleaned my room…can I stay at the party later?” Peter asked as he watched Tony finish getting ready.
The staffer nodded back slowly again before backing out of the room, thanking Obadiah once more for participating in the conference. Obadiah groaned loudly as soon as the door closed. He then placed the briefcase he was carrying carefully on top of the table. He inhaled deeply, reminding himself to remain calm, thankful he had made it to the island without any incident. He took a moment, breathing deeply, his hands trembling as he opened the briefcase.
“Now in other news. Having trouble keeping taps on your children? Hammer Industries has created an insertable chip that lets you monitor their
Obadiah shot Tony the widest, unnerving grin. “Of course, Anthony. It’s good to hear that your team is doing
Tony laughed. “I think you’re right about taking a break from the whole relationship thing, but sex with you is
Tony carefully pushed open the door to the conference room. The sound emitting from the device sounded like a broken, scratched record. He frowned before taking his time walking over to it, tapping on his earpiece.
“Sure, of course. I’ve been in unpredictable situations before, but this is something completely different altogether.” Steve walked up to one of the consoles to investigate its features. He pressed a button and an image of the Synergy device appeared from thin air. Steve could hardly keep himself from gawking.
“Sam and dearest friends!” T’Challa gleefully greeted as he approached the plane with his guards, “it appears that you all have arrived smoothly! Hopefully everything was to your liking.”
“You and your husband are very cute.” Tony’s billiard escort observed as they walked out of the main space.
Agent Hill nodded before exiting the room. Natasha turned to look at the footage again; her brow furrowed with resolution.
Fury changing the teams so suddenly was something Steve had wondered about but didn’t give much consideration until Natasha mentioned it. Maybe Fury had figured that their opposing personalities would work better together? It was either that or they would end up killing each other.
“I really appreciate that. But he probably just needs a close friend right now…I can always talk to him when you guys get back…”
“Hey!” The unexpected sound of Tony’s voice nearly caused Steve to jump out of the tub, “you made it to the tub! Nice work, Rogers.”
After a second, he propped himself up, looking around at what he could see in his office from the floor. He looked down at his dad’s diary before looking past the desk to see the time on the wall clock.
Tony finally broke away from Steve, but he walked back toward the bed. “He has nightmares, Steve. He’ll wake up and call for me and…I won’t be there—He’ll probably think I abandoned him!” He started hyperventilating while clenching his chest.
