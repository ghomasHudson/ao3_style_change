“Why are you so chill about me and all this?” Peter gestured to himself and the suit which was laid out on the coffee table. “Like your son from the future, is a crime fighting man dressed as a spider, who can walk on walls and break them too!” Tony snorted a bit, “ok, do I actually say you’re a man, first off?” Peter whined again, “No, but my name is Spider MAN! For your information!”
“Yes, sir, just a headache from the noise, my ears are just really sensitive to it.” Steve nodded, if he was honest with the kid, he would have been doing the same, he’d asked the DJ to turn down the music a bit when he walked in, it helped with the pain, but it wasn’t brilliant for him, especially after a 14-hour flight in the back of an old war bomber aircraft.
arm, his chest rapidly rising and falling, his gaze miles away. “Petey I need you here with me right now, I love you buddy, please listen to me.” He couldn’t break his view away from the assassin just incase he attacked while focused on Peter. Steve stepped forward, shield at the ready next to his future self. Focused solely on the Winter Soldier in front of him. Throwing his shield forward, the Soldier caught it in his outstretched hand. What he wasn’t expecting was the second shield catching him on his side, sending him flying sideways, landing face down in the dirt. Steve stepped forward carefully to collect his discarded shield.
“I never finished my art college because it was far too expensive for me to do, I was practically homeless, our family landlord was just very kid. Only when I became a Captain, that I could actually afford to buy the flat.” Steve wiggled his toes in his boots, stretching out his arms and shoulders above his head, “Art school was well and truly forgotten when the war started, I’d only been going for a year when I had to stop. Starting back up had been nice but incredibly…”
Steve shook his head. “They don’t work for me kid. I’ll be fine in an hour or so.” Peter felt numb, anytime his Pops was injured was in charge of making sure he took his pain medication. Steve would always get two pain pills to take and Peter would get two skittles, it was only fair, they would take them together and then his Pops would feel better but… His Pops can’t use painkillers?
Steve remember a time when they would share a drink, not like it would work for him, but a drink while Howard would repair the bike in some way, usually a broken brake or handlebar. They would chat away, not about much, but Steve remembers, days before the final assault, Howard explained that he wanted out the war, he wanted to leave the front line. He wanted a family, he was interest in a dame working at his labs. Smart women he’d said. Steve wondered if he’d actually been talking about Maria.
Peter was too tired to remember that it wasn’t his actual parents who were taking care of him.  Tony stilled at the mention of him as a Dad, he couldn’t answer it seriously without Steve wondering what was going on! But before Tony could even sneak out the room to avoid the question, Steve knelt down beside the bed where he had been smoothing out Peter’s hair, “Shhhs, just sleep kiddo, we will sort everything in the morning.” Steve stood up and gently guided Tony and himself out the door. Peter shuffled in the navy and red tartan sheets, turning over to his other shoulder, he managed to let out, “Sure thing Pops...” Steve shrugged his shoulders, finally free of the combat suit, he quietly closed the bedroom door.
Peter nodded, not trusting his voice to carry him through another conversation. Tony gripped tightly on to Peter’s hand and lead him through to Steve’s room. He sat Peter on the edge of the bed. Tony cautiously took a step back and walked into the cupboard, reaching up to pull a very dusty shoe box off the shelf. He sat the box next to Peter and knelt down on to the ground in front of the bed. Peter’s hand rested in his lap. No energy left to move. “Before we go back to campus, I think you should hold on to this until you head home. Steve gave it to me last summer while we were fixing up this place.” Tony lifted the lid carefully off the top of the box. A couple of boxes sat covered in a thin layer of dust, Tony reached in and took out the one that seemed the cleanest.
Steve looked down and matched Peter’s hesitant but gentle smile, “definitely churros T, want to get the car and we will meet you out front?” Tony looked over the railing down to Steve, he was sweating, his hair matted to his forehead, Tony had frozen, but Steve ran straight after Peter, he was so good with him, Tony was glad that Steve was back. He needed him now, more than ever. “Ok, Steve, 10 minutes max, front door. Ok?”
“Why would you do that Tony!?” Steve looked flabbergasted, “I can protect you I swear, I will take more bullets if that is what is necessary, please don’t make me leave T.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s chest and Steve did the same on top of Tony’s arms. “I can’t watch you get shot on my behalf, not again, you said you were the Captain to protect the little guy, well, that guys going to kill more people besides me, I want you doing what you do best, finding the bad guy and beating them up.”
“You have no idea.”
wasn’t very scientific he could organise and repair anything they were building.
“I’m being chased? Hunted? I’m not sure if he was after me or you to be perfectly honest but he’s called the Winter soldier, i’ve seen him a few times, never more than a moment before I just leave, sometimes I didn’t grab my stuff, I just ran. He terrifies me dad.” Peter was barely audible as he finished. Steve was close to losing it, if he was honest with himself, he just wanted to get Peter home then go find this Soldier who thinks it’s ok to threaten his son, or anyone for that matter. “Pops, I don’t know what to do. He’s going to find here. I can’t… I’m so tired of it.” Steve wrapped his arm around Peter’s shoulder, pulling him into his chest as the tears burst through the dam. Peter’s body was wrecked by the sobs as his Pop’s heart broke.
“Well we need to find out where the first plan is. If you think its suspicious we need to find it first.” Clint turned to pick up more papers. Steve stood frozen, fidgeting with his glove straps. He had a choice to make, go find the source of the problem, whatever the solider was looking for it could be at this bunker. Or go and protect Tony. A personal conflict for him. This had never really happened to him before, what he wants to do is not the best decision, but he actively stopping himself from turning the truck around to go find Tony and hide him from Howard.
He’d failed his …only family before he’d even had the chance to experience it. He’d spied on Peter before he’d even said hello to his own son!
“Well, I tried, you’re alone for dinner tonight then, because I’ll be at the Bay Harbour Restaurant at 7pm. So, then what are you doing for dinner.” Peter sighed a little, he jumped off the counter and opened the cupboard behind him, shutting it again and check the fridge. “I’ll make some soup or something?” Tony gave a shrug and ‘yeah sounds good’ face.
“Clint, have you got any …. architecture contacts, military buildings, more specifically?”
Steve smiled, stretching out his leg to gently poke Natasha with his sock covered foot. “I’ll handle it.” Peter let out a grumble as his fingers slowly stretched out across Steve’s chest. “Hey Petey,” Steve spoke softly as he caressed Peter’s hair.
Tony couldn’t take his eyes off of Peter, who stool wrapped in Peggy’s arms, clutching tightly his Pop’s glove between his fingers. Tears running down his checks dripping quickly to the floor. Steve tried not to show it, but he even had tears in his eyes. The kid looked devasted, to have been so close to home and have it right in front of him, to have it taken away indefinitely. He couldn’t really process what he had just seen, a much older Tony Stark, who had exhausted himself to find a way to get his son home, his facial hair and general appearance unkept. But the biggest surprise was of himself at the end.
“See Howard, I told you, he wasn’t here.” Steve said, moving to his default Captain voice and stance. Peter could see the tension in his shoulders as his nerves of the situation got the best of him. “DON’T You start Steve!” Howard whipped round to face Steve, Tony leaned forward slightly to get a better angle on the situation as his father stalked forward to him.
They Had Lied To Him. Peggy Lied To Him.
We need to get to the cabin first!” The soldier stopped firing at the truck when the clip ran out. He stood over the middle line in the road. Titling his head as the truck sped off into the distance, disappearing over the slight dip of the hill. He turned on his heels. Walking across the tarmac to stand by the side of the road. He unlocked the clip, allowing it to drop to the floor, he reload his rifle. raising his arms he braced against his shoulder, he fired a single shot down the road. The driver of an off-road 4x4 collapsed on the ATV. The vehicle rolled to a stop a few feet from the soldier. He made his way over to the vehicle, pulling the body off, he dragged it towards the ditch in the woods. Chucking the body in, he kicked over some fallen branches.
Steve quietly stopped laughing along with the pair, he forgot how rich Tony was sometimes, he didn’t need to struggle with bills or rubbish apartments, but he stayed with Steve, sat through broken heating in the dead of winter, not eating because they didn’t have decent money but if he wanted Tony could have bought and replaced the entire apartment block.
His Dad was typing furiously, Steve’s hands were massaging Tony’s shoulders, gently in circles. Steve moved his head down next to Tony’s, looking up to whatever he was typing. Peter dropped his hands slowly by his side. His parent’s both smiled up to the camera, “Peter,” His Dad said up to the camera, “You’ve been gone 34 hours 10 minutes. We’ve determined that you’re not dead.” His Pop’s squeezed his eye shut at the thought.
“Drinks on me next month Anthony!  You, me and the grand bar in the New York Tower? What do you say?” Stane leaned over the top of Tony his arm resting on the wall next to him, his presence trying to over shadow Tony. Peter stood up, making his body as intimidating as possible. This was just ugly and uncomfortable flirting. “Ok, like you said, I’m up now, I saw you Stane, time to leave so I can ‘get up and go.’” Peter tried to channel his Pop’s attitude toward sleazy characters, ‘always act like the bigger man, kill them with kindness.’
Steve’s hand reached under the edge of the carrying pocket, he pulled the photo out gently. He flipped it over. Read it to himself and then dropped down onto his knees, his entire body shaking violently.  He couldn’t believe it. This was
“You did well kid. If you want, you’re more than welcome to join me again, that was a good run, but you better get showered and dressed, we’ll need to head to Shield soon.” Steve clapped his hand on Peter’s back, pulling his hand away he wiped his hand on his running joggers, removing Peter’s sweat from his hands. Peter was just lying on the couch, his muscles refusing to move due to exhaustion, he quickly realised at the start of the run that his Pops had always gone easy on him when it came to running, 90s Steve Rogers certainly did not hold back, he was struggling within the first 10 minutes, missing his Pops words of encouragement to keep going.
Clint was pacing around the truck, checking round every corner incase Steve appeared, when he finally spotted Steve approaching, he gave him a thumbs up when he saw the transmitter. He excitedly grabbed the transmitter and hopped up into the truck bed. Steve leaned in the passenger side door to grab the large battery and connector cables.
The shield ricochet off the far concrete wall, flying into the back of the Hydra agent’s neck. The body flew forward towards Steve. He held his hand out expectantly, aiming to grip the agent’s neck. He squeezes tightly, using his upper arm strength to throw the agent against the closest wall next to him. He continues to push forward down the hall. The agent collapsed down on to the floor. Clint held position up on the cat walk, bow and arrow drawn as protection over Steve’s shoulder. It wasn’t needed. Steve has been, in Clint’s opinion, on a rampage. He teased him with revenge, but Steve had taken it as gospel. His rampage had cleared the east coast of one of Shield’s largest threats. His grief’s a powerful and depressing motivator, according to the compulsory Shield psychologist, due to the serum’s power. Clint could barely keep up with the one-man army on days like this. He’d barely even had time to come to terms with Stark family’s death himself, but watching the guilt, eat his new friend apart, has been hard to watch.
“Guys, can you give us a moment?” Steve looked round the room to the other avengers, they all nodded in response, “We’ll be upstairs, portal opens in fifteen minutes so we’ll come back down in ten. Keep it PG guys!” Clint patted Steve’s back and followed everyone up the concrete stairs, conversing between themselves, everyone could feel the tension rising, they were so close to getting him home. Steve placed his hands on his hips, just resting above his belt, shaking his head as he chuckled to himself. “Are we that bad?” Steve looked over to Tony who was finishing up code with Friday displaying it above his head, helping as best as a program could.
“Don’t tell your Pops but he’s a sentimental icicle and he always kept two photos on his person at all times, one of all of us on your 3
“Two minutes.” Tony gave a terse smile. “How do I look?” Steve turned on his hips, posing with the Shield. “Strange to see you back in the avenger suit. I thought you preferred the stealth suit?” Steve agreed, “I do, but it’s my most advanced suit and if Shield aren’t going to co-operate then I don’t want them getting a peak ahead. It's too tempting for them.” The avengers bounded down the stairs as one large group, “Come on, let’s get our boy Peter back home, shall we?” Tony rolled his eyes at Sam’s statement, “Yes, Let us get my young Nephew back from the loneliest world he’s been stuck in.” Everyone just stopped for a moment, Tony slapped a hand on Thor’s shoulder, gripping it tightly, it would have cause great pain if it wasn’t the shoulder of a God, “You always have a way with words. Thor.”
“Cereal is in the top cupboard there or there is toast, I’m just going to grab a chair to bring the cereal down.” Tony said as he went to grab one of the dinner room chairs that didn’t have any paper work stacked on top of it.
The lost dream, a twinge of sadness ruined the fantasy however, he wasn’t married, Tony wasn’t even his boyfriend let alone seeing anyone on earth, Peter was a weird kid that he’s assigned to protect. He wanted to go see his Ma, go ask her way he was so… lonely.  “Uh earth to Steve? You ok?” Steve shook his head lightly to break him from his stupor. “Yeah, sorry Peter was having a nightmare, so I just helped him get back to sleep.” He made his way towards his side of the bed, climbing in under the sheets. Tony placed the delicate journal back onto the bedside table and turned the lamp off. They both slid down into the bed at the same time, manoeuvring to get comfortable.
a double thumbs up,
“HEY NEPHEW! YOU MISS ME?!” Peter tried to stick his arms between himself and his Uncle’s sweaty tactical suits creating some distance. “Help!?” Peter cried out, “ He hasn’t showered for like 3 days!” Steve used his good arm to prop himself off the couch, as Tony held out his arms to help Steve if he needed some balance. “Bird-man drop my kid!” Tony called out as he walked over to inspect the gauntlet left behind by the villain, that Thor held out to him. Peter managed to push himself away by slipping out of his navy hoodie.
Rhodes nodded once again, taking in the appearance of the
“I’ll be fit for training tomorrow, for today, it’s a family day.” Steve signaled behind him to the photos laid out of the large glass table.
Getting changed he decided that he needed to tidy his room as he hadn’t unpacked yet but before he could Jarvis invited him downstairs for a late lunch with himself and Ana. Peter followed Jarvis down to the kitchen. The trio sat in relative quiet until they heard Howard and Maria call for help from Jarvis, who quickly made his way up to help. Peter rubbed his hair in different directions and decided to get up and check on Tony. He ran into Howard as stepped into the hallway. Peter almost wanted to growl at him. God where was Pops when you need him.
coming home but it was getting late in the day and he was starting to get worried, worried enough that he’d been pacing the workshop. Tony adjusted his waist coat for the umpteenth time, Dum_Ee watched as Tony paced around his desk, checking the screen every passing for the call signal of
“Hello Peter and Boss. How can I help today? Is everything ok?” Tony changed his mind, he was in love. Technology is amazing. “Hey Karen can you search the local area for an apartment immediately available to rent that are reasonably priced.”
Peter made his way over to sit on the other couch, he just wanted to listen, these were going to be his last moments with his grandparents… he looked to his left on the couch, finding the Monopoly dog, he looked up to Maria as his hand snuck across the couch to grab it. When she closed her eyes briefly in a passionate moment of the piece of music, Peter threw it at Tony’s foot, the one that was exposed from the bottom of the blanket.
Tony, reached over to grab his jacket from behind Clint, throwing his arms over his head to swing the matching suit jacket on, “Friday, call me the mark forty-three suit. I want this as compact as possible.” Tony walked forward to lean over the back of Natasha bench, to steal a bite or two of her forgotten peanut butter sandwich. Chewing it loudly Tony, balanced it between his teeth as his
Peter final was able to get up and help with the clean-up team, he carried through the heavy wooden cheese boards as Tony helped clean up the wine glasses. Ana made the small clean-up team some hot chocolates for all their hard work and the fact that it was their unofficial Christmas. They chatted in the kitchen for a while before Ana started to yawn, making sure everything was locked up for the night. As Peter made his way up to his room, and into his bed, he lay awake through the night, debating to himself whether to tell Tony what was about happen.
“Dude I understand this is big news, but surely you’re happy? Excited? Elated? You’re Peter’s Father! He’s your kid!” Clint tilted his head in confusion at Steve’s tears. Steve whistled again. “Clint. Peter died. My adoptive son, is dead.” Clint’s mouth formed a small ‘o’. “Steve … I’m so sorry… I didn’t think about it, like that…” Steve stopped crying, he looks out into the space at the front of the tent, silently pushing the photo back into the glove. He’d think more on this later. Steve used the tips of his fingers to push himself back up into a crouching position, he turned to look at Clint, who had silently reached for his bow. Steve heard the crunch of a branch just outside the west side of the tent. He wasn’t stupid, they’re outnumbered, he let out a whistle, relaxing his mind, trying to hear further out. Eight maybe nine soldiers, armed. Steve looked over his shoulder to Clint, his eyebrow arched in return. “Huh. Guess we aren’t alone.”
Tony threw his note book against the wall. Ana jumped in her skin while standing in the door. “Édesem, its late, please go to bed.” Tony looked up from the desk, using his sleeve to
“Carter! Where is he!? Where are you hiding my son?!” Howard roared. Peter gave a small jump at the shock of the voice. “I saw him walk in here Carter. Where is he!?” Peggy stood prim and proper with her stance and gave a sarcastic tone, “Oh, is he your son now Howard? I thought it was the destroyer of property, or the Brat? Hmm, what is it this time Howard?” Steve rushed into the room seconds later, trying to find Tony and get him out of there, while trying to act casual to Howard.
Stane made a non-committal hum, he sounded distracted, Tony could hear multiple female and male voices in the background. “Tony, come on! You don’t need to worry about that anymore! Look you’ll be my assistant CEO in the company, take some of your father’s shares and you won’t ever need to worry again about anything!” Tony thumped his hand back down on the desk, “You want better weapons? I need to have access to the development and academic community, So I’m finishing my PHD. I’ll do that and you can enjoy your strip club lunch. Fair?” Obadiah just laughed. “You got me there Tony. Designs. My desk. tomorrow.” The phone clicked as it was hung up. Tony placed the phone slowly back on its holder, he took a moment to breathe. He moved round the grab the glass decanter filled with an expensive whisky. Nothing but the best for Howard Stark.
She stops just short of the top of the nearby hill they’ve been walking up, Peter could spot a bench sat just before the peak, “I put this here after my father died, he loved to watch the morning sun rise and watch the birds, I know we’ve missed the sunrise, but do you mind if we sit with the birds? Just for a little while?” Peter smiled back, releasing the tensions for his shoulders, he nodded enthusiastically.
The slightly wrinkling around his eyes showed that his youthful years were long gone, the crease in his forehead wrinkle more pronounced, maybe even years of stress showing their tole but even Natasha had to admit. This Steve Rogers was hot. She corrected herself while crossing her arms with a content smile. Steve Stark.
Thanks once again see you in the next chapter!
“Was Peter ok? He’s really torn up about this, not that I’m not freaking the fuck out.” Tony laid on his side facing the middle of the shared bed. Steve turned over to face Tony, seeing his outline in the dark, “He really misses his parents, I wish he could go home now but he’s a target now more than ever, I’d rather keep him safe.” Tony hummed in agreement, “Thanks Steve, night.”
“ NO!  you can’t it’s bad enough that I’m here but like my blood like leaves a footprint of me being here, and if it gets into the wrong hands It could change the course of science! And to the rest of your questions, yes, yes, yes and no I don’t feel the blood rushing to my head up here.” Peter thought about the effects his blood could have in this time period. His mind wandered to the thought of his Uncle Bruce testing out his super solider serum on himself in a few years’ time, if he’d had access to his blood, things might have ended up a little different for him. Peter did have some of his Pop’s super strength and speed from just being his son but not enough to ever worry about but once the spider bit him, his Pop’s serum activated in his blood.
“When did they stop working for you…?” Steve noticed Peter staring at the star on the Captain America suit, “Since the serum kicked in, I can take them, they just do little to nothing. Tony’s been trying to make me some for a year or so now to help.” Steve sighed and leaned back against the counter, “It sucks but I can shrug off most explosives so there has to be a trade-off.”
“I don’t know but it’s fine right? We will figure it out!” Always the positive take with this Tony, his Dad was slightly less accepting of a positive outcome nowadays. Peter looked drained, the past couple of days finally setting in that he just wasn’t going home anytime soon without doing something about it. Tony decided Peter needed cheering up, of course the worst idea to choose from, would be Tony Stark’s. “We should head out, let’s get a beer at the student Union, cheap and cheerful, to celebrate moving in!” Peter gave his father incredulous look. “But! I’m 17 and I definitely don’t pass for 21, even my Pop’s doesn’t think so! I can’t we should just stay in! yeah stay in!”
Peter then jumped to the ceiling to create the most distance between his Uncle in the immediate moment. Steve looked up to his son on the ceiling while standing under him, “Son, trainers off when on the ceiling, we don’t want marks up there.” Peter leaned over to pull off his trainers, he hesitated before throwing them at his Uncle Clint. Barely breaking a new sweat Clint moved out the way of each of the trainers, “pssst. Try harder next time kid.” Clint called out before turning to Steve, “how you holding up team leader?”
, “I was a day early to our wedding, it’s truly surprising I let you go alone. Really it was a matter of time.” Tony smiled down to Peter, who had been laughing at his Dad’s impatience. “Love you guys.”
Peter pulled the mask off his head, quickly stuffing it back into the wrist shooter. His Uncle ran up and kneeled down on one knee beside him. “You ok kid?” Peter coughed but nodded. Romanoff made a move to continue the chase when Barton shouted out. “Don’t. He’s long gone, and you know it.” Romanoff stopped two steps short of the edge of the roof. Considering the jump before looking back to Barton, her tone was confusion mixed with a hint of anger. “He’s not far. Why wait? End this now.” Barton looked the kid up and down, helping him sit up before patting his back. “The shadows are his friend not ours. Besides he’ll appear again. The kid needs help anyway.”
Tony took the last step forward before Steve could reach him, Steve took his hand in his own, yanking his friend wrist down, catching him into his lap, wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders and waist, catching Tony as he let out a rough shout of surprise from the fall, Tony took a second to look up at Steve. “Hey Ste.”
Jarvis stood by and watched as Tony once again lost himself into the work of his father. The smoke infused office didn’t help with the separation between Tony and Howard, his office, a dark space filled with emerald green walls and more liquor than books. Tony had found himself coming to his father’s office most days, sometimes he wouldn’t leave the living room couch for a day or two. But always back here. At work, where he can do better. Everyone is counting on him. He just really wished they didn’t need him all at once. He ran his hand through his hair again, the phone rang on Howar- his desk. Roughly he grabbed the phone, missing his grip once, he must be sobering up. He’d need to fix that. “Stark.” Tony used his hand to nodded and point towards the door for Jarvis and Ana to leave, Jarvis sighed taking his wife’s hand as they left. “Tony, my boy! How’s those designs coming along? Our stock is through the roof in the last months, just doing a house call, checking you’re alright and all that!” Tony thumped his head down onto the desk.
That was totally his Dad, they were even wearing the same t-shirt, the
He missed his best friend.
“I know it’s going to be a challenge with all your other senses on overload but actually seeing the space you’re in can help limit your brain reaching outside this boundary.” Peter slowly released the tension in his eyes, opening them slowly to stare at the cream ceiling. He let out a whistle.
Steve threw his entire body back on to the bed and stretched out and closed his eyes in a relaxed position, taking a moment for himself, Peter dropped the finished pillows at the top of the bed, “Been a while since you slept in a bed?” Steve hummed, eyes still closed with his arms crossed over his chest. “Caves, rocks and shield issued sleeping bags are no substitute for Tony’s fancy feather pillows.” Steve slowly raised up and began to rip off parts of the suit into its different panels. Peter made his way to the bed room door.
Peter ran down the hallway until he reached the staircase, he jumped towards the far wall on the landing level then jumped back down towards the lower level door. Peter entered in the door code for the lab and shut it behind him when he entered. The gauntlet had began discharging purple sparks at random intervals. “From your Pop’s tactical files this seems like a last resort action from the gauntlet. It seems to think it’s in danger. I’d stay back Peter till your fathers arrive” Karen chimed in. Peter shot his webs at the blackboard and pulled it with good yank towards himself, Dum-EE whistled in appreciation for the protection from the light show going on. “Karen, how do I shut this down!? We poked at it for hours today and nothing happened! What do I even do?!” Sliding behind his Dad’s workbench, Peter grabbed one of his Dad’s wrenches and chucked it towards the gauntlet. It collided with the gauntlet with a gentle ping before bounce off towards the floor.
“No but… me? I’ve drank enough in the last two weeks to make my doctor faint, does that sound like dad material, someone you want watching your kids, huh?” Tony sighs, “I’d be a great role model.” he scoffed at his own sarcastic comment. Peggy took his hand in hers, “Anthony, please come with me and see the boy and his father. I feel it would give the peace of mind you need to see the bigger picture, a positive future.” Tony swallowed but his throat was so dry, it stuck slightly. “I… ok.” Tony slowly turned to his desk,
Wipe away a couple of tears in his eyes. “Ana, I just … I can’t get this equation to work and I need it to finish my thesis presentation and Obi called and...” Ana quickly made her way over to Tony, wrapping her arms over his shoulders, covering his eyes with one of her palms. The other gently running through the front of his hair, she let out a gentle shhhs, in Tony’s ear. She gently pulled him up and out of Howard’s chair. She let go of his head but took one of his and lead him through the house to the kitchen. Jarvis heard the pair coming in, he’d set the table for three, just in case Tony ever joined them, but quickly placed the pot down to grab an extra plate. By the time Tony had been placed down in the chair, Jarvis had begun to plate up dinner.
The thunderous noise grew, coming closer and closer to him. He squeezed his eyes closed when the thunder struck overhead. “Peter! I have been looking all over America for you, where is the young leader of Iron?” Peter opened his eyes to his Uncle who was inspecting the room around him quickly. His short cape flowing around his shoulders. “He’s not here Uncle. He kicked me out.” Thor whipped his head around to Peter, “Young Tony, kicked you out of his home?”
Frozen in their position for a minute before they heard Peter from down the hall, “Sorry, didn’t realise I was interrupting something.” With a sly smile on his face and a knowing smirk that was there for just a second. They quickly tried to get up into a standing position, smoothing down their clothes but not really making distance between each other. Steve coughed awkwardly, “Uh, ready to go Kid?” Peter smiled innocently, “ready when you are!” Peter made his way towards the front door, laughing to himself on what he had just seen. His parents always acting like that, they would dance and one of them would drop or dip the other and they would just stay like that for a minute, just taking in each other’s appearance.
“Peter, that was the coolest moment of my life so far.” Tony said in a sort of daze. “Let’s get packed I want to see how good her choice was. Can…” Tony hesitated, “Can you help me with Steve’s room just now?” Peter nodded, grabbing some empty boxes and heading down the hallway. They started with the desk, nothing on much interested until they came to the bottom drawer, Peter reached in to grab an old army tin box as he pulled it up Tony called out gently, “Careful that stuffs from the 20’s,30’s and 40’s, it’s all Steve has left of his mother and father that isn’t behind a museum wall.” Peter gently handed the box over to Tony who wrapped it in a couple of t-shirts to protect it, “I promised him once when I was in charge of Stark Industries I would get his stuff back from the display at the Smithsonian, no matter the cost, he said don’t be ridiculous but I can see it hurts him a bit when his mother’s secret recipe book is on display.” Peter wanted to cry, he’d never seen anything from his Grandmother on his Pop’s side, but he could imagine that his Pop’s would have loved to try and make something out of it just to try it for his family to taste. “He’s just glad it’s not on display on the cookie recipe page, I think he would have broken in and stole it if they had.” Tony slightly chuckled at the thought.
“Anthony, stop all this, you’re not thinking straight, this was Howard’s world but don’t throw yourself into his ways. I’m worried about you, you are still in danger, you know there will be a huge price tag on your head after all this. I just want you to be safe.” Tony turned and threw the whisky glass against the far wall, watching it shattered and drop to the floor. “There has always been a price tag on my head, might as well give them a clear shot.” She might have guessed but Tony knew he was lying. He’s been searching, for months he’s had a small team of investigators looking. They’ve found nothing.
He opened his eyes again and looked towards her, giving her a thankful smile and nod. She smiled back. “Are you alright Peter?” Peter nodded, shoving his hand into the pockets of his jacket. “You didn’t sleep, did you?” Peter nodded again, he couldn’t tell her, he came to that conclusion at about three am last night. “I’m the same, nowadays, whenever Tony and Howard are under the same roof, it rarely ends well. Just too similar and completely the opposite.”
“Rhodey! Student Union in an hour! Bring friends!” Tony placed the phone back down and turned towards a very stressed looking Peter. His son was such a goodie two shoes. Seriously, no alcohol before 17! 17!? Like how has a member of the Stark family not had even a glass of wine at dinner ?! Jeez! It’s like Steve raised the kid, but even Steve drank! Peter was pacing in time with the clock tick, sounding his impending doom of going out with his dad.
“You need to tell me right now the name of your other parent.” Tony leaned against the opposite counter causally, crossing his arms as if he hadn’t asked a million-dollar question, well, Peter thought to himself, If anyone could afford it…
“On his way ma’am, though not by choice according to Agent Coulson, his butler is also joining him.” Peggy nodded in response, the scientist turned and rushed out the door back towards the lift. Peggy followed, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d truly spoken to Jarvis, he’d been her friend at one point in time, shame, she thought to herself, she’d let work get in the way again. Gosh she hopes Jarvis doesn’t faint when he sees this.
Tony turned around to Peter whose eyes were glassy with possible tears. Peter knew his dad had been lonely growing up, he hated Howard but to make it worse his mother was non-existent, she never knew where Tony was or what he was doing. Like now, they are moving flats in case his parents come visit but for Peter any length of time away from his parents was consider extremely strange.
“Peter, please try to reduce your heart rate now. You are suffering from a panic attack.” Peter could feel the room spinning, he gripped the bed sheets tightly between his fingers, squeezing his eyes closed. His senses were going crazy he could hear the Stark family in the kitchen, moving crystal drinks glasses, making their way down the hall to the living room, he could hear everyone’s footsteps as loud as elephants. He could hear everything, the simmering water of the soup, Ana and Jarvis’ shared whispers, the silence in the living room.
Peter and Tony’s Fort was considerably smaller. But it was freaking fun to build. By the end of the night the fort was slightly collapsing but they didn’t care that much, having Chinese takeaway while on the floor watching Star Wars on VHS. It was a pretty unique day.
“Pops what happened in Budapest?” Peter skimmed the now opened letter for its details, Peter knew all about most of his families’ adventures, his parent were honest with him, but they had never mentioned a Budapest mission taking place to him. The letter looked worn, it had been previously crumpled and smoothed out again. Tony turned to look out the window. Steve sighed. “That was my first mission back as the Captain, We had … a disagreement? It was a bad time for us…yeah…” he trialed off. Tony turned to look to Peter, with a fatherly half smile, Peter got the message, he placed he letter back in the box.
He stepped back quickly as the future shield flew rapidly back to his future self’s arm, his eyes widened in amazement,
“Oh, how strong you are! You really remind me of Tony’s polite friend, have you met Steve?” Peter was just caught off guard with the question, “Yeah I’ve met Steve, he’s helped me while I’ve been here. He’s super nice.” Ana gave his hand a squeeze, whispering closely in his ear. “You are a very lost soul right now Peter, do not worry.” He relaxed into her grip, the pair continued to work in silence, almost dancing around each other as they made the dinner.
“You are welcome, Peter, lets head back, I need to pack for our trip and Tony, I’m pretty sure, will be asleep on the couch, because I asked Jarvis not to give him anymore coffee,” the pair laughed and began to make their way back to the mansion.
They timed it well for the moving truck to have pulled up at the same time, as they walked up the stairs, boxes in hand, the landlord opened the front door of the apartment. Peter almost dropped his boxes on how big the flat was compared to Tony’s old one, but he couldn’t miss the fact that it was fucking freezing. “Pretty fucking cold dude?” Peter placed the box on the kitchen island.
Jarvis stepped forward, hesitantly, awkwardly shuffling till he settles with his arms open for a hug, expecting Peter to not accept the offer. Peter quick dived into Jarvis’ open arms, squeezing him tightly before quickly straightening up. “Thanks, uh. Let’s head down stairs?” He quickly made his way past Jarvis and down the marble white hallway, turning once he got the main staircase. Jarvis turned to follow, a little shocked.
Steve nodded, softening his expression to the kid, he came across too harsh. He’d apologise later. Peter watched as his Pop’s gently lifted his dad up to his feet, and slowly walked him outside to a bench in the park. Sitting him down before trying to get a better grip on Tony. Peter watched as Steve, used his hand to gently inspect Tony’s face, he had forgotten that they hadn’t see each other in at least 4 months, they weren’t even together at this point. Steve was so gentle with his hand, his face soft as he smirked at Tony’s sleeping face.
Can you pour this on top of the chicken!” Tony just leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms across his chest, he happily watched Ana guide Peter around her kitchen, well his mother’s but she’s only ever opened the wine fridge, he didn’t think she even knew how to work the cooker.
When Tony finally realised where he was, he immediately gripped the door frame to stop him entering the apartment. Rhodey walked into Tony’s back after opening the apartment door. “Tony come on its late, it’s time for bed.” He took a deep breath and stepped in. Rhodey watched, two steps behind him, cautiously as Tony made his way into his and Steve’s shared apartment. Steve’s leather jacket hung on the back of an old and battered red kitchen bar stool. Tony to the collar of the jacket in his hand, running his fingers along the seam.
“Director Carter, where is our son? You promised to take care of him, yet as far as I hear it, he’s in some shady motel?!” Tony shrugged in response, Peggy looked on, hiding her fear as best as she could. Her future Godson and his Husband were rather terrifying when they wanted to be. “Huh. A shrug little me?! Where the fuck is, he?” Tony looked ready to jump through the portal to attack himself, Steve grabbed Tony’s upper body to stop him. Steve turned to place Tony behind him, gripping his hand before turning back to Peggy and young Tony, “Let me make myself clear. Either you find Peter before we open this portal up again, Or I come through and get him myself. I don’t care who gets hurt while I get him home.” He flexed his back muscles and shoulders. “And Tony, Young Tony I mean. You’d regret putting the kid in harm’s way. So, do yourself a favour and find him.” Tony was taken aback by just how… sincere Steve was. He took a very small step back at the ‘almost disappointed in you’ face on Steve’s face.
Quickly walking over to the door, he leaned his back against the wall next to the heavy blast door. He closed his eyes and let his super soldier serum work its magic, he could hear the guard making his way down the hallway. The distinct sound of army books scrumming against the floor, finally turned the corner. Steve shoulder barged the door off of its hinges and let it clatter against the adjacent wall. Righting himself, after tripping slight, over his feet. He looked either way down the hall. Throwing his shield down the hall, allowing it to bounce twice before sweeping round the corner. Thunk!. One guard down, Steve thought to himself, time to get Clint, as he prepared his arm to receive the shield back.
! Multiple! Who needs more than one island!” Steve let out a chuckle, Natasha called through the small window between the truck and driver, “I wouldn’t say no, Stark jr still single right?” She gave a cheeky wink to Clint, who laughed, when she turned back to focus on the road, she gave herself a knowing look, watching Steve in the rear-view mirror.
Peggy took a single step back and turned. “Prepare my office. Do NOT allow young Master Stark to enter my office while Mr Stark is here.” One of the many scientists in the room scrambled for the phones on their desk to comply with the order.
“I’m working at a coffee shop to keep myself busy, I have Karen working in the background to run possible scenario solvers while I’m either running or at the flat. Tony’s invited me to Christmas at the Stark mansion which is cool.” Thor started off into the distance as he does when he leaves Peter for a moment to speak with someone who is with him. Peter wondered to himself, who was with his Uncle this time? “Peter, the Captain is with me in Asgard. He wishes you to know that he is very proud of your hard work at the coffee shop and misses you immensely. He also needs to confirm that the year is 1991?”
Peter woke up on auto pilot, he wrapped the duvet round his shoulders, his parent’s voices muffled through the walls. Peter could barely open his eyes, rubbing the tiredness out of them as he walked into the hall way. Peter yawned stumbling down the hallway to his parents. Peter heard the voices raise as he got closer.
Peter took the ball from the claw and noticed the far wall was covered in circular green rub marks from where the tennis ball had been repeatedly thrown at the wall at least a thousand times. Peter gave the ball a good overarm throw across the lab to the wall and watched as DUM-EE raced towards it. Peter was impressed until he realized that DUM-EE wasn’t slowing down as he was heading towards the wall. Tony called out “DUM-EE not the…” DUM-EE slammed into the work bench sending wrenches and papers flying across the floor. “Workbench…” Tony sighed rubbing the side of his head. Peter let out a joyous laugh at the sight. Tony turned to Peter as he was watching DUM-EE attempt to pick up his mess with his claw. “So, he’s still working in the future?” Peter continued to watch the cleanup with a wide grin on his face. “He’s your favourite lab assistant before I came around, that is.” Tony gave a gentle smile at the thought, looking down to his shoes. “Come on!” Peter called out, “Let’s go help him!” They stayed with DUM-EE till it got dark outside, the robot notably became sad when they had to leave. “Don’t worry buddy, Rhodey will be with you tomorrow and then me the day after that, Ok?” DUM-EE seemed pleased enough that Tony wouldn’t be gone for long. “And what do you do if you get stuck on anything?” DUM-EE Wheeled itself towards a large red button on the wall and used it’s claw to point at it. “Good boy!” Tony shut the door behind them and locked it again. As they walked back to the apartment during the cold night, Tony turned to Peter as they walked, “I’m glad you know him, he was my first real success and to know I built him well enough that he could last… well, I’m just glad you’re here Peter. As Tony unlocked the door to the apartment, they both walked in and head towards the kitchen to grab some food when they heard something drop from Steve’s room. Peter ran towards the room with his faster speed, but all he found was a glass of water from earlier smashed on the floor by the now opened window.
He exaggerated his look down to his watch, “10:30, Your Father had you up and at it by 7am each morning, you need to get him up and working!” Tony stood with his arms crossed, silent and frowning at Stane. “I kid, I kid Anthony, and thank you for your designs on the new missile system. Our army is now the most effective in the world!” Peter frowned at Stane, he knew his father was in the weapons business when he was really young, but the image of clean energy was what he grew up with, so he couldn’t help but screw up his nose at the whole situation.
Tony was born from wealth, not class. He knew that, he could spend money like nobody’s business but not quite on the class stuff, like this dinner. Hammer insisted he pay even though it was practically a joke in poor taste, maybe two, three hundred dollars for them to have dinner, the last time he spent that on dinner, Tony took the engineering year and professors out for dinner and a couple of drinks at the end of last year. Different ways to spend a couple of hundred dollars change in your pocket. “But yeah, sure why not, that’s why we hire nannies and staffers anyway, so you don’t have to see the brats.” That’s when Hammer was pretty much a write off for Tony. But was that just the persona talking?
Tony was trembling as he held on to Steve’s shoulder, his hands covered in the crimson blood. He looked up to Peter, Steve was gripping the side of his arm, clearly grazed by the bullet as he moved Tony out of the way. “Peter call the police.” Steve asked as he took a breath through his teeth. Peter’s eyes widen in sight of the blood. He turned and bolted after the shooter. Diving out the window to the next roof top.
“Hey, I think these will fit you for now, if you need anything just let me know cause I’m not a heavy sleeper so don’t worry about a kick or two. Night Peter.” Tony turned to leave waved goodnight. Peter yawned stretching out his muscles again.
Peter’s smiled stay on his face as he introduced himself, “Peter, uh friend of Tony Stark, happy to help with anything?” Peter’s confusion at his own statement made Edwin give a small laugh, Tony stood next to Jarvis, “J, he’s a cool kid, he doesn’t want the ‘Stark’ Welcome!” Edwin raised his eyebrows at Tony with a small understanding ‘oh!’ on his face. Jarvis walked up to Peter and took him in a tight hug, “Well welcome Peter, I hope you enjoy your stay with us.” Peter gripped the back of Jarvis jacket tightly. Tony leaned against the stained glass on the front doors, happy at the sight in front of him. Jarvis wasn’t a young man in anyway and Tony never thought he would have kids, so to see his… parental figure, meeting his son. It almost brought a tear to his eye, he was now determined more than ever to tell Jarvis who Peter was.
“Did I say adult, I meant my precious baby boy. Who should start getting his stuff together again we are heading home and going do some repairs to the lab.” Peggy started to laugh at Tony backtrack. “Peter, better run upstairs and do what your father tells you, you can come back to the mansion anytime you like, even to get away from your extremely loud fathers.” Pops turned a deep shade of pink as Peter grabbed an apple and walked out of the kitchen through the East hallway through to the main stairs. He could still hear his parents apologizing to Aunt Peggy as he walked in to the room he had stayed in and opened up the white wicker cupboard door. His Dad still had a small fortunes worth of clothes In this cupboard but far from his usual suits. Peter decided to rummage through and see if he could grab any “vintage” style tees from his Dad’s collection. Post-It notes still stuck to the back of the double doors gave Peter a view into his Dad’s last days in the mansion, blueprints of the Malibu mansion expansion plans with red marker alterations from before his Dad moved out there and a drawing, that had clearly been done by his Pops of his Dad reading a book of some kind. The paper was worn at the edges seemed a spur of the moment type thing rather than on proper sketching paper. Peter stole one of his Dad’s old duffle bags and shoved a bunch of tees in the bag along with one of Pop’s old sports jerseys with his name on it.
Tony received the last kiss on the cheek from his mother as she made her way towards Jarvis who was standing in the hallway. Peter watched Tony, as he barely looked his father in the eye. Peter walked quickly over to Tony, who was leaning on the wall. “Please, say something to him,” Tony turned his head towards Peter with clenched eyes. “Please, I haven’t seen my parents in months, you never want the last things you say to be nothing.” Peter was trying to keep his heart rate under control.
“Uh well, we don’t know for sure but at my best guess, I could say it would be unlikely, the offspring would likely not see the effects of the super serum. They would be more likely in my best guest to suffer from everything else you had before the serum took hold, vitamin deficiencies and so on. Can I ask why.” Steve didn’t need Natasha to tell him her train of thought. He knew. He had made his own theories too, but she wants to get to the bottom of the kid’s story, and she’ll get the information she needs so that she can eliminate possible answers.
Steve sat up straight at the bar, “What options Howard? Aren’t you supposed to be heading home for Christmas break about now?” Howard walked around to the same side as Steve, rolling his eyes, leaning on his elbow crossing his legs over to balance at an angle. “This assassin, Peggy’s got you chasing, he’s going to try and kill me, hence me hiding out here.” Howard causally gestured to the building around him. “But I need you by my side in case something happens, you’re my best guy. ” He gave Howard his best, ‘I’m not impressed face.’ “Come on Steve, You’re the one guy I can trust in this whole thing. Leave Barton to find the guy and stay as personal security!” Steve stood up, he considered just leaving at Howard stupid request.
Tony was already in the back seat of the Shield SUV, leaning out the passenger side door as the car was moving, still holding on to the hand grip on the door. Steve was the first to jump in after Tony, forcefully pushing him back into his seat, Steve turned to throw his hand out to help Peter jump in. Peter fell into the leather seat across from the other two, who were giggling to each other, “Tony can you do me a favour and not put your life in danger?” using his arm across Tony’s body as a gentle deterrent for leaning out a car door again.
Tony and Peter arrived back at the flat, they slowly opened the door with the key Steve gave them before the left, It was weird to be in someone else home without them, his parents still own this place, he knows that much, just more private between them, private to their relationship as husbands rather than the family space. Tony sat quietly down on to the couch, he sat staring straight ahead. Peter shrugged off his jacket, he jumped up on the kitchen counter, gently swinging his legs back and forth, his heels clunking on the cabinet door every once and a while.
Tony unlocked the battered front door as they headed inside, dumping the carrier bags with the ice cream on the kitchen table. Steve was laughing at Tony’s silly joke when he caught something out the corner of his eye. It was just a flash but certainly enough for Steve to turn and question what he saw. Peter’s spider sense went nuts the moment Steve began to turn. He still hadn’t gotten full control over the sensation of the spider sense, but he knew enough to turn and see if something was down the dark hallway. “What? Is it…” Tony asked but it was too late.
Clint pulled the truck into the underground car parking space.
Steve had sat up and gave Natasha a quick nod as he got up to follow Peter through to his room. Making his way into the room, he stood behind Peter, looking over his shoulder. The suit lay flat out over the duvet, the sleeves had a few notable tears, slashes across the fabric in various places, some still covered in flecks of bloody. The mask sat at the top, noticeably discoloured from the rest of the suit, the dust had settled in the corners of the eye pieces. The black outline of the goggles had began to flake off small chips of plastic. Steve felt a sharp pain in his heart, the fear of seeing the suit in the state that it was currently in. His mouth fell open ever so slightly, tears formed in his eyes.
“Peter’s back?” He tightened his grip on Tony’s hand. “Right well, time to go apologise.” Steve frowned at Tony, “Apologise?”
Fury scoffed adjusting his jacket, “How do you even know the Captain America’s clearance? Stark, you must know that just because your father was a Director, that it doesn’t give you access to everything Shield does.” Crossing his arms, Fury stood by Peggy, watching Tony with his good eye. “Captain America, may be America’s pride but Steve likes to drop his suit’s laundry on the floor like a hellish flatmate when he get’s back from a mission, his clearance pass likes to lie around the floor of the flat until he needs it again.”Tony turned to walk down the hall toward’s his guest office/bed room, when he stopped short of the hallway door. He gripped the handle tightly before letting it go. “Also it’s Captain Rogers or Steve. Don’t confuse your pride and joy of human perfection with the soldier from Brooklyn.” Tony turned to leave once more. Pushing open the door he stopped as Fury called out to him, his voice echoing down the hall.
birthday with the jelly in your hair and an old photo booth photo of us on our 15
Tony laughed again, then he took a more serious tone, “Peter, I like to think of myself as a futurist, I try and create the ‘new tomorrow’ by building bigger and better things, I like to predict where technology is going to go, but also my own life.” Tony reshuffled himself on the couch, looking towards his feet nervously, “I now know what is going to happen in my life, if this was the way it was supposed to go, you’ve shown me technology I thought wasn’t possible in my lifetime and to say I AM.” Tony points to himself.
“He’s my best friend too.” And that was all it took for his Pops and Steve to collide in a hug. If it wasn’t for his enhanced hearing, he’d have missed Steve’s whisper, “he was mine first” his Pops just laughed.
Tony kept it, not like he was struggling for money anyway and honestly forgot about it for the decade, until Steve had one particularly tough
Poor kid, maybe it would be good for Tony to have someone like him around. His train of thought was interrupted by the kid. “Are you staying?” Peter sounded hopeful. Steve hadn’t thought about it fully, he knew he wanted to see Tony, but this was mission recovery only back for 3 days at best and then he would be sent out again.
briefcase handle. The slightly too wide suit sat just off of Tony’s shoulders, shrinking his frame, his youthful features in an old man’s office. He looked so innocent, his boyish charms contrasting with the wood and crystal decor of his father’s office.
“Steve. Before for you go to Howard…” Peggy rested her hand on Steve’s in the middle of the car. “About what happened at the compound with Peter.” Steve stopped with his hand on the door released. “What about it?” Peggy looked around Steve’s face for answers. “He…” Steve reshuffled himself to face Peggy but didn’t release his grip of the door handle. “He’s Tony’s son, Peggy I know this.” Peggy let a gentle smile grace her face, “Never mind, you never were quick off the draw with people.” Steve furrowed his brow, confusion written all over his face, a little bit insulted if he was honest with himself, Peggy gestured towards the door. “Go Captain, Director Stark is waiting.” Steve nodded and proceeded to climb out the car. Making his way to the warehouse doors.
but Peter had spent his winter break locked in his bathroom, in his make shift red-room for disassembling each piece individually and rebuilding it. The frames scattered across the wall, the photos showed Peter’s story of fixing the camera, some were rescued photos from the camera’s last use, random hills and mountains from Steve’s many missions in Germany.
Peter had given it two hours and an extra 150 people in the hall before his stress level increases and he became desperate to go home. He wants his Dads to come gets him and take him home, make him dinner and sit on the couch, watching a film as family. Tony had 9 beers in this time. You’d think he’d been stranded without water with how fast he downed the beers.
“When my dad said he wanted a kid, he was going to have a kid. Even if it meant becoming a genetics expert of the course of a year until he was successful with my Pops and had me.” Peter explained to his Aunt Peggy. “Peter James Stark. Kid born and raised in New York to two of the coolest parents in the world, because they defied science just to get me. So yeah. I’m going to be his son.” Peter pointed at Tony who was grinning ear to ear at Peter’s story.
“I’m guessing you aren’t freaking out about the suit and the powers because Tony has told you?” Steve looked at Peter face with curious eyes. “Sort off, most roommates don’t have war propaganda with their face on it. I have a weird family anyway, it isn’t a bit deal for me… can I see it?” Steve furrowed his eyebrows until he quickly understood what Peter was referring to. “Give me 5 mins, I need to go collect my stuff from the Shield van outside, then I’ll give you a go at it kid.” Steve turned towards the door and as he was heading out, he heard Peter call from up the stairs, “Can you tell Un…Agent Barton to leave or take a break, nothing is happening up here, Tony’s not making a bomb or anything.” Steve was racking his brain as he headed down the stairs as to how Peter knew Barton.
Steve found himself sitting on the floor in his mother’s flat, the day after he had finally held her funeral. Finding himself lost, not sure what to do with his life, he now had bills to pay by himself and his art wasn’t going to cover it anymore. Bucky had found him, dressed up in his Sunday best surrounded by newspaper job listings, all circled in red for various labour intensive jobs, the failed interviews crossed out. Bucky shook his head, inspecting the papers, he nudged Steve awake with his foot. Helping him up off the floor he took his friend through to his room, putting him to bed. Steve woke to his mother’s hand knitted blanket over his body and two papers circled with newspaper’s graphic artist and enlistment for the army.
It took 8-year-old Peter and his parents all day to build but this fort took up the entire kitchen and living room of the Stark Tower. Steve was surprisingly hand when it came to building forts and loved to spend the time watching as Peter worked out the complex physics of stress and balance to build a balcony on the fort. Steve and Peter decorated the insides with rooms and doors, colour coordinating each corridor, and creating a dining table out of cardboard boxes. Steve eventually carried through his and Tony’s super king mattress and placed it directly in front of the TV. By the end of the night the Stark family fort had been invaded by his Aunts and Uncles with peace offering Pizza.
Tony smiled back at his assistant, fixing his tie and adjusting his sunglasses as he made his way down the hallway to his father’s old office. Taking in a shaky breath in the silence of the corridor. He clenched his fist, the corridor seemed to tighten in on him, he stopped dead in his tracks when a blonde man walked across his path in the hallway. Not Steve, he thought to himself, Steve would have stopped, looked at him, maybe even smiled. Or. maybe he would have ignored him, Steve was decent at giving him the silent treatment until he apologised but Tony furrowed his brow at the thought. If anyone had to apologise this time, it was Steve, his father was murdered. Steve’s best friend’s dad was murdered, or maybe it was just Steve’s best friend.
Peter wanted to cry again, but he’d ran out of tears weeks ago, “Thanks Karen. Need to be reminded of that every once and a while. Peter James Rogers was printed on his birth certificate, for all those concerned he was a Stark, publicly, legally and to everyone’s general knowledge. But his dad had taken his Pops name, few knew that, Peter didn’t even know that until he’d been told he was ten. His Dad wanted him away from the Stark name, only if he wanted it, could he take it. Publicly they were the Stark-Rogers. Really, they were just the Rogers family. Steve, Tony and Peter Rogers. He missed it.
“Yes Director.”
“Sorry, for yelling at you Steve, it’s not you I’m angry at, I shouldn’t have yelled.” Peter watched Tony turn his head to the side of the vent, not able to watch his father pander to Steve. “I know you feel like you have to take care of the kid and be like a brother to him, but you really don’t need to waste your time with him Steve, we’ve got bigger fish to fry here! If you want company on your days off then just come round to the Stark estates, I can get you any girl you want!”
“Ok.” Steve raised his eyebrow,’ah’ Steve thought to himself, Tony warned him about this. “…You don’t believe me, do you?”
that he always associated with him. His arm reached wildly round the inside of the family hug to find connection with his Pops. Peter could only cry tears of joy in his family’s arms. Tony’s grin hurt his face, finally seeing his young boy after months apart.
Natasha frowned when she threw herself into Tony’s chair, “and that is an excuse, How exactly?” Leaning back and crossing her legs on his desk. Tony half sat on the edge of Howard’s desk. He needed to start calling it, his desk, Howard wasn’t coming back for it now. “What does this change? Howard and my mom are dead and I’m here doing my job. You don’t need to be here, awesome, thanks for telling me my information is bullshit, go do spy things or whatever. Just leave me alone.” Natasha didn’t move a muscle. Tony just sighed. “Why are you here?” He took another large drink of his glass. Finishing the contents off, he made his way over to pour another drink.
“Of course Peter. I’ll buzz to let you know when it is done.” The hologram stopped. Peter turned back to Tony. “Guess I can help pack!” He grabbed some boxes and packed up more stuff from the kitchen.
As the pair separated Steve began to kneel to collect the shield, Maria made her way toward their bedroom for the night, Steve knew Maria hadn’t truly meant for him to hear her, but his enhanced hearing didn’t allow people to be as private as they thought they could be with him, Maria was whispering to herself. “He’s a good soul, he’s just right for Tony.”
“Same day we last spoke, Uncle? You figured out what is happening yet?” Thor let out a sigh of relief, he sat himself cross legged on the floor, his cape missing replaced with an avengers hoodie. Peter thought to himself, as he moved to sit on the floor in front of his Uncle, crossing his legs as well, this could be the only contact he has with home for the rest of his life? He might never see his parents again, he’d eventually need to leave Tony and Steve alone so that he could be born, for the loop to cycle round again. Nope. Not going down that way again.
They patted each other on the back at the same time, stepping away, Tony turned to Peter and gestured towards the car, Peter and Tony bumped shoulders as they walked away in silence. Steve jogged to catch up with Barton and Romanoff, Captain America time, well, a little selfish act, so he could save his friend but if this was an international assassin that they could take down then, even better In his opinion, by the time he reached the two spies, Barton was already tucking into his second burger if the look on Romanoff’s face was to go by.
son. His family, even himself, he marries Tony and they have a kid and-
“Dude, ouch! You alright kid?” the stranger asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope, not going to say, sorry.” Peter answered confidently “Worth a shot.” Tony took the final bite of his sandwich. “Let’s head back and we will stop and get you the basics and shit on the way.” Tony made a move to stand up, when a glint on the roof caught Peter’s eye, he turned slowly, trying to get a head look at what it was that was causing the glint. He tried to play it nonchalant, placing sunglasses on his face and turning his head around the sky line, playing it like a tourist, his eyes landed on the rooftop, the glint was caused by a cross hair sight on a familiar bow, that was not drawn back, but was definitely pointing the sights towards him. It was Uncle Clint but he looked… grumpy. Peter continued his sweep of the skyline and turned back to Tony with a smile, shoving his hands in his pocket. “Lead the way!” he said to Tony as the headed out the courtyard to any and all clothes store. All Peter could think about was why his Uncle Clint was here, looking at him, maybe shield knew he had time travelled back, they were always watching his dads, in his time so he shouldn’t surprise him they knew something about him being here now. But Peter trusted his younger dad more than he would shield.  He kept their heads down, played it cool. Uncle Clint wasn’t aiming at him just reconnaissance on him. This …could be fun. Peter gently but quickly pushed Tony’s direction down a different alley and he turned them up and down multiple ones till he was sure he’d lost his Uncle. That was going to piss him off for a little bit. It was almost too easy.
Their truck stopped in the middle of the trail, no one around for miles. Natasha jumped out the truck, Steve and Clint dropped down off the roof. The trio walked round to the back to open up the doors. They found papers. Everywhere. Filing cabinets destroyed in the chase or bullets. “Well. Stark likes to hide himself in plain sight, so whatever the solider was looking for. It’s in here. Start looking. Romanov drive back to the nearest town. Barton and I will start looking while you drive.” The other two nodded, Steve and Barton jumped in the back. Steve pulled the doors shut again.
“Peter what is the date for you?” Thor came back to this body. “29
The Shooter was ahead of Peter and was running extremely fast, faster than the average human but Peter was just slightly faster, He would catch him in seconds at this pace. What Peter didn’t expect was to get within metres of the shooter, for him to stop and turn to punch Peter in the chest. Peter ducked under and slid on the gravel under the shooter. Peter armed the web shot with a tracking dot. Aiming at the shooter’s back to place the shot, the shooter turned with his arm out stretched to catch the web shot between his fingers.
“It was always going to be this way,” Tony muttered to himself before taking a large swig of his drink, he stood staring out at the gardens. He rolled his shoulders. He let his mind wander for the first time in days. He regretted it immediately. The phone rang once again, Tony dropped his shoulder throwing his head back to look up at the ceiling. Turning around he grabbed the phone once more. “Stark.” He pulled the cable so that he could stand and look out the window again.
Tony shrugged his shoulders and motioned for Peter to get started with one of the boxes. Peter slid down off the couch to sit on the carpeted floor leaning against his Pop’s leg. He reached over to grab one of the dustier looking boxes with the assumption that it looked the oldest. As he removed the lid he saw literally hundreds of photos stacked on top of each other. The first however, was a large collection of photos stapled together with frayed edges that were stamped with a red confidential in the corner. The photos were of his Pop when he first woke up out of the ice, frost still on the tips of his hair. He felt his Pops shiver subconsciously. Peter placed the collection down to the side and grabbed the next one, a student card for his Pops from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Peter studied the photo, a younger Steve, the super solider serum limiting the effects of his aging, he had less laughter lines by his eye but the same hair style, that seems to be a constant of his Pops. Tony let out a laugh as he took the card from Peter. Where he handed it to his Dad sending a quizzical look to his Pops, who shook his head.
Peter crossed his arms over his body, trying to turn invisible, to hide from the judging and calculating stares of hundreds of scientists. His Dad allows his scientific development team on site but that was a team of 12, who are friendly and kind individuals working with the Avengers. Not hundreds of unknown strangers in his home, or what would be his home, None of them looked like Maureen, she baked the best cookies, always made extra for Peter and Steve.
Tony and Jarvis were silent as they made their way back into the kitchen area, the pair kicked their walking boots free of the mud and frost at the floor brush just outside the door. The pair shared a very private but honest moment, Tony’s smile of respect and Jarvis’ of pride. The pair walked in and Jarvis couldn’t help but stare at Peter, watching him interact with his with Ana, laughing at their mess and silly jokes. He let a couple of tears loose from his eyes. Tony wrapped his arms and upper body over Peter’s shoulders laughing at each other with ease.
“I’m Peter, I … am I awake, this isn’t real, I can’t believe this.” Peter stared wide eye directly into Tony’s. Tony held a soft smirk, he sat with his leg bend with the other crossed over on top, there was something familiar about this kid.
The closest thing Peter had to his grandparents on his Pop’s side was his wrist watch, the strap was new but the watch itself was his grandfather’s past down from his Pops to him. He never really expected his Pops to own and use a pocket watch, but Peter knew they had been poor, so this watch must have been a big deal to have at the time. He’d need to ask about it more once he was back home. Because he was going to get back home. Peter looked up to Tony, Peter must have been staring at the watch for some time, Tony had already packed his duffle bag and dropped it by the door. Only to re-enter with Peter’s, all packed and ready to go.

Peter was startled when Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed, whispering so faintly he knew the others could not here, “I don’t know who you are kid, but I know what being look at like a Guinea Pig in a laboratory is not a good feeling.” Peter lifted his head high and turned it to face Steve, who gave him a saddened smile. He knew it well, It was the ‘not everything is good in the world kid’ smile. Fury led the trio down the clinical hallway to a door labelled Observation lounge, a haphazardly written sign tapped over it. ‘Observation of anomaly, level 8 clearance.’ Coulson opened the door for Fury and the trio to walk in.
date?” Tony stared off at the wall, “It’s not what I want in a partner anyway, why pretend? “Peter shrugged in agreement.
“Hey, thanks Steve, I needed that…” Peter’s stood firm now, more confident as he made his way up the first two steps. “By the way, Steve Roger can be jealous?” Peter chuckled. Steve shook his head while laughing, “Thanks for saying Steve and not Captain America kiddo.”
“Peter get behind me.” His
Instead of a peaceful morning inside, Jarvis stood in the kitchen, worry was painted all over his face and he stared to the ground. Ana held a tea towel up to her ears, so she didn’t need to hear the yelling from Howard and Tony. Maria looked between the two, a stern look on her face now. Peter walked carefully round to stand between Ana and the yelling, the loud noises piercing his control over his senses. “Ana what’s happened?” Maria asked forcefully, she knew if she was going to stop this, she needed to know why it happened.
“I don’t know what I’m allowed to tell you, to be honest, I’m terrified I’ve already fucked up my own timeline by just being here at this point… but no he’s not. He’s pretty cool.” Peter walked around to where Tony was preparing the Pasta dish. Automatically Peter began to help prepare the dinner. Tony just watch in awe that his son was able to prepare the dish as well as he could. Maybe, Jarvis was still about and that’s why the kid isn’t as fucked up as he is. Millionaire’s playboy son, has a son that isn’t as ruined as he is. Peter is pretty normal in Tony’s eyes, he hasn’t rolled his eyes at the quality of the flat or old couch, maybe he blows the family fortune, maybe the Stark name doesn’t mean anything anymore. Maybe Peter just grew up as a normal person, limited money, simple house, god what if they were still in this flat, though, Peter didn’t seem to know this place though. That was a weight off of Tony’s mind. Then it hit him.
Tony stood on a chair balancing as he was trying reach for some pasta at the back of the top cupboard, usually when Steve was here he could reach it but with both him and now son … vertically challenged, a chair would have to do. The phone rang as Tony was rummaging through the cupboards.
“Either this ends well, and I strike 4 lines of murders off my ledger, that Shield are currently in possession of or in the worst case, I will be sent to prison in some backdoor and murdered by some inside guard or inmate.” Clint couldn’t make eye contact with her, she knew he had fought hard for to even have a benefit to doing this, 4 lines wasn’t much but she would take it, he wasn’t able to convince Shield of anything other than her murder though, so it drew a heavy line for her not to cross.
Romanoff scoffed. “Sentimental Barton? Pathetic. You didn’t ask me here to save the moronic kid who decided chasing an assassin was a good idea.” Peter looked up to the women who was a much younger Aunty Tasha, sporting the familiar red hair, leather jacket and black combat boots. “Technically,” Barton said while helping clear Peter’s hands of gravel burns and the dust, “We didn’t ask. We made it clear that we are in charge of the ledger. Besides, Roger’s saved your life back there in Budapest.”
Steve lost track of his thoughts again, as they crossed the state border. He had enough time to think through that if Shield wouldn’t let him go, then he would hide from them. He was determined to visit Edwin Jarvis properly and apologise for not being there for Tony, failing his job at protecting him. He could at least tell him the truth about how he felt. Jarvis was always Tony’s father figure, they used to joke that Tony’s actual name was Tony Jarvis and that would always make Edwin blush. Tony never quite laughed at that. Steve was pretty sure that Tony had wished that was true, that he wasn’t the billionaire’s son but the butlers. He’d considered, while staring over the mountains a couple miles back that he wanted to change his name.
“Peter!?” Tony called out “Steve have you found Peter?” Peter turned to face Steve as he pushed off of the wall, he looked up the gap between the U-turn stairs, “Yeah, just needed some fresh air, we’re fine down here, Tony maybe some more Ice cream is needed, this time with Churros?” Peter perked up at the mention of churros and ice cream, “Churros?”
“Steve, it’s no question that he’s after Stark.” The articles were surrounded with surveillance photos of Stark Industries buildings, Tony on MIT campus and the Stark family mansion. “But why?”
“Peter, the door, Mr Stane Is coming.” Peter threw the blanket on the floor over the suit on the bed. He grabbed his jumper and threw it over the mask. He threw himself over on to the bed. Just as the door opened, Stane stepped through before Tony could get in his way, “—Tony, he’s young but he can’t sleep in until what’s the time?”
“Fashion is very different in the future. Just yeah that’s an embarrassing jumper to me.” Tony harrumphed. “Well its fashion forward now Kid. I look great, come one lets go.” Peter was still laughing on the way out the door.
“I’m trying really hard not to throw you out that window in this moment.” Peter turned to Peggy, “What did you want to ask me then.” Peggy gave a sympathy look to her godson. “We took the sample from Tony without his knowledge but yes, Your DNA was fascinating according to our science department,” Peggy lifted a clip board and check the file underneath the first page. “You’re DNA flagged the parental match to both your parents, Tony and …” Tony lifted his head to stare directly at Peggy, who assessed the situation and with a quick look at Peter’s slowly shaking head… “and other parent. Which should genetically be impossible.” Tony let out a disappointed breath.

The Carrier jet landed roughly, hitting the runway in the dead of night. Steve looked down to his watch, his father’s military wrist watch, it was 2am. He’d be in front of Howard again in 10-15 minutes. He leant his head back against the carrier’s wall. He felt the vibrations through wall into his head. Every bump in the tarmac sent directly to his head. He chanted the mantra in his head, ‘he could do this, Howard would only waste 10 minutes of his time.’ Steve refused to give Howard much more of time since he was defrosted, meeting Tony had opened his eyes to how little Howard had appreciated his friendship. Howard idolised him, he knew that much, it was clear when he first met T, that Howard had not stayed true to his goals.
“Dinner is Served!” Ana called from down the hall. Maria ran her hands through his hair one more time, before Tony made a motion to get up, Peter watched as Tony held his hand out to help his mother up out of her chair, she stood up, took off her suit jacket and laid it down at the back of the chair.
Steve grips on to Peter just a little tighter, wrapping him further into his body.
Steve had found out pretty quickly that Peter just wanted held at three in the morning, his tiny son would curl into his shoulder as he bounced gently from his knees around the light blue nursery. Peter would cry until he fell asleep and once he was out, Steve liked to sit in the dark black whicker rocking chair. Just taking a moment for himself in the dead of night.
When they arrived in the front court yard, Natasha was sitting on a bench near the car. The flashing lights of the ambulance lit up the courtyard as Barton and Peter approached the back of it. Steve was sitting on the metal steps of the ambulance as the medic attended to his shoulder. Tony was curled up next to him on the other side. His knees tucked up to his chest, watching the stitches go into Steve’s arm.
Steve pulled the Velcro of the suit around his neck, just a little tighter to stop the breeze. Adjusting his shoulders, he sat between Clint and Natasha, checking his watch, it was only 11pm. “So, the meeting with your buddy in military architecture had to be at 2am?” Steve gave a smirked smile as he shovelled some noodles into his mouth, man food was so much better nowadays.
