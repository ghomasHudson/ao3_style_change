“You weren't able to hear them properly yesterday. We've been learning more complex melodies recently and I think you might enjoy them.”
“They’re lovely Pep. I’m sure the girls will be touched.” Tony assured her, leaning over to elbow Péter pointedly in the side.
Bucky lost Steve’s trail at the edge of Tennenlohe forest and spent several days searching the surrounding farmland for signs of him while dodging search parties.  Stefen’s delayed execution and the possible reasons for it was the talk of country, even out here in the farming towns. SS men were traveling from door to door in the village, reminding folks that vagrancy was illegal under the Third Reich and that anyone caught helping vagrants would be dealt with under the harshest penalties.
“You want me, to be some sort of… governess?!” He asked incredulously and Nik scowled at him. It was official. Niklas Farkas had lost whatever good sense he was born with. He wanted to place this man’s poor children in
He shouldn’t have had the strength but somehow, knowing that Stefen had found it just to fight
“I could play in my grave Charlotte. This won’t be a problem.” He took another swallow from his cup, just to take the edge off. She sighed, her mouth pinching a little at the corner.
As he spoke Tony ushered the children toward the table, gesturing toward his empty chair and frowning momentarily at the obvious predicament before turning toward Virginia in the doorway and saying, "Pepper, be a dear and bring us some extra place settings won't you?"
He rubbed his face, pulling at his skin, the prickle of stubble rubbing his cold skin raw.
Your little friend seems very jealous," he whispered conspiratorially in her ear. Natacha grinned secretively at him as she spun in a circle, her skirts fanning out around her like the feathers of an exotic bird.
The question, impertinent as it was, was certainly valid Dvorak realized, the woman's words stirring up the room and kicking his thoughts into high gear.
"If Tony gets taken too,” his voice sounded rough so he cleared it before going on. “Then we'll have to take the chance. We can't let them separate us, Tacha. Da would want us to stay together."
It was dizzying trying to keep up with the boy’s chatter. Steve caught himself wishing that Bucky had come home with him. It had always been easier to arrange his thoughts against Bucky’s stubborn opposition, even when his advice stung. Sometimes especially then.
Ian's faced colored but he sat up straighter and snapped.
Khalmmer’s expression hardly changed before he was slapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder once more and dared to keep it there. Why did he keep touching him? Steve wondered, his back going stiff. Khalmmer glanced over his shoulder and into the crowd for a moment before he turned and fixed Steve with an unreadable expression.
“Is he alive?” Ona asked, timidly peering around Magda to get a good look at the man.
“Of course it don’t. Careful, Chava, you might hit something.” Bakhuizen teased the boy, dropping a few extra tin cans next to Tony and Ian.
Hours later, when he made it back upstairs he found the men curled into their bags on the floor asleep. Steve gave the apartment several sweeps but eventually settled on the fact that his sketch was missing. A strange feeling of panic swelled up inside him until a throat, softly cleared and he realized that not all the men were asleep. Bucky was awake and curled up on the spot beside the window that had somehow become theirs. He was watching Steve, the glow from his cigarette illuminating his face in the darkness and Steve held his gaze. For the first time, Steve thought that the look in Bucky’s eyes resembled one of pity.
“And doesn’t the Book say, ‘when a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt’?” Nonno added. The tension in the room began to ease as the rest of Tony’s family began to smile and nod their agreement. Ian smiled back at Tony’s uncle and resumed eating. Steve could not let himself relax, his focus returning to the danger at hand. Antonia thankfully was thinking along the same lines, musing, “There have been roundups on the peninsula, but none here. Why now?”
"Where is he? We have to tell them to stop. It's too risky now. We’ll find a better way. He has to see that. Tell me where he is and-"
Bucky couldn’t be here with him in the synagogue, chewing on toast. And yet his eyebrows cocked up at Steve in challenge, the grin splitting his mouth irreverent as if to say Steve was too crazy to know whether he was crazy or not, and they both knew it. It made a small smile tug at Steve’s mouth. Bucky was usually right about these things.
“And what brings you back to my doorstep after so long?”
“I don’t want you! Why can’t Ian help?” he bemoaned, rolling away from Tony’s hands and moaning like someone deeply aggrieved, gulping deeply through snotty tears.
“When Tony took us to town we saw these boys beating an old man.”
"I'm making you a new pair of socks."
“You know I envy you men. How wonderful it must be to act on what you feel and say the things you think without a second thought.”
He could be brave like Da he told himself. He could. He would.
Tony scoffed – because he doubted peeling potatoes was going to be any great cure for boredom – but reached inside the bucket for one of the slick little spuds anyway.
Twelve. Maybe thirteen.
Frauline Werner never said her Father’s name. She didn’t even say his title. He was just her ‘father’. She said it with sympathy, like it was something Natacha might be embarrassed by.
“You shouldn’t be alone.” He repeated, coming closer, wanting to touch him, make sure he was real. He didn’t do much more than shift but Tony shot him a look, so raw with pain, that, Steve paused again. Alright, slower.
Additionally this chapter touches on the romantic feelings of a minor towards an adult. This is where the Bucky/Natasha tag starts coming into play. I understand that this may be a triggering subject or a squick for some.That's absolutely fine. But so there is no confusion from the start, I want to state it plainly. Here in this stage of her life, Natasha feels how she feels about Bucky. Bucky has no romantic interest in children, nor would he entertain an advance if she were brave enough to make one. This is not that kink or that fic. He's MIA so he doesn't have to adress Natasha's feelings. Tony chooses to treat them as if they are valid and natural because they are. :) I wanted him and the story to allow her to be a whole person with all the complexity that requires. I hope I succeeded.
“Gone to visit her sister I hear,” a slurred voice answered from behind Tony and he grit his teeth in irritation. Hammer was standing in the serving doorway between the dining room and the kitchen hallway, a bottle of the house larger sloshing loudly as he raised it to his lips with a sneer.
Péter had wanted to ask if Hammer thought he should line the road with brick or if he should just lay his body down in the dirt to save the cost of materials, but he wasn't stupid.
“Don’t fret Antony,” Nonno consoled, squeezing Tony’s shoulder with one wrinkled hand. “I will come back tomorrow without you and try again.”
~*~*~*~
Bucky had said, knocking back the last of his beer,
He was yanked from the dream at the sound of a thump. Eyes fixed on the ceiling, Steve struggled to calm his breathing as his eyes darted around the room.
Niklas Farkas had come to dread those words, spoken in that specific tone, and not without good reason.  They always meant trouble, spelled with a capital T-O-N-Y, and frankly what with Austria under Nazi control and a war approaching he had much bigger things to deal with than another one of Antony Stark’s screw ups.
“It was good, Stefen, thank you.”
“Has there been a time where you’ve not been cross with me?”
With a sharp nod, Stefen turned and strode from the study with militant stride, his back ramrod straight and his hands fisted tight, leaving Tony staring after him with the memory of the hurt in those eyes haunting his every thought.
As if coming up from water the sound of Peggy's piano floated through the air and a shiver ran down Steve's spine. How long had Tony been playing he wondered. He should have heard it. What was wrong with him?  Fear spiked through him, hot and tangy. Bucky was right. He was too distracted when he needed to be sharp and focused. He had to clear his mind.
Steve's insides went cold. The man continued to watch him well aware that Steve could see him.
Nik, the bastard, didn’t even bother to disagree with him. He just nodded gravely and asked Tony why, knowing that, he seemed so determined to throw it away.
either. What do you really know about him? Nothing, clearly, cuss he's a spy!" Bucky spat. "Christ, Steve. Focus on the plan, not on his cock-"
"Only the people can speak Romany and your father speaks to us, though he speaks differently. Our family, we are Sinti. They are cousins to the Roma, but we are all Rom, all family. Bah, what am I saying this to you for? You don't have a clue what I'm talking about do you gadje-boy? " Pietro laughed unkindly and Péter glowered at him.
! Why was he… why couldn’t he? He’d never told her about the suffering and death that awaited those sent to the camps, but she saw and observed so much. What if she kept doing this? What if she got caught!
“Who could tell, with how besottedly you gaze at me,” Jan quipped with a roll of almond shaped eyes. “You should smile Captain, or people might wonder why you bothered to dance with me at all.”
Luzzato must have convinced the rabbi they weren’t spies because they were led inside and down a long hall along the sanctuary, towards the offices in the back of the building. Several of them had been cleared of furniture and lined with pallets to create temporary bed stays.
“Julia has run to get him,” Hortense answered as she draped the blanket over his shoulders.
“Oh God” Bruce gaped, ducking slightly to cover his head as glass rained down and the shriek of alarms throughout the camp intensified.
And then Tony imagined so clearly those blue eyes watching him closely as he wiped grease from his brow that Rogers might as well have been looming over him; he could feel their intensity, the spark low in his belly they ignited.
He could feel the numbness creeping back in, making his body ache the ache of the ancient.
Without questioning the feeling further, he abandoned his quest for acidic materials to investigate, turning the corner just in time to catch Frauline Werner disappearing into the captain’s study, shutting the door with a soft click behind her.
There was an odd moment of silence where Tony worried that Stefen had picked up on his off moment (and God he hoped not, because the last subject he wanted to broach was
“Am I the first man you’ve ever had like this?” Tony asked through a dry throat, because it was important, but his throat felt dryer than a desert in the absence of Stefen’s warm and wet mouth. He ran his tongue over his lip, swallowing thickly when Stefen’s gaze zeroed on the movement. A devilish grin widened Tony’s mouth, wonder trickling through him at the realization.
Haushügel. Tony’s father had bought the estate (including the surrounding groves and the private stretch of beach at the bottom of the limestone cliff upon which the house perched) from a poor Austrian noble who had fallen upon hard times. Pola had been the home of quite a few nobles, and the ideal summer retreat for all the rest during the height of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It had meant a great deal to Hughard - a self-made man born in the waning light of the Prussians and the bright burst of the German industrial empire - to acquire such a feather in his cap.
Tony had meant what he’d said, the thought of tying his life to another man’s did not bother him. He’d follow Stefen as long as Stefen wished to be followed, but there must be trust between them. There had to be. Stefen could not keep him separate from his hardships any longer and he had to allow Tony to share his burdens. How else could Tony bring himself to put his faith in the man?
“– and was very much in love with her husband while she lived, so I would refrain from making such comments in the Captain’s hearing. In fact, if I were you Stark I’d focus on not saying much to the Captain at all.”
They had to go.
of all things. Charlotte wondered bitterly if Peggy had known, when she’d been picking out the finishing and placing the furnishings of this room with such loving devotion, that the man who claimed to love her was a homosexual.
“You’re stealing from us.” Natacha accused, flicking off her light and plunging them into the dark once more, leaving only the light from the moon filtering in from the window. Cameron must have recognized her voice because he sighed audibly in relief.
Tracking an injured man through the wilderness sounded like an easy task, and might have been, if not for the complication that Bucky was a wanted man himself and every officer between them and Munich was engaged in the search for escaped prisoner ‘Stefen Gavril Rogers’, who was injured, slow, and would surely have been captured if Bucky had not been there a step behind.
"You alright Tony?" he heard Clint call, though the boy wisely stayed curled low in his corner, stomach pressed to the bed of the truck. Tony nodded wordlessly in answer and inched his way toward his suitcase, which thankfully hadn't been thrown out of the truck and was resting near Bruce's feet.
She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and giggled. Péter fought a grin. Natacha was like father. She used to laugh more.
was so many beautiful things, but not all things beautiful. It was the discrimination and subjugation of Slavic peoples. The fight for and colonization of land in the name of nationalism. But
“James got you dirty. You hate being dirty and James hates being told what to do. You got into a fight and Péter probably sent you back inside, and that’s when James decided to redecorate.”
Natacha let out a small wounded sound, her fists flying to her mouth as if to block any repeat, and Péter wrapped his arm around her.
“If there's work to be done, I know you’ll do what you must.” Steve belatedly responded, drawing Péter and Ian’s gazes away from their game. With their attention, he nodded towards James and continued, “You'll have to help him. I’ll do everything I can to come back. Understand? But you’re all he has until then."
His hands shook as he searched the jars of preserves Willamina had stacked in the back of the pantry, squinting to read her loopy handwriting on the labels.  He wondered if it would do any good telling Uncle Bucky that soup wasn't proper medicine. They should call for the doctor again, make him stay until he'd figured out what was wrong with father.
"Indeed, I am Frauline Van Dynne." Tony stepped back to invite them inside and stared curiously between the woman and her two companions once they’d stepped into the front hall.
“We’re all very concerned. But I just can’t think Dr. Erskine had anything to do with it. He has been a friend to the Major for many years.” She clasped her hands in front of her in what might have been meant to be a docile move but just had the effect of making her look more imposing. Like a school teacher about to sting their knuckles.
The foreboding thought sank any feelings of wonder or excitement Tony had previously felt at the presence of a national icon at the abbey. Captain Rogers for all of his nobility was still a soldier. He was sworn to serve king and country, even if said country had gone to the devil.
. No one was there.
“He sent you here to keep you alive,” Nik answered, pulling Tony out of his dark memories and back to the present. Only the present felt no less dark to Tony. Especially when Nik added, “Yinsen got you here, to keep you alive.”
but now he’d die. She grinded her teeth, savagely holding her breath in so that not a sound escaped.
Here in Pola things were different. On the one hand, signs of the escalating war in Europe were everywhere. The headlines talked of few things but Mussolini’s ‘pact of stele’ with Germany, and Hitler’s demands for increased persecution of Jews; but on the other hand, Italy was still Italy. People scoffed at the idea of bloodying their hands with their neighbors blood the way the German’s had. Here, the music still played, and the people still danced. Children still went to school, and lovers still kissed beneath olive trees. So, when people said, “
“Tonight, we walked in a dream, but reality waits.” Tony lamented with a small smile, pausing at the gate. Stefen nodded, turning his head to look up at the house where light spilled out from the windows along with the sound of music, laughter, and many voices talking at once.
He did. His worst was particularly terrible. Mostly because he had no patience for sighting, nor any care for wind control; and also because Stefen being focused on him meant he couldn’t focus on Péter's poor performance.
“Can you sing?” James questioned him curiously and Pepper's face shuttered a little.
"Yes." The butler drew out the word. “I’m Herr Hammer, and you see, I'm afraid I've just done the floors. You wouldn't mind terribly if I asked you to use the pantry door?"
Steve looked like someone had punched him and as much as that was viciously satisfying there was still a part of Bucky that felt like a bastard for saying it. Cursing, he lunged out of his seat, breathing hard as he paced the terrace. Stopping abruptly to lean against the railing Bucky paused to catch his breath, the silence thick between them.
-The Road-
It was best to trim the branches and wrap the ropes around the trunk before they completely severed the tree from its base, to make it easier for dragging and hoisting upon the sled. Ian attacked the task the same way he did everything, with determined focus, the ax swinging with strength and precision impressive for a boy not quite twelve.
Even after he drained the tub his normally playful little boy did nothing but shake and cling to him while Steve dried him off.
Pepper and Willamina seemed to realize it too because the tension was slowly draining from their faces, overtaken by hopeful smiles, shy as green shoots peeking through the last of winters snow.
He hadn’t told Charlotte anything but what was right in front of her nose, and she was an ally, a friend, but he wouldn’t try and convince anyone that made it better. He knew the truth better than anyone, that there was no trusting anyone in this world but each other. Not for he and Stefen.  Charlotte loved Stefen, of that Bucky had no doubt. But that meant little to gadje in the end. When it came down to you or them. There was no predicting what Charlotte would do, now that the tide was turned against them. He’d have to call Stevie. He just hoped it wouldn’t be too late.
"Then do you have a moment to tell me what you expect me to tell your children?”
Steve could not shake the feeling of unease that had plagued him all morning.  Something was coming. He was certain of it, though he was not sure from what direction. He had not survived this long as a soldier by ignoring his instincts.  He dropped Tony and the children off at the Festival hall in the city, so that they could have their practice with Nigel and argued quietly once more with Tony about the wisdom of allowing the children to perform in the winter concert.
“What were you reading?” the boy asked once he’d taken a few bites of soup, curious blue eyes seeking Tony’s once more.
In some other time or place, maybe Steve would have been proud of the way he stood up for his sister and protected her. Right now, Steve wanted to scream because even after everything that happened, his son thought
Tony’s lips spread slowly into a smile that to him felt a touch feverish.
He cleared his throat, a little startled by the force of his aggression and took a breath, trying to settle his frayed nerves before starting again.
Steve nodded his understanding and Luzzato left them, after assuring them that someone would be along with dry towels and supper was in an hour. Thankful the trunks that they had packed for the journey had held up well in the rain, and their few belongings had suffered nothing more than a little dampness.
He should have loved the man until he couldn’t stand to get out of bed. Next time… if he got a next time, Tony promised himself that he would.
“We’ve got a truck and ammunition. Wolfe will handle the diversion but we’ll only have a window of thirty minutes to get in and get out. Coulson’s got their paperwork sorted with the British embassy. They’ll have full asylum if we can just get them on British soil.”
It became clear though as she began to speak that all she needed from him was to listen.
Hughard had believed Tony could change the world. Apparently.  But Tony would never have a chance to ask his father if what the abbot had said was true. It didn’t matter, he realized. It didn’t matter what Hughard Stark had believed or didn’t believe. What mattered was that Tony believed.
God damn Vodka.
“Well it’s all I know how to make so it’s all we have. Eat up.” Tony reprimanded him. “Why can’t the cook come back?” James continued to whine, poking petulantly at the gray mush in his bowl.
(Please. They’re all I have left.)
Steve shook his hand, hoping the message came across anyway.
"I wouldn't hear of it. The money is not even mine in any case.” When he saw her curiosity Tony grinned, explaining. “My journey is being financed by my employer and I’ve been ordered to have whatever I like, damn the expense."
Ian’s brow furrowed in sympathy. Wordlessly he wiggled back into the seat, leaning so that his blond head rested in the crook of Tony’s shoulder. Tony stiffened in surprise - Ian was not usually as cuddly as his other siblings – but as minutes ticked passed and Ian seemed content there, he slowly relaxed.
"Captain Rogers. If there is still some confusion over my loyalties I would be happy to restate my case."
~*~*~*~
“We’re not discussing this. That’s the end of it!” Captain Rogers (and it was truly no less than the return of the vaunted Captain Rogers) snapped and James flinched, before swelling up like a puffer fish.
“Is there a point, Herr Stark, or is this just carefully designed small talk to put us to sleep?”
“But why aren't there any crustaceans in our lake?” Artur scrunched up his face and tugged at Steve's sleeve impatiently. Steve stumbled over the boy for the second time and quickly righted himself, taking in a deep breath to rein in his temper. The dark cloud that had hung over Steve his entire drive home was not Artur’s fault. He'd purposely gone a longer route on the way home, his thoughts turning over in a jumble, always coming back to Tony. By the time he'd parked and handed over his motorbike to Hogan he'd not come any closer to a decision on what to do. The only thing he knew for certain was that he needed to see him. Steve had come striding through the back door, intent on finding Tony and confronting him but Artur had been there in the kitchen with Willamina getting a snack and was now all worked up about some water creature Tony had been teaching the children about.
Stefen's eyes glinted with amusement but if he smiled, Tony couldn't know as he chose that moment to sip from his drink. A pleased sound hummed in his throat and Tony tried not to fixate on the way it moved as Stefen swallowed, but he really couldn't miss the way that Stefen's pink tongue chased the sweet frothy residue left on the rim.
“It’s not safe, Tony, I’ve told you.”
“In my humble opinion, Sir, it would benefit your goals if you were to wait a while more. Yes? Just to see how things work out.”
and got busy getting some dry clothes for the poor child.
Oh, he would like to.  He‘d like to put himself to task at unraveling Stefen piece by-
Tony didn’t know about that untested theory. Needing a safe work area to create explosives that wouldn’t endanger the children had largely been the point of reinforcing the workshop in the first place.
Antony Stark was lucky that Steve was a man of caution, whose military experience had taught him to heavily rely on strategy, because as he’d hurried toward the sound of his children's hollering voices he’d wanted to rush in, shoot first and ask questions later, but instead he’d crept forward with singular focus and silently cracked open the door to assess the situation and formulate a plan of attack.
It struck Steve then that she’d only been a baby when Bucky had left for Budapest. She had no real memories of him besides the stories he and her older siblings would tell. A fault, he thought with a cringe, that was as much his own as it was Bucky’s.
going to crash! He gulped a deep breath and kicked off with one leg, sending the sled down the slope.
“Not really. Why?”
Yes, yes, it was all part of a larger design to kill you, but ends must! James’ asthma was keeping him from breathing while his body tried to fight off an infection. He needed intervention and he needed it quickly.
Too slowly, because Stefen was there in a rush quicker than he could blink, batting Tony’s swinging fists aside and grappling for a hold on his wrists as he pushed him back against the wall and caged him tightly with his body. Tony glared at him, teeth bared as he struggled to catch his breath and Stefen stared down at him, barely winded, a feral gleam in his eye that made an altogether different kind of heat prickle over Tony’s skin.
“We need to get to the abbey!” he hollered back, not bothering to slow or make sure that Péter was keeping up. Knowing what Stefen had in his system now, every second they wasted was a second closer to anything approximating a cure losing its effectiveness.
Words beat at his skull and tore at him to be released, but all he could manage through his broken throat was Péter's name.
,” he whispered, hiding his stinging eyes in her dark hair. She squeezed his neck in a hug and whispered back. “
“What is this?” Stefen demanded once more, but this time it was heavy with knowing.
The cook beamed and Pepper bit back a smile. Tony hummed low in his throat, doing his best to do the same, but he doubted very much that he succeeded.
Tony reached without thinking, yanking James and Ian down with him and covering them with his body as the cabin filled with screams around him. Something struck Tont against the shoulder and rolled down his back but he didn’t dare lift his head to see what it was. His heart was slamming so loudly in his ear drums, the wailing cry of the nameless child fighting for supremacy, that it took a long moment for Tony to realize when the gunfire had stopped and to recognize the sound of the aircraft engine was receding.
It was snowing. Light fluffy tufts of the stuff drifting down from the sky past the windows of his bedroom. In the mountains it had snowed constantly. Steve could almost have grown to like it for the quiet stillness it brought, and the deceptive spell of warmth that it settled around their shoulders. But there were so many dangers that came with the snow. The loss of visibility and the chance that you might not see your enemy sneaking up on you. And always, lurking at the back of all of their minds, was the fear of when it stopped. When everything turned to ice and the temperature plummeted so low their breaths froze in their lungs. The lucky ones fell asleep while the snow was still falling and simply didn’t wake. Dying after the ice had set was slow, the minutes sluggishly sliding past while your mind left you and your heart slowed.
"Captain," Pepper greeted Stefen with a prim curtsey, Willamina following wordlessly. "Is there something you needed?"
"Lehnsherr is German. The rising tensions in Germany before Hitler came to power had him retreat from the pubic and the last fifteen years or so has seen him living like a recluse on old family land. The Rom do not like outsiders, but they have been known to make expectations for those willing to allow them to camp on their land undisturbed. The rest I'm sure you can put together yourself."
“Can I really take it, Mama?” the girl, whose name must have been Becca, whispered back and Péter nodded with a smile. Becca took the little soldier from him shyly and mumbled her thanks, tucking it in close to her chest with a grin just as the whistle blew one last time and the ticket collector announced it was the last call for boarders.
“You have to ask me that, after everything they’ve done?” Tony asked, pausing his ministrations to stare hard at Bruce who stared back, eyes searching his.
A giggle burbled up from in Ian’s chest and he clamped his lips shut over it but just ended up snorting loudly.
If Tony noticed the change in address he didn't show it. He continued to play with the same finesse as before, the careful timber of the piano slow enough to rake Steve's nerves.  Enough of this.
“I’ve been here the entire time.” Charlotte had gone to speak to Captain Pavlovic’s wife about...something or another, and had left him to mingle on his own.
“I might.” Tony gestured for the parcels. “I believe those are mine.”
Even now Natacha's face was pinched as she pulled Maria onto the back of her bicycle, the little girl clutching at Natacha’s sides anxiously, not at all sure about this cycling business.
Steve turned from where he sat to glance toward the table, where he was keeping an eye on Bucky who was playing a game of cards with Kroger and Zimmerman, loud and happy in a way that Steve could only be envious of courtesy of the Pilots Salt Parodi had passed around to the weary men.
It was irritating, was what it was. For Christ sake. Steve loved his children. More than anything. More than his own life. He really could do without Bucky's chastising and Starks constant pushing and prodding.
True to form, Steve straightened up and fixed Bucky with a first-rate glare.
“I’m already hugging you!” Artur chirped abandoning Steve’s leg to clasp both arms tightly around Bucky. He squealed with delight when the man stooped and pulled him up as if he were still as small as Maria.
“Not to watch the children, Tony, but as a friend.” Stefen interjected earnestly. “As my friend.”
It was absolute suicide but how could he say no to an invitation like that?
“She’s family Buck!” Stefen insisted stubbornly. “We’ll move the wedding up. We can send the children ahead, say they’re going to their grandparents while we’re on our honeymoon just as we planned.”
~*~*~*~
Once given the all clear, Tony and Clint were led into the camp up to the administrative building. They were smirked at and jeered at by a few of the Krippo they passed but most, Tony noticed seemed fine to completely ignore them.  A few nodded and lowered their eyes respectfully, hastily crossing themselves as if Tony were a scarlet vampire stalking their dark gloomy halls, and he did not know whether that relieved him or depressed him. Along the way they passed through a very noisy area full of barred cells holding men and women in plain clothes, yellow stars betraying that they were Jews. Some were siting in silence, drawing away in fear as the warden passed with his entourage, while others cried out in anger demanding to be released.
Of course, Péter thought, he wouldn't have either. He frowned, wondering at Natacha's continued silence, taking in the unnaturally still way she was standing, careful to look at neither of them.
“What are you doing?” Natacha asked, her voice low as not to wake her younger siblings who had fallen into an exhausted sleep sandwiched between her and Péter.
Tony chuckled and said something about what a kind and considerate daughter she was, and everyone treated it as if it were all some joke. As if it were perfectly normally to be discussing his little girl having children before she’d even bled for the first time.
His expression must have given away the bent of his thoughts because Farkas frowned disapprovingly as if he’d heard them.
“You’re coming too Father?” Artur seemed to catch on first, blue eyes going wide with tremulous hope and Tony’s heart tugged. Around the table the other six were clearly in agreement, a chorus of voices ringing out in variations of enticement.
They’d touted Rogers and his family out to every parade and festival for months, Dvorak couldn’t go anywhere without hearing where ‘The Lion of Austria’ and his little cubs had been – which only made their sudden disappearance from public all the more noticeable. People were talking, and that was dangerous. Odd behaviors that had escaped scrutiny once before were now being brought back and examined in the light.
Throat tight with emotion Steve silently folded the letter and placed it back in its envelope. It would have to be burned he knew, but he was loath to do it. Glad that at least for a little while he could keep his old friend’s words close to his chest.
“Shh pisliskurja. Shh.” He soothed her, locking her to his chest as if she were meant to become a part of him and he would simply carry her around always, like a turtle protected in a shell. Natacha clung to him as tightly as she could.
Why the hell was his bed this huge? He wondered as everyone got resettled. Rather an opulent accessory for a guest bedroom. What on earth had Rogers’ previous governesses gotten up to? Then again, he couldn’t help but remember the much mentioned Frauline Glass and her morning visits to the Captain’s room. Should he include that in his letters to Farkas? Dear Father Superior, Captain Rogers is a drunken brute who spends his time neglecting his children and bedding the help. No sign of military secrets under the bed but will keep looking. How are Brother Banner’s vegetables coming in this season?
Two days before his execution the door to Steve’s cell finally opened.
His frown deepened, confusion settling in. The sound was coming from Stark he realized.
Clinton came to deliver it, his face glum and eyes heavy with impotent anger.
Péter did as Bucky had said and went to the kitchen to search through Willamina's preserves. He knew that Bucky and the others were just trying to keep him safe, but it irked him just the same to be treated like a child who couldn't make decisions for himself. It wasn't as though Péter didn't know there was a chance he could catch whatever his father had caught. But what did they think, that he'd be happy if his father died and then all of the rest of them get sick and he didn't? It should have been his choice, like helping Cameron and Daniel had been his choice. He'd survived that hadn't he? Hadn't he proven by now that he could take care of himself and make his own decisions?
Natacha understood the warning for what it truly meant. Just because her father had been invited, didn’t mean he was liked, or that he was trusted. He was not as careful as he should be, and even so, Natacha did not imagine for a moment that anyone truly believed her father was anything but a true Austrian at heart. He was a son of the soil and a man of the people, and that was what they liked about him. It was also what made him a threat that time would inevitably see dealt with. The Führer already knew what he had in Major Stefen Rogers. More than just a show of his power, his invitation was a chance to observe. He would be looking to see what role Natacha and her siblings would play in his grand design.
“You don’t have to stay in with me, you can go back. I can manage.” Ian insisted, his head dipping under again.
The poster featured a sketch of an ordinary looking man. Heavy set, with heavy eyebrows and a protruding brow. He was no different from the dozens of people who disappeared from the city every day, except he was Italian, and a profitable fish merchant. That, and he was the third man of that type to go missing only to be found stabbed to death in just a handful of weeks. It was an uneasy time in Pola, and not just because they were on the brink of joining the war.
feel better. Tony still shuddered to think of how close they’d come to losing it all. How close they still were.
“You’d be surprised. You wait here while I gather what we’ll need for the experiment.” Tony advised him and turned for the door. He paused when he heard Péter call his name, shyly, turning to look back at the boy with a brow arched in question.
“Where are the others?” Tony asked, his throat tight as he looked over at James who was still clinging to to his father’s side like a burr. The little boy shrugged dismissively mumbling something about Ian having been behind them, and Tony frowned concerned.
He saw Stark move inside the car, yammering with that big mouth of his, and for half a second Bucky entertained the thought that things might go off without a hitch. He should have known better really. The brass didn’t seem to like whatever Stark was suggesting because that look of suspicion turned to one of deeply set hostility as the soldier barked something back at Stark and reached for his radio.
"Not so very old Herr Stark. I think you’re quite distinguished." Natacha replied coyly, placing her hand gently in his. There was a very real smile in her eyes, which twinkled grateful and fond at him in the lanternlight as Emil stepped aside and Tony drew her into the crush of dancers.
“I may be gone for quite a long time, which will mean a lot of changes around here. Lucky we’ve done this before, right?”
“Even if you’ve had it for a while. It doesn’t always stay.”
“I believe James and Artur are far too young for officers' school.” Steve deadpanned.
A few yards away Péter and Artur had paused to watch fearfully and even though he couldn’t pause to look he just knew the captain and Bakhuizen had come running.
Stefen’s hips juddered against him and he came suddenly with a strangled gasp, and then unable to keep holding himself up he slumped down, body laying heavily over Tony’s.
Meanwhile he had no idea where the Captain was. No way of knowing if he was on the ground in Czechoslovakia or if the plans for assignation were even now moving forward. Every cell in Tony’s body urged him to do something to protect him, but Tony didn’t know enough to do what was necessary to protect Stefen (or himself and the children for that matter) and that he could no longer abide.
“Dark hair, medium height, her face was made up. The lips were red. She had a dark coat on. He says Pisani seemed
The world had changed, and Charlotte was not a fool. It was no longer safe in Vienna for a woman unattached, especially one who had spent years active in community service and political fundraising as Charlotte had.
. Honest. And Herr Stark had lived through the great war! He should be as brave as Péter was trying to be. Braver! He should be helping calm the girls, and helping Péter explain it to Artur who was pale and terrified because Péter didn’t know what words to use! He couldn’t just walk away from them.
Steve labored to calm his breathing, a dull ringing in his ears as Zimmerman’s words banged around like rockets in his head. All he could think of was what he’d heard, and the little he’d seen, that had been enough to make his blood go cold.
Natacha glanced at him and this time Bucky saw something almost fearful in her eyes but so terribly hopeful that he knew he’d made the right call.
Your friend,
Finally, they rounded the hill and the villa appeared through the trees, stood like a somber widow at the edge of the lake.  Tony couldn't describe what had changed in the weeks since he'd last lain eyes on it, but to him the house looked leached of warmth, the grounds overgrown and shadows creeping across it like reaching fingers. He found himself shivering and for the first time in hours not from the cold.
Bucky raised his eyebrows, wondering for a moment who would have had the audacity, before his eyes were drawn to the figure of Stark below, still banging away at those boats. Of course.
Steve gasped, jack knifing up in the bed, his sheets pooling around him as he clamped a hand violently over his mouth.
There was a horrible ache in his chest. He was holding his breath he realized, clenching the railing in a white knuckled grip. He waited, the time scraping at him, the pain in his chest growing stronger. He didn’t care about the pain. All of his focus was on the doors that were pushing open as weary travelers began to fill the receiving hall. Hats bobbed on heads and long coats obscured figures, making it nearly impossible to distinguish one soul from the next.
Perhaps, some snide voice in the back of his mind poked at his conscience, perhaps Stefen kept secrets because Tony kept secrets.
The dream had felt so real and like so many of his dreams before, it stayed with him. He couldn’t shake the feeling of Tony’s breath ghosting over the back of his neck, mouth skating over his temple, demanding as always, as he’d whispered filth with unbearable tenderness.
“Then you’ll enjoy proving it.”
James kicked out at him, struggling with all his might but Tony held on tight wrestling him to the ground. No small feat, Ian knew. James was still skinny and on the short end but his strength when he got going always caught people off guard.
“What happened next?” Péter, irritated with all the interruptions, demanded to know.
Pulling himself together Steve looked up at the woman, but the greeting died on his lips. There was no food and water in her hands today and no shovel. Instead, her face was white, lips closed tightly as she surveyed him with the gravest expression that he’d ever seen her wear.
There was a racket just above him and Steve flinched away from the sound, desperately blinking his vision clear until he was looking into a pair of big gray eyes. He jerked back, over balancing and collapsing in a heap on his side with a pained huff.
They'd been on the water for about four hours to Tony's estimation. It was colder now than it had been walking through the fields, but maybe that was just because his robes were half soaked. Tony kept the boat steady as she traveled up the Amper towards the Isar, a mostly steady journey through quiet hills and barren German fields. It was good in some respects that they were making this journey in the early part of winter, as there were few farmers, fisherman or any of the like still wandering about to spot them. Still, those first few hours he stayed on edge, expecting to spot a patrol on one of the roads they passed. But after a while Tony began to notice himself preoccupied by other things, mainly the cold in his hands and the hunger beginning too twist through his belly.
"We need to keep moving," Clinton called, and Tony looked over to find him standing in the bed of the truck, collecting fallen bullet casings and stuffing them into his pockets. "They’ll send more trucks when those guys don’t answer their radio.”
He didn’t doubt that Bakhuizen was devoted to Stefen, but absolute devotion was absolute. It made a man’s spirit tremble and his teeth gnash, but kept his hands steady as he pulled the trigger.
“But why are they making that old man do it?” Tony could hear the confusion in Artur’s voice but it didn’t stop the painful burning in his chest when James replied, as eager as a schoolboy in classroom who knew he had the correct answer for once.
“Here.” he answered, and in the dark Tony released a frustrated huff of breath.
Tony answered Stefen’s questioning gaze with a shrug. He supposed all would be answered in time.
Ian aborted the thought. If mother were here it would be the same.
“What are you doing here?” She asked, as soon as she’d closed the car door behind herself. But Bucky did not reply, his eyes fixed somewhere out her window. Natacha looked and saw that he was watching Emil and the group she’d left behind.
The twenty seventh day of December dawned cold and grey at the villa, where a dark cloud had descended like something blown in on an ill wind. The house staff had dwindled down to just the Hogans, the kook and the kitchen girl. Julia had not come back to work following the holiday and neither had Hammer. If that weren’t an ill enough omen, the baroness had left the house the night before without warning.
Eventually Natacha took charge of Maria and Artur’s hands in an attempt to keep the group moving forward while Ian tried in vain to keep a rein on James, who was refusing on principle to be within ten feet of his brother. They made quite a scene with Ian scooting past people, apologizing as he chased his brother who had no such misgivings about knocking into passerby rushing from one window to the next.
“I hope you’re still up for coming back. I know it is dangerous- ”
“These aren’t all for me Tony, some are for Father.” She was informing him sweetly when a door down the hall burst open and Artur appeared with an armful of brightly colored Knick-knacks, the handle of what appeared to be a tennis racket jutting out from beneath his elbow like an extra limb.
He wasn’t sure how to answer that. There was a part of Bucky that was looking forward to returning to work, for however long he would have it. His business had suffered since the onset of Anschluss. The German public had a low opinion of music and other forms of "frivolous" entertainment, now that the Reich was urging the people to focus on what they considered far nobler pursuits.
“What is it Ona? What’s wrong?” she called, and Ona looked back over her shoulder towards the field. Magda had the sudden frightening image of the gestapo in her mind marching down on their little farm bringing death in their wake. This was it, what they’d always feared had come, she thought, her heart beginning to pound. Franz had been arrested and they were going to be dragged in for questioning.
Tony laughed and leaned closer. His breath was hot, tickling Steve’s ear.
For a long moment the captain said nothing before he turned back to meet Tony's gaze with a startling level of frankness.
"You're just cattle to them. Austria isn't worth it. It's not worth it."
So we've only gotten Tony's first impressions of them here but we'll meet the Rogers children in earnest next chapter. As this story centers as much on the family as it does the war time elements (if not more) each child has been lovingly crafted for it. James Rogers is not James "Bucky" Barnes but James Rogers of the Next Avengers (Earth 555326). Uncle Bucky will be coming along next chapter as well, so if you've been minding the tags and got a bit of a jolt, I wanted to clarify that there is no incest in this story. Peter and Natacha are of course Peter Parker and Natasha Romanov, Ian is Ian Zola of dimension Z, while Maria and Sara are the names of Tony and Steve's mothers. Last but not least Artur is a loving homage to Arto from sara_holmes wonderful fic Counterpart. I demand you run not walk over there and read it if you haven't already.
The unspoken word lingered between them.
He was suddenly without a shadow of a doubt, that this had been the single worst miscalculation of his life. Because there Stefen was standing waist deep, water streaming down face and neck to run over the dips and curves of his chest.
He took the hammer from Tony with a sly grin and gestured for him to stand aside. Stepping up, he shot a glance at the operator and flicked his eyes toward the back panel where he knew the lever was hidden. The operators’ brows raised and a delighted grin split his cheeks as Steve swung the hammer.
"That great rattling din you mean?"
“As a picture,” Bucky reassured her with a tap to the nose. He had not missed the unusual informality between Tony and the children, odd for someone so new in their life and an authority at that. He wasn’t sure yet if he like it.
“I wanted to be alone. Nothing happened.”
Tony fell on his backside, too stunned to do much else but blink back up at the captain. Though he must have shouted because a moment later Herr Bakhuizen had appeared in the door.
He was woken when the sun was doing its level best to penetrate the silk canopy surrounding the bed and a pair of little fingers decided to test his wakefulness by poking him repeatedly on the cheek.
Tony guided them to the bed with backwards steps and Stefen followed. They shed clothing quickly and wordlessly, sharing rushed breaths between their lips like secrets, hands grasping desperately at the other as the room spun around them. The need for quiet was an insistent murmur at the back of his mind; but it kept slipping away at the heat of every touch. When Stefen touched him, his head filled with the pleasure of it till he could think of nothing else.
They had them every year at Christmas time. It was a simple cookie, easy to get right.
Stefen’s angry blue eyes roved over his face for a moment before the emotion in them shifted to something else, Tony couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Not quite anger anymore, but not
Bucky twisted his lips up in a tired smile and waved. It was thoughts of getting through the kitchen door and into the warm heat he could see wafting from the open door that gave him the energy to climb down from the truck and trudge through the snow to meet her.
No. Tony struggled to get ahold of himself, to
"You'd have both starved Stefen." Tony reminded him staunchly. Perhaps he was biased, but Tony could have taken a swing at Bucky himself for nailing that particular burden of guilt to Steve’s shoulders. The damn war had not been kind to anyone. Tony’s family had been rich, his father’s estate paying the abbey handsomely for his upkeep and yet there had been many bleak days at the abbey even for him. How much more impossible must it have been for a traveling band of gypsies in the middle of war-torn Galicia? “I know what it cost you, but it is not a sin to survive. You did what you had to, and if Bucky isn’t grateful for that he’s a fool.”
Da always said, courage wasn’t about not being afraid. It was about facing your fear.
The man just stood there like a plank of wood, as seven pairs of eyes in various states of distress stared up at him, saying nothing. Finally he cleared his throat and nodded toward Frau Hogan who was standing behind Ian with her hands upon the boy’s shoulder.
Every eye within the Third Reich would be open, scouring road and train car for enemy number one. They wouldn’t stand for the humiliation of letting him escape. Couldn’t afford it or the doubts it would inspire about their control over the country. It would be better for her if she weren’t involved. She could be killed just for keeping him alive this long. To her credit, she seemed to be thinking the same thing. A slight green tinge had taken to her skin. A kind woman Magda, but not stupid.
Virginia looked toward Stefen with apology and question, unsure what to do in light of the twins discovery now that the staff and Steve's own children had seen them.
This year, when they opened their envelopes, they’d find the checks were much heftier than they’d ever been. Peggy’s trust at the State Bank had taken a staggering hit – an occurrence Steve did not expect to go unignored by the heads of the Reich.
“You can’t escape up there you know.”
Patroche.
. Shall we get started then?”
"We?" Stefen demanded with a sharply raised brow and Tony rolled his eyes.
was all he wanted for her.
"Stark-" he began but Artur wasn’t finished. The boy was level enough with Steve who was still seated to grab his chin and force his gaze away from Tony. Steve tensed in surprise, thankfully that he didn’t instinctively lash out. Artur held Steve's face, serious blue eyes gazing back at him.
"Merry Christmas, all of you." Steve returned with a small smile, accepting the seat next to Julia that Bucky pointed out to him, his cheeks stuffed full of food.
We apologize it takes us so long to get these chapters out. The next chapter is rather transitional and therefore should be out quicker. Steve is coming home with Bucky in tow, and given the nature of what has occurred while he was away I doubt Tony will be able to keep his promise about yelling being done in the house. But you have our promise that after this harrowing bit some healing fluffy family times are on the way. Calm before the storm?
"You're reminding me a lot of your father right now," the abbot murmured and Tony glowered at him.
Bucky looked away and Steve’s heart sank.
~*~*~*~
Father blinked once. Twice. Opened his mouth and then closed it again. Swallowed and then finally turned back to his frantic packing, gritting out simply, “Bucky.”
He looked up, catching Bucky’s eye across the space through the open doors and realized that the low vibration in his chest was humming, coming from him no less. Bucky winked at him and Steve let the tension in his shoulders slide away, returning to his task.
James and Ian were among the last children to trickle out. Péter, they said, had stayed behind to talk to the professor about a special assignment. Tony was glad to see that at least some of his fears about the children going unchallenged were unfounded. The said Natacha was in the lady’s room and had told them to go on ahead.
It was the most fun Tony had ever had at Christmas time, but too soon it was time to herd the children inside for bathes, skillfully avoiding the sitting room as they went. Once they were clean and dressed, they all trounced down the stairs for dinner, which Charlotte had set to roasting while the children washed up.
Tony glanced back once more. The road was clear so far but that could change at any moment.
It was impossible not to feel see through, open and hollow all at once, and an impotent anger smoldered in the pit of his stomach as he squeezed his cup.
Two days of this hell, of rattling around like a marble in a tin can, while Magda risked everything driving the farm truck to its limits as they crossed the country and up into the mountains.
He startled when Virginia kneeled down by his head (when had she left?) And rolled his shirt sleeve up and began to attend to the abrasion etched across his forearm just like she'd done that very morning. She'd done it up the way Peggy had shown her, cross bandage and all. His stomach rolled with grief and he shifted away from Frau Hogan, hiding his face with his uninjured arm.
“I don’t want to say goodbye!”
Without answering Stefan sank down and began to glide along in the water ahead of them. The white linen of his untucked shirt pooled around him like the skirt of a jelly fish, revealing slips of the pale white skin underneath.
, but perhaps pitied rather than condemned. They had that going for them, all except for Péter and Maria. Maria especially. She was not as fair as Péter and looked dangerously more like their people with every year that passed. His beautiful Maria.
Yes. Tony realized quite suddenly.
Thinking becoming too painful, Steve swallowed and turned his head away from the gold piping on the white ceiling to the side table where Ian had left the book he’d been reading. It was dog eared and well loved. Ian made a habit of joining him those nights when Steve could bring himself to park himself here in the sitting room, desperate to be close to the children but unable to do more than just sit and soak in their presence.
Disgust pooled in his stomach and he clenched fitfully at the napkin in his cut hand. Tony didn’t deserve that and Steve would never offer it to him.
“Because he’s a traitor!” Franz jabbed her roughly in the stomach, pulling away as her grip slackened. But she was quick thinking, and quicker on her feet as she threw herself against the door and spread her arms out to black his reaching hands, her chest heaving from exertion.
Clearly there was something weighing on her mind. Why was she so curious about his relationship with Tony? Steve thought, apprehension like an itch on his skin. What did she mean to get at by opening this line of question?
By afternoon James and Artur were bickering again (with a lot more good nature) over who could carve the best toy soldier from their stockpile of dried branches. Natacha kept one careful eye on them from where she sat, carefully whittling away at what was to become a long pair of hooks for weaving. She had proved the best so far at whittling, her tools always clean edged with precise lines and shapes. Ian wasn’t a far second, but all of the children seemed to enjoy it. Sara’s hands were still a little too unsteady for knife work but she enjoyed watching the little wooden toys the boys made come to life.
, had been his choice (he’d had such strong belief in what the country could become, what they could build together) and no matter how bitter it was to watch that dream die, it was only thanks to that decision that Schmidt hadn’t torn his family apart already.
in his eyes that it carried no sting.
Problem was, these past few months he’d looked under the lid, and he was finding it harder than he’d ever imagined it could be to close it again.
“I think he and Göring are the best thing for Germany. I do. I know they’re very different in their ways, but I had hoped…” Fischer trailed off, leaving the thought unfinished with a sigh. “Hitler is right. We must preserve the German way. Restore Germany’s glory.”
“That was only because those boys – ” James began but quickly aborted with a pain filled exhalation of breath that made Tony suspect he’d been kicked under the table by Ian.
Péter looked green around the gills at the mention of alcohol and Tony smirked.
“Would you believe that I was looking forward to the day my son grew out of dragging strange critters into the house?” Stefen sighed, pulling open the door and Tony followed him, chuckling, as they entered the shop.
"Those were the words, yeah." He drawled, accent thickening Tony was sure just to be an asshole about it.
"Well what did Susann want? Is there something wrong with the twins?"
To Péter’s surprise Herr Stark did stop. He turned slowly around to face him with an aghast expression.
Tony looked at Clint who sprang into action, opening the suitcase and fishing around for the stamped documents the abbot had given them. He handed them over to the Warden who barely looked at them before reaching for the pen sitting in the inkwell on the desk and scratching his signature.
“That’s why your Da joined the army so that he’d never have to beg again for what should have just been given, and he fights every day so that you don’t have to either.”
“What do you mean? What is it you think they would do?” he asked and Stefen sighed, the fire of fight that had been in his eyes-only moments before leaking away, replaced by what Tony could only call bleak exhaustion.
“He’s not a vagrant.” Natasha interjected quietly, sounding droll as ever. Tony was surprised to hear her speak up at all. Tossing one long red braid over her shoulder, she reached for one of the cakes and finished with a dainty little shrug that had Tony gawping both at the daintiness and the words themselves, “He’s a monk.”
“One word, Stark. One more fucking word.” He snarled the warning, rage and panic creating such a storm inside him, he wasn't even sure he’d switched back to German.
“Maybe you’re not as strong as you think you are Tony,” Steve suggested innocently and he laughed when Tony shot him a scathing look.
Péter blinked at him, Steve thought his eyes looked wet.
Perhaps it wasn’t acceptable by any true moral standards. But war had a way of making sure it didn’t matter.
“Promise me you’ll think about Péter? It’s a relief to know that you’ve decided to send them all away and I trust you know what you’re doing-” Tony began, and Steve was torn between frustration and admiration because
The traffic was slow at this time in the evening but Steve found he didn’t mind. Maria was a warm solid weight in his lap and even if Artur’s pointy elbows and knees gave him the odd jab as the boy twisted and turned to see absolutely everything worth seeing. it was nice. It had been too long since he’d enjoyed a carriage ride like this, someone’s thigh pressed close to his and their shoulders nudging one another’s companionably. Cars were faster and more practical these days but he hoped the city didn’t do away with the system entirely. There was something about it.
to bury his heritage and Peggy had certainly never asked it of him. Assimilating had been his choice, being
Pepper had met them at the door to the terrace, handing him a small piece of fine paper with a long number scrawled upon it.
“Yes, at the camp. We lost many men.”
“When I was not much older than Péter, my parents were murdered...” he began and Stefen’s eyes rounded in shock. The official story had said that Hughard and Maria had accidently been trampled to death during the riot because it was prettier than being executed by their own workers.
Underneath the marks was a crudely drawn etching of a horse, already beginning to wear away. He wasn't sure why he’d decided to draw it in the first place, it had cost him part of his left thumb nail.
“Don’t fret, doctor. I won’t damage the golden goose.”
Herr Hammer quickly left his thoughts as he went back to examining his surroundings, his eyes coming to rest on the entrance way. The grand door was a prime example of craftsmanship, made of dark polished wood with intricately carved designs. He could well imagine the sort of entrance one could make coming down those stairs to awaiting guests. He would place money the late Mrs. Rogers had loved every second of it.
Steve didn’t even bother trying to refute the voice inside. It was unimportant how she felt, just that she was alive.
"What if I don't bring my toy? You said we could each pick one toy to bring."
“Of course, I’ll look in on them.” He promised quietly. “You’ve got my word.”
Grinning Bucky turned and knelt down to fetch his violin from its case beside his chair, happy that he’d thought to bring it to the lesson.
It’s cries…. Tony’s step paused as a low sound registered in the dark. He hesitated, his first thought being that Péter was finally showing the signs of someone with a heart condition but no, he'd passed Péter's room already.
“It wasn’t meant to be. I’m tired of listening to him scream every morning,” she returned before turning sharply on her heel and all but stomping away. It was quiet then, but for the sounds of the choked sobs coming from the eight-year-old curled into a ball on the floor.
“I suppose you might escape even with your hands tied, but you won’t make it far in your condition. I don’t know what it’s like in prison, but don’t be a fool. You’ve got your whole life ahead of you.” She said in parting as she stood looking down at him with a strange look of consternation as well as sympathy. She cooed at the goat, who hoofed around her feet snorting anxiously. She bid the animal to keep an eye on him and exited the pen, latching the gate behind her.
“Yes, at quite a young age too.” Obadiah confirmed before Tony could come up with any sort of reply of his own. “Fifteen wasn’t it Tony?”
So Schmidt had survived then. The worst ones always did.
Eventually the soldier had disappeared back inside and thirty minutes or so after, Tony had seen the armored truck he and his companions had arrived in disappearing through the hills down the wide curving road.  He'd stayed put until Bruce had come to fetch him just to be sure it was truly safe.
