Moving to sit on the edge of his bed, he lit the oil lamp with a trembling hand. Once the lamp flickered to life, he jammed a hand through his hair. Then, slowly, he opened the nightstand drawer and pulled out Edward’s letters. Curling up against the headboard, he slowly began to read through every single letter. His eyes were red with exhaustion as dawn broke through the morning haze and illuminated the most recent letter.
I am not entirely sure why you keep insisting I am gorgeous. It is sure sweet of you to say so, though. If you are not careful, you might even give me an ego. Then I might actually become insufferable. What would you do then, hm?
George leaned in closer, his other arm coming up around Steve’s waist. “I know fine art when I see it, baby. If you let me, I’d be happy to keep you warm tonight.”
“Great. Honestly, since the cover was released, I have gotten a few tentative offers for more work.” A wide smile spilled its way across Steve’s lips, making him look like the young man he was. “I might not have to do any factory work, the next couple of months if this keeps up. And it’s all thanks to you all. Especially you, George.” Turning, he beamed at the mercurial man.
Watching the omega’s hands, Buck was pleased to see that he seemed competent. “I know how that goes. Sometimes working with my hands is all I can do to keep my head level.” His gaze moved to scan over the huddling masses of pregnant and injured omegas. He frowned to himself, thinking of what would happen to his own omega if she were caught by Hydra.
Tony wanted to throw up from his nerves about the response. Whether it was because Franklin was busy and just couldn’t make it there. Or because Franklin could have gotten a cold. When he got home from a series of meetings with Pepper and the board, (which needed far too much convincing about a really damn good idea), it was a relief to finally sit and read the letter.
Tony let his mind shift to Doctor Banner. Bruce would know something about monsters, though so far no one had figured out if the doctor had been able to change back from the mean, green fighting machine. Or fix that yet. In terms of Jekyll and Hyde. If there was a way to bring the doctor back, Tony would be happy to speak to him. Banner’s work on gamma radiation alone was incredible. And the fascinating idea of a rage monster, if that’s what the Hulk was, actually presenting was both alarming and … kind of cool.
You did great for it not being your usual style. I cannot say I blame you for your admiration.  Ben is amazingly talented.  I am looking forward to seeing more from you and your art. Everything I see of your work just makes you feel so real to me. That I can find your art more places than my letters. I am so damn happy for you right now.
Once Steve was clean, dressed, and fed, Bucky slid the letter across the table. “You read that while I do dishes. If you want to write him back, I can try to take the letter over today or tomorrow.”
“The comparison has been made a few times in several articles, boss,” Friday answered as Tony blinked rapidly for a moment. Well shit.
Steve worked feverishly, using his downtime between shifts at the factory and doing little posters for the war effort as best he could. By the end of the week he had finished his project, and while it was not perfect, it was certainly a gift meant for Edward. Steve had transformed the leather jacket into a rather swell wallet. On the front it had decorations and designs lifted from Eddie’s doodles of his robots; Steve wanted Dum-E, Butterfingers, and U worked into it somehow. All of the patterns served to create a frame around a quote Steve had liked when he and Edward had been reading
That family friend of yours sure seems amazing. Almost unreal, like some sort of super man. I can understand why you would fancy him so much. But, Eddie, I am sure you would deserve someone that good. You seem smart and creative and so kind. He would be real lucky to have a fella like you, if there were any way for it. As for history books. Well, we all know they have a way of only telling what people want to hear. Maybe he was like us: hiding because it was not safe for him to be who he really was. That weighs on me sometimes. That every day of my life, however long that is, I have to lie to the people around me. Everyone expects I will settle down with some dame, have a pack of kids, and be just like everyone else in the neighborhood. But what if I do not want that? What if that is not who I am? I am scared I am going to lose myself, just so I do not get arrested. Maybe it is the honesty in me, but I do not think I could go my whole life lying about who I want to love.
Tony tapped at his lip with a regular pen; he was still not quite confident enough with the nib on the Conklin pen to write a first draft with that. He sat in the garage working out his reply, tapping his toes to the music blaring out over the speakers.
Back to California and working through the month. Tony thought through how best to help keep them both busy. How he’d try yet another approach to figure out how he would best stumble at whatever the hell Obie was doing. It wasn’t his job to help Steve through his seasonal depression. But if he didn’t at least offer methods of coping, it wouldn’t sit well with him.  Dates and maybe a commission or two were the fastest solutions he could think of to help keep him busy.
I hope you write me back. Just address the letter to R46S on the envelope, and it should reach me within a day or two.
“I’m meeting a friend of mine who might be more to your taste there. She shares that same opinion,” Tony answered with a grin bringing up his folder of pics of the models and bringing up one of his favourite pictures of Demi. He showed the photo he took at the Beverly Hills hotel while Demi was getting a pedicure and reading a book on Aunt Peggy. “I ask because that is where the third mural of Steve’s is. Also because I’m probably going to want food and a drink after this”
Tony couldn’t help but reach out to Steve as he approached, taking his fiancé’s hands in his. “I love you.”
the woman said quickly, casting a fearful look to the forest not too far away. “Stay in the town, find him in the morning. The beasts hunt during the night, but they tend not to attack people during the day.”
—and he hadn't been heard from since. Tony was, of course, the first one to find out when S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to hide it, and he never kept any secrets from Steve. Well, almost never.
,” Steve said, gently cupping Tony’s face with both of his hands. “I’m going to bring you back to the tower—Bruce is still looking for a cure. We’ll figure this out, Tony, we
“Thanks,” Tony replied, because man did it feel good to have other people believing that everything would work out. Just hearing it spoken aloud… it was so nice.
, but… maybe not? He really thought he’d gotten past the whole ‘they just keep me around because I fund the Avengers’ thing, but maybe there was more truth to that than he thought.
. He watched the way that the early-morning sun filtered into the room, lighting up Tony's skin in a brilliant glow. His dark locks covered his face, and his back was turned to Steve. Everything seemed so peaceful until he watched his lover shiver a little.
horses.  There were four half-men, half-birds stuck in the ropes that the guys on horseback holding, like they were trying to catch them... or maybe they were trying to catch the
thing," he murmured. "I know I'd rather have you here by my side any day. You know that, right Tony? Because... while I know that these next few days aren't going to be easy for you... you seem to have forgotten that."
Natasha nodded. "Somehow, a lot of the weapons were broken," she said innocently, like she didn't manipulate any of it. Steve knew that she was unsure about what S.H.I.E.L.D. was using the weapons for, and he wasn't surprised as she dropped a couple of them onto the table. "So Iron Man, you wanted to say something?"
"I love you too," Tony whispered, and Steve was a bit disappointed he didn't comment on the 'no matter what.' He still wasn't sure why Tony wasn't telling him the truth about Iron Man, but if he wasn't ready yet, then he wasn't going to bring it up. Eventually Tony would tell him, and (hopefully soon) he'd realize that no one would think less of him for it. In fact, Steve guessed that the team would be pretty happy if they knew the truth.
"I need you to hold these wires here," Tony murmured, and Clint complied, holding the wires in place with one hand as he lifted his drink back up to his lips with the other.
Steve knew that Tony hated having all of the attention in the room on him when it wasn't a happy, easy conversation.
“I never knew that you thought you weren’t good enough to be an Avenger,” Steve said, looking shocked. “Clint, you’ve always been good enough to be an Avenger.”
, around Tony's shoulders, "you were turned into a faerie." Clint laughed, reaching a feather-covered wing-hand up to Bucky, letting the tiny faerie rest on his feathers. "That's hilarious, Buck, you can't deny that."
He quickly shook his head, watching as this world's Avengers started to gather. It wasn't that they made him uncomfortable, because if they were Avengers that meant that they were superheroes, the good guys, but he didn't know any of them, really.
The super-soldier smiled and nodded. “Get some rest. We’ll be home soon, and when we do get back… I’m getting some food for you, and then as much as I want to lock you away in our bedroom, there’s no way that the team is letting me have you to myself for quite a while.”
Once he'd caught his breath and recovered from the fall—it was a height that normal people wouldn't have been waking up from, and while it hurt like hell, he healed quickly—Steve charged over to where the 'DoomBots' were, managing to take out quite a few before the battle died down.
" Bucky growled, but Tony knew that he wasn't really going to do anything about it. Tony raced over in the direction of the guys on horseback, making sure to stay out of sight.
“Tony… Tony… I don’t know. Where is he? I-I have to see him, Peg.” He didn’t want to beg, but it wasn’t that he had to see the man. It was that he
"What he did?" Steve prompted, feeling ice in his veins. No, there was no way... Howard had always been someone who spoke bluntly and he could see the man saying some cruel things, but there was no way... The look on Tony's face was enough for Steve to know that Howard had become a different man in his later years.
“It’s almost sundown anyway, so you should stay—the forest isn’t the safest place to be in at night, because her creatures tend to live there—once they become mindless beasts, they’re drawn to the forest because this is where she used to live,” the woman explained, gesturing in the direction of the town square. “There’s only one way to get rid of these beasts, and it’s the ritual. It’ll keep everyone safe.”
bringing him home. Tony froze, though, when Bucky pulled out a gun, aimed and fired it all within an instant. Tony knew that his eyes probably made him look like a deer caught in the headlights. Well, until he realized that the gun was pointed at something behind them.
His boyfriend didn't look convinced. In fact, Tony just looked like he was going to be sick. Steve wrapped him up in his arm, holding him close.
"It does make working together out on the battlefield a bit more fun," Stark murmured, and Rogers actually smirked at that. On the battlefield? That meant...
"You're right, I do hate you right now," Tony muttered, glancing over at Steve when his husband put a comforting hand on his shoulder. He gave him a stern look, and Tony sighed. "Thanks... for looking into a way to reverse this."
"Calm down," Tony chuckled. He'd always found it hilarious when Steve Mother Hen-ed the team after missions. "I'm fine. It was just a little smoke and a chloroform mixture, nothing to worry you. It
The horror in Tony’s eyes told him that it was the truth. The fear that was still lingering in the eyes of his teammates, his family, told him all he needed to know. They thought he was dying, and he thought they were dead.
"Once I'm sure that everything has settled down, I'm gonna take you out and we're going to go have some fun without anyone recognizing us whatsoever," Steve said as Tony flipped through the news channels. There was something going on, big enough to call in the Avengers, and he wanted to know what was going on. He hated having to send the team in without him or Steve being allowed to go.
, none of this is against his will. At the current point in time, the journalists were a bit scared of going near him. "I'm just worried that one day he'll realize just how dangerous it is to be saving the city, or the world... and he won't want to have to put up with the heartache if I... if I don't make it home. And if he realizes that soon... I don't want him to leave, Iron Man."
Tony pulled back a little and looked him right in the eye, those stunning brown eyes of his holding a concerned look. “Did you mean it?” Steve raised an eyebrow, confused, so Tony added, “When the team was coming over to get you, and you… you said not to leave, because you didn’t want to lose me… a-and because you loved me.”
," Bucky muttered, breathing a sigh of relief. "Next time you jump off a plane, you better take a parachute."
Tony didn’t complain. He was going to get roughed up whether he liked it or not, so there wasn’t really a reason to complain about it. He’d be dealing with this for
to help, but obviously wasn't able to call the suit to him to be able to protect him and protect the citizens, for several reasons.
you, Tony, and I could see the insecurity in your eyes. I’m not going to demand that you tell me why, but I
“I know you’re telling the truth,” Tony laughed, leaning against Bucky. “Y’know, you were the one person who they weren’t sure what to do with. They barely knew that you existed at the tower, and they
The elevator door opened and Bruce stepped in. “You might want to try something different with the rest of the team, it’ll already have been spread to them by now.”
Good. Steve kept his focus on the battle at hand, trying to make sure that everything would be fine. After all, his team was everything to him. His mind was in four different places—thank God Bruce was able to stay at the tower, since the Hulk wouldn't do well on a plane—as he tried to keep an eye on Iron Man, Bucky, the Hydra agents he was fighting off, and make sure that no one tried to hurt Clint and Natasha.
A knock at the door broke Tony out of his concentration. He looked over to see Bucky standing there.
Now he didn't need to worry about it anymore. How did Steve always know the exact thing that he needed to hear?
He thought that he was perhaps... eighty-something, maybe, and Steve? Well, it was pretty impossible to tell with Steve, being a super-soldier and all, but if he wasn't a super-soldier... That wasn't a fair question either, because he still had muscles—not the same ones he had in his prime, but still! He looked like a very fit eighty-something year old man, far more fit than Tony felt. He couldn't
. Knowing that by him rejecting Bucky was making it harder for him to be a part of the team, it hurt a little.
"Long night?" Bucky asked, taking a seat beside him. He patted Tony's back and chuckled when Tony groaned. "I'll grab you some coffee."
"I doubt anything's going to happen, but we can do that," Steve assured him. "When's the last time you lost control?"
What kind of human being would he be to destroy the goodness in Captain America? There were already a lot of angry journalists that had found out about it, seeing by the number of alerts that had been appearing on his phone. Poor Steve would have to deal with some bed press too, but at least people would think that he was forcing the man to do this.
“It is a pleasure to meet you both. Arnie has told me a great deal about your talents, Steve. I hope we are able to speak further, and perhaps sometime you would be willing to bring a sampling of your work for us to view?”
“I’m not an expert, but I’ve learned about the February House recently. And I have been watching a fair few movies recently,” Tony mused as she nodded. His phone pinged with a text notification, and he ignored it for the moment.
I do my best to stay as positive as I can. But the very air seems changed ever since December. With the rationing starting and the draft and everything, people are scared. It is not even a specific fear - like when I get sick and am scared it will finally kill me - but instead a broad, nameless anxiety. It feels like everyone is choking on it, just trying to get a breath of fresh air somewhere in the chaos of it all. At least if it were something specific or concrete, people would know how to fight back. That is what we New Yorkers do best, after all. But since it is so difficult to pin down, everyone is just… angry and anxious. Been hearing a lot more screaming matches in the tenement. Seen more fights. Gotten in more fights.
The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.
"My dad was like that too sweetheart. Damnit. Not Sweetheart too personal Tony. Augh. Not that personal you called ‘sweethearts’ your sweetheart. Strike that out Friday. "
“That sounds like boy troubles if I ever heard it,” Michael commented lightly. “Things still not peachy with your engineer?”
Steve frowned and glanced over at the omega. “They were going to draft you? You must be quite the genius. Usually, omegas get an automatic F4.” He began a circuit of the grounds at a slow, steady pace.
Once the pill had dissolved, Ty leaned back in his seat and gave the brunet a lazy grin. “Thanks, sweetness.” His hand dropped to Tony’s lap - lightly tracing the inside seam of his pants. He then turned to share a pill and spit with the woman on his other side, his grip on Tony tightening further.
On one side, a tree bore an inscription that appeared to read “il mio tesoro.” The right side featured a tree in much worse repair, but he could just make out a heart that contained the initials “SGR + .” The second set of initials had been obscured by time, but Tony knew to the very marrow of his bones that it had probably once read “EK.” Steve had literally painted one of his favourite daydreams on the side of a building, loudly declaring his love for another man. It was only the cleverness of the artist (and his slight figure) that had kept him from being caught.
When he woke the next morning, the sun was streaming weakly through the window. His eyes were crusted thickly, and tear tracks had dried over on his cheeks. Sometimes he just felt the keen ache of loneliness so intensely that it seemed to gnaw away at the strings of his heart, threatening to break it.
Tony initially had the impulse to get a bottle and leave it at the table but he didn’t. They ate and Tony could feel himself further settle down. He didn’t want to have any kind of breakdown in front of them. They didn’t need to see him break down further than Serena had earlier.
“I will. I’ve been a stubborn brat that didn’t know how to keep out of things since I can remember,” Tony let out a derisive snort then smiled a little. “Did you have a huge growth spurt or something? Bucky sometimes seems to look for you about a head shorter than you are.” Tony asked, seeing that a couple of times already. Which, knowing what he does, makes sense. The poor Sargent has years of looking down out of habit to recondition himself out of. But it seemed like the quickest way to a point he was hoping it would lead to.
You are banned from movie picking. Banned. Banned banned. I did not need those emotions in the middle of a movie theatre. There were a lot of them. I don’t claim to be super knowledgeable about children but there are things that went through my head.
You with a time machine sure would be dangerous. I can only imagine you jumping from century to century, just chasing that next discovery. Somehow I bet your mind gets you into a lot of mischief, especially with your imagination. You bored must be an absolute nightmare. What do your friends do to keep that wicked intellect of yours occupied?
… I also have the feeling my eyebrows are a lost cause. You might have better luck with trying to fix my jaw some more instead.
Tony sat at the head of the table in one of the boardrooms of Stark Industries, tapping at the tabletop with a pen.  He was waiting for the meeting to start and hadn’t brought any of the desk toys from Pepper because he needed to seem professional in front of the board. All he’d allowed himself earlier was to snap a pic of the letter he got from Grant; reading it again seemed as good an option as any to stave off the dark turn of his thoughts. With Grant’s words fresh in his mind again, Tony pulled out his phone and started typing up a reply.
And family… Well, that is complicated stuff. I am real sorry that your folks were not the best, especially your father. He sounds like he needed to be caught less on the past and focus on the present. If nothing else, being sick has taught me to treasure each moment I get. Doctors thought I would not make it to adulthood, and I sure had a lot of close scares. So I am grateful for each moment I get. Makes me fight harder to keep going, I think.
Setting the drawing aside, Steve smiled to himself. He would have to work on the letter when he got home. For the time being, he had promised Arnie they could go out, and they were headed someplace a bit different than normal. The redhead had met some new friends, better ones he claimed, that had invited him to what they were calling February House – something of an artists commune. There were writers, performers, and artists living there; it seemed like a good place for Steve to work on his resolution for the new year.
“Well, fuck me sideways with a telephone pole,” the man answered in English with sharp staccato that Steve had only heard in California. He held a metal stick that might have been a spoke from the bedframe like a knife one end had been flattened in such a way as it must have been what he used to unscrew parts of the bed frame. The omega cleared his throat before he switched to French “
“You’ve mentioned that he gets his ass kicked a lot. It doesn’t sound like he knows how to fight very well. We could teach him a bit. I think it’d be fun to make a vintage-looking fight handbook or something. Just don’t make me wear a dress; I would split the side seams so bad,” Maria said - almost blandly.
A warm chuckle slid past Arnie’s lips. “Just means sometime you’ll have to do a painting of me and Michael together. We can pose for you and everything.”
“Guess it’s my turn,” Rhodey griped. “No laughing at the wrapping paper, you hooligan. Or else I’m taking my gift back.”
If I get bored enough, I might send you a sketch of Pendragon and Mark’s portrait. Usually, for that kind of piece I end up doing a bunch of sketches, just so the client can pick the version they like best. The nice thing is, I have a good enough memory that I can hold onto the details without whoever I am painting having to sit the whole session. Means Pendragon will not start whining about his legs being tired or something.
But Grant, honey, nothing is wrong with you. I was taught things like body language and posturing at a young age. There are people that pick things up like that really young, affecting confidence all of that. It takes practice, honesty, and knowing how to project welcoming and receptive body language. It’s a skill that can be learned. And people notice how people take care of themselves. Franklin and Pendragon sound like they’ve practiced a lot. You’ve just been putting your energy into other things, like your art.
Hopefully, the next chapter won't be as long of a wait. But I can't guarantee anything. While this one is a short four pages the next chapter is at 16 pages so far with areas that still need expanding.
“He already knows you’re butch as hell. Thinks you and Pepper should try dating. Remember he saw the Shakespeare night pics,” Tony added as Maria shifted her weight. She was standing very still like she was holding her ground.
Slowly, Bucky peeled back his hands and glared at the blond. “Next time,” he groused, “I pick the movie.
She learned it through a friend and is making sure I can hold my own should Obie try to send someone after me. Her name is Maria Hill, and she is kicking my ass.  So, in regards to that, I am happy.
"That's fine," Tony waved as he went down to the garage.  He grabbed the letter and sat on his usual chair. Tony sighed, looking at the spelling and back at the sloppy lettering on the front. Grant wrote this smashed, and Franklin still sent it. If it was intentional he would have to commend Franklin for making sure Grant survived.
I really wish I could just fire him, but it’s a board of directors. I would need to provide a reason besides I DON’T LIKE HIM. Because he’s been on the board for years and just wheedling his way into more power. I can’t just barge in his office and steal files that way. That would be so stupid and dangerous. If I could fake my death that would be great, but it would not be responsible because he’d run roughshod over everything and it would be really hard to get back in my control.
“So you’re saying it would be a standard press date, and then just an actual stay in date with optional sex. If it goes like you said it would, would it be okay if I scheduled that after a shoot? Sounds like it could be relaxing.”
Tony read over it, hoping through some miracle maybe Grant would read it. The engineer then grabbed a sheet of paper from Ana’s kit and the Conklin pen from its case. He struggled to focus on the pressure of the writing, but as he copied the text to the fresh sheet his handwriting did look good. Not quite the lovely work Grant’s writing was, but Tony liked it. Looking at the clock, Tony figured he had time for the ink to dry and send the letter to the address from the first message. And maybe go to the club. Give him something to do. On a whim, he put the sealed letter into the box and left.
A tiny sliver of a smirk caught itself on George’s lips. “All I did was see some talent and try to hold onto it for myself. Nothing to thank me for.”
Sitting in the windowsill, the artist pulled his blankets more snugly around his shoulders. Sure, he was wearing enough layers he should be fine, but with his frustratingly delicate health it never hurt to be too careful. Plus, the shorter days did something awful to Steve’s mind, drawing shadows around his thoughts. It was in one such slump that he decided to write to Edward. Perhaps the promise of a letter would keep him from fixating on a date looming large in the coming weeks.
Is it wrong that I am glad my dad was gone so I could have Jarvis raise me? Jarvis and his wife were so good. I think of Jarvis as twice the father my own blood was. I think that might be the surprise since everyone else thinks my grandfather and dad hung the moon, but I think of them as failures as parents.
Tony read the note quickly double-taking as he looked at both the message and what was apparently multiple pieces of art all rolled carefully. Multiple pictures of Grant done by his friend. The engineer thought he was getting one, but there were
Arriving home on the second of July gave Tony time to write his letter. And the time to send it on the third. Tony grinned, looking over at his gifts again.  He was so excited for his boy to get them. And then he got distracted, staring at even more irrevocable proof it was Steve Rogers sending him birthday gifts as he looked at the photos tucked in the wallet: The devastatingly cute glance over the flowers, and the more candid shot where Tony could almost see the staring from him holding still.
A hundred kisses sure sounds like a lot. At your current rate, we are just going to have to spend a couple of years just stealing all the kisses we can. First thing in the morning, just when we are waking up for the day. Over breakfast, every time you ask me to pass you something. Lunch, too, while one of us is cooking. Snuggled up together in one of your fancy bathtubs. I would have to keep time by kisses instead of hours on a clock.
As he meandered along the boardwalk, Steve noticed something that caught his attention: a flower cart. The start of an idea worked its way into his head as he drifted closer. Going over, he purchased a bouquet of red and white flowers - cheerfully noting that there were no hydrangea in sight. He then carried it with him as he walked, carefully cradled in his arms. About halfway down the boardwalk, a young man with a camera stopped him. “Can I take your picture?” he asked, smiling crookedly.
In August, Steve finally had good news to write the brunet about. He rushed into his apartment and immediately set to work, trying to keep his hands from trembling with excitement.
Tony rewrote the letter quickly trying not to think of how he’d imagined that Grant had been the one with him last night. It was hitting things that felt too close to cheating for him to be comfortable. He sent the letter and worked on how to bring up at least talking to Ty about why he wasn’t happy. Grab some flowers or something, a new tie clip.
“What, you gonna have a beef with ‘em because they set you up with some dandy? Even high-hats must feel the way you do.” Bucky shrugged. “Would also explain why he couldn’t just go to the clubs. More chances of running wrong of the cops.”
Serena’s eyes got caught on the volleyball player’s long, long legs before catching on the book she was reading. “Oh, I love that book! Agent Carter was so well researched.” Ducking her head, she played with one of the pins on her bag that read “Sapphic Babe.” “Um. I wouldn’t mind going. Especially to see the mural.” And if she was blushing, at least the beautiful sienna tone of her skin helped hide it.
She nearly tripped. “Seriously?” Catching herself, she stopped ogling at him in order to keep walking. “Those kinds of records would be absolutely invaluable to our study of these murals. The only record we have of him is that his name was S. Rogers and what dates each painting was begun and completed.”
People are going to keep assigning bullshit about work and gender and keep shovelling it to kingdom come. It’ll get better. I have to think that, you know?
“Yeah, I think you’re right,” Buck agreed. “Hey, Dernier, you want to start searching through supplies? Everyone looks like they could use some blankets, maybe some clothes, and food.”
Arnie knew that the fall was going to be rough for Steve, which by extension meant that Michael knew now as well. His friends knew that the blond was likely to go quiet during the month, hiding away with his grief. Hating to see him so morose, the pair decided they would do what they could to distract their friend from the coming month. So, one evening, the redhead and his partner invited Steve to go with them to one of the local clubs. Not for the intention of picking someone up - a first for Arnie - but simply to enjoy the performances of the drag queens. Bucky was far more comfortable letting Steve go with them (he was such a mother hen sometimes) because Michael had toned down most of Arnie’s partying ways since he disapproved of doing drugs and drank only in moderation.
Steve chuckled easily. “Yeah. Even the light shades were me. The owners liked my work on another mural enough that they asked me to do the bar instead of just the spot in the lobby they’d originally intended. Actually, if you look at it, you can find me, Bucky, plus my friend Arnie, and his mate Michael.”
This chapter Bucky and Steve work at a factory at the tail end of the Radium Girls tragedy. Tony suspects as much which is why he suggests Steve leave the factory building whenever he can on breaks.
My birthday is July 4th. Franklin likes to tease me that the entire nation is celebrating my birthday. Back when I was a kid, I believed him. Told the other kids in the neighborhood all about how special I was. You can imagine how I took it when they told me that it was the nation’s birthday and not mine that was being celebrated. I ended up trying to fight twenty-four kids all by myself. It did not go well.
The buzz of life that came with spring in the city drew a smile to Steve’s lips. Birds chittered at each other, and children yelled in delight as they played a game of chase. All of the trees had erupted with a beautiful mix of blossoms and leaves, painting the clear blue sky with splashes of colour. It was a relief, after the harshness of the winter, to see signs that life persevered. Coming up to his favourite bench, Steve collapsed on it with a little sigh. He gazed out over the plaza, admiring the way the light played across the water of the Pulitzer Fountain. When he had been a kid, Central Park had been an absolute disaster. A large shantytown had cropped up at one end of the green, and one of the meadows had been completely overrun by sheep. Monuments had been vandalized, benches broken, and weeds run rampant. Robert Moses sure had done a bang-up job in revitalizing the gardens and cleaning everything up. Now it was a beautiful place, though very much a work in progress as several parts of the park were still under construction.
“Yeah. Yeah,” Tony repeated as he unlocked himself. He shifted his weight from one side to the other before walking around the island. Whether it was because Jarvis just knew him that well or if it was because Tony was telegraphing something, it was just what he was looking for when Jarvis pulled him in for a hug.
First off, I love your robot.  Jarvis would adore a tea buddy and I love how you draw me. See you called me angel face with an expression like that?
I uh, I have some mixed feelings right now. The actress was phenomenal and I’m….shaken. The guy’s actions and wording felt so familiar. His attitude. I am reminded of Obie and that worries me.
“I’ll ask next time he’s in - maybe he knows someone too,” Tony nodded, at least starting to form a plan.
“And now it’s yours. She knew how you loved watching her write. There are instructions in there for refilling the ink, though I know you watched her avidly. There are also instructions for ordering similar papers to what she has. She would have wanted you to have this. I have no use for it,” Jarvis said softly, fondly if Tony was being really honest. Tony opened the case to look at the pen: vintage green and black spattering in a beautiful pattern that led to the sturdy nib.
But it was a hollow sort of pleasure that had quickly burned out of his system. Because, in the cold morning light, the people were always less beautiful than they had been the night before and the easiness of the booze had burned out of his system. The emptiness of his life always left him feeling unsteady, like he was a sailor coming back to land for the first time in months.
Tony watched that for a moment and thought of winding a finger around one of the curls at the base of Ty’s neck. Tony shrugged after a moment "Whiskey sours all around then?" Tony asked, looking at each person at the table, offering a small smile as he checked for confirmation.
As they were getting ready to leave, the smaller man hesitated before looking at his friends. “What if … Eddie wants something I couldn’t give him?” he asked, his voice unusually small.
“Nah. We’ll get one of those posh portraits. Like folks do when they get hitched. We can hang it in our bedroom someday.” Arnie and Michael shared a quiet smile at that, and it made Steve’s heart ache for them. Even if the pair were to live together, all anyone would ever see them as was unusual roommates and irresponsible bachelors. But that would have to be enough for them, for the time being. “But we will get out of your hair. Figure you might want to get those in the mail sooner rather than later.”
Even if you could send a record, I would not be able to listen to it. Franklin’s family has a radio, but that is about the only device we have. Well, maybe Pendragon or one of his friends would have a record player. So, I suppose I would find a way. I bet you are the type to have a lot of records that you listen to. You seem the sort that would listen to lots of music, dancing around in your garage.
Moving to stand beside him, Lee lightly ruffled his hair. “Oh, Stevie. With your lungs, you really could, though. Come on. Let us put you up for the night. It would make me feel better.”
No one was home except Tony who was down in the lab trying to build some new remote for the television because Steve had broken the normal one. Again. He arranged himself on the couch so that when Steve walked through the front door he would be able to see Clint sitting their looking upset. He waited exactly five minutes and eight seconds until the door opened and he could hear Steve's boots against the floor.
Virginia Potts was always prepared for every situation. Which is why as soon as Tony ran through the hospital doors she had pulled out a small orange bottle of pills and immediately emptied four into her hand.
Clint was almost certain that if it wasn’t for his random kicks when he was grumpy that he couldn’t actually use his legs. Tony and Steve had been at a SHIELD meeting with Fury, Bruce was in the middle of a break through and Thor was off with Jane. Peter had been lying on his interactive mat that Tony had made for him.
If Tony’s being honest, which he rarely is, Jane isn’t the only reason he agrees to take Thor. When they get to S.H.E.I.L.D Thor and Jane run off to her lab to reunite and any ruse of science talk that Tony had been holding onto is gone. He wanders down the halls, coming to a stop outside the gym where he can hear the all too familiar sound of Steve’s grunts. Tony pushes the door open just a little, peaking through the crack, watching the muscles ripple through Steve’s body as he slams his unprotected fists into a punching bag. With a heavy grunt the bag snaps off of its chain and flies into the wall, splitting open.
“The acidic arrows that no one wanted you to have, fifteen kilos of Plutonium that I was told I wouldn’t get even if I would save the world, two pints of the second most expensive vodka in the world and now puppy purses?”
“No…I’m just not blinking, I would hate to miss any of this.” she replied, eyes drifting back to Peter who was giggling and drooling and walking towards her faster and faster. She crouched down to her knees and held out her arms, Peter took three more steps and then fell forward into her warm embrace as she picked him up with a wide smile and spun him around.
Peter had though. He had cried and let go of the handlebars, dropping his weight onto the cold mat and sobbed as Steve held him, rocking him, whispering soothing nothings. Steve had always been that parent. The one that knew what to do, that would heal a cut knee, sprained ankle, find a lost toy and fix the tears.
Tony isn’t one to frequent the halls of S.H.E.L.D, but Thor had wanted to see Jane and Tony wanted to see Jane because aside from Bruce she was his favourite person to talk science with, so he agreed to drive them both there.
“That was…admirable?” Tony chuckles, he steps further into the room so he can lean against the wall, Steve shifts just a little, his shirt is so tight it could be painted on, could no one in this building get the man clothes that fit him?
“Are you ok?” Sharon asks, clearly taken aback from his outburst. Pepper smiles but her eyes ask him questions he doesn’t want to answer.
“I almost didn’t the first time, I was a little surprised, nearly burnt my eye brow off. Then I just…I don’t know I guess I thought if I kept answering you’d eventually say something.”
He takes another steadying breath, wondering if Tony managed to blow up the source of the bots without injuring himself, time seems to pass too slowly. Steve tries to count to thirty, feeling like an hour has passed when it’s been less that fifteen seconds. He takes off his cowl, runs his hands through his hair, crouched low to the floor, still feeling the roof of his foam cage on his head. Steve reaches his arm out, his fingers, which had before only just been able to brush the wall now pressed against it. Dread twists in his gut, we was going to be crushed to death by foam, slowly feeling it squeeze the life out of him.
Two weeks later when he found himself staring at Steve in the gym like he was a shiny new toy wrapped up with a bow he knew she was right.
“Peter! Son of Tony and Steve. I am treasure hunting for the pop tarts. It seems that Tony has once again hid them from me in fear of me eating them all.” Peter laughed and wheeled over to the island in the middle of the kitchen.
“You can’t think of anything?” Clint actually didn’t even know how she knew! His bets were on Tony though.
” Steve swallows uncomfortably around the word, Tony leans in just the slightest, hear radiates off of Steve’s skin.
“Steve” Tony takes a moment to register that, yes, Steve is still here, and that’s all the incentive he needs to press their lips together. It was a long glorious moment of pure passion, Steve’s mouth parted under his and their tongues danced together. Tony’s hand on Steve’s jaw slid to around his neck, pulling him deeper as heat surged through his body, clenching tightly in his gut, sending shivers in small ripples across his skin. Steve kisses him back, he doesn’t imagine the way his lips dance with his, the small sound of want that comes from the back or Steve’s throat. Finally,
“I know, breathe, just breathe Tony.” she told him calmly, placing the pills in her hand into his which he swallowed immediately, taking deep, ragged breaths.
“We both know I’m not here to talk about the weather Steve.” Pepper watches him as he places the glass in front of her and slowly takes the seat across from her
“No! Tony let me go, stop this just stop! Go back to your fortress of solitude and leave me to look after our son.” Peter was sure that his pop hadn’t meant the words to come out so harshly, but they did and he could almost see his dad’s fallen expression, the hurt in his eyes before footsteps echoed down the hall and he could here his pop cry outside his door.
“I can’t live with myself if I let you carry that monstrosity around for a moment longer.” Tony snatched up the phone and turned to leave.
“Hey there big guy. I think we’ve already talked about how you shouldn’t eaves drop on people’s conversation.” He tried to sound like he was mad. Really he did. He tried so hard but the Hulk snorted and let out a small growl.
He closes his eyes, tries to breathe, sees Tony sitting crumpled on the floor, fingers sticky with blood. Blood Steve had put there.
Natasha’s weekly calls become more frequent, even though Steve still lets them ring out, ignoring the messages she leaves, terrified she’ll know what he did and demand his own blood in return.
When Peter was eight Thor found him crying in the cupboard. At first he had overlooked him, in desperate need for the pop tarts that Tony had hidden away. However when his eyes fell on the small boy Thor frowned and crouched down.
There’s a smear of oil on his jaw from Tony’s touch, his lips are still stinging from the feel of Tony’s against his.
“Should we get more wine?” She asks after they finish the first bottle, her cheeks are flushed pink and Steve wonders if it even matters. There’s not enough wine in this place to get him drunk, and even if there was he wasn’t getting into bed with her. He scolded himself at the thought.
“Peter you have returned! Father Stark is building legs.” Thor declares and Peter rolls his eyes because sometimes his uncle Thor can just not know what he’s talking about.
"Hey Clint, is every one else out? I just abou- are you ok?" Steve asked, walking into the living room with genuine worry on his face. Clint worked on keeping his face empty and sad and tried really hard not to laugh as Steve sat next to him.
Regardless, Clint was not going to accept that as a reason for why he could not get those arrows. It’s not like he was going to end the world with them. Quite the opposite in fact, he was going to save the world from evil forces that just liked to pop up and try and make everyone fear their impending doom. And besides, it wasn’t as if he was asking for plutonium like Stark was.
a) Hand him a naked Steve on a platter which was not going to work because Steve wasn’t going to agree to just lay on a platter and be carried into a Tony’s room whilst letting his American Jewels hang free. So that left option b) Get Tony the Plutonium.
Tony closed the distance between them by reaching forward and trailing his fingers along Steve’s jaw in a feather-light touch. Steve stared at him intensely, breath stuttering out of his parted lips, leaning forward just the slightest.
Peter was almost at the kitchen when he heard the scurrying and sounds of pots and pans crashing. He almost screamed for his dad before he heard the familiar groan of Thor and a few Asgardian swear words such as ‘Curse the frost giant toe’ ‘Frost giant sandwich’ and ’nose of a green frost giant’ just to name a few. Smiling fondly he wheeled himself into the kitchen where Thor had his head stuck in the cupboard under the sink.
“Iron Man on your right!” Steve screamed across the coms, it was too late though. A headless roach soars towards him, wings twitching, and smacks into him, sending him flying into a building. He tries to gain control of his thrusters but the bug is
Despite his absence, he and the team still fought in a beautiful dance of crumbling buildings and exploding fire hydrants. Natasha - who was looking like she wanted to kill him more than the twenty robots buzzing around them, dropping bombs full of sticky glue and hardening foam – leaps off of one of the bots, it’s head in her hands, and flips next to Steve.
“When I’m tall I’m going to marry Tommy Winkle.” He said determinedly, his mother’s hand slipped on the antiseptic, the bottle falling to the floor.
When he dropped Steve at his door he pulled out a butterscotch and turned on his heel with a wink. Steve was smiling so wide his face hurt when he stepped inside, the candy slipped into his pocket.
“Captain.” Tony replied. Steve doesn’t move, he tries desperately to just take a step back and then another so he can keep going until he’s as far away from Tony as possible. He can’t though, his feet glued to the ground, still close enough that he can smell Tony, all oil and sweat with an underlying tang of aftershave.
Coulson was his last chance. With a speech ingrained in his mind he knocked on the heavy wooden door four times. Then four more just incase Coulson hadn't heard him.
“We can’t be sure until he wakes but it seems the spinal nerves have been damaged and the disk between L3 and L4 slipped.”
Once his hands were bloody and bruised he would sit with Peter in his room until he fell asleep, do his exercises with him, help him through the painful appointments and rehabilitation sessions. He did his research, changed their diets, gave Peter the independence he needed but always hid just out of sight- ready to come as soon as Peter called for him.
“Hulk keep puppy, puppy is Hulks.” The team collectively sighs, Steve wonders how long they had been debating with Hulk about the puppy before they found his pod. By the resigned looks on everyone’s face he was guessing a while.
“You must share your knowledge of where the beloved food is!” Peter had laughed and pointed to a tin labelled ‘Tea’. The two had eaten pop tarts until Tony emerged from his lab, sighing but smiling any way.
“Who is it?” He thought about telling her, weighed the pros and cons of her knowing and then deciding that she really didn’t need the details, especially when nothing was going to happen anyway. Tony was just waiting this one out, desperate for the next new shiny thing to come along so he could stop getting erections whenever Steve licked a crumb from the corner of his mouth.
“No. You just don’t know the affect you have on people. Really Steve I didn’t meant to use you…just…well…just see if you had a better chance than I did.” Steve shook his head looking like a kicked puppy.
“Do you question the knowledge of Thor son of Odin?” Peter shook his head incredibly fast and then smiled.
“Colonel Fury sir, we are all very sorry for what happened when you were away and understand it was a breach of conduct. I hope that you won’t punish Agent Coulson as it was all my fault for what happened and I wish too take the blame for me team.” Clint hissed as Natasha kicked him under the table. ‘Stop this’ she mouthed and Clint looked at her helplessly. Tony pinched his arm hard because Tony wasn’t going to let his lover boy take the blame was he? That would mean a sulking Cap, which would mean Tony would sulk because the Cap was sulking. As it turned out, Clint didn’t have to take the blame because Fury blinked a few times and then nodded slowly.
“Pe – Ow!” he grabbed his arm where she had pinched him. “If I tell you will you leave me alone…I do have a company to run.” Pepper gave him a look that made it very clear who was actually running the company between the two of them.
”Tony Stop!” Natasha says sternly and he does, again he does. He stops breathing, thinking, the music, his work, he just stops.
I’m from is so different, people courted one another in public, you never went into a dames apartment after a date, and men didn’t…didn’t date other men, it wasn’t proper. There were moments, during the war, but they weren’t anything just…a way to let off steam, and you were kidding yourself if you thought it was going to come up again after.” Steve’s face is serious, his eyes desperate as they stare right into Tony’s. “It’s not an excuse, not for what I did, for how I h-hurt you. I’ll never forgive myself for that, for just leaving you there on the floor when you looked so…I’ve never seen you look at anyone the way you looked at me in that moment.”
"Not really." Clint sad as sadly as he could. Steve didn't reply for a moment as he moved a little closer to Clint.
"That's correct sir." Coulson passed him a bottle of water and Clint smiled appreciatively, washing the taste out of his mouth.
“It was.” Tony doesn’t realise how desperate he was for Steve to look at him until he does, their eyes meet and Steve looks at him warmly.
"Knock one more time Barton and I'll give you a years worth of paperwork to file." Coulson said as the door opened. He stood there firmly, shorter than Clint but watching him with skeptical eyes. His suit was immaculate- as if he hadn't just helped stop doombots from once again taking over New York City.
“It’s a…a…tear uncle Thor…I’m…I’m Crying.” Peter had hiccupped, not looking up from his knees as he did so.
Tony had been hard at work with Jane and Bruce by his side. In a matter of hours Stark tower had been turned into the most wheelchair friendly building in the world. Peter would be coming home within the hour, being discharged three weeks after Harry who had dutifully sat at his best friend’s bedside as soon as he could. Harry, despite fractured arm and shattered cheekbone was fine, and everyone could tell that it killed him.
“What did that bag ever do to you?” he asks, pushing the door wider. Steve doesn’t tense at his words, but he does straighten and turn around a little too fast, his footing messy.
Form after form he had filed in- writing what the arrows were like, the size, feather count, angle of the tip- everything that he would need so that S.H.I.E.L.D weapons could make them. But everyone had said no.
“Does my near-death experience not mean anything to you?” He tries for flirty, not sure if it translates because Tony just smirks at him.
“Shhhhhh Petey, papa’s here.” Steve whispers over and over in the same tone reserved for Peter’s worse nightmares. Peter buries himself into Steve’s chest, smells him, feels him, and remembers what it’s like to be a small boy afraid of the dark. Steve doesn’t let Peter go, even when he stops crying which Peter is grateful for, because he needs this.
“Cwint!” Peter had squealed in excitement, waving his fists with a toothy grin and then taken one small shuffled step towards Clint, then another, then another and then one more just to be safe. Clint stood gobsmacked, his mouth had dropped, his eyes widened and he let out a loud yell. Peter giggled and this time fully lifted his foot from the floor.
He had fallen about a block away from his home, knees and palms scraped and bleeding. He wouldn’t cry, he was tough, but each step home was painful and the red skin around his cuts were already starting to bruise. Tommy lived two doors down from him and when he walked past Steve on his way home from work he crouched down, gave him a big smile and piggy backed him all the way home. Tommy was three years older than him and had two little sisters who ‘cut themselves up like nobody’s business’.
But was he really meant to not tell her that her jeans seemed a little too tight? That's what a good boyfriend did right- tell his girlfriend when she had put on a little bit of weight? Apparently not because she refused to speak to him or sleep in the same room as him and really he was running out of options. So he found Steve on the roof watering a small arrangement of petunias.
“Avengers.” Fury spoke as he walked in all in black- as usual. He looked menacing and dark, his coat swooping behind him like a cape as he came to stand in front of them all.
“Steve you can’t talk like that, it’s not proper do you hear? Boys don’t marry boys and girls don’t marry girls. You don’t ever say anything like that again, not to anyone Steven.” He tried not too flinch at the sharpness of his mother’s words, her fingers pressed deeper into his scrapes and tears pooled in his eyes.
“You better fix this.” She stand standing up and leaving. Thor gave a huff, stomped his foot and turned on his heel following Natasha and leaving Clit alone in the kitchen, no longer hungry for eggs.
“Young Peter! There is leakage in your eyes!” Thor had declared forgetting about the many conversations about using his inside voice around Peter.
“Felt a bit bad for the guy when we won, almost decided to do a best of three thing, But Nat took the coin before anyone had a chance to mess it up.” Steve’s still got a wide grin on his face, shaking his head at Tony like he’s something else entirely.  Tony’s not sure if Steve means to step closer to him but he does, the air comes alive with electricity. “Why do you keep calling me?”
“Steve.” Pepper nods. She makes no move to continue the conversation, just stands at the door with her arms folded, staring at him blankly.
When he looks up into Tony’s surprised eyes he flinches away, not missing the way Tony’s face cracks and then goes entirely empty.
“This is everyone’s home.” Tony says firmly and Steve walks over, wrapping his arms around his waist and leaning his chin on his forehead.
Tony touched his fingers to the back of his head, brought his arm around to stare at the crimson blood on his fingertips.
“No. Why am I always the one who gets blamed first?” He shouted, chucking perhaps a little bit of a hissy fit. But really, this was going to stop now because even if he did do something this time that didn’t mean he had done something the other gazillion times he got the blame.
“Barton just shut up.” Tony hissed and Clint sighed falling back into his chair. If Coulson had of just said yes to those arrows than none of this would be happening and everything would be fine. Pulling out his phone Clint googled ‘How to Make a blog’ because if he was taking the blame for this than the world was going to know that the sewerage incident was Tony’s fault. He was going to get bands and posters and rallies and cool fun slogans and T-Shirts for everyone to wear so the world would know that Tony Stark was the one who caused the big sewer mishap of 2014.
Then he was careening back, thrown with such force he didn’t have time to catch his footing as he fell, head clanging on the corner of his desk before he crumpled to the floor.
So the team had very begrudgingly gone to the sewers to run around like Mutant Turtles and attack each other. Things just got more realistic than they should have and before they could say ‘Toilet’ shit had exploded.
“Number 380. Not all of you can go in there at once.” He starts but Natasha throws him one of her glares and he wisely shuts up, stepping aside so that Steve can help Tony slowly walk towards the room.
Even after hours in the gym there are nights where he lays in his small bed, an anxious hum keeping his awake. If he does fall asleep nightmares grip him, he’s falling into the ice, drowning as cold water pierces his lungs.
Each time Clint tried to explain that it really wasn’t his fault and Tony should be blamed, some S.H.I.E.L.D agent would start yelling about how they were never going to get the smell out of their room or Fury would mutter about how much it cost to have the entire cafeteria redone.
“I’m registering that. I’ve always hated these. Jarvis used to have to bribe me to go and behave with model rockets and jelly beans.” A smile breaks out across Steve’s face at that.
“Can we see him?” Tony asks, springing up from his seat and picking at the skin on his thumb with his forefinger, a nervous habit he never really dropped.
“Okay” Tony breathes, so Steve leans in and kisses him. It’s soft, just a brush of his lips that fills his body with a warmth that had been missing from his life the last month and a half. Tony shifts and then his hand is coming up between them, fisting in Steve’s shirt, pulling him close. Steve feels Tony’s tongue dart out and opens his mouth, breathing him in, one hand still on Tony’s face, the other arm snakes around his waist. Steve’s not sure if there’s so much as a breath between them, but he still tries to pull Tony closer. It’s not enough, especially not when he shifts his hip and feels Tony’s cock pressing against his hip. He gives a slow push against him and smiles when Tony’s lips break the kiss to let out a gasp.
“Bugs are coming” Hawkeye said and Tony made his escape, hovering above the building, watching as four roaches join the one already on the building.
He doesn’t stop by the tower, too stupidly afraid to see Tony, to know the pain he’s caused. Tony might be able to hide his wounds well in a crowded restaurant but not in his home, where his lab hours are a key insight to the workings of Tony Stark.
“Right. Ok” he nods, and then he just goes, walking down the hall way again, his shoes clicking against the floor. He needs to breathe, he needs to sleep and he needs a good drink. But first he needs to find Steve because if he can’t see Peter then he needs to see Steve. Steve is important and right now he knows Steve needs him because he needs Steve.
"I don't want to ask Agent Coulson for anything else because he's already been so good to me. I guess I'll have to survive without them." Steve looked at Clint frowning.
“Tony.” Her expression was soft, fond almost. Pepper had always found his defiance endearing. “You should bring someone, get some photos, show the press you haven’t turned into a monk since we broke up.” It was teasing, he knew it was. Pepper had left him six months ago, and for five months and two weeks he had been jerking off thinking of Steve’s perfect arse, or his hard abs, or the way his voice sounded when he said his name.
Clint re-read it one more time and smiled at himself. He was going to hand deliver this letter to Coulson and watch his expression as he read it. Yes Clint was definitely getting those arrows.
Pepper knocks on his door on a Tuesday. He’s surprised at first, expecting Mrs. Lahey from down the hall needing help with her groceries again.
Natasha Romanov has only ever hugged three people: her mum, Clint and Peter so this is kind of a big deal.
“Pepper came to see me.” That was not what he was expecting, Steve’s eyes flick across his face and he’s sure the surprise is clear. “She, well she said somethings that I needed to hear, things about…me and my
Steve spends all his spare time in the gym; breaking weight after weight, bag after bag, turning the gym into a pile of scrap metal and sand.
“Come on.” Steve wraps an arm around him and eases him up, Tony curses is useless fucking suit that’s stopping him from feeling Steve against him. “What happened to your suit up there?”
“I…I’m…” He stuttered, shocked, scared and somewhat proud. Tony smiled widely, tears falling as he walked over to Peter and hugged him tightly.
She wraps her arms around Tony, rests her chin on his shoulder and when he buries his head into her neck she supports his weight.
“I think that would be best.” Steve regrets the decision, picturing all the things in his house she can use to maim him. Pepper comes in and heads straight to the small table in the kitchen, sitting on a rusted fold out chair, placing her bag on the floor next to her.
“Coming, coming…your home!” he said happily, stepping into the hallway. Peter didn’t smile like he usually did when his dad showed up, covered in oil and smelling of sweat.
“I...I didn't know where to start .” Steve’s hand twitches at his side, Tony wants to reach out and feel it on his face, he can’t though, won’t, terrified to push the boundaries between them again.
Steve was in the gym when Clint finally found him. The sweat on his back showed that he had been there for a while and the various broken punching bags broken- sand scattering the wooden floor, indicated obvious frustration. He held his breath and walked in as quietly as he could while Steve pounded another one of the bags with brutal force. With a final hit it swung from it’s chain, flying across the room and spilling sand at a rapid rate as it did.
Once she tries to corner him at S.H.E.I.L.D with a fierce determination on her face, luckily Fury needs him to sign some paperwork and Steve has never been so happy to be locked in a room with a flickering light and creaky chair.
“I…” Tony stared up at Steve’s twisted face, he watched one shaking twitch, as though Steve was about to reach out to him.
But Tony Stark was someone who was just plain bitchy when he couldn’t finish a project. And that said project needed 15 kilos of plutonium that Coulson was not going to let him have. So really the only way to stop him from sulking around was to either:
“I’m going to make this quick. I have no idea what you have done to Agent Coulson or how you got him to agree to purchasing these things. So I will give you five minutes to sort out your stories and tell me exactly what’s GOIN ON.” The Avengers all sat in the conference room awkwardly. Clint was reminded of the time he and Barney had let out the horses at the circus and been scolded. Looking up from his lap he saw Tony, Natasha and Bruce glaring at him while Steve looked at the table miserably and Thor was- Clint blinked…was Thor actually crying?
“Hulks coming, just…” Steve is obviously searching for something to say that isn’t ‘hold on’ or ‘hang tight’. The spinning and jerking stops, and for one sweet moment Tony feels relief, until he suddenly realises he’s falling 20 floors and is still 30 seconds away from firing up his blasters.
“Tony?” he hears, blinking away the black spots floating in his vision. Steve leans over him, cowl pulled off as he stares down worried.
“So he’s at your beck and call?” Definitely dangerous territory, Tony did not look impressed at all that Clint seemed to be talking to Steve and getting him to do favors. Once this was over maybe Clint could get Tony to stay here and send in Steve.
"Clint. Can I help you with anything?" Clint shrugged-yes- and sat on the ledge of the roof, feet dangling above the ground far below.
“Darcy and Happy have gone to get everyone Coffee, they just took Peter into the operating room, we’re in for a long wait before we can see him.” Natasha said, her blank face doing nothing to hide the choke in voice.
Steve hated hearing about him more than Tony, he suspected that it had something to do with him finding out that the Howard who had made him who he is wasn’t the Howard he thought he was.
She would come over during days he was home and play slow games of scrabble with him, watch Jeopardy, laugh at his bad jokes that he knew were bad because Tony always told him they were, and even brings him a casserole that he can freeze.
“Yeah, it smells great.” He manages, hating the awkward set to his shoulders that he can’t seem to shake. Despite the room around him he can’t help but feel like everything is wrong. Where Sharon coos at old couples Tony would make up ridiculous stories about scandalous lives full of affairs and murders. She laughs at each joke Steve tells, even the ones he doesn’t find funny himself.
“Honestly?” Peter doesn’t even grace this with a response, instead he rolls his eyes and Bruce gives him a small smile, placing a hand on his shoulder.
He had fascinations, obsessions, something similar to a child with a new toy. They played with it, fell asleep with it, kept it tucked safely in their back pack. Then one day another toy, a toy that’s shiny and new, comes along and their attention shifts, their obsession starts all over and the old toy is forgotten, locked away in a chest with all the rest.
Natasha had made it very clear she wasn’t wearing one, Clint had decided he would have to use it for at leas a day. Tony had just snorted. Thor and Steve took them everywhere- the shops, the movies, dinner, for runs, Thor even wore his on a date with Jane who just looked at him for ten minutes before sighing and sitting down.
“You’re sorely mistaken if you think I’m going to let you start eating my pop tarts again.” Tony says, eyes flicking up to him. Steve laughs, throws his towel over his shoulder.
“Its just…Tony’s mad at me.” Dear God those two needed to be locked in a room together. Clint was going to make sure of it because really this was getting ridiculous.
The building shook around him as another giant cockroach slammed into it, letting out a roar and seriously, since when did cockroaches roar?
“Maybe you don’t, but they do.” Peter looks at Bruce who is staring over the lake, not even moving his eyes to look at him.
“I don’t need sleep Tony- serum remember? I need to see my son, now if you’ll just” There was a grunt, a bit of banging, a hiss and then a loud groan. Peter sighed, and tried to cover his ears with his pillow like he had when he was a child. But he couldn’t ignore it, the cry of anguish outside his door, the yelling, the arguing, the pain of his fathers words.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He lied. Tony chuckled and began listing things off of his fingers.
“Don’t ever do that again.” Then Steve’s gone, so fast Tony doesn’t have time to blink away the tears burning his eyes.
“Peter, where’s Peter? I need to see him…has someone...” he choked out, his head a blurry haze as he tried to collect his thoughts. Once again, his eyes landed on the large group of people gathering around him.
“I didn’t mean to bother you…I…I’m glad you’re alright Tony.” And by god Steve’s earnest. Tony thinks for a moment Steve will leave, but he just stays standing there, staring at Tony with a look that makes his blood boil. He takes a step forward, lessening the distance between them.
"Because I want the acidic ones from Spain." Steve took in a sharp breath. He probably didn't think Clint should have arrows either. It was all Tony's fault. Bloody sewers, he would never ever go and play any sort of game in them again. He didn't care how much fund it was going to be.
“Yeah. But if he had it I don’t think he’d be so unhappy anymore- he might even take you to that burger joint you keep talking about.” Steve definitely perked up at that and gave a small smile.
They were sitting at a bench when the conversation came up. Well Bruce was on the Bench, Peter next to him. Peter liked being around Bruce a lot of the time. He was silent; he didn’t stare at him like he was weird, or with sympathy or concern. He acted normal. Peter was certain that Bruce spent half the time not even realising he was in a wheel chair.
“It’s hard, for all of us it’s hard. What’s the point of having super powers if we can’t use them to save the ones we love?”
Of course, this didn’t really surprise anyone. His loud booming voice, giant hammer and strange Asgardian ways weren’t exactly child friendly. The man couldn’t understand why the small boy cried whenever he entered the room.
“I don’t think so.” Both boys stood in the kitchen frowning, trying to work out exactly how to explain football and how to understand it.
“So he doesn’t know that you’re using him to play on Coulson’s Captain America obsession to get things?”
"Fine." he sighs standing up and dragging his feet from the room. Coulson doesn't even laugh at his dropped shoulders, fallen head and slow walk. He just sits there impassive and reminds Clint to shut the door behind him.
Personally, Clint had no idea why the kid was basically drooling over a giant iPad (of course he would never call it an iPad because everyone knew how Tony felt about apple) but he had learnt not to question Tony and his parenting skills. He had just gotten his fourth gutter ball when Peter gave a small gurgle of ‘Papa!’ pointing at the screen he was laying on where Steve was marching around to ‘Star Spangled Man with a plan.’
“Mr. Stark, during the operation we noticed some serious swelling on the L2 through to L5 vertebrae.”
Steve and Tony sit in silence amongst the others as the two women answer the questions thoroughly and precisely. Has he broken bones before. Allergies. Past operations. Age. Side effects of any past injuries. Blood type. Things that never really seem important but suddenly are.
That’s a silly thought though because his dad is Iron man and probably has some sort of levitating device to do that for him. Peter almost smiles at the situation they’re in and then remembers why he’s in the situation in the first place. He all but frowns at his dad who is sleeping soundly, a hand over Steve’s that is resting above Peter’s head. When Peter tries to move and Tony’s eyes shoot open they both stare at one another awkwardly, silence falling over them.
And there was only one way to get Tony the Plutonium. Turns out Clint didn’t even need to be the one pouting.
“How’s life at headquarters?” Pepper asks and Sharon gushes into a tale about Coulson, Hill, Sitwell, a four-night stake out and two bottles of tequila. Tony laughs at the right moment, nods along, and even throws in a few Tonyesque quips.
“Steve wait!” Tony called standing up and running after him. Clint let out a long sigh and looked at Thor and Natasha.
“I can survive this.” He says sternly and Bruce looks back over the lake, his hand squeezing Peter’s shoulder before placing it back in his lap.
“Coulson.” Clint corrected and then scolded himself. Arguing with the Hulk was not a good idea. The Hulk looked at him unimpressed.
“yeah great just, yeah um…excuse me.” He nods at Tony, grateful when he slides out of the booth so he can make a quick escape.
“Tony” Steve goes to touch him, he really does, his hand reaches out to grab the belt loops of his jeans and pull him close.
“Of course Captain. I suppose I can let it slip just this once.” And then he promptly left the room. Everyone stared after him in shock and Clint allowed himself a small smirk.
“Mind if I join you?” Tony is standing in the exit, walking towards him, three steps away, again so close but so far.
When Clint was coming out of the practice room after a team session Tony had stopped him, grabbed him by the elbow and locked them into a cupboard. Clint found it slightly ironic that he finally had Tony locked in a cupboard- just with himself instead of Captain America. Tony stared at him calculatingly, arms crossed and foot tapping. He was still in the armor, which was far more intimidating than he really wanted to admit.
“oh hey isn’t that – Tony!” Steve knows what it’s like to be frozen while time moves around you, he’s never experienced the opposite. Everything slows down around him, Sharon’s hand waving over his shoulder, the couple next to him laughing, a woman knocking over her glass. He turns in his seat and feels the all too familiar feeling of bile rising in his throat. Tony stands two tables away with Pepper, he looks gorgeous. Dressed in dark denim jeans that hug his legs and a button up that’s maybe just a little too tight. His hair is wild despite the evident attempts to tame it.
“Of course not.” He supplies, gesturing weekly to the spaces next to them. Tony slides in next to him and at first, he’s thankful that he doesn’t have to look straight at him every time he lifts his head from the table.  Tony sits a safe distance away, enough room that not a single part of him is touching Steve.
Tony flips them around, capturing Steve between him and the kitchen bench, scrambling closer. Gently Steve bites on Tony’s bottom lip before sucking it into another long kiss. His entire body shakes with a want he never thought he could fill. Tony fits against him in all the right ways, he’s warm and soft, firm in his touches, gentle in his kisses. When Steve lets a hand wander from Tony’s waist to his arse Tony chuckles into his mouth and Steve pulls him close, turning that chuckle into a moan.
a cruel voice supplies. Steve doesn’t notice when time speeds up, but suddenly Tony and Pepper are standing right there at their table and Sharon is insisting they join them for a drink.
“Tat Tat Tat!” Peter said sloppily, his feet moving him around in all directions before he took a rocking step, turning himself around and facing Natasha who was standing in the doorway, smiling at Peter widely and looking like she was…
“I don’t judge. Come on, tell me how you’re getting Coulson to cover our expenses?” Clint stared at Tony wondering what he was meant to say. ‘Turns out Coulson has a bigger crush on Steve than you do and does anything he asks’ didn’t seem like a good start. Clint itched the palm of his hand that had been gripping the bow earlier, when he forgot his hand guard it often resulted in the skin being irritated from the tight grip.
“Well you do get us in trouble a lot…like the sewerage incident…” Clint looked at Steve who was very deliberately staring at the table. His wrist still in Natasha’s hand and hovering over the salt.
“I’m starved, I’ve been dreaming about the food here since you asked me.” She winks before scanning the menu.
Maybe they’re not the two best people to love, both broken and frightened and uncertain, living with a future filled with science experiments gone wrong and crazy alien Gods. They hold each other tighter, feeling their hearts beat in their chests, breathing in one another’s scents, pressing their lips together.
“Not off the top of my head. Pass the salt Steve?” Quick as lightening Natasha grabbed Steve’s wrist in her hand and held it there, hovering over the salt. Her ees turned dark.
“Steve needs you too Tony, they both need you…they both need their family. You all need your family right now.” Natasha feels hot tears on her neck and she sighs gently, murmuring words to a Russian lullaby she knows.
Two days later Tony was delivered fifteen kilos of plutonium, when he kissed Steve on the cheek sloppily the super soldier couldn’t stop smiling for two days.
Occasionally Pepper would show up and sleep in Peter’s room, or on Steve’s side of the bed, just holding Tony’s hand as he tried to understand exactly what was happening. Everyone was on autopilot, just going through the motions of living.
Peter didn’t look 17 as he lay in the hospital bed, wires poking out from all over, needles dug into his skin, monitors beeping, bandages covering his arms and the plastic hospital sheet covering his body.
He wasn't exactly sure why that pained expression crossed Steve's face, but he was pretty exhausted, so he couldn't really worry all that much.
"That's incredible," Bucky murmured, mesmerized with the fact that his arm was working again easily and painlessly. "You're going to have to show me how to do that."
"I'll make sure it's safe," Tony said, glancing back to make sure that Steve and Bucky were behind him. No one was going to be hurting Bucky again, he’d make sure of it. Tony turned his comm. back on. "How's Hydra looking?"
"Let's go get Steve back," Tony said confidently. Maybe... maybe he could tell his team. They obviously cared about him. Maybe they'd be okay with him being Iron Man. "Let's go bring my boyfriend home."
"I'm fine, just get us into that base," Steve shouted over the wind. Tony kept his focus on the base, dodging to the left when someone at the Hydra base started firing at them. The good thing was that, with all of the Hydra agents firing at them, no one noticed when the plane went into stealth-mode and landed near the front of the base.
"I am," Iron Man said, putting his hands on his hips. "The vast majority of the world would say you're just about as physically perfect as a human being could get."
After talking at the park for quite a while, they'd walked around the city and had eventually ended up going out to dinner. Steve had been right—it
stung. Bruce… didn’t think he’d make a good husband either? Did they think that Steve could do better? Of course they must’ve… why else would they be laughing at the thought of Tony getting married? Surely no one was laughing at the fact that he was marrying
While he hated getting blood drawn—if someone got ahold of it, someone bad, then they could create their own super-soldiers that could be used to attack his team—he didn't have a problem with giving blood to Bucky. It didn't take long before Bruce got the transfusion set up and to get the bullets out of Bucky. By that point in time, the ex-Hydra assassin had already passed out. The blond was a little surprised when his boyfriend didn't leave the room, instead choosing to stand by his side and keep a hand on his shoulder.
smell that always seemed to hang around the building, and he didn't feel any sort of panic at being in a hospital. What did startle him was the fact that someone was holding his hand, because the moment that he was awake, he felt someone give his hand a gentle squeeze.
“You risked everything… for me and Nat?” Tony asked softly, and once again Steve was lost staring into those eyes.
“He didn’t act like you. He acted like… like what the media portrayed you to be,” maybe-Steve said. “He didn’t even know that we share a bedroom, or that we’ve been dating. I mean—we only recently told the team, but
“Tony’s… beginning to recognize us a little,” Clint said, making sure to stay back with Natasha and Bucky. Werewolf-Tony didn’t seem to have a problem with Bruce at all. “He changed back once when you were out—he explained how you saved him, how you got shot and… and how he was able to keep his right mind long enough to get you out of there.”
