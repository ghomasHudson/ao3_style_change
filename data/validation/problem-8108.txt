Then, when his teammates were safe once more, he would be the one to break their bargain.  There would be a penalty, for deliberately breaking one's word was not a thing to be done lightly — men would call him oathbreaker, and he would know the words for truth — but honor ceased to be honor if a man held it more dear than his shieldbrothers' lives.
Abruptly, Thor turned on his heel and stormed toward the elevator, his fists clenched and his boots striking sparks off the concrete floor.
Steve just sat there, hoping the expression on his face didn't look too stunned and vacant. Maybe they could go back to making fun of his costume, instead of talking about Tony performing oral sex on rock musicians? This was not helping his attempt to not think dirty thoughts about his probably-concussed teammate.
Tony’s lips twitched. “What do you think I meant by a real date?”
She could already hear the strangled note in Doom's voice as he grudgingly asked her to please hand over the book.
"Just try to ignore it," Tony said, his voice tired. "They've been recycling the same anti-repeal articles since this summer, and they'll probably keep doing it until the primaries start in the spring."
"You've had people mess with your head before," he said, after a moment. "And, well, let's just say you've gotten around."
He pulled his attention back to the task at hand, and slid the first of the vials under the lab's fume hood; he'd just gotten it open, his movements made agonizingly slow by the necessity of the vacuum chamber and the heavy gloves he had to work through, and extracted a sample for examination under a microscope, when Thor's deep voice echoed through the room.
Loki down before Sin arrived with spear in hand; if one of them got their hands on it, it would all be over.  They wouldn't be able to stop a vastly more powerful Loki, or a Doom with god-like powers, and would likely die trying.
"It's written in your computer's appointment book, if you check," she said. "And I sent you an email."
"Do not break anything." Jan's voice was sharp over his communicator, slightly shrill the way it often was when she was in Wasp form. "Iron Man, Thor, you guys stay out here. We need you covering the exits in case they try to run."
"I had hoped you could remain innocent of my master's plans until they had already come to pass. It seems Stephen and I taught you too well."
"There's pulling your punches enough to avoid hurting your opponent, and then there's being afraid to punch him in the first place." Steve, unfairly, was neither out of breath nor even really sweating. Enhanced endurance had all kinds of benefits.
changed was the thin spot in the fabric of reality located just beyond the polished brass altar rail, a blurred space in the air at what would have been head height for a short man – or for a woman of average height. Tendrils of chaos energy writhed invisibly around it, perceptible only to those who had eyes to see, and knew where and how to look.
"Very fortunate," Jan said coolly. Where ever he was going with this, it was unlikely to be something they wanted to discuss. Tony could still barely mention Steve's temporary death without flinching.
Clint took a deep breath. "Which room is Jan in?" he asked the doctor.
She shook her head, the movement just visible out of the corner of his eye.  “I’m fine.”
Steve didn't need to read the caption to know when and where the picture had been taken. In the upper left corner, over their heads, he could see rows of identical white headstones, marching away into the distance.
he'd slept with her.
"Why are you so interested in my sex life?" It had actually been Peggy, back during the war -- at least, if they were going by Tony's definition -- but there was no way Steve was admitting that in front of everyone. The fact that they all knew about him and Jack was bad enough; he didn't intend to detail any more of his sexual experiences for everyone else's amusement.
The candles on the altar flickered and went out, and a faint susurrus of noise began somewhere behind her, growing louder and louder until it echoed off the stone ceiling.  The hair on her arms stood up, the power that was about to be hers crackling over her skin.
He could feel sweat prickling against his skin, along his ribs and back, could smell the faintest hint of sulfur cutting sharply through the must of candles and incense and old stone as Chthon's power lashed at him. It battered at his shields, against the edges of his mind, full of malicious intent.
The last time they had met in a casual setting, out of costume and not on Avengers business, had been in a dinner in California, where Steve had tried unsuccessfully to convince Tony to abandon his obsessive and self-destructive attempt to reclaim his stolen technology. Since then, they hadn't interacted unless the team required it.
He didn't think there was any surveillance on the mansion – he'd scanned the entire three-block radius for electronic surveillance equipment – but there was no way of knowing who, or what, might have followed Sharon and the Winter Soldier here. The briefcase containing his armor was tucked in the corner of the kitchen, with Steve's shield right next to it, so they weren't exactly unarmed, but it never hurt to be cautious.
"Yeah, it is," Clint interrupted. "Because you're coming down here now, and I'd like Tony's opinion on the computer systems before we let it run with nobody watching them."
"No!" Tony blurted out, speaking over him. "Don't!" He knew even as the panic flooded him that it was completely irrational, but the idea of Steve seeing him this way was so utterly humiliating that he couldn't help it. "We're going to figure this out. We just need a little more time." Steve had been very clear that their friendship was over, the last time they'd met. He'd given back the shield Tony had made him, and walked away, shoulders stiff and angry. And he'd ignored every call Tony had made or email he'd sent since, which might have been Steve's dislike of email and voicemail, but was probably proof that Steve had meant exactly what he had said - that Tony had lost his trust and respect, and he was done with him.
"What happened the last time you guys met?" Tony asked, as he spun sideways in midair to avoid Atlas's giant fist.
Ben wasn't happy -- he was probably anticipating a Jameson tantrum as well -- but he agreed to put the word out that the conference was delayed when Steve told him bluntly that they were all exhausted and needed sleep.
"There's only one person it could have been," Barnes muttered thickly. He hissed through his teeth as Steve pressed a wad of cotton gauze against his side, the material swiftly turning red. "He will be dealt with."
"Considering how easy it is to hack into your system, I think I'd prefer to do this in person." 'Easy' was something of an overstatement, but given that both the Mandarin and Red Skull had been able to infiltrate the old Helicarrier's security systems, take over SHIELD's satellites, and plant double agents in their ranks, it wasn't beyond the realm of probability that Doom had done the same thing. Or that some of the Red Skull's agents might still be in place.
"I'm not sure we can afford to have her as an ally, either," Jan said. She patted him on the arm, and added, "Try to keep it together, okay? It's hard enough keeping this team functional as it is, between Thor and Hank and Carol's issues with Wanda."
Steve nodded – he took Wanda or Strange’s word on that sort of thing.  Magic was far from his area of expertise.  Tony was all right; that was the important part.  The spear hadn’t cursed him, or eaten his soul, or opened him up to possession by Chthon.
Wanda closed the heavy, wooden door behind her, and carefully set the loaf of bread down on the kitchen table, shoulders suddenly stiff. There was someone else in the house; she could feel it.
"We don't even have a bookshelf in here yet." Tony's voice came from directly behind him, moments before his arms slid around Steve's waist. He rested the sharp point of his chin on Steve's shoulder, the edges of his goatee rasping against Steve's neck distractingly. "Leave those for later and come help me test if the bed is sturdy enough."
. Everything was going to be fine, and Rhodey would be pleased to see him and no supervillains were going to attack the charity ball.
"When you-" Tony broke off, almost stumbling over the word, then started again. "When you found out that I was pregnant and you said that you would marry me, did you really mean that, or were you just offering because it was the right thing to do?"
There hadn't even been any sentries outside, just a single guard by the front gate.
Tony found himself unable to look away from Steve for a moment; the little smile he was directing at Tony made his entire face look soft and happy and young, and even the knowledge that he wasn't entirely worthy of it couldn't diminish the warmth he felt at knowing he could cause that expression, knowing that
"Scientific progress must not be hindered by the petty constraints of 'law' or 'morality!'"
he thought.
, not some stranger with his mannerisms and speech patterns. "You look better without all that make-up, though. It doesn't belong on you. The dress either."
He was starting to suspect that this might be one of the reasons women wore them.
Dum Dum Dugan had seen it. Sal Kennedy, he was sure, had seen it, too. In light of that, it was a minor miracle that Tony had managed to command even a shred of Dugan's respect.
"Is that the Marlboro Man?" Tony pointed at the first picture, a color-saturated portrait of a cowboy. "Is that supposed to be sincere, or a post-modernist commentary?"
"So what is it?" Clint prodded. "What's it medication for?"
she thought, throwing all the force of her will at the thought of not moving, of stopping, of turning around – of doing anything other than what she did, which was to walk right up to where St. Margaret's massive wooden doors stood open and enter the cathedral. She didn't even stumble on the threshold, despite the evil she carried inside her.
And had he just effectively invited Tony to rejoin the East Coast team?
He'd come so close to falling off the wagon during the Registration fight, closer than anyone knew. Part of him had wanted to – it would have been so much easier to just stop fighting, and he'd already thrown away nearly every good thing he'd once had. It was different now. Now he had a lot more to lose. In some ways, that made it harder.
The room was a shambles now, sprayed with blood and filled with smoke from sparking and smoldering equipment. Nick Fury's severed head stared blankly at her from one of the workbenches, a line of bullet holes trailing down its forehead and between empty, robotic eyes. "Check the bodies," she ordered. "Kill anyone still breathing."
Don might have too much in the way of professional ethics to gossip about people's medical records behind their backs, but he wasn't the only Avenger who knew his way around a pharmacy. And professional ethics had never been one of their resident chemistry expert's major concerns.
Loki cocked her head, horned headdress casting distorted shadows on the pavement.  "Think you your mortal weapons can harm me?"
No one answered when Carol rang the doorbell, but knowing Tony, he was just as likely to be walled up in some soundproof workshop, completely oblivious to anything that wasn't either mechanical or electronic.
Catatonic state. Catatonic state wasn't good.
"So do I," Tony muttered.
He'd been dreading the alternative. Being the only general practitioner in a small town had its disadvantages, one of which was explaining to a patient whom he'd just diagnosed with cancer that he didn't think the 'out of towners who'd built that big castle' were the kind of gods who performed miraculous healings. There were times when he would have been willing to trade all of Thor's strength and power in return for the ability to cure leprosy or blindness or paralysis with a touch.
"–you always–"
"That would be great!" Clint said, in a relieved tone that implied that this had been exactly the result he'd been hoping for. "I'll go tell everyone. They can be on a quinjet by this afternoon. Or, well, seeing as it's nighttime there, they can be on a quinjet tomorrow morning!" and he hung up the phone, cutting off Steve's strangled,
Tony blinked, and missed a step, then had to skip sideways to get back into the proper rhythm. "Turn what down?"
Sharon had said.  She’d told him to hold on, too, and her hands had been covered in blood just like his were now.
"I didn't tell him what it was from," Tony admitted. "I said I thought it was in the Bible somewhere. Knowing C.S. Lewis, it probably is. Steve never read the whole series; he read the first book, and then Hank told him how the last one ended, so he didn't bother with the rest of them." At least Steve had been spared the experience of getting most of the way through the entire series before discovering that Narnia was all a lie. Tony had met very few fellow science fiction fans who didn't loathe
Clint winced; Jarvis wasn't going to be happy when he saw the scratches Matt/Patton/Churchill's claws had left on the shiny new floorboards.
Tony sank down to sit on the tile floor, his back against the cool metal and frosted glass blocks of the stall dividers, and pulled out his Avengers communicator, flipping it to the West Coast team's frequency.
"I slept with her. With Wanda," Clint blurted out. "And then I let her go."
There had to be an empty hospital bed waiting for Wanda to return to it.  Steve was tired enough that his eyes ached and his whole body felt hollow, and he hadn’t channeled colossal amounts of magical power.
"But Matt's married."  The protest slipped out before Peter could help it.
It didn't seem right that an evil as great as Chthon could walk into a church so easily; there ought to have been a barrier across the threshold, to keep the likes of her out of here.
"No, Don Blake did, but I mean, so what? It's the same thing." Clint felt his face flushing. Only about ten minutes ago, he'd been promising Don Blake that he wouldn't tell anyone he'd seen him. But Cap really needed some good news right now, and hey, he didn't look lost and defeated anymore, so clearly Clint had made the right decision.
Sam grinned. "Wouldn't you like to know."
The cathedral looked just as benign the second time around, but this time the bare branches of the tree caught Jan's eye. The trees in Central Park were still a riot of fall color.
down here getting a tetanus shot?
"What happened to him?" Sam nodded at Strange. "I thought he was pretty much indestructible."
"If Chthon breaks free and we have to fight him alone, we're doomed."
"Fury finally decided to do something about the Sino-Lemurian situation?" Tony asked, raising his eyebrows. Reports of two prominent Lemurian expatriates' deaths had appeared about half an hour ago in one of the two newsfeeds that were all the Extremis would let him monitor full-time these days. The NYPD hadn't released a statement yet, but the local news was already calling it a murder-suicide.
Steve stared after him for a moment, then wrenched his gaze away from the broken window and the empty space beyond and turned to Clint. "Give Jan to War Machine. He'll take her down."
Her knuckles stung where she’d skinned them on Doom’s mask, bits of skin torn off them.  It was a sharp counterpoint to the dull headache she’d woken up with in Doom’s warehouse, which had never quite gone away, and the muscles in her arms and legs still felt wobbly from the transition back from being goliath-sized.  Shrinking never made her feel this worn out.
Technically, as chairperson, she had the power to asked them point blank what the problem was, and whether it would interfere with their ability to work together as a team, but in practice... almost no one but Steve or Thor ever took advantage of that power.
Don went limp, everything around him knocked out of focus.  Something slammed into his thigh with numbing force, and then he was flying.
"I was so angry at her," Carol said, after a long silence during which Jan dug all the pecans out of the top layer of ice cream. "I thought she'd put Clint under mind control. Tony and Jen, too. Lot of us have had bad things happen to us. The rest of us didn't try to destroy us all over it. And then... M Day scared me. Taking away people's powers, turning mutants back into normal people. There are people who'd like to do that to me. To take away what I felt for Jessica, what I still feel, and make me a good little woman who does what she's supposed to. Because they think the world would be better that way."
Tony spun on his heel to find Strange standing - posing - in the lab's doorway, his cloak billowing around him in a non-existent breeze.
"So you're going to chain him up and leave him here, too?  Are you starting a collection?"  Hank's voice was at its most caustic and belittling, and he could do belittling better than almost anyone Jan knew.  It was all in the tone.
She had thought she was getting over it, moving on, but Tony's brief pregnancy had brought all of the memories, all of the grief back.
Which meant it wasn't safe yet for Hank to try shrinking down small enough to fit through the gaps in the energy grid.  Even twenty-four hours would have been risky — it took longer than that for most psychological medications to completely leave the body — and by that time, Sin was likely to have come back and started in on whatever plans he had for them anyway.
“Tony has the extremis,” she said.  “He’ll be okay.”  He hadn’t been able to use it as heavily since the Mandarin had zapped him, and lately he’d stopped using it for anything but controlling his armor, probably at Steve’s insistence, but the basic functions were still there.  He’d survived stopping his own heart before; he’d survive this.
"Fine!" Wanda's hands made an angry slashing motion. "Do that. I want you to do that! The others all treat me like I'm either a victim or a timebomb, but none of them would do anything about it if I needed to be taken out. None of them could."
Then Wanda's stiff, tremulous smile widened into a real one, and her eyes started to shine with what looked suspiciously like unshed tears. "I heard that you were dead," she said. "I'm so glad you're back. I wish I'd been here to help, when it happened."
"It could be much worse," Hank agreed, remembering Wanda's open devastation after her twins had been erased from existence, the result of some kind of demonic magic he still wasn't sure he understood. "This is what you wanted, after all, right?"
"I'm meeting Steve for lunch when he gets back from the Helicarrier." Even had he not been, he simply wasn't hungry. An Extremis-induced headache had been wrapped around his temples all morning, ready to turn into the familiar ice-pick stabbing over his left eye if he accessed more than three streams of data at once.
"Are you all right?" Steve was stepping forward without the need for thought, wrapping one hand around the wet fabric of Tony's upper arm to pull him upright again.
Wanda froze, staring blankly at the miniature screen in front of her. The little box in the corner still cheerfully counted down the kilometers remaining until they reached the runway at La Guardia.
Carol took the lead, pushing in front of Clint, who looked irrigated, but didn't argue.
been easy, and the subway accident yesterday had been an ugly, messy disaster all around – the Avengers hadn't been called in on that one, but it had been the top news item on every local news feed Tony had open until half an hour ago, when the venom symbiotes rampaging down Lexington Avenue had replaced it. Keeping all the datafeeds open made his head ache, the stab of pain over his left eye a familiar presence by now, but it was necessary.
The sound of the metal spearhead hitting the pavement was jarringly loud in the sudden silence.
And then Loki would be called to account.
If Rhodey was War Machine, that meant he was Tony's friend, and was probably a scientist of some kind, so... "Did you come down to help?" Peter asked. Then he turned to Hank. "There's a whole list of things that react badly with physostigmine, but none of the toxin's other components are on it. You'll have to check that none of the victims are on heart medication, though."
He was going to have to be careful, Steve realized. Hold back just a little, the way he did when he trained with Wanda.
Chthon? Doom felt an unwelcome sinking sensation at the name. Loki could be dealt with once he possessed the spear, as could Strange, and several of the dark powers Doom owed unfortunate debts to. Chthon was another matter altogether. If he were interested in Doom's spear, it would complicate matters considerably.
Jan stood as well, feeling herself break into a smile at the sight of him, and waved him to a seat.
It was February, and a cold February at that. Tony had to be freezing. "You're already here. You might as well go take a shower."
Hank winced, watching her rub at the spot, and lowered the lasers' energy levels. With the training room's safety protocols fully engaged they were already at close to minimum, but you couldn't be too careful the first time you live-tested any version of a danger room.
"Nay, the Enchantress hypnotized me once."
"Thanks," MJ said, smiling up at him as he stood.  "Can you ask them to put lemon in it?"
Tony had a spy satellite watching the cathedral, and several street level cameras planted around the block, filming in infrared as well as visible light, plus a network of hacked traffic cameras, but the ambient chaos energy made them unreliable, the feeds prone to cutting in and out and half the data corrupted. And he couldn't monitor them 24/7 with the Extremis anymore, which meant that instead of seamless round-the-clock surveillance, they had a computer program designed to register "unusual activity" and set off an alert.
Wanda told herself not to jump to conclusions – though it would explain both why the Night Nurse seemed almost personally offended by Strange's injuries, and why she had been visibly less than thrilled to see a strange woman arrive with Wong to check on him – and forced her attention back to the topic at hand. There were more important things at stake right now than Strange's admittedly morbidly fascinating love life.
"I trust the experiment was successful?"
Wanda shook her head. "I'm fine. Why don't you come inside? I'll make us some tea."
"Tony?"
He closed the magazine in disgust, knowing he'd have to open it back up and read the last few pages and already dreading it. It would just be more pointed, entirely legitimate and thoroughly uncomfortable questions, and possibly some more dredged-up dirt from the Congressional hearings. There was probably more about Tony's drinking, as well; reporters rarely got tired of rehashing that, and Tony had, unfortunately, given them a lot of material to rehash.
A/N: This fic was written in 2009, before same sex marriage was legalized in New York.  Same-sex marriages performed out of state in states such as Massachusetts, however, were recognized as legal.
Carol stared at him, appalled. "What on earth did you do to
Wanda cast a considering look at the television screen, then shrugged.  “She’s not really my type.”
Dr. Thomas smoothed his hair down with one hand and fixed Hank with a steady, assessing stare. "I would appreciate that. I understand you're a chemist, Dr. Pym?"
Wanda fought to keep herself from dissolving away into the chaos, forcing herself to focus on the rest of the world.   Chthon was all around her, the barrier between his prison and the rest of reality nearly worn through, but he couldn't touch her while the spear's power filled her.
Tony glanced around for Wanda as he took the briefcase, its weight comfortably familiar in his hand. Behind him, he could hear fabric rustling as Steve stripped out of his street clothes to the costume he was wearing underneath them.
"I've always found that locked doors work just as well as tree forts," Tony told him. He gestured around the room, at the empty racks of shelving waiting to be filled, the lab tables, the newly installed equipments, the walk-in temperature-controlled, humidity-controlled freezer for storing samples. "You've got a whole lab to yourself."
Tony’s eyes blinked open, dazed blue slits.  It took him several seconds to focus on Steve, but then his lips curved in a smile.  “Oh,” he said faintly.  “The world didn’t end.  Good.”
Steve closed his eyes for a long moment, hands clenching uselessly into fists at his sides, then exhaled, forcing himself to treat this like he would any other emergency.
"Scarlet Witch," she asked, "any progress on returning Iron Man to normal?"
Tony shrugged. "I knew the armor could handle it, and I needed to give the Falcon a chance to get into position behind him."
Chthon howled.
Tony frowned, assimilating this.  “It hurts like hell.  How many stitches did they put in me?”
Cap looked back up at Peter, and tried to smile for a second. He didn't succeed very well. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to burden you with all of this."
Then there would be no need to rely on Doom anymore.
Carol brought the quinjet down for a landing, the aircraft shuddering and jolting as if she were trying to land it in a windstorm.  When they disembarked, Steve going first with his shield already up and ready, the air was heavy and motionless, without a breath of wind, and so charged with magic that the hair on the back stood up.  He should have been able to hear shouts, car horns, the drone of the helicopters overhead, but instead everything was eerily, freakishly silent, as if the flames were devouring all sound.
If so, Steve hoped it happened before Chthon showed up on their doorstep.
The doctors had finished with both her and Sam in a matter of minutes, but Steve had insisted that they brief SHIELD on what had happened here rather than going to a conference room; Tony would have been grateful not to be cut out of things, but he suspected that Steve just didn't want to leave him.
Wanda threw another hex sphere at the closest robot, and winced internally as it fizzled out against some kind of shield.  The first two had gone down instantly, but obviously her brief flash of good luck had run out.  Oh, well.  Things got boring if they were too easy.
"Even when he does wake up," she said, "I don't think I should keep staying with him. I placed myself under his protection when I ran to the Sanctum Sanctorum, but now, with Strange injured, I'll just be a big, flashing target putting him in danger. You, too," she added, before Wong could object.
There was a bright flash of light at the corner of her vision, and a deep groaning sound vibrated through the soles of her feet.  Something was—
"The Meridian," she said, all business. "It's on Wall Street." She snatched a sticky-note from the corner of Tony's desk and thrust it at Steve. "Here's the address."
Tony smirked back, looking surprisingly triumphant for a man who was currently pinned to the floor. "Why? I've got you right where I want you." And then his hips writhed in a way that made Steve lose all interest in sparring.
“We could always hide behind the—whatever those are.”  Tony nodded at a large, feathery-looking bush that could have come straight out of Dr. Seuss illustration.
Don limped off down the hallway. Between the cane and stupid hat, it vaguely reminded Clint of something, but he wasn't sure what.
"I would put my life on the line for Iron Man," he said. "Or for Tony Stark."
"Give me that," Steve said after a moment, able to stand it no longer, and took the dishtowel from Tony's fingers. He put a hand under Tony's chin to tilt his face up, and Tony closed his eyes as Steve brushed the wet cloth gently over his eyelids.
Everyone in the room dutifully drank. It wasn't until Steve was putting his empty glass down that he remembered that he'd decided they were all going to stop playing this stupid game.
"Loki's words are oft as dangerous as her actions," Thor said flatly. He was actually talking to Tony now, Loki's appearance having presumably provided the distraction of someone he hated even more.
Tony had given up long ago on the idea of Steve returning his feelings - by the time he'd realized that what he felt for Captain America was more than just lust for his phenomenally attractive body, Steve had already started his endearingly ineffective pursuit of Sharon Carter - but part of him couldn't help savoring every touch, every bit of time he got to spend with Steve alone, just the two of them.
Clint was still trying to get up, each movement causing him obvious pain.  Jan grabbed him by the shoulder.  “Stop it.  You’ll puncture a lung if you don’t stay still.”  The words came out sharp-edged and harsh; she wanted to shake Clint, yell at him for being so careless, for not dodging, for sitting up and moving when he probably had broken ribs.
"Thor-" he began, intending to tell him to let Loki up to claim the spear, that anything she might do with it was unimportant next to stopping Chthon, and then Doom was moving.
"Hm. I guess only Carol counted, then," Wanda was saying thoughtfully. Everyone else was still staring at Steve.
Clint stepped forward and took the magazine from Steve's hands, opened it, and shoved it back at him. "Actually, I think he just needs to see the last page."
"No," he agreed, "not all of them. Likely not even half. Undoing the spell in its entirety would take far more power than either of us possesses."
"And then after I was finished with Kooning, or rather, when Kooning was finished with me, I had to meet with Gyrich, and then with what I think may have been half the Pentagon, plus the Department of Homeland Security." Tony groaned, rubbing at the bridge of his nose. "And Gyrich was actually the high point. I thought I'd never escape. I can't believe I actually volunteered to be Secretary of Defense once. I must have been insane."
Everyone had been  entirely unreasonable about that, although in retrospect, now that Steve  knew that Tony had wanted things between them to be serious from the  beginning, his objections made a lot more sense.  "Just because Hank  can't dance…" Steve began.
"At least you didn't get yourself electrocuted this time," Steve offered, resisting the impulse to lay a hand on one dejected metal shoulder. There were news vans from three different television stations parked only a few dozen feet away.
Rhodey frowned. He wasn't making any move to come further into the room, as if he felt he didn't have any place intruding. "I'm so tired of doing this," he muttered.
Did it matter?  "During the middle of Tony's stupid registration disaster," and then, feeling suddenly defensive with both Hank and Jan watching him and remembering the stinging slap Jane had given him when she'd first seen him, he added, "It took me a while to get my head together; I came back before Thor did, and it was... confusing... for a while."  He'd been just plain Don Blake for over half his life, until the first time he'd touched Mjolnir's handle, but that had been thanks to Odin's magic suppressing Thor's memories and personality.  Having that part of himself missing entirely had been... strange.
"Unlike some, I am not so enamored of my own reflection that I must gaze at it constantly." It was an unfair charge — Loki was indeed vain, but his vanity had always been for his cleverness rather than his face or form — but saying the words might provoke his quick-to-anger stepbrother into revealing himself.
into having sex that hadn't been his idea. He'd been used as a weapon against Wanda the same way she'd been used against the team.
"Mr. Stark is exaggerating. His assistance in the troubleshooting phase of the project was invaluable." She turned to the two junior DoE employees, bypassing DeFalco completely, and began to explain the finer points of her filtration system, pointing out the applicable areas of the design blueprints with a laser pointer.
Steve was so surprised that he lifted his own glass and took a healthy swig without even thinking about it. It wasn't until everything went dead silent and he realized that the others were all staring at him that the implications of what he'd just done started to sink in.
that. He knows why I- he was the one who debriefed me when I got back from Afghanistan." Tony's voice had risen, and he was speaking faster now, the world tumbling over one another. "And then he went behind my back last year and stole my patents and my tech, and if you think any of that was just going to stay in SHIELD's hands and not end up being used wherever the government wanted it to be, which it
Thor took a step forward, spinning Mjolnir in a slow circle.  "If any of you actually
She looked good in it. Even better than she had in her old red and blue costumes.
His eyes went back to the picture of his funeral, and he made himself look away from it.
The next group of SHIELD personal who trespassed across his borders to investigate some supposed “human rights violation” were not going to be leaving again.  Ever.
"I have a better question," Jarvis's voice was not loud, but it cut through the babbling in the room with ease, everyone automatically falling silent to let him talk. "If she means to perform a demonic ritual, why is she coming here to do it?"
"That's for Jarvis!" Jan shouted, blasting him directly in his purple-fabric-covered face.
She had— It had used her to—
The Metropolitan Museum's manuscript curator was visibly nervous about entrusting a valuable sixteenth century manuscript to a bunch of costumed superheroes; Sam's careful explanation of the Mansion's security system hadn't reassured him much, which, considering the number of times the place had been attacked, blown-up, set on fire, or otherwise subjected to major structural damage, wasn't surprising.
And no one had heard from Clint or Wanda since the attack began.  Or Carol.  With Chthon and chaos magic involved, Wanda would be more useful to Doom than any of the rest of them.  For all they knew, he could have order his Doombots or Sin's men to take her and kill the others.
"Thor wouldn't do that," Tony objected.
Again, there was no response, and Steve glanced up at the green lines and curves of the EEG read-out, wondering whether Tony was actually seeing him, or if he was looking through Steve, to someone or something else. He had obviously been hallucinating earlier, with his talk about blood and bodies.
The half-dozen boxes still stacked in the corner of his and Tony's room had acquired a thin layer of dust, and a few clumps of the orange fur that seemed to coat everything in the house these days-Patton shed almost as much as Beast had. The first box he opened was full of books, the ones he'd looked through when they had first started to move in and then never gotten around to actually putting on shelves. He'd been meaning to give Bucky that copy of
Tony was staring at the floor now, shoulders slumped. "Strange thinks the spell is getting stronger over time, tightening its hold on me. Hank ran blood tests on me when I was first changed. I was infertile then. I've never even menstruated." He laughed, the sound edged with hysteria. "I was relieved about that. I thought I was lucky, that at least that was one part of being a woman I wouldn't have to deal with."
Between his own memories and Thor's, Don had seen an awful lot of gruesome ways to die, none of which he wanted to experience himself or watch friends experience.  "Please stop talking.  You're not helping."
Sharon was frowning now, a line drawn between her eyebrows.  "And Fury helped stop it.  We wondered why Sin had it in for him, when he wasn't involved in Red Skull or Crossbones'' deaths.  What was this ritual supposed to do?"
"It's some kind of Vietnam, chemical warfare, Agent Orange thing," Peter told him.
"Yes," Jessica Jones said, "but this time Danny's not coming, and if he was, we'd know better than to let him drink."
Clint felt himself automatically standing up straighter, not that it would do much good. "Because by the time I heard about it, the two of them had put it behind them, and you beating Rhodey up wouldn't have done anyone any good." Clint shrugged. "Look, if I'd known about it at the time, I would have kicked him off the team for endangering civilians, but by then he'd already left. I mean, you were a horrible leader, but I did learn that much from you."
If he could reseal the vault door, it wouldn't matter.  No amount of power Doom could conjure up and no weapon he might have brought with him could get him out of there.
She probably ought to vote no as well, Jan knew. Keeping a watchful eye on a teammate, trusting them to do the right thing, to use their powers wisely, was something they all did every day, but after a disaster as complete as Wanda's possession-driven breakdown, it would be foolish to just let her walk back onto the team without proving herself. She had kicked Hank off the team for a reason, all those years ago, and it hadn't been because he'd given her a black eye – he'd come within inches of getting the rest of them killed. They hadn't been able to trust his judgment, any more than they'd been able to trust Tony's judgment when he'd been drinking, though he'd thankfully taken himself off the team of his own volition before Jan or Steve had had to do it for him. Carol, too, had needed to be stricken from the Avengers roster when she'd been drinking, and it had taken more than simply her insistence that she was fine, afterwards, for Steve to agree to let her back on.
A shame none of these Doombots had the energy weapons their comrades at the mansion had carried.  Guns of all kinds were always so easy to disable.
Clint pulled a face. "Tetanus shots hurt. And I've already had three in the past two years."
Moments later, he was straddling Tony's legs, pinning him against the wall of the shower. Tony was fumbling one-handed at Steve's belt, his other hand still gripping Steve's shoulder, fingers five hard points digging into the muscle of his neck and upper arm.
"I've spent all last night and half this morning trying to undo the work of a god. I need to rest. And so do both of you."
"That's not actually what I was saying." On Sam's shoulder, Redwing cocked his head and eyed Hank's finger threateningly.
"The rest of you, go," Tony started. "Hawkeye and I will-"
"You look-" Steve started.
There was no 'may' about it.  Tony looked grey, his eyes not entirely focused, and only Steve's arm was keeping him from being flat on his back again.  Awake and talking was much, much better than still and silent, Steve reminded himself.  It would be nice to believe that complaining about the state of his armor meant that Tony wasn't seriously injured, but Steve suspected that Tony would be complaining about the destruction of his armor even if he were on the verge of death.
"I wasn't able to determine that," Strange said, answering Steve's question. He grimaced slightly, clearly not pleased to have to admit to ignorance about something. "Wanda herself is unsure when he began influencing her."
She still couldn't just leave Tony to deal with all of this alone.
The museum's high-ceilinged entrance hall was painfully exposed; the back of Steve's neck crawled as he walked through it, staying close to the wall. Just because Tony hadn't detected anyone hiding on the second floor balcony with a gun didn't mean no one was there. Security cameras could be tampered with.
"Cap?  Wasp?  Anybody hear me and care to tell me what that was?"  Clint tried his com link again, grimacing when it presumably failed to work.  Wanda's had been producing nothing but static since the Doombot had woken her.
Loki made a faint, pleased humming noise, and her smile deepened. "I am the rotten ice that breaks under men's feet. I am the fire that burns the hand that wields it. Betrayal is my nature. Just as it is yours." She pulled her hand free of Doom's and straightened from her slouch against the table, closing what little distance there was between them in a single step. "Take off the mask, and let me look on the face of the man who will rule at my side."
"I'm not sure-" he started.
It was a hard kiss, almost violent. Tony's fingers dug into Steve's back, into his arm, hard enough that it would have left bruises on someone a little less durable. Steve kissed him back, one hand tangled in Tony's hair, holding him in place.
It should have felt like a sanctuary still. It was Wanda's own worries and insecurities that made her feel uneasy here, in Agatha's parlor. Her own fears that made the shadows that gathered in the candlelit room feel ominous.
The Helicarrier's medical bay was far better stocked and staffed these days than during the carrier's time in hiding under New York Harbor; SHIELD had been in the midst of a major recruiting push recently, and hallways that had been nearly empty by the end of Tony's tenure as director were full of people again, and a steady flow of agents had come in and out of the infirmary while Tony had submitted to a series of time-consuming and uncomfortable examinations at the hands of Maya Hansen and a vaguely familiar SHIELD doctor.
"Rhodes!"
"Clint, just do it."
Red Skull. Even dead twice over, he was still reaching out from his well-deserved grave to try and destroy people Steve loved.
"How did you get me out of my armor?" he mumbled into Steve's neck.
“You’re so hard to please,” Tony said.  “Don’t use the Extremis, don’t get stabbed, don’t take me anywhere expensive…”
Jarvis raised an eyebrow. "I thought they opened while you were... away."
Don was tired enough that anger was hard to hold on to.  He might still be chained to a wall, slowly bleeding to death, if it weren’t for Hank, thoughtless and unnecessary heroics or not.  “You were far, far luckier than you deserve to be,” he told Hank finally, “and they’re pretty sure there’s no permanent damage.”  Something which most of the hospital staff he’d talked to considered either a minor miracle, or just one more of the many reasons why superhuman biology was confusing and unfathomable.
That was when the first of Sin's goons came through the door.
"It's the twenty-first century, Tony. You can wear exactly the same thing as you always do, just in a size and cut that doesn't make it look like you're wearing your boyfriend's clothing."
And, at the moment, neither did this one.  Had it been fried when Doom zapped — no, this was the spare one he'd started carrying around when he wasn't in armor, after the Extremis had begun acting up.  "Wanda, can you reach Spiderman?" he asked, after a brief mental debate about whether this was important enough to risk the return of the crippling headache using the Extremis would cause when it had just started to be bearable again.
"Why would you think that?" She sounded honestly shocked, so much so that Clint automatically turned to look at her; she was still standing by the table, maybe a step or so closer to him than she had been. "You would never do that, and I would never agree to it." There was absolute conviction in her voice, and looking at her, standing there alone with her, suddenly got a little easier. "I don't really... remember much about what we did," she added, much more hesitantly, "it's all kind of vague, but I know you didn't hurt me or force me to do anything. I wanted to help you, because you seemed so sad. Or that's what he made me think, anyway."
He'd done it several times during the war, including once by accident. He had no desire to repeat the experience.
Jan dove lower, mentally preparing herself for the dizzy head rush that always ensued when she tried to grow immediately after returning to normal size from her Wasp form. If necessary, she and Carol could rip the doors off the car, get the driver out before—
“He’s still in surgery.”
"I-was going to tell you not to try that."  Hank's voice was just above a whisper, not that that would actually help if Doom had them under electronic or magical surveillance.  From this distance, without decent light, it was impossible to tell if he was hurt of not.
Maybe he could have Iron Man show up and inform people that Tony Stark was sick, and couldn't come.
Hank waved the hand holding the goggles at her. "Please," he said. "The second I turn my back, he'll be up to his elbows in my equipment's guts. I miss my mini-lab."
"That's... a good idea actually." Steve frowned slightly, his mask crinkling over his eyebrows. "Is that really what it's like?"
Tony buried his face in his hands again. "Ignore me. I'm just feeling sorry for myself because I had to face things about myself tonight that I didn't want to be reminded of."
Did Tony include Steve in that category? Considering that he'd never made a move on him in all their years of friendship, probably.
"No, no, it's great. I mean, it's okay," Peter managed. "I know if it was MJ in here I'd be a complete wreck." He edged closer to the bed, really looking at Tony for the first time. He was staring at Steve as if hypnotized, eyes wide and horrified. "What did this thing do to him?"
It had to be better. Even Pepper had agreed that it was.
Doom ignored him, his gaze remaining on Steve.  "I gave you life again, Captain.  It would be a simple thing to take it back again, and none of your friends or allies would be willing or able to raise you a second time.  You do not want to stand in my way."
"In that case, I think you're all right. But tell me if you start experiencing any unusual symptoms; mind control on this scale, for this long, isn't really covered in medical literature." He shook his head, smiling ruefully. "At least, not that I've read. I've missed a couple of years' worth of it."
"He wasn't injured on the mission," Sharon said. She took a step away from her position just behind Barnes's chair, where she'd been not-quite-hovering, and faced Tony fully. "Sin and a dozen of her snake-themed crazies ambushed us on the way back."
"Everything's changed since Tony and Reed and the rest of you blew the lid off everything. Blitzschlag is out, and there's an oversight committee looking into Van Patrick's death. I think his family is going to sue."
All the giant electronic billboards blew at once, the noise swallowed by the painfully loud scream of sound that seemed to come from inside Steve’s head.  He jerked his shield arm up automatically, and then—
He'd been trying hard to avoid thinking of Tony since Tony's apparent complete lapse of sanity - and that was if Steve was being charitable - over his stolen technology. He'd especially tried to avoid thinking of Tony in this kind of context, because musing about Tony's lean, cleanly defined muscles and husky voice made staying angry with him more difficult than Steve wanted it to be.
He had the satisfaction of seeing Tony wince. It was less satisfying than he had hoped it would be; he was not certain whether it was due to guilt, or physical pain.
"No," Clint said, "but I'm guessing from your tone of voice that it's a small number."
"I'm fine. I just didn't catch much sleep when I was in DC."
Not that SHIELD didn't solve problems by making people quietly disappear even now, but Steve had far more faith in Nick Fury's ability to make that judgment call than he had in the people who had been pulling HUSAC's strings. Not everyone involved with Registration or with the Initiative could have been as innocent of the true identity of Representative Dickstein's silent sponsor as they'd claimed. Whether they'd believed him to be Aleksander Lukin or known that he was the Red Skull, some of them had still had to know that he wasn't who he claimed to be. Known, and not cared, just as they hadn't cared about the innocent people shut away in extra-dimensional prisons, or the black ops program that had wanted to start a new super soldier project, with methods reminiscent of the Weapon X program. Or of the original Project Rebirth – unwilling or deliberately under-informed human test subjects had been part of that, too.
Steve's body was flush against his, radiating heat like a furnace, and he could smell the sweat on his skin, the clean scent of the soap he used. It made him dizzy for a moment, suddenly hard and ready to turn this sparring match into something else entirely – and then Steve jabbed him in the ribs with the elbow of his free arm, slammed a heel into his shin, and yanked himself free.
"It's not," Clint grunted, blocking a metal fist with one arm and shoving his bow between the robot's legs, "and I'm not." The robot toppled, and Clint leapt over it with enviable ease.
“Wanda-“ he started.
"The Nazis were obsessed with Norse mythology," Barnes said thoughtfully.
thought about the villains they were fighting, and ask for her suggestions on strategy. She and Pietro had had nowhere to go, after running from Magneto, and Steve had given them a home.
Was she brainwashing them somehow?  Or did they just hate everybody who wasn't part of their little Aryan cult just that much.
"I'm not helping, am I?" Carol asked. She sighed. "This sounds awful under the circumstances, but it's been nice being back in New York. The LAPD isn't really sure how to deal with superheroes, and all those riots didn't help. Plus, half the people on the street see superheroes and SHIELD as some sort of auxiliary to the cops after all that riot control Jen and Ares did, so they're not disposed to look on us kindly."
"It just..." Matt shook his head. The dull red leather of his mask obscured most of his face, but his body language conveyed unease – he was crouched low on the edge of the ledge, not bothering to look up at Strange as he spoke. Matt generally made an effort to face people when he spoke to them. "It feels wrong, somehow. Different. And I've been having these dreams. That there's something in there. Something that wants to get out."
When he heard Jarvis's voice coming from around the corner, he winced again, and considered slapping a foot over the biggest scratch.
The snap when the briefcase closed had a final quality to it. He set it aside and rubbed at his face with both hands, already feeling twitchy at the lack on mental stimulation — he hadn't accessed anything with the Extremis since yesterday, and his brain felt like it was running on a hamster wheel, too much energy with nowhere to go. Was this what Hank felt like when he got so revved up and twitchy?
"So?"  Peter said.  Clothing didn't prove anything.  It was just… clothing.   And Cap and Tony definitely had separate rooms.   "Daredevil sleeps in  his law partner's t-shirts."
Because, Steve realized as he lifted the picture frame out to reveal the smaller items under it, he hadn't disposed of them. They were all here. Every piece of Steve's art that had once hung in the Avengers tower or Tony's office, from pencil and ink sketches to charcoals to watercolors. At the bottom of the box, two half-filled sketch pads sat on top of a stack of loose bits of paper — sketchbooks he'd left behind when he'd left the team, the cartoon of the Avengers as characters from the Wizard of Oz that Jarvis had once had tacked to the front of the refrigerator, even doodles that Steve had tucked inside the pages of books he'd borrowed from or lent to Tony and forgotten about.
"I take it adequate is good?"
"I don't sound crazy," Tony snapped. "I can't trust anyone with it, not even the government. Especially not the government. You know that. You didn't trust them either. You gave your shield up because you didn't trust them, which is just about like one of the rest of us cutting one of our hands off. Like me giving the armor up."
"You think such petty weapons can disable the Sorcerer Supreme?" he asked, and raised his hands once more, gathering the power he had never lost hold of into them and preparing to launch into another spell.
Don poked at the puncture wound on the outside of Clint's thigh, cleaning the dried blood off with an alcohol swab. "This was made by one of your arrows, wasn't it?"
Steve led Tony into the kitchen and fetched a clean dishtowel out of a drawer, dampening it under the faucet.
Compared to all that, this ought to be easy.
Steve winced. Wanda stared down at her folded hands, clearly avoiding Jan's eyes.
He still hadn't gotten around to reconfiguring the quinjets' wings to fold up, though he'd added tail-hooks and reinforced the landing gear for carrier landings just in case back during his brief and disastrous turn as director of SHIELD.  The Helicarrier's deck crew was probably cursing his name at the moment.
Tony managed to keep from flinching at Steve's anger, but only just. He took a deep breath, eyes focusing on the needle in his elbow, the green lines of the EKG monitor, the fuzzy hospital blanket that was covering his legs -- anywhere but Steve's face. "You had an access code," he pointed out, doing his best to sound reasonable. "And don't tell me you wouldn't have done the exact same thing! You would never sit out a fight, and you know it." People had been going out of their minds; he hadn't had a choice. And it wasn't as if Steve was any better at sitting on the sidelines.
Sometime over the past few weeks, it had turned cold. Barely October, and it was already only fifty degrees — and from a couple hundred feet up, with nothing to block the wind, it was even colder.
Carol frowned. Steve preferred the movie version of Sam Spade to the more ruthless and less soulful-eyed original, and Tony preferred his manly pulp novels to be of the James Bond variety.
Steve shrugged. "He can fend for himself." Tony might not actually enjoy politics, but he was good at them.
"What is it?  How badly is he hurt?"  Jan sounded concerned, her voice sharp and shrill in the way it only was when she was Wasp-sized.  "Hank?"
Two metal tentacles emerged from slots in the wall and reached for Jan. This time, she dodged easily, twisting sideways to let one tentacle grope past her and grabbing the other in her hand. In her place, Hank would have grown about fifty percent and then tried to rip the tentacle out of the wall. Jan simply grabbed for the other tentacle and wrapped the two around one another, then abandoned them to make a dive for the holographic supervillain, who was trying to 'escape' from Clint.
The prospect of a nice, loud argument vanished as the sick thrill of fighting with Tony soured in his stomach. "Don't joke about that."
Nowadays, he could have simply saturated a costume with Pym particles and let it grow and shrink as he did, but the old red costume had been created before he'd been able to do that, before the Pym particles had soaked into his bone marrow and bloodstream and made his abilities permanent, and before he'd been able to transfer them from his body into inanimate objects.
"We'll take the stairs to the top floor," Steve said, one finger tracing the line of the stairwell on the map.
The whine of Thor's spinning hammer abruptly ceased, and Thor landed in the middle of the street with a thud Tony could feel in his bones. "The last of the vapors have dispersed. The air is once more safe to breathe."
Loki raised an eyebrow. "I have no need of human souls. No, what I propose will cost you nothing. I will aid you in getting the spear, and then you will give its power to me."
"Fine. I get airsick sometimes, especially on long flights. But thank you for your concern."
"Do you have a second?" he asked Don. "There's something I wanted to ask you."
Steve rubbed at his face with both hands, just managing to stop himself from getting dust in his eyes. He'd as good as announced that he didn't trust Tony. There
He stood, already moving towards the door. "Where are they?" he barked at Pepper.
The cat, curled up on the back of the couch, rearranged himself with a creak of leather and settled back into position with both of his hind feet shoved into the back of Steve's neck. A slight prick of claws warned that he would be displeased if Steve attempted to either move or push his feet away.
It was easier after that, but it seemed like an eternity before Steve was pulling Tony's helmet off, trying to be as gentle as possible.  Tony had remained motionless throughout the procedure, no matter how violently Steve and Thor had jerked on his armor or rattled him around inside it, and the sick, frozen feeling that had taken up residence in Steve's chest when he'd first seen Tony go down and not get up again was all-consuming now.  His fingers felt like someone else's as he touched Tony's face, felt for the pulse in his neck.
Tony's lips curved into a lopsided smile that only made the ache in Steve's body hotter and harder. His pupils were wide and dark, his lips parted slightly, and his hair was falling into his face, already disheveled from the effort of lugging boxes around. Someone else might have just looked sweaty and tired—Tony looked as if he'd just finished having hot, sweaty sex with someone, and was looking forward to having more. "When we bring out the next version of that stupid satellite phone," he said huskily, as Steve began unbuttoning his shirt, "the one with tablet capabilities that are going to put the Kindle out of business, and it sells millions of copies, I'm going to tell Koening what he can do with all those DoD contracts he's always threatening to take away from me."
Tony had been the one to turn off Happy's life support, when he had been slowly dying from a supervillain's beating. Pepper must have known; Tony wouldn't have done something like that without telling her first.
That sounded reassuringly non-painful, and similar to some of the meditation exercises Agatha had had her perform, though Agatha hadn't used magical artifacts, preferring candles and circles of runes.
"What do you think?" Steve reached for Tony's zipper, deliberately taking as long as possible to pull it down and free Tony from the confines of pants and underwear.
Hank shook his head. "I don't have rattlesnake anti-venom, or any other kind of snake anti-venom. I work with insects," he added quickly, as Steve's eyes narrowed.
"He's already signed on with the Initiative," Tony said, a tiny line appearing between his eyebrows as he considered the idea. "And when he's not convinced that you're insulting the cult he belongs to, he's good with people."
Hank didn't bother to reply, listening instead for the background whirr of the room's systems coming back online. The holodummies had a split-second lag time, he reminded himself. It would make them clumsier, just enough to give him an edge.
Steve grinned.  The  bartender hadn't even batted an eye.  Maybe they should come back here  sometime.  Or maybe not.  Tony's back muscles felt hard and tight under  his hand.
"Loki's still more of a known quantity than Chthon is," Tony countered. "Yes, obviously, she'll try to stab us in the back, but if she helps us defeat Chthon first, then whatever treachery we have to deal with afterwards will be the lesser of two evils. We're majorly outclassed in terms of magical firepower right now." He turned to Steve, who could be counted on to be practical when it came to tactics. "You saw what Chthon did to Strange. If we try and fight both him and Loki at the same time, we're going to lose both battles."
"You're not that different," Steve said, carefully, "not in the ways that matter." Which was both true and not true. Tony could still run SI as a woman, still be Iron Man, still make Steve want to pound his head against the wall in frustration over how hard it was to understand him, still make Steve ache to touch him. And yet, every time Steve looked at him, there was still that half-second of confusion, that need to remind himself that this was
"More insults.  I killed valuable men to resurrect you; you should be grateful."
When Hill and Sharon approached, he casually glanced down at his watch.
Sam snorted. "I'm surprised at you," he said, voice dry with irony again, "suggesting that they'd shut an entire gallery down for bullshit political reasons. I'm sure it really needs years' worth of renovations."
He wasn't even sure if the snarled threat he'd delivered had come from himself or Thor.  Both, he suspected.
leaving obvious signs of what he'd been up to on display. Or was that part of Tony's 'careless playboy who couldn't possibly be Iron Man and wasn't about to outbid your company into the ground' persona?
Wanda smiled slightly.  "He can be over-protective.  He tried to do that to the Avengers a few times when I first joined, and we ended up having to rescue him from the Swordsman."
Steve raised his eyebrows, skepticism played up just enough for Tony to tell that he was exaggerating it. "How urgent can something be at that time of night? The business world survived just fine for decades before the invention of email, and even these days, every CEO except you has to go offline and get away from his computer in order to sleep." He rubbed a towel over his face and hair as he spoke, every other word half-muffled by the fabric. Muscle glided under his skin with every movement; Steve's body was perfectly sculpted to a degree that an Olympic athlete would envy, not just from the supersoldier serum, but from hours of training and practice – after Tony left to shower and dash down six floors for his nine o' clock meeting with Stark Industries' R&D department, Steve would probably spend another hour here, working first with the gymnastics equipment and then with his shield.
