“Why not- oh. Right.”
“Tony,” Nat said. “Look at Steve’s neck.”
And tomorrow, he was going to do it again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Because Peter didn’t understand.
“Do you think they’ll tell us if he’s there?”
Peter was pacing his bathroom, heart hammering.
Bruce grimaced and tugged at his earlobe. “Not what I was going to ask you about.”
“Steve, you lost, okay? There was a fight, one we were underprepared for, and you were the loser this time. We’re not going to talk about whether you could have won if things were different. What-ifs are dangerous for people like us. Because every day, we gain another what-if and if we’re not careful, those what-ifs will bury us alive.”
Peter crossed his arms. “Nothing is going on. I was sick yesterday. That’s all. You’re making this a way bigger deal-”
“Ready?” Tony asked, dropping a kiss on Steve’s temple.
“Dad, please, just-”
“Let me see your shoulders and abdomen, Peter. Check for broken ribs or internal bleeding from the fall.”
“Hey, it’s not like that,” Tony whispered, getting out of his chair to kneel in front of Peter. “No one wants to make you do anything. That’s not what this is.
At least that’s what Peter thought.
Tony threw his hands in the air in mock celebration. “Even better! Let’s take him on a mission so he can faint in the field with bombs and lasers flying everywhere-”
“Steve, he almost killed you. There was nothing you could have done.”
“Can I get him something?”
“Tony, you are
Tony checked classroom after classroom. Each time he dared to look, his heart skipped a beat.
“Stark-Rogers,” Tony interrupted.
Tony smiled and brought Steve’s face down to his so he could kiss him softly. “I always am.”
“I asked you a question. A relatively simple one, I think. Peter Stark-Rogers, when was the last time you ate?”
So Peter skipped the pizza, even an hour later, when his stomach cinched and yowled, begging for him to feed it.
“Peter.”
And then… it happened.
Tony couldn’t believe this. Refusing to drink or eat something was one thing. Dumping it down the pipes was another. “What was the point of that? I know you didn’t drink it. I’m sitting right here.”
“Tony- you know I was talking about running and not-” Steve’s face was getting hot. He hated how easily Tony unraveled him. “I was talking about running.”
When Peter finally reached the tower, Tony was waiting for him in the lobby, a suitcase in one hand and his cell phone in the other.
Tony stroked his chin and thought about it. “Sure, I’m done.”
Bruce and Tony didn’t buy it.
His spine was raw with rug burn from doing sit ups in his underwear but it was going to be worth it.
Tony was worried that if left unsupervised, Beckham might find some sort of tech he could use to craft a way into the vault in the basement. Sure, the vault was the safest vault on the black market and had been altered by none other than Tony himself, but he admitted his creations were fallible. Sometimes. Very, very rarely.
“Tony, I’m trying to help-”
Steve took a few seconds to reply. “
“I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking you.”
Peter was standing on the curb, the bus pulling away in a puff of foul smoke, the screech of metal axles ringing in his ears. He was on limited time. He needed to find somewhere to settle in for a nap.
“Fuck.”
Still trembling, Steve’s knees dug into his chest and his hands hadn’t moved from his hair. Tear tracks glistened along his jaw and down his neck. Tony couldn’t see Steve’s eyes from behind his palms and it was a small mercy.
“Ladies first,” Tony said.
But Peter had clammed up again. Tony could see the ‘system shut down’ initiating behind Peter’s eyes. Tony wasn’t going to get any more details out of Peter tonight.
Steve’s eyes dropped from seeking out the wall and found Tony’s. “How long are you going to be gone?”
The man didn’t seem to buy it but nodded and went back to his phone.
Luckily, Peter was still coming off of whatever that woman gave him and didn’t seem to hear Tony anyway. Pulling his shaky elbows beneath him like a baby giraffe, Peter sat up and rubbed the side of his face. Tony caught his hand right before he could touch the open cut on his neck.
Realization dawned on everyones’ faces and all three of them beelined for the south side of the building.
“You are stronger than this,” he murmured to his reflection, taking all of it in. His sallow skin, his plump cheeks grandmothers loved to pinch, his wide eyes. He was equal parts terrified of dinner, equal parts exhilarated.
“No idea.”
Ned gaped. “I love it when you do that. It’s so cool.
Nat arrived next, wearing a black evening gown with a set of small daggers artfully arranged at her waist. Her hair was pulled up and encrusted with gemstones. If it wasn’t for the cutting glare and the signature shade of red hair, Steve wouldn’t have recognized her.
Now that Peter’s attention wasn’t freaking out over calories and complex carbs he realized how tired Steve looked. Like he hadn’t slept well in days.
There was no way,
If only they knew that the millionaire on the base, a little shit from Washington D.C. named Johnny Bech, was ready for them, too.
Ned held up his phone and made the call.
“Hey, can you look at me for a second?”
“Just grabbing something different to wear,” Tony said, voice puffed up with enough false cheer to staff Macy’s on Christmas Eve. “I think you got some street grime and blood on him and you know how Steve is with stuff like that.”
Nat was standing a few feet away, chewing the agent out over the direction their mission took when Steve started to come to.
He moved around the cluster of Avengers to see Pops was leaning back against the wall, eyes closed.
Sure enough, a small patch of skin, the size of a thumbnail, was gone.
“It’s not supposed to be a terrorist negotiation.” Tony reached out to take one of Steve’s hands but Steve shifted so he couldn’t reach it. “I know you don’t want to talk about this. I understand. Jesus, I fucking get it. But, Steve, I love you, and you’re hurting yourself. Look at your reflection in a mirror. You look like a well-aimed breeze could knock you over.”
Peter’s stomach sank, clenching painfully around air and bile.
“I don’t need your help, Tony! I’m not a child. I can work through my own problems without you trying to micromanage or telling me what to do.”
Now, the hunger was a painful throb and all he could think about was eating. All the food he couldn’t eat, because he wanted to change, and all the food he wanted to eat, because he couldn’t eat it.
Steve was watching the movie, completely oblivious.
Tony snapped his goggles off and grabbed a chair from one of the other worktables, dragging it by an arm until he was sitting directly across from Steve.
He found a bus, because no wallet meant no trains or subways, and slipped into the back row before anyone recognized him.
“Hey, monkey,” Tony said, “you and I need to have a discussion about your sleep schedule because I’m kind of done having you pass out randomly. It’s annoying and you’re heavy.”
Tony didn’t know it was possible for him to feel even more depressed, even more wrecked, but Peter managed to do it. Watching the panic and dread flood his son’s face at the idea of eating… that snapped something inside Tony’s chest. He fought to keep it between his ribs and out of his voice.
“I’ll get you set up and then go have some breakfast with our favorite little hellion.”
Cap, Tony and Clint left without further fanfare. The rest of the team made their way down to the reinforced training room. It was their last hope for a place Wheaton and Beckham couldn’t easily get to.
What was he supposed to do? Steve and Tony would notice if he didn’t eat. They were observant. They were superheroes for God’s sake. Superheroes noticed that their kid wasn’t eating.
But Tony kept his body flush to Steve’s, nodding and keeping Fury’s focus on him. The best way to get Steve back was to wait. There was nothing else they could do.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “Honestly, I have no idea. He’s been, uh, working through something lately so maybe- maybe it’s that?”
“Superhero family therapy,” Tony mussed. “Super-fam-apy. There you go. Now it even has a cool name.”
“No, I’m fine. Just gonna get some sleep. Thanks, Pops.” Another steadying breath. “Good night.”
“Wow, his parents really set him up for this life, didn’t they?”
His chest was getting tight.
Once everyone was upstairs, standing around the table like a Comic Con panel, Fury did talk fast.
It was as if Peter’s Spidey sense was tuned in to Tony’s thoughts. His head jerked up and he paled instantly. “No! Dad, please don’t make me-”
It could be so many things.
Clint made a face but it passed. “Okay. Then tell me what you know about this duo that’s going to attack us.”
The second shot snagged onto Tony’s elbow.
Tony mouthed ‘thank you’ and stood up. “No, I’m free, Steve. Give me a minute.”
“Really not digging the low budget horror vibes going on here.”
“Oof! God, kid, are you trying to hug me or take me down?”
“I know,” Steve murmured. “I know.”
“Alright, look out at the skyline with me. C’mon. Turn your back to them,” Steve instructed. “No one’s looking at us. It’s just you and me. Just you and me.”
Peter shook his head and sniffed. His nose was running all over his face. Like a toddler. “No, no. It wasn’t like that. I wasn’t really scared of them. They were young and stupid. I just got scared because… there’s other people like that. People who want to hurt us just because we’re different, you know?”
Hello everyone! I hope your semester and year are going well. Stay safe, self care, read fanfiction, all that good stuff.
“Peter!” Came Steve’s voice. “What are you doing?”
“Your choice.”
“Peter, bud, your cheekbone is digging into my shoulder. It’s not my favorite. Scoot up a bit.”
“Alright, alright. You’re okay, buddy.” Tony carefully pulled Peter’s chair back from the table so he could pull Peter into his arms. Peter refused to move his hands from his face so Tony just wrapped his arms across Peter’s small shoulders.
“I know that, okay? I know all about abusing pills and powders and the happy little substances. I went to AA, Steve. I know.” He caught himself before he could begin chewing on his nails and tucked his fingers against his palms. “I promise. I won’t go above the dosage on the label again.”
Peter finally broke the cycle. With a noise like his windpipe snapping, Peter shuddered and finally pulled air into his lungs. His son’s chest expanded beneath Steve’s hand, the prominence of his knobbed spine and the curved wing tips of his shoulder blades sending bile up the back of Steve’s throat.
Whatever. It was funny.
When they got to the bottom, it was a short wait before Clint arrived.
If he was concussed, wasn’t there supposed to be something wrong with his pupils? But they looked fine. Processing and adjusting to the light.
Steve gave in and dropped a hand on his son’s knee.
Nothing.
Steve glared at Tony’s back before dropping his face into his hands. “I hate it when he says it like that.”
Tony groaned. “I’m going to punish you for teaching him that, Steve.”
Tony checked the room for Ned but he wasn’t nearby. Probably in Peter’s bedroom.
But he needed to try. Steve wouldn’t be magically healed by anything Tony did, but it would get him up, standing or at least sitting.
They were concerned. They loved him. They actually, honestly cared. But all Peter wanted to push his dads away.
Peter’s face went milky when he saw the change in Tony’s face from gentle admonishment to concern. “Yeah?”
“Peter, please, kid. Please. Don’t you
“Peter Stark-Rogers,” Tony leaned over the table, the morning sun reflecting behind him like a defunct halo. “I’m serious. Whatever is going on, you’re not in trouble. But don’t lie to me about it. Don’t sit here and tell me you have the stomach flu or that nothing is wrong. Something is going on, kid. And I can’t help you, Pops can’t help you, unless you let us try.”
To start it off, Steve made some comment about how Peter wasn’t eating.
“Go,” Clint hissed and waved Tony away. “My hand was shit anyway.”
Really bad.
But nothing worked. Peter was unconscious and Tony couldn’t wake him up.
“We saw her, too,” Steve chimed in. “She made her voice sound like yours during the mission we went on a week ago. The one your Dad was following up on yesterday.”
Tony and Steve had a rule that while they were out on a mission: Peter had to be in the tower. No Spidey stuff, no midnight snack runs. In the tower, the whole time.
“Steve. This is about your DNA, your superhero creating DNA. That, in the wrong hands, could start world wars and just as easily end them.” Tony rubbed his eyes and checked over his and Steve’s shoulders. They were still alone. “But… this is also about Peter. Something is up with him, Steve. I don’t know what it is, or if I’m just worrying for no reason, but I need you to watch him.
A man has needs, after all.
About half an hour later, eyelashes and lids crusty with salt, Peter pulled himself together enough to put some lie together. A bad lie but better than the truth.
“Do you have a lot of homework this weekend?” Steve asked.
Everyone was on guard as the elevator door eased open.
Steve chuckled. “Systematic cardiac arrest, maybe.”
And there was no way to get out of it.
Peter leaned into Steve’s arms.
The ringing in Peter’s ears stifled his father’s words. “-hit the roof. I need to go-”
Peter was a great son.
Fury picked at a fingernail, examined it, and looked around. Dramatics were always accredited to Tony, but truly, the biggest drama queen in the group was Nicholas Fury.
“Stark-Rogers,” Tony mumbled to their retreating backs. “Why does no one get it right?”
Their bedroom was the second door off the elevator and Steve all but fell onto the bed, burrowing under the covers with his back to the door.
Steve followed Peter’s line of sight and pulled them back from the window just in time for a missile to ricochet off the glass.
Liz looked up from her fingernails. “Are you done?”
“I didn’t know we had a new team policy.” Clint yelled. He was covered in cuts from the shrapnel and smoky from the explosion. Someone, probably Thor, smelled distinctly of burnt hair. “Do I get a kiss from you too, Cap?”
panicking.
“Peter, you’ve been walking around New York all morning-”
“Hey, Spangles,” Tony mumbled, his voice barely carrying as he pulled the face plate up. One of his eyebrows was split open and bloody foam bubbled past his lips. “Miss me?”
Tony went back to the bathroom for a piece of medical tape. When Peter came to, there was a very real chance he would pull free of the IV and Tony did not want to have to reinsert the needle.
He wasn’t going to save the world if it meant he couldn’t save his son.
It took Steve’s hand on Peter’s shoulder for him to realize they were fine. He was safe. Pops was safe. The bunker floor had held.
“Peter, hey,” Tony pushed the Pop-Tarts to the side and reached for one of his son’s hands. Peter curled his fists against his chest, out of his dad’s reach. “You don’t have to eat them, okay? I don’t want to eat them either. But we need to talk about what you have been eating. Because I don’t think you’ve been eating, kid.”
Steve slouched against the countertop, face drawn.
“Then lift it.”
However, Tony had also bitten his tongue, but he could let Steve examine that later. In private. With a locked door.
“Yeah.”
“Office,” Tony said without turning around. “Just give me a few minutes and then we’ll do stuff.”
Peter knocked his knee into his father’s. “You can’t get rid of me that easy. Besides, someone has to help you make sure Dad doesn’t burn the house down or explode from drinking too much coffee.”
“Steve, we don’t have time for this!”
“I said that’s BS, JARVIS. They always call me during meetings, no problem.”
“Steve, it’s almost five in the morning.”
His appetite came back.
“Hey, Ned?”
Peter laughed but it died off. “Pops, is that-”
“Nice to meet you, Peter. I know your dads.”
Just when they need the good old Green Giant, he’s giving TedTalks somewhere in Scandinavia. The team was just the Stark-Rogers, Natasha, and Clint. Nothing to sniff at, but only a partial assembling of the Avengers.
“Can you tell us what happened?” Steve asked, tone reassuring and calm in a way only Steve could be.
Hello lovelies! The spring semester is underway and I am already drowning in homework. Whelp. Guess it's great I have a stress relieving side hobby of writing fan-fiction then, huh?
“One o’clock. In the afternoon.”
Tony didn’t want to start crying. Really, it wasn’t helping him maintain his dignity. But his vision was blurring in seconds.
Peter looped his arms across his abdomen and squeezed tight, like he was keeping his guts inside through sheer effort. “I- I don’t know what to say.”
Thanks again and enjoy!
Peter’s eyes were firmly downcast.
Steve leaned forward and tried to get his husband to meet his eyes. “What is it?”
“MJ says she hasn’t heard from Peter today. Ditto on Ned. Ned offered me hourly updates, but I opted out.” Tony turned to Steve. “Anything from the team?”
“We’re missing something here,” Clint said, scratching an arrow tip along the wall. “I don’t know what, but… something.”
Peter’s eyes thinned to serpentine slits. There it was. The mean streak that cropped up only when Peter started all of this. Pre-ED Peter would never have made that face. He would have been incapable. “I’m not gonna die. You’re just trying to scare me so I…” But Peter didn’t finish the thought.
“Peter, why did you do that?”
Instead he gave up and cried in the bathroom at eight in the morning.
Steve smiled at Tony, trying to reassure him. “Sorry. It’s cold in here. I’m going to grab a sweater before Peter comes back.”
High pitched, almost girlish, but just deep enough to know it was a younger boy. Familiar.
Peter blushed as Steve began to cackle. “Dad!” he squeaked, “it’s not my fault! Ned used all of mine and I couldn’t find an extra one so I borrowed yours. I was going to give it back next time I went to the store, I swear!”
Tony held a hand up for Steve to wait. “Before we do this… Jarvis, give me everything you have on talking to someone with an eating disorder. I want things to say, things not to say, statistics, treatment plans, all of it. Give me as much as you can in two minutes. Go.”
What if Peter-
Enjoy!
Peter’s arms tightened and he looked anywhere but at his dads. “About two weeks ago.”
“Are you up for some lunch?” Tony perched on the edge of the bed, dropping a hand over what looked like Steve’s calf. It was hard to tell under all of the blankets. “It’s one o’clock.”
Steve shrugged and went to give Peter a hug.
Sometimes, he was just out.
The lockdown floor was a room as wide and long as the tower, give or take a few feet of concrete and some bulletproof bay windows. At the center of the space was a table, large enough to seat a dozen comfortably, and a fully stocked coffee cart.
“Dad, Pops, it’s not what it-”
“He wants one of your suits, Stark.  So I need you to make sure that doesn’t happen.”
He told Bruce everything. The constant passing out, the over exercising, the refusal to eat. Even how Peter tried make himself throw up in the sink earlier. No details spared, no portions glossed over.
films for half an hour before Peter let Tony explain some of the newer projects due to come out from Stark Industries. Peter than convinced Tony to let him down in the workshop so they could play around with some robotics.
“I feel kinda sick.” Peter burped. “Like, really sick.”
Once he was out of the gym, Steve ran back upstairs and slammed his bedroom door hard enough to rattle the door in its frame. It was that or scream. And screaming would just scare Peter more and distract Tony from taking care of their son.
The serum. The quiet.
Progress. He was making progress.
And if anything, Steve was more toned then Peter remembered. Abs defined and swollen, back dimpled, nonexistent love handles. Peter fingered his own waist discreetly so Tony and Steve wouldn’t notice.
Cold. Shaking. Need to get out of the suit. Almost dying from lack of oxygen….
Peter had been gone for a few hours, out on one of his walks, when he came back to find the tower a complete disaster.
Tony smiled. “Oh, birdy. You really know how to hit the spot.”
Tony waved Steve off. “Yeah, yeah. I’m going.”
CW: disordered eating, body image, PTSD, anxiety attacks, violence
The boys had been gone for an hour before Tony pulled himself away from his tablet.
What else would it possibly be?
If Tony’s limbs weren’t sore and he wasn’t so worried about Steve, he might have wondered why it was so easy.
“I’m f-f-f-ine,” Steve reasoned, his voice hoarse and broken. “Just-t a litt-t-le bit c-c-cold.”
“Tony, should we call Bruce?”
Peter didn’t realize he was crying until Steve gently pulled him back and used a clean corner of his t-shirt to wipe off Peter’s face.
Thor walked over and picked up Peter bridal style before Peter could squawk in protest. “Don’t worry, Captain. I have the spider.”
They were added to the pile easily.
“Sup, kiddo,” Tony said without even looking up. “So. What do we owe this early morning workout to? You never get up before noon on a Saturday. Let alone, exercise. What’s up with that?”
Peter would feel like shit afterwards, he knew that, but he was
He was never hostile.
Tony played dumb, cocked an eyebrow.
Ned sat up, his blanket pooling in his lap. “Peter, your dads are Iron Man and Captain America. They’re practically indestructible.”
“Dad, I’m-”
“Come with me.” Tony beelined for the elevator. “Steve, I’m taking Bruce to the workshop real quick. I think I might have something for whatever this turns out to be. Get everyone to the lockdown floor.”
Slowly but steadily, Steve looped the web string around his palms and pulled Peter and Tony up. It was harder than he thought; the slower he pulled, the longer they were out there, but if he pulled too quick, Tony’s limp body might come free from the web strand.
He couldn’t help Pops sleep but he could help him stay awake.
Peter was lying on a bench, sticking and unsticking his foot from the wall. He looked exhausted and miserable and decidedly un-Peter-like.
“The team’s on their way.” Tony supplied. “All of ‘em. Fury sent up the giant ‘A’ for that duo that got you and Steve. We think they’re coming to the tower.”
“If it’s about the mission, I don’t know any more than you do,” Tony prefaced.
Tony showered in record time, barely rinsing all of the shampoo out of his hair. Usually, the jets of warm water between his shoulders were his favorite part of coming home from a mission. Cleaning the silt and soot from his body as the heat eased the tension in his shoulders.
“Spangles, put down the spatula and come with me. We can make more eggs.”
Because it was fun to do, and Peter was a total show-off, Peter tapped the sensor on his wrist and waited until his suit sprang to life. Metal panels shuffling and locking into place soundlessly.
His hands were large, the kind of large that made other men’s hands look dwarfed. They were rough with calluses. Usually, they ran warm.
“I could also tell you global warming is a conspiracy theory, but my morality sense is tingling and I don’t want to lie.”
That his body would need time to readjust to his new caloric intake and the lack of fats and carbs. It was natural.
“Couldn’t sleep. Not after- you know.” Steve melted against Tony, his arms heavy across Tony’s shoulders. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
“Kid.”
genius plan that doesn’t involve those two knuckleheads getting their hands on your tech.”
Steve pulled away first, his lips tinged pink. “Where is everyone else?”
Of course Peter wanted Tony. They were two peas in a pod. Science and math proteges. Geniuses. Quirky, funny. Wild on the surface, in different ways, but kind at their cores. Both open with their struggles with anxiety and able to be there for each other in easy ways Steve couldn’t replicate.
Tony slung an arm around Peter’s shoulders and they walked into the kitchen like that, Peter’s arms hugging his dad tight.
“Hey, man, you good?”
“Friends!”
Steve’s eyebrows knitted together. “Peter that was over twelve hours ago. Why didn’t you say anything before now?”
The front door of the tower slammed open and everyone dropped into defensive positions, weapons drawn. Peter shot up and perched on the wall.
“I-I’m-” Deep breaths were hard. Peter couldn’t get enough air to speak. So he settled for shaking his head. Jarvis had cameras, right? He didn’t need verbal commands.
Peter fell flat on his stomach, hands cuffed around his head. His breath puffed hot and ragged against the cold floor.
It was quiet, it had a lock, and he could spend absurd amounts of time in there without any questions.
He was gonna be fit. Buff. Muscle-y.
Ned nodded, folding another piece of pizza in half and shoving it into his mouth. “Yeah, me too.”
Steve looked up. “Probably the roof.”
His perception wasn’t perfect, but he thought it was coming from the left.
“If something is wrong, it’s better to know now.” Something clicked into place behind Bruce’s eyes.
Careful that Steve could hear him walk over, Tony sat down beside him, trailing a palm up and down his spine. “I’m right here. I’ve got some blankets and thick socks. We’ll have you sweating in no time.”
His dads would find him sooner rather than later if he camped out at the school, but it was better than nothing. He could hide somewhere clever and maybe then they would miss him anyway.
“Fine, fine!” Tony walked off, murmuring to himself before shouting over his shoulder. “I’m getting a clean shirt before Peter has an aneurism. I’ll grab one for you, too,
He needed some space.
Brandon Beckham watched in delight as his girlfriend casually lifted the front of his car, one hand holding the bumper, the other hand under crucial examination.
“It’s not even bleeding anymore,” Tony said, tugging the hood back in place. “I’ll clean it out and bandage it when we get home.”
Peter didn’t look Tony’s way, just scratched unconsciously at his neck and began to pace the apartment. “They should have let us go. We could have helped. Your suit isn’t that broken.”
“I’m-” Peter said, his voice too weak to carry past the doorway. “Pops, I’m-”
“Captain America, as I live and breathe,” the guy said, arms wide in welcoming. “This is my girlfriend, Mockingbird. She’s the one who got you down here.”
“Steve, no one would know to look for this. This wasn’t in the manual the adoption agency gave us. We didn’t know.”
Clint swiped a hand over his mouth. There was still one there, dangling from the corner of his mouth. “You’re deflecting.”
“So, I brought the ancient radio you asked for,” Ned said, holding up a handheld radio from the late nineties. “I also brought Red Bull. What exactly are we doing with them again?”
Peter threw his arms up and bugged his eyes out in an ‘yeah, I know, tell me about it’ expression. “That’s what I want to know! But he’s a shampoo thief, I swear.”
“That’s alright. I’ll clean up. Why don’t you two get out of the tower for a little bit?” Give me some time to get Steve out of bed. Maybe even a shower and some food. All the things he will flat out refuse if there’s even a sliver of a chance Peter will see him.
“I’ve got you, monkey.”
Hands closed on Tony’s shoulders again but this time Tony couldn’t shake them off. “Tony. Take a breath.”
Peter nodded and smiled. The more convincingly innocent the smile, the sooner his dads would leave. “I’ll be fine, okay? Don’t worry about me.”
Tony shook his head. “Not now, buddy. Later, okay? Let’s just let him sleep.”
Enjoy!
Steve was still looking at the stove and completely missed Tony’s harassing gaze. “What would you report me for? Having better stamina?”
By the time Ned came out of the elevator, Peter was dressed and ready for their first event of the night.
Steve had just gone on a walk under an hour ago. “Again?”
Peter needed to run for it. “Man, I really need to pee. Be right back.”
Sorry if this chapter is kinda short and kinda lame. The muse has been giving me trouble lately and I don't know why? Don't worry; the next one is an absolute disaster in the best kind of way. :)
Tony ran up to the cage, fingers tugging at the metal mesh. It was titanium. He couldn’t melt it. He’d either have to lift it up or-
Steve shook the thought away and went to tidy up the kitchen. Anything to keep his mind from getting stuck in a rut that
, like it was vibrating and above to slide off.
Steve grimaced as Tony sighed.
“You.” Steve rolled his eyes again but Tony cut him off before he could speak. “You won’t take your insomnia meds for some reason and you haven’t slept for longer than a few hours in days. Steve, you can’t go on like this. You need to-”
The girlfriend, Mockingbird, slipped out from under her boyfriend’s arm. “I’ll get the stuff, Brandon.”
“It’s so stupid,” Peter blurted. “Please, please don’t make me tell you.”
Steve thought.
Tony wasn’t sure what it was supposed to do but he pulled his son’s eyelids open, looked into his irises. Brown with normal looking pupils.
Except, he wasn’t always out with Ned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony.”
Steve knew getting irritated wouldn’t do anything, just raise the already high tension to an astronomical level, but he himself was getting impatient. “What are we after? We can’t get it or destroy it if we have no idea what we’re looking for.”
His dad was up there when the missile hit.
He kneeled in front of the toilet for ten whole minutes, fingers white-knuckled on the porcelain, as his breaths stuttered in and out. He felt like he was going to vomit everywhere but nothing was coming up. None of the telltale gagging or belching.
Steve mock saluted.
Tony was a shit husband. Lying to get off the phone. The kind of bullshit he used to see Howard Stark do.
The next chapter is going to be heavy with Steve based angst, so be ready.
Peter would’ve grit his teeth but even his jaw was too weak to clench. His whole body was gelatinous from the run. The only reason he was still moving was he couldn’t get his hand high enough to hit the ‘STOP’ button on the machine.
“Wh-what?”
This was harder.
“Um, kind of.”
He lost count somewhere around a dozen but he couldn’t stop himself.
CW: drugging of a minor (villainy stuff), PSTD, anxiety attacks, disordered eating and disordered eating behaviors, discussion of substance use.
“A day or two at most. I let Fury know that I was pissed over having to go at all and I think he understands the longer they keep me tied down, the higher the chance of me going AWOL and abandoning the mission all together, Brandon be damned.”
It wasn’t a yes. But it wasn’t a no, either.
Steve shook his head. “She hasn’t done anything that would prove whether she’s juiced on the serum or the spider bite. I would guess she took after Peter since they came back for a second biopsy and she doesn’t look like she grew or filled out like I did when I was-” he gestured vaguely- “but that’s just a guess.”
Tony was leaving his insomniac husband struggling with PTSD flashbacks with his son who stopped eating.
“He wasn’t asking you, Jarvis,” Steve snapped.
“Dad, you wouldn’t understand, okay? You don’t know- you don’t know what it’s like.”
“Maybe that’s just because running with you is extremely distracting,” Tony quipped. His eyes had found their way from his tablet to Steve. “I mean, honestly. I’m considering reporting you to HR.”
It was wet. Someone had been here, cleaning, within the last few hours.
Well, his head was pounding, so he wouldn’t jump. Also, he felt a little weak.
Regardless of the outcome of today’s mission, he would feel accomplished. Superior. God-like.

almost.”
He was laying on the floor in the Tower’s gym.
Fury rolled his eyes. “I’m sure it is, Stark. Five minutes. Then we need to start brainstorming a plan to get out of this.”
“Peter, you look like a chipmunk with a binge eating disorder,” Tony stated without looking up from his tablet. “Slow down on the brekkie.”
“Yeah.”
“Peter is not an angsty teen.”
But Tony was wrong. If he hadn’t been so focused on Steve and Peter and the shitstorm brewing in the tower, he would have figured it out.
“You too, Spangles.” With that, the phone finally slipped from Tony’s trembling hand. Tony swore when he saw that a corner of the screen had shattered.
Peter couldn’t see Tony’s face, but he could picture it perfectly- cocked eyebrow, slightly scrunched nose, general air of confusion. “Uh, yeah, bud. I’m good. Alright, when you’re done, dinner’s ready.”
It was fine.
The city lights spilled through the bay window, illuminating Peter’s face.
Especially not when he wasn’t breathing.
Once Peter got the suit on, he chanced a look at his reflection.
That was the thought that finally unsettled Peter’s stomach enough for him to throw up.
I love all of you and hope December treats you right. :)
And if Jarvis’s most recent report was to be trusted, Peter had stopped healing.
Steve shifted so his whole body was resting against Tony’s, head pillowed right above the arc reactor. The couch was much too small for two grown men, especially when one of them was the size of a small truck, but neither suggested moving in case it ruined the tentative serenity of the moment.
Peter whimpered but kept his lips pressed together. When he was positive he wasn’t going to scream or vomit from the pain, he nodded to Bruce in appreciation. It was always worse when he knew it was coming.
Bruce ran over and pulled Steve away from the window. “Steve, stop! There’s nothing you can-”
“Right here.”
He didn’t know what he was too late for but he was late
His dad was in better shape than he was. His 100% human dad could out stamina him.
Steve looked confused but Tony knew exactly what Bruce wanted to talk to them about. It was written in the set of Bruce’s eyes and mouth.
Steve stopped to help the older man off the bus before sprinting after his husband. “Sorry about that, sir. We’re in a rush.”
“We’ll find him.”
“I know,” Tony whispered back, a cup of coffee clasped tight in his hands. Steve wanted to say something about drinking coffee this late, or early if you looked at it that way, but now wasn’t the time. Not with everything else on their plates.
Steve didn’t have time to think. He needed to get to his son.
Instead, he slung an arm around his kid’s shoulders and they went into the workshop, no attention paid to the napkin Peter dropped in the trash on their way out the door.
“I can get the cage up for ten seconds before it’ll drop again. Clint, help Nat drag Steve out on my count. One, two-”
“I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.”
Clint pointed a finger at Tony. “Don’t ever do that again. It was terrible.”
Peter was going to help make sure it didn’t happen again.
“I just- I need to change. I can’t- I can’t be in
His spine was mottled like a watercolor from doing sit ups in the dark until he hit the quadruple digits. His hips and lower back were bruised, too.
“Peter. C’mon,” Tony began. “We have to- we have to talk about this. Right now. Whether you want to or not.”
Tony’s brain was built for logic. He was a human supercomputer. Facts. He could think about facts. He needed to focus on the facts.
“Let me get another look at his neck.”
Wordlessly, Steve dropped his head onto Tony’s shoulder, face tucked into his neck, and cried.
Steve chuckled like Tony had hoped he would before palming his eyes again.
Fortunately, they were dumbasses and announced their presence with a good ten feet between them and Tony.
Steve froze.
Nat clearly wanted to ask Peter what had gone on between him and Bruce, Thor was oblivious, and Peter wanted nothing more than to curl up in his bed and hide.
Tony thought about how Peter had been lying on the bench, staring at the wall. Maybe he was just being moody… or maybe it was exhaustion. “What can we do? Besides force-feeding him with a tube.”
With an animalistic scream, like a man being gutted alive, Steve threw his shield against the bulletproof glass one more time and it shattered. The whole panel broke outward and cold air rushed in.
All eight of them were out cold within a minute, some a little toasty from Tony’s lasers.
“Yeah, okay. I’ll tell you what happened in the movie when you get back.”
“Kid, the mission was a bit rough for him. He’s fine, physically, but he just- he needs some time, some sleep. He’ll be out for lunch, all right?”
Tony nodded and sat on the edge of the bed, his knee bouncing. “Steve, something just feels… off. I don’t know what it is but I know something is different. Peter’s been acting weird for a few days now. On edge. But not the usual anxious on edge. It’s different. It’s…
Maybe the mission, and the cold episode, has gotten to Pops more than Dad was letting on.
“Dad, what?”
But he made it.
“C’mon, c’mon. Think Stark. Fucking think!”
“C’mon, kid.” Tony said, moving so he was sitting directly in front of Peter, the gentle hum of the arc reactor the only noise in the room besides Peter’s staccato breaths. “In. Out. Slowly. You can do it.”
“Yeah, yeah. Loud and clear.”
Tony waited. He wanted to cut Peter off- tell him he was wrong, he would understand- but Peter needed to get this off his chest.
“Tony-” Steve started.
“Why are you so moody right now?” For anyone else, the question would be snide or patronizing, maybe even both. From Bruce… it was genuine.
Fury raised his eyebrows and whistled. Bruce was chewing on his lower lip to remain composed.
This whole thing was weird. First, Peter says he’s feeling fine and he looks physically fine. Good color, good mood, all the green light signs a parent learns to read. A bit pinched and panicky, but that’s Peter. But now, Peter says he’s nauseous.
Peter was trying to decide if the black spec on the sidewalk was an old woman or a millennial with poor posture when he saw the next missile.
“Kids these days.”
Clint glared but did as instructed. “Do you need something or are you just here to boss me around, Stark?”
… but I’m so- I’m so cold… And I-”
They looked like a couple you’d see wandering out of a campus Starbucks, not a tech millionaire and his suiter.
Tony crossed his arms, his foot popping up and down like a jackhammer as he glared into Steve’s eyes. If he had lasers like that guy from X-Men, he would have burned two perfect holes in Steve’s blemish-free forehead.
Enjoy!

“Do you need anything?”
Jarvis reported.
One bite, a small triangle of fluffy, warm, pancake dripping butter and syrup…
“Where did Ned go?” Tony finally dared to wonder aloud. He was currently burning bacon and eggs and needed to know if he was making slightly crispy food for two or three.
Metallic footsteps cracked across the concrete flooring as Tony ran.
Peter was in shock because his dad was supposed to be across the country, fighting bad guys. Not staring at him across the hall like Peter was breaking his heart with every second.
Nat punched him in the face, knocking him out, before Tony could stop her.
Peter facepalmed. “Just use one of the clean towels under the sink in my bathroom. Don’t waste all the shampoo. You’re bald, dude, and you always use all of my shampoo.”
One bite turned into two bites. Three. Five.
And that itself was terrifying.
“I’ll tell you about it later. Bad couple of days.”
Now that he’d done it, it didn’t seem like that big of a deal. Going a full day without eating was something people did all the time at school. Ned did it accidentally on the weekends at least once a month.
“C’mon, Dad,” Peter whined. “I’m not-”
“Do you know how many people would kill me, kill all of us, for that?” Steve whispered. Tony stopped fiddling with the bandage. “Dozens. Hundreds. Maybe even thousands. People would start and end wars over what I let some teenager take last night.”
Steve paled. “Did I hurt you?”
“Well, then you give me no choice.” He slipped the mask on, strapping it into place. “I’ll just have to knock you out for it. Don’t worry, the brain damage from lack of oxygen will be minimal.”
Peter’s moody façade broke and for a moment, he looked like the old Peter. The wannabe hero with too many thoughts and feelings to put into the world at once so his words always came out rushed and packed. “Why are they coming here? They already got Pops and I. No offense, Dad, but you don’t have any powers for them to replicate.”
That was enough. ‘Space’ was something they all understood. Tony gently pulled Steve closer to him and further from their son.
Peter felt a hint of guilt. He knew he was upsetting his dads by pushing them away.
Steve took a deep breath and let it out. No stuttering. "I know you do."
Four sips.
Peter smiled, his eyes just a little too wild. “Nothing! I just didn’t want you to figure out how many of Steve’s moon pies I ate.” Peter patted his gut. “I might have caught diabetes.”
Peter took the subway home despite Steve’s hatred of anyone in the family using the subway. Tony would have sent their driver, but Happy was busy prepping the quinjet.
He couldn’t stop the conversation Tony had begun that morning, but he could sure as hell delay it.
Because Peter was scared, and there was nowhere else to go, he did just that.
Painstakingly, Peter peeled his suit down his shoulders, careful not to let the fabric slip past his hips. He didn’t want Bruce to see the ugly way his stomach fat pooled on his lap when he was sitting.
“I’ve got an even better idea. Back up all the computers on my server and wipe them. You can reinstate them after Tweedledee and Tweedledum are back on their way to algebra. Or prison. Whichever comes first.”
Steve was still shaking when Tony got back, his hands tucked beneath his arms. His lips were turning purple, then blue. It wasn’t warm on the quinjet, they were flying after all, but there was no way it was cold enough to get past the super serum. Something was off.
“Peter, you-”
Peter’s room was closest to the elevator, so Tony tried to check on him first. The door was locked.
Tony rubbed his face, careful of the cut above his eye. “Come sit. I promise. I won’t bite you or anything like that.”
“Oh, he fell asleep,” Peter said, absently tracing the coffee maker’s rim with a finger. “We stayed up late watching all of the
“Can you- can you pop them back-”
Peter was so cold. His hands and feet were bright red, his cheeks flushed.
But he didn’t want to have to eat something else. That was worse.
It didn’t work. Peter went back to sticking and unsticking the bottom of his foot from the wall.
He had seen it. Not often, but once was all it took to put the thought in his mind.
He would need his fingers to find and insert the needle.
Peter was curling up into his ninety ninth sit up when someone knocked on his door.
Fury walked over to the elevator just as Tony instructed JARVIS to take them up to the explosion. The metal doors clanged shut before Fury could reach them.
Peter just sat there, breathing. Trying to breath.
“Steve, before you say anything, I know I didn’t handle that situation in a great way but I’m trying to keep track of how much he’s eating so he doesn’t keel over. And it’s a lot more difficult to do that when he’s pouring things down the… what is it?”
Tony and Steve were sitting right by the plane’s exit door when Clint and Nat came by, each saying something low to Steve that Tony couldn’t hear. Nat touched Steve’s shoulder and Clint smiled before they disappeared down the ramp and into the Tower.
Peter stood up and gripped the bedpost when his head swam. Damn, the dizziness felt worse today than yesterday in the exercise room. He needed to drink some water before he did something stupid like pass out in front of his dads again.
“Tony, I’m fine,” Steve said, tone already inching toward defensive. “Just a lazy day, I guess.”
“This was a distraction.” Tony smashed the elevator ‘up’ button. “There’s no one here because they’re trying to get to the lab from the roof.”
Tony scowled at Clint before he could stop himself and Clint’s hands flew up in surrender. Both Nat and Clint’s eyes changed from humored to apprehensive.
S.H.I.E.L.D. could deal with the amateur goon. Tony wouldn’t leave Steve.
“Peter, there’s something else.”
“Kid.” Tony turned to his son, taking him in. Peter’s hair was still dripping down the sides of his face from his shower. Maybe it was just the refraction of the light in the lab, but Peter’s cheeks looked sharper. So did his jaw.
Peter wasn’t…
“Where is this coming from?” Tony snapped. “I’m trying to help you.”
. Peter looked one punch away from a nap. “It’s going to be fine.”
“Do not go out as Spider-Man. No exceptions. Am I clear?”
“So, what? We’re just sitting ducks until they get here?” Peter piped up. He was rubbing his scar, worry spread across his features even as he fought to stay stoic.
“Hmm. How about next time you leave the dregs in the bottle so I can work on the formula and make sure we don’t have any dregs next time?”
Steve had dropped his head onto one of his fists, stifling a yawn with his free hand. His eyes looked more sunken than usual. Less alert.
“Why does Fury need us on this?” Tony swatted Steve’s hand from picking at the healed scar where Brandon had gotten him a week before. “Can’t he just call in birdy and our favorite murderous redhead? What about Rapunzel and the not so jolly Green Giant?”
Steve leaned in, kissing Tony softly, before wrapping his arms around his shoulders. “I’m glad you’re here.”
Ned couldn’t understand because he’d never seen it.
Tony slid the door shut behind him with a soft
Jarvis said from inside Tony’s helmet. “
Tony took another deep breath, ran his hands down his face, let the breath out.
“What about drinking this?” Tony held the bottle up, waving it enticingly. “Just to give you energy to burn.”
Footsteps came down the hall and toward him. Tony could’ve started crying when Nat’s familiar red hair came into view.
Fury sighed and rubbed his eyepatch. “The bad news is that Beckham’s girlfriend, Liz Wheaton, now has a mocktail Spider-Man cocktail in her bloodstream. We’re not entirely sure how they did it or how long it will last, but we’re sure she can do everything he can. We also have footage of her imitating Steve’s powers but that only lasted a few minutes. Whatever Beckham did the first time, didn’t work long term. We have no idea if this Spidey potion will last or not.”
“What about that bodega he used to get sandwiches from? He went there almost every day last summer.” Steve offered, tucking his hands further into his jacket pockets. An icy breeze was coming off the Hudson and Steve could feel the cold in his bones.
Nat nodded and Tony made his way back to Steve.
- a syringe caught him at the base of the neck and he didn’t stand a chance.
“Peter, you’re smarter than I am, so I’m not going to talk down to you. I’m not going to lie to you. You know that you’re human and not human at the same time. While Pops’ serum and the bite are different in many ways, they are also incredibly similar. One of those ways you and Pops are the same is your metabolism. You know this.”
There was no choice.
“Uh, sorry, um, Mr. Stark-Rogers. The serum being produced is a bit more like Mr. Banner’s than yours.”
His stomach growled at the smell of toasted bagel.
Peter was out in this weather without shoes or a coat.
Peter’s eyes flicked to the carpet for a second, maybe not even a full second, but that said it all. “Dad, what are you-”
He moved his palm up, just a few inches, so it was right over his ribs.
Bruce gave in and chuckled. Tony went to smack him again but Bruce was too quick.
Steve shook his head and clenched his fists. “Do you want me to talk to S.H.I.E.L.D.? If it makes you feel safer, I-”
They just sat there for a while, Tony’s hands roaming the planes of Steve's back and arms and over his hair. Pushing heat into Steve’s skin with every brush of his fingers. Reminding him that he was here, in the tower, not on the plane or in the ocean or on the ice. He was with Tony and no one could harm him while Tony was around.
need to be carried! I’m fine!”
Brandon slipped his phone into his back pocket and threw his hands up. “I know, I know. You’re right. I just wanted to commemorate how sexy you look with superpowers.”
Eight. Hundred. Calories.
“How the hell did they just disappear?”
Hello everyone! Sorry this chappie is a few days late. I went away for a COVID-19 safe vacation and the wifi there was terrible so I'm just able to edit and post this now. Don't worry; I'm still on track to have a nice update ready in time for this Sunday.
Tony’s mouth stretched into a firm line and he rubbed his forehead with a clean part of his left wrist. “Steve, I have been sleeping less than the doctor recommends since I was a teenager. I know it’s not healthy, okay? I know. But don’t tell me that because I’m not perfect I’m not allowed to worry about you. I don’t sleep because I’m an asshole to my own body. Why you’re not sleeping… it’s different. You know it’s different.”
“I’ll do CPR. You get us out.”
Something shifted in Tony’s eyes when he realized Peter was on the verge of a panic attack.
“You know,” Steve started, dropping his fork and rubbing his forehead. “I know I’m not Tony- my brain doesn’t work like either of yours, I guess- but you can still tell me about school and that stuff. I may not understand it, but I’m happy to listen to it.”
The radio was just so they could try and pick up mission updates from his dads and figure out what they were doing.
For the umpteenth time that week, Peter wondered why he had to look the way he looked. He didn’t mind his face; nothing special but nothing horrifyingly repulsive either, but he had never loved his body. He was too small there, not big enough here, and just an awkward-looking doofus when next to his dads. Like the ugly duckling, but instead of a duckling next to two swans, he felt like a malformed baby dodo plopped between a hawk and a bald eagle. Well, Steve wasn’t really the bald eagle type, more an aggressive duck, but whatever. The point stood.
“I’m serious.”
The words alone made Peter’s vision dance. The sight of the iconic silver foil in Tony’s hands made it worse.
metal suit? Yeah, great plan. Leave a human tank behind so someone doesn’t try to take the weapon. That’s like refusing to take a gun to a street fight because you’re worried someone will snatch it out of your hand.”
“Woah, there,” Bruce reached out and steadied Peter. Sitting up was more difficult for Peter than it should have been. “Did you hit your head?”
Hefting his shield at eye level, in case someone was waiting beside the door frame, he stepped into the hall. It was completely empty, too.
“Uh, yeah, sure. I can’t wait for you guys to come. Next time. Again.”
Steve shook his head and tightened his arms around Peter. Peter was still cold, too cold, but he wasn’t shivering. That had to count. “Sorry. What were you saying?”
- and it felt like there was no way to stop.
Something felt wrong, but Steve couldn’t put a finger on it. Sure, there was a high chance this was a trap of sorts, Steve knew that. He fought in wars, dammit. He knew a basic trap. This felt… different.
“I can’t melt it. Titanium.”
Greetings from the pile of homework I have been living under these past few weeks! I hope the school year/work year/pandemic is treating all of you well. I personally have been pretty stressed but I think it'll start to get better soon. Darkest before the dawn and all that jazz.
Peter was… he wasn’t eating. He was exercising excessively. He was passing out and sleeping more.
“What’s wrong with him?” Clint asked, a few stray sesame seeds stuck to his lower lip. As if the subject of Clint’s inquiry was in question, Clint motioned to the morose teenager sprawled on a bench.
Clint let Fury and Bruce in, checking the hall before clicking the assortment of deadbolts and traditional apartment locks. Seven or so locks for one door.
The last one wasn’t a real option, but thinking about it made him feel less trapped.
“Coming! Just a second!”
“Actually, I do need something.” Nat lifted a single brow. “It’s Steve. Whatever the hell that guy did to him- it’s messing with his head. I need blankets, sweatshirts, anything to get him warm.”
Peter’s eyes were both open now, sleep wiped from his face as anxiety crept in. “Which one?”
“I’m going to make you take deep breaths again if you don’t-”
romance
The hand on Peter’s shoulder went still.
Bruce’s brow furrowed as he clasped his own elbows. “That’s the bad news?”
“Pops, you’re covered in tomato sauce.”
“that’s it. He has everything he needs. We cannot risk that happening.”
“Pops! I just want to see how big it is!”
movies in one night,” Ned said, voice indignant. “It’s not for the faint of heart.”
People always said karma was a bitch but Tony saw karma as more of a conniving motherfucker with impeccably poor timing.
Steve raised an eyebrow but waited until he had swallowed his food before speaking. “You just felt like it?”
“You’re not doing this.” Tony threw his hands out, shrugged. A ‘what can you do?’ gesture. “I’m not going to let you play the superhero blame game. No free passes in the Stark-Rogers home.
“Nothing is going on-”
The first stray tear trickled off of Peter’s jaw.
This was one of the parts Peter hated most about his diet. Not the sore stomach or permanent headache. The fogginess wasn’t great but he could handle that, too. Even the times where he was in the same room as food he really liked (food that
Of course he wasn’t eating. It was spaghetti with meatballs and Peter
Fury stared at Peter, then Tony. “I can see the family resemblance,” he quipped, totally deadpan.
Tony shook his head and smirked half-heartedly. “Maybe he’s doing it for a girl.”
No one was the wiser that Brandon had cracked the science behind Peter’s spider bite the night before, half a pizza roll dangling from his mouth. No knew that Liz had been writing her intro to sociology essay as Brandon hooked up her IV.
Clint didn’t even look at Nat’s cards. He just slammed his own down, let off a string of expletives that had both Tony and Nat chuckling, and walked off.
Once Peter finishes this run, he will have burned a good chunk of his breakfast off. He would be back on his way to superhero fitness.
“Oh, shit, Steve.”
Peter had panic attacks. He had nightmares. He was generally anxious, and messy, and forgetful, and all of those double-sided words that Tony loved as much as he loathed.
“But we’re not talking about me!”
“Bleeding?” Peter grumbled. “Why is my- holy crap! Dad! There was this lady and she changed her voice so she sounded just like Pops and then she… oh my god!”
Steve clasped his hands and dropped his chin against them. “I don’t think so. He doesn’t seem depressed. But it isn’t his usual moodiness either. I can tell when he’s feeling weird because he didn’t sleep enough or because he’s fighting with his friends. This isn’t that.”
“That was back when I was going with you guys!”
“We’ll figure it out, okay?” Tony set his coffee cup down and took Steve’s hand in his own. “Right now, let’s just go try for another hour of sleep. It’s early and Pete won’t be up for a few more hours at most.”
He was going to change it.
“Where are they?”
Peter was staring out the window as Pops, Bruce, and Fury spoke in hushed tones around the table. If Peter wanted to, he could focus in on their voices and listen to what they were saying, but so far, they were just strategizing, and it was boring.
It didn’t occur him until after Jarvis had beaten him four times to check on Peter. Concussions and impromptu naps weren’t an ideal combination.
“Yeah, it is.” Tony whispered. “It’s exactly what it looks like and that’s okay. Not okay that it’s happening, but okay because we’re going to help you through it.”
Thor nodded grimly. “We need to be inconspicuous.”
Sorry for the missed Sunday (and the short update) but college is upon us and I got overwhelmed with moving in and trying to write. Hopefully, with everything settling down, I'll have a nice long chapter for next Sunday.
If he ate pizza… he would need to find a way to undo it. Just like this morning.
“But Dad! If I- If I go to therapy, they’re gonna make me-”
“No, I’m serious!” Steve bodily spun Tony around and Tony was embarrassed that it… did things to him… to be manhandled like that. “Isn’t that the billionaire’s girlfriend up there?”
Tony fought the different urges firing off in his brain:
Peter had been in a complete panic when Jarvis was about to disclose his food intake for the previous day.
On that note, the three of them finally walked into the main room of the tower. Tony was three feet ahead  of Steve and Peter, mentally going over everything Jarvis had said.
He reached a steel door. Knocked on it a few times. It was a thick, solid. At least six inches, maybe more.
special and disappeared back into his workshop, mug abandoned on the kitchen counter in favor of the full coffee pot.
“Wow.” Tony glanced up and scanned Peter’s face. “Yeah, I don’t buy it. Count me out. What is actually going on? A girl? A guy?”
The footsteps stopped.
Some of the milk sloshed onto his fingers as he began to lift the bottle. He watched the liquid hit the floor. Good. Calories lost.
“Pops?”
“When I’m…” Peter fell to the side, his words tilting with his vision.
Steve groaned. Great. Clint and Tony were already getting started with what he and Nat liked to call their ‘thing.’ Basically, both of them reverted to their teenage roots and acted like a pair of roosters with their chests puffed out.
"I've got you," Tony whispered before kissing the side of Steve’s head and running his hands along his bare shoulders. Steve had slumped over the lip of the tub, pillowing his head on his forearms. Tony’s hands, warm and steady and
“I’m deflecting.”
“Okay,” Tony said. “Okay.”
“Especially for you, Spangles,” Tony mumbled. “I could watch that ass on a Stairmaster for hours…”
“Great. This is just fucking great-” Clint continued.
He could just curl up and die now, thanks.
It was crazy but it was real.
“Peter!” Steve dropped down beside him and pressed his ear to Peter’s chest. His shoulders drooped. “Oh thank God. I thought he was-”
Multiple lessons.
Tony tightened his hold on Steve’s shoulders with one arm and ran his other thumb over Steve’s flushed cheekbone. “We could always start again. Why don’t we watch a movie tonight? You, me, and Peter. Some Chinese food.”
Nothing.
I have a SECOND update for this week. That's right; two days after the last one. What can I say? This chapter was both easy and terribly difficult to write.
Seeing his dad worry about him was the worst. The light going out of Tony’s eyes when Peter couldn’t eat the Pop Tarts. The pinch of Steve’s mouth when Peter threw away his pizza and feigned illness. The unclouded horror as Peter revealed that he had programed Jarvis to erase data.
“Where are you going?”
“Maybe Nat has some of that in her bathroom.”
Just impulsive.
Midsentence, the smell of hot pancakes hit Peter, square in the face, and his stomach
“Dad, I drank all of it. There were, uh, um, some, like- you know? Dregs! There were dregs collecting in the bottom and I hate those so I just poured out the last sip or two because of, uh… dregs?”
As soon as Peter cleared the jagged edge, he stuck himself to the floor to anchor his body and to free Steve’s hands to pull Tony the rest of the way up. Maybe the pain was numbing Peter’s brain, but it looked like Steve was fishing. Reeling in the web for what was stuck at the end.
If that bitch did something to his son, she wouldn’t live long enough to regret it.
The rest of the flight passed placidly.
He grit his teeth and screamed when the web connecting him to the building pulled taut. At least one of his shoulders came out of the socket. Maybe both. His dad and the building were using his body as a bungee cord.
That cracked Steve’s face into a smile. Small and strained, but a real smile.
Tony and Steve stood there, both eerily quiet and pensive.
Peter did just that. He would never admit it but watching Tony stand with difficulty and limp toward him… it took a weight off of his chest he hadn’t realized he was carrying.
- without shoes on?”
So maybe that was where some of the panic was coming from.
Natasha rolled her eyes and cracked her knuckles. “This is obviously some sort of trap.”
Nat hushed them. All Tony could hear with his own breathing and the occasional whir of his suit. The air was eerie, dead.
any minute now.”
It didn’t help that the mission was still lurking in the back of his mind. Something was wrong. They were missing something. Something big. Something-
“No, no. It’s fine. Don’t apologize about it. Just let me-”
One of Steve’s hands came up to the side of Peter’s face as Steve kissed his son’s forehead. Peter would never let him do that if he was awake.
Someone currently fleeing the scene a few miles down on the beach, tract marks along one elbow, blond hair whipping behind her back.
Shit.
“So you what, Peter? Tell us what you’re thinking.”
“Tony?” Clint came rushing down from end, bow lowered, with Nat at his heels. “What the-”
Iron Man had been on the roof.
Peter glanced up in the floor-length mirrors lining one wall of the gym. Watched as he drank half the water bottle, as his stomach filled and bloated. He sucked it in. Even while breathing shallowly and holding his organs in as tight as possible, he wasn’t as toned as Tony. He certainly wasn’t as buff as Steve.
“Never.”
Tony glanced up at Clint, phone to his ear, and cocked an eyebrow. They were in the middle of a game of high stakes poker while Nat took one for the team by letting the rookie from S.H.I.E.L.D. debrief her. She was then going to repeat the useful bits to Tony, Clint, and Thor. Rapunzel himself would meet them on location.
He was beginning to nod off when the crack of his jaw smacking into his chest woke him back up.
This was the only way to get Peter to understand exactly what was going on.
“That’s your plan?
“Tony,” Steve admonished, “now is not the time.”
die on me.”
Peter would never let him play with his hair like this while he was awake. Now or never.
Peter was finally going to look like a hero. Like one of his dads.
Tony chuckled and went back to his phone. Good thing he had enabled Jarvis to play checkers.
Steve’s face broke into a smile. “Sure. You pick.”
“Peter, talk to us.” Tony begged.
Dinner.
“Where’s Peter, Jarvis?”
All of it helped Peter to forget that Steve was fighting a battle two blocks away. To forget the tendrils of tension snaking between him and his dad.
Tonight, every second under the spray was another second to stress over Steve and Peter and everything happening here.
. But he couldn’t feel his arms or upper back. His head was swimming.
Steve sat up and fingered the scar along his neck. A nervous tick he had picked up recently. “Jarvis, how many has he done?”
It was Tony’s turn to fidget. “Oh.”
“Superpowers make a girl hungry. I said bagels.”
Peter had lied about his meals to both Steve and Tony.
“Go check on our son, Tony.”
Peter didn’t have the strength to scream this time.
He could finally help keep
Grimacing in pain, he carefully lifted himself up again.
Peter rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. He was being carried like a baby. He wasn’t going to be mature about it.
It was hard to leave Clint and Nat out cold on a stairway, like ripping himself in half, but he had to keep going, even if it was a trap.
“Last chance.”
Peter dropped his shirt and turned his back on the mirror. It didn’t matter what he looked like now.
Nat shrugged and walked off to find the lab.
without the Avengers knowing first.” Before he could stop himself, Tony smacked his fist against the wall. “
24 hours. Peter hadn’t eaten in 24 hours.
Was Peter…?
Steve put a hand on Tony’s neck and kneaded his fingertips into his wire-tight muscles. It helped, a little.
“So, um, the base is set up- like this.” The agent tapped at his tablet and a holographic layout of the area appeared level with their eyes. “It doesn’t look like much, but that’s because the majority of the structure is underground.”
“I won’t ask you to sleep, Steve. I want you to, but I won’t ask you to,” Tony whispered against his husband’s hair, his breath rustling the golden strands. “But I will make sure that when you want to sleep, or when you need it, I’m right here with you from when you fall asleep until you wake up.”
“Are you two done now?”
“No, no, no. You can’t- you took the sticker off so I couldn’t read what was in it. It’s probably a thousand calories or something and you just- you just want me to…”
CW: disordered eating, PTSD, anxiety, substance use/abuse
Tony didn’t react at first. He didn’t know how to.
“I have no idea. But I’m going to text Fury from the car and get him to find out.”
“I’m not moody!”
They only realized the infusion had worked when Liz’s fingers began to stick to her laptop keys.
“Fine.”
As irritated as Tony was that he couldn’t work right now, or at least work off some of the caffeine pills he swallowed twenty minutes before Steve fell asleep, he wouldn’t trade his position for anything.
It took a few tries for the words to make it past his lips, but Steve finally whispered about a hot bath.
But they did. Tony couldn’t leave them to handle this one on their own. Steve’s DNA was in the hands of some trust fund brat with a God complex and that was not a promising sign for the future of the human race.
“I know.”
“Steve? Hey!”
Almost immediately, his gag reflex kicked in. If Tony wasn’t sitting a foot away, his eyes boring into Peter’s, Peter would have spit it back in the bottle. Given up and beelined for his room.
Unfortunately, Bruce now had the time to do a medical exam.
The quicker Peter woke up, the sooner Tony would have to make him eat something. The scenes over the last few days ran through his mind. Peter bursting into tears over plates of food he would have devoured only a few weeks before.
“Talk to us. Tell us what’s been going on with you.”
“Fresh air is good for the soul, Tony.”
Peter nodded and finally sat in one of the chairs, pulling his feet up onto the seat so he could drop his chin onto his knees.
But there was no one there.
Tony looked up at him incredulously. “We need to find Peter. What if she was here for him?”
Tony pulled away and sat at the kitchen table, gesturing for Peter to take the seat across from him.
Steve crossed his arms and stuck his chin out. “Wrong about what?”
“No.”
A nice rooftop lounge. There were plenty of Queens rooftops empty this time of year. He could find one near his school and relax until he was ready to go back to the tower.
Peter rolled his eyes. “Dad drinks too much coffee.”
“Peter!”
Ned shrugged, eyes glued to the slasher flick they were watching. Someone was stabbed on screen and the bright blood spray sent red flares dancing across Ned’s eyes. Ned himself didn’t react at all to the gore. “My soul is a void only filled by the talented cooking of Italian grandmothers.”
Well, not in the clear so much as putting off a meltdown.
They sat like that for a while. Tony checking his phone constantly for an update from the team. A text detailing how the crooks squatting in his tower were being charged. Maybe even a selfie of Steve with some local first responders or bystanders. Steve was always kind to the selfie people.
“Then let’s go.”
“Yeah, I’m okay. Thanks, though.”
Tony carefully pulled Steve into his arms so his head rested on Tony’s shoulder. He was a heavy deadweight but Tony held him tight like he was weightless.
Tony helped Steve onto the bench they had been sitting on earlier. “Take some deep breaths for me while I go find some jackets or blankets, okay? I’m serious. Deep breaths.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter rolled his eyes. They had been friends for over a year before Peter had the courage to tell Ned who his parents were. It had been six years since they met, and Ned still treated words out of either of his fathers’ mouths as gospel.
“What was Peter doing at the school? And how did that lady get the drop on him?”
With a groan, he pushed himself up to his elbows and tried to piece together what happened. But Peter’s arms were slick with sweat and sent him back down to the ground, landing on his jaw.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I told you to cut that out. None of it, okay? This isn’t your fault, it’s that pre-pubescent asshole’s. I’m going to be right back.” Tony kissed the top of Steve’s head, smoothing his hair. “Hang tight.”
Peter was gone before either parent could say a word.
He didn’t process running or pushing the door open or falling to his knees by the crumpled form at the back of the room facing the wall.
while making dinner?” Peter shrieked. His dads were so gross. So, so, so
Fury picked specks of concrete and ash off of his all-black outfit. He looked like a malignant shadow. “Not yet, but we will.”
Some sort of alternate reality.
“Ned!”
Steve shook his head. “Your dad didn’t take the sticker off to hurt you or force you into anything.”
“It’s just nerves,” he mumbled. “Calm down, Stark-Rogers. It’s a mission just like any other one.”
His vision swam as Mockingbird, who was much more than a tech billionaire’s girlfriend, rolled him onto his back and smiled down at him. She was still wearing her Greek letters with her blonde hair in a perfect messy bun.
Peter finally settled on an empty classroom in the newly renovated honors section of the school.
Tony pulled a blanket over both of them.
Sometimes, Tony really hated being a hero.
“Pops? You okay?” Peter slid down so he was right beside Steve. “You look kinda pale.”
He settled deeper into the couch, kneading his palms against his abdomen. Maybe he felt sick because he was worried about his dads. Maybe it was just because he ate two greasy pieces of pizza. Maybe… maybe… maybe?
Especially if Tony was right, and Peter’s weird weekend was a sign of an eating disorder.
Dinner was a shit show.
Nothing.
Steve and Tony exchanged some sort of parenting look.
“There’s one over there.” He held out his arm and Liz’s fingers looped around his elbow. “We’ll get you a snack and then it’s time to hit the tower.”
With a grimace, Steve grabbed a jacket and went out.
How did he…?
“Uh, I don’t know. Dad, how am I supposed to remember what I ate yesterday? I don’t even remember what I ate for breakfast.” That was a lie. Peter could list off every single item with perfect accuracy if prompted. With the amount of mental energy he dedicated to food, he could probably tell Tony his entire dietary history for the last week.
“And then there was one,” an ominous voice purred over the loudspeakers.
Unfortunately for Steve, Tony was just as worried and confused and clueless as his husband.
After backtracking, wandering, and backtracking some more, the thud of slamming doors echoed clear enough for Tony to pinpoint the direction.
Tony nodded but couldn’t bring himself to smile in return.
“No, Peter,” Tony said. “He’s not.”
But maybe that was it. Maybe Peter just didn’t want Steve; he wanted Tony.
. “Nah, I’ll just have some with dinner.”
Fortunately, Tony didn’t comment on how the astronomy project sounded suspiciously like a
“Well, fuck me,” Tony whispered and rubbed the back of his neck.
S.H.I.E.L.D. had labeled her a non-threat.
“He was a pulse.”
Peter rolled his eyes when his dads shamelessly began kissing.
Skipping meals for whatever reason… it was a bad habit. A dangerous habit.
“No, no, it’s- it’s not like that!” Peter coughed into his fist, gasping for air like he was coming up after a long swim. “Pops, it’s not-”
But he also needed to deal with this particular issue
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter let them hold him. Let his dads touch his hair and hug him like they had done back when we was a scaredy cat toddler with his thumb in his mouth.
“Water. Keep him hydrated. If you can get him to eat something, anything- do it. I’ll keep an eye on him, too.”
Tony unplugged his suit from the wall and the cage slammed back into place hard enough to shake the ground beneath them.
As much fun as flustering Steve was, Tony actually did need to get out of the suit and figure out how bad the damage was. Jarvis said the wound wasn’t life threatening unless left untreated. And Steve was such a fucking Boy Scout he had first aid training.
His appetite had never left. He’d just curbed it, controlled it.
Ten minutes later, Peter came out of his bedroom, hands tucked into his sweatshirt pocket. He was wearing oversized sweatpants and fuzzy socks. He was trying to disappear in all of the fabric and it was working. He looked smaller, frail.
Peter closed his eyes and took a small sip.
“Maybe we got lucky and they left with all the goods before we showed up?” Clint suggested, reaching back to notch an arrow before he remembered he still had his first one. He hadn’t even shot anyone yet. “Tony, I’m getting a bad feeling about this.”
Peter made a ‘sort-of’ gesture with his hand. “I have a paper for English. The rest I got done last night.”
Steve shook his head, his hair hanging in front of his eyes, fingers still unable to get the zipper to budge. “No, no, I’ve- I’ve got-”
“And I didn’t notice,” Steve murmured.
“And what is that? Glaring personality flaws?”
The panicked look in his eyes didn’t escape her notice. “Uh, no thanks, Aunt Nat. I’m not hungry.”
Steve’s arms were big and warm and enough to block out the world for a few breaths.
“Peter…” Bruce’s cold fingertips touched the soft spot between his shoulder blade and spine. “What happened to your back? It’s covered in bruises.”
After taping the syringe in place, Tony adjusted the flow of the saline and held the bag tight in one fist. The other hand he busied toying with Peter’s hair.
“Peter, it’s not-”
“Tony, I’m sorry. I just… I don’t know what to do and he- Tony.” Steve’s voice dropped even lower. Quiet enough that Tony barely heard him. “He looks thin.”
Natasha let loose a slew of Russian curses as Steve went burgundy.
He had to find him.
“I know. I… I know.” Tony pulled back. “He locked the door. Did you get him to…”
Peter had pulled his hands off. He hadn’t wanted him, his own Pops, to touch him.
Steve finished brushing his teeth and came to sit beside Tony, squeezing his husband’s knee before kissing his forehead. “I see it, too.”
Peter disappeared into his room before the first tear trickled down Steve’s chin and he was none the wiser.
Right.
Tony didn’t know if it was his place, knew for a fact that Steve would be pissed to hell if he told Peter. But there wasn’t a right answer because if he told Peter, Steve panicked. If he didn’t tell Peter, Peter panicked.
Steve’s eyes burned a bit more.
The dumb kid wasn’t even wearing shoes.
Peter shook his head. “I’m fine over here, thanks.”
He dropped the suitcase at his side and typed furiously with both thumbs while looking Peter in the eyes. It gave Peter the creeps when he did that. “Is Ned going to spend the night here with you?”
But he wasn’t and they both knew it.
Steve’s nod of encouragement and ‘here, take more’ didn’t help. It was easier to eat with Steve watching his every move. Peter could tell himself it was to convince Pops nothing was going on, instead of the truth, which was he was trying to fill the gaping hole sitting below his ribs.
Nothing.
“Why don’t you start by telling us how long this has been going on?” Tony said, nervously toying with his wedding ring. “When did all of this start?”
The gears turned, the hypothetical ones Tony always pictured when he thought of the inner workings of his own mind.
“Pops, they’re all watching us, aren’t they? So much for Spider-Man. More like Spider-Baby.”
The bathroom.
“Just… just eat something, okay? Anything. An apple, a carton of ice cream, one of those energy drinks you turn into slushies… just something. Please, kid.” Tony stood up and glanced behind him.
Tony lost all communication with the team the moment he burst through the door of the main building. Just like that, comms went dead.
“Alright, alright. Come on. Let’s find you something to wear.”
“Okay, fine. The office was getting boring and I’m hiding from paperwork.” Fury pointed his chin at the elevator. “Get the rest of the team up here so we can discuss strategy. These two can’t get into Avengers tower.”
Instead, he collected all of his self-control and ran after Tony. “
Tony jabbed his fingers up under his son’s jaw. Shifting until he could feel the steady beat of Peter’s pulse. Not as strong as he wanted it to be but present.
One of the people was a young guy in a UCLA sweatshirt and skinny jeans. He had shoulder-length brown hair, half of it pulled up in a topknot. Beside him was a blonde girl no older than twenty. She was wearing a hot pink, oversized t-shirt with Greek letters on the breast pocket and black leggings.
“Jarvis, where is he going?” whispered Tony when he finally found his voice again.
“Help me find something to get them out,” Tony yelled, his fuse lower than usual.
Honestly, so could their son, but that was nature, clearly. Not nurture.
“Wait… you’re gonna make me go back to therapy?”
Tony took Steve’s phone and zoomed in. It was Brandon’s girlfriend lifting a car off the curb the same way Steve lifted the couch when he vacuumed. “Do we know what kind of powers we’re dealing with here?”
What did Steve have in common with them? Why would Peter possibly want Steve when Tony was right there and easier for him to be with?
Steve shook his head and ran a hand over his hair before crossing his arms. “He kept telling me he felt sick, so I let him go to bed. I wasn’t getting anywhere.”
“Peter, we weren’t ready then. We’re ready now.” Steve looped his arm around his son’s neck and felt warmth pool in his stomach when Peter’s arms locked around his hips in response. “This won’t be anything like last time.”
Something about last night felt tense and wrong. Like Peter not eating had given Steve a piece to a puzzle Peter didn’t even know his dad was trying to solve.
Without warning, Steve sprang up and hit the glass with his shield.
Steve’s body sunk back and he dropped his forehead against Tony’s. “You’re such an idiot.”
On Steve’s mark, they ran (or flew, in Tony’s case) out from the cover of the trees.
Steve hated that an all-knowing AI was watching them, even helping them plan out their sex life. But it was also extremely convenient because Peter still hadn’t walked in on anything. Ever.
Tony grimaced. Of course it was. “Just tell me, Steve.”
The agent looked about ready to grab a backpack and jump from the plane. Anything to escape Tony’s stare. “The serum isn’t what we’re after.”
Bruce gave him an incredulous look. “What happened? He’s lost weight and looks like he’s a couple minutes from a nap. Is he sick or something? I thought the bite kept him from getting sick. Like Steve.”
“Neither can you.”
this.
A few minutes later, Peter fell asleep.
Steve sighed and opened his eyes long enough to find Tony’s. “Thank you.”
Peter had no idea where he was going.
“We’re here if he needs us, okay?” Clint offered. “All of us.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony, stop acting like this is about my DNA. You just don’t want me to break down ag-”
Tony rolled his shoulders to loosen the tension. “I don’t know what they want. Fury and his team are trying to figure it out as we speak. All I know is that we need to be ready for when they show up.”
There wasn’t a manual for this kind of thing.
Tony cocked an eyebrow at Nat before turning back to Hawkeye. “Uh huh. Clearly you’ve never been around my son when we’re out of his favorite cereal. You would think his pet chihuahua had died.”
He didn’t want to be with Steve right now. Not because he didn’t want to help or be there for him or any of that. Because he didn’t want to feel useless and Steve’s episodes had the surreal ability to make Tony feel totally useless within seconds.
Wordlessly, Steve moved Tony aside and kicked the door of the school open, wood chips spraying across the floor as the door jam splintered.
He wasn’t dumb enough to do it, and even if he has done it a few times, his alibi was always rock solid. First step: have a reliable witness. “Yeah, Ned will be here in a few hours. We’ve got plans.”
Steve melted into Tony’s arms a little. “I’m still mad at you, Tony.” But his words didn’t hold any of the venom from before. They were breathy. Exhausted.
“Peter, I will not be in the presence of Iron Man looking like this.”
Tony thought,
Peter rolled his eyes. He only threw up because he got on the treadmill after breakfast and big meals don’t agree with distance cardio.
“Birdy, what are you doing with that?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Different type of doctor but I’m glad your ego is doing well. Can you just let me see it?”
In the end, Peter and Tony were instructed to stay back, no questions asked. Bruce said something about Peter needing the rest and Tony’s suit was damaged as it was.
Steve clasped his own hands tight against his stomach as Tony talked Peter down. Steve was useless in these situations. Completely and totally useless.
The Stark-Rogers home was in shambles and there wasn’t room for Tony to be stuck in his head. He wasn’t allowed to take a mental health day himself because every day was either a mental health day for Steve or Peter or the both of them.
Another breath.
Tony was shameless in everything he did. It didn’t stop with how he expressed his love. “I love you, too, monkey.”
Ned grinned. “Comic shop? Collin told me if I brought you in and you sign something, he’ll let us read all of the new Avengers comics, free of charge.”
Nat shrugged. “I don’t think he knows so I’m gonna come up with a number before he gets back.”
He was alive.
Tony gently pulled himself out from under his husband and made his way upstairs.
Before he knew it, his plate was empty and he leaned back in his seat to rest both hands over his very satisfied gut.
Steve didn’t say anything, just sunk further into the couch, arms tight over his ribs.
Steve and Tony were standing there, thoughts racing, when Jarvis cleared his throat to get their attention.
Tony didn’t fight when Thor gave him a bone crushing hug, just pat him on the back until Thor put him down.
It was about midnight and Peter still couldn’t sleep.
Steve with so much blood dripping down one side of face from a head wound that Peter thought he had lost an eye. The wound was closed and a thin white scar a day later, but the sight of all that blood… Peter saw.
He gave both Steve and Tony hugs and assured them time after time again that he would not be going out as Spiderman.
Peter wasn’t Peter today. He was scared, and on guard, and irrational. Tony had to put Jarvis under strict instructions not to let Peter leave the tower because he was worried Peter would climb out a window.
Peter’s hands had crept up over his face but Tony saw the minute nod.
Peter smiled but it didn’t reach past his mouth.
Working out always made him extra hungry so Peter piled his plate as high as possible before sitting back down at the table.
“Finally,” Clint murmured.
Thor put Peter down once they reached the room and Peter scampered a few feet away as soon as his feet found the floor. He was determined not to let anyone else pick him up.
Tony was falling too fast for Peter to reach him. Peter was more aerodynamic but Tony was heavier and had a head start.
“Shut up and hug me back.”
the person to lecture me on-”
Man, he was really soaked.
He took another minute to gather his thoughts, and to recover from the head rush of lurching in and out of the mirror’s view, before making his way to the elevator. They always waited in the lobby for the rest of the Avengers.
“I’m going to be home as soon as I possibly can, Steve. I promise.” Tony didn’t have any reassurances. He didn’t have any advice. He didn’t know what to do. This wasn’t nightmares or panic attacks or PTSD. There wasn’t a S.H.I.E.L.D. mandated training module on what to do when your son… when Peter needed help with something
If they stuck to the plan, Steve was currently coming through the back while Nat and Clint took the second floor from the sides. Black Widow and Hawkeye would take out whoever was upstairs and flush everyone out while Steve and Tony waited on the main level.
Four and a half hours.
The overly bright florescent lights of the gym weren’t helping him to focus in on his Pops’ face. Peter blinked until Steve’s worried eyes and locked jaw came into view. “What happened? Jarvis said you passed out on the treadmill and flew across the room.”
“I’m just confirming the facts.” Tony waved a hand up. “No, wait, I’m sorry. I’m confirming the
Sure, part of it was probably the Spidey metabolism. He ate more than the average teenager. He knew that.
Tony thought. That’s all it was, right? That’s all.
Peter’s knee started twitching. “Dad, I’m telling you the-”
“Nat, he’s-”
“Get the rest of the team up here now. We’ll figure out a way to stop them.”
Steve hadn’t moved since he came in earlier.
“Birdy, you’re covered in seeds.”
“Clint, why don’t you worry about funding your own brats’ college instead of worrying about my kid? Because I think Nat just smoked your ass again and you’re going to need to tap into your savings for that one.”
Skipping a few meals with the super metabolism Steve and Peter possessed? Dangerous.
Peter wouldn’t finish the protein shake.
Steve rolled his eyes and yawned. “You’re so dramatic.”
Carefully, Tony rearranged Peter so he was laying on his back, arms at his sides.
Tony was torn. Because if he left Peter here, let him slip away even further, even faster…
“Sorry, I- uh- I had headphones on. What did you say, Pops?”
Steve shook his head. “Tony, I endangered the whole world today. Me. Because I-”
She nodded and, without warning, took the everything bagel from Tony’s hand and took a huge bite.
Both Tony and Steve caught on to that.
Slow down!”
Steve looked a bit crestfallen at that. “Oh. Like robotics and stuff? Yeah, you and your dad are way ahead of me when it comes to that stuff.” Steve’s tone wasn’t dismissive or mean but … resigned.
Everyone had a different theory on how to go about this. Clint voted they wait it out. Force Beckham and Wheaton to come out of hiding. Nat thought that was a terrible idea because it gave the couple too much time unsupervised in the tower. Plus, they might be able to outwait the Avengers since it wasn’t like Earth’s mightiest heroes could simply take a vacation break and camp out in Nat’s loft.
Steve gave Tony a pointed stare before Tony could cross over from snarky to snappy. Happy was trying to distract them.
“Pops!” Peter yelled, pain leaking into his voice even as he tried his best to tamper it down. He couldn’t see Steve through the fire and debris but he knew his father could hear him. “Pops, pull us up! I can’t. I think the strain pulled my shoulders out of-”
The footsteps started up again, running. But this time, they were getting quieter instead of louder. Whoever this guy was, he was on the move.
Tony was still fixed on Peter’s fully stocked plate. He hadn’t eaten much at breakfast either. Maybe he was coming down with something. “Do you feel okay?”
He loved them a little more for it.
“Peter-”
“Peter, you’re soaked,” Steve said, “How long were you down here?”
Steve nodded.
But more importantly, Peter had revealed this information in order to hide what he’d been eating. Or, if Tony was on the right track, what he hadn’t been eating.
Nat rolled her eyes at them and went back upstairs to help the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents clear the upstairs.
When the tub was full, Tony helped Steve get to his feet and shakily strip out of the many, many layers he had crammed on. Every layer of clothing removed sent a wave of tremors through Steve’s body.
“Oh, uh, science stuff. It’s kind of hard to explain…”
Steve closed his eyes, breathing in the heat and lavender of the bath one last time. “Tony.”
Peter went off to his room to fetch his suit without looking back.
Steve’s lip curled a bit and Tony was taken aback by how mean Steve looked right now. Steve was a lot of things but he was not mean. Not until right now. “This is not some sort of terrorist negotiation.”
Steve’s eyes cracked open and he smiled, a flicker of his lips that never met his eyes. “I’m alright. Just catching my breath. Your dad… it scared me. The thought of losing either of you...”
It always worked when Tony did it.
“Just really need- well, needed to pee.” Stupid. So, so stupid. “Uh, is everything okay with you?”
It was a bad omen.
Spaghetti was high enough in carbs for a few bites… but a plate? Two plates?
He would be just like he is right now. Maybe not sitting with his forehead resting on the (hopefully clean) rim of the toilet and his knees trembling against the tiled floor. Hopefully not.
He was laid out on the ground, cheek against something cold. His head was pounding and his fingers splayed over something hard and smooth. Hardwood.
Tony followed Steve’s finger and watched as a beautiful young woman ran across the roof of the school and leapt to the ground like the fall was nothing more than leaping off the bottom two steps. The fall should’ve broken her shins and knees on impact. Instead, she kept running, disappearing between two brick apartment buildings in a flash of pink.
He didn’t want to be crazy.
But he couldn’t even do that because someone had blown up his bed. Literally.
“He had that huge crush on the other intern at Stark Industries and never exercised for her,” Steve added. “Actually, he used visiting her as an excuse to get out of working out with me.”
Tony dried off, slipped into some clothes he could sleep in, and went back to the bedroom.
“I don’t think he’s in the mood for a sandwich right now,” said Tony.
“That’s okay. We’ll worry about it in the morning. C’mon. I need to shower and then we can try to-”
“Fine people don’t cry over Pop-Tarts, monkey,” Tony said, his voice barely carrying. He looked emotional himself. “But it’s okay not to be fine. I just want you to tell me what’s going on so we can find a way to get back to fine.”
It was Tony. Tony was so much harder to fool than Steve, even through a bathroom door. “Yes?”
He would have thrown up if there was enough in his stomach to throw up.
There was a metal door, same as the one he burst in through, on the other side of the cage. All Tony could see were beat up sneakers as the door latched closed.
Peter was reaching five miles on the treadmill, sweat speckling his forehead, and decided to call it, take a break. His heels were sore and he felt dizzy when his feet finally found solid ground. He should have drunk water before he started running.
“How’s your head?”
Steve was the odd man out. A second choice father.
Steve yelled, checking all the classrooms on the first level as Tony beelined for the stairwell.
“You would if I let you-”
Peter cocked an eyebrow before it clicked.
Pillowing his head against his arm, Peter tried to sleep.
“Maybe we should be.”
“Try telling him that.”
Peter’s mind screamed.
Steve’s fingers traced over every inch of Tony’s body in a markedly non-sexual way. Below Tony’s ribs, on his left side, was a large purple patch of bruising. At least none of his bones felt broken. Just bruises and the cut on his forehead. Steve was overreacting.
Good luck everyone with schools opening (both digitally and in-person)! We may be living in a pandemic, but hey, at least we have fanfiction to see us through, right?
“Babies don’t count.” Peter yawned.
They sat like that for a minute, both lost in their own worlds before Peter shifted and dared to look his dad in the eyes. “Is Pops okay?”
It wasn’t hard to find a pair of government-issued sweatpants and a white t-shirt in the back of the jet. Their missions always involved weapons and fire and dirt. Extra clothes were a must.
He wasn’t dressed to be on the run.
Tony didn’t say anything back but Steve could tell he had heard him.
Steve settled one of his palms between Peter’s shoulder blades. Firm pressure. Low stimulation. Privacy.
Tony picked up a clear saline bag, an IV needle and tubing, some cleaning wipes, and a smelling salt.
“Pops, I feel sick- I think I ate something bad at breakfast.”
“Steve, giving someone a trust fund and a name like that… you’re giving them a golden ticket for super-villain-ry.” Steve was not entertained. Harsh crowd. “But I digress. There’s no way I’m letting him anywhere near you. None. Not again. Not after last time.”
When Tony reached the school, he was out of breath and sweaty. His heart was smashing into his ribs and he was on his way to an anxiety attack. But there wasn’t time to stop, to catch his breath, to calm down.
Bruce laughed when he saw the unbridled disgust on Peter’s face.
“We all saw it.” Tony motioned for everyone to huddle around the table. “Change of plans.”
But Fury and Steve had the same reason to vote none of them went back to the tower: Tony was wearing one of his suits and it was damaged. The suit Tony had on him was probably Beckham’s best shot at getting the tech. They would be walking into a perfectly laid trap and Tony would be the bait.
“Do you know how many pictures I take a day in that sorority house, B?” Liz grinned and spoke through her teeth. “Dozens. Dozens of pictures. Forgive me for not wanting to pose for yet another
“Coming, Pops!” Peter replied and emerged from the bathroom. “Hey, can we watch a movie while we eat?”
“Why did you stop taking your meds?”
A hint of abs rippled, the barest evidence of that weird muscle ‘V’ girls at school gabbed about during PE. But nothing in the face of Steve. He never saw Tony shirtless- the scars and machinery in his chest made his dad a bit self-conscious- but Peter’s mind could conjure up an image of Tony that made him just as toned as Steve, just more wiry.
“I thought it would make it easier,” Tony murmured.
Tony coughed and smiled up at them. “My fortune and diplomas would fight you on that one but I’d be happy to review your thesis.”
“C’mon,” Tony gestured and all three of them quietly made their way down the hall.
indestructible. Not totally. “They're still destructible, though.”
Tony shook his head, running his fingers over his facial hair. “No. Not yet. Peter will want a chance to work on
Tony took a long sip of his coffee and wished it had a little more kick to it. But he had promised Steve he would stop drinking. Peter deserved better than a drunk for a father and he wasn’t going to have a repeat for the incident a few weeks back. “Do you think it might have to do with his birth parents?”
Clint chuckled from the kitchen.
Peter was pigging out-
Tony took a minute to collect himself by the door before going back to the kitchen.
“Nothing.” Because Tony couldn’t explain it. It was an electrical current popping along his spine. A voice murmuring that he needed to get to Peter
Tony smiled coyly. “Full of dastardly ideas for how we can spend this time, practically alone…”
Tony watched it all with a plummeting stomach.
But Tony didn’t slow down. His arms pumped like pistons, his designer shoes slapping against the grimy sidewalk.
and he didn’t have the mental space to lie right now.
Help Peter first, question Nat’s stash later.
The agent nodded, his forehead damp and eyes deer-wide. The kid was maybe twenty-five and probably new to the job. Steve was more inclined to show compassion because of that.
. “Alright, I’m ready to take this guy out and go home. Ready?”
“Twelve hours,” Tony mumbled to himself. “Twelve hours.”
“No!”
Tony crossed his arms and stared at his son, incredulous. “Excuse me?”
A few hours with Peter prattling on about school and his classes while Tony worked was exactly what Tony needed. He was three (or four) cups of coffee in, had grease under his fingernails, and his son was helping him program a robot.
Peter shrugged. “Nothing. I just felt like it.”
Steve’s palm was cold.
Still-
Steve and Tony were getting ready for bed when Tony decided to break the silence.
It was embarrassing.
As always, content warnings are at the end of the chapter and I must warn you... the content in this chapter and the next one get pretty heavy
Instead of calling him out on being a dick, Clint started to circle the room from the other side.
“How’d the mission go?”
Tony didn’t know what this meant. Didn’t know what she wanted, if she had figured out what made Steve super, or was super herself and looking for a way to mass-produce it. All Tony knew was
Peter’s smiling face was all he could see.
“Just trust me. It’s a gut feeling.”
So, naturally, Peter bit his lip, glanced down at his food, and burst into tears.
He could-
At the bottom of the steps, Nat was the first one who heard the air canisters deploy.
But it felt harder when things like this happened. Things that confirmed what Steve had known the first time Peter showed promise at a science fair or watched a horror movie without flinching.
Tony shook his head and Peter’s chest hollowed. He felt like his heart was going to stop any minute now.
His bare feet slapped against the concrete sidewalks of Manhattan as he pulled his hood tighter to hide his face. This outfit wasn’t suited for the eleven o’clock news, either, and he couldn’t risk being photographed right now.
“Was that an archer pun?”
So Peter gave up and popped the top.
They sat there, letting the silence wrap around their shoulders and calm the air. Tony stared down at his hands, Peter trembled against Steve’s side. It was an interlude to the second half of the confrontation. The half that Tony worried might kill him. Not that there was no choice. If Tony didn’t do it… it could kill his son.
“Can I… just- take a break?”
Still soft. Still pliable.
“I’m sorry, sir. Master Peter instructed me not to say.”
Then it was just Nat and Thor and Peter.
He looked like an average teenager who loved pizza. Not a superhero.
“Tony, should we go after her?”
“I would be if you smiled.”
“Of course my back is bruised.”
Tony and Steve discussed news and business, giving Peter the cue to tune out.
Peter woke up around ten am. It was an early wake up for a Saturday morning, but he wanted to get some time in the gym before his dads made their way down here.
“Thanks.”
“Yeah, what’s up? I, uh, I did what you asked Dad so can I-”
Steve tried to push the thoughts of what could be wrong with their son to the back of his mind and followed Tony back to bed.
“Easy. You don’t want it to start bleeding again.”
“What Pops is trying to say,” Tony interrupted, “is keep your grimy, street child hands away from the open wound.”
Peter hated that smile.
What if she-
He didn’t want to go back to the way things were. He didn’t want to be soft, weak Peter
Steve nodded. “That’s a given. I’m going back, too. So is your dad.”
Half an hour passed by and absolutely nothing.
Tony slid up behind Steve, his hands slowly creeping up Steve’s chest before gravity attacked and they began sliding downward. “Better stamina. Hmm. Maybe we should test your stamina.”
“Peter, how can you say that?” Steve asked, his exhausted eyes searching his son’s. He knelt in front of Peter so they were about level. “You’re not pathetic. You’re a city-wide hero and you haven’t even finished high school. You have a mind that rivals, if not surpasses, your dad’s and he’s the smartest man I’ve ever met. You’re kind and funny, two things the world could always use more of. You are not pathetic.”
Clint opened his mouth to speak but the glint in Nat’s eyes stopped him from saying anything.
Tony knelt beside Steve and waved him off. “What the hell happened?”
That was a very bad omen for the rest of their mission.
“Tony!”
Tony could barely make out the shivering lump leaning against the bathtub.
Peter shook his head. “I’m not talking to you for a couple of minutes, Pops. I’m kind of scarred.”
Steve slowly let the mug clatter to the counter, the rattling of the ceramic on the granite subsiding once Steve released the handle.
They always did.
Until JARVIS reminded him that it was one in the afternoon, time for lunch.
!” Tony yelled in a singsong tone.
Peter’s cheeks flushed as he set the bottle in the sink, arms crossing. “Dad- what are you, uh- what are you talking about? Exactly?”
“Guys, it’s us,” came Bruce’s voice through the door.
“Yeah, sorry,” Peter said. It felt right to explain it away. “I think it was just anxiety or something.”
Parenting was hard. Steve knew that.
As soon as the doors closed around them, the words bubbled out of Tony like a dam bursting.
Steve didn’t move, his eyes still focused on the wall of their bedroom.
“So, what?” Tony objected, “You’re gonna storm the tower like the knights of Camelot and leave me here to twiddle my thumbs and protect my
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter reasoned, fingers already shakily picking up his fork.
“You've got to be fucking kid-” Tony started.
How was Peter
“Sleep.” Tony said. “You need sleep. I need sleep. Peter needs sleep. All of us need to wake up in the morning with clear minds so we can have a serious conversation. This isn’t going to be something you can be foggy and exhausted for.”
There were two things in the room that didn’t belong there: a pile of manila folders and a Black man with an eyepatch, his feet kicked up onto another chair.
He hated working out when they were down here.
“Steve?”
Steve’s cheeks went scarlet as his eyebrows cinched. “I do not smell-”
But he could change his body. He could fix that.
“We’re got a mission to complete.”
He started crying over his dinner.
Skipping a few meals while human? Unhealthy, bad habit, the newest ‘diet fad.’
“He needs to start eating again.” Bruce conceded. “Actual spiders can go a month or two without food if they’ve been eating regularly and have access to a water source. But I’m going to guess, since Peter is a combination of human and spider genetics and is much more active than an actual spider… He’s going to start slowing down. Getting drowsy and lethargic.”
“Peter.” Tony shook his shoulder halfheartedly, still invested in proving Jarvis couldn’t beat him in five games. “Wakey wakey, kiddo. I forget naptime isn’t allowed for people who took a cement wall to the face.”
“Either way, we’re pretty sure she’s got Peter’s powers now and-”
right now.”
painting itself on the inside of his eyelids as Peter realized the voice was Steve’s but the steps were
Peter wasn’t getting enough air. He was panicking. But Tony couldn’t stop.
Tony hated that smile.
Tony practiced his sign language and Clint gestured right back.
“Let me help, okay?”
“If it doesn’t send the kid into a fit, tell him hello from me, too,” Tony murmured as he walked toward the elevator.
The elevator doors opened before Tony could say something sappy back. Thank goodness. Tony was still dabbling in emotional vulnerability and he wasn’t sure what to say.
Steve clicked the bedroom door shut and sighed. “It’s Fury. We’ve got a problem.”
Pops thought that Peter wasn’t telling him about school because he thought Steve was too stupid to understand it.
Tony popped another anxiety pill. It wasn’t a wise choice, overdoing it always made him sluggish and flat, but right now it was necessary. He could worry about himself once he wasn’t worrying about Steve or Peter. That was how this went.
, but there was no logical reason to keep Tony from touching Peter. Tony loved Peter just as much as Steve did. He wouldn’t hurt him.
It took almost a dozen tries for Tony to find and properly insert the needle into the vein. Peter’s inner elbow resembled a pin cushion.
“What can I do for you right now? I can draw a warm bath, get some blankets, a mug of tea…” Tony pushed Steve’s hair out of his eyes and tried to get Steve to look at him. The meager lighting wasn’t helping him establish eye contact. “We can sit right here, too. Whatever you need.”
Steve felt anxious for an entirely new reason while he pulled his clothes on, struggling to get the fabric over his damp skin.
It wasn’t like he shoved some fingers down his throat or something.
He yelled but no one answered. Not Steve or whoever he could hear walking around in there. The footsteps were too light, too uneven to be Steve’s.
“That’s okay. I’ll bring you something after I feed the monkey.”
Thor’s brow furrowed. “But you said-”
“Oh, Pops, no! It’s not like that. I just didn’t want to talk about it because it gives me PTSD just thinking about it.”
“Cut that out,” Tony snapped. “That is not what this is about.”
“Why don’t you just let me check you out and you can talk to Tony about whatever you think it is he said to me once all of us are out of this situation?”
Ned was snoring, mouth hanging open, when Peter opened the bedroom door.
Peter pulled off the hood of his suit so Bruce could check his pupils and how well his eyes tracked the doctor’s finger.
Peter still wasn’t breathing.
Flatter. With coarser ripples than before.
The suit fit different. It wasn’t as tight in certain places but it was straining to contain him in others.
Both Tony and Steve felt they knew too much about bad memories returning.
he got back. When Tony could help watch Peter and make sure whatever his son was going through was handled with all the sensitivity and care Tony wished his own teenage angsts had been handled with.
Steve’s skin had been kind of sickly for a few days now, a combination of lack of sun and lack of sleep. Now, it looked ghostly. “They make me dream. Ever since that mission… It’s all I dream about and I can’t keep dreaming about it.” Steve’s eyes with flints of steel when he finally made eye contact with Tony. “Now, what’s your story? I’ve been watching you and you’re taking more than your prescription recommends when you think I’m not looking.”
“Peter, you’re covered in sweat,” Tony said like it was a question. “Since when is distance running your thing?”
“You’re lying.”
“Uh, just a minute!”
Tony bit his lip. If he could trust, or wanted to trust, any of the Avengers with what was going on with his son, it was Bruce. Bruce was a doctor, for starters, but he was also careful and sensitive. Maybe he would actually have a clue about what to do.
Hello everyone! It's been a while since I've updated... I know. Sorry about that.
Tony’s mind raced but he couldn’t put the pieces together. Steve’s suit wasn’t damaged. And while it was tight, Tony had designed it with comfort in mind. “Probably? Is your suit bugging you?”
Peter had fallen asleep.
That just made Peter cry harder.
“Are you saying that because you’re upset we’re not out there fighting or because you’re worried we’re going to talk about you know what?”
The silence around them was tense and coarse, like barbed wire.
Tony smiled. “I’m pretty sure Ned would do anything I asked him to. MJ will sell Peter out because she thinks it’s funny.”
Tony got home during that fuzzy hour of the morning where he and Steve sometimes passed each other in the bedroom, Steve, getting up early, Tony, going to bed late.
“Maybe it’s because of the recent mission,” Tony murmured. “Clint got hit in the head right next to him. There was a lot of blood. Do you think he’s struggling with hero stuff?”
“Steve?”
When Peter woke up, Jarvis was talking. Going on and on about something or other in his gratingly monotonous tone. But Peter couldn’t understand anything over the ringing noise in his ears.
And Peter liked making Pops happy, so he kept talking, even when Tony came in for another cup of coffee and shot him a ‘
“I’m coming, Steve.”
“Clint, you go with Cap and Tin Man,” Nat instructed. “Fury, take the doctor. I’ll try to sneak Peter and Thor in through an alternative entrance. I sent all of you the address. Cap, you guys go first. We’ll leave in waves.”
And we're back with another chapter! This one felt a bit like a filler chapter (sorry everybody!) but I promise, I'm setting things up for a big, big problem our boys will just have to figure out.
, Dad! I’m not you! I’m not Pops! I can’t be like you guys- brave and strong and
Steve shrugged. “It could be. But he hasn’t had a panic attack in months. Once we put Osborn away, the attacks stopped cold turkey.” He pondered it a moment longer. “Besides, he doesn’t seem anxious. He seems tired.”
“JARVIS? Where’s the kid?”
“Kid!” Nat ran over. “We’re trying to…” Her eyes darted between Peter and Bruce, reading their body language. “What’s going on?”
Hey everyone!
Peter couldn’t speak. There was no way in hell he was telling them he was crying
“B-but Peter-”
“The serum-” Steve’s voice cracked and Tony caught himself before he could say something placating. Steve hated that. “The serum makes me superhuman. Capable of more than the average person.” At this, Steve rolled over to face Tony fully. His hair was in complete disarray and there were pillow marks on his cheek. “Tony, I lost consciousness in under a minute. That’s less time than it would take for a trained, non-serum human being. This guy won because I had a panic attack and knocked myself out before you, Nat, and Clint could get to me. It was my fault.”
Because Steve was taking a nap, and while getting sleep was good, Mr. Righteous and Right sleeping during the day was a red alarm if Tony had ever seen one.
Peter shook his head furiously. “No, it’s not going to be fine! Last time you guys went up against these people- last time you-”
Bruce was a terrible liar. “Nothing. Why? What do you think he said?”
His legs were too shaky to run.
.  “Just got a bit dizzy. Sorry, yeah, I’m good!”
“Wait, Tony, is that-” Steve pointed up to the roof.
Tony’s chest went tight and he put his hands over Steve’s shoulders. “Hey, hey. Let me help, alright? You know I love nothing more than getting you out of your clothes. It’d be my pleasure.”
. He needed to earn his last name.
Steve wasn’t smiling with him though. He was grimacing. “Tony, this is serious. Taking extra meds isn’t-”
Steve’s eyes were barely open when he managed, “Sleep.”
He swore and rapidly scanned the room for some clothes. He had done the sit ups in his underwear to keep his clothes from getting all sweaty.
Peter threw his hands up and groaned. “I’m practically an adult! I don’t have to tell you every time I get indigestion.”
He held his shield over his eyes until he could make sense of his surroundings. Outside the cage was a square room, no bigger than their living room at the tower. Which, to be fair, was pretty big. The walls were a dirty grey and the floor, like he thought, was fresh concrete.
“Yeah, I love you, too, Tones.”
With one final tug, Steve pulled Tony up and onto the floor, his usually sure hands fluttering over the singed and dented surface of the Iron Man suit as he tried to find a way to get his husband out of the armor.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked in the mirror one more time.
“Finally,” Clint murmured and held up his bow, arrow taut against the string. Nat lowered into a fighting stance and Tony held up a palm, laser warm and aimed.
Steve yawned. “So mad.”
Why he being so neurotic about this? He was full. He didn’t need more food.
Tony shamelessly popped a Xanax before making his way into the living room.
“Peter.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but Steve was right. Even though he was trying his hardest not to show it, the breaths had worked. Steadied him. He didn’t feel like he was going to vibrate out of his skin anymore.
His dad was hurt. Maybe it was really bad, maybe it wasn’t. Peter couldn’t tell and didn’t know.
It was so selfish that Tony’s neck flushed from embarrassment over even thinking that.
Steve nodded, fingers fisting into his hair. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I’m sorry about this.”
Launching both of his metal fists off of his hands and at the goons, they were both taking a nice long nap courtesy of metal plated uppercuts within seconds. Tony scrambled to get his gloves back on and began to cut at the door again.
“It didn’t seem like he was upset about the thing at the bookstore.” Steve had a foamy toothbrush in one hand while the other one ran over his hair. “Peter doesn’t get upset about that stuff. I mean, just the other day, he and Ned were actively seeking out those exact people at the comic store to torment.”
Before Steve could ask what he meant by that, Peter’s head snapped to the window. “Someone’s climbing the building.”
“Hey, Jarvis?” Tony asked. “Tell Peter when he gets out of the shower to meet us up here for family breakfast. Make sure you let us know when he’s on his way, though.” Tony’s lips ghosted over the shell of Steve’s ear, his breath warm as whispered some ideas for their morning that involved burning breakfast and other very anti-Steve sentiments.
His dads were so
Steve smiled again, and this time, it was radiant. Authentic. “I can see the headlines now. ‘Eccentric Billionaire Burns Down Manhattan Skyline With Burnt Coffee Beans.’ We would be even more famous.”
Tony’s voice reached their ears just as another missile whizzed past the window and arced into the glass a few floors above them.
“Yeah.”
Eyes carefully positioned so he couldn’t see Nat and Steve beyond a colorful spot in his peripheral, Tony ran over to Clint.
All three men looked at Peter.
Tony looked Peter over, head to toe. He didn’t say anything. Just shared one of those parenting looks with Steve before turning to call the elevator up.
Steve never called him during a mission unless it was important.
Steve was already sleeping.
“That depends.” Tony didn’t want to say
“I know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After finally getting the suit off and rubbing some warmth into Steve’s arms, Tony made quick work of helping him into the sweatpants and shirt. It was a testament to how far from now Steve was, that he allowed Tony to dress him.
“Oh, you like that, do you? Sexual predator. I swear.” Tony reached up to flatten a lock of Steve’s hair that was sticking straight up and rustled the blanket. When the blanket fell further down Steve’s shoulders, Tony saw that the bandage covering Steve’s missing skin had been picked free. The wound was angry and pink and definitely not sterile anymore. “Oh, shit. Steve, your neck-”
Peter woke up early to exercise?”
Clint whistled. “I don’t think his nose looked like that when we got here.”
As always, thank you to the beautiful, kind folks who leave kudos and write reviews. All of you help make writing this story easier and I can't thank you enough for that.
This was Peter’s chance. He could prove that he was a hero, just like his dads, and he could do it without even leaving the tower.
Tony’s suit with a chunk missing from the back. Wires and sparks and blood. For days, Tony couldn’t sit down all the way without ripping his stitches. Steve had to help him in and out of bed.
Steve didn’t react.
“Very true.”
“You were perfectly fine with us going to the tower seconds ago, Stark,” Fury added.
At first, Peter thought it was because Tony was too stubborn to admit that Peter had better endurance thanks to the spider bite, but recently, there was evidence that it was because his dad was genuinely in better shape.
The cold episode was over.
“You might want to teach him not to do that.”
It was a long ride to Queens.
“Peter will be fine.”
“He’s breathing but he’s still unconscious.”
“This has gotten pretty messy, hasn’t it, kid? It all started with a mission and now here we are. You and me, in Nat’s secret apartment, as I perform emergency first aid because you refuse to take care of yourself. Totally out of character for you, monkey. Usually, you and Pops are the ones ensuring I take care of myself.”
Scared beyond recognition?
They sat there for a minute, Steve’s thumb tracing the knob of Tony’s shaking knee as Tony tried to unwind himself. He was pretty sure his body was just reacting to the amount of caffeine in his bloodstream. People with anxiety shouldn’t drink coffee, he knows, but the ritual of drinking coffee itself calmed him down so there was no right answer.
Steve still hadn’t said anything.
Tony shook his head, half his mind on Pete’s location, the other half very firmly rooted in the semantics he was glancing over on his tablet.
When he finally stopped, the fork coming to rest next to his plate, it felt like he was pulling himself out of a fever dream.
Tony’s parenting sense, much like Peter’s spidey sense, was smelling a story but he couldn’t figure out what exactly the story was. So he let it go.
Jarvis replied.
Everything was happening so fast he couldn’t process it. The mist of clay and glass made it hard to see but Peter would know the glint of red and gold anywhere.
“Need to what?” Steve snapped. “Please, tell me, Tony. Tell me how I need to sleep more and take my meds and do all the things you refuse to do for yourself. I can’t wait to hear how
First, the sound of glass shattering as they watched the shards rain down the outside of the window. Then came the shuddering explosion as the missile blew up the top of the tower.
His stomach felt sore right now, empty. But he wasn’t hungry. He wouldn’t eat if someone paid him.
Tony ran his palm along the base of Steve’s spine, letting him take a minute to catch his breath.
Tony ruffled Peter’s hair and they made their way upstairs to the kitchen.
Peter laughed and resisted the urge to grab another donut. His stomach was already painfully full. The last thing he needed was a fourth donut.
Tony’s chest squeezed as the reason for their trek across town came back to him.
The door to their bedroom clicked shut and Tony did teach Steve a lesson.
The old man grumbled back some offensive racial slurs and Steve was tempted to push the man again himself.
Whatever it was, he didn’t want Pops to see it. Not now. Not with Tony gone.
Getting in.
Weird. Peter was suddenly interested in physical fitness? Since when? What happened to the Spider-Man who only wanted junk food and classic science fiction films?
Tony knew what he meant without him clarify. “Figure it out as we go. He’s our son. Maybe there’s some parental instincts that’ll kick in. And there’s always the internet and whatever resources money can buy, right?”
Steve smiled at that and Tony could see the shell of his trauma slowly but surely cracking. Not going anywhere, but easing up its hold in the moment.
“Dad, did you-”
(See the end of the chapter for
His mind was a constant cycle of cultish chanting about food. When he could eat, how much he could eat, what he needed to do before he could eat.
He’s in the kitchen right now. Jarvis is watching him for me. He’ll let me know how he’s doing.”
“You’re killing me with this, Cap.”
Steve stopped eating and clasped his hands above his plate, elbows resting on the table. Perfectly executed ‘worried father’ blocking. “What were you anxious about?”
Steve nodded and Tony sat beside him so he could somewhat pull Steve to his chest.
Tony couldn’t figure out what face he was going to make. Angry dad? Depressed? Confused?
“I mean, who walks around New York-
“I am fucking awesome.”
“What are we going to do if they get into the tower? Just let them run around until they get bored and leave?” Peter was scratching at the scar now, his fingernails audibly removing the top layers of skin. “I mean, what if they- I don’t know! Find something else? Corner us?”
Steve huffed. “Sure. Just excuse yourself because you’ve been doing it for longer. That’s perfectly logical.”
Peter wasn’t going to die in one day. Peter had been injured and shot up and drugged and plenty of other things that should’ve killed him but didn’t.
Tonight, their minds were firmly locked on to a new topic of concern: their fifteen-year-old son, Peter.
Steve’s hand was trembling as he struggled to latch it onto Tony’s wrist. “I-”
“Peter,” Steve snapped. “Indigestion matters when you passed out earlier. It could be related.”
Shattered glass and chunks of what had been the living room sprinkled the walls and the hardwood. Tendrils of smoke curled up from scorch marks the missile has left behind. Shrapnel coated the whole space.
kindergarten teacher who volunteers with the VA or something.”
wasn’t his jaw hitting his breastbone.
The room was completely empty. Just white walls and a battered grey carpet.
“Brandon.”
CW: disordered eating thoughts, throwing up, anxiety/panic attacks.
Of fucking course he had to leave now, in the middle of whatever- whatever
Tony wasn’t buying any of it. Not a single word.
Peter isn’t eating and now we get to go on a full team mission to stop the motherfuckers who stole his DNA, leaving him here alone to get into all kinds of trouble. Plus, we have no idea what weapons or superpowers these teenaged mutant ninja brats have or what their plan is.”
“It’s time to go. Can I trust you not to pass out or do I need to have the big guy here carry you?”
That little cheeky asshole was just sitting on a futon in the basement waiting for them to show up. His feet up on the coffee table, TV remote in one hand, a Mai Tai in the other.
“I love having a front seat to your marital spats,” Clint quipped as he riffled around in the kitchen cabinets. “Also, I found a can of soup. And it’s veggie soup. No one should live this way.”
He was just standing there, a sitting duck in the middle of the hall, when he heard the scream.
“Where would he go?”
Peter swallowed and murmured an apology before eating some more.
His stomach grumbled painfully but he wouldn’t eat any more pizza.
It took a few tries, a few failed intakes of oxygen, before Peter was ready to speak.
“Do you guys mind if I go spend some time at Ned’s today?” Peter hadn’t even checked if Ned was home, but he figured Ned wouldn’t mind him showing up unannounced. “We’re going to watch a bunch of old syfy movies.”
“Tony, seriously, if you to need to-”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Liz set the car down and picked some lint off the collar of her shirt. “I’m hungry. Let’s go get some bagels.”
Bruce’s eyes were shining with pity by the time he finished. “Tony, I don’t even know what to say. This is serious.”
Peter didn’t know what he had said wrong. Steve went back to his breakfast and Peter fidgeted, ripping up his napkin so he wouldn’t eat anything else. He wasn’t even hungry.
“Listen. You don’t need to talk. Or do anything really. But maybe a bath or a meal would make you feel better. A cup of coffee? A movie? A heavy petting session? I would be happy to pet heavily for the sake of your mental health.”
. Healthy foods like apples and carrots, unhealthy foods like cheese fries and pepperoni pizza.
Peter’s words hit Tony right in the solar plexus. Knocked the wind right out of him.
Steve and Tony were talking in hushed whispers until they saw him coming.
He had never been able to argue with it before, no point trying now. “I won’t go out as Spider-Man. I’ll just be the a-okay lazy teenager this weekend who sleeps until noon and stays up until four. Is that good?”
And the chapter is ready a full day early. I feel like God.
“Eat this.”
Steve came up behind him and grabbed his shoulder.
It was time to choose. Refuse. Give in. Throw the bottle at the wall and use the shock lag to run for it again.
He shouldn’t have let it go.
Peter tried to smile back, but his mouth was so full he was already struggling not to spew food everywhere without stretching his lips outward. He settled for a strained grimace-like grin.
Same as before, the elevator doors whirred open to nothing. Just cold wind whistling between buildings as Tony searched for any sign, any evidence, that the Dumbass Duo had been up here.
“Not hungry?” Nat tried to offer him the other half again. “It’s okay. I don’t want the whole thing anyway.”
Tony ripped the nutrition label off the bottle and stuck it into his back pocket. Another insight from Jarvis: nutrition labels were a no-go because calorie counts were a huge trigger.
“Pops, it wasn’t that. I was just in the zone and got dizzy.”
He was panicking.
“I wasn’t saying anything,” Tony said, his eyes searching Steve’s a little too intently. “Happy is on his way. He’ll be here as soon as he can.”
Peter crossed his arms tighter. “How about we don’t?”
It was the ceiling over the bunker. It was fissuring. A slab of concrete, shifting as the weight of Peter and Tony gradually pulled at it.
The adults started talking strategy and battle plans and yada yada. Peter clocked out. His job as Spider-Man did not include strategizing.
Tony made quick work of getting one of Peter’s arms free from the spandex of his suit. He looked so small and pale with Tony’s hand holding up his bare, limp forearm.
“No, seriously, Cap. Let me bask in this. We’re going to leave Peter here,
He resolved to avoid it.
But Jarvis was gone too. All things wireless were dead. If his suit’s power didn’t lay nestled in his chest, it would be dead, too.
Bruce stepped forward and Peter jumped back, hitting the wall of weapons and knocking some knives free from their hooks.
“Alright. I’m alone.”
And thanks to the Spidey genes, he was already seeing progress.
Peter was so consumed by anxiety over his escape from the tower and the constant pulse of his hunger that he hadn’t noticed the blonde woman lurking in the hallway when he came in.
“Do you want breakfast or just some sleep?”
There is was, though.
Tony was tempted to make him sit down right now, grime and all. He knew Peter and his son’s eyes were dodgy, like a caged animal.
“Dad, you haven’t gone to bed before midnight, like, ever.”
He needed to check on the monkey.
Steve took a deep breath, held it, blew it out in staccato sighs. Finally, he dropped his hand, letting Tony see his soaked cheeks and bloodshot eyes.
Especially when Tony’s fingers shifted as he sat back down and Peter realized Tony was holding not one packet of Pop-Tarts, but two.
“Tony, where’s Steve? I can’t hear him.”
“It’s fine,” Tony lied, typing out a reply before Steve tried to call. He didn’t want anyone overhearing what was going on at home. It was a family matter. “Just some drama with everyone’s favorite angsty teen.”
Nat pulled two daggers out of hidden sheaths and spun them along the tips of her fingers. Clint notched an arrow and Thor adjusted his grip on his hammer. Tony warmed the lasers at his palms.
“Tony, if we go back, and he gets your suit-”
But it was for a good reason. He was going to help.
They just felt… wrong?
“Almost done, just hang on.”
“Let’s get out of here.”
Tony faded in and out of a restless sleep for a few hours. After the sun had been up for an hour, Tony couldn’t take it.
“Steve.” Tony reasoned, cupping the side of Steve’s neck. “He’s locked in his room, asleep. It’s almost five a.m. There’s nothing we can do right now except-”
He had been gone for under five minutes and the episode had progressed.
Steve hated texting more than Tony hated decaf, but he’d painstakingly sent out texts to every member of the Avengers about his son’s whereabouts. “Nothing.”
Five seconds passed.
“School. No big deal. It was just a project but it felt like… like a big deal, I guess.”
He could slam the door in their faces, buy enough time to lock the bathroom door. But Jarvis would unlock the doors since all the locks in the tower were automated.
This was never good. Nothing about this is good. But if he’s stopped healing… Steve, he’s so much further along than we thought he was. He’s must have been doing this for at least a week or two. Maybe even longer.”
“Do you want me to go get Pops?” Peter chirped, his need to see Steve for himself obvious.
Another red flag.
“Peter, your dads are really good at what they do. Like, freakishly good. I mean, the Avengers are like in Honors for superheroes, you know? They’re the best of the best.” Ned was right. Peter knew he was right. “Besides. Whatever mission they’re on can’t be too big a deal because Happy isn’t staying here with us. Your dad always has him sleep on the couch when the mission is dangerous, right?”
“Tony, she got him.” Steve gently turned Peter’s head so he could better see the small wound. Unconsciously, his other hand started rubbing the spot where his own cut had been. “What is she going to do with it?”
Steve’s eyes burned but he wasn’t going to cry. He was angry. Pissed off.
Nat groaned. “Clint, shut up.”
Tony, Natasha, and Clint were making their way along the left side of the compound when they heard it. The heavy, aggressive steps of someone running.
“Dad, Pops, I’m fine,” Peter managed. His throat was so scratchy he had to say it twice for them to understand him. “I just overdid it. I was trying to beat my personal-” But the coughing choked off his words and hands were pulling him up until he was sitting, his thighs and ass struggling to keep traction with the puddle of sweat underneath him.
How could Steve go to bed knowing something was wrong with their son? Something this serious?
“Hey,” Tony said, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You were knocked out by that teenage dweeboid. He took some DNA so your neck might sting a bit. Don’t worry, I already bandaged it.”
. “As we speak, he’s cleaning up whatever natural disaster of pizza boxes and Skittles he and Ned made last night.”
This was so much worse than Steve could have imagined.
“When was the last time you ate?”
He was still… puffy. Soft. Terribly, terribly, far from his goal.
Steve was trembling all over now, his skin clammy under Tony’s hands.
So he ran.
It’s Peter’s anxiety. Peter is worried about Steve. Of course. Why didn’t Tony put those pieces together earlier?
Steve and Tony probably thought he had indigestion or Playboys tucked away somewhere. The last one made Peter’s stomach curdle. But he needed to keep up the illusion. His mirror pep talks were the most effective way for him to keep up his diet.
“Guess he knew we were coming,” Tony mussed, pawing through the used syringes. They would take them back to the tower to see if they could figure out what had been inside them.
Yeah, okay, maybe Peter did that under certain orders. From a certain parent.
Just like the one Steve had.
They boarded the train for Queens and sat side by side, Tony’s fingers lacing with Steve’s.
“America’s greatest!” Brandon exclaimed, arms out in welcome. “How kind of you to break into my house and-”
Steve rubbed his shoulder encouragingly and Tony was chewing on his thumbnail. His dads were paying more attention to him drinking this stupid thing than they had when he debated at national tournaments or gave speeches at school fundraisers.
He needed some space, some time.
Fair warning, lots of triggers in this chapter so read with caution. Poor Steve is going through the emotional ringer. Peter's not doing too hot, and oh, Tony, his time is coming soon too.
She waved his way and opened her mouth. He was looking at her, so he knew she said it, but when
Tony didn’t notice that Bruce had come in right behind Thor until the doctor was waving Tony over, an apprehensive look on his face.
“Fuck you and your eye patch,” Tony grumbled, taking the file into his hands and sifting through it.
! Instead… look at me!” Peter was shamelessly crying now. He motioned to himself. “I’m pathetic, Dad. I’m weak and pathetic and nothing like you guys.”
When he stood up to get off at his stop, he tipped forward and almost faceplanted in the bus aisle.
It took Peter half a minute of blushing and fumbling over words before he uttered a squeaky “
So much worse.
Hey everyone! Happy weekend! I hope this chapter finds you well and enjoying the sunshine or rain or whatever the weather is doing where you live. It's snowing near me and I'm here for it. As always, content warnings are at the end.
Tony cocked an eyebrow at Steve as his armor slowly rolled up his body. “Who said anything about you letting me?”
They got in bed but neither of them fell asleep for a long, long time.
Two people came in from the door opposite the one Steve had wandered in. There were only two exits.
“I’m not making a face.”
“Your dad needs almost four times the amount of food as the average adult man his size. That’s why I make all of those nasty specialized protein shakes for him. So he can get enough to eat without polishing off the refrigerator every couple hours.
Bruce was going to tell his dads about the bruises and then they would worry even more.
Jarvis just needed to
Peter scrambled back so quickly he fell flat on his ass. “What the-”
Two could play in a game of stubborn will.
“No, it’s- it’s fine. I’m fine. Just sore.” Peter’s eyes bugged out when he realized what he had said.
What was going on?
So maybe there was proof that Nat lived there after all.
“How are we going to get in?” Tony asked, smacking his open palm against the door a couple of times. The only reply was the loud knocks echoing down the linoleum halls. “Or I guess a better question would be, if Peter got in there, how’d he do it?”
Peter’s face fell with every word out of Tony’s mouth. “Is he okay? What happened?”
“We can what, Steve? We can help him? We can find him?” Tony dragged his hand under his nose before Steve could see that he was losing control of his emotions. “In case you missed it, we’re not doing very well on child raising. Our son is gone. He’s starving. He’s
Peter grinned back.
“You know it’s not about you.” Tony sighed, rubbing his brow and accidentally covering it in motor oil. “Just- just let me get him, okay? He needs time, Peter.”
Tony slid up beside him, tucking himself into Steve’s side and draping one arm across his back.
“Here we go.”
Tony sighed. “Good luck. He’s a terrible liar but that doesn’t mean he isn’t going to try.”
The moment Steve sat down, heat flooding his chest and limbs as warmth seeped from the water into his bones, he sighed in relief. His cold episodes always left him exhausted and weak. But the warmth was fighting off the tension, and gradually, easing the shakiness away, too.
“Tony, how do you know that?” Nat questioned, but she followed him into the elevator regardless.
Tony came back, looking like a cat who destroyed something you cherished but hid it so well you’ll never find it, and threw a fresh shirt Steve’s way.
Nat and Clint said nothing, just went first down the hall, checking to make sure it was clear.
If he could get away with eating nothing, he was back on track.
“Dad!” Peter ran to his side, looking for the wound. “Dad, what-
Peter had poured out half of the bottle. Half. Not a sip or two.
Tony’s hands stopped on Steve’s skin. “He’s doing what?”
Peter always felt smaller when he was crying. Like back when he was a baby and would wake Steve and Tony in the early mornings, refusing to stop screaming and start sleeping unless someone held him.
“I would but last time I tried,” Peter said, “he threatened to take away my workshop privileges. He said not to mess with his system.”
“Sure thing,
“Of course.” Tony pulled himself onto the couch beside Peter, kissing the side of his head before his son could push him away.
Peter took a deep breath through his nose, let it stutter past his lips. He was shaking again. Why was he shaking? Was it leftover nerves from Tony confronting him? Or shakiness because he was about to launch into a panic attack?
He just rocked back on his heels and jumped.
Tony pushed his faceplate off and dropped a kiss on Steve’s temple. It was cool beneath his lips.
Peter toweled his hair dry and slipped into a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. His legs were already sore. “Got it, Jarvis. Thanks.”
“Peter, I’ll be fine. I promise.” Tony and his team made for the elevator. “We’ll be back before you know it.”
Steve’s heart was racing but he took a deep breath. Tony, Clint, and Nat were here, too. They’d find him and they’d get him out.
Peter plus too much bad food equaled a useless superhero.
Peter shuddered before peeking through his fingers just long enough to take the bottle from Tony’s hands. He composed himself, taking deep, slow breaths before running his fingers over the smooth glass. His nails caught over the sticky residue left from the peeled label. “Where’s the-the sticker?”
“Hey, hey,” Tony cut him off, pulling him in close. Steve was shivering even harder than earlier. Now Tony saw it for what it was: a looming panic attack. He needed to get Steve warm, and he needed to do it now. “Here.”
Tony rounded the corner… and there was no one there. Nothing. Just an empty hallway after an empty room.
“Sorry, sorry.”
“Put that down before you blow all of us up and we have to spend the afterlife haunting your ass.”
Simply put, Tony was going to need the caffeine.
“The roof. They’re going in through the roof!”
“Whatever you say, Tin Man.”
Peter was sitting on his bed, stomach cramping as he fought the urge to ravage the kitchen.
Fury nodded. “It is. And here’s the good news. You’ll like it, Stark, because you’re a narcissist and this is all about you.”
Peter took the chance to go wake Ned up while Tony was in the bathroom.
Steve crossed his arms, biceps bulging, and stared Tony down. Tony stared back.
Except… he couldn’t find a rooftop lounge because his web shooters were at the tower. Shit. He could climb the side of a building but he wasn’t sure he had the stamina for that right now.
Steve took in Tony’s expression, the pleading in his eyes, and nodded once.
“Okay, just give me one question. One question and I’ll drop the whole thing, okay?”
Well, fucking shit.
Tony thought.
But he would be all alone.
Vents started hissing and Steve took the deepest breath he could, holding onto the air the same way he held onto the hope that the rest of his team would find him before he fell asleep.
Tony didn’t think he could handle looking him in the eyes right now. It would break him in half.
“When you’re done stroking your ego, come on over here so we can discuss the case,” Fury continued, flipping through one of the folders. “Trust me, you’ll like what I have to share.”
, Peter thought,
His fingers danced over his stomach.
Steve nodded and ducked into another room.
She leaned back and smiled. “Nah. Just gifted.”
Fury huffed and rolled his eye. “Are you done?”
The keypad was standard, nine numbers and a blinking green screen no bigger than a Chapstick tube.
“Two hundred.”
“Is he okay?” Peter caught himself chewing on a fingernail and stuck his hands under his thighs. Ned was stirring on the other couch, grumbling incoherently.
“On a walk.”
Tony kissed his hair and got to work. Turning on the faucet and filling the tub with steaming water. Pouring some sort of scented bath salt into the basin so the water was a light purple and nothing like the arctic blue of the ocean where Steve crashed the plane. Gathering the warmest clothes he could find for once Steve was done.
“Peter, there’s no choice here. You can’t go on like this. If you were human, this would be dangerous. But you’re superhuman. Like your Pops.” The taste of the words made Tony nauseous but he needed Peter to understand the gravity of this. “Peter, you can’t keep this up. You’re going to die if you try.”
“Never going to what?”
“Nothing,” Bruce said. “Let’s get to the safe house.”
“Pizza will do that to you sometimes,” he lamented before taking another bite.
Knowing that Tony was hurting right now, and it was Peter’s fault… That was the only reason Peter took a breath, shook the nerves from his arms, and crossed the room to sit beside his dad.
Ned smiled and waved, slipping his backpack on as they left. “Bye, Mr. Stark!”
“No,” Ned rolled over so he was staring at Peter, eyes bleary and squinting from the bright light of the TV. A few hours ago, Peter and Ned had each taken their respective couches in the living room with piles of blankets to properly marathon the entire
The first blast shot wide, grasping at air before sticking to the side of the building.
But none of this was okay. Peter wasn’t eating. Peter had passed out on the treadmill. Peter probably wasn’t sleeping again, too, and Steve himself was still reeling from almost dying during their last mission. And Tony was on the damned quinjet heading across the country.
Nat smirked and showed her cards. Clint began to protest right as Nat held up a hand and turned back to Tony. “So. Which Stark-Rogers is that face about?”
