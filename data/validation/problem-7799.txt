“I’ve gotta start breakfast” He stopped at the door frame but didn’t turn to see Tony’s nakedness. “Feel free to make yourself at home”
While Steve Rogers is all about Manhattan now, he didn’t start out that way. He’s Bushwick born and bred and like any good 90’s Bushwick boy, he knows where to go looking for trouble…
Steve smiled indulgently and reached for the food tray to place it on Tony’s lap, keeping his left hand on it to help him balance.
The names made Tony perk up like a bloodhound who smelled prey, his eyes searched the crowd in a frantic manner and sure enough he spotted them. Freshly arrived and still close to the door was Pepper and much to Tony’s excitement, she was holding something in her arms.
Decades ago, when the old government had still been around Steve had been forced to attend court-mandated therapy sessions. The old broad, Dr. Pancovich would always ask him the same kind of questions which he then had to try his best to answer. Maybe if he got Tony to open up to him about his own feelings, Tony wouldn’t feel the need to drown anything in alcohol in the future.
“As long as it’s what she wants and not what YOU put her in”
After New Year’s they fall into a new pattern.
“My brother told me, as soon as I came to see him.”
“We shall text” Thor declares and the solemnity of the declaration causes Siggy to chuckle.
“Look I know this isn’t what you wanted but they’re here, they’re hurt and they need our help, so shake it off!” Tony admonished. They were rushing to the tenth floor’s medical centre where the doctor was apparently done nursing Bucky’s wound. Steve had called Fury right away but Nick told him to stay put, Natasha, Clint, Coulson and Maria Hill would handle Pierce.
“Oh come on, don’t I get a free pass on my birthday?” Tony finally asks as his laughter dies down. A smirk is the only tell he gets from the surgeon and it’s enough for Tony to walk forward and throw his arms around the slightly taller man.
Steve chuckled then broke into a full string of bubbly laughter.
“-OU NEVER EVEN TRIED TO WARN ME!”
“What’s going on in that big brain of yours?”
“Do you remember how hard he hit you?”
“Welcome! Come in!”
She delivers a loud smooth on his cheek which makes him laugh, and steps back to greet her son and adopted niece.
“What’s the same?”
“Well I suppose so, but I’m adopted.”
“Two”
“Together Steve. How much longer do we have together.”
Loki’s comment is all venom, but not at Tony. Tony manages a smirk despite the accusatory glare Steve pins the dark haired man with.
Steve chuckled, low and deep. Tony buried his face in a creamy pectoral and breathed in.
The Commander ran gentle fingers through Tony’s silver hair. Taking special care to press down, gently but firmly over certain areas, aware of their propensity for causing his beloved migraines.
Tony was still very much floating in clouds of marshmallows by the time Steve finally got enough of his wits about him to turn off the spray and wrap Tony up in a large fluffy towel. Once cocooned, Tony melted against him, his cheek coming to rest against the exposed flesh of Steve’s clavicle that the baggy t-shirt left uncovered. Tony now smelled entirely of soap, and Steve held him in his arms with a sense of possessiveness he hadn’t allowed himself to feel.
They grin at each other, mirror expressions of love. They’re both good at this, at speaking without words. Steve gets what Tony is trying to tell him, that he’s going to be ok so it’s ok for Steve to go and have a hobby. That having an outlet for all this rage that doesn’t involve violence will benefit him.
“Look around us Cap, we’re a ticking time-bomb. That’s why we need this, so innocent people don’t get hurt. There’s more at play here than you think.”
Thor obviously stops breathing at the news, Steve probably does too and all Tony can do not to burst into inappropriate, uncontrollable laughter is to hide his mouth on Arlen’s temple.
“I might have given her a hard time last time I was here.”
“I don’t know Steve… everyone just seems on edge after the earthquake that flattened half the world hit.”
“Oh yeah? Then how come everything I do makes you happy?”
“If I could do it all over again, I would stay with you. You don’t know how many times I’ve wished that I just would’ve stayed at the Academy with you and our friends. But I was so young, and so confused… I thought I was doing the right thing and look at me now, I didn’t even finish High School Tony…”
The only reason they were able to effectively eliminate so many was because Steve had long ago memorized the names of every early Hydra agent that had hidden inside SHIELD. It’d just been one of those weird things he’d done to pass the time during his mandatory involuntary commitment in that psychiatric ward before the Regime war. For any new agents that joined, there was a handy little test attached to the mandatory polygraph for candidates that was proving great at weeding out the garbage. The last of said garbage however, proved to be harder to get rid of than the rest.
“Darcy, I’mma have to call you back. Steve twisted his ankle yesterday and now he’s being dumb.”
Steve smiled at Tony, his gaze soft and smile shy before suddenly turning fully to his side to face the brunette.
Once upon a time, the Commander’s thoughts about Tony had been predominantly controlled by longing and guilt. He spent decades thinking about what a second chance would feel like, about what he would do if he ever got to see Tony’s beloved face again. Now he no longer wondered, no longer longed. He could reach out, just as he was doing now, to touch the ruler of his mind with nothing but air in between them.
“Hey! That’s t…”
Steve had laughed and assured him that Casey was perfectly capable of handling the Robotic Engineers, even if last month they’d called him in a panic because their test robot had nailed 200 screws to the lab walls before anyone noticed.
“It’s just that… well… I mean, I was young so I don’t remember exactly y’know? But I remember he hit me hard on the head a couple of times while drunk. He knocked me out once… maybe twice, I think… and Dr. Banner said the tumour’s been there for a while, maybe since childhood and my specific type can be associated to a bad enough brain injury.”
He raised his voice on purpose, made it seem like he was getting mad. As expected Steve frowned and sighed loudly before muttering an “Ok, just be careful.”
“Don’t you even want to know who it’s against?”
These days, the lives in the Stark household were slower than they ever had been. They were days spent in the intimacy of their beach home, enjoying complete privacy that was intermittently broken up by a visit or a video conference. They were days of little stress and a lot of creativity, days of happy memories that kept Tony in a calm, easy going state.
They didn’t have to wait long. A figure that looked most certainly human appeared in the sky and it was falling fast, limbs flailing. Iron Man reacted first, zooming to the sky, he managed to grab hold of the person seconds away from hitting the water. It was extremely difficult to catch a person mid-air at those speeds, but Steve wasn’t surprised at Tony’s skill. A small cheer erupted from the rest of the team, quieting once Tony dropped down in front of them holding a young woman in his arms.
“And no homophobic bigots either.”
Tony hopes at least some of the terrors return to their caves for lunch time, but he may have to make a pyramid of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches just in case they don’t.
“You look so different Commander!” Eliza politely pointed out.
He said gently, tenderly and it must have triggered something in Tony because his puffy lips suddenly found Steve’s. It was a brush of lips, barely a kiss, made possible because Tony was still standing in the elevated tub to make up for the height difference. But it was purposeful and there was no denying Tony’s open eyes as he did it, so Steve puckered up own his lips. A moment later, as Tony pressed their lips together again, Steve’s left hand went from Tony’s lower back to the back of his head to keep him in place.
Steve chuckles. “No, home.”
Tony’s old man had been almost as bad as Steve’s. It’s one of the many things they share in common so it’s not surprising to hear it.
What even Natasha didn’t know however, was what Eliza had personally told him, that Barnes and Cap had gotten into a fight over Steve’s new direction. Cap had always been an ardent supporter of allowing the Avengers to self-manage and be autonomous of any country or organization, however recently he’d had a change of heart and now supported upholding the powers of the council to oversee the Avengers. This change had created a chasm between the two friends, only made worse by Eliza’s ever growing hold on her life-partner.
The word hit Tony’s consciousness like a freight train. It visibly numbed him, made him pale and he shrank into himself until tears finally rushed to his big brown eyes. Forty-three-year-old Tony would have said something back and gone to hide in his workshop. He would have locked himself in and not come out for days while obsessing about how he could make things right, how he could fix this. Nineteen-year-old Tony simply allowed the tears to fall on the spot and quietly sobbed out a “I’m s’o s’orry Steve”
“They are made from a highly concentrated metal not recognized in the known universe, Sir. Several planets have already tried destroying them with no success. Princes Thor, Loki and the Saviour known as Hulk have also tried.”
“Then how come he’s always hanging out at our place Daddy?”
Cap looked to be, even after all this time, in his thirties, which meant Steve had met Tony in his twenties. Within ten years of having met, the evil alien warlord popped up and probably, possibly, most likely, killed Tony Stark. That left about a fifty year gap in between other-dimension-Tony’s death and Steve’s dimensional move. Therefore, his husband had been crazy in love with him for an utterly ridiculous amount of time. Why?
“Steve could you please remind Tony of all the bureaucratic red tape you and I had to go through to get ‘my baby’ built?!”
When had he lost this ability?
“Sir?”
“Boy or girl?”
When he was young, safety had never been a huge concern of Tony’s. He’s accepted danger as part of life, accepted uncertainty and spontaneity with ease, but that was getting harder to do now that he was older. Nowadays Tony drew comfort from knowing that Mondays were his meeting days with Peter Parker, his head of R&D, AI division. On Tuesdays he caught up with Pepper and Julianne (Pepper’s hand-picked soon-to-be-CEO). Wednesdays they usually had a visitor, sometimes it was Eliza, others it was Alaska. Fridays were their evenings out, whether that was dinner with Rhodey and Pepper, drinks with Bruce and Natasha or sometimes even just dinner with Eliza. Then the weekend was their own and their routine started back again. His life was like the ocean wave, it came and retreated before coming in again, ever constant, ever predictable… which was why the interruption on a Monday evening came as such a surprise.
“I know it’s super early but I didn’t want to wait till December so, here, open this.”
Tony gaped guiltily at him, Steve looked at the dents in the ceiling.
“So did I properly butcher your favourite song?”
“Ok then, how about we go to the dining room and give you both some privacy.”
“An argument could be made for 50%”
He gets up and walks to a small fridge carefully tucked away by a corner. He inputs a digit password onto a small pad and waits for the sound of the lock swiping open.
He nods, puts his phone away and gets up.
It’s a child’s way of compromising, an offer of least effort and as it stands, spoken from someone who although curious, has never actually yearned to meet her birth father. But it’s still an offering and one Thor would be foolish to discard on the basis of unfairness and hurt. Thor understand what Loki has spent days drilling into his brain; he has no legal rights.
They all stared at the girl, now on her knees again before turning to Tony who looked both flabbergasted and uncomfortable. From his spot, Steve Stark chuckled.
“I will.”
He did one single test just to make sure it worked as intended and as he watched the deadly pendulum swing, he thought back to all his research. One single cut through the throat, the one wound not even his body could recover from. Wasn’t that how vampires were supposed to be killed after all? Tony’s death had already been a stake through the heart, so what better way to finish himself off than to cut off his own head? He’d lived so much of his life like a mythological monster; he might as well die like one.
“That your friend?” Asked the officer, pointing at Tony.
It all made sense.
The end
Steve, his wonderful, beautiful husband would say yes if Tony wanted it. But that didn’t mean Steve actually did. In fact, he didn’t want much to do with children. Steve tolerated Alaska, could hold her for short periods of time and make her fall asleep, but anything more than that? He took a step back. Tony did all the heavy lifting when they babysat her and when all was said and done and Alaska was back in her parents’ loving arms, Steve always looked happier for it.
On day zero, Tony left SI at seven twenty-three in the evening. He walked out the building’s main doors and turned a corner, heading to the bakery one block over after having spent the whole day craving cheesecake. It was raining and Tony held a tall umbrella over his head as he walked, thankful for the cool evening air on his skin. He spent too much time indoors and only realized it in moments like this when he was surprised by the sensation of wind on his face. Just as he waited for the lights to turn the strangest series of events happened. A hand, warm and steady touched his back, Tony turned his head to see who it might be and then felt a piercing pain as a short syringe penetrated his neck, all in the cover of Tony’s large black umbrella. Tony went limb in Steve’s arms within seconds, allowing the light to turn green and the few passerby’s to walk them by. No one looked, but if they had they wouldn’t have seen anything suspicious, just a guy kissing his boyfriend underneath an umbrella. They wouldn’t have thought the man in the suit was unconscious, or that he was being held up by Steve’s strong arms around his waist. Taking hold of the umbrella, Steve used considerable strength to walk them both over to his parked car just a few feet away.
“An alien warlock attacked Earth.” She’d told him, completely serious.
She appeared to consider this for a moment, as if she hadn’t actually thought about it before.
Steve brought Tony’s hand to his lips, pressing kisses against the cold fingers.
“Steve Rogers”
There it was, that look of amused exasperation that kept showing up in Steve’s eyes as of late. It made him look decades younger. Then it hit Tony.
Now manicured fingers found Steve’s full, rosy lips, tracing them as if he couldn’t see them at all. Tony’s hands were a contradiction, always so well manicured and yet so callused from his work. Steve puckered his lips, kissing the digits. With one step forward, Tony straddled Steve’s thighs, his knees digging on the couch cushions. He ran his hands through blonde hair, traced the smooth skin around Steve’s eyes and forehead.
‘Begging for scraps’, Steve thought, ‘Stevie always begging for scraps.’
“Looks to me like he understands responsibility perfectly well. Maybe he just needs a little more trust and support to prove it.”
It hit him again the first time he had to speak to Congress about why the Avengers were an asset to planet Earth.
“Can’t wait to introduce you to my wife Maria, you’ll love her! And my son! Steve I have a son, his name’s Tony. He’s brilliant! He’s eighteen and already in MIT but I’ll fly him in so you can meet him”
Steve tried to breathe but somehow he couldn’t draw in air. They looked at each other, transfixed until Tony’s lips broke into a full sincere smile and they stepped into each other. Steve ran his fingers over stubbly skin of Tony’s cheek and wondered, how could a monster like him be the best of part of anybody, let alone Tony Stark? The only possible explanation was that Tony was so in love he couldn’t see what Steve really was, and that was completely alright by him.
He observed Tony, focused on the frown lines that were beginning to stay and the laugh lines which were already there. At thirty Tony was most definitely a different person than the original Tony Stark had been. They behaved slightly differently too. When his Tony got frustrated he came to Steve, when the original Tony was frustrated he went out looking for a distraction. Could Steve’s presence really have changed Tony’s personality? He was still the same cocky, sarcastic pain in the ass he’d always been and yet there was a gentleness to him that hadn’t been there before.
“What’s wrong?”
Over the course of his long lifetime Steve had come to have a special understanding of the role that human error played in war and politics. In fact, the range of human stupidity never ceased to amaze him. He again felt this same wonder when Peggy Carter herself called to inform him that they’d found Bucky Barnes alive.
“Peggy. I need to come in for a bit.”
It was obvious by the look on Tony’s face that this wasn’t going how he thought it would go. The nineteen year old had prepared himself for rejection, he’d held himself stiff on the chair, eyes sharp, jaw locked as if heading into battle. Now his eyes were wide, face shocked into relaxation and hands around a mug that read ‘Mad Genius’... speechless.
A dark eyebrow rose in interest. “Is that right?” Amused, Tony turned to share a look with his husband but Steve’s patient demeanor seemed strange all of a sudden. “What is it?”
Overall, Steve found himself in quite a great mood. With Tony now inheriting SI and Steve there to support him, Tony could change the future of Stark Industries for the better. With that in mind Steve focused on looking sufficiently bereaved and thought back to the day they buried Pepper Potts.
After that conversation Steve would never again be able to sleep without running a hand over Tony’s chest. His hand would come to rest over the centre of Tony’s sternum, where the old Arc Reactor had been embedded. He would keep his hand there, waiting for sleep to come and reassured himself that Tony’s heart remained undamaged.
It took him a second but eventually Tony turned his head to look at Steve, a puzzled look on his face.
“Anything good on?”
After five straight weeks, Steve books Tony an appointment to see a doctor. Dr. Donald Blake comes highly recommended, he’s a good internist or so Steve’s research says. He bundles Tony up on a cold morning and drags his grumpy ass all the way to the hospital. Dr. Blake, it turns out, is tall, broad and endlessly charming. He’s able to immediately put Tony at ease. They’ll order a couple of brain scans and some bloodwork, do a thorough check up.
“Smartass.”
Tony inhaled and started dialing Pepper’s number before he could stop himself.
There was panic in her tone, as if the mere thought of Tony turning her away was enough to destroy her.
Tony beamed, eyes sparkling, teeth showing.
“Steve.”
“Impressive.”
Although he didn’t understand why, Tony suddenly felt like crying too.
Steve didn’t even frown.
“Home Sir, to Maine”
It wasn’t because Tony didn’t want children, on the contrary, he probably would have liked to have one. It was because Tony knew better than to bring it up.
It was the pain in Steve’s voice that stirred something in Tony, stirred his humanity, his care, his compassion. They were standing so close together, their body heat leaking into each other’s, their breaths mingling so intimately that when Steve stepped back Tony almost fell over. A heartbeat later Steve was heading to the bathroom door with conviction.
Tony looked up at Steve’s soft smile and thought ‘I want to know why you turned me into a god’ but said instead “You seem really relaxed lately. Why is that?”
“Nope…”
Children.
Exhaling in frustration Steve watched as Tony slowly became more and more responsive. He opened his mouth to let some of the falling water into his mouth, drank it and ran his hands through his sweaty face and hair. Then he began giggling, uncontrollable giggles overcame Tony as he sat under the gentle spray. The sound made Steve relax and grabbing the soap bar Steve soaped his hands and began washing Tony’s face and hair.
“Try again.”
There’s something hiding in Tony’s eyes… something Steve cannot pinpoint. It’s important, that’s obvious if Tony is taking such a stance, but it’s unknown.
“Yeah sure. Regular or half skimmed?”
“I’ve been keeping busy.”
The labs of Stark Industries would’ve made Tony proud. They were well stocked with all the modern amenities and so far they’d done wonders in both disease treatment and weapon innovation. Yet the beauty of the glass compound was eclipsed by the glory of the twenty-foot sculpture of Iron Man that stood in front of it. It was right beneath this sculpture that a familiar face greeted the High Commander as he stepped out of the car.
To Tony’s amusement, no sooner had the Super soldiers walked away that Steve had his left arm wrapped around Tony’s back. After all these years Tony could tell the difference between Steve-the-husband and Steve-the-sentinel.
“Of course.” Says Natasha and looking at her now Tony might even bet $5 that they really will come visit. Maybe...
Steve is unable to hear anything other than the sound of his own heartbeat banging inside his ears.
Before Tony, Steve used to think that there must be something wrong with him… something missing. Something that made people not want to get close… not want to be his friend.
“Yes, he agreed to keep him in one of his ‘secret’ storage bunkers. But I still think he’d be safer with SHIELD”
Steve knew right then and there; he had Howard Stark line, hook and sinker.
There’s groans of disappointment but mostly it’s a chorus of “Ok Mr. Stark.” He does his best to smile confidently, to look like this is nothing out of the ordinary, but he can’t fool them. He certainly can’t fool Siggy who is staring at them all as if she is seeing ghosts, or Harley who is downright scowling at the newcomers. He keeps the smile frozen as Shari stops to hug Siggy, keeps it as Siggy whispers something to Harley that has him shooting upstairs like a bullet.
But luck, as it turns out, is already on their side. For nothing gets broken all evening, cake and catered food is eaten with gusto and the Disney karaoke they all end up participating in is enjoyed by both children and adults alike (with Tony’s rendition of “How Far I’ll Go” being the highlight of the night). Karaoke is followed with a movie in Stephen’s ginormous TV and it’s quite possible (though never confirmed) that all three children beg for a second movie if only so they can have an excuse to fall asleep and not leave.
‘Honour their sacrifice’ he reminded himself.
“I can see why you’d think that honey, really I can. But don’t worry everything will make sense little by little.”
“Honestly baby, I’m just worried about you.”
“We will never be apart my love”
“I’m so sorry Steve.” And Tony truly is sorry. The sincerity behind the words is true, the shock in his face is real. Steve gives him a sad little smile in return. “You should try surrogacy. I’ve heard great things about it from couples.” The advice slips out mindlessly, as if it’s another Thursday night PTA meeting.
Steve didn’t bother refuting that claim. Tony for his part treated Pepper with both the weariness reserved for wild animals and the familiarity of a direct family member. By the second week he was both terrified of her “She poked me with a letter opener Steve, a letter opener!” and highly impressed with her “Did you see their faces? She caught error after error in those finances Steve, we have to launch a full internal investigation!”
“Your studies in neurology are legendary! I use your therapies for reconnecting nerves in the field!”
She preened at hearing her own name from Tony’s lips, a look of delighted surprise on her face.
For her part Virginia Potts took it all in stride. She’d never liked her name anyway so she grew used to Pepper quickly enough.
Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Steve, he considered asking them all to leave but decided against it.
“Thanks Cap, Bucky.”
“Haiti” Both Bruce and Natasha repeat in chorus.
The Commander’s eidetic mind was meticulously organized. It was a place that stored a century’s worth of information, intel, details, schedules and images. It was a space of order, a place of little feeling. The only exception to this rule was Tony Stark.
“Let’s go.” Whispered Steve, his unyielding hand already tugging at his husband’s impatiently.
“Why is he like THAT? Why is he such a stuck up asshole?!”
He wasn’t happy about it, didn’t want to go but Peggy called him herself and he had to keep her trust. He told Tony why he was going, how long he would be gone, asked him to take care of himself and Tony waved him goodbye with reassurances that he was nineteen and perfectly capable of taking care of himself.
“But why don’t you just ask Tony whatever you want to know?”
“Steebe?”
Bruce sighs in defeat. He shifts his weight from one foot to the next and instead focuses his gaze on baby Sigrid.
“Better than you old man.” Rhodey teased back.
“It’s not that simple. You’re the only person in the universe I’m interested in. It has nothing to do with what sex you are.”
They spend that Christmas pretending for each other. Steve (always watchful, always present) pretends to be calmer than his nature, while Tony (always joyful, never complaining) pretends not to care about the tests. He jokes through the blood draws, pretends to forget the date of his MRI and giggles as he’s pulled into the vortex of the enormous machine.
“Vitruvian Studio?”
“Tell you what Tony, I’ll go make breakfast, you go put some clothes on and we’ll talk about it over coffee”
He means the question more for Nat and Bruce than for the other two. After all, he hasn’t spoken to Steve in almost eleven years and Loki for even longer than that, but it’s Steve who answers.
His first action was to pull Tony up from the ground. He understood he had to say something but Tony was looking nervous which meant Steve had to kiss him first, to get him to relax. When they finally pushed away, Steve’s warm hand cupping Tony’s chin he finally nodded.
Tony sighed, his eyes closed again and just like that he was back asleep. What could happen, Steve wondered, if the Tony Stark lying in his arms right now made it unscathed into adulthood? How much would the world change with this Tony ready to change it?
“We’re different, you and I… so different and yet we’re not…”
Funny, he thought, how this woman’s son moved with the speed and jerkiness of the blue-collar when both his parents had such time and leisure in their bodies.
“Alright Tony, if that’s what you want.”
Steve had never met Maria Stark before now, had barely seen pictures of the woman. Now he sat across the dining table from her having breakfast while Howard rushed off to work. She was graceful and gracious, reminded him of the old-style movie starlets in the elegant way she moved and spoke. She wore her blonde hair up in an elaborate style and smelled of expensive perfume. He thought back to his own mother, a woman of strength and hard work who’d smelled of washing soap and who’d moved with the quickness and sharpness of the poor.
But that would mean he’d have to be willing to play by their rules. To fight side by side with another Steve Rogers, another Bucky Barnes.
At twenty-five Tony Stark was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen. The well groomed balbo beard gave him a look of sophistication and accentuated the shapeliness of his lips. He cut a particularly pretty picture in ratty jeans and t-shirt, running his hands full of sunscreen all over Steve’s skin. Steve wanted to keep him like this forever, he wanted to freeze this universe in this particular moment and just live here forever. He knew it couldn’t be done, but how he loved these sun-filled days with just him and Tony in the house.
“No… headaches, problems with my vision, sensitivity to light… I think I even went a little deaf in one ear for a while.”
“Alright, I’ll come with you then.”
Tony’s eyes strayed from his laptop to focus on watching Steve get the necessary ingredients out to start on his cake. No, they never talked about certain things because they didn’t need to and if they did… Tony would think about that tomorrow.
It’s the anguish behind Steve’s tone that managed to shake Tony to his very core. The angry wail, (half sob, half scream) thundered inside their home in a horrible acoustic concerto. These walls had never known fury like this before, until now.
In one afternoon Steve learned all about Tony’s projects in MIT, learned he was already working on one of his PHD’s, learned about his robots and about his best friend Rhodey. Tony was a living breathing firecracker and Steve marveled at him. Then as afternoon turned into the early evening Tony learned something brand new about Tony, just how strained his relationship with Howard really was.
Steve runs swollen knuckles over Tony’s left cheek, still smooth despite the prickle of evening stubble.
Tony woke up in layers.
He might be different, but he was still Steve.
There was so much to do… but they had time.
“TWELVE PERCENT? My baby?”
“Ouch! No prob boss. I’ll just shoot you an email with the rest.”
“Congratulations! How many months?”
With a groan of exhaustion or perhaps exasperation Pepper left the comfort of Steve’s warmth to kiss his bearded cheek goodnight. She then walked over to Tony with a look that made the genius straighten up in expectation, but Pepper merely kissed his cheek too.
“JARVIS?”
Tony’s smile was warm as she glazed over the Avenger’s new projects. They talked as Steve prepared their brunch and ended up eating it right there sitting around the kitchen island in comfortable conversation. While the Starks did have a professional cook who took care of their needs during the week, weekends were Steve’s cooking days and he took particular pride in them. Once brunch had been eaten and they were each finishing off a glass of lemonade, Eliza inhaled and turned to fully face her beloved Savior.
With a kiss to Steve’s lips, Tony moved off Steve’s lap and walked to the kitchen.
“You really should. Going at it alone isn’t as scary as it sounds. I mean yeah, it’s a challenge but it’s not as scary when you’re right in the middle of it.” Yeah, just another Thursday night PTA meeting, Tony thinks.
Worse still… he could continue hurting others without any kind of repercussion.
“I came across the original contract between Jane and Father two years ago and asked Mother about it. She told me everything that happened.”
“Quite well, thank you.”
Unconsciously Steve’s grip on Tony tightened and tightened until drowsy eyes blinked open.
“She’ll always be with us Thor, thanks to Sigrid.” He finally says and Thor nods.
“Done”
Eliza’s gaze took in the sight of Captain America without the slightest surprise. ‘She was briefed well’ Thought Steve.
A somewhat awkward cluster of minutes pass by. Minutes in which Herley and Arlen help Stephen clear out the mountain of take-out waste. Minutes in which Natasha and Bruce help clear out the table and a wet rag is pushed onto Loki’s hand by Natasha with an order to wipe down the tabletop. Minutes that cover the weird exchange of cell phone numbers and modest negotiation of phone calls, between a daughter, her parent and a biological father.
“I’m thinking of growing a beard.”
With that taken care of, Steve opens up his computer and begins the daily grind.
“Should he have?”
Crossing the length of the icy room he gathered the shivering bundle in his arms.
“It’s a gift certificate for their sculpting class. I know you don’t draw anymore but you always look so interested in the sculptures whenever we walk by there, and baby you’re so good with your hands, so I took a chance…”
“This is a nice surprise! Have you eaten yet? I can have someone bring us something.”
“I know you a lot better than you think I do Steve.”
“We’re really going all out, aren’t we.” There was no question about it, just a statement.
Tony has crossed his arms and straightened his legs. He’s looking at Steve with eyes full of resolve and a question that is eating him alive.
“Understood”
“Where’s Barnes?”
There would be question, Steve knew. So many questions. Tony would want to know why this young woman treated him like a god, the rest of the Avengers would want a nice, concise explanation about everything (which they wouldn't get). Most importantly, they’d have to figure out a way to know where the worst of the earthquake would hit and he still had to make himself look upon the face of an older Alaska Rhodes on a screen.
Steve wants to reply with ‘Why bother? It’s all ruined’ but instead he does as told. Then he watches, amazed, as Tony manages to salvage a few tempura pieces and adds the soggy ones to the fried noodles.
“What do you suggest we do then Tony?”
Steve did reach out to grab Tony’s hand then, his fingers coiling around Tony’s fisted hand. Immediately Tony recoiled at the touch but Steve followed the hand, not letting it escape the warmth of his palm.
“Tony, no, of course I’m not asking for money! That’s not what this is about at all”
“I’ll be with you soon Tony. Wait for me a little ok?”
They laughed and teased and reminisced but Tony was always glad when they left and it was just him and Steve again. Tony liked when Steve stopped acting the part of the all-around perfect, all-American guy and became his again. When Steve went back to giving Tony his undivided attention for as long as Tony wanted it, when Steve sat down in the couch of Tony’s newly built lab/garage just so he could be in the same vicinity as the genius, when Steve’s whole existence revolved around what Tony wanted to eat, or what he might want to watch or if Tony was feeling like taking a walk today. When they could spend all day together in bed naked, touching each other, kissing, grinding, making love, where Steve could worship every spot of Tony’s skin with his hands and tongue and eyes.
Damage reports were still coming in, crumbled buildings, houses, cities in every street, in every town of the world. In some parts, cracks as big and as deep as the Grand Canyon parted continents. It was catastrophic but the loss of life was not even in the triple digits.
“My Uncle Stephen also goes to Nepal every few years with Doctors Without Borders. He operates on a lot of people there.”
“Because I don’t want to hurt him Harley! It’s obvious that thinking about the past hurts him a lot and I don’t want to go making my Daddy cry just because I’m nosy!”
“I did not. I just found out…” Thor’s gaze focuses on the dusty hardwood floor, tears threatening to escape his red-tinted (sun damaged) hazel eyes. “I don’t even know where she is buried.” Thor whispers. Steve places a hand on Thor’s knee in support, inhaling as if getting ready to say something before losing it all in a single exhale at what follows.
Steve could sue Dr. Blake, yes. But what good would that do? He’d just get a slap on the wrist and be on his merry way, free to hurt others like his Tony. No…Steve has to do something about that.
“We’ve talked about this Steve, it’s just a sandwich, it’s not like you’re serving me on a silver platter to be sacrificed to pagan gods. This isn’t about control, it’s just about you being hungry and not me.”
Squeals and laughter broke through several conversations as Tony blew a raspberry on the baby’s stomach. A second later, Tony was off to greet his guests, a smiling baby at his hip.
“Thank you Sir. They were killed by the Resistance when I was very young but I was always well taken care of at the orphanage. They are directly overseen by the High Commander, you see, so they are good places for children to grow up in. Very safe.”
Steve pulled Tony right back into his arms and breathed in for the first time in weeks.
“Steve.”
But why was this even bothering him NOW? He was forty-seven years old! He had at this point of his life spent more time with Steve than he’d ever spent on his own, of course he knew his husband, of course he knew their relationship!
As far as excuses go, Tony must admit that that’s a pretty good one. Hell even Jane wouldn’t have known how to react to that one.
“Is everything alright sweetheart?”
The name Alaska had actually been Tony’s suggestion and Rhodey had gone ahead with it after learning that the original Alaska had been his granddaughter. For Steve it was a bittersweet full circle, for Tony it was the world’s most perfect name for the world’s most perfect little girl.
“No Tony, I’m just in love.”
“Thanks Tony.” Whispers Bruce.
When Tony told Steve he wanted them to have a party to celebrate their 20th anniversary, Steve was touched. The fact he said it while Steve was buried deep inside him, Tony’s arms wrapped tightly around his broad back, his voice rough and gasping, probably helped secure it. By the next morning Tony was already throwing around ideas and asking JARVIS to compile a list of venues.
“Jus’ beer”
“His behavior is very different Sir. I don’t see the resemblance anymore.”
If Steve was in the middle of writing a detailed report and Tony spurted out that he needed a break, Steve simply saved his work and stood up. No, “Just give me half an hour Tony,” no, “I’ll meet you in the living room in a bit.”
He thinks of the way Peggy slid the contract to him.
It sounds like such a well-rehearsed line that it’s almost automatic. Tony cannot believe his ears. Steve had sacrificed everything to have his own children, it had been the driving factor behind Steve’s infidelity, the cause for their breakup, the reason for his marriage to Peggy.
“What? Of course not. It just means you’re good at compromising.”
“Is Ms. Rhodes in?”
They’d been so young, and while that was an easy thing to say it embodied a myriad of complicated concepts. What Tony really meant was that they’d been so in love, so horny, so unhealthily co-dependent that Steve leaving killed Tony. Now here they were, over twenty years later and Steve had become a kidnapper and a criminal all so he could reclaim that lost era.
“Would you like me in a beard?”
“But what about SI?”
“How can you possible still find me attractive Steve?”
“Glad to hear it… is it very different here than where you grew up?”
Steve agreed with Tony, over half the team did in fact, Natasha, Clint, Sam and Rhodey nodded their heads but both Bucky and Cap refused to budge. They had to eventually, if they wanted to be on the team, but they weren’t happy about it.
“In my defence, they left them right there on his desk!”
“It’s far, It’ll cost ya”
He startles and looks up, his eyes darting to the digital clock in the wall. Embarrassed he looks down to check if he should change into something nicer. The door unlocks, opens and Tony registers the sounds of Arlen and Vivi greeting each other. He hears Arlen’s tiara fall on the floor for the hundredth time this week and the sound of Siggi and Harley running down the stairs. Then he finally looks up.
There was comfort and reassurance in Steve’s voice but it did nothing to soothe him.
Johann Schmidt, a Vietnam War vet, looks the very image of a movie villain. According to the story, he’d lost his good looks after a grenade went off in front of him during the war, but Steve doubts it.
“What?”
It’s such a Tony thing to say that Steve can’t help the watery chuckle that leaves his lips. This is how they were, how they’d always been. Steve could get so caught up in something, in an art piece, in a project, on a technicality, that he’d lose sight of everything around him. It was Tony who’d always brought the world back into perspective. Tony who always challenged him to see the whole picture and gave him new inspiration.
Steve smiled, gently, sweetly. “Some of them are” he answered and that had to be enough. Trying to pry stories out of Steve was harder than international politics.
Now, High Commander Rogers was all there was. He was a good ruler to the common people, he introduced old laws back into the continent, encouraged the formation of local governments and even the rebuilding of territories. He had clear, concrete laws that did not discriminate, protected the basic rights of every citizen and made every human equal under the law. It was such an improvement from the Supreme Leader’s approach that the High Commander was universally adored.
“It’s ok, just try not to hurt yourself more. Do you want me to make you an omelette?”
“Why don’t you just wear flats then?”
Despite the daily medication. Despite the plastic mugs that sometimes clatter on the floor. Despite the bruises on his arms from when he misjudges a distance and hits himself against a door frame… he’s happy.
Steve came to a stop behind Tony, his eyes reading over the list of names in the screen.
All his careful planning was about to pay off and Steve felt giddy at the proximity of climax. In exactly thirteen days Steve would finally have Tony Stark in his arms.
Tony realized then that while he was indeed naked, Steve wasn’t, which was obviously both a tremendous relief and a complete disappointment.
“Well that’s great, cuz he’s my science bro!”
Pepper had once told Steve that she’d actually come into SI’s employment in 2001 after a long list of failed EA’s marched through Tony’s office. Steve was planning on skipping the ‘failed’ part and just going right into Pepper, but for that to happen they still had to go through a hiring process. So Steve used SHIELD to find Ms. Virginia Potts who was working for a small start-up company owned by another individual Steve liked to keep close tabs of, Aldrich Killian.
Tony stayed close to the comforting warmth, kept his hand fisted on the shirt that smelled like softener and fell asleep thinking of the boy he fell in love with when he was just fifteen… he’d think about what that meant tomorrow.
‘Well I’ll be goddamned’ Steve thought.
Tony never bothers telling anyone the whole truth, it’s not any of their business after all. It’s not until Vivi Keener and her two spawn come along that Tony’s world is cracked wide open in a way it hasn’t been in almost a decade. Tony meets Harley Keener first, he’s a small kid, all baggy clothes, a backpack that it’s obviously being hoped he’ll grow into at some point in the next century, and a look of sadness in his eyes that is out of place in a nine year old. The kid is being dragged forward, by the hand, by an excited Siggy who proudly introduces her new friend to Tony.
“I guess it wouldn’t hurt to get to know my biological Dad a bit.”
“Alright, drive safely” He handed Steve’s credentials back to him, not even bothering to look at Tony whose cheek was squished against the side of the travel donut.
“The heels were killing my feet”
She pushed away but kept her hands on his forearms. The High Commander noticed then that she wasn’t wearing any shoes and she followed his gaze down to her naked feet with a mischievous grin.
Leaning forward, Steve captures Tony’s mouth. It’s a soft touch of lips, a wet drag of moisture that tastes like coffee. Just as teeth come in to play, Tony turns his head in a specific way that unfortunately pokes at Steve’s bruised cheekbone. The wince it elicits stops Tony cold.
“Three days ago. I was in Haiti.”
He had a rough landing, but the lake broke his fall nicely. While he’d been known for jumping out of planes without a chute in his youth, he hadn’t tried something like that in more years than he cared to count. Soaked, he made his way out of the Hudson River and looked up.
For the most part, Tony and Steve spent a large portion of their day in Tony’s very own state of the art workshop, comfortably located in the bowels of their lovely home. That Monday was no exception, he’d just finished his weekly meeting with Peter, his eyes running over the schematics and algorithms Peter’s team had just given birth to when something tugged at him. It wasn’t a physical thing, wasn’t even a biological need, it was just… something that was off. In retrospect, Tony would not be able to explain what exactly compelled him to go upstairs.
“You haven’t been drugging me as much”
“Steve, what exactly are you trying to protect me from?”
That same evening Tony started the time consuming work of installing JARVIS all over the house.
“Steve… take off your shirt.”
Steve did believe him, knew Tony didn’t actually have a cheating bone in his body. It still didn’t keep him from thoroughly examining Tony’s cock and balls for lipstick or the scent of the cheap perfume though. While this instance proved to be nothing, it did plant a seed in Steve’s head.
“Why? What happened between you two?”
“Steeevee!”
They would rebuild, they would survive but Steve wondered if the original dimension had.
The Commander shot to his feet at the sound of a car pulling up. He considered rushing downstairs like a dog but strategy said otherwise. He needed for his first meeting with Tony to happen without either Maria or Jarvis around.
“Don’t be silly Tony, we will never be apart. I won’t let you.”
“Soon it won’t be weird at all.”
He takes in the way Tony’s eyes are sparkling with excitement. He’s been doing much better lately under the new treatment Dr. Banner has him on and it shows… God does it show. Tony is glowing with energy.
“Keep him in there. Can you arrange pickup?”
Exhaling the panicked breath of air he’d taken, Tony forced his lungs to breathe normally again. He moved his head closer and closer until his forehead was pressed against Steve’s and his manic eyes were focused on Tony’s.
Steve touched Tony more after that, sweet, chaste touches that left Tony feeling reluctantly comforted. Steve’s favorite thing to do now was read to Tony with his head on the blonde’s lap. When he got tired of that he put Tony’s head on his chest and read aloud while running his fingers through the brown hair that still had some blonde dye left at the tips. With each passing day Tony was beginning to wonder if Steve was trying to create a human cat. Steve was all gentle touches and soft kisses to temples, cheeks, nose and hands. He was all about feeding Tony, reading to Tony, taking care of Tony so much so that it took Tony longer than it should have to realize he was feeling less clumsy one late afternoon. His mind was also sharper, he could remember what he’d had for lunch (a chicken sandwich) and the chapter of the Da Vinci code Steve had read to him earlier that day.
“No Tony, I’m serious. I think being away from New York would be great for us.”
Steve knew Cap and the Winter Soldier would eventually try to run things their way, would try to undermine the UN so he had JARVIS keep a close eye on them. Unfortunately as these things go, time brought the team closer together. Most of them had officially moved to the new Avengers compound (formerly known as Stark Mansion) so they lived together, trained together, went on mission together. Steve could no longer control how much exposure Tony had to the others, he could only stand close and observe.
“Natalie Rushman’s real name is Natasha Romanov, she’s a SHIELD agent. She was a friend and the closest thing to a sister I ever knew. I am not, nor will I ever be interested in her, in that way.”
But it’s been over a decade since he was last here. Not since he met Tony…
“Director Fury. Did he brief you about me at all?”
Steve didn’t lie. He told him about the mirror dimensions, explained how he’d come here from his own volition to try to make a difference. He left out more than he mentioned, didn’t care to include how this dimension was in fact, his tireless creation. Howard for his part hung onto every word, couldn’t tear his eyes away from his old friend.
“Johann.”
The receptionist nodded but kept her gaze low as she pressed the button that opened the bullet proof glass door. She kept it that way until the High Commander’s boots could be heard no more from where she stood.
Peggy didn’t bother with a retort, they’d had this discussion too many times before.
“My whole life wasted because I just couldn’t let go of a childhood friend. A friend who had no trouble tossing me aside for his own happiness… I know I hurt you Tony, I know I hurt you so bad you’ve been scared of falling in love with anyone ever since, but I’ve been hurtin’ too baby. I’ve been in hell for over twenty years.”
The rambling usually reduced Steve to quiet laughter, he’d listen to Tony go on and on enjoying every sentence that poured out. The only time Tony was quiet was when he was working and oh… what a shock it had it been when Steve realized young Tony Stark did not work with loud heavy rock music blasting in the background. Twenty-year old Tony Stark worked in silence, muttering things to himself every now and then, completely lost in his own brain.
He nodded in acknowledgement and the aid retreated. High Commander Rogers looked out the window of the tower onto a cityscape full of high-rises. He allowed himself to drown in the memory of the dear face of someone from long ago, someone with mirthful eyes, a teasing smirk and a style of beard long since banned. With a sharp exhale he tore himself away from the window and marched to the elevator.
“What are you smirking about old man?” There’s teasing warmth in Stephen’s tone and Tony feels free to release his laughter.
Steve smiled, a sad little smile while placing a new bottle of water on the bedside table.
So Steve told him about the possible kidnapping, about terrorists and torture until Tony ended it by pressing the palm of his hand against Steve’s mouth.
“So am I!” Exclaims Sigrid, pure cheeky confidence in her voice that brings Tony into a full belly laugh.
The punishments for breaking any laws, however, were still often final and usually painful beyond words.
Who would have thought?
What type of person had Steve been? Steve was a Commander, a fighter, a politician and a leader. He’d fought against something called the ‘resistance’ and… resistance to what, or to whom? When Eliza first greeted Steve she’d raised her hand in a way that reminded him of Hydra… what if… no. No, Tony was not going there. Steve weeded out Hydra ops in this universe in the most methodical, precise manner possible and never showed them an ounce of mercy. No, Steve HATED Hydra. He might have developed that greeting system to bring Hydra-friendly people over to his faction, it was a very tactical Steve-like thing to do. But he could ask, just to be sure… he could ask.
As soon as the impact-resistant glass of the workshop slid open for him, he could hear it. It was Steve’s voice alright and he sounded angry but not nearly as angry as the other voice that was with him, none other than Captain Steve Rogers himself. Tony had spent enough time as an Avenger to recognize the difference between their voices with ease. Part of him wanted to walk right in and interrupt whatever was going on, but another part, an older, wiser part, made him walk closer as quietly as possible.
Tony’s eyebrows raise in surprise. “And when did this new development happen?”
Tony exhales a mirthless sound that could have been a chuckle but is more like a sigh. Of course Stephen understands….of course he knows. Stephen outlived his beloved wife after all, and while Steve is still very much alive, Tony’s Steve, the man he loved for a decade, died a long time ago.
“Steve, what exactly were we back in your ‘verse? Like were we together?”
“How could you possibly have messed this up? This is not a difficult job! It just requires a little care, that’s all!”
‘Keep your friends close but your enemies closer’ Steve reminded himself while shaking Dr. Hansen’s hand on her first day of work.
Large, warm palms wrapped around Tony’s shoulders, his clothed chest pressed against Tony’s naked back.
“I get that but does she really need to have volunteered two years in South America building houses for orphans?”
Tony’s lips feel warm and alive. His mouth is soft and moist and everything Steve wants in this world. His arms are strong enough to hold onto Steve, yet faulty because sometimes they do unclench despite their owner’s will.
Now he’s a guardian, the sole guardian to this blonde, blue eyed newborn in his arms. He never actually imagined this to be a real possibility back when he’d signed the paperwork that Jane shoved under his nose during the first months of her pregnancy. He signed the papers as a courtesy, a gesture, but never did he believe that he would actually have to be more than ‘Uncle Tony’ to the baby.
Tony replied with “oh’kay” and managed to drop his pants faster than Steve thought possible. Enjoying the view but keeping himself in check, Steve gave Tony the soap bar and told him to wash himself while he retrieved a clean towel from under the sink. What Steve never expected however was for Tony’s hands to fly straight to his cock and begin stroking up and down with strong, practiced strokes. The soap made it easy for Tony and soon he was rocking into it, lost in the sensation and chasing after it while the water cascaded down his body. The sight of it was more than Steve could bear and as he watched Tony climax, Steve took long breaths to calm his own raging lust.
“Does he make you happy?”
Steve recovered quickly, extended his hand, ignored Natasha’s sudden interest in the tall blonde man in the room. She’d probably been assigned to keep an eye on Tony, but if she could manage to manipulate Tony’s partner then all the better.
She invaded his company, stole it right from under him and then made him take a plea deal. Fuck Peggy Carter and fuck gentrification.
“Do you want him to live forever?” He’d been asked, once… by someone… Vision maybe.
He wonders for a moment, in a fit of hysteria, whether he’s meant to use the seven-year-old as a shield.
“Lieutenant Eliza Copper, Sir”
“You have never hurt me Tony.”
“But why? Why do you love me so much?”
Likewise, the more Tony looked the harder he seemed to obsess over Steve’s behaviour. If someone had asked him a year ago who held the whip in their relationship, he would have automatically replied that it was Steve. After all, it was Steve who woke him up every morning, Steve who prepared his coffee, Steve who insisted on making breakfast and sometimes suggested a particular suit for Tony to wear. It was Steve who called lunch time and dinner time and break times. It was Steve who knew where everything in the tower was and who reminded Tony of important things. Steve managed their whole lives and Tony had never minded one tiny little bit.
“You ok babe?”
The look Steve directed towards a very young looking Alexander Pierce carried such weight that it froze the other man to the spot.
Steve should have seen it coming, he’d been suspicious about the whole thing, had silently wondered about the all the meetings and guests lists and details. He should have suspected, but how on earth could he have imagined this?
“You love me?”
“Well you of course. We look after each other.”
Slowly Steve brought them out of the kiss, soothing his lust with small pecks to Tony’s swollen lips.
“Peanut butter coming right up!”
“That’s because you’re easy to please, my love.”
As the dining room table and the kitchen return to a tidy state, the visitors shift to say their goodbyes. Hugging Natasha and Bruce goodbye is easy for Tony and Sigrid, they exchange pleasantries and part with Natasha promising, one again, to be back soon with their baby. As the Banners move away to say goodbye to Stephen and the children, Loki comes forth next. He smiles charmingly down at his niece before kneeling down to her level and opening his arms theoretically wide. Eyes sparkling, Sigrid takes the invite with a laugh and they hug with such sincere affection that Thor is left nursing visible jealousy. While to them all it may look like Siggy and Loki have hit it off, Tony knows the truth behind the affection; Loki is just too damn good looking to refuse a hug from. While both Jane and Tony had preferred blondes, Sigrid’s tastes already seem to veer toward tall, dark and handsome.
Somewhere in the frenzy of lips and tongues, Tony wonders whether he’ll be able to sit down today at all.
It occurred to Steve then that he no longer had to worry about telling Tony half-truths about his parents’ death. He wouldn’t need to feign guilt at learning of their terrible demise and chase after the Winter Soldier under the pretense of vengeance. Suddenly feeling quite perked up, Steve leaned in to kiss Tony’s full lips. Could people get better looking with age? He wondered. He himself barely aged at all and all those around him who had had seemed all the lesser for it. But not Tony, no, with each year his boy grew more handsome, more charming, more himself. Steve pecked the full lips against his, pecked the nose and the cheeks. They had dinner plans with Maria and Howard that weekend, to celebrate Tony’s third PhD. He would worry about how this would affect his plans then, for now he tore himself apart with an apology and went to pack a quick bag.
Tony eventually agreed, after all, he had hundreds of ideas he wanted to get to before he hit fifty and his pre-scheduled mid-life crisis began (he’d already warned Steve they were taking two months off for it and they’d be dyeing their hair purple and orange so they could tour the world).
“Speak for yourself old man! I’m not an octogenarian yet!” Yelled Clint.
Tony stared at the cell phone in his hands for longer than he’d care to admit. He was sitting on the loveseat close to the chimney in the living room wearing sweatpants, fluffy socks and a sweater. They’d finished eating breakfast in the kitchen island two hours ago but had somehow gotten to talking about nothing in particular. The sound of Steve putting a cup of tea on the coffee table in front of Tony made the brunette suddenly freeze and look at Steve.
The all consuming rage is back. Like an itching, horrible sunburn. Tony (as always) soothes the symptoms with his sweetness and love, but elsewhere… outside… Steve is losing control.
“So that’s what you look like dumbstruck.” Tony muttered.
Bucky had never loved him, he’d always known that and Steve had been fine knowing it because he didn’t really love Bucky either. They’d loved each other in their own way, with a mixture of platonic, familial and sometimes passionate love that had suited them just fine on the road. The main problem lay in that Bucky had never really been bisexual, he’d just been bi-curious and Steve? Steve was as gay as they came. So while Bucky had supplemented his sexual desires with the bar women of the Southwest United States, Steve had been happy with getting a little dick action from Bucky every now and then.
Should he be disturbed that Steve had been hearing every word he’d said to the wonder twins? That Steve felt the need to invade his so-called-privacy because Tony pushed on and got what he wanted? He should, he really should and yet, when he weighed the two courses of action before him, he knew which he preferred.
“Yes Mr. Stark.”
Tony’s palm slides in to fill Steve’s left hand, soft and warm against his chilled fingers. He’d opted for leaving the house gloveless so as to make it easier when he came back home, but now his fingers are numb.
Tony managed to pull back the snort that wanted to explode its way through his nostrils. He even caught Steve forcing his lips to remain in a straight line.
Tony leaned into the touch even as his concentration remained on the phone’s holograms, moving bright and clear in front of his eyes.
“I don’t care, just put on sunscreen.”
It was not pity, but it was tinted with pain. As if Tony had finally understood how much Steve’s personality was dependent on his husband. As if he was finally coming to understand that without Tony, there was no Steve.
“It’s given me a reason to live.” Tony finally replies and he hates how true it really is. If it hadn’t been for Sigrid, Tony never would have survived Steve.
“The girl I was dancing with got pretty handsy, but I pushed her off right away Steve I swear.”
This tactic ends up working rather well, because by the time all three adults wake up from their own accidental naps, it’s one in the morning and Vivi declares “Fudge it, we’re staying.”
The look of pure surprise and joy that lit up Tony’s whole face ignited a warmth inside Steve. It felt like retribution, glowed like forgiveness in its strength. ‘I can do this.’ He thought. ‘I can make things right.’
“Any news on the East?”
“You don’t need tears right now.” Steve excused and Tony’s returning smile told him he was forgiven. “I love you so much. You know that right?”
“You’re sore.”
“Good thing it’s almost lunch time. We still have a full house?”
“We are as different as night and day. You have never known a day’s suffering in your life. I know you think you know everything, but you know shit and I’ll be there to remind you that you know shit for as long as you live.”
‘Why?’ he asked himself. ‘Why can’t you have it again?’
“Perhaps I could stay at a hotel and come back tomorrow?” Suggests Thor, his gaze focused on Sigrid.
Her excitement becomes nausea all too quickly, for finally, after all these years she finally understands why her Daddy does not want to date other guys. After all, why would he want to when his partner just up and left him for a woman?
There was dead silence on the other side of the line, as if Peggy was weighing whether or not to answer, then suddenly a resolute sounding “Yes” echoed.
Wrapping his thick muscular arms around Tony, Steve pulled the boy closer until their naked chests pressed together.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you all. I’m Stephen Strange.”
“He isn’t. SHIELD has more rats than you think”
Eliza had a long drive back to New York ahead of her, yet it was a trip she gladly took every single week just to see them. It made Tony feel special, but sometimes it also made him a little suspicious. He wasn’t foolish enough to disregard the possibility that Steve could be using Eliza as a mole. The girl may very well be his eyes and ears inside the Avengers, but could he really fault his husband for it? Steve was simply trying to keep an eye on the team and this was the most unobtrusive way of doing it.
Steve knew exactly what Tony was up to down in this workshop. He tried giving the genius some space to build the armour but after the first ‘thump’ Steve couldn’t help himself. He walked into the workshop amidst Tony doing a test run of the boot repulsors.
Should he touch his hand in reassurance? Maybe just a tap, not no, it was still too soon…
“No one will ever hurt you again baby.” Steve whispers as he feels Tony’s tears smearing on his neck.
Tony’s eyes widened, his lips pursed in confusion. “You’ve never told me that before.”
“I’m so happy I’m terrified.”
It was 4:14am, January 1st 2000 when Tony whispered the question close to Steve’s ear on the pillow they were sharing. They’d dozed off shortly after sex but obviously Tony was still too buzzed to stay asleep.
Tony remembered sitting on the swing set at the old Stark mansion, trying his best to build enough momentum to swing when his legs were too short and his weight too small.
“More than life itself.”
“What do you want from me Steve?”
“No. Unfortunately that just wasn’t in the cards for us.”
“Honey, everything's coming up roses and daffodils.”
Leave it to Alaska to be worried about him at a time like this.
“Thank you Liz! Don’t I get a birthday hug?”
“She’s right here.” The sound of Sigrid’s voice startles Thor out of his daze. He looks up at the child to find her pointing at the mantle. He follows the finger all the way to an urn decorated with beautiful images of colourful flowers, on to a plaque on the polished porcelain that reads JANE FOSTER. “Grandma didn’t want to take Mom’s ashes so we kept her here with us.”
“It turned out great.”
“Arlen slow down!” Warns Harley who is not far behind.
He smothers the thought quickly. Big birthday celebrations had once upon a time been a tradition for him. Some had been organized by Steve, others by his friends, but the birthday that suddenly stands out the most is the first one he spent in this house with Sigrid. When he made pancakes instead of cake and laughed while watching the joy in Siggy’s face as she stuffed the pillow-like treats into her tiny mouth.
“Tell you what handsome, let’s start again. Hi, I’m Tony, I’m a scatterbrained genius who’s also Iron Man and I like coffee. Now who are you?”
“Well we’re thankful for having you. Say, where DID you receive your training? I’ve seen you spar with Natasha and you can definitely hold your own.”
“I did what I had to, to secure all of this. Those people all worked for Hydra.”
And he needs to get there now.
“You figured it out eventually.”
Now? Tony was beginning to see through the façade of the daily routine. He was beginning to notice how much Steve’s behaviour depended on Tony’s reactions, on his moods, on his needs. If Tony felt like an omelette that morning, Steve made them both omelettes, no questions, no suggestions, no “Well, I feel like having pancakes today.”
Tony kissed him, wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and pulled him in the way he knew Steve liked. Eventually he gave in, despite his instincts Steve gave in to the plan.
“Steve I can’t go back to that room, it’s too cold”
“You live here as well?” Asks Loki, discretely taking her in.
While the Stark household remained a bubble of stability and contentment, the world outside continued at its usual neck breaking speed.
Killian, it seemed, had continually made her uncomfortable with constant requests to go out on a date. Ironically enough, the young red-head felt safe in Tony’s employment because it was obvious he was in a committed relationship and felt that Tony had no sexual interest in her whatsoever.
Tony had managed to use the iron resources from melting all their commercial gun stock to win construction contracts left and right, effectively defying the odds while owning more of his own company. In a week stock went back up, in a month when SI Construction was kicked into gear (thanks to the acquisition of several small construction companies) with contracts all over the US, stock was as high as ever.
The streets he’s walking on look the same as they’ve always had. They’re still much too rough for the hipsters, still shady enough for the drug dealers and bookies and everything in between to do business off of. It takes him a bit, but after a few turns he eventually finds the bar he’s looking for- The Hydra.
“I was just thinking about Natasha”
Soon it was mid-2007 and Steve was panicking.
“They found someone of interest and I need to make sure they keep him right where he is.”
The sound of soft steps on hardwood forced Steve to focus on the touch he knew was coming. Sure enough, a pair of strong arms wrapped around his waist from behind. Steve felt the definition of those arms with his hands, felt the strength of the muscles beneath the soft skin. Tony was filling out nicely in his twentieth year, muscles lifting plains of smooth skin that had been previously occupied with tender fat. It was to be expected, between all the engineering work he did, the improvement in his diet thanks to Steve’s efforts and their shared exercise routines.
“You were just in the closet Steve, that’s fine. I mean I was in the closet for the longest time, although can it still be considered a closet if you’re bi? Or are you just partly in the closet at that point? And who the hell came up with a closet to begin with? Why couldn’t it be under a bed or a drawer or something? It is it exclusive to furniture?...”
“You know he will.”
“Don’t be a stranger.” Tony says instead, a bittersweet smile on his lips which Thor returns.
“You ain’t sorry at all you little shit! And look! The bag is fucking drenched!”
It is the sign of a great Commander to recognize the makings of a great General. As a great Commander in his own right, Steve took a step back as Tony took on the SI board of directors with the techniques of divide and conquer. There was pure focused force of will behind Tony now. He targeted specific board members and effectively divided until the majority vote conquered the fate of Stark Industries. In just a month Stark Industries announced it would cease its current weapon development effective immediately, they’d fulfill their current government contracts but no more. The backlash was tremendous, stock collapsed and as more cheap shares flooded the market Tony instructed Jarvis to buy and buy.
By the time Sigrid is ten, Tony’s sense of time is lost to chaos. His weekdays are all about homework and dinner and movies and snacks and weird kitchen experiments concocted in the minds of children with a love for fire and explosions. He gets plenty of work done (he thinks, after all they haven’t fired him from his job yet) but by the time school is done it’s a mad dash to get three kids fed and homework done before Vivi comes to pick up her two terrors. The only times when Tony is actually alone is during those short hours spent alone in his office, working. Any other time is spent either in the company of a child (or children) or with Vivi and/or Stephen.
Tony looked at the cell phone in his hand in awe at the masterful way he’d just lied to Pepper and knowing full well that no one would ever hear a different sequence of events from him. He came back to himself to the feel of Steve gently touching his knee then promptly lost himself again in Steve’s adoring blue eyes and beaming smile. Slowly, Steve learned forward into Tony’s space and Tony closed the gap between them by pressing his lips against Steve’s. It was just a caress at first, lips against lips until Tony pushed his lower lip in between Steve’s, successfully coaxing the mouth’s blonde open. They kissed until they ran out of breath and were finally pulled apart by the shrill sound of the cell phone ringing.
At twenty-two Tony looked far too young to be CEO of one of the biggest companies in America and Steve knew it was starting to bother him more and more. Rinsing his razor Steve turned to look over at Tony who was examining his face on his side of the mirror.
“Will you give the class a try? For me?”
Brown eyes widened in realization.
“It’s all up to you Tony”
With his head full of the past the High Commander didn’t quite realize he’d walked into the high ranking Staff’s floor of Stark Industries until the surprised receptionist was shooting to her feet. Such had been his elation at seeing the machine almost completed, that he hadn’t thought about leaving straightaway.
“Really Steve?” Natasha looks about ready to cause Steve bodily harm and Tony wonders if they discussed this while they were in their car… on their way here… from New York… where Steve is apparently divorced from Peggy Carter.
“Why don’t we all sit down. Can I offer you anything? How about some water? Ice water? Siggy could you help me with the drinks please?”
Steve held Tony’s jawline in his large palms, crushed their foreheads together in a sort of dramatic non-kiss.
“But there’s still so much to do.”
“Yes. I think we need a new policy on working remotely. The current one is
Hours later, as they lay in bed together watching the day’s sun set, Steve ran careful hands over Tony’s skin. His eyes catalogued every line, every spot, every vein. Years back such close scrutiny would have made Tony feel self-conscious, these days however he understood it as a sort of foreplay. Regardless of how Tony chose to view it, the Commander’s satisfaction at watching Tony’s body change before his eyes, under his touch, was too great to describe.
“No madam, I haven’t had the pleasure yet.”
The pride with which she said it left Tony in awe, reminded him of how badly he’d wanted to impress his father when he was a kid. He used to preen at even the slightest compliment from Howard and he wondered if he’d looked to his father the same way Eliza looked to Tony now.
He tears his gaze away from the closed door and right onto the bearded face of a man he’d once known.
Steve drove, his eyes on the road at all times. He gave into the temptation of looking at the backseat only twice in their forty minute ride to the motel. In the backseat, fully strapped in sat Tony looking the very picture of a tired businessman taking a nap, his head resting lightly on the window beside him. Steve had disposed of Tony’s phone as soon as they went through the Bronx, thrown it over the window in a seedy looking street. Steve wore dark leather gloves in the car and he knew the rain would wipe out both his tire marks and possibly the phone. Thankfully if someone in these parts did find the Stark Phone, it would probably be used for parts and not turned to the police.
He is Tony Stark and finally, at thirty-six years of age, he is himself.
“I don’t know, it doesn’t sound like…”
“Steve, stubborn-as-a-mule, likes-to-pick-fights”
Eventually both Eliza and Steve Rogers made their way to the group. Eliza greeted the new arrivals warmly although it was obvious she was trying to reign herself back. Had they been in the comfort of the Stark’s home, she would have rushed into Tony arms as she usually did, but that would have raised too many questions here.
“Tell you what Steve, you feel free to trust and support my son any way you feel he needs it and we’ll see whose approach was more successful.”
Two days later, it’s Christmas and they spend the day pretending not to worry while never straying further than an inch from each other. Instead of words they exchange kisses and warm caresses. Time alone means time to think, so emptiness becomes the enemy. They drag each other everywhere, talk to each other constantly, watch anything and listen to everything. They are beneath each other’s skin more than ever before, and it never truly stops even after Dr. Blake calls on December the 27
The call ends, Tony sets his laptop back on the coffee table and a stern look affixes to his features.
“Yeah Tony, I do”
“Yes!” The kids shout, a strange excitement in their faces.
There’s heavy steps on the floorboards, moving left… moving right. Getting ready. Tony wonders if he’s been heard.
He contemplates the paper for a bit, reads the wording and the name of the class. He’s never really thought about it, sure he always stops to admire the pieces on the studio window but he’s never thought about trying it himself. For him, art has always been a necessity, a means to a career. He was good at structural drawing so he went to school for architecture but he never thought about it as a fun activity.
“Is that what you’re working on?”
High Commander Rogers honest-to-goodness chuckled into the girl’s dark hair. Her natural tendencies of force feeding those she cared about made him feel like that trait had been hard wired onto Pepper and Rhodey’s DNA from the start.
“Steeeve!”
When had the noise begun then? Had it been after the loss of his parents? The loss of Edwin Jarvis? Had it begun to drown out the lure of drugs and alcohol?
The strangest look came over Tony then, an indulgent glow as if Steve was a petulant child.
“No. The best thing you can do for him is store him with Howard. In a few decades and with better technology we might be able to do something for him but not right now. Have you talked to him?”
“The Steve Rogers that just came out of the ice is a sanctimonious child with no knowledge or understanding of the real world. That makes him dangerous.”
He hadn’t always been like this, so willing to live in the grey, so open to options, without a compass always pointing north. At his age, Tony was his moral compass. If Tony thought something to be right, Steve did it, if he thought something was wrong or evil, he didn’t do it. All that was left of the old Captain Rogers were memories that made him too frustrated to think about. But Steve didn’t say any of that, Steve only approached his husband and listened to Tony rant while running gentle fingers up and down muscular arms.
“There’s so many kids around here that most everything is bound to be sticky.” Tony explains, enjoying the various looks of unease that flash across their faces. “So Thor, when did you get back state-side?”
“YOU KNEEEW!”
Not that Steve does badly for himself… on the contrary.
“Are you asking for ransom?”
“Actually Buck… I’m learning sculpting.”
“Excuse us, is this where the geriatric party is being held?”
“That’s very kind of him, isn’t it kind Thor?”
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it” Said Steve before Tony could intervene.
Had they been in college still? He and Jane had been, working on their Masters. They’d all been out partying, celebrating something but there hadn’t been enough room on the couch for everyone so Jane slept on their bed. Steve and Tony were the only ones with whom Jane ever felt comfortable crashing on the same bed with. She’d always been so careful, his Jane, so even-headed. Her only blunder was falling in love with Thor. But had that really been a mistake when it led to Siggy being born? No… Siggy hadn’t been a mistake, or a blunder or an indiscretion. She is a gift… in fact love is a gift.
“Fiiiine. Take it off.”
It’s nearly 9pm on a Thursday in what must be the coldest September on record in New York City, so Steve is understandably confused by the greeting.
“That’s not what I mean! Look, I know I have a temper and I know I’m stubborn as hell, but everything about you makes me feel better. I don’t know what it is about you, but there’s something… like the way you know how to give me space when I’m having a bad day! Or the way you always manage to fix everything… like remember last week when we went to the park and some asshole dumped all his fucking soda on me? I was about to punch the guy and you just… you just laughed and bought a water bottle and helped me clean up. I don’t know what it is about you Tony but you just… you’re perfect for me baby.”
“Hi Tony” Bruce smiles, sweaty and older than Tony remembers but the smile is genuine.
The second opinion comes in the form of Dr. Bruce Banner, who with the help of a local Neurosurgeon, spots what no one else has discovered before.
“Awful lot of driving ahead of you, isn’t it?”
“What?”
“He could have had it all.” Bruce whispers.
“Naw, you look fine sugar.”
“I’ll be close enough to MIT to keep an eye on him and far enough not to crowd him”
“Uncle Stephen lives here?” Asks Harley, surprise coloring every syllable.
“It’ll be good for both of them.” Whispered Steve as his arms wrapped around Tony like an anaconda wrapped around prey.
He muttered, his puffy lips and slow tongue barely making out the words. Taking off Tony’s stained shirt Steve opened the hot water spray, knowing it would come colder at first. He watched over Tony as the spray hit his body, soaking his jeans through and making Tony whimper in discomfort.
Siggy’s ninth year brings new people into Tony’s tiny circle of friends. It’d never bothered him, this secluded existence he seems to be leading. After all, he spends most of his time being a Dad and keeping up with the daily grind to actually maintain any real friendships. He keeps good relations with the other school parents, goes to a few barbecues during the year and he knows his neighbours. To those who know Tony and Siggy superficially, he is just a single Dad looking after his daughter (“Where’s the Mom?” They always ask someone else. “She’s dead.” Someone always replies.) To those who know Tony and Siggy personally, he’s actually Siggy’s uncle, (“Where’s her mom?” They ask. “She was Tony’s sister. She passed years ago.” Someone replies).
Steve took to the role of ‘fun’ older friend easily. He’d enjoyed spending time with the boys, joining in on the teasing, letting them have their fun nights out and nursing their hangovers. He gave them a wide berth to be their stupid selves but at the same time treated them like equals. Rhodey worshipped Steve, thought him the best soldier in US Military history and made it a point to listen to the great Captain America. So when Steve took hold of the young man’s shoulder and assured him that Tony was in good hands, Rhodey went off to serve with a clear conscience.
He wonders what would have become of him had he not had Siggy to look after. He wonders if he would have spent that first birthday without Steve alone, drunk and crying in his empty apartment.
Tony nods, willing to listen to Bruce lie if only out of courtesy. If that was true they would have checked in on him months ago instead of ignoring him as if he isn’t worth a fucking text message. They’d all known each other since high school; they’d practically grown up together, been a tight knit group, family even… the joke is on him now.
“I know. But it’s best if he’s not close”
He’d had many once, but little by little they’d all passed away. Some died in battle during the turbulent years of the rise of the Supreme Leader. One or two, he’d killed himself. Others, like Natasha, died of old age. Only a few of the original Avengers remained, Vision who was now in charge of Research and Development at Stark Industries, the Hulk who was somewhere in the galaxy smashing things and his old friend Bucky Barnes, who now sat old and grey in a specially designed cell just for him. His serum, it seemed, did not slow the aging progress as much as Dr. Erskine’s formula had, so eventually Bucky Barnes had grown too frail to oppose him.
“Everyone, this is my friend Vivi and her kids Harley…” Tony uses a free hand to ruffle Harley’s hair before bringing it back to rest on Arlen’s knee. “and Arlen. Vivi meet Bruce, Natasha, Steve, Thor and Loki.”
“Sorry.”
Eventually Cap caught on, tried to stay clear of Steve and consequently away from Tony. Steve liked this, thought it healthy and was infinitely pleased when a newly restructured SHIELD sent both Cap and Bucky to Washington under Sharon’s wing.
They looked at each other with equally besotted smiles until Tony broke the moment by moving both hands to firmly squeeze Steve’s butt cheeks, yanking a laugh out of the man. Minutes later they untangled from the soft embrace to put on their shoes and together, they left the comfort of their home for the warm ocean breeze.
It delights Steve… this power he has over people who work for him.
Steve bent his head to kiss Tony’s forehead.
“We definitely don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. It was really just a thought.”
“What if they do want you to fight again Steve? Those people are dangerous, they can’t be trusted!”
“But why if you never argue? Is that a bad thing?”
The death of Edwin Jarvis hit Tony as hard as Steve knew it would. With his health in decline, they’d moved Jarvis to a luxury care facility months ago, but eventually there was nothing they could do but be there while the elderly butler joined his wife in death. After the funeral Tony was a mess, he clung to Steve as he cried and cried until his voice went. He walked around their Malibu home, unable to sleep for long or eat much until Steve eventually coaxed him into bites of food and naps. Then Steve pushed Tony to go through the boxes of stuff that had belonged to Jarvis, his personal possessions which had filled his suite at the care facility. The photo books brought both the most pain and the most healing. There were hundreds of pictures of Tony growing up, Jarvis always by his side. The later photos always included Steve, right by Tony’s side and those brought a special pang to Steve’s heart.
“Good old Stevie. Doesn’t give a damn as long as he gets to beat someone up and make a buck off it.”
“You got me a present?”
‘Safety. Every single time I ask her about her childhood she keeps bringing up safety.’ He thought.
While outside the dark outline of the park trees swayed with the wind, inside Steve held the much younger man securely in his arms. He focused on Tony’s relaxed features, the nose, the jawline, the broad cheekbones and thought about how much pain this same being had had to endure in the original universe. He thought about how much Tony must have hated himself for decades, all the while pasting on a showman’s smile and a salesman’s pitch to get the deal, to continue employing thousands of workers all around the world. Tony Stark spent decades gagged and bound by a sense of duty and manipulated by a man whose only interest had always been profit and profit alone.
Steve knew how to handle depressed Tony well enough. He was clingy and needy and quiet but skin to skin contact went the furthest. During their three days of complete solitude Steve stuck to a pattern, he dressed Tony in just boxers and took him out to lay down under a sun umbrella by the ocean waves. He’d settle Tony on top of his naked chest, press his ear to Steve’s heart and tell Tony stories about what New York was like when he was growing up.
From this close, Tony could actually SEE the moment Steve-the-tactician kicked in. He bulldozed the frantic High Commander through and suddenly order reigned in Steve’s face.
Steve did stop then. He relinquished his grip on the guy’s blonde hair, releasing his head to gravity until it hit the pavement with a hard ‘thunk.’ He had the presence of mind then to look around for any spectators that might have gathered, perhaps a few of the guy’s buddies, but much to his disappointment there was no one. He’d run out of guys to beat up this side of Texas.
Steve had fantasized about this moment for a long time, he’d thought about all the different ways Tony could react, how his eyes would look, how his mouth might curl. But much to his surprise and infinite pleasure, Tony’s eyes widened just a bit and his mouth formed the syllables of his name so softly that Steve almost missed it altogether.
“For the thousandth time, Yes! It’ll be good for us, a new start in a new place away from pollution, traffic and New Yorkers.”
“You could’ve gotten hurt worse than you...”
Tony knew where this was going, it was something he used to tell Steve every morning once upon that previously mentioned time.
Steve watched, amused as her eyes filled with panic. Eliza Copper was a Regime-raised child, she’d served the Army of the High Commander like a perfect soldier since she was thirteen years old. But above her civic duty and her loyalty to him, she was a follower of the Savior Iron Man first and foremost. Therefore, the only real thing Eliza Copper was afraid of was of disappointing Tony Stark.
“I have half a dozen pre-teen children running around here all the time, you think I’m stupid enough to leave alcohol out for them to get curious about?”
“Yes and then I carried you to bed and we feel asleep”
“Tell Fury I want to talk to him.”
‘What is obsession? Is it like infatuation? Does it work the same way?’ Tony had never been a philosophical person by nature, he liked tangible facts, numbers, secrets but during the past week the word kept making its way through his mind. It got in there by accident, no, it got in there because of a couple of teenagers.
“Tony?”
Tony shakes the half empty milk carton in his hand. There’s enough left for a smoothie and coffee but there won’t be any left for tomorrow.
He hit the break and turned the bike to allow the drag of the soil to slow him down. It took a while, the weight of the bike being what it was but he managed to come to a full stop right below the ad bearing the face of Tony Stark. The ad was for the newest Stark Industries phone and it starred Tony, looking confidently into the horizon, a sleek thin glass phone in his hand. He looked the very picture of self-confidence and success which was probably the reason why they chose to go with him instead of some model but it was his eyes that made Steve remember.
The call comes from the front of the house, where they all seem to have clustered together in an effort to give the two some space.
Steve gave the man the address he was going to, got an odd look for it.
He’s busy figuring out the logistics for making ten sandwiches the quickest way possible, when he sees that Ian, Shari and Reamus are making faces at whoever is at the door through the glass. Tony chuckles at the scene, enjoying the thought that whoever is at the door probably thinks that whoever owns the house has way too many children.
“My divorce was just finalized.”
Mr. Rogers runs a tight ship. He likes to know everything going on behind the scenes, likes to know his staff… have a good sense of what they do, when they do it and how they do it. He’s not an easy boss, even he’ll admit to that, but he’s also not an unreasonable person.
Tony made sure to keep his tone light, to draw out the joke and maintain a smile. Slowly, he reached out, his hand cupping Steve’s left lower jaw while his thumb stroke the soft skin underneath. Tony had lost a good inch in height over the years, another casualty of age. But there was one good thing about it; it made him all the easier to curl into Steve.
He sounded cocky and mischievous but it frayed on the sides. Steve finished shaving, giving Tony time to wash his teeth. They were still squeezing into Tony’s old room and ensuite in the old manor, they’d meant to find a condo closer to the city but they’d never had the time. Looking at the brand new worry lines around Tony’s eyes Steve knew they needed to start thinking about a place to live that wasn’t New York. They needed to find a place where Tony could relax.
“Mary from HR?”
Where Commander was quick, efficient and ruthless, Iron Man was strategy, speed and numbers. They made an unmatchable team, so much so that Cap soon enough stopped trying to stick Falcon in with them on the air. Both worked together seamlessly, watched each other’s backs and when Iron Man called out for an amended plan, Commander executed without argument. This last part drove Cap nuts.
They shake on it. Old-style. Deep inside Steve has always liked Johann, liked his no bullshit approach to the business and liked that he keeps his ass out of trouble.
“Thank you Lieutenant for your service and sacrifice.”
“That’s ok, just bring it to the sink and I’ll assess the damage!”
“I could definitely get used to this.”
In just over a year he’s see Tony again.
Tony continued perfecting the armour under Steve’s supervising gaze.
“Oh I know… I betrayed you, crushed you, scarred you. I made you weary of trusting anyone with your heart. I know how much I hurt you Tony, that’s why I chose to do this. I want to make it up to you.”
“Yes… He was. Now take me to the machine.”
The conviction in Tony’s voice is as true as steel, a principle from which Tony has built his whole life around.
“How’re our supplies looking?”
With a swipe of his hand the holograms were gone, leaving behind only a sleek phone. Steve stepped around the couch and held out steady hands. Tony shared a grateful glance for the assist, his knees were not what they once were and this particular couch took a trick to get out of. But just as soon as Tony was pulled into a standing position, he sneaked two arms around Steve’s slim, built waist and smiled innocently up at his husband.
Steve sees the moment Tony finally spots him in the kitchen. He gets to witness the delight that fills his lover’s face and the smile that breaks through. He also sees the exact moment Tony remembers Steve’s injuries.
“Want a drink?”
“Yep, resident boy-genius, pain-in-the-ass, at your service”
“Yes! Sorry about that your highness!”
“You look beautiful darling. Now tell me, what have you been up to?”
“Can I eat that?” Arlen asks, pointing at the finished sandwich that is simply sitting on the counter.
Had Steve Rogers, eventually, and over a long period of time, come to be obsessed with the dead Tony Stark? Steve himself once confessed that he hadn’t known he was in love with his dimension Tony until many years had passed. So, that obviously had to prove that Steve was not OBSESSED with him. He was over-protective, yes, but he was honestly quite the pushover. Steve was kind, and sweet, and always put Tony’s needs before his own, he always listened to both sides of an argument and they rarely disagreed with each other. Even Natasha agreed that they had a disgustingly wonderful marriage, and Laura Barton once told her husband “See Clint, that’s exactly how you end a difference in opinion.”
“Yeah, I’ve been bouncing it back and forth with Peter. I think it’s ready for Shuri to take a look.”
“That, is up to Tony.” And with that Steve Stark marched right out of the gym, his steps so heavy Cap could feel the ground beneath him shaking.
‘Probably since I burned their precious leash.’ Steve thought.
“Steve I can’t live my life in fear or what might happen. This can help a lot of people, we can supply the troops with enough units to give out in the villages, this can bring change and hope to those people, I’m not just going to say ‘thanks for the invite but no thanks.’ Plus SI hasn’t made weapons since the 90’s why would they try to kidnap an ex-arms inventor?”
His Tony never complains. Not about being cold, not about sex, he’s not even picky about food. His Tony is meticulously organized and so brilliant he puts everyone else to shame. It took Steve a while to get his head around Tony’s job, but now that he understands it… it fascinates him. As an Environmental Engineer, Tony gets to use his incredible mind to get around the laws of physics and even nature itself.
“So much time wasted…” Steve mused. Then in a completely 180, “Let’s get you to the bathroom ok? Then after we can have breakfast.”
Tony had a black eye when Steve first met him. He’d been wearing sunglasses indoors to cover it, but Steve made him take them off. That same day Steve beat up Tony’s ex-boyfriend within an inch of his life. The bastard ended up in the ICU, too afraid to tell anyone what had actually happened. A week later, Tony moved in with Steve. They’ve been together ever since.
He looked up, tried to see Steve’s face.
Seeing Bucky again was unpleasant enough, hearing his voice more so. Wanting to keep this short Steve was curt with the explanations “I’m the Steve Rogers from an alternate dimension.” He simply said and waited for the cascade of questions that came with that. He answered them quickly and then when it looked like the other Steve might pass out, he excused himself.
He would never have to be alone, as long as Steve was by his side.
“Nope, no chance in hell Bruce. You know Jane didn’t want him in the picture and Jane’s scary lawyer mom has every intention of enforcing that.”
“Please eat something, you will feel better after you do”
Steve agreed to the whole plan, was looking forward to it being just the two of them again without Avengers meetings and debriefs and strategy meetings. Most of all, he was looking forward to not having to see Cap and Bucky’s faces on a regular basis.
“I wasn’t like I am now… I did some really nasty things to you. I…”
“Vivi why are we at Stephens?”
“What just happened?” Asks Siggy, probably not even realizing she’s spoken.
Steve took in air.
“Yes, once you’re in we’ll collapse the connector and it’ll be its own mirror universe to our own… except much younger.”
The thought of it brought a smile to her face, her memories going back to the time she accidentally caused a massive power-failure at the tower and all Tony did was laugh when she confessed to it. Her Savior was indeed the nicest, gentlest, most forgiving person in the world and in his grace, he could come to forgive her impertinence.
“Daddy? Are you ok?”
“Maybe we could text?”
Stephen’s voice sounds sincere but it’s the warmth of his arms around him that causes tears to sting Tony’s eyes.
Steve was on his feet in seconds and made a show of stretching leisurely before going around the help Tony up. Even clad in a long sleeved shirt and sweatpants Steve was gorgeous. He was well built with such considerable muscle definition that it left Tony wondering how Steve managed to maintain that physique when he spent his days by Tony’s side reading. ‘He must work out when I’m sleeping’ he concluded.
He knew her too well.
He is trying… really he is, but try as he might he just can’t find the silver lining of this particular disaster. What happiness could possibly be derived from the knowledge that the perfect little girl in his arms is now motherless? What relief could be drawn, when his boyfriend of ten years, the love of his life really, is probably, currently, right at this moment in the arms of ‘Peggy’ his new fucking  fiancé?
“What?”
After all these years Tony knew where it was best not to go, after all, he trusted Steve more he trusted himself.
Tony was dead.
It didn’t bother Steve. He tried to answer as truthfully as possible because the questions about Tony were always the easiest to answer. He didn’t mind telling Tony it hadn’t hit him until many years after losing him, didn’t mind talking about how reluctant he’d been to believe it could have been love.
Steve whispered and as Tony pulled back to follow the instruction Steve lifted him into his arms by taking a hold of the younger man’s thighs. Tony’s legs automatically wrapped around his hips and the position kept the towel safely between them as they left the bathroom. Steve should have taken Tony to his room, but he didn’t. Instead, Steve took Tony back to Steve’s room where he removed the towel and tucked him into bed. He then climbed under the covers and arranged Tony so his head was pillowed against Steve’s left pectoral while his naked body was pressed against Steve’s left side.
It occurred to Steve that Tony might have been asking about his own death, but Steve found no point is talking about that. After all, they’d duplicated Earth but not the whole of the universe. There was yet to be anything to suggest that Thanos would attack in 2018, nor proof of a duplicate Asgard or Xandar. Neither Valeria Richards, nor Vision nor Alaska had been able to provide him with clear answers regarding the extent of the dimensional duplication but it didn’t matter. It wasn’t the kind of thing one could miss.
“We don’t mean to intrude, we can grab something to eat on our way back.” Suggests Bruce but Tony is quick to dismiss it.
“No Steve. Would you LIKE me with a beard?”
“I’m itching for a fight. Got anything on the books for tonight?”
Tony begrudgingly agreed, but only after Steve reassured him that he wasn’t going anywhere. He would still go to board meetings and factory visits and creative meetings. He would still help with some of the paperwork and push food into Tony by any means necessary. So the hunt began.
Day zero, as Steve referred to it in his head, started out as usual for Tony. He got up when his phone alarm rang, he showered, dressed and headed down to SI for a full day of work. Pepper was working him to the bone before his Sabbatical, it’d taken him a while to decide but eventually his friends’ constant nagging won and Tony decided to take a one year break to invent crazy things without having to worry about the company. Tony went about his normal business at work, he attended meetings and touched base with Peter.
“I can make it myself, you’re in the middle of work.”
Pepper was different, more relaxed, less anxious about the company. Was that because she didn’t have to worry about Tony? Steve wondered.
Hours later, Tony awoke in convoluted layers. His head throbbed, his mouth felt dry, he was warm…and finally, he was naked. With that last bit of knowledge, Tony forced his eyes to open and take in his surroundings. To his utter shock the first thing he saw was Steve’s sleeping face.
Steve could just picture it now, him and Tony living together, eating together, watching movies on the couch… just like old times. Just like at the beginning before things went so wrong. Maybe he could even convince Tony that they could be… more.
The following month a yearly tradition known as the Avengers Gala followed. It was actually an annual reunion that nowadays looked more a retirement home party than the boisterous drinking gatherings they used to be. Tony (with just a cane for support) walked in, back straight and proud to greet the newer Avengers and speak warmly with the older ones he already knew. The founders, as they were called, were highly regarded in the hero hierarchy and the newer recruits glimpsed shyly at Iron Man and Commander with respectful awe.
“I can sorta think, so yeah”
This time was no exception. He awoke, gasping like a dying fish with the half-bunt face of a dead man in his vision. He took in the ceiling above him, white and smooth until he felt an arm flop carelessly across his chest. He felt Tony’s warm body draping closer, felt Tony’s unburnt face press against his neck. Felt the weight of his body enveloping Steve’s and the rhythm of his breaths luring the Commander’s back to normal. Tony wasn’t awake, this he knew without even checking. After so many decades of this, Tony’s subconscious simply knew what to do when Steve was in distress.
“Apologize to your parents for me.” He tells the kids as they’re walking to the doorway. They look at him, curiously and he wants to hit himself. Apologize for what? They have been spending almost everyday at his house for weeks now. It’s gotten to the point where Shari, Ian and Reamus parents are taking turns bringing dinner as a thanks for free babysitting. Just yesterday he’d field calls from them apologizing for how much their respective children were coming over and he had assured them that it was perfectly fine.
“Yes my liege?”
“I’m Loki Odinson, Thor’s brother, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
That image struck a chord with Steve, suddenly he could clearly envision himself in the living room couch with Tony’s head on his lap as they watched the snow covered window. The simple domesticity of the scene twisted his guts with a yearning so strong he could highly keep it at bay. Tony was offering him to begin their lives together in beautiful normality and he’d be a fool to say no.
“That’s good! Thanks for doing that. I know Steve wanted you to stay indoors as much as possible.”
Smiling like the predator he was, Steve reached for the fly of Tony’s dress pants.
The way her eyes hid from his scrutiny, so like a child afraid to get scolded, was all the truth he needed.
“That you’re still in love with me”
“So, guys. What’s new?”
Smiling, Steve buried his nose in the mass of silver that was now Tony’s hair and closed his eyes.
“Gag me with a fucking spoon… you’re serious aren’t you?”
Steve had never told Tony about Pepper, had never even mentioned the name and yet he’d been right there when Tony decided her name was going to be Pepper and refused to refer to her as anything but that.
“Stay still… there’s blood in your hair.” Tony’s hands are firm against his scalp. He works in a thick lather, scrubbing the hair with a little more force than is strictly necessary.
Yet the more he looked the more he found. His trip to Staten Island with the wonder twins was fun. They had a good professional relationship and much to his surprise, he found that both Bucky and Cap enjoyed Tony’s banter and answered him back. Overall they had a good time, a fun day even. Steve Rogers, without the heavy gaze of Steve Stark nearby was actually quite the troll. Tony expected to get a couple of calls from Steve throughout the day, a few texts maybe but… Steve never called him.
This was the High Commander speaking, his voice cold, demanding… desperate. This was Tony’s very own beautiful monster.
‘All up to me,’ Tony thought. If that was true then there was hope still, he could lure Steve into a false sense of trust and comfort, make him lower his guard enough to leave an opening for Tony to escape. He just had to wait it out.
‘Connections’ is actually Bucky Barnes. Steve knows that it’s the mention of his high-ranking NYPD Detective best friend which relaxes Tony. One word from Steve and Bucky would make a good dent in the street fighting gambling community.
“I love you too you grouch.”
The sounds of a happy, squealing baby cut through the chatter of the room. Tony rushed forward, the biggest smile on his face. There, strapped to Pepper’s chest was baby with dark curls, mocha skin and big bright blue eyes bouncing in her carrier. She released another squeal at the sight of her favourite uncle while her fat digits beckoned him over.
Had Tony always been this easy to get along with? Had he always been this funny? This interesting? Steve found himself hanging on the boy’s every word, laughing constantly at his jokes and comments. There was no need here for Steve to prove himself, no need for him to remember old ideals, old beliefs, old stupidity. All Steve had to do was listen to Tony, enjoy his company and be a version of his current cynical self.
“So Stephen should be here any minute?”
“Then you’re not looking at it right.”
“Did Steve request a tap on my phone?”
“We blew up a beaker together!” She tells him, a mad gleam in her eyes that makes Tony remember he has to call and confirm the fire insurance clause of his home policy.
“No!”
Steve leaned in, pressed his lips against Tony’s temple, tickling his cheek with Steve’s light brown beard. Bruce Banner had stayed a faithful friend to Tony until the very end. Steve knew he could trust him to do so again.
“Well then, as long as he makes you happy.”
They were so precious, these little tears, because they belonged to a man who wanted to become a man of Iron. A man who would succeed in doing so.
“Because it’s not as bad as it looks! Putting weight on it isn’t bothering me that much and as long as I avoid putting pressure on my side, I’m fine!”
“Thank you for everything, my friend.”
