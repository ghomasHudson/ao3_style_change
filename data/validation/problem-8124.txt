way, thank god. No, she recognises him as Tony Stark, here to visit Former SHIELD Director Margaret Carter in her high security, former-agents-only retirement home.
to say," Bruce says after a moment, his tone very pointed. "Is that we're very sorry we didn't realise you were kidnapped rather than just misplaced your cell. Do you need anything looking at?"
The asset doesn't know how he is managing it. One day Captain America will be on every news broadcast fighting giant spiders in Peru with the rest of the Avengers, and the next he'll be turning up in the town the asset left three days previously. He and the one with the wings will be obliterating one of the masters' bases in Los Angeles in the morning, then in the afternoon they'll be six hundred miles away in the city the asset is fleeing.
Bruce moves a few boxes closer to Tony, while the rest of Clint emerges from the refrigerator, holding a couple of beers.
"Okay," he says, shuffling so far forwards he's barely balancing on his chair anymore, then leaning in just for good measure, not that he's asking for or going to offer anything confidential. "There's maybe something I wanted to talk to you about."
But Tony's already gone.
"Would you like me to alert Captain Rogers?"
probably isn't the done thing. Yeah, Tony thinks she's with it enough that she'll know who he's talking about and maybe be able to answer his questions, but he doesn't want her to think he's asking like he doesn't expect her to remember. Peggy has always been an absolute powerhouse, and even if she doesn't let on Tony knows it'll hurt her if she thinks he thinks any less of her.
Steve looks down at his handful of drawings, wondering if there's anything in there he can spin well enough that Sam puts away his worried face, and that's when he sees something small and red next to monkey-Steve's head. He turns to the next piece of paper, and there's another red squiggle, and again on the third; flicking quickly through them, he sees that every drawing he pauses on has that same red shape.
Bruce sits down next to him, his expression the spitting image of Tony's high school principal whenever Tony accidentally managed to piss him off. "This isn't some gossip session, Tony," Bruce tells him firmly. "You're clearly miserable as hell, and since there's no chance you'll speak to an actual therapist, I figured you'd prefer talking to someone who knows who you're upset over. But if you'd rather I got Pepper, I can do that."
Yeah, Tony’s a hypocrite. What of it?
Reliable intel, Maria thinks, is a lot harder to come by now that she's working for Stark rather than SHIELD. For one thing, her team is a lot smaller; Pepper may have spearheaded the recruitment of as many trustworthy former-SHIELD personnel as possible, but after discovering half your coworkers are part of an evil secret club, trust isn't particularly easy to come by. For another, although the hardware and software they're working with is beyond state of the art, they no longer have quasi-legal access to every camera on the planet as and when they require it (or, if they do, Stark has neglected to share that little piece of hacking with her), which negates much of the advantage provided by reduced processing times.
“Oh,” Tony answers, and the way he squeezes Steve’s hand is every bit as involuntary as his smile was. “Oh. Dinner?”
He fills a plate from the breakfast buffet, piled high enough that he gets dirty looks from more than one member of staff, and apathetically prepares himself tea in the largest mug he can find (Peggy used to extol the virtues of a good cup of tea, and since caffeine does nothing for him Steve figures he might as well give it a try) before scanning the room for wherever Sam's sat.
“Oh,” Tony says, for what has to be about the fiftieth time this conversation. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
, rather than just honeymoon, Thor.”
"This is about the situation in Peru, right, Maria?" Banner asks, presumably looking at the monitors behind Maria, which are
“Way Steve spins it, you weren’t you at the time,” he tells the gears, which is still a whole lot ballsier than Barnes was expecting from a man who can’t enter a fight unless he’s wearing dangerously colourful armour.
He's back to looking at Tony again, and Tony doesn't know what his expression is doing – or even really how he's feeling, other that
Tony makes a concentrated effort not to stare at him, instead opting to pour himself a coffee, then another for Thor, since he’ll be there any minute, and a third for Barnes, who’ll either drink it or won’t but there’s no point offering first because, based on what Tony’s seen of his interactions with the others, he’s unlikely to give an answer either way.
So, no, Steve isn’t about to come looking for Tony any time soon, and there’s absolutely no point in hanging around thinking he might. Tony’s going to his shop, and he’s staying there until JARVIS starts calling for reinforcements to get him to leave.
“Captain Rogers,” he says; Steve already realises it’s not going to be anything good, because the words aren’t preceded by
A moment of silence follows Bruce's mildly alarming (and, Tony thinks, most likely accurate) statement, before Clint says, "Really hoping that's a
Tony isn't entirely sure what to say to that, really. If he was a mature, well-adjusted person, he'd probably argue that he can't do that, that keeping information from Steve would be absolutely unfair and wrong and… something else, and the fact that Tony can't think of anything else is proof that people are right when they've never, ever called him mature and well-adjusted.
,” Stark interrupts, hands at his sides and empty for once, clenching into fists over and over again. “I read your goddamn file, and not just the shitty translation that Natasha gave Steve. The things they did to you make Guantanamo look like a preschool version of the fucking Stanford Prison Experiment. They spent years figuring out every single way there is to hurt a person, and when you still wouldn’t do what they wanted you to they built a machine that would take you out and leave them a nice, blank template to work with, so don't even think that-”
, the asset thinks at himself. He just needs to ask.
, he’s already tried once to get the ball rolling. It’s Steve’s turn now.
approach to people more suited to it. In this case, however… “I thought I’d done a better job with that, though.”
That, Bruce thinks, is an interesting way of putting it. Again, there's a possibility he's over-thinking this, but JARVIS specifically said he can't give
"Tony's in the shop, right, JARVIS?" he asks, swaying his way back inside and summoning the elevator. "Any chance you'll let me in so I can apologise?"
"Not even a little bit," she answers, laughing. "There is no doubt in my mind that I'd have been out on my arse in a flash if I'd taken him up on the offer."
He pauses, takes a sip from his wine, and Tony just waits, his brain racing, trying for hope again however much he wants it to hold on, wait for Steve to be done talking.
Sam, saint that he is, puts Steve out of his misery. "Didn't manage a whole load of talking, did you?" He's grinning, looking far too pleased at this news, at least until he remembers how this conversation started. "I'm getting the impression you don't think that's a good thing. What, not as good as you remember?"
"Well, that's… something, I suppose," Pepper manages, thinking she perhaps might be a little more pleased with the end of Tony's reclusivity if it didn't also involve him disappearing who knows where at a very inopportune moment.
“Steve’s not here,” he says, effectively completing the mirror of their last conversation.
BFF I really, really need you to step up and give Captain America the shovel talk, okay?”
He follows willingly when Natasha suggests they have breakfast with the team, as does Bucky, though he does seem moderately baffled by what’s happening.
"If anything, I suspect I'm under-exaggerating," Banner answers. "Maria?"
"Would you like me to ask Ca-"
The mood Steve seems to be in, it’s probably best not to sneak up on him, so Tony collects a clean towel and a chilled bottle of water before sidling his way around the room, edging into Steve’s field of vision rather than approaching him from behind.
"Because…?"
Barnes picks up the beer, a determined flick enough to remove the top. He’s not entirely sure he wants to drink, but he understands that it would be rude to refuse.
Steve should be sleeping, resting, making sure he’s in the best possible state he can be, so that he can be as calm and rational as Bucky needs him to be. He needs to be with it enough not to crowd Bucky the second he sees him, has to be able to read Bucky well enough that he doesn’t make things worse for him.
The timing is so appropriate that Tony wouldn't believe it if he wasn't living it, but he's barely twenty miles out of DC when JARVIS cuts through his music to announce that he has a phone call, sounding resigned enough that Tony doesn't need to be told who's calling.
"I really thought we'd got the stretch factor right this time," Tony says. "Sorry, Bruce."
Sam quirks an eyebrow at Steve, but since Steve has no idea why Bucky wants him on their floor or why JARVIS seems to want Sam not to be there, he can only shrug in response.
The firm voice has clearly done something, because Tony doesn't carry on arguing that he shouldn't be allowed to have emotions, but he's frowning down at his lap like he wants to, and that's not really a whole lot better.
At least JARVIS is too good a person to say
"Fine," Tony says, shooting a camera his most unimpressed look. "I'll play nice long enough to eat, but those bottles better be exactly where I left them when I get back, you hear me?"
“No,” Barnes answers, after the customary delay. “Thank you.”
“Ms Potts is currently on the phone with Sir,” JARVIS replies. “I have explained to her that he has retreated to his office and is refusing to leave, and I am reasonably certain that she will succeed in convincing him to do so.”
"I did wonder," he says, attempting to prompt Steve into something resembling a healthy way of dealing with his feelings. "The way you talked about him seemed a little more than just friendly."
"Don't," Tony interrupts, and it hurts, the way he's looking at him. The combination of denial and comprehension, that he understands but doesn't believe, and Steve wishes his stupid moral compass didn't point due north all the time, that he could have accepted what Tony was offering rather than doing this to him.
"Yes, of course I remember that," Peggy snaps, scowling at him as she yanks her hand away from his. "I'm not a bloody idiot."
“Is he okay?” Steve asks immediately, filled with the same concern-bordering-on-panic he feels whenever JARVIS feels the need to talk to him about Bucky. He’s heading for the elevator without a moment’s hesitation, Sam following behind him, his plan to return to Tony’s floor and see if he can persuade him to get out of bed and into a shared shower now completely abandoned.
Bruce is quiet,
“You told me to drink this first,” Steve says, holding up the mug of barely warm coffee. He’s stalling, and he’s not being remotely subtle about it, but he’s only just got Bucky back and… And he’s been scared, if he’s being honest, that coming out would change the way Bucky thinks of him, that the trust he’s so carefully been cultivating would be shattered, that the friendship he’s trying to rebuild would be irreparably damaged.
But Steve just smiles at the pair of them, nothing but happiness on his face, and asks Natalia if she wants to stay for breakfast.
Steve’s breath catches, holding Tony closer, tighter, and Tony kisses him there a second time, far less subtle. The third kiss is obvious, undeniable, as is the soft gasp Steve lets out as Tony’s mouth drags over his skin, and the low moan that follows it when Tony allows his teeth to graze over his pulse point.
"Certainly, Sir," JARVIS answers swiftly. "May I ask what these words will be about?"
He pulls up the Winter Soldier murder video again.
Clint holds his gaze a moment, then nods once, sharply. “Okay,” he says, no longer serious. “Unsolicited advice over and done with. If you ever want to talk, or to sit and absolutely not talk, JARVIS’ll know where to find me, and until then I’ll leave it at that, unless there’s anything you want to ask.”
"And grab me another coffee, too!" Sam calls after him.
Wilson looks at him, mouth slightly open, then at Steve, then back to Tony again. "That's a joke," he says uncertainly. "He is joking, right?"
JARVIS sulks a moment, either looking for a way he can get away with misinterpreting Tony's unquibbleable instruction or making sure Tony knows how unhappy he is with the situation. "Crystal clear, Sir," he replies, sounding positively mechanical in a way Tony didn't even know he was capable of. Then, just to emphasise the fact that he's apparently just as unhappy with Tony as Tony is with him, JARVIS turns on Tony's
“After last time,” Steve very definitely
"Morning," he says, far too tired given how long he slept for.
"Eh," Tony answers, holding his left hand out, palm facing downwards. "Water," he says, then sticks his right hand out a few inches above. "Bridge. I, maybe, you know, wasn't really thinking about who I was talking to, but, uh, hey, I've been working on some arrow designs, if you want to take a look at them, or I can just send them up to your floor when they're done or whatever, it's no bi-"
Given who's talking, Steve decides to it’s safest to ignore the
"Sam," he corrects absently, dragging his hands down his face in an attempt to get a little closer to awake. It takes a moment, a stretch and shoulder roll that has his spine clicking, and then, "Holy shit. The house is talking to me, Merry," because under the wings and the chill Sam is actually a gigantic dork.
"Oh, buddy, you're going to love that one," Tony starts, launching into his spiel again, borderline manic. Still, talking and working is better than drinking, and Clint doesn't much mind listening anyway. He wonders idly if Tony's aware that all the new designs he's talking about are non-lethal, or at least have non-lethal applications; it might be intentional, part of Tony's apology routine, some sort of unspoken
JARVIS doesn’t answer, clearly hesitating, and Steve realises he’s over-stepped. “Sorry,” he says, looking down; JARVIS might be privy to just about everything that happens in the Tower, particularly when it comes to Tony, but he has a strict personal code when it comes to sharing anything, and Steve should know better than to ask anything that might seem like he’s prying into that. “I shouldn’t have asked that. I don’t expect you to tell me anything he’s said or you’ve overheard.”
Bruce leaves him to enjoy what seems to be footage of a car wreck in peace.
"Little bit," Clint answers lightly, frowning down at his right ankle, which started twinging after the adrenaline of his escape/rescue wore off and only twinged more the further he walked. "Don't worry about it. What're you looking at?"
It's maybe ten minutes later when Tony interrupts his own slightly too technical explanation with, "I am, though. Sorry, I mean."
“He is, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS replies, pausing for a moment before adding, “Do try not to hurt him, won’t you?”
“I told Sam, after we- after I told you about your parents,” says Steve, leaving it at that for long enough that Tony thinks that’s it, all Steve was trying to get at. He shifts back onto his side, settling more comfortably into Steve’s arms and allowing his eyes to drift closed, and he’s on the verge of dozing off when Steve speaks up again. “I don’t want Bucky to know, not yet. I don’t know how he’ll take it.”
As far as Tony’s aware, it’s the first time Barnes has been outside of Steve’s floor alone. After the first few weeks where Barnes never left made a move to leave Steve’s floor, he’s seemed happy (or at least willing) to follow Steve, Sam or Natasha when they’re out and about within the Tower, and according to JARVIS Barnes and Clint have been spending a fair amount of time together in the evenings, sometimes with Natasha as well, and Tony has no interest at all in interrupting their little Assassins Anonymous gatherings.
“Stop that,” he mutters, frowning down at his half empty plate. “Jesus, Steve.”
She shrugs and then, slowly enough to give him the chance to pull away if he wishes, she reaches out, resting her free hand, still so small and fragile, atop his. “It was a long time ago,” she says pragmatically, as though Barnes doesn’t know perfectly well that there are some pains time doesn’t touch.
Most days, putting on the armour is like… well, it's like putting on armour, a physical barrier between him and everything else in the world. In the armour, no one can touch him, no one can even get close. It's safe, comfortable and so reassuring, the best thing on Earth as far as Tony is concerned.
Stark’s mouth opens and closes, but no actual sound comes out, and Barnes mentally removes
“Tony Stark!” he booms, hauling Tony into the kind of hug that makes bears look puny. “It is good to see you, my friend.”
He's not at all expecting it when FHD holds out the gun in his left hand, tilting it in Clint's direction when he doesn't immediately take it.
"Time machine?" he suggests, only half in jest; if anyone can sort out time travel, it's him and Bruce. "Otherwise, no."
“Yeah,” Tony agrees, brushing a kiss to Steve’s lips, as light and teasing as the one he started out with. “Unless you will. Regret it, I mean. You’ve got Barnes back now, after all.”
“Anytime, Capslock,” Tony agrees, finally allowing Steve to hand him the plate, then steps out of the elevator. “Hey,” he adds, “I’ll probably be working late tonight, if you want to come down to the shop instead of the penthouse.”
,” Steve recites. “I know you think I’m stuck in the past, Tony, but I do know what
His time on the run had him liking his invisibility, finding it so much better than being noticed, but he's got used to people seeing him over the last couple of years; Bruce knows it's his issue, but between Steve not talking to him in the kitchen the day before yesterday (hell, Steve not even letting Bruce know he was back in town, which he's always gone out of his way to do in the past) and Tony glaring daggers at a paused holograph rather than looking at him, Bruce is perhaps feeling a little too sensitive.
Steve allows himself two minutes to sit there, wallowing in self-pity, before forcing himself to get out of bed and into the shower, which is every bit as ridiculously luxurious as the rest of the hotel. He would have enjoyed it, he thinks, if Tony was here with him. They could have made a solid (though probably unsuccessful) attempt to use up all the hot water, and had a whole lot of fun in the process.
“Shit!” he announces, staring at the broken bag on the floor for a second before turning desperate eyes on Tony. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
Besides, the one and only time Steve tried to suggest they made their relationship something people would know about, Tony bounced back the
He’s not sure the Avengers understand how keeping a prisoner is supposed to work.
It’s not really appropriate for him to do that anymore. Not after Steve not calling him, and definitely not now that Steve’s got his Bucky back.
Not that it's a relationship. Or was. Or might be. Whatever.
, Thor! There is no
, fanboying over Gaudí. He's just not calling when the others are around to overhear. That's all it is.
look and keeps working. After a decidedly sullen pause, JARVIS speaks again. "As you wish, Sir," he says, the lack of inflection making him sound more machine than person, a clear sign of how much he doesn't want to do what Tony's asked him to.
"I'll do my best," Bruce answers, sounding amused. "See you tomorrow, Pepper," he adds, through the rapidly closing hatch.
Well. He knew they existed, but it was very definitely in a hypothetical way. Sure, he was aware there are people out there who could blow a few thousand dollars on a hotel room for the night, the same way he was aware there are people who take drinks out of hotel minibars rather than using them to store their own stuff. Those people existed, but Sam was never going to meet one of them, let alone have one offer to pay his bills.
Meals with the team are always a bit of a free for all, but even when Sam joins them today continues to be a relatively sedate affair; yes, there’s not an abundance of pleases and thank yous, but at no point does anyone wind up with a fork embedded in their person, so Steve is willing to consider Bucky’s first meal with the team a success.
Or sobriety, maybe, but swapping the letter for the half empty decanter on the bar doesn't reduce the absence any, so clearly the problem isn't that he's starting to sober up.
“We showed him his room after we ate, and it didn’t seem like he wanted to leave,” Steve explains. “Sam thinks it’s important that he knows that’s his space, so we’re trying not to bother him when he’s in there. Plus, I wanted to thank you.” He pauses, looking conflicted, sort of leaning towards Tony like he wants to come closer but doesn’t know if he’s allowed. “Not that I have any idea how I’m supposed to thank you, Tony.”
, but you remember my old man, right?”
It occurs to him, then, that there is one thing he wants to know, and hasn’t wanted to ask Steve yet.
he doing it? "Can we talk about this, Tony?" he requests, not feeling remotely optimistic about the answer. "Tony!"
?” Tony asks, incredulous. “You’re the one who didn’t call.”
"Thanks!" Metal Man calls, and flies away.
He holds back that first instinct, though, which is maybe a good thing because his second thought is that, even as pissed off as he is, Tony doesn't want to be responsible for Steve coming to harm.
"Understood, Sir," he says, beginning the startup process.
“Wine?” Steve offers. “Or soda, I don’t know if you want to drink-drink, or…” He stops, swallowing audibly, and takes a deep breath before starting his question over again. “Would you like a drink, Tony?”
Clint knows he didn't handle things well. Tony is damn good at talking but not always so great at thinking first, and being both trashed and openly emotional just made that worse. The state he was in, it wouldn't have occurred to him that Clint might identify with someone who was potentially mind-controlled into committing murder. He wouldn't have thought about why straight up killing the guy without first checking he was actually to blame might hit a little close to home after some of the articles about Clint following the Chitauri invasion.
He wouldn't have been blindsided by it, at any rate.
It’s only now that Tony realises how used he’s gotten to Barnes’ usual demeanour. Yes, he’s quieter than anyone Tony’s ever met, acts like facial expressions are something that happens to other people, and has a tendency to skulk in corners, but Tony no longer finds it alarming. It’s just who he is, the same way Steve is stubborn, Bruce is measured, Natasha is sneaky, and Clint refuses to sit on any kind of furniture in anything close to a conventional way.
“You sure of that?”
"Oh," Sam manages. Then, "What did you think we were talking about?"
The other end of the phone is momentarily every bit as silent as Sam's judgement, and then there's a voice, clearly a recording, with a background of road traffic, staticky radio and people talking.
“I’ll take something down to Tony in a bit, if you could leave one of each,” Bruce answers, while Clint grabs for the doughnut box, quite clearly not done with them; it’s not a fight Sam is interested in having (
behaviour."
Clint jams his empty wallet and the remnants of his phone in his pocket and the pieces of his bow into his quiver, then makes for the doorway. Before he's halfway there, FHD steps in front of him, a gun in each hand.
Since Steve was expecting Tony to still be pissed at him, the tone isn't a surprise, but the fact that he doesn't know what he's being thanked for is. Then again, Tony does his best to avoid gratitude whenever possible, so maybe he's just feigning ignorance.
"The SHIELD info dump?" he prompts, and then, because firmly telling himself not to be insecure didn't actually work, adds, "I saw Steve a couple of days ago. Poor guy's having a tough week."
"I'm good," Tony answers, lifting his decanter of joy and lightness. "And, yep, still alive. Don't worry, I'm sure JARVIS would call you for help with disposing of my body if I croak under his watch."
“I’ll find a flight,” Natasha repeats. After all, she quite likes being Nathalie Rousseau, and a Quinjet landing in the street would definitely break her cover. “
“I promise,” Steve is saying when Tony arrives, and since there’s no one else in the room, it’s pretty clear who he’s talking to.
"Assuming Agent Romanoff is unavailable, certainly," JARVIS agrees.
“Steve,” he murmurs, rocking them slightly, and then, for lack of anything better, repeats himself. “I’ve got you.”
It's hard, when his parents' deaths are playing in his head in 4K ultra-HD with fucking surround sound and all that shit, for Tony to think of Steve as anything other than an obstacle standing between him and their murderer.
“Steve,” he says, pressing closer, his own hands roaming, probably more than they should, but Tony can’t help it. Or, no, he can, he’s one hundred percent in control of his actions, but he doesn’t want to. Steve’s here, with him instead of Barnes, and maybe he only came here to say thank you but he’s done that and he’s still here.
It's the first time since he found out Bucky's alive that Steve hasn't woken up and immediately leapt out of bed, ready to resume searching the second Sam woke up.
Tony decides now is definitely time to clear out, and for once, his workshop isn’t going to cut it. As soon as Barnes is done yelling at him, Steve’s going to come looking for Tony to pass the yelling  on, and the fact that it’s Thor’s fault that Barnes knows won’t make a lick of difference.
"Am I supposed to care about that?" he asks, when he's sure he'll be able to sound appropriately irritated by the suggestion.
"Pretty sure he'll say no," Tony answers, more of his mind on overtaking an old guy doing ten under the speed limit than on what he's saying or how Steve might hear it.
"My apologies, Captain Rogers," JARVIS answers calmly. Unfortunately, since he's always calm, this isn't overly reassuring, and it becomes even less so when he continues with, "I am contacting you at Sir's request, however."
And, God, he deserves a drink. He deserves the biggest drink he's ever had, deserves to be completely and utterly off his face. He should be as shit-faced as he was the day they put his parents in the ground, too drunk to stand up, to remember his own awful, bloodstained name.
, Tony thinks. Never let it be said that he doesn't know when he's been beaten (Pepper would disagree, but her version of events completely disregards the fact that Tony is still alive, and therefore the long list of people trying to kill him clearly haven't won).
JARVIS does the virtual (if entirely silent) equivalent of whistling innocently, and Tony narrows his eyes at the nearest camera. "Right?" he prompts angrily.
"It is now almost thirteen hours since Sir last ate," JARVIS says, which seems to Bruce to be both an entirely unrelated statement and implicit confirmation. "As I understand it, desserts are considered comforting in times of emotional distress – perhaps taking Sir a slice of cake would be the best solution to both problems?"
Still, with Sam on one side and he and JARVIS on the other, at least there's a slight chance of Tony and Steve figuring themselves out.
: Shit. Is anyone-
"You were-" Tony interrupts himself to take another drink, more or less draining his glass in the process, but that's okay. The bottle's on the table next to him, and it's no effort at all to pour himself a refill. "Where the hell did you get that impression?"
"It's five in the morning, Tony," Pepper snaps. "If waking me up half an hour before my alarm goes off is your petty revenge for needing you to be at this meeting later on, I am really not impressed."
"Any time, pal," Sam says, grimacing. "Jesus, Steve, I am not watching you eat that shit. Go get some jelly or something."
“I won’t regret it,” he says.
The goddamn fucking time difference.
“No,” Bucky interrupts, though he’s a little less emotional, now that he’s clearly got his point across. “You really didn’t, did you? Way to break a guy’s heart.”
Half an hour later, Tony’s comparing a 3D hologram representation of Howard’s blueprints-of-evil to the scans he had JARVIS make of Barnes’ arm. Even J can only do so much when most of the arm is covered by clothes Tony fully intends to have incinerated (assuming Barnes ever decides to part with them) but if he’s going to repair the piece of shit Barnes has now, he needs to know what he’s working with.
"Could have told me you'd already cleared the place," he says, relaxing slightly as he puts the safety back on. FHD shrugs, a lopsided, unnatural seeming gesture, and Clint looks back at the heap. "Are they dead?" he asks, and then, in case the dude thinks he's judging him, adds, "I mean, it doesn't much matter either way, but I'll want to call it in if they're going to wake up."
“Breathe Tony, breathe you are here, in avengers compound you are safe. It’s okay.”
There is something so fond in his voice, Tony thinks he is imagining it, remembering somebody else.
In this exact moment James Rhodes realised he was living his worst nightmare. All these years, all he had wanted was to keep Tony safe. He had taken a look at the too smart for his own good omega and had decided that he had to be there with him to prevent his smart mouth from getting his ass whopped because for all Tony knew he didn’t know how to keep his mouth shut.
“Do you have your phone with you?” asked Rhodey.
Tony put his elbows on the bar and his head between his arms, if he could concentrate he would almost hear anna softly humming the tunes to some Hungarian song while mixing chocolate chip in the cookie batter softly looking up to him giving him the most gentle smile and putting some chocolate chips in his mouth for being such a good boy.
“My time is up Tony, but you, you have a lot left to do , it wont be easy, wont be easy for a while, you wont might not even remember this but I know you and I know you will make it alright. I love you Anthony.”
"Fantastic," he answers, over the thud of his fists on what Sam can only assume is a thoroughly reinforced Stark-made material. "On top of the goddamn world, Sam."
“I’ll be right back,” he promises, waiting for Bucky to meet his gaze before leaving the kitchen.
"Suhdon tehme," is Tony's barely comprehensible response to that, followed shortly by something that probably isn't a snore. "Canbethamproan…"
okay.
“Beg pardon?” says Stark. “I get that you've spent some time out of commission lately, Frosty. Maybe you're a little foggy on the conversational niceties, but I'm a friendly guy – the philanthropy deal, you know – so I'm gonna give you some advice. If you're planning on asking for a favour, maybe don't start with a threat? Just a thought, you know.”
"Or not," says Arrow Man. "You carry on. Totally up to you."
"Oh," he says blandly, as though his body language hasn't given away the fact that he clearly cares more than he wants to let on.
jibes, because he yanks the box well out of reach and picks out the chocolatiest doughnut Sam has ever seen.
Natasha isn't around, though, didn't come back to the tower with Steve and Fly-Boy. She's off finding herself somewhere – setting up a new identity after blowing all her old ones, apparently, but Tony's familiar enough with identity crises to know that's what she's going through – and whilst Tony set them all up with shiny new StarkPhones after New York, he doesn't think she'll answer even if she kept it.
Rhodey opened and then closed his mouth he couldn’t understand what was wrong, hadn’t Tony informed Pepper that he had to help Steve, hadn’t he gone to help the alpha and his friend then how could he be hurt, wasn’t that the reason why he wasn’t here.
“Good”
In the moment Tony sees Howard standing there, he sees Ty standing there, he sees Sunset standing there, he sees Obadiah standing there and he wants to see everything ablaze.
“I think I was hurt, must be hurt pretty badly to be doing this.” said Tony.
When he catches Pepper looking at him he smiles, he always smiles. She tells him that it’s okay to grieve, that he is allowed to grieve. Tony is not very sure about the allowed part , it’s a funny word allowed, he thinks he has had his fill of allowed, as if he hasn’t had to carve his way, claw his way to what he wants, as if he hasn’t fought tooth and nail to achieve where he is today, as if he was ever “allowed” anything, he hasn’t been allowed anything, he wasn’t “allowed” any sort of emotion, wasn’t allowed to feel, wasn’t....wasn’t allowed anything since he was a kid, his grasp over emotions is very recent which he again feels slipping from between his fingers.
He is holding on for now, if he lets go now he will shatter, break and he fears that he will never be whole again.
“There’s nothing you can do anymore.
Tony entered the house and there was Steve standing amidst the sea of a thousand candles looking every bit of the word dashing.
Steve was wearing his blue shirt which made his eyes look wicked handsome, it was Tony’s favourite shirt of Steve and he always enjoyed peeling it off of his husband.
“Yeah swing by we’ll have pizza and then you can tell me all about your death star”
He was on his knees he couldn’t listen to anything,
He walked around and sat on the tool which he would so desperately try to climb when he was a child and would refuse help from anybody until he did it on his own .
“T…Tony please” Steve closes his eyes and balls his fist. Tony thinks Steve might draw blood from his palms if he closes his fist any tighter, Tony wants to stop him but he…he....he can’t.
“You need to leave Rogers”
The main difficulty was not getting back into America, the main difficulty was getting inside the heavily guarded compound.
There was a heavy weight in his head, it wasn’t letting him think. There was only one words swimming in his head pregnancy, he had hurt his mate, his unborn child. He was wrong, he had committed a crime, he was bad, bad so bad had hurt tony had hurt his kid, his unborn kid. He had hurt them, hurt tony , left him, left him in the cold, broken his reactor, oh my god he had hit tony, had physically hurt him, what if , what if he had hurt his kid, no no, no he shouldn’t have done this, this was bad, his mate was hurting his kid, no god his pup, their mother was hurt because of him, he had hurt his pup ,almost killed, no, steve wanted to vomit, he retched , he wanted , he wanted to …… he couldn’t but he wanted......
If pepper was running the show then that was the best he could hope for. He had heard about Tony being injured ,all of  Natasha’s little spies had just informed them that Tony was severely injured but the cause was unknown, not that it mattered to Steve because he knew the answer pretty up-close.
“Pepper! I just….I just want to see him, please let me see him” begged Steve
Tony loved the Jarvises more than his parents.
Tony pouts, but in this moment he feels a little bit relieved.
“It will be good for his to be in a familiar environment and I know the Med Bay of the Avengers compound is better equipped then the hospital so I feel it will be better for him.
“I won’t hurt him” after a beat he added “again”
Tony loved Steve with all his might and then some more, he was convinced that Steve was was the good and pure thing in his life that he wont be able taint or destroy, because the blonde had planted himself in tony's life like a flower growing thru the cracks in concrete and refused to leave. Iron man and Captain America's romance was a whirl wind, it was too fast and all too encompassing. All his life Tony had held himself responsible for something or the other and hated himself but he loved Steve so much, he loved him so much he forgot what hating himself felt like.Tony had served his heart and trust to Steve on a silver platter and at the end Steve had left a vibranium shield shaped dent in it.
Peter perked up on the screen.
Tony’s chest was heavily bandaged, it felt like there was a little skin left which was not covered in bandages. He had IV’s running from both his hand, he also had a nasal feeding tube. Steve felt like somebody had poured cold water all over his body and then refused him warm clothes.
Tony looked at Jarvis and he felt cold creep into his bone and he shivered he thinks he is cold but he could feel the sunlight fall on his face then why was he cold, why did his head feel heavy?
Comments and kudos please.
That felt like he had been slapped across his face.
Tony smiled as if he had years of pain, disappointment , agony, melancholy hidden behind it as if he even let it out once he would break, fearing he had reached a point where he couldn’t put himself back together.
What if I don’t want to hold on anymore? Asked Tony
“I think this time you have been hurt too deep and one time too many. I think instead of crying and screaming you have gone numb, numb from the pain, numb from the betrayal.” Said Jarvis
Natasha comes to visit him. She says her apology and he forgives her, he has never been good at holding grudges, has hated himself for it but at the end of the day he forgives her but doesn’t let her get close and then she leaves, she leaves and also leaves Rogers behind and he hopes that she would have taken him with herself.
He feels the burden of all these years wearing him down, he sees the cracks formed overtime, his faith, hope, optimism, love all broken.
Pepper has always been there, Pepper who had helped him put his pieces back after Afghanistan, after obie ,always there always helping Tony. He is damn lucky to have pepper in his life.
“But I will”
He turned around and came face to face with the one person he thought he would never meet again.
Colonel James Rupert Rhodes is a an air-force pilot in the U.S Military since he was fresh out of M.I.T and then he was also War Machine, so he was known for his poise, calmness and ability to retain his cognitive thinking during highly tense situations. but it was safe to say nothing in his life had prepared him for the what he was facing right now.
When Tony got up around at midnight and stared at ring and then his husband how was basking in the heat from the fireplace and had an ethereal post orgasm glow a few tears escaped from his eyes, he kissed the forehead of his husband and went back to sleep in his arms, warm and safe.
A very tender feeling rose from his gut and blossomed very slowly in his very fragile heart, it was so tender and so tiny and so overwhelming and it was so bitter sweet.
Jarvis would have fought anybody who said Tony wasn’t his son, maybe he wasn’t his biological son but he was not going to disrespect their relationship like that. Since the moment that little bundle was placed in his arms Tony has become his and Ana’s whole world.
He feels a chill settle in his bones, he wants nothing more than to be warm , he just wants to go somewhere warm somewhere safe, somewhere he can never be cold again.
“That is the one thing I have failed to do, telling you what to do always felt so wrong, you were always so smart, so thoughtful, so free as if not meant for this world yet so resound so grounded you felt everything in your soul, watching you carve your own path was always like watching somebody create art, so beautiful, so gorgeous that sometimes I felt as if I was not worthy of looking at it.” Said Jarvis
They suggest that he stay close to his mate, his alpha that after a time he is going to need his mate, want him, and Tony laughs in there face and thinks he can and he will do this alone.
He looked up at Jarvis, “What?…….
“How far along is he?” inquired Rhodey
Steve is a moron and sooner or later someone was going to find out and then they both were going to land in trouble so he needs to get him away from here, get him somewhere probably safe, whatever he doesn’t care.
Tony closes his eyes, tries to sleep rest because he feels tired, so tired but as soon as he closes his eyes his brain goes into overdrive and pictures start flowing in front of his eyes. His mother, his father , his mother gasping for her breath calling out to his father, her neck, Howard…Howard with his head and then there is Steve..Steve with his shield…sitting on top of tony, his shield coming down, hitting him..hitting his arc reactor, his face …his…
He knew pepper and him had mostly bonded over Tony but they had been together for so long that a beautiful friendship had bloomed between them as well.
Rhodey, his brother, his bestfriend was there looking furious and giving Pepper the stink eye, when he had asked about it the answer had hit him like a blow and he had to count backwards to get his breathing under control which again hurt like a bitch because of his lung, so all in all, everything was peachy.
These days have been a roller-coaster for him, and he know that the days that lay ahead of him are  going to be even more difficult but he is hell bent on overcoming it.
He ran his eyes thru the condo and there were candles everywhere, every surface, every nook and corner covered in candles along with stargazer’s lilies, Tony’s favorite flowers.
He has sudden bouts of anger, he remembers all the time Steve had held him whispered sweet nothings to him, promised him loved him while hiding all of it from Tony. Tony thinks he had been a fool to not see not see behind the curtain become so enamoured with the picture to forget to look behind to not have known. He feels so numb, so hurt and so tired he feels a gaping hole in his soul , he feels happiness sometimes slipping from his fingers. Sometimes he goes silent for hours and if it bother everybody nobody lets him know. He feels elated bout the baby and then he remembers about his father and everything he goes numb.
“Goddamit Steve, Steve listen to me. Steve you gotta breath, you can’t work yourself into a panic attack right now. Steve? Steve listen to me.
“What am I doing here Jar?” asked Tony.
Pepper shook hands with the doctor and then left.
“I am going to go.”  replied Steve
He was dragging his body and his mind was holding a court of its own where Steve had already been convicted of the most heinous crime possible, the crime of hurting the love of his life.
Was this how Tony had felt? Was this justice for doing what Steve did?
He doesn’t care that Steve waits for him, he doesn’t care Steve is outside his room, he doesn’t care that he always disappears when Tony goes out for his therapy or exercises or he is not there when doctors come to check up on him, doesn’t care that now he is obeying his wishes and that he is moping all around the compound, doesn’t care that he is making a lot of people ansty.
The grin turns into a bull blown smile on Rhodey’s face and he moves forward to hug Tony who is still lying on his bed.
Nat helped Steve get up, he splashed water across his face and she got him paper towels to wipe his face.
“Not my fault, you left me.” said Tony.
They give him his meds and ask him to relax for some time, take it easy. Rhodey is on the bed beside him and Pepper is has gone to attend an video conference. Happy is still on the couch with vision beside him. Vision has a solemn expression on his face and Tony thinks he knows which particular brand of guilt vision is carrying.
Tony laughed at the memory, he remembered telling Jarvis that with trial and error he would become the best version of himself,the best son. In all his naivety he had thought had if he could collect all the feedback from his father’s responses and attitude towards himself he could make a good enough report and then analyse all of his shortcomings and change himself accordingly.
By the time Bruce gets back just after sunset and there's still been no contact from Steve, Tony's starting to get the picture.
He says it like he thinks this is something Tony hasn't considered, which is just fucking stupid. Of course Tony's considered it – and, frankly, he doubts Clint is even capable of considering anything Tony hasn't – but the fact is, he's not buying it. If the Soldier could stop himself from killing Steve, he could have stopped himself from killing Howard or Maria or any of his other victims. And, okay, there was clearly an emotional connection with Steve, Tony's not denying that that helped, but it only cuts him so much slack.
Clint grew up around alcoholics, first his parents and then half the folks at the circus. He's seen all kinds: the people who start drinking to have a good time and wind up not being able to have a good time without it; the ones who drink to deal or not deal with shit in their pasts; the ones that seem to be doing absolutely fine right up until the moment they're suddenly not.
"Sam, Bucky and I were never together."
There are cameras everywhere (another thing that Steve thinks should have tipped off the transport employees that all is not well in their workplace), so they're not trying for a stealth approach. Tony and JARVIS can recover data from all but the most destroyed computer systems, so they're not concerned about Hydra agents getting away, and as large as the place is Steve isn't worried that there'll be any kind of resistance the Hulk can't handle.
"Yes," Steve answers, at about the same moment Tony says, "No."
"No," Pepper interrupts. "Tony, last week Robert Jones congratulated me on finally giving in to temptation and murdering you, and I'm not entirely sure he was joking."
. It takes maybe longer than it should for him to realise it's laughter, but then Tony hadn't really been anticipating anything other than a growl, possibly with the odd snarl or snap chucked in for good measure. For lack of any better options, Tony settles for slightly bemused staring.
“Right,” he says. “Okay.
“Dude, you totally saved my life,” the archer continues, thrusting his hand in the asset’s direction. “Clint, Clint Barton, it’s good to meet you for real.”
“Oh,” Steve says a third time, stepping forward until he’s as close as they were before, Tony’s thighs either side of his hips, Tony’s hands holding on to Steve’s. “That’s okay, then.”
"You've seen what happens to the unfortunate bastards who befriend me," Steve answers, unwrapping his hands. "Do you really think I know enough people for two of them to have the same name?"
Bruce responds to his
"Okay," Clint says, because standing around sulking about Natasha's absence isn't going to hurry her back, and he and FHD should probably get the hell out of here before the pricks who tied Clint up come back again. "Don't suppose you've seen a bow anywhere?"
"Tony," Bruce says, sounding stupidly kind (did he miss the part where Tony said his parents were basically saints compared to Bruce's or Clint's or even freaking Odin, for God's sake, he's not the one that needs kindness) and even more cautious. "Tony, you get that not hitting your kid isn't even the bare minimum of what it takes to be an acceptable parent, right?"
"I'll make it quick, then," Tony answers. "It's about the file you gave Steve."
, Steve thinks, feeling his blush deepening. "That's not… Tony snuck out while I was asleep."
Correction: he was holding a gun; before Tony can fire, the gun is scraping across the gravel on its way over to him, another three following in its wake.
He hesitates, so long that Tony fights off enough of his embarrassment that he can look up at him; Bruce looks uncertain, a little uneasy, but he continues once Tony's made eye contact. "But I do know a little about how it feels to have hurt people when you aren't in control of your own actions, and Clint knows even more about that."
“Yeah,” Steve agrees, fully dressed but looking thoroughly dishevelled. “I think so.”
It doesn't matter where the asset runs, whether it stops in town for a week or a night or an hour. Captain America knows it has been there, and he shows up soon after.
throat, watches as she struggles and gasps and
goes unspoken, and Tony reminds himself that it's not Peggy, just her illness making her short-tempered and downright mean, sometimes. Peggy loves him, even if she sometimes forgets that.
Tony inhales his coffee, splutters slightly, and tries (and most likely fails) to keep his glance in Barnes’ direction a surreptitious one. “Why would Steve object?”
It's not a tough fight, at least not when Steve compares it to the Chitauri, Schmidt, the Winter Soldier (not Bucky, the person Steve fought wasn't Bucky), or any of the other super/non-human foes Steve has come up against, but it's also not the easiest one either.
Tony hasn't finished his request before the pages are rearranging themselves in the air, spinning their way into a new order before stacking one atop another on the table in front of him.
“Right? At least someone around here cares about my well-being.” Bruce’s eye twitches, just a little bit, but apparently that’s enough for Clint to decide he better get off that particular train of thought. “So, anyway,” he continues, pausing to lick doughnut guts off his fingers. “I was up on the roof last night, like, contemplating the meaning of life and whatever, and guess who shows up?”
His lips are exactly as Steve remembers them, the gentle scratch of his facial hair, the way he teases and encourages and teases some more, only pausing when he absolutely has to in order to breathe, and even then it's only for as long as necessary and definitely not a second longer. His hands are everywhere, sliding under Steve's clothes and threading through his hair, and Steve is on fire, desperate for another kiss, another touch, another inch of Tony's skin bared for him to see and touch and taste.
Tony thinks about it, long enough to empty and refill his glass twice. His first instinct is to say yes, because Tony is a spiteful, selfish drunkard, and still fantastically pissed off at Steve for choosing his murderous blast from the past over him. He doesn't want to help Steve on his vendetta, even if it's a vendetta against neo-nazis whose wannabe Death Star was targeting Tony and Bruce and millions of other people. He doesn't want his non-offspring using an order from ages ago to justify doing something Tony
It doesn't matter to Tony, at least not in any good way.
silences, so neither one of them particularly bothers him; he has, after all, lost himself in his work on more than one occasion, so it'd be hypocritical of him to object to that. This, on the other hand, is Tony very deliberately not talking to him, and it feels an awful lot like he's back to being the loser with the bruises, thrift store clothes and taped up glasses, invisible to all the other kids unless they were looking for a punching bag or someone to cheat off.
“Captain Rogers and Sergeant Wilson departed thirty-seven minutes ago,” JARVIS answers. “Agents Barton and Romanov remain on their own floors, and Doctor Banner is currently in his lab. Sergeant Barnes is in the kitchen downstairs, and I believe Thor is also on his way there.”
They might not be best buds, him and Natasha, but JARVIS is the closest Tony's ever going to get to having a kid and he doesn't believe she'd take that from him.
Either way, Jim’s most likely still going to be listening to him when his alarm goes off in nowhere-near-enough-time-from-now, and the option where he explains is a whole lot more effort.
Steve might not be opposed to Tony ogling his ass (though, to be honest, he didn't think it was on the cards for tonight), but he elects not to display it anymore than necessary on this particular occasion. "Oh, I've missed you, Tony," he says, handing over one of the drinks as he settles himself at Tony's side. He tries to keep a reasonable distance between them, but it's a lot harder than the size of the bed might suggest (though it is, of course, possible that this has more to do with the fact that he doesn't much want to leave space between them).
, Tony thinks, aware that he could maybe do with some cooling off himself. It knocks a lot of the wind from his sails when Clint pauses in the doorway and says, "Sorry, Tony."
He's saved from having to respond to that (and, Jesus, how is he supposed to respond to that, the earnestness with which this almost stranger tells Tony about how Steve feels about him) by the reappearance of Steve, now down to his undershirt and uniform pants, and Bruce, draped in Steve's jacket and clinging slightly desperately to the remnants of his pants.
"My mom, Bruce. He killed my
It is not the first time that JARVIS has registered the presence of Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes [alternate forms of address include: Bucky; The Winter Soldier; 'that murdering asshole'] in New York City.
"Tony, I think they made him kill your parents."
If there are any lights on the roof, the voice hasn’t turned them on for him, but the ambient light of the city is more than enough for the asset to see by. He’s not up there to sit, so the asset bypasses the furniture, instead pacing a careful route around the edge of the rooftop, scoping it out for possible threats. There’s any number of acceptable hiding places, though none are occupied, and while there’s plenty of buildings with a clear line of sight at parts of the roof, there’s nowhere that would allow a potential assassin to cover all of it; although it clearly wasn’t designed by someone with any experience in assassinations, it’s also not as vulnerable to attacks other places the asset has been.
"Right," he says quickly. "I don't know about you lot, but I'm exhausted. Where are you guys staying?"
. The asset doesn’t like to be touched, but he also knows that refusing is rude, and while he’s spent a lot of time being unconcerned by other people thinking he’s rude, he thinks Steve would be unhappy about it.
"Home, J, and don't spare the horses," he says, propping himself up in a corner of the elevator before depositing the unopened bottles on the floor so that he can unstopper the decanter.
doesn't leave a whole lot up to interpretation," he mutters.
Bruce isn't saying anything.
Today, the asset surrenders.
“I’m sorry,” he says, presenting Tony with his breakfast offering.
"Uh-huh," Wilson says sceptically, which is about when Tony realises saying that sentence to a counsellor was maybe not his best idea ever. "Still avoiding dealing?"
“Steve calls me Bucky,” he answers, a few seconds too late.
Tony regrets this.
"Pretty sure it's Hamlet, actually."
-together. Just… fooling around, I guess."
, Tony thinks, not entirely unaffectionately, as he exits the elevator and heads into the team kitchen.
Thor looks confused, like he’s finally worked out that Tony isn’t enjoying this conversation topic but has yet to understand why. “Did I say something wrong?”
He still wants –
Clint and Bruce are in the kitchen when they get there, bickering over whose turn it is to cook and what they want to eat. Nat, being Nat, steamrollers straight past them, extracting two waffle makers from the first cupboard she opens (Steve’s going to pretend that’s not blatantly witchcraft of some sort), plugs them both in, and sets Clint to making batter and Bruce to chopping fruit.
"Seconded," Maria answers; in her opinion, any spider too big to fit down the plug hole merits a resolute
," Tony reiterates, on the off chance that the reason Clint is being so stupid is that he hasn't actually understood that fact. "The only reason I'd be finding him is to put him in the ground."
means.”
"Maybe don't fall asleep when Tony's around, though," Bruce advises, completely straight faced up until Steve laughs, at which point he smiles a small, proud smile.
The masters aren't a concern. The asset will not hesitate to slaughter all who believe they can own it, turning its decades of training back on those who trained it.
"Indeed, Doctor Banner," JARVIS replies.
Goddamnit. Tony had only wanted someone to cook him breakfast.
"Hey," Tony says, heading over to where Wilson is leaning against a wall, looking about four different kinds of exhausted. He makes a fairly lacklustre effort to straighten up as Tony approaches before appearing to think better of it, and Tony would be joining him if he thought the wall in question could take the weight of the suit. "Good fight. How were the wings? Better than the crap you had before, right?"
Barnes pauses again, then says, “As I can be. Howard wasn’t one of them.”
Steve has only just stepped through the door when JARVIS decides to bring his post-workout buzz to a very abrupt end.
“Yeah…” Steve agrees, because obviously Tony is right, and Bucky should feel he’s able to go where he wants, whether it’s to the rooftop at night, meals with the team, or anywhere else that occurs to him. But, equally obviously, Tony is missing the point, which is that he has already gone far above and beyond anything Steve could have asked of him, and Steve doesn’t want Bucky’s presence to be contingent on Tony’s absence.
There aren't words. There just aren't.
, he thinks at anything that might be listening, and then asks, "What's going on, Tony?"
“Yeah, let ‘em in,” he answers; the only person on the premises he has absolutely no desire to see is the Soldier, and since he showed no inclination at all to leave Steve’s floor when Tony left him there, he’s probably not likely to come visiting now. Similarly, the only person Tony particularly wants to see is the one person he’s trying very hard to resign himself to not seeing any time soon, so he doesn’t actually bother looking up.
Not that that makes it any less awkward, but Tony sticks it out.
"Come on," he says, and doesn't wait for Steve to argue.
Sometimes, when Tony's been watching the footage of his parents' deaths on a loop for hours – maybe even days – at a time, he forgets that Steve is his friend, his teammate, his former semi-regular casual hookup.
Tony looks him in the eye, reaching for Steve’s hand; Steve takes it, allowing Tony to pull him close again. “I definitely didn’t regret anything we did then, or any other time, and I very definitely won’t regret anything we do now.”
"The only person whose presence I detect is yourself, Doctor Banner."
“Barnes…” Stark says, not managing anything more than that, his face doing that thing that he's seen Steve and Sam and occasionally Clint do, sometimes even Natalia as well. Like they want to reach out, offer comfort, but they know there's no fucking comfort to be had and any attempt will most likely end up with them knifed and Barnes catatonic in a corner.
“I killed your parents,” Barnes reminds him, tone neutral, controlled; whatever his shrinks say about it being healthy to express his feelings, he's not going to have a goddamn incident in Tony Stark’s shit-tip of a workshop.
Barnes blinks at him, the bleak desperation sliding away into something cool and blank, terrifying but for the fact that Tony's been hiding behind a similar (though admittedly less murderous) mask for more years than he can remember.
looking forward to trying to wrestle it out of Steve later.
part of her question and get right to the part that isn’t a request. “Sure. You gonna tell me where they are, or do I have to guess?”
situation. First with the wings, which make the set he had before look like Icarus' wax-and-feathers model. He knows the originals weren't actually clunky or difficult to control, once he figured out how to steer and, you know, got used to the fact that he was freaking flying, but these are… They're insane, is what they are. He's flying by instinct, controls so smooth and so intuitive he barely has to think what he wants to do, wings more like an extension of himself than technology he has to put on and take off.
A hug, though. Friends hug.
And, as if that’s not enough for him to be worrying about, there’s his situation with Tony to consider, and the fact that Steve has no idea what their situation actually is. Right from the beginning, the two of them have been able to put aside their differences long enough to work together when the occasion calls for it, and he’s never doubted that Tony will have his back in a fight, but since he told Tony about Bucky Steve hasn’t had much hope that they could go back to being more than antagonistic, end-of-the-world allies.
“Goddamit Steve you look at me if you wanna talk to me” Tony demands, Steve is still not looking at him and Tony’s inside are boiling, he burns, he burns with white hot rage, , he wants to know, he needs to know, his desire to know shines bright like the sun on a clear day eclipsing all his other needs. He needs Steve to look at him, to tell him, answer him.
He knelt down in front of Steve and pulled him into and intense kiss, he poured all his love and affection into that kiss.
Pepper had experience dealing with the media, the board members and everybody who wanted a piece of Tony’s time. So right now she was doing the one thing her best friend couldn’t do right now and that was keep the vultures away. She would make sure no more leaks happened, she was making the board members dance to her own tune and divert them so skillfully that they even forgot that they never got answers to the questions they had initially asked. And a day in hell would freeze over before the news of Tony’s pregnancy was released.
But he is on his knees in the Avengers compound’s medical bay. He is on his knees and he feels rundown.
“Then what? What after you see him, see what you have done to him? Then will you leave him again, run back, play fugitives again.”
The intensity of the situation was making Steve feel as if it was a steep mountain climb, he was looking for his omega, his inner alpha had chastised him with a silver tongue for doing this, held him responsible for the state of his omega. He had felt kind of lost since the moment he had dropped his shield and limped out of the bunker. He had held bucky under his arm and left his mate behind, since that moment his inner alpha had been anxious, uncomfortable as if telling Steve that he was making a grave mistake, that he should go back that he should tend to his mate that it was wrong, wrong so wrong. Steve had repressed his feeling, properly gotten bucky the help he needed and moved on, but since the bunker he couldn’t get tony out of his head, Tony who was always there, he would fall asleep and dream about his warm brown eyes devoid of all emotions and the get up see tony follow him around all day with accusation and hurt in his eyes.
Tony felt butterflies in his stomach, it was magnificent,  he couldn’t  comprehend how after two years of dating and ten years of marriage Steve still managed to sweep Tony off of his feet.
The picture shouldn’t have been taken in the first place , no wait that wasn’t correct he shouldn’t have put his husband in this state in the first place.
“I think it has been a long time since we talked.” replied Jarvis.
He still had his dog-tags in his hands.
Jarvis laughed, it was very like his Anthony to ask direct and blunt questions.
“It must have been easy. It must have been so easy to hurt me, to never tell me. to break me.”
Steve had a warm glow on his face from all the candles around and an innocent smile on his face, he looked like he did all those years ago when he had first asked Tony out on a date and was scared that Tony was going to turn him down even when Tony had fallen in love with Steve the moment he had laid his eyes on the baby blues.
“I can’t believe you did that. You are such a dork”
“Oh! Definitely my child I think you have had enough of heartbreak, but that never stopped you did it? You always were so carefree with your heart, your love. Like I said you would fall down and then you would always get up. Similarly you would feel your heartbreak, then put your heart back and give your love unconditionally to whoever asked next. I always admired your resilience.” said Jarvis.
It's about then that some enterprising asshole cuts the power, and another decides to really start the party with a flash-bang.
“Barnes does,” he says, which was not what she was expecting. “I get maybe a fraction of what the two of you have been through, and the guy deserves more than that.”
He saunters off towards the building, as though turning his back on the Winter Soldier is nothing to be concerned about; so far, only Steve has been that blasé about showing Barnes his back, and that’s because Steve is a moron who forgets that the man he’s welcomed into his home is not the same one he lost seventy years ago. Barnes isn’t expecting a second person to be so comfortable in his presence, not as long as he lives, and the surprise of it leaves him stationary on the roof.
since then."
"And you didn't stop him because…?"
"Yeah, that'll work," Barton mutters sarcastically; much as Maria finds his attitude challenging when she's trying to lead a briefing, she can't disagree with his assessment.
The asset flinches at the abrupt change of tone, but manages not to retreat.
As it is, JARVIS puts the chances of Sir attempting to kill the Winter Soldier on sight at 29%, and that is guaranteed to end badly; even if Sir survives, the damage it will do to his relationship with Captain Rogers and the Avengers as a whole will be irreversible. He had hoped to save this card until the odds were slightly further in their favour, but Sir's current emotional distress is such that, combined with the concrete location, JARVIS has to take the risk.
"Crystal," Tony agrees, sounding about as cowed as Pepper has ever managed to make him. "I'll be there if I can, Pepper, I promise."
Or so he thought, anyway; Tony's not expecting it at all when he hears a voice, very small and inexplicably his, say, "They weren't abusive."
There are many things Pepper loves about her job. She loves her offices, with their oh-so-comfortable chairs and her carefully maintained plants, and her employees, most of them just as committed as she is to the success of their own projects and the company as a whole. She loves that Stark Industries offers the best benefits package of any Fortune 500 company in the country and the fact that they also have the lowest staff turnover rate as a result, however much the old farts on the board might object to what they consider an unnecessary expense. She loves that they can offer opportunities to people who otherwise might not have had options, and that everything the company does is aimed at making the world and its citizens the best they possibly can be.
"Steve," he says. "Speak of the devil."
He’s already on tiptoes by the end of it, and Steve is leaning in, and in, breathing in Tony’s declaration like it’s all he needs to live, and oh.
He turns his head, lips brushing against Steve’s throat, light enough that it could be an accident if that’s how Steve wants to see it.
means that he doesn’t always listen.
to keep following, because Tony's heard him regurgitate instructions that are much older in order to justify whatever course of action he's decided to take. And he knows objectively that JARVIS… approves of Steve, that's probably the best way Tony can put it, so of course JARVIS would want to help him, even if it does sting that the approval apparently continues despite the fact that Steve has fucked off to another country chasing down his ex (just a little bit, okay, it's not like they were exclusive, they definitely weren't in love or anything, and maybe Tony hasn't been with anyone else since well before Steve left but that doesn't mean their relationship was anything more than the two of them letting off steam, Steve made it perfectly clear that was all he wanted from the outset and he’s done nothing at all to indicate that he wanted that to change).
Dinner is very much
One of his bottles is missing when he gets there, but Tony's pretty sure that's not JARVIS' doing, and he thinks it's probably the least he owes Clint.
But Tony deserves more than that, and if Tony's going to hate him, it's not going to be because Steve has lied about this.
to Bruce, which isn't entirely an improvement. "Ask Steve," he says. "I'm sure he'd be thrilled to tell you all about it."
"Oh, hell, yes," Wilson answers, practically ploughing through Tony and Bruce on his way into the jet, where it seems to occur to him that he doesn't actually know what he's looking for or where he might find it.
The file Natasha sent him is all well and good – or, you know, indescribably awful and the worst thing Tony's ever read in his life, but that's not the point, is it? – and Tony's found a lot of information for himself, mostly through concentrated examination of every politically or financially significant death since the forties and digging through all the files Steve's sent JARVIS from the Hydra bases he's taken down. He knows a lot about the Winter Soldier, almost certainly much more than Steve does, but that's the issue.
"Right," Clint agrees, since that seems to be the answer Tony's looking for, and he's clearly invested enough in his unnecessary but not unwelcome project that Clint won't be able to change his mind. "So, that's a net arrow, and the molecular whatever, that's glue, yeah?" Tony nods, and Clint waves at the next unopened file, intriguingly named
, is Steve first thought, once he realises why Tony (Tony
“Yup,” Clint agrees. “Surprised me, too. Oh, and he said he prefers Barnes, if you ever see him out and about.”
Bucky made no secret of the fact that Steve was the centre of his universe, and it turns out that's the kind of thing that sticks around.
Bucky sighs, dropping to the couch at Steve’s side. “Okay, maybe then, but have you talked about it since? At all?”
"Oh," Bruce says. "You're telling me you and Steve were friends-with-benefits?"
Bruce is as used to Tony's over the top, enthusiastic arguments as he is his
"Sir's recollection of the conversation is accurate, Doctor Banner," JARVIS confirms, his tone as calm and even as always, but for some reason he decides against stopping there. "However, I think perhaps the nuances may have escaped Sir's notice."
"My apologies for disturbing you, Sergeant Wilson."
,” he stutters, shakily returning her smile and putting what looks like an awful lot of effort into meeting her eyes. He’s clearly too embarrassed at being caught staring to make conversation as he scans her purchases, and in less than a minute Nathalie has her shopping bagged up and her wallet out ready to pay.
"It's all good," Clint answers, copying Tony's hand gestures after his own apology. "Water, bridge, whatever. This glue stuff of Bruce's, how long does it take to set, because there's this kid with a skateboard in my building who really needs to be taught a lesson."
“Oh,” Steve manages, feeling massively unintelligent. Of course JARVIS would have warned Tony. Unlike Steve, JARVIS has the good sense to at least try to make sure Tony isn’t going to walk into any situation that’s going to make him uncomfortable, even if Tony’s
"Let's get this shit over with, JARVIS," he instructs, and tries very hard to pretend he doesn't have to hang on to the railing to stay upright.
There's the scratch of pen on paper, followed by the sound of Tony's footsteps as he rounds the bed; even against a carpet as thick as this one, Steve can still make out each step he takes. He pauses a moment at Steve's side of the bed, presumably so he can put whatever note he's scribbled on the bedside table, and then he's gone, the door snicking quietly closed behind him.
point, and not a question it's unreasonable for Sam to ask. "Fine, Tony
is supposed to be your mission statement.” Barnes caps off his summary with a weary sigh. “I didn't want to play this card, but you don't seem to be giving me a choice.”
paid for, is he?"
Steve tries calling him almost a dozen times in the half hour after JARVIS announces he's opened the email.
It's close enough to empty that when Clint scrapes his plate clean and stands up to get himself another beer Tony asks for one as well. The request gets him a narrow eyed frown from Bruce, but since he doesn't vocalise whatever his objection is Tony figures it's not a problem.
Steve hasn't called by the time Tony crosses into US air-space. He's had a text from Bruce asking where he is, then another few detailing his plans to spend the day sightseeing with Steve and Wilson. He's got yet another voicemail from Rhodey warning him that the Avengers really should start getting permission from heads of state before entering foreign countries on non-emergency missions. His inbox is full of the usual chaotic mix of emails from different SI departments, from scientists asking for a consult and from charitable foundations asking for donations or public declarations of support.
Whatever it is Hulk has got hold of, Steve's is clearly too occupied by trying to dodge it to continue arguing, and Tony doesn't at all feel like he's taking advantage when he mutes the line to Steve and says, "Get it booked ASAP, J. He won't argue once I've paid for it."
He puts the toothpaste and his toothbrush in his washbag, then chucks Steve's at him, mock-glaring when Steve catches it.
"Steve?" Tony asks, his voice decidedly not coming from the room Steve's faltering outside of. "Well, I guess this explains why you didn't answer your door. Figured you just didn't want to see me."
is not the word Tony would use, based on this story, and he says as much when Peggy falls silent. "I mean," he explains, "It kind of sounds like he was trying to snake you away from Steve."
"Tuhmrrr," Tony answers through a jaw-cracking yawn. "Schleee."
convince him, not when Tony spends half his time determined to deny that he has feelings about anything. Emotional openness isn't entirely Steve's strong suit, either, but since Sam took it upon himself to vandalise all of Steve's misery doodles, he has been trying, and he'll keep trying, if that's what Tony needs from him.
Barnes turns his hand under hers, putting them palm to palm, and closes his scarred, awful, murderer’s fingers around her dainty ones. “I’m sorry, Natalia,” he says, the words only a little more than a whisper, knowing as he does so that this isn’t something he can make better by apologising.
FHD takes a step back, giving Clint enough space to stand up and also to get a good look at him. The knife has vanished as quickly as it appeared, but Clint can count six – no, wait, there's something funky on his right forearm, too, so that's at least seven – weapon-shaped bulges beneath his (dirty, slightly stinky) hoody, and he's pretty sure there are others he's yet to notice; the guy's well enough armed that even Tasha would be impressed, even if she'd be way less wowed by his unkempt appearance.
Steve's got enough experience of pre-caffeine Tony to translate this into English, so he doesn't bother asking him to repeat himself. "It can't wait until tomorrow, Tony," he says softly, fingers tracing the scar tissue on Tony's chest where the arc reactor used to be. "If I don't tell you now, I never will."
"JARVIS'll have a new cell waiting whenever he shows up again," Tony says. "Though I still think it'd be easier if you let me chip him the next time he falls asleep in his cereal. Or, ooh, an
The note goes on the nightstand as Steve's side of the bed, and then Tony stands there a moment, mentally debating the merits of a goodbye kiss. It's what he wants, but even a kiss to Steve's forehead will wake him up, and then they'll wind up kissing properly and Tony will be even later than he already is.
"Okay," he says after a moment. "I guess you're busy. There's food upstairs, whenever you're hungry."
There's the briefest of pauses, small enough to go unnoticed if Tony was talking to a human, glaringly obvious given that he's not. "The numbers I have on record are no longer in service," JARVIS says, though he doesn't wait long enough for Tony to get all victorious. "However, I have taken the liberty of checking Captain Rogers' contact list, and I believe I have an active number. Dialling now, Sir."
“Only…?” Tony prompts, when Steve has been quiet a few too many seconds.
“No powers here,” Natalia says. “Just practice. With the right training, you too can be a terrifying Russian assassin.”
Sam wants to hate Barnes. Bastard fucked up Sam’s car, trashed his wings (stolen, maybe, and since replaced and greatly improved by Stark, but that is
"Yeah, I'm here," he says instead, and, when Steve doesn't reply, adds, "What's up?"
while he
of that. There was a meeting Pepper insisted I had to be at, so when was already light when I woke up I panicked, forgot the time difference, and tried to leave without waking you because you were tired and it seemed like it was the considerate thing to do. I promise, that’s all it was, and I really did want to talk to you.”
“Okay,” Steve says, when Tony’s just about finished his first burger. “Bucky told me what happened with Thor this morning, and I think I owe you an apology.”
Steve hesitates, giving Barnes one last look before deciding to make what Barnes thinks is probably his first ever tactical retreat. “Fine, we’ll go,” he says, speaking for both of them like he’s somehow missed the fact that Sam is already edging his way into the elevator. “Let JARVIS know if you need anything, okay, Bucky?”
He waits a moment for JARVIS to answer, then hangs up, jostling Steve's arm until Steve manages to jerk himself out of his stunned stupor.
The monkey is back, but it's done with dancing, instead marching its way across the backs of receipts, the blank spaces on newspapers, page after page of hotel stationery. There's a bear, sometimes, like the ones they made back in the war, only the one in Steve's pictures is old and worn, leaking stuffing from half a dozen places, one arm a mess of patches, and in most of the pictures it's hiding, little bits of bear poking out from behind trees or above the roofs of buildings. It's running, and stupid monkey-Steve has nothing but scraps of dropped Bucky-bear innards to chase after.
He remembers Natalia, too. Every bit as small as Steve, and every bit as fierce. His Natalia was bright and sharp, absolutely lethal even as a child. She was an attentive pupil, the best of them, but he cannot believe the Winter Soldier was ever a dance instructor.
, Tony thinks, cranking up the volume even further.
wind up on the roof of one of the most secure buildings in Manhattan?”
look; Steve will say he's fine; Sam will sigh, tell him, "yeah, okay, but you know it's okay not to be fine?" and then come up with an anecdote that manages to make light of what Steve's thinking without making fun of it, all without Steve actually saying what he's thinking. It usually ends with Sam giving him a hug and Steve feeling painfully like crying without being entirely sure why.
His outburst is met with silence, even from JARVIS, and Tony lurches up from the sofa, storming across to the coffee pot and pouring himself another cup. He's halfway through it before he feels balanced enough to turn around again, leaning back against the counter and looking back at Bruce.
Steve had asked, earning himself maybe ten seconds of silence, just long enough for him to distract Tony into another round of injury-checking).
"Er, yeah, pretty sure. I mean, since I was the one who was there and all."
Barnes knows JARVIS is going to announce his presence, so he doesn’t bother attempting to be stealthy, just lurks outside the door until Stark acknowledges him.
the point.
He reads it, then reads it a second time before folding it back up, pressing it flat along the same creases Steve left in it.
, pretending to be asleep seems like the best option."
“JARVIS?” he says hesitantly. “You record everything, right?”
Some have, upon further examination, been false positives – Sir's Fantastically Accurate Recognition Tool, whilst superior to all others in existence, is still not infallible – and whilst some are undeniably Sergeant Barnes, they have all been in public places and lasted only a matter of minutes. As Sir's instructions relating to Sergeant Barnes' location ["If you get a fix on the Winter Soldier or Sergeant Barnes or whatever the fuck else you want to call him, you tell me and only me."] seem to request a long term location, JARVIS has been compiling data points rather than presenting Sir with each individual occurrence.
"Somewhat greater if you make the request than if you don't, Sir."
Banner is the first to respond, with Barton not far behind; unsurprising, since both are in the building, Banner in his lab and Barton playing video games in the rec room. Rogers takes a little longer, given that he has to actually answer a phone, but he and Wilson appear on a single screen alongside the others.
"Right," Maria says. "We've been receiving reports from Cusco, Peru, of oversized arachnids. Initially, the creatures appeared harmless, if somewhat alarming, and then some rocket scientist decided to draw a gun on them. Turns out, their – do spiders have hides? – are impervious to bullets, and since then we've had two confirmed injuries."
“He’s on his way?”
Tony heads up the ramp to help out, pulling out the box containing the wingpack from the kit locker and entering the sixteen-digit setup code for the biometric lock. "Hand here," he instructs, pointing to the correct panel, then inputting the secondary confirmation code.
Steve is out of there like a rocket the second the bay door opens enough for him to squeeze himself through, and Sam regrets not wearing the wings as he dashes after him. It had seemed overkill back when he was planning for this moment, not to mention fairly uncomfortable to sleep in on the jet, but it would have made it easier to keep up with Steve and he sort of thinks the articulated shielding might come in handy.
Nathalie is more than ready for the day.
It’s apparently Steve’s turn to be surprised, as though he thought Tony could sit through the
Because he’s hands down the best person any of them have ever met, JARVIS has seen fit to keep the elevator (and therefore Tony) waiting for him, and Steve steps inside just before the doors close.
“The roof,” he says. “Please. If I- if that’s…”
It’s hard for Tony not to scoff at that. “No?”
,” she answers, smiling at the kid working the checkout desk. “
“Okay,” Steve echoes, reaching out across the table, folding Tony’s hand in his and just… holding. “Good.”
Sam walks in, his expression equal parts surprised and sort of befuddled, but he handles it with his usual grace. “You don’t ask much, do you, Barnes?” he says, raising an eyebrow at Steve, then turning towards the kitchen. “I’m gonna need a hell of a lot of coffee, if that’s what you need from me. You want?”
Honestly, he thinks he’s getting the hang of the whole
“Tony,” Steve says again, softer. “The first thing you said when you woke up in bed with me was
Physically speaking, Tony is equally prepared to kill the Soldier or to offer him sanctuary.
"Tony," Clint interrupts; the drunken ramblings seem set to go on for a while, and as profitable as Tony's attempts to apologise without actually apologising might be, Clint feels uncomfortably mercenary about taking advantage of the situation. "You know you don't have to do that, right? Saying sorry is a lot easier."
The display is impressive enough that Sam watches from the doorway a moment, trying to work out how Steve's gone from being equal parts pleased to be home and anxious to start the hunt for the Winter Soldier to being six foot whatever of barely contained anger.
instead.”
Barnes was not expecting that, not at all, and it takes him a long time to really understand. It sounds like Steve is asking his permission, but that’s so patently ridiculous it obviously can’t be the case. Barnes can’t remember Steve ever waiting for anyone’s permission, let alone his, and the idea that he might start now that Barnes is barely even himself is just stupid.
Captain America is
“-dey? Rhodey, are you even listening to me?” Tony demands, some fifteen minutes into a phone call (of which Jim paid attention to the first twenty seconds, just long enough to ascertain that this is a Tony-emergency rather than a world-ending one).
"Mhmm," Tony agrees, "Any excuse to share a bed with me."
It starts when JARVIS reports a rise in the number of people complaining about large spiders in the vicinity of their homes. It's not a big enough increase that a human might pick up on it, but JARVIS is not human, and apparently two percent more tweets about arachnids for three consecutive hours  is significant enough for him to bring to their attention.
"Could have fooled me," Tony mutters, deliberately just loud enough for her to hear, then raises his voice when he continues. "You knew James Barnes, right?"
," Tony curses again, quieter but still utterly furious, and he's not being chased out of his own goddamn home by his own goddamn creation.
Bruce and Pepper send Clint identical
He didn't think he was listening when the man on the reception desk read out the room numbers he was giving them, up until the moment he finds himself standing outside room 403, hand raised to knock on the door.
“It’s not a cell, Buck,” says Steve, when the asset finds the right words to ask him. He sounds- sad, the asset thinks. Mournful, though the asset doesn’t know where the word comes from, or what frame of reference he’s drawing on to decide that it applies. “It’s your bedroom.”
"I understand, Sir," JARVIS replies. Tony can't decide if he actually sounds judgemental or if it's just that he's expecting to be judged, but it's uncomfortable either way. "If I might make a suggestion?"
"What?" Tony answers, "Pep, no, it's-
Despite the fact that Barnes never actually confirmed that he wanted Clint to contact Natalia, he’s not entirely surprised when Sam tells him that’s what’s happened, nor is he remotely surprised when he leaves his bedroom on the morning of the third day to find her sat in the kitchen with Steve and Sam.
They had gotten married at the courthouse with Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Thor Ana and Edwin Jarvis in attendance.
***********************************************
All mistake are my own.
Tony was feeling elated and then confused, he felt it was the best news of his life and he wanted to turn to Steve and ..but he …he couldn’t because Steve wasn’t here, Steve had kept a secret from Tony, Steve had taken a vibranium shield to Tony’s heart.
He wanted to be happy so happy, he wanted to tell everybody , shout it off the top of the empire state building and tell it to anybody who would listen that he was going to have a baby. A baby , his baby.
A chocked sob escaped him, he finally lets go, hot water spring from his eyes, he was on his knees, he was clutching Nat’s jacket with utter desperation, if he could just clutch it had hard enough maybe  he could make things right.
“Look up” Tony interrupts
One more chapter to go
“Because of all the things that you are a self-lover  is not something that you are, never have been, it did fall on your closest friends to remind you from time to time that you are human not a means to an end not just some engineer not a problem solver but a human with a beating heart. I think you were hurt pretty badly to have come to me this time.”
“That is one option” replied Jarvis.
“It’s okay Pete.”
“ I just want you to go and  I just want take care of my kid”
“You remember the Halloween you dressed up as Captain America?” asked Jarvis
Tony laughs, Jarvis is trying to wrangle Bernard back into a cage. Tony likes Bernard, he is pretty. Tony is lying with his head on his mother’s lap, she is swiftly combing his hair.
He still has too much to do, get the accords properly shaped up, meet the spider kid, handle the board of directors, handle the media, handle R&D of his company, get Steve away from here, away from him.
Tony knows he will get through this but he doesn’t know if he will ever recover from his husband’s betrayal, if he will forgive him.
Steve enters the room, he looks defeated, sad, tired. He doesn’t look up and stands there quietly. Tony doesn’t care anymore but someone please tell that to his racing heart.
Tony turned the key and opened the door, it had been snowing all day long and he had gotten stuck in the traffic, he was hungry but that was two hours ago now he was fucking starving and Steve’s car was in the driveway but then why were all the lights in the house switched off?
Afghanistan had eaten at Rhodes’s soul for three months where he had blamed himself for losing tony, for letting him go in the other van, for not protecting him, Siberia was going to eat him away for the rest of his life.
“Am I dead?” Tony asked.
Tony always wore the rings on his left hand, no matter how rich they got or where he was, Steve was going to be a part of him, it was a testimony of their love, their hardships, the world that they had built together. He had promised  himself to Steve  till the end of his days and he intended to carry his promise till his last breath. He loved Steve with his whole heart, he looked down at Steve, he was kneeling in front of him, with his aww shucks smile and sparkle in his eyes, in his hand a ring with a  single cushion cut diamond on a platinum ring  promising of a life time yet to come.
Tony feels so betrayed, his whole being battered, betrayed and beaten down, his husband had kept a secret, a secret which Tony had every right to know, he had laid beside him promised to love him and then kept all of this a secret, had chosen his best friend  over his own husband and that stung, it stung Tony a lot.
He wanted to tell Tony that his family was here, that he, pepper, happy and vision were here, that they will be here to handle him, handle his broken heart give him all the support that he needed. He wanted to tell the brunet that he just needed to wake up, everything else would be fine.They would solve everything, he would be there with tony every step of the way as he was sure tony would be there with him.
Tony who is his husband, his mate who was right in his anger but who was so angry that he couldn’t see that it was not Bucky. Steve couldn’t blame Tony a secret like that would have carved a hole in his soul too, but in those moments he couldn’t see right from wrong. But right now he wanted to see Tony, he needed to see him, the need to see his mate was so deep within him as if it had been calling at him for eons. Last he had seen Tony was when he had broken his husbands arc reactor and left him behind, the betrayal on his face was something that was etched into the fresh batch of his nightmares. Then he had completely gone numb on seeing Tony’s picture in the hospital bed, taken from an angle that spoke of treachery.
“No you need to listen, I don’t need you anymore, don’t want you anymore, you are nothing to me. I want you to leave, I want….. I want you to never come back, go away Steve please just turn around and go and please don’t come back, for the love of god Steve I beg you don’t make me go through it again. There are tears flowing down his face, he can’t make out from where they are coming but he is not being able to stop also.
He wanted to bang, break something, why was it happening to him, why can’t for once in his life he catch a break, he just …he just wants….he just wants his baby to be safe. His baby who isn’t even born yet, who is already caught between all this, his tiny little baby.
“Go Tony, this place is not for you, not for a long time anyway.” said Jarvis
Steve walked in silence looking for the room, he walked as if he had been very recently defeated,  he walked as if he was unsure of himself, he was weary anxious and so tired. There was a little tremor in his walk implying a certain sense of doom, his body itched with the need to be with his husband, he wanted to jump out of his own skin if that could settle the brain noise. He was waiting for the energy to leave his body or his soul to be finally disgusted and leave the treacherous body that embodied it.
As he opened the room, his legs nearly gave again too, Natasha helped him support his weight. Tony looked too pale, he looked so small lying in the too big white bed. He had steel coloured bags under his eye and his lips were pale. He was connected to a dozen monitors, their beeps felt like accusations to Steve.
Steve is looking at him as if Tony had taken a bat to everything he loves. He looks at Tony with so much sorrow, pain and hurt that Tony doesn’t know what to do. Tony has gone numb inside and he doesn’t have the energy and he is so tired
Behind them vision was listening to everything with a certain naivety that looked so like Tony’s that it crushed rhodey’s heart. Happy was standing behind him as if he could he would block all the pain from tony just keep him safe for once in his life.
In the background he could feel the beeps slowly getting faster and he could feel it in his chest.
Natasha had just gotten up, she had just joined Steve, Sam and Wanda two days ago. Scott and Clint had stayed back in Wakanda to manage a plea deal and get back to the states. She was just about to get up and brush her teeth, she found a dumbfound Steve who had just finished his morning routine standing in front of the TV watching a news channel-
“I’ll swing  by later this week after school. Thanks Mr. Stark”
“It is common for omegas to not know until a few weeks have passed already, he gave us quite the scare, it was touch and go over there for a while, you need to understand that he is in an extremely fragile state. He was under surgery for more than 8 hours, we were concerned about the baby.” explained the doctor
“Sorry doesn’t even begin to cut it…
“I think I have had my share of heartbreak for this lifetime.” said Tony
Pepper wanted to scream, cry shake Tony, beg cry plead tony to get up, just get up. She wanted to share the happiness with Tony about finally getting his pup, indulge him , listen to him ramble about his pregnancy pains, about the baby, about how overprotective Steve was getting, how he was going to get fat and everything. She just wanted him to get up.
Tony wants Steve to look up, look at Tony, see him, see what he did, he wants to be cruel to Steve, he wants to be quick and sharp and cruel and he thinks he wants to punch and kick and scream and hurt and he just wants Steve to look up.
“I think I just want to forget all of it Jarvis, rip the band-aid away and move on.” said Tony.
Rhodey is in PT again, Pepper has stepped out, Vision and Happy are outside if he needs anything.
He had read somewhere that calling somebody by their name helps something, he can’t remember what, he can’t remember what is it supposed to help ,he wonders if Nat is trying to do that, trying to help with something.
This was difficult to write. I wrote and then re-wrote it several times, i do hope you guys like it!
After a year Steve had been the one to approach Tony first, he was the one who had asked him out on a date first, Tony had been too busy wallowing in his self-loathing and doubting himself but Steve had broken down all those walls he had built around him one at a time and then Tony had fallen in love with Steve, one by one and then once in for all, it was as simple as that.
He feels as if he doesn’t get everything out he is going to burn, boil from the inside out, his soul turned into ash, his bones charred, he has a need, a need so deep  to let go before his heart explodes and all the years of hurt and pain escape him and burn everything to the ground.
The lift tinged and its doors opened, rhodey, pepper, happy and vision got in \and then went up towards room tony had been shifted to.
“Steve I am going to touch you right now.”
Betrayal that words was all too familiar, he had stumbled across the word, felt it, lived it, resented it and then had tried to forget it. But forgetting was never easy for Tony.
I need to go, to I don’t know what Steve but at this moment I want to be anywhere but here, be with anyone but you.”
In this moment Steve was getting impatient because he knew his mate was severely wounded his inner alpha was being called to tend to his mate but he couldn’t just waltz in there to see Tony, chances were he was going to be tackled to the ground, tasered and then tied and never let anywhere near Tony.
The thought was so distracting that for a moment he forgot about what was happening , what had gone down in the past few days.
Someday somebody is going to write a poem about a man who had a broken heart since birth and he lost all the love he found.
“How is he doing right now? asked Pepper
Friday had shown them the footage of what had happened in Siberia after contacting Rhodey and making sure if her boss was safe.
“I have managed to disable Friday enough for us to get inside without putting anybody at any risk but we will have to be careful because with Pepper and Happy running the show tony is going to be heavily guarded.” informed Natasha
“Tony, love”
Pepper was beside Tony, she was holding his hand. She was talking to him, if only she could concentrate.
“4 weeks” replied the doctor
Tony had mastered the technique of deflection at a very young age, he deflects very well , throws the proverbial ball far far away  , Tony knows that, Steve also knows that.
Tony pulled him again into a heated kiss.
He dreams about his mama. She is wearing a yellow silk dress with white heels and white earrings too. Her hair falls on her shoulder and her freckles glow under the sun. They are sitting in Stark mansion’s backyard. It’s late in the afternoon, the sun little over the horizon, there a gentle summer breeze going around and the backyard is warm with the sun’s rays.
Tony cackled.
“NO” reply both pepper and rhodey reply simultaneously
Pepper lifted her hand and for once he thought she was going to slap him across his face, he deserves it he knows that but he still winces, recoils but the slap never comes.
Comments and kudos are great motivators.
“Tony I am sorry. I really …..
“I am also going to get you out of the wheelchair as soon as I am out of here. No actually get my tab in here and we can start right away.”
Pepper was walking down the corridor with Jim at her side in his wheelchair, she wasn’t sure she was every going to get used to seeing the man in a wheelchair. All her life she had known Rhodey, she knew him as a proud hardworking beta, he had dedicated his life to the US military, being a liaison to Stark Industries and then to War Machine, there was a certain cruelty to how he was being rewarded for all his hardships.
After a beat Tony replied “I think they finally broke me Jarvis.”
Natasha looked at Steve horrified.
!” replied Tony]
“Mr. Stark, thank god you are okay, I was…I was a little worried sir but thank god…thank god you are okay. I saw your picture…it worried me a little , I thought …I thought but happy was here, he told me not to worry but I was a little scared…a little scared…
They hadn’t been in a good place then, Tony fresh out of college and Steve who enlisted for the army, Tony had been furious but Steve promised him that he would comeback, comeback to Tony, so they had gotten married and Tony had waited, waited for Steve to finally comeback home after two tours in Afghanistan.  They had very little to their name so they got married in a courthouse surrounded by their friends with rings that he had gotten from pawnshops and started their journey together. Meanwhile when Steve was in the army Tony had worked, he worked hard in designing specs for his arc reactor and getting his patents, he built Stark Resilient up from the ground and revolutionized  green energy forever. They had worked hard, worked double shifts to make ends meet but at the end of the day they saw each other and had the chance to spend their forever together it was worth it.
“I didn’t think coming to you was even an option!” said Tony
Tony remembered the day like it was yesterday, the day he had married the love of his life.
Sometimes Tony feels people calling him, their voices are muffled also they are very far away, in the background and tony is here with his mama and he is safe and warm and content. He is also very tired but he doesn’t know why and he doesn’t want to leave.
Pepper had tried to console him, tell him he couldn’t have done anything, that he was not responsible for this, that this blame was not his, it was none other than Steve Roger’s, she had been very stern about it.
Tony wanted to stay here, stay here forever in his home with Ana and Jarvis where love always flowed freely, he thought that maybe he could stay here, but deep in his heart he would know that he couldn’t stay here, just like he knew he was meant to survive, meant to go on, meant to live his life with some of the best people he knew.
Tony moved forward towards the center of the room and Steve took his hand in his hand.
Then he was in the avengers compound’s med bay and had been sleeping for the past 10 days, and he thought it had to be his personal best.
Rhodey could see there were tear streaks that where framing her face. She was standing beside him refusing to sit.
FLASHBACK-
“Is he/she okay?” asked Tony.
I am a sucker for godmother Peggy which she totally was.
He sets up a call with the spider kid.
“You don’t have to come with me”
