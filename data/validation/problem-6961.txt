He breathes, slowly and regularly, like he’s done many nights after a nightmare, sometimes alone, sometimes with Rhodey holding his hand and telling him his weird War Machine stories. Sometimes he’s been the one holding Rhodey’s hand.
“Shh, hey.” The kindest, kindest voice. “You hadn’t noticed how wet you’d got, huh? I could smell it since the first drop, all the way from there.”
“You said Sokovia was not on me because I was trying to do the right thing and it got out of control. So I got my redeeming factors, as you call them, but you refuse to share yours?”
Tony looks up, between the branches of the tree. He picks up a peach and gives it to Steve. It’s deliberate, how he lets his fingers brush Steve’s. Tony looks at their hands. He grimaces.
Steve touches him with his free hand, thrusts harder into him with his fingers, says, “You’ve never been this hard before,” he strokes once, twice, three times, and Tony comes, suddenly, violently, shaking all over, sobbing, screaming, losing every shred of control he has ever had over himself.
. He couldn’t feel it quite like this with his fingers. It makes Steve feel safe, like nothing bad can happen as long as him and Tony are like this.
Three days during which they got to talk, and smile, and know each other more than in all the years since that day in Germany fighting Loki put together. Steve laughed at Tony’s crazy stories; Tony cracked up at Steve’s weird sense of humor.
But he needs to remind himself that it’s unlikely Tony will actually be able to have another child. Sure, he went into heat, and he could even maybe get pregnant, but bringing it to term, actually having the kid? That’s another thing. So many things could go wrong, and Steve’s hang-ups may never be eased up.
Tony breaks the kiss and his mouth stays open in a silent shout of pleasure. He turns his head away then, lowering it on his chest.
And for the first time in his life Steve feels like there’s something underneath the earth, a thread, a fabric of the universe that holds all life together, that makes it all make sense, that fights against entropy tooth and nail.
He pounds into Tony as fast as he can, pushes in as deep as he can go, kisses Tony’s tears away from his face, swallows all his moans, takes it all in.
“—nag you… oh. Oh, that’s. That’s good, Tony. I thought you had but... I didn’t know you had a drinking problem.”
) but it doesn’t happen this time. Instead, he thinks about his dream. The cave, the need to find Steve. The fact that he kept on looking, no matter how hopeless the task.
“But, as I said. You don’t have to. If you don’t want to have sex with him, especially like this, then you just don’t do it. It’s your body, you get to decide. No one would blame you. But I thought you should know what could happen. You have a child with him; you deserve to know.”
There’s a deep frown on Steve’s forehead for a few seconds, then it’s smoothed out by dreadful understanding. His eyes widen.
But Steve touches Tony’s forearm, then travels up—big fingertips, slightly tapping at the skin, sliding over it in a whisper—to burrow his hand underneath Tony’s sleeve, grabbing at his bicep, at his deltoid, stretching the cotton until it might rip. Steve’s other hand is at the hem of the t-shirt a moment later, lifting it, and in a brief blur Tony’s half-naked, stumbling a little when he almost loses his balance on the padded floor.
“Also, I, uh. I don’t want to throw you out, but I need to make an important phone call. In private.”
And Tony, with his reluctant smiles and his simple clothes and the inconsistency of his silk robe and all his scars—the ones on the outside of him, that he wears in spite of shame and self-loathing, and those inside him, that he bears with courage and patience.
He can’t react. The only thing he can do is watch the man’s face, red with effort and contorted with fury, and think that he’ll never be free of him.
“I got one I did this morning,” Steve says, his voice unsteady. “But I don’t know if you’re gonna like it.”
Tony thinks about yesterday, the way he felt while Steve guided him into the bathtub with him. The warm water lulling them both like the most affectionate nanny. Steve’s hand, so big against his own. Steve’s skin never got wrinkled, not even after an hour in the water.
“Okay,” he says softly, and takes off his jeans. He waits for Tony to settle under the covers with Maria, then crawls into bed too.
“I know why he said that. He doesn’t know me very well, maybe he just wanted to lash out against me, but... I keep thinking about it.”
It could be the dream that morning, or what happened after he woke up, or Tony’s hand in his during breakfast, or the way Tony’s tongue and lips curled around the softness of the sounds when he was talking to the vendors—how smooth and seamless the words felt to Steve, who didn’t really understand them. It could be how serene Tony looks right now, eating this theoretically disgusting but actually awesome panino in big bites that make his cheeks bulge, as if being a bit gross is the only way to enjoy this kind of food; it could be any number of things, but Steve feels something heavy settle behind his navel and something warm tugging at the skin between his legs, and—
“Yeah, it... what Ultron did wasn’t your fault. Sokovia is not on you. But, yeah. You should’ve said something. I just... I blame myself for... I wish we were closer, back then, I wish, I wish we felt safe telling such things to each other.”
And yet, Steve can feel a pull in his jaw, a snarl across his lips. There’s a claim to be made and he’s not making it, and his body is starting to react to it, badly, because he’s in pain and he’s weak and he’s tired and Tony should be his and his only, his always.
It’s not shame that colors Steve’s voice, no, but he’s a bit bashful throughout the admission. “The first time I had sex, yeah.”
There’s a moment of silence, a terrifying moment of silence, and then Tony nods and kisses his cheek.
Steve leaves, and wishes the café wasn’t so crowded, that he could get back to Tony faster than this.
Coming to visit Florence in late August probably wasn’t the best idea, Steve muses an hour and a half later while he and Tony make their way from the parking lot to the city center on foot. The city is crowded, hot, and confusing. Steve keeps an eye on Tony; he doesn’t want him to overheat again because of the undershirt he’s wearing.
. They would have had more time. They could have had so much more. He could have given Steve so much more. Instead, Steve is now stuck with him and his ancient excuse of a body.
Tony isn’t hungry, but he forces himself to eat what Steve makes, because he knows Steve would do the same in his place. He drinks his water when Steve looks at him sideways after he tries to get up from the table leaving his glass full.
His head snaps up, eyes trained on the ceiling—exactly where Sarah’s crib is placed upstairs. He twitches with an energy he’s trying very hard to contain, but it’s spilling out of him nonetheless. His hands are shaking with it, and he’s about to bolt out of the room and go look for what’s
After dinner, they settle on the porch chairs watching the last few rays of sunshine disappear beyond the hills, leaving the countryside immersed in a peaceful darkness only sometimes interrupted by fireflies.
“Tony... shit. Tony, hey, hey. Can I touch you?” Steve’s crouching in front of Tony, one knee on the floor. He’s close and he smells like roses, he smells like blue.
Tony understood everything about Bucky and his situation as soon as he had time to think about it, just like he said he would have if only Steve had gone to him first, if only Steve had trusted him.
“Yes. I talk to her all the time. We listen to music. I got her toys. I make her touch things, too. Safe things, with different textures. We have a book made with different fabrics.”
The sight of Tony’s chest triggers a spike of guilt in Steve’s stomach, and he lowers his gaze to the floor. But he never finds revulsion in himself, none at all.
Tony steps out of his plane in Milan and is immediately hit by the smell. A smell that is distinctively, unapologetically,
They stay close and still for a long time, until Steve’s cock softens and slips out of Tony allowing Steve’s come to trickle out.
Steve is lying on his bed, on top of the covers, naked except for his underwear. He’s turned towards the window. In front of him, chest to back, there’s Sarah, fast asleep like her father, wearing only her diaper and one sock. The other one, Tony can see, is clutched in her tiny fist.
He’s lost a few pounds. Steve doesn’t even want to imagine how bad his eating habits must have gotten while he was in hiding—
“I never stopped loving you. Never, not even for a second. Even when you didn’t want me. I still loved you. I was still yours.”
“There’s a red one with little puppies too. We could get matching ties for the next Avengers press conference. ‘Hey, United Nations, we’re reassembling the Avengers and our ties totally make us look like serious, trustworthy individuals who can protect the planet from evil aliens’, how’s that sound?”
She came downstairs for dinner a few minutes late, sat down at the table, looked her father in the eye and said, “Va bene, babbo, lo sposo.”
Tony’s smell has changed. It’s only normal. Maybe he smells like the widows, like a nest that’s half-full and half-empty at the same time, and the tang of sadness never quite leaves him.
Tony’s body pressing into Steve’s, his hands gripping Steve’s hair in fistfuls, guiding his head into place.
Steve’s mind screams at him, and he wants to grab Tony’s hip, see exactly how small it looks in his big hand, he wants to press his face into Tony’s stomach and breathe him in, deep, keep him in his lungs for as long as possible.
The night is quiet, it smells like summer and grass. The moon colors everything in a soft white-blue hue, and it reminds Steve of Tony’s arc reactor.
“It’s not the first one. She asked me out a couple weeks ago, we’ve been working together a lot and... I haven’t heard from you in months, Steve. Not even a text.”
“I love you—” he sobs, and Steve lifts his arms to hug him, keep him close, whisper in his ear that he loves him too and that he’s never gonna leave him, no matter what.
Then, that his entire body is in excruciating pain, but—and also because—he can feel his legs again.
He wonders where Tony is, if he’ll come back, what he’s doing right now, what Steve will tell Stella in the morning. He worries and worries about Tony, until his throat is raw, his eyes burn, and he’s too tired and heartbroken to even think—because Tony left, and Steve is lost without him by his side.
Steve extracts something from the pocket of his jacket. It’s a small box, blue velvet. He holds it out for Tony to take.
Steve feels it into his bones, deep inside him, in his blood, in his brain. His muscles spasm and ache with it, his throat burns when he breathes.
“I lo–,” Tony pauses, grimaces, sighs, takes a couple of deep breaths, steadies himself, “I love you too. As in, I am in love with you. Too.”
When Tony wakes up on Saturday morning, the sun is barely up, and he’s not entirely sure that he can feel his legs. He’s lying on his stomach with a giant arm slumped across his shoulders, a tuft of blond hair brushing at his cheek, the covers soft and warm against his back.
“It’s not pain, exactly. It’s more a soreness and... you’re aware there’s something in you that doesn’t quite fit with the rest. And it’s there all the time.”
“If you don’t close your mouth you’ll end up eating a mosquito,” Bucky says, and Tony snorts. “Listen to me,” Bucky continues, “don’t make a big fuss out of this, okay? I know how you can get. I’m fine. Tons of people are looking after me. I’m gonna be okay.”
Sometimes, after a few hours, when he can put enough distance between one of the Bad Mornings and his feelings, he manages to find some pity for himself, some scraps of mercy. He thinks that his relationship with Tony was full of love, of trust, of understanding and support, but it was also full of amazing sex. So it’s only normal that Steve would miss all of it, every aspect of it. With how much they enjoyed each other’s bodies, it would almost be unfair for Steve not to miss that part of what he had built with Tony.
Steve seems to suddenly remember something, walks back inside and takes something out of his pocket. He places the drawing on the coffee table in front of Tony.
“Yeah, yeah, he’s doing fine. Actually I should thank you, I built him a pair of exoskeletal leg braces and based half the work on your research, I—”
And death came, and took Tony with her, and left Steve here, rotting away, missing half of his soul.
Instead, Tony reaches out to hold Steve’s face between his hands, attentive, almost tender. He shifts closer and inspects the wound on Steve’s forehead. Steve’s eyes, now free, wander downwards and linger there. Tony’s arms are still one of the most beautiful things about his body, and Steve remembers the hours spent in the workshop observing him work on the armor before they got together; he remembers how he’d stare at the veins under Tony’s skin, how the sweat would make him glisten like a piece of candy. He remembers Tony asking him for help moving something too heavy or lifting a car for him, and how Steve would seize those occasions to show off a bit, because the serum was useful for more than one thing, and Steve was still an unmated Alpha back then, bound to get silly around a handsome Omega like Tony.
So in the end, it’s just weird. But Steve decided long ago that he isn’t going to say anything about it, that he’s going to respect Tony’s boundaries and not ask about any of them. Not about the no kissing rule, not why he avoids looking at Steve, why he keeps as silent as possible, why there’s some unspoken law that forbids them both to talk about all of this. And Steve could, really, he could simply go
Steve is in love with Tony. Completely and impossibly so. He is so far gone on Tony that words can’t really describe it. Sometimes he feels like his heart is going to burst because of how much he would give up for Tony, to make him happy and to keep him safe. Anything, everything, for him. And he knows that Tony feels the same about him. And finally, after years of uncertainty, of pining, of desperation, of failed attempts at moving on, of convincing himself it was never going to happen, it has happened.
They don’t go straight back home. Tony insists Steve just drives around the countryside for a while, and Steve humors him.
“Yeah. I lied,” Tony says, shrugging, laughing at his own joke. “Stop ruining all the fun. Besides, you’re itching to go there. I know you.”
When Steve is ready—or as ready as he can stand to be—he guides Tony up on his feet and forces him to open his eyes with a hand on his face.
“He said he needs time to think about it. Which is fair. He also said that he’s gonna be busy with Bucky for the next few weeks, so... It looks like your bestie is hell-bent on ruining my life.”
He fucks into him, over and over, rolling his hips instead of just pushing, face hidden in the crook of Steve’s neck, a hand caressing his scalp.
“So that’s why you’re dumping the responsibility on me? As if I don’t have enough on my plate already! Do I look like I’m mentally adjusted to you, Steve?”
Tony must have his armor in one of his satellites, and the suit can latch onto the bracelets’ location to reach him. But it’s hard to think Tony will need to be Iron Man here. Would Steve have brought his shield, if he still had it? He doesn’t know. The idea of being Captain America ever again has felt unreal since Siberia. It feels impossible here, now.
He has no time to think that the little human growing inside him is Steve’s too. For a bit, Tony only thinks about them as
An hour later, some of the pain has subsided and Steve is almost dozing off, but two men enter the room to take Tony away.
Tony is hard now, and although his erection isn’t complete, it isn’t any worse than last night. That’s a good sign. Steve gathers saliva in his mouth, he licks thoroughly at the corner of his lips so the skin there isn’t dry and unpleasant for Tony, then he guides Tony into his mouth, sucking him down like it’s the best thing in the world and— it is.
Tony opens his eyes and looks at Steve, and Steve looks down at him while he fucks him slow and languorous, just by rolling his hips, without putting his thighs nor his knees into the motion at all. Tony takes Steve’s head into his hands, caresses the sides of his neck, his thumbs stroking Steve’s cheeks, still wet with Tony’s slick.
“I swear I didn’t want to do this to you. I had no idea. I only wanted to shut down the suit, make you stop... I don’t know why I didn’t think—”
Steve comes inside of Tony twice more. When he slips out, he rests his head on Tony’s stomach for a whole ten minutes, in silence, until he breathes normally again. He turns to look up, and—
Steve arrives early on purpose. MJ sends him down to Tony’s lab, so he doesn’t get in the way of the catering people still setting up the buffet.
Steve, opening the door just a bit. A sharp intake of air. An unplanned moment of hesitation. “The… the towels are in the sink cabinet,” he says, quiet.
Steve bends to kiss Tony’s cheek, mouth soft and wet and open, hungry for Tony’s skin. Tony lets him, but soon Steve stops abruptly with the realization of how forward his gesture is.
There’s a bashful smile on Steve’s face now, his cheeks are very pink. “I did. And it was great, and I won’t allow you to take it away from me.”
“Please,” Steve says, begging, and Tony doesn’t get it, he doesn't need to beg. He’s gonna have him. “Please don’t do it,” he continues, and something shatters behind his eyes, but his voice is surprisingly steady now. “If you care about me at all, don’t do it, Tony. I’ll do anything you want, you’ll never see me again if that’s your wish, but please. Don’t destroy me like this.” He squeezes his eyes shut. “Don’t do this to me.”
When Steve feels like Tony can’t take much more of this, he bottoms out again, abruptly, unexpectedly. Tony gasps from deep in his chest, lifts his head from the pillow and kisses Steve, then tries to breathe. Steve doesn’t stop fucking him, doesn’t slow down. He’s close and can’t keep this up for much longer, so he goes at it fast, hard, deep.
Steve doesn’t get it. Maybe it’s the summer, the general lack of air conditioning. Or rather, Steve hopes so. He hopes that whatever it is it has nothing to do with the way Tony’s arm shakes and his chest hurts every time he gets angry.
Steve gets up to strain the tortellini. Tony holds out the pan with the cooking cream, and they transfer the tortellini in it. He mixes them carefully, then adds the chopped Bronte pistachios.
Steve’s heart hammers in his chest. Blood rushes through him, pounding in his ears, and he can’t see anything but Tony’s lips.
He hears Steve come down the stairs before he sees him appear from behind the wall. His hair is tousled up, and the creases from the pillows are just disappearing from his cheeks. He’s still wearing the clothes he slept in.
Steve lies down on his side of the bed, settles under his blanket while Tony can barely bear the weight of the cotton sheets on his skin.
“Did you really want to kill me?” Tony asks, and he tries to be as gentle as Steve in his cruelty, but he can’t pull it off.
But why doesn’t he want to kiss Steve? That still doesn’t add up. It makes no sense. It’s unlikely that it’s a germ thing, Tony has put his tongue inside Steve’s
He hopes Bruce can reach Steve, somehow. He hopes Pepper is okay, while she pretends to be planning their non-existent wedding, that started as a way to mislead the press about Spider-Man joining the Avengers and then got out of their hands when the stock market gained 8 points in one day. The things you do for your company.
, Tony’s taking off his underwear, Tony’s smiling at him and cupping his face, and Tony’s naked and beautiful and he smells so good and Steve wants to disappear inside him, explode like the spark in his eyes—he wants to become one of Tony’s smiles, he wants to become his voice, his scent, his skin.
Steve is still kneeling on the ground, he’s confused, trying to buy some time but… it’s done. It’s over.
“After Tony was born… Maria would say in her letters that he didn’t care about the boy. Tony was a bright kid, but he was also sensitive and kind, and those weren’t qualities his father appreciated.”
“Now that I know, I can hear the reactor. How could I not… How did you hide it, Tony? With the undershirts? I think I saw one once.”
“Yeah, the stones. Someone wants them, because together those stones can summon an unimaginable power. We need to be prepared. We need to work together. We can’t afford to leave this planet without defenses. I couldn’t bear the thought... that I knew... and didn’t do... didn’t do enough.”
Steve smiles, tipping his body to the side and resting his forehead on Tony’s shoulder, playful. “That’s exactly what I’m saying.”
Then Tony ended up in a coma. Then the man forced Tony awake, and Tony knew, immediately, that the person in front of him wasn’t Steve.
, and his legs jerk with all the things he’s feeling; he can’t control them. Steve keeps them still with his own, growls his in his ear to coerce him into submission, and pounds into him again and again.
“Not far. Just… here,” he says, while they walk past the bridge and the bushes on the shore. They can’t see the agriturismo from here, and Steve assumes they can’t be seen as well. The woods protect them from the road.
He sits down on the rocky ground, and Tony follows him. He sees Steve look curiously at the little stream right in front of them and hesitate for a moment. Then, Steve shifts and reaches out with his hand, dips his fingers into the water.
God, Tony smells like heaven. Steve wants to lick him, into him, he wants to feel his slick on his ton—
Steve sets the table for everyone and places his napkin, with the blue ring, next to Tony’s golden one.
Steve slides down the bed and lies between Tony’s legs. He sucks at Tony’s inner thigh, mouths at his perineum. He presses a slick finger into Tony’s body, works at the sensitive muscles there, carefully, he doesn’t want to hurt Tony at all. Steve strokes Tony up and down a couple of times with his other hand, and he’s glad to notice that his erection is harder than usual.
Steve leads him into the bathroom, and shuts the door. Tony keeps his arm close to his chest, holds the ice pack to his shoulder. Steve moves towards the bathtub, starts to fill it with water, so that Tony knows what he has in mind, and can say something if he doesn’t want to do this.
Tony doesn’t say anything. It’s up to Steve to say something, and he knows what Tony must expect from him right now, while he feels like this.
Steve gets to work. There’s fresh bread in the pantry, prosciutto crudo in the fridge. It’ll give Tony energy.
Steve lets his t-shirt go. “Sorry,” he says, and tries to smooth it out. He rests his hands on Tony’s shoulders and looks at him for an endless moment. “Alright,” he says in the end, and closes the bathroom door behind himself.
His actions implied it, at least. And maybe it’s not entirely true, because part of him honestly believes they need supervision and a system of accountability. But he cared about Steve more than he ever cared about the Accords.
friends, Tony. I don’t know why I said we weren’t. Maybe it’s because we aren’t right now, and I keep mixing up past and present.”
, there it is, Tony is tensing up and coming, eyes shut and teeth gritted, deep inside Steve. Tony buries his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and Steve caresses his back through the aftershock of his orgasm, murmurs
He takes a moment to anticipate the scrape of the metal on his skin, and begins shaving, painstakingly meticulous.
He leaves Bucky and Steve alone, because he has a hunch that Steve needs a friend that isn’t Tony right now. He starts making dinner, and he hears them laugh from the kitchen. He expects the spike of jealousy to poke him, but it never comes.
Steve pulls his fingers out, dragging a whine out of Tony. Steve wipes his hand on his t-shirt, then uncaps the bottle of lube to slick himself up.
, he lived sixty years alone for this, everything he did in his life was rightful and good because it ended with this— all his fucked up and stupid choices suddenly make perfect sense because they led him to
He hears Tony sigh and walk across the room. With a gentleness Steve doesn’t deserve, Tony takes his wrists, makes him turn around and spread his legs. He curls up in Steve’s lap.
He separates them, breaking the stalk with beautifully precise movements. He eats one then, chews it slowly, spits the pit onto his hand and throws it on the ground, lets nature swallow its own fruits.
He doesn’t know what to make of it. If Tony wants to set some boundaries, if there are things he doesn’t like to do then Steve is more than willing to respect his wishes, but somehow he doesn’t think that’s the problem here. He can’t help but feeling rejected, in some way he doesn’t really understand, by Tony, and at the thought a small tear slips past his control and down his cheek.
He starts losing weight, which is the worst thing that could happen to someone in his situation. He has to be fed through an IV for about a month.
Bucky and Natasha wait with him for Steve to wake up. It makes sense since they don’t know how violent Steve will be when he’s conscious again, but it makes Tony uneasy. There’s a voice in his heart telling him that this should stay between him and Steve.
Steve comes around, the fog slowly clearing from his head, and he sits up, pulls out of Tony inch by inch. He looks at Tony’s lap and his dick isn’t as soft as before, but it’s not even half-hard. Tony looks down at himself.
“I just need to assemble the pieces. I told them it still needs work and they bought it… God, they’re like children.”
, and he’s taken aback when Steve just does as he’s told without hesitation. He stares at Tony from his end of the couch, curious.
He tilts his head towards Tony, and Tony looks up at his face, then rests his cheek against Steve’s bicep. “He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine,” he says.
“The things you were thinking earlier… about yourself… I’m sorry, Tony, I can’t shake them off so quickly, I—”
The crack of the thunder wakes him up. It’s so violent Steve almost fears the sky is going to split open and fall onto him.
across the street holding a plastic bag. He sits down next to Steve, rummages in the bag for a moment, then hands Steve a bundle of paper tissues.
“You know,” Steve says when they’re almost finished eating, “sometimes I feel like… like they just throw us away when they’re done with us. And it doesn’t matter if we don’t know why we should get up in the morning anymore.”
He’s thought about it, once or twice. About getting Doom to send him back in time. Save Tony. Take that bullet for him, if necessary, bleed out on those steps for him. But Doom was Osborn’s prisoner, and the same old problem presented itself: they couldn’t get into the damn prisons.
“She always wore lipstick. She never left the house without, and even when she stayed home she’d wear it often. She’d kiss my cheek and leave a trace. Sometimes I’d be annoyed by that. Now I’d give anything for...” Tony looks down and presses his lips together in a thin line, sets his jaw. “I don’t know why I’m fixating on such a stupid detail, but the book mentions the first time my mom wore lipstick in her life and I... I can’t—”
Steve isn’t a good actor. As painfully ironic as it sounds Steve really isn’t a good liar. But he manages to keep his face very neutral after Tony speaks, the clench in his jaw is almost unnoticeable, the sigh he lets out only a fraction louder than usual.
“I don’t know what to do with him. I’m here for a very personal matter, I... I don’t want him here. I don’t want him.”
She teaches Tony how to feed Maria in a way that keeps her from swallowing too much air, and Tony feels like the worst father ever.
Steve gathers what’s in the clothes hamper with everything around the room that doesn’t meet his standards of cleanliness, and starts a washing machine cycle. With how warm it is outside it’s unlikely that anything they hang to the clotheslines in the backyard won’t be dry by the time they have to leave.
), but at a slightly slower pace than what is normal for any other human. And Tony has been sixty for a few months already. Steve brought him a cupcake with red and gold icing.
Steve breathes through his frustration. “That’s someone else talking, and you know that,” he says, trying not to sound accusatory, but as if he’s just stating a fact. Which he is.
“The only good thing that came out of this mess, maybe, is self-awareness regarding the state of the Avengers. The way we let the team be torn apart over and over… it shouldn’t be like that,” Steve says.
He wants Steve’s knot, right now. It doesn’t matter if they’re standing up and uncomfortable, he just needs it, he’s losing his mind.
The smile on Tony’s face vanishes. He closes his eyes for a moment, as though to gather his strength, and he pouts, overwhelmingly sad.
The bruise on his chest is massive. It takes up half his body for weeks. It aches, but it’s nothing compared to what Steve’s absence does to him.
“I really am sorry about before. I guess I have an image of you in my head and it doesn’t always align with reality. I’ve got no right to be jealous or act like I did. I wouldn’t have that right in any case. I’m sorry.”
Inside the cave, instead, the temperature is just right. Maybe it’s a bit too humid, but Tony has his suit on, so it doesn’t bother him all that much.
He traces the shape of Nat’s leg with his fingertip, the lines that make up Bucky’s smile. The figures feel so alive that Tony expects them to actually start moving, but they never do.
“Said the billionaire to the king.” T'Challa gets out of the car. “Good luck, my friend,” he says while holding the door open, and Tony looks at him. He doesn’t know if they’re friends, but the word makes the corner of his mouth tug upwards.
He looks at Tony’s body, and it’s a map of all the ways Steve has hurt him. A testament to Steve’s failures, proof of Tony’s fragility, yes, but also and most importantly of his resilience, because he may be scarred and bruised and hurt, but he’s still here.
And what’s one more partner for Tony, in the grand scheme of things, after all? He’s not saving himself up for anyone; that train left the station a
“Okay. That’s good. We’re in Vermont now. They tried to get Steve’s blood. Listen, Carol, there’s been an explosion, and... I’d rather S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t look too much into it.”
Steve stares at him, awed, wide-eyed, mouth hanging open. “Okay,” he whispers, and has to look down.
About a couple of yards in front of them, on a little hill, there’s a monastery. On the right, not much further away, there are the ruins of a medieval church. A side trail starting out from the one they came from leads straight to it. It really looks beautiful against the blue sky. There’s not a cloud in sight.
He slumps onto Tony, and they slowly sink down to the floor, gasping. They stay like that for a few minutes, catching their breath, and Steve buries his nose into Tony’s hair from on top of him, inhales as deep as he can.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he hears Tony saying, Tony, who is his now. He’s Steve’s, he loves him back. “I’m sorry, in the end I did something just as bad, I guess. I lied and I shouldn’t have. God, I’m an asshole.”
Tony nods, and Steve lets him get up and walk inside, following him close. There’s an awkward moment in the bedroom, but before Steve can do anything Tony takes his pajamas and hides in the bathroom to change.
“These are handmade, you know,” Tony says, suddenly. He’s clutching his unused fork in his hand, looking down at it like nothing in the world could possibly be more interesting.
He wishes he knew how to coax Tony out of this mild stupor, how to make his anxiety better, how to guide him back in control of his environment instead of simply doing it for him. In the end, having reached no useful conclusion, Steve opts for taking one of the fastest showers of his life, so he doesn’t leave Tony alone for too long.
Tony opens and closes his mouth a few times, but nothing comes out. Steve gives him time to adjust. It’s beautiful, watching his face while he conquers this.
The fight is slightly more difficult, but Steve has the shield and a padded suit, and Tony has his armor. The man is wearing cotton.
His cock is now heavy in his underwear, so hard it hurts. He can’t stand the clothes on his skin anymore, and he tries to strip, but his hands are clumsy and ungainly, clammy, and he can’t grab the fabric. His strength is gone.
However, they decide to forgo shower sex. No one likes knotting with the added risk of slipping on wet tiles. When they fall back into bed their hair is still dripping, but they don’t have time to even notice.
“Would you kiss me?” he asks, because it’s the last chance he has. Steve’s expression falters a little, but he bends his head and kisses him slowly, stopping his thrusts to dedicate himself to it fully, with no other distractions. He lingers with his lips on Tony’s and resumes fucking into him at a languorous pace, hips rolling between Tony’s open thighs, stomach pressing down on Tony’s hard dick, now free through the tatters of his pants.
Steve has Maria in his arms. One arm, actually. His big bicep supports her head just right. He’s pointing at the buildings outside through the glass wall and talking to her, explaining to her what this or that skyscraper is, what’s inside of them.
“Yeah. These aren’t places of worship. I mean, that’s their use, but it’s not why they were built. They were built to honor God. And God sees all the details. Even when people can’t.”
And in the blink of an eye it was a year or so later, and they spent three days together in the deserted compound, right before Steve had to leave for Lagos—the other Avengers already there for recon, Vision out to explore New York on his own, Steve staying back for a couple more days so he could attend the VA charity gala.
She spent that day in her room, in the big house the Carbonells owned in Southampton, and no one disturbed her at all.
“Where.” If Steve were a better man, he would’ve made it sound like an actual question. As far as he’s concerned, the fact that he doesn’t pull at his cuffs is already a win.
And it’s not like he’d masturbate, even if he were able to. Keeping quiet would be quite the feat for Tony, but Steve would hear him in any case. The slap of skin against skin, the bracelet scraping over his right wrist. Steve could smell it, no matter how quickly Tony cleaned up the tiles.
“You did what you thought was right. You changed when you felt you should. With the whole world watching, judging. That takes guts, Tony.”
It’s warm, but not wet enough. Steve stays there, without moving, waits for Tony to gather saliva into his mouth. When he’s ready, Steve buries his hand into Tony’s hair, looks at his fingers disappear between the silver strands. He grabs at it, yanks, makes Tony groan deep in his throat. He starts fucking Tony’s face slowly, but mercilessly.
“Yes. It’s also still technically mine, believe it or not. Ever heard of Carbonell? Women’s clothes.”
Tony focuses on the point where Steve’s body meets his, and doesn’t feel like it’s hurting at all. He feels completely open, a bit sore, maybe, but there’s no unpleasant friction. Steve must have added lots of lube while Tony was sleeping, and with all that come inside him, Tony feels wet, slick, loose.
“Hydra, yeah. Came across us by complete chance, the damn fuckers. They’re small, though, with very little resources. They’re rebuilding, looks like. Cut off one head, you know how it goes.”
, he was so sure that this time, this time they wouldn’t be caught unprepared, that of course this time they’d be on the same side, but…
He doesn’t say what, and it’s a long time before he calms down enough to stop crying and fall asleep.
He doesn’t want to think about his own trust for Steve, buried under Siberian ice, with so many other pieces of his life.
I didn’t even plan it. Saw a door left open, tried to make a run for it. Forgot I’m not as fast as I used to be. I slipped over the icy ground.
Steve is visibly reassured by Tony’s words, he takes in big gulps of air, opens his eyes slowly, he’s trying to calm down. Tony keeps him close to his chest.
He thinks about the caves he keeps dreaming about, how alone he feels there without Steve, how strong the need to find him is.
Tony wakes up and rubs at his eyes, yawns. Steve is there, sitting on the bed next to him, his pillow trapped between his back and the headboard, his socked feet still under the blanket. He’s drawing.
“Tony, Tony... slow down. It’s okay.” Steve rests his hand on Tony’s knee, draws circles over the bones with his thumb, and Tony goes quiet and nods, and gets it all under control.
“Don’t,” Steve snaps, lifting a hand to stop Tony from saying more. He breathes then, deep, closes his eyes and drops his hand. He softens his voice. “At least don’t mock me for it. Please.”
“I keep dreaming…” he says, between a sob and the other, “I keep dreaming that the only way we can solve this is if we… if we… if I...”
Nothing works with Steve. He can’t be nudged into it, because it has to be Tony to take that step. And Tony gets it, really, he does. It can’t be Steve. As much as they’re trying to let the past go, what the man did to Tony casts a long shadow on their present.
“I know,” Steve says while he comes and his knot swells, locking his semen inside Tony. He kisses Tony again and then hides his face into Tony’s neck, breathing in his Omega pheromones as if he could live off of those alone. “I know.”
Silence fills the space between them for a while, then Tony says, “We should pick some fruit. Stella told me most of it goes to waste these days. Laura used to take care of it. I’m thinking of sending someone to do it for her.”
Tony feels like he’s never felt before. Like everything is louder, brighter, warmer, more defined. As though he just put on glasses and suddenly he can see the leaves on the trees again, instead of a confusing smudge of green.
“You really think so? I don’t. I think we’d keep each other on our toes. I’d tell you when you isolate yourself and stop accepting people’s help, you’d tell me when I start making decisions based on anger and impatience. We wouldn’t be as self-destructive if we could rely on each other. We’d consider more variables, more point of views. We’d lead better. We’d fight better.”
He looks beautiful in the warm light that pours into the bathroom from the window, against the turquoise tiles. The late-afternoon sunshine sparkles in his eyes, its yellow hue blending with the cold, white-blue beam of the reactor.
“So boring that… your brain will leak out of your ears if you stay!” Tony says, tickling Sarah’s belly and making her laugh.
It all happens in a handful of seconds, Tony thinks: Steve finds the lube, squeezes the gel directly into Tony’s cleft, pushes it into him and scissors his fingers just to be sure Tony is still open enough, he pulls back, shifts into position, and sinks in.
It’s Tony. He doesn’t look nervous, not exactly, but he’s usually more controlled than this. He looks like he hasn’t slept in a couple of days, which isn’t much for Tony’s standards, but his eyes are red, his head looks too heavy for his shoulders. He’s wearing a suit, one of Steve’s favorites, a light grey Tom Ford three-piece with two buttons, a white Yves Saint Laurent shirt underneath, the dark red Brunello Cucinelli silk tie, custom italian leather shoes. And really, the fact that Steve can be this accurate about Tony’s clothes…
Steve braces himself on the bed, his hand right next Tony’s head. Tony grabs his wrist and squeezes, and Steve fucks into him faster, and harder, and as rough and careful as he can be at the same time.
Steve’s thrusts become irregular in a smooth progression. He slams his hips hard against Tony’s ass, fucking him into the mat on the floor, a hand to hold himself up and the other around the back of Tony’s neck, pressing him down, keeping him still. Tony tries to squash down the idea before it’s even born in his mind; he tries to resist the temptation, but he’s always liked to play with fire more than it was advisable, and if Steve gets to play his little game, then Tony is gonna get his fix too, risk be damned. It’s not like this isn’t fucked up beyond belief already, what’s a bit more gonna change? So he tries to get up, propping himself on his elbow and lifting his chest, as though he wants to change position, decide. He’s successful for a single second, then Steve mutters, “Down,” and pushes him back against the floor, harder than before, hand moving to the space between Tony’s shoulder blades. Tony waits until Steve releases him to try again. He lasts more this time, Steve probably so stunned by the challenge that his reflexes are a fraction slower than the first round. Again a hand at the center of Tony’s back, a growled “Enough,” that makes Tony huff out a laugh, then Steve’s hand sliding up again, resting at the nape of Tony’s neck, Steve’s fingers in his hair.
And then, the last thing he allows himself to notice, there’s his left leg. Broken. Now that he’s paying attention to it, he realizes that it hurts more than it should. It must be at least a few hours old, and the serum has kicked in, sure, but it feels like it’s not working as fast as it should.
“Not asking. I know you won’t. I’m not even earning it because I keep... I’m just saying. I dream about it. Can I, can I dream about it? Can I imagine it? Just, just sometimes.”
It’s a whirlwind. They’re undone by it, piece by piece, until there’s only a darkness they can sink into together, and it seems welcoming and inviting—anything to stop feeling like this, to stop feeling heartbroken and guilty all at once, to make Steve stop feeling like that too.
“Open up,” he says, for the sake of watching Tony obey with no hesitation, and Tony sucks on Steve’s fingers and tastes himself and... yes. He tastes unmistakably like Omega in heat.
Tony makes a turn so they can walk through Ponte Vecchio to get back to the car, and if his surprised gasp is anything to go by, Steve didn’t know the bridge is full of jewelry shops.
Tony lowers his head back on Steve’s thighs, JARVIS plays the movie again. Tony can feel Steve’s fingers caressing his scalp.
“Not at all. This is so… god, I don’t even know. It’s flattering, and respectful. Poetic. I love it.”
But they never gave it a name. They never admitted it to anyone, least of all to each other. It was just something that happened, lasted for a few months, sometimes even a year, and then—
That seems to infuse Tony with renewed energy. He gets up and buttons up his shirt, tucks it into his jeans. He puts his shoes on and goes to the bathroom. He washes his face, and then he just… stops.
“Not what I asked.” Steve is careful about not pushing the subject too much if Tony doesn’t want to talk about it. He twirls his fork in his hand and attacks the piece of pie Tony put in front of him.
Just alien weapons. Basically all the Avengers have been doing after killing Thanos last year: find the alien weapons, dispose of them safely.
Tony touches him. He feels the anticipation run over Steve’s skin, his fear that the touch will be unwelcome to Tony even though it’s Tony who is initiating it.
“Was it about the thing they call Civil War? But like, of the Avengers? When you guys disagreed and Uncle Rhodey got hurt in his back? We talked about it in the Little Lawyers Club.”
They say goodbye after that, affectionately, and with more promises to call each other, text, meet. Steve watches the man—
“No,” Tony says, and Steve closes his eyes so he doesn’t hear it, but that’s not how it works. “No. I’ll tell you tomorrow. I need to be sure. It’s important.”
“Fight each other, you mean. Which we already do,” Tony says, and he’s not whispering anymore. He lifts his head, too, and Steve doesn’t push him back down. His hand falls to his own lap, still warm from the contact with Tony’s skin.
A metal capsule lands close to them, and Tony opens it. There’s a first aid kit inside, and clothes, and boots that Steve can’t wear because his ankles are mangled with multiple compound fractures that are bleeding but not hurting because he can’t feel anything from his groin down.
Tony wakes up to Steve caressing his stomach with his thumb, breaking the surface of the water over and over.
“I hope it doesn’t, but we could think of something else. If we don’t lie to each other and assume the worst—”
“I know, I know, I… I don’t know. I’m nervous, I guess. A bit scared. Mostly, just nostalgic. I miss her. Do you ever miss your mom?”
“You’re a superhero, you can save yourself,” he says looking at Tony with a little smirk. Then, “Is it raining?”
“Yes! The ties! They’re beautiful and I want to get married to all of them!” His eyes dance from one shelf to the other, all those incredible colors... “Oh my god, I love that one!” he says, and Steve comes closer to see which tie Tony is pointing at. “The blue one with the little kitties! I want it!”
Steve’s hand would slowly travel from Tony’s hip to his neck, and he would place it against Tony’s throat just like he did yesterday night, in bed. The thumb on one side, the rest of his fingers on the other. He would apply some pressure, more than Tony expects, but not enough to cut off his air.
Tony looks at him and presses the button to make the doors close. Pity he doesn’t have an actual door to slam in his face.
“Tony, concentrate on your breathing. Follow me, let’s breathe together, slowly, slowly,” Steve says, and starts inhaling deeply through his nose and exhaling through his mouth, and despite the fact that he can’t still keep his eyes open for more than a few seconds at a time, Tony does as instructed, and calms down a bit. “There you go, you’re doing great. That’s really good, Tony, really good.”
All these sensations, all these inputs, pile up into Steve’s mind, and it feels as though their weight presses the play button of reality again. It’s been on pause for so long that at first Steve doesn’t understand what it is, this thing he’s feeling.
Tony stirs on the bed next to Steve. The room is dark, it’s the middle of the night. Steve feels restless, as if he needs to— as if he needs to be inside Tony, again, and it’s just.
He hangs up while a huge smile plays on his face. It’s great to have heard from her, to have a friend he can talk with about Tony that wasn’t too directly involved in… in all that mess.
The sky is still gray. The sun seems to struggle to come out from behind the clouds. Steve wouldn’t blame it if it didn’t want to rise at all, today.
“That’s… that’s fine,” Tony mumbles, feeling like he didn’t study his part for this scene, so he has no idea what to say.
A couple of weeks in bed and I’m almost as good as new. I’m still not stronger than I look, nor faster, but the cosmic joke of the day is that the guy who gets regularly gangraped wins his healing factor back, without the rest of his superhuman abilities that could help him break out of captivity.
He stops after a few thrusts, pulls out, fixes his clothes. He looks at me like I’m the half-eaten carcass of an animal well past the point of putrefaction.
What happens next feels like a bucket of ice water. Tony gasps, like he’s being choked, pulls out of Steve suddenly, without controlling his movements (and,
The floor is hard underneath Steve’s back. Hard and cold and not exactly spotlessly clean and Steve doesn’t want to be anywhere else.
Tony looks into his pleading eyes, and for a moment he thinks he doesn’t get it, why is it such a big deal? But then he remembers how much he hates it when everyone calls him
His slick fingers, clumsy and indelicate and harsh (perfect. So, so perfect), making their way inside Tony, pressing into him from behind. The cold desktop under Tony’s hands, the hem of the table digging into Tony’s lower abdomen while Steve pushed him against it.
He feels like he doesn’t have enough skin to cover all of himself. Every inch of it feels as if it has been scrubbed raw, like it’s burning—it prickles unpleasantly, it itches.
Nothing. It leaves him as quick as it started. It’s so fast that he doesn’t even really have the time to be truly disappointed about it, or lament the loss of his barely-there erection.
Giving birth is relatively easy. It doesn’t hurt as much as he thought it would, or maybe there are things that hurt more in Tony’s life at the moment.
They soon move on from kisses to what can be done with hands and mouths. Steve doesn’t even ask about anything else.
The smirk turns into a laugh. A spark appears behind Tony’s eyes. He places the wrench on the table and gets up from his workbench to walk towards Steve. Slowly. One step at a time. “Wrong again,” he says.
The ice makes Tony hiss at first, but soon it starts giving him relief. Steve brings him an aspirin, and gets the sling from Tony’s duffle bag, as per Tony’s instructions.
“I’m… I’m not gonna force you, Tony. I… I don’t know why you think I’m the one who gets to decide these things. That’s you.”
He knocks on Steve’s door in the middle of the night. Steve wakes up, and Tony stands there, on the threshold, his body slicing the light coming from the hallway.
“Hey,” he says. “You should get a notebook,” he adds, and Tony notices that a couple of his papers fell to the ground. He crouches down to pick them up.
Steve hears Riri say something. He doesn’t know what; he’s not really listening. She leaves, though, so maybe she was excusing herself. Saying that she’d leave them alone to sort this out.
He looks tired, worn out, used up, and somehow still himself, somehow more similar than ever to that night when he climbed on Steve’s lap and kissed him and fucked him and made Steve think about being in love for the first time in ages.
Tony’s disappointed face, his rage, his hatred for Steve, for the way he manipulated him and hid the truth from him. But also Tony’s soft gaze after the Hulk revived him in New York, the way he asked Steve,
Tony walks in front of Steve, keeps his distance but he’s only a few feet away. His t-shirt is rumpled.
Sarah comes by to the workshop one day after school. Tony isn’t really looking at her; he’s reading through Pepper’s notes on the contract for a merger.
Every night Steve goes up to the penthouse and finds Tony already there. They cuddle on the couch for a while, Tony wrapped up in whatever is happening on his tablet, Steve engrossed in a book or a drawing. They drink hot chocolate or tea surrounded by the warm light of the fireplace, an old blanket covering Tony’s legs and his socked feet tucked in under Steve’s thigh.
And it’s that love, as unrequited and painful as it sometimes is (but also good. Also happy, also pure, also bright and warm and
“What you did today for that kid,” he says at some point, “it was good. You really are a good person, Tony.”
He has taken so much from Tony already that he won’t ask for anything else than what Tony is willing to give.
Steve is smiling, easy and soft, still completely naked in front of Tony, and Tony can’t help but huff a small laugh in reply and shake his head.
“Well. Yeah. Took me a while, but I found a way. Figured it couldn’t hurt, for him to have a friend there. Since you couldn’t be.”
“I don’t know. It’s easier for me. I’d be the middle-aged sleazebag who gets to fuck the peak of human perfection.”
He can’t breathe. He keeps trying, but there’s no air, it’s so cold and there’s no air, and the pain in his chest is so sharp and just please,
“Thanks. I developed this nanotechnology… the bracelets are connected to my neural synapses, so I can activate the suit by thinking specific code words. I can access different models too.”
I do heal, but not perfectly, and not as fast as before. Broken bones keep aching, scars remain impressed into my skin as reminders, bruises take days to disappear instead of hours. But they don’t know that.
God, how he hated Steve when he was young. Well, not Steve-Steve. Well, not hate-hate. He hated the Captain America that took so much space in his father’s heart that there was nothing left for Tony. He hated the certainty that he’d never be as good as Captain America, that he’d never be even half the man
“I hate doing that,” Steve murmurs, to himself more than to Tony, his voice vibrating as it goes back to normal. There’s still an echo of command in it, and Tony can feel it like the ridged skin of the scars in the middle of his chest. Like the burns on his fingertips. Like the shape of Steve’s bite embroidered on his shoulder.
He comes in Tony’s mouth and Tony comes in his at the same time, and Steve lets his throat work so he doesn’t waste a drop of what he’s given. But then he feels only air around himself while Tony slips out of him quietly, and all of a sudden hopelessness blossoms in the middle of Steve’s chest, and he almost thinks that he could cry.
, is a whole new level of hurt that he hadn’t considered or imagined. The rejection lodges itself between his ribs, making it hard to breathe.
Steve gestures for Tony to come into the room and Tony does, without saying anything, without really looking at Steve. He sits on the edge of Steve’s bed, fiddles with his tinted glasses in his hands for a few moments and then puts them in his pocket, sighs.
Tony closes his eyes, and Steve studies his face, because he doesn’t want the memory to take over Tony’s mind.
“Yeah, I– I don’t, I mean, I don’t have a strong preference, either way, it’s just that it– it can be– it can get too much for me so I–”
He hoped he’d sleep longer, but his shoulder is aching, bad. He should get up and put more ice on it, but right now, pain aside, he’s comfortable: it’s the only time of day when the temperature is acceptable to humans. The bed is soft and cool; Steve is asleep next to him and if he presses his ear to his chest he can hear his heart beating, steady and regular and strong and so unlike Tony’s own.
“What did I do wrong, Tony?” Steve hates the way his voice sounds with every single fiber of his being.
God, Mom was so much better than him. Her fingers weren’t as thick as Tony’s, or as rough. She played in such a refined way. She moved her whole body with the music.
“I know,” he says, turning to look at Steve. He looks back, sure of himself like he has never been this whole time. “I’ll deal with it. I want to know the stuff that didn’t make it to the books.”
When he finally looks at Tony, he finds him already staring, a strange, warm expression on his face, hooded eyes tired and puffy with lack of sleep. But there’s something else in them too, something that Steve almost wants to call joy. It’s serene, Tony’s gaze, and charming, bordering on seductive. Maybe that’s just Steve’s wishful thinking.
Tony twists around to hug him; he hides his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and breathes him in. He’s got sweatpants on, but he’s still shirtless, and Tony strokes his shoulders while Steve hugs him back and shakes against him.
Tony shrugs, and gives Steve what he sincerely hopes is an encouraging smile. “That’s not your fault, Steve. Don’t worry. These things happen, right?”
It had been the opposite of always, in the end. It had been barely a year. Then Tony attacked Harry Osborn, the President of the United States, loudly and publicly, and… and they killed him.
He rummages in a drawer for the bottle of lube he knows is there. God, no one has used it in so long. But he can’t think about that now, it doesn’t matter. It will hardly affect either of them.
Tony emits a pitiful whine, shudders, but not in a way that tells Steve he wants him to stop. Steve sucks delicately, lets saliva trickle down past his lips, bobs his head up and down and feels one of the most incredible things he has ever felt, possibly even better than coming inside Tony just now: he feels Tony’s dick become hard in his mouth.
He leans into Steve’s hand, still on his cheek, and reaches out to hug him, resting his face in the crook of Steve’s neck. He feels shaken, upset, wrong.
“No. I could use the company. Maybe even the help,” Tony says, and Steve’s back relaxes. “I wouldn’t mind a friend. If that’s… alright with you.”
“Where did you go?” he asks, and he tries so hard to keep his voice even, but he can’t quite pull it off.
Steve slams into him hard but faster, finally, thankfully, and Tony’s insides sing with it, and he wants to scream, he wants to cry, he wants to come. The rush it gives him, the pleasure, the fact that it’s Steve, the love he feels for him, good even if unrequited. Electricity crackles within him, below his navel, through his spine, the countdown on a bomb.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, gently, and he reaches out for Steve’s hand, then hesitates and retracts his arm, then reaches out again.
“Nothing, really, I just... I love this side of you. How eccentric you are, sometimes. I didn’t understand it at first, I thought you were just rich and spoiled, but... I like the way you dress and, I don’t know. I think you can totally pull off a tie with kitties.”
“I’m sorry if I made you feel like—” Steve starts crying again, his words garbled with tears, “Like I was choosing between you two… I wasn’t... I didn’t know what to do and I was scared and I just wanted you to stop, I didn’t want to hurt you, I didn’t, not hurt you, never, never, never again...”
It lasts only a second. Tony comes back to the surface immediately, wiping the water away from his face, opening his eyes and looking around himself, breathing through his mouth.
“I did,” he says, and Steve watches him swallow around the confession, too fast and natural not to leave him ashamed, afterwards. “But we had a bad fight before you were born, and I was angry at your dad for a very long time.”
But most of all, he saw this glint in Tony’s eyes during those three days they spent together, alone, at the Avengers compound. He saw it that night that Tony kissed him. That night when Tony pushed Steve to sit on the couch in his workshop and took what was his.
Tony starts laughing first, of course, loud and almost wheezing with it, but Steve follows suit pretty much immediately. Then, Tony starts coughing, and clutches at his shoulder.
No, no, he wouldn't do that. He wouldn’t. Steve knows his temperament, he knows his nature, he knows he’s not that kind of Alpha. He would never hurt Tony again, not willingly, but that’s the core of the matter: How can he be sure he’ll retain basic control over himself after this? How can he make predictions that would guarantee Tony’s safety? How can he, in good conscience, promise that they’ll both walk out of this unscathed when they’re so eager to play fast and loose with the ashes of their bond? He can’t; it’s too dangerous.
Silence stretches on between them, and Tony is panicking and scrambling to find something else to say, but Steve snorts, huffs a small laugh and—
He strips down to his boxers, kicks the rug away and sits down on the floor, the cold cotto tiles refreshing against the back of his thighs. He puts his mother’s necklace back in the drawer.
There’s nothing inside him, and Tony could swear all that emptiness is going to swallow him whole if he doesn’t fill it in the next second.
Steve finds a movie he wants to watch, and Tony fiddles with the remote to change the language for him, but he doesn’t really pay attention himself besides noticing that it’s
Steve turns his head away from the shirt pressed to his face. He opens his eyes to stare at the empty space at his side, and he releases the breath he was holding deep in his lungs. His heart slows down. His mind clears, but he keeps his lips parted so he can breathe through his mouth.
Tony exhales one more time, staring at the unfamiliar ceiling. His hot breath is visible in the cold air.
Time passes, even though Tony can’t keep track of it except for the amount of semen Steve releases into him (it’s getting less and less) and how often he does it (less and less, too).
Tony’s crying too now, and Steve doesn’t understand why. Tony should never cry, he should always be happy and safe and loved.
“It wasn’t his fault, I know that now,” Tony whispers against Steve’s skin. “But what they made him do, it’s not your fault either. You can... you can let this go, Steve.”
His mind drifts inevitably to Tony, to his body softened by the years, to the grace he effortlessly puts in every single movement, to how magnificent he looks in the Iron Man armor, to how amazing he is when he’s inventing something, to his shiny hair. Only Tony can make him feel like this. Only Tony can reduce him to this. The serum made Steve’s libido and stamina something unheard of, but Tony— the things Tony can do to him are just beyond reason.
Tony goes on. “I couldn’t let that happen without…” He sighs. “But I mean, there’s also a small possibility that this whole mess is just a result of the intersection between the space-time continuum and the multiverse, and we—”
The kiss ends, and Steve uses two of his fingers to force his way into Tony’s mouth—even though Tony isn’t really putting up any serious resistance, Steve isn’t at all kind about it. Tony closes his lips around Steve’s fingers, tight, as if they were his dick, lets saliva pool on his tongue and coats them with it.
It’s a rainy day. Big, dark clouds have been covering the sky since the early morning, the rain hasn’t let up for a moment, lightning and thunder chasing each other between the skyscrapers.
“No, I just... I was just thinking... you’re a good person too, Steve. I don’t... I’m still angry and—” Tony sighs, because this is unexpectedly hard to get out. “I’m still mad at you. But I don’t think that keeping that thing from me makes you a bad person. I don’t think you’re bad, and I don’t think you’re bad to me.”
“It makes me feel guilty. But it’s part of you. And I love all of you. Even the parts of yourself you love the least.”
“You think that in ten years I never, even once, thought about it? We always knew what our bond was doing to her, abandoned like that. How many people do you know that didn’t stay bonded after having a kid? Or that split without breaking the bond properly?”
“It doesn’t change the facts,” Tony replies, relentless, “she always tried to keep him away from me. Tried to get between our fights, tried to…” Tony dips his chin to his chest and moans, unable to describe it further. “When I had the chance to get out of there, go to school, I took it. I didn’t think that it meant leaving her alone with him.”
A white, blinding pain bursts in his chest. It doesn’t come in spikes or waves, no, its intensity is constant and cruel, there’s no respite, no relief, no mercy. It’s a war without a truce.
“Tell me now,” Steve says, begs, because he can’t wait a second more, he’s going to die if he has to wait a second more.
He circles his forefinger inside Tony, feels around his inside walls. The skin there is so delicate, so tender.
“Now I wanna see some powerful shots, one-two, one-two… Let’s take this from the top now, throw some kicks in between.”
“I should sell this story to some cheap tabloid with no compunction about defacing the reputation of a national icon.”
This is a special rut. He got that since the beginning. He’s never felt like this. The need, how much he craves Tony, the lust—they are unprecedented. Hell, he was about to die if he didn’t have Tony. To
Sarah moves to rub at her nose with the back of her hand. She doesn’t wake up, but Steve stirs and drags her closer to himself. His hand is so big that it covers all of Sarah’s front, chest to navel.
They wait it out, cuddled up on the couch, breathing each other in, discovering that something is shifting in their biology. The bond, freshly repaired, produces new hormones, and new hormones mean a new underlying scent that’s not Steve
He’s still wearing that cardigan of his, and now that Tony sees it under the harsh light of the sun, with Steve’s hair catching it and shining with gold, he recognizes it.
The room she prepared for Steve and Tony is at the end of the corridor. It’s tiny but luminous, with an ensuite bathroom and a small terrace. The furniture must be at least a century old. The bed is made, and there are fresh flowers on the dresser.
“My editor suggested I took them out from the English edition, because no one would understand them unless we added a translation. I did it reluctantly, I’ll be honest; they’re a relevant part of the story. Look.”
“Listen, I’m a big boy. Actually, I’m a grown ass man. I’ve sold weapons to backstabbing human garbage for a good portion of my life, much to my regret. I’ve got thick skin. I’m fine.”
She sounds so happy. He wants her to be this happy every day. To smell this good every day, to smell like she comes from something whole, from a bond that hasn’t been abandoned for years.
Tony emits a small sound of discomfort, and takes his hand away from underneath Steve’s, fast and twitching. He closes it into a loose fist and coughs into it, embarrassed.
“The suit has its own arc reactor. The one in my chest just makes sure my heart does its job—can function as backup, though, in an emergency. That’s better, you know. Safer.”
Tony works on his tablet for a while, but Steve seems to be content just staring into the distance, with nothing to occupy his mind except his own thoughts.
Steve kneels under Tony’s desk, tries to undo Tony’s pants but his fingers are shaking, sweating, he doesn’t know what he’s doing. Tony bats his hands away and Steve wants to complain, to beg, but he doesn’t need to, because Tony is grabbing Steve’s hair and shoving his dick into Steve’s mouth and finally,
The sketch is made with charcoal. It’s the cherry tree, but seen from a distance. Under it, two unrecognizable figures—one very tall, the other quite short—stand close, face to face. Maybe they’re kissing. Maybe they’re just pressing their foreheads together. Maybe one of them is whispering something into the other’s ear.
“Thank you,” Steve says, his voice thick with tears. He lifts his head to look at Tony and sure enough, his face is wet.
“Pretty sure it was a special team of Wakanda’s best experts in international law and cooperation, but sure, let’s say T'Challa.”
Tony is here for something personal. The necklace is probably connected to that. This whole thing, Steve is quite sure, is about Maria. Because she was Italian, he knows that much. It was in the files.
He sounds genuinely regretful, and Tony is happy to see Steve’s jaw set in displeasure and frustration for a moment. But that makes him feel disgusted with himself. It’s a bad thought. A really bad thought.
“Everything that’s happened, Tony, to me, to you—it made me think. Really think. About who I am. And what I really want. How I really want to spend my life and…”
“I wasn’t sure about telling you. Didn’t know if I should, what’d be the right time… I didn’t want you to think I was making it up so I’d look less awful. I still did it, Tony. There may be some redeeming factors, but what I did was wrong and I wanted you to make your decision without me trying to, you know… I sort of wished I could tell you after, one way or another… I don’t know.”
Maybe it’s just Steve’s fear fucking with his perception of things. Maybe the healing’s fine and he’s just worried.
But this one. This commercial. There’s a man and a woman, and they are both beautiful, unimaginably so, but the man...
He turns, and Steve is closer than Tony thought. He’s looking down at him in a curious way. A smile dances on his face.
By the time Steve’s done, there’s a gigantic plate of spaghetti with clams waiting for him. “Wow,” he says, and Tony smiles at him, gestures for him to sit.
“No, no, you’re right on time.” Tony shuffles in front of him, slowly takes one of Steve’s hands. His touch always feels electric, makes Steve hyper-aware of himself, of Tony, of their skin.
“Your mom was right, Tony,” Stella says, placing one of her frail hands over the arc reactor, and Tony doesn’t flinch away, because Stella may not be his mom, but her touch is a mother’s touch. She reaches into Tony’s t-shirt, and takes out the sun-shaped pendant. “A tiny sun burns brightly in you. Don’t let it fade away.”
Silence stretches between them for a while. Tony looks immersed in thought, and Steve lets him be. Then he turns, and looks at Steve to get his attention.
He fishes his phone out of his pocket, and googles the words from the song Stella picked to introduce Maria in her book. He looks up the translation, and reads it over a couple of times, memorizes it. It takes him a few more tries to remember the whole thing in Italian, but it’s not that much of an effort. Sometimes the serum is useful for something.
, so for a second it’s as though it isn’t there at all. But then Tony catches up with it, and it all comes back—lancinating, excruciating.
And as hard as trying to work things out is, Steve can’t help but find a little bit of hope in their smiles, in Tony keeping Steve’s drawings, in Tony cooking for him. In the easy way Tony still takes care of him.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, “for what I did to you. To our family. I felt so… so angry at you, but… I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
There’s a long silence. Tony can feel Steve’s eyes on him, like a laser tearing at his flesh. He swallows and carefully places the picture of his mother on the table. There’s another one next to it, of Stella and Maria sitting on the piano stool together.
“I know. Hey.” Steve lowers his head to catch Tony’s gaze with his own. He uses his softest voice, his nicest smile. He takes the first step, because Tony can’t. “Hey. We’ve got time.”
Steve feels a rush of relief spread through him. He smiles at Tony. “I used to have dreams about this, too. And about so much more. And we can make all those dreams real. Together.”
He doesn’t know exactly why, though. There was always something wistful and lonely in Tony’s eyes, especially before they bonded, but even after. Every time Tony would say,
Steve scoffs. “Tony, I fell in love with you. I could list all the things I like about you, but the gist of it is… just that. I’m in love with you.”
“Yes, and then the Chitauri, the way we did... I aimed the repulsors at your shield and you directed the beam against the Chitauri. Do you remember that? That was, it was, it was great, I thought it was great.”
Tony opens the bedroom door carefully, steps inside before Steve. He sits on the bed, in front of the holographic screen. He gestures for Steve to come in as well, sit beside him, but Steve legs refuse to move.
“It’s on the both of us. We should’ve checked in with a doctor and ask what to expect, instead of just doing it on our own.”
“I have something. For you. From Mom. I don’t know why I didn’t tell you straight away, it’s… it’s her last letter. To you. I think it was meant to be mailed, but then with everything that happened… I’m sorry.”
His mind wanders back to Tony, to Stella’s book, to Maria Stark. He wonders how Tony feels about it, because no matter how little he actually knows about Tony and his mom, he’s pretty sure Tony had a different image of her in his mind, as was bound to happen.
“We’ll figure it out. With her. We love her. We made a mistake, a terrible mistake. She’ll forgive us.”
“You don’t have to. You don’t have to. Just, just don’t do this to yourself, alright? Don’t go to that place in your mind I can’t reach.”
He turns to look at Steve, who looks back, curious and a bit startled, his book still open as though he’s sure he’ll go back to reading it in a moment.
He doesn’t want to hear more. If this is his last night, their last night, their entire world’s last night—he’s not gonna waste it. He’s gonna swallow it all down—his bitterness, his sense of betrayal, the hurt—and just
T'Challa shuts the door. He walks back to Steve, they shake hands. Tony looks at Steve’s lips while he says, “Thank you for everything you’ve done for us.”
Steve forces him down onto his knees in front of Tony. There’s a glint in the man’s eyes that speaks of mild, bored amusement, as if he expected this, saw it happen from miles away.
“Wanna feel you clench around my knot,” Steve says, surprising even himself. He doesn’t think of himself as a dirty talk kind of Alpha, but Tony brings so many new things out of him. It’s amazing.
But it’s fine. The secret is to move slowly, work around the shape of the shirt, crawl inside it, take advantage of how stretchy the fabric is. In no time, Steve is pulling it down over Tony’s hips.
The first thing Steve does after closing the door behind himself is take an impossibly long breath and keep it his in lungs for a while, eyes closed.
Tony thinks about it. “I don’t know, Steve. Maybe it would’ve hurt more, in the end. Maybe not, maybe I wouldn’t have punched you. Maybe you would’ve told me about my parents and we would’ve laughed in Zemo’s face. I don’t know.”
Well, it’s not enough—it’s not Steve—but it does take the edge off of his heat. He brushes the pad of his thumb along the space inside himself where Steve’s knot should be, and he doesn’t know if that makes things more bearable or if it just makes him more aware of how empty he is.
“The first thing that comes to mind is that it was made of wood and burned down. Not uncommon, back then.”
And he can—sort of, but—he can accept it. In a way. It’s normal to feel like this. He’s a widower. They brutally murdered his husband in front of his eyes. It’s normal that he’s struggling to move past this. Past the violence that took the love of his life, his soulmate, the better part of him—away, forever.
He just wishes that at least the Bad Mornings would stop, because those are too awful. He doesn’t think he’s going to be able to survive a lifetime of those, no matter how occasionally they happen.
When Tony realizes who is in the kitchen, Steve can tell he wants to run away, but then he puts a chagrined smile on his face and soldiers through it. No one can say Tony Stark is anything but brave, or that he ever backs down from a challenge. They make small talk for a minute, exchange a few updates regarding the team. Tony makes himself a smoothie; Steve looks at him, his dirty shirt, his greasy hair, the blurred shape of his goatee, the streaks of motor oil covering his arms. Tony clearly only washed his hands with the dish soap he keeps in the workshop bathroom before coming up to the kitchen.
Tony nods, and gives him a quick, lopsided smile, which is unexpected, perhaps, but not at all unwelcome.
The city is hot, crowded with tourists, and Steve finds it as beautiful as he imagined it’d be. He read about it on the internet while in the car, but actually being here is another thing entirely.
Tony’s expert and sure of himself, and this isn’t Steve’s first rodeo either, but in the beginning it feels weird that he’s not really bobbing his head or even sucking or anything, he’s just swallowing around Tony’s cock over and over, saliva dribbling out of the corner of his mouth while he presses his nose into Tony’s pubic hair and there’s nothing else, nothing else at all, there’s just—
The screen flashes in front of his eyes. It takes him entire seconds to realize that it’s an incoming call.
Tony quickly glances at him while he starts the car and drives off, and Steve nods. It’s a silent dialogue, something that sometimes they’re oddly capable of doing.
“Then you don’t have to worry about a thing, alright? Dad and I will sort this out. We’ll make up for good and we’ll be happy for real. And if there are any problems you can talk to us. About anything. Anything at all.”
Steve smiles again, then unpacks a few things and takes a shower. He dresses like it’s winter again.
He dives into the water, pushes himself further and further with his arms and legs, keeping his belly close to the bottom of the river. It doesn’t remind him of the arctic sea at all: there are countless plants growing underwater, rocks, the occasional fish. No ice. The water’s warm.
“I don’t know, I don’t… it’s been such a hard day, I don’t know…” he trails off, and his exasperation takes the form of a groan, and he looks like he’s already regretting what he’s going to say next.
Steve stares at their fingers and suddenly laughs. “Do you know you did that Italian thing with your hand today?”
“T—thanks,” Tony chokes out, and he’s suddenly aware of how empty his mouth is. He wishes Steve would knot his mouth. They did it once, and he cried and choked on it, and his face ached for days afterwards. It was
But at some point someone shoved this baby in his arms and Tony really, really, didn’t want to give her back. And to whom, anyway?
He entertains the idea that maybe Steve doesn’t really want him, that there’s been some kind of misunderstanding. But it can’t be—he recognizes all the signs. They did this dance once already; Tony knows what the twinkle in Steve’s eyes means, what’s hidden in the softness of his smile. He knows how Steve looks when he thinks about kissing him.
Steve scoffs. “I wish I knew how to answer that. We were friends, I guess, but then we got to spend some time alone and... we made love once and I’m still not sure it wasn’t casual sex for him.”
And Tony really didn’t expect that. What the hell. Medical advice on the internet is supposed to be bullshit. Are there no more sacred things in this world?
He smiles at the young woman greeting him. Chiara is her name. She tells him that the car keys are in the glove compartment of the car, as per his instructions. She gives him a card with a number to call in case of trouble and Tony can think of seven scenarios in which that could be useful.
Steve shrugs a hoodie on and goes outside. The wind has picked up, and lightning strikes the sky again. He walks around the guest house, but Tony isn’t there.
“Oh god, no. My science’s always been too closely linked to my company. Having me would be like saying ‘Hey, everyone, go buy the stuff this guy makes!’ and they can’t have that. Not on national television.”
Right. That’s why it felt familiar to Tony. Mom used to quote Dante sometimes. She knew many parts of the
“I know. I’m sorry. The more I think about it, the more I see things I could’ve done differently. It’s all,
“No, it’s... it’s fine.” He pauses, thinks about what to say next. “I was trying to protect him, and Tony, too. I knew something. About Maria’s death. And instead of telling Tony, I kept it secret. He found out in the worst way, and it hurt him. It hurt him a lot. I’m trying to earn his forgiveness, but...”
“And then we’d make another baby. I want a girl that looks like you this time. We’d name her Maria.”
“I feel like I’m the slowest runner in all the world,” Tony replies, thoughtful and honest. “But... I’m just gonna keep running.”
Tony looks at him with a confused expression on his face, a deep frown bringing his eyebrows together. He shakes his head and Tony looks worried.
It’s okay with Steve. He settles between Tony’s thighs, strokes his soft dick with delicate brushes of his fingers, massages his balls, presses on his prostate from his perineum. Tony groans. Steve gets an idea: he makes Tony roll on the bed until he is stomach down, spreads his cheeks apart, nips at the plump meat of Tony’s ass for a bit until Tony hisses, and then, without much preamble, he licks Tony’s hole.
But the issue of Tony’s erections is still there, of course. They can’t just stop, it could be bad for him. So they agree: sex once a day, doesn’t matter when, depending on work and whatever else they have to do. Could be better at night for both of them, but Steve knows sometimes Tony wakes up to a spike of anxiety, so he’s willing to help with those even if he has to postpone his run, or not go that day. But if they’re tired, not in the mood, don’t want to for whatever reason, they can skip a day. Sex marathons keep being a thing they do, not every weekend, but once a month, or when and if they really feel like it. About once a week, when Steve feels really keyed up; when his sexual drive really isn’t letting him live, they’ll try to do something about it. If it happens more frequently or if at any point either of them feels like anything needs to be changed, they’ll talk about it and decide each time.
“Not even if you paid me a million dollars, Mr. Stark. But you’re welcome back to pet them any time you like.”
Steve’s panicked expression always puts Tony into a sort of damage control mode, so he’s glad he could minimize the issue. Steve’s body runs on a different wavelength than basically everyone else’s; he was made to be strong and durable, and his sexual prowess comes with the serum package. But the point is that Tony doesn’t want Steve to feel embarrassed about it, about who he is. Tony isn’t, so there’s no reason for Steve to be.
Without wasting any more time, Tony rubs lube all over his dick and then makes sure Steve is still properly stretched. He pushes his forefinger into Steve, and—god—he’s already so tight again. He works the muscles loose with patience, tugs at his own cock with his free hand once in a while. He scissors two fingers into Steve, adds more lube.
“You’re a good Alpha,” he whispers against Steve’s mouth when the kiss ends, “and you’re a good man.”
Steve goes to Sarah, pushes the pacifier in her mouth and lulls her back to sleep. He whispers things in her ear, something that sounds like a song.
He can feel pain again. It comes back into the field of his awareness all of a sudden and all at once, like water flooding a valley after the dam crumbled down.
“Perfectly fine, sir. The route we traced is free of traffic, as you predicted. Avoiding the motorway is indeed a wise choice.”
“Shit,” he murmurs, and hopes the water swallows his voice enough so that Steve doesn’t burst into the bathroom with a worried face.
about it, or all the jokes the tabloids make about Captain America, the first fossil, dating Iron Man, the golden fossil. Steve loves Tony just the way he is. Tony is just Tony, the man who has fought at Steve’s side for thirteen years as they saved the world.
Sarah nods and hides her face against Tony’s neck, but she doesn’t cry. She breathes a little harder and deeper for a few minutes, but then she calms down and lies back between them.
Sarah makes a face. “But it’s fine now, right? You guys made up?” Her voice is so small and doubtful, it stomps all over Steve’s heart.
Tony stirs underneath him, but Steve relentlessly keeps going. He looks at the side of Tony’s face while he opens his eyes and blinks a few times. A little smile surges up to his lips.
And there’s something else too, a tender grin on Steve’s face, as if he’s finally remembering something he had forgotten a long time ago.
His grip isn’t tighter than usual, but he strokes Tony’s throat up and down, and Tony swallows against the constriction, lifts his head to expose more of himself to Steve’s touch.
But there’s a part of Tony’s mind that never stops thinking. There’s a part of him that never stops with the self-sabotage, with the manipulation. You do it for half your life, it becomes a habit. Habits are hard to kill, old ones especially.
The night before Lagos was... hell, Tony doesn’t even have words to describe it, how it felt to have Steve inside himself, how warm his mouth was. But everything that’s happened since, it’s enough to sour the memory in his mind. He doesn’t regret it, and he’s thankful Steve doesn’t as well, but—
“No, you can’t. I don’t want you here. You’re so annoying when you’re worried.” He rolls his eyes. “I want you to stay there, with Tony, you guys talk, and fix things. Or try, at least. Honestly, Steve, the shit you pulled…”
Steve enters the room a minute later, because he can’t even give Tony some fucking peace to lick his own wounds with some dignity.
“I know. I just… Fuck.” He brushes a hand over his face. He looks like he’s aged fifty years since yesterday, and it takes all the self-control Steve has left not to reach across the bond and soothe his agony.
—Tony rejects him. Even if they stay friends, which is already assuming a lot, Steve won’t be able to do anymore a lot of things that he can do, now.
“It’s not about that. It’s Mom, in that, in that tape. Screaming his name, I—” Tony covers his mouth with his hand, swallows, sighs. “But yeah, he was distant, and when he wasn’t… Oh, don’t make that face, come on. It wasn’t as awful as you think. Many children have it way worse than I ever did.”
Tony’s eyes are unfocused; he’s thinking about something. Steve changes for bed and sits quietly next to Tony. The moon casts a weak light in the dark room, but Tony’s face is illuminated only by the glow of the arc reactor. Sharp edges, sharp shadows.
They walk for maybe five minutes, but it seems like they’ve been dropped into a parallel universe. The trees are so thick that it feels impossible they could ever thin out and leave space to other things, and the ground is still wet from the rain. The birds chirp loudly, perched on the branches, industriously at work for survival.
He jolts awake, sits up on the bed to wrench his shoulder free from the hand touching it, but it’s only Steve. He tries to breathe, but all he can manage are shallow and irregular gulps of air.
He’s just put his sleep clothes on when someone requests access to the penthouse from the elevator. Tony grants it before checking who it is.
Steve feels as though a door is being opened inside him. On the other side of it, there’s the part of himself he was trying to hide, thinking that was what was needed of him.
“I always loved you,” Tony says, and he comes all over Steve’s chest, and he feels Steve come and his knot stretch him out not a moment later.
Tony looks at him, defiant despite still being trapped between Steve’s hands, the lightning that lacerates the sky dancing on his face and casting a sickly shade on his skin.
He feels so tired. He’s devastated, torn apart and left to bleed out. All his love for Tony, everything he thought he knew about them just shifts, and he feels as though he’s in a snow globe that a child was shaking and then dropped to the floor, and now Steve is there, waiting to see how all the white specks will fall down, the shapes they’ll make.
Dropping things on the floor becomes her favorite pastime. She laughs in delight hearing how different things produce different sounds.
They visit more churches in the afternoon, but they can’t go inside one because restoration is underway. They go to Galleria degli Uffizi, where Steve spends way too much time looking at paintings, and then they go to Galleria dell’Accademia, where Steve spends way too much time looking at sculptures.
Tony can’t process or rationalize this at the moment, but Steve can’t mean what he seems to be meaning, not really, but it’s fine, who cares, whatever floats his boat. He’s an old-fashioned guy, maybe he likes this type of talk in bed. Tony can just roll with it.
“When we want. It’s my plane, it leaves when I want it to leave. What would be the point in having a plane if it doesn’t wait for you to get there?”
as though he was the Alpha instead of Steve, but Steve answered, patient and permissive while some type of anger colored his face in red hues.
Tony had kissed him in the elevator. Steve had his hands in his pockets, and he was starting to feel awkward, unsure about how to end the date. But Tony turned, went up on his tiptoes, fisted the lapels of Steve’s leather jacket and waited for Steve to bend his head and meet him halfway. He cupped Tony’s face with his hand as the elevator dinged open to the workshop floor.
Entering the Shadow Pillar prison is easier than Tony thought. Steve has already been here once, to talk to the man who stole his face and was a tyrant in his name, and not much has changed since then.
Getting the words out takes everything out of Tony, he sways forward, unable to hold himself up any further. He ends up straight between Steve’s arms.
“Okay, you feel ready to me, what do you think?” Tony’s eyes go wide and he almost looks worried for a moment, like he didn’t expect that all the things they did up to this point would actually lead to
“I... don’t know if I did. I wasn’t an alcoholic, per se, but, uh, I was starting to feel like I was on the way there. Like it wasn’t just recreational anymore. So I made a decision before it could get worse, you know.”
Steve takes him home and Tony thanks him with a rough, scratchy voice, and he asks to be left alone. Steve says, “Okay, Tony. As you wish. I understand,” and he leaves, and Tony thinks that Steve doesn’t understand, not really, and he will have to explain it to him, eventually. But Tony, just then, loved Steve a bit more for saying what he said the way he said it.
“No… I mean, to see everything you’d need to stay in the city two or three days at least but… I saw enough. It was enough. I’m happy with what we did.”
Tony comes out of the bathroom still in a daze, weirdly surprised to find out that his shower didn’t make what just happened between Steve and him any less real.
Tony lands in front of Natasha and Bucky’s Brooklyn apartment building and waits for the suit to retreat from over his body, waving a hand at a couple of kids passing by when they smile and point at him.
Tony wonders if Stella isn’t speaking from her own experience. These past few years, suddenly alone after Laura’s death… it must’ve been hard.
“I got an idea,” he says. “Maybe it won’t make you sleep, but you’ll relax. Better than nothing, right?”
“Ok, Luca, torna da lei, va bene? Se fai il bravo tra qualche giorno ti spedisco un regalo a casa, mh?”
The bracelets around Tony’s wrists hiss, and the armor forms all around him in less than six seconds (he needs to get it down to less than five, than four, than three), all the pieces slotting into place with perfect precision, and Tony isn’t lying under Steve anymore, no, he’s standing next to the bed but
Steve wonders why Tony doesn’t order wine. It’d go well with this food and it looks like this place has all the best ones.
“Oh, that’s... don’t think about that, Tony. Your heart was in the right place, it wasn’t your fault.”
When the song finishes, Tony breathes in and out as if to calm himself, and then turns to look at Steve. He’s already staring, eyes rapt, lips parted in wonder. He sweeps a hand over his mouth.
He got Tony on board with this idea—for his health, of course—but Steve would be lying if he said he wasn’t having the time of his life. Having Tony pressed to his chest most nights, or curled up between his arms, or resting his head against Steve’s ribs is everything he wanted in life, and more.
Steve’s attempt at steadying his own breathing under the spray of the shower fails miserably, just like his effort not to think about the dream.
Tony closes his eyes for a moment, and behind his red sunglasses Steve can see him fight against a deep sadness, something that creases the corner of his eyes and makes his mouth go slack. He slowly shakes his head, just once, as if to drive away a bad thought.
She made Mom cry. She left, and then Mom went to sit with Tony on the floor and she was crying, and she hugged him tight. Tony hugged her back, because Mom had taught him to hug people when they are hurt. Tony had hugged Ana the day she cut herself with the gardening scissors, and had hugged Jarvis when he burned his finger on the stove.
Later, they have lunch. Steve makes pasta with Stella’s ragù, asking Tony for instructions only at the trickiest points of the process.
She’s been bullied at school, of course. She doesn’t want to say why, not even Steve can make her say why, but Tony knows. He knows why.
One day he had been allowed to stay with Dad while he was working, and he had handed Tony a soldering tip at some point. It had been too hot for Tony—he didn’t have thick calluses on his hands like Dad, back then—so he had dropped it. He showed the reddened skin to Dad, but he didn’t hug Tony. He yelled at him for dropping the tip, and Tony ran away.
And yes, under any other circumstances, at any other time of his life, Steve would probably get bored in a few days, would want to go back to the chaos and the noise and the smell and the people, but right now this is the only place he wants to be in the entire world.
years old. Which was stupid enough to begin with, if he’s being honest. Why would Steve even want him? After all their conflict? After Ultron, goddammit. This is Steve Rogers we’re talking about. Captain fucking America. Tony’s already lucky if an Alpha like Steve is okay with being in the same room as an Omega like him, or that he looked at him twice, or even spoke to him. If he’s honest, it’s a miracle that Steve is willing to work with someone like Tony at all. Truly a testament to the goodness of his heart. So why did he say yes when Tony asked him out? It makes no sense. He could have anyone, seriously,
Steve lets Tony drive for the rest of way back to the guest house. He tried to protest, but in the end trusting Tony seemed like the best thing to do. Driving calms him down.
Steve’s comment is met with a stunned silence that’s barely noticeable in the deserted gym at... almost 2 in the morning. The criticism is mild and kindly offered, but Tony feels called out by it nonetheless.
Bucky’s flesh hand closed around the neck of Tony’s mother and squeezed the life out of her, and Tony is here, spending his time and money to help that same man get his life back together with an air of inevitable necessity behind his eyes. As if this is what anyone would do if they were in Tony’s place, as if this is not only completely normal, but also the only possible course of action for someone in his position.
He tosses his bag onto the backseat, closes the door with more force than is necessary. He thanks the woman, says goodbye. He looks at her walk away without really seeing her. He gets in the car and closes the door.
“Why did they put all those statues up there? All those details. Seems like a waste of time and energy, you know. No one can see them.”
She never wanted to waste time. “Who cares,” she used to say, “no one’s gonna see us. It’s just going to be you and me,” and Tony felt so special, like he was being trusted with some unprecedented secret. Jarvis would come back to take them home at dawn. When Tony got older he’d drive the car. Mom always preferred to avoid it.
Steve fucks up into him a few times and the whole universe goes still as Tony catches his breath as though he just ran a marathon instead of being asleep. The pounding in his head stops, the terrible sensation twisting his guts slowly ebbs away, and there’s only the perfection of Steve being inside him, of Steve kissing his chest and his neck, of Steve stroking his mind and his dick and all the pain and discomfort transforming into pleasure and peace and—
Months pass, then a year, then two. They avoid the end of the world three times. The team changes: sometimes someone leaves, sometimes there’s someone new, but Steve and Tony simply stay.
Tony laughs to himself while Steve reads the tourist information out loud. He remembers the story: Galgano Guidotti converted to Christianism after a ruthless youth, and decided to become a hermit. To prove his faith, he planted his sword into the ground, so he could use it as a cross, for prayer. Legend says that since that moment, no one has ever been able to remove the sword from the ground, which became as hard as a stone. Galgano was canonized shortly after his death.
Tony gives him a quick glance, like he’s ashamed of needing the reassurance at all, but he gifts Steve with his small lopsided smile, and then walks away, towards the apse.
He’s different, but he looks good. He’s lost a few pounds, maybe, but he seems healthy. His facial hair is unkempt, his hair longer and styled differently—curls falling over his forehead instead of neatly combed to the side like it used to be. There’s a lot of gray in his beard and at his temples, too. Steve didn’t know Tony dyed his hair. He seems to have stopped, anyway. He’s sure Tony did it on purpose.
“Did you two form some weird coalition against me?” Steve asks, squinting, shifting his gaze in feigned suspicion from Bucky to Tony.
when he enters the shower at night. Then, he remembers they haven’t run out; it’s just in another bathroom.
“You were right, Tony. Mending the bond triggered this. Plus, you finally made your nest. It’s only normal that he’d want to… well, expand the family. Technically.”
Tony feels his eyes open and it’s strange because he doesn’t remember closing them or not being able to see, he only remembers Steve’s face, unrecognizable with disgust and hatred, for Tony, because Tony hurt—
, Tony thinks, because he still expected a minimum amount of respect from Steve and instead he gets… this. What is it? Pity? Mockery? Steve gets to play out his little outdated fantasy in his head so he doesn’t feel too bad about wanting to fuck without bonding or some shit, while Tony gets… nothing. Absolutely nothing beyond satisfying his curiosity about what Steve’s knot must feel like, because he still wants that. He still wants Steve; he needs to be honest with himself at least while it’s happening. He wishes things were different, sure, that Steve really loved him, that this led to something that wasn’t just
Tony’s cheek is warm and coarse under his palm. His beard is gray in places. He’s staring at Steve, wide-eyed, confused.
But it’s been ten years. Ten years since that last time. They didn’t do it many times, they weren’t together for long before everything went up in flames, but those few times, oh, those few times. The memory has kept him sane all along, but it won’t be enough now.
Tony feels his heart clench behind the arc reactor. He’s going to have to leave him so soon. Steve will be alone for some time, mourning him, then hopefully he’ll find someone else. Someone who will make him happy in ways Tony can’t. By staying with him for more than a few years, maybe. By growing old with him instead of being already old from the get-go.
“‘M sorry,” Steve slurs, he shuts his eyes, opens them again, clutches at his chest. “But I wasn’t... I never stopped, I, I know it’s wrong and—because I hurt you and—I know I shouldn’t, but I still want you. Will always... will always want you.”
Tony shifts, kneels on the bed too, while Steve’s hand falls away, while the moment blends into something somber. Tony’s flirty, playful look from before has vanished.
He’s still clutching his dick. He’s not usually shy about his body, and Nat has seen him like this before, but he still feels mortified that he’s putting his friend through this.
But he doesn’t feel trapped. It’s a different feeling. Not protected, exactly, not really safe, but…
Steve leans back but doesn’t let Tony down, walks towards the bedroom still holding him up, lets them both fall heavily on the mattress.
He looks like a lion, like this. The beard, the long hair, the way Steve’s curling up around Sarah to protect her…
Steve sobs and whines and weeps and whimpers and wishes he had some way to make it all stop. To make this stop.
The arc reactor shines through the fabric. He taps at it, and heads for the kitchen. Steve is on the couch, typing something on his phone. Talking to Sam, maybe.
His dick hurts so much. His skin is on fire; he wants to peel it off his bones. He’s in so much pain, and it’s only the beginning of the rut.
Steve moves down the bed, lies down between Tony’s legs. Pushes a couple of fingers into Tony’s body, but Tony feels them like from a great distance. He feels the warm liquid inside him trickle down the crack of his ass. The sheets are wet with it.
Steve lets her come closer. She kisses his cheek. Her hair smells like home and safety and family and love and heartbreak.
He glances in Tony’s direction, and he’s surprised to see he isn’t as cheerful as a few minutes ago. He’s looking at him intently, staring, wonder in his eyes. Steve smiles to himself, and resumes his work. Knowing that Tony now looks at him like that makes him feel warm. Wanted.
The t-shirt is easier to put back on. It’s Steve’s, so it’s a bit big on Tony, and it would be even bigger if Steve didn’t have a preference for incredibly tight t-shirts. Not that Tony would ever complain about that.
Steve sweeps his hands up the back of Tony’s thighs and palms his ass, urging it up until he has Tony propped up on the couch so that his cock is in front of Steve’s face. A moment later, Tony’s world is reduced to how hot and wet Steve’s mouth is, how tight his lips are around Tony, how his fingers caress Tony’s balls. Tony goes softer at some point, but Steve keeps sucking and licking, clearly a man with a plan, and even if it takes a while in the end Tony comes with his dick deep down Steve’s throat. He kisses him and kisses him after that, lets Steve take him to bed, lets him be the big spoon.
“No more excuses,” Tony echoes, nodding his head and tucking his nose against the hollow of Steve’s throat, right where the smell of
“I didn’t know the serum could do nothing against receding hairlines,” Tony deadpans, and the words have so little venom in them that Steve actually laughs.
Tony is still breathing shallow and fast, there are tears on his cheeks. Steve takes a deep breath himself. Okay.
“I want you to know,” Steve starts again, “That despite my actions, I’ve loved you more than anything else in this life, and that I love you now, and that I always will.”
“I never dislike your drawings. I’m not an expert, but they work for me, you know? Maybe it’s naive, the way I look at them. Sorry.”
He doesn’t know why he’s this close to Steve right now, there’s no reason for him to be this close, it’s just—
He feels so heavy. He’s aching all over. Deep inside him, where his muscles are wrapped up around his bones, there’s something painful. It twists in his guts, ravels his insides in an sickly way.
He’s in Steve’s mind, Tony, trying to guide him to reason, but thinking is such hard work, and Steve is so tired, so tired of everything that isn’t Tony sitting on his face or his lap, he’s not picky.
The blunt tip of Steve’s cock makes its way past Tony’s rim, and then... there, it’s happening. He’s being fucked into the floor.
They’re quiet during dinner. It’s not like they don’t have anything to say, it’s that there’s no need to say anything right now. Steve smiles, timid and hopeful, with his mouth full of the food Tony made for him, his eyes crinkling up at the sides, and that’s all that matters for now.
“Fuck me, Tony,” Steve says, and Tony is speechless for a long time. “You wanna try? I do,” reinforcing every word with a thrust of his fingers—the one in himself, the one inside Tony.
It’s the middle of the day, and he’s with Tony under the cherry tree. They’ve brought their blanket here, and they’re lying on it now, Tony under Steve, facing him.
“You think I could get you pregnant again, hm? Would you do it, Tony? Would you have another child with me?”
Steve can’t move, but she understands him immediately, twisting on the bed to bury her face into Steve’s neck. He can feel her calm down against his body, and having her this close, being able to feel her hair on his face, her soft skin against his beard… it makes the pain tolerable for Steve.
“Sorry,” he says, lifting a hand to scratch the nape of his neck. He’s nervous. It’s weird. “I heard the news and… But I didn’t know if you… Sorry it took me so long to come visit.”
Tony jumps a few times on his spot, discharging his nervous energy to the padded floor. He breathes out through his mouth, lowers his head, concentrates on Steve’s voice while he starts hitting the bag.
“My blood is your blood. My flesh is your flesh. My mind is your mind.  May our bond be never-ending, may our lives be tied forever. There is no beginning and no conclusion. We are together as one in the garden of life.”
“Thank you,” Tony says, then thinks about it. “I mean, I didn’t really do anything. I didn’t participate in the process of making her, but—”
something like that, he knows what that’s like. It may not be romantic but that doesn’t change the facts. Right?
“So I thought about it, while you were sitting all quiet in the passenger seat. I thought and thought and thought about it.
, seriously?), and the heat, the pressure, the weight of Tony’s body on him, Steve is on the same page in the span of seconds, and he would chalk it up to the serum but… yeah, it’s not the serum.
He doesn’t know if he likes Steve talking—albeit indirectly—about his mom, but Jarvis (the human one) used to tell him the same thing. That he moved like his mother. Had her smile. The same quality to the glint in his eyes. The same
Steve takes a bite. He looks at Tony. He’s chewing. A bit of flour from the bread has fallen on Tony’s beard, and Steve reaches up with his hand to stroke it away.
“That’s what you were trying to say with your sketch, the other day? The one with us under the cherry tree? I thought we were just… I don’t know. Hugging, maybe.”
, and Steve doesn’t need to be encouraged twice, he starts fucking Tony’s face in earnest, faster, still thoughtful of Tony’s comfort but that bar has been placed much higher now. In an attempt to gain some control over what’s happening, Steve pulls one of his hands away from the wall, places it carefully on Tony’s head and waits for a reaction. Tony’s eyes are closed again, and he jumps a bit when he first feels Steve’s hand in his hair, mostly out of surprise, but then he does nothing. Steve takes it as permission and grows bolder, grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair and
“He... I don’t know. He listened to my apology, then told me it wasn’t really my fault but yours, so I got mad at him and he hung up on me. Then he called back and... I don’t know. It’s weird.”
“What’s bothering you? Hey. Talk to me?” Tony whispers, swallowing, and feeling it against Steve’s hand; Steve closes his eyes and gulps the air in, but it gets stuck in his throat every time.
Tony can barely move. He is in pain, but it’s a good kind pain. If all the pain Tony will ever feel for the rest of his life would be like this, then you could sign him up.
They strip in the bathroom, clothes still half-wet and clinging to them, and enter the shower together, without even feeling the need to discuss it beforehand. There would be no point in it. Not anymore.
There’s no blood, Steve notices. The skin there is whole and beautiful and smells like coconut and wood.
Steve takes out a glove and rests his hand over Tony’s shoulder blades. It’s warm and it feels big on Tony’s shriveled-up frame, on his paper-thin skin. But Tony lets himself be touched. He’s not scared. The other man, after all, wasn’t Steve.
His hand closes around his dick and he moans, loud but somewhat restrained. Steve encourages him with his mind, sits back, and watches as Tony gives pleasure to himself.
Tony wakes up peacefully, Steve’s face still pressed against the reactor. Maybe it was Tony that woke Steve up, maybe he was already awake, but Steve lifts his head, eyes open.
“If you ask me, it’s fucked up that they won’t leave you be, but it’s good that you have a way to protect yourself. As tiring as it may be.”
“Dad said to stay with you. He went downstairs ‘cause Uncle Rhodey needed him for a thing. Dunno what. Do you wanna hug She-Hulk?”
But the love, the love is different, and he understands it only now. Because his love for Peggy stays there, unchanged, unchangeable, a bullet that didn’t kill him but it’s lodged into his heart forever, a cut that has stopped bleeding at some point, and won’t bleed again. A perfect blossom that will never grow into anything else, that will never be touched, that will never wilt and die. Crystallized in time. Frozen.
What they do, though, that changes: Tony avoids being touched by Steve for a couple more times, but then he starts to slowly allow it. Steve gets Tony to fuck his fist, and Tony is different that time, his eyes are not just closed, they’re shut tight, there’s a deep furrow on his brow, his face is twisted in a pained expression.
Steve follows Tony back into the car. Very carefully, he attaches his phone to the USB slot. The vibration is as loud as a scream, but Tony doesn’t move.
Steve sits back. He’s looking straight ahead now, not at Tony anymore. Tony has a bent knee on the seat of the couch, and his body is turned towards Steve, but Steve’s isn’t as welcoming.
Steve looks like he’s doing his best not to say what he says next, but his stomach must take over his brain. “A couple more? Maybe. Sorry.”
Mom cried that day, Tony remembers because he had never seen Mom cry before, and he didn’t want to see it again. It scared him.
Steve slides his hands past Tony’s shoulders, and places them on his back, folding him into a tentative hug that grows more confident by the second.
Steve laughs, and sighs. “The part about the diamond in the middle of the heart… reminded me of you, of the shape of the reactor. And the hope that, you know, between all the people… there’s someone that’s different. That’s just for you. Not like a soulmate or anything, but like… someone that accepts you. That’s kind to you.”
“No. It was. Bad.” Steve’s voice is thick with tears, and he sniffs, loudly. He can’t stop himself from leaning into Tony’s touch, and that’s another way to apologize in his heart.
Tony pees. He wonders if he could really masturbate, but the more he thinks about it, the less the idea seems appealing. Steve would wake up for sure, and Tony feels ashamed of himself enough as it is. He’d rather avoid another awkward talk with Steve about how even Tony’s dick has PTSD.
Tony feels the tears stream down his face. There’s a lump in his throat, he can’t talk anymore, he can’t breathe, his arm is numb and his heart—
“Sorry to bother you guys,” Tony says while Bucky comes into the room from the corridor. He’s rubbing at his eyes with his hand. “Steve has a problem. He needs you, Nat.”
He is inside Tony. For the first time. And already he wants to crawl into Tony and stay there forever, doesn’t want to leave if it means that this is gonna stop, that he won’t feel like this all the time. He feels euphoric. He feels a kind of happiness he didn’t know humans could feel, didn’t know existed at all. Having sex with Tony has always been incredible, heady, an impossible mix of wild emotions that Steve didn’t know how to control. But this. This is love.
He’s never believed in the afterlife, but now he thinks that he could give up and stop fighting if that means he’ll see his mother again.
That day when Steve touched Tony for the first time after their only night together, and it was by mistake, but Tony allowed him. That day when Tony told him that there was a possibility he could forgive Steve.
“Wouldn’t it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a plane if it departed before you arrived? That’d be useless.”
The way her chapped lips touched the glass Steve would hold for her, in the last days. How she always felt sorry for the way she had made Steve, but never said it, and Steve never ever thought it was her fault that she had made him like that, small and frail and weak and sick.
A super soldier. The daughter of a super soldier. Summer. A lethal combination for wearing PJs to bed.
“No, seriously, what did even set you off, there’s just those two older men playing cards besides us here, and I really hope—”
He caresses Tony’s face one last time, then gets in the car himself and starts driving, sure of the direction he’s taking because sometimes the serum is actually useful.
“The worst part were those seconds between the moment he hit the ground and when I ripped his faceplate away. The worst part was seeing him unconscious. Thinking he was... That was the worst part.”
He had three blue roses delivered to the compound once. He just wanted to stare at them for a while, because Tony’s never been good at not hurting himself when he could. Pepper saw them.
“Fuck you, Steve!” Tony shouts in his face, and scrambles to get up from the bed. He grabs his pillow.
It’s everywhere, the pain, but mostly in his head—now it’s dark and cold. The sun is gone. Steve is there; Tony can feel him, but the darkness takes over everything and—
“We knew you were coming here—no one else knows, don’t worry—and he asked to see you. He asked if I could arrange this.”
Maybe there are places where it was better. Where Tony said the right thing at the right time and Steve’s heartbeat slowed down, and the rage ebbed away. Where Steve didn’t keep making that disgusted face every time Tony tried to explain his position to him. Where they could sit down and talk, without being pulled in a thousands different directions.
“I did everything right. You were enslaved for the same amount of time, in the same place, under the same conditions. You fought in the games. I let the Knights use you in the same way he was used. And you’re still—”
Steve closes his eyes, quickly, and clenches his jaw. “You’re right, I’m sorry. I don’t know... I’m sorry.”
And then talking with Tony one last time, hearing the sound of his voice. Closing his eyes and just listening to him ramble about his most recent project, or something funny Sarah told him, or the latest bullshit from the board of directors.
“Hey, baby,” Steve says, pulling her close to himself and Tony, almost crushing her a bit under them, shielding her from everything that could possibly hurt her.
His hands are tight on the steering wheel, knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. Sweat darkens the armpits of his t-shirt and drips down his temple. There’s a very thin metal chain at his neck, elegant, clearly a piece of jewelry. There’s something attached to it, Steve can see it beneath Tony’s t-shirt, but he can’t make out what it is. Something round, with an uneven surface.
“Ciao!” she shouts, ecstatic. She closes her eyes and pats Tony on the back. “It’s so nice to meet you, my boy,” she says, with a cute Italian accent.
“Let me… yes, a lab accident, when I was experimenting to fit the armor into these tiny strips of metal there was…. an accident.”
Natasha is thoughtful for a moment. “Tony, Steve hasn’t had a rut in a very long time,” she says, in a very kind voice.
He takes a few deep, regular breaths; he exhales through his mouth and feels his heart slow down to an acceptable rate.
Maybe he is. A bit. He’s not falling asleep all the time anymore and he doesn’t look tired when he has no reason to be. Maybe they’re not screwing this up. Maybe Steve’s doing something right.
Steve sobs, and Tony feels as though a current unravels into him, cruel in how vulnerable it leaves him. He squeezes his eyes shut, keeps the air immobile in his lungs. His pain is so deep and thick that he can’t even breathe through it, and while his tears seem to bring him some form of relief, it’s still a slow process.
“Sir, Miss Maria woke up about ten minutes ago. She didn’t seem to have any need for your presence, so I thought it best not to disturb you and Captain Rogers.”
Tentatively, as if scared Tony is going to push him away any minute now, Steve reaches around Tony’s body with his arm, strokes Tony’s spine with his thumb. Tony stiffens, but just for a moment.
. He brings it back to the guest house, and sets the table while he waits for Tony. Maybe he should put the clams in a pan or something, but he’s not really sure what Tony wants to do with them, and he doesn’t want to risk ruining dinner.
“Tony. Call Natasha. Right now,” he says, in a last-ditch effort at consciousness. “Please. Take the suit and leave.”
, it seems to tell him, and maybe Tony is really saying it. “Calm down, sunshine. I’m here now. You’re all right.”
“I’m tired, Steve. I’m so tired of feeling like this all the time...” Tony’s eyes burn, and he doesn’t have any power to stop the tears from falling down his cheeks.
The man clutches him tight when he fucks him from behind, or while laying on their sides. One of Tony’s ribs is bruised. More likely broken. It’s not healing properly. It’s not healing at all—weeks have gone by and it still hurts like the first day. But it’s not just the man’s fault—sometimes, Tony twists and breathes in too deep on purpose, so the sharp jolt of pain fills his mind to the brim, and he can’t think about anything else. He can’t feel anything else.
“We slept here last night. With you,” Tony says eventually, voice calm and even but full of shame, too. “And we’ve been here pretty much the whole day. The doctor said… But it wasn’t just that, and—”
And the illumination comes when Tony envisions the futures where Steve isn’t part of his life. Those are dark and cold, the worst possible worlds. Tony, too, becomes dark and cold over the years, solitude shaping his heart into the opposite of the light nestled in the middle of his chest—it’s a black hole of nothing. He sees the world being put at stake because of his stubbornness, Rhodey eventually leaving him with a regretful grimace on his face. Pepper left years ago.
Pain vanishes. Every discomfort disappears in a quick but natural way, abrupt and smooth all at once, the way the night melts away into the light of day. It lasts only for a few seconds—a few, beautiful, perfect seconds in which everything is just
“That’s crazy,” he says when Steve reaches him. “How much time can you hold your breath underwater, exactly?”
The mattress squeaks under Tony with every thrust of the hips of the man on top of him. The rhythm is hypnotic and Tony focuses on that.
“I don’t know. Not so much. The stuff Matt said about me at school… that I smell bad… I don’t know, I’m sorry.”
Tony presses his face into Steve’s body, his heart hammering with fear, and the world goes quiet for several long moments, because—
And everything, all the drive he could have, the instinct of self-preservation, the spark of fight in him, all of it has been washed away by a man who looks like the love of Tony’s life. That man, that bad copy of the best man Tony’s ever known, kidnapped Tony and fucked him against his will for three months and five days now.
But the most amazing thing, what really fills Steve’s mind to the brim and drives him crazy, is the way Tony tastes. The scent of his skin, of his slick. It’s metallic and intense, strong. Like the stars, Steve thinks again, but any true term of comparison falls short, because it’s so good that nothing can match it. Whatever it is, though, it’s now made sweeter by the heat.
Tony takes a step back from the bag and from Steve, who keeps looking at him with the most avid eyes. Tony wants to run away from that gaze—he’s sweaty, flushed, mad at his own gullibility, which isn’t something he thought affected him, but he has to come to terms with the fact that apparently, yes, it does. He’s just the pathetic Omega his father always accused him of being, ready to fall at any Alpha’s feet after sniffing some pheromones. Weak and gagging for it, always.
A supernova explodes in his mind, and then there’s only the pleasure-pain of Steve biting down on his shoulder, fitting his teeth over the mark he left there all those years ago—the first time they bonded, the first time he knotted Tony—the mark that never faded, not ever, not after all that time, like their love for each other didn’t fade, despite the guilt, the betrayal, and the abandoned bond.
He keeps his teeth covered with his lips, and keeps his mouth tight around Tony, open just enough. He doesn’t care about saliva dripping down his chin; he keeps Tony as wet as possible, the slide smooth and easy, and he uses his tongue to caress the underside of Tony’s cock and support the movement.
Later, in their room, Tony becomes silent again, numb again, but the anger underneath the surface is worse than before—it’s a vengeful fury that makes his hands shake while he unbuttons his shirt.
), and straddles Steve’s thighs. Steve, thankfully, puts his hand back on him immediately, it’s big and warm and his grip is tighter than the other time they did this and it just— it feels so
“But you don’t need one. You don’t need to apologize,” Steve protests before what Tony said actually sinks in. Then, “The, the first time, though, is that, is that normal, or…?”
Steve looks at him, as if he’s expecting help from Tony, as if Tony can finish his sentence for him.
When Steve joins him in the kitchen, his eyes are red. He must’ve cried again, and Tony feels guilty about that. But it’s gonna be fine; it’s gonna be over soon.
They sit on the couch, and the cats snuggle up to them, then move out of the way, annoyed, when Steve, heavy, rests his head on Tony’s thighs. Tony trails his fingers through his hair and keeps them there, his hand still against Steve’s scalp, warmth radiating off of him.
She recognizes objects by their names; she understand instructions; she shouts and dances when there’s music.
an erection, instead of this weird feeling where his dick can go only as far as half-hard at best. His body looked better, he only had a few gray hairs at his temples. And it’s even worse when he compares himself to Steve ‘peak of human perfection with superhuman stamina and the libido of a teenager’ Rogers: Steve seems always ready to
, right? I guess the other stars are sort of... the other people. Other women who shaped me and changed me by being my friends and lovers. The songs are about that too.”
Tony explains some things about the city that aren’t on the internet, things you only know when you have a special attachment to the place. Steve listens avidly, asks questions, makes a few jokes.
“I don’t give a shit about my memory of him. I care about you. Tony. You don’t need to be as strong and brave as Captain America. Most of the time, not even Captain America is as strong and brave as Captain America, believe me... I know the armor is a metaphor for you in many ways. But that’s yours, and yours alone. Iron Man is yours. It’s you. You don’t have to prove anything. Not to me. I know who you are.”
“Always, Tony. Always,” Steve says, and with the words Tony feels it in his mind too, how much Steve loves him. It illuminates the darkness, the dark clouds of Tony’s worst thoughts, and it makes space for a little warmth and quiet, and Tony feels reordered, repaired, pieced back together.
Immediately, Steve appears next to him. He kneels with one knee on the floor, and for a crazy moment Tony is reminded of a marriage proposal. Nothing further from their current situation.
He shuts the water off and stands there for a while, until the droplets running down his skin make him ticklish and uncomfortable. He dries off quickly; it’s too hot to keep the towel on more than necessary, and he gets dressed, even though he’d prefer not to have to.
“He… Remember that night when we talked about attacking the prisons where they keep Sam and Rhodey and Natasha? And we all agreed that it was too complicated, and that Osborn had explosives planted on every inmate, and that we had already lost too many people to risk losing even more? Better captured than dead, we said, remember?”
Steve gets up and puts on his boots and a hoodie. He heads downstairs, and then outside. He pauses for a moment between the trees.
“You need to rest. And you need to be with her. I know you do. And I need to be… somewhere else. Uhm. In the gym, I mean.”
Dinner comes and goes, and they postpone the time for goodbyes a bit more, taking coffee in the living room.
The way Tony smiles at him then, all teeth and crinkles and pure joy, that smile is better than anything, even better than the most beautiful night of Steve’s life, that now is maybe going to become the first of many.
But he respected Tony’s boundary around kissing, at least, that can’t be denied, he… he never forced Tony to kiss him and that has to… it has to count for something, right? Right?
Tony walks, and makes T’s with rocks, but nothing changes. He’s not walking in circles, it doesn’t seem so, but he can’t find his way out.
, but it’s like the mere thought is a new challenge for Tony, who lifts his hand up and sucks his fingers into his own mouth, tasting the product of Steve’s pleasure like it’s a religious experience.
The Piazza del Campo is an architectural masterpiece that takes Steve’s breath away. It’s accessible through little alleys, so you can’t see it at all until you’re right in the middle of it. It’s theatrical, in a way, like a curtain being suddenly lifted to reveal an elaborate scenery. The Piazza is shell-shaped, and divided into nine triangular slices representing the nine men who used to hold the power during the Middle Ages. It was a sort of declaration of liberty, Steve understands, a way for the people to say they wouldn’t be ruled by just one person who could decide for everyone, like it happened in many other Italian cities at the time. The Piazza isn’t flat, but built on a gentle slope, so the rainwater can drain away through a grating placed right where the nine slices meet. In the lower end of the Piazza, along the straight line of the semi-circle, stands the Palazzo Pubblico, with the Torre del Mangia.
He picks up the pace to catch up with Tony, and maybe it’s the noise Steve makes hitting the gravel, but Tony stops, and starts turning his head to look back, over his shoulder. It’s the split of a second, but Steve manages to take a picture.
“Thank you for ordering this for me. I really like it,” Steve says, because it’s true and because he needs to say something nice. Tony nods.
Steve kisses Tony’s neck, slowly, as delicately as he can, his lips barely pressing at all over Tony’s skin. He works his way up over Tony’s jaw, his cheek, his ear, his temple, his forehead. Tony is like a puppet under Steve’s mouth, the only sign of acknowledgment comes from his barely-there breathing, the air still between his parted lips.
“It’s alright,” Tony says, and kisses Maria’s forehead. He’s dirty; he should clean up, but he’s missed her. It’s only been an hour and he’s missed his baby.
No, no. He needs to calm down. They’re not there yet; they have to take it slow. They may never get back there.
Tony’s nostrils are full of the wooden scent of the lotion; he can’t smell the roses at all, but he knows Steve is here with him, sitting just behind him on the edge of the bed, touching him.
He lowers his gaze, tries not to raise suspicions by acting the good Omega act—demure and respectful in front of his Alpha; quiet, waiting for them to lead you. Overall, unaffected.
Steve remembers Tony telling him, years ago, how much he liked this. The deep level of trust and intimacy something like this requires, Tony got a kick out of it. Out of being allowed to let it all go for a little while, and be nothing—not Tony Stark, not Iron Man, no one. He could just be a body. A well-loved body for someone to use and worship and draw pleasure from. For Steve.
He’s covered in a thin layer of cold sweat that makes him shiver. He’s panting, his heart is pounding in his chest, he feels scared but doesn’t remember why. His throat is dry and coarse; his tongue feels like it’s made of cardboard. He tastes blood; he probably bit the inside of his cheek.
The situation is dire, but he can’t give up hope. He takes a few rocks from the ground, and rearranges them into a T. That way he’ll know if he walks past the same place twice.
Stella sits back on the couch, while Steve drags his armchair closer to Tony’s before sitting down as well.
“Yes!” She’s thoughtful for a moment. Her expression is the same Tony has when he’s thinking. “Can I kiss you?”
For Steve, guilt takes the physical form of a very cold shiver that runs through him from head to toe. It makes the hair on the nape of his neck rise, and he zips up his hoodie, uselessly.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, in an unanticipated bout of sadness and self-loathing. Something baleful clenches inside his ribcage.
The Bad Mornings usually start with a Bad Night: a night where Steve dreams of Tony being still alive, there with him. He dreams of Tony being happy, being whole and amazing, being clever and brilliant, his eyes shining with joy and love—for life, for Steve.
They don’t waste time in pleasantries. Tony suggests they get this done, so Stella can offer them all the tea and pie she wants.
There’s something written in the corner of the page, and Tony, characteristically, knows what it says before he even reads it. It’s in Italian.
Steve gets ready for sleep, then carefully sits on the edge of the bed, on Tony’s side, closer to the French window.
“Sarah, baby… would you mind leaving me and Dad alone for a bit? We have to talk about a super super boring thing.”
Tony, he… he doesn’t really masturbate. He doesn’t feel the need, especially since his heats are gone. Just sometimes, every few months, he wakes up hard and he takes care of it quickly, in the bathroom. Sometimes he doesn’t even need to do anything at all, his erection flagging before he can even free it from his underwear. But he never feels wet, he never feels open.
All of a sudden, Tony notices that his face is wet. He touches his cheek, stares at his own tears on the pads of his fingers.
One last goodbye. Kissing his daughter’s hair one last time, watching her smile. Telling her she’s smart and perfect and beautiful, and to keep her eyes sharp. To be brave, always. To stand up for what’s right, like his mom taught Steve a century ago.
The man groans and comes. He tries to kiss Tony, he always does after he finishes, but Tony moves his head away and the man doesn’t try again. With all the things he’s taking, Tony wonders why he doesn’t just force him into the kiss.
She places a necklace on the table in front of Tony. He reaches inside his shirt, unclasps his own and places it next to Stella’s.
His heart is beating really fast. Tony can hear it, with his head bent to rest over Steve’s collarbone. He feels his own heart rate speed up, and he imagines his heart beating against Steve’s; the two pushing at each other in a bizarre dance of blood and muscles.
She looks so different from how Tony remembers her. She looks like she’s been lit up from the inside.
Something uncurls and stings under Tony’s breastbone, and it takes him way more time than it should to recognize it as envy. He wants that too. He wants that too, so much. He’s sick of being alone.
Tony tightens his hold just a fraction, adjusts Steve’s head, places a kiss on his jaw. “Tomorrow,” he says again, and this time it’s a promise.
“I don’t think he’d want, uh… But desperate times… Maybe we could get, uh…” Bucky swallows, “a sex worker. A professional, you know, to…”
I love him more than myself, and yet sometimes I wonder if staying here didn't hurt him more than doing him good. I had hoped I'd protect him from Howard more than I could. My only real success is that he's never seen me cry again, after the day you came visit. What a terrible irony, that all my other tears have been caused by someone Tony doesn't suspect.
“I’m glad they had each other,” Tony says. “Even if it was for a short while,” he adds, and it sounds like an afterthought, but also as if Tony isn’t only speaking about Steve’s parents anymore.
“Here,” Tony says when they’ve reached a big tree with a little stone wall close by, white roses climbing all over it. They sit on it, in the shade provided by the foliage. Steve maintains a safe distance from Tony, looks at him while he wipes sweat from his hairline.
Steve crouches down, picks up the hem of Tony’s tank top and takes it off of him, leaving him completely naked. Steve goes back to his feet, lowers the waistband of his sweatpants to free his cock, hard and aching, guiding and pushing it past Tony’s lips without much warning.
, he’s so hard. Tony would find it in himself to be envious if he wasn’t so rapt with how beautiful Steve is right now, with how much he wants to keep him like this forever. For a minute, Tony even thinks that it doesn’t matter if in a few years he won’t be able to have sex with Steve anymore, he can still make him squirm and writhe and feel good in many other ways, and witnessing Steve’s pleasure will have to be enough for Tony. Will be enough.
The only bits of hope come from Tony’s presence in his mind. It isn’t constant; it comes and goes, but it’s soothing when it’s there. At least he’s not completely alone. At least Tony is willing to help him in one way, if not the other. The rejection isn’t so total.
“Tony,” he says, but the word breaks in the middle; his voice can’t sustain its weight. He reaches out with his hand, almost covers Tony’s cheek with it, but then he can’t. Then he thinks about it again, and he goes for it. Tony’s skin is warm under Steve’s fingertips.
Steve catches him before he falls, makes him sit on the stone bench. He crouches down in front of Tony, between his thighs—familiar, now.
They enter the church. There’s no door. Steve feels the grass underneath his boots. It’s so counterintuitive.
Tony stares at him the whole time, through every moan and groan and hiss and shudder. He lifts a hand to caress Steve’s cheek.
They have breakfast in the kitchen. Tony makes espresso with an old moka pot, fills two small cups with it. There’s a torta della nonna in the credenza, and he cuts two slices, making Steve’s bigger.
“I am, actually. I was of Peggy too. Thought Howard was sweet on her… turns out she was even worse than me. She shot me once because a girl kissed me. Well, she shot the shield.” Steve smiles at the memory.
And there’s also the fact that Steve told Tony that he had missed him, revealing something himself despite the fact that Tony didn’t acknowledge it in any way.
“I hope it’s soft enough for her. I wanted to use buttons for the eyes but then I thought, what if they come off and she… So I got some black thread and—”
Steve kisses him, sweet and sensual, pushes him down on the bed and strokes Tony back to a full erection. Tony’s about to slick himself up, roll over on top of Steve again, but then he thinks of something.
“I wish,” Tony pauses, takes off his glasses and hangs them at the collar of his t-shirt, then he mimics Steve’s gesture from before, swipes his hands across his face and presses his fingers into his eyes. He squints in the sunset light until his vision goes back to normal. “I wish everything was different. I wish we could... talk and... that there was no rush and that we... worked. I wish it wasn’t so hard.”
It works in cruel waves, because it’s so intense that he almost doesn’t even feel it anymore. His brain can’t process such a staggering amount of
He stares into Tony’s eyes while he pushes in painstakingly slow, and stops when the crown of his dick catches at Tony’s rim. When he feels the ring of muscles’ initial resistance finally give in, he releases the breath he was holding, tries to follow his own advice and relax, calm down a bit, but–
When they met, Steve was twenty-seven years old and Tony was forty-seven. And yeah, he wasn’t young, he already had a hole in his chest, his refractory period had changed, and many other things weren’t in top condition like before. But still, it was way better than now. He could keep an erection for a while—he could actually
Steve looks down at him, and a wicked grin makes its way on his face. “You know that means you’ll have to wear pants. And the undershirt.”
A brief, minuscule intake of breath from T'Challa. He’s surprised Tony knows the words, or maybe he’s just appalled at Tony’s pronunciation.
“See, this is what I meant,” Steve says then, very quietly, looking into the distance, “This is what I miss. You. And how I am when I’m with you.”
Asking for an explanation doesn’t seem like a good idea to Steve right now, but he will at some point. He’s worried.
“And that’s something we don’t want. Clearly,” Tony says, without missing a beat, and he sounds almost like his usual self.
“So, uh… this is embarrassing, but…” he takes a deep breath. “My muscles, there, aren’t very, uh, flexible?”
Tony puts his hands on the steering wheel. A normal people car. More or less. Not what he’s used to, anyway. But it’s okay; he doesn’t need fancy right now. The X1 is more than adequate. It’s anonymous and normal and tons of people have it, so he doesn’t stand out.
Tony is sensual when he walks like this, when he lets his hips roll with each movement. He can turn it off and on as he likes; Steve has seen him do it many times. So he knows that this time, like every other, is deliberate.
They sit there for a while, absently watching other visitors enter and leave the chapel, and then walk back down the hill. There aren’t many people, the first days of September already have an effect on the influx of tourists, and Tony idly wishes that it also meant some respite from the stifling weather, but he knows it’s going to take at least the middle of October for that.
), in Tony’s penthouse on the rug in front of the fireplace, in Tony’s penthouse on one of the bar stools, on a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, on
“Don’t be. Tony, it’s okay. This is hard on everyone, but on you, I can’t even imagine…” she sighs, rubs a hand across her forehead. “Listen, you’ll give it to me later, okay?”
They climb down the tower soon after, and sit on the ground in the Piazza, and even though Tony grumbles that only tourists do that, he’s clearly glad to rest for a bit. He’s sweating a lot, short of breath again.
Steve helps Tony lie down on the bed. He takes a towel from the bathroom and sits down next to Tony, almost smiling, shy and ashamed, carefully cleaning him up. “I’m leaking everywhere,” Tony has the time to say before the smile dies on Steve’s face. His pupils dilate and he bares his teeth with his effort to endure the pain, the fury of the rut. He’s already hard.
“Yeah,” Tony says, circling Steve’s wrist with his hand, and he’s still smiling, he can’t stop smiling and Steve can’t either, he never wants to stop smiling, never wants Tony to stop smiling.
“That’s something you must discuss with him. I can’t keep him and his friends in Wakanda any longer. I don’t want them there. My people don’t want them there.”
There’s no answer, only the muffled sounds Tony makes while crying, that no one but Steve could pick up from behind a closed door.
Steve rolls over onto him then, heavy and dejected, and fucks into him without saying a word, without even looking at Tony, but this time it’s not out of mindless arousal. It’s awkward and miserable and sordid and Steve tries to go along with it anyway, he really tries. He kisses Tony and stares in his eyes while he caresses his hair, and he tries to share something with him through the bond. But then he shakes his head and sighs and says, “I’m sorry, I can’t,” and he pulls out and sits on the edge of the bed and Tony wants to die.
“I don’t remember how I felt while he was falling. I was scared, I think, but I thought I’d catch him. I tried to. So that wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was when he hit the ground. The sound he made... I have nightmares about the sound he made.”
Steve looks down at Maria again. He lifts a hand to cover his chest, the movement hesitant and abrupt at the same time.
But that’s how the bond works, he supposes. It helps you be what you need to be, what your mate needs you to be, for the bond itself to prosper.
Despite how warm it is, Steve zips up his hoodie. It’s not even strange anymore. It’s just the shape of his guilt, the weight of it. He shoulders it like all the other consequences of his actions—not knowing when, if at all, he’ll be free of it.
Steve looks down at himself and he discovers that he’s naked, red and hard with want. Tony instead is still wearing his boxers, and Steve presses his hips against Tony’s, makes him groan in anticipation, feels his own heated skin slide over the silk in an obscene, perfect way. He leaves a stain on the fabric, and he moans at the sight.
Tony looks at Steve, who isn’t breathing. He’s waiting for Tony’s reaction, expecting it to be terrible, maybe, but hoping it won’t be.
Steve holds onto Tony to the best of his ability, and Tony lifts him up with no effort. He carries him to the jet and makes him sit in the co-pilot seat, fastening his seatbelt while the suit crawls back into the reactor.
“I drew this before I met you,” Steve says, quietly, without looking at Tony. “I told you I didn’t like the tower, but—”
“Well, he’s a way better choice. He’s Italian, works in Italy, is a genius. He never made weapons for the US Military. His science is
He takes him back to bed, then, and knots him there for two hours, and they don’t fall asleep, and Steve tells him that he loves him so many times that Tony loses count. But the words, even though worn out and overused, never lose their meaning. Each time is like the first—it’s what’s so special about those three words in particular.
Steve is confused, he’s so confused. Why is Riri telling him this? What does it has to do with anything, with Tony being—
In that moment, in that single moment of perfection, all his sins are atoned, and he’s free of guilt and burden.
“Tony?” he says, and his voice sounds foreign to him, nervous and hopeful, tense but excited. His hand trembles, and he presses the phone to his ear a little bit harder.
“And the necklace. You never had it before. You put it on when we go out, every time; even now you have it on, but as soon as we get home it disappears.”
It’s a bit weird, Tony has to admit. It feels different, but maybe he was the silly one, expecting Steve body to work as everyone else’s.
Steve opens his eyes and sees him. He doesn’t react for a moment, careful to keep his movements fluid so as not to wake his daughter up. Careful, considerate. He’s such a good father.
Steve feels something move against his right leg and he realizes it’s Tony’s arm, Tony is touching himself in a brutal, almost punishing way, Steve can hear the slap of skin on skin;
After about twenty minutes, they finally get their cones, and Steve thought Tony was exaggerating but… nope. This is the best—
“Sleep for a little while, Steve,” she tells him. “It’s gonna be alright soon. You’re gonna be alright. Don’t worry.”
It reminds Steve of the paintings of ancient ruins that were so popular in the first half of the 1800s. John Constable and Cole Thomas. Richter, Schiffer, Friedrich. Maybe even something older, like Verboom and Canaletto.
“Put a pot of water on the stove. Then go to the restaurant, they have clams ready for us. I can do it later if you don’t—”
“If only I saw through her pretense, back then, if I paid more attention... I can’t believe I missed it.”
He’s careful while he opens him up. Steve’s finger struggles to push past the initial resistance of Tony’s muscles, and he feels so tight around Steve’s first knuckle. So impossibly tight.
, keeps Tony’s head in place, his mouth where he can fuck it, his body trapped between the wall and Steve. And for the first time since Tony came into the shower, for the first time Steve’s ever heard, Tony moans, deep in his throat. And for a moment, just for a small moment, Steve gives in to the illusion that maybe he gets to keep this, that he gets to keep Tony even after their orgasms.
Tony turns to face him. He’s awake, and he looks at Steve for a long moment without saying anything. Then he straddles Steve’s hips and kisses him, his tongue reaching deep into Steve’s mouth; Steve can taste a drop of his own dried up come on Tony’s bottom lip.
“If you want,” Tony repeats, louder; then, quietly, “to take a shower…” he trails off, presses his lips together while his jaw twitches.
“Come to the bedroom?” Tony asks with a sweet smile, tilting his head to the side, and Steve’s knees do a weird thing while the air gets stuck in his throat.
He has no idea if the others felt the same when he played mommy for them. What did Clint think when he brought him kale smoothies when he was hurt? And Bruce, when Tony sat a cup of herbal tea on his desk at night? Or Nat, what did Natasha think of Tony pretending he didn’t know where all his little bags of blueberries went? He always had the best beers for Thor, protein shakes for Steve. Upgrades for their equipment and weapons. A state-of-the-art gym. Empty floors in the Avengers tower that became empty rooms in the Avengers compound.
“I had an idea of her in my mind, I thought I knew her… Unhappy, her whole life. Steve. Her whole life.”
There’s no betrayal coming from Steve’s end of the bond. No recrimination, no hate. There’s just quiet acceptance, a calm and personal grief. A goodbye, an
Tony looks up from the drawing and outside the French window for a while, then turns towards Steve, and smiles at him as soothingly as possible, in the hope of smoothing away that awful frown from his brow.
Steve lifts his face, and it’s a mask of tears. He brushes his fingers over Tony’s cheek, stroking; then he sweeps his thumb over Tony’s parted lips.
“Okay, I’m cheating, because this is an old one. It’s about... it’s about New York, though, if that’s okay.”
Tony feels that he can’t keep his eyes open anymore—goddammit—and tells Steve that he’s going to bed.
That frightened Tony. Not Steve wanting to kiss him, not Steve almost confessing something too huge and unbelievable to even think about, not Steve asking if he had Tony’s permission to sometimes, in the privacy of his own mind, imagine them kissing and Tony forgiving him.
“I’m trying to help him, but... I don’t wanna rush him, of course, but I’m starting to feel like I’ve been hanged by the neck and I just won’t die.”
Steve is looking in the distance, at the woods covering the hill in front of the one they’re standing on.
Tony opens himself up to Steve’s scrutiny and it takes so much more trust than what he thought he was capable of. He waits as Steve experiences him, and he catches glimpses of what Steve sees. Strawberry blond hair and deadpan humor, the solid pillar of Rhodey’s friendship, Happy’s warm presence. The loss of his parents, a lonely childhood, the nights spent in front of a screen to build up a long-lost friend. The brilliancy Tony can achieve, the willingness to use it to help people, then his eccentricism, his tendency to misbehave when pushed, his affected bravado. The keyhole through which Tony glances at the future, and the dark, heavy clouds of his past, the acid rains of regret, both public and personal, Obie’s betrayal. Then, Steve reaches the place where Tony keeps what he thinks of himself, his most private worldview, and that’s the only time that Tony shields from Steve—he let him come this far, but no further. Steve pushes at the closed door, doesn’t recoil, just touches it kindly, as though massaging a sore muscle, and Tony’s mind quiets down for a while, a tamed beast.
, and he covers Tony’s bruised hip with his hand, squeezes just enough to test how tender it is (very), how soon Tony hisses (pretty much immediately), if he opens his mouth around a moan after (yes), if he pushes his hip up into Steve’s hand to demand more (of course he does).
“Yeah, but... well. I guess people are divided on the issue. Some blame me, some blame you… but to a lot of folks you’re still Captain America, you know. It’s not something you can shake easily, that level of respect.”
For a minute—but it could be an hour, a day, a year—the most baseline elements of their biology are amplified by the social stereotypes ingrained in them. Steve’s guilt slides away to reveal bitterness, because he could never get his Omega to forgive him, could never get him back, and what kind of Alpha can’t discipline his Omega into submission? Tony’s betrayed trust becomes doubt; it becomes shame and self-loathing at having rejected his Alpha for so long, because what kind of Omega doesn’t want to please their Alpha?
He stares at Steve, expectant, and lifts his hands as if to ask him what the hell is he waiting for.
Tony replies with a smiling emoji, and he imagines Pepper shaking her head, fond, her beautiful hair falling over her cheek.
Tony moans, loud and deep and so unlike anything Steve is used to hear from him, so different from that one other time he got to do this to him, before, when Tony got so worked up that he could barely stand Steve’s touch. Steve pushes his finger deeper inside Tony, experimentally, looks, transfixed, at Tony’s face, every breath and moan and groan like a declaration of trust, a promise, a commitment.
, Tony thinks, some things really never change. Sometimes you just love hating yourself in some particular way that you manage to pick it back up right where you left off, no matter how long it’s been.
His eyes go wide, but he doesn’t ask. He sits close to me and reads out loud a book he stole from the castle’s library.
Stella’s words are as heavy as stones that settle inside Tony’s stomach and weigh him down. She doesn’t realize it, of course. Tony feels Steve’s eyes on his skin, but there’s really no way he can possibly look at him right now.
“You kissed me again and then it was over and I… I guess I missed the moment, I don’t know. But I almost told you and I keep thinking, what if… I keep wondering…”
Which isn’t new, per se. He has loved Tony from afar for years. He has had a lot of very explicit dreams involving him, as sad as they always left him. He has been looking at Tony for the last thirteen years, worked with him, sparred with him, showered close to him, saved the world with him. He has always liked Tony, has always been very attracted to him.
doesn’t want to vomit in the armor, so he waits a minute outside, in the cold, until the nausea goes away or just makes him sick.
The light pressure feels nice. Sometimes, when he lies on his side, he becomes uncomfortably hyper-aware of this thing in his chest, and pressing a hand over it takes the edge off of this specific flavor of anxiety. Steve’s hand is so big.
Tony thinks in probabilities, separates scenarios, predicts outcomes. There are thousands of ways this could go wrong. The ways this could go well are more than he would’ve initially guessed, but he struggles to let himself think them, envision them fully.
He rolls over to face Steve. He’s still awake. He has a frown on his face; he looks like someone who is rethinking the entire last day and trying to make his peace with it.
loud in the room. Steve gives him a hand up, and Tony makes a point not to linger with his fingers tangled with Steve’s. It’s stupid and pointless, but it gives him an impression of control over his feelings. He still treasures the moments when he’s able to keep his distance from Steve, to deny himself to him.
In the few minutes he’s been outside, sweat has gathered between the thin metal bracelets and the skin of his wrists.
and just ask Tony, demand an explanation, he has the right to it. But he is scared. After that night when he triggered Tony’s panic attack (and Jesus, Steve would kick himself in the face if he could) he is afraid that the wrong word at the wrong time could put an end to this whole amazing clusterfuck. Like this, he still gets to be with Tony. Sporadically, quickly, with Tony acting as closed off as any human could possibly be during sex, but he gets something. Sure, he feels like he has to pick up the pieces of his soul every time and put them back together after the devastation laid by hurricane Tony, but still. It’s Tony. Steve can’t say no, can’t bring himself to do it. Doesn’t want to at all, actually.
