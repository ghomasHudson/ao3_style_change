“...but you have other buildings and assets?”
“No, at
Scott swirled the dregs of his coffee thoughtfully. “I guess it wasn't my first priority since I saw Steve falling, though I guess he is a super soldier. And the biological weapon may have broken. Maybe he could have escaped easier small?”
“Here I thought they had a better technological infrastructure,” Steve replied lightly, even as he tugged Tony closer to him.
“I wonder what it would be like to fly,” Tony mused, cutting off the gratitude before he could start and stubbornly staring at the sea. Steve paused, but looked out as well. “It must be so exhilarating. Feet off the ground, wind in your hair, free from it all. You can go anywhere.”
“Hey, don't use my past mistakes against me like that!”
“What, is a rope going to drop down from the ceiling for me to climb?” Scott cracked nervously.
Tony gave himself the night to prepare, then left his room determinedly. He chickened out at the door, and as if sensing his godson’s distress, Jarvis walked into the room to begin breakfast. He saw the young man arguing with himself under his breath and manfully didn’t sigh.
“Yes, driving a car into a pool when robbing a place is totally subtle,” Natasha agreed.
Tony gasped. “That’s it, no more upgrades for you.”
She hummed noncommittally before signaling for a refill of her black iced coffee.
“What about how she looks at Steve? She likes him!”
“We already knew that,” Natasha said cryptically, with her signature slow smile. “We know everything we need to.”
“Wait,
Scott took another moment to marvel at the liveliness in the A.I. before he resumed his breakfast. Once he was finished, he found himself again at a loss for what to do. After a couple minutes spent considering whether to make another attempt to crack a Pentagon server, he figured he’d take Tony up on his offer. “Friday, can you bring me up some schematics on the building and information on the S.I. servers? I could do it myself, but I think he said you were allowed to help me with this.”
"You'd tell Cap, and then he'd never let me hear the end of it. Does it help that we didn't know he stole anything until just recently?"
“Yeah, I know. I was planning on talking to him after you gave me permission,” Sam agreed easily.
Natasha cracked her knuckles. “I can't say how I know this, but my hand will probably slip later if he wakes up again."
“Friday couldn’t find anything about your daughter in media accessible to the public, and destroyed everything else. The cop has done okay at hiding any ties to your family as well, and he seems to be well liked enough by his whole department, so they’ll help keep things quiet,” Tony said curtly, but Scott figured it was discomfort rather than displeasure about being bothered since he had already seen how much work Tony did.
“Happy here helps out with the Avengers sometimes, but I tend to keep his hands full with my personal messes,” Tony explains.
“Wanda is usually the last to come in for breakfast. She’s not a morning person,” Steve added.
Tony’s voice cracked as he continued. “It wasn’t worth it.”
Tony took it like a blow, horrified that he must have misspoke, but covered his shock and left Steve to his grief, after a sheepish reminder where Steve’s room would be.
“I doubt it. I think some are mercenaries,” Natasha cut in.
Rhodey snorted at Scott’s dismay when faced with the abrupt departure. "What did I say?"
Scott laughed at the irony of his life with her, and it was so nice to have a moment where they could laugh about their past together and his choices. When they eventually quieted, the lull in the conversation was comfortable, and Scott was almost disappointed when Maggie returned to the subject at hand.
“Exactly! But hey, the emotional imagery for your superhero name has to come before scientific accuracy, you understand. Anyways, I can’t stay and chat, just wanted to fly by, make sure you had settled in and Sam had shown you around. The team should be back in a day, tops, but until then Friday can help you with anything else you might need. Don’t forget you can always ask. You remember her from the phone, right?” Before Scott could process and respond to the barrage of information delivered at top speed in a disarmingly easy way, he continued. “Say hi to the new Avenger, Friday!”
Sam shrugged with an indifference he didn’t feel, and both turned back to Steve when he continued thinking out loud.
me for being there for the team, god. I thought I was an Avenger, of course I’m going to do whatever needs to be done-“
“I may have found a bomb, but I don’t think it’s a problem,” Scott explained, keeping his voice measured so as not to stress out the rest of the group.
Scott squinted suspiciously at the food before taking a tentative bite of his sub sandwich. When he didn’t immediately get sick, he shrugged and continued, suddenly ravenous. “Ask away.”
The group eventually sat around the table, the meal devolving into a fight for food, though Wanda insisted everyone have the soup first. (“It is tradition- Sam, I see you.)
(One memorable exchange entailed when Tony had popped in for dinner and Steve had insisted on cooking a vegan meal to prove a point.
“That makes a lot more sense. Iron wouldn’t have the right properties at all for the sort of sustained flight and all the beatings you must take in battles,” Scott said thoughtlessly, before he heard what he said and went to apologize for implying that the man took a lot of beatings in fights. But far from offended, he look delighted at Scott’s evident grasp of mechanics.
“Hank Pym already did some clever work to hide your past with him,” Steve explained further.
He cleared his throat awkwardly, catching the attention of enough Avengers that the rest caught the hint to quiet down quick.
“Just your daughter?” Sam questioned gleefully, to which Scott sent him a pleading look.
Scott may be reluctant to join the team, but the Avengers always get their man, and it's best the Ant-Man learns that early.
Scott blinked, genuinely stunned speechless. “How in the world did you guys manage that?”
appreciate it. We want you here to help.”
Scott managed to wring out a smile despite his apprehension, and escaped shortly after, leaving the two to their peaceful canoodling.
“Just to warn you… People will assume I made it, and it will drive Hank up a wall,” Tony said, barely hiding his glee.
“Go ahead, Friday,” Steve ordered firmly.
“If we weren’t both idiots, we wouldn’t be us,” Steve replied, hands dragging down Tony’s back.
“I’m still technically in training too,” Wanda pointed out impatiently, half out of the door.
or account, they are wonderfully funny and write some amazing stuff!
The Russian turned away from the screen (where her character had somehow managed to pin Rhodey’s) and tilted her head slightly in thought. “No, almost never. Mostly it’s ‘Cap’.”
Steve had just informed everyone that it was a “shell game now,” when Scott saw a bomb stick to the shield from his place on Steve’s shoulder. Scott automatically went to clap after Steve flung the shield instinctively into the air, saving the crowd, so he was knocked from his perch on the man’s shoulder when Steve was sucker-punched in the back. Scott rolled when he hit the ground, luckily remembering his training in that regard, and recovered, before sprinting to attack the asshat going after Captain America. Scott had climbed up and was about to try to take down the asshole when he noticed just how easy it would be to fuck up the mechanical arm additions to Rumlow’s suit.
Sam settled on a park bench to watch the citizens of New York go about their business. He had flown into town earlier that day to get coffee from his favorite place and to enjoy the day. He always felt a deep satisfaction in knowing he helped save all the people around him, and when being a superhero got to be a bit too much, he’d go on a walk to remind himself why he did what he did. No matter how awful and difficult the job could be, at the end of the day he did good things. Maybe he could convince Scot that it’d be easier for him to do just that as part of the team. “Yeah. Full membership with all the perks, like a place in the compound and a team that backs you up. I know you care about helping people, anyone can see that just looking at your record, and being an Avenger would make that a lot easier.”
Long before them, there was a man who helped found the nation of Genosha who was said to be so incredibly intelligent he could connect the minds of men together to work as one. He revolutionized human understanding of the body, and set the foundation for sciences that would not truly develop into realms of study until long after his death. Yet despite his powers and mind, he was stripped of the ability to walk in a desperate battle with the person closest to him. The heart cannot be reasoned with the same way, and Xavier learned that young. His hurt and loss had helped him to gain the wisdom to inform his raw intellect, and his nation taught many after him how to best wield their gifts.
“I know you can, but Tony can be stubborn. Are you sure?” Sam knew he meant well, but damn if it wasn’t still a little annoying. The two have been weird around each other since Ultron, especially since Tony hasn’t been around as much.
“Its fine, farm boy, and it no longer matters.” Even after being so disappointed, Tony somehow couldn’t bring himself to lie and say he wasn’t serious about what he said. It physically hurt, now that he knew, to deny how he felt. “Don’t get all guilty and dramatic. Besides, I think I figured out how I could have been so oblivious for so long. It defies expectations that I could be in love with you.  Ha, and when you so clearly have other priorities. Me? In love with my farm hand? What an absurd cliché. Maybe I was ashamed, or maybe it was to protect myself,” Tony said. The tone was somehow airy and scathing, and he hid the kernel of truth in his words underneath layers of sarcasm and rudeness. His heartbreak made it easy for him to pretend Steve hadn’t long ago become too talented at reading him not to see through his bluster.
“Sure thing. Clint Barton is particularly fond of Fruity Pebbles, and despite the fact he no longer resides on the compound, we are kept stocked. He is not alone though, as Natasha Romanoff likes Chocolate Rice Krispies, Captain Rogers prefers oatmeal but will splurge with Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, Sam Wilson likes Frosted Mini Wheats, and so on.”
“Well, I really don’t know how, Tic-Tac. It’s simple: I’m calling you in to join the Avengers,” Sam was wandering Central Park with a coffee in one hand and his phone in the other while he talked to Scott. Convincing the ex-con that he wanted to be a part of the team was proving to be the most difficult aspect in his “Recruit Ant-Man to the Avengers plan” and no, that wasn’t irksome at all.
The team has tentatively recovered post Ultron, with a new strength. There is certainly a noticeable loss without Thor or Bruce around, and Steve and Sam are still on the hunt for Bucky, but the group is just kinda doing their thing. I personally figure that the Avengers would be allowed to operate under incredibly lax oversight the same way Iron Man was able to, with copious Stark Industries sponsorship, but because they were originally under SHIELD, which was barely controlled by the government, they would have to  tolerate a bit of oversight. (Nick would have, of course, accounted for some eventuality as what happened when SHIELD fell.)
Vision disappeared through the walls to follow orders, and Sam went out the door, dishes in the sink.
Scott waited for Steve to wind up for another throw before he threw his ball, but he didn’t account for Natasha’s ability to dodge Steve’s ball. Scott stared at her with dismay as she smirked directly at him and caught his throw. He grew back in size and slumped off to the sidelines, meeting Steve’s eyes, who gave him a sympathetic look before he flipped to avoid a throw from Sam. After another moment, Steve got Sam on the leg with a particularly nice throw, though Natasha had gotten Wanda back in. Scott had just resigned himself to sitting out the last of the game (which had been going on a while now,) when Steve neatly tossed a ball above Natasha to tag Scott back in. Quick as a wink, Scott shrunk and joined up. Natasha had yet to be hit out yet, so Steve was working on tagging her while Scott resumed avoiding Natasha and aiming at Wanda.
“I won’t lie about it. It’s terrifying knowing that your actions could directly bring them pain. I always wish I could bear all the consequences myself. You love them so much but you know there’s a job you have to do and you’re the only one even willing to do it. But that’s sometimes the only thing that brings you home. If you know you have people waiting on you… you can’t fail.”
Tony winked. “Aw, Sam, you figured out my strategy.”
Scott shrugged non-committedly, but she took his silence as the confirmation it was. She nodded solemnly, and he waited for the inevitable lecture. He was surprised when it didn’t come, and she simply said,
And to realize he had been so transparent- it was humiliating.
“And your daughter’s opinion is the most important factor?” Vision had this manner of speaking that was somehow both intimidatingly intense yet completely relaxed. Very measured yet a bit jarring.
I had a bit of a mental block for a while because when I was planning out later chapters for this fic, I was overwhelmed and generally uninspired… I wouldn’t have been able to get myself to write as much as I did without all you lovely commentators and readers! Every bookmark and kudos and word of support boosted my spirits! So thank you!
“Is that a weird thing to ask?”
Steve shrugged. “Okay.” Then stepped aside to let the grinning teammates through.
“Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It's a good target.”
“Secretary of State Ross? You mean Thaddeus Ross got the nomination after all? I hear the guys a dick,” Scott interjected from the doorway.
By now, the natives were gathering in earnest, emboldened by the lack of action in the last few minutes and obviously at least a bit familiar with who the Avengers were. Steve went to meet the cops now massing as well, probably to set up a perimeter and to point them to the assailants, while Wanda stayed with Crossbones, and Sam and Scott waited nearby. Natasha had disappeared, probably to gather the attackers she had downed earlier.
“Thanks for the offer, but I’m good,” Scott said quickly.
“Nicely done, Scott.” Steve strode up. “I was worried for a bit during that second bout, but you obviously retreated a bit to mentally regroup. Taking a step back is often the best course of action if you’re making obvious mistakes while battling a specific opponent or if you’re stuck on a specific problem.”
Sam recovered first and started laughing. Wanda chuckled. “That explains the bombs.”
Tony gave him a look, before the faceplate snapped down and he turned to leave. “Sure, Wilson. Keep me updated. Friday and I will organize whatever you need.”
Scott looked from his uniform to Natasha’s bright hair and then to the famed Scarlett Witch. “Fitting names.”
Sam complied with the order, and Scott watched the bird fly away with almost a covetous look in his eyes. “You have to look at that bird later.”
“You just offer your next choice for movie night. We usually have an order in place, but it shifts,” Sam explained while getting a refill of his water.
Scott barely held himself back from whining at how unfair that was. He’d deny it, but Scott was nosy as all get out. Half of the reasons for why he got into software engineering and then crime was because he didn’t like not knowing what everyone else knew. It got him into trouble, that was for sure, but he also knew a lot of dirty secrets that people would save on their servers, mistakenly thinking it’d be safe from the public's eye. He’d exposed a lot of terrible people that way, and made a lot of enemies. Scott had actually tried to hack into the Stark Industries servers a few times, back before Stark has stopped weapons productions in the company. He had seen some suspicious links between SI and some unsavory company accounts, but the servers were phenomenally well-defended. He had only managed to hack some servers, and it wasn't until SHIELD’s files were released that Scott found the files on Obadiah Stane and the double-dealing. He was one of the people who personally made sure those files caught the public’s eye.
Part of his instinct for stubbornness stemmed from his outright distaste at the mere notion of letting someone else have to suffer, however slightly, by his inaction. He refused to be a burden, or a bystander. Steve was determined to protect everyone he met, at any cost to himself, leading to quite a few fights and the subsequent beatings when he went to town. Steve didn’t win many of these fights, with his unfortunately weak disposition, but that never stopped him from trying. He luckily had an ally in the form of his best friend, James Buchannan Barnes, or Bucky. Bucky would appear, as if summoned by magic, whenever Steve was in a fight caused or not caused by Steve’s actions. (Admittedly, it was often that the fight was initiated by Steve.) As an adult, Bucky had the smirk and confidence that captured attention like nothing else, but he had yet to master that aura when a teen. The casual humor and wry kindness he would become known for throughout his life did surface in childhood, though.
“Yeah sweetheart, them. The heroes want me to help them.”
Steve turned to study Tony, his profile outlined against the sky. The waves crashing in the distance. “You want to see the world?”
Scott grinned. “I already know my movie night pick.”
Hope just sighed. “You and your meddling.”
Scott almost exhaled with relief that Sam was raised as a normal human being.
“Yeah, yeah, Cap, I’m on it. So most of these squatters lack a real scientific background, unless they themselves were the science, so I tried to cram some general info into their heads a while back. Basic computer science, bomb handling, some mechanical engineering and the gist of how their gear works, what a villain’s evil death beam probably does, all that stuff. Actually, quick question, I know you’re already an engineer, but how’s your chemistry and biology?”
But hey, the Avengers throw him a party! Which is pretty cool.
“She’s forcing him to spend time with her when she just shows up. It’s presumptive and selfish.”
“Not quite the same thing, Sam!” But Scott focused back in on his task, proud that his hands weren’t shaking. He was almost on to something.
Scott looked to Sam for confirmation, who shrugged. Scott shuffled. “I don't think so? Sorry, I can’t get into many of the specifics of the suit because Hank forbade it…”
Sam nodded at the closed files. “Any new leads on Barnes for us to follow?”
Not much you can say to refute that.
There was a long moment as they all considered that, but Natasha cut them short. “No, there is too much information about Ant-man in the SHIELD archives dropped to the public. Some investigative reporter will find the old footage of Hank Pym in the suit, and the old military veterans who knew about SHIELD projects will have questions.”
“Actually, never mind. I'll figure it out myself.”
"It won't be the same if you don't train and work with us, especially because our work together helps so much in the field. I mean, not everyone gets to train with two of the best fighters in the history of the planet. That's Captain America and Black Widow, to clarify. But I understand if you don't want to join us at the compound," Sam sighed.
“I like that you’re ignoring the person I’ve known even longer who is currently being sarcastic while literally within a machine. Wait, damn, Tony, we need to-”
“Mom would want him to join.”
“Wanda, just like we practiced.”
There’s a five hour difference between New York and Lagos, so assume it’s a bit after 12 in New York when Scott calls Cassie. Also, disappointingly, the Institute for Infectious Diseases doesn’t exist in Lagos, so I was unable to find the area the battle took place on google maps for better context. Sorry if anything is unclear in that regard.
Scott noted the casual term for her father as a sign of growth to be happy about later, before pressing for more explanation.
He groped around for it, finding it even in his half-asleep state, before clicking answer.
On another continent, there was a woman known only as Elektra to the masses, who kept to the shadows in her quest to rid her hometown of criminals. Despite her many conquests taking place in the dark of night, any could see she possessed beauty rarely seen in humans.
“You don’t need to hear that story, because there’s nothing to tell. I’m serious Cap, don’t ask me again,” Sam groused before leaving to the sound of Steve laughing behind him.
“We are cleared to leave, though it’s been requested I share the account of what happened later,” Steve finished.
“Give me X-ray,” Sam ordered, before smirking at Scott. “I’ll show you my tech if you show me yours.”
Before Scott could press that further, because he had heard about Nick Fury while in prison, after SHIELD collapsed, and was deeply curious about the man so present in all of his hacking endeavors, Rhodes had come over with Steve, local governance seemingly mollified for now.
Sam’s eyes widened, more than a little impressed. “Meaning you’ve gotten through them before?”
Clint was startled into the genuine laugh.
They all tried to speak to him, but Tony’s responses were short and impersonal. He brushed off concern, and laughed cruelly when Rhodey tried to speak of a happy future.
"Or my friends since prison," Scott admitted.
The man stuck a hand out, shaking Scott’s firmly. “Happy Hogan. Head of security for Stark Industries, and Avengers liaison.”
“They're pretty great, Hope, if you want me to introduce you?’He didn’t need to explain the implications of the introduction. Hope had always been better with the ants, and he and Hope both knew she would be an asset to any fighting team.
Steve chuckled. “Gym on, full simulation.”
Steve almost laughed, but schooled his face. “Thank you Scott, but it also means he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out.”
“Who taught you sass? Was it Bucky? Oh, I bet it was Dummy.”
“Well, we can’t let him. We know Hydra’s biggest objective. Same thing they always do. Try to take over the world.”
Steve paused momentarily, as if he hadn’t quite considered Scott’s job yet. “You’re still pretty new to the team, you sure you’re ready?” When Scott faltered, a bit disappointed that Steve didn’t trust his qualifications, Steve quickly continued. “This is no statement against you, it’s just concern over knowing each other’s methods and style.”
<><><><><><>
The TV was on in the living space, with no less than three separate projections also up for people to see. Tony had his head in his hands, massaging his temples, Steve’s arms were folded as he frowned mightily, while Sam and Natasha were huddled around one of the moving projections.
Sam and Wanda had just finished taking care of the opponents outside, and were looking around curiously at where all the ‘explosions’ had stopped going off. Scott grew directly next to them, startling them both.
Steve looked sad, but resolute. “Tony, I want to make my own fortune, not just to grow into my own as an individual to better deserve you, but so we can provide for each other. I can’t make a living off of the one I love’s fortune. Leaving is the best way for me to achieve all of this.”
"Did you... hack the police reports?"
“Tony, your test?” Steve still had that resignedly amused expression from earlier as he refocused the group. (Scott had a feeling he had to do that a lot.)
Her mouth twisted, “That may also be what the shareholders are thinking.”
robots
At night, more often than not, they would congregate in the dark beyond his window and laugh about him. Tony would laugh right back at their vapid manner. Usually the laughter would give way to insult. He reminded himself of their failings, and ignored them. If they grew too damaging, Steve would come out from his lodging, and clear them out. He had grown considerably since the days he would start fights in town he had no hope of winning, and the, now quite rare, times he needed assistance, Bucky was a stronger fighter than he.
Scott briefly considered just how epic that entire exchange was before setting off to take more hostiles down. “I’ve got your back, Wanda. Go for the others, Sam!”
Once the situation was explained to them, the cops started dispersing, with a few remaining for crowd control. Natasha reappeared around that time with several men slung over her shoulders. She dropped her load at the feet of the startled police before going to meet the media and reporters now arriving to the scene.
“A new shield?”
“You’ve always wanted to have all his attention! Always saying he needs to unwind and be distracted. What is it really? What’s changed-”
Scott really doesn't always intend to eavesdrop, sometimes it just... Happens!
“No, I need to get this sorted, before the season- ha, I made a pun there, sorted-”
And well. The Parkers were quite taken with Tony, and by the generous salary Peter would earn. Tony was nearly impossible to stop when he had an idea, and Peter quickly learned it was best to go along with the schemes. He came to the farm a few days after Tony met him, and when Jarvis showed him the farmhouse, he was briefly stunned at how quick everything changed.
When Scott heard “you’re coming with me,” he decided that that phrase was probably Rumlow's planned line before he set off the explosive. Steve and Rumlow were both still, the former because his villainous opponent had acted dramatic and clicked something, and the latter because what he pulled out didn’t work. Scott grinned, tore out another couple of cords he had noticed, and avoided the metal supports as the structure locked in place.
Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “I’m pretty sure I can explain it just as well as you.”
“Of all the characters to compare us to,” Sam said mournfully.
I had planned to have this fic address the batshit insanity of the 2016 election, if even peripherally, but it occurred to me that Feige had the President and politicians replaced with fictional characters. I’m bitter about it, but because Ross wouldn’t have been appointed by Obama, most likely, I’m going to have to pretend like Obama hadn’t been President, and ignore a lot of broad political discourse accordingly. (This does not mean I won’t sometimes include famous people or events, cause I can’t help myself. Scott would hate the government, so it’s justifiable!)
“I guess, I'm just wondering, um. If Tony could have dated someone else? Other than Ms. Potts?”
Steve felt color rise to his cheeks, damn his pale complexion, and tried again. “Tony, thank-”
Tony’s lip twitched up with amusement, before he took off his fancy red sunglasses and shook Scott’s hand. “Nice to meet you, Ant-Man, I’m Iron Man.” His brown eyes were warm as they met Scott, and while he was amused, the look wasn’t mean or mocking. He had a strong, confident handshake, and Scott had to firmly remind himself to let go off the man’s hand after he stood there shaking it for a while.
“I don’t know, but-
Tony let out a muttered curse, and rubbed his eyes, weary. “And it’s Tuesday today. Yeah, tell her I’ll get to it tonight. I need to work on the new compound right now.” His voice gained strength as he focused back in on the data lighting up around him.
Natasha’s mouth quirked into something wry and fond. “Nick Fury.”
“Cap, you don’t have some sort of monopoly on talking to Tony about important things like this. Or a monopoly on arguing with him. I really don’t think he’ll have a problem with it if you say it’s okay,” Sam said pointedly.
“And finally, I can also help Hank Pym on missions when he needs me.”
And well. That was that, apparently.
He decided it was best to just leave them alone, and pretended there wasn’t an ache in his heart when he avoided Steve. This meant he didn’t quite see the confusion and longing in Steve’s eyes when Steve was rebuffed or outright ignored, but meant he did get deeper and deeper into a foul mood, colored by his self-loathing.
Tony stammered embarrassedly, but his quiet, “Thanks,” was sincere.
Scott shrugged. “Didn’t get as good a grasp on them this time.”
Jarvis would get mail from Tony, and as such, Steve was not completely unknown to him. This did not mean he was easy to convince that Steve should get to see his grandson. After much begging, and after checking with Tony, Jarvis reluctantly let the boy in.
“You help people already!” Hank was not willing to give this up yet, but Hope was there to back her boyfriend up.
Scott froze in place, world narrowing in focus until all Scott saw was red. He would
“Well duh, you’re a hero too, and they need the best,” Cassie’s tone was matter-of-fact and exasperated, obviously annoyed that her Dad was being dense. “You’re going to join, right?”
“Stark? As in Howard Stark?” Tiberius and Rumiko shared a significant look at the news.
“What should I be expecting with these? What are their specs and capabilities?”
“I can try! But we’re still working on vapors and smokes, and this is much higher velocity-“
Steve nodded at Scott. “Well done. Did you disable the arm mechanisms as well?”
“There he is, late as usual,” Steve commented dryly. Scott almost expected him to frustrated, but if anything Steve seemed amused, though resigned.
“Hey, I didn’t know about the bug thing until he explained it to me when asking if he can keep ants in the house,” Sam said defensively.
Crossbones had been spitting rage at Steve and Wanda, and then at Sam when Sam came up and joined the duo hovering threateningly over him, but broke off and stared at Scott after hearing mention of “his tech.”
Steve chuckled. “To a general degree. We’re still in the dark about Crossbones’s plan though, and Sam and Natasha spent most of it bickering.”
Steve nodded. “Anything else major?
“So she didn’t want her title, big deal.”
Steve looked impressed. “This is the VistaCorp hacker you’re talking about?”
“Yeah,
“Are you joking? Ten of me isn’t worth one of you! We have always been equals and I don’t care about a fortune! For money we could just marry into nobility, or make weapons, or sell the farm! Besides, why must you leave me? Why can’t you make your fortune here?”
When Rhodey finally got his conscription letters, as he was a couple of years older than Tony and quite eligible to join the army, Tony begged him not to go. It turned into a bitter fight, Rhodey reminding Tony that he didn’t have a choice and could actually make a decent penny in the army, and Tony reminding him that he could die before ever receiving the kind of promotion that would actually earn him anything substantial. When Rhodey insisted Tony couldn’t prevent this, Tony fled and hid with Dum-E in the barn all night. His grief didn’t stop him from bidding his best friend off, though, and Rhodey couldn’t help his relief when Tony said goodbye.
Sam knocked on Steve’s door frame and the blonde absently waved him in from where he was sitting poring over some ancient, probably still highly classified reports. Sam wandered in, waiting by Steve’s desk for the man to finish what he was reading. Steve let out a disappointed sigh before closing the file and looking up with a half-hearted smile at Sam. “Hey, what can I do for you?”
No one would have had any question who he meant, and Bucky barely managed to contain his exasperation, reminding himself how dense they both were. “Never.”
“Good,” Steve said, jokingly stern, before continuing. “If he ends up accepting the invitation, he’ll need to go through a sort of trial period with the team to make sure he can handle being an Avenger and won’t hurt the team dynamic in any way. That means I’ll have to put him through the paces and up against some of the others.”
He tolerated their final giggles with a rueful expression before the plane quieted. Natasha flicked through some other files on the console, now that their discussion was seemingly on hold till the rest of the team was gathered, Steve gave the map another long, hard stare before irritably shutting it off, and Sam tugged out his phone distractedly, grinning at the message he found. “Friday says Scott is making himself at home in the compound, and met Tony earlier today.”
Tony nodded, and got up. “Great, I’ll read it on my way back to New York.”
“It won’t hurt you, Steve?” Scott asked, even as he flipped a man while tiny.
Steve and Bucky had gone on many missions, specifically to destroy Hydra forces. On one of their missions, Bucky was captured by Red Skull’s personal platoon. Red Skull was the head General of Hydra, and a repulsive, hateful psychopath who reportedly captured and experimented on soldiers. When Bucky explained he lost his arm in their camp, Tony was deliriously grateful the man returned at all. Steve led a covert force that destroyed the camp in the mountains of Prussia, and recused all the prisoners.
“Don’t worry, he won’t even know you’re here”
He bounced on the balls of his feet before feeling himself being picked up. Scott doubted he’d get used to the feeling of being lifted and flung anytime soon. The air travel got him to Natasha quickly though, that’s for sure.
“They always inevitably end up calling me Rhodey after exposure to Tony, so I’m trying this thing where I make it look like  it was always my idea,” Rhodey’s voice was drier than the Sahara, but his eyes betrayed his amusement.
“Trusting myself got me into this mess,” Tony muttered disparagingly.
Scott squirmed.
“To be blunt, you're going to go through a few tests, so we can see how you fight and think,” Natasha finished.
It was possibly because of Tony’s natural aptitude and brilliance with machines that his father disliked him so. It seems ridiculous to believe a father would be envious and resentful of his own son, but Howard Stark was the right kind of arrogant to lash out at the boy, already so intelligent and talented with their craft when he was but an adolescent. But while his father would mock and disparage his son, he was almost loving towards the orphan boy that worked on their farm. Steve Rogers was orphaned at the young age of 8, after losing his mother to disease. His father had died a few years prior to his wife’s death when at war for the king. He and Howard had been friends, originally making their acquaintance when the engineer and metallurgist outfitted the elder Rodgers for a new set of armor. So, after the death of his mother, Steven sought out the man his mother said would be able to find work for him, and was given a place working the fields and taking care of the animals. Howard liked the boy and his work ethic, and would often compare Tony’s easily distracted and unfocused style of labor to Steve’s concentrated and meticulous efforts.
Iron Man’s faceplate popped up. “Am I late?”
Scott mused.
Wanda rolled her eyes fondly at Vision before explaining. “My powers allow me to propel me upwards and over distances, similar to levitation or flight.”
"Jets. Plural."
“So you wouldn’t object to inviting him despite the record?” Sam double-checked.
Now Steve’s expression closed off. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Wanda just grunted sleepily. (Scott wasn’t offended, Maggie had always hated mornings too, so he knew the type.)
When Rhodey appeared at Jarvis’s behest and got Tony to eat, Tony thought of how Steve could pick up languages easily, and fix inventions Tony never designed to be accessible.
“Does everyone have a day?”
“You want me to be honest?”
“How’d Friday get all that information so soon?” Scott asked Sam wearily, still shaken from Rumlow’s obvious threat but trying to distract himself. “Can we always talk to her in the comms?”
Anyways! Sorry for the delay and the short length, but I just wanted to write something and publish it to feel like I made progress. Beta’d by dontcallmeking as usual. Merci!
He finally turned back to face Steve fully, so Scott couldn’t see his face anymore, but his voice was a little too relaxed. “We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.”
Steve had become famous for his tendency to get into brawls, and one day caught the eye of the rich noble from a couple towns over who had come to one of their trading partner’s festivals in a show of goodwill. It was a spring festival, this year dedicated to the veterans of the kingdom’s many conflicts. Steve overheard a man mock a disabled fighter just returned from battle, and turned to him, without a moment of hesitation, to take him on. He probably could have approached the conflict differently, but calling the offender a “gutless, wretched excuse for a human” and challenging him to a fist fight was very in character for the boy.
Sam frowned a bit, but didn’t interrupt this time. The others wouldn’t love that, Tony especially, but it wasn’t really unfair.
“This is ridiculous, he has a high-tech suit and an A.I. to help him in the field!” Scott snarled, even as he was quickly unraveling wires and reading through the complex source code. Hacking was really not a process that should be rushed.
“Bruce is sensible and polite!”
Tony’s tone seemed oddly brittle when he responded. “You don’t need to
“Oh, we are making a reference to the movie, I understand now,” Vision said in an aside to Wanda and Scott.
“Few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to muck up Hydra. And then Ultron, my fault. And then, and then, and then.”
“I can shrink and wait at the station?” Scott offered, but Steve shook his head. “Honestly, I agree with what Tasha said earlier, and am not yet sold on the station actually being his target. Instead, you'll stay on the roof with Sam. He can drop you off where you’re needed when that becomes clear."
James Rhodes touched down in Lagos right as Wanda had lifted the last trussed up prisoner into the local precinct’s final truck, going right away to Steve, who had paused his conversation and gestured Rhodes over. Scott took the time to covetously admire the War Machine suit from a distance.
Steve shook his head. “Always with the flashy exits.”
When he stopped in the middle of the room, the others kept walking towards the door sent in the opposite wall. Seeing Scott had halted, Steve paused and gestured him further. “We’re using the second gym today.”
<><><><><><>
Tony shook his head wordlessly.
“Both of the cross streets are one-way, so his escape routes are compromised,” Scott added thoughtfully.
Finals are almost upon me, so I finished this in a, probably unwise, hurry so it wouldn’t be lurking in my subconscious during finals. Sorry for the delay, as usual, I wish I was more prompt...
That succeeded in stopping him. “What?”
Steve paused at where an interface has appeared in the center. “I guess you hadn’t asked Friday about this room. This is the simulation gym, which was designed to be very flexible and easily altered to represent scenarios. We do a lot of team training in here.  For today, each team member came up with a training method, and then Natasha and I approved all the exercises. We often play games like dodgeball, capture the flag, laser tag-“
“I remember some guys in the VA who did not have nice things to say about Ross. The word is he’s one of those officers who doesn’t care much for the enlisted guys,” Sam added.
“Thank you… for letting Scott join us and putting him up. He’s already saved lives today,” Steve said seriously. (The newbie figured the pride he felt when he heard that was definitely understandable and well-founded.)
Just then the group came upon the newest addition to the team. He was half inside the wall, apparently deep at work deconstructing or constructing something, (it was honestly impossible to tell) and surrounded by tools and the remains of what was probably the main compound server.
After an admirable attempt on Sam’s part, Scott was up to play.
Scott laughed despite himself. “I think I heard air quotes.”
“I make seven hostiles,” Steve snapped.
“Ah, but what if I appreciate him more?” Tony found himself unable to respond to that with composure, and he would tell himself the pain was from his fury at not being able to voice a comeback.
“I should probably introduce myself formally too, and not just as my superhero identity. Tony Stark, but just call me Tony,” he said, to which Scott automatically countered,
“What do you mean you
“I can always watch it later. How’d he do on everything?”
“Can I take this as permission to invite him?” Sam inquired with a small smile.
He knew logically, somewhere in the back of his mind where he wasn’t devastated, that something must have happened between the door closing and him reaching his room, but he could barely think past the choking disappointment and anguish.
“I drank it in the kitchen,” Scott said absently before returning to his seat next to the man. “Anything happen here?”
Steve couldn’t help his overwhelmed smile. “Well, you gave me a home. I’ll be lost without you.”
They promptly destroyed all the weapons or threw them overboard.
See, when he hit his fifteenth year, Tony realized that the reason few would interact with him closely was due to jealousy, resentment, and his perceived arrogance. His casual reaffirmation of his intellectual superiority was understandably infuriating to some but he was so charming, despite his moments of abrasiveness, that he was still popular. His humor was almost never intended to wound or harm and he underestimated his own fortitude in the face of the slights and jabs said at his expense. His constant stream of sharp banter was as intimidating as it was amusing, but even if he toned down his words for the sake of others, it was his overall appeal that actually ensured his isolation. He was too engaging and brilliant, and resented for it. There were many who admired and desired him, but few who would reach out to him with aims of friendship. As he learned that people would smile at him just as soon as they’d spit curses behind his back, he learned to distract and amuse, never taking what people he couldn’t trust too seriously.
Wanda gave her leader a wry smile as she flipped her boot over to dump the water out. “Very. We routed the serpent and limited causalities to zero. We did lose one robot, but we sent Tony the update on our way back.
He fell back on the bed and grinned. “Hey sweetheart. Guess who was right about the Avengers being nice?”
Around one, Scott wandered into the kitchen where Wanda was reading and Vision was watching the TV through the door to the living room, volume playing low.
Sam chuckled dryly. “I guess you’ll never know if you don’t join the squad.”
He gaped. “First stage?”
“The good captain is quite right, Scott. Though if you’re concerned, you will likely have your gear on many of your missions," Vision parroted.
“Just let the man come!” Sam yelled, already down the hall.
“That’s all the rules there are?” Scott questioned.
Clint almost cackled, and Scott beamed.
Sam and Nat shared a look. “You would know a thing or two about that,” Sam said.
Steve had been so overwhelmed by the travel and the bright boy talking as if his world hadn’t fallen apart, that he reacted poorly to the attempt at friendship. He needed the time to recover, without being reminded that life goes on, with or without loved ones.
“Can you, though?” Natasha’s bored reply obviously got Rhodes in a tizzy, and they started bickering good-naturedly.
“Well, Scott, I know we all trust Sam’s judgment, and he didn't mention you to us lightly. Also, both Tony and Nat are very good at researching or reading a person, respectively,” Steve obligingly explained.
Natasha cleared her throat pointedly.
Steve smiled quietly (which Scott hadn’t even realized was possible) when Friday said that before he sighed.
Tony crooked an eyebrow, amused by her almost against his will, and incorrectly assuming all of her interest was on Steve. (But of course, his mind didn’t register it as Steve being every attractive, nor did he fully investigate how his mind couldn’t comprehend not being intrigued by the man.) “I must admit I cannot take all the credit. Steve here is one of our longest working farmhands, and is a superb worker. Why not ask him to show us?”
But Tony? He’s confusing as all get-out for Sam.
Tony thought despairingly.
The man in question obligingly flew down to kick the man in the face. “Three,” Sam said coolly.
A pleasant flight later, and Scott was peeling himself off the bench to trudge out the jet back into the Avengers compound.
Jarvis’s smile was pained to those who knew him, and Tony started preparing for the inevitable lecture later. “Yes, this is Anthony Stark.”
He had dug into a new level of the mainframe to start testing some codes when Friday politely invited him to join the team in the common area for some news.
“Go now.” As soon as Steve gave the command, Scott was shrinking down and climbing onto Sam’s suit. “You on?”
A couple hours later, and the group reassembled in the kitchen, following the scent of warm curry.
“No one gets the details of the Pym Particle but me,”
A couple days before Rhodey left, and while Tony was still sullenly hiding in the workshop to hide his terror for his best friend, the future soldier made a trip to Steve and Bucky’s bunk. Steve had just started studying his numbers for the evening, but gladly put his stuff away for the older boy. (A man, really, if he had to put his life on the line for a cause.) Rhodey asked Steve to watch out for Tony, and advised him on what to do in certain scenarios. Steve promised him he would do as he was asked, and was grateful for Rhodey’s foresight when, within the month after he left, it had circulated around town that Tony’s protector had abandoned him. It wasn’t a surprise to Tony when the boys and girls from town would appear to jeer at him, though he was frustrated that Rhodey had hidden the fact he often warded harassment away from the same person he was protecting.
“Why did you not tell me?”
Tiberius was delighted by the growth, of course, though he came by less often when the Prince insisted on him coming by more. Peggy would sometimes appear instead. She and Tony developed an easy rapport once Peggy made quite clear to Tony that she was not the sort of person who would hold being rejected against him, and Tony apologized for how jealous he had been. They grew to be true friends, with inside jokes and favorite topics. (Tony was irritated at a weak national infrastructure, Peggy with a terrible military organization, and both of them worried for their friends abroad.) She received letters too, and the duo loved to make fun of the travelers and share stories.
“Basically, we have eyes everywhere and a healthy respect for people who favor death defying acts of heroism as a solution to their problems,” Tony supplied, returned from his argument with Rhodey, which had really only ended after some childish scuffling that left Tony’s hair even more crazed.
“Thank you, Friday,” Scott said, and Friday responded cheerfully. “My pleasure. The boss set up a permanent algorithm to watch out for and stop any investigation into your past and family.”
tighter than necessary.
“I don’t know if you guys know this, but the last time I did an interview I got dragged off screen by prison guards.”
“I think Sam is actually Pegasus in this metaphor, since Steve is Hercules and Tony is Meg,” Scott corrected automatically, before freeing when Natasha and Sam halt in their terrorizing of Tony to focus on Scott, amusement obvious on their faces.
great
Tony piped up from next to Vision. “She may be terrifying, but the poker is still fun.”
“You’re free to sit wherever, it’s not a required set up,” Steve reminded Scott gently and Sam pointedly, (Scott wasn’t going to analyze how he managed that), but Scott had already sat next to Sam and didn’t want to change. (Oddly enough, the seat he was offered was the one he had been sitting in when eating alone.)
Scott thought about the alternative of squinting into a screen until it was time to call Cassie before bed and figured he may as well bond with his teammates now. He might even get some new information!
Then Bucky came back home.
The two walked down the ramp together and just stood at the bottom watching Steve escape. Sam threw his hands in the air. “I give up.”
“But it’s how you’ll fix it,” Bucky said firmly.
“I think you forgot to mention, “talks to insects” earlier,” Steve noted dryly, and Scott winced. “I genuinely don’t know how I forgot I could do that.”
“Rhodey, I can buy you more curry, I can buy you a restaurant, hell, I can buy the
“I put kale in my smoothies!”)
“He didn’t get ki- caught by Hydra?” Tony took the news of their battles with admirable grace, cause while he had interjected the story periodically with horror or fury that Steve had lied about his actions in some letters, Steve becoming a key player and defeating a monstrous general seemed completely in character.
Luis was tearful when he gave Scott his hug, Kurt gave him a solemn pat on the shoulder and a bizarre, Russian non-sequitur, and Drew tried a final time to wheedle directions to the compound out of Scott.
Scott shook his head. “What happened to subtlety?”
Steve went around, gently getting Tony more comfortable and feeding Dummy, (one of the only reasons Jarvis let Steve in was because Dummy didn’t really remember Jarvis and was suspicious of new arrivals when his master was in such a state.) Sometime later, when Steve thought Tony had fallen asleep, Tony spoke in a wavering voice. “Does it ever hurt less?”
A day long after Anthony will have died, the most brilliant human on the planet will be a lady called Lunella, who had matched wits with the masters and befriended an extinct lizard. She had mastered the physical form, changed mechanical engineering as a science, and figured out how to switch and meld minds with those different from her, all while still a child. Her endless intellect was matched by her genuine kindness.
“I was invited to join the Avengers, and I think I’m going to accept,” Scott said simply.
“Why would I let you know I need to talk to Sam?”
“I just disarmed the bomb, guys. It won’t go off if triggered now.
“So if Wanda sleeps in, where’s Natasha?” Scott had a hard time imagining the woman sleeping in.
“That is a good one.”
Natasha spoke up again. “Before we begin, can you elaborate a bit more on your gear and abilities?”
“What?” Wanda sounded understandably blindsided by the new developments.
Wanda dropped down a moment later, quickly deflecting bullets and immobilizing another opponent. “Sam.”
“There are never enough superheroes, ” Sam was solemn as memories of Tony’s shoulders slumped in defeat, the way Natasha will sometimes stop and stare in the direction of Bruce’s rooms, and the nights where Wanda will cry out in her sleep for someone who can’t respond all flashed through his head. Scott was struck by the tone in Sam’s voice, and the words came out before he could stop them.
“She’s a distraction from his work and he already works too hard.”
Scott turned his head to look at Wanda. “Can you contain those explosions at all?”
But before Scott could celebrate, Tony’s grin turned manic. “And in our lives, we have to perform under extreme pressure.”
Hope stared him down, but her glare had lessened when he clearly recognized his overstep. “You’ll ask him yourself?”
“My suit’s goggles has tech installed that allows Friday to analyze what I see and do things like identify assailants,” Sam explained. “And she has her own communication line to access us, you just need to address her. Right, Friday?”
Before they could be side-tracked by Scott struggling to explain his emotional state to Vision. Natasha cut in. “You’re ready for the next test.”
“I will not forget the betrayal of all those who stood by,” Tony blustered further, extricating himself and retreating to his counter perch. “And after I bring you food!”
He exhaled, and let himself slide down to the ground. “I’m much better now. Can I talk to Cassie?”
“Whether it’s trusting Clint after Loki, bringing in Sam… Letting in Wanda…” He shrugged nonchalantly after mentioning Wanda, but Scott had a feeling that Tony didn’t even manage to fool himself with his forced casualness. “Your judgement in people is impeccable.”
“It’s fine, they’re used to my withholding,” Tony said breezily, but Steve frowned.
Steve stared long and hard at the holographic map in front of him. All of Crossbones recent targets were lit up and flashing specifics on the attacks in order to help the team try to figure out some sort of pattern. He crossed his arms and murmured, “What’s his plan here? Why these targets?”
Scott’s cereal fell off his spoon/
Sam made a face at Natasha, who smiled prettily at him with an air of innocence no one who knew her would buy.
“Yeah, he’s being interviewed by the Senate this week. What exactly did you hear about him?” Sam asked as Steve gestured Scott to join them around the TV.
“The name is James Rhodes, but you can call me call me Rhodey.”
Just then, Wanda caught up to them, promptly adding her powers to holding Crossbones down. “I have him Captain, you can let go. You guys all okay?”
“I could never stay away.”
“What if you said it’s your superpower?” Sam cut in.
“We were attacked by the Dread Pirate Fury.”
The truck crashing through the barricade at the Institute of Infectious Diseases answered his question quickly enough.
The two would bicker for half an hour more, but the second Hope pulled the mom card, the war was won. Scott sat back and let them hash out the details around him. These lunches with both of them were exhausting, despite their improved relationship and their work on finishing Hope’s suit. When she started superheroing, Scott absently wondered if the Avengers would recruit her to replace him when she revealed herself to the world. She was already so good at fighting, and the day she’d kick evil’s collective ass was rapidly approaching. But then Sam’s comment on never having enough heroes flashed through his mind, and he knew that they wouldn’t get rid of him if he kept doing what he was doing and kept saving people. They’ll recruit Hope too, in a heartbeat, but they need all the heroes they can get.
"Comprehensive training," Vision said earnestly.
Scott had dozed off for a while and finally felt recovered enough to think about venturing out for food when his phone started buzzing gently next to his head.
Scott waited her out, and Hope sighed when she saw he wouldn’t go without an answer.
“Likewise. I mean, I’m happy to be on your team,” Scott stumbled. Vision was the last to step up.
Steve laughed. “Hey, a draw is better than a loss.
"It's also bulletproof, which means private security... which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us,” Natasha said sardonically.
“Then why don’t we go see some of these famed inventions!” Tiberius eagerly latched on to the subject.
Steve's face cleared with understanding. “Oh, Pinky and the Brain. I got it.”
“Yes Tony, you’re brilliantly funny and because of that I know you’ll figure this out tomorrow, but right now-”
It's hard not to be won over by compassion like that. Scott could only remember feeling accepted in his entirety so rapidly a couple of occasions before. (Mostly Luis, and then Kurt and Dave when he met them too.)
Scott only shrugged helplessly. After a moment, her driver politely asked if she was coming and she considered Scott. “Be careful.”
“Call me Tony. Want a job?"
*rises from the dead*
“That’s not how facing villains works,” Sam informed Scott cheerfully.
In the present, he dozed for a long while after his customary call to Cassie, made much longer by his conversing with Maggie
Vision reappeared in the room, now outfitted appropriately. “May I ask if your mission was successful?”
Sam practically giggled from where he had been avoiding Vision’s projectiles in the sky. “This game is so much better than I remembered.”
With all the information and instructions they were given, the time it took to get to Lagos passed pretty quickly.
more than fine. “We have nothing in common, and he’s been avoiding me because he doesn’t like me. Or he’s avoiding another argument.”
“Very good, Vis,” Wanda praised. “And no. I appreciate it Scott, but I can’t have the new member cooking for his own welcome party. The food will be ready around 6.”
Gone, the defender of the meek. Gone, the man with endless love in his heart. Gone, the orphan boy who wore his heart on his sleeve. His protector. His friend. His rival. The one who pushed him to be better, but loved him anyways when he wasn’t. Steve.
“Have been informed of what happened. Mr. Stark is working on a press release and requested to speak to you, Captain, and I am working on reaching Colonel Rhodes now. Vision inquired if he would be needed.”
“Well…” Scott winced. The coding had several kill switches to the server programmed in, and the whole system seemed to have been set to self-destruct. After another moment spent flicking through the code, Scott decided he was incredibly glad he had brought some of his ants to wait in the server with him in case he needed them. He didn’t have the time to pick carefully through, nor did he have any programs with him he could use, so he figured he could just mess up the hardware. He turned away from the screen and instead started digging through the wires around him, locating and carefully checking the circuit boards.
“I appreciate the sentiment, but assure you that won’t happen,” Friday sounded amused.
“Is that good news, Scott?” Wanda questioned hopefully.
Scott had just hung up with Cassie the next morning when his car arrived in New York to get coffee with Hope. He was luckily not hungover, despite how he didn’t drink often and had gotten pretty tipsy the night before, (he was allowed, it was his welcome party to the
Natasha looked amused. “You did. But I also hit you. It’s a tie.”
“That doesn’t seem too bad,” Scott said easily, turning to look at Natasha. He was actually quite observant of his surroundings, both from his cat burglar days and from having to watch his back in prison.
Check out their
Tony stared at him a long time, and Steve observed with fascination how sharp his gaze was through the stupor. Satisfied Steve wasn’t pitying him or disgusted, he drank the water and let Steve catch the glass to keep it from breaking.
Their fearless leader grinned and nodded. “You can’t avoid some traditions.”
“I already do.” Sam was still laughing when Scott turned off the phone.
Wanda’s smile turned wicked. “I can’t wait for you to try it, especially since it will take me
“What can I say, I’ll be on the side of the robots when they take over. I’m endearing myself to them.”
The Avengers are reassembling, issues and all, to greet their new teammate, and Scott's gonna have to meet them head on. Well, that was his plan, at least. Being the new guy always sucks, but at least Friday seems nice!
Tony waved off thanks before Scott could give it. “It’s fine, it’s the least we could do to protect your daughter.”
No one sensed the change on the horizon, and some three years later, nobles came to Stark farm.
“If they even ask?” Scott asked hopefully. He didn’t think Hank would like any of this.
“It’s my fault he’s gone. He left for me.”
When the robot was sparking on the ground, Scott swayed a bit and gustily exhaled. “Man, I hate to destroy nice tech.”
“Do you always have late nights like last night?” Scott asked curiously, passing the milk to Steve, who was eating oatmeal.
When he woke, Bucky croaked out Tony’s name and pulled his chair closer. Tony tried to shape the words to apologize for… for a lot of things.  Maybe for not making him a shield too, for not going with them, for how he reacted- but Bucky stopped him.
Jarvis bowed as propriety dictated, and when Steve seemed as if he wasn’t going to move, Jarvis gracefully straightened and addressed the irreverent man to avoid further rudeness. “Steve, why not fetch Anthony to greet our guests.”
“Aw, he thinks he’s the one doing the manipulating,” Natasha said.
Everyone's kudos and comments warmed my heart! I hope this official first chapter meets your high expectations!
“Your opponent has been programmed to slightly emulate various forms of martial arts, with an emphasis on practical military forms. It may try to shit you with modified repulsor tech eventually. Square up with it, and get ready to fight!”
“Oh, okay,” Steve obligingly started his own name, and when he finished, Tony nodded approvingly. “There. You’ve already got it. Told you it’d be easy!”
Tony patted him on the shoulder. “Smart kid, and easily done. What do you all say, pose with Scott for his daughter?”
Do you know much about the inventions of these foreign countries, and I love you no matter what.
“Morning, Tic-Tac,” Sam smiled sleepily, though still warmly.
Natasha patted Steve on the back as she went to grab her own stuff. “He did do quite well in dodgeball.”
Scott gave her a weak smile and she looked to the heavens for help. “Of course not, you'll dig it up instead with those damn puppy dog eyes. The internet has more info on the avengers, and on Stark in particular, than even you can get through.”
He wrote essays of love back, and while he knew he couldn’t send any until Steve gave him a fixed address, he knew Steve would be happy to read them.
“What does that say about your own lives?” Scott countered.
“Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature,” Natasha continued, unperturbed. “Even for someone who isn’t easily seen.”
Natasha wheeled her chair around at this to give Steve a truly incredulous look. “The man turns into the Hulk because of an experiment he performed on himself, and listens to Tony on making things like Ultron.”
The punch that sent Scott flying back really shouldn’t have been a surprise, at this point in the day. Scott would admit that his first bout with the robot was won mostly by his confusing the robot with the powers it had never seen before. He couldn’t exactly startle the robot as effectively the second time, and he almost lost that round, but won after sneaking under some plating and ripping out a chip. Third bout he found a weak spot in the robot and snapped several obvious key connections in the suit from the beginning, before going large to break the robot at all its weakened sections.
Scott had so many questions he couldn't think of a single one. “Yeah, I do. But where do I even begin?”
“That’s the end of Natasha’s trial. You can ask for more of our thoughts on all of these tests later, but for now we’re going to move on. Rhodey is currently doing something covert and important, but he requested we make his apologies and wish you the best of luck on the obstacle course,” Steve pleasantly explained.
“You seem like a lot of fun, Scott. Good luck with that madhouse over there,” Clint said after he finished answering Scott’s last question.
“Really?”
“That means you have to come back.”
He hung up after this proclamation, and Scott took a moment to process the conversation in the aftermath.
But it was also to be expected that Tony would not handle the news well. Jarvis barely stopped Tony from taking a boat to try to stop Steve, and if Rhodey hadn’t been home on a rare vacation, Tony probably still would have managed to sneak away. As it was, the two convinced Tony that he’d never make it to the country before Steve had already been moved as part of the military.
“It already harvests everything, it just doesn’t sort too well yet,” Steve explained.
“That’s so cool, Daddy! Did you save the day again?”
“I’m not sure whether to be disappointed that this is apparently a regular thing you all do, or to be pleased by your comments,” Scott admitted wryly.
“I was always the same, Steve.” Tony laughed, breathless and joyous. “I constantly build things for you.”
“And here I thought they were here for the melons,” Tony turned to whisper to Jarvis and Steve, but stopped short when he saw Steve looking at Peggy. He had a gentle smile, and returned Peggy’s acknowledging nod. Steve was pleased by this lady who seemed kind to Tony and exasperated with selfish nobles, but the specific smile Tony thought was for her was still lingering from their conversation and from Tony’s mere presence beside him.
Scott pretended to consider that. “Technically Cassie convinced me. And maybe Friday.”
Steve walked up to the door, clear eyed and alert like only he could be in the morning, and his curiosity shifts into blatant surprise. “Tony? Why are you up so early, are you okay?”
“I love American Ninja Warrior!” Wanda exclaimed brightly before blushing bright red when the rest of the team stared at her with varying expressions of amused surprise.
A plan had just formed in his mind when Scott realized, with growing horror, that Steve had taken his eyes off of Natasha to tag Wanda when she dropped her guard. Natasha noticed. He knew he wouldn’t reach Steve in time to take the hit for him, so he figured he could follow his hunch and hide behind a ball while Natasha wasn’t looking. He chose one with another ball directly next to it, according to plan. He heard the smack and knew Steve had been hit.
“In a manner of speaking,” Vision intoned.
Tony could not remember ever being so happy, and only the prospect of this ending could bring him down. But despite Tony’s continued dismay, Steve’s stubbornness won out and the day of the departure neared.
ules, right Stark?” Wanda snarked behind her mug.
“Nah, I think it’d take more crazy than that to scare him off. The dude works for Hank Pym and is friends with a guy who was thrown in jail for stealing smoothie machines. Or maybe he’s just bad at convincing crazy to stay away from him…” Sam trailed off thoughtfully.
“I’ll be homesick,” Steve admitted easily.
“Hey, you owe me,” Sam insisted with a smirk.
“You can ask them that later,” Sam answered sardonically.
When Peggy hadn’t received letters either and appeared with dead eyes and news of a series of vicious battles in the mountains and at sea, Tony thought about the times they had gone to the coast and Steve swam like a fish.
Because his life wasn't quite normal, Tony ended up discovering his new recruit on accident. He was visiting a town where he installed a particularly complicated clock into the tower that needed his specific skills to fix. He had just gotten back to the stables when he heard the distinct sound of a spring releasing and then a bird squawking. He searched for the source of the sound and found a teenager with a, seemingly homemade, catapult and some netting. As the boy busied himself with retrieving the bird he caught, Tony investigated the contraption, pleased by the ingenuity in it. It was a very efficient and shockingly small catapult, and from how far away the bird was, he had rigged it to fire off weighted nets.
“Hello there. Are you the owner of this farm?” Tiberius stopped a scant few steps from the porch, but Jarvis remained polite despite the invasion of the farm without warning.
“God, farm boy, you’re so difficult. It’s not a big deal.”
Scott took Rumlow’s roar of fury to be his next cue and climbed back out of the contraption to grow in size. “See, I told you it wouldn’t go off!”
"If they're lucky," Scott winked.
“Sam, I used to be the United States’ top weapons producer. Ellis was the one who knew me."
“I love it. And I love you.”
“Petty rivalry? Howard Stark was an egomaniac and a bully, traits I have seen too many times in his son as well. Organizations they are a part of, no matter how well-intentioned, fall to corruption,” Hank furiously exclaimed.
“As long as you’re saying all this from an objective standpoint. You’ve never made mistakes like that, right?” Hope persisted in arguing with her Dad, but Scott could tell she saw merit to her Father’s objections. She was leaving it up to him to convince her Dad the suit would not be used for wrongdoing.
Sam sensed Scott’s weakening resolve and pressed his advantage. “In fact, Steve is excited to meet someone who ‘stood up for the people’ and ‘went to jail for his beliefs’.”
“Like Peggy will leave the military to join you in Genosha,” Tony tried to say it with a sneer, but he thought it didn’t quite manage to sound anything other than bitterly sad.
The two spoke long enough Scott’s stomach was audibly growling and Clint had dinner to prepare for his own kids.
Tony took it all with considerable patience, especially for someone who hated pity, but Steve saw more than the others. He could see how Tony had changed, and recognized the lingering and complicated grief in his eyes. When Tony returned Steve’s gaze, Steve could also see his gratitude.
“Mission successful?”
It seemed fitting that their farewells would get sidetracked by Luis’s explanations of how he first learned how to use the word “endear” from a friend of a friend’s second cousin.
“I think you can guess I already had a complicated relationship with the government, and I, shockingly, don’t have a strong ally in an administration that continues to want me to make them weapons despite how I refuse to share any of that tech,” Tony replied scathingly. He looked exhausted, and rather than pester him about Stark Industries’ funding like Hope suggested, Scott figured he could just look into the donations to lobbyists and politicians himself when he cracked the server.
Rhodey just laughed before he extended a hand out to Scott. “Can’t say this is my ideal setting for our first meeting, but I mean it when I tell you it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Of course, it is! I mean… I don’t know much-”
All of his accomplishments, all the people who had admired or desired him meant nothing when the only person he had ever wanted back wouldn’t have him. He pulled at his hair and paced, ignoring the way his eyes blurred with tears and desperate to build something to distract him, but unable to handle the idea of leaving his room only to come across someone. He didn’t know how long he spent there, but of course Steve could never let things go.
“Tony, I love you. I love you more than anyone has ever loved anyone. I’m addicted to you. I sometimes just find myself repeating your name in my head, and my sketchbook is filled with pictures of you,” Steve confessed.
When Sam kept giving him the look, Steve threw his hands up. “It’s hard to break the habit of casing a place according to my abilities!”
"Its like you don't like us 'stinking up your precious kitchen,' " Steve said solemnly.
“Because supervillains wish they could be as cruel and malicious as Steve and Natasha are during training,” Sam said sagely.
Steve just chuckled and started to usher his team to the Quinjet. “Why don’t you join us on the plane ride back, Rhodey?”
“Tony said to do whatever it took to get him on the team, and he didn’t say the obligatory ‘within reason’ sane people usually add. Besides, you don’t actually care. “
"I did say that, and I meant that! And you're invited to visit me whenever you want," Scott insisted.
“Rumlow has a biological weapon,” Steve stated sharply.
But it was too late. Tony had already disappeared around the corner. Scott felt like he should be amazed the two hadn’t seen him throughout the exchange, but that same perceptive part of himself that thought it heard bitterness in Steve’s voice seemed to think that tunnel vision wasn’t uncommon when it came to the other with those two, and wondered whether Tony was right to expect a lecture or whether he should have expected an apology. (That voice in his head always sounded vaguely like his ex-wife when she was stressed.
“Don’t even pretend like you don’t have a thousand plans to fix everything,” Scott insisted.
“Leaving me for some other land with inferior tech? See if I don’t take up with all the locals while you’re gone,” Tony threatened unconvincingly.
And well. Neither of them were going to argue with him and they really didn’t want to anyways.
“You have a high tech suit too,” Sam answered unhelpfully over the comms as he and Wanda fought some sort of goon squad.
Also, they were very intimate. All the time. Jarvis banned them from the house after finding them kissing against the dining table, and Bucky would show up and kick them out of his house with Steve, so they spent more time in the workshop or Tony’s room. Tony mapped every line of Steve’s body with fingers and tongue, and Steve got drunk on learning all of Tony’s reactions. Work still had to be done, and the world would try to get in the way, but the two’s motley family was so relieved that they had gotten their heads’ out of their asses that they picked up the slack and let them escape their work early. Steve and Tony were insatiable, years of love and longing boosted with reminders of a coming departure.
“No, this works! What is everyone eating?” Scott looked curiously at all the boxes, noting how there were more boxes than people scattered across the table. Wanda was the one to answer. “I was going to cook you a big home-cooked meal to welcome you your first day here, but we had a mission and I didn’t want to make something early and then ruin it reheating it.” She shuddered at the thought before she continued. “So today I had Friday order our usual dinner order from our favorite Chinese takeout place, and some extra dishes you might enjoy. We all share our orders-“
“I couldn’t possibly impose-”
“Hey, aren't we supposed to be lawbreakers anyways?” Sam said.
“Approximately.”
Scott grew after he took the hit. “Did I get her?!”
“I would argue with you, but I need to check if I’m hallucinating. You feel what?”
The Chinese food restaurant the group almost always orders from has an ad that says they regularly deliver to the Avengers, but no one believes them because at least 5 other restaurants claim the same thing. This restaurant has a specific delivery boy for delivering the orders to the Avengers, and as such, has seen more of the Avengers compound then most people in the government.
single most beautiful person, or even man, in the world. That is not to say that Tony was not firmly in the running for most gorgeous, at least in raw potential. He was around the 20s in the rankings of beautiful people, and while he would not be truly ready till later, he was dazzling, and almost fey in his appearance while still a young adult. With fine features, clever brown eyes, honeyed skin, and dark hair, he caught the eyes of all he passed, and kept their attention when they witnessed his easy genius. But while Tony’s position among the most beautiful men in the world could be debated, few could dispute his claim to being amongst the most brilliant engineers in the world.
There was another one of those weighted pauses. “The bomb is in his suit?” Natasha spoke up, a bit out of breath, probably still running.
The team turned as one to where a clock was blinking 8:30 am, and then back to Steve. He looked grim. “How long does it take the quinjet to reach Lagos?”
“Captain, don’t talk in front of him anymore, I don’t want him to know we know about the bomb.”
“Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?” Sam teased.
“No, kind Jarvis, I would be quite pleased to stay in your lovely fields to await Stark.”
“Hands-on experience, we had a friendly sparring session. Did you happen to see the footage from the Pym incident?” Sam neatly avoided saying how they met, which Steve luckily didn’t pick up on.
“Wait, why not throw a shrinking disk at Rumlow’s Humvee while he drove away?
enough context to handle this mess.
“I see.”
Sam shrugged. “I met the guy when he robbed you.”
Scott would have trained some, especially after being reminded of how taxing these missions would be, but he figured he earned a day off, choosing to instead catch up on the world of computer espionage (just for practice!) in his room.  He had just gleefully planted a virus on Mitch McConnell's work email when he was summoned back to the communal space.
Sam patted Scott commiseratingly on the shoulder before Steve spoke up again.
“It’s incomplete,” Tony jumped in, though he was still glowing from Steve’s praise.
“Don’t worry about Happy, he could use some more humor in his life,” Tony said, gleefully and unrepentantly amused.
Scott fidgeted with his mug, not positive how much he could say was definite. “Hank compensated me well, you know that, and working for the team will hardly decrease what I make. I’ll actually earn more, and have all the same, if not improved, benefits. I will have to go on more missions, which is a given, but I get a place in the Avengers compound to live, and time off when I need it and there isn’t a world-ending emergency. Apparently, those get priority.”
Wanda giggled. “I could whip up something resembling a cultish ritual, I’m sure.”
“False hope for what? Peggy taking him away? Steve isn’t going to leave, that’s a ridiculous suggestion. God, why are you being so stupid, Tony? You’re hurting his feelings because you keep ignoring him!”
Also:
While the pressing stress of their first flight had long gone away with a successful mission, Scott was way too tired to freak out as much as he really should about his being in the Quinjet. As it was, he was curled up on one of the flight benches, stripped down to his clothing underneath his Ant-Man gear and with his head tilted to rest against the cool metal of the plane. He quietly marveled at how quiet and smooth all the machinery was for a plane with such insane flight capabilities, before addressing the rest of his team.
“Will you stop bringing up Margaret? God, you’re so dense!”
“That didn’t COUNT?!”
The years passed peacefully, as Jarvis easily fit into the fabric of the farm as caretaker and manager, Tony worked on a self-driving carriage, the farmhands continued their jobs and studies (with the farm’s heavy labor greatly aided by automations,) Dummy caused chaos, and Tony and Steve continued to dance around their feelings.
“How do you bet with that?”
“Oh, he’s qualified, alright,” Sam’s excitement was infectious and Steve found himself smiling despite himself.
Scott shrugged, before quickly selecting a character with the confidence of a veteran.
Scott sighed. “I really hope it won't always be so personal with these villains.”
“Correct, Sam. Good job today, Scott.”
Steve tried to hunt Tony down to refuse the generous gift, or to at least thank him, but Tony evaded him until Steve caught him at the nearby buffs. There was a cliff overlooking the ocean that Tony liked to visit with Dummy.
“Tony, we all
Scott shrugged. “My chemistry background is pretty solid, Hank Pym made sure of that, and my biology skills are passable? I'm no Bruce Banner, that's for sure.”
“I don't have any excuses, and I don’t need any more lectures, though, wow, Cap, did you suddenly start to care?
Also also, the people who compile wikipedia pages and timelines are heroes.
“Hank? Work with the Avengers?” Scott deflated at Hope’s dry comment. Not much he could say to that.
“If the weapon was even full of active cells.”
Tony’s mouth quirked into a smile, and he simply winked as a response.
Scott swallowed and halted, mildly uncomfortable. “I’m not sure.” When Vision showed no inclination to ask Scott to clarify but obviously expected more, Scott continued haltingly. “There’s... This regulator on the suit? And if you turn it off… You risk shrinking so small that reality as you know it... ceases to exist for you. I turned it off when fighting Darren Cross and… I don’t think I almost died, but at the same time it was like I stopped being aware of my life.”
“Then what could be his play? He hasn’t stolen any weapons, bio-weapon or otherwise… He’s had only minor back-up, mostly mercenaries for hire on his missions…”
Steve met Scott’s baffled gaze sympathetically. “Yeah, he has to travel a lot.”
“Tony’s nicknames tend to stick, don't they?” Natasha drawled, winking at Scott and causing him to wince with embarrassment once more.
The ship escaped with relatively little damage, or little enough damage that they could make it to shore, but the crew had to lock Bucky below deck to keep him from trying to commandeer the ship or a small dinghy. He left the military after telling everyone about Steve’s actions, and no one tried to stop him. (Bucky was the one who insisted on staying enlisted despite losing his arm.)
“Which was good, with the whole… Hydra thing.”
Over the next few years, Maria taught Steve and Bucky to read, write and know their basic history. Tony started “casually” leaving his old arithmetic books for Steve to get, and Maria started teaching Steve the bookkeeping. Howard would teach them some scientific concepts when he remembered and wasn’t drunk upon his return to the farm, but Steve learned much more when bringing Tony food from the house and listening to the boy’s rants.
“Maybe I have a couple ideas,” Hope conceded.
Jarvis took a moment to study himself and send a prayer to Maria to help him handle the mess he could sense was coming.
Steve kept sending letters to Tony, and while they were filled with love, they were also filled with grief and horror. He always apologized for hurting Tony with his actions, and Tony always fought the urge to weep because the stubborn man would do whatever he thought was right, damn the consequences. Tony knew what he did was honorable, but he didn’t want his loved ones to die.
The smell of warm food and the chatter of the team greeted him as he neared, and when he turned the corner to the kitchen, he was greeted by balloons and a telekinetic throw of confetti from a proud Wanda.
Even Natasha laughed out loud.
Wanda snorted amusedly, but with a cold rage in her eyes, seemingly still holding Rumlow firm, and maybe squeezing him
“While I love discussing the inevitable rise of my technology to take over the world and Sam’s pitiful attempts to bond with AI, I do have a lot to do today,” Tony interrupted.
Tony isn’t a person who lets people see him crack. It’s even rare for Tony to show any vulnerabilities around a group he cares about as obviously as he cares about the Avengers. The fact that he’s so good at dissembling and acting, despite the years and even decades of traumas Sam knows he’s faced, bothers him. Sam muses to himself sometimes that it must be like when a mind-reader meets one of the first people his powers don’t work on. It puts you on edge, makes you nervous. Clint? Hard to read but trustworthy enough that it’s not alarming. Bruce? Not hard to read at all. Steve? Not easy to read and generally quieter about his grief, but once you get past his initial defenses, he'll be open with you. Wanda? Easy. She’s still so young it would be weird if she was more deceptive. Vision? He wasn’t trained to deal with whatever entity Vision is. Rhodey? Average difficulty, good soul. Thor? Well, Sam wasn’t sure if he’s met enough Asgardians to be able to say how easy to read the guy was. Natasha? When he first met the warrior, before he got to know Tony, Sam would’ve said she was the hardest to read. But she’s so clearly trying to change and to learn to open up that Sam will let the fact she still keeps some stuff secret go. Everyone needs secrets, and he sees her revealing as much as she does to them as the sign of trust that it is.
“He's not hitting the police.” Steve sounded furious.
Scott mulled this over. “What if we say… I made the suit after the SHIELD files dropped? That I was inspired by the footage. And we could also circulate rumors it's a superpower?”
“Why do you want to be an Avenger?”
“Its fine, Steve. You’ll catch up in no time.”
“I think I’ll object to you using his record as a reason not to let him join,” Steve said bemusedly. “Especially if he’s as impressive an individual as you seem to think he is.”
As he listened to his daughter chatter on the phone while sitting in his room in the Avengers compound, Scott figured that all in all, it was a pretty good day.
