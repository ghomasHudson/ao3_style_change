Then, just as quickly as she’d weighed and judged him with a look, she turned her attention to address the class.
Still, Tony looked forward to every one of them. After all, if he was going to hear the details about how their time on this beautiful, blue planet was limited, there was no better place to hear it than in Steve’s strong arms. Tony had spent the better part of three years held by those arms, protected, safe, and loved. And not that he’d ever admit it to Steve, who genuinely looked forward to their documentary watching nights, but Tony had yet to make it more than twenty minutes through one before getting distracted by his Steve. First Tony would get lost in how his long, graceful fingers held Tony’s hands, or held his glass of wine or even held the remote. Then, little by little, Tony’s gaze would drift up over his hands to his firm forearms that rested so gently around him even though Tony knew they could so easily flex to boast powerful, corded muscles others only dream of. From there it would be so easy to drift and stare at his biceps, the breadth of his shoulders, and even now, in the middle of some truly stunning scenes from Blue Planet II narrated by the inspiring, uplifting voice of Sir David Attenborough, Tony was just staring at Steve’s profile in vibrant blue light streaming off the screen. His proud nose, his soft lips, his heart-stopping, glorious jaw. His long, blond lashes that barely flickered shut as he lost himself to the wonder on the screen.
“...is this,” he whispered, clumsily shuffling through the photos to get to the photograph of how Nick Giordani was found. Why had he written spanking into that scene? Red cuts down the back of Giordani’s legs aggressively mimicked the use of sharpened spurs, but Tony never wrote anything so violent. He wasn’t tame, but he sure as hell didn’t write non-consensual scenes.
Steve growled, and hesitant though he was, he tried squeezing his muscles around Tony’s cock. It worked like a charm; Tony’s hips thrust forward hard enough to rock Steve’s body, and Steve groaned softly in pleasure.
“Take me instead,” Stephanie told the warrior in a defiant and steady voice, as if they were not surrounded and outmatched in every way. “I am Stephanie, the Woman of prophecy. When I am bound to a Chief, my curse will be broken. Leave these men unharmed, and once my curse is lifted, I will give her the daughter she desires.”
Steve looked him up and down, considering Tony dubiously. Then, after some time, he stepped back and left the door open for Tony let himself in. He wandered back to his kitchen and made a show of tossing his coffee out in the sink and going around to turn off his TV, all for Tony’s watchful eyes. Finally, Steve snatched up his leather jacket and came back to join Tony at the front door.
, long story short, all available Air Force cadets are marching on the Gap and Banana Republic to get him a decent outfit for tonight’s date.”
“Thursday night, you and Thor cook dinner. Sam picks the movie. Clint signals our exit; we leave individually in alphabetic order, six minute intervals, Clint’s last, and we each grab a newbie on the way out. James, you’re on standby in the kitchen in case Steve needs an extraction. Got it, Cap?”
For the second time that day, Steve startled out of his tumbling thoughts and blinked around himself to see who had spoken.
“Maybe you should ask her and Shuri to visit Consone? Don't you think it’s possible Shuri craves international cuisines, or the arts?” Steve suggested lightly, hoping not to sound so worried. “They don’t even have ravioli in Wakanda.”
“What if it was a proposal?” Tony guessed, and when Steve nodded jerkily, he mirrored it,  nodding in understanding. “Right... okay, Steve? Listen. I like you—a lot, uh. Actually, more than I, I thought I would like someone after—you know what? It doesn't matter. I just don’t know you that well, Steve,” he said so sincerely that Steve really couldn’t fault him for the rejection. “I don’t know what all you’ve lived through. I don’t even—I mean, if you don’t want to talk about it, you never have to tell me, but, it’s not that I don’t want to know. To know you. Get to know you better. I do. But, if, if this’ll give you peace of mind, it’s… I mean, we can sign a detailed prenup, so nobody has to worry. If this goes south, we separate amicably with what we had before, like any other break-up.”
Marple was on him in an instant, whimpering and yipping in her relief and licking every inch of Tony’s face in overjoyed greeting. His poor girl had never seen him physically incapacitated and Tony tried to grab her, to reassure her that he was okay and to calm her down, but it was all tough to do while trying not to cry out every time the stranger turned or raised his foot.
After another long day of sowing as much doubt in Tony’s painfully insightful connections between Bruce Wayne and a certain local vigilante, Steve was faced with a whole other problem. Wayne’s Charity Ball was a
“Tony?” he called softly before that venomous thought woke his ugly jealousy. “You still with me, partner?”
Tony pursed his lips and thought it over. This was Steve’s first trip out of the country, and while he knew that Steve would only ever be happy for him, the last thing Tony wanted to do was rub his privilege in Steve’s face.
Steve fell asleep soon after the initial pain was gone, but that only made it easier for Tony to identify the sore muscles and knots of tension. He worked Steve’s lower back thoroughly, pausing now and then to indulge in tracing the natural dimples of his lower back. Tony leaned forward to press a soft kiss to Steve’s shoulder once he finished with his lower back, then slid down a little further to knead out the sore, tired muscles of his round ass.
Steve blinked him for a moment in surprise. Slowly, he dared to believe that Tony meant it. He took Tony’s hand gently in his, and with great care he finally slid the gold band onto the finger it had been made for so many years ago.
A train was knocked off course in an explosion near Kensington Palace that left sixteen wounded and two dead. A ferry destined for Tower Bridge safely passed its most likely target and made little noise at the bottom of the Thames after the informed captain evacuated all passengers in a dinghy and sunk the boat.
“The only thing I will need my assistant will be mailing to me by tomorrow night,” Steve replied after a beat. “You—will we ...will it make it?”
Steve popped the M&Ms bag open on the kitchen counter. Bucky’d made decent progress, so he filled the top half of the bag with Ben & Jerry’s Schweddy Balls (vanilla & rum ice cream loaded with fudge covered rum and malt balls) and poured on some of Aunt May’s homemade caramel sauce. He zipped the bag shut, shook it up, then opened it to fill it past capacity with whipped cream straight out of the can.
But Tony wouldn’t be alone. He had Rhodey. Rhodey, who was there from the start when Tony first fled, who helped Tony try to pull himself together to get past Steve. Anyone with access to internet or a TV would know Steve was in town, and even if Tony thought the city was big enough to preserve his anonymity, Rhodey wouldn’t leave it to chance. Rhodey would find a reason to be there at the youth center, just in case, because despite whatever Tony said, he wasn’t over it. He might not admit it, but just knowing that Steve was in town hurt him.
“Swelling’s going down, Doc,” Steve replied dryly, but instead of continuing with sarcasm, he lowered his voice and whispered, “Tony, don’t worry. It’s just an old injury acting up again, okay? If I needed anything, I wouldn’t hide it from you. I promise.”
“I know it’s your first time,” Steve grunted softly on top of him, “but stopping never gets you far.”
“I couldn’t,” Tony struggled to say, and he glanced around them surreptitiously, clearly trying to gauge how many might be eavesdropping on their private conversation. “Steve, I couldn’t see a way out. I was selfish, I wanted every second with you to, to be perfect. Just us. I thought—”
He hadn’t handled it so well. Tony had shot up in bed, he had shouted at Steve - not in anger, but out of fear. Back then, he could never have imagined that his strong, happy, and safe Steve still suffered nightmares from his time in the war. Steve told him later that he’d been back in the trenches with his dad that night. Maybe his feet had been cold in his sleep and it had triggered the memory of his cold, wet feet in worn out combat boots, maybe the wailing winds reminded him of the men too young for war.
“No!” Tony cried, immediately shying back from the rolls and the spatula dripping with freshly made maple frosting. “Damnit, that looks amazing, Steve, but I can’t.”
,” Steve complained, to Tony’s added amusement. “The only sports people talk about here is hockey, and nobody will turn on the NFL at the bar…
“Because you said you wanted to ‘polish my crown,’ Tony - you’re a menace, I’m not rewarding you for that behavior.”
“Swelling’s down, the headache is better. Thank you for the Tylenol,” he added, “there’s coffee, if you’d like some. Just made it. Orange juice is in the fridge, help yourself.”
“They got a warrant, Stark. It was either the computers or giving you and Rogers up to be questioned. And since neither of you are dumb enough to leave any sources or sensitive data on your computers,” he said more slowly, daring Tony to correct him. “I gave them the computers.”
“The second chance you gave me wasn’t genuine, Tony,” Steve reminded him, quietly. “You were going to use that conversation for your article. I shared parts of my life with you that I, that I don’t tell people, Tony. I trusted you.”
Howard shook his head, while Maria and Clint both either grinned or snickered to themselves, but it was enough for them to move on and get back to their tasks. Maria carried a bag full of oranges over to a big fancy-looking juicer in the corner, while Howard wandered out of the kitchen with a stack of letters and bills.
“I did! I was very fortunate—all actors dream of the day acting becomes our only source of income,” he said as diplomatically as he could. “And I’m lucky that they were all projects I’d do again in a heartbeat, but I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t have an agent; I didn’t know you needed breaks! We literally flew out the day MIB wrapped to start on
“A person would go insane,” Tony breathed, too shocked to even speak. “How could this be? Is there no exit survey?”
It took him a minute, but Steve was the first to realize he’d been identified as the sugar baby. There was a certain ironic truth there, and the first chance he had, he asked if Happy had noticed it, too. As close as Happy was to Tony, Steve barely knew him. Before now he’d only spoken to Happy in passing, and besides his loyalty to Tony, Steve knew next to nothing about him outside of his role as chauffeur and bodyguard. This was the first time they’d had a chance to sit and talk, or (as it happened) to share a laugh at the transparent assumptions of their waiter.
Steve stepped out first, grabbing a towel off the rack for Tony, then for himself. But while Steve scrubbed and dried himself off, Tony made a beeline for the ring boxes.
Tony stared at him in silence while he tried to reconcile Bruce’s words with what he knew about his friend. “
“There is one more toy, if we get to it tonight,” Steve told him in an absent whisper. “There’s no rush, sweetheart. I’m in no rush.”
Tony happily stuffed the last big bite of his hot dog into his mouth, so he nodded and hummed in the affirmative.
Steve whistled for the dragon while he was still in Clint’s cell, then snuck out to meet her under cover of darkness. He slept under the protective cover of her wing like he had every night on the road. Anyone who tried to visit the Chief’s betrothed was turned away by the threat of her dragon’s wrath, and it was not until sundown that the dragon lifted her wings again to allow Stephanie to emerge.
“A little?” Maria gawked in clear disbelief. “Honey, I had one of those cinnamon rolls you made. Two of them,” she admitted, probably in case God was listening in. “We’ll teach you how to make a red velvet that’ll put some meat on that boy’s bones.”
Normally, if Steve had the lousy fortune of having all of his midterm exams stacked at the start of the week, he would have taken the rest of the exam week off to be with Tony. That meant he would either convince Tony to take a break from his work (maybe eat a warm meal, maybe disconnect from WiFi for an hour or two), or if Steve felt particularly tired, he’d poke and prod at Tony until he relocated from the lab to his dorm room so Steve could crash on Tony’s bed while Tony worked from his room. Typically, Tony wouldn’t last more than thirty minutes at his desk before he crawled into bed with Steve, but at least it wouldn’t be Steve’s fault.
,” Tony snapped, and again Steve was struck by how terribly transparent his friend could be about hiding his concern behind anger.
“That I did,” Steve replied just as easily. “We were going to lose Delito to Viking, and I wasn’t going to let that happen.”
Steve grinned with genuine amusement, finally slipping out of his jacket to hang it up in the closet along with Tony’s. “Well, you made it sound serious,” he said in his own defense. “Make yourself comfortable, I’ll be right there. Drink?”
Detectives AU, wherein they're detectives in the same precinct, and Steve & Tony are still fairly new as a couple. Tony wants to do right by Steve for his birthday, despite lack of foresight. Inspired by Brooklyn 99.
“I just,” Tony whispered, his voice wavering as he tried to speak. Emotions were bubbling up and threatening to escape him, and Tony pinched his mouth closed and shook his head no until he could calm himself enough to say, “I miss you already.”
Steve blinked at him, suddenly alarmed, as if he’d possibly missed Tony’s last request. “What? What does that mean?”
Tony hadn’t packed much with him, and Steve found his travel size tube of water based lube easily. He tried to wait another two, three minutes, but it may have been closer to forty seconds before he rejoined Tony in the sitting room. The contrast of Tony, kneeling in offering in such an opulent, stately room that came with a price tag rivaling a typical mortgage moved Steve in ways he hadn’t expected. There was no doubt he had severely overestimated himself. In what world had he thought himself strong enough to resist Tony for any period of time?
After a long day of poring over lab results from the crime scenes and tracking down witness for their testimonies, Bucky and Steve had popped in long enough to update the home team before getting on to a meeting at the 62nd. Long enough to thaw the icicles in their clothes into chilling rain before heading into the bitter New York winter again.
“Your sister isn’t!” he cried with sudden excitement, his whole expression lighting up. “I can marry her.”
Bucky squeezed through the crowd to get to him, pushing against the current of students leaving the stage, and like some laughing madman he charged at Steve and hauled him off his feet with a massive bearhug.
Tony grumbled softly to himself. He wanted to say no, that they’d had a catered meeting or that Pepper had forced him to scarf something down—
Sarah laughed at the memory. “He really did, with the pears. But that took time; this always takes time.”
After that first night, Steve and Tony’s conversations grew shorter and increasingly sporadic. Televised interviews and panels discussing the future of accessible sustainable energy occupied every spare minute of Steve’s time outside of their political agenda, so despite his best efforts, he wasn’t able to catch more than a quick phone conversation with Tony until the following night. But instead of his sleepwarm husband, a staff member eventually informed Steve that his husband was unreachable in his workshop.
Tony didn’t stand a chance, not against those inhumanly beautiful blue eyes and Steve’s perfect smile.
, he showed Steve everything. “It’s, uh,” he stammered while his brain reconnected to the server. “That’s, that’s the worst of it, I can, I think I can recreate the rest, maybe. But it—I have to send it to the printer tomorrow by noon, I—”
“You don’t breathe a word of this to anyone,” Tony warned Steve in a clipped tone. Steve hadn’t even opened his mouth before there was a quick rap at the door and someone tried the door handle.
“I’m not running away just cause your parents are ...uh,” Steve floundered for an appropriate word to end on, when Tony suggested, “crazy?”
“He has been helping me adapt to the new world and understand what happened,” Steve was telling Bucky and his ragtag crew. “Their culture is more conservative, so please call him by his last name, Stark.”
“That I am, and I have nothing more pressing to do this night than to reassure myself that my people are well. I am no doctor, but it has been a tragic day and I do not wish for any person to feel alone. Are you from Lumine, Orfeo?”
Tony swallowed back what felt like a dry fistful of nerves. He wasn’t sure what the right thing to say was, but he also wasn’t ready to let Steve do anything he wouldn’t do himself.
“I’ve been working on this for fifteen hours straight, and it’s all my writing. You think I’d expect you to solve it in one night after a day of work?” Tony drawled in reply, though if Steve wasn’t completely seeing all this through a self-insert fanfic lens, he heard a hint of playfulness in Tony’s tone. “I’ll give you my notes, you’ll have everything you need to recreate this …masterpiece shitstorm tomorrow.”
The front door opened and they heard Howard’s voice calling through the house. “Maria!” he shouted, coming through with a basket of eggs. “Remind me to have someone fix the roof on the coop, would ya? Make the eggs, boy,” he paused to tell Tony as he pushed the basket into his hands, then went sat down on the bench by the door to pull his boots off while talking to his wife.
“How dare you speak to me that way?” he glowered, indignant and even louder than before. “Steve! Are you going to let him just get away with talking to me like that?”
It didn’t matter that hundreds of outstanding engineers worked in SI’s research and development alongside Tony every day, or that Tony’s momentary absence would not lead to a deficit. SI was Tony’s commitment to their people; working was his duty. So for him to give in and stay home as easily as he did, Steve could only imagine how awful he felt.
“It ended earlier than I thought,” Tony said after a momentary pause. “It’s a bit of a long story, but I happen to be in Brooklyn, if, um. If you’re free?”
“From what I can hear, he’s the one making this ‘one of those nights,’” Barton said with a knowing smirk. He came around with two shots of whiskey for Tony and a Moscow mule for Natasha. “Your partner is this very complex and deep character but Bruce Wayne is a villain because he has means and opportunity?”
“Then, what?” Steve wondered, elbowing Tony gently in the side. “We didn’t decide: sushi or burgers?”
“I’ve been in this business for thirteen years, Tony,” Steve replied, speaking in a calm tone to avoid sounding patronizing. “There’s a big difference between what either of us should and shouldn’t do.”
“Our fearless leader and his menial drudge. Please, do come in,” Sitwell welcomed them with a false smile, before shamelessly returning to whatever currently entertained him on his desktop.
was Steve’s home? He wanted to live in Tony’s laugh, in Tony’s wild imagination, in Tony’s optimism and dreams for the future to his last breath.
“Focus!” Thor rumbled over them both, gesturing for them to bring it down a level. “Let’s talk about it.”
“I,” Tony stammered, choking on his own words, and if Steve wasn’t worried before, he feared he’d lose his cool any second until Tony coughed up a breathless, disbelieving laugh.
Tony pursed his lips in distaste, giving Thor and Bruce both unimpressed looks. “Seriously. You, too?” he asked, dryly. “You realize this is for a job, right? I’m not trying to get laid; in fact, I’m trying to do the opposite! There was no sex.”
“Also, for the record: this face? It’s all mine,” he said, smirking with a heaping serving of pride. “This isn’t the magnum opus of some plastic surgeon, I really am this devastatingly handsome.”
Tony stiffened as if he’d been struck, and Steve stopped talking immediately. He watched as Tony’s expression changed from a confident smugness to sickening understanding. Pale and increasingly uncomfortable, Tony couldn’t bear to look away from the three pleasant faces Steve had introduced him to earlier. “You mean…”
“I’ll do what I can,” Steve promised, and with his phone in his hand, he excused himself to Tony’s room.
“Tony, don’t be ridiculous, you’re right across the river,” Steve tried to say, but Tony wasn’t having it.
Dr. Odinson stood up in a sudden rush. “Gentlemen!” he roared, looming over them in a way that reminded Steve that he was only a mortal man. “This is getting out of hand. Will you calm yourselves?”
Try not to think about how now more than ever there was a very real possibility that his closest friendship in this crazy new world could be irrevocably damaged if he said (or did) the wrong thing.
From across the bullpen, they heard Natasha chamber her SIG. “Wilson. I believe my partner asked you a question.”
Agneta must have been lost in her own thoughts, because it took her some time to realize someone had spoken to her. It took her longer still to recognize him. She looked old enough to have grown up with Howard as her first king, which meant she would have seen photos of Tony since he was born. She rallied to attention, sitting up straight while trying to bow her head out of respect.
Steve gave him a strangled look. Sometimes he wished there was a third person around just so he could have someone to validate him. “Tony, even Donald Trump’s done it.”
“Then let’s see if we can’t even the score,” Carl said with a smile. “For point two… the initials are, AO.”
There was a momentary pause at the other end of the line—blink and you’ll miss it. “Slow,” Steve eventually said, clearly choosing not to comment on Tony’s unexpected term of endearment. “How would you feel about seeing a movie with me tonight, Tony?”
“I’d rather stay out of your precious New Yorselyvania, Stark. You can handle Rumlow yourselves, can’t you?”
His answer seemed to satisfy Hawley, who grinned and nodded in tune to the murmured agreements voiced by the rest of the class.
“They were the best two months of my life,” he confessed with a watery hiccup. Tony squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself not to outright laugh or begrudge his friend his feelings, and instead reached over to tug Thor closer by the shoulders until his friend caved and fell into the hug Tony was offering.
Regardless of where in old Terrini one was, every summer solstice began with games for the children, perhaps a strategic choice by their ancestors who recognized the relative peace families would enjoy into the afternoon with tired, well-fed children. Children competed in obstacle courses and in animal husbandry to win raffles to various afternoon entertainment, such as canoeing or pony rides. Not to be outdone, the adults spent much of their days in similar attempts to one-up each other for bragging rights. Everything from caber tossing to three-legged races to eating competitions were widely popular, and it seemed no-one was immune to the lure of victory.
Rather than buzz Thor’s apartment directly, he swept both hands over the buttons all at once, and like magic he was buzzed up by some irritated soul who had no patience for pranks. Taking the steps two at a time, he made it to Thor’s fourth floor apartment in record time, panting, sweating, and regretting at least two of his donuts from earlier.
Bucky’s parents hadn’t been able to take off from work to see him at his graduation, but his baby sister was there, and together with Steve and Sarah, they celebrated the occasion at one of Steve and Bucky’s favorite restaurants in Boston. It was pricier than their usual fare, but if graduation wasn’t special enough, what was?
by me. You are a monster—just because you have no semblance of a life outside of this office, you, you get your thrills, your power-hungry need to control everything, by pushing us around. You think you can treat all of us like your own personal slaves! And you know what?” he added, “I feel sorry for you, because you know what you’re going to have on your deathbed? Nothing, and no-one.”
, he gags; and this muscle in his jaw? It jumps when he’s real frustrated, it’s a compass for how to best annoy him. Every ‘literally,’ ‘like,’ ‘insane’—it’s like takin’ candy from a baby.”
“Don’t give me those Bambi eyes, I’m a married man,” Sam smirked wryly, then with a final pat on the shoulder, he said, “her Beretta and her lip gloss are on the block. If she brings the bike back, she gets the Aston Martin with the seat warmers; if she doesn’t, she gets the Jag with the automatic transmission.”
“Hey, Tony,” Rhodey said gently, because of course he knew what Tony’s hangdog expression meant. “Listen, we’ll figure something else out. It’s okay.”
Bucky let himself be manhandled as Steve scrambled to hide behind him. “But didn’t you say he’d be in Harlem today?” he asked quietly, watching Tony turn a corner in their very own Brooklyn.
Tony shuddered at the thought, and didn’t dare to ask how they had learned that whatever those poor species were could survive acid baths. Instead, he asked, “Why are there no… humans?”
“Tony!” Steve laughed though he genuinely tried not to; Tony was stressing out in a way he hadn’t witnessed before and Steve didn’t want to appear patronizing. But also, where had this Tony had been during the worst of award season?
Rumlow provided him with a technical guide for the different uses of black market products. Natasha told him about a club that curated a very exclusive clientele every night when two of their four moons aligned.
“Tony, we’re not supposed to—ah, fuck it,” Steve muttered and gave up pretending to care. They both knew by now how resistant Steve really was to breaking the rules, and Tony laughed into his mouth, grabbing Steve by his ears to reel him in for a kiss so eager and passionate that Steve’s smirk faded and only his want for Tony remained.
“That’s perfect, thank you, Lila,” Steve said with a smile and helped her get the next plate of struffoli into the oil. “Anyway, I thought the macadamia nuts were tasty,” he continued in his earlier train of thought. “Ma always liked the hazelnuts best. I thought we could make a little of all three.”
The fabric fell to the floor to reveal the divine adonis beneath. As the mortal expression of the patron goddess, the chief priest’s body effortlessly exuded strength and beauty. Ancient symbols depicting Marham’s prayer for family and health were drawn across the firm muscles of his chest, closest to his heart. The Mayor could only stare as Ean knelt before him and welcomed him to the rite of Imbolg in the ancient words of their people.
“Love you so much,” Tony rasped breathlessly into Steve’s panting mouth, pressing their lips together in another kiss, desperate to kiss him again and again and again even as they both struggled to catch their breaths. Try as he might, Tony couldn’t stop kissing Steve, or touching his hair, his ears, his face as he spouted praise and love and affection for the man who kept his heart in such euphoric relief.  “Love you, my tech hero, my, my—I fucking love you, Steve, I’d be lost without you.”
“What the hell...” he started to ask, and Steve followed his line of sight to a massive pet walking beside its equally massive owner, covered in curved, jagged spikes, not unlike prehistoric shark teeth.
“No—yes, no,” Tony hurried to say. “I’m fine, but one of my friends just got dumped and we’re out here and I thought I, I,” he trailed off into a miserable sound. “Ah, fuck, I didn’t think. I shouldn’t have asked, I—”
“Breakfast’s at 6, like always; no special city folk hours, understand?” Maria told him, then stretched to kiss his cheek one more time. “It’s good of you to come home, baby. Mama missed you.”
“Babe, there are these giant bottles of chocolate body paint left on the shelves. The sales are going to be insane, we have got to capitalize first thing tomorrow morning,” Tony was saying as he wandered into the living room. “Nothing against your charcoal and pencil work, but—”
He distracted himself the best he could. He looked around Steve’s place again, this time with the hazy light of dusk throwing the open floor plan of the apartment into a dream-like relief. Steve’s living room was bigger than Tony’s apartment: the couch could have comfortably seated eight adults with room to spare, and even so, there were two additional armchairs for more guests. There was no TV in the living room, and where one might have expected a TV, there was a grand piano instead, beautiful and well-kept like the day it was made.
The fog lifted and he sprinted after Steve, his parents shouting after them in his wake. Tony got out on the porch just in time to see Steve pulling away in their rental truck, pulling out and speeding away into the approaching night.
One night, he had taken the chance of slipping one canister over Tony’s hard cock, pumping it over his erection until Tony was fit to burst before introducing the second canister in his ass. Between the tight, velvety core of the canister massaging around his cock, and the thick, knobbed girth working his ass open, Tony’s body had handled like a dream, thriving on the pain of both canisters simultaneously locking in, and unbothered by exhaustion.
Steve strangled the wheel until his knuckles started to turn white, but despite his evident temper, he somehow resisted shouting. Instead, he calmly bit out, “Why not?”
A morality box attached to the CompuKiosk buzzed overhead and printed a thin sheaf of paper for Rumlow’s reference. “Mister Brock Rumlow, you are fined five credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
From across the room, he saw as the redheaded woman’s lips twitched up in a sly smirk. Not so far from her, Hawley began smiling at him as well.
“Are you at a good stopping point?” Steve asked, and even though Tony’s shoulder twitched at the question, he nodded in the affirmative. “If it’s not, you can finish.”
“He is my friend! I’d do the same for you,” Steve snarled. “You’re either with me or against me, what’s it going to be?”
“I can’t get enough of you, baby,” Steve groaned breathlessly, and slowly, reluctantly, released Tony’s balls. Predictably, Tony whined his discontent, spreading his thighs further apart and arching his back to needfully press back, chasing Steve’s touch.
“Okay, that, so fucking—no,” Tony suddenly changed his mind, and grabbed one of Steve’s hands and pressed it against his half-hard cock. “0 to 80 in four seconds,” he growled playfully, then laughed at the color rising in Steve’s face. But in difference to Tony, who still enjoyed at minimum two layers of clothing from the neck down, Steve was stark naked. Tony didn’t need to be a psychic to know Steve was at least as excited as he was embarrassed.
“We asked you to answer thirty question about yourself,” Karl said in clarification as he and Georgie straightened their respective note cards. “We’ve chosen some questions at random to ask you about each other, and for each correct answer, you win a point.”
For reasons Steve couldn’t begin to guess at, Tony’s face had grown pale, and he fidgeted in his discomfort. He nodded in the affirmative.
He’d expected Tony to be asleep when he got back, but instead found him lounging in the tub. He stood there in the doorway without saying a word, watching Tony in this brief moment of peace. It didn't take long to realize that by the way Tony’s head was rested comfortably over a rolled-up towel, and the unusual stillness of his fingers draped over the side, Steve’s first assumption hadn’t been so far off.
How could one feel weightless and still not move? Tony’s heart pounded in his chest and his eyes burned with the tears lodged in his throat. He struggled to form words, to get the air past his leaden tongue, until finally he gave up on words and hauled Steve to his feet so he could fall into him, to hold on and breathe him in and find his balance again in this crazy world that was spinning faster than ever before.
But Steve wasn’t done with him yet; a young gem like this was good for more than one orgasm. If Steve had his way, Tony would be good for another two, minimum.
apartment, and shuffled in to the smell of dinner wafting through from the kitchen and Steve’s absent humming from the living room.
“What’s family for?” he replied with a big smirk, then with a more genuine smile, he came forward to shake Steve’s hand. “Good to meet you, Steve. No hard feelings?”
Steve opened and closed his mouth, but no sound came out. He cleared his throat, but there was still a little tremor in his voice that told Tony he was on to something. “You can’t consent if you’re asleep,” Steve said, but somehow his statement of fact sounded an awful lot like a question.
Steve laughed - genuinely laughed. It wasn’t even about the information she had shared, or feeling in on some campus secret, like he was suddenly one of the cool kids.
“I can’t believe it’s over,” Tony said first as they made their way out of the Burbank recording studio. They had just finished the last of the voice recordings, lines of dialogue that had been changed in the editing room or needed to be cleared up.
Tony was still giggling to himself when he took Mr. Perfect’s offered hand and slowly, careful not to put any weight on his right foot, pushed himself up. Or, more accurately, assisted Mr. Perfect in lifting him back to his feet.
All at once, Tony was all around and within him, and Steve could feel the warmth of his skin even if he couldn’t feel as much of him yet as he wanted. The memory of Tony’s lithe, powerful body riding the mechanical bull was still too fresh in his mind, and it was scary how quickly his heart was racing at Tony’s insistence that tonight was only about him. It was exciting, but scary in its passivity; with every touch of Tony’s fingers, every eager love bite, Steve could feel his restraint fading. The urge to take control was nearly overwhelming. His hands ached to bodily turn Tony onto his belly and open him up on his fingers, to fuck him until he sobbed.
While their mom stared down their dad across the table, Clint glanced Tony’s way and they both rolled their eyes. “You still up for fixing the fence out by the east lake?” Clint asked then, determined to move on. “We could do it together on Thursday, if it’s too much.”
(It wasn’t until later that night that two of the men he’d gotten close to on the week-long shoot invited him over to their place and showed him exactly how bold, hand-crafted leather armor could be enjoyed.)
“This is Star-Lord, the eleven week old Boxer mix. He’s a really sweet little guy looking for a family to love.”
“We could go to Tribeca, they’ve got great places there, with really hot people—and rich, too,” Bruce started eagerly telling them as Tony led him out through the crowd.
The resulting compromise was simple: Tony agreed to let Bucky and Steve figure out how to share Steve’s floor, and the team supported the addition of two new apartments - one for the twins, and one for regular visitors (like Sam and Scott and Hope and even Loki, of all people).
“As it turns out, the American government doesn’t care who publishes on Delito,” Hill told him impatiently. “Your visa application has been denied, and you are being deported.”
In the seconds it had taken Steve to reach the bathroom, Clark had thrown his suit in the laundry, taken a shower, and Steve could hear him in his bedroom looking for something to wear. The plastic CVS bag sat on the bathroom counter, and his dad had opened the new tube of Neosporin for him and left a big band-aid next to it.
Again, he shifted down. There was less friction against his cock now that he sat fully on Tony’s thighs, but with his hands cupping Tony’s mid-back, Steve closed his eyes and forcibly tried to ignore the thoughts of soon getting his hands on Tony’s lower back, and soon after that, he’d be digging his palms into the firm curve of Tony’s ass.
“I will hurt you,” Bruce warned him and finally dumped the bran muffin he’d been torturing himself with, then sat back with a happy cup of tea.
“Dum-E can make smoothies, too,” Tony said even though Steve already knew everything about Dum-E. He could be cool and nonchalant about most things, but he not when people praised his little learner-bot.
Tony closed his eyes and bit his lip to keep from laughing in Steve’s face. But clearly, Steve could still feel and hear his amusement; he leaned in with a big grin to kiss Tony’s smiling lips. A moment later, Steve shuffled up in bed until he was partially sitting up, and he pulled Tony in closer again to hold Tony in his arms.
The little device replied to the cop’s request with the detached confidence of a machine. “With a firm tone of voice, demand maniac lie down with hands behind back.”
Steve woke up more than ten hours later. There was no alarm ringing, no staff member in sight. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, he was well rested and alone.
His reaction was visible and immediate. A warm glow spread over his skin, first warming his cheeks and the back of his neck, then sweeping across his chest and abdomen. His tense posture under the blankets was forgotten, and his whole body relaxed in a short series of quiet, delighted laughter. He sunk down into the cushions then, pleasantly drowsy from the heady, relaxing effects of Steve’s come.
“Mein Schafes, Coulson is already estimating that it will take longer than expected. We has scheduled two meetings at the capitol, and on our return to Consone, we will stop in Brussels,” he explained to his reluctant husband, “perhaps in Paris as well.”
“Your best suit is your birthday suit. And incidentally,” Steve whispered against his jaw, a rumbling sound deep in his chest. “Your birthday suit is my only birthday wish.”
“He’s not cheating! I know where he fucking is!” Steve snapped. Sam and Bucky stared back at him, and it took a second too long to realize he’d shouted at his friends. He didn’t raise his voice, not with friends.
“They’re double-oh’s,” Sharon explained with a roll of her eyes. “All they know is flirting, fucking, and murder. Flirting is the cleanest option.”
“Requisition? Look,” Tony said with the confidence of a man who was definitely guessing but unbothered by it. “If we waited for you to requisition everything the operatives need, we’d be nowhere fast. Most of what they use was created because we’re all still children trying to shock the pants off each other.”
Tony blinked wildly in his sudden embarrassment. “I, uh. Presumably, yes, Steve Rogers. But I assure you, Jason Statham’s outward appearance does not do you justice. Neither does his voice. However, his fighting skills are exceptional, and, I suspect, why he was selected to portray you.”
“Next Tuesday!” a little girl shouted, her excitement so infectious Tony started laughing again. “We’re going to the Bronx Zoo next Tuesday.”
“Tony, this is Steve’s turn to share,” Dr. Odinson said in a stern tone of voice. “Please, show him the same courtesy he showed you. Steve, what were successful methods of communicating what you needed when you were growing up?”
It was only then that Steve realized Tony’s townhouse was unusually silent. He’d assumed Tony was in the bathroom, or downstairs in the kitchen, but there was no sound coming from anywhere in the brownstone. He hadn’t even noticed Tony get out of bed.
Between one roll of Tony’s hips and the next, Steve slid a slippery wet cock sleeve over the length of Tony’s cock. That pulsing, wet suction on his cock was the final straw. From his neck to his toes he could feel his muscles seizing, his ass squeezing down on the canister and thrusting wildly into the heavenly suction of the cock sleeve. Long seconds passed before the student dislodged the canister in Tony’s ass and pulled it free from Tony’s limp, worn-out body.
Tony considered telling him. Recounting his earlier conversation with Bruce, which would inevitably be a compliment to his stamina and strength, then subsequently explain how his sexual prowess was more reminiscent of ancient Greek monsters than any mortal sex Tony had ever had.
“Sounds great, Steve. I can’t wait, I’ll see you then,” Tony smiled warmly into the phone before hanging up.
After two days of wearing either the sweats he wore on the plane, or jeans that sagged around his body and reminded him of all that had been and never could be, wearing snug, well-structured jeans made him feel like a whole person again.
Steve took a deep, calming breath. “My name is Steve,” he said. “Tony’s worked all day. I can help.”
“We will be meeting Mrs. Hansen in thirty minutes,” she told them as they took a seat around the oblong conference table. “What questions have you thought to raise?”
“Kiss,” Steve groaned against Tony’s collarbone, and when he put Tony on his back, Tony’s legs instinctively fell open to cradle Steve’s body, making the perfect intimate space for him to slide in between his thighs. Steve got his big hand around both their cocks, holding them firmly together as he thrust greedily, moving in a slow, dry slide to take the worst of the edge off.
Seamus made a particularly loud, pig-like snore, and kept sleeping without a care in the world. Tony watched the little dog with a big smile, then looked up to find Steve pretending not to watch them both.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Mr. Stark?” Steve asked, alert but audibly confused.
“Sure, Tony’s great. He picks up the tab,” Bucky promised half-heartedly. Without thinking, Steve glared at his friend for even suggesting that was all Tony was good for. Bucky rolled his eyes, but he conceded his mistake. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
Except Carol held on to his hand and made sure he met her eye as she quietly said, “No sneaking off in the bathroom, broom closet, elevator, coat room - anything. I’m counting on that Stark charm today, Tony, please don’t be late to your own speech.”
Jane was the first of the other officers to speak up, albeit very quietly. “Lieutenant Tony Stark,” she said, struggling to control the tremble in her voice. “Are you saying that ...he’s been thawed? Crossbones is free?”
“Babe, you know that’s not personal. I spend all my time with case studies and hypos, there’s no time for fun.”
Steve rolled onto his back as Tony shuffled in closer, pulling Tony to his side. Tony nuzzled in closer, pillowing his head on Steve’s chest.
“Approaching critical overthinking tipping-point,” Tony whispered in his mock-narrative of Steve’s play-by-play.
Tony was too good for him, and he knew it. If he stayed, Tony would be stuck with him, a man who had lied to him for so long. A man who was too scared, too insecure to ever be entirely honest.
Rationally, Steve knew Tony had worked hard through the night to create a highly customized tool that compressed days worth of police work into seconds of computer processing. He knew Tony’d most likely made several alternative versions of the same program to accommodate different forms of data, since he hadn’t known what they’d exactly receive. His creation was, for all intents and purposes, an educated guess.
“How was the sex?” Bruce prompted then, and he gave Tony a sympathetic look. “Is that what was wrong?”
“We can stay here,” Tony whispered in a voice that sounded unnatural and very, very far away. “We’re safe here, we never have to go back.”
Simple problems and sources of irritations build to petty fights, and it takes a lot of arguing and banishing each other (or themselves) to the guest room to finally have an open conversation about how upset they are that work will separate them in a few months time. They decide that if they want a relationship, neither of them wants to do it long-distance, so from the fighting they decide that (1) they'll choose projects together and (2) they never accept work at the same time, unless by some miracle both projects are set out of the same city.
“That’s above my paygrade, Mr. Rogers,” Happy replied with a shrug. “Oh, and the Boss asked me to take the flowers back to your place.”
Tony’s lips curled in a wry smile and he opened his mouth to say something, but Steve got a hand up to gently keep his lips closed to quiet whatever self-deprecating or sarcastic comment he wanted to make. “Yes, you, Tony. Your brilliance, your kind heart. So, if you’re interested and free sometime, I would really like to take you on a date and get to know you better—a real date, without the team,” Steve amended before Tony inevitably teased him, then took the risk of removing his hand. “Just you and me.”
The question stumped Steve at first. “Because of the hydrangeas?” Tony hummed in the affirmative. “It’s a long story, but no, not a funeral. I wanted to plant them. With you.”
“Your face was objectively pleasing before, Captain,” Jane told him with a mischievous little smirk. “Astonishingly, this is an improvement.”
A bottle of water and some Tylenol in a shot glass were waiting for him on his nightstand. He touched his face cautiously and found the soreness tripled with the faintest touch. So, it hadn’t been a nightmare after all. He helped himself to two pills as soon as he could wrench the water bottle open, and he finished half the bottle before turning to see if Tony was awake.
He hadn’t finished his question before the whole class roared with shrill excitement, demanding and begging in turn that he join them at the zoo the following week.
Worse than that, Superman wasn’t available anymore. The pictures and fandom were all Tony had left, because nobody had seen Superman in fifteen years. Not officially, anyway. Witnesses at various natural disasters sometimes claimed to have seen the blue tights and the red cape seconds before the worst of the storm was diverted, or that time a bridge near Vancouver had crumbled and more than forty cars should have crashed into the ravine below. But chunks of the bridge magically remained airborn long enough for the cars to skid back to solid ground, and some people claimed to have glimpsed the red cape take off.
There was a momentary interruption to the otherwise smooth operation, and without anything in front of him to sign, Tony Stark looked up. Steve tried to keep a cool head about him, but he couldn’t quite get the words out.
“Rumlow ain’t home, he’s got a big fish to fry,” some other voice giggled in the dark. “But guess that tells us on what side of the line y’all stand...”
“Nowadays, a lot of that happens through social media,” Tony said, sitting up and leaning forward as his hand gestures increasingly became part of the conversation. “What headline gets retweeted and shared on Facebook, what do our readers choose to respond to and comment on. Many people still write emails to the editors, either to compliment someone’s work or tell them to fuck off.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve replied, but Tony struggled to understand his response. The way Steve’s shoulders slumped inward was telling of his nerves and anxiety, but Steve was still leaning into Tony’s embrace, still trying to smile back at him even when it couldn’t reach his eyes. Something had Steve on edge, but for the life of him, Tony couldn’t put his finger on it. His mother was more talk than bite, and his dad had kept his word about keeping his distance. All he could do was hold Steve closer and do his best to communicate to Steve that he was safe.
Tony went on to explain how to find the right pages, but Steve tuned most of it out in his dumbfounded shock.
It wasn’t long before the door swung open and Tony stared back at him in surprise. He was dressed as casually as before, barefoot and comfortable, and armed with a gleaming kitchen knife. “Steve? What’s - are you alright? Is this about Kline?”
“Twelve years sober, I thought we were fine. But I found them in his office, in his car. In his closet. Everywhere he could he hid these small bottles of hard liquor. And then the spontaneous work trips started two months ago, late August. Our children don’t know when they’ll see their dad, and how he’ll react to them when he does come home. Every night he doesn’t come home, the look on their faces… they break my heart. But that’s not as bad as the nights he comes home drunk… No child should fear their own parent. I can’t let him keep doing this to them; they deserve a good father.”
“Beautiful,” Steve murmured, and with a flick of his thumb, he turned on the vibrations and the knobs and ridges. He fucked the canister into Tony with slow, full-length strokes, twisting it on every thrust until the muscles of Tony’s thighs trembled with Steve’s touch.
Natasha waited on the other side of the door. She held up a case of his favorite beer, signaling a semi-casual visit. “Got some time for an old friend?”
“I want it,” he mumbled, slurring most of the words into his pillow, but he really couldn’t find the energy to make his tongue move yet. “Tony, please,” he whined, clumsily pressing back with his hips to better articulate what he needed. “Fuck me, Tony. Sweetheart, please.”
“What the hell,” Bucky muttered, looking from the phone to Steve then back again. “What the—you—what the
“These past six weeks that I’ve been spending time with Benedita on my days off,” he continued quietly, “you have every right to be angry, Tony. I was lying to you; I wasn’t helping her promote a community center.”
Orfeo pressed his lips together and was quiet for some time. “What if I am wrong?” he asked after a long silence. “What if we are wrong for each other?”
“This is good,” Steve simply said, rubbing slow, gentle circles over Tony’s back as he held him close and pressed a kiss into his hair. Besides their nudity, they hadn’t started anything approaching sex yet, but somehow Tony needed and greedily indulged in Steve’s comfort.
Steve moved his belongings into his one-bedroom suite on the fifth floor and dashed out to join everyone else at orientation. A big banner hung in the law school quad to direct them to the orientation tables where tired second-year students in red shirts manned the posts. He walked up to the main table, separate from the tables where clubs like the Harvard Law Journal and Environmental Law Association tried to enlist fresh cases to their cause.
Steve hadn’t meant to react the way he did, but he knew who Dummy was. The thought that he wasn’t safe from that giant animal inside of a house had him sitting ramrod straight in his chair and staring at Tony with startled, wide-eyed fear.
“Easy, Tony. Pace yourself,” Steve soothed and helped Tony find a more restful position on his belly. Tony grit his teeth and did as he was told. The next words out of Steve’s mouth were unintelligible to him, but they weren’t for him: Steve was giving the other masters a piece of his mind, and to Tony’s relief, the others stepped away from his body at once.
“I appreciate it, Sharon,” he said as he slowly sorted through his jumbled thoughts. “I’ll let you know either way, but I really appreciate it.”
Tony struggled with how to explain his jumble of insecurities. “I wear your dog tags,” he eventually managed. “They mean the world to me, because they’re yours and they remind me of what we have. You don’t do that with anything I’ve given you, and I thought it was because you had that with someone else,” he finished lamely. “Someone so special you wouldn’t tell me about them.”
Steve gave chase, and Rumlow had expected it. His feet had only reached the ground when Rumlow pitched the cannonball into Steve’s gut at an inhuman speed. Steve collapsed where he stood, choking on blood and air while Rumlow sprinted away.
All around him young men were butchered as they wept and screamed and ran for cover. All of them dead, except for him. He stood there, among them but apart from them, frozen in time and space where he could do nothing but watch as other men sacrificed and gave their lives for freedom, as other men returned to help rebuild the nation. He heard them call his name, but what could he do? Steve was stronger, bigger, and healthier, and still he was that sickly little kid from the 30’s who was destined to linger in the sidelines when it mattered most.
“I’m not,” he replied, “but if I leave, Fury will make Sitwell the new Editor in Chief. You think you’ll ever achieve your dreams of touching millions of people with the written word then? He will fire you the second I’m gone, which means the three years you’ve worked for me will have been for nothing. Do you understand?”
Tony chuckled quietly with a shake of his head. They had three plates between them, a little bit of everything and heavy on the fried eggplant and falafel for Tony. They enjoyed the anonymity of people-watching on the beach, and shared their meal with happy (if comfortably scattered and unhurried) conversation.
The first one was a screenshot of a return bus ticket from the BU campus bus station to the one nearest Tony’s dorm in Cambridge. Steve would arrive at 7:30am and be there well into the night with a return trip scheduled at 5am the next morning.
What was meant to be a quick teasing video nearly brought Tony to tears. At first the plan was about giving Steve a good show and nothing else. Tony tried to keep his head clear by taking intermittent breaks from that aggressively well designed toy. He’d pull all the way off the shaft, reaching back to bare his well fucked hole for Steve through the mirror, but soon those brief respites were not enough. He alternated between jerking off with a surging need or grinding his palm against his cock to stave off the inevitable.
“Steve?” he finally heard Tony call his name, and it sounded like it wasn’t the first time he’d tried it. “You there?”
“Yeah, sure. Thanks,” Tony said with a little sniff, but he still gave Steve a friendly smile. “Hey, sleep well, Steve. I’ll see you for breakfast.”
“It’s, it’s our,” Tony tried again, wheezing through the laughter and the hapless tears. Steve’s eyes went immediately for the sheet of paper Tony had pulled out of the FedEx envelope, and without a second thought took it from Tony’s hands.
“Even if I did, Wayne is the likeliest suspect,” Tony muttered between bites. “Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Can you think of a narcissist in Gotham with better connections?”
Tony visibly deflated, but he contained whatever groan of disappointment before Steve could hear it. “If Coulson feels it is necessary, it must be so. But I will speak to Pepper about amendments to your schedule on your first official engagement.”
Only a year ago, Steve would’ve coaxed and teased Tony to let go, to come home and fall into bed with him. A year ago, nobody would have worried more about Tony’s sleep and mental health than Steve, just like there was nothing Tony wouldn’t do to protect Steve and his happiness.
“It’s—I know how it sounds, I know,” Steve promised, casting around for ways to explain away the blunder. “I am so sorry, I’ll have her fired if that’s what yo—“
He punched in Steve’s number. His thumb hovered over the taunting green circle. It would be so easy.
“Steve Rogers,” he said in a surprisingly steady voice, and with a smile that never failed to impress. “It is a pleasure to meet you all.”
“First of all, your knees are too swollen for anyone else to fit in your dumb pants,” Tony replied, raising his fingers as he counted out his arguments. “Second, who would that be, anyway? Sharon? She deserves better than a booty call, and how would she help your top heavy ass up the stairs? Third,
He was so far gone that he barely noticed when Steve's massaging fingers pressed into his ass, finger fucking him full of slick lubricant. First one thick finger, then two, until Steve could scissor his fingers and stretch Tony's tight hole to its new limit. Immediately and instinctively he tried to jerk free, but Steve held him there despite his soft cries of discomfort. Tony's hard, twitching cock flagged, and his casually spread thighs clamped together in an instinctive effort to push Steve's hand away, but still Steve didn’t release him.
Mischief was bright in Steve’s eyes as he hugged Violet closer like a shield between them and hid his face against her side as he laughed, and laughed, and laughed.
“They really need to stop calling it that,” Steve muttered under his breath, and Sharon smirked in agreement.
“Really?” Jimmy laughed in genuine surprise, and Steve turned his attention back to him. “Do you—do you ever, like, talk to them?”
“It’s eight o’clock at night, you look like an idiot with that on,” he observed, tapping the brim of Steve’s hat lightly with his menu. Steve snickered quietly and half-heartedly batted the menu out of his face, but otherwise said nothing. “Dressed like a dumb frat boy and you’re still hotter than sin. It’s just not fair.”
Steve had already been waiting for twenty minutes at the corner of 34th and 7th when he saw Tony finally step out of a cab. He found Steve in the crowd at once, and hurried over.
Tony’s frown of concern started to look more like confusion, and Steve allowed himself a quiet breath of relief. He could work with confusion.
“She pointed out how not all women have dutiful husbands supporting them, and how women were the only people punished for the consequences of sex. And then, here: General Electric, a company that had once made all women quit upon marrying, for excluding pregnancy coverage on its employee plan. GE’s lawyer told the Supreme Court with a straight face that, after all, women didn’t have to be pregnant. If they wanted to work, GE’s attorney suggested, women now had legal access to what he called ‘an in-and-out noon-hour treatment.’ He meant abortion. Astonishingly, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed. Rehnquist wrote for the majority that pregnancy was special, because unlike race or gender itself, it was often ‘voluntarily undertaken and desired.’”
“What is Captain Steve Rogers doing?“ Bruce asked, and Tony could only blink back at him. For any prisoner to exit a law enforcement conveyance was highly improper, and to make matters worse, Steve walked on the green, unpaved landscaping.
Since their costumes were created with each model’s dimension in mind, the costume department had let them keep their armor and clothing. At the time, Steve easily understood why the women were happy - their togas were beautiful and made with modern fashion in mind; they’d be able to use those unique, handmade dresses as often as they pleased. He hadn’t understood why the men had grinned and clapped themselves on the back, though. Their costumes would look insane in the regular public, and Steve hadn’t understood why they were happy about something clunky and impractical that only served to collect dust between Halloween parties.
Steve wasn’t sure he heard right. He frowned to himself and found himself asking, “What do you mean?”
The tension started to ease away, and the pressure deep inside him started to build into a consuming pleasure. Tony’s quiet, occasional whimpers of discomfort grew into soft, insistent moans, and as they grew more eager and needful, Steve pulled away from Tony’s lips and straightened. Without the constraint on his position, Steve took Tony’s other leg by the ankle, and bore down on Tony with newfound intent.
He paused long enough to greet the big wigs at the door in passing, but then he cut a direct path to their designated tables. Steve had said he’d wait for Tony there, and with any luck, Tony might convince his man to join him on the candle-lit mezzanine for an intimate intermission and some cock...tails.
As soon as she could, Stephanie rushed to the small, stone building where Tony and Clint were held in separate cells. It was still dark outside, but dawn was approaching. She did not have much time.
“Econ for Tuesday, art assignment due Monday, that’s almost done. Comm isn’t due until Wednesday, that one’s pretty straight-forward, but I have a test in French on Friday.”
After all, they weren’t the only ones with their biases. New York had felt just as much like home when he was a poor rugrat raised by a single mom in the projects as when he was a highly-sought, highly-paid model. By contrast, the narrow streets and colonial red-brick houses coded Cambridge as a conservative, preppy, and exclusive space made Steve feel like an outsider. But like his mom had always showed him, he made an effort to see the intimidating crowd for the individuals and people they were. As he strolled through campus on his way to his new home in Hastings Hall, he noticed them - the group of three students huddled together around a bench table in animated conversation; the co-eds playing frisbee tag on the green; the young woman pulling a roller case behind her while mouthing along to some fierce music in her headphones.
“More than Helen Mirren?” Tony gasped in feigned shock, but he grinned back almost immediately, reaching for Steve’s hands and hauling himself up against the counterbalance of Steve’s weight.
“Zipped pockets,” Tony said quickly, digging his keys out to comfort his rescuer. The strong, firm body against him relaxed immediately.
Ean was laid out over the altar on his back, assisted by his attendants who guided him into ritual position between countless wax candles. His arms were stretched over his head and tied down to the altar with ceremonial hemp rope dyed with the same vibrant red only worn by Brigid’s chosen thirteen. But when one such priestess proceeded to raise and spread Ean’s legs, Torin stayed her hand from tying him down.
“I swear to do so as soon as it is within my power to do so,” Stephanie promised. “But until then, it is not safe. We travel only by night.”
In the silence that Steve allowed between them, Tony stopped what he was doing and looked up. He looked anything but surprised or betrayed. He looked like he had been expecting this visit for some time.
Paulette scoffed again, this time in agreement of Erin’s assumption. “Either way,” she said, “he’s just like any other man following his prick to greener pastures.”
“Enough!” Carter snapped, shutting Steve up at once. “It has been a week and we’ve made no goddamn progress, Rogers. The Commissioner does not feel one author’s circumstances outweigh the threat to the city at large, and I for one don’t disagree with him. Take your meeting at the 62nd tonight, then go home. Tomorrow you hand over the task force operations to the FBI. I’ll give you two more days with the letters, but that’s final. Am I understood?”
“What I’m saying is that we can stay longer if you want to see the city,” Steve clarified with a long-suffering tone, “we don’t need to rush to Lucerne.”
“Dummy’s probably just what he calls you for believing him,” Sam pointed out, and Bucky was nodding in agreement immediately. Steve could only stare at them.
“You should have seen his apartment, he lives in the fucking penthouse! His custom island counter probably costs more than my car, but he doesn’t even cook. How much do book editors make?”
“No, it’s alright,” Steve tried to explain; between the two of them, the Sno Ball eater looked like he was going through ‘worse.’ “I’m fine, I just needed to walk some nerves off, I’ll go outside.”
Clint laughed, and a moment later he shut the fridge and turned to grin at Steve over the counter full of steak and colorful vegetables. “He looks like a different person, doesn’t he?”
He does too many of his own stunts, he’s a great actor, he looks insufferably and unfairly good, and now he’s a gifted artist, too?”
“—Me!” Thor announced with a sudden boom, making Tony jolt upright and nearly knocking Bruce to the floor. “I’ll do it!”
Tony muttered a few choice words, but he stalled on his way to the sink, standing still and listening with a thoughtful expression. “Hey Steve,” he asked after a moment, “is that your phone?”
,” Steve whimpered breathlessly, but on the next heaving breath he collapsed into Bucky’s arms and sobbed into his shoulder. “Buck, you—they told me—you’re, you’re alive—”
The door opened and closed with a slam, and to Steve’s groan of discontent for being woken so rudely, Patrick said, “Aw shit, didn’t see you there, bro. Sorry, dude. Guess you saw the papers, huh?”
“Not since my cousins got really bored that one winter in Montana,” Tony grinned, barely even letting go of Steve’s hand for the security check. “I’ve never even seen Madison Square Garden before.”
That night, Steve had turned off his alarm. He’d put in enough hours at work already, and he was so tired by the time he and Tony crawled into bed to sleep that he wouldn’t be good to anyone if he didn’t get any sleep. And still his phone woke him much too early at 6:40 the next morning.
Captain Carter stepped out of her office and caught them on their way to the stairs. “Rogers, Barnes. A word.”
The bedroom had a nice view of the Royal Hospital Garden, but once Steve’s shirt had come off, Tony didn’t seem to care about anything other than Steve. His eyes briefly lingered on the body Steve had honed over the years before stalling on the large bruises that covered Steve’s right side from hip to shoulder.
“Turn on the lights, Steve,” Tony repeated in a commanding tone that had Steve biting his lip. “You come back here and fuck me, do whatever you want with me. Fill me with your come. But whatever you do,” he growled, pausing to be sure Steve was hanging on his every word. “Tonight, you keep your uniform on.”
“It had nothing to do with your height, honey,” Maria said when her boys eventually dared to put their hands down. “Besides, even if it was true, some medical trivia is more important than others. So what if you grew to be five-nine instead of five-ten?”
“You’ve done enough,” Clint told him absently, busy getting the grill started. “House never looked cleaner, Steve, you did good. Take it easy.”
All the way in LA, Tony snickered to himself knowingly, and hearing his gentle laugh soothed the last of Steve’s fears.
Steve stumbled to the nearest bench and dropped into a seat, a hand covering his heart. Tony dropped what he was doing and rushed over to him, kneeling on the porch and turning Steve’s face to look him in the eyes.
“You’ve done what to my meat?” Bucky asked at the same time as Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and, resigned to his fate, muttered, “
Steve took long, measured breaths in the early stages of fighting off his gag reflex. Every time he swallowed, his throat constricted and kneaded the length of Tony’s cock in quick pulses as his body tried to resisted the intrusion. Before Tony had the chance to adjust, Steve pulled back only to swallow him down to the root again, repeating it more eagerly and more quickly until he was bobbing on Tony’s cock, fucking his throat raw.
“And we already have a plan,” Natasha reminded him, waiting for Steve to look at her. She held his gaze for a long, steadying beat, his ever-present anchor. She inclined her head just so, her green light for the patchwork plan they’d thrown together, and already Steve felt better about it.
The dog tags landed over Tony’s sternum with a muffled, metallic clink. He lifted the two steel tags in his palm. Steven G. Rogers. Social, type O, Catholic. Sarah E. Rogers, Brooklyn, NY.
There, in Tony’s protective embrace, Steve dared to voice his fears. “I’m never leaving you and my mom alone together,
Bucky and Tony shared a look as the judge addressed the court, and Tony nodded in understanding. Once the judge finished, he was the first one on his feet to address the judge.
Steve glared at his friend who was clearly less subtle than a freight train. “They’re basic white dinner rolls, Buck,” Steve said through a smile of gritted teeth.
Assured of Tony’s agreement, Steve moved away from the couch at an unhurried pace to find Tony’s duffle bag. He didn’t look back to see what Tony did after he turned his back, but he listened carefully to keep track of him. First Tony’s belt dropped to the carpet with a muffled thud, and then he kicked off his polished shoes with enough force that they clattered into nearby furniture. Then, finally, Steve heard the distinct sound of a zipper being undone and Tony’s dress pants dropping to the floor in a distant whisper of fabric.
“Don’t project your weird fantasies onto me, Romanov,” Tony accused half-heartedly. “Wayne’s a looker, sure, fine. I’ll give you that. Richer than the devil. But he’s that worst kind of shady piece of shit. I know his kind; my dad was his kind. He’s too wealthy and has enough people in his pocket to keep getting away with any crime he likes. He’s got a dark side, I can just feel it, and I’ll expose him if it’s the last thing I do.”
“We’ve still got a few hours of daylight,” Tony told him in a impish whisper. “Unless… you’re still recovering?”
Tony couldn’t help but perk up a little. He hadn’t thought of it that way before, and if he was honest, Steve’s logic made sense. Besides, the story he could write would most likely get Steve exonerated anywa—
“Don’t have to,” Tony answered after a momentary silence. “Plenty of people divorce on the East Coast.”
“Sometimes, I get …a little rough. I’ve even been rough with you,” Steve said slowly, choosing his words with care. “I don’t mean to. I never mean to. But, something happens, a thought or a word, and it’s like a switch inside me. I have scared away partners in the past. Scared myself, if I’m honest. I never even thought I’d be able to tell anyone that I fantasize about hurting someone during sex—”
Tony was still pulling off the tags when Steve walked up behind him and gently rested his hands on Tony’s hips, loosely framing Tony’s ass with his hands. “Damn, Tony. These jeans were made for you. You look incredible.”
A gentle touch slid over his neck and down his shoulder, where long fingers curled with a proprietary comfort around his bicep. Steve startled out of his thoughts and jerked his arm away. He wasn’t sure what was happening, but whoever the man was, he was about to find out that Steve was more inclined to pushing back than people gave him credit for.
Steve looked like he was going to ask a question when a sudden flash of light startled them both. Tony turned and Steve looked up as another flash went off.
Casual displays of strength had a way of turning Tony into putty, and he wasted no time wrapping himself around his boyfriend, kissing the smug smirk right off Steve’s face. The intensity almost had Steve toppling backwards, but as satisfying as it may be to fuck Tony on a bed of scripts, Steve found his balance, hoisted Tony into a better grip, and carried his boyfriend to their bedroom.
“Just because I can do the job doesn’t mean they’ll overlook my experience,” Tony absently explained, though he sounded fairly distracted by what he was doing. It was only a black screen full of code that meant nothing to Steve, but Tony was typing away with a confidence and speed Steve rarely witnessed.
“There is no current evidence tying the three victims together, Mr. Stark. Different occupations, hobbies, backgrounds. Nothing, except for your books,” Steve said in a firm, patient tone. Tony’s gaze and attention returned to Steve, bewildered but suddenly focused. “If you are not the connection, then what is?”
“Hey, eight minutes is nothing to frown at,” Tony promised him with a hint of cheerful awe, and Steve laughed at how sincere Tony sounded. “I’m serious!”
“We wouldn’t be so worried about you if you came home every once in a while,” Clark reminded him gently, and somehow he managed to make it sound reasonable and sincere instead of the guilt trip Steve knew it was. But that, Steve had realized, was a Kent family super power, and it had nothing to do with Kryptonian biology.
“Pretty sure he could do worse than a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,” Steve observed seriously, which only had Tony grinning again.
“Yes,” Tony said again, more calmly and with more surety, and Steve smiled at him like that one word was everything he had wanted to hear. “Dinner,” Tony added, because his skin just itched in the silence between them. “Let’s do it. Now, today.”
“Almost,” Steve agreed without having to count. Some things you just knew, like how Valentine’s Day was days away, and how the six-month anniversary of their first date would land on the Ides of March. Steve wasn’t a superstitious man, but some coincidences were better than others.
It was everything else about the Captain’s presentation that left Tony speechless. Beads of sweat pearled over his skin and stretched over firm the curves of his body. As with any criminal being prepared for release, no cover had been provided for him, but by Tony’s general estimation, far too many nurses were in attendance to help wipe him off.
Steve pressed up against Tony’s back, boxing him in and pinning Tony to the wall until all Tony could see was Steve, and a glimpse of the apartments across the street through the tall window. The soft skin behind Tony’s ear, and the smooth, tan skin of his neck that always beckoned Steve were close enough to taste, but this wasn’t the time or place for Steve to indulge in any possessive urges.
The table of six had four people around it: Brock and Sharon, whom Steve recognized, and two other students Steve didn’t know that well, Phil and Jasper.
In a feigned moment of sobriety, Steve made a show of thinking it over and ultimately nodding in the affirmative. “Deal.”
“This is proof of a theory that begins to tell us about how quantum mechanics and relativity can work together; it is the first step in understanding how infinite power can exist on a nanoscale. This is the future.”
, he only tasted the promise of orgasm without its blissful release. He keened and arched his back, desperate for a new angle, anything, until Steve shifted his grip from Tony’s thigh to his calf, forcing his leg straight and adding to the tension of his position.
“I told her I was going to ‘meet the parents,’ and—it’s not like she knows much about my life, she just—I talk to her once a month at most, about what clothes I need,” Steve explained, the lie spilling from his lips easier with every word. “Maybe I said something, or, or she just extrapolated, but, uh. She sent me these.”
Steve pursed his lips and looked back in defiance. “I’m not answering that unless you’ll reward me with puppies.”
“As much as I’d love to test the range of this modulator you’re using,” he growled against the shell of Tony’s ear, “I don’t want to hear a sound out of you. This won’t take long.”
“They live in Africa,” Flora announced, eager to show him how much she remembered from their talk a few minutes ago. “They eat trees and leafs and sometimes they eat flowers, but that can be dangerous, and they have really, really long tongues so they can eat leafs on the tree.”
“We got three daddies on the hook, Steve had his first dates Sunday and today. You should see him now, he’s lost a lot of bulk these past two weeks. He looks like a budget Ryan Reynolds in the right light.”
Tony perked up at Steve’s elbow, and Steve momentarily forgot about Howard to see what that meant. When Tony noticed Steve looking at him, he just grinned and said, “I’m pretty sure they own
Rhodey threw his hands up in frustration and pointed aggressively at Tony, as if Steve didn’t know to whom he was referring. “Six feet, Steve: tip to tip, that bull’s horns were six fucking feet.”
“It’s gonna suck, but it’ll be worth it,” Steve said to comfort him the only way he could. “You’ll be gassy and you’ll dream of food without ever wanting to eat anything ever again, because you’ll always be so full you can’t take another bite, but I heard they’re scaling you up in post, so it’ll really look great.”
“About that, ma, I need to tell you something,” he told her as the tension in her arms eased into a gentle, rocking hug. “It’s good news and bad news.”
“Tony,” Steve reached for his hand before Tony got more than halfway off the couch, and with a gentle squeeze and a tug, he convinced Tony to sit back down. “It can’t be that bad. We’re working on communication, right?”
Tony turned his gaze down to the floorboards, where the dried fecal matter splattering up between the planks, the years of filth and scuff marks smeared in every direction could disgust him, but they wouldn’t hurt him.
“You were… a little, you know,” Bruce vaguely gestured to indicate Tony’s body. “Bigger. Seven to eight years ago.”
Chills ran down Tony’s spine as he realized what had happened. Those two weren’t dressed as Thing 1 and Thing 2 anymore - Sam was in a striking tuxedo, and Sharon was breathtaking in a white, silk gown. They were in the middle of saying their vows.
“But I didn’t do anything Stephanie hadn’t already done,” Clint observed quietly, “how did I break the curse?”
, it’s really funny looking, because it’s all coiled and bunched up, like a corkscrew telephone cord.”
Steve was barely conscious as Tony helped him slide off the table. How he made his way to the bathroom, Steve would never know. They left the weighted blanket on the bathroom floor as Tony walked Steve into the cavernous shower and washed his body clean. Water flowed like warm heavy rain from overhead, and Tony patiently guided Steve to a wide seat raised in one side of the shower. Steve dropped without complaint, and it wasn’t until he was off his feet that he realized how tired he was.
While Tony played host in the kitchen, Steve scanned the living room for a place to sit. The couch looked so soft it might swallow him whole, and the arm chairs looked so new and delicately made that he was afraid of breaking them under his weight. He was still standing awkwardly in the middle of the living room when Tony re-entered the room.
“Enhance your calm, Jane Foster,” Tony said gently, giving Jane a moment to gather herself. “In another time, in a world much different than ours, they were as real as you and I,” Tony promised her then in a calm, sobering voice. He might understand why a guardian might want their child to believe such hatred could not occur in the human mind, but Jane was an officer of the law. Soon, Jane would be invited to a stewardship and mature to gold class adulthood. She deserved to know the truth.
“Violet, do you know?” he whispered, rubbing her side gently in praise as her tail wagged at the sound of her name. “What a good girl, of course you know, you're so smart. Tony wants to be a pirate,
Tony gave the blond a quick but appreciative once-over, then with a poorly restrained smirk, shrugged in show of begrudging concession.
Around the bullpen, police officers gasped and audible struggled to breathe at the thought of such a heinous crime. Jane, who had been so close to facing the shock first-hand, barely managed to stay on her feet as she stumbled sideways into a seat before her legs gave out.
“My mom liked Paris,” Tony said quietly, and while that seemed to make sense to Carol, Rhodey loudly cleared his throat.
When he returned at the end of his shift, Steve left the four canisters he was assigned to fill that night. The sleeping human and his additional two canisters, he carried home with him.
He stared at his screen with unseeing eyes as Sam’s words sunk in. He spun on his heels to glare back, livid. “Did Bond lose my fucking car?”
“You… cooked?” Tony guessed, partly curious and partly in awe of how comfortably Steve was measuring out the flour and the sugar. He perched on a high stool at the workstation Steve had picked to work at, and watched Steve with rapt attention.
This time, Tony looked somewhat less confused, but he smiled at him again. A real smile, the ones that warmed Steve’s ears and made his toes curl with joy.
“Our preeminent Governor Alexander G. Pierce has sanctioned any and all resources in our power to stop and capture this maniac,” he told them. “Six Lieutenants MDK’d within tick tocks. He has intimate knowledge of our vehicles and our weapons, and enough information about our city to disappear. I ask you: what else is there to do ‘in our power’?”
From behind him, Steve snarled, a dark, fierce sound that silenced the room. The power of him, the unquestioned dominance raked through Tony’s body in a sudden rising swell of desire, leaving him shuddering and gasping with need. The thought of his lover, powerful and proud enough of his pet to fuck Tony in front of a full audience of creatures who craved the touch and taste of him, twisted in his mind as it appealed to the most immoral, depraved side of his character.
“Yelena Belova,” Tony confirmed, running the trace with both English and Russian spelling to be safe.
“Then I suggest you reconsider your priorities, kid,” Howard told him quietly, and pulled the car into park in the middle of a dark pasture. “You hurt my son, and you can kiss your apartments, your condos, and your beachfront California shithouse goodbye. That is a promise. Have I made myself clear?”
The meat of Tony’s ass jiggled with his bouncing body, and like some twisted call and response, Steve brought his big, open palm down on his eager ass with a crack, leaving a stinging bruise in the shape of his hand.
One right after another, the kids’ faces lit up. If Mr. Tony thought something was crazy, they knew it had to be better than a snow day.
Tony rushed down the stairs in his excitement to see Steve’s new clothes, and with both pride and admiration he paused here and there to settle the robes right over Steve’s silk vest and fix the starched folds of Steve’s high collar.
Steve and Tony both watched Bucky grab two donuts and march out. Again Steve felt Tony looking at him, but this time he gave in and met his questioning gaze.
For all the years he had been told never to go further than a handshake with a commoner, high-fiving the ten year old who had nearly dropped and then immediately caught his hot chocolate had been indescribable. Three young women had showed him the right way to eat a Trdelník without spilling, and it was a minor miracle his Steve had not come home with a sugar crash for all the rum hot cocoa he was drinking. But they had made it home without incident, and nothing worse than armfuls of presents and gift bags to carry back to the palace. Or, more specifically, for Bucky to carry back to the palace.
“Bite the comforter,” Steve told him, fucking him steadily and spreading his two fingers as much as he could once or twice more before his patience ran out. It would be good enough, and if Tony wanted to feel it, Steve would make sure he felt it.
“How much?” a slippery humanoid sitting to Steve’s left asked. It’s pet perched on its shoulder, with a tongue so long that it rested at its master’s feet. The tongue radiated heat even at a distance.
Steve snickered and rolled his eyes, thumping Tony on the back gently to interrupt his list before it went on too far. “That’s enough out of you,” he said with a smile, then with a playful squeeze of Tony’s hips, he said, “Go upstairs, get comfortable. I’ll be right behind you.”
“Brock! You go here, too? I’d forgotten all about that,” Steve laughed in feigned surprise, doing all he could to play it cool.
Steve paused the video. “I thought… that wasn’t what I thought he said,” he whispered into the attentive silence on the other end of the call. “I thought he was talking about your legs.”
“Mom, you packed us lunch,” Tony replied as he climbed out of the truck and slowly made his way to the porch. The last thing he needed was for her to find new reasons to worry, so he did his best to walk as casually as he could. “It was enough for both of us.”
Tony audibly floundered on the other end of the line, and oh how Steve kicked himself for dropping that particular line when he wasn’t there to see Tony’s face in person. If only he had had the time to cherish it.
“No,” Steve said with a big yawn, “gotta work. Gotta finish everything due next week. The Challenge is Saturday, and diving starts up on Monday again.”
A hammering on the bedroom door suddenly cut through the comforting silence, and Tony groaned at the pain of being startled awake.
Silence filled the room, until a senior Lieutenant dared to speak up. “With all due respect, Chief Director Nicholas Fury, Brock Rumlow has completed a dozen unsanctioned life terminations in less than 60 minutes. Does this truly fall to us? We’re police officers, we are not trained to handle this kind of violence.”
"Rogers, get this circus out of here. If you want my help, I'll get in there. You and me. And if you don't, fine, but this is not how you train to win. You won't last two rounds with training like this."
Without knowing the voice, Steve jolted upright and wiped at his wet face with his shaking hands in the vain hope that she wouldn’t realize he’d been crying.
“Fair enough,” he said, “my number is 918-432-1857. If you remember it, call me and we’ll find a time for that drink. Cause right now, I’m leaving. Bye-bye, darling,” he added, even blowing him a kiss as he passed to steer Bruce towards the curb and the nearest waiting cab.
Steve scrubbed his hands over his face, then with a heavy sigh he raised his gaze to look Tony in his eyes. He looked so tired. “It’s just work, one of my clients. She’s an exceptional scientist, a leader in her field, but no-one has gotten her to do any kind of promotion for her work—it screws with our marketing, and this is our first manuscript with her. If she doesn’t get good sales, a second manuscript would be a liability, and that’s—her work is great, I don’t want to lose her as a client.”
Steve frowned at him, flustered by where the conversation was going. Tony couldn’t possibly expect him to defend him after all the shit he pulled.
Murmurs started to flitter around the room while Tony stood at attention and listened to Chief Fury's frustrations, until both Tony and Fury were distracted enough to turn and see what was happening in the station. The far side of the bullpen became translucent before their eyes, and a map of New Yorseylvania filled the wall. A small red dot blinked in the middle.
From wet, borderline slurping sounds in the foreground, Bond’s silence, and Belova’s crooning cries of pleasure, it was easy to guess what act Bond and Belova were enjoying. But Tony’s reaction to it was unlike his experience with 008 and 004. With them, he could focus on surrounding sounds, details that the agent might miss while on the job. For 008, he maneuvered the harem’s security cameras to keep his in-depth interrogation secret from overzealous guards.
Steve gave Tony a book of centuries old folk stories that his parents told him before bed when he was a young boy. In return, Tony gave him Dag Hammarskjöld’s
“Do you remember what we did for my birthday this year?” Steve asked Tony instead, apropos of nothing.
“We’re going home,” Steve said, his expression pinched with concern. “I think you’re bleeding a little.”
Wherever he was from, Steve was perfect and Tony’s loyal, reliable, hard-working partner. If the kiss hadn’t left him reeling already, the potential consequences of all this sure did. Steve had ruined him for anybody else, no other partner would do if they were separated. Tony had refused to work with a partner until Fury hoisted farm-boy Rogers on him eight months ago, but Tony was a different man now. They both were.
His faith in his Queen was rewarded soon after her thirty-fourth birthday when they received news that her latest pregnancy had advanced into the twentieth week. After so many unlucky years, they were finally expecting a healthy baby boy.
“Did you intentionally miss your second shot?” Tony was asking as they regrouped, and as one of the few people comfortable enough to do so, Bucky blatantly rolled his eyes at him.
“I’m glad you got in before the storm,” Steve told him in a quieter, more serious voice. “They were talking about shutting down Logan for the afternoon planes, there’s a blizzard hitting tonight. It’s going to be bad for a few days.”
“Look, I’m starving,” he explained, and sure enough, they were illegally parked outside of the Shake Shack. “Circle the block, I’ll call you when I’m out.”
for his touch. His heart had never thundered and stopped at the same time, and panting, he tried to respond.
“Her name is Natasha?” Steve asked thoughtfully as he pushed off the half-wall he’d been perching on to lead the way to the car. “Yeah, you don’t stand a chance.”
“To be continued in person?” Tony suggested when he’d collected himself, the smile clear in his voice. “Maybe over dinner, with our clothes on?”
Steve gave it a curious look and carried it home with the rest of the papers and bills and advertisements. “Hey, babe? There’s a package for you.”
This time, Steve defied his expectations. Instead of disgust, or heartache, or even pity, Steve’s expression was thoughtful.
“Hawley’s firm is representing a major divorce case worth millions and her caseload is so heavy she’s taking on first-year interns.”
“I, uh,” Tony glanced back over his shoulder at the Emily sign, then quickly turned back to Steve to say, “burgers, actually. A burger, singular. Have you had the Emmy burger?”
“No! No,” Tony rushed to say, and before Steve had a chance to answer him, he dug out a new toothbrush from the bag of necessities they’d picked up from Walgreens on their way back. “Bathroom?”
it felt good, and he knew Steve was intimately familiar with that particular expression on Tony’s face. He stroked slowly, drawing it out, occasionally grinding the heel of his palm against the tip until he hissed from the grazing hint of pain and sudden spark of pleasure. He did it again, filming himself as he rubbed his palm in small circles over the head of his cock and he threw his head back, even biting his lip in a shameless show of indulgent desire.
Steve’s whole body tensed against Tony’s back like an extension of himself. Tony only had a moment to realize that Steve was rearing up for fight or flight, then in the next heartbeat, Steve sprinted away.
“The daddy today mentioned traveling,” she eventually said. “Slachter. He works in San Francisco and wants a baby who’s flexible enough for his lifestyle. Something about it… let’s say it caught my attention.”
That following Tuesday, Tony was the first to arrive at the Bronx Zoo. Between Steve, his student teachers, Tony, and parent volunteers, the kids were separated into six groups for the excursion.
Tony gave him a few minutes to adjust and relax before holding up a chip. “Dorito?” he asked, and Steve opened his mouth without question. Instead, Tony stuffed the chip into his own mouth to delight in Steve’s look of disgruntled surprise, then fed him two chips immediately after.
“That’s your face, you know,” he whispered as he softly brushed away Tony’s tears of laughter from his cheeks. Tony rolled his eyes good-naturedly, but rather than giving some smart answer he softly took Steve by his ears and guided him closer for grateful, lingering kisses.
Even children growing up in old Terrini were not taught the full devastation of their hard-won independence. Even now, unified and increasingly prosperous, it was too soon. Those from old Machtberg knew next to nothing.
Steve’s outrage turned to confusion as he tried to process how an exclusive, luxury hotel across from a university campus could—wait, no. No, that part actually made perfect sense. This would be excellent hunting grounds for those of negotiable affections and means.
“Won’t you get in trouble for not having them?” he asked anyway, because offering to purchase him a replacement wasn’t out of the question.
“You don’t have to do this,” Tony assured him, even pulling Steve closer by the belt-loops of his jeans to nuzzle at his sternum. “And you really don’t need to get dressed, like, ever. It’s a crime.”
“Are you sure?” Tony asked, the relief clear in his voice even though he was trying to whisper. “Won’t you… you know. Want some space?”
“Ohh, my god! Phil, it’s you,” he cheered happily, intentionally changing his voice to sound more effeminate. “You saved my life last week, Harper had the best time with you!”
Tony walked up to the unassuming little restaurant on Cahuenga. Nobody bothered him, nobody stopped him for autographs or questions, or did any of the things that he knew happened to Steve on a regular basis. Quietly, he prayed he’d been right about this place, that he had chosen a small enough spot that even the people’s Captain America could walk in for dinner in peace.
Then, from out of nowhere, he heard the familiar jangling of Marple’s tags. It was the most beautiful sound he’d ever heard, and by some miracle it was accompanied by light, nimble footsteps running towards him.
Natasha hesitated a moment longer to give her a chance to change her mind, then stood up to address the judge. “Your Honor, those terms are acceptable.”
“Yes, and who do you usually pick up with that kind of outfit?” Sharon interrupted him to point out.
“Steve,” he whispered, his voice so soft it was almost lost to the sound of Howard pounding at the door. “Steve, it’s Sweden.”
“No different than before, ma,” Steve assured her, lest she get excited about a reunion. “We call once, twice a month. He moved to Geneva two months ago, now the time difference is weird. We’re just friends.”
Tony watched him with a reluctant but undeniable lust in his eyes, but when Steve swept two fingers over the head of his cock to gather the first of the precum and offer it to Tony, he was quick to lean in take Steve’s hand in both of his, bring it to his mouth, and suck the come off of  Steve’s fingers.
“They gave you the good stuff, huh?” Tony noted dryly. “Keep it together for two more minutes, would you?”
him,” Steve replied, adjusting in his seat, half-heartedly busying himself with putting little touches here and there for highlights and shadows while Sharon got herself settled on her end of the work bench.
“You’re not free,” Bucky hissed in undertone, but it must have been quiet enough in the bank that his voice carried.
If Steve could’ve talked, he would have told Tony he didn’t want to be thinking, thank you very much. The way Tony was working the lather over his shoulders and his back, all Steve wanted to do was lean against Tony’s solid weight and give in to sleep. But his tongue was uncooperative and his lips couldn’t do it all on their own.
From a distance Tony watched the familiar faces smile at his excitable, angelic demonspawn, then turn back to give him judgmental side-eyes. He groaned inwardly and tried to pick up his pace. She focused better when Tony ran faster, but damnit, waking up was slow-going this time of year. The weather was cool and just a touch chilly, and the dim light of dawn cast through the trees just enough to make everything cozy. He didn’t want to run, he wanted to crawl back into bed!
“Yeah, that’s better, you’ll be alright,” he said with a smile. “Looks like you’ve put a bad day behind you.”
“Likely, but not confirmed, and not a priority,” Steve replied, fairly succinctly. “Buck, Rumlow escaped Cryo—” when Bucky’s jaw dropped and he looked about ready to start shouting, Steve rushed to hold up a hand and talk over him. “No time for questions: he’s out, and he’s after the person or people who lead the Scraps. We can’t find him on the surface, so I believe he’s down here, hiding among you or in the tunnels on his own. We need to get back and warn your leader right now.”
But Tony had traced those detonators back to a warehouse in Singapore. Her uncharacteristically desperate and rather clumsy attempt to get that piece of information out of him only corroborated his find and made him less willing to give it up. Every sliver of intelligence Tony had found was already in Bond’s hands courtesy of Lucy’s secure connection. Tony could only hope it was enough to bring Scorpius down. Steve deserved justice for all the pain he suffered, as did the families of the hundreds lost or injured on that day. Given the choice, Tony would rather die knowing his work afforded Bond a meaningful head start.
Tony waved off whatever Steve was about to say, busying himself instead with putting out Steve’s painkillers and connecting his phone to charge so Steve could reach both easily on his bedside table.
- Golden Globes ceremony, Steve and Tony attend together; the former is very much anxious and excited about who might take home Best Actor in Motion Picture Drama, while the latter is convinced De Niro is taking it home for
“You don’t like octopus?” Tony asked tactfully as he could, and picked up one of the curled up cooked tentacles with his fork to try. It was chewier maybe than what Steve was used to, but the octopus was fresh and the flavor of the herbs and wine came through without the fishy stink.
As they walked by St. Paul’s, Steve pointed out Friday Street, where Londoners once gathered to buy fish on Fridays, and Bread Street that centuries ago was filled with bakers and their delicious treats. There was Milk Street and Honey Lane, and farther from the water they came to Poultry. Steve explained that Poultry, along with the rest of the butchers and cattle merchants were able to be this far from the port because of how they received their goods. Bakeries and fishmongers relied on wheat shipments or fishermen who delivered by the Thames, but cows, sheep, pigs, birds were walked into the city from Smithfield, a meat market that had helped shape London and England since medieval days. It wasn’t by accident that highways like the A1, A40, and 201 all touched Smithfield. Today they were highways that led into the city center, but centuries ago, the two broad streets where designed to allow cattle to reach Cheapside, which ironically was an old word for ‘marketplace’ and had nothing to do with low prices.
Tony, Bruce, and Thor spent the next afternoon transforming Thor’s apartment into something approaching a respectable home office. By the time they had to stop for Tony and Steve’s four o’clock appointment, the floors were polished, the shelves and tables were tidy, and natural light flooded his living room. They tucked fresh white sheets over the couch and the armchair, pinning the folds into place until they looked as good as new, then hid what they couldn’t fix under plush blankets and pillows from Bruce’s apartment.
“Is it your first time dining with us, sir?” the valet asked with a kind smile. When Steve confirmed her suspicion, the young woman pointed to another woman in the same valet uniform red kimono. “Mina will help you, she has the list of all parties invited for the evening.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but he reached down to undo his jeans. “You sure know how to make this all feel special.”
Tony opened his mouth, but no words came out. Again, he tried, and he failed. Finally, he shook his head, then nodded, he mumbled his agreement.
Tony might not have understood their means of communication, but he wasn’t blind. The first image demonstrated severe glandular infections, and Tony jerked in sudden horror, pressing closer to Steve and turning to hide his face in Steve’s lap.
“Many of his changes are for the improvement of society, James Barnes,” Tony insisted, “there are no diseases, no maternal or infant mortality—unlike the 21st, we respect human life, gender and sexual orientation are no longer of concern. All children have families. Emotional health is equally important as physical health.”
At first, Steve had taken the cautious, conservative approach of filling the first canister before beginning on the second. The fine needles were too small for human comprehension, and even when they all pushed through into the bloodstream for the harvest, the sensation was either entirely negligible relative to the pleasure of orgasm, or, in many cases, the sting only added to the climactic ecstacy.
Steve spun around in surprise to see Tony stepping out of the patisserie, a look of concern clear in his expression. He seemed to have sized up Steve’s hurt side in an instant, his hand held awkwardly in the space between after an aborted attempt to better see what had happened. Steve smiled when he wanted to wince, and stood up straight when his body only wanted to rest. Gently, he took Tony’s hand in his and brought it to his lips, kissing the soft skin of Tony’s hand and his calloused knuckles before simply holding his hand.
“Or that Lois Lane is your mother,” Clark added with a proud smirk. It was usually adorable to hear how proud he was of mom, but it really wasn’t helping right now. Not after a day of listening to Tony’s excitement over an invitation to Wayne’s annual charity masquerade ball. Yes, it was very exclusive, and yes, it was the perfect opportunity to dig up some dirt, but that wasn’t why Tony was excited.
Steve had not wandered out into the city to find him, but he had heard of this youth center, this little hole in the wall spot in Malasana between the hip restaurants and funky bars where boxing was turned into a healthy pass-time and basics of self-defense for young children who had few alternatives otherwise. And sure, he didn’t speak Spanish and they didn’t really speak English, but Google Maps still understood what he wanted to find, and he got there in the end. One day he just walked in, surprising the kids with a visit to make them happy and support a space that's introducing them to boxing in a positive way for positive reasons, and he wouldn't even really think to stay for too long - he wasn't there to disrupting anything, after all - but when he walked in, the first thing he saw somewhere in the middle of a gaggle of teens taking turns on the punch mitts was Tony. He had yet to turn away from the kids, and only his back was turned to Steve, but Steve could have recognized him anywhere.
“Such a good girl,” Tony murmured in praise once she was (relatively) calm, punctuating it with a kiss between her eyes. “Fine. Whatever: you win, Missy. No surprise there. Go get your ball, I’ll put on pants or, or …something. It’s supposed to be cold, right?”
Steve couldn’t remember how he got to the garage or any of the drive until he took the wrong turn on a one-way and realized what he was doing. With a quick touch on the break, a change in gear, and a turn of the wheel he swung his Porsche around in the right direction, barely aware of the chaos he left in his wake.
“We’re going to get caught and turned into the police,” Steve grumbled to himself while he systematically made his way along the walls and behind paintings, feeling for any grooves or inconsistencies that might give a safe away. “This is not an acceptable reason to go to prison, Tony.”
“This isn’t funny!” Steve complained, but Tony’s attempt to silence himself only made him snort loudly. Steve shouldn’t have found it endearing.
“I know, I know,” Steve said as he led the way out to the kitchen and checked on the pizza. It wasn’t ready yet, but instead of asking his dad to put his heat vision to use, he let it keep cooking at normal speed and made his way to the fridge instead. “Beer?”
“Make it happen, Carter,” he called over his shoulder, barely even invested in the conversation anymore. “Foster first.”
“Alright, the last question,” Karl said as he glanced back at his cards, “Tony, it’s your chance to tie this up. What movie first inspired Steve to become an actor?”
“Why did you tell her?” she asked. “You could’ve waited a week when you’re dating the guy or something.”
“So eager, Tony, you’re leaking,” Steve said with a laugh, and easy as breathing, he scooped Tony into his arms to carry to his workstation. “On your knees today, then? Give your legs a break?”
No matter what time of day Tony would wake, he always found Steve lying beside Tony in the same position as he slept in, with his arm wound around Tony’s body and his hand resting possessively over Tony’s soft cock. If his master was impatient, or they had appointments to get to, sometimes Tony would be woken by the feeling of Steve’s fingers loosely wrapped around his shaft, and tugging on Tony’s cock.
“I can see your thoughts spiraling, Tony,” Steve whispered, combing his fingers through Tony’s hair and making Tony look him in the eyes again. “Sweetheart, look at me. I’m fine—hell, I’m better than most. I got my diploma in the end, I got my college education. The government paid for tuition and housing. Now I’ve got a career and a life that most people envy. But I thought… I thought I’d be alone. People look at you differently when they find out you’re a foster kid, that—that you were homeless. But to meet someone like you,” he said, smiling at Tony with deep affection. Tony could only stare back at him; what he wouldn’t give to meet all those people who gave up on Steve, to get his hands on them.
Steve couldn’t stop smiling. “I won’t see Charlie until the end of August,” Steve promised with a touch of mischief in his excitement. “You didn’t hear it from me, but maybe… maybe, you know. You’ll have something from me by then. Something even better.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony asked, stepping in closer and reaching to squeeze Steve’s arm gently. “You alright? You’re pale.”
“Uh—yeah, yeah, it is,” Tony said, mustering a fake smile so that he would at least sound pleasant over the phone. Steve didn’t need to know about his suspicions yet, but for the sake of future discussions, he turned the phone on speaker and gently laid the phone down on his desk.
a traitorous little voice whispered. They would know of his cottage then; even if these Women of the East did not take him, they could tell others of his home.
Steve snorted in a burst of unexpected laughter. The audience howled with amusement and Tony bit his lip to temper his own bark of laughter into poorly contained giggling. Even Graham rolled over in his seat so the cameras wouldn’t catch him cackling on national television.
“You know what we didn’t talk about yet?” Tony said with an air of mystery that had Arlene quieting a little and peering at him through her tears.
“Thanks, Rachel. Cold water and hot, black coffee, please,” Steve replied with a pleasant smile, as if the woman hadn’t just offered to spend the weekend naked on a beach licking butter off his body at her own place of work. Did a country founded by convicts even
Since they hadn’t exchanged books over Christmas, Tony took Steve to the library maintained in the castle. They set a timer for twenty minutes and spent every second of that time finding a book for the other to read.
During their twenty-two month relationship, Steve enjoyed the coveted front row seat to Tony’s dogged dedication to his work, to doing right by the victims and their families, and - in the end - landing the opportunity of a lifetime with the FBI. They’d been comfortably between the ‘drawer at his place’ and ‘meeting the parents’ relationship milestones when Tony moved to Virginia.
He would return. They needed him; as disliked as Steve was, sometimes Sharon felt like she was the only one who knew how badly they needed him.
It could have been a chance to grow closer, to bond through their shared trauma of those forty fearful minutes. Instead, Steve took it as a wake-up call. The consequences of their behavior had quickly become clear, and while Tony maintained that his time shared with Steve was worth the risk of occasional opportunists, Steve couldn’t take it anymore. He could not be the reason why the team protecting Tony didn’t immediately treat his disappearance as an urgent concern.
His resistance gave the cops pause. They glanced at each other, then turned to look at their leader. The leader pulled out his device again, and sounded like his feelings had been hurt when he told it, “Maniac is disinclined to cooperate.”
“A foster family took me in when I was two. I was sick with a lot of stuff, and it became too much trouble, so they gave me back. That became the pattern, I was placed with, well. Until I was eight. I could breathe better by then, but I was small, and I got into fights in school. Once I was ten, eleven, families wouldn’t really want me. Then, I came out when I was fifteen. That was a nightmare. So, I ran away. I was homeless for almost three years,” he added before Tony had to ask. “It wasn’t so bad when I was younger, I could sleep in youth shelters pretty regularly. They’d always find a space for a fifteen year old, a sixteen year old. But at seventeen, you’re practically an adult, there’s no special treatment. There’s really only one thing you can do then, and it got bad, for a time. Winters, especially.”
Thor frowned, his pleasant expression suddenly dark and grave. “Do you take me for an imbecile, Stark?”
Sitting had been the wrong decision. Steve hadn’t finished his question before Tony’s eyelids started drooping and his whole body listed to the side. The second the pressure was taken off his feet, gravity started pressing on him with insurmountable power and Tony could only manage to hum in some general acknowledgement to a question he hadn’t heard or understood.
“Listen, son,” she said so plainly Steve blinked at her in surprise. He’d expected a threat, or a come-on, but direct, simple talk was a happy surprise. “Tony’s alone out in that Yankee city. I can see it, we all can. Do you care about him?”
Steve cleared his throat. He didn’t mean to scrub his floury, sweating palms dry on his jeans, and he definitely didn’t mean to rub the back of his neck, but at least he caught himself before he did it twice. He stilled his hands at his sides and made himself look Tony in the eye.
The rope turned out to be a makeshift halter and lead for the horse. Tony called over his shoulder to Steve that he’d be just a minute, but he might have been even faster than that at getting Dummy strapped in. He leapt up the porch and made his way to Steve with a grateful kiss.
“Oui,” Tony teased, sidling in close to Steve’s side. “Would you be my date to the ball, Steve Rogers?”
And just like that, Steve’s momentary discomfort was forgotten. He laughed, a heartfelt, carefree belly laugh; affection swelled in his chest, and he pulled Tony in tight against his side, until he could nose into Tony’s soft hair and kiss the crown of his head.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him, both amused and suspicious at Steve’s sudden interest. “Why the sudden interest, Sparky?”
Steve sat in awe of the performance before him. Only hours ago, he’d had no hopes for his friend’s case - Hansen’s arguments against him had seemed to be irrefutable, and for Bucky to simply say he didn’t have a memory of those events had filled Steve with anxiety. But if Tony wasn’t ahead now, he was at the very least equal to whatever Natasha and her team had pulled together.
Maria walked up to them before Tony had a chance to find her, and with a smile she told them, “Reverend Stanley is ready whenever you are. Come on, dad’s got the papers for you to sign.”
“Of course, I should explain that back then I thought I was being a good girl,” she eventually continued with her perfectly normal story once the laughter had calmed, and Tony seemed to have come up for air at exactly the wrong time. With tears of laughter still wet in the corners of his eyes, he waited with bated breath to hear how that sentence might possibly end.
“Warm me up in your bed,” Tony whispered, reaching to brush the pad of his thumb over Steve’s full bottom lip. “I’ve been waiting all week, Steve. It’s baby-making time, are you really going to make me wait any longer?”
Tony did his best not to draw too much attention to the casual touch, and instead made a show of pouting up at Steve. “You don’t remember? It was only last week, Steve. Batman Returns? You stood up for me when Andre the Angry Giant got in my face.”
Steve did as he was told, but he couldn’t help but stare. He’d never met a male manicurist before. “You?”
“Something to check off the list before he shows up on set this summer?” Josh said with a laugh. “If Spider-Man is mysteriously written out of the fifth Captain America movie… we’ll know why. But to bring it back, this story, we’ve had some questions amongst ourselves now of why, what brought you to this project. I believe this was your only project last year, is that right? What was it about this story that stood out to you?”
Tony put on another of the jeans his mother had bought him, one that didn’t have two days worth of grime and sweat caked into it, and found the oldest church-appropriate button up in his closet. It was a little short at the sleeves, but it fit, so he buttoned it up, tucked it in, and picked a tie.
“Yeah, sure, help would be great,” Tony said after a beat, smiling again for the first time since Howard spoke. “Who knows? Maybe with your help, we’ll finish early.”
“You gave me advice about the professors,” he said in recognition, his lips picking up in a hesitant smile. He reached out to accept the box she held up for him. “It doesn’t come with a cord?”
“I really am proud of you, you know,” Tony said a few minutes later. “This will be a great role to dip your toes in comedy. At least I’ll be there; I always love laughing at you.”
Steve wanted to scream. He wanted to curse, to call her names, punch Brock in the mouth for letting anybody talk about him that way.
“—is a goddamn name trace on Yelena Belova,” Bond was impatiently whispering into the phone. Q’s silent treatment didn’t bring out the best in 007, but as nasty as the agent could be, Tony felt real urgency in his tone.
If he didn’t personally know Happy, this whole scenario would feel so bizarre. As it happened, Steve’s face split in a wide grin and he hopped into the back without needing to be told twice. Flowers
Bucky nodded in understanding, then with a sly grin he much too casually asked, “Hey, how’s Steve doing? Up and walking again?”
Steve was stunned. The comment came right out of left field, an arrangement of words that Steve never thought he would hear. He stared at Tony as if he’d told him Santa decorated his front porch with Rudolph’s hide.
“Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition, Captain. I have an entire city to govern, it is frightfully consuming business.”
“So sue me, I don’t like it when you bleed outside of Kansas state lines,” his mom replied irritably. “Can you see the bone?”
“Maybe he’s into extreme sports and wants people on call? He’s got the money to spare,” Steve reasoned.
“Again, squeeze,” Steve said in a dark tone, and Tony didn’t hesitate. He squeezed down on the hollow void Steve had left in his body. A good amount of Steve’s come gushed out of his body and over his ass, leaving a wide, sticky trail down to his lower back.
If Tony didn’t know him any better, he’d say that Steve looked taken aback. “Really?” he cleared his throat and swallowed before trying again. “I thought you liked Mr. Wayne.”
Steve looked caught between hopeful disbelief and confusion. “I don’t understand,” he finally admitted. “How?”
“My love, I believe we must fire all of our attending staff,” Tony began with a begrudging smirk. “There is an alarming rash of insubordination spreading among them. Coulson left clear instructions forbidding me from calling you this morning. Forbade
Slowly, Steve turned to face his friend and offered him the file. “We’re aging,” he said without any preamble. “The serum doesn’t affect normal cell degeneration.”
Steve washed his hands at normal speed and squeezed out a generous amount of ointment over his cut before trying to single-handedly wrap the band-aid around his finger.
Fuck communications, the most pointless of all cations. Vacation, supplication, lubrication, fornication. Replication. Lactation wasn’t one of them, but Tony enjoyed the way it sounded, and he gave it an honorable mention. In a weak moment of spite, Tony thought he wouldn’t be surprised to hear Steve was struggling in the damn class. Nobody with a decent understanding of
Steve’s heart would have melted if his cock wasn’t suddenly hogging all the blood. “Sweetheart,” he whispered, but hell if it didn’t feel so messed up to say that to this strange face looking back at him. “I appreciate what you’re doing for me, but I’m not, I won’t hurt you—I don’t have lube, and you’re not—I mean, uh. We don’t have time to get ready.”
Later that night, Tony would all but drown himself in tapas and wine (and wine, and wine, and wine) and complain about how perfect Steve still was and how he didn’t deserve to be punched in the face for a living. That face was too perfect. Rhodey, it'd be like punching Michaelangelo's David in the face, and wasn’t that a war crime? And when Tony's finally stopped ranting long enough to breathe, Rhodey'd casually point out, you know, he thinks we're together, right?
“I actually did have some plans in mind,” he told her apologetically. “We haven’t had a chance to talk about it yet, but the Gardner Museum is celebrating 25 years of Artist-in-Residence with music, dance, food, and an art class.”
They came to a halt at the iconic roundabout where they could see the equestrian statue of Charles the First, the monumental Nelson’s Column, and the National Gallery beyond. They followed along to the left at an unhurried pace, and Tony only stopped when he noticed a particular street sign. He tugged at Steve’s jacket, and unthinking, Steve stepped in close and leaned in closer still to look down the street Tony was turned towards, as if some little easter egg would be uncovered if he looked carefully enough.
“We fix this, and you’ll be free tonight?” Tony asked pointedly, putting the phone to his ear while he waited for Thor to pick up.
“I called Sam. He’s on his way, he’s better at this,” Tony said in the end, quiet and defeated. Steve hated the sound of it and wanted so badly to assure Tony that it wasn’t his fault, but he felt strangely disconnected from his body that by the time he moved Tony was gone.
The unexpected sound of two loud beeps startled Tony and Thor, and they both turned to see a new Harley Davidson low rider come to life behind them; it took a moment, but Tony turned around to look at the blond stranger again, and sure enough, he was holding up his keychain with a fob between his fingers.
Holland was far enough south that the brisk spring night felt mild compared to London. Steve wandered along one of the many canals in the city, listening to the ringing in his headphones while he kept an eye on the camera feed on his phone.
“I am your king,” he said, speaking as simply and as calmly as he could while trying not to get any more of the sewage in his mouth. “I am home, and I need your help.”
“Same difference,” Tony sniffed before taking a long sip of his drink to hide his horrendously pleased smirk.
“Flora, that’s perfect!” Tony praised and held his hand up at her height for an easy high-five. “You’re absolutely right. And what do you think the weather is like in Africa?”
Distantly, Tony felt how Steve continued fucking him for minutes, days, weeks, but his body had given up responding. His spent cock twitched insistently with the overwhelming and shocking pleasure he’d never known before, streaking the sheets with come long after he should have stopped.
. In answer to a question he’d never thought to ask himself, his libido clearly didn’t care that Tony’s interest in this moment was about Steve’s fake dating profile designed to catch a serial killer - it only mattered that Tony still had an interest in Steve’s anything.
“He doesn’t have many friends, you know,” Rhodes said before Steve had a chance to acknowledge Bucky’s point. “I just wanted to talk to you before you forget the good stuff you had, and ask that, you know. Wait, don’t wait, that’s none of my business. But when Tony calls, be a friend to him and pick up? He doesn’t have enough friends to lose you, too.”
“Stop. Just, stop,” Bucky said with a quiet sigh before Tony’s ramble really put him to shame. “Thank you, Tony. That’s… nice of you. It smells nice, too.”
“Sixty-forty,” Mr. Perfect repeated, grinning now. “She looks like more of a ball-loving dog to me.”
“This is making less sense the more you explain,” Steve told her after a beat. “Do they still serve burritos?”
“We can’t discount it,” Steve wryly agreed. “But since Tony hasn’t uploaded the pages and he’s editing these previews himself, whoever it is must have been watching us that night.”
He never meant to put someone in harm’s way, and especially not a man who was trying to make this budding relationship work. Steve, who was too mature to play games, who would call him with well-thought out dates that were genuinely fun and exciting, and not predictable fast-track lanes into his pants. Steve, who probably wouldn’t have been jealous enough to kiss him without consent if he hadn’t been flirting with Amanda, or wouldn’t be balling up his fists and clenching his jaw if Tony wasn’t purposefully pushing his buttons. Steve, who was handsome and well off, but worked hard and showed interest in learning about Tony’s work.
Taken with what Bucky had learned through Natasha, the threads of evidence were finally starting to weave a clearer story. Steve had to tell Bucky; whatever happened in his personal life had to come second to the case. Lives literally depended on it.
“…okay, can’t be sure by phone, but it looks legit,” Tony muttered mostly to himself, and there was a quick clicking sound. “You’re on speaker with my students. Could you open one of them up?”
“I like that!” Steve said with a big smile, “he’s incredible, yeah. I’ll call him tomorrow so he knows, or you know, I guess, ask if he’ll have availability then.”
Everything was going well until Hawley’s secretary leaned into the office again and informed him he was expected at Hawley’s office. Steve thanked her, then double checked the time. The meeting wasn’t due to begin for another thirty minutes. Much too late, Steve recalled Natasha’s words from earlier that morning—Hawley wanted to see him before the meeting, and he should expect to be kicked off the team.
“Almost anything that we do together, you’ll only have my preferences as your reference,” Tony reminded him with a sly smirk that only spelled trouble. “Steve, you’re not a pity project or a lover with training wheels. You’re just learning to change gear from women to men, and where you see inexperience, I see someone whose skills are exclusively tailored to pleasing
