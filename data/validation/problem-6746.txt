“Okay cool.” Peter agreed opening a new tab on his tablet. “And Mamma?” he looked up at Tony again, “I’m still really sorry about earlier.”
Steve’s brow creased and he reached out for Tony, saying his name softly, but the Billionaire pushed him away and rubbed harshly at his face.
“It’ll be fine.” Steve assured him, after all, he’d eaten worse back in the war. A broken yoke, and some burned sausages were nothing compared with the ration packs he’d lived off.
“I think you need to stop or she’ll start saying that too.” Spiderman warned him, “And wow, she’s really advanced isn’t she?”
“Feeling better now, little Champ?” Steve asked Zach, who nodded his head but made his way back to his Mamma, taking his hand, he might have stopped crying but he wanted to be close to Tony for the day.
“Let’s get everything packed away and then have some dinner.” Steve said feeling his stomach rumble with hunger.
“We were attacked.” Steve said wetting a cotton wool ball with disinfectant, he bent to start cleaning the cuts on Tony’s side, but the Omega pulled away.
“J, what do you think the odds are of me getting Steve into a thong on the beach?” He asked as he finished packing the case.
“Sure.” Clint declared, “And whoever hits Nat on the bum gets to decide the ice cream flavour for reward.”
Desperation got him moving again and he grit his teeth, ignoring his throbbing legs and back, making himself climb higher and higher until he finally reached the surface level and opened the door which lead into what looked to be a cafeteria. There was several dozen people in Hydra uniforms sat at the tables eating and drinking, talking in low voices.
Peter did so without difficulty and did the same with his legs which satisfied the Doctor that he had not suffered paralysis or brain damage. Especially when Peter recounted what had happened at Oscorp without difficulty.
Tony frowned, was this how they were going to do make ups? With gifts? Huh, he’d rather they had sex really….
Zach was sleepy, he’d burned off his energy running around the amusement park and spending time on the beach making sand castles and playing chicken with the waves. He could barely keep his eyes open as Tony washed him and brushed his teeth, changing him into his pyjamas, carrying him through to bed.
Steve hoped he’d managed to thank Tony, but he was pretty sure all he managed were a few vague noises as he let Tony lead him out into what could only be described as a luxury apartment and that was only the living room!
What was worse Tony wasn’t sure. Being tortured in cave by terrorists, finding out his Alpha had betrayed him and set him up to be killed, then tried to kill him again when that hadn’t worked, or finding out he was pregnant by said Alpha after their final show down which had resulted in said Alpha’s death.
Zach came and sat on Steve’s lap with Peter at his side. No one had any news for anyone, they were still just waiting for the surgery to end. They were still waiting when Rhodey arrived a short while later and took up the spare seat on Steve’s left, his armour stationed at the end of the room besides the door.
Jarvis suspected Maximoff’s involvement but had not proven anything yet, neither had he found a cure or a way to block any influence she might be having.
“We have our orders, we should follow them.” It sounded lame even to his own ears and Stark certainly wasn’t impressed.
The Billionaire look exhausted and pale, he had an oxygen canula in his nose and bandages about his head that were tinged slightly red where the laceration on his scalp was.
Tony hummed contentedly and let his eyes go half lidded, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere, and only paid half attention to the story that Thor had begun to tell Zach and Peter of the times he and the Warriors three had camped out and what they had gotten up to during those times, the epic tales that would be told and the songs sung of past victories.
“This is why you are not in charge of diplomatic relations between hero teams.” Steve said with a grin. Tony and Reed’s dislike of each-other was amusing, except when it was in public and caught on camera, which was why Steve and Natasha kept Tony away from the Fantastic Four, and Sue kept Reed away from the Avengers. It saved a lot of headaches.
“Great. So, back to this, we seriously need to start locking down plans, Pepper has been on my ass and not in the good way about this.” Tony gestured to the holographic images of various wedding locations and themes to Steve. “We need to get somewhere booked and make some serious decisions on what we want.”
“Stark?” Natasha didn’t bother to hide her snort, “You know what he’s like when it comes to being responsible Sir, and I’m afraid Rogers is unhappy with how Shield handled the invasion.”
It was done with the same eat shit, devil may care smirk and arrogant swagger as when Tony complimented himself, calling himself a genius, the worlds best playboy, the most handsome avenger etc. But if you looked closely, if you bothered to look at his eyes and study his expressions, then you could see that the swaggering and snark were nothing but a mask that Tony had been maintaining for years. That he hid behind as if it were armour, never showing the true depth of his emotions so that they could not be exploited.
“Since New York.” Steve admitted, his cheeks flushing, he gave a wry smile to Tony’s shocked look, “Right after you flew the nuke into the wormhole, it suddenly hit me that I had lost the most interesting person I’d met in this century, someone who made me want to kiss him as well as punch him, someone who turned all my assumptions about him completely upside down, who confused and beguiled me more than anyone ever had.”
It was a thoroughly miserable time for Zach, especially when the rash truly started to come out and covered his body in itchy lumps that he desperately wanted to scratch but wasn’t allowed to.
Peter struggled with the restraints, but they were re-enforced and his body was still weak from blood loss, he could make the metal groan but not make it move.
Zach punched at the chest plate and kicked his legs screaming angrily for Jarvis to take him back to Tony.
Steve would have pressed him but he had other reasons for being at the tower than to badger Tony about taking care of himself and so let it go for the moment.
“You’ll turn into a blueberry pancake.” Tony said, popping him back onto the stool, “And have you said thank you to Steve for cooking for you?”
Tony had a suit for Steve made up in three days. A dark navy blue Kevlar suit, light weight but exceptionally durable, still having the star at the centre of his chest and carrying the characteristics of the original uniform without being as garish.
“In case you’re forgetting, Dear. I own this entire building and the land it is standing on. Not to mention all the equipment you use, and pay for up keep and cost of groceries for this place. So when it comes to deciding whom has the right to be in the building, I am the only one who truly has the legal right to do so!” He did not raise his voice. Did not shout at the insufferable brat. But his voice, and his words carried all the weight and power of a thunderous roar.
When they reached City Hall, Tony moved so he was next to the limo door and gave everyone a reassuring smile which he stretched into a full, white teeth grin as the door opened and he stepped out; being greeted by the scream of fans and the flashing of cameras.
Shifting himself from the bed and into the wheelchair was a milestone that Tony had not thought he would be celebrating, for many it would not seem like a big achievement but having been bed bound for weeks and unable to do anything for himself, managing to do this was a huge step towards getting his independence back.
Wanda wouldn’t have it, she shook her head violently, a mask of hatred twisting her features, “That doesn’t mean he’s innocent.”
Reluctantly Rhodey turned away from the suit to face Tony, “Are you serious about this? Because you know what’s going to happen. There is no way I can keep the Military off this thing if you give it to me.”
Peter had been taken to the nearest hospital capable to cope with his condition. With his airways closed, body temperature sky rocketing, and his body going into shock he was immediately taken from the Accident and Emergency department and transferred to ICU. One of the teachers who had been accompanying the children on the Oscorp visit travelled with Peter to the hospital and met with Steve and Tony as they arrived at reception.
“Good.” Steve said glancing to Tony who was laughing at Peter’s disappointed expression and Zach’s happy grin, “He’s still getting nightmares.” He said lowly, “I won’t talk about them but they are haunting him as if whatever he went through in that lab. I want it stopped as soon as possible and I want the Maximoff’s found.”
“Well they have to consider if it is practical for them to become more than friends, if it will impact on their lives negatively.” Zach’s frown showed he wasn’t understanding, Bruce sighed and decided to try and make it as simple as possible.
“How about you do us both a favour and say nothing?” Pepper suggested, and rolled her eyes as Tony leant forward, burying his face in her neck as he cuddled her, making meeping noises into her neck. “Oh get off me you over grown toddler!”
“We could do it, or, you could, after we gather more evidence and get you something to wear.” Ned said, “You’ll need a mask at least so no one knows your identity.”
“I’m sorry little master but I can’t do that.” Jarvis said, “Just calm down and you’ll be home soon.”
This got a few laughs from the reporters, “And Zach has already challenged me to a race once I’m good in the chair, he plans on wear roller skates so we’ll be terrorizing the halls of Stark Tower soon.”
Steve felt his heart stop as he watched Tony’s Malibu mansion plunge into the ocean after the missiles had hit.
“No, he and Flash are in different classes to me now and they aren’t allowed to approach me at breaks either.” Peter said.
If his heats were regular as they were meant to be then he could book a few days off work every three or four months and either go through it on his own or have a trusted partner go through it with him; but, with his heats being as unpredictable as they were he was never given more than a two day warning of the approaching heat.
“Fine!” Tony said getting out of the car, “But just know this Rogers, if I am gutted by a guy with hook for a hand then I blame you entirely.”
Their Steve, or Bucky’s Steve wasn’t happy about it, or so the follow up reports seemed to suggest. James wasn’t certain what to make of it, Winter couldn’t give a damn and was very vocal about that!
There was no one for Steve to turn to, no one he could ask for help, and these two little boys, Tony’s boys, they were relying on him to be the adult now, to know what to do and how to get through this.
“Dear God it tastes like metal and cocoanut!” Tony declared as he inserted it into the rector core. Over the next few hours he started to feel a bit better as the palladium levels dropped slightly, although it would take weeks for it to completely clear from his system. He was even thinking about calling Rhodey to celebrate, which was when everything decided to turn to shit again.
In the lab he handed Steve the written report from his Omegaologist and sat down on a stool letting Steve read through the pages. As he did so he bit the inside of his lips and clenched his teeth focusing on not giving in to the burn in his eyes. He was not going to cry. He was not that weak. He was Iron Man and he would not cry.
Tony flushed, he was flirting with Steve and Peter had noticed? Noticed enough to tell Zach about it?
“The LGBTQA community has been very vocal since the press conference,” Pepper said, “We are getting a lot of positive press as the result, and with the pride parade not too far away, there has been a suggestion that SI host an LGBTQA gala for the occasion.”
Steve looked up from his daughter, gazing into Reed’s tired eyes, “I don’t know if I can survive,” he said, “I’ve lost everything Reed! My Husband, my friends, my home, I’ll be all alone again, in a world I don’t belong in!”
He heard Steve call his name, felt a warm hand on his back, but he couldn’t speak, couldn’t think, all he could do was curl his hands into fists and let out an anguished scream.
Steve ruffled Peter’s hair for him and patted his shoulder, “Go on, get to your room, Or I’ll call your school and tell them that you need a refresher course in the sex-ed videos.”
“How dare you?” Steve bellowed back with all the force of an angered bull, “How dare you call yourself a hero, a patriot, when you condemn the freedom of the greatest emotion in the world.” Steve gestured around, “Love.”
Natasha surfaced gasping for air and promptly dove back under, Steve doing the same a few moments later.
When Steve called Sam and explained the situation, Sam was worryingly eager to join them, it seemed he was a bit (A lot) of a fan boy and working side by side with Captain America was a teenage boy wet dream come true!
Tony stared at Norman and then snorted, “Predictable as always, Osborn.” He said, “You couldn’t give a fuck about your Son, this is about your company, your fortune, and what you stand to loose when I take you to court.”
At once Rogers became aware of the fact that the music that had been playing in the background had come to a halt and that a lot, if not all, the guests at the gala were standing in the arches watching this argument, many of them with their phones out snapping pictures if not recording this on video.
The second was a blonde alpha. Rogers. There was something about him that was familiar to the Asset, something in the back of his mind that he just couldn’t quite grasp, like the fading remnants of a dream, he knew it was there but he just couldn’t recall it.
“Really, isn’t that the same….” The Woman’s eyes widened, “You are…oh my God, of course you are.” Realisation dawned on her as she recognised Steve. “I’m sorry Captain, I should have realised sooner.”
“To Osborn? He’ll be investigated by the police and go to prison for a very long time.” Steve said, choosing to ignore Tony’s vow that if he got to Osborn first then the police wouldn’t have time to arrest him.
Patience was not a Stark trait, Steve knew that, Tony didn’t like waiting for things, he was too keen to get things done. Fortunately he was skilled enough when it came to his work that he could do this efficiently, but when it came to people this impatience did affect his ability to associate with people.
“Hey, I’m a genius, nothing I do is stupid!” Tony protested, making Rhodey scoff and roll his eyes as he began to put distance between himself and the others, something that Wanda immediately noticed.
“You could,” The detective agreed, “That is your prerogative, but I think you will find your time and energy better spent elsewhere. Our bringing down Osborn would be beneficial to your case against him would it not?”
“I’m not a munchkin, you’re a baby Hobbit!” Peter shot back, “You’re even getting hairy feet like Mamma.”
“Congratulations about the honours. I hear Senator Stern is going to be the speaker and awarding you and Colonel Rhodes. Or is it Senator Ass Clown?”
“Yes, and as I said, I expect you to be the responsible one, because I am completely irresponsible.” Tony shot Steve a grin and set off to help Peter get what they needed to get the bike on the car.
“I know.” Steve said, he’d learned more about IVF and other fertility treatments during the past few years and didn’t blame Tony for not wanting to go through them. “If we can’t have a baby naturally then so be it, maybe we can look into adoption. Give another kid like Peter a home and a family.”
Once Peter had MJ’s scent he set about following it, finding the direction she had gone and ran after her. His eye sight was better than hers in the day and at night it was far better which put him at a greater advantage. MJ would have to stay to the paths to avoid tripping over obstacles she might otherwise not see, but Peter could use any path he chose, and could leap up over benches, take the trees and swing himself up and over the children’s climbing frames and swings.
Thor looked up with a frown, “People are surely not blaming us for these events.” He had been informed of all that had happened since he had left Earth so he was aware of what had happened to his friends and to Zach, something that disgusted him, because, as he said, “Only the most dishonourable of cowards attacks a child or attempts to use them as a pawn.”
Natasha didn’t even blink, just followed after Fury who was making his way into the living room where Zach was laying on the mat in front of the sofa.
Several minutes passed until Tony’s breathing was suitably under control and he was able to speak to Steve again.
Rogers had kept his answers to no comments as Sam and Natasha had ordered him, and as they were escorting him whenever he came into contact with the press, they made damn sure he didn’t say anything more than that.
Happy drove them in silence, reaching the airport in record time after running several red lights along the way and stopped the car without his usual smoothness.
"Hmm, maybe torture could soften such resolve?" Steve mused, pausing in his thrusts and concentrated on tormenting Tony's cock, "How long can you hold out against such wicked acts being used against you. Won't your resolve break when you are treated to torments?"
“Oh ho? Is that how it is?” Sam grinned, “Well I’ll let you and sleeping beauty enjoy your lay in while I pound the pavement. There is coffee in the kitchen and help yourself to anything you want, and I’ve put towels in the bathroom, plus a couple of pairs of clothes.”
“Because this documentary is supposed to be child friendly.” Clint explained, “Seeing your family jewels will be a little traumatizing for kids.”
“Tony?” Steve whispered not wanting him to startle him. His heart was pounding and his palms were sweating with fear for Tony’s life. One wrong move here and Tony would plummet to his death.
“I know.” Tony said squeezing Steve’s hand back, he took a deep breath and settled himself as Jarvis counted down until they were live.
“We do still need to talk.” Steve said, hissing as Tony’s hand slid under his shirt, “Have a discussion, set some rules about talking to each other more…” He bucked his hips as Tony’s hand undid his flies and fondled his growing erection.
Tony was dressed in cream suit, with just enough yellow in the shade to keep it from being white, which complimented up his tanned complexion, he wore a black silk shirt with a matching tie and pocket handkerchief. Rather than wearing a rolex, he was wearing his gauntlet bracelets on his wrists so he could call the suit to him if needs must, something he hoped would not happen but was prepared for anyway.
“It’s not like that.” Tony said, fighting back the urge to cry, stupid hormones. “I just…. You deserve to have a baby, I want to give you a baby and I can’t do that without help. I let you down on that, my stupid body let us down and I didn’t want to be even more of a disappointment, or less than a younger and healthier Omega.”
Shock was the first reaction from the Avengers team, upon seeing the alternate reality Steven Rogers, standing besides Tony, with baby Lily in her new pram, dressed in a new baby grow, and gazing around at the new building with large, curious eyes.
“Ha, I’m gonna boy out Stark Industries, and then I’ll make you get me tuna sandwiches!” Harley shot back. While several people gasped and the Avengers giggled enjoying the interaction with the sassy kid and Tony, the Billionaire himself shrugged.
“Hi sweetie.” Pepper greeted, “Let’s go and get some breakfast shall we?” She said with a bright smile, “Your Mamma, Daddy, and Peter aren’t here right now, I’ll explain why to you over pancakes, alright?”
His hands spanned Tony’s back, stroking every inch of him. He hissed as Tony’s sharp teeth bit into his throat as Tony’s second orgasm approached and Steve tensed, waiting for Tony to start to come before he began to thrust in earnest into the clenching heat of his lovers body, bringing himself to climax and laying them both back down onto the bed to let the afterglow flow over them.
“About building a team,” Steve replied, taking a seat on the battered couch Tony had in his workshop. “On my earth, The Avengers often worked with The Defenders, The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, The X-Men, to defeat large problems.”
“We’ll find our way together, small steps.” He whispered, “I’ve never courted anyone and I guess you’ve never been courted, so, we’ll figure it out as we go.”
“Can I have a sister like Emma, she’s real pretty and I like her. Can you and Daddy Steve make me a sister?”
Because you look like death warmed up! Was on the tip of Steve’s tongue but he managed to keep from saying it and chose a more tactful approach, “You’ve lost a lot of weight,” Okay, maybe not that tactful.
Tony tried to hold back the flow, but the grief was too great and tears began to spill down his cheeks, “It’s not fair!” He snarled into Steve’s chest, fisting the soldier’s shirt, “One thing, just one damn thing, can’t the universe at least give us that?”
Too weak and in too much pain to get off the bed Tony was forced to nod, accepting that he would have to let Vision go and find his daughter.
“Him and me both.” Tony replied, grabbing the menu to look at the desserts on it, “Fuck it, I’m gonna order all the desserts they have, we can share them and get diabetes and tooth cavities together!” He all but bounced the phone and picked it up, “Everyone else choose what you want and I’ll order it up.”
Natasha shrugged, “There were many years between the time you knew Howard Stark and the birth of Tony, almost thirty years in fact, and people change and not always for the better.”
Tony often likened him to an octopus having an epileptic fit when he slept, but really, that was unfair since Tony was a shameless space hog and would sprawl over the whole regardless of anyone he might be sharing with, limbs spread wide and taking up far more space than someone as small as him should be able to.
"It's not your fault." Steve said or at least began to say when Tony sucked in a huge breath and glared.
“You got a bolt hole we can go to?” Tony asked moving away from the exhibit, Natasha and Steve following him, he kept his broken arm stuffed into the pocket of his hoodie to hide the spoons that were acting as splints.
Tony sighed and leaned back against the sink. “We don’t know this Bucky, none of us. The only one that did know him is AWOL and wanted for criminal offences. Plus, I don’t think he’d be much of a help for Bucky, he would insist on finding a way to make Bucky “How is was” rather than accepting him as he is and just helping him find peace within himself and a place to call home.”
Steve could understand the argument, he could see Tony’s point, and they did need to focus on the boys especially with all that was happening, but he couldn’t help but feel the loss, he’d let himself grow excited at the prospect of a baby but now that wouldn’t happen, maybe not ever.
“And now we’ve had our eyes melted by the sight of neon pink Thor, back to you, Munchkin, what are you trying to bribe me for?” Tony asked Peter. The pre-teen rolled his eyes,
Poor child, orphaned. Being raised by a false hero and a spoilt brat. Neither were suitable parents in Steve’s opinion. Lucy or whatever her name was should have been taken into care.
The two shared a lingering kiss and looked back down at their daughters, tomorrow the team would arrive for the annual celebration on defeating Thanos, but for this evening it was just them and their family, enjoying the sunset and superhero games.
“Well his Mom still lives in town. She goes to the bar most days, she’s been pretty messed up ever since.”
“Why?” Steve sounded so perplexed that Tony had no choice but to answer him, hardly noticing that they changed into another dance, this one full of spins and turns.
“Now, we have to go to the Police.” Matt said, “I can put together a case for Barnes, the fact that he wasn’t in his right mind when this occurred. He has a legitimate chance of getting off on  the grounds of diminished responsibility.”
“Is Tony, is a threat, but you are burying you head in the sand to that, chasing make believe monsters and getting so obsessed over it that you do stupid things that get people hurt. It was behaviour like this that led to you creating Ultron and ruined Iron Man.” He paused and frowned at Tony, as if coming to a new realization, “Is that why you’re building yourself a new team? Because the Avengers know your not fit to be in the field anymore?”
Yet, even though he knew this, Steve couldn’t help but imagine what it might be like to Alpha to such an amazing Omega, to be Father to two adorable (If occasionally terrifying) Boys. How wonderful it would be to wake up in bed with Tony every day, maybe even be woken up by Zach jumping on the bed, like on his birthday or Christmas day. He could imagine the Pup scurrying into the bedroom, bounding up onto the bed, his cheeks flush with excitement and hair a tangle of wild curls, demanding that his parents got up because it was Christmas day or his Birthday, or simply because it was morning and he wanted their attention.
Tony wanted to say yes, he really did, but the truth was he didn’t know how to do that, and admitted as much to Steve.
Steve ejaculate three times before he knotted Tony and the Omega finally came, tears shimmering on his cheeks and sparkling in his eyes, his face flushed and body quivering as the first wave of heat passed. The two traded a few kisses and lay quietly in each-others arms waiting for Steve’s knot to deflate so he could move and eat while Tony slept until the next bout arrived.
Tony grinned without opening his eyes. He knew it! Those Captain America shorts had pushed Steve’s buttons.
They however didn’t stay in them longer than stowing their stuff, they went up to the common room which Pete had been granted full use of for the duration of his slumber party. The rest of the family would on their own floors, or in Tony’s case in the lab, and Zach either with him or Steve or in his room.
“Uh huh.” Tony agreed, making his way towards the fire escape door he’d cut through to gain access to this room, “Anything you want honey, although you and Pete will never leave the lab again.”
“Neptune, huh?” Tony said, “You better wrap up warm them, it’ll be chilly there. But first off a shower and getting dressed.” He took Zach from Rhodey and glanced at Pepper, “Gimme half an hour?”
Silently Natasha agreed with him while she came to terms with the fact that Tony now thought of her as family and had gone out of his way to secure her future. It made her even more determined to protect him and his family from those who’d rip them apart, and if necessary then escape route or not, she would kill anyone and everyone who came for them.
The three of them sat in silence until Zach’s tears had subsided, to Steve’s distress it was because Zach had thoroughly exhausted himself crying and had finally fallen asleep. He felt like a complete failure as a parent, having not been able to stop Zach’s tears or do anything other than to hold him while he cried himself out.
“You are the peak of physical perfection, strong, healthy, handsome, virial. Where I’m reliant on this.” He tapped the reactor in his chest, “Am covered in scars, I have stretch marks, extra weight on my hips and lower belly. I don’t sleep for days because I get lost in work, and I get nightmares, and I freak out, I’m sarcastic, short tempered, and have no idea what a healthy romantic relationship is because I’ve never had one.”
“In other circumstances and if I were ten years younger, then I would jump at the chance to be with you.” Tony said, trying to let Steve down as gently as he could, “You need someone your own age, someone unspoiled and without all of my issues.”
“Please.” Steve said, he gave Tony an expectant look which Tony pretended to not understand, “Tony….”
“Nah boss, just the sci-fi movies you refuse to have on because they are, and I quote, “An incompetent’s ass-backwards fantasy about how science really works and a complete waste of graphics and digital tech and should be burned at the stake rather than inflicted on the general populous”
The last thing that Steve and Tony expected was to get a phone call from Peter’s school asking them to come and collect Peter who was being suspended for a week for fighting and they would be called in to discuss further measures after they had spoken to Harry Osborn’s parents.
This took both Tony and Steve by surprise, they had not expected Peter to ask about or even think about Harry Osborn, they weren’t friends, hadn’t even been friendly to each-other. The fact that Peter was showing concern for him just went to show how good of a kid he was.
“All shall be well.” Steve declared in his deepest most impressive Captain America voice, “I shall attempt to free us.” He gripped Tony’s hips and pulled back, sliding in and out of Tony, “This is harder than it seems!” He snorted setting Tony off again, “I keep sinking back in, perhaps I need something to grab onto.” He reached under Tony and fisted his cock, “Ah, now I have a solid hand hold.” He declared, giggling as Tony laughed helplessly beneath him, the shudders of their laughter tormenting them both as their nerve endings were stimulated.
Thor gripped Mjolnir tightly in his hand clearly fearing what this would mean for his friend’s life and future as an avenger.
“Why would they keep him sedated?” Rhodey asked, “That doesn’t make any sense if they wanted to use him for his skills.”
It wasn’t fair. Stane was long dead, he shouldn’t still be able to have power over Tony or Zach; yet his spirit seemed to have a long reach and could still hurt them even from beyond the grave.
They did help out the old lady next door, who had to be a hundred and twenty if she was a day. She was an old dear, still insisted on living in her own home and caring for herself despite what her kids and grandkids said, fretting over her being alone.
He didn’t like this alternate version of himself, this false Captain America, who acted as if he were better than Rogers. When he was nothing but a queer!
Steve shook his head and shrugged helplessly, “Yeah,” Tony sighed patting him on the shoulder with his good hand, “We should find a way to contact Fury, give him the heads up, if the Winter Soldier is on the loose then Hydra has to be on to us.”
Steve was shaking, trying to keep from breaking down with the weight of all this new information, “Where is he? Did he come home? Why doesn’t Shield know about him?” He looked to Tony for the answers which Tony wished he could give, but he just didn’t know.
“Purchase all the land around there.” He instructed, “All the way to within a mile radius of civilians. Then lets look into make it all defensible, shielding in the ground to rise up twenty, no make that thirty feet and lets look into creating some kind of roof. Once we get the fuckers in there lets keep ‘em there. No one in and no one out until Thanos is a rotting corpse on the ground, even if I have to ram a nuke up his ass sideways and use Deadpool’s body as a hammer to beat it in there!”
“Now, we go back to work.” Obie replied lighting up a cigar, “We’ve a company to run. While you can’t officially take over as CEO until you’re Twenty-One, you can get started in R&D and I want you to. You’re ten times the engineer and scientist Howard was and I want to put that genius of yours to use.” He took a long pull of his cigar and went to his suitcase, taking out a small packet of pills which he tossed to Tony. “After heat pills. They’ll get rid of anything that might have been conceived, you’re too young for pups and I don’t want them.”
As he finished his ice cream and made sure he couldn’t scrape anymore out of it, Clint stretched out on his towel. “So, what are we doing tomorrow, the same as today?”
“Of course.” Tony said, “And remember, if it does become too stressful for you, we won’t think any less of you for walking away. There is no point in making yourself suffer, you won’t be able to learn if you are stressed out and anxious, and I would rather teach you myself than have you becoming sick with worry.”
Zach glared at her, “Don’t call me little one.” He snarled at her, “My name is Zach Stark and I want my Mamma, I want my Daddy, I want my Peter, I want them NOW!”
I’m afraid I can’t tell you everything, it would risk doing too much damage to the timeline and I’m risking enough by giving you this. But what I will say is this, don’t shut Tony out, don’t distance yourself or think that lying to him is going to spare him anything. I know that won’t mean anything to you right now, but in time it will make sense.
“These might be terrible for a diet but they are so good.” Clint declared with melting chocolate and marshmallow dripping down his fingers.
Tony called ahead to the compound, to let the team know he was heading there, and that there was something important they had to talk about, but he didn’t tell the team about Steve and Lily until they had arrived.
“No.” Tony looked down, tears running down his face, unable to bear the hatred of his children, their accusing glares, their anger at his failure. “I tried…” He whispered,
“We don’t have a choice.” Natasha coldly said. “We have to think of ourselves. Steve was right. We will be charged with obstruction of justice, failure to report a crime, and quite possibly aiding and abetting. We could get twenty years for this!”
Narrowing his eyes, Steve did so and saw what Tony meant. Sceptre Steve, while mostly identical to him did have some differences. He was older, the frown lines, expression lines, and smile lines were all deeper, there was even a few strands of grey in his hair where Steve had none.
If Tony had to restrict Zach from being in the Lab, which he may well have to as there were too many chemicals and tools that could do serious harm to a curious pup, then he was going to need someone to watch him while he was working, and unless he hired a Nanny to keep an eye on Zach, then Kindergarten was the only alternative.
“Fiend, thou shalt not prevail this day!” Thor bellowed flying towards Doom knocking bots out of the way so he could strike at Doom. The Dictator flew back blasting energy beams at him, Thor roared gleefully casting off the blows with Mjolnir, taking out Bots and advancing on Doom. He brought Mjolnir down upon the dictator as Doom fired at him, the energy bounced off Mjolnir in a high arch shooting out across the sky and hitting the Arc reactor powering the Iron Man armour.
“What does that mean?” Clint roared into the creatures face he took its other arm and twisted the elbow, threatening to break it.
The Avengers had not been able to get to London in time to do anything but help with the clean up after Thor, Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster, and Dr Selvig had defeated the Elves.
“How about I ground the both of you if you don’t get your butts to your rooms and start unpacking.” Tony threatened.
Sniffing hard he picked up plenty of scents on the air, food, perfume, car exhaustions, alcohol, drugs, animals, and the familiar scent of MJ.
“They’ll find him little one.” Thor assured him. Besides him Sam kept a firm hold of Peter who was ashen and rigid, looking ready to bolt into the water to try and find Tony as well.
“Rhodey, who else?” Tony called back, “And Pepper is maid of honour so don’t think you can wheedle yourself into that role.”
Tony looked at him and then at his puppy eyed boys. He sighed and rolled his eyes, “Alright, one hour, then I want you back up here.” He was then smothered in hugs and kisses by Peter and Zach who eagerly scampered off to join Sam and Natasha on the way down the path to the sea.
“I am not certain, agent Romanoff.” Jarvis replied, “It may well have been, it could also have been among other illegally sold munitions that unscrupulous military persons sell on the black market to arms dealers. It may have even been a counterfeit, without a serial number to check there is no way of verifying.”
“Clint can be the talking bird, because there are always talking birds in these kind of stories. Natasha can be the dragon, and Bruce can be the wise old man/wizard who gives you a sword or password, whatever, Thor can be the King/Father/aged knight who bids you go on this quest, Sam can be your Valet/Groom, and Peter and Zach can be the talking rabbits and Squirrel, oh and Dumm-E can be your trust steed.”
Likewise Steve found himself sleeping easier, his nightmares growing fewer and not lasting as long or being as intense. He also found himself opening up to Tony more and more on the nights that the two of them couldn’t sleep.
“I can sit on your lap.” Zach said suddenly making everyone look to him, “When your in a wheelchair, I can ride on your lap, or when you get good with it, I can wear roller skates and we can have races!”
Sam had gotten him a gift box filled to the brim with chocolate and candy, which had Tony groaning since it meant Zach would be sugar hyped before very long.
“But if I had lived a better life, not drowned myself in alcohol and drugs I’d have spotted Stane’s treachery sooner and never ended up needing the arc reactor or getting palladium poisoning.”
“It’s be cool if you did.” One of Lydia’s friends said coming to join them, “Having an Avenger at the party would be seriously cool.”
“It’s a bit more complicated than that Zach. Your Mamma and Steve do like each-other but they are being careful about becoming more than friends, there are lots of things to consider when getting into a relationship.”
Matt’s smile was acidic, “Delightful offer, but I am afraid I’ll have to decline.” He turned and watched as Steve carried Tony into the bedroom, shutting the door behind him.
Tony panted, it was getting hard to breath with all the smoke in the air and his eyes were stinging and watering. He looked down at the ground below the smoking and burning debris and felt the catwalk shifting beneath him, it wasn’t going to stay stable for much longer not with Killian burning it.
“Indeed, which is why you spent twenty minutes arguing with Dumm-E over which type of apple made the best substitute for a tennis ball to throw across the room by pointing out which type was the most spherical and would provide the more velocity.”
Tony rolled his lips trying to look convinced of this but he clearly wouldn’t be until Peter was awake and talking.
“We’ll need to anyway.” Steve said, “The hellicarriers will have to be taken off line.” He looked at Tony, “I assume you can do that?”
“At least Stogers isn’t your portmanteau.” Clint offered as he scrolled on a tablet, “That just sounded wrong.” He gave a suggestive leer and shoved a handful of cheeseballs into his mouth.
For a moment time seemed to freeze as the four men gazed at each other, no one quite sure what to do or wanting to make a move that might spook Bucky. After what seemed like an eternity it was Lily that broke the silence with a demanding cry and kicked her legs in Tony’s arms,
Tony had a very simple greenstick fracture to his arm and a mild concussion, the Doctors wanted to keep him in at the Hospital, but Tony refused, signing himself out as soon as the plaster had encased his arm so he could go back to the Tower with Steve.
“Is he alright, Zach’s not worse is he?” Could chicken pox get worse? Steve didn’t think they could, but he supposed that might have changed in seventy years.
As Tony and Thor’s repulsors and lightning struck at the outer walls of the castle an alarm went off and the troops inside began to pour out, some on bikes, some on foot, and some in military jeeps.
While Brail had been avail in printed page during his time, there hadn’t been computers designed for the blind, well, there hadn’t really been computers and Hydra certainly didn’t bother making their tech easy to use for those whose vision might be impaired.
Married to Steve, Steve being their new Daddy? Dear God, Tony really had to work harder on keeping his crush from being discovered, what the hell would he do if Steve ever found out?
“I thought it was.” Steve said, slowly lifting his head, “I thought we were okay, that were trusted each-other, didn’t hide things, especially important things.” To Tony’s horror he lay the box of syringe’s on the coffee table.
Tony mind ran with a thousand questions, where was he, what the hell was going on, what had happened to him, what was this?
“Mamma.” Morgan babbled beaming at Tony gummily. She turned her head as the sound of the Quinjet landing reached them and Rhodey came in, walking thanks to the braces Tony had made him.
All the medical staff took hold of the patient and carefully lifted him so she could look at his back, “No exit wound, the bullet is still in there.”
The story Tony had told of the bomb being a Vietnam era bomb had been proven true, the media had looked into it and confirmed it, to the point where no one could deny the claim factual, no one but Wanda who was still adamant that it was Tony who was responsible.
“Pete says your dorks!” Zach hummed snuggling into his pillow, “I like Steve, he’ll be a good Daddy.”
“What?” Steve couldn’t stop himself from yelling, he was so shocked by Tony saying such a thing, an untrue thing.
November went past, and December drew in, bringing with it icy weather and several feet of snow that thrilled Zach. As soon as he woke up to find the world had turned white outside, he was desperate to go out and start to build snow men and go sledding, and have snow ball fights.
By the time Sam arrived back at the house, panting, sweating, and clutching not only a bag of bagels plus toppings, he also had a couple of burner phones with him which he set on the table before going to shower.
“Uh-Huh!” Zach sped across the floor and jumped up at Peter his arms wrapping about Peter’s legs as he tried to reach for the menu, shrieking and protesting when Peter kept it out of his reach.
Rogers’ might not have mentioned Ultron by name, but it was clear that was what he meant, and it was enough to make Tony flinch and duck his head in shame.
“Watch it, you nearly took my eye out! Damnit woman I’ve already lost limbs here, I can’t afford to lose an eye too!”
That was what the Captain had said, and he’d looked so earnest about it, so desperate for the asset to remember him. But that was absurd, the asset didn’t have friends, people had friends and he wasn’t a person, he was just a tool, Hydras tool.
“Mamma and Daddy say I have to respect my power and not treat it as a toy.” He said solemnly to the children, they nodded their heads having heard similar sentiments repeated themselves.
Now SI can probably offer employment to admin staff and such, but not even I could fund an entire intelligence agency and it is very doubtful that our Government or any Government would want to fund them.”
Peter looked to Steve for an explanation. The Captain sighed running a hand over his face, “Zach heard something that your Mamma would rather he hadn’t. About his Father.”
Tony snorted, “Please, like your skinny little ass could possibly compete with my perfect pair of peaches!”
Peter fell backwards down onto the ground and gripped at his leg with both hands, to his utter mortification he realized that he’d voided his bladder, the pain and shock had been so bad he’d wet himself. Tears began to run freely down his cheeks beneath his mask as he tried to stop the blood that was gushing out of his thigh. He’d been shot, the bullet having torn right through his thigh and broken the femur, nicking the femoral artery as it passed through his limb.
“That’s right baby, Daddies home.” Tony said slipping an arm around Steve’s waist and leaning against his side and Steve wrapped an arm about his shoulders and kissed his temple, “We’re together again and nothing is going to tear us apart again.”
“Well, considering the state your in I think grounding you is redundant right now.” Tony said, “However things are going to change. We can’t keep your enhancement a secret now, everyone will know about you.”
“I want to be with you too baby.” Steve said walking back to bed and sitting down besides Tony, “I want to have sex with you and I want you to enjoy it, and I hope that you can enjoy every moment of it,” He laced his fingers through Tony’s “We’re just going to have to find new ways of going about it.”
From besides him Steve snorted into his hands and Tony shot him a glare, which he then levelled at Jarvis’ nearest camera, “Don’t think this won’t come back to bite you the next time you need an upgrade.”
“No, I absailed sixty floors, I’m going to have to climb sixty floors to get back into my room.” Peter said really not looking forward to doing that.
On and on he fought until finally he managed to defeat the Bots in his vicinity and ran to Tony. He fell to his knees besides him, carefully reaching out to take the dented face plate off so he could see Tony’s face.
He made his way through guided by Jarvis, passing through a hidden doorway and into what had to be the main vault where a downed leviathan lay in ruins along with the sceptre.
“Don’t even try it, Rogers. I saw the fucking tape of the Winter Soldier murdering the Starks. I saw all of it. You are a heartless and spineless bastard for keeping the truth from him.” He glanced at Natasha, his top lip curling back in disgust.
“Woman, you are a danger to those of us with heart conditions.” Tony complained, Natasha smirked at him. She looked alright except for some bruising at her temple and a cut across her eyebrow. She glanced at the security cameras and ducked her head,
“And so are you.” Tony said, “Most people who’ve been through what you have would be gibbering idiots in a corner. You’ve made the effort to adapt and learned to live in this century. You have nothing to reproach yourself for, so please don’t do that to yourself.”
His breath caught as Tony came into the lounge, he was dressed in black jeans with a red silk shirt that Pepper had picked out for him, and a fitted leather jacket. His beard and hair were trimmed, his skin was scented from the shower gel he’d used and he looked as nervous as Steve felt.
In the bags there were tinned and packet food like tuna, baked beans, hot dogs, bread, crisps, biscuits, and of course there was marshmallows, and chocolate to make s’mores.
“Dr Banner now might be time for your larger self.” Thor said as they ran to the burning remains of the base.
“I never knew my Mother or Father.” Peter replied, “They died when I was just a baby, I don’t remember them. But my Aunt May and Uncle Ben told me about them and they sounded like nice people.”
He didn’t like lying to Tony, but this wasn’t lying, he just wasn’t going to tell him until it was over with and as the interview would be having a live stream on the programmes web feed, Tony wouldn’t be able to stop it before it got released either.
“But showing extra caution would not go amiss.” Thor said, his usual joviality gone. “Whatever help I can provide, I shall.”
Moving was difficult, he wasn’t accustomed to carrying so much weight in his front and his arms and legs seemed wasted, as if he’d been bed bound for months. But he couldn’t have been, could he? Or maybe he’d been ill, fallen into a coma or something and only just awoken? But if that were the case then where were the Doctors and nurses? If he was in a coma then he’d be in an Intensive care ward, there would be doctors and nurses everywhere to monitor him and other coma patients.
“Oh,” Steve stretched and placed his arms behind his head so he was a little more propped up as he looked down at Tony, “I don’t really care either way.” He replied, “A little boy like Zach and Peter would be nice, but a little girl would be super cute too, especially if she has your eyes and dimples.”
Maybe they would be welcoming grandchildren into the world, Peter and Zach having children of their own, Christ, now that was a terrifying thought.
Zach was all big eyes and curious babbling as he looked about at all the new faces, even Natalie Rushman who’d just become Pepper’s P.A, for some reason Tony couldn’t put his finger on, he didn’t feel comfortable letting Natalie around Zach, something about her just made him uneasy. It wasn’t that she was openly flirting with him, plenty of female Alpha’s had done that in the past, it wasn’t that she’d kicked Happy’s ass in the boxing ring after he and Happy had stopped sparring, that had been amusing and impressive. There was just something about her he found unnerving and until he trusted her she wasn’t getting baby sitting privileges.
"And we won't." Steve said firmly, "Peter is strong and he will get through this." While he was not showing it as clearly as Tony was, he was just as frightened as the Omega, he was simply trying to stay strong for Tony, trying to be the support that Tony needed him to be right now. But inside he was a wreck, was terrified they would lose Peter and if that happened he had no idea what they would do. He loved that kid like he was his own Son and the thought of losing him was enough to make him feel physically sick.
“You puke on my furniture you are scrubbing every inch of this tower with a toothbrush.” Tony said and batted Espresso away from his bacon which the cat was trying to steal from his plate. “Hey cat-burglar, go steal from bird-brain, leave my normal person size portions alone.”
“It’d probably be a good idea.” Tony said. Nodding Steve got up from the table and dialled Natasha’s mobile number, the phone that Tony had given her and all the avengers, not her Shield issued phone.
“The Doctor is with Amy and Rory, and River and they are in 1969 trying to find a little girl who keeps calling the President, and there’s these creepy, big headed aliens.” Zach explained.
The pure terror of what that would mean would have Tony running to Zach and Peter’s rooms, desperate to check on them and be sure that they were safe. Only after he’d kissed their cheeks, stroked their hair, listened to them breathe for several minutes could he find it in himself to leave them to sleep.
More than a year had shot by since the Avengers first holiday together. First but by no means the last. When Peter's thirteenth birthday had come in August Tony had arrange week's trip to Disney World, bringing along Clint's family and the Keeners for the trip, which resulted in mouse ears being worn, selfies with Disney Princesses, rides on stomach churning rollercostars and half of the gift shops being purchased for memorabilia.
The ultra-lean and ultra-toned might be seen as the ultimate form of physical beauty in the twenty-first century, but Steve came from a time when being chunky was considered attractive, when curves were far more desired than bones. There had been far too many starving waifs during the late twenties and early thirties thanks to the depression, no one found the sight of a protruding rib cage, or pelvis attractive back then, because pretty much everyone was on the verge of having such a physique because they couldn’t afford to eat.
“Someone always gets upset, but as for the vast majority, I think they’ll be happy.” Tony replied, “And we’ll work on helping you get acclimated, a crash course in social development since the forties, Jarvis? Can you work out some material and a program for Steve to follow?”
Tony ran his hands through his hair, “Isn’t it?” He asked sagging back against the wall, “I chose to become Iron Man, to keep being Iron Man, I chose to live in the public eye when I became a Mother, I chose to challenge terrorists and make myself a target for them, and in so doing made Peter and Zach targets.”
“If we can take the readings while you are in REM sleep both in normal REM sleep and when you suffer one of these nightmares, then we can get a more accurate reading and be able to determine if they are natural or supernatural.” Bruce said,
Steve snorted sadly easily able to imagine Clint engaging in an egg war with his two children, “Sam is with them.” He offered but this did little to pacify Tony,
“Something like that. Kid tried to shoot me with a potato gun. He’s some kind of super genius, kind of cute too. I think he’d get on well with Peter and Zach. Are they okay, can you put them on the phone, I need to apologise to them.” Steve’s breath caught in his throat as Tony went on, “I was stupid I know, I should have known better. I’ll try and make this up to all of you I promise, nothing like this will ever happen again. Look Jarvis is out of commission at the moment, I’m going to try and get him and the suit fixed up, before he shut down Jarvis said something about information on the Mandarin being in this area, I need to check this lead out before I can come home. I’ve got to take this asshole out Steve, he has to be stopped. I’m sorry I’ve gotten you guys involved in this shit but I can’t let this go, not now.”
Steve found himself enchanted by the playful machines, laughing as they chased after the tennis balls he threw for them, the mess Butterfingers made with a smoothie and tried to feed to Tony, soaking the Geniuses shirt in green gunk.
Once the stylist was finished Pepper gave him another once over and hustled him out to the car where Happy was waiting and got in herself.
Natasha had unfortunately been taking a mouthful of coffee and ended up choking at Zach's choice of words. Tony had a bout of gastric flu in the Autumn which had resulted in him practically living in the bathroom for a few days. Peter had unfortunately described the situation to Zach and it had resulted in Zach believing that Tony had lost completed control of his bowel and stomach.
Tony gave Pete a little more leeway in schooling, he’d wanted Pete to go to the same school as his friends so his life wouldn’t be any more disrupted than it had been by his Uncle and Aunt’s deaths. Plus, Happy had given Pete some basic self defence lessons, and Pete carried with him a custom made alarm that not only screeched 130 decibels, it also sent an emergency alert to Jarvis with a GPS, so Tony could act in seconds if anything ever happened to him.
“No, you just upgrade appliances and give them questionable personalities,” Clint agreed, “How is Toby the toaster, Cathy the coffee maker, and Micky the Microwave?”
“You have to go home sweetie.” Steve said bending down so he was on eye level with Zach, “You need to go back to school, you can’t miss anymore or your Mamma and me will get into trouble.”
The happy, friendly boys that Steve knew could and probably would be destroyed by an unfair system and courts.
“Christ, Jay, unless the tower is on fire, I don’t care.” Tony yelled, closing his eyes and fisting Steve’s hair.
He’d become so happy in Bucharest, so settled that he’d actually thought he was making himself a home, but now it was all falling apart. He’d been walking home from work when he’d spotted her.
“No, Wanda, he doesn’t.” Wanda screeched and launched herself at Vision, lashing out with her magic, which passed through him ineffectually as he fazed, moving closer to her until he was right over her, at which point he became solid again and pressed the mind stone against her head draining the magic out of her.
“Yes we can.” Steve agreed, sitting forward so he could kiss Tony’s lips, “So long as we communicate and work together.”
“Fine by me.” Tony agreed, he glanced at Natasha, “If you promise to keep your claws to yourself you can come too.”
Once they’d gone Steve sat down on the side of the bed and took Tony’s hands, “It will be okay.” He said seriously, “And I am not going anywhere, nothing you say will make me change my mind.”
“Go back to bed Harry.” Osborn ordered him, “Marcus, stay here, keep an eye on him.” He ordered his head of security, a hulking lump of a man with a scar over his right eye and a missing front tooth.
“Well I didn’t know what everyone wanted to I did something for everyone.” Clint said shrugging his shoulders, he winked at Zach and Peter, “There’s some chocolate fudge brownies in the oven too, we can have them warm with ice cream and Nutella.”
She had taken it upon herself to spoil them since, giving them baked goodies to “Feed them up” as apparently they were too skinny and needed looking after.
“I’m really not.” Steve chuckled, “No one is. We all have flaws. But when we love someone we love them so much that we overlook the flaws and maybe love them because of their flaws, as they make us feel more secure with our own.”
Well at least some of the attention was positive if embarrassing, he supposed, he’d rather have people calling him cute than a freak. Although when one person went into graphic detail about what they wanted to do with him in one of his webs, Peter beat a hasty retreat to class. There were some things he just wasn’t ready to hear.
The meeting ended with Zach running back in with a new picture, this one of a grey lump with what looked to be bunny ears on the shoulders that he declared to be War Machine.
Steve wasn’t going to argue with that, his son and his fiancé were in there, somewhere beneath that rubble, he wasn’t going to wait for back up to get in there.
To his horror the Doctor ignored him, taking his daughter and placing her into a travel cot which the eye patch man picked up by the handle not even bothering to glance at the baby, “Bring Stark as soon as you have finished with his post delivery.”
Grabbing Tony about the waist, Steve kicked for the surface as hard as he could and gasped for air as he got his head above water, hauling Tony up and balancing him against his chest so he could swim for the cliff face. Around him he heard Clint and Natasha’s sighs of relief, could hear Zach and Peter crying, Thor trying to comfort them, while Bruce and Sam called out to Steve, making ready to take Tony from him and get him up onto the rocks.
A baby, he and Tony were having a baby and he’d abandoned them both, practically gift wrapped them for Hydra.
Tony had already put out snacks for them, knowing that Peter would be starving after school, and had drinks waiting for the kids as they all piled in. He and Steve were going to stay while Peter explained what had happened to him and that he was enhanced.
The others had been watching this interaction with morbid fascination up until this point and since Bucky looked like he was either going to beat Wade to death or have a nervous breakdown, they decided to intervene before things could become anymore inappropriate.
“He might die!” Maria shouted, “Look at him, look at what you have done!” Maria held out Tony to Howard to show him the twisting shaking body with blood smearing his flesh, “We have to take him to a Doctor or I swear to God Howard Stark, I will see you spending the rest of your life in prison for this.”
“Wish I was like that.” Tony sighed, Steve reached across the table and held his hand giving a smile,
Steve could see the situation was deteriorating rapidly and tried to keep a full scale argument from breaking out, asking the Director why he’d brought them there.
“Doesn’t look like there will be much resistance against us.” Natasha commented eyeing several fleeing guards.
As they left Fury sank back into his chair, “You are not telling the WSC about this.” He said to Hill, “I know you don’t like the Avengers, but I like the WSC’s decision to nuke New York even less, and I trust that asshole Rumlow about as far as I could throw him.”
Natasha bit her lip and looked at Bruce; the Doctor shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. "Peter is very sick at the moment and your parents think it's best that you don't see him like this."
With the suit down, Jarvis out of commission, and his mobile completely trashed thanks to it being bathed in the ocean, Tony was in the middle of no where, freezing his ass off, and seriously reconsidering several life choices, like making threats to terrorists on national TV.
“You did this.” Thor accused him, his half beaten in skull decorated with chunks of his brain hanging out and dripping blood down onto his shoulders.
With Bucky back and Rhodey in America for the foreseeable future Tony began to reach out to other superheroes to set up a network for big scale attacks like New York. He made alliances with Spider Man, Ant Man and the Wasp. The Black Panther who actually approached the Avengers as the Young King T’Challa was looking to end the isolationism of Wakanda and open the country up to the world.
Steeling herself Pepper stepped up on the podium and drew in a deep breath, “Thank you for coming.” She said to the assembled reporters, journalists, and photographers, “I am sure you all have many questions, and we will get to that, but first let me read out my official statement.”
“How about you big guy?” Tony asked Bruce, “Wanna come with me and the boys, or are you gonna go for a dip?”
Steve squeezed his fingers gently, “Promise I’ll try not to.” He sighed and looked around, “Is everyone else okay, Sam, Natasha?”
It was once they were in the limo that the nerves began to show. Natasha sat rigid in her seat, her back straight and fingers laced together on her lap, while her face remained expressionlessly calm, her knuckles had turned white from the tight clenching of her fingers.
The images of the twins came up on the holographic display listing their date of birth, estimated height, weight, and their enhancements.
Between the Hulk, Thor, and the fire department working together they managed to get the fire put out and made headway on shifting the debris where the epicentre of the explosion had occurred, as they went along charred remains of animals began to be pulled out of the wreckages, some completely unrecognizable and not just because of the burns but because of how weird they looked.
“Oh that’s nice, you’re friendly neighbourhood Deadpool stops by for a nice chat and a maybe a bit of group masturbation, he even brings a friend along with him to join in…”
“Really?” Steve scoffed his hands going to his hips, a sarcastic sneer on his face that didn’t belong there, Steve should never look like that, it didn’t suit him.
He writhed helplessly, keening and mewling as Steve’s cheeks hollowed and he took him deeper than ever, gripping him tight enough for there to be bruises on Tony’s hips in the morning, clenching toes and throwing back his head, Tony came, crying out shamelessly and spilling down Steve’s throat. As he lay panting and trying to gather up his blown apart brain cells, Tony felt Steve move and lay himself over him, his head resting on his stomach, and when he looked down he was met with a pair of shining sapphire eyes.
“Nothing good.” Steve growled, very aware of how much time had passed and how bad that was for Tony and Peter.
Tony’s eyelids felt heavy and it was a struggle to keep them open and hold Steve’s gaze, “You’ll stay?” he asked, hating how weak and needy he sounded but unable to stop himself either.
“Well, this is nice and depressing.” Clint said, setting shot glasses on a tray and brough them over with the tequila, lime wedges and salt, “But can you two kiss and make up so we can go back to focusing on Hydra?” He directed this at Natasha and Tony who looked disgusted at the suggestion, Tony looked around Clint to Natasha.
Steve inhaled sharply looking like he would crumble to pieces, “He didn’t recognise me, didn’t know me at all. I was nothing but a stranger to him, my best friend…and now I’ve left him again.”
With a full six months of no violence, and a good year of the same when he’d been hiding in Bucharest the courts did not feel he was a danger to anyone and acquitted him of the crimes he’d been facing making him a free man.
Steve growled low in his throat and looked two seconds away from filling Curien’s face in with his fist, Tony looked much the same but both of them restrained themselves.
Steve was waiting at the edge of the lake, “You don’t have to do this if you’re not comfortable.” He said, “You can just dip your feet and it’ll be enough.”
Sometimes it would end there and he’d wake up, other times he’d continue to dream, see his limbs freezing as the cold took hold of him, sometimes the Chitauri would tear him to pieces, taking an arm and leg each and ripping him apart, sometimes they’d toss him back through the closing portal and he would fall back to earth, his bloated body plummeting down, only the Hulk wouldn’t catch him this time, his fall wouldn’t stop until he smashed into the ground, every bone in his body shattering, every organ being shredded, his brain exploding over the street in a shower of blood.
Growing up in the depression Steve was no stranger to abuse. Desperate times made people more volatile, less inclined to care for others as they were struggling to care for themselves, and it wasn’t the done thing to mention that the Omega next door always had a black eye, or the Beta Woman was sporting a fat lip or had a broken arm, just as no one really noticed anything amiss when a child or Pup was beaten with a belt, or had his/her face backhanded, was sent to bed without supper.
“Mostly to let you know about Project Insight, but also, we have weeded out several probable Hydra agents within Shield, and, more worryingly, in the US Government.”
Tony smiled as he saw Steve and rose to greet him, “Hey Cap, what brings you to my crib?” he asked, making his way around the desk and held out a hand for Steve to take. The Captain did so, taking care not to crush Tony’s fragile looking fingers as he held them in his larger hand,
Steve shrugged, “Shouldn’t we?” he asked, “The letter said not to keep secrets, this is a secret unless we tell.”
“Very good Sir.” Jarvis replied as the boot repulsors powdered up and the suit was in flight once again, leaving Tony to face Killian with his single repulsor.
While MJ worked on getting into the computers from the inside, Peter began to go through the desk draws and filing cabinets looking for anything interesting and possibly incriminating, he was just flipping through a file when a loud moan made him jump and drop the folder to the floor, papers scattering everywhere.
“Well he was sent to kill us and failed to do so, I would think that mission still stands.” Tony said. “And he’ll probably be present at the hellicarriers when they launch, Hydra would likely have their best on the ground to secure the area.”
“Are you alright?” Steve was saying, his hand gently supporting Tony’s back and cupping his cheek to turn his pale face towards him.
Rogers struggled to sit up, his face was throbbing in a way it hadn’t in decades. Not since Red Skull had raised his fist to him in Austria all those years ago. Since the serum punches washed off him like rain drops, but this was different. This punch had not only hurt it had lain him flat on his back!
“That could be fun.” Bruce agreed, “We can pack up a lunch to go with us and spend the day walking.”
Steve knew it was illogical, knew that this was not his Tony. But he couldn’t help but hope that Tony and Pepper did not get back together. It was stupid. He had no claim on this Tony, but he felt drawn to him, and not just because he reminded him of his Tony.
“NO!” Zach shouted, suddenly pushed away from Peter and ran for his own room slamming the door behind him.
“Fuck that shit.” Tony snarled, “I’m Iron Man.” He launched himself at Thanos locking himself around the Titans back, blasting them off the ground and them slamming them back down. He beat Thanos into the earth once, twice, three times, before Thanos seized hold of him by his right foot, dragging him forward and slammed him down into the ground on his back, then up and over his shoulder and back again.
He'd gotten Bruce a classic dark grey suit, with a white shirt, and black silk tie and pocket handkerchief. He figured that the understated elegant look would appeal to Bruce more than anything more flashy.
For the first few weeks this was difficult as he suffered sickness, heartburn, and nausea. He was also repulsed by all fish so that had to be crossed of the list of foods even though they were one of the best he could eat.
“My lab.” Tony replied, “Most of it’s been shipped over to the Tower, but there’s still enough equipment to check this letter and a few others things.”
“Not in the least.” Bruce said, he was much happier on Hulk not being called on and would rather stay buried in his lab, only surfacing for food and sleep. He cocked his head at Steve, “It’ll be good for you and Tony to get some time together, away from kids and work. Some alone time.”
Snickering Steve picked Tony up and sat him on the shower stool so he could brush his teeth while the bath ran.
Bouncing forward Steve ran down the corridor, and leaped down the stairs, he tore into the large computer room that Jarvis had mentioned, he saw the suit in sentury mode and paused for a second before running through the tunnel and down the stairs to the lab where he felt his heart stutter to a stop in his chest.
“There now little Stark, are you feeling better?” Thor asked once Zach’s breathing returned to normal.
“No you didn’t.” Steve said, “You have been seriously hurt.” Peter shot him a scowl too and looked like he was biting back a rather brutal comment.
More coffee followed this, a very brief bathroom break for Steve who was absolutely bursting by then. After which he returned to his seat to watch the clock, while the others talked, walked, went and spoke to the receptionist to try and get updates, and shifted uncomfortably in their seats.
Pepper shrugged, “I was involved since the start, remember?” she said, “Ever since Phil made initial contact. Then Romanoff, pretending to be Rushman.”
“Hopefully a promise of blueberry pancakes will win him over.” Steve said, knowing that Tony wouldn’t be happy about a dawn wake up call.
“It hasn’t said anything?” Steve asked glaring at the green thing in the cell that didn’t even had the decency to look afraid.
“I’m sorry, Director.” Steve apologized, rubbing the back of his neck and looked embarrassed since more than half the order of supplies were for him.
Peter was still unhappy when they got back to the tower, something neither Tony or Steve liked to see, he was clearly feeling guilty about his actions but they couldn’t just let this go, they could not afford for him to have violent out bursts now he was enhanced, it would have been bad enough if he was a baseline human but now he was enhanced it was far too dangerous.
“And proud of it.” Tony said giving Steve’s chest a pat, “Come on big guy, lets go and get some breakfast, you’re going to need all your strength.”
Steve grinned to himself as he took the lift up the building, he supposed he shouldn’t find Tony’s whining so cute, but damn it, Tony looked so adorable when he pouted that it would be like kicking a puppy not to find it cute. Then again everything about Tony was cute, or rather it was attractive.
"Why, what's wrong with him?" Zach demanded, "Is it Chicken Pox?" he could remember his own ordeal with the nasty itchy blisters that had resulted in him sitting in a gross slimy oat bath. He wouldn't blame Peter for not wanting anyone around him if he was like that. But Peter said you could only get it once and that he'd had it, so it couldn't be that. "Did his Apex burst?" he asked remembering hearing about the strange organ that was in people's tummies that was never used but sometimes burst.
Steve worried at his bottom lip, the bite had healed already but it was still slightly sore to the touch, “What if it doesn’t work out?” He asked, “What if we end up not being able to stay friends?” That was his biggest concern. He’d found a place here, the start of a family, if he took the chance and asked Tony out and it didn’t work there was a risk he’d lose everything, he wasn’t sure he was willing to take that chance.
Steve grinned, “I’m flattered, and I would love him to think of me as a Father. So long as it’s alright with you.”
“Wait!” Steve crossed the small distance and joined Tony taking hold of his good hand, “Squeeze me hand.” He instructed the Omega.
The party was going to be held at a miniature bowling ally with pizza and ice cream after. A Post Script note from Cal’s parents asked for any dietary requirements like gluten and lactose free to be given to them in advance so they could alert the diner before the party and ensure that the needs would be catered for.
“Peter’s in the hospital sleeping off a tranquilizer, Zach’s been abducted most likely by the fucking Mandarin. Now what does the military know about this fucker?”
Rogers glowered at the news report on the screen that showed images of Bucky walking to a limo with Stark leading him. Bucky’s shoulders were hunched, he looked frightened, like a caged animal. Obviously Stark had taken him prisoner and was planning to do God knows what to him, maybe brain wash him to working for him like Hydra had done.
Bruce paused in his run to take off his glasses and put them in his pocket, he also took off his jacket and shirt, pausing when he saw Natasha and Clint running towards them, “We’ve got help.”
“I’m gonna be Time Lord Professor!” Zach cheered and squirmed in Tony’s arms, “Want pancakes Mamma.” He said reaching for his plate where a half eaten pancake sat drowning in syrup.
Since Pepper’s press conference the media had blown up in regards to Peter and Zach being enhanced, so far it seemed that the world was split fifty fifty on who was to blame, with perhaps a little more siding towards pro Stark pro Avengers.
He was little nervous around Zach at first too, probably because he’d never been around babies before, but he soon warmed up to his new little brother and began to help Tony with bedtime stories, the two of them taking turns at reading to Zach and getting him to sleep.
The Avengers might not even survive, Tony might be forced to give up Iron Man, to leave the Avengers completely, to leave Steve, and he would have to do so if the court forced him to so he could keep his children.
He would have probably gone on for a lot longer, but Steve had taken the opportunity to grab him by his t-shirt and tug him close and shut him up with the kiss of his life.
Tony staggered, his head spinning, blood tricking down his face from a gnash on his forehead, blasting off once more, he lined up the sights to take another shot, only for inhumanly strong arms to wrap about him and a body to force him to the ground, pinning him there.
“No,” Rogers said, with a confidence that down right foolish, “We defeated the Chitauri. I don’t know how it went down in your world,” he gestured to Steve dismissively, “But in this one, we won, and Tony? Natasha is right. This belief that aliens are coming has already done enough damage, you have got to let this go before you lose your mind.”
“No.” Sam said. “I can’t do this anymore. I thought I knew Steve, knew you. Turns out I don’t know shit.” He shook his head, “I don’t know how you live with yourself, you and Rogers. Living in Stark’s property, eating the food he pays for, using the equipment he builds, and never once saying a word to him.”
Tony mumbled something, wriggling more and Steve bit hard on his lip hoping that the pain would distract him from his raging hard on.
“Jarvis sent me your coordinates.” Rhodey said, “I just saw an airship heading off, should we be following that?”
When Zach had happily declared that Steve was his new Daddy to the waitress in the ice cream shop, Steve had felt like his heart would burst, especially when Zach had said that he was the “Bestest Daddy ever!”
Peter had called him a child abuser and stomped off to sulk with Zach’s singing following him along with his parents laughter.
He was relieved when he got to put his shirt back on, hiding the arc reactor from view along with his scars, Steve had gone quiet again as he collected up used cotton balls and put them into the bin.
Bruce was shifting nervously in his new dress shoes and Clint was running his finger about his collar only to get Natasha slapping his hand down as they waited for Tony and Steve to join them.
Steve let out a breath, nodding his head in relief. “Tony called.” He said answering Natasha’s question, “He’s in Rose Hill Tennessee. Someone there was recently involved in an explosion, it was recorded as a suicide but before his system shut down, Jarvis made a connection between this guy and the Mandarin attacks.”
For once in his life Tony had no idea what to say, he sat there staring at Steve, wondering if anyone would mind if he just crawled into the mans lap and began to hump him in public!
“He did.” Rhodey confirmed, “The guy is really gone on you, he is serious about dating you properly, so you know what you have to do.”
Fury snorted and Natasha rolled her eyes. These two should be given white walking sticks if they couldn’t see what was right in front of them, and she would bet the next six months of her salary that neither of them had a clue.
“I will be.” Tony said, running his good hand through his hair. “Stane, all this shit was because of him. That bastard is sill fucking up my life even from beyond the grave. He fucked over Maya, and because I was drugged up to my eyeballs because I was dealing with his shit, I fucked over Killian and it all led to this.” Intellectually Tony knew that Killian’s madness was not his fault, he should have known better than to take the word of drunken and drugged man, but having come so close to losing his Sons and his best friend to this vengeance, Tony would not be letting go of the guilt anytime soon.
“PETER!” Zach yelled at the top of his lungs, jumping off Tony’s lap and running as fast as he could to Peter’s room.
“Why are you so hard on yourself?” He asked, sitting down on the edge of the faux glass coffee table, “Why do you think that you have to be some sort of saint instead of just a normal, fallible human like the rest of us?”
“I do need them Pep, and I won’t be selfish with them, the staff can use them too, just think of the benefit for their stress levels! You can even hold your boring board meetings in there and when some stuffy old fart gets to annoying you can shoot him without getting arrested!”
Steve laughed and pulled Tony in closer for kiss that lingered, “What about you?” He asked, “Will you got for the traditional white and green?”
Natasha smirked, “If you believed that you’d have never closed down the weapons manufacturing. What’s wrong Stark, guilty conscience? All that blood on your hands keeping you awake at night?” Her smile became poisonous and vindictive, “Tell me, how do you reconcile the fact you murdered your Sons Father, your own husband?”
“Wait till you start learning algebra, that sucks.” Peter put in and tossed a fry at Zach with a grin,
“Indeed Violet, you don’t look at a day over seventy-five.” The woman said, “How old are you again?”
“Steve Roger’s, meet Sharon Carter, also known as Agent 13.” Natasha said, “She was placed in an apartment next to you to… keep and eye on you and how you were adapting to the twenty-first century.”
“No, Stellina, no. It doesn’t work that way.” Tony assured his Toddler, “You are perfect, you are my star, nothing your Father did has any influence on you or the man you will become.”
No doubt the spoilt Billionaire would have his lawyers and secretaries working tirelessly to paint them as the bad guys. That alternate reality him would be backing Tony up, making himself out to be a hero, when hadn’t he already proven he’d failed? He’d let his world burn while fleeing like a coward.
Just as dawn was starting to break, the sky turning pink with streaks of orange as the sun just crested over the city, Bruce wheeled Tony into Peter’s room.
“Nor does Tony have fake tits, which that bride clearly has.” Natasha scoffed, “They look like a couple of cantaloupes shoved down her dress.”
“Can I touch him?” Peter asked the doctor, his fingers flexing nervously, desperately wanting to hold Tony’s hand but not daring to do so in case he hurt him.
“Wha….” Peter mouth dropped open and he stared at MJ in horror, recoiling as she took a tape measure from her pocket, “Lets get you measured up!”
How much could a person lose before it killed them? He couldn’t remember, wasn’t sure he wanted to know, not when the percentage could mean the difference between life and death for his partner, not when this drying blood on his clothes might be the last part of him he ever got to hold.
“Pete.” He said, securing Zach’s sleeping form with his right hand while he extended his left arm to Peter, offering him a one arms hug. Peter hesitated for a minute, looking uncertain, then he sank down into the embrace. He turned and hide his face, pressing it into the back of the sofa and Steve pretended that he couldn’t feel the shudders running through Peters body or the tears that were dampening his shirt, he gave Peter his privacy and just held him as best he could while he tried to think of what to do now.
Vision, having spent days locked up with Reed in the lab, went and gave his last stand against Thanos, getting ripped apart by the mad Titan as he tried to defend one of the few remaining emergency shelters. His sacrifice was noble, but it afforded nothing, the shelter was slaughtered along with the Android.
Steve couldn’t find anything to say to that, couldn’t manage anything other than a weak smile and a nod of his head. Natasha seemed to find this enough though and release his wrist but remained besides him until Pepper arrived with Happy and the boys.
Okay so he had a daughter, he could have sent her through with her Mother couldn’t he? Then he could have fought on like a man, not turned tail and run.
“Not a team, a family.” Steve corrected, “And yes, the battle of New York was a turning point for me, for all of us I think. I was fresh out of the ice, struggling to find a place in this world and then suddenly there are demi Gods in Germany, portals opening in the skies of New York, giant green rage monsters, and a very beautiful Omega flying around in a gold and red suit.”
Steve sighed, “He saved me, got me to the river bank.” He’d hoped Bucky would have stuck around, hoped that he’d gotten his friend back, the fact Bucky had saved him proved that he remembered something.
Bruce had bought Zach a children’s book on the cosmos and a decent telescope, promising to help teach him about the stars.
Digging through the debris was reminiscent of the time that the Lehigh base had been bombed and Tony and Steve had been buried beneath the ruins, only this time Steve was on the outside helping Natasha and Clint to shift brick, metal, and glass.
“Uh huh,” Clint said, “Tony got a call, they’re reconvening at ten tomorrow..” he glanced at the clock, “This morning and will have their decision.”
“Zachs…. Zachs… Kidnapped….” Tony’s voice sounded faint and Steve could hear the far too rapid intake of breaths down the phone.
Tony had Jarvis investigating, Natasha was also investigating, calling in old contacts as was Clint, but it was going to take time dig up enough dirt on the pair to bring them down.
“Nnno.” Tony pushed regretfully and weakly at Steve’s chest, not really wanting to push him away, what he really wanted to do was wrap his arms about that broad chest and rub his body up against Steve, but he couldn’t, he knew he couldn’t, it wouldn’t be fair on Steve. The Alpha was so young, he deserved so much better than Tony had to offer.
Disabling the first ship was easy, then as they went to the second one they were spotted by Rumlows band of assholes and the fighting began.
Back in the forties an unmated or widowed Omega would have a guardian Alpha, usually a family member, or if there was no family, then a close family friend would do instead, and when an Alpha or a male Beta wanted to court said Omega, he or she would ask the guardian Alpha’s permission to take them out. It was pretty much the same as asking a Beta Female’s Father for her hand in marriage.
Likewise Natasha had no qualms about being filmed practising her knife throwing and shurikan throws, happily demonstrating the deadly art as she impaled dummies and targets with grace and deadly accuracy.
“Not if they want to see you alive again, they won’t.” The man besides Zach growled, he grabbed Zach by his t-shirt and pulled him close so he was snarling into Zach’s face, “Now you shut up, or I swear I will give you beating of your life, have you bound and gagged and thrown in the boot for the rest of the trip, understand me kid?”
The following day, Steve fashioned himself a spear from a fallen branch and waded out into the lake to catch fish while Tony hand Peter and Zach searching for light weight wood for their raft while he found vines and flexible branches to bind the planks together. It wouldn’t be a stable as it would if they were using rope, but it might hold for a few minutes.
“You can’t determine that from the readings you already have?” Steve asked, not really relishing the thought of Tony going through another of those nightmares.
“Don’t be.” Steve said, “I never really knew Howard that well and he always seemed rather arrogant and too showy.” Howard Stark might have been very intelligent, he might also have been a slick businessman and a charmer when he was in the mood, but Steve had always gotten the impression that there was a mean streak in Howard, that he had a nasty side to him, one that was full of greed, contempt for anyone that he felt was lesser than himself, and a jealous need to always be the best, to be a King in all but name.
Accessories after the fact, perverting the course of justice, aiding and abetting, the list went on with the crimes they’d be charged with and there was no statute of limitations on murder.
Clint grinned unrepentantly and began to cackle at Steve’s flushed cheeks while Tony glared, “I hate you Barton.”
“Understood.” Natasha said, getting to her feet, she nudged Clint, kicking his ankle when he didn’t move fast enough.
Shaking and gritting her teeth, Maria turned on her heel, hurrying to grab a blanket to wrap Tony in and shouted for Jarvis to get the car to take her to the hospital.
“I would have preferred later.” Tony grumbled, then thought better of it and looked worriedly to Steve, “I just wanted us to have some privacy for a while.”
“They won’t get that chance.” Steve growled, his nose flaring and teeth bared, “Because we are going to find those two and take care of them permanently.”
“The Widow, The Witch. I saw them. I don’t want them near me, don’t want the Witch in my head, I won’t go back to being like before, Winter don’t wanna neither.”
“Probably not so do fascinate us please.” Tony deadpanned, shifting Lily who grabbed onto his beard, “Oww, sweetie please, we’ve talked about this.” He took her hand from his face and Lily giggled, blowing a raspberry at him.
“Thanos. What he’ll do, what will happen if we fail.” Tony looked up at Steve, his eyes shining with unshed tears. “We can’t fail Steve, we just can’t.”
“I have to go to him.” Tony said trying to get up again only to be rendered on his back once more with a coughing fit that left his head pounding and spinning.
“Were you defending yourself, was that kid with the weird nickname bullying you again?” Tony demanded, “What is it, Crash, Trash?”
There were bottles of water and boxes of snack food besides the bed, the linens were fresh and the air in the room was pleasantly cool with a scent of rose petals that mingled well with Tony’s natural scent.
“Tony?” He called out and heard a groan from the billionaire just before a metal fist shattered the windscreen, grabbed it’s metal frame and ripped it out of the car.
Breathing like an enraged bull, his eyes bulging with fury and spittle frothing at his mouth Norman let out a savage snarl and punched Tony in the face.
“Murderer.” Another voice said, this one female, accented, and seemed to float around in Tony’s mind.
It would have been the perfect moment had it not been for Justin Hammer whining that Natasha had broken his arm, the sirens screaming, the phone cameras flashing, and Clint Cat calling them. The date that followed two days later had been perfect and hadn’t involved any of those things, (Except Steve refused to have sex on a first date despite Tony being very willing to put out) He didn’t resist on the second date though, and they had been going from strength to strength since then.
He led them into the Tower and took them up to the common room, where Tony was speaking a frazzeled and sleep deprived looking Bruce.
“So, between arguing with Pepper about making fun floors for stress relief, I sent a drone over Camp Leheigh.” Tony said pulling up and image of the old training ground.
“Perfect.” Pepper said making Steve turn in front of her, “Now shoes, I think boots would be best, they fit better with jeans than shoes do, and you are not wearing trainers even though Tony lives in them.” Steve grinned at her put upon tone, if he could get away with it Tony would wear nothing but his trainers, having even managed to wear a pair with his tux to a gala one time, much to Pepper’s chagrin.
“I would not be too sure of that, Sir.” Jarvis said. This gave Tony pause and he momentarily stopped rubbing conditioner into his hair.
“Having a pee.” Peter said, “I made sure he stayed away from the poison ivy and the stinging nettles.”
But when he looked down at Morgan he knew that he couldn’t just cling to his anger, things weren’t better, there was so much left to do, to work through, to resolve, he and Steve weren’t alright, they couldn’t just go back to how they had been, but Morgan deserved to have her Father in her life and Steve deserved to a part of her life…
“Do you want it because you want me or because you want to prove something to yourself or to us both?”
“Good thinking.” Wanda praised him, “Now lets get to the port and find a ship, I’m sure I can convince the crew to take us on board and either get us to a bigger docks or take us all the way to New York.”
Having worked up a good appetite they stopped for lunch early at the first summit and took time sating their hunger and snapping pictures before they moved on.
Tony was still only half convinced that this wasn’t some kind of hallucination as Steve carried him to the penthouse, making his way through the redecorated apartment and taking Tony into his bedroom.
The crew filmed the team as they engaged a couple of rounds of capture the flag, they split into two teams, Steve, Sam, and Clint on team A, and Tony, Thor, and Natasha on team B.
“That is enough Tony!” Rogers snapped, “There is no need to get insulting, and you know that Wanda has been through a lot, cut her some slack won’t you?” Tony opened his mouth to respond to that, but Rogers wasn’t done, “You might own the building, but we are The Avengers, and we are the ones who have the right to decide what goes on in our building.” He straightened up, standing to his full height, towering over Tony, using his mass to intimidate the smaller man, “Besides, you are on very thin ice after all you have done lately.”
Gritting his teeth he continued on, wincing for the pain in his arm, he needed to see a Doctor, needed to get this treated or he risked infection. He hoped the damage wasn’t too bad, but at least it wasn’t is dominant arm and he could get an apprentice to work under his tutelage.
Tony snickered at his Son’s serious expression, but in truth Zach’s tendency to climb into and hide in the boxes had hindered their packing somewhat.
A sharp in take of breath startled both men and to their horror, when they turned and looked they saw Zach standing in the doorway.
“You sure you still want to get involved?” Steve asked him, “This is going to be dangerous, very dangerous.”
The trauma team moved swiftly getting the gurney moving to the door and into the hospital, as they moved down the corridor the consultant ordered immediate scans to be taken, bloods, and the theatre to be prepped.
"No, he doesn't have gastric flu." Bruce said his cheeks turning slightly pink since Zach spoke in a voice loud enough for everyone in the cafe to hear him. A couple of people looked disgusted, some were laughing quietly, while the elder patrons gave Bruce sympathetic looks obviously recalling their own Pups being rather out spoken at inapropriate times.
Bullets started to be fired and Peter put an extra burst of speed into his climbing, reaching the skylight fired his webbing, swinging off the ceiling to climb back up to the roof only an incredible pain exploded in his leg just above his knee making him scream and let go of his webbing.
The official story for what happened is that Jarvis remote piloted the suit to the factory, that Zach never left my side, he had no involvement in Killian’s death, that was down to me, Rhodey, Natasha, and Clint. He was hiding in the debris until it was all over.”
Tony gagged and spluttered, he thumped uselessly at the man’s chest but it felt like he was hitting solid metal, the grip tightened and stars exploded before Tony’s eyes as the blood supply to his brain was cut off as well as his air, he wouldn’t last long like this, a few seconds at the most and the last thing he would see were soulless eyes staring at him as his throat was crushed.
“This is seriously fucked up.” Peter muttered and nearly leaped out of his skin when a scaled monkey threw itself against the glass. It had the form of a monkey but the skin of a reptile and the snout of an alligator.
“She is going to be a nightmare when she starts walking.” Tony sighed, dreading trying to keep the little imp out of trouble,
The boys spent a good fifteen minutes sending Zach and Emma careening around the garden before the crate finally began to show signs of stress, by which time, Grace ordered Harley and Emma to go and wash up for Dinner, as Tony did for Zach and Peter. With so many mouths to feed and the Avengers not wanting to put Grace out, dinner was a simple pizza take away, but Grace insisted on providing dessert, which, as she had two young children, was kept child oriented, Cake and Ice cream. But the home made jam sponge was delicious, and the Neapolitan ice cream was the perfect accompaniment.
“Can we make caramel popcorn again?” Peter asked eagerly, “And watch the movies Mamma won’t let me see?”
“I think you should stay here,” He said to Tony, “So that I…. we can take care of you.” His slip did not go unnoticed by Natasha and Sam, both of whom smirked knowingly and Steve knew he’d be in for some serious teasing soon.
“Not quite.” Tony corrected, “Look closer. The Loki one is a perfect copy of you right now, everything, even the injuries you were carrying. It was a complete match. But look at Sceptre Steve, or rather look between his eyebrows, the corners of his mouth, his forehead.”
Steve’s cheeks flushed at this and Tony snorted with laughter, “Okay, enough dirty and baby talk for one night, let’s get some sleep before Zach bursts in here demanding pancakes at dawn.”
“Don’t even think about it.” Rhodey warned Natasha, his gauntlets trained on her. The Black Widow regarded him dispassionately. Though if you looked closely you could see the gears turning in her head as she thought the best way for her to get out of this.
Seeing his creator getting to the end of his rope after two days of this battle with Zach, Jarvis called in reinforcements, namely Steve.
“Right, okay.” Steve agreed, hoping that he wouldn’t do anything embarrassing in the night, like snuggling against Tony, or god forbid, wouldn’t wake up flush against him with his morning erection pressing against Tony’s thighs, or worse, his backside!
“Ugh, that’s going to take some fixing.” He murmured rubbing at his sore throat, he then looked to a shell shocked Steve, “How are you doing?”
The coffee he drank, grimacing at the terrible taste, the food he ignored, focusing on the clock across the room and watched at the minute hand ticked away.
“I umm, I had an ablation surgery.” He whispered looking down at his feet, “They lasered my fallopian tubes.”
Natasha sat back on the sofa to talk with Thor giving half her attention to the board game and the Thunder God.
Steve felt tired, so very tired. He wanted to say no, to go and join Pepper in the infirmary by Happy’s bedside and wait for the end. But he couldn’t do that, he couldn’t condemn Lily. It was bad enough she’d lost her Daddy, would soon loose her Mother, she didn’t need to loose her Papa and her life.
Fury ignored the question and went into a long speech about how Howard had been planning to create a new energy source that would dwarf nuclear reactors, how Vanko had been only in it for the money and had been planning to sell the research to the highest bidders, at which point Howard had him deported and when the Russians learned Vanko couldn’t make the reactors work on his own, had him dumped in Siberia.
“So you survived. No attacks by wild bears, wolves, masked psychopaths, or mutated river creatures?” Rhodey teased as Steve, Tony, and the boys arrived back at the tower.
When he was able to move again Tony moved and spooned around Steve, resting his chin on Steve's shoulder, "Hail the victorious invaders!"
Stark Mansion, for all it’s sprawling and imposing grander was lived in, it was warm and inviting, Tony had made it a home with his small family, letting toys, trainers, discarded sweaters, and homework clutter up the place, had childish drawings on the walls with the oil paintings, photos of himself with the kids and dozens of the kids everywhere.
Stark was in Vienna. He knew that, it had been all over the news, that Stark was having a meeting with the United Nations in Vienna.
“No, they gave me more!” Trevor happily declared. “They gave me things, they gave me this palace, plastic surgery, they gave me things.” He lay back in his chair, his eyes closed. A moment passed, then another, and another.
The host nodded, “From what the world has seen of the boys they are very well behaved and friendly children.”
“Yeah, so umm, I’m pretty erratic, this is my first in eight months; I’m in pre-heat now, got scent blocker on, but I’ll be in full heat the day after tomorrow.” Tony said, shifting from foot to foot. A lot of Omegas became agitated before their heats, were unable to settle, to concentrate, to do anything really as their bodies flooded with hormones in preparation for potentially conceiving a litter.
The lift opened onto the penthouse floor where Pepper and Tony were engaging in argument, or rather Pepper was trying to make Tony see how absurd his plans were.
Once all the presents were open they had breakfast and went to shower and dress for the day. Cooking Christmas dinner had been split into individual jobs, Bruce was in charge of the Turkey, Steve was in charge of the stuffing. Natasha was in charge of the roasted vegetables, Rhodey was in charge of the gravy and other condiments, Tony was in charge of the bacon wrapped sausages, Pepper was in charge of the boiled vegetables, and Happy was in charge of the Christmas pudding.
His physical strength had also increased greatly, something that was discovered by accident. Bruce had been shifted some lab equipment and it had toppled over, Peter had grabbed it and lifted it with ease not realising until after he’d done it that he’d been lifted four-hundred pounds without so much as a grimace.
“But it isn’t the same,” Tony said, his face tragic as he gazed at Steve, “I knew what I was doing, Clint didn’t, I was in control of my actions.”
“This will ruin Stark’s lawsuit.” He declared enthusiastically. “That bleeding heart whelp will drop the suit faster than he drops his pants in order to keep his brat in school.”
Pressing a hand to his chest which ached from where he was still aching from his arrythmia earlier. He was more than ready to take a shower and curl up in bed when Steve came out of one of the guest bedrooms looking bewildered.
Chuckling appreciatively, Steve adjusted his grip, tightening his hold on Tony and moving them so the Billionaire was beneath him. He could feel Steve’s erection against his thigh, hard and damp with precum, and Hello! Steve was big all over. Tony would bet that there was a good nine or ten solid inches rubbing happily against his thigh and the thought of having that firm flesh buried inside him made his own cock twitch and leak between his and Steve’s stomachs.
“No thanks necessary, Cap.” Tony said with a slightly forced smile, “And you haven’t even met all my Kids yet, you’ve got to meet the boys.”
“Could be that they are planning to?” Steve suggested, “They could be planning to move all of this?”
Surprise flashed through baby blue eyes that was quickly replaced by suspicion, “What, how..?” he looked to Tony, “What is going on?”
“Aye.” Thor said give his friends a smile as tears shone in his eyes, “Truly now I do feel lost. Where as first after her death I felt I knew my course, I knew I had to avenge her and prevent Maliketh from using the Reality Stone. Now that both are done, I am at a loss as to what my path shall now be.
So stop your behaviour now and think of what your actions today or tomorrow or next week might mean for you in ten years time, when you want to go to Harvard or Yale. Do you really want to throw your future away just so you can torment someone?
“I’m sorry Zach, I’m sorry honey, but he can’t wake up right now.” Steve said keeping a firm hold of Zach so he couldn’t get down and jump on the bed. He only wanted to cuddle Tony of course but it was too risky, he could accidently hurt Tony, pull out tubes and wires, even jolt his spine.
Steve braced himself for the pain of his bones breaking but it never came, instead there came a blast from one of Tony’s repulsors and Bucky was thrown back, freeing Steve who coughed and spluttered, looking to where Bucky had fallen.
Peter snorted remembering the weeks that had followed with Steve being inundated with Condoms by Tony and Clint, the pair cackling dementedly as they tormented Steve.
The amount of blood the Winter Soldier, that Bucky had left in his wake devastated Steve. The amount of people that had suffered because of his failure to save his friend, if only he’d been faster, if only he’d been able to reach Bucky’s hand then none of this would have happened.
As his encryption worked on revealing what Shield was really doing with the tesseract, Fury, Romanoff, Thor, and Rogers descended on the lab and within minutes an argument broke out with everyone tearing strips off each other and blaming one another for their reasons for what they were doing.
"Thank God you're okay." Tony said to Peter while Steve thanked the Doctor, "We were so worried, we thought...." He broke off and swallowed hard, stroking Peter's hair back from his face, "We were really worried baby."
“Mamma?” Zach whispered, his throat was so dry from crying that he could barely get the word out and his voice was hoarse and scratchy as he spoke. He cringed again as Killian grinned at him.
Steve snorted and rolled his eyes, he went and put the wash cloth back in the bathroom, then re-joined Tony in the bed. “Perhaps I will be rescuing you from evil villains.” He said, “And in gratitude you will give yourself to me.”
His palms were sweating and his stomach was churning as he stepped off the ledge and reached braced his feet against the wall, the web was holding him well and he was able to start descending down the side of the building.
“Nice, good and firm with just enough squeeze.” Tony praised enjoying the fact that Steve’s face was turning crimson.
“I don’t gotta home.” Bucky whispered hunching his shoulders and ducking his head as the first police cars screeched to a halt, by now a crowd had gathered to watch the interaction, forming a circle about them, blocking off an easy escape route for Bucky which was only serving to make him even more antsy.
Many people came to the funeral to pay their respects, though Tony doubted that Peter remembered any of them, or took notice of them, save for his friend Ned, a chubby boy who actually managed to make Peter smile slightly as the adults talked about them, drinks and plates of finger food in their hands.
Tony nodded his head once not trusting himself to speak, he could feel a dull ache at the back of his throat and a burning in his eyes that meant he was at risk of crying and there was no way he was doing that in front of this doctor.
Peter shifted, trying to get comfortable in the crappy hospital bed, "Did everyone else get out okay?" He asked, "MJ, Ned?"
Steve went with them refusing to be separated from Peter right now, the last thing the kid needed was to be apart from him when his whole world had been turned upside down.
“Who were?” Natasha demanded taking all of the Skrulls fingers into her hand and bent them back threatening to snap them.
Steve’s anger carried him on three runs around central park before it had finally fizzled out, leaving him with discomforting hurt over Tony not trusting him.
I want you all to be modern Twenty-First century men and women, and to stop cruelty when you see it. If you know that someone is being bullied, then help them, befriend them, have your friends befriend them too, a bully will be less likely to act if they see their victim has support, because a bully is a coward, their only power is fear, and once that is taken away, they have nothing.
Jarvis was less trusting now, was more guarded of his maker, never again wanting to come close to losing him. He also took greater care over his makers mental health as well as his physical health.
Minutes, so many minutes had passed since Tony had gone under the water. Steve was all to well aware that it would only take three for Tony to die. That the lack of air would force him to take a breath and that when he did, when he couldn’t resist the urge to breathe for any longer, he would drown.
Thor thumped down on the ground and sent Mjolnir into a swing, holding out his hand for her return, “The sceptre must be here.” He said, “They’d never have achieved this without it.” He caught Mjolnir, “We’ve found it, at long last.”
“I’ll by fine.” Tony assured Peter, “And I believe our business here is concluded?” He looked to the Principal and the school board. “Peter may return to school?”
“Really?” Tony looked at him in surprise, “Okay, I guess I can make you something, you won’t need it in Kevlar.”
“Oh, and you’re gonna offer me a magic cure?” Tony drawled, his voice dripping with sarcasm, he yelped when a needle was plunged into his neck, “God, fuck, what are you gonna sell my damn kidneys on the black market or something? Jesus Christ.”
By the time they left the hospital the next day the story had of course got out and the press were waiting for them to get pictures and confirm that Tony had no idea he’d been pregnant until he’d given birth.
“You tell ‘em Spider-Spunk!” Deadpool cheered, and proceeded to plaster himself against Tony’s side humping him, “Besides, Iron Buns, we’ll never get to have that threesum I’ve been wet dreaming about since we first met.”
“I’m amazed you survived at all.” Natasha cleared her throat, “We should arrange to meet.” She said, “A location, preferably public, a crowd will grant us anonymity.”
“And Tony is very strong.” Natasha said, “He won’t be kept down by this injury for very long. He’ll turn this around one way or another.”
Jumping, Bucky did the only thing he could think of, which was bolt into the bathroom, slamming and locking the door, leaning against the wood he breathed heavily, his eyes searching out for possible weapons. A straight razor lay on a shelf above the sink, that would do. He made two large strides across the room to grab it only for the door to knocked on,
Steve had thought he’d already faced the worst moment in his life in 1942, when he’d been hanging off the side of a train trying to reach down and pull Bucky back to safety only to watch his best friend fall to what he’d been sure was his death.
“It’s not Stark’s whereabouts we’re interested, Romanoff.” Hill said, “It’s Banner, Thor, and Rogers. Stark has them staying with him, correct?” She didn’t wait for a reply, “Well, it’s pretty obvious that he’ll be running the show, and it is imperative that they be kept under observation. Stark is easy to find, therefore so are they and we want to know what they are doing at all times.”
“Super dumbass genius.” Peter said giving Tony a leer when he side eyed him. “And yeah I know I’m grounded, what else is new.”
Genius, Billionaire, ex-Playboy (He was a one super soldier Man these days) Philanthropist. Junk food addict, caffeine addict, workaholic, and possessor of the best ass in America if not the world (Okay he might be exaggerating there.) He also had the best boyfriend in the whole world, who somehow managed to put up with all of his bullshit, and had sweettalked his AI and Bots into allowing him to kidnap Tony from the workshop and carry him to bed when he felt he’d been away for too long.
Bucky tensed when he saw handcuffs being drawn and Tony stepped forward, putting himself between Bucky and the Police which startled to Super Soldier since it was so odd a thing for someone to do, to risk their own lives for him.
Damnit, Hammer tech, why did trust that idiot Hammer to build the security systems and the self-destruct, he should have replaced the lot when the moron went to prison.
“As do I.” Tony hissed back at him, “And after you lose in court how much influence do you think you will still have? And I think you will find that many would be sympathetic to Peter’s cause when they learn that he was simply defending his friend who your Son attacked.”
“Mamma?” Zach asked approaching the bed, his Mamma put the tablet down looking startled to see Zach.
After an hour or so mingling everyone went and took their seats at their designated tables, the Avengers thankfully had one together on their own so they could relax through the meal.
“I know.” Tony said, “And I know they won’t shut the fuck up and fuck off until they get a toy of their very own to play with, but I don’t trust them as far as I could throw them without the suit on, but I do trust you, so, you get to be War Machine, you and only you, no one else gets their ass in that armour, got me?”
“No, that will not happen.” Steve assured him, “You are a brilliant Mother, anyone with eyes can see that. Peter and Zach are healthy and generally happy. This is a first time incident for Peter, social services won’t hold one fight against him.”
Peter quickly took his fists off the arms of the chair before he crushed them in his fear. Steve or Tony hurt, His Mother or his Father hurt.
“Yeah I know.” Tony said, “I wouldn’t have said diving here was a good idea if there wasn’t a way back up.”
“Are we going to tell Bruce and Thor?” He asked as Tony dithered over choosing which car to drive back to the Mansion.
“Now get your feathered ass into a shower and get yourself dressed in that gorgeous Armani suit Tony bought for you.” Natasha ordered him.
Why wouldn’t it be okay? Tony tried to remember what had happened and frowned when the Doctor asked him if he remembered what had brought him to the hospital.
“There were labs coverin’ most oh the second and third floor, Dawg.” Darnel said, “But if ya mean the freaky ass ones with the weird shit an’ the ones that were inside o’ that, then they were on the third floor right over there.”
“Jarvis, sentry mode.” He ordered as they touched down, he grit his teeth at the sound of shrieking and grinding metal, gears protesting and groaning as they forced to move. Showers of sparks and metal filings sprayed the air as the suit opened allowing Tony to get free with some difficulty, it didn’t open up as wide as it should so he had to squeeze out, jarring his injuries as he went.
She had greeted the Avengers with warmth but was clearly rather overwhelmed by all the attention her Son’s assistance of Tony had brought them, and how much Tony was willing to do to repay the kindness shown him.
Clint gave Zach a childs archery set, promising that he’d teach Zach how to use it safely and that he’d never let Zach get hurt.
“Think about kicking your sorry arse? Yeah, already got that covered, Captain Sometimes my team mates don’t tell me everything.” He flew around, coming in hot and blasted at Rogers with both gauntles, the shield deflecting the blast but sent Rogers skidding back through the dirt with the force of the energy being released.
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes, “Yeah, well, some Dad’s are assholes and abandon their families, and there’s no reason to be a pussy about it because you’re better off without him.” The boy looked up surprised at Tony’s word choice. “What’s your name rugrat?”
“I’m scared Steve.” Tony said, “I’m scared for Peter, for his future. We don’t know that we’ll be able to help him get control of his temper, what this enhancement will do to him.” He bit his bottom lip and shook his head, “He’s so young Steve, he shouldn’t be dealing with this, he shouldn’t be struggling and worrying about this.” He clenched his fist in frustration, “I should have the answers for him, I should be able to fix this for him.”
“No, Europe somewhere,” Sam said, “I think Natasha is more interested in getting to somewhere with no extradition treaty while Rogers wants to find Barnes.” Rhodey snorted, rolling his eyes, as if that was news.
“Lemme go!” Zach cried struggling against the man who’s hand seemed to be burning him it hurt so much. The two men who’d been looking for him soon joined them, holstering their guns and glaring at Zach.
Zach glared at him, bottom lip wobbling and eyes watery looking like he was going to burst into tears, but to everyone’s astonishment he spread his lips and spat directly into the mans face!
“I never got the chance to learn.” Steve said, “Before the serum no one wanted to dance with a scrawny twig they were likely to break and then afterwards Peggy was going to teach me, but then the ice happened and well…” He gestured as if to say here I am.
“I don’t….not all the bodies have been identified.” Steve said, and considering the state the bodies were in it would be dental records and DNA that would identify them.
He’d soldiered on through the morning, welcoming Peter and May happily, then Pepper and Rhodey, Clint, Laura, and the Kids.
Zach squirmed, his knees were hurting and so were his shoulders where the man had gripped him, he tried to wriggle free but the man was too strong as he carried him through the factory and finally tossed him down onto a metal gurney, pinning Zach down with one hand while using the other to secure straps over him.
“Have you got a super huge scar?” Ned asked, almost spitting out his mouthful of cake as MJ slapped his head.
Sadly for his cock but fortunately for the public and his reputation (Such that it was) Pepper tapped him on the back, breaking the moment.
“TMI!” Peter cried jumping out of the car followed by Zach, the two had been cooped up for the last few hours and had a lot of energy to burn.
“Will Mr Stark be alright?” Peter asked, looking to Clint who was on Lily-watching duty, the little one was upset, grizzling and refusing to settle. She knew something was wrong and she wasn’t happy about it at all.
Thor frowned, “I do not have any jewels with me on Midgard. All jewels are in the treasury on Asgard.”
Pepper scoffed, “Please, I’d be banging arguing spouses heads together in ten minutes flat!” Tony snickered and looked around.
“Yes, on a school trip to Oscorp. Spiders that had been exposed to radiation broke out of their containment and bit him. He was very sick and on life support for some time afterwards. Then his enhancements began to present with his senses first, then his strength, healing, and as we later found out, his ability to stick to surfaces.”
Steve glared at Natasha and ignored Sam’s snorting laughter at his expense in favour of guiding Tony away from them, though he did make a rude gesture behind his back at the wolf whistle which was set their way.
“As soon as the news of his death was released I came here.” Maria said, “I knew this was where he’d go to and we contacted Agent 13 and had her start to search for the two of you.” She directed this to Tony and Steve, “Finding Agent Romanoff too was just luck.”
“Please try to remember you are in a public place gentlemen.” Pepper sighed, then , when Tony showed no signs of coming up for air she wrapping her fingers into his hair and tugged on it until he lifted his head up complaining about her scalping him. “Public forum Tony, save groping Captain America for the privacy of your bedroom.”
“Yes sir!” Steve chuckled, giving Clint a mock salute, while Tony put his wallet into his inside pocket,
At any other time Tony might have found it funny to have Steve making a reference to a sex toy, but right now his humour completely lost.
Tony flicked the letter, “You’re older self says we should.” A yawn struck him, “But not tonight, we’re both tired, I can’t leave the kids, not after today. We’ll go when we’ve rested.”
He couldn’t help but hear the womans screams, the sound of her body being violated, the grunts of the rapist, the smell of them. It all turned Peter’s stomach and for over a weeks he couldn’t face going back out onto the streets.
Steve, that was Steve. Tony tried to clear his throat, tried to speak but there was something choking him!
“No, no, no, Tony is fine.” Peter and Zach didn’t need to know about Tony’s fertility issues and he wasn’t actually ill in the getting sick life at risk sense, so there was no need to bother Peter with the news.
“Can you take Mr Stark’s armour back to the tower, please. He will not be requiring it anymore today.”
“Hmm, maybe a couple.” Steve said, “In fact….oh yeah, they are getting tugged there right now, argh, help me, my crotch is out of control, I can’t stop it from jumping your ass.”
“They’re fucking!” Wade yelled, his voice cutting Clint off, “Its celebration sex mixed with rescue sex, hell it’s like celebration sex and rescue sex had sex together, it is all the sexes at once!”
It was completely unfair, Zach had never been in trouble at school, not beyond the odd bit of mischief in class, he’d never been in fights or caused damage to the school property, but because he was enhanced some parents had decided to kick up a fuss about the possible threat he might pose to their children and the school had been forced to suspend Zach until after the investigation.
Clint was pale, walking stiffly and holding his side where he’d been shot. He should have been in a hospital bed but no one questioned his choice to be with the others.
“Stay laying down baby boy.” A straw was pushed between his lips and Peter sucked on it, drinking cold water eagerly. As he got his bearings he saw Tony and Steve at his bedside in a stark white room with too bright lights and a stench of disinfectant.
As Natasha packed up, Clint moved the chairs out of the way so Jarvis could come in and set up the camera and monitor screen, getting them to focus on Tony.
“You suck!” Harley snarked, “Breathe into your bag, you sound like Darth Vadar having an asthma attack!”
“I know the feeling.” Steve said, “I was worried when I was first enhanced, worried I wouldn’t be accepted, that I would just be seen as a science experiment, a tool for the army to use rather than a person.
“Copy that.” Steve said, with trembling hands he took one end of the stretcher while Thor took the other and with the greatest of care they carried Tony back up through the castle and out to the jet.
“It probably works through a kind of telepathy.” Bruce hypothesised, “Beings like Loki who are capable of magic, may be able to communicate with it in some way, although I’m not sure to what extent nor to what extent this object could actually be controlled by anyone.”
Tony shot a glare at his eldest son, Peter was becoming way too smart mouthed. Little brat was clearly spending too much time about bad influences, like Clint, Natasha, and himself.
Rhodey positioned his chair in front of the door, keeping out of the way but intending to be part of this never the less.
Rhodey wished he could say he was surprised, but he wasn’t, rape was a common form of torture used on prisoners, to humiliate, to show that they were at the mercy of their capturers, to emasculate and victimize them. It was done to Alpha and Beta POW, and Tony had been an Omega alone, surrounded by Alpha and Beta men for months, it would have been more of a surprise if he hadn’t been molested by them.
At first he stuck to just tackling petty criminals, muggers, petty thieves, and breaking up the odd fight between drunks, but gradually he began to face worse, or rather the criminals he met were worse.
Steve helped him out of shirt revealing livid bruising over the Omega’s ribs and several shallow but nasty cuts.
“Private phone call, Rugrat, and I asked for a tuna sandwich, I still don’t see a tuna sandwich anywhere.”
“How dare you?” He growled, rising to his feet and towering over Norman. The Businessman stepped back a pace and swallowed hard knowing that he was at a clear disadvantage against such an Alpha.
In those places people didn’t tend to order things that they actually enjoyed eating, they would order the most expensive items on the menu to show off the fact that they could, even if they hated what it was, they would eat it and make a show of doing so just to impress others.
“Of course.” Thor said as cheerful as ever, he made his way over to the pair and picked up a handful of pegs, “What do we do with these?”
With a great deal of effort he pushed himself up into a sitting position, having to spread his legs to accommodate his bump, learning as he did that he was catheterized, grunting, he reached down and pulled the tube from his body yelping in pain as it came out, another tube was inside his anus to collect waste from his bowel, which he also removed and on shaking, unsteady legs, he got to his feet and began to make his way to the door.
“I got a kick ass suit and was a few weeks away from making my favourite blueberry pancake!” Tony replied opening his arms as Zach bounded over and jumped up to sit on his lap. “Do you want to go to Super Stark’s school for super geniuses?” he asked the little boy.
“Nor will I be doing that.” Steve added, “What I will say is that I had my fair share of bullying when I was a kid. I was an easy target for such cowards. I was underweight, undersized, I had an array of health problems, and I was dirt poor as many were back in the depression.
Zach nodded, “I understand Miss.” He said brightly and then startled the teacher by hugging her, “I’m really glad to be back I’ve missed learning here so much!”
The stunned expression on Steve’s face would have made Tony laugh were he not so tired and keen to get out of the Tower and to his kids, “Sta…Tony, I can’t ask that of you.” Steve stammered.
It was a good thing that he was awake and alert when they got there as Zach’s reaction to seeing his big brother was launch himself up onto the bed and threw himself into Peter’s chest so hard that had Peter not been ready for it he would have probably hit his head on the headboard and suffered a concussion!
All three men turned and gazed in shock as a dishevelled James Buchanan Barnes approached them, he stopped three feet away from them, his shoulders hunched and a frightened look in his eyes as he shifted on his feet.
“Uh no.” Tony said, “Morgan Rogers is the name of a Geography teacher, Morgan Stark is the name of a Superhero, and you are already a superhero, aren’t you Poppet?” Tony kissed her head tenderly and Morgan huffed a contented breath.
“Why, are you jealous?” Deadpool exaggeratedly gasped and pressed his gloved hands to the sides of his masked face, “Am I in competition with Captain Amazing Ass-erica?”
After the Aristocats another Disney movie got put on, Basil of Baker Street, and Bucky found himself feeling content enough to become drowsy, and somewhere along the way as Basil was hunting down Rattigan’s secret lair he fell asleep among tired billionaires, super soldiers, and super heroes, leaving an Android to watch over them all as they slept.
“We’re not getting anymore weight on this bar and I’m no where near my limit yet.” Peter said setting the bar down and pursed his lips thoughtfully, “Lets got to Mamma’s garage.”
The three men turned and saw Wanda Maximoff standing at the bottom of the steps, flanked by Rogers and Natasha, all of them in uniform and armed. Rogers stepped forward and roared at Tony,
“Fri, I need help, that thing, the me that is there isn’t me. Confirm identity, Code 789A/Pepper#3591RD/17Omega.”
As with most of their training sessions it was done with a lot of laughter, cat calling, and antics. Tony and Sam ended up in a mid air battle with Sam just about vibrating from the amount of shocks that Tony fired at him and the armour was covered in paint from the amount of shots he took, they both made very exaggerated deaths, clutching at their chests and swooning on the ground as they bowed out.
“No,” Steve said, “That team is not my team, and at present I am grieving for my family and friends, I would not be fit to take up arms. I need time to process everything and work through my grief.” The reporters seemed impressed by the very mature decision Steve had made in regards to his fitness to act as an Avengers while coming to terms with his loss.
“That won’t happen.” Clint stated firmly, he stood up taller and pulled his shoulders back, “If I have to I’ll go rogue and kill any fucker that tries to take the kids.”
“Tony respond.” Steve cried, seeing the too still Iron Man suit on the ground, unmoving, and still not response over the coms. “Cover him!” He yelled, taking out Bots with greater swiftness.
“Yep, and lunch.” Peter said, getting his lunch box from the fridge. He wasn’t going to be subjected to the horrors of school dinners. Steve had prepared a ham and cheese sandwich for him, along with a banana, a cup cake which he’d baked the day before, and a bag of mini cheddars, which he got from the pantry. He also had a bottle of coke which he shoved into his bag.
“Please Sir, it’s a matter of life and death!” Ned added, “We have to speak to the Avengers right now!”
They all grieved for Tony together, cremating his body along with Sue’s and scattering their ashes to the winds.
They limited themselves to one a day, made it a sweet treat at the end of their day before going to bed. They didn’t sleep much. Their body didn’t need it and nightmares kept them awake too much. But there wasn’t much to do at night. They didn’t like going out into town, going to bars or whatever it was people did.
Steve hated that. Hated that this Tony felt that he somehow deserved to be punished for his past, for mistakes he had made. Yes, he had been a weapons manufacturer. So? How did people think that the Military got their weapons? How did they think that they got body armour, radios, and all the other equipment that they used? Most of it came from outside contractors like Tony, and while he was known for the weapons he had designed and sold to the US military, that was not all he had provided. Choppers, Air-craft carriers, Body Armour, Helmets, even medical equipment!
“Right.” Steve agreed. “I’ll keep that in mind.” He frowned when Peter shivered, the air was cool and now they weren’t running it was a lot more noticeable. “Let’s get the food and get back to the tower.” He said. “Want to race there?”
Finishing the last of the security updates, Tony rose from his seat, taking his cup to go and get a coffee, not trusting Dumm-E, Butterfingers, or YOU to get him one, he wanted to drink it, not use it to grease engine parts!
He sat Tony down on his bed and set about turning down the covers and then actually got down on his knees before Tony to take off his shoes for him. Tony flexed his toes as Steve stowed his shoes and began to look around for Tony’s pyjamas, finding a simple vest and a pair of sweat pants for him to change into so he’d be comfortable while he slept.
He shook his head, curling up in a loose foetal position. To Steve’s eye he looked fragile and vulnerable, and he wanted nothing more than to wrap himself about Tony and protect him from the world.
“Ooohh dibs on the big gun!” Clint exclaimed all but clapping his hands as he ran and leaped into the tank and took up control of the laser cannon that was mounted on the back of the jeep. “Now this is what Lasor Quest needs to be kickass!”
“Should I leave you two alone?” Tony drawled, while he gave his fingers to Lily to play with, hardly noticing when she put one in her mouth to suck on!
The lift pinged and Steve shook the thoughts from his head. He couldn’t risk walking into Tony’s office sporting a boner, he’d never hear the end of it.
Tony had been to Paris several times before in his life, but never with Steve Roger's at his side and some how the City of Love became new and far more romantic when he had Steve's hand in his, Steve's broad shoulders pressed against his own, Steve's smiling face looking at him across cafe tables as they ate pastries and drank coffee from mugs deep enough to swim in. Or Steve's lips over his own as fireworks had exploded over head as the year became 2014.
Matt had been to the Police and explained the situation, hanging over the evidence. The detective wanted to speak to Tony the following morning, to get his statement for the investigation.
“What? of course I want you to, are you tripping? Have you seen you? Only a blind, demented, moron wouldn’t want to have you court them.” Tony cried, “You are hot and you are thoughtful and kind and generous, your fashion sense is terrible but as you are from the dark ages I can make allowances for that,” He ignored Steve’s indignant “Hey” and kept on talking, “You taste in music is a bit, well you need way more heavy metal and rock ‘N’ Roll in there, but it’s okay I guess. You get on with the bots, and my kids adore you, even if you are a complete sucker for Zach’s puppy eyed looks and make him pancakes far too often. You are perfect.”
At once the suit became dead weight and Tony plummeted from the sky smashing down into the side of a sky scrapper, shattering brick work and continuing on his way down to the ground where he struck the pavement so hard that it dented and cracked.
“Tony you have to stay here.” Bruce said, as Natasha came in with a couple drinks in styrofoam cups.
The air was knocked out of Tony’s lungs and he groaned in pain, rolling onto his side as he wheezed and tried to get back onto his feet, but Wanda’s magic wrapped about him like red vipers, yanking his arms up over his head and locking them in place. It clamped onto his knees, keeping them on the ground, immobilizing him and leaving him at her mercy.
“Very well.” Jarvis said. “Surplus Kevlar in the storage bin in the right corner.” He lit up ceiling lights to direct Peter to the bin.
Since Tony's focus was solely on Peter, Pepper had taken charge in ordering a lawsuit against Oscorp for negligence resulting in severe injury, this was just the civil suit that Norman was facing from Tony's personal lawyer, a criminal investigation was also underway and while it was ongoing Oscorp Tower had to be vacated and all trading cease until the conclusion of the investigation.
Natasha, he gotten a beautiful floor length Green chiffon dress with emerald earrings and matching necklace.
Yawning he tugging his arms out from under the bed covers and fisted his eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them then promptly looked around at his bed companions.
Groaning Tony blinking open his eyes wincing as light assailed them, the face of someone he didn’t know loomed over him, a light flashed in his eyes and he saw a white coat, a Doctor.
“Is there any way to stop him talking, for like five minutes?” he asked, Dopinder, who had made himself at home on the corner suite sofa. He looked up from where he was stroking the soft fabric of the throw pillows and shook his head at the questions.
Beyond the odd cold, a few chest infections when he’d been teething, Zach had been remarkably healthy, then, without any warning his temperature spiked and began to complain of his muscles aching and feeling sick.
“Wanda Maximoff.” Steve growled, the darkest most hateful look Tony had ever seen spreading over his Alpha’s face, “That bitch got into your head, baby, she has that ability, she got to you while you were at the base, before he brother shot you.”
Sucking in his bottom lip, Tony ran both hands over his abdomen and yelped in fright as he felt something move under them, something inside of him.
“Zach!” Tony yelled in horror, struggling to his feet, this was his worst nightmare, his Son on a battle field.
Tony’s eyes widened and he looked to Steve, “Tell the others.” He said as Steve grabbed his wrist and dragged him to a grate in the floor, the both of them ignoring Zola as they scrambled down beneath the grate, Steve placing the shield over them both, his body laying over the top of Tony.
His body was preparing itself to conceive a litter, fluid was being gathered in his pelvis and breasts, his uterus lining was thickening, his sweat glands were all gearing up to produce the intoxicating pheromones that Omegas gave off when in heat.
“Don’t get cocky,” Steve said, “Thanos will bring an army with him, and have the use of several stones, we need to get the compound and get ready.”
While the Avengers might like to go and take their law into their own hands and deal with the pair themselves, they could not do so, not if they wanted to keep on operating freely. This had to be done within the confines of the law, and that meant no physical action being taken against the pair until they had absolute proof of their guilt and their being a danger to human lives.
“The next time we go on holiday I demand soundproof rooms.” Tony grumbled and burrowed down into his sleeping back, “And a proper bed, and a toilet, and a shower, and room service.”
“Thanks,” Tony said, getting to his feet, he waved off Steve saying he’d help bring the stuff in, telling him to concentrate on feeding Lily. As he headed down in the lift, he thought about the look of loss and grief on this new Steve’s face. The poor man had clearly lost everything. Tony didn’t know what had happened in his reality, but he could guess it was nothing good, the least he could do for this poor man was to offer him a home for himself and his daughter, their daughter.
“Just let it out sweetheart.” Steve soothed, rubbing Tony’s back and rocking him back and forth, “It’s okay, I’m not going anywhere, I’m right here, and I won’t be leaving you alone.”
“I can’t believe I got to play with Crappy Cap shiny dustbin lid!” Deadpool crowed as he bounced into the hotel room, “I am so jacking off to the memories of that tonight!” he threw himself full length onto the sofa with limbs sprawling every which way and grinning broadly beneath his mask.
Harry’s eyes darkened and his ire turned from Peter to MJ, “Don’t you call my Father that, you demented bitch.”
“If that happens I am blaming you.” Tony said, “Just as I am blaming you for my back ache, neck ache, and other aching body parts from sleeping on this crappy air mattress.”
Tony snorted having heard Natasha and Sam looked amused too, Steve shot them a half hearted glare, “Fine.” He agreed, “2pm.”
“I’m not going!” Zach said wrapping his arms around Tony and buried his head into Tony’s chest, “I’m not leaving you and they can’t make me!”
“Fuck!” Tony buried his face into the pillow but Zach kept on tugging at the duvet and shaking his shoulder, refusing to let Tony sleep again.
“Sure, he is an Avenger, practically the founding member of the Avengers.” Sam said, “Everybody thinks of Stark when the team is mentioned, he is always the first avenger that anyone thinks of.”
Deadpool had yet to respond, and Tony was cautious about contacting Spider-Man, he was a kid, but he was already putting himself out there fighting crime, so perhaps having a couple of mentors would not be a bad idea.
When he knocked on the door Tony’s tired sounding voice answered and Steve let himself in, pausing in the doorway, taken aback by Tony’s appearance.
Curien shrugged and winced, “I don’t know, but I could guess that a man as power hungry and hell bent on control would want to be more than a US General. He’d not be making this army and then give it away to be used by another.”
“Peppercorn, come here.” Tony said spreading his arms. Letting out a wet sniffle Pepper moved to the bed and let Tony hug her. “There you go my Pepperoni, its alright, you don’t need to cry.”
Tony was still half-asleep as he made his way down stairs to the kitchen. He vaguely recalled something bouncing of his head earlier but had gone back to sleep since then so he might have been dreaming.
The second view was that Tony had only taken Peter in as a publicity stunt and wasn’t raising him the same as Zach. That Peter was only given the bare minimum while Zach was spoiled because he was Tony’s real Son, where Peter was just the orphan that Tony had taken in.
It took several more minutes and work from above but eventually enough rubble had been shifted for Rhodey and Thor to get Steve and Tony safely out and set them down on the roadside where Hulk joined them with a bellow.
Bruce snickered at Tony’s impression of Gollum, “A fair comparison.” Jarvis allowed, “And from the readings we have taken, of the object and your MRI, CAT, PET and EEG scans, we can definitely see matching energy readings between the two.”
Bucky stared at Deadpool with the kind of astonishment one gives to the kind of people who leap off bridges for kicks and happen to survive. Deadpool however, having no self-preservation or a teaspoon of common sense shrieked like a pre-pubescent girl and made grabby hands at Bucky’s arm, “A metal masturbating hand! Oh my God that is so fucking cool, does it have different settings like vibrate and thrust?”
Peter was silently crying as he stepped up to the bed, Zach was sobbing into Steve’s chest as he carried him to where Tony lay, broken and hurting and looking more fragile than Steve could ever recall seeing.
“Shall we still be slumbering beneath the stars tonight and toasting more of the springy sugar objects?” Thor asked.
“Be careful you don’t get dragged out to sea on that.” Steve cautioned him, as Clint scrabbled around, trying to get sitting on the tire and he might have had more success had Sam not waded out to him and leaped on the other side sending Clint face down into the water with all the grace of a beached whale. Before Clint could take his revenge, as Sam got himself up and onto the tire, Peter, who’d been silently swimming nearby, went under the water, swam up under Sam and shoved the man off the tire, getting himself onto it.
Sam came into the common area, holding his hand up, palms facing them when he saw the armed repulsor, “I’m not gonna fight you guys,” he said, “I was just packing my shit up, I guess I’ll be heading back to DC.”
A bright hopeful smile crossed Tony’s face, “You wanna date me?” he asked and Steve would have been elated had it not been for the flash of red that shone in Tony’s eyes before retreating and the Billionaire winced and rubbed at his temple.
It was the first time in three long months that Steve and Tony had shared a bed, they hadn’t even slept in the same room together in that long, having been separated by Tony being in hospital and Steve in the hotel room.
Pepper made a disgusted noise in her throat and went on her way into Peter’s room, shutting the door behind her so at least Peter and Zach would be spared the sight of their parents acting like horny teenagers.
Was it too soon since his Tony’s death to consider finding love elsewhere? He knew that his Tony would have said no. They had talked about it during their relationship. Had both known the risks of being an Avengers and had wanted the other to find happiness elsewhere should the worst happen.
“So? Why should that be a reason not to dance? Why spend his life alone because one lost love?” Steve asked, frowning, “I know how much losing someone you love hurts, but, as cliché as it sounds, life goes on.”
Rogers let out a growl and clenched his fists. Things might have taken a turn for the worst, but Tony moved between them, placing a hand on Steve’s chest.
Steve grinned, “Not putting yourself under unnecessary stress isn’t the same as running away. We want you to be happy, to enjoy your education, and if you won’t be happy going back to Midtown then you can go elsewhere.”
When they came to the hospital to see Peter, MJ and Ned told Tony that Harry was being kept home from school to avoid the attention from the media and the other students. They both tried to apologize profusely for not realizing Peter had been missing until it was too late. Tony and Steve both assured them that this was not their fault and that they shouldn't blame themselves since it was the last thing Peter would have wanted.
“Oh, some crappy Motel,” Clint said dismissively, “We were kind of hoping that a super rich friend of ours might be willing to give us a spare bed or two, maybe a couch to crash on?”
In the end it took the signing of nearly a dozen forms for the Hospital to release Peter into Tony and Steve’s care and be satisfied they wouldn’t get sued if Peter’s health took a turn for the worse.
Having places they frequented would also help them get to know the regular people they met at certain times and it would be easier to spot an something out of the ordinary, or someone out of the ordinary.
Doable, he’d get lean mince and make his own burger patties and top them with reduced fat slices of cheese. Have air fried chips instead of deep fat fried, have halo top instead of ben and jerries, since the reduced fat version of B&J sucked.
“Always.” Tony said and snuggled right up to Steve, laying his head on the super soldiers chest. “Thanks for taking Pete out, it really helped calm him down and cheer him up.”
“I do, Agent Romanoff,” Fury said and for a moment he actually looked sympathetic at Tony, “We ran some blood work on you and something quite unexpected showed up.”
“You are worth something to Stark though, and that makes you worth something to me.” The man said then he grinned, “At least you’d better hope you are worth something to your whore of a mother, or you’ll die burning from the inside out.”
“We need a vacation.” Clint complained nursing his sprained ankle courtesy of Bulldozer who’d slammed into the perch he had been on and Sam hadn’t been able to get to him fast enough to stop him from hitting the ground.
The questions continued in this manner, with the reporters steering towards the more business like questions and keeping away from personal matters. They asked Pepper about SI and what impact this would have, they asked Rhodey how this would affect SI’s contracts with the military, and if War Machine would be stepping in as well as Vision and the Iron Legion.
Peter gulped as he felt eyes upon him and the whispering started again, he was about to try and hide behind Ned when MJ suddenly thumped the wall loudly with her fist,
Strucker considered this and nodded, "Do so, but only the bare minimum. They need to be able to defend themselves without the promise of protection, and what better way to learn quick relflexes than to have some blood drawn?
Snorting in amusement Steve fished a couple of coins from his pocket, “Why don’t you two go and get some snacks while me and your Mother talk in private?”
“I’ll take those suggestions under consideration.” Steve said kicking the last soldier out of his way and running into the building, he paused and looked back at Natasha who waved him on.
They made it down to the common room where everyone was standing around in shock when Tony’s legs went from under him and ended up back on the ground crying out that he needed to push.
Naturally some of the adults indulged in some kisses under the mistletoe, even Tony found himself standing under the mistletoe with Steve who at least tried to look like he hadn’t manoeuvred him beneath the plant, the kiss was more than worth it though even if it did attract a lot of cooing and cheering. Of course this turned to sighs and frowns when the younger children returned and began to demand that their parents get them tardis’s and daleks like Zach had!
Of course it wasn’t all gone even now. The water was dark red from the amount that had come from his hands and his sleeves where he hand immersed them into the water, yet there was still more on his body, still more on his face, his clothes, his throat.
“Have you got a hollow leg now or something?” MJ asked, seeing the amount Peter was eating. “Did you get worms while you were in the hospital, or did that spider infect you with a parasite that’s devouring your intestinal bacteria?”
