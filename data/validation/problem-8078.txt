Steve gave a small gasp when Tony's fingers brushed intentionally over the other man's nipples.
"Have you been
Steve’s booming laugh filled the small room, the sound causing his teammates to smile in return. After the mission where they lost Bucky, they thought they’d never hear that laugh again.
Steve sighed in agreement, then stood from where he was leaning on his desk. "He literally said that he'd accept any punishment we give him. What kid actually says that?"
"Unfortunately. But, because he's no longer on a secret base: he can call us!" the man announced, earning another loud cheer.
"Your best friend that you mentioned. He was in the army with you?" Sam asked.
Steve glared half-heartedly at his friend. "Because what kind of example would that set for my children?"
"You will tell me where he is or I will get you written up for insubordination," Steve spat.
"Fuck, babe," Tony panted. "I'm gonna add those to the sexy box," he teased, voice breathy in pleasure.
Steve looked at his husband, silent, then reached out and took the man's hand. "Thank you."
"God, yes," the man groaned.
"Are you gonna bring me back anything, Papa?"
"If you're hoping for a tender heart to heart moment you're gonna be seriously disappointed," Dean spat, moving to return to the rest of the family.
The teen only shrugged in response.
Dean stared at her for a moment. “I think I’d rather talk about the other things,” he muttered.
"And? I may be a genius, but two days Steve. Two days." Tony gestured for him to spell it out.
"What's this about Phil?" Steve asked as he, his husband Tony and Ex-CPS Agent Phil Coulson sat around an antique desk in his home office. "Did you hear anything about Loki?"
Dean shook his head frantically, feeling the tears fall down his cheeks. "No, no I–"
The parents glanced at each other silently, then Tony rested his elbows on the table, leaning towards Sam. "And? What do you think about that?"
"You okay?" Sam whispered as the brothers followed the other siblings to the table already ladened with food.
"Aye, you've reigned in your aggression marvellously. Dr. Sif always tells me to ask myself why I am angry and what can be done instead of violence to rectify the situation. I believe you've taken these words to heart, fierce Natasha," Thor congratulated his sister, loosening his hold on the girl. "And if you ever have need to ask questions about making love and do not wish to talk to our parents or your therapist, know I am always available!"
“Everything your dad owned is in there, you didn’t think he just threw everything away did you?” Bobby asked, ruffling Dean’s hair and walking away, towards a young blonde woman and her screaming two-year-old.
"Tony! You can't just throw money at your–"
Again, so sorry for the unexpected hiatus.....turns out going back to work after a pandemic is going to keep you busy...who knew, right?
about me? Huh? You wanna know all my secrets, Sammy?"
The parents looked around the room, observing their kids.
“Oh, now he gets shy! Never mind when he’s asking specific details about our sex life and rimming–”
Sam shrugged and opening his book, replied: “It’s just a plane, Dean, I don’t know what you’re so scared of.”
A couple hours later, the boys woke to a knock on their door and Tony telling them that French toast was waiting for them in the kitchen.
Steve smiled a little brighter. “Sounds good. Just let me know!”
“Thor is pagan and celebrates the yule, Tony is a self-proclaimed ‘futurist’ and doesn’t observe any religious holiday unless we create one specifically honouring him, and Bruce, Clint and Natasha are Catholic,” Steve explained, making his way through the room. “I’m Protestant but it’s close enough to Catholicism that I go to the kid’s Christmas mass.”
Both men were fighting back tears at what the teen revealed.
"I'm sorry, Tony." The apology came out in a whisper.
“Hush. I much look forward to the time when you are old enough to imbibe. Then, it shall be
“Stop it, Tony, I’m fine.” Dean waved the man away. “You don’t need to make such a big deal about this.”
Steve sat for hours beside his best friend's sleeping body, thankfully the man thought ahead and brought his sketch pad and pencils to occupy both his hands and his mind. He sighed as he looked at the completed drawing on the page. It was Bucky, but the Bucky from years ago, the Bucky that went down during that awful mission. A Bucky he didn't know if he'd ever truly see again.
Lifting his eyes from the screen, Bruce smiled slightly in return. "I love you too, Papa. See you when you come back."
After waiting until the feelings passed enough not to paralyze her, she raised an eyebrow in question, gesturing to the man's face.
But it is. Steve went back into
“I have no idea what he is, man. All I know is that it’s a good thing he’s on our side,” Dean chuckled.
The next time Bucky woke up, he heard Steve speaking again, but not to him.
"What's wrong?" Mr. Coulson asked once they'd left the room.
Enjoy!
"Yeah," the man echoed. "Play." He lead the two to a dingy room that had only a rusted sink and a bare mattress covered in filth and a lumpy bed sheet.
"Mommy," Clint cried harder.
"Steve and I took cooking classes in Paris for our fifth anniversary, well, not so much cooking classes as we had breakfast at a bistro and begged the chef until he taught us how to make it." The man set the plates in front of the boys along with the syrup. "Either way it's freaking delicious!"
This takes place on a summer day the same year that Sam and Dean get adopted.
. I don't want to know
"Are you going back to work right away?" Bruce asked, effectively changing the subject.
"I thought I was okay? That's what the doctor said." Sam asked, confused.
"The one without volume control is Thor, our eldest," Tony gestured to the mound of muscles beside them. Thor looked like a god. His muscles were bulging out of the tank top he was wearing and his blonde hair brushed his shoulders as he waved to the boys.
Tony didn’t even look ruffled at Dean’s comment; he just let out his own tired sigh. “Okay, I’ll go. I’m gonna clean up the mess, then I’ll leave you to sleep for a while.” It was then Dean noticed that he hadn’t been puking into a bucket earlier, but straight onto the hardwood floor–and Tony’s shoes.
"Do we really need to–"
That prompted the end of the session.
.” It had to be Dean’s writing. Loki still called him Mr. Stark, despite multiple reminders otherwise, and the others called him Dad. So Dean had made everyone supper. Awesome. Now Tony just had to make the lunches. Thor and Sam were undoubtedly in bed already.
"Fine! Fine, we'll call the fucking gang member and invite him into our home to corrupt our children and turn them all to drug addicts." Tony ignored the eye-roll the blonde gave him in preference to pout spread eagle on his king-sized bed with his gorgeous husband hovering above him. Realizing their position, the engineer smirked and ran a hand underneath Steve's shirt to cup the soldier's perfect pecs. "You know, since I was such a good boy–"
"Why have you called us?" Thor asked. Natasha raised an eyebrow in her own form of questioning.
"Yeah, Dean?" Sam whispered back.
that carries
“Yup! All we have to do is turn the key and see what happens!” the engineer smiled proudly as he tossed the keys to the boy. “Give it a shot.”
“Keep a good eye on him, Sam! We don’t want him getting any sicker,” Steve called over his shoulder as he pushed Tony out of the bedroom.
Tony was close to relapsing because of him–there was no way he would want Dean now. Forcing down his tears, the teen propped himself up until he could reach his backpack, which had been unceremoniously dumped beside his bed. After finding the paper with Bobby's number, he lay back down and tried to make the numbers stay still long enough to dial.
"That's it Dean. Deep breaths, you got it. You're doing so good sweetheart, keep breathing." Steve paused as Dean sat back against the couch once more. "How are you feeling, love?"
"Dean? Can we talk to you?" Fuck it's Steve.
"Your father didn't bring you on hunts because he knew it was too dangerous to bring a thirteen-year-old. It doesn't matter how skilled you are Dean, you should never have been put in that dangerous a situation and your dad was right to leave you behind."
Dean saw something hit the paper, and realized it was a tear. Putting down the paper and wiping his face, he looked up and saw Steve and Tony staring at him, silently asking if he was alright. Nodding to reassure them, Dean replaced the note in the envelope and ran his hands over the steering wheel.
Over the next hour they learnt that the two men had been together for close to thirteen years, married for nine and they met when Tony was hosting a benefit for veterans. Thor was the first child they adopted, followed by Bruce and then a few years later Clint and Natasha. Thor has a half brother in Scandinavia that was almost beaten to death by Thor's father/Loki's step father and Steve and Tony have been fighting to get him to the states to adopt him as well.
"My name is Bruce and I'm nineteen. I'm studying to be a biochemical engineer."
"Steve. If you don't bring them in, I'll be forced to get up and do it myself." Bucky stared down his friend until the other man relented and opened the door.
“Are you kidding me?” Tony asked as the two were cleaning up from breakfast one day. “That’s literally all it took was some exercise? Why the fuck is that all it took?”
"Dean," Mr. Coulson's voice was low, but the prompt was enough for the boy to pause and turn towards the man. "I know something else is going on. Now tell me. What's wrong?"
"Dean! Are you excited for your party tonight?"
“What’s your friend’s name?” the agent asked, unblinking.
Loki sighed. "So, if I burn this, Odin will finally leave me alone?"
The line fell quiet as Steve and Tony held a conversation with their eyes, both agreeing in the end.
SURPRISE!!! I know everyone was super excited to read the next chapter, so morrismsteph and I hashed out the next chapter early!!
The wound on his side–he never disinfected it.
Dean took a deep breath to gather himself and not straight up punch the other teen in the throat. “Look, do you want to get rid of the ghost of your abusive ex step-dad or not?” he spat.
Dean didn’t respond.
One finger made its way to three, Steve gasping and moaning the entire time, with Tony growling out encouragement. By the time Tony was fully seated in his husband, Steve was a complete wreck, clutching and clawing at the brunette's back, drawing his impossibly closer and letting more than a few tears escape, which Tony lapped up in time with his thrusting.
“Okay, what’s with the family meeting?” Dean asked, sprawled over an armchair in the living room. “Don’t tell me you’re adopting another kid.”
The boy shrugged and looked down at his feet. “After you told me about the supernatural, I just– there’s so much evil out in the world, Dean, I feel like I could drown in it. And when I think about how I could end up–”
Dean was still processing the revelation when Steve continued, his voice whisper-quiet as he promised, “
Tony reached out and grabbed his husband's hand. "Hey, he also has all of us," he whispered. "Right kids? We're gonna give Uncle Bucky all the support he needs, right?"
"I'm useful for stress relief! I know you have each other, but you can use me too! I've been told that I'm a great fuck! I can suck and everything! You don't want to give that up!" Dean tried to take control of the situation by leaning into the chair and letting his legs spread, showcasing his crotch.
Dean hesitated, then shook his head. "You can't fix this one, Mr. Coulson. Even with all of your connections and freaky knowledge of everything, you can't fix what I've fucked up."
"We do our best. That's all we can hope for"
The teen paused, before admitting the truth. “I was trying to get information about our father. Sam misses him, and I was hoping Bobby knew where he was.”
The men blinked at Dean for a moment, their hearts essentially breaking for the fourteen year old who had been through more than he definitely should have. Tony slowly, never taking his eyes off Dean, got out of bed and drew closer to him.
"Yours," Steve whispered back. "I want to be yours."
“Did you find out where he is?” Mr. Coulson inquired.
"Oh, Sam!" Steve stood quickly and raced around the table to meet his son in a passionate hug, the man holding back tears of joy.
“He told me that they found Bucky. He’s alive. They’ve asked me to lead the mission to get him out.”
“No you’re not, and yes you do.”
–" Tony began.
Dean shrugged again. "I don't know." He muttered.
"I understand what your saying and that's a conversation for another day Dean, but bottom line we don't want you bleeding at all if we can help it," Steve replied.
"Nope, you don't get to do that," Tony cut Steve off. "You don't get to apologize for your emotions. What you do get to do is whatever the hell you need to while I sit here talking to you. Got that?"
Sam smiled, not surprised in the slightest that the teen brushed off any trace of emotion with a joke. "Yeah, yeah all right."
"Whip," Bucky supplied. "Continue."
"Oh, love," Steve sighed. "I need you to know that you weren't bad, you just made a mistake. That's why Dad took away your phone, to help remind you to correct those mistakes in the future. We love you so much, sweetheart and we want you to be the best person you can be."

It wasn't until she was laughing at Clint pining Thor in a 'mock battle for the tv remote' that Natasha realized, she didn't see red.
"Of course. Just make sure you let me know if I go too fast okay, I don't want to lose you part way through. How about we go to the library after dinner?"
The boy nodded.
Thor’s face lit up in excitement at the question. “Traditionally we celebrate on the winter solstice, but as this country is so ingrained in its holidays, I’ve decided to move it to correspond accordingly. The burning of the fire represents the keeping of the light through the darkest of times, something that I believe we, in particular, should be accustomed with.”
Bruce had given the man a smile and reached out to hug the man quickly before redirecting his attention towards his plate.
He looked away from the woman, choosing instead to study his hands. They've become too soft. It's been too long since he's held a gun. Steve and Tony only took him to the range once before Steve left and Tony was too in over his head to take him again.
Tony calmly walked towards the veteran and took the offered hand. "Anthony Edward Stark, of Manhattan and this studmuffin's husband."
“What?” he asked, bewildered.
Instead of soothing the younger boy’s concerns, this revelation sent a spike of fear through him as he observed how peaceful Dean looked, despite the touch of their foster father.
She felt...good.
"Of course, Sammy. You know me! Nothing's gonna get me down!" Dean reassured his little brother.
"No. But it's going to be that much more worth it if he does," Steve whispered as he pulled his husband in for a hug.
"Shh, I'm enjoying myself," the blond whispered, letting a hand sneak in between his pants and briefs slightly before coming back up to touch his stomach some more.
breaths'. You're not here to talk to my little brother about me, period. You help
“Good. You and your brother deserve nothing less,” the man nodded. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper before offering it to Dean. “Your dad’s storage locker. I already went through and removed anything incriminating or dangerous so you can bring Sam and your foster dads to go through his stuff.”
Tony nodded vigorously. “Do not be afraid to tell us when you’re hurt, Dean. Self-medicating is dangerous and can cause even more problems, if it doesn’t kill you straight out.”
Mostly a filler tbh, but enjoy the pre-Christmas chapter in August!
Tony hums in agreement. "And Loki?"
"Yeah, if you can. I'll catch a cab from there." Dean climbed into the man's truck, wincing at the pain in his side.
"I think I like Steve and Tony more than Dad," the boy admitted quietly. "Does that make me a bad son?"
"We know what was going through his head Steve! Or rather what was going through his other head-"
Steve chuckled and hugged him from behind. “It’s not like he’s one hundred percent better, he still has trauma in his past that one sparring session doesn’t even attempt to fix. Don’t forget we’re still waiting on that specialist Phil sent for to come in to talk to him.”
Steve sighed and fell into a chair opposite his husband. "He's been waiting for us to hit him. Hasn't he? This entire time."
Dean blinked in shock. "Excuse me?"
Dean nodded and opened the car door. He started to climb out but stopped when he got caught in the seatbelt. The teen stared at the strap in confusion, like he couldn't quite remember what it was.
You're welcome! The day everyone's been waiting for!!
“Well that’s okay,” Steve smiled. “At my mother’s funeral it was just me, the priest and my best friend Bucky, and it was the best send off we could’ve given her.”
"That's exactly it, my darling. You just need to learn in a different way, and then smart is what you choose to do with the knowledge after that, and you, Clint Stark, are so incredibly smart. Please believe that." Steve took a moment to look over his son, then squeezed Bucky's hand once more before standing up. "I'm heading home right now, sweetheart, and when I get there, you and I are gonna have the biggest hug, and then how about we watch a movie in your bed, huh? I'll even let you have some popcorn if you promise to clean the sheets."
Searching Steve's eyes, the engineer smiled. "You want us to go slow, hun? Want me to take my time?" The man's once wandering hands softened, and made their way to rest on top of Steve's chest.
“Dean, you look like death, and you’re burning up.” Steve was using his ‘dad’ voice with those stupid, big blue eyes that held a hint of
"Only seven, Falsworth, you know that," Steve laughed.
Dean shook his head. "Just felt like I was dying."
Steve rolled his eyes and groaned.
The two were silent for a moment before Bucky started chuckling lightly. "Why Stevie, you dog! Didn't know dicks did it for ya!"
, the onlookers concluded, and either one might’ve been correct, though they’d have been horrified to learn what the other was envisioning. Dean was opening and closing his hand, in search of the safety of Steve’s warmth, and was becoming increasingly agitated as his grip remained painfully empty.
“And?” Bruce pushed.
Steve began to explain the famous quote to the boy with interjections from the man on his lap when Dean felt his phone buzz. Pulling it out, he found a text from Natasha.
“I–” Dean started. The others waited in silence. “I guess I do.” he relented, hanging his head once more.
"Tony!"
“Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!” Tony knocked loudly on the door to the boys’ room. “Sam, you better come downstairs for breakfast if you want to make it to school on time!”
Dean nodded and gave a rare genuine smile to the man. "You know me. Anything threatens Sammy, I won't hesitate."
"Oh? Do you want us to call Dr Sif?" Tony asked, already reaching for his phone.
And with that the atmosphere in the room shifted. Determined not to distress the brothers, Steve swiftly changed the subject. "And this one trying to rudely ignore us over there is Clint. Clint, come over and meet Sam and Dean!" Steve called out to the boy in front of the television.
Once again a huge thank you to my beta morrismsteph!!
The man was now standing in front of the boy once more, and slowly reached up to run the back of his hand down Loki's cheek.
Tony grumbled in response. Standing up, the man took his husbands offered arm. "Bloody optimist"
Sam smiled brightly at his foster parents. "Then I'm gonna give him all the support he needs when he comes back!"
The engineer took a moment to compose himself. "Bud. Steve and I have been fighting to bring you here for four years. Does that sound like we're pretending to care?"
"Yes, Dean, he does," Dr. Mills interrupted. "You are his only constant in life and his only stable relationship.
. We talked about this."
Dean once more pulled the covers up and settled down to enjoy the easy quiet.
Your dad would be proud of you.
Steve sighed and put down his cutlery to give the boy his full attention. "The place I'm going is really top secret, and that means no communication via technology. So I won't be able to call, but I'll still write you guys as much as I can," he promised, giving his son a sad smile.
This was a BEAST to edit and morrismsteph is a goddess!
“Well, when you put it like that, we absolutely do!” Falsworth exclaimed, attempting to reach for the letter still folded on the table.
Steve coughed as he inhaled the dust that was kicked into the air upon lifting the door of the storage unit. If Bobby hadn’t said he’d went through everything already, Dean would’ve assumed the place hadn’t been stepped in for years.
"I'm afraid this rule is one of the most important Dean. If you have a weapon, you're a danger to everyone in this house, and we won't stand for that-" Steve argued.
"Play?" Natasha repeated, struggling to hold onto the squirming three-year-old.
Dean nodded, then flung himself into Steve's arms. The teen melted as Steve wrapped his arms around him and cradled Dean's head to the man's shoulder.
Happy Posting Day!! And a very Happy Thanksgiving to all my fellow Canadians!
“Yes, really,” Steve replied. “We already have a date booked this weekend. Is that alright with you?”
"Bullshit!"
"Mornin' boys!" Tony called out from behind his tablet. The man was sitting next to a coffee machine in the kitchen as Sam and Dean made their way down the stairs.
As the three reached the door, it swung open, revealing a thin, balding man in a smart blue suit.
Dean laughed once, hard. "Yeah, okay."
Sam thought for a second. "Papa came home?"
The room was filled with cheers at the news, all wondering when the man was going to return home once more.
“Dad keeps me calm; we talk about physics. Papa gives the best hugs,” Bruce mumbled.
"Because—" Dean sighed and threw himself backwards on the bed. "Because there are things that I just can't talk about with you, Sammy. You're my brother and there are things that I don't want you to know. It's—it's not because of anything you did, or that I don't trust you or—"
“Thor, the police asked me if Dad or Papa ever touched me inappropriately! I think we need to know!” Clint’s voice was getting louder, the stress of the situation finally affecting the young boy, to which Thor gave a small smile.
Fighting gravity, Bucky slowly opened his eyes bit by bit, waiting until the room cleared up enough to actually see. It was a bland room, a simple generic painting across from the bed with the curtains drawn and the lights off.
“But mainly for presents,” the thirteen-year-old finished cheekily.
Dean nodded. "Hey, where did Tony go?"
The two sat in silence once more.
"Yes. Other than that." The man's voice was even and steady, refusing to rise to the teen's bait.
“Dean,” Steve tried again, pausing to kiss the teen’s hair. “Know that there’s absolutely no need to thank us for anything we do, especially for loving you and Sam. Know, that for as long as there’s life in my lungs, I will love you with every breath I take. But you’re welcome all the same.”
That must have been what Mr Coulson was talking about 'everything you'll need to be safe is already in place'.
Steve instantly missed the physical contact–the sharp sting of its loss made him yearn to regain the sense of intimacy.
“He saved me a few years back, my husband and child got turned into zombies. Not fun.” She looked Dean straight in the eye as she told him.
Sighing, Tony flopped on the huge bed and ran his hands over his face. "I know. I'm sorry. Just because
"If we were to invite you to our home to celebrate Dean's birthday, would you bring any drugs, alcohol or violence with you?" the soldier finished.
"You and Dr. Mills think I'm a mental case, don't you?"
“‘What gives’ as you so eloquently put it, is that I’m not sure I trust you in the first place, why would I trust you with this?” Loki responded, leaning up against the door frame and crossing his arms.
“Well? Don’t keep us in suspense, what did the guy say?” Morita nudged the captain with his foot under the table. “We haven’t been on leave for a while, let us live vicariously through your boring marital sex life.”
"But you were in the army. Why don't you have your kids do drills?" The boy questioned.
Tony takes a moment to think, then sighs. "It's a nice thought, but I think we should talk to them individually first. Maybe if we get Loki to stop aggravating Dean on purpose we can eventually make them talk in a civil way. Plus, I really want to focus on Dean relinquishing his caregiver role on Sam and Clint."
Another huge thank you to my bet t00thless!! Enjoy, and I hope all of you are staying safe this Easter weekend!
Tony on the other hand was studying Dean. His face was unreadable as he looked the teen in the eye for a long moment, before joining the conversation.
“Better,” he replied shortly.
The engineer greeted him back with a huge smile of his own. "Yeah?" he asked, just make sure.
"Who are you?" Natasha asked, jumping back. A tall man with an unbuttoned shirt loomed in the doorway, staring at the kids and making the girl's skin crawl with an unknown feeling.
"Fuck yeah, it does." Quickly, Tony bent over and swallowed the member whole, almost choking when Steve bucked the tiniest amount before regaining control.
"So, I'm guessing this is the husband?" A man in a stupid bowler hat and heavyset mustache asked, eyes crinkling in a smile.
"That doesn't–"
"Tony. What do we do?"
The boy ignored her and continued crying, throwing the block as well. Sighing, Natasha sat on the ground next to her brother. "Come on, Clint, she's coming back, you know she is. She comes back every day."
Another huge thank you to my beta Apollos_Meatballs for all their help! (You can basically thank them for the entire last scene in this chapter ;) )
“I, for one, would not ask me how I got over my parents' death,” Tony piped up. “Way too illegal and way too dangerous.”
"Natasha, sister, you need to breathe!" Thor coached his younger sister as she brutally attacked a punching bag in the gym.
Tony scoffed. “Not when it comes to drugs or alcohol.”
"Well, I do! And I can get rid of him too!" Dean beamed, finally letting go of Loki's hand.
"Where are your parents?" the officer tried again.
The blond got up and sat directly across from the other teen. "I thought we talked about this, about you actually making an effort."
Dean blinked in surprise.
“Yeah, looks like someone robbed the north pole in here,” he teased his brother as he removed his outerwear.
"Yeah, yeah, we can do that," Tony responds immediately. "What do you wanna talk about first?"
didn't know..."
The teen stiffened but nodded slowly. The hug wasn't nearly as warm as the other kids' and Steve mourned the opportunity to grow their relationship, instead of putting it on hold.
Dean smiled and winked and Steve. "Speaking of ass-" fuckfuckfuckfuck
Dean grunted in agreement, though he made no move to accept the food.
Every time the two had been in this situation before, Dean nodded silently and watched Mr. Wilson rage and pace, all the while cursing those that dared to hurt a child. Now, though, the man simply slumped in his chair, crushed and close to tears. The teen stared in astonishment as one of Steve’s old subordinates planned the prosecution of the country’s beloved Captain Rogers–his own commanding officer, no less–and the man’s genius, billionaire, (former) playboy, philanthropist husband, the famed Tony Stark.
"No," Dean looked up, confused. "That's what we do for each other. I'd do the same thing for Bruce, Nat, and Thor."
The men froze when they heard Dean's voice from behind the garage door. "Sorry, darling," Steve called out and opened the door to find the brother's arms full of boxes.
Steve gave him a small smile in return.
"But if that's not the case, then why?" Steve asked.
With a discouraged sigh, Steve sent the boy off with a cheerful "Have a good day," and Dean ran off towards the front door.
to the man holding his son and letting him fall apart in his arms. With a stiff nod, Phil acknowledged the soldier and continued his soft reassurance to the teen, watching as Steve observed for a moment longer, then left, giving the two the privacy they needed.
He finally got his friend back. He finally got his
“Tsk. Tony!” Steve reprimanded the man, rubbing the teen’s back as he regained his breathing.
Bracing herself, the girl closed the file, crossed her arms and nodded once. She was scared, but she didn't matter. Staying with Clint did.
The teen paused, genuinely trying to think of a good response, but came up with nothing.
“We’ll take you to a doctor any time you need us to, Dean,” Steve promised. “We have money to spare, but we can’t buy another one of you.”
"But why?" Loki spat out, turning abruptly and throwing the hand off of him.
“Thanks for the soup, Sam! It was delicious!” the soldier heard as he crossed the threshold. “Can you bring the bowl downstairs for me? I’m afraid I’m still on bed rest, according to Captain Muscles over there.”
The teens regarded each other in silence.
"But he said Mommy didn't want us anymore," Clint said, grasping his sister's hand tightly.
Steve shook his head and shot a glance to his husband. "Bottom line. Those are unfortunately quite common, and one of the reasons Tony and I go to therapy, to learn how to avoid and control them."
Steve racks his brain. "What does his therapist say?"
Sam gave a small smile and a nod before sniffling and dropping his gaze to his hands.
Dean smiled and took the offered hand. "Only if you go in first."
Dean simply stared at the man. “Yes.”
Then Dean remembered the emergency phone that would connect him to Mr. Coulson. It was sitting in his desk drawer. But no. This wasn't an emergency, and there was no guarantee that the man even knew Bobby.
"What?" Dean lifted his head to look at the shadowy form of the ten-year-old. "Why not? You're already calling them–"
(Also, can we just agree not to talk about that series finale? Good.)
The question threw Dean. “Um. I-I don’t- I mean-“
"How'd you get so smart?" Steve pondered sarcastically, wrapping his arms around the smaller man, giving him a true kiss this time.
He was still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but man the wait was sweet! He had a cell phone, two private pools, a gaming system, three meals a day and the heat hadn't gone out once. Hell, if Steve and Tony did start hitting him soon he wouldn't even mind.
Steve gasped suddenly in realization.“Oh, God! Tony, we could lose Loki! They’re not gonna give a severely traumatized child to suspected child abusers! We promised him a family!” Steve started sobbing even harder, too distressed to listen to his husband’s words.
"No!" The parents almost shouted in an attempt to calm the boy.
As the brothers pulled on their new (expensive, holy fuck) suits, Sam prattled on about what the church service would be like.
"What the fuck." Tony collapsed on the settee at the end of the bed, running a hand down his face. "What the actual fuck."
They were torn apart by a voice calling out for Steve, making the taller man sigh and finally let go of the embrace. A group of men in their army best saddled up to the two.
I never apologized after attacking you a couple weeks ago.
The entire room jumped when Bucky barked out a loud laugh. "Taking after your Papa, are you? I remember pulling him outta his fair share of back-alley fights for 'the greater good'. He could take you on a tour of all the alleys he's been punched in."
"Really? You would teach me things you're learning in university?!" He gaped at the older boy. Bruce chuckled at Sam's enthusiasm.
"And Thor, how was football practice?" Tony asked the buff blond.
Slowly and methodically, Tony undressed his husband, laying everything flat on the settee and kissing every inch of skin he uncovered. Steve's sobbing slowed and eventually, only occasional tears and sniffs permeated the atmosphere.
“I know,” Tony cut the man off. “The last time you were in active duty. The haunting in your eyes is back, just a little bit, but it’s there. Steve,” he stopped and hurriedly tried to blink back more tears from falling. “I don’t want you to start having those nightmares again... the screaming...it broke my heart when we were dating, but now…”
"Do they want to adopt you too?" he asked in response.
“Dean,” Steve looked the boy straight in the eye. “Do you have a good reason for not telling us where you got the codeine?”
"Because I wish someone had offered me the same damn thing a year ago."
“There was nothing protecting her. There's no higher power, there's no God. I mean, there's just chaos, and violence, and random unpredictable evil that ... that comes out of nowhere and rips you to shreds. You want me to believe in this stuff? I'm going to need to see some hard proof. You got any?” he searched Sam’s face, daring the boy to contradict him.
"Steve. We'd be putting people in this house at risk. I know you have a bleeding heart, but love," Tony reached out to his husband. "Do you really think this is the best idea? What about Nat? How do you think she's gonna feel about more men in the house? She just starting to be comfortable talking again and this could set her back. Or Clint! He was abused too and with Deans track record who knows how he'll react."
“Heya Sam. You get any taller and you’re gonna give your old father a run for his money,” Bobby stated, messing the young boys’ hair.
"If you are not in me in the next two seconds I will get out the dildos, I swear to god," Tony swore, nipping Steve's lips.
Dean's face went blank, then dark as he processed the words. "Are they planning anything? Should I cut their dicks off?"
"This is Tony and Steve Stark, Sam and Dean's foster parents," Tony answered quickly, not wanting the man to hang up again. "We met at John's funeral, I believe."
"All right," the blond sighed. "Malnutrition, surgery for the misaligned healed fractures, stitches on your back from the..."
“Look at you, being all responsible,” Clint chimed in. “Obviously, he didn’t see you on your twenty-first birthday, breaking beer mugs and shouting, ‘Another!’ until Papa had to carry you to bed,” the newly thirteen-year-old teased.
“Oh, hun,” Tony sighed when he saw the captain. The man’s hair was wild with all the times he’d run his hands through them and his eyes puffy from the tears he kept trying to keep down but failed. “Darling, I think maybe it’s time to come home for today.”
The boxes of John's things had been stored in one of the many guest bedrooms until the brothers could decide what to do with them. This didn't stop the boys from thinking about the sentimental objects, though. Both laying in bed after bringing everything home, Sam and Dean were quiet. They knew the other was awake, but they lamented in the silence and just revealed in the dark about everything they'd learned.
Dean watched as six hands raised into the air, giving Sam a look of betrayal that was met with a shrug.
Dean shook his head and Sammy called "Nope!" from his desk, already engrossed with the new technology.
Dean froze.
"Do you want us to hit you?" Steve looked as though the words left without his permission as he looked at Dean.
Dean sat up abruptly.
"Come on, Dean, spit it out!" Sam goaded. Neither had moved to face the other, Sam staring at the ceiling and Dean with his face pressed into his pillow.
"Boundaries?"
Only a couple more chapters left!!
Steve smiled and took the hand. "Always so dramatic," he playfully answered. "Thor, why don't you take the boys' bags for them, I'm sure they're tired from the trip over here."
“So Phil-“
"No. No weapons." The soldiers gaze was piercing under the scrutiny.
Steve chuckled. "Apparently. So what's the real reason you took his phone?"
“Yeah, I know you are.” Sam gave a small smile. “But you’re just one person, Dean. And I need to think that there’s somethin’ else watchin’ too, ya know? Some… higher power.” the boy shrugged. “Some greater good.”
"Then I think it would be a good idea to talk to him before he brings anything up," Jody continued. "Maybe tonight, before you go to bed, just pull him aside and say that you need to establish some boundaries and when you tell him to stop asking about something that you really do need him to back off. Tell him that the reason isn't that you don't trust him, or because of anything he's done, but just because you, personally aren't ready to talk about it. Maybe if he knows it's a possibility, he won't be as persistent."
"Huh," Dean muttered to himself, then followed his brother.
Fucking Coulson.
"Please, Steve, please, I need you," he whimpered. With one more nip and a soothing lick, Steve kissed Tony's slack mouth and reached for the lube in the nightstand and sat back between the man's legs.
He shrugged. "I mean, I'd never even seen a dad tell their son they love them before coming to Steve and Tony. Didn't know it was a thing. Maybe if
“What? What do you mean?”
Dean snapped his eyes up to the lady. A Dr. Mills. Tony said she was recommended for him and Sam by-
Dean on the other hand did. He reached out and shoved Sam behind him, waiting for the back hand.
"Hey bud! Whatcha workin on?" Steve sat beside Sam in the library, noticing the books piled around him.
"They're brothers." Phil explained. "Dean is fourteen, Sam is ten. Said their dad went on a business trip and hadn't been home in a few days. That was a year and a half ago."
“Let me?” he asked quietly.
"Dean do you read?" Asked Tony, setting down his phone for the first time since dinner started.
All he got in response was a groan and a pinched face.
“Oi, Cap, what’s ya got there? Racy pictures of the ball and chain?” Morita called out from across the table.
Natasha thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"Shh," Tony interrupted, "doesn't matter right now, honeybunch, just lay down for me, sugarplum."
The seventeen-year-old furled her eyebrows in thought for a moment, before pulling out her phone and shooting Tony a text.
Tony finally joined the two, alerted by the commotion.
"We're not going to hurt Sam. Ever." Steve carefully explained. "And neither will we ever hurt you." Dean snorted as he sat up.
"But we would prefer if you actually tried to sleep." Steve interjected.
if it meant making you smile, just once. You, Steve Stark, are the love of my life, and I couldn't be prouder to call you my husband."
“I want my parents!”
"I'm gonna call him right now!" Clint decided, taking out his phone and video calling his father.
Tony scoffed. "Like ten cents. I made them a couple days ago when we first found out you were coming."
After taking the paper and reading the address, Dean looked up in confusion. “Storage locker?”
"My dad said he drank to forget the people he lost. So that means you drink too, right?" Sam stared at his hands, somehow looking even smaller.
"Go to your room and do not leave until Tony or I say so." Steve called out.
"How can we help him if he's scared of us!" The engineer threw his hands up in frustration. Steve walked behind the man and wrapped his arms around his middle.
“Yet you had no problem with bringing in codeine!” Tony sassed the teen.
Steve raised an eyebrow at his husband, receiving a "we'll talk later" look from the man before he thanked Dean genuinely.
The younger teen slowly pushed the door open and stuck his head inside.
“Great job, Dean!” Tony praised the teen as he watched Dean put the final touches on the Rolls Royce.
This chapter is only half edited, but the posting schedule remains!!
Steve shook his head. “No, that’s not important right now, I-”
"Bucky!" Steve laughed, looking as carefree as he did before that fateful FUBAR mission all those years ago.
Dean wracked his brain, frantically coming up with scenarios but shooting them down because
"What? We don't have a daddy," Natasha stated, confused.
"These are for you. Both are programmed with the family's numbers as well as Mr Wilson's and Mr Coulson's numbers. If there are any other numbers you'd like to add go right ahead." Tony explained, passing over the phones.
He looked waveringly at the other man, not sure of his thoughts.
"I have some exciting news, everyone!" Tony announced when everyone filed into the kitchen for breakfast. "Papa saved Uncle Bucky yesterday!"
"So, you did nothing wrong, huh?"
There was a knock at the door.
“You protected him. Not just from your abusers, but from the dangerous environment you grew up in. You shielded him from the horrors of the world, the despicable things that people are capable of. Mr. Wilson told us about how you told Sam your foster parents were vampires, and how
"Papa?"
“A comfortable suit. Tony and I are going to take you to get one sometime this week,” Steve answered.
“I know,” she interrupted, not even wanting to hear the words out loud.
“This is really good, Sammy! Might even be better than mine!” Dean winked.
"Steve?" Sam called out hesitantly, breaking the man's trance.
Surprise! I'm still here! Now that I've finished moving, hopefully, I'll have more time and energy into these wonderful characters and their stories!
I'M BACK!!!!!
“Actually, it would be a huge help if you could get Tony for me. Then you can help Thor and Nat start dinner, okay?” Steve didn’t want the boy sitting beside his sick brother with nothing better to do than worry, so giving him an idle task was in Sam’s best interest. The boy nodded quickly before fleeing from the room.
“He’s… as well as can be imagined,” Steve replied hesitantly. The POW in question still refused to wake up for any longer than a couple of minutes, and most of those times he still believed he was back at the prison camp.
Steve and Tony brought over huge stacks of crepes, immediately drawing the attention of the siblings.
“All I know is that it wasn’t Dad or Papa,” Nat growled through clenched teeth. After a moment, she hung her head and admitted, “It might’ve been me though. What if I bruised his ribs when I took him down the other day, and they think the injury is from them?” In an uncharacteristic show of vulnerability, the girl looked worried and ashamed at her possible guilt.
"...Rude."
"Come in."
“Okay, then. Next on the agenda: where did you get the codeine from?”
"Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good," Dean nodded. "How about… um… what about 'pudding'?"
The other man just smiled and pushed his pants down another inch, just enough to get access to his balls. With one hand on his balls and the other on his nipple, Steve alternated between gasping and moaning while Tony clutched the sheets in desperation.
Seeing the boy hesitate, Mr. Wilson continued. "We're just trying to make sure the two of you are safe. Is that so bad? I just want to ask you a couple of questions. If everything checks out I'll drive you back to your room myself."
“Bullshit? Aren’t you supposed to be a child therapist? How would the parents react if they knew you were so crass? Or are you just being naughty for me?”
“Dean! How are you feeling sweetheart?” Steve stood and embraced the teen, not deterred at all when Dean stiffened before melting into the hug.
“Well, I am sick. But don’t worry, little brother. Between those two hovering Care Bears out there, I’ll be fine,” he placated, not even bothering to meet Sam’s eye.
The kitchen fell silent.
"How ya doin?" he padded over softly and sat beside the lump of blankets on his brother's bed.
The teen eyed the man. Planning his next move very carefully.
Sam examined his older brother, searching for any signs of distress.
"Fuckin prude. You'd think with a body like that he'd just never wear clothes so anyone could just use him whenever they wanted." Dean spat.
"No! You don't get to tell me to sit down and 'take some deep
, John’s voice immediately echoed in the teen’s head.
Dean's heart hurt, watching his little brother in pain. "Yeah, Sammy. Of course." He switched off the light then got into his own bed. "I'm sure dad's gonna come for us any day now," he spoke to the dark room.
I’m surprised you were awake for as long as you were!” Tony placed a hand on Dean’s forehead and sighed when he felt the heat. “You’re still burning up; your body knows it was too much.” Tony started shifting to sit next to Dean, wanting to wrap an arm around his sick boy. “Seriously, Dean! That was so incredibly stupid! You could’ve–”
Tony gave Dean a small smile. “No, I didn’t. My sponsor held me back until Steve got home and took the bottle from me. I’m still sober and going strong, Dean.”
As always, HUGE thank you to my wonderful beta morrismsteph!!!!
"'Tasha?"
"But it did have something to do with the gang," Steve interjected.
“Then how come you and Dad are married? Don’t they hate gays?”
Thank you to my wonderful beta Apollos_Meatballs!!
"Apparently ours does." The engineer groaned and leaned back in his chair. "We should be elated right now, but I'm just-I'm just fucking confused, Steve."
Steve smiled and ruffled the boy's hair. "It wasn't a treasure hunt, darling. You know we went to that storage locker."
Dean furled his eyebrows in confusion. “I’m not going to, I promise. But–why–”
"Since the day Tony told me he was quitting, I haven't had any alcohol either. You never have to worry about us drinking Sam." Steve added.
"You love him don't you?" Tony asked.
Thor nodded vigorously.
"Besides," the brunette continued, "there were only men in that camp, I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say I enjoyed a good BJ from a dude."
Bucky waited for the teen to continue. "And a fun fact? In any clubs or have any hobbies?"
The men smiled at Sam. "That's awesome buddy." Steve told him. "I'm sure he'll really appreciate that."
"Hey, studmuffin," Tony's voice rang through the speaker. "What's going on?"
Tony moved to get up and clean them off, but Steve only tightened his hold on the man.
This scene was a request, so if you have any ideas you want to bring to life in this universe please comment them sown below!
“Shh, I gotcha sweetheart, I got ya.” Dean bent down and kissed Becky Walters, a cheerleader a grade older than him. He knew she was loose and that’s why he went for her. Returning his attention to the girl, he rubbed her back through her shirt and slowly moved it down to the cleft of her ass, kissing her thoroughly all the while.
Sobering up, Bucky reached for his friend's hand and squeezed at tightly as he could. "Stevie. You are my best friend in the entire world. I have waited for you to rescue me for over a decade. I really don't care who you love, as long as you're happy."
"You? Go for therapy?" The words were out of Deans mouth before he could stop them.
"That's it, love, let it out, I'm right here," the genius muttered, pulling the man in for a proper hug. "What do you need from me, sweetheart? Anything at all. You just wanna stay here and not move till morning? We can do that. You want me to hold you in bed so you can cry yourself to sleep? We can do that too. Just say the word, darling."
"You're grounded." Steve started driving again, ignoring Dean.
Pain on his lower left arm: bruise from where the hunter saved his neck and pulled him out of the way; no treatment required.
The two stayed in silence for a long moment, both not knowing what to say.
The boy perked up as he explained about what he learnt today in school. They were learning about the different bones and muscles of the body right now and he loved how you had a cheat sheet with you at all the tests because you could just look at the muscles on your body!
because my foster sons are connected to a potentially dangerous man, my husband is withholding sex from me until we finish this assinine conversation and you are having a fucking drink when I would kill for a shot of vodka." Steve shot Tony a worried look, rubbing the man's back in comfort.
"Clint. What is that?" she asked, forcibly calm.
"It's short for bull shit Sammy." Dean explained before digging into his potatoes.
Tony bent down to kneel in front of Dean and look him in the eye. "Dean, what did you take?"
"I already did, bud. But the military doesn't trust me since I stopped giving them weapons of mass destruction, so they've banned Papa from bringing anything electronic on the off chance it could be used for contacting, oh I don't know, his husband and kids," Tony grumbled, stabbing his broccoli with more force than necessary.
"Yeah, Clint. They did," she responded, petting his hair. "Did they hurt you?"
"But he doesn't
"If we're calling your father, we are all getting the chance to see him," Tony explained fiddling with the phone until the image appeared on the big screen in the corner of the kitchen. The family gathered in front of the television while Tony propped the camera of the phone so Steve could see everyone as well.
"Oh! God, Tony, the kids!" Steve exclaimed suddenly. "Guys, it's been absolutely wonderful seeing you all again, and I'd love for you to come to dinner at our house, but I haven't seen my kids in almost three months."
Tony remained quiet, waiting for him to continue.
“Steve, I need us to pause for a moment and take a breath,” the brunet interrupted. “I can see that you’re panicking and I think it would be best if we deescalated this situation before we continue.”
Tony took a big breath and held it for a moment, before letting it out and dropping his arms. “Can I help you back up?” he asked, innocently enough.
Dean shrugged. “A couple times a year. The last time I was there, he taught me how to throw a baseball,” the teen revealed, giving a small smile.
"Why don't you wait for us down stairs and we'll talk for a little bit. Sound good?"
"I know." Steve got quiet. "They're just such good kids."
“Go on,” Dean urged the boy. “Maybe you can ask Clint to play one of his Xbox games with you.”
The teen threw both his caution and his hands into the air as he started shouting, "Are you ready to go there? Do you really want to know everything that I keep from you? Do you wanna know about how I refused to cry when mom died because every time you saw me crying, you'd start too? Or how about the fact that the
"Manhattan?" Bucky side-eyed Steve. "Really? You got someone from Manhattan?"
Now returning to regularly scheduled programming.
"Dean," the man pressed, pointing to an armchair. "Sit."
Dean’s erection stood tall, ready for the job he had ahead, twitching in anticipation. He rolled on the condom and climbed back on top of Becky, setting his fingers back to rubbing at her entrance, slowly pushing a finger inside and-
"And what about Sam?"
“Sorry, Bruce, but that’s not helping,” Nat chided softly.
Dean blew out the breath he was holding, thought for a second, then pulled his younger brother up to look him directly in the eyes. "Not at all, Sam. Steve and Tony give you so much more than Dad ever did. They tell you they love you, they drive you around every day, they keep up to date on all your little clubs," he paused, "it makes you human."
The question was answered with a tight hug from Sam and a steely nod from Dean. The teen attempted a smile, but what came out was more of a grimace.
Loki simply sat, staring at the other teen. "I can't believe you believe me."
"Now that that's settled!" Tony pushed forward. "Is there anything you'd like to ask us?"
Tony woke up abruptly, narrowly avoiding Steve's chin when he threw his head up and off the other man's chest. "Yeah?" he called out, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Both men watched as their bedroom door creaked open and a nervous Dean stuck his head in, with a hand covering his eyes.
"Everything is fine." Steve raised his arms in a 'calm down' motion, moving to take a seat behind his desk, with Tony following behind.
"The example that you're a badass," Dean muttered to the other children's giggles.
"My first one was with Dad and Papa too! They let me invite all my friends over and Dad surprised me with a bouncy castle and there was a photo booth and-"
Steve opened his eyes slightly and winced when Tony gave a small squeeze. "You, Tony," he breathed. "It belongs to you."
"It never stopped," Loki spat. "Thor goes on and on about how he's glad the old coot is dead, but the bastard
“Dean–”
Tony surged forward and wrapped his arms around the love of his life, squeezing tightly and simply offering his silent support.
“Oh, so you just ignore that part?” the boy questioned, not understanding the nudge Dean gave him in warning.
"Damn. He got a brother?"
"I don't think I want an adventure. I just came from one, and I didn't really like it."
“No, actually,” Steve replied. “Bruce became orphaned at age five.”
“What?” Dean froze as he realized his mistake. The teen was having trouble keeping his thoughts straight; his head hurt, and his fever wasn’t helping. In the confusion, he’d slipped up.
"Pervs? What's that?" Sam asked his brother as he climbed out after him.
"You betcha!" Tony answered, strutting in through the doorway. "I gotta say, the build-up after two and a half months of not—"
Steve could hear the pout coming from the almost teenager. "Mmmhmm. And why did he take your phone away, honey?" The man was happy that the boy couldn't see his smiling face, for all the mischief Clint managed to get himself into, his hijinks never failed to make the army captain smile.
"Dean!"
” Steve had gone full Captain. “
"Well," Steve hesitated, ruffling his hair nervously. "All in all, it's not horrible."
“Okay, so the doctor says not to get the bandage wet for forty-eight hours, and to watch for signs of loss of consciousness.” Steve read from a print out Bumpin’ Booty gave him.
Steve smiled softly. "Yeah, bud. Get daddy. But instead, you chose to throw something and you could have hurt someone because you didn't think through your actions. Does that sound right?"
Natasha studied her foster father's face, taking in the sincerity with skepticism. She held out her hand for the phone, which Tony readily gave.
Steve sobbed even harder, gripping Tony's shirt so hard one of the seams began to rip from the strain.
"Dean. I'm fifteen."
"How ya doin' babe?" Tony whispered, caressing Steve's cheek lightly. The blond nodded, giving a small smile.
“It’s not true,” Bruce offered, voice strained. “It’s not true. Dean went to the hospital because he had a fever, not because he was bleeding. Although, there are injuries that could cause a fever…” he trailed off.
"Alright, give the birthday boy some space everyone. Back to the table!" Tony called out in a teasing voice, though both he and Steve noticed the unabridged panic in the teen's face.
Selective mutism caused by trauma was the official diagnosis. Natasha didn't care. She and Clint developed their own language and really, why would she want to talk to anyone else? Other people hurt her.
Gripping Steve’s and Sam’s hands, Dean held his breath and waited through the turbulence to (hopefully) land safely in the state he once called home.
Another pause with the sound of more glass clinking. "Alright. The whiskey's gone, Stark. Ask your questions."
Shooting a nervous glance to Steve, Tony rested his elbows on the table and made sure he had Dean’s full attention. “There is one more thing I want us to talk about, Dean. How much do you remember from when you were feverish?”
Fuck this was the life. What did that idiot woman know anyways? He could have sex if he wanted to!
Not one to be ignored, Mr. Coulson once more nudged the boy and raised an eyebrow, silently asking if Dean really wanted to dare refuse him again. This time, the teen sighed and raised his arm in a 'lead the way' gesture.
"About our...talk the other night," Dean started, faltering slightly.
Dean sputtered. “You don’t play around here lady. But fine. Twelve. Sweet sixteen year old named Martha.” Dean seemed to settle in again as he recalled the intimate details of the encounter. “She was smoking! Legs for days and a pussy so tight it took more than one try to get it in.” Dean winked again.
“He told us your dad was a part of the ‘American Hunters’ gang and that’s why you didn’t have a safe and stable childhood,” Steve explained further.
When the jeans were out of the way, Steve wasted no time in licking the hard outline of Tony's dick through his boxers, earning a deep and long groan from the man. Taking a second to wink playfully, the blond sucked hard at the tip through the material.
What he wasn’t planning on doing was taking an impromptu nap on his desk and waking up four hours later with a stiff neck and panic pumping through his veins.
Loki thought for a moment, then nodded. He gave the ring one final squeeze with his hands, then held the ring up to Dean.
“It’s because of how you reacted to Tony that we wanted to talk to you,” Steve interjected.
Sam didn't respond.
“I’m fine, I don’t need therapy.”
"Now," The blonde man stood up and held a hand out for Dean. "How's your courage level? We're about to check on an angry Russian redhead with martial arts training. You ready?" He teased.
“What do you mean?” he asked, slowly setting his fork down and giving the man his full attention.
“Well… okay, maybe that’s true. I’m just really excited!” the boy was practically bouncing as he checked his tie in the mirror. “We’re going to church!”
"Look," Dean started, turning to face the man, "I get it. You see two brothers alone and you immediately think the worst. But a)I'm 18, I can take care of my brother when our dad is working, and b)our dad is gonna be home any minute. He only left on a business trip. So thanks, but no thanks."
"That sounds really stressful. Having to take care of your little brother and not know how you're gonna feed him or what's going on with your dad."
This caught the teen off guard. “How the fuck do you know what I want or don’t want? You a mind reader?”
Loki shook his head. “I think I’m just gonna stay here.”
The teen woke peacefully this time, moving his head slightly towards Steve, before slowly opening his eyes.
"Is Uncle Bobby still coming?" Sam asked.
Dean turned his head away from Tony, looking out the window as he took a deep breath. “Nothing.”
"I also owe you an apology Steve. What I said...god, I-I'm so sorry."
WARNING
Shaking his head, Dean ducked his head to hide his blush.
"That's not how this works, Loki. You need to give me permission to come in, remember? This is your space and if you don't want me here, we go somewhere else."
Steve shuttered out a small sob and clutched at the front of Tony's shirt.
Dean blinked in surprise. "Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Well, Tony said you two were giving me a car, but then we got the Impala and-"
The girl's brows were pulled together in thought. "But–why would she–?" Nat took a deep breath and started again, "Dr. Hill says that sex is something meant to be shared with someone you love and trust. Becky doesn't know Dean. How could she want it?"
“Dean, come on. You need to eat.” Tony nudged the lump of a boy with the corner of the tray in jest, chuckling at the tongue said lump presented him with.
"Shhh, Mommy is getting her medicine, Clint. You have to wait." Natasha huffed and shoved a toy block in his face.
"Okay sport. What's this about?" Tony asked. The tone of his voice instantly made Dean want to burst into tears. Instead he crossed his arms and leaned back, slouching in his chair.
"Shh, Buck, gotta save your strength," Steve whispered again. Bucky felt fingers tracing through his matted hair. "Just try to open your eyes for me, pal. I just need to see those steely blues again."
"Or he could be trying to tell us he's gay. I mean either one."
"You're telling me," Tony responded with a hint of humour in his voice.
"Thank you for last night, Tones," Steve muttered into his husband's hair. "It was exactly what I needed."
"Good! Do you have any questions for us before we get dinner ready?" Steve asked.
"Why did Nat attack you? Is she a monster?"
"Slow down-"
The doctor taught her some sign language to communicate, but she refused to learn more than the basic, adamant that Clint was the only one she would 'talk' to.
Dean finally swallowed his mouthful. “Well, I guess if I had to choose, let’s go chronologically,” he replied sarcastically.
He didn't have to lie about dad 'coming home any day now'.
In response, the man pulled out his phone and typed for a second, before returning the object to his pocket.
"Pfft. Are you sure these guys aren't pervs like the last guys?" Dean slung his bag over his shoulder as he got out, looking over the house in front of them. To be conservative, it was huge. To be able to afford a house this big in New York, the people they were staying with had to be fucking loaded.
"Am the
"Thank you, Dean," Steve smiled. "Is it alright if I give you a hug?"
“Balls!” a gruff voice exclaimed, making Steve and Tony turn to each other with wide eyes as they remembered the phone call they’ve made the week prior.
"Hey, no it's no ones fault. I think it was just a lot happening a little too fast and too loud for him. Tony is the best one to help calm him down so I'm guessing the two went to Bruce's room for a bit." Steve gave Dean his reassurance.
"I don't understand, Tasha. He said all I'd have to do is sit there and he'd give me ice cream! But I didn't like how he was touching me! It made me feel all icky!" Clint sobbed into his sister's threadbare dress.
"When are you leaving tomorrow?" Bruce chimed in.
The hearing itself was short and sweet, more like a ceremony, really, with the boys agreeing that this was what they wanted and Steve and Tony signing the paperwork with beaming smiles.
"Tony hasn't touched alcohol in years, Mr. Singer, I assure you," Steve interrupted.
"...Alright."
“Do we
"Because it felt really good. And if it feels really good, it can't be bad, right?" He asked his foster parents.
This was the reason that Dean didn't just take Sam and run. Mr. Wilson was truely a good man that believed in the two of them with his entire heart. It wasn't his fault that they kept getting stuck with the worst kind of humans.
“Let’s pack the rest of this stuff up, eh? You can look through everything at home with less dust and more couches. We’ll start filling up the Impala then put the rest in the Cadillac,” Tony said, already lifting one of the boxes.
"Thanks, bud," he whispered, carefully pushing his younger foster brother away.
"Nat? You okay?" he called out.
"Please let me come in now, Steve. That was perfect and I need to meet this guy right now," Tony's muffled voice called out.
"You're telling me you don't have a single gun in this house? Nothing to protect yourself with?" Dean's voice getting louder. "You were in the army, you know how to use them and you're telling me you don't have a single gun in this house."
The other man gave a look that said '
“Really?” Sam asked, quietly. Steve held out his hand and pulled the boy onto his lap, embracing him.
“But I didn’t–”
The boy shook his head slightly, his head buried in a newly published study.
“We wouldn’t dream of it,” Tony assured the boy.
“Do you trust us to stop anyone else who might want anything like that from you?” Steve continued, as if the confession hadn’t filled him with so much love he thought his heart would explode.
The man scoffed. "Your new daddy."
to sleep, Sam," he snapped before returning to his original position of completely ignoring the boy.
“Werewolves? Dean, do you take anything seriously?!” Tony snapped.
Dean stood and marched right up to the sixteen year old.
"No, just me," Steve grinned, dodging the pillow Tony threw at his head.
"I was eleven when I was started college. I started drinking at twelve and taking drugs at thirteen. I had sex for the first time when I thirteen with a nineteen year old. At the time I thought it made me cool. That I was an adult that could make my own decisions." Tony placed his hand under Deans chin and held his gaze to his own. "It wasn't until years later that I mourned my innocence. I was thirteen! What the hell did I know about life and love? That girl couldn't have cared less about me and it nearly destroyed me looking back on it."
Dean shrugged. "Can I go now?" He asked, not looking at the men.
“Dean–”
"'Tasha? Is that your name, sweetheart?" the woman asked as she followed the two. "And what's your name, buddy?"
She still saw the colour though. Every moment of every day she saw that colour.
"Of course it is!" Dean snapped, finally looking directly at the man. "Do you think I'd actually be okay after watching my father's body be burned to ashes then buried beside the mother I barely remember?"
back. It hardly felt real.
“Does scratched and bruised cover head injuries and side gashes?” Tony sassed.
“We come bearing soup and steak!” Tony announced as he opened the door. “One guess as to whose dinner is whose.”
"Well. That was…"
You’re doing something incredible and I love you for it. Your heart and your sense of duty are two of the main reasons I married you and I’m so happy to see it in action.
“I’m fine, Sam. One of ‘em just threw me around a little. Nothing a needle and thread won’t fix,” the teen whispered back. Seeing the bedroom door open once more, Dean exclaimed loudly, “Thanks for the soup, Sam! It was delicious!”
Dean huffed and stood up, walking around his chair and threw his hands in the air. "I don't know okay! At first it was funny to see Steve flustered, but then I couldn't stop! I didn't want to keep pushing, but I just kept saying stuff and I thought I was already in shit, might as well go down swinging and I don't know why I said those things. I'm sorry." Dean was leaning on the back of his chair, his head hanging low.
"Steve. Hunny. I love you." Tony interrupted. "But I haven't slept in two days."
"Are you sure?" The man smiled. "I am a man of many talents and I can't tell you if I can fix something if I don't know what happened to begin with."
“But Steve–!” Tony tried to interject.
Steve's hand was replaced by Tony's. His eyes were calculating, scanning the teen as if trying to figure out his next move.
The boy was quiet.
"I need you," Steve forced out.
Natasha glared at the man to warn him not to separate them, hiding the fact that her heart seized in her chest at the thought. She would rather go back to that room then be taken from Clint.
“He wore it when he was beating me.” The teen's eyes were unfocused, and his voice was flat. “It would glint in the light as he hurt me. It—it mocked me. This was supposed to be a symbol of love from my mother, and instead, that boorish oaf used it to make me bleed.”
Steve gave a smile gasp and whispered "My ass. Tony, my ass is yours, please, please own it, please—" He cut off in a moan as soon as he felt his husband's long, lean and calloused finger push its way in his ass ruthlessly. When Tony had covered the finger in lube, Steve had no idea, but he didn't even come close to caring.
"Good job Clint, thank you. Now listen very carefully. You do not have to apologize for what Nat did. She is her own person who makes her own decisions and if she feels she wants to apologize to me, she will. You did absolutely nothing wrong Clint. Do you hear that? You did nothing wrong and you never have to apologize when you didn't do anything. Okay?" Dean explained to the boy softly, holding one of his hands and rubbing his other hand down Clint's arm. "Do you understand?"
Steve's smile was so big it was radiant. "I can't believe the two of you are together, it seemed like a dream until now, I-"
"For fuck's sake." The man reached over and fastened the thing for the teenager that was now staring out the window.
Sam audibly gasped. “What?”
Dean opened his mouth, and said nothing. He couldn’t tell him what actually happened. Not without putting his life in danger.
"Hey, it's okay," Clint interrupted, closing his textbook. "I was just about done anyways, it's fine, I'll go."
"So?"
Dean scoffed.
“He never cared much for any one school–we moved around too much for that. But learning and knowledge–now those he’s obsessed with.” Dean leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes. “Always made a fuss about getting our transcripts before leaving someplace. That boy is gonna end up somewhere, just you wait.” Dean’s voice was dripping with pride. Steve could clearly see the love and adoration he held for his little brother.
"No."
The other boy sat there, clutching the jewellery tightly. “There has to be another way. A way where we don’t have to burn it.”
"Assholes are just more work! Ya gotta supply yur own slick!"
Knowing exactly what his brother was talking about, Sam stopped what he was doing and looked at Dean. "Yeah?"
"I'll see you tomorrow, pal," Steve called out as he reached the door.
"Your birthday party. We're thinking of doing a small thing for just the family on the actual day, but maybe do a bigger thing the weekend before? You could invite all of your friends from school and maybe Mr. Wilson if you're on better terms now…" the man trailed off.
“Go on,” Dean urged his brother. “Maybe you can ask Clint to play one of his Xbox games with you.”
Pounding in his skull, as if he had been hit by a train: probable concussion; monitor for signs of unconsciousness.
Looking over the teen's shoulder, Phil saw Steve leaning against the doorway, mouthing
“You’re not going to school today.”
"What?" Dean exclaimed. "You were convinced he was out there! Like, two months ago you asked when he was getting us!"
"I had no idea you were dealing with that," Sam whispered in the dark.
"The day you tell me you wanna marry a man is the day I'll finally get those nipple piercings you wanted me to get." Steve laughed even harder.
Loki studied the other teen once more, before muttering in his slavic native tongue. "Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you," he took a breath and straightened his posture, looking Dean dead in the eye. "It's Odin."
The couple stared at Dean expectantly.
The brothers continued to stare at the fire, Thor’s words remaining at the forefront of their minds. “You know,” Dean whispered to Sam again, “This tradition I like. Burning shit and calling it hope. I could get behind it.”
Not only did Tony find a seat, but the command also worked on Dean as they both sat in the front sitting room. Steve ran a hand over his hair, making the blond strands stick out random ways.
Sam paused, fight fleeting. “You never told me that.”
"Dean this is awesome! I can't believe they gave us laptops!"
Sam put renewed interest in the trophy as he shrugged again, quiet for a moment. "I mean, we haven't seen him in like, two years. I–" He took a breath. "I'm sad, obviously, but, I guess, I sort of knew he wasn't coming back."
Loki studied the man carefully for a moment, before shaking his head. "I um, I changed my mind. The office would be better."
"Mommy doesn't want us?" she asked, tears forming in her eyes.
"Okay, okay, Clint," Steve ruffled the boy's hair. "I'm sure I'll see all of it soon enough, but the dinner your siblings are putting out looks like it'll go cold soon. You can tell me everything while we eat."
doubted how much Steve and Tony care for me. Hell, even when I'm getting punished they still tell me they love me and that I can come to them with anything."
Dean nodded at Tony's words.
"That was really good Dean." Steve spoke. Dean was still kneeling, facing away from Steve and his brother.
"Nat, I know you want to be alone right now, but you're bleeding and you need medical attention."
"You might as well pass me those pictures if I'm gonna be fighting for them."
Dean nodded, eyeing his shoes while stuffing his hands in his pockets.
"And how are you feeling now? After everything?" Steve inquired.
She woke up with Clint crying next to her.
"You can put them all in the main living room if you want. Then once everything is inside you can look through everything." Tony suggested, taking one of the heavier boxes from Sam and helping him set it on the coffee table.
"Open your eyes, Buck, look at me!" Steve begged, eyes brimming with the tears he refused to shed. Bucky's eyes opened, it seemed, without permission, as if the command were enough to control him. Letting the man focus, Steve stood completely still.
I feel like I keep apologizing for how long updates lol. Know that no matter how long it takes, I'm very much dedicated to finishing this series!!!
"Seriously? Fucking codeine? This is like the most addictive painkiller, Dean! What the fuck were you thinking?" Tony was really angry now.
Dean thought hard, then looked up to his foster parents. “You two?” he whispered. It was the most vulnerable the couple had ever seen Dean.
“Sam,” Dean caught the boy’s arms, keeping him from leaving the room. “You know I’ll never let anything happen to you, yeah?”
“Um, Catholic is fine,” the boy responded quietly.
"What are you apologizing for, sweetheart?" Tony asked as he pulled out his phone. He pulled up the notes app and gave the phone to Natasha, awaiting a response.
Retreating from his memories, the teen came to the startling realization that, between his father and Steve, he knew which one he’d rather serve under–and it wasn’t the one barking orders.
They also learned that Thor has issues with aggression, Bruce has something called 'meltdowns', Natasha can get really scary sometimes when she thinks she's in danger and Clint will get scared if you talk with your hands when he's close by.
Steve's heart sunk. "That wasn't very nice of him, was it? How did that make you feel, sweetheart?"
The blond laughed and leaned down to kiss the man. "I'll take your word for it."
Staring at the painted walls, she ignored the tears soaking the mattress underneath her.
"Bye, Steve. Good luck," Dean said, awkwardly. The two were standing in front of the bedroom door, not wanting to wake up Sam.
"Hey, shh," Tony lifted Steve's head back up and waited until the other man opened his eyes once more. "I love you so much it hurts. My first thought in the morning and my last thought at night is of you. I would give away
“What are you two doing?” Sam asked, breaking the silent conversation of the teens.
Even Bobby didn't want him. His dad abandoned him, all of his foster parents hated the sight of him, and now even their Uncle Bobby didn't want him.
"There's something we want to talk to you about." Tony smiled, side-eyeing his husband and nearly bouncing off his seat.
"They've already been to eight. The longest they stayed in one was four and a half months. All of those foster parents except one couple are now either in prison, in hospital awaiting prison, or on bail awaiting trial." Phil's eyes glared down Tony's, already knowing those kids were coming here.
"Their case worker was my protogée, a Mr. Sam Wilson. He consults me from time to time and when I heard about these boys I knew they needed you." The response was smoothly delivered. "Anything else I can answer for you?"
"That's okay, sweetheart. I just want to tell you how much I love you and I'm going to miss you while I'm gone," Steve smiled, taking in Bruce's concentrating face.
Steve watched his husband trying desperately to keep it together to support him, and realized that what he, himself had been trying to do since he got back, wasn’t being strong for his family at all, but falling apart slowly without even realizing it.
"I figured out who you are! You're math!"
“For fucks sake! Why don’t you tell
"Try it again," Dean persisted, "try asking him this time instead of demanding."
“With that smile? Nah, there’s something scandalous in there, I just know it,” Falsworth laughed, sitting down next to him with a full tray of breakfast.
Dean snorted into his food in a half laugh half embarrassed choke, remembering his and Tony's conversation just the other day.
"I've had some setbacks. I've had them before and I'll have them again. The reason for them is irrelevant and I know that Sam and Dean leaving would do so much more harm than good. They stay," Tony read for the others.
"Charmed. Where the hell can I put my stuff?" Dean rudely replied, stuffing his hands in his pockets.
“Hey, love machine,” Tony’s voice was like a spring of fresh water washing over Steve’s spine, loosening every fiber of tension he didn’t realize he was carrying. “How goes the Buckster?”
"Kid you have too many daddy issues to start throwing that around. And fuck yeah they are. He says mine are the best though. He loves the beard burn he gets between his ass cheeks when I eat him out for hours." Tony shot back. Steve quickly stood up and left the room.
The two stood in thought, thinking about how far their boy has come.
"What's got your panties in a twist, Stark? Stock Market drop a whole point?" Bobby scoffed.
"No, we're not thinking of doing anything like that," Tony stated. "But, we know the stress hasn't been great for everybody, so we just want to see how everyone is doing."
Throwing his arms out above him in a display of dramatics, Tony groaned. "Why can't he come to us?" he whined.
“Seriously? You believe in some mystical being in the sky that’s supposed to be in charge of our entire lives?” Dean’s voice rose without his permission, betrayed in the knowledge that there was something about his brother that he didn’t know.
"I am
The fact was, that was how Dean got psychiatrists off his back. Hit on them until they got uncomfortable. It had nothing to do with respect. Not that he'd tell Steve and Tony that.
"Then what should you have done?"
What's this? Two updates in a week?? Who am I?? LOL
Thor all but threw Nat over his oversized shoulder and marched off into the hall. Bruce on the other hand was still standing in the front entrance. His head was down, fingers twisted in the bottom of his jacket as he shifted his weight from side to side.
"Why don't you guys go ahead," Steve suggested. "I'll catch up in a minute."
"I talked to Bucky today about meeting the kids," Steve called out from the bathroom.
Two weeks in and Steve couldn’t believe how much his heart physically hurt with longing for his family.
Steve gasped silently, knowing the weight of the boy's words, before nodding solemnly. "I promise I'll do my best."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was too busy muttering to notice the single tear run down Dean's face.
“Tony,” Steve warned.
“Yeah, no. I never got tested.”
"Really? You're not interested in a single sport?" Tony asked.
“He’s not actually our uncle,” Sam explained. “We stayed with him sometimes when our dad was working and stuff.”
"Dean?" Sam called out.
“How about when you fell off your bed?” Tony guided the boy.
"That's right, sweetheart," Tony agreed, before lifting the other man's left hand. Slowly, making sure to draw out every second, the genius licked the entirety of Steve's ring finger, paying extra attention to the gold band wrapped around it. "This ring right here? That's my fucking claim on you. It means that no one else can touch you, that you
Dean sighed and dropped his hand from the doorknob. He's been through this a hundred times before in different states. Observant people noticing how often dad's gone, how he sometimes comes to school in gashes and bruises, and once an especially observant woman noticed how Dean was caring a little bit
The men looked at each other in the rearview mirror briefly.
Dean could see that Loki was still unsteady. “And Loki, he’s only going to get stronger. The longer ghosts are attached to an object, the more harm they can do. What if he ends up killing you one day? Huh?”
"They want to adopt you." The teen waited with bated breath for how Sam would respond.
"Good. Next. Clint was playing video games and didn't want to pause to greet you. Steve told him firmly to get his butt over to meet you. Did you see Steve touch him in any way to get him to comply?"
"I know your history." The man began, not even bothering to keep looking at the teen. "I know you stayed with some real monsters in the past." At this he pointedly looked at Dean before continuing to roam his eyes around the room. Dean's breath stopped. Monsters? He knew about the supernatural?
The engineer walked into the room carrying a TV tray of food, Sam behind him with two glasses of water.
He jumped and almost threw his phone against the wall when it rung broke the silence. He took a breath to calm down and answered. “Hey, hun.”
"For fucks–"
Sam was gripping his mug tightly and staring into the fire, far from the happy boy from the hours earlier. Dean reached out and nudged the boy, offering a small smile, frowning when Sam did nothing but close his eyes and shake his head.
"Please sit!" The smaller man gestured to Dean, taking a seat next to the older blonde man on a loveseat beside the couch the brothers had taken.
Giving a snort, Dean responded, "Yeah, that was kinda the point."
“He does love school, huh?” the man said, tucking into his dinner with gusto.
Steve raised his arms to present his case to his husband.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You know it’s Becky Walters. And what about her?”
“Oh, thank God, Dean! You’re alright!” Steve rushed to the teen’s side, forgoing the chair and sitting on the edge of the bed. “Oh, Dean, darling we were so scared!”
” Steve’s Captain voice made another appearance, silencing the room once more. “We are not accusing Dean of having a drug problem!”
“Hey everyone, I’m really sorry I fell asleep last night and didn’t make dinner for you,” he started, placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder as he spoke. “But I guess you all fought for yourselves?”
The act itself was animalistic, grunts and bites, Steve bent down to take Tony's nipple in his mouth and had to stifle a scream from the man with his palm. The first brush of Steve's dick to Tony's prostate had Tony's eyes rolling back into his head with pleasure. Steve focused on that spot and watched his husband fall apart beneath him, and with one hand jerking the man's cock and Steve's teeth on his collarbone, Tony squealed into his arm at his release.
Tony threw himself back into his chair. "You just had to show him the pictures first didn't you?" He accused Phil. "You know the answer is never no when he sees the pictures."
"Have they done this before?" she asked, reigning in her anger. He cried harder and nodded. "Why didn't you tell me?"
A pause. "I read about your stints in rehab, Mr. Stark. I trust I don't have to worry about them boys being at the other end of an empty bottle." The words were heavy with implication.
"Bite me? You think you can bite me?" the man yelled.
.” For once, Tony was completely serious. “You’re not going to be in trouble, but please tell us the truth,” he practically begged.
Dean, who sat beside the boy, placed a hand on his little brother's arm. "Sorry dude, I wasn't paying attention, didn't mean to spook ya. I'll clean it up."
"Hey guys, mind if we join you?" Bruce asked, taking a seat on one of the armchairs.
) asked at the beginning of their session that night.
"Excuse me?" the woman asked. Why was she so close to him?
"Because getting those boys to tell us anything relevant is like pulling teeth," the engineer spat back, trying to ignore the thought that this man was drinking on the other line while talking about the boys.
be alone in this room until your fever drops.”
“No!” Tony shouted. “We’re still adopting you, of course we’re still adopting you!”
“What should we wear?” Sam asked inquisitively.
“Locally. If anything threatens my town I threaten them sort of thing. But I don’t actively seek out trouble.”
"Well...I don't know," Sam admitted. "When Mr. Coulson told us, it just...made sense."
"Dean, darling, do you know what just happened?" Steve asked as he started stroking the boys hair.
"And is that what you did?"
“He’s boiling hot.” Sam looked at Steve, then back at Dean, thinking a mile a minute. His brother needed help, and, as much as Sam trusted the well-meaning man, he knew Dean would want the soldier gone.
Tony's money had bought Bucky a suite at the hospital that was so big, everyone was comfortable sitting in their chairs without the room feeling cramped at all.
to apologize for anything, only that
too much," Tony emphasized.
“Attitude? Dude, when I give you attitude, you’ll fuckin’ know it. I ain’t pussying around with you here. Just buzz off, okay? I don’t need you to take care of me,” Dean sighed and braced himself for the incoming blow, knowing that apologizing would have just made things worse, but that rejecting the man probably hadn’t helped any, either.
so much for him, but obviously didn’t understand him.
Dean didn't sleep that night. He sat with his back on their door, standing guard for Sammy. When he felt sure that everyone in the house was asleep, he went to work.
Steve did roll his eyes at that but decided not to argue and took the required deep breath. “You know, it’s not fair when you use my own words against me,” he muttered.
The engineer gripped the back of Steve's hair tightly, preventing him from going far. "Don't you dare. I'm gonna die without sex while you're gone, the least you can do is give me something to jerk to."
Steve smiled. "Just needed to hear your voice."
"I'll start screaming and biting again," she warned, effectively grasping at straws.
"Like you did after dad died," the boy explained, never once removing his gaze from the ceiling. "You're gonna leave me."
"'Tasha? You okay?"
A nod.
"If you want I can help you study." Bruce offered. "I can even teach you more if you're interested. I'm taking a human anatomy course in uni right now so it would actually help if I could explain some of the information to someone else."
The teen nodded slightly, then asked to change the subject.
“Trust me. You want something in there if you start puking again,” Tony pushed. “Dry heaving? Ten times worse!” He waited a moment more before accepting that Dean wasn't going to move, then set the glass back on the nightstand. “You’re really not doing too great, huh? How many of those tablets did you take yesterday?”
"Bucky!"
Loki blushed and ducked his head in a slight nod.
"Well, I mean, kinda?" Sam responded. "But this isn't like when he was grounded, he hasn't been awful in like, two weeks! He's been annoying, and a little mean like he was with Clint, but nothing like he was before."
“Dude, your moods are giving me whiplash,” Dean muttered, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Look, it’s almost 12:30 in the morning, could you turn off your dickishness for like, ten minutes? What’s going on? Why are you so attached to this ring?”
"Dude, what the fuck," Dean snapped, not caring to lower his voice since they were now alone in the library.
Sam slanted his head and analyzed Nat. "So if you don't talk, how do you do group projects in school?"
Tony not so gently grasped Steve's chin, then leaned over and bit the man's lips lightly. "Every noise that comes out of these lips? They belong to me. Isn't that right?"
"Sorry, Dean! I just got so excited! You're gonna be my real big brother now!"
"We'll think of another gift, Dean, no problem. With Tony's money, you could literally ask for anything less than an island and it wouldn't even put a dent in your college fund." Steve chuckled. "I actually wanted to talk to you about your party."
Loki froze into the hug, not leaning in, but not pulling away either. Slowly, his arms came up and wrapped themselves around the man. It only took another moment before he hid his face into the blond's neck.
I already have quite a few chapters written, and my beta’s working as fast as she can! She says she's sorry for the wait!!
“But why can’t I see them?” Sam questioned. The boy had woken up between crisp, stiff sheets in an unfamiliar white room. A gentle-faced woman was sitting at his side who, though kind and altogether polite, had refused to let him leave or go see his foster parents.
"So, now that we're not in immediate danger, why don't you tell me why a kid is going on a werewolf hunt by himself. And how the hell did you even get out here?" the hunter asked Dean, not seeing a single mode of transportation that could've brought the boy to the outskirts of the city.
Steve and Tony didn’t do anything! This isn’t like the other times, I swear!” Dean denied adamantly.
The man pressed his hand against the wound, but it was too deep and too late, he stumbled with the weight of the girl on his back and fell to his knees in a puddle of his own blood.
The Captain’s order, while intended for Tony, affected the boy, as well. Through gritted teeth, Dean bit back, “I didn’t bring them into the house! You asked for them at school, and I gave them to you.”
"Impressive, surprised Steve lets you get on the field without bubble wrap, but impressive. Next."
“Tones?” Steve choked out, almost embarrassed with how little control over his voice he had at the moment.
Tony laughed as he responded. "And you were told to come get the disgusting couple?"
"Dean, come on. It's not that big a deal."
“About the werewolves, yes. And about the hunter you met; Rufus, I believe his name was. Although,” the man paused, considering the teen, “I’m not sure about what was on the paper he gave you.”
The blond sighed, then squeezed Dean’s hand. “Dean? Honey, can you wake up for me, please?”
“Alright,” Tony began. “First of all, Nat was right to apologize. She did something wrong and needed to own up to it. Second, I could be mistaken, but I hardly ever am, I think you feel the need to make some apologies of your own.”
The voices started to muffle as Loki heard the teens crowd into the shower room. He finally raised his head to glare at their backs as they left. He took a look around the room to see the boy's clothes strewn about in the way only teenage boys can do and smiled.
"St—"
Blinking, Bucky followed the direction of the voice, settling his eyes on his saviour, the one person he wanted to see every damn day since he fell from that helicopter. He opened his mouth to ask if it was real, but a hitching sob is all that escaped.
“Love, I think we need a check-in,” Tony spoke gently.
"Hear me out. What if he's doing this on purpose?" Tony proposed.
Natasha, however, handed her phone to Tony to read the conversation.
"Shh," the engineer calmed the other man. "Believe me when I tell you I really want you right now in any way you'll have me. I'm just making sure you haven't changed your mind. We could always just have a bubble bath, or just go to sleep. Whatever you want, love."
Check it out! Things are a little different since I literally read it years ago, but I need to give credit for the entire universe my characters are playing in!
"It just feels right." Tony finished.
A sob forced its way out of the teen, making the man pull Dean in for a tight hug, feeling the gasps and tears escaping the broken boy.
"Natasha, sweetheart, I need you to open the door again, please," Tony knocked again, a slight edge to his voice that wasn't there before. She looked down and almost groaned when she realized that the blood had soaked through her shirt sleeve.
Dean turned to his hosts. "Thank you." His smile was tight, as though forced, where as Sam was gleaming ear to ear.
“Very funny,” Steve ruffled the teen’s hair before sitting beside his husband on the couch. “No, we’re not adopting someone else. This is about, well, about your adoption, Dean. Yours and Sam’s.”
gone through?! Last I checked you weren’t the one taking all that
And I know, I know, there's no Dean in this chapter, but he's coming back soon, I promise!
I finally finished writing the last chapter!!!! Which means there are only six chapters left! :O
Tony nodded with a smile, and with a mock salute to Bucky, ushered the kids out.
"Sam, I need you to let go of Dean so I can make sure he's really okay and not just being a macho man." Steve was smiling as he helped Sam off the older teen. "Sam, Clint, why don't the two of you start your homework?"
The kids filed in one by one and smiled at the man in the hospital bed, who had convinced Steve to bring in a barber to cut his hair for the first time in years, so he would look his best for the occasion.
"And which one of you is this?" he asked, bringing back the jolly atmosphere.
Despite every instinct screaming to keep that door shut, the teen cracked it open to see Steve and Tony right outside.
Dean chanted in his head as he turned up the volume on the new headphones he’d gotten for Christmas. Apparently, Dean was terrified of flying, not that he’d had the opportunity to find out sooner, but here they were, Sam, Steve, Tony and him on a plane.
Dean gave a small, but genuine smile. “Hi, Steve.”
The colour, and the anger, returned.
"That's right. We would never harm any kids, ever. Let alone our own. And like it or not, for the time being you're included in that category. Do you understand?" Tony was now sitting so close to the edge of the couch he could reach out and easily touch Deans hand. He wanted to. The poor boy looked so confused.
Sam was quiet. He looked at Steve's hand over his own, then raised his head to meet Steve's eyes.
Bucky reached out his hand and Steve clasped it firmly as he sat on the bed beside the other man. "Steve, I-" he paused for a moment, then stared directly at his friend. "I'm really proud of you. For building this for yourself. Those kids are...incredible!"
"'Cuz reading and writing don't make you smart?" Clint whispered.
"Alright. I'll be back soon." Steve stood up and kissed Dean's head. "You sure you're alright, love?" Dean nodded. "Okay. Twenty minutes, tops." He called out.
Dean was even enjoying his therapy sessions. Not that he took them seriously, no he was having the best time fucking over the sweet young therapist they assigned him too.
Steve placed a hand on Dean's shoulder. "Yes, you do. And now that your little brothers are gone, how are you really?"
"We don't want you to hurt yourself again," Steve stated behind her. "We love you too much to let you do that to yourself."
Sam furrowed his eyebrows at the scene and studied his unconscious brother with the man Dean–apparently–now trusted. Resigned, Sam steeled his resolve and asked, “What can I do to help?”
"Alright, buddy," Tony sighed as leaned against the door of Loki's room. "Let's talk. Is it alright if we talk here or do you want to go to Steve's office?"
"But you said-"
in the past day!” Sam’s panic was seeping through, his words becoming louder and more rushed.
He needed to get Bobby's new number, and to do that, he needed to talk to someone actively in the hunting world.
"Good." His eyes were wet. Interesting. "Here's what's gonna happen. Either Tony or I am going to stay here with you while the other looks for any sharp object you can use to cut yourself with. After that, we're calling Dr. Hill and making you an appointment to see her as soon as possible, okay?"
"Hello?"
The engineer yelped as he felt his husband squeeze his crotch and bite lightly on his ear, before straightening up and heading for the door.
"Mmmhmm. Then where did that bandaid come from?" His sister teased. Clint had a new bright pink bandaid on his forehead, although this wasn't out of the norm for the clumsy twelve year old.
“You love Dean.” Steve continued, Sam nodded. “Sometimes when we love someone, it means that we have to do really hard things that they may not be happy about. And that’s a good thing! For example, I’m going to tell you a secret.” The man whispered. “When Tony asked me to marry him, I said no.”
Bucky chuckled. "I've heard all about you, Clint. I have some ideas on pranks you can pull on your Papa later," the soldier winked, then moved onto the next child.
Reluctantly, Tony stood and found his own seat. “Okay. I think it’s time for a family meeting. All in favour?”
The colour faded, but didn't disappear. The police found Clint's birth father just a few blocks away. At first, the man wanted no part in taking Natasha, claiming her to be a 'bastard' but his wife simply smiled at the kids and ushered them in.
"Your primitive brain must be inventing things. It's no wonder with
"Pills?" Dean examined the bottle.
Dean sighed and went to run his hand over his face but stopped when his side wound twinged. Hissing in pain, the teen relented, “Fine, Sammy. You win. It was werewolves.”
She met his gaze easily. “I think I’m right in that this isn’t the first Christmas by far that you’ve spent without your father, but it is the first one where you don’t have to take care of Sam by yourself and have the means to give him everything you’ve ever wanted him to have.”
Dean woke to a hand stroking his hair. He relaxed easily into the fingers, melting with every pass. One second he was floating in easy peace, the next he was leaning over the side of the bed, heaving up everything in his stomach.
“Woah!” Dean held up his hands in surrender. “I’m not scared of you two! You are the only parents I’ve ever had where I’m legit not worried you’re gonna hurt me.” The teen leaned closer to the couple, stabbing his index finger into the table to emphasize his words.
Tony and Dean were still sitting on the couch when the front door swung open and Nat came barreling in.
Dean, I didn’t even know they were real! Are you okay?!”
He paused, once again staring at his hands. "I never realized how much I was missing until I had it. I never realized how much kids need to hear certain things from their parents."
"Are Sam and Dean going to be in trouble for leaving your… 'way of life'?" Steve blurted out.
The teen snapped his gaze up from the floor to look at the woman once more. "If he knows when I'm hiding something, I can't protect him," he finally admitted.
"That you're being mean to yourself."
I'm so sorry for the (5?) month break, but life was insanely busy. But fear not! I have not nor am I ever planning of abandoning this series!!
Tony stood from his seat behind the desk and moved to crouch in front of the teen. "It's important to know why, because we need to figure out how to make sure this doesn't happen again, and if there's something bigger going on that we need to address."
Dean's mouth opened and closed multiple times, not a sound escaping.
"It's a lot, isn't it?" Tony asked quietly, understanding that his husband just needed a moment to fall apart and support when he was done. Steve nodded frantically.
"I ain't sayin' anythin' of the sort, Stark, calm down, just that there are things that you don't necessarily need to know."
ALSO she is a WONDERFUL human being and found the original fic I read years ago that inspired this fic!!
"Sam." Steve squeezed Sam's hand as he interrupted the boy. "It's fine. I was just caught off guard. War was-" Steve took a bracing breath. "War was hell, to tell you the truth."
"Ugh. That's what started this in the first place!" Dean threw his head back against the couch in exasperation.
And a young boy sitting on the floor playing a video game.
“Doctor?! What’s wrong with him?” Sam demanded. “Is he really that hurt?”
"Did you hear me?" Dean asked.
Pulling his fingers out, Steve nipped once more at Tony's neck, admiring the lovely collage of bruises before lubing himself up and positioning himself at his husband's entrance. He hooked his arms around Tony's legs and paused. Before he could get a word out the engineer practically shouted: "For god's sake, fuck me Steven Stark!"
Dean opened his eyes then, meeting Steve’s with his own. Even after the panic attack and the sex talk, it was the most vulnerable Steve had ever seen the boy. The look of pure amazement and disbelief on Dean’s face just then was one Steve would never forget.
"He kept using big words and not telling me what they meant!" Clint pouted.
"Dean," Mr. Coulson called out, interrupting the boy's spiralling. "Sit down."
Dean was loving it.
“Next! Bertha What’s-her-name!” Tony interjected.
With a small nod, the teen left, leaving the couple to an empty kitchen and the sounds of their kids through the walls.
“As real a brother as Dean is for you,” the father replied.
"Jesus Christ," Tony muttered.
"Not a talking day, huh?" Tony reached for the girls hand and squeezed before letting go. He whispered something in her ear and Nat gave a small nod. "Nat came to us non verbal, she's been doing so much better but some days are harder than others."
"That that's why my dad drinks. Only, he said he lost a lot of people, so he had to drink a lot, and you only said you lost Bucky, so maybe you don't have to drink so much?" Sam reasoned.
Loki reached up and grabbed the end of the chain hidden under his long-sleeved sleep shirt. “I don’t know what you mean,” he rushed out, turning to close the door once more.
Steve gestured for Thor to continue restraining Natasha then beckoned Dean to come closer.
“Because after that your dad introduced you to the supernatural.”
“You said you don’t want me to lie to you. So I won’t.”
"Clint!" Tony chastised. "What did we tell you?"
“Falling apart?” Tony repeated, then the phone in Steve’s hand began to vibrate.
safe in your bottom desk drawer." The man continued. "Steve and Tony aren't ignorant of the situation as a whole, but the specifics are very fuzzy. If you feel the need, you can share anything with them and they will not tell your secrets to another being. Either way, while you are in this house you are under both my and their protection and always will be." At that, the man lifted himself from the chair as waited for Mr. Wilson to finish hugging Sam, before giving one last pointed look to the teen and leaving.
“You did the right thing.”
“Fair enough. Anyone else?” Steve pressed.
“So I got slashed up! Do you see me reaching for more pain pills? I can take care of myself!”
Dr. Hill made her realize that there were specific actions and feelings associated with when the colour was near painful, and when it was manageable. Fear and helplessness was a given, but she also discovered she felt lonely. And sad.
"Now, Dean," Steve placed a hand on his shoulder as he looked him dead in the eye, "how do you know she really wanted it? What did she say or do to tell you she wanted it?"
"Clint, calm down, you're scaring Dean," Bruce shushed, giving Dean a small smile. "Dad and Papa know how to throw parties. As in, every party is tailored for that person. Clint gets a carnival, Nat gets the Russian ballet, Thor gets huge bonfires and I have a quiet dinner at home," he explained, watching Clint stuff his face with more food and nodding frantically.
Mr. Coulson managed to arrange both a hunter's funeral and a civilian's funeral, with them burning the wrapped body of John Winchester on a pyre followed by burying the ashes in a box beside the body of Mary Winchester.
Phil had returned with three other men, two of the most jacked blonde guys Dean had ever seen, and a short man with dark hair and an impressive goatee.
The girl cocked her head in confusion.
Dean froze. That must be Steve's 'Captain' voice. If he didn't know he was in the army before, no doubt now. The boy looked at the grown men, gaging their reactions. Steve was angry. Shit. Tony looked like he was gonna be sick. Interesting.
"Why is there a punching bag in the corner?" Sam asked their guides, big brown eyes gazing up at them.
TW for this chapter: discussion of past child abuse (but tbh, that's why you're here, isn't it? LOL)
Sam's eyes lit up. "Not yet, I'm on the Eragon series right now, but it's on my list!"
"You got a problem with 'fags', Lieutenant?" Steve asked, glaring.
AND THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TO MY NEW BETA TOOthless!! They are amazing!!!!
“Why does he have a gun in here?” Steve asked, eyes wide and holding the weapon at arm’s length. The brothers looked at each other in confusion. How did Bobby miss that?
"Why do we have to be quiet, Dean?"
"Just," Steve's voice broke as he closed his eyes and lowered his head. "Just—just tell me you love me. Please take me apart and put me back together. It's what you
"Yeah," the boy responded, his smile grew bigger as he saw the excitement in Tony's face.
“What? But we’ve been with him!” Steve protested.
The two were quiet for a moment.
Tony smiled. "I love you too, my darling."
Sam nodded. Tony ruffled Sam’s hair and gave a small smile.
“Yes, sweetheart?” Steve pulled his face away to look the boy in the eyes.
“I have to agree with Nat, doesn’t look like you do,” Tony commented, handing the girl back her phone.
"For your information both Tony and I are bisexual, but I would still never treat a lady that way!"
"Why would you do this, Dean? There was no record of drugs in your file. We did everything we were supposed to, we've handled every obstacle you've thrown at us, but this?! Why the fuck would you do drugs?!" Tony was borderline yelling at Dean as he drove them back to the house.
"I assume dad and yourself enjoyed your night very much after we returned to our beds?" Thor smirked as he served his papa.
Once Steve was up to four fingers, Tony was fucking himself on the digits and moaning wantonly. "Please, Steve, please," he begged.
“If no one is Jewish, why the menorah?” Dean asked, eyeing the elaborately engraved item on the mantel.
Slowly, so Dean could follow his movements, the man rested his hand on Dean's arm. “Dean, there’s no way in hell you’re going to school, and there’s no way we’re leaving you home alone today, either. Now, get up to bed, and I’ll bring you some soup.”
Loki shook his head sadly, still looking blankly at the wood.
Tony stood up then, moving towards the two. "However, we still do need to talk. And we will never, ever hurt you, but we still need to punish you for what happened today. It wasn't cool and you owe Dr. Miranda an apology."
"Yeah...I bet you are," Tony sighed. "Come on, we're going home." He stood up and waited for Dean to find his balance before heading to the car that was parked haphazardly in front of the school.
Steve blinked, then shook his head. "Sorry Sam. I forgot about that until just now. It feels good to remember the good ol' days." The soldier smiled at the boy and covered a smaller hand with his own. "He was so confused! He said he was going to take a bus to meet me at the hotel, then next thing he knew he was waking up to an old man yelling at him in German. He swore he traveled back in time to the Second World War until he got out his smartphone."
"Well I wish we could've at least finished before getting caught."
"Oh?"
"It's not an option for me either, that's why you have to try with this one, Nat. For Clint."
"And– and they," Dean paused. How could he put into words that Sam could now officially be a part of the perfect family? "They told me something."
Dean nodded minutely, grateful that the man understood.
“Yeah, dad loved the classics,” Dean mused, running his fingers along the spine of the tapes.
"Ugh, Steve, you're killing me," Tony moaned.
"Bobby, do you know where Dad is?"
Steve looked up at the teen, and upon seeing his expression, merely nodded and closed his book.
"These are your phones now. Do whatever you'd like with them. If for whatever reason you need to leave us, the phones will go with you." Steve assured the brothers.
“You didn’t realize? You stopped being a jerk when you and Steve started sparring,” Tony reminded the teen.
"When can we meet him?" Sam asked quietly.
“Then yeah. This is exactly like when I asked Steve to marry me the first time.”
The teen grumbled in response. Panicked, Tony ran to the boy, expecting to see his son laying in a puddle of blood.
“Shh, I know. It fucking sucks. Let it out. As much as it feels like shit now, at least it’s coming out at all. I remember there was one night–well, I guess it was morning–where I was over the toilet for five hours. I timed it.
Popping open the glove compartment, he was met with the notable absence of fake IDs and the hand pistol, but the cassettes were exactly where dad left them.
"Don't ask questions you don't want answers to."
Dean thought for a moment, doing the math in his head. "But, that was like, three weeks after we came here," he realized, astonished. "You've wanted us since then?"
The two were interrupted by a noise coming from the resting teen, whose breath was coming out in short pants as small whimpers escaped–the beginning of a nightmare. The older boy’s body twitched in terror, and a low whine sounded.
“Kids,” Tony mumbled, shaking the last of the nightmare off of him and he stumbled towards the lab door.
Loki shrugged in response. "It is not as if you chose the timing. Your friend has been found, you go to him. Completely understandable."
"We are not letting him near our kids!"
“Really? No complaints?” Tony pushed. “Do I need to remind you of your injuries?”
"If this is how we meet, I have a feeling the two of us are going to get along splendidly," Tony smirked.
Mr. Coulson smirked again, shooting the boy a wink before exiting his chair and leaving the room.
As always, I have to thank my wonderful beta morrismsteph for spending hours just expanding and editing this world I've created in my head and helped me put down in words!
"We–well we have a few questions we'd like to ask you, sir," Steve replied. "About the boys."
Sam went still. “I do.”
Oh, right. Back to the matter at hand, or, dick.
“Tell me what’s going on!”
Dean swore he could hear glasses clinking on the other end of the line.
"Do you need me to sit with you until you fall asleep?" he offered, knowing that the boy wasn't even close to okay.
“I know what it is, you imbecile,” Loki snapped, interrupting. He reached out to put it into the fireplace, but stopped, bringing it back to his chest.
"Hate to tell ya, kid, but you sucked at soccer," Dean laughed.
“Didn’t think so.” the teen turned away and started fixing his collar.
"That is not fair!" Tony shouted at the open door, only receiving a loud laugh in response.
Tony laved his tongue on the nipple, circling and lapping, occasionally drawing a yerk and a moan as he bit down. The process repeated when he moved to the other side, paying just as much attention to the other nipple as he did the first. By the time he sat up, mouth glistening with saliva, Steve had his head thrown back in abandon, eyes squeezed shut and breath coming out in shaky pants.
“Hun?”
Boxes of decorations were strewn over every surface of the large gathering room with a giant evergreen pine tree now standing bare in the far corner.
“So Loki, my best friend growing up was named Bucky. He was practically my brother in every way but blood, saved my life more than enough times to earn it,” the man explained, smiling and losing himself in his memories. “Well, when we turned eighteen, we both enlisted in the army. I made my way up to Captain and him to Sargent. We led three tours together before an extraction went wrong and he fell out of the helicopter.”
"How ya feelin?" He asked Dean as he sat next to him.
"I'm Clint! I'm thirteen and I love archery!"
“Then tell me how you got hurt
Dean turned back to leave when Mr. Wilson rounded his desk slowly.
Dean rolled his eyes and reached out to get the chips he came in there for. "Don't know what you're talking about."
The entire table went quiet as they whipped their heads to look at Dean. Apparently they were all in consensus that a ten year old didn't need to know how to swear.
“We’re not starting this again, Tony,” Steve warned the man.
The officers decided to do the interviews in groups of two.
Loki knew how to be sneaky, which is why his gym teacher had never caught him slipping out of class a few minutes early every day to shower before the other guys arrived. The teens looked at him funny when he'd be lacing up his shoes when they themselves had just walked into the locker room, but no one would get close enough to the boy to question it.
"No, dad, I did not mean council in that regard. My teammates and I were talking after practice, and they were speaking of a woman in such vulgar terms. I do not understand why they did this? Women are such beautiful and wonderful beings, why would they talk of her this way? Is it an American custom I have yet to be introduced to?" Thor looked to his family in confusion, completely unaware of the situation he just described.
"Are we off on an adventure?" he asked.
Steve chuckled before responding. “Mass is at five-thirty, so we should be ready to leave an hour before then. While we’re gone, Thor and Tony are going to stay here and light the Yule Log, usually Tony prepares us some snacks for when we return and we all sit around the fire.”
Loki shrugged, hugging his knees. “How will we know it worked?”
“No,” was the simple reply. “Money makes you uncomfortable, you wouldn’t want any more than they already give you.”
“Stop it!” Dean interrupted, shaking Loki slightly. “Just stop it! I’m done with you trying to push everyone away and putting yourself in danger instead. I’m not just gonna leave you alone while there’s a fucking ghost hurting you.”
"Can you have a seat for me?" Jody repeated.
"Hey," Dean caught the teen's arm as he passed. "You asking questions? It's a good thing, I think. Shows that you're thinking about things and want to improve. I'm sorry I can't be more help, but I can barely think straight from looking at stupid fucking words about things I couldn't care less about for the past three hours straight."
"Natasha, sweetie?"
"Surprisingly smooth?" Tony finished his husband's sentence. The two had just watched Loki leave their office after the teen apologized for his past actions, and promised to do better in the future. "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing."
want you. Hell, Sammy, every adult you even smile at loves you!"
"Soon, baby," Steve reached out to stroke the boy's face softly. "They don't really allow kids into the section of the hospital that he's in, but I'm sure we make some arrangements if we go a few at a time. We also need to make sure that he's ready first, with everything that he's been through, it might be hard for him to meet new people right away."
"I'd sleep a whole lot better after making sweet love to you, beautiful." He'd responded with. She sputtered and started lecturing him about chivalry while he smirked.
With a half sob, half laugh, Steve replied: "Yeah, Buck. It's me.
Tony closed his eyes and took a bracing breath when he read the words. "You're not broken, Natasha. You're a survivor," he explained, squeezing her hand. "Yeah, you have some trouble talking, and maybe you'll talk again, and maybe you won't. That doesn't mean you're broken, it means you're healing. And even if you do talk again, we don't expect you to be okay all the time, everyone has setbacks and it's a normal part of recovery."
"What is my punishment then?" the teen asked once the two were seated comfortably in the oak room.
"Stevie, I see you haven't been smothered by your baseball team of kids yet," the soldier smiled in response.
"What?" The engineer whipped his head up. "Why?"
Nat paused, thinking about how she was going to protect Clint, where they were going to get food and shelter and how they were even going to get clean.
"She wanted it?! Just because you wanted it, you–" Natasha was grabbed around the middle by her father before she could storm over to the boy.
Dean sat a little straighter. “No, it’s okay, you don’t have to.”
"Then the invitation is extended towards yourself as well Dean. Any time you'd like just say the word."
"Good, good, more, god more," the genius panted, pulling Steve somehow closer and pushing himself further down on the finger.
“Are you asking me if I’m clean?”
“I am!” Dean was the most aware he’d been since he first took those stupid codeine pills yesterday. He wasn’t lying.
Throughout breakfast, both Steve and Tony skillfully drew the conversation away from the boy, letting him have the time to quiet his heart and mind.
"Look, I'm not saying no, I just–" Dean began, renewing his interest in the forgotten pancakes.
The silence was deafening.
Every day as Natasha left for school, Clint begged her not to go, to stay just for that day because he missed her so much. She laughed, hugged her brother and shut the door. Every day. She had a nagging feeling that something was off, but then again, nothing really felt right to begin with.
"But, honeybunch—"
“When would you be leaving?” Bruce asked
The boys looked at each other.
Fuck I miss you. I have no idea how to handle this. Of course, they're both grounded. And suspended. Ugh, I’m gonna have to deal with them in the same house for two days by myself.
Fighting a scoff, Dean quipped: “I never thought I’d see the day, his highness prince Loki, sitting on the floor.”
“Hey,” Dean’s voice softened, his protective instincts kicking in. “Don’t worry about that. I’m watchin’ out for ya.”
"Dean, why don't you have a seat and we can—"
Dean stopped his ranting. “What?”
"Thor? Why don't you start?" Steve prompted.
“When we first started sleeping together. Actually sleeping,” Tony started. “Right before we both decided to get help.”
“No one goes through what you did and are just ‘fine’ afterwards.”
"We decided to let you two sleep in. Steve is driving everyone to school so it's just the three of us here at the moment." Tony put down the tablet and pushed his glasses up to rest in his serious case of bed head. "Grab some French toast! Have a seat!"
"There you are."
Steve nods, "Yeah, that makes sense. I guess we could just briefly talk to him about how he's doing in general? And if he mentions taking on that role, we can just reassure him that he doesn't have to."
Steve reached for Tony's hand, puppy dog eyes in full force. "Abuse Tony. We can't let them keep going through this!"
The house was easily the largest building the boys had ever stepped foot in. There were both indoor and outdoor pools, a formal dining room, a casual dining room, Tony's workshop, Steve's home office, a library (Sam's eyes had gotten as big as dinner plates trying to take in all the books so readily available to him), a home gym and Dean's personal favourite, a garage lined up with over twenty luxury cars.
The couple were preparing for bed, Steve pulling down the sheets while Tony paced the floor.
"We're only going to do what we talked about, okay Dean?" Steve began, getting Dean's attention. "No surprises, I promise."
"What?"
misses him? Not yourself?” the man noticed.
Internally sighing in relief, Dean reached out and picked up the ring as delicately as he could. “Thank you, Loki. Thank you for trusting me.”
“Yeah. Even with three pills, the side effects couldn’t last this long.” It was Tony’s turn to feel the heat radiating off the teen, and he grimaced at the sensation. “It’s not an overdose, trust me. The only thing I can think of is if he somehow took more pills since he’s been home.”
"Oh no, you take your sad eyes right out of this room, mister," Tony said sternly. "There will be no goodbyes here."
"Relax, babe, it's only still the seven," the genius winked. "Now let's get going. If we leave now, we might have time for a quickie in a back alley without the kids calling us."
"Don't you dare apologize." Tony's voice cut sharply through the room.
“Less about her, and more about you. So,” Tony leaned forward and straight-faced asked the teen: “Were you being safe?”
Also, if anyone finds any errors, please let me know, I only have one set of eyes :)
"You see? I think it was consensual. However, you can always ask Becky if you don't believe Dean," Steve explained to his daughter. "If she says anything that makes you think otherwise, tell us right away, and we'll revisit this discussion."
“Wow,” Dean commented quietly. “That’s…”
“Dean, I never did meet your father,” he began. “But, if something were to happen to Tony and I and all of you were left without a home, I would only
“Bucky, he was really like a brother to you?”
The woman studied him for a moment. “Alright. I’m gonna give it my best shot. Are you ready?”
“How are you fine with this?” Dean asked his brother, finally taking the offered mug from the engineer.
"Oof. Well if I wasn't, you collapsing on top of me isn't gonna help, ya dork." Dean teased as he hugged his brother back. "I'm just fine Sammy. You know I'm invincible!"
"Okay, Dean. I'm putting this bucket next to your bed; if you feel the need to puke, just lean over and have at 'er. I'm also putting a bottle of water on the nightstand. Do
"No thank you, Dean," Clint responded with a small smile. "I'm gonna go ask Sam to play on the xbox instead. I really only had a couple questions left." The boy picked up his things quietly and made his way out the door.
Hey everyone!! Have some escapism from the terrifying world outside!
Sam threw the covers off and hurried about the room, gathering textbooks and socks along the way before throwing open the door to a startled Tony.
The car was as gorgeous as ever with its slick black paint reflecting the overhead lights.
"Well boys, ninth time's the charm!" Mr Wilson smiled as he opened the car door for the two boys.
The boy was startled when Dean barked out a loud laugh. "You're worried because he's being nice?"
Dean looked at the other man now. The 'Mr. Coulson' that was the reason they were here. Dean didn't trust him yet. The man nodded to Dean before sitting in the desk chair a few feet away.
“Dude,” Dean sighed. “I know that this is important to you. I couldn’t imagine if I had to do this to my dad’s leather jacket, but you can’t mean that you’d be okay with getting hurt for the rest of your life! This man already hurt you when he was alive, don’t give him the satisfaction of doing it in death as well!”
"You said you wouldn't touch him," she hissed, glaring at the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He threw a remote at Loki and called him a 'smart-aleck ass'," Tony replied. Although his voice was deadpan, the captain knew the man thought it was hilarious.
The man was running on caffeine and less than three hours of sleep a night since the other man left.
I promise, no matter how long it takes, I will finish this series!
"A little help here?"
"Alright, alright," the blond laughed, and with a slicked-up finger, began circling his husband's hole, kissing his neck all the while.
“What do you mean: 'this isn’t me'? Just because I’m worried about my family-”
"Hey, what are your names?"
Bucky smiled at the excited kid. "Well let me know when you do, we can talk fantasy," he winked and moved on to look at Dean.
Steve laughed once more. "Alright, put Clint back on and you can go handle Loki. Deal?"
Dean looked at the clock that told him it was verging on midnight. "What's up, Sammy?"
Frustrated, Tony threw his hands up. “I see no reason why you can’t tell us, Dean!”
Dean's next therapy appointment couldn't come soon enough. Marching through the door and slamming it behind him, the teen exploded.
Shaking off the old command, Dean continued, “I would love to see my dad again, but Sam was doing so well that–well, I thought he could take his time coming back.”
"Honestly? I have fucking clue."
"I'm sorry love." Steve chuckled and held out his arms for Tony.
"A huge one," Steve agreed.
“You sure?” the man’s brows furled in concern, noticing the way the teen’s mind seemed far away. “I can’t help if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.”
"Natasha. Sixteen. Dance."
"What the hell do you think you're doing?"
Dean sputtered.
"Yeah, Sammy?"
Tony watched as Natasha flung herself into her papa's embrace next and thought to himself: forget becoming CEO or his wedding day, this moment. This right here? This was the happiest he's ever been.
Thor buried his little brother in a crushing hug, cutting off Loki's words. "Ég elska þig Loki. Svo mikið. Ég kenni þér ekki um hegðun þína og aðferðir til að takast á við, þú varst barn sem var að ganga í gegnum mikið. Þú ert nú fullorðinn maður sem vinnur í gegnum áfallið þitt og ég er svo stoltur af þér. Ég er alltaf stoltur af þér." {
The raven-haired teen furrowed his brows in thought. “That’s why he never hurt me when I was home. It was always when I was alone in the hallways at school, or sometimes in the car.”
"Yes."
"Mr. Singer, if we are to continue this discussion, we will do so with you sober," Tony snapped. "I highly doubt that you're pouring yourself iced tea."
"Shoot."
"Yeah, Sammy?"
Another moment of quiet. "I'm starting a prototype for his prosthesis as we speak," the engineer stated, along with the sound of more banging in the background.
sick,” Sam bluntly noted. Dean paused, then continued eating as if nothing had happened.
Loki pulled the arm back and the sleeve down to cover the bruises once more. "You can?"
"I need to know why, Loki."
Tony thought to himself as he watched his kids resume their early morning banter.
” Sam was scared. Really scared. Something must have happened, and this woman wasn’t telling him anything.
The two sat in silence, both pushing down tears.
"Hey, Dean?" Sam called into the darkness of their room.
After the last fateful therapy session, Phil Coulson reached out to the couple and told them he knew of someone that could replace her. He guaranteed that whoever they were would be able to stand Dean’s… eccentric therapy habits.
Tony smiled and nodded, leading the way when Loki stood to follow the man.
Coulson sat back down. "Of course. Ask away."
“That was awesome, Dean!” the man exclaimed as he joined Dean in the cab of the car. “You’re great at this stuff, how did you learn all of this?”
"'Tasha? Are we going to go with the nice lady?" Clint asked, pulling on her hand.
“Found a solution?” Dean questioned.
"This means that you have to give us any weapons you have now. And if you hide any, trust me we'll know," Steve said, letting go of Deans hand. "We can do that after we go through the rest of the rules."
"Do you want me to keep going?"
"Good." Dean hung his head for a moment, then looked up at Steve. "Like myself."
"Okay, stop." Tony sighed. "This is getting us nowhere."
"Why didn't you tell me?" Dean asked, wishing that his brother would just look at him already.
"I can't pretend to know what's in Natasha's mind. But we can ask her. How about we go to the gym and check up on her? Both Thor and I will be there to intervene should she want to hurt you again. Hopefully we can figure out what happened." Steve suggested.
Hook, line and sinker.
"My name is Loki, I am sixteen and I have only just moved to America," the teen replied both confidently and diplomatically.
"That's very possible," Jody conceded. "Any reason you think that?"
Dean, for his part, was starting to fall asleep again. He knew he ought to be more worried about how much he was sleeping, because of his concussion, but at the moment, he just couldn’t bring himself to care.
"Hey, did you hear me calling for you?" the woman asked with a soft expression. She started moving her hands quickly while speaking and added: "You're not deaf are you?"
"Nat, you can't keep hurting people. I know you're scared and it's worked in the past, but these people, they aren't going to hurt you," the man pleaded with her.
"You've got one heck of a family there, Stevie."
"Dean, are you really okay?" Sam asked as the two were getting ready for bed.
“Really? Okay then,” Dean shrugged. “Any chance we could join the four of you?” he asked Steve.
"If you're sure," Steve started, pulling his finger out before pushing two back in. Tony swung his head back and groaned, letting the sensation fill him up, thrusting down slightly.
? I’ve basically abandoned you and the kids and because of me, Bucky is going into a potentially life-threatening surgery and you’re saying that I should be focusing on
"Hey Buck," Steve beamed when he saw his best friend sitting up in his bed.
Also, a very big thank you and a huge welcome to my wonderful and amazing new beta for this series: Apollos_Meatballs!!!
Tony and Steve smiled. "We still want you go. Moving around a lot can be really stressful, and sometimes it can help to have someone to just listen to you."
“How old were you when you had sex for the first time?”
"Sam, can you please tell Tony what you told me?" His voice unwavering.
"Bye, Papa!" The kids called out, waving enthusiastically behind Tony as the man reached to disconnect the call.
"Speculating on your sex life. Are you the bottom or is he? I could easily see both ways. Oh! That's it isn't it! You switch!" Dean was laughing as Steve's face grew redder and redder.
He had it all planned out. The next morning, while packing his bag for school, he put in a few extra supplies. Along with his textbooks, Dean's backpack now held a container of salt, the exorcism ritual, the rosary, a water bottle full of holy water, and the one knife he'd been allowed to keep. Thank god it was silver.
After a moment of pure shock, Tony placed his plate in the microwave and watched it spin. He thought about how wonderful his found family really was, and how much he couldn’t wait until things went back to normal.
Another shake. No.
“Aren’t you gonna ask me about why I didn’t tell anyone I was hurt? Where I got the codeine from? How I’m doing after my dad died? Me drinking the other night? I know Steve and Tony tell you everything,” the teen slumped in his chair, resigned to his fate of an uncomfortable hour listening to how ‘
“It doesn’t matter if they’re better than the ones you’ve had, if they hurt you once, it’s too many.” The man tried to explain to the distraught child.
Steve stayed there, holding Dean’s hand, until the rest of the kids came home from school. Sam poked his head through the bedroom door, giving Steve a look equal parts confusion and surprise when he saw the man sitting so close to his lax brother. Steve simply raised a finger to his lips, then gestured for the boy to come forward.
The men realized their poor phrasing when the teen startled and pushed away from the table. "NO! God no! Not that!" they assured him.
Startled, Dean replied, "How did you–"
"Sir, you might want to wait—"
The younger boy stared intently at the teen, knowing that he could spot any lie his brother gave. Finally, Sam smiled. "Then yeah. I think I am gonna let them adopt me."
"Thanks, Dean, I guess I'm just worried. I'm gonna go to bed now. Good night."
"Well, they must have a good reason not to tell you then."
"I fear for how our newest siblings might have fared had we not welcomed them into our home." The usually bubbly man was subdued in his report, bracing himself on the back of Clint's chair. "They must not be placed in such situations again, and I will keep them from harm in whichever way that I can."
This question Dean was expecting, but that didn’t make it any easier to answer. Staring at his hands, the teen remained silent. The room was quiet once more while the minutes slipped by.
"Disgust–? Natasha, what are you talking about?" Steve blinked in confusion.
“Yes, Steve,” Tony responded immediately. “Because, honestly, you’re starting to scare me, babe. This isn’t you.”
Steve and Tony had both shown up at the principal's office to take him home, Dean didn't think he'd ever felt as ashamed in his entire life as he did when he saw their faces.
The breakfast table was always a busy place in the Stark household. Every morning was exactly the same: Clint rushed to finish whatever homework he’d forgotten was due that day, Thor and Steve shoveled food into their mouths as if they hadn’t eaten in months, and Tony collapsed against the counter near his coffee machine, hissing like an angry cat until his ‘liquid of the gods’ was available for consumption. Nat, of course, sat quietly at the table, the calm in the middle of the storm.
"I haven't decided yet," the teen answered. "Come on, Sam, are you gonna let them adopt you or what?"
swore would protect us!” The teen was shaking with anger.
"Oh." Sam whispered. The men saw that he was deep in thought, and simply waited for him to process the information. "Do you think my dad could stop drinking like you did Tony?"
Steve smiled at his eldest. "You're completely right. The next time you hear anyone talking like that about anyone you tell them why they shouldn't, okay? Stick up for people especially if they aren't there to defend themselves."
"That's a great idea Thor, maybe you could play a practice round with him some time." Steve smiled at his eldest while still looking at Dean. "So Nat, how was your English test today?"
“Yeah, Mr. Coulson knows what he’s doing, but I’m sure even he would have trouble putting salt in every window casing at school,” Dean quipped.
"Are you sure you want to do this today Bucky?" Steve asked for the third time. "They'll understand if you're not up to it."
“No. No that’s not stupid at all, Sammy, I thought the same thing!” Dean whispered back. “Every year I thought ‘this might be the year’, but it never was.”
“Woah,” Tony raised a hand to calm down the other man. “Steve, have you seen Dr. Phillips at all since your tech came back? Had a video session or anything like that?”
Bucky squeezed his friend's hand and smiled, then let go to offer his only hand in Tony's direction. "Sergeant James Bucannan Barnes, of the US army, and this punk's best friend."
"Loki," Dean made sure to look directly at the other boy, "I don't know what to think right now, only that someone's hurting you. Whatever you tell me next, I'm going to believe as long as it's not 'I'm okay' or 'it's not what you think'."
She nodded and winced at the pain radiating through her head. Slowly sitting up, she realized the two of them were in a closet.
"Becky Walters? Seriously? She's my age! That's disgusting Dean, you pervert!" She shouted at her foster brother.
Steve pulled his husband onto his lap to hold him from behind. Tony shifted to make himself more comfortable, not fazed at all to be sitting on the captain.
Dean was confused. Surely that comment had to have offended the couple, why didn't they react?
The genius pouted at his husband and murmured, "Jerk." Steve only laughed in return.
Steve was worried about Dean. Really worried. He hadn’t known the brothers for more than three months, but he just knew that Dean and drugs didn’t add up. The history professor’s morning went by in a blur, and before he knew it, he was back home, climbing the stairs.
"Self harm? What like if I'm gonna kill myself?" Dean laughed. "I may have a shit life but I promise you I'm not suicidal."
"In that case," the blond pulled back to rest his forehead against Tony's. "I'm gonna make you feel me until I come back. It'll be like I never left."
that there was a family that loved you as much as we do to take you in and take care of you. And to give you the love and attention that you deserve.”
Making their way upstairs to Steve's office, the soldier stopped, pulling his husband close once more. "Are you sure about this?" he asked, his lips inches from Tony's.
get to take us away from the only home that’s actually felt like a home since the one our mother went up in flames in.”
Dean sighed and walked over to his brother, placing his hands on the boy’s shoulders. “Hey, I’m sorry I ruined the mood. Let’s take a page out of Steve and Tony’s book and just not care about what anyone else believes in, yeah?”
"Dean," Jody sighed a little, collecting her thoughts. "We've already established that you have problems with your self-esteem. Maybe if someone reminds you when you're hard on yourself, it'll be easier to recognize when you're having these thoughts and you can start taking the steps to correct them."
"You— you've been what? Psychoanalyzing me?" Dean's voice rose just a little, beginning to panic. If he couldn't hide things from Sam anymore, how could he protect him?
Startled at the discovery, she didn't hear Steve offer her the bowl of popcorn the first time.
"Stupid fucking olive branch. Could make some expensive ass meals with it instead but no, just have to offer it to–"
The next few days proved exceedingly busy, filled with recitals, football games and parent-teacher meetings, but Steve and Tony managed to keep an eye out for any behavioral changes in Dean. They were not disappointed.
"Their mother died when Dean was four…" Steve started.
“Sam I think it would be better if you stayed here, we’re not sure how long we’re going to be.” Tony was already behind the wheel of a 2018 Rolls-Royce, watching Steve climb in the backseat, still cradling the half-responsive boy.
“I mean with all I’ve put you through, a few punches doesn’t seem like anything, now does it.” Chin resting on his chest, the teen avoided eye contact with the family that, until a moment ago, was having fun.
"Because our son wants him
"But I don't-"
The boy sniffed again and nodded.
"I'm sorry about her!" Clint shouted suddenly.
Dean's chest felt like it was collapsing. He was hiding just around the corner, like a coward. Of course she thought he was a monster, why wouldn't she? Everyone else thought he was a dangerous good-for-nothing, so that's what he was.
"Hey, hey!" Dean walked over to Sam and pulled his little brother into a crushing hug. "I know you and dad had your differences, but he loves you. He would never
“Oh, I forgot to mention, Bruce and Clint’s therapists mentioned that they might benefit from a joint session. Something about shared experiences.” Tony informed his husband.
"I could ask the same of you," Loki responded nonchalantly, returning to his laptop.
"Oh, oh honey are you sure?" Tony began wiping the streaks of tears on Steve's cheeks. "We don't have to do anything tonight, it's okay."
"I know what's going on! He's haunting you!" Dean's smile only got bigger as he explained.
"So, you had sex in school, because your therapist told you you shouldn't." Tony clarified.
Tony was attempting to video chat. Accepting the call, Steve pulled the phone further from his face to properly see his husband.
"Yes, Nat, you heard him right. We
"What, do you want me to pull up the security tapes? You don't-"
, Dean Winchester, are the furthest thing from useless. You hear me?"
"Why did he say something about the others and not that one?" Tony was now listening intently to the former CPS worker.
"Bucky!"
"Come on, Bobby, pick up," he whispered as he brought the phone to his ear. Dean figured that if anyone knew where their dad was, it was Bobby. However, the phone didn't even have a chance to ring. Instead, an automated voice could be heard saying that the number was "no longer in service," and to try again. So he did. And he tried again. And again. And again.
I'M BAAACCKKKKK
"Tony!" Steve chided.
Natasha and Clint both flat-out refused to leave the other alone with unknown adults. Thor also protested, explaining how Bruce had trouble speaking to authority figures and demanding that he be allowed to stay with him–to avoid ‘a lot of unnecessary problems.’
Loki shrugged. "So?"
“Do you want to talk about any of that?” Jody asked.
The blond continued, tracing down his stomach and slowly unzipped his pants, letting every sound it made echo through the room, building anticipation. Undoing the button, Steve pushed the pants down an inch or so, just enough for his pubic hair to peek out and leaving the top of his crease exposed. Turning back around to face his husband, Steve ran his hand down his front, letting his thumb get caught in the tent poking through his undone clasp.
, Dean thought. "No."
"I'm so sorry I'm leaving so soon after you got here," the blond apologized.
The captain snorts out a humourless laugh. "Well, that's helpful."
“I already know what happened.” Phil Coulson was seated in the plastic chair at the side of Dean’s bed, posed perfectly in the picture of authority.
"No. No, I haven't heard from him or about him for a couple of years now." The man sounded tired–not as rough and gruff as Dean remembered.
“You never know!”
"I'm here to make a deal." The boy states after taking a bracing breath.
"What are we gonna do 'Tasha?"
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Tony responded, solemnly. “Any updates at all?”
Nodding seriously, Steve replied, "Pudding it is," then returned to the conversation as if nothing had happened.
“It sounds like you were really close,” the man observed. “What happened?”
Seeing tears beginning to well in the teen's eyes, Mr. Coulson moved his hands to rub Dean's shoulders. "Hey, hey.
“Dean! We’ve seen things that most people couldn’t even dream about!” Sam’s voice matching the teen’s, all thoughts of getting dressed gone.
"I—I—I didn't—" the teen sputtered.
Fucking fuckity fucking fuck.
Without warning, Tony sucked the entire finger into his mouth, sucking forcefully and causing Steve to all but buck into the air at the feeling.
Natasha did not respond. Mr. Coulson was a kind man, had always kept to his side of the desk and had never even attempted to get her to speak, but he was still an adult man. Adults weren't to be trusted, let alone men. Men only brought pain and cruel tricks.
Steve's eyes shot up, finding the man immediately. The lieutenant didn't realize his superior had heard him and sat straight up when he noticed the man's eyes on him. "Sir?"
Happy Posting Day! And a very Happy Halloween to those that celebrate it!
“Phil didn’t tell me anything. I actually knew your dad, John.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow.
"You have no idea how much I've missed you, kids," Steve whispered, basking in the glow of his family.
Steve furled his eyebrows in concern. "Tony, why didn't you tell me all this in your letters?"
"What?" It was Loki's turn to be in utter confusion.
"Either he's a genius or he's an idiot," the gruff voice murmured, still chuckling. "Alright. No, Sam and Dean are not going to be in danger for 'leaving' our 'way of life'. With our...gang... anyone can come and go as they wish. Doesn't mean that when they get older the things they know aren't gonna bite them in the ass though."
"Okay, we went through Nats ballet rehearsal, so that leaves you Dean! How was your day?" Steve inquired.
Tony looked to Steve then, breaking 'character' and said "we're definitely coming back to that later. But for now," he settled in again, staring at Dean unwavering once again. "Bet you never had supermodel cunt before. And you haven't lived until you've gotten a rim job."
Sam had chosen to hyphenate his last name to Winchester-Stark, while the couple had adamantly assured Dean that they were perfectly fine with him keeping his, and if he ever wanted to change it, to only let them know.
"Yes, Clint?"
"Well, it looks like y'all are gonna starve."
"Of course, what is it Dean?" Tony's eyes widened in surprise as he sat up further in their bed. The men watched Dean come further in the room, closing the door behind him and leaning against it.
"Pfft," the teen huffed. "'Love'. You don't even know me," he mumbled under his breath.
“I told on him.” Sam’s head was hung low, his bangs hiding most of his features. Steve ran his hand over the boy’s hair, pushing the strands out of the way.
“When I–yeah, I remember that. Why?” The teen was truly confused as to why they were talking about his lack of coordination. “I was feverish and the concussion didn’t help, why–”
"Papa?"
"Talk to Loki yet?"
“He– he told me to ‘play the little rich kid game’. To forget about him and move on,” Dean spat, eyebrows furled in frustration.
Steve beamed and turned to look at the door, as if he expected them to come back. "They really are, aren't they? And they love you Bucky!"
Nat shook her head.
Tony nodded and started dialling, racing to the garage to do as he was told.
” Steve pressed.
"Welcome!" Came a booming voice from behind them. Dean sprang up into a fighting stance, ready to protect Sammy.
"You little—" the man reached for her neck, wanting to strangle the young girl. Before he could, she darted between his legs and climbed up his back, feeling him struggle to get a good hold of her to throw her off. Natasha pushed down her fear of the man and focused entirely on Clint's safety. She didn't matter. Clint did.
“I was twenty one when I lost both of my parents in a car crash,” Tony revealed when Sam turned his gaze to the man.
"How are you faring, young scholar?" Thor asked, resting a hand on the boy's shoulder. "With the demise of your father."
Sitting up and sticking out his tongue, Steve stood on the bed and turned around, swaying his hips slowly and running his hands over his ass. "This what you want, babe?" he asked, looking over his shoulder to see Tony practically salivating. Reaching up to his chest, Steve pinched one of his nipples and whimpered, his knees almost giving out in pleasure.
Dr. Hill said to make sure you accept.
“Alcohol? I haven’t had a sip of alcohol since I came here! I would never bring booze into an alcoholic’s house!” Dean was close to shouting. Though his eyes were still glassy with fever, he was now alert and pissed at the implication that he’d do something so stupid.
Tony quickly stood up and knelt by the thirteen-year-old. "Hey, don't you worry about that. What did we say earlier, huh? They aren't going anywhere. In fact-" the man paused and glanced back towards his husband. "How would all of you feel if we invited them to stay permanently?"
"So? Are you gonna accept?"
"Sam, Dean, this is Phil Coulson. He was my superior at CPS. It's because of him that we were able to get you a spot here!"
to be with someone I don't know. Because if they do know me, they wouldn't want me so close."
“I don’t care.”
He heard the boy sigh dramatically, then shuffle over to his parents. Clint was shorter than Dean, certainly, but not much taller than Sam, with short blond spiky hair and a lopsided grin that spoke of unseen mischief. He waved at the brothers and introduced himself, then turned to his fathers.
The teen shrugged, avoiding eye contact.
"The rich genius husband, I presume?"
But I hope everyone is staying safe, sane and healthy!!
As always, if you find any mistakes, please let me know so I can correct them! Enjoy!
Thor chuckled softly and tightened his hold. "Myndi ekki láta mig dreyma um það." {
Dean looked around the room at the faces of the makeshift family. Clint gave an uncharacteristically small smile, revealing how hard the boy actually took the disappearance, but was adamant that he forgave the older boy. Natasha nodded seriously, Thor was grinning ear to ear, Tony gave him a goofy thumbs-up, Bruce nodded with a small smile, and Sam was simply beaming at seeing his brother receive so much support.
"I don't need anyone to protect me," she started, glaring at the two other teens before her gaze softened ever so slightly. "But thank you, nonetheless."
"Tony's started designing a mechanical prosthetic for when the amputation is healed," the blond said, changing the subject. "He insists."
Steve ran his hand over Dean’s forehead and back through his sweaty hair, noting with relief how the boy didn’t even flinch at the touch.
Steve smiled and kissed the man's hip bone before sucking his husband's dick down until it bumped his throat. Concentrating, he took a deep breath and swallowed the head into his throat.
“Hardly,” Tony’s voice rang from the kitchen before appearing himself, joining the others in the living room. “We picked too many.”
Dean was quiet as he stared at Tony, Steve once more rubbing his back. The teen nodded slowly.
"You sure you're ready for this old man?" He asked, already feeling more secure than he had since he got here.
The man furrowed his brows together at hearing their native language and sat back down on the desk chair. "Bróðir, hvað er að?" {
"I talked to Dr. Mills, and she said that we need to establish boundaries," the teen rushed out, dropping his gaze to the floor.
Tony sighed and ran a hand over his face. "We thought that's why you might have been acting out. Maybe you were tired of waiting to get hit so you moved it along a little."
Sam smiled and laughed quietly at the teen. “Of course you’d see the destruction in it.”
Nodding slightly, Steve's heart stopped for a second, knowing he shouldn't have expected Loki to see him in that role just yet. "May I give you a hug before I leave?"
The man smiled slightly, stepping forward to embrace Mr Wilson. "Good to see you too. And you know I'm bored out of my mind!" He replied with a well meaning punch to his friends' arm. Mr Wilson turned back towards the boys.
The two heard a roaring laugh come from outside the door.
“Because that’s not how God works!”
Finally, Steve stood up and asked Dean "how much combat do you know?"
"Bring it."
“We don’t know anything yet Bruce, as soon as we do— no Clint, this isn’t an excuse to get out of doing your homework, I know you have an English project due and— don’t do that to yourself, Nat, I almost guarantee it wasn’t you that caused it, the fever didn’t start until the next day and— oh my god thank you Thor. You’re being a huge help right now and your papa and I really appreciate it.”
"It feels good to be wanted, to be pulled closer instead of pushed away. It's–it's an experience that
"Woah!" Dean leaned in to look at it. "That was what, three years ago?"
Her once favourite colour was now the source of her nightmares, fueling her fear and hatred for the men that hurt her and the unjust world that let them.
"He said what?" Tony squeaked, his work completely abandoned.
Now he just had to find the hunters.
“But I’m not! Not really!” The teen was becoming agitated at the insistence of the men.
Shaking his head in disbelief Dean returned to his seat in front of the woman.
"Yeah. It wasn't great, but…" Sam shrugged as he trailed off.
The boxers were already wet with precum, Steve sucked at the material until it was so wet with spit it clung to every ridge beneath it. Only then did he reach up and rip the material down at the seams, leaving scraps behind as the cock jumped up in enthusiasm.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked again, impatient.
The brunette rose up from the blow job, and with a parting kiss on the head of the dick, he dropped it to slap wetly against Steve's stomach. "You know what else is mine?" he growled out in his wrecked voice.
“Shh, baby, breathe.” Tony abandoned his anger and rushed to kneel in front of his husband. “It’s gonna be alright. We just have to make them see that we would never hurt a child. It’s not going to be that bad! Sweetie, we have the best kids in the entire world. They’ll tell the courts that we would never!” the engineer comforted the weeping man. “Everything’s gonna turn out just fine.”
"Fucking hell!" Dean exclaimed when he heard the voice coming from the shadows of the pantry. "There's a light switch ya know!"
"Come in!" Thor's booming voice called out.
to get dressed up for this?” Dean muttered. “I mean it’s not like god is gonna smite us if we show up in jeans.”
A lot of the dialogue in this chapter is straight from an episode of Supernatural, bonus point if you can tell me which one!!!!
“We’re leaving.” The teen growled.
Tony pulled Steve down to kiss him again deeply. "Good. Now, about that mind-blowing sex," he whispered, tracing a hand up the soldier's shirt, outlining the man's muscles.
Dean shook the hand off him, but didn't leave just yet.
“You can’t apologize for how people react, Dean, only for your own actions. What to try that again?” Steve interjected.
Sam finally turned his head to look at his hero. "But will you stay?"
“You want Sam to have a good and normal Christmas. You want to give him a good gift and see the happiness in his eyes as he opens it. You want him to forget about the death of your father and have a happy memory.”
Dean opened his eyes and saw Thor with a struggling Nat in his arms, fighting him to get to Dean.
Dean shook his head then, furiously at first, before wincing and slowing to a stop. Clenching his eyes shut again, the teen forced out, “No, that’s all Sam. Yeah, he can get in a real bitchy mood once in a while, but he’s basically sunshine on wheels. And his brain? That’s what’s gonna make him successful. As long as he keeps reading his nerd books, that kid will be whatever he wants.”
Steve sighed.
This was met with nods from everyone except Loki.
Nat was too tired to argue. It wasn't like she couldn't find something else to bring back the colour and the numb.
Bucky frowned playfully. "How do you know what I'm interested in? You homophobic, Stevie? What if I got converted in those stinkin' cells?"
Dean looked up in surprise. Dr. Mills was a no-nonsense person, she'd never said something like that before.
Steve smiled. “Alright then. If you change your mind just let us know. In the meantime, help us decorate this unnecessarily huge house!”
The rest of the table thoroughly distracted, Steve took the chance to get Dean's attention. "Hey, I know this is a lot, do you need to call Dr. Mills?" he whispered.
“You ever drink?” She asked him, her voice void of any judgments, as if she couldn’t care less about the answer.
"My name is Sam, I'm turning twelve next week and I love to read."
"Steve?" a groggy voice came from the speaker. The screen was still dark, although Steve could see shapes moving vaguely.
"Of course, love. Let me know when you're ready and we'll spar all you need to." The man smiled, proud that Dean had the courage to ask for what he needed.
“And I couldn’t have done it without that decision.” Tony chimed in. “Is this about you and Dean?”
Tony revelled in the feeling of his husband's chest, flattening his hands over abs and around pecs and raking his fingernails down the soldier's nipples and feeling him suck just a little harder. The engineer gasped and threw his head back when he felt Steve bite his collarbone.
The engineer surged up and kissed the other man. "Yes, please, oh my god, yes."
Dean thought about having to sit through another almost painful therapy session.
Tony nodded. “I think I need a couple more sessions too.”
Tony slowly rotated his head to stare at his idiotic husband, to which the man smiled sheepishly and shrugged.
“Will you ever willingly do drugs that were not prescribed to you again?”
Why did Dean have to interrupt them in bed? If he had just done it after dinner they wouldn't be coming down right now. The beating was always less right after dinner, they were too full to have any actual energy. And now-
"Pfft, I thought you knew by now, husband-dearest, I'm never wrong!"
Steve's face was pinched in concern, before shaking himself and started explaining gay relationships to Sam. He was very calm and sported a smile the entire time. Answering any questions the young by had.
"I love you too, Sammy," Dean whispered, barely loud enough for Sam to hear.
Dean looked from Tony, to Steve, and lastly to Sam, who was too busy asking Bruce about the swirly thing on the cover of a science textbook to notice the commotion. After a moment, he dropped his head in defeat and shuffled towards the stairs.
"And now we talk about why. Why did you say those things, Loki?" the engineer sighed. "Clint is already so self-conscious about how smart he is, you had to have known you were saying things that were hurtful."
Dean clutched at his side and felt the blood sticking to his shirt. Fuck, it hurt. He didn't quite arrive at the hunt when he planned to; instead, he found the hunter just starting to take on the pack of werewolves. He couldn't just
The man opened his phone and wordlessly asked if he could read the message out loud, which Natasha answered with a nod.
“Whatever may be happening, I am confident that our parents will inform us when they feel we must know.”
“Do you think he’s old enough to be having sex Dean?”
“You’re turning fifteen in a week, you can start learning how to drive soon. Happy Birthday, kid.” Tony smiled, wrapping an arm around his son’s shoulders.
“He was my protégé, Dean. I tell him to trust me, and he will.” Mr. Coulson smirked; the look spoke of untold memories shared between the two colleagues.
"Go put on some workout clothes and meet me in the gym." He told the teen.
"Dean, you don't have to tell him all of your secrets. Hell, you don't have to do anything at all, but giving Sam those tools to figure out what's really going on is only going to help him, both now and in the future." Jody once again gestured for Dean to sit, which he finally decided to do.
"You, sir, are only getting better at that," Tony said between kisses.
"Dean has this ever happened before?" Steve asked.
"Okay, enough of this, what's the damage?" Bucky asked, steeling himself.
Dean raised his brows in a silent question. "Me? Pfft. I have a lot to say on the matter, but nothing's gonna change your mind so why bother."
Happy Posting Day!! Enjoy the feels!
“What?” the thirteen-year-old stared at the man in confusion.
"No, Clint," Natasha bent down to look into the man's lifeless eyes to convince herself as much as her brother. A strange numbness had overtaken her. The anger and the fear she had felt was just… gone. "He's dead."
“What do you want for Christmas, Dean?” Dr. Mills (
Steve, however, noticed something. "We should get the two of you into some extra curriculars now that you've had a chance to see what they are." He threw the idea out there and waited to see Dean's reaction. "Sam I'm sure you would love the science club, or the decathlon team or something like that. I hear there's even a book club if you're interested."
“Why don’t we talk for a bit, Dean? Get your mind off of it,” Steve suggested.
“I’ll start talking to Dr. Philips again,” he conceded. “I think I’ll probably need to start up every couple days or so, maybe more until I’ve gotten things under control again.”
A long, deep sigh came from the phone. "Dean, this is your chance to get out of the life. You're still young; you've got your whole life ahead of ya! Carry holy water and a knife at all times, but forget we exist!"
"I need Bobby Singer's new number," Dean explained. "Please tell me you know it."
Tony's words hung over a silent room as the two took deep breaths to calm themselves.
"One gun. Unloaded in a box under my bed," Dean negotiated.
“How about we try again?” Tony suggested. “We could see Dr. Cho again, you liked her right?”
The teen nodded.
"We're gonna miss you too, Steve," the teen said softly. Before opening the door, Dean paused. "You come back, alright? You do everything you can to come back to us. We need our Papa."
He paused. “It’s the only thing I have left of my mother’s.”
“That day is for presents!” Clint screamed from across the room. He and his siblings came in carrying even more boxes labelled “Holidays”.
"Alright, next. Bedtimes. Sam, in bed by nine, Dean, ten thirty on school nights, midnight on weekends. We don't care if you're asleep at those times but you need to be in bed. Read a book, do some homework, whatever you want as long as you're in bed." Tony continued.
"Dean?"
"Not as much as I'm going to miss you," the soldier whispered back.
Steve shook his head.
“Firstly, it is anything but ‘boring’,” Steve began, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes. “Secondly, I don’t really think you wanna hear about our gay sex.”
"Really? He told you about how he bought out a restaurant and bribed the chef?" Steve smiled and hugged Tony from behind.
“It’s because you’ve looked out for him that that he has a chance to be a kid and to have a successful future.”
“This isn’t the first time you’ve gotten drugs from this source, is it?” Tony accused.
Shout out to morrismsteph!!
“Dean, you look
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked, voice low.
"Sorry," Dean frowned. "It's just been so long since I've even heard about a hunt. It feels good to go back to my roots, ya know?"
"We missed you so much, Papa!" Sam said, a huge smile on his face.
"You know what else is mine?" the genius continued, then snaked his hand down to grasp the captain's full erection. "This. This is mine. I don't care who else has touched it or how many times you play with it, but who does it belong to?"
“Dean–”
“This will destroy the ring, won’t it?” Loki whispered, staring at the unlit wood.
The teen remained quiet.
There was a small scuffle at the other end. "Dad is being mean and took mine away, so I took his!"
Clint rolled his eyes. “It’s ‘why the
Loki sighed and began pacing the edges of the room, almost refusing to look at his brother. "Ekkert er að en þetta kemur mér ekki auðveldlega fyrir sjónir. Fyrirgefðu vanhæfni mína." {
"What does BS mean?" Sam asked. Steve gave Tony a pointed 'look what you did now' look as Tony sputtered.
Christmas had passed in a flurry of food and presents, more than Sam and Dean had ever seen in their lives. The cheerful atmosphere was a pleasant distraction for the boys, for the week after held the funeral of their father. Upon discussion with the brothers, Mr. Coulson, Tony, and Steve had decided to have the funeral in Kansas and lay him to rest next to the boy’s mother.
"I love you so much, darling."
"Dean, that backpack looks heavier than usual today. Got any big projects due?" Steve asked as everyone climbed into the vehicle to start the morning commute.
SURPRISE! AGAIN!
“Sam, sweetheart, I promise you did the right thing! Who knows what could’ve happened if you didn’t tell us!” There were tears starting to pool in the boy’s eyes as Steve spoke.
“Maybe too smart.” Tony saw fear in Dean’s eyes as the teen stared at him.
After writing another letter to his husband, Tony had a mental list of things he needed to do, starting with making dinner and the kid's lunches, and ending with check-ups for Thor and Sam.
“Lose the kids? Is he serious, Tony?” Steve gaped at the door Mr. Wilson had just slammed shut behind him.
"No, I barely had time to pry the little munchkin's phone out of his hand before he betrayed me and called you."
"You took me in because of my brother, and I appreciate it, I do, but you can stop pretending now. It'll just be easier on everyone," Loki responded, matter of factly, wrapping his arms around himself in a sort of makeshift hug.
By the time he returned to their room, it was five o'clock in the morning. Exhausted, Dean crawled into bed and set his eyes on their door, determined to protect Sammy.
"Jesus, Sammy!" Dean threw a pillow at his little brother, who was staring at the teen not two feet from his face.
"Patience, love. Don't wanna hurt you," Steve muttered, biting Tony's ear.
But as much his body longed to slip into a peaceful slumber, his mind was reeling.
Dreaming made it worse. Steve and Tony locked even the butter knives in a safe after a particularly bad dream found her once again in the bathroom bleeding, just staring at the blood and letting the colour cloud everything in her mind.
"Clinton Francis Stark. You pause your game and get over here." Steve's voice was firm and calm.
"What?"
The table was silent for a moment, everyone returning to their breakfasts silently.
As always, thank you so much to all of my wonderful readers, your kudos and comments continue to fuel my love of this series and the characters.
Clint nodded seriously. "Good. We need our Uncle Bucky to not be sick."
Sam tilted his head. "What's French toast?"
didn't deserve you in the first place."
“He said, ‘if we’re found guilty,’ Steve. We didn’t do anything, so they can’t take anyone,” Tony growled as he began pacing the length of the conference room.
to keep that kid safe!” Dean paused, his chest heaving.
Steve smiled and nipped at Tony's lip before licking it, asking for entry. Groaning at the taste, Steve licked at the inside of his husband's mouth, wanting to memorize every detail of the love of his life. Sinking further into the kiss, he felt Tony sigh, giving all control to the blond and simply basking in the arms of his husband. Moving down, Steve began sucking at Tony's neck, not caring enough to hide the marks.
Shaking his head, Dean denied the opportunity to tell the man how they all knew each other, instead, he went for a less dangerous, and possibly more relevant route. “They drink. A lot.”
"And what did you say about your father?" Steve prompted.
"Alright, enough of this, your family is waiting for you and I have a nap waiting for me," Bucky sighed as he pushed the other man away.
Dean slowly shook the man's hand as he took in the information.
fell quiet once again.
Thor tore his gaze away from Dean to look at the fire. “I should like to celebrate this next year with my brother. He tells me the hospital he stays in does not allow fire on the premises and has watched me light this fire on video every year we’ve been separated,” the man finished.
“Uncle Bobby!” Sam shouted in excitement, running towards a bearded man in a worn baseball hat and a flannel shirt under an unzipped vest.
Steve sighed and hunched over to rest his chin on his hand. “Yeah, they’re taking him in for surgery soon to see what can be done for the infection in his arm, they’re just waiting for him to be more stable so they don’t risk him-”
“Well, thank you, Dean,” Tony squeezed the teen’s shoulder softly. “I really appreciate it. And who made your lunches? I hope you didn’t all make your own,” he said, pointedly mock glaring at Clint, who had once tried to bring nothing but candy to school.
"What are you learning about in your classes?" Tony asked, trying to get more information from the boy.
Life was actually INSANE this past week and this is the first time I've even been able to sit down and open my laptop!!
Loki was quiet for a moment, then answered. "They said things about Natasha."
SO SO SORRY FOR THE WAIT!!!
The room was quiet.
The other teen’s eyes shot up in shock.
Dean cleared his throat. “Okay, enough with the chick-flick moment.”
“My darling boy,” Tony whispered. He raced across the room and enveloped the boy in as tight a hug as he dared. “We were so worried about you.”
Tony, watching Dean’s stiff posture and eyes still trained on the ground. He wasn’t at ease just yet. “And who was it that called you about the funeral, Mr. Singer?”
"So he just needed to let out some steam?" Tony questioned.
“Don’t you worry about them, dear. Everything’s going to be fine,” she responded, giving him a smile.
Hello, my wonderful readers! It's my birthday today, and as a gift from me to you, enjoy a new chapter, and a final chapter count on this fic!
"How can I help Sam if we don't talk about you, Dean?" she asked, calmly. "You're his hero, his protector."
Dean didn’t have to wait for long. A knock interrupted the teen’s thoughts, and Mr. Wilson popped his head through the doorway, his tired smile masking an exhausted man. “Hey, Dean.”
"Yeah, of course I do! My dad, my birth dad, that is, he used to hunt ghosts!"
Tony raised his arms between the blondes. "Okay we are getting off topic. Bottom line, you wanna hurt yourself in any way, you tell us first. Fair?"
"Well it had to come from somewhere! Anyways, if you want any features on the phone just let me know and I'll make it happen." Tony winked at Dean playfully. Dean eyed Tony strangely.
"Natasha, what do you mean he took advantage of her?" He spoke calmly and carefully, as if approaching a wild animal.
"Mr. Singer, we have one more question for you," Steve started.
"I can imagine." The two made their way into the main office of the school, and the woman directed Dean towards a row of chairs. "Have a seat now, dear, take a break from your adventure."
"Clint," Dean spoke, "You don't have to go. Come sit over here to finish your work."
"Gee, thanks, Miss!" Dean plopped himself down in a chair and was suddenly fascinated with the carpet pattern. He blinked, and a man appeared. "Tony!"
Confirmation received, Steve folded himself around the teen, holding tightly and feeling Dean melt into the embrace.
"I'm guessing it's whatever's on that necklace. We need to cover it in salt and burn it. Once we do, and if we're right about the object, he'll go away forever and stop hurting you!" The blond was practically jumping out of his seat in excitement.
"Cremated," Loki responded hesitantly.
Steve smiled and obliged. Pushing in slowly, the man let his husband get used to the full feeling, stopping at every tense and gasp until he was fully seated inside. He gave the other man a minute, holding himself back from the wonderful feeling until getting the nod to continue.
It had been about a month and a half since Bucky was rescued, and to say that the man had problems would be an understatement. The terrors in his mind caused him to blackout and relive the torture, or other times he just shut down completely, so the times where he felt like himself, he jumped at the opportunity to meet his best friend's world.
Dean’s jaw dropped. “But–but I took drugs! You had every right to yell at me!”
“Now what’s the matter?”
Climbing in the luxury car, Dean held his breath as he inserted the key and turned the engine. At the sound of the smooth purr, Dean’s face broke out into a huge smile, laughing at the cheering Tony was making from behind the hood.
plan whatsoever.
Dean sputtered, feeling bombarded. “What? I–”
“Yeah I got a condom.”
She nodded. The colour faded just the smallest amount, as did the fear.
"With the years of counseling I have ahead of me? Maybe, but I don't wanna go to my kid's high school grad when I'm fucking sixty," Bucky laughed. "But what I'm trying to say is, that you having those kids? Me being an-an uncle… Well, it's something that was meant to be, and so far, it's just as good."
Ironically, the siblings' case file was the colour that tormented Natasha every second. Mr. Coulson sighed as he looked through the folder for what seemed like the thousandth time.
“Thor? Can I ask you something?” Sam inquired, wringing his hands.
"You-" Dean sputtered for a moment. "You're offering to help me with my homework?"
Steve laughed and leaned down to kiss the man softly. "I told you he was a genius."
Thor resembled a giant puppy as he gleefully smiled at the boys before heading up the entryway stairs.
“Dean wake up!” Steve shouted, beginning to panic.
Tony grabbed his husband's hand and squeezed in excitement. "You betcha! And Sam, of course. Now, we realize this isn't the best time what with just coming back from your dad's funeral and looking through his things, but Dean," the engineer paused, leaning towards the teen, "we've known we wanted you to stay since your first time sparring with Steve."
Dean shook his head and took his hand away quickly. He just sat for a moment, his hand posed in the air close to his chest. He studied the two closely as they looked at him, Tony's hand just hovering above where he had held Deans hand. After a moment, he buried his face in his hands on his lap and groaned.
Thor smiled.
He grabbed the salt and matches and set himself up beside the fireplace, logs ready to be burnt and doused with a small layer of lighter fluid to make sure the item burned completely. Out of his periphery, he saw Loki slowly make his way to sit on the ground beside him.
Steve blocked him and put the letter in his breast pocket. “Trust me, there’s nothing other than talk about the kids in here. But seriously, I really doubt you wanna hear about douching.”
Seeing that Dean had no intention of answering the question, Steve prompted the boy, “Dean?”
Dean decided:
The room was loud and boisterous, taken over by Sam, Clint and Natasha interjecting over one another to talk to their father. Steve once again assured them they'd get to everything and made his way to the table to crouch by Bruce's chair and whispered a hello.
"Look. You clearly know we're upset." Steve started as he sat beside Dean. "But why don't you tell us what was going through your head?"
"What can I do for you," Bobby finally spoke.
"Woah, woah," Steve laughed, "I missed you too! At least let me put my bags down!"
The two clutched each other tightly as they kissed, rubbing Steve's still cloth-covered erection over Tony's red and aching one.
“I’m fine, just let it go,” Dean brushed off the man, continuing his breakfast.
Dean gave a small smile. “Don’t mention it,” he responded and made his way back to bed.
“Dean! Look at this!” Sam called out, breaking the teen from his pensiveness.
"Lord knows your Papa has done that enough times for me over the years." Tony chuckled.
"You're gonna give your dad a run for his money in the brains department, huh? It's wonderful to meet you, Bruce."
A moment of silence, before Dean heard a quiet "Yeah," followed by a sniffle.
Steve blushed, but, to the sound of his friends hollering and cheering, pulled his husband towards the parking lot.
"I'm still addicted to alcohol even though I don't drink it. The goal is to never touch a drop of alcohol ever again. And I'm not going to lie to you, I've had some setbacks over the years, but I had my therapist and Steve to support me and get me back on track."
