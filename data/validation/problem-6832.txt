All seemed usual to the blond hydra until he heard his little brunette choke. Snapping his head at the startled prince he glanced to where Tony was staring wide eyed. And just like that a vain appeared on his forehead. There on the farthest side of the line was a thin red haired woman staring right back at Tony with big pleading puppy dog eyes. He immediately growled at the prince by his side who had given all his attention to the beautiful red haired woman. Tony flinched as Steve made his irritation known by slamming his fist hard against the throne’s arms.
Outside the airport looking distress, he was in his knee’s looking around with panic in his eyes. Searching for his owner..I couldn’t get a word out of him..thankfully his talking now” Tony smiled as Thor looked thoughtfully at him. “Glad to know he warmed up to you pretty fast” Clint commented.
“You see Bucky...no one can take better care of my brother than me” Steve said as he glanced at his brother with a soft look before staring back at his best friend. Bucky seemed to want to say something as he began to open his mouth but decided against it. Steve took that opportunity yo finally turned around, pulling a very distressed Tony away with him.
Tony gave a small pout at that making the redhead chuckle and agree. “Oh, alright…” as she headed towards one of Tony’s chairs. “Anyways i better go…i need to be up at 5am for my morning jog…just happy to help out here…see ya Tony…” Steve smiled before glancing at Pepper with a smirk. “See you Pep..”
And just like that Tony felt his insides do a somersault, not sure anymore if he’d like the idea of someone else taking care of the small hybrid, if that someone else would actually take care of Steve like the blond hybrid deserved. He felt himself tremble as he thought of how unfair life had already been to steve, he really didn’t want the hybrid to endure more. and as a pair of bright blue eyes locked with his, he knew it already. He was done for. A single glance at Bruce was all he needed for the vet to grin.
That opportunity had come right away in the form of Pepper crying on his shoulders after classes that Friday, saying that she didn’t want to go home anymore to her neglectful uncle. Tony had been so upset at seeing his friend cry that he had offered her to stay with him and Steve, assuring her that she wouldn’t be a bother to anyone since it was only them at the house. Steve had been very supportive in letting Pepper stay, even offering his room for the redhead to take. Suggesting that he and Tony could crash together, Tony had immediately held the redhead tight at that saying Pepper shouldn’t be sleeping alone at this point in her life. Pepper was absolutely grateful for Tony being so thoughtful and considerate of her feelings and well being. That Saturday morning Tony had woken up to Pepper cuddling next to him, both smiling and laughing as Steve opened the door to give them both breakfast in bed. The two thanking him as they both started to fed each other. Tony was so occupied in taking care of his friend that he hadn’t noticed the older teen staring longingly at him.
The two were absolutely close at home, but when they were in school, things were a bit different. Steve mostly didn’t interact with Tony that much whenever they’d bump into each other. The blond mostly steering clear of the brunette as best as he could for some reason. Which Tony didn’t mind really..he had other things to think about and other people to talk to. Plus he always had Steve all to himself whenever they were finally at home again.
Tony’s eyes snapped open at hearing the elevator door open. Steve Rogers had suddenly appeared wearing his famous captain america smile, holding a box of donuts on one hand and coffee on the other. The scene in front of him was enough to make the billioner genius lose his voice for a bit.
Clint wasn’t crying, no. Something had just gotten stuck in his eye is all. God, he wanted an omega like Tony. Screw Steve if he was doing anything funny with that other omega.
Tony smiled brilliantly as he saw Steve appear on his phone’s screen. Pepper by his side rolled her eyes as the man had called and texted Steve eight times that day, and now that they were finally back at their hotel Tony had asked Steve to have a video call with him. Tony had explained that it was really so Steve wouldn’t worry too much about him, when in reality Pepper knew it was Tony who was getting all caught up in knowing how Steve was doing. The man couldn’t live a second without knowing what the blond was up to. It was cute but a bit annoying. She stopped her eye roll though when Steve smiled at her with his adorable tail twirling around in the background. Well..with a Hybrid like that who wouldn’t be obsessed.
Placing the broken cup at the counter Tony wince at the burn on his hands. Steadily walking to the faucet and letting the water run down his hands. Steve was at his side mewling sadly as he nuzzled close to Tony. Thor had appeared as well with a worried expression. Once Tony felt his hands didn’t hurt as much anymore he ordered Steve to show him his hands. The hybrid obeyed as he placed both his hands in front of the brunette. Red as can be but the blond showed no signs that he was in pain like Tony was. “Steve you should really be more careful with the cups next time...awww it was my favorite too..” Tony morned as he stared at Steve with a serious look. Steve whined as he pressed his head against Tony even more, feeling absolutely guilty as he glanced at the broken cup and his master’s hand. Tony inhaled sharply as his expression turn softer. “It’s okay Steve we all make mistakes..come on let’s put some cream on our hands...Thor you can go back and watch the show some more we’ll be okay here” Tony smiled at the other who nodded obediently at him before walking back in to the living room. Once he was gone Tony quickly glanced at Steve as he opened a drawer containing the cream he was saying. “Steve...i know you don’t like to share me that much but you really have to work with your temper okay?.. Thor really needs help right now and if you’d just give him a chance I’m sure you’ll like him as much as i do..” Tony said with a soft smile as he rubbed the cream against his and Steve’s hands. The hybrid nodded before giving Tony a small lick on his cheek. “That’s my boy...”Tony chuckled, fighting off a blush as he put the cream back and escorting the hybrid back to the living room.
Strangely every time he’d get out of the bathroom the Hybrid would have this weird look on his face inhaling rapidly like he was sniffing out drugs from their room. His face would always be hard and unreadable, Eyes dark and pupils dilated making Tony feel a bit uncomfortable. The hybrid would snap out of it however once he’d hear Tony call him. Face looking all soft and innocent once again as he’d smile at him. Tonight was the first night In a year Tony wouldn’t have the hybrids massive hands around him.
The words seemed to get a positive reaction from the younger teen as he couldn’t believe what the big , scarier senior was saying. He actually liked Tony..and actually wanted to help him get to Bucky. He just couldn’t believe it. “Are y-you sure you really want to help me? This isn’t some trick is it?” Tony asked as he tried not to shake. He really didn’t want this to be a big joke..he wouldn’t be able to take it if Steve was just making fun of him. The blond shook his head as he said a stern  ‘NO.’
“To friends!” Thor cheered as he raised his beer. “To friends!” Everyone laughed as they tossed their bottles into the air. “But seriously Steve. You and Tony here? Should really start distancing yourselves from each other a bit…” Clint started as he took a sip of his beer. Tony gasped at that as he clung to Steve’s side. Face all hurt. “I’m serious!” Clint laughed as Nat finally sat down after finishing her song. “He’s right though” the redhead stated as she stared seriously at the two across the table. “What? Nat, you too?…” Steve smiled as he wrapped an arm around the frowning brunette and brought him closer. “Oh God! No joke! Look at you two! How are your soulmates going to react to that?” Clint laughed as he pointed at the two. Bruce shook his head at that as he smirked. Thor humming in agreement beside him.
The hydra’s head snapped to where the voice was coming from, heart thumping fast, overwhelmed with relief and joy at hearing his wife’s voice call him. “Tony?...where are you...” Steve called out as he sniffed the air, trying to trace the omega’s faint scent. Feet moving quickly as he walked towards where Tony’s faint scent was coming from, along with his voice. “TONY! ohhh Tony...” Steve breathed with relief once had he spotted Tony. the large Alpha immediately ran to his side, face full of confusion and concern as he realized how wet Tony was.  The omega only smiled reassuringly as he held out the colorful flowers he held in his hand. “I was picking flowers for the kitchen table when i heard the sound of water nearby, I couldn’t help myself...achoo!” Tony sneezed as he giggled a bit when Steve’s expression had turned into one of annoyance.
I know, i know it was supposed to be just till chap two but then stuff happen so the story is till chapter 3 🙃
Tony slumped down tiredly as he gave the blond a look. “Clint...i do get jealous...i do sometimes wish Steve wouldn’t spend so much time with Bucky than he does with me..but so what? I trust Steve and it would be too selfish of me if i asked him to stop spending too much time with someone he had thought had fell to his death. This is a precious and hard time for them...i mean if i found out Jarvis or my mom were still alive I wouldn’t stop wrapping my arms around them both..you’d have to pry me away from them if you dared..” Tony joked as he gave a weary smile at his friend. “I love Steve and would never want to tell him he couldn’t do something that he wanted to..which right now is taking care of an old friend he thought he had lost.”
An hour had passed and still no text from Steve. Tony had tried calling him but figured his phone had died since his line keep saying couldn’t be reached. At moments like these when the younger brother was all alone Tony couldn’t help but admit that he did feel a pang in his heart at the way the blond never liked to go near him whenever his friends were with him. At moments like these were he was laying by himself alone in Steve’s bed, he’d have this funny feeling at the thought of Steve being with someone else. Which really shouldn’t bother him. Steve was his brother after all..and their kisses and sweet touches were just their way of showing affection towards each other. Granted he knew it wasn’t normal since none of his classmates that had siblings never kissed each other with their tongues. But he had gotten too use to Steve slip in a tongue every now and then, he had been so use to the older teen touching him, pressing onto him..making him feel like he was the most precious thing on earth to him. It didn’t start out like this at first. They had always been close even when their parents were still alive. Steve had even told their parents that he wanted to marry Tony when he grew up. Making the two adults laugh at his childish mind. Telling the young blond back then that he couldn’t marry Tony because he was his brother. That had made Steve very upset as he bursted into tears saying he wanted to be with Tony forever. Their mother Sarah had to explain to the small blond that he didn’t need to marry Tony to be with him forever because they were brothers. They would always be together no matter what. That had seemed to lighten the young blond’s mood right away as he smiled at their mother then at Tony.
Maybe if he’d insert his dominance more around the apartment Thor would get the hint and leave the brunette alone. With a rough cough Steve immediately stood up from his spot on the floor, where he was sitting on one of their bean bags and settled next to Tony’s side. Sneakily wrapping his arms around the engineer’s shoulders as he rested his head there as well. Tony glanced at him with a small smile before continuing to twirl his fingers around Thor’s hair, making the other Hybrid that was settled on his lap purr with content. A scowl appeared on Steve’s face at that before he nudge his head against Tony’s. Making the brunette glance back at him with a chuckle. “Steve...i can’t breath with you two big guys squeezing me..how about you make us one of your famous lasagna! It’s almost dinner time and I’ve missed your home cooked meals so much” Tony said with a fond expression. Brown eyes twinkling with excitement at the thought of being able to have Steve’s cooking again. The hybrid whined at feeling he was being pushed away but smiled anyway as he wanted to cook for his master and make him happy. With a light nod Steve got up as he went back into the kitchen glancing back a bit to stare longingly at his master who was still unconsciously twirling the other hybrid’s hair. Sighting a bit before disappearing into the kitchen.
So a lot of you really hated Steve and wanted Tony out in the first chap, but just please remember that Tony is actually very okay. He is very understanding and secure of himself and of his and Steve’s relationship. He know’s his worth and will be quick to leave Steve if he ever finds out that Steve’s cheating on him.
“Tony? Anything wrong?” He asked, concern written all over his gorgeous face. The alpha couldn’t help but smile at that. “No…just a bit tired is all…my eyes are playing tricks with me again…i think i better hit the sack..” Tony yawned as he tried to stand up. But the omega had other plans as he gently tugged the other’s arm back down again. Pleading with big puppy dog eyes for the alpha to stay. “ im really enjoying this movie…but im not very close with the rest of the team as i am with you…please stay, i…i just don’t really wanna feel alone again…”
Tony sigh as he wasn’t listening anymore as it probably was none of his concern what the man was talking about to his King. Instead the brunette had leaned his head against the Hydra kings thigh as he felt Steve’s large fingers start to play with his locks. Making him feel sleepy as he tried to ignore the man’s voice. It had been two weeks since Steve and him were married. And a week since Loki and Thor had said their farewells as well. He would be eternally grateful for the dark haired prince who had saved Pepper’s life in the dessert and had given him small advices on his wedding night before they had entered the bath. When it was time for the two Asgardian royals to bid goodbye Tony hugged the dark haired one tight. getting a bit of a frown from Steve but nothing else than that. for whatever reason after he had accepted his love for the man, Tony had been more brave and relax beside his King. This seemed to do good to the blond as well as he was smiling more now that Tony wasn’t so afraid of him. Steve had even made Pepper one of Tony’s hand maidens as Tony had assured him that there was nothing going on between him and the redhead. Yes maybe everything would be smooth sailing from now own between them. Tony thought as he drifted away on the kings lap.
“You like him?..” Steve asked as he glanced at the brunette who blinked a few times before glancing back at him with startled eyes. Not expecting him to say ask. “I...i do...he’s nice..he gave me this..” he gestured to the diamond necklace hanging around his neck. Steve narrowed his eyes at the necklace before glancing back at him. “That really doesn’t suit you though..” he wrinkled his nose with a cute smile making Tony laugh and slap him. “Shut up..” he smiled before yelping a bit when Steve had suddenly rolled on top of him. “I’m serious...he really doesn’t know you that well if he gives you a fancy thing like that...that wouldn’t really make you happy..” he said as he nudged his nose against the omega’s. Tony could feel his breath on him, swallowing a bit as he tried to talk without shaking. “It’s for our wedding tomorrow...something new..” he managed to say as he felt Steve’s azure eyes pierce through him. “Oh yeah?...well how bout this...” Steve said as he sat up a bit, taking his old dog tag off his neck from when he trained in the military. Hanging it in front of Tony before placing it around the omega’s neck. Startling The brunette a bit.
“Mmmm…Oh God! You’re the best Steve…” Tony finally moaned as he took one of the donuts and put it in his mouth. All while Steve continued to pamper him.
With all his thinking, he hadn’t even realized that he was already at the demon shop. Tony’s eyes had widen at all the objects that were being shown inside the window. There were gags, and whips for Demons who misbehaved. There were also books, collars and delicious looking dildos that made the tiny demon swallow.
It was suppose to be a joke Peter guessed. But, it didn’t stop the two brother’s from blushing bright red at the suggestive statement. ‘does he know about me and Wade?’ Was the only thing running around Peter’s mind as he tried not to panic. Unsure on how to react anymore. Luckily Wade had stepped in with a big grin plastered on his face at the suggestion. “Wow thanks! Guess we wont be worrying about anything tonight then!”
“Oh my gosh Steve...mmm..please get Clint...” Natasha practically moaned as she took off her buttoned shirt baring her soft breast and pink nipples. She was already sweating as she throw the garment across the room. Natasha was absolutely beautiful with nothing else on but her soaked red panty, a bit if slick running down. She looked absolutely stunning with her toned body showing off her curves in all the right places and giving off the sweet smell of spices and orchids. Tail curling around her slender leg. Steve gulped in amazement but still felt nothing below, rather simply appreciating the female hybrids body.
Once he had reached a motel. He cautiously stopped the car at the parking lot as he looked around a bit. As he tried to get his Breathing under control he turned around to watch his brother sleeping peacefully. Everything would be alright. He’d make everything be alright for both them.
“Yeah, it’s out…” Peter blushed as he tried to ignore MJ’s whistling. “And your brother?” Wade cock a brow curiously. “ we can tell him over breakfast.”
With a small smile Tony wrapped his arms around his king’s massive shoulders, nudging his nose against the blond’s as he whispered i love you to him. Making the Hydra king smile with glee in his eyes as he wrapped his large arms around the smaller man’s waist. The two stayed wrapped in each other’s embrace before glancing at their friends who were busy cuddling next to them as well. Thor smirking at them as he played with A tired Loki’s wet locks.
The omega patted his round belly as he chuckled at something Natasha had just told him while blushing hotly as Bucky gave Steve a knowing look. Natasha was a read haired human omega like Tony who was chosen by their previous village Protector 10 years ago.. Natasha was so young when Bucky had chosen her. It was weird and amazing to see her again all grown up and a mother of three half breed hydra children that seemed way too big for their human age. Natasha was also expecting a fourth one as she had announced that she was actually three months pregnant. Happily Sharing Tony’s excitement with his own pregnancy.
Oh no, someone knew..Tony’s life was over. They’d probably try and make Tony confess and make fun of him. Inside the science lab? After school? Should he even go? Maybe he shouldn’t. Maybe he should just go home straight away and never go back.
when the practice was almost over Tony hadn’t even realized that he was staring more at Steve than he was at Bucky. His stomach would do this flip flop whenever he saw Steve wave at him. Bucky was also waving at him now. But he couldn’t help but feel more happy when it was Steve seeking his attention.
Tony’s face flushed as he had a dazed look on his face when Steve had finished rubbing against him. The scrawny blond omega trying to get the dazed out alpha’s scent on him as best as he could as he finished rubbing their clothed erections together. Tony whimpering a bit when Steve had finally parted from him, smirking mischievously as the blond omega quietly lead them both back into the hallway. The two had been together now for a year and a half and still Tony would blush like a tomato whenever Steve would Start to scent him. Or even and especially when Steve would ask for him to bite him near his bond gland again. The omega tended to request that whenever they both met at school. Insuring that everyone in their school knew that Tony was his and he was Tony’s. Steve could get very possessive whenever another omega would come near his Alpha. Right away stumping with his skinny legs as best as he could and scent the alpha right then and there. Daring any omega to come between them. Often times his actions have caused him a bit of trouble from his father who keeps telling him to refrain from too much physical contact as he and Tony were not supposed to mark each other until they turned 20. The omega would scowl at that.
Unable to control himself Tony leaped onto the unexpected blond. Making Steve go wide eye a bit as Tony clung to him. “Oh my god! Thank you, thank you! I can’t believe you’d help me out!” Tony smiled happily as he felt like he was floating sky high. Once the taller teen had recovered from his initial shock of the smaller teen’s sudden action. He immediately straighten himself as he tried to pry slender arms away from him. “It’s nothing really...i just wanna help a friend out..this is mostly for Bucky..”
“Tony?” Steve called out as he couldn’t seem to track down the omega’s scent. “Tony?” Steve tried again as he started pacing around the front of the cottage. There was absolutely no sign of the omega. Did he go into the woods? No..he knew the forest surrounding their cottage was dangerous for an omega human to go out on his own. Steve had told him that, the large blond didn’t hesitate to go back into the woods anyway. Hoping and praying that his omega was alright.
Steve redden at her side even more. An incubus was a sex demon. feeding on a humans arousal and sexual release. In turn though the humans become stronger and healthier each time an incubus has sex with them. Thus making them a very expensive demon to own. “W-why did you get two though?...you can’t feed both of them..they’ll starve.” Steve questioned as he glanced back at the two who were still watching them with curious eyes. “I had to...you should of seen them when the people were trying to take Tony away from Bucky..i just couldn’t..” Natasha sigh as she looked at the two demons with a sad face. “Tony?” Steve asked, trying to know who was who. “Bucky come here...” Nat called, making Steve turn around to watch the bigger one stand and walk towards them. Settling comfortably next to Nat when he had reached her. So his Bucky...so the other one must be..Steve’s thoughts trailed as he glanced back at the other demon who was still seated on the floor. Looking absolutely small and soft that Steve just wanted to pick him up and cuddle him in his lap.
“I’m just really tired that’s all...I really don’t feel like getting out of bed..” Tony lied as he started to snuggle inside the covers, Placing his phone next to him. Steve nodded at that with soft eyes as he quickly joined the smaller teen. Tony couldn’t help but lean into the older brother as strong arms started to wrap around him. “ i’ll stay here with you then and keep you company..” Steve whispered in his ear before pressing his nose against it. Tony couldn’t help the rise of his blood traveling to his face as he stared at his brother’s tender face. “Promise?” He whispered as he leaned closer to the blond who easily nudged their noses together. “I promise...I’m not going anywhere...” Steve whispered as he pressed his lips against Tony’s, making the younger brother shiver.
It had all happened so quickly that they weren’t given enough time to think or react when the blond Asgardian Prince had announced that he had brought with him presents for Steve and his new Soon to be Queen. Thor beamed with pride as he asked for the gift of Servants to be shown in the throne room.
Steve blew out a breath as he waited for the kettle to whistle. He already had two cups ready and some herbal tea, a moan could be hear coming out of Clint’s bedroom door while the blond sigh as he stared at the television. “Again Clint i am so sorry for the mess..if i had known...” Sharon began but Clint just waved it off as he shrugged. “It’s alright...you didn’t know..” Clint reassured her as he glanced at her hybrid who had a swollen eye that she was tending to. “I think I’ve got some more frozen peas in the freezer for Sams eye” Clint said as he got up and walked across the room. Sharon nodded at that as she handed over the now limp pack of peas she was pressing over Sams eye.
“You know Steve...i just wanna tell you before we go in...i have someone I’d like for you to meet...and i hope you will be welcoming to him” Tony trailed as he peeked inside the apartment before glancing back at his confused hybrid. “Welcoming? Is Pepper here?” Steve frowned as he stared at his master. “No...not Pepper...It’s..well you’ll see” Tony breathed as he opened the door wide and Steve’s confused look instantly turned into one of surprise as he saw a muscular blond haired hybrid sitting on their cough playing with his toys, golden tail swishing lazily as he stared at them.
Tony frowned when the omega who was asking him if he could help her train for her wrestling try outs next Friday had immediately paled and told him that she forgot she was busy on Friday, before scrambling away. Well..she must of realized Tony wasn’t really the best candidate to help her out with wrestling. That thought had seemed to put him in a sour mood right away before his eyes lit up when he found Steve smiling adorably at him with his incredible cute puppy dog eyes. The blond immediately leaned into him whispering huskily a ‘hey babe, I’ve missed you’ before suddenly pressing Tony against the bleachers, sliding his tongue inside Tony’s open mouth as he did. God was Tony lucky to have such a gorgeous, strong, talented and loving omega like Steve. he really couldn’t believe how Steve had still stayed with a loser alpha like him. back in the mind of his head he thought he didn’t deserve such a perfect omega. Steve was the whole package. And Tony would be eternally grateful to the gods up above for giving him this. When the kiss had ended Tony felt dazed as the tall blond whispered in his ear how he wanted Tony to mark him, again right then and there in the open field.
Tony couldn’t help the smile spreading across his face as Bucky had sent him a funny GIF that afternoon.
“Steve? It’s the middle of the night…what are you doing here?…” Tony asked as he tried to get up and greet his surprise guess. But Steve was fast. Hand right away placing the box of donuts infront of the alpha, while the other hand handed him the freshly brewed coffee. Giving the omega enough time to push the alpha back down on his chair. Fingers gently gripping the sides of each shoulder before slowly working their magic.
For Crap’s sake he couldn’t even go near the blond and just talk to him in front of everyone. For some reason every time he did Steve would have this look on his face that Tony couldn’t read, before sputtering that he had to go. Leaving Tony hurt and confused. So if that’s how it was going to be like then Tony didn’t care anymore. He was tired of constantly dying inside at the sight of his brother being happy with someone else in public. If Steve wanted to be cold towards him in public he wanted to be cold towards him at home too..But that was easier said than done as he felt his knees go weak every time Steve would go near him when they were alone..would start touching him, kissing him the way the blond knew he liked it.
Everything was really nice and warm that moment. it made him feel safe. Bucky made him feel safe, and comfortably warm..well, Tony was actually aware that his whole body and face was warm from the punch he had drank a few minutes ago. But that wasn’t the point, the point was that right now he wasn’t worrying about a certain blond. The point was Bucky was here with him. Bucky, who was taking care of him while his brother was out on a date once again, While his brother was probably diving his tongue down someone else’s throat again (most likely Peggy), while his brother was busy doing that..Bucky was here sitting next to him, with his strong arms wrapped comfortably around him like all the other times when Steve wasn’t there for him when they were younger. Bucky wh-before he could finish what he was thinking his eyes had closed tight as he felt soft lips pressed against his.
When he had told Steve this, as he sat on his lap. The blond had only smiled as he took a slice of the pie and placed it in his mouth, telling Tony that the man might of been an angel. And that that angel was probably back in heaven by now. Tony couldn’t help but chuckle at that as he nuzzled comfortably against his king’s chest. All happy and unaware of what truly happened to his poor savior.
" Soon enough...i will make you bend for me my love.." Steve whispered as he kissed Tony's sweaty forehead with a small grin. Oh how he admired Tony's foolish bravery, thinking that he could still manage to keep the Stark dignity intact.
The long haired brunette alpha suddenly stood up and stormed off with his tray. Muttering that it wasn’t his fault Tony looked so cute for an Alpha. “I think you should apologize to him...” Tony pouted as he tried taking a bite of the burger Steve was feeding him. “What?!..your even taking his side?” The blond frowned as he took the burger away from Tony, making the tired alpha whine. “Well..he is your beat friend and i don’t think it’s good that you two are fighting, i hate it when me and Rhodeybear fight..so i know you do too...plus he really was just trying to help me get undress, i keep telling you that” Tony answered as he tried to reach for the burger. “Tony..” the omega sigh. “Steve...” Tony countered.
“Tony, what are you still doing in bed? Come on your going to make us late.” Steve had barged into his room and grabbed his pillow, making Tony whine as he tried not to look at his brother, for someone who should be having a hang over Steve was doing pretty well.  “Come on cute face...get up..” Tony stilled as he felt Steve’s hot breath against his cheeks, heart thumping fast as he closed his eyes shut while feeling the blond’s lips pressed onto his. Tongue licking his lips a bit, asking for entrance. Tony felt like melting at the sensation and couldn’t help but obey as he opened his mouth for the blond to explore.
Finally unable to take too much of the heat Steve screamed from the top of his lungs as the unseen flames became too much to bare. Coughing a bit when he felt his throat start to go unbelievably dry. As he began to choke a bit, the burning finally seemed to stop. Leaving him gasping and sweating like he had just been thrown through hells fire. Which was what had probably happened he though. Tony was also not doing too well on his side, as the tiny demon was shivering and panting. Brown eyes wide and pleading as he looked up at his newly bonded master. For a moment though Steve thought he saw gold instead of brown.
“Someone’s excited to finally see their omega tomorrow..” Nat teased as she gave Tony a wink before chuckling when Tony flustered at her comment. “Come on, you guys...give the guy a break..” Bruce chipped in making Tony smile at him thoughtfully. “ we’re only playing with ya Tones, hey give me some of those nuts well ya Bruce” Clint said as he tried to grab some ooff of Bruce’s bowl before getting swatted by Thor’s massive hand. “Ouch! Watch it Thor! Ohhh i think you broke a few of my fingers...” Clint groan as he cradled his hand against his chest. Thor merely giving him a ‘you should of known better look’. “I bought these for Bruce because i know he likes them...you should go get your own if you want some Clint..” The beta glared at him before groaning again. Bruce frowning as he tried to tell Thor that he didn’t mind sharing some with their friends. Thor blushing a bit at that before apologizing to their offended friend. Tony hadn’t been paying much attention to them anymore since he was too busy thinking about finally seeing Steve tomorrow. He really didn’t like why Steve couldn’t bring with him his cell phone. But there was nothing they could do as it was one of the rules.
a laughed escaped the other hybrid as a small piece of the lasagna fell on the brunette’s lap. Thor easily placing his hands there to pick the piece up and throw it in his mouth. Tony laughing and smiling Adorably as well at the disgusting action.
Tony beamed at that. “ really? Okay...I’ll see you tomorrow then..” he said with a small smile as he gave Steve a wave. The tall blond nodded at that as he turned around to finally walk away from the shorter teen. Tony smiled gleefully as he clapped both his hands together. Wow, he really had to give The taller teen props. Steve was more dedicated in this than he thought. With a wide smile Tony rash inside his house, eager to hear all about the senior brunette tomorrow. Unaware that the blond had glanced back at him with an also gleeful look on his face.
Tony could only close his eyes in embarrasement as he heard all four men growl possessively at one another. His heat driven mind tried to think coherently as he sniffed the lust filled air around him. They were offering themselves to him. All four of them. And it really did feel nice, If he wasn’t already bounded he would of accepted anyone of them right away. But he was, and to the pack Alpha at best. He really should shoo them away before all of them regrets this.
With a cough he got the brunette’s attention again. Face positively serious as he didn’t want to give off anything to the other in front of him. “So...you like vanilla ice cream...” Steve commented as he remembered what Tony had ordered. The younger teen immediately smiled at that with a soft nod. “Yeah...especially when drenched with salted butter caramel..” he said with a goofy grin that made Steve’s heart soar. “ um...anything else? Nuts...sprinkles?” Steve drawled as he started writing on his notebook. “Um...no..but i guess those are good too...i mean who doesn’t like sprinkles?” Tony had grinned as he watched Steve scribble on his notebook. “And you like cheese burger...right?” He questioned as he remembered the brunette’s order again. “It’s my favorite actually...really fast and easy to get and eat...” Tony answered as he glanced down at The blond scribbling away again.
“Sam and Bucky happened that’s what..hey Tony..” Sharon waved as she pressed the cold pack against a winching Sam. “Hey Sharon..wait, why?” Tony furrowed his brows. “Nat’s in heat remember..” Clint answered as he sipped his tea. Tony gave an ‘oh’ as he stared at Sam guessing Bucky won. In that instant a moan and a growl could be heard from Clint’s room leaving another awkward silence in the room they were in before Tony patted Steve’s back. “Welp...as much fun it would be to sit and listen to Bucky breeding Nat i think me and Steve should get going..i um..have a surprise for him waiting in the apartment..ugh..sorry if we cant stay and help Clint..” Tony gave an apologetic expression at the blond. “It’s alright..you should unpack and stuff..sides Sharon and Sam are here so..” Clint trailed with a smile as he looked at Tony. The brunette smiling as well at that “dinner at my place tomorrow bud...” Tony winked as he gripped Steve closer before saying goodbye and closing the door.
“See anything you like Tony?” Steve asked as he watched the tiny demon finally pull out from the box. Hand in the air as he held a red collar with a cute golden bell attached to it. Steve smiled at that as he started walking around trying to find some nice toys and a leash for the cute demon.
A smile crossed his face when he had bent down to pick the tiny omega up, lifting the brunette gently onto his chest. Blushing a bit when Tony didn’t seem to mind and even snuggled closer against his chest. He quicken his steps as he watched the sun start to set. By nightfall a new village protector would arrive to take his place. And he would be an instant threat to the other as he had no bond to the village anymore.
You know what? I’ll edit this later if i see any mistakes..i just feel like i owe you guys this chapter...again so sorry for the wait
The diner was packed when they arrived. Luckily Sharon and her gang had waved at Steve when he had entered with Tony by his side. The group of girls had instantly made room for the jock but none for Tony who remained standing when Sharon had pulled Steve down to sit next to her. “Oh sorry...we only have room for Stevie here..” Sharon said apologetically as she leaned towards the jock. Tony nodded at that as he started to look around if there were any available table’s else where. Steve had blinked at that. “It’s alright...Tony can sit on my lap..” Steve offered innocently as he patted his knee for emphasis. Sharon and the rest of the girls had immediately widen their eyes at that. With Tony blushing hard as he stared at Steve’s lap. “No! no...ugh it’s okay...i think I’m just gonna go and sit somewhere else..” Tony trailed as he tried to look around again. Steve frowned at that as he started to stand up. “Then I’ll go with you..” before he could fully stand up however Sharon had instantly pulled him down again. “You know what?! I think Sunset actually needs to go home now..right Sunny?” Sharon said sweetly, her smile stretched so wide that it looked like it hurt. Sunset frown at that. “What? I don’t ha-“ before she could finish her sentence one of the girls had kicked her off the table, making enough room for Tony to slide right next to Steve who immediately wrap his arm around his shoulder.
When they were finally done, Steve lead his demon inside the room fury had entered earlier. The room was surprisingly dark, with only a green dim light shining above them. Fury was already sitting beside a thin trail of dirt that was shaped into a the devil’s star. Fury quickly gestured for the two to step inside the symbol as he began flipping some pages in a black book. When Steve and Tony were finally seated inside the star in an Indian fashion, Fury then asked Tony to repeat Steve’s name six times. The tiny incubus did as instructed but with a different language that Steve’s didn’t think was human. When the incubus was done Fury started speaking in latin as he read through the pages. Steve couldn’t help but feel a strange overwhelming burn start to spread throughout his body. He gripped his knees tightly as he felt a burning sensation start to spread inside him. Consuming him little by little.
In the large open field temple, just outside the large village where the human’s live. Near the entrance to the dark Forest where dark creatures roam. Two souls sit opposite each other as the chosen omega human finally meets the hydra beast that had protected their village for five years now. For every five years a different creature from the hydra lands is chosen by one of the high ranking creatures that have claimed themselves as the protectors and peacekeepers of the whole realm. Including the humans that need as much protection from stupid feral or low leveled hydra creature’s who wish nothing than to kill anything weaker than them just to feel superior. The human’s have been under the protection of the higher ranked hydra creatures for over four hundred years now when they had made a deal.
“I know Steve…t-thank you anyway for …mmm…everything today…it m-meant a lot to me…” Tony managed to say in between kisses as his fingers started to unbotton The older man’s shirt. Only to gasp in shock when the billioner’s hand suddely smacked his ass harshley. Reminding him of who Steve really was to him. “What was that baby?” Steve asked with a mischivious grin. “D-Daddy…thank you Daddy…” Tony groan in pleasure as he let the blond lift him up by his sides. Legs instantly wrapping around the hard body, as to not fall.
The gang all laughed as the brunette cried out for his science bro to help him out as he tried to escape Steve’s clutches.
The brunette was pleasantly surprised to taste mint, Steve had brushed his teeth. Good..he didn’t think he could swallow down tasting liquor and someone else when Steve was giving him his morning kiss. The two of them stayed that way for a few seconds before Steve broke it and stared at him with a small smile that always seemed to take Tony’s breath away. “You up yet?” He asked with a funny tone making Tony roll his eyes at him. “I am now...” he replied with a dead tone before shifting and getting up from the bed. “Someone’s grumpy..”Steve teaser as he got up as well.
Now if only Tony and the rest of the gang were having an easier time getting in touch Thor’s master.
“Is it just me or are we missing a pair?” Bruce asked at the realization that two friends weren’t with them tonight. “Oh Tony has a dentist appointment in the morning so he couldn’t come…” Nat answered as she took the mic that Clint had handed her when he got off the table. “Which automatically leaves Steve out since if Tony isn’t coming…he isn’t either…i swear those two..”Clint sigh as he tried to open a beer bottle. “Ay, they are as glued together as two mutated bananas sticking together.” Thor mused which made his friends stare at each other on the comparison. before Bruce could open his mouth to tell the blond of how weird that sounded though, a mischievous arm had snuck it’s way around his neck. Warm soft skin pressed up against his. Making the shy brunette turn around to laugh as soft lips started kissing his cheek.
With a gulp, the blond human carefully placed his large hand at the center of the demons head. right between the horns. A smile appeared on Steve’s face when he realized Tony was instantly leaning towards his touch. And oh God..he was purring like a cat. “Wow...seems like he likes you...” Nat said with a smile as she continued to pet Bucky’s head as well. Steve couldn’t help but smirk at her as he carefully wrapped his arms around the startled demon. Placing him gently on his lap. Instantly the older demon leaned towards his little brother who was now with them. Steve couldn’t help but blush as he watched the older brunette start to lick his little brother’s mouth. Heart thumping loudly inside his chest as heard the smaller demon start to moan against him. Natasha couldn’t help but laugh as she saw her friends start to squeeze the demon tighter against his body.
Steve had ram inside Tony as best as he could, cumming inside the demon five times that night as he wanted Tony to know that he could take care of him. When morning came Steve couldn’t help but smile as he woke up with the tiny demon in his arms, skin all glowing and cheeks all red. A perfect sign of a well fed incubus.  Steve himself had never felt so refreshed and alive! Even though him and Tony had done it till the early morning, he woke up with so much energy that he decided he wanted to start running again, Something he hadn’t done in a while. Looks like Tony had done his part in being Steve’s as well. but one look at the sleeping demon below him, and Steve couldn’t help but to reconsider his plan as he gently wrapped his arms around the tiny demon. Loving the way his demon purred and unconsciously cuddled closer. Oh he should really think of something to give Natasha.
Peter facepalmed at his boyfriend who was trying not to break a sweat infront of the two older men. “Actually…i think i’ll walk him home to keep him company. It’s been a real great party but i think we better go…” Peter started before getting cut off by a startled Tony. “What? You can’t go now! It’s not even Midnight! This is your party!” Tony whined as he flung to his younger brother’s side. Big brown eyes worried and pleading as he tried to convince the other to stay.
Tony was already due this month, and him and Steve had been absolutely excited in welcoming their little one into their lives. Though Tony did feel a bit nervous at the thought of popping out his big baby inside of him. Luckily Nat was now an expert and well experience at that and had already reassured Tony that everything will be alright. Making the brunette feel a bit better at the thought of labour.
And also please leave a lovely comment if you liked this chap...i know a lot of you were already thinking Tony might end up with Bucky with the last chap, so hopefully this surprised you ;)
“You certainly have caught yourself a beautiful one my friend...he is as you’ve described him, Congratulations again on the wonderful ceremony!” Thor said with a smile as he raised his golden cup at the king and his newly crowned bride. Loki did so as well as he eyed the small prince unknowingly getting the attention of the blond hydra who pressed Tony closer against his massive chest, not liking how the dark haired Asgardian was eying his bride. Tony made that moment to leaned his head against his neck making Steve snap his attention back to him, Tony had been seated at his lap. Fully stuffed and cheeks even pinker than usual from all the exertion of eating with brown eyes half lidded. The sight alone was enough to make Steve glee with pride knowing the beautiful prince was finally his.
That’s how the blond had probably found them since they were startled when Steve’s hand shook them awake for breakfast. The three had shared a good meal as Tony laughed when Bucky had smacked Steve on the head for leaving his baby brother all alone for too long. Tony had glared at being called baby but decided he didn’t mind as he saw the two start to bicker like two idiots, which was always fun.
Talking for bout half an hour he was finally able to get a word from the now relaxed blond. Steve was the only thing he said to him, which made the brunette think it was probably his name. Happy for the progress Tony asked if he’d like to come home with him guessing that the blond probably didn’t have a place to sleep in. The hybrid just stared at him with no answer, giving  the brunette an aching feeling in his chest, thinking the blond didn’t trust him mixed with not wanting to leave him alone in this alley.
There was just something about the Hydra who the elder’s have finally named Steve, that had instantly pulled a few strings in the brunette’s heart. maybe it was how he carried himself on the ceremony or how he stared longingly at Tony that the omega couldn’t help but blush at feeing so wanted by such a powerful beast. Or maybe it was because the protector was incredibly handsome for a monster who lurks around the bushes. Whatever it was..All he knew was that he was actually looking forward to becoming the protectors mate.
Strolling into bed and flopping tiredly in it he took out his phone again and opened his gallery. Pictures of Steve appeared in the small screen as he brows through a hundred of them, stopping when he saw the one where Steve was still a small skinny thing sitting at the park with a scowl on his face while looking at the distance, Tony smiled looking at it. Steve barely smiled back then, barely made a sound too. It was common for hybrids to stay silent and simply observe when in the presence with humans they didn’t know well enough. Pet hybrids usually only liked to talk with their owners or other hybrids they were comfortable with. So Tony didn’t really mind when Steve use to stay quiet around him back then. Because what Steve lacked in words, he made up for in affection . The tiny blond would always cling to him even back then, especially in the mornings after waking up. Always cuddling and nuzzling his nose on Tony’s chest which made Tony’s morning unbelievably wonderful and at the same time a nightmare. Always doing his best to maneuver his hard on away from the clingy blond was a challenge every waking morning. Afraid in scaring the poor guy, that got harder overtime when Steve had gotten bigger though. Forcing Tony to sleep facing the nightstand and away from the hybrid, so Steve wouldn’t feel his little jr down there rise up. The problem with the new position was that Steve was always spooning him now. Which made everything a hundred times harder for the brunette.
"Night Tony! And uh...Steve.." Clint nodded as he waved at them, "Night Clint! Nat!" Tony smiled as Steve who was tagging at his coat slowly followed him inside before closing the door. Clint grinned before closing his door as well, yawning  "So? What were we doing earlier?" Clint asked as he watched Natasha swish her tail lazily while getting inside the bedroom. "Oh yeah...sleep... finally.." he said as he closed the lights.
After everyone had eaten their fill and the group had started to just relax and lay by the shore Steve and Tony had decided to go swim further down the lake. Tony stopping immediately when Steve had started coughing. The two hot out of the water right away as Steve tried to control his coughing. Damn it his inhaler was inside his bag which was back where the group were. Tony cursed that they had swam a bit too far from where they had camped. Steve hadn’t coughed this hard since the start of the school year. The cold water must have triggered it. The omega was looking red as ever as Tony tried desperately to rub his hand on his back. Eventually the coughing had stopped and Tony was left wrapping his slender arms around Steve. Kissing the tiny shivering omega as Steve tried reassuring him that he was okay. A bit embarrassed of what had just happened as he tried to unwrap the alpha’s hands off him. he really didn’t like it when Tony was worried. As usual the Alpha was being stubborn as he gripped the omega tighter, giving as much warmth as he possibly could. It was sweet really..but Steve really needed to reassure him that he was okay. But before he could open his mouth to tell the alpha that Tony had leaned in and crashed their mouths together. Steve immediately being shock as he felt the trembling alpha’s shay tongue slide inside his mouth. Blue eyes snapping wide before closing back again when he realized that Tony was taking the initiative for the first time.
“You guys...you really don’t have to do this...I’ll be fine on my own really-oh! Dear God Loki...please do that again..” Tony moaned when the dark haired Asgardian had suddenly pinched one of his nipples from behind him. Oh it felt so good. The wonderful sensation was enough to lessen the agonizing pain he was feeling around that area. Thor had smiled at that as he threw two more pillows into the nest while Sam and Clint had finally finished arranging everything.
Even when Bucky ( Steve’s former Omega) was found and rescued by Steve himself, Tony had given him his full support. Even going as far as to forgive the winter soldier when they had found out that he had killed the genius’s parents. Understanding that the ex-assassin was brainwashed and had no control over his actions.
they still have the tentacles, just a bit smaller and not as much as a pure blooded hybrid. Also their bigger than normal humans yet smaller than pure bloods.
And that was exactly what Steve was going to give him. By the end of the month Tony Stark was going to be his. And no red head secretary was going to get in his way.
“So what do we do first?..” Tony asked with a smile as he looked up at Steve who didn’t look back at him as he said “fist lesson today is...Date...we’re going on a date...”
Tony was free now..free from the hurt of his own father, free from the pain that he suffered from his own people, free to be his...and he would keep it that way..and he swore no one would free Tony from him.
But it really wasn’t a feeling of lost or rejection on their part, but rather a feeling of jealousy and longing. To watch the person you’ve been seeing. That was as empty as you were be finally fulfilled and content with their lives. Leaving you all alone and still waiting for your special match.
Somehow it was already lunchtime and Bucky, Steve nor the girls from yesterday had said anything about Tony’s notepad. No one had come up to him and told or even made fun of him with the stupid things he wrote. Maybe they didn’t know it was his after all. Maybe he was safe after all. Thank God, He breathed as he got up from the grass after finishing his lunch.
A laugh escaped the redheads lips at that. making Steve scowl even more as he cross his arms in front of his chest. looking absolutely insulted. “Alright...alright...well if you don’t want Tony i could always give him to someone else...as long as Bucky still gets to see his little brother, there’s no problem really...i could call Sam-“ “hey Tony...hi..er..you wanna come sit near me?..” Steve instantly cooed at the little demon who stiffened instantly as Steve began calling him. Tail twitching nervously behind as he stared at the bulky human. Steve leaned in a little more as he stretched his arms towards the incubus, Natasha smirking by his side as he did. When Steve had noticed that Tony still didn’t have a collar on him, he instantly smiled as he cooed at the little incubus more. “You want me to get you a collar? We could buy one on the way home...i could buy you some new toys if you like...” instantly the small demon’s tail straighten at the words. Head tilting a bit to the side as he was considering the human’s words.
“Steve?...” Tony called making the hybrid snapped his head at him. “ me and Clint and the rest of the guys are gonna start hunting for Thor’s owner tomorrow..by what Thor’s told me i think his owner is gonna be easy as pie to find..” Tony winked, the words had sent a smile to form on the blond’s face. They were going to find Thor’s owner! Tony was going to find Thor’s owner! And then everything would be back to normal! “I knew you’d be happy to hear that...and guess what? You, Nat and Thor will be staying at Sharon’s place tomorrow! Isn’t that great?...Sam’s forgiven you for his black eye by the way Bucky..” Tony turned to glanced at the other hybrid who smirked at him, Nat rolling her eyes as she smacked Bucky. Steve on the other hand was staring wide eye at Tony...did he just say Thor was going to be there as well? With a curious glanced he watched as the big blond bursted with a loud laugh as he shared how he had went to London with his parents owner so that he could meet other royal hybrids there, With a heavy sigh Steve frowned with irritation. Tomorrow was going to be a looonnnggg day.
And now that they were finally settled inside Steve’s home. which might he add is absolutely cozy and lovely. Tony couldn’t help the shiver that went through him as Steve began to take off the robe that had been covering his slender body. It was almost funny how shy Steve was earlier when they had met. Now though that Tony was his and inside his home. All the shyness had seemed to wash away as he eagerly drank the omega’s now naked body.
The blond merely gave him an annoyed look like he should of expected this, making Tony shut his mouth. Trying hard not to tremble as he had never had anyone hold his hand before, especially when they were walking out in public. “Gosh your hands are clammy...” the comment had made Tony blush even more in embarrassment. “Relax...how are you supposed to hold hands with Bucky if you’re this nervous? He’s gonna have a hard time holding you if his hand keeps sliding off...”  Steve said with a smirk as he glanced down at the pouting brunette. “I’m sorry if I’m this nervous. I mean It is my first time holding hands with someone!” Tony defended himself as he tried to pull his hand away to no avail as Steve had only clamped onto it more. Face blushing with a stupid grin that made Tony’s heart flutter a bit. “I’m sorry...I’m just saying it’s better if you relax...” he said as he nudged the smaller teen with his elbow making Tony stumble to the side a bit, luckily Steve was still holding his hand tight or else he really would of fell.

Sam and Nat were busy gawking at Thor as he told them more stories about himself and his family. Steve huffed at that and settled to sit next to Bucky who was busy watching TV, at least Bucky didn’t seem all that interested in him. “What are we watching?” Steve asked with a smile as he sat down next to Bucky on the sofa. “ nothing really...I’m actually looking for that reality TV show where they show royal hybrids and their owners...Thor says there are only 15 episodes of that show...said him and his owner were in it one time..i think I remember it being on channel 9 or something..” Bucky said with full on concentration at the TV. Steve just sigh at that as he got up to go to the terrace instead. He didn’t think he could stand much more of the Royal Hybrid.
“Well…i wish we could stay and party like you young kids here but me and Tony have to get a few things done…you know boring grown up work…” Steve explained as he rolled his eyes tiredly for emphasis . “Awwweeee, but i still wanted to drink and get wet at the pool with the kids!” Tony pouted as he batted his thick lashes at the CEO. “Come on, your too old to be still doing that…” Steve laughed as he ushered Tony towards the kitchens glass door. Tony scoffed at the blond “excause you! I am still in my early 20’s! Ugh…Hanging out with him has really made me boring….” Tony said dramatically as he waved goodbye to his younger brother and his friend. Laughing when Steve got offended and tried to tickle his side.
Thor, hummed happily as he stretched a muscular arm behind slender shoulders, Playing with a few dark locks as he stared outside of his white and gold carriage. He was a prince from the kingdom of Asgard, Ruled by his wise and honorable father, King Odin. He had just heard of his friend's victorious battle against the Ruthless King Howard, even taking the mad King's only son Prince Anthony after the war was over. It came as no surprise to anyone that the only one who could have defeated the Mad king of Stark was another Mad one..and King Steven was indeed Mad when it came to the Stark Prince.
A warm smile graced the Hydra King’s face as he glances at his newly crowned queen sitting comfortable on the luxuriously large pillows beside his knees. Tony in turned smiled up at him with so much love and adorable the Hydra couldn’t help but lean down and claim the brunette’s soft lips. A cough from in front of them had him frowning as it interrupted their shared little moment together.
Right now the two were walking hand in hand as Steve held his head high, flaunting his exposed and bruised skin for the other omega’s to see. A few gave him the stink eye before glancing longingly at Tony who didn’t seem to notice as he was too busy glancing at Steve’s bruised skin. Still dumbstruck that Steve would let him mark him. And even more so that Steve was proud to show off that he was Tony’s. All while a few omega’s were trailing them behind. Boy was Tony an adorable oblivious alpha.
“Tony...” Steve sniffed as he pulled away to stare at his younger brother who looked absolutely lost as he was. “What about Peggy?..” Tony asked while looking away. “What? What about Peggy?” Steve asked with a confused look. “I...i saw you kissing her that night when she carried you inside the house..” Tony confessed as he glanced up at the stun blond. “Y-you saw that?” Steve asked with wide eyes. The brunette could only nod as he tried not to remember the image inside his head. “D-did you hear what i said after that?” Steve inhaled as he suddenly stared down at Tony with lidded eyes. The brunette shook his head as he shivered when he felt Steve’s hot breath brush against his ear. “Well..if you had stayed longer..you would of heard me moan out your name..” Steve whispered as he gently stroked the brunette’s face with his fingers, mouth pressing against the other’s earlobe as he continued to tell the brunette of what had happened after he left. “ i was so drunk that the minute i thought i was finally back home I thought i was kissing you..” Steve trailed as he bit Tony’s ear, making the younger teen shiver. “Peggy had admitted she was thinking of someone else as well but she had been surprised to hear me moan out your name, thankfully she just smiled as she promised me she wouldn’t tell anyone as long as i helped her with her problem with Daniel..”
“Why are there two demons watching TV inside your house?” Steve asked as he sat down on the sofa. Eyes never leaving the two horned brunettes leisurely sitting on the floor. long tails circling around each other as they continued to watch the commercial that was being shown on the flat screen. Completely ignoring the intruder as if knowing that Steve was no threat to their owner. “Oh...i bought them off a demon auction, you know I’ve always wanted a demon but just never had the time to go find one...and look! finally i did!...” the redhead grinned as she sat down the sofa next to him. Steve cock an eye at that. “Yeah...two...why would you think getting two demons would be okay? You can’t even fully take care of yourself. Let alone two demons?” Natasha rolled her eyes at that as she snapped her hands to get their attentions. The two brunettes instantly turned their heads at their owner. Making Steve widen his eyes.
“Huh oh..ugh yeah..sorry was just thinking of something while…you were um…busy…” the brunette coughed as he realized that Steve had decided to wear a plain white sando. Which somehow made him even more hotter than when he was half naked.
Steve Rogers, the tall, bulky and most popular guy in school was huffing with sweat as he stared at him with that strange look again that always seemed to make Tony squirm. He did not like this, he did not like this...what was the star quarter back doing in the middle of his door step, in front of his house. “Ca-can i help you?” Tony asked as he blinked up at the blond. Steve seemed to be thinking about something as his eyes seemed to be unfocused. Only snapping out of his thoughts when Tony had tried closing the door on his face. Out of pure reflex as he didn’t know what to do with the scary way Steve had been staring at him.
Tony himself couldn’t help but to gape at the adonis walking beside him, holding his tiny hand like it actually belonged there. Steve’s hand had been holding his hand so gently ever since the blond had arrived at his doorstep to pick him up. He had even brought a basket that he said contained some homemade cheese burgers his mom had made. Tony liked homemade food..his mother was always too busy to prepare a home cooked meal for him and his also busy dad. So whenever someone offered him homed cooked foods, he was always weak to resist. He remembers telling the tall blond this as he seemed to write it in his notes.
He had been so nervous when Tony had stepped outside the village gate. Wearing the traditional robe that an omega wore when finally being presented to them, the large alpha couldn’t help but notice the way the long silky robe clung to the omega’s slender form. A light blush appeared on his face before he smiled as he noticed as well  how the robe’s golden petals surrounding the vibrant red silk complemented the omega’s fair skin. Making Tony look even more radiant and youthful in Steve’s eyes. And when the omega human finally looked up with his hazel brown eyes beneath his lushes thick lashes. Steve could barely breath as he held his breath at how beautiful Tony was smiling up at him. A shiver ran down his spine as he felt his cheeks turn redder at the Omega in front of him. The human villagers had even clipped on small golden ornaments on the omega’s curly locks. And placed small jewels around his neck and wrist. A small part of his chest peaking out as the robe fell off his slender shoulder’s a bit. Exposing soft skin and a rosy pink nipple, the omega’s face  redden at that and quickly apologized as he tried to hold the robe in place. Steve bit his lips as he watched the tiny human smile embarrassingly at him. Gosh was he cute! Steve hoped he didn’t think what he was doing was really a sacrifice. Because that was the last thing Steve wanted his chosen human to think with their bond.
Now the hybrid’s territorial side was showing again as he growled dangerously at the other hybrid who also wanted to come near the brunette. Tony sighted as he trued to wiggle his way out of his unhappy hybrid. “Okay Steve! Enough! Please!! Thor has an owner that he wants to get back too! There’s nothing to be upset about! I know you don’t like sharing but Thor really needs our help in tracking down his owner right now and we can’t do that if you wont be nice to him!” Tony snapped as he stared seriously at Steve. The sudden harshness of his voice surprising the hybrid. Tony rarely raised his voice at the blond and right now he was doing it making Steve go beat red at the embarrassment. With a defeated look Steve unwillingly let go of the brunette who was now thankful he could breath again. Turning right away to glanced up at the other blond hybrid who was staring at him. “Alright...now we are all going to get along here alright? I don’t want anyone hissing at anyone...” Tony trailed as he glanced at Steve who was pouting adorably at him. “Now i want you two to have a little hand shake and if possible get along” Tony smiled as he patted the two massive hybrids on the sides. Steve awkwardly took a step forward to bring his hand up as he honestly wanted to please Tony, Thor in turned smiled at that and grabbed his hand with a strong grip, pulling Steve towards him in a harsh way. the unexpected blond humbled as he landed on the other hybrids chest. A tight squeeze nearly suffocating him as Thor gave him a bear hug while laughing loudly before releasing him and turning to the retreating brunette. “Hey you know Thor buddy...it’s alrig-off!” Tony huffed as Thor also gave him a bear hug, Steve immediately jumping at the hybrid as he tried to free the gasping brunette.
He could only shake his head as tears trailed down his face. If he were to bend down for the King he would lose his title as Stark Prince. Even though Hydra had burned his Kingdom to ashes, he was still a Stark..he didn't know if any of his people had Survived the battle. But he didn't think they would want to know that the only remaining heir of the Stark legacy had bowed down so easily after the attack. Not after Howard had done his very best to not surrender, eventually killing himself when he heard the Hydra King's General was finally Marching deeper inside the castle, followed with a few of his Hydra men killing the King's last few soldiers.
“What? Wait..he seriously never jumped at her during her heat?” Sharon asked wide eye as her two hybrids looked at Steve wide eyed as well. The big blond couldn’t help but blush as he squirmed uncomfortably in his chair. “Well....his body was a bit messed up when Tony bought him to me...” Bruce answered.  “Speaking of heat..I’ve got to stack up on my food supplies again..poor Nats gonna be in heat again this week..” Clint scratched his head as he glanced down at his hybrid who was busy playing with Steve’s toys. “Oh...would you love for one of the boys to come help Nat out?..” Sharon offered. “No it’s okay...i always take care of her during her heats...I wouldn’t want them wreaking the place..you know how They are when around a female in heat” Clint squinted his eyes and furrowed his brows at the thought. “Yeah..i get it..” Sharon agreed.
now that Tony thought about it Steve did save him. just not the way he thought the hydra would, Steve had alway promised him back then that he would make him his queen, even when he knew Tony was engaged to prince Tiberius from a neighboring kingdom.
From the corner of Tony’s eyes he could see Pepper dressed formally as she stood next to Loki and Thor who had taken up a seat near the king’s general, Sir James Barnes or as Steve liked to call him Bucky.
“I ugh...was...I’m not brave...” Tony managed to say as he felt like melting at the blond’s gaze. “I saw what you wrote, about Bucky...Were those true?..” oh God this was it. Steve was going to pulverize him. He probably thought it was disgusting how Tony had wrote all his feelings about his best friend. He was probably here trying to protect Bucky, and warn Tony not to ever go near them again. Tony held his breath before swallowing hard as he nodded at the other teen. Too scared to form words he closed his eyes. Waiting for a fist to collide with his face as he did. But nothing came though. Curiously he opened his left eye as he wondered what was going on. Steve was just staring at him a look, not like all the other looks he had given the brunette. It was different..softer..sad. A cough had brought Tony back as he realized Steve had started saying something. “-And if you’d like i...could help you out with that..”
Thor’s booming voice startled the other blond hybrid as he turned around to see Thor stupidly smiling at him. “ i already know all their Stories...and yours, and I’m not your friend okay?” Steve scoffed as he turned his back at Thor again. Frustration radiation off of him as the other hybrid slowly walked towards him. “I am sorry, i only wish to get to know you better..if i were to be staying with you and Master Tony for a while..I’d only wish to be friends with you..I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same..ugh i shall be going then..” Thor drawled as he slowly turned back inside. And then Steve sigh as he felt like he was being a total jerk towards the other. “Thor wait...I’m sorry...it’s not that I don’t wanna be your friend it’s just that..I’m..I’m jealous..”Steve confessed. A blush rising up his cheeks as he watched the other hybrid furrow his brows at him. “I am sorry? Why would you be jealous?” Thor asked with confusion written all over his face. Steve breathed nervously before finally explaining to the other hybrid how he really felt. “ I...mean...look unlike you i never had an easy life, okay...i grew up with absolutely nothing until..until i met Tony..until he found me..and gave me so much i never even thought i could ever have..And i don’t mean the clothes or food or the things his given me..although i do appreciate all of that..but i mean he gave me his time..his attention..his love..and i love him more than anything in this world as well! Probably more than my own life, and I would do anything to stay by his side and be with him. Even fight off anyone who’d try to take him away from me...” Steve finally admitted as he stared seriously at Thor who was also staring at him with an understanding expression. “I understand..believe me when i say that i do relate to how you feel for Tony...but..tell me, why would you be jealous of me? I only intend to thank him and you as well for taking me in and helping me find my owner..” Thor asked as he stepped closer to the other who was blushing bright red now. “ i..i know, i know you have your owner that you need to go back too but..it’s just that seeing Tony be so amazed by you..i mean your a Royal hybrid! And I’m just a Hybrid that had ben abandon on the streets as a kit...surviving on nothing but garbage..i was just afraid he’d realize how pathetic and useless i really was compared to other hybrids...hybrids like you...” Steve trailed as he felt a sting in his chest as the words finally left his mouth, Overwhelmed by the truth finally coming out of him. Breathing a bit to steady himself before continuing. “ and i was honestly afraid you’d want to stay and...and take him away from me...” he said as he closed his eyes. Feeling absolutely drained before he finally opened his eyes and stared at a very amused Thor. What? Was he really smiling right now? After Steve had just poured his heart out he was smiling like an absolute goof. “What’s so funny?” Steve demanded with a hurt look.
Tony had a daze look on his face as he stared at the senior who was walking outside the football field with his tall bulky blond friend. James ‘Bucky’ Barnes. The junior sighed as he fixed his glasses. Everyone in school had a thing for the two seniors walking by. But most of them were head over heals for the blond one who was more athletic, taller, bigger and more intimidating than the brunette. Bucky was a bit more laid back looking, wasn’t as big and massive as the other but still had some muscles to show off.. and he was the one that made Tony  blush whenever he saw him. The junior brunette had been having a small crush on the older brunette ever since the guy had helped him in the cafeteria two months ago. Tony had almost fell face flat on the floor if it wasn’t for the senior’s fast reflexes. Tony had been so stunned at seeing the senior give him a charming grin paired with his deep blue gaze. “Careful there doll..might hurt yourself..” Tony couldn’t even blink as he tried to form words as he felt his heart thump fast in his chest, but nothing would come out as his mind had been engulfed by deep blues. Only jolting out of the other’s arms when a rough voice had interrupted his thoughts. Bucky’s blond best friend was staring intently at him. Eyes narrowing a bit as Tony stood frozen with fright. The feeling earlier immediately replaced with something else as he scurried away.
It was absolutely horrifying to suddenly see Pepper so thin and pale in front of him earlier. And It had been more horrifying how Steve had snapped and threaten to kill his already weak friend. Pepper and him had gone way back before he had even met Steve. And with the horror of seeing pepper die in Steves own hands, he just couldn’t bare to hold his ground anymore. He had tried desperately for weeks to not bow down for Steve. Done his very best to hold the Stark pride..his father’s pride. He’d actually managed not to break no matter how many times Steve had played with him, humiliated him ( by fucking him senselessly in front of his men) and even denied him of his own release..but seeing pepper get crashed with Steves enormous big hands was enough to break him completely. He’d shed everything behind if it meant keeping his friend alive.
“Hey. Don’t look at them. Look at me.” Steve’s Dom voice is quiet but commanding. Tony looks to him. “Are you alright?” His eyes get teary. It’s over. He had a panic attack in public, and now he’s in the arms of a Dom, who obviously knows him.
As soon as the doors shut, they met in the middle, crashing together like a tidal wave of desire. Steve backed Tony into the wall of the elevator, reaching for his top buttons. A sudden ding sent them bolting apart, smirking at each other as an elderly couple got on the elevator. Tony couldn’t stop grinning because Steve wouldn’t stop looking at him.
Groggily, Tony dresses and follows Steve to a black SUV that Tony doesn’t recognize- a rental, probably to keep the press from recognizing the car. Steve packs the trunk and opens the door for Tony. Tony slips into the seat and quickly falls asleep in the seat.
There’s a small snap and then Steve growls, throwing a broken allen wrench across the room. He sits up with a huff, then notices Tony at the door. “Tony?”
Steve’s big hand brushes his hair. Tony looks up to find a fork of salad hovering before his lips. A flush spreads across his body as he takes the proffered bite. Steve rewards him with a beautiful smile that makes Tony’s whole body buzz with pleasure.
“Green! Oh my God, green, please!” Steve pushes in and Tony screams. His orgasm is so fucking close, only held back by the ring around his dick. “Fuck!”
Steve moans around Tony’s cock. The vibrations send a tingle to his entire body. Steve’s hand cups his balls, rolling them gently. Tony’s fingers tighten in Steve’s hair.
Steve chuckles and pecks Tony’s cheek. “Alright, fine. But I’m paying for dinner next time, got it?” Tony’s heart flutters.
Tony never made a big deal out of his birthdays. His father forgot them or turned them into big banquets so he could make more business connections. Before Afghanistan, he threw parties a la Gatsby, letting people get drunk and completely forget about what the party was for in the first place while Tony sat in quiet seclusion- occasionally making an appearance for the tabloids, maybe find a partner for the night.
He tightens the last screw into place. “Yes! Yes I’m a genius!” Tony cackles, their accidental kiss totally forgotten as he throws himself at Steve. Steve catches him and hugs him tight, laughing. “If you’re such a genius, why’d it take you three hours?” Steve teases.
Tony moans, hips thrusting into Steve’s hand. Steve speeds up the pace, grabbing lube to make the slide more comfortable. “Steve…” Tony whines. He can feel his orgasm coming, building up and threatening to explode. “Steve,” he says again. “Come for me, Tony. I want to watch you come.” Tony gasps, hips bucking as he comes on Steve’s hand and a little of his chest.
“Do you have lube?” Tony freezes. Nodding stiffly, he points to the drawer. Steve opens the drawer, pulling out the lube and a condom. There are tons of different sizes in there, because Tony had no idea which one to pick. Judging by the condom, he’s pretty big. Tony swallows nervously. Will it hurt? He’s read about tearing. How much prep should they do? Oh God he’s so not ready for this.
He’d come out, of course, after his parents’ deaths, but his dating life was vague and varied enough to prevent anyone from really delving into his submissive nature.
When their tongues meet, Tony gasps in surprise. Steve grins into their kiss; he must have found Steve’s tongue ring. Steve parts their lips, hushing Tony softly when he tries to seek out another kiss. “What’s your safeword, baby?”
He can’t. His chest is so tight. The shrapnel must be moving. He’s going to die. His lungs won’t fill with air. “You can do it, baby. Follow me. In-“ he inhales, “-out. Just like that.” Tony does his best to obey. He wants to be good for Steve, but his chest hurts so bad. He can barely hiccup in any air.
Tony clutches at Steve’s shirt. “I built your furniture. I deserve rewards.” He’s pulling Steve close, lips puckering. Steve laughs, light and airy. “We’ve still got the bed frame, the desk, and the bookshelf.” Tony whines, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder.
Things are beginning to make a lot of sense. “So, will you go out with me? I know I don’t look like a proper Dom or anything, but I really enjoyed myself tonight. I’d like to keep seeing you.”
A giant grin spread on the Hydra’s face as he loosen his hold on the woman and drop her next to Tony who crawled to hug her as she coughed for air. “You’ll knell for me? You say..” Steve asked as he watched Tony look up at him. A short nod was all the Brunette could do as he answered a ‘yes’ to the King. “Just...please..let her live...” Tony begged with his cracked voice. Pepper burrowed her face in his arms as he tried to protect her.
King Steve had a dangerously handsome frown plastered on his face. Tony had frozen in utter silence at the unexpected present his two visitors had given him.
ever since Sunday night when Steve had come home at God knows what time he had. Which Tony decided he shouldn’t really care anymore if he was ever going to learn to live without the blond, thankfully the older brunette was there that night to help him. Bucky was always there for him whenever Steve wasn’t, ever since 6th grade when the blond had introduced him to the older brunette. Bucky was like their other brother that always came by their place uninvited and most nights slept over when he got into a fight with his parents. He was one of the few people Tony really liked being around with. The older brunette was always so comfortable to be around and was almost as protective as Steve was when it came to Tony. That’s why when Steve hadn’t come home yet when it was already near midnight Bucky had officially announced that he would sleep over to keep the younger teen company, not wanting to leave the smaller teen alone unattended. Tony had scoffed at that but smiled inwardly at how sweet the older teen could be sometimes, Giving the taller brunette a few pillows and blankets as he made sure his guess was settled right. Once he thought Bucky looked comfortable enough he started to get off the cough But before he could stand up a pair of long arms had suddenly pulled him down, making the smaller teen yelp as he fell on top of his brother’s beat friend who was grinning devilishly at him. Tony flicked the older teens nose as he tried to get up again but to no avail as Bucky’s arms tighten more around him.
The test only ran about an hour before Bruce told told them the result. “ well..i don’t think i need to tell you that Steve here is severely malnourished, his underdeveloped for his species age..lacking a lot of the traits his species need in order to grow..but that can be fixed though..all he really needs is a bit more iron in his body as well as zinc..” Bruce trailed as he looked up from his papers as he glanced at Tony. “ he also needs a lot of security..I don’t know what happened to him but it seems like life hasn’t been fair to him..” he sigh as he watched the blond hybrid play with a small ball Bruce had given him. “Is he yours now though? I mean what do you plan to do with him?” Bruce asked as he went back to look at the papers, Tony glanced at the blond before shrugging. “I really don’t know, i mean..when i found him last night something just pulled on my strings you know..i just couldn’t leave him there..I didn’t really plan anything? I just thought maybe I’d help him and find him a good home..” the brunette confessed as he watched the vet walk towards the blond hybrid.
The two then just stared at each other through the small screen. Worries fading away as the two felt content. After a few more minutes of comfortable silence Tony finally felt sleep take over him. Blinking a couple of times at his Hybrids smiling face he whispered goodnight
After a few more minutes Tony decided that Steve probably didn’t want to come with him. With a tired sigh he stood up and slowly walked back home with his head down. Glancing a bit to see the tiny Hybrid stay where he was. He waved goodbye before walking steadily back home again. A few steps later however he realized the blond was actually following him. A wide smile spread on his face as he gestured for Steve to come closer and walk beside him.
The apple was a bit high up but it was the one Tony wanted, it was absolutely red with just the perfect size for his palm. When he had thought he had finally grabbed it, a branch he was stepping on had snapped. Causing him to fall to the ground. Thankfully one of the many servants had caught him, strong arms quickly wrapping around him as his apple fell to the ground.
Except when Steve was out hanging with his friends late again. Which was alright as well since Tony tended to do that from time to time when his friends invented him. This time however though Steve hadn’t texted Tony what time he’d be back. Tony frowned at that as he placed the cold dinner into the microwave so that the older sibling could just heat it up later.
The whole team swore they had never met a more chilled out omega like Tony, who never seemed to get angry or jealous. Even when Steve had ended up helping Bucky through his heat when the omega had suddenly started heating up after a tiring mission. Clint and Sam had whistled at hearing the billionaire suddenly nod in understatement that Steve would be the only one Bucky would be comfortable with to share his heat.
“Nonsense omega...you are much too weak to take proper care of yourself...toys are nowhere near the feel as a real warm knot..” Loki trailed as he pressed heated kisses on the flushed out inventor’s cheeks. It felt absolutely amazing as every kiss blew away small aches that Tony felt. They had been trying to contact Steve but for some reason he was unreachable. Thus, making the whole pack come to aid their trouble omega.
Steve frowned at the Brunette's sudden silence. Deciding to Smack the Prince's round ass as he pinched the bruised nipples even harder. Tony cried at the harsh treatment before coming hard as the King continued to thrust up inside of him.
Loki, the darker haired prince simply nodded as Thor eyed him lovingly while pressing soft kisses on the back of his hand. While one of his hands sneaked in to wrap around the back of the other's neck. Loki leaned into it as the blonds kiss began to travel. " You think we would get along with the Stark Prince?" He asked as the blonds lips settled on his neck. "Yes... of course.." Thor replied yet not quite focus on the subject as he continued to bite and suck at the delicate skin.
The two teens shared a knowing smile as they both held on tight to each other while laughing at theirs who congratulated them.
And so that’s what he did. After school had ended the brunette had immediately dashed towards his house. Slamming the door shut as he panted for breath. He was safe now, and he’d didn’t need to worry anymore because he was never going back ever again.
When they had finally stopped, Tony’s eyes were lidded due to feeling a bit dizzy and overwhelmed with everything he was feeling and thinking at the moment. Bucky must of been feeling the same way with the kiss as the older brunette had just stared with soft apologetic eyes at him. Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he made it clear that it was alright. That smile had died down however when he had realized the door to the bedroom was wide open, hazel brown eyes widening in shock as he then realized who was standing in front of the open door.
“Hey...Steve home?” The handsome taller brunette asked as he smiled at Tony, raising his right hand to show a box of vanilla ice cream. Tony grinned at that, he really could use some ice cream right now, especially vanilla. He really hoped Bucky would give him some even if Steve wasn’t home. The older teen was always generous to him though. “No...just went out actually...wont be back till late..” he rolled his eyes before giving the senior another grin as he stared at the ice cream. Making Bucky laugh as he placed his hand on Tony’s head to ruffle his hair. “ well...be a damn shame to let this go to waste...wanna watch some movies and eat this with me instead?” The words were enough to warm the younger brunette’s heart as he took the other’s arm and lead him into the house.
Before Tony could snap out of his hysteria at seeing his omega so different, Steve had suddenly enveloped him in an embrace while kissing him on the cheeks like he always did making Tony completely melt and relax into the embrace. his brain finally relaxing when his nose was met with the omega’s familiar scent. Steve, Steve, Steve...
God was Tony cute. Steve just wanted to go on over his side of the table and hug him so tight till all the uncontrollable feelings had left him. But no, he was going to play it cool. Tony was here because he thought Steve was helping him with Bucky. That’s why he was sparkling like a cute twinkling star right now in front of Steve, he was thinking about Bucky. Right..Tony had a crush on Bucky.
Tony was startled to hear his brother’s voice call him. He didn’t want to see him, he didn’t want to face him just yet. So he hid, he buried his head under his pillow and didn’t move.
“Oh…well..i can just leave this Pizza right here then and-“ She began as she gestured to the elevator. Not wanting to intrude on the two teammates.
“Yeah?...” the redhead asked as she glanced up at him before turning around to where he was staring. immediately she felt her heart strings getting pulled at the sight.
Thor had heard stories of the Stark prince from his dear friend, Stories of how beautiful and breath taking the man was that the first time Steve had layd eye's on him, he had thought he had died and went to heaven, how the prince was kind and fair to his servant's and bore no hatred for those who have wronged him..even his own father who had never treated him as a son. Thor had always been curious of the Prince who had captivated his Friends heart , so the moment he had heard of the news from his people he right away sent for one of his messengers to inform the king of his visit as he wanted to finally meet the soon to be Queen of Hydra.
“Steve...this is Thor..” Tony smiled as he introduced Thor to Steve. “He’ll be staying with us for a while..” Tony said as the other hybrid jumped off the cough and walked steadily towards him, wrapping his massive arms around the brunette and pressing his face against him as he purred. Steve instantly tensed at the other hybrids action as he hissed venomously at him. The hybrid named Thor merely stared at him as he continued to press against the tiny brunette.
Tony couldn’t help to stare for a bit before realizing what he was doing and looking away. He felt like a pervert standing there while the other was half naked, wandering around and looking for a new shirt to wear.   The shorter teen didn’t even know what he was doing there? Surely there was nothing else they could do for the rest of the day in his room.
Tony noticed the blond's small action and smiled meaningfully at them. "I decided to let him sleep the night and maybe get him to a vet tomorrow..get him checked out and see what i can do.." Tony said as he opened his door. "Oh! Nat's vet is amazing... really knows his stuff..if you want you can take him there!" Clint suggested as he gently ushered Natasha inside his door. "Great! I'll ask for the address tomorrow.." Tony beamed as he went inside his apartment.
So when Steve had finished eating some left over pizza, the blond had hesitantly called out to the demon to come inside his room. The demon had instantly sprinted from across the door and landed by his side in a matter of minutes. Tail flickering behind as he made himself comfortable in his master’s bed. Steve smiled at him as he placed his hand on top of Tony’s head again. Loving how Tony would lean into his touch and purr like a cat. When he had glanced at the small clock on his nightstand Steve could see it was already eight at night. Probably a good time to start feeding Tony. For some reason the incubus wasn’t wearing his clothes anymore. (Which Steve guess was probably somewhere around the house) He only had a tiny thong that did wonders on Steve’s imagination. With a nervous inhale Steve gently pulled his new demon’s face towards his. Blushing a bit when Tony blinked curiously at him. “A-are you hungry Tony?...” Steve asked with a shaky voice as he stared at him.
Raging with jealousy, he barked for her to step forward. He didn’t know how she had managed to escape but he was certainly grateful she was here now. Now he could kill her himself and finally have the Prince’s attention on him.
But he didn’t know what else he could do to get the brunette to notice him, let alone actually talk to him. Every time he had the chance to go near the shorter teen, the brunette always ended up bolting like lighting, running away like Steve was death itself. Bucky had told him numerous times he really needed to work on his facial expressions when he liked someone.  He couldn’t help it if he had a hard look every time Tony saw him. He’d seen the younger teen stare at Bucky a few times which always put him off since he wanted the smaller brunette to look at him instead. A scowl would appear on his face as he’d watch with longing eyes at the other teen staring at his best friend.
Steve had noticed this and tried his best not to stare back at the adorable way Tony was looking at him, seriously Steve wanted to kiss him so bad right now. Steve swallowed hard as he felt himself sweat, The smaller teen will never know the trouble and horrible suffering Steve had went through just to find the perfect outfit for their date. It had even took him half an hour just to comb his hair the right way until he said screw it and put a cap on instead.
“Oh my God Steve! It’s just you...” Peggy breathed with relief as she climbed off someone else’s lap. Tony’s brown eyes widen even more when he realized it was Daniel Sousa who Peggy had just been straddling, the school principal’s son who had just recently graduated high school last year. Tony furrowed his brows at the sight of the two together inside the car. What was Peggy doing on Daniel’s lap? Wasn’t she together with Steve? His thoughts were cut off when he heard his older brother start to talk.
The two were frowning at him though, confusion on their faces as they stared at their tired uncle. “Wait...did you say..introduced us to each other?” Steve questioned as he leaned towards his uncle who raised a brow at him. “Yes...i did...you see the thing is...you two aren’t really brothers...”
He was the worst, Steve groaned as he finally sat down on the empty classroom where he had texted Tony to meet him.  He couldn’t believe what he was doing, acting as if he was actually willing to help the younger teen win over his best friend that was currently courting someone else, he was bad...awful! horrible! He should kill himself.
Tony smiled and gave his thanks to the two alpha’s and beta that were currently fussing about inside his room. Head resting on strong sturdy pecs as lidded brown eyes watched the three men bring pillows and blankets to his nest. He was thankful that Loki had let him settle comfortably agaisnt him. Since his whole body had been burning in excruciating pain from his heat the whole day.
The music had gotten louder making it hard for the brunette to hear the tall blond standing in front of him. “WHAT?!” Tony yelled as he tried to clear out the music in his head. Steve moved even closer yelling something that Tony couldn’t seem to catch. “WHAT WAS THAT?…I CANT HEAR YOU!”
Staring outside the terrace Steve frown in irritation as his friends had started laughing out loud with Thor. Why did Tony have to bring him here? He would of been perfectly fine by himself inside their apartment, Honestly he would of.
More whispers could be heard. Before one blond haired alpha shouted “he stood you up!” The look on everyone’s face at that as Killian turned red with embarrassment and anger at the thought that Tony had left him. “No! Maybe he’s just hiding or or...just fucking search for him!” Killian shouted as the rest started to scramble.
The sudden realization was enough to frighten the brunette a bit. Maybe he should start being more independent and stop seeking the blond every time they weren’t in school. Everything would be so much easier if he didn’t spend as much time with Steve at home. He was just too attached to his older brother that he hadn’t realized how dependent he hd become towards the older teen. He was probably going to become a burden when they got older and he’d still be clinging to the other like a little lost child. He really didn’t want that, and so with his final thoughts Tony had decided to keep away as best as he could from the blond. Give him as much space as he needed and who knows, maybe Tony might find someone else he could be with when he got older.
Steve growled as he thrusted faster inside the brunette's already limp body, groaning at the Brunette's hole tightened around his cock. Making him spill his hot seed into the Prince's abused hole. After a few seconds he slumped down on his throne once he felt he had emptied himself into the other's body. Tony nuzzled against him as they Both tried to regain themselves from their sexual high. "I'm s-sorry..." Tony mumbled through the King's wide chest. Curling in as large hands began to comb his hair.
The older Stark had been a bit concerned when he had met The younger, scrawny Rogers standing beside his father. Honestly saying the 14 year old omega looked a bit sickly. Howard was having doubts if the omega could even carry his future grand children with his frail body. But when the blond boy had grinned at Tony who had hidden behind him yet again. Howard couldn’t help but smirk when he had heard the blond Omega say to his father that Tony was stunning. and asked to greet him if he could. Joseph had nodded at that and immediately Steve Confidently began walking towards the Starks, thin hands instantly grabbing the shorter teen’s softer one’s as he pulled Tony gently towards him. Making the shy Alpha blush brightly at the sudden contact from the omega.
Steve and Thor had wide broad smiles plastered on their handsome faces as they sat on the edge of the pool inside the spacious bath chamber connected to the king’s chamber. Steve could feel his heart thump inside his chest as he watched his beautiful bride walk slowly towards him. His tiny red silk cloth hang loosely around his waist, no doubt Loki’s doing. He needed to remind himself to thank the dark haired Asgardian Prince. It was clear he wanted Tony to look absolutely fuckable for Steve that night. He could barely control himself as he watched with lust filled eyes as Tony and Loki stepped into the water slowly taking off their only piece of clothing, revealing their half hard erections that looked absolutely delicious. Especially Tony’s, Steve thought with a smirk. Tony yelped a bit when Steve had impatiently pulled him down onto his lap. Splashing a bit of water outside the pool in doing so. Thor chuckling at them before he glanced at Loki who had settled himself on his lap.
The two heads snapped up as he continued to stare down at them. “ tonight you will bow down to me in front of the entire kingdom to see..and lady Pepper the best view” Steve finished with a predatory smile before yanking Tony harshly off of the red head. “Now..” he trailed as he squeezed the brunette tight against him. “Take her away” he snapped for his guards to drag a red eyed pepper away. “Who knows...maybe one day I’ll have good use of her” he said with a lethal grin.
Steve sniffed at his pillow as he lay on their bed. Tony had finally emerged from the bathroom. Freshly clean and had rubbed off all his arousing scent from earlier, Replacing it with a fresh lavender soapy smell instead. Tony sigh as he saw the giant hybrid laying face down on their bed looking absolutely sad as he entered.
I hope to hear how this whole story had made you guys feel because this was just warm and butterfly hugs for me 😊❤️
A few moments later a knock on the door had startled him. He stared at the clock, it was past seven already, they usually never had anyone of their friends come over at this time. He wondered who could be knocking his door, Steve had a key so he didn’t need to knock to be let in. Once Tony turned the doorknob he was surprised to see familiar blue’s staring at him.
Brown eyes instantly widen as the words echoed inside his head. “She just left with her sister, but…we’re going to see each other again next weekend…” Steve smiled like a child who just got a new bike for Christmas.
Hope you guys forgive me for the long wait.. there's more to come from these two and poor Pepper..hope to hear your thoughts on what's happening
“I ugh...just don’t like that Bucky’s still hang up over his ex-boyfriend that dumped him two months ago over summer...and i really want the dude to get over it..been sulking way too long really...” Steve trailed as he licked his lips that looked a little dry. “And I’ve seen you stare at him..it isn’t hard to see you like the guy..” Tony blushed at that, not knowing he was so obvious about his feelings for the senior. “Look if you like him, I’m down with that...i know your a good guy...better than all those people trying to get on Bucky’s pants..and if i were the one to decide, I’d chose you to be with him..”
If you have the time a Motivational comment, like how did this chapter make you feel? What are your expectations? would really be nice to read..I’d love to read your thoughts ❤️Your lovely comments could really help me finish this faster XD...
Little did he know that a certain bulky blond had already entered the diner they were eating in. blue eyes scanning the place before spotting him. With a wide smile forming on his face the omega started to move towards them.
“Easy...i just give you some tips and pointers on what he likes..and what you should do to get his attention.” Tony beamed at that. “Okay...well what do you think we should do first?” Tony asked as he came closer, feeling more comfortable with the blond now that he was sure Steve really was helping him. “Well first...we get these glasses off..” Steve said seriously as he took the objects off of Tony’s face. Making the shorter teen whine as he couldn’t really see very well without them. Tony all of a sudden felt very vulnerable as Steve had taken away his sight..the sudden silence also bothered him since for some reason Steve wasn’t saying anything. “Ugh...is everything alright?...” Tony asked as he tried to look at Steve, not really seeing the blond clearly. Another minute had pass before the blond had finally said something. “Ugh yeah...so i ugh just wanted to see how you look without your glasses again...and um..yeah you better wear them..” Steve explained as he handed Tony his glasses again. The brunette furrowed his brows at that, “..yeah i know...i look really awful..” the blond was quick to snap his head at that giving Tony a scary look as he did. “No..it’s not that...it’s just that..ugh...I just remembered Bucky likes people who wear glasses..” Steve quickly stated as he turned around, not showing his face to Tony who was smiling at the information. “Really?” He asked as he tried to move in front of Steve, who quickly shifted his gaze away from the shorter teen. “Yeah, yeah...so you’re good...tell you what how about we meet up every afternoon after school and i can teach you all the ways to get into Bucky’s heart..” Tony was practically radiating with joy at the other’s offer. “And on Saturdays as well...it would be better if we did this right..it’s hard if we only get so little time together-i mean with the teaching...afternoons are too short and i have to be home by eight so..” Tony was just nodding away, not really caring anymore because all he could think about was Him finally have the chance to be with Bucky. And all thanks to Steve, he really didn’t expect the blond to be so nice in helping him get to Bucky. Even if Steve was doing this mostly for his best friend, Tony was grateful for the blond’s offer. Who would of known that the scary looking Steve Rogers was really a nice, sweet and caring guy.
When the bus would finally stop and everyone was busy getting up, Steve would quickly steal a kiss from the brunette before getting up as well and following the crowd. “ STEVE! “ one of the blond’s friends would shout at him once they were on campus. “TONY!” Someone would shout at the brunette from his clique as well. The two would glance at each other with wide smiled before finally departing and going on their separate ways.
Tony walked down the large hall with as much jewelry as he could carry. His head held high as he walked steadily to the king’s well polished throne. Steve was seated waiting and ready for Tony to approach him, and Just like Tony he had wore nothing but the dark silk around his waist. His large magnificent chest bare for the world to see. Tony swallowed as he saw the large handsome king’s perfect physic, Muscles everywhere as his bright blue eyes grew dark as he stared intensely at Tony.
When he had woken up the next morning, he had never felt so tired in his entire life like he did that morning. His whole body ached from sleeping in a fetal position against the door. He didn’t want to go out of his room, he didn’t want to go down and face the older blond. He just wanted to curl in his bed and forget everything ever happened. and so he did just that, he crawled into his bed and started to drift off again.
“Oh! No…absolutely not…well, i just thought i’d bring you some pizza since you’ve been working so hard..” Pepper said as she offered the box infront of the two men. “It’s okay…Steve brought me coffee and donuts…” the brunette gestured to his desk. “And thanks to his magical fingers im all up and ready to finish up in here. Just give me an hour and i will be all done!” Tony smiled as he started to botton up his shirt back.
When Steve had pulled away he had a breathless face that seemed to radiate with so much joy that Tony couldn’t help but feel the butterflies in his stomach start to fly inside. Wow, Steve was absolutely handsome. If he hadn’t been so infatuated with Bucky, he would of really fallen head over heals for Steve...he thought with a pout. No, he couldn’t do that, and besides he had to remind himself that Steve was only being with him because of Bucky, and vice versa. Right Bucky...Bucky Barnes...James Bucky Bar-gosh Steve smelled really nice. What is he wearing?
Tony moaned in absolute pleasure as Steve jabbed into him with as much force as gravity would let him, bucking his hips faster and harsher into the mewling Prince. Sweat and pre-cum dripping off them as he continued his assault on the brunette's poor hole that had pre-cum already leaking out of it. Tony gasped as Steve pinched his erect nipples, playing with them as he trailed his tongue on the side of Tony's neck below his golden collar.
But  with his abnormally small size and pale skin Tony had to hand it to him, the tiny blond sure could stand his ground. Ready more than ever to take up a fight as he saw the brunette approach him. All Tony could do was hold both hands up as he slowly walked towards the fuming blond who’s eyes were already turning beat red in the dark. Luckily he had remembered his muffin that he had just bought and decided to try and give it as a peace offering to the angry Hybrid.
Once breakfast was over and Steve had assured Tony that he was full and absolutely happy Tony decided to check his phone and see if Clint had texted him the Vet’s address. And right on time the blond did, smiling happily Tony ushered Steve back to his room and helped him find something to wear. Luckily Tony still had a few of his old college shirts laying around and decided to give those to Steve. They were still a tiny bit big on the hybrid but it was better than nothing. The baggy pants however looked a bit off making the brunette think it be best to buy the blond a pair of pants that actually fitted him. Once the two had dressed and made their way through the city Tony quickly sensed Steve go a bit stiff as they both walked inside the bright green building. “Hey..hey..don’t worry, I won’t let anyone hurt you...i just want to know if everything is alright with you..this guy is going to help you alright?” Tony reassures the trembling hybrid before squeezing his hand. Steve merely stared at him but squeezed back as well. Tony smiled at that and went ahead to ring the counters bell. After a few seconds a smiling man came into view wearing a white coat. “Good morning what can i do for you today?” He asked politely even though it was pretty obvious with how small Steve was that there was a problem that needed to be checked with. Tony nudge at Steve’s direction before answering, “um yeah...i found this adorable little guy last night In an alley behind some trash...i brought him home and decided to see what i could do to help him..” he finished with a shrug while the other man nodded. “Well okay...we can take him at the back and take some test and see what we can do for him..oh I’m The vet by the way..names Bruce Banner” the man said with a smile while walking them into the backroom. “Tony Stark..” the brunette smiled back as he lead Steve in with him. “I’m a friend of Clint..uh..blond guy has a red haired Hybrid named..” “ ah..Natasha!” Bruce beamed in acknowledgment. Tony nodded as he felt Steve squeeze his arm. “Alright! So I’m just gonna do a few test on you and everything will be alright..okay buddy?” Bruce asked as he patted a plastic chair for Steve to sit on.
I hope you guys liked this chap...please tell me what you think with their situation, I’d love to hear
“Steve...let me go please...ugh, your hurting me..Steve! Ugh...let go!” Tony snapped as he tried to pull his wrist away from the blond’s strong grip while Steve lead them down the stairs, through a bunch of drunk seniors. When they had almost reached the door Tony had tried to pull harder as he didn’t like how Steve was treating him. shouting for the blond to let him go through the loud music. Steve had instantly turned to stare at him with raging blue eyes. “SO WHAT?! You can go get even more drunk and go back up there and make out some more with Bucky?!” Steve snapped as he towered over his little brother, grip tightening even more as Tony tried to pull away once again. “So what?! At least he doesn’t just fucking leave me alone for hours, while coming home drunk and ignoring me whenever were out in public! AT LEAST HE’S NOT MY BROTHER!” Tony yelled as he fought the tears that were trying to escape, Not caring who heard him anymore. Which he guessed no one did since the music was too loud and most of the people inside were already wasted or passed out.
Peter felt a pang of guilt at seeing Wade start to leave. Immediately running  to grab his arm. Making his boyfriend look at him with a small reasuring smile.
Eyes popping wide when Peter had leaned up to press a kiss on his boyfriend’s lips. Wade blinked a few times before kissing back and grinning even wider when their friends started to shout and cheer at the two supportively. “Guess the secret is out huh?…”
The date last Saturday had ended in a good note, after Steve had made him feel absolutely light headed when they had finished kissing for the seventh time. The blond teen had asked him to go watch his game on Friday as part of knowing how to be a good boyfriend. If he was ever going to be a supportive boyfriend to Bucky, he was going to have to start attending their games and cheer for them. Right, he hadn’t thought of that one, Thank God he had Steve to teach him that. Right now Tony had blushed a bright shade of red as he saw a couple of fellow students stare at them. “Umm...I didn’t know we could kiss here at school were everyone could see us...” Tony shyly admitted as he tried to fix his glasses. Steve just smiled a dazzling smile at that as he placed his hand around the smaller teen’s shoulder. “Well...if you’re ever gonna be with Bucky you should learn to be kissing in front of other people..the guy tends to be a real shower..” Steve chuckled as he guided Tony through the crowded hallway. “wow...i never thought he was...I’m so glad i have you Steve..” Tony said with a cute smile that made the senior kiss him again. Tony leaned into the kiss this time as he felt like he really should put more effort into these things since he was basically getting all these for free.
With a nod Tony nuzzled his head as he started blabbering about making a nice garden. Witch was alright with Steve, just as long as Tony was safe.
“Clint’s right!” Tony smiled with a fond expression. “ we’re all still young, whats the rush?…as long as we all got each other…we’ll be good for the next few years!”
Steve stared at his panting bride who had burrowed himself against Steve chest. “Yes...perhaps he would...would you two care to join us?” He glanced up with a smile.
As she stumbled forward, Steve rose to his feet. Knuckles cracking as he was ready to crush her windpipes. But as he was about to grab the skinny woman’s neck Tony had ran to cover Her with his body. The king’s jaw clenched as he ordered the prince to get out of the way.
This surpised update after a year, im a bit insecure right now since i haven’t written in a long time..so your thoughts are very important to me
“What? No don’t go! I was thinking you could stay over at my place since you’re here…” Tony trailed with a sad tone. “I dont know…we have to get up real early tomorrow for-“ before Pepper could finish. Steve had cut her off stating that she should really be there with her alpha. “Come on Pepper..Tony needs you..you wouldn’t want your alpha feeling lonely do you?”
Steve glanced at the clock where it said 7:30pm. The blond Hybrid sigh as he tried to finish his painting. Tony was supposed to be home 15 minutes ago, like he always did after work. The food that Steve had prepared had gotten cold and he guessed he’d have to microwave it once Tony got home. Steve always wanted to greet the man with warm home cooked meals, ever since had found out that Tony wasn’t really a good cook, Knowing only how to cook eggs. he made it his goal to learn how to bake and cook for the wonderful yet sometimes overly worked brunette. Tony was an engineer and always had blue prints and tools laying around the apartment which Steve was always happy to clean up after. He’d worry sometimes as the man would forget to sleep whenever he was designing something for a client or talking on the phone with his men or pepper. But no matter how busy Tony always got at work, he had always come Home on time for Steve to greet him. The Hybrid frowned as he swished his tail while waiting for his owner.
“Just now really...you know how Strict his father is...She’s been calling me none stop asking for favors, tryna get me to help her get on dates with him on ungodly hours since their being really sneaky about it..” Steve said with an exasperated smile. Tony was stunned, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing that Peggy all this time he had thought was with Steve, was actually calling the blond for favors. “ but...i see you all the time with her at school..you guys just look so...close..” Tony said as he ducked his head, trying to hide his embarrassment at admitting that he’s been watching the other when he wasn’t looking. “Just like how close you are with Pepper and Rhodey? I’ve seen the way you three interact with each other..you don’t know how many times i tried to remind myself that you guys are just friends..” Steve confessed with a shy smile, Fingers trying to get the brunette to look up at him.
With steady steps he quickly opened the cottage door to find that his home was empty. quickly sniffing the air As he tried looking around the house in search of his missing omega. When he had finally reached their room to find it also empty panic rose inside him as the omega usually didn’t step outside the cottage that much as he’d be too busy tinkering inside or preparing food at this time of day.
Tony could only nod as he shut his eye's. a Harsh pinch on one of his nipples made him jolt and moan out a sloppy 'yes' before being fucked roughly on the King's lap. " do you love it when i take you Tony? Do you..Fuck...love me.." the blond asked as he trailed his hand down to wrap around the Prince's neglected dick. "Y-yes...Stev–ahhh!!!...yeesss...i love you..." Tony moaned as he felt his release grew near.
And just as he yanked pepper free from Tony’s  arms, he gripped his large hand around her tiny neck and felt her struggle before suddenly growing limp. “I’LL KNELL FOR YOU!” Tony screamed as he collapsed on Steve’s feet. Arms around Steve’s waist as he begged for him to let go of the red head. The sudden outburst was enough to loosen Steve’s grip on the woman and stare down at Tony at his feet. “I...I’ll kneel for you Steve...just..just please let her live..please..” Tony answered with a broken voice as he stared up at the king.
“It’s okay...we’re only getting a collar and a leash...and some nice toys you’d like...nothing scary.” Steve said soothingly as he held his demon’s hand a little bit tighter. Tony nodded at that as he followed his master inside the shop. When Steve had rang the bell, there was a pissed off looking bold guy that seemed to be wearing an eyepatch on his left eye. Steve smiled at him as he asked if there were any nice collars for his new demon. The bold guy cocked an eye at him before glancing at Tony. Instantly leaning down to take a box and place it in front of the small demon. “Take your pick!” The man shrugged as Steve also gestured for Tony to go closer. When the little demon did, the man had quickly introduced himself as Nick Fury, the shop owner of the Demon Store. Steve also introduced himself as he smiled at the man. “He got your name on paper yet?” Fury asked as he gestured his head at the demon who was busy rummaging through the box. Steve shook his head at that as he told the other he had just gotten Tony that afternoon. “Oh...congratulations then. If you want, i do offer bonding papers for a lower price than others...want him to be officially yours right away?” Fury said with a raised brow that had Steve looking at the demon who was finally on his tiptoes as he tried to see further inside the box. Steve couldn’t help the stupid smile he had on as he nodded a yes at the shop owner. “Alright! Step on the back once you’ve done here...also feel free to look around...got everything else hanging already..” Fury said before turning to go inside the shop’s back door.
“Peggy? Yeah...right now? S-sure..sure...I’ll be there...no problem, anything for you doll..” Steve grinned as he glanced down at Tony who didn’t look up at him at hearing the other’s name. Once Steve had pressed end call and pocketed his phone away he quickly pressed a kiss on Tony’s cheek as he hurriedly run to the door, telling Tony he’d be back late and that he shouldn’t wait up for him. He didn’t even care to tell him why, and Tony didn’t think he wanted to know. As the door closed behind Steve, Tony slumped down his chair. Heart feeling like it would break into a million pieces at his brother’s absence.
But the alpha ignored it. Instead deciding to settle back next to the distressed omega. Heart thumping loudly as Steve had suddenly placed his head agaisnt the alpha’s lap. And before Tony knew it, he had finally relaxed once again. Hands playing with Steve’s locks as he wanted the omega to be the one being pampered this time around.
Blond’s warm breath on his skin. “What is it Sweety?” Tony asked as he maneuvered himself beneath the heavy hybrid. Steve just purred before rubbing his face against Tony’s cheeks.
“It’s okay..it’s only hot..just burned the front of my mouth and ruined my shirt, and probably have a first degree burn on my chest..nothing much”
Steve smiled as he nuzzled his face against Tony’s hair as they walked to their door. Scenting his beloved master as best as he could before a frown appeared on his face as he continued to sniff the engineer’s scent. He didn’t mind it at first since Tony had just arrived and was smelling of many things from his travel but now that he was sniffing Tony more closely he could smell a faint scent that wasn’t the brunette’s. Hissing a bit as he felt very territorial all of a sudden, Tony glanced at that with a furrowed brow. making Steve nuzzle his face again at the brunette in apology, he really didn’t mean to hiss like that as he playfully licked at Tony’s cheek making the other blush as he was opening the door to their apartment. He had been waiting for the short brunette to come home since the time he hd left. He wanted to show Tony just how much he had missed him. How much he wanted to be with him, like Nat was with Clint. Seeing the two being so close and intimate had made him wonder what it would be like to have Tony pressed against him on their bed. The two of them panting and moaning as they’d ravish each other senseless like what Bucky and Nat were doing as well. Clint had been very gentle with the redhead hybrid. Giving her loving praises and tender touches but When Bucky had mounted on her he was everything but gentle. Steve gaped with a bright blush as ha watched Bucky press and squeeze against her, Thrusting in her brutally as she gripped and moaned at the sheets. Clint was a bit upset as he glanced at his trashed apartment while Sharon was busy tending to beaten up Sam.
“Who wouldn’t be...waiting till ten for your ass to come home..didn’t even give me a heads up what time you’d be home..” Tony answered bitterly as he walked downstairs. Steve frowned at that as he followed the brunette. “Shoot...I’m sorry...my phone died...i-i’m an ass...i was just..i-“ Steve tried to explain before Tony cut him off “you were drunk...” the brunette said in a dull tone as he sat on the kitchen table and started munching on some bread. “Y-yeah...I didn’t even remember getting home..crap im sorry Tony...it’ll never happen again, I promise..” Steve said with a grimace as he leaned down next to Tony. The brunette raised an eyebrow at him. “You don’t remember anything after getting home?” Steve frowned at that as he bit his lips. “I remember Peggy helping me walk across the front yard...and kis-“ blue eyes widen for a moment before glancing at the other. “i mean i remember thanking Peggy...ugh...w-were you with us when we got into the living room? Everything was just so blurry and-“ Steve started to ramble but was cut off again as Tony right away answered him that he went upstairs right away. Too tired to actually care what was happening. That had seemed to ease the blond’s expression. ‘He doesn’t remember that i was there...it’s better’.
“So…um…you got a really nice room..love the colour…”  Tony started since he really wanted to keep his mind off of Steve’s body. The grin the blond had given him from that was enough to make his heartbeat stop. “ thanks…i painted it myself…” Steve laughed as he jumped on his bed. “Light blue…huh..” Tony smirked a bit as it suited the other teen well with his eyes. “It’s my favorite colour. And it’s not just any shade of light blue. This is the shade of the ocean…calming and peaceful..” Steve trailed as he placed his arms behind his head. Glancing at his side when he realized the other teen was setting beside him. Without thinking he blurted out “ i really wanna cuddling you right now…” blue eyes instantly widen when Tony had snapped at that. Panic started to fill th blond as he tried to apologize for saying that. “ i didnt think we’d be learning today…but okay…might as well” Tony smiled as he crawled towards the stunned jock.
And so they always cuddled close to each other whenever a thunderstorm was scaring them. They always held hands as they ran through the park with their parents smiling brightly at them. And they always took their baths together even when they had hit puberty. But that was all they did..they had never went further than holding each other tight and pressing next to each other as close as they could..all of that changed though the moment they had heard the news that their parents had died in a plane crash. Tony had broke down in tears as he felt his heart ache from the pain, lungs heaving fast as he tried to breath. His whole world had fell that night, Steve had held him tighter than ever before, had kissed him on his head as he tried to calm Tony down. tears also trailing down his cheeks as he did. And then that’s when Tony felt him. felt his lips pressed gently against Tonys. And for some strange unknown reason Tony had melted into the soft kiss. He had went limp immediately inside his brother’s arms. Heart still tight but now he felt safe. He felt Steve, his brother..that was still alive and still with him. With sheer desperation he clung onto the blond like his life depended on it. And he guess it did at that moment on, Steve was all he had left at that point. and the blond had swore he would never let go.
Loki nodded in return. “I had hoped to give her perhaps a life here..not a good one but still a life..I didn’t know...” Loki stopped to bite his lip. “ she never answered whenever i asked her where she was from...knowing now, I understand why..” he   Stopped to give a smile. “After just escaping from a burning kingdom with your friend being kidnapped and forced to marry a mad king..I’d stay quiet too” Loki said with a charming smile. Tony smiled back at him. He could tell Loki was a good man. He only wished Loki had told Pepper before hand where exactly they were headed for her to be at least prepared.
A vain was about to pop on the blond omega’s head as he scowled at an alpha who had suddenly blocked his view of Tony who was waiting for him at the bleachers. Tony hadn’t seen him yet and Steve had wanted to surprise him with a kiss when an over self-confident alpha had suddenly appeared right in front of him. The blond omega immediately scowled at the obnoxious looking alpha. Steve really didn’t have time to explain to the knot-head that he wasn’t interested. Especially since Steve knew the Alpha could smell Tony’s scent on him. “Your in my way...MOVE! Now!” he barked as the Alpha stupidly replied a ‘aw com’ on sugar...you know i can show you a better time than that alpha you go-arck!” The alpha couldn’t even finish his sentence as Steve had knocked his windpipes out of him.
“Steve...” Tony said softly as he looked up at the blond, “ yes my love? “ Steve asked as he nudged his nose on Tony’s forehead. “Where is Pepper?...” Tony asked in a small whisper. The name instantly forming a sharp frown on the king’s face “ why would you ask about her where about? My sweetness?” The blond asked as his face began to harden, It was ‘their’ ceremony night and Tony was still thinking about the damn ginger. “Tony nuzzled his face closer to Steve’s “ i was only wandering...everyone else is here celebrating with us, even the palace cooks, servants and peasants have come to the feast to eat...yet...i have no one from my old kingdom to celebrate with me...” he managed to say. Steve paused at that for a bit, staring straight into Tony’s eyes thinking it over. Suddenly Steve’s face softened into that of understanding as he snapped his fingers above them for his men to bring the prisoner.
He quickly went out as he closed the bedroom door and stood behind it. Just maybe he could get to do that with Tony once he got back. He would really like to, he would really love too..And if he knew Tony would love it too. With a wide smile Steve was forming a plan.
Steve watched with sad eyes as he watched Tony beam while he started asking question after question about the other blond. Eyes sparkling with glee as Thor excitedly shared his luxurious stories with the engineer. Steve never had 6 doctors taking care of him when he was ill, he had never went to Paris or Korea to have photo shoots and star in T.V commercials for hybrid vitamins when he was a tiny kitten hybrid. And he didn’t get gawked at for having royal hybrid blood in his veins...no he didn’t have all that.
Once they had arrived at the front of the brunette’s house, Steve had hesitantly let go of the smaller teens hand. “Um...thank you for the date...even though i really didn’t see what the point of that was..i mean we just ate...”  Tony said as he scratched his head a bit. Steve huffed at that, looking offended. “The point of that date was me getting valuable informations from you for our next dates...” Tony stared at him a bit at that since he really didn’t think knowing his favorite color was really valuable information. But instead he blurted out “next date?...y-you mean we have to go on more dates?” He asked with wide eyes. Steve nodded as he stared seriously at him. “Of course, you didn’t think one date was enough to get you prepared for the real thing did you? From what i could tell you never had a date in your entire life...you wouldn’t want to bore Bucky to death with you just eating and glancing around uncomfortably would you?” Steve stated as he cocked a brow at Tony who shook his head frantically at him. “No!...oh my gosh was i that bad?” He asked as he placed both his hands over his face. “No...and don’t worry...tomorrow we’ll have our second date..” Steve said as he placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, making the shorter teen look up from under his hands. “Tomorrow’s Saturday...” He asked from under his lashes. Steve smirked at that as he nodded. “That’s why tomorrow we go to the park...have a nice picnic...and get to know each other mo-i mean I’ll give you some information on Bu-Bucky...” Steve stuttered as he quickly took his hand back and placed it inside his pocket.
Tony was squinting his eyes at whoever was in front of him. Winching as he tried to get up while reaching for his missing glasses. Thankfully the guy in front of him was kind enough to help him on his feet before finally handing him his glasses. “Than yo-“ Tony tried to smiled as he awkwardly blinked at the guy when he had finally put on his glasses.
Oh thank God Tony hadn’t thought anything of it. He couldn’t resist the erge to swallow though when the smaller teen had finally laid on top of him. Glasses off as he stared at Steve. Brown eyes big and beautiful. “Tony…” Steve breathed as he unconciously wrapped his arms around the small messy haired brunette. It all felt so right as he held him there. Warm and cozy inside his room. His breath hitched when he felt Tony’s fingers start to trace scribbles on his neck. Before he knew it. He had suddenly pinned the shorter teen against his bed. Kissing him so passionately that he couldn’t even stop what he was doing. The amazing thing was that Tony was kissing him back. Tongue dancing along with his as he bit and sucked at the soft lips. He could feel himself harden as he grinded against the other who was already moaning at his touch. Soft fingers curling on his sides as he slid his own hard finders beneath the other’s shirt. Loving the feeling when he had found one of Tony’s nipples and suddenly pinching it. Earning him a whimper from the brunette.
'Tell her, Rogers, and I'll put the recording on Youtube,' he threatened, trying to regain some ground.
Within quarter of an hour of Mr Stark's arrival on US soil, this publication received an invitation to an urgent press conference. Less than two hours later, Mr Stane announced Mr Stark to a room packed with the hastily assembled media. In many ways, Mr Stark looked unchanged; still impeccably dressed in an Armani suit, his beard and hair neatly groomed and presented. However, having visibly lost weight and with his left arm in a noticeable sling, it was obvious that his ordeal had taken its toll. Nor did Mr Stark present the customary charm we have come to expect from him, forgoing his usual easy-going friendliness in favour of a firm, authoritarian manner as he made his statement without allowing for questions or interruptions until the end.
'Tapioca,' Steve said, reading a poster in the window. His mouth turned down in the corners. 'I hate tapioca. When I was a kid I used to have to go to my neighbour for dinner while mom was working, and that was all she ever made for dessert. She used to make me have seconds, too, I think she knew no-one liked it.'
what to wear. Well, no, there was the Iron Man armour, obviously, and beneath that his flight suit. He always wore his flight suit. He quickly reached a hand under his pyjama shirt to check it was still there, which it was. Good. With that established, he turned his mind back to his clothes.
So justified, Tony clicked the recording and there was Steve's voice; the audio quality crackling and popping, an uncanny reminder of just how far Steve had come. The recording kicked in at the end of a sentence, just as Steve said '-dead'.
'No, sir. Not five more years. When I was born, the doctors told my mother I wouldn't live past five years old.'
Time seemed to stretch. He even started doing press ups and sit ups, trying to burn off some of the feeling of being cooped up. He missed Jarvis, and kept finding himself talking aloud to him before remembering even Jarvis couldn't hear him here.
. Obviously, everyone knew this song, but it was a great song. He hadn't heard it for ages, years, and he suddenly wondered why. It was a classic song. It was calming, and sort of like a river in and of itself. He could so easily let himself drift away on it, back to sleep, but something in him said no.
Now for the music. He scrambled round the bed, grabbing the phone and closing what turned out to be a Youtube playlist. The change in sound level seemed to wake Peter up, and his eyes fluttered open, slowly taking Tony in. He made a small rasping sound that might have been
When he had stepped out the shower, his skin had been turned pink by the heat, but he was starting to realise that wasn't the only reason he'd been hot. Looking in the mirror now, his face was flushed, cheeks pink, and his chest was hot to the touch. Another fever coming on. Great. It always happened when he stayed up too late. Even the back of his neck was warm beneath the blemish.
The bastard knew exactly what he was doing. Tony had been turned on ever since he had heard Steve singing, and now Steve was making his voice all husky and breathy and
When he made his way downstairs for food, Bruce was lounging at the bar, eating a bagel and looking at something on his tablet. No one else was in the kitchen, or sitting on the couches in the connected area. “He asleep?” Bruce said as a way of greeting him.
When he finally works up the nerve to enter the workshop again, he calmly makes sure the Falcon wing designs are backed up on his server, and then destroys the paper copies. Rhodey might have something to say about starting small fires inside, but he’s at physical therapy, and no one else on his dwindling list of friends is around. It would be too easy to sweep the letter into the flames as well, but he pushes it into the drawer with the rest of the other letters. He catches a glimpse of the other unopened envelopes and is almost tempted, but his chest aches and FRIDAY is reminding him that he needs to rest and DUM-E is nudging at his leg with a fire extinguisher.
Rhodey has a laugh when the box is delivered, but Tony doesn’t mind that it's at his expense. It’s been a rough day, trying to work out the kinks in the prosthetics and not think about why they’re being made in the first place. It feels like they’re almost back to normal.
, 2014. It seems to be a collection of interviews of people you have helped through Stark Industries and your work as Iron Man.” Her voice carries across the empty workshop, back into the dark corners of the room. Would you like me to play it for you?”
He must have taken longer than he was expecting, because when he walked into their bedroom, a towel wrapped around his waist, Tony was already asleep on the bed, laying on top of the blankets. The stitches on his face were wrapped in a new layer of gauze, courtesy of Bruce, and his mustache that the hospital had kept when they were treating him had been shaved. Steve had never seen his boyfriend bare-faced before, and now with him asleep, he looked much more what he would have imagined Howard’s son to be, before he had actually met Tony. He leaned in and brushed a kiss across Tony’s forehead, and quickly changed into comfortable clothes.
