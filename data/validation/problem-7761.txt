by Steve.”
Knowing that anything could happen that would change the situation, Tony fell silent when Captain America and the sniper did. The two of them worked perfectly in-sync, communicating silently with hand gestures. Something tickled at the back of Tony’s brain, like his subconscious was noticing details, but didn’t want to share with the rest of the class just yet.
“Your time is almost up,” the social worker said, standing up.
The conversation tapered off afterwards when some students came in, looking haggard and laden down with textbooks, laptops, and essays. Two promptly began arguing about the best way to move forward with a project, while another looked frustrated over what looked to be history or a literature course. The amount of books they had was criminal. For the next half hour or so, no one else came in. Business seemed to be slow, so it made sense that Steve was alone.
God, if someone suggested to Howard that he—
But maybe his charade wasn’t over yet.
“You have artificial intelligence on your phone?” Steve seemed to be in absolute awe. Most people were, but Steve’s reaction seemed to be a little more genuine than other’s.
The movie part of their date explained why Steve wanted this particular evening. A movie theater seemed to have themed nights here and there, kind of copying what Turner Classic Movies occasionally did. The night’s feature was a 1922 silent movie, starring John Barrymore as Sherlock Holmes.
“Big time. You really threw us for a loop, darling.”
“Tony, you need to eat,” Pepper chided.
It was amazing.
want to ask JARVIS. He was sure that the machine would frown at the number of projects he had added onto his impossibly long to-do list and all the coffee he guzzled. Not that it was Steve’s coffee. He hadn’t left the workshop in about three days and yikes. That explained that weird smell.
“Hey, hey, we’re going to talk about this,” Tony said. “All parties. We’re gonna get the whole story, so don’t apologize yet, okay?”
Okay, he wasn’t good at that either.
“Is something wrong?” Steve called, coming out. “Buck, you know you shouldn’t—Tony!”
They had called him something, but—
Natasha reached over and placed her hand on one of Bucky’s, which calmed him down a fraction. It was still better than nothing.
That made Peter’s face light up.
Who was coming to help him gather up said papers.
Steve and Bucky’s eyes were still glued to it from start to finish, and Steve’s breath hitched as if he could feel Luke Skywalker’s pain, but … it wasn’t like the freak out some kids had on YouTube.
“Sir,” JARVIS insisted. “This is a matter I believe deserves your attention. I would not bring it up if I did not believe there was a ninety-eight percent chance of there being credibility to the claim.”
“You just scare easily,” Natasha chuckled, going over to the table with a drink carrier.
Ten Rings was going down in flames.
Tony snickered and decided to let go of the fact that he now informally knew yet another spy. It would likely be a good thing. “Same here.”
He racked his brain for more information, but it looked like the delirium that he was in and out of prevented him from doing basic cognitive functions. God, this was not how today was supposed to go
Tony’s eyes fluttered as he registered JARVIS’s voice.
Bruce’s little green quirk just added another layer to it.
Steve had given him his number and while Tony didn’t have the courage to start texting him yet, he did send Steve a starter message so he could be added to his contacts.
It was something different, watching a silent movie.
Steve sputtered and protested. “N-No! If I’m in a rut, then I—”
“What, no questions?” Tony asked.
He would never forgive the idiot in love with him if he had to get surgery because of this.
Tony nodded.
“It’s one of our tea blends,” The Gift From God said. “Green tea is the base, but there’s chamomile and lavender added to it. We usually put in some honey too.”
Tony felt his ear twitch. Then his other ear.
So, Steve read the texts, tried to make heads or tails of it, gave Tony some suggestions, and laughed when he got a bunch of excited, happy emoji in reply.
“Any moment now, Your Highness,” he whispered.
“Oh,” Steve said, a hint of a blush rising. “Well, glad you approve. Still want a cappuccino, or do you want to try something without caffeine?”
Bucky continued wiping down a nearby table. “Yeah. Steve drew it.”
His eyes adjusting some, he saw the cave for what it was: an enormous cavern filled with columns of stones rising to form the ceiling or disappearing into deep darkness, some coming down to almost meet the ground, and a vast number of other formations he could not describe. Small rivers of water trickled down the stones, dripping and splashing as they went.
Steve smiled like Tony had just made his day and went behind the counter. Tony watched, but didn’t try to figure anything out. It was just a thing of beauty to see Steve move and work.
undo the last two years by saying that there was something wrong with his kid or he was a delinquent or hopeless!
He dropped his pipe and hastily picked it up again.
“Steve!”
“No, I didn’t!” Peter protested. “I tried to get my book back, but Flash held it over my head! I tripped and fell onto him! That’s when he punched me!”
Well, that was odd, Tony thought. He usually thought Steve smelled like oranges and cinnamon. If he wanted to get further into that, he also thought Steve smelled like fresh air and sun-warmed earth, but that those were details only for him and Steve.
A bag was handed to him along with his cappuccino the next day.
“But—”
Scott grumbled. “No, she likes roses.”
Steve smiled as he pulled out another blue petal from his mouth. “My friend Sam likes them.”
at a clock, Tones.”
“They didn’t give you a new name, did they?”
“Sorry,” Steve said, his voice hoarse. “Allergies.”
He wasn’t expecting anyone, so maybe it was a package. Bucky or Natasha could be expecting something, or maybe Sam got off work early and forgot his keys again.
“Geeze, even in dog form you’re the fun police!”
a usual time. It was just that he hoped to catch Steve at that time more often than not, based on that first meeting. Whoever did their scheduling system either believed in complete randomness or really had a thing against them seeing each other again with any regularity.
That was an odd choice of words, if anyone asked Tony.
It was a nice flower, he supposed, with its small white clumps. One website said that it meant ‘inspiration’, but god knows what the context of that would be.
“So, what is this meeting about? I got the note, but it was kind of vague beyond some of the issues Peter has been having his classes.”
She handed it to him in a to-go cup quicker than he had expected.
Tony nodded. “Yes. I do. I’m speaking from experience: don’t let your doubts get in the way of your dreams. Money helps with a lot of things, like rent and food, but having all the money in the world doesn’t always fill certain voids in your heart.”
Natasha flicked her eyes up from her book. “Knowledge is power. Never underestimate even the most random of facts.”
“What the hell is that?” Steve exclaimed.
“Please?” Tony begged.
“This good?” Tony asked, remembering how Steve was still only in a towel. “No hot flashes?”
“I—I’m sorry, I’m lost. The—the gods—” Antonius stammered and swallowed thickly. He didn’t know what the gods had done to him. He wasn’t even sure where he was. Someone with hair and eyes like that were said to have come from lands far away, where only the bravest of traders and travelers dared to go. Peperi was one such people, but she was brought through the slave channels when she was but a young girl. Whatever memories she had or whatever she might have known of her people had long faded. He heard rumors about such people: they were cursed by the gods, terrible warriors that brought plagues and famine to the lands.
“I can’t believe this,” Pepper whispered, shaking her head.
Tony shook his head. “You don’t have to make me soup!”
“Oh, thanks,” he stammered, lifting it up to taste a sip.
He waved back, hoping everything was alright. Hopefully his face didn’t betray how he wished that he was leaving with them.
He and his father did share a lot of similarities: both of them had a lot of energy, fidgeted a lot, could bounce from one topic to another, and had a habit of losing track of time. Aunt Pepper had described to him that his father used to be constantly late and forgot about deadlines, or would go into his workshop and not come out for days. If not for JARVIS and other tools at his disposal, his bad habits would have likely continued to escalate. Sometimes they did that, working on projects together long after Peter was supposed to have gone to bed. They did their best to keep it to weekends, but sometimes they slipped up on a Sunday or Tuesday evening.
The man spoke, but Antonius couldn’t understand the words.
“But you didn’t make things worse,” Tony ended up saying.
Tony wished that he could kiss Steve goodnight too.
“It was great meeting you,” Tony found himself saying.
Well, he probably was. Maybe not. Anxiety attack?
No alpha was waiting outside his door to court him.
“Peter, it was just a book,” Tony said quietly. “It wasn’t worth all this trouble.”
Because if someone made
He closed his eyes and made his face go slack. Seconds ticked by, but no one came over to take the bag off his head. Until they did something, he had to act like he was asleep. It was the only way he was going to gain any real advantage here.
Pepper blinked. “What?”
“I will,” he promised.
At least Peter seemed to be taking the diagnosis better than he was. While Tony’s mind had been swirling with terms like ‘accommodation’ and ‘504 Plan’, Peter nodded along as the professionals discussed what could be done to help and answered all their questions as best he could. He didn’t put up a fuss, only zoned out twice, and fidgeted the whole time.
“Exactly.”
Steve chuckled and hoped a few of the scholarships he had filled out would get accepted. Pepper had spent the last few days helping him go over essays, make sure everything was in order, and even found him a couple of lesser known scholarships for their school. Every penny would help combat against student loan debt that was mounting up for him and Bucky. They still had about a year to go before they got their degrees, but jobs after graduation were not guaranteed.
It turned out that the early 2000s had no idea what ADHD was really like. Especially those little comics that probably took someone five minutes to come up with and post.
How long had the darkness claimed him before he awoke? Had someone ventured into the caves to bring him out to the land of the living again? Was he being punished here and now for defiling the realm of the gods?
Well, damn. There went that idea.
“Hey, Steve! Catch!”
As he left the meeting room, he was already texting JARVIS the necessary information and various emails were going to be waiting in his draft folders by the time he got … uh. Somewhere. Anywhere but where he had to listen to someone drone about numbers and he
“You sure you’re fine, Cap?” Clint asked, crouching in front of him so they were eye-level.
“Tony, I know for a fact that you have a trashy romance novel collection.”
Magic was something he was content with leaving alone.
“Yeah?”
“If we could go for clear this time?”
He nodded.
Something exploded behind them. Captain America used his shield to block most of it.
Tony turned out to be in front of a computer with a number of windows opened up. Some of them were research, another one was scrolling with code, and more were various people talking just as animatedly as Tony was. He was raking a hand through his hair and had a few coffee mugs in front of him. Steve realized suddenly that he was smelling frustration. Interesting. Was that an ability all dogs had? Was that why animals seemed to be more sensitive to emotions?
“I’m surprised you know any.”
The door leading further into the school opened.
(Tony had JARVIS order five of those fidgeting cubes for him. They were safer than the fidget spinners and certainly better than letting him pick at his fingers.)
Then Captain America stood and held out his hand.
Sam was behind the counter this time and didn’t bat an eyelash. “I can make it again for you, if you’d like.”
A week later, a cold front made the whole city chilly. There was frost on the windows, slush in the streets, and fogging breaths everywhere.
Pepper sighed once more, rubbing her temple. “This might take a few weeks. Has anyone contacted Thor to see if he would know about this?”
Steve coughed again, and this time, there were a few sunflower petals. It wasn’t as annoying as it could have been because Clint sneezed some up as well.
“Simple and quick,” Steve replied. “Shot of espresso, whole milk, and some demerara sugar.”
Bucky had teased him about it, capturing the eye of a lord of all things like those silly romance novels that were becoming ever-so popular. Right until Steve confessed that he had no idea that Tony was a lord and it all came to a horrible, embarrassing end. Bucky wanted to find Tony and knock some sense into him, but Steve convinced him it wasn’t worth the trouble. So, Bucky yelled and kicked some sense into him. Except Steve was still stubborn as any farm mule.
No, no. That wasn’t right.
Steve looked pale then, as if he had been in denial.
This latest meeting went smoothly. Everyone chatted, the numbers were all correct, and everyone was optimistic about the contracts that they would sign once their lawyers had one last look over them. It had been a good day, as far as good days at SI could go.
As if he could sense their apprehension, Mr. Rogers turned back to Peter.
Alpha Night was supposed to be about equality and a ton of other feel good adjectives, but with results like that? It was just plain demeaning.
“Dad!”
“Stark! Come on! Do you know how often squirrels get in here? It’s a legitimate security—oh my god that got cold fast!”
“Okay,” she said calmly. “Want me to bring in Rhodey?”
“Is this all our lives right now, you mean?” Steve asked.
He yelped and spun around. The guard that was left with him looked furious, but he didn’t have his weapon drawn.
“If you would come into my office?” the principal asked, opening a door.
“Natasha will find something on you, and if she doesn’t join me, then Bucky will for the laughs.”
He evoked all the names of the gods who might have pity. He prayed and prayed.
It was a typical book about courtship, but
“Shh!” Steve hushed automatically.
“When did you lose your heating?” Clint asked, already seated on the couch and watching one cartoon program or another.
This was his
Steve followed him through the city manor home that belonged to Sir Anthony Stark, the something odd Lord of one Place or other. He was obscenely rich, had connections with every other rich person in the kingdom, and probably abroad as well. No one could quite calculate his worth, but oh, was there plenty of gossip about parties, balls, drinking, and some crazier ideas that didn’t seem to fit: inventions, a falling out with his father, something in Italy—
The commotion brought out Steve from the back, who was covered in flour and wiping his hands. Tony briefly wondered if kneading dough gave him those muscles or if he spent his time at the gym when he wasn’t making the best cappuccino in the world.
And there he was. Thinking about Tony again.
It was a trying Wednesday morning ten years ago when he got the news, or well, when JARVIS brought a public file to his attention. He had a migraine going on three hours, there were board meetings he had to attend, mountains of paperwork, and Pepper was ready to kill him. He didn’t blame her. While she was happy for his change of heart, she was not happy with all of the drama that his changes were causing. It was about time he promoted her, so she could shove whatever fancy shoes she was wearing into someone’s eye and have the authority to do so.
stop him.
“How did you know?” Thor asked with delight.
“I’m not sure if anything will happen. All of my attempts have gone wrong so far. All those pies I made? Not one made it to him. He thought the love letters I wrote were fiction. Plus, he might not even be interested. He would have caught on by now, right?”
“Underappreciated and valuable resources that deal with very prejudiced and misogynistic stereotypes,” Steve interrupted.
“Dude, let’s get you some water,” Ned said gently. “Mrs. Elison told me to come check on you.”
Just as he was about to fall down and not rise once more, the tunnel suddenly … changed. The walls were suddenly made of large slabs of stones, arranged so they made walls. Smaller rocks filled in gaps in between them and many were decorated with spirals, circles, and other patterns. Above him was a ceiling made of stones placed in a circular pattern, gradually getting smaller until a final stone capped it all off. The air was cool, but everything was dryer.
Wow, when Pepper found out, she was going to skin him alive.
“Eew. You two are so gross. I pity you.”
“I don’t know. Some people say he’s a vigilante, some crazy person that needs to be stopped before his collateral damage includes human lives and situations in some of these war-torn areas get worse. Other people say he’s a hero and deserves awards.”
Tony frowned. What?
“So, what are you going to do?”
“I would like to apologize for my son’s behaviors,” Mr. Thompson said as they made to part ways. “I know he can be brash and spoiled, but I was not aware his behaviors had gotten to these levels. We will be seeing that counselor and changing how we do things at home.”
by Brian Arthur Phythian), I went, “Wait. I said that phrase today. They sure it came from way back then?”
, not incidents you caused by making poor decisions! If you actually brought any of this to them, they would tell you to settle, because who in their right mind would sue a teacher for actually
Sue him if he dreamed of the two of them kissing and whispering sweet nothings to each other more than he should be allowed. An omega was allowed to dream.
Tony looked up from his tablet. Steve had fallen asleep on his shoulder during a movie. His coughing had abated for a while, thankfully, but Tony was still worried and only left his side to take care of his own flower related problems. Steve would never admit it, but coughing up flowers and leaves took a lot more out of him than it would the average person.
“Well, as long as she learned her lesson,” Steve said, hesitantly. Given how Alice was pouting with crossed arms, she probably had not. Hopefully, the family would keep any magic textbooks or items locked up from her for more than a week. And hopefully their brother was back to normal too.
He couldn’t say the same for others. Some of his coworkers had been complaining about the cold and the future storms all day, along with the usual complaints of overdue books and people who forgot that they had books placed on hold. At least the library was warm inside.
The little girl gasped, clutching her to-go mug with star-struck eyes. “You like hot chocolate, Mr. Stark?”
“Only because of technicalities.”
Shem’el had spoken against a corrupt chieftain in his homeland, which was south of the Land of the Riverbank across the Great Sea as Antonius first suspected. He had been thrown into a jail chamber and tortured for weeks, but he refused to retract his accusations. Every night, he prayed to the gods for justice and freedom for his people, but they remained silent. Just as he was about thrown onto a pyre to be burned alive, his gods gave him a pair of ruby wings to carry him away. He flew and flew, until he arrived on this island as well.
“You did not.”
“You sure?”
With everyone around him grumbling, and an old woman giving the man a glare, the guy started to look a bit pale.
“I—I think we need a Plan B,” Tony said.
Antonius remembered there being water. It dripped from somewhere up high. The ground beneath his feet rose and fell. Sand and rough grit stuck to his legs and arms. Large rocks broke up the sandy ground, causing him to stumble. He scraped his knees and palms. His temple bled from a thrown rock. His lungs burned with cold.
“Now, while I am still in awe of how badass MJ is, that girl is going to take over the world and Pepper will be cheering her on,” Tony said as he pulled out of the drive way. “I have no idea what you are talking about.”
“If you kept this up for another week, I would have flown my mother in,” Sam added.
“And where are you seated in your science class?”
Steve fixed him with a look. “Tony, you ranted at me about how a burger needed various components, one of them being lettuce, for twenty minutes. You would never change your burger order. Besides, you always hold out the one that’s meant for me.”
. In that second, he knew that she was up to no good. Whatever she had found or figured out, he was done for.
Sam nodded and drank some of his soda. “You’re being really careful this time.”
“Are you okay?”
He was that Shakespeare quote—little, but fierce. He was a tempest in a teacup, ready to thrown down verbal smack down as quickly as he was to put up his fists. Often times, he did both.
. He had weird quirks and habits, was not the best at communicating at times, he could be such a snarky little shit, and … and yeah. He was dating Steve Rogers.
“This is a load of—” a man wearing sunglasses indoor began, before a sharp look from their professor cut him off. He remained silent until she continued to lecture them. “—BS.”
Thor laughed loudly and sat down, a drink already in hand. “I do not see why she complained. It was a challenge for Jane. Not everyone has the same skills.”
Tony could hardly wait until he got out the door before he tore off a piece of the croissant. It was flaky, buttery, and there was a crunch when he first bit in, before getting to the billowy, soft layers. He had some crumbs all over his beard and shirt now, but it wasn’t like he was losing the entire thing to the ground. These were fresh with no time to soften because of refrigeration. He chased the croissant down with his cappuccino and yeah, he was in heaven.
“JARVIS monitors all my internet activity!”
Or didn’t make sense because they used more French terms than anything else.
“But it was the one
“And what’s that? It’s a form of meditation? Spiritual practice?”
Steve kept Tony in the loop, gave him regular updates about how Peter was doing in is class, and helped Tony figure out all of the information Tony was getting from all of the other teachers. He answered questions about IEP plans and if Peter would need a 504 plan. JARVIS filtered all of Steve’s messages at the highest priority and any phone calls never went to voice mail.
“What are these?” Tony asked.
“Apparently, it means ‘endurance’ so you kind of did!”
He had never met anyone like them before. He had never met someone like Stiofán before.
“But, no,” Steve said. “I’m not looking for a publisher. I have to work out some other things.”
Reports came in. Everyone speculated.
“72nd floor?” Captain America guessed.
“And now, we will take our leave,” Stephen said, guiding the two girls through one of his portals. “A little girl needs to be grounded.”
“Oh, okay,” Ned said, looking a little uncomfortable. Peter knew it was because he didn’t know what to say, not because he actually minded.
It happened. Genetics and nature sucked.
Or listening to him babble about history for a few hours.
he found in the bogs were harder to manipulate for something decorative, but he was proud of the results anyways.
“Tony? Can you hear me?”
“You got this?” was all she asked.
And there was something in the way that Tony spoke and moved that seemed like he was putting on some kind of front. Like he was disappointed.
“I never said it was a bad thing,” Tony said, giggling a little still. “I like it.”
The lunch turned out to be just what Tony needed: a good old fashioned break with good food and even better company. They avoided talking shop as much as possible, but they were in the library breakroom. Fellow librarians occasionally came in and out, taking their own breaks, and muttering about late fees, damaged books, and politics.
Even with all of this happening, Tony kept one eye and ear glued to the news.
Tony looked up at the small television Steve had on the counter. It was old and still black-and-white, but Steve had apparently found it at a thrift shop and knew just enough to fix it up. Tony secretly tuned it up a bit more, but had a feeling Steve still knew.
“Where did you get an idea like that?” Tony asked as Peter started laughing.
Pepper sighed, looking up to the sky in despair.
For the last few visits, he hadn’t seen Steve at all. He was beginning to wonder if this was a once-in-a-blue moon sort of deal, but since he started coming here about a month ago, the rest of the coffee shop crew was starting to grow on him.
“Both of you were frozen,” Tony marveled.
“Hope you can get to it on time,” Steve said as Tony climbed in.
“Tony?” Pepper asked, coming into the workshop.
“You scared me,” Steve said quietly, reaching up and stroking Tony’s hair.
He jumped, his heart in his throat.
“We’re on the 64th floor,” the sniper said. “Think you can outrun them?”
“Yeah. He’s not the only one with a complex like that. I don’t know if it’s worse than what I did as a kid, but I can’t exactly promote violence.”
Natasha flicked his forehead. His very
“So, why are you looking for me?” Steve asked. “Did I forget something at your place? I’ve been missing a watercolor palette and it’s not in the art room.”
“Thank you,” Steve said. “I don’t want you to get burned again.”
Steve could feel his own face heat up.
He still couldn’t figure out why he didn’t see one or two of them for days at a time.
“Good to see you again,” Fury said, extending his hand as Steve climbed down from his horse.
Tony read over the file, feeling like a rug had been pulled out from under him.
“Good morning,” Natasha said, coming through the back door and scaring the living daylights out of him.
Tony noticed his leg was bouncing up and down. His heart was racing. Where was this teacher getting at? Where was all of this going? His mind was going a mile a minute with different possibilities, but mostly with memories of when he was in school. Teaching was a lot different back then. So many classes were focused on rote memorization and drilling facts into students’ heads, not to mention the rising demand for accountability and better test results.
building the coffee shop a sentient toaster. They don’t even use a toaster that much.”
Just as he was about to give up—
While Principal Fury only stared at him blankly and asked if his ‘criminal record’ was going to be a continued habit, Steve was careful not to get arrested anymore and to stay off of certain social media websites and forums, just in case. He got the itch to tell someone exactly why their ‘opinions’ were harmful for others and they were in the wrong with proper citations of various laws and easily verified historical incidents and court rulings a little too often. Because why add more hot-headed ranting when you could shut someone down with evidence and facts?
Tony nodded. “Okay. Thanks for confirming that for me.”
asked him about slang and accents! What did he expect?
“Okay. Fine. But I only do this under duress.”
The man came back and handed Steve a cool, damp cloth. He was cleaned up a lot more, but missed a smudge of something right by his cheekbone.
“Well, I never got
“And? I meant every word!”
Pepper laughed, delighted and bright. “I’d better!”
Tony hummed and drank his coffee.
“Okay, okay. I still use floppy disks.”
“Still, I’m sorry,” Tony said. “I know I imposed on you all, whether or not I knew what I was doing. I should have been more aware of my cycles, or had the mind to call a doctor instead of just knocking on your door.”
That made Tony’s heart skip a beat.
“Oh,” Captain America said, understanding.
He had plenty of material, but he might save … certain poems for later.
“Whoa! You’re lucky you took the right one!” Tony exclaimed. “What if I didn’t want lettuce on my burger this time?”
“Uh, sure,” Tony said. His heart was going a mile a minute. He was so glad he designed a better arc reactor. His old one would have never stood up to this amount of stress.
The emails in front of him were damning evidence, but not enough.
Steve slapped his hand over Tony’s mouth and made a disgusted noise when Tony licked his palm.
Not ten seconds after they got there, even with a perimeter check by the sniper, there was more gunfire. Glass shattered and crashed. Antennae smoked and crackled where they were hit. Captain America got the heaviest fire, hardly able to do more than shield them. Someone jumped Tony from behind, wrapping their thick arm around his neck. He gasped, struggling, as the sniper had to leap into the worst of the fire and take out the shooters.
The HYDRA agent did not look amused. “We have plenty of money,” the agent said. “We need something else from you.”
“Before we begin, I would like to state that I want to stick to the facts and see if we can find a resolution, rather than dish out punishments.”
going to complain!”
Captain America came over to him and wrapped a shock blanket around his shoulders.
God, if it
He held up a finger. “Nope. You’re going to get an email from me. So will some other key people throughout the company. Act accordingly.”
Clint gasped and covered his mouth. “How dare you! My dental hygiene is excellent!”
“Yeah, I do. Everything you, Rhodey, Happy, and Bruce do for me—I can’t begin to repay you. I know I haven’t been the best … friend, boss, person … I stumble and fall more than anything else. So, thank you is gonna have to be a start.”
Someone behind them coughed. “Look, I like a good romance movie and all myself, but there’s a bit of a line and I’m sure some people are less patient than I.”
It was the least he could do. Maybe do some research into adult ADHD as well, if that was a thing. Was it a thing? Did ADHD get better over time? Was it only management of symptoms like other disorders out there? Should he research mental illnesses in general? What if Peter had something like depression or anxiety along with ADHD? Was that a possibility?
Steve was allergic to a lot.
“Much better.”
“Can you come in?”
“Stevie.”
“Shut it, Clint,” Natasha said.
“He did,” he said, having a feeling he knew why Peter suddenly ditched them. “The kiddo likes to keep me on my toes. But speaking of which, how has he been doing?”
It would be worth it, though. If Peter got the help he needed, if he was able to learn skills and get tools to help him succeed in school and manage other areas of his life better, if it would help him adjust so he smiled more and worried less about lost headphones or incomplete assignments, Tony would sit in a hundred boring meetings back-to-back. He would go to hell for his kid.
Scientists said that ‘Hanahaki Disease’ was not meant to injure or kill. It was selective with its victims after all. No one who held platonic or familial love for someone else suffered from it, for example. One theory said that it was supposed to encourage people to be open with their feelings and be more emotionally mature. Someone else claimed that it was a curse from a divine being all of humanity had to suffer due to one single person’s selfish behavior.
“Tony, are you multitasking again?”
He remembered Natasha standing up for him once, telling everyone to give him a break, he was still only in his twenties. Of course he would screw up a little more often, on account of his frontal lobe not being fully developed yet.
Tony was thankful that all the flowers, so far, were small or came up easily. It wasn’t horrible, yet. More like a terrible case of allergies.
“I—I don’t know.”
“Do you think it will help?” Peter asked after a long minute. “Him getting into trouble like this?”
“I’ll have JARVIS run some … algorithms or something,” he said when it was all done.
“I don’t know how that is possible,” Steve muttered. “This sucks.”
people see the Reveal?
could create—
“Yeah. These things take time. He’s been responding well to the changes we’ve made in his classes. It’s amazing how much an impact something like a different seating chart can have. I expect his grades to be much higher by the end of the nine weeks.”
“None of that either! I happen to like your broad shoulders! And our height difference! If you ever decide to pick me up and fuck me against a wall, believe me, I am
“T’Challa!” everyone cheered.
Sure, going to some of these areas and scaring off the terrorists and soldiers from their villages so their actual governments could come in and more easily support them helped, but finding out the head of the snake, now
Steve brushed them out of his hair and clothes, glaring at them. “Ha, ha. Very funny.”
he was giving Captain America an unamused look. “They’re only bodies if they never wake up. Agent Coulson is going to have a lot of people to interrogate when we’re done here.”
“Traitor!”
How long had it been since someone treated him so?
“Awesome. You can date Stark after Peter’s no longer your student.”
Steve kissed him. Sure, it was brief, but …
“What about back pay?” Tony asked, tilting his head curiously, thinking about how picky people must be if Steve couldn’t find a customer for his work. Someone was bound to like that vintage stuff or needed someone to help restore and maintain it. “You know the military have tuition programs set up, right? Free rides or at least some scholarships available. Hell, they might even give you a free ride for everything you’ve done.”
Pepper put her phone away when they entered and looked around. She hid it rather well, but he could tell that she was surprised. It was hardly a Starbucks. But then, a little smile came over her face and he saw the tension in her shoulders ease just a little bit.
“Looks like you found our discussion board,” Mr. Rogers said. Tony jumped and spun around to see Mr. Rogers looking at him sheepishly. “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you.”
He rolled his eyes and swatted her hand away.
It took almost an entire year, an
Tony just nodded.
“Had to work up some courage?” Tony supplied.
The principal looked over to Mr. Thompson, who had an unreadable expression on his face.
But, this was Steve.
She gave him a smug smile.
“We can still at least get to an exit. Whatever intel you have would be great.”
“It’s not like fine art doesn’t have a role in society,” Tony said. “I mean, I don’t get a lot of it, but there’s whole sections for it in bookstores for a reason, right? Some theory about humans and a need to create or express themselves?”
The man laughed and shrugged. “I always miss something. Don’t worry about it.”
It was like sending up a thousand emergency flares.
“By some unholy sacrifice or Pepper being that amazing, I am sure. But what about Natasha?” Bucky asked, grinning.
The room they were in was a study room or something of the courthouse. Multipurpose, filled with old chairs and a table meant to stand up to years of abuse. Kind of musty.
Protesting against injustices? Controversial, but still a noble thing to do.
Peter looked absolutely flushed and out of breath by the time he was done with his short speech.
“To—”
He personally created the alloy and redesigned the joints from scratch, pioneering the nerve ending calibrations. He also worked on the skin sleeves, so they were more resistant to wear and tear, but didn’t interfere with those improved nerve calibrations.
“Who made you feel like that?” Tony asked, his voice soft.
Tony shook his head, grinning. “Consider me a desperate university student.”
He enjoyed sex. Sex was awesome. He completely understood the appeal of sex in all its varieties and forms, but it only meant something to him when the person he was with meant something to him. Otherwise, it was just another way to please someone, bearing some hard lines like being a homewrecker or having sex when he really wasn’t in the mood or couldn’t properly consent, like when he had a few too many drinks. In a way, sex was kind of like gifts or money: enjoyable, sometimes needed, but ultimately, there were more important things.
Relativity sucked.
“Okay! Okay! But I demand to be read my rights! You can’t just kidnap someone and force them to do something for you. That’s just in the movies.”
The arrow proved to be useful a week later when a boar came rampaging through the fields.
“Liar!”
One morning, he nearly had a heart attack.
“What about Sam and Natasha?”
About two hours later, Doctor Steven Strange was humming at Tony, hand to his chin, and confirming that he could not merely snap his fingers.
“No, it’s not,” Sam said as he made someone’s coffee. “It’s miserable.”
“That is how people perceive them now, because we’ve gotten used to people needing glasses. It would be wrong to ignore that you are nearsighted because it will cause long-term problems for you, like being unable to read small print. Having ADHD isn’t wrong either, but ignoring that you have it is wrong because it will hurt you in the long-run. Eventually, as people learn more about these conditions, they’ll be seen as normal too.”
“That’s how she shows love.”
“Target acquired?” came the garbled voice.
“Uh-huh.”
His joints were starting to wake up, which meant that they were protesting very loudly at the abuse he had put them through, and the same went for his eyes and neck. However long he had been working had done a number on him, which meant he likely needed to apologize to Pepper (again), Bruce and Rhodey for a million different things, and catch up on work that had fallen by the wayside. That would be another work binge in and of itself, but …
It was not like they got along right away.
Steve barked out a laugh. “Sure. Tony you don’t—”
Some people were correct in assuming that he couldn’t ever reach the levels his father’s obsession went. Those people had no idea how right they were. When it came to Captain America, Howard not only collected and held onto everything he could find—including anything that might have belonged to Steve Rogers—but he kept tabs on everything too.
The coffee was good. It wasn’t as bitter as a cappuccino, cut with milk, but it didn’t have any foam like a cappuccino. It was sweeter than a latte, but … the flavor was different than if he had added sugar or simple syrup. Huh. He didn’t see him go for any of the flavorings. Tony took another drink, chasing the flavors, trying to figure out what it was.
Steve was starting to blush, wringing a rag in his hands. “You always come in early, around eight thirty, not long after the morning rush. The afternoons are more random, but I didn’t see you at all this week.”
“Yeah.”
“Stop moonin’ over him! Ask him out!” Bucky yelled from behind the door.
This wasn’t designing something for SI. This wasn’t something to keep his mind off his trauma and other worries. This wasn’t an excuse to blow off another board meeting or convince the military and hundreds of others that yes, SI was truly pulling out of the weapons business.
, they were full of trickery and evil.
“It was great working with you, Mr. Stark.”
environment where kids would be safe and accepted and have some actual stability and support, no matter how they were different?
The flowers were clues, hints.
“That’s alright,” Tony assured him, rubbing his back. “You can always decide later.”
“Maybe get inside his head a little?”
This place was nothing like the country estate where he originally met Tony—back when he thought Tony was another member of the working class like him. Back when he thought they were on equal grounds and didn’t have things like social class in between them. Bitterly, he thought of how the country estate at least had more room to move around and larger windows to allow in sunlight and fresh air with views of the gardens and forests surrounding the house.
“You don’t eat what you make,” Natasha said with the most serious face he had ever seen her don. “That is for fools and idiots, of which I am neither.”
Really, this had to stop happening to him. It was getting ridiculous.
“You are currently in your bed, sixty centimeters from the end, thirty centimeters from the left edge,” JARVIS replied. “You appear to be approximately seventeen centimeters long.”
Peter darted off for the car, a mischievous glint in his eye.
Tony nodded, wrapped up like a burrito in a thick blanket. “Yeah. Tomorrow I’ll be fine and feeling like I can take on the world and have a sex marathon. It’s just that the wind is knocked out of my sails for the first day as punishment.” His eyes suddenly widened. “Oh my god, that was TMI, wasn’t it? I ramble. I’m delirious. End me now.”
The man was clueless.
Since they were kids, Bucky was used to taking care of Steve and standing up for him. Not that Steve didn’t do that for himself already, but the two of them had a brotherly bond that went beyond sub-genders and what society said alpha-omega relationships should be like. They, as they said, were with each other until the end of the line. For Steve to push Bucky away when he was trying to help must have smarted.
“Those little! I swear, gremlins! All of them!”
Tony nodded in agreement and enjoyed his muffin. It took some talking afterwards (and a lot of kisses he was happy to give and receive), but they concluded that okay, they had some emotional hang-ups they needed to work through, but it was better if they worked through them together, and the short-lived Hanahaki case was completely unneeded.
“Uh.”
“You don’t see the tennis ball he’s hiding behind his back.”
He did not know what they meant, but at the moment, he did not care. He had found a new home. He had found people he loved and who loved him in return.
Steve looked over to him. That was his guilty face. “Nothing?”
“No,” Steve moaned. “I feel like—”
Bucky gave him a relieved smile. “It’s alright. Nothing personal, right?”
If something happened—
“Yeah. I think I do.”
But what took his breath away was the wall before him: from the bottom to almost the top and spanning the whole length of the wall, hands were scattered, outlined in reds, blacks, and whites. They were of different sizes, some overlapping, and some were more faded than others. The people who made this obviously sprayed the paint somehow, but why—
“Oh, hey, there’s MJ and Ned!” Peter suddenly said, dashing off. “Bye!”
“Yes, I am,” Tony sighed, munching on some nuts. Wasabi this time.
He also saw that Steve had a mole on one cheek, right near the center of it, but on the other side, another mole was closer to his jaw. There were some more on his neck, following the lines of his throat. God, Tony wanted to—
“Just—just help me,” he begged.
“Peter?”
Then Tony sent him a message about how Anish Kapoor didn’t deserve to be called an artist for his elitist views and should he send some money to this other guy who was making pigments for free in protest?
“Oh, the older ones,” Tony added, grinning. “Maybe Jet Li too.”
decent human being should do,
Steve looked up to Bruce. “He’s just being annoying. Nothing unusual.”
It still cast a blue light in the darkness.
Of the few people Tony absolutely trusted with every fiber of his being, Bruce had to be the one he connected to with the most. He adored Rhodey; there was no doubt about that. He adored Pepper just as much. How or why those two stuck with him through bad decisions, drunken parties, his years at MIT, or the horror that was the desert, he had no idea. He would never, ever underappreciate them or be ungrateful for their loyalty and friendship.
Steve shook his head, his hands trembling a bit as he used a paperclip to keep the papers that needed corrections together. JARVIS was sending him emails as needed so they could be sorted electronically, but Tony had a feeling Steve would want to keep the originals and make physical copies of the corrected versions. Pepper would be so proud of that forethought.
In a moment of unattached shock, he realized that one of the folders he had also grabbed that morning included the love letters he had written to Tony.
Tony opened the door and led the way in.
Ned smiled. “That’s good. I hated seeing you so twitchy and not knowing how to help.”
Anxiety and suspicion clawed into Tony’s chest, cold and razor sharp. He struggled to keep it down, but ultimately, he couldn’t help but question everything he’d known upto this point. Were Steve and his friends planted as undercover agents? Were Sam and Natasha aware of what was going on? Did they open that shop so close to SI specifically to lure him in? What did Agent Coulson and the rest of SHIELD really want from him? Did they know about HYDRA resurfacing and planning to kidnap him? How deep and how far did their intel go?
“Well, this has been absolutely horrendous, so I’m just gonna leave.”
And how old he sometimes felt too.
Steve balked. “I never courted anyone before! And I—I wasn’t courting you then!”
“Hey, welcome home,” Bucky called, not looking up from some website or another.
What good were the counselors and paraprofessionals and administrators and detention officers or hell,
“Uh … yes. More or less. There are gonna be some problems down the road, but …”
Tony sighed, both aloud and mentally. He had been hinting at Alpha Night for
But instead of warning their people or going to fight against this empire before it could rise up, the oracle sent them on a mission: to find Antonius. After that, the oracle decreed, their fates would be up to themselves, for they would have left the realms of their gods.
Hopefully it wouldn’t take them this long to cool down after a fight. God, he wasted so much time being bitter and just as narrow-minded as the lord and ladies who stared at him when he initially knocked on the front door not even fifteen minutes ago.
“A movie?”
“At least Cassie doesn’t like peanut flowers. That would be horrible, wouldn’t it?”
He did not think this through at all, but that letter …
“Who do?” Natasha asked, morphing her expression into total confusion.
His mind whirled. He couldn’t even focus on anything beyond that fact, even as Tony started to ramble.
too. In one chapter, there was an illustration of an omega presenting a covered dish to an alpha. The omega was holding the dish up, a knee bent, and the alpha was standing in their doorway, a few steps above the omega. Suggested,
That night, while everyone else slept, Antonius risked the danger of darkness to find stones that would be suitable for making arrowheads. The work was difficult. He had only the dimming fire to work by, which he made sure to keep fed so everyone else could continue to sleep. The stones were harder than he expected and he had to work quietly, but he was determined.
Heading down the elevator, he looked through his emails and text messages, sending off replies when and where he could. Some of them were quick fixes, others needed to be forwarded to someone else, and too many were more that were better taken care of in front of a computer. There were plenty of places he could dive into for a sandwich and be back into the office within ten minutes. Who needed a full hour for lunch?
As he realized the other world-wide implications of this horrible bit of history still existing, he concluded that needed to come up with a much, much better plan than ‘find a weapon’ and ‘get to an elevator’. There was no guarantee that he wouldn’t come across some agents determined to kill him along the way, but he would cross those bridges when he got to them.
“Alright, out with it.”
The man rolled his eyes, their color proving to be gray-blue, like the stormy ocean not far from the place Antonius used to call his home. What was most striking about him was his left arm: it appeared to be made of solid moonlight, but Antonius could tell it was a metal. It seemed familiar to him, but he was not sure where he had seen it before.
“Hey, kiddo, what happened? Are you okay?”
“Plus, his arms.”
“Research.”
Tony gaped. He didn’t think of that.
Steve glanced down at the papers again, scowling. “It’s a right mess, alright.”
Looking through all of the cracked drywall and fallen ceiling tiles, Tony saw that while things were messy, there was not as much damage as he thought there was. The worst of the damage seemed to be under them, as if HYDRA’s focus was to destroy something else. Maybe there was something in a room on the floor below that they didn’t want anyone to get to.
“Sir,” Coulson said.
She rolled her eyes, but then gave Rhodey a considering look. Not like she wanted to kill him or eat him alive, but more like she was creating a detailed mental dossier on him. “You seem like a caramel macchiato kind of guy.”
A young man suddenly came from around one of the sides of the mound. Despite his panic over how foreign gods might punish him for his transgressions, Antonius found himself fixating on the young man like he was a problem to be solved or one of his tools. With the sunlight against his back, he seemed ethereal. He was thin, but looked sturdy, only about Antonius’ height. His hair was the color of wheat in the middle of summer and his eyes were—
Mr. Rogers smiled. “Yeah. He has a talent for remembering facts.”
and developed the overarching motifs and tropes that defined the whole genre.
Tony dimmed his light. A regiment of soldiers ran past them, swords and other weapons clanging, not one even glancing their way or clearing the hallways like untrained squires.
“And cause myself misery too? No thank you.”
All of these will probably end up in here somehow!
“Sounds like the best plan we’ve got right now,” Tony replied.
Steve held out his hands and let Tony get to work.
Steve gave him a smile that gave him a horrible case of the butterflies.
It was a lovely rendering of a nearby park, people milling about and the trees full of leaves. Nothing was defined or overly exact; the shading was kind of messy, but it gave the scene more dimension that way. Not quite
Even though Peter was a certified genius, he was still sixteen years old and in college with a huge guilt complex. There were times they all wanted to shake him and assure him he could come to them for
Tony hoped his glare was full of the fury his tiny little body contained.
“It’ll be tight,” the sniper said. “Lots of recovery time.”
“Well, exactly what he said.”
“I need to head to work now, it’s a late shift. Tell Bucky to do his dishes in the sink. And don’t do anything that crappy book says.”
“Uh. Sure. Whatever.”
“You were blushing.”
“How about we let him get some rest?” Bruce suggested. “I could go for some tea if anyone would like to join me.”
“Yellowstone,” Steve confirmed, launching into a vivid description about colors and textures.
“I still don’t want—that.”
Sure, it could have been a date night with just him and Steve, but he liked the idea of a get-together with his friends too. There were snacks, drinks, and plenty of pillows and blankets. He completely expected there to be jokes, snarky comments, and popcorn throwing. Sam and Natasha were invited as well. Bucky was expected to be there because he needed to see the movies as well, and what was better than seeing
“Sorry, we’re—Tony!”
Tony placed it down and swiped the screwdriver kit.
Putting the morsel into his mouth was even better than looking or smelling. It was moist, not too sweet, and hardly cloying like some store-bought versions could be. It had to be the brown sugar he could get a hint of and the crunch of the walnuts. Spices melted over his tongue, most notably cinnamon. He couldn’t describe the cake as anything but made with love.
“Steve, look at our lives. It might not repeat, but something is bound to happen.”
Steve leaned over to look at the screen. Tony thumbed through a few of the scans to show some of what JARVIS had highlighted.
His desk, dresser and bedframe were all pushed in front of the closet, which made getting a fresh towel and pajamas almost impossible.
“Yeah, but you got a type.”
“I respectfully disagree,” JARVIS said. “Miss Potts is an excellent source of sound advice and I feel that my knowledge of such matters is insufficient to help you myself.”
Other library patrons gave them both glares. The way one student gripped their pencil, it looked like they were two seconds from murder. Maybe they were. The first round of finals were coming up and tension was already starting to build.
Never mind. He reached a new level just now.
“Carol!”
“How are you a squirrel?”
Since reading some of the earlier comics, I have found out this is actually canon. You can imagine my absolute delight!
Ned walked with him to the water fountain. “Wanna hear about the chemicals? Some of them were so cool!”
He understood that deadlines and profitable projects were what kept his corporate shareholders happy, but sometimes, it felt like he was still pulled into too many directions. SI was a monstrosity that relied on so many different parts fitting together perfectly, but when most of those parts were human beings with concerns beyond their jobs …
, Tony thought.
“No, no,” Tony assured him. “Just bit some heads off worse than when I won our argument about
Steve fiddled with the book that was in his hands. It was about the history of progressive movements for omega rights. It would hopefully prove to be interesting, but he had to admit that he was also looking at a book that was hot pink and decorated with dozens of red hearts. No librarian could judge a book by its cover. They judged them by the reviews, reference list, and whether or not the author had a history of being some kind of idiot.
Tony didn’t think his heart was ever going to stop racing.
“No, it smells like bacon.”
“Uh, Steve Rogers,” he said, taking his hand. “Art student.”
Steve impulsively reached forward and felt his forehead with the back of his hand. He didn’t feel too overheated, but with how he was sweating, he would need to be watched and drink plenty of fluids. He would bet his left hand that Tony had a slight fever. He probably worked too many hours and forgot to eat again, but why was he in this part of town? He should have been heading to the library or his tower, not here.
Steve.
Tony blinked, pausing in his list of professionals to harass for resources and information. “Sure. Today or over the weekend?”
“It’s good to see you too. Have a good day!”
But thinking was what brought him here; it caused so much trouble before.
It wasn’t his fault the classes were boring or his classmates were stupid.
Only Stiofán and his friends lived in the cave, guarding the small village that held the rest of their families in the small valley below them. They made frequent visits to the many huts made of reed and straw there, helping with the communal fields or larger tasks that a single person or family unit could not do alone. The burial mound was a half hour’s walk to the north and the sea laid beyond the village about half a day’s journey away to the east.
going to pry about, was the worst. Steve admitted he went a little AWOL, but didn’t regret it.
. He wasn’t going to die. He wasn’t going to slip away from them in the middle of the night or literally cough up a lung. He was going to be okay.
He might not have known about Peter until he was about ten years old, he might have been considered an ‘irresponsible parent’ and ‘unfit’ to raise a child, but dammit, he proved them wrong! He got custody of him and found his biological aunt and uncle! He made sure to involve them in Peter’s life! He got him into a good school, made sure he had a routine, and he was not going to let some … some …
They were panting by the time they reached the surprised Happy.
“What’ll it be?” Bucky asked, a cup in his hands, ready to go.
“A marriage license.”
But god, was Steve absolutely stubborn and could not take a hint.
“You’re sitting on the tissues.”
. He felt his shoes being taken off, then lying down on something soft and kind of lumpy, and a heavy blanket being spread over him. Two people were having a whispered conversation, but no alarms were going off in his head telling him to get out of there. Everything was warm.
“Let him have his sleep,” Natasha said as Bruce shuffled out. “You know you scientists operate on different schedules than the rest of humanity. He’ll probably have a hundred questions later.”
But, come to think of it, no. Flash had not bothered him too much in this class before. He had no idea why … Maybe it was because the opportunity finally presented itself? Some kids joked that Mrs. Elison had eyes in the back of her head, but it was probably because she had been an elementary school teacher for a few years before moving up to middle school. With thirty younger kids running around with less self-control, a teacher had to be more observant. No one could get away with
The kid was
See, Alpha’s Night was coming up soon. It was tonight, as a matter of fact. Steve had heard nothing but people’s plans, hopes, and aspirations for the night for the last several weeks and he was sick to death of it. Omegas, according to society’s standards, were supposed to look and behave certain ways. Steve’s thin, gangly body, mountain of health issues, and habit to get into fights more often than the rowdiest of alphas did not fit that expectation.
“Sorry,” he murmured, grabbing a sheet corner and handing it to him like a tissue. Steve gave him a watery glare. “What?”
“Yes,” Tony answered.
Or if he was still very much like himself and would only ask for forgiveness after time had passed and SHIELD brought it up first.
“You wanna bet?” Steve dared, his smile sinister.
“So?”
Steve tore off his cap and ran his hands through his hair, groaning.
best things in my life. You are wicked intelligent, you don’t take crap from anyone, keep me on my toes, and always make me smile. You’ve given me so many more reasons to wake up in the morning, and god, you’ve given me friends beyond people I met through SI. Speaking of that, just in case you forgot, there are half a dozen people out in the living room who would kick my ass if I broke up with you just because you’re an alpha and I would be the first one. Maybe second, if Bucky fights me for that honor. So, just to say it again, I love you and that is not going to change no matter what else does.”
Antonius realized that there was some blood dripping down his chin.
He was human and imperfect, but he did his best to be so, so
“Yeah. I’ll admit I don’t know much about it, but I’m gonna become an expert in it before the weekend is over.”
“Rhodey,” he began.
“Oh, I’m fine, it’s just—”
“J?” he called, his voice sounding odd. Oh god, it was like a cartoon. “What are my visuals?”
“Are you kidding me?”
“Huh.”
“They’re idiots,” Natasha said as she sipped her tea and watched Tony and Steve go at it. Again.
Her too? Steve wondered.
Tony let out a long, deep sigh.
Steve grinned. “Bring it on.”
“I’m sure he’s gonna want another cappuccino,” Bucky said.
Tony wished that one of them were.
They had clearly given him power in their clan: though he had given Nat the arrowhead as a gift, she had returned it. He could see what would be happening in the future. If someone wanted or needed a tool, they would have to ask him to use it first. He would never refuse them the chance to bring more meat to the clan or sew a cloak, but that they would respect the tools he had made and thus respect him …
Bucky and Natasha were silently laughing—he could see the glee in their eyes—while Sam was covering his face and attempting to hold back a groan. Tony sympathized. He wanted to groan too and then for the floor to swallow him up.
Steve flushed. “But still, I can’t.”
Steve remained as everyone made their way out, wishing Tony well.
Now that Tony had a set of parameters to compare, he understood Peter’s actions and behaviors a lot more. He just assumed that Peter was energetic and took after him in terms of intelligence.
Pining
He did not hear everyone’s exclaims of surprise and delight until they shook him awake, amazed at the twenty arrowheads that he had so skillfully carved.
Perhaps it was the soft ocean-blue of his eyes. Perhaps it was his thin and skillful hands. Perhaps it was because he was stubborn and prone to proving himself when there really was no need to. Perhaps it was because when someone else would have killed Antonius when he first stumbled out of the burial mound, dirty and bleeding and marked by the gods, Stiofán reached out to him.
Then it dawned upon him. Just like there were asshole alphas out there who made him feel like next to nothing, who had him staring in the mirror and wishing he was small again, there were omegas out there who made alphas feel like they were worthless. How many times did Tony stare in a mirror and wonder what was wrong with himself too?
There were some rough patches and there likely would be more in the future that weren’t related to being an alpha or anything else. There were going to be many more moments—celebrations, arguments with customer support on the phone, nights where they tried to kill each other over a board game, and everything else in between. But he knew that Tony would be there for him, and he would be there for Tony in return.
Stiofán stared at him in wonder.
Steve sighed deeply, forcing a fresh wave of embarrassment to the back of his mind where it belonged. “I don’t know.”
“He leaves
Tony grinned. “Sounds great.”
Somewhere, somehow, Steve pissed someone off. Pissed someone off royally. And the best form of revenge that they could think up was to put someone completely unattainable within his reach. Why couldn’t he have been a mechanic? Wait, no, if Tony was a customer, it would still be a breach of ethics. God, he was screwed no matter what he did. Why couldn’t he have been—no, barista would do the same thing. Purchaser of a Stark Phone that happened to somehow run into Tony? Nah, statistical impossibility given the population of Manhattan.
“Nothing has changed,” she said. “But he smells off.”
“Like that, huh?” Tony teased, shifting his hand to scratch one of Steve’s ears.
The scent of chamomile started to rise. Tony smiled as he continued to massage Steve’s hands. This week, there were a lot less cuts from biting and picking at his cuticles. His joints popped a little bit, but that was typical. He had some extra assignments this week, but he enjoyed the work. It was a series for the national parks and he got to take a vintage direction with it.
But inside the bowl was a shining stone—a clear crystal—that made him gasp.
He was not one for much introspection, but figured what else was he going to do at this time? Trying to figure out math or design another schematic was too much at four in the morning when all he could smell was pollen and perfume and green things.
Smart to disguise himself further.
Third, Steve had wrapped it around his neck. Carefully and with consideration, making sure it wasn’t too tight or loose, didn’t leave a gap at the base of his neck, and was tucked in just right. Once or twice during that maybe ten second exchange, Steve’s fingers brushed up against his bare skin and it sent his heart skipping along a flower-filled meadow.
His tiny little hands and his fuzzy face.
Even if it took him forever, Tony would constantly do his best to make sure he never, ever gave Peter a reason to doubt his love for him or think he would be given back to the system.
Tony smiled sheepishly at him and closed the door. Steve waved as they inched away and through the tinted glass, he saw Tony make a face at him.
Fun tidbit: turns out I use a lot of 1930s and 40s slang. Steve and Bucky could use their full Brooklyn accents and all the jargon they wanted and I could still understand, because when looking up some of this stuff in a slang dictionary (
Tony made a noise and stuck out his tongue. “I am a master of many talents.”
“Ugh,” Steve groaned. “Come on. We’re outta here.”
New hole-in-the-wall coffee places were his
Mr. Roger nodded, seemingly unfazed by Tony’s attempts at trolling. “Yes, I apologize for that. I wanted to discuss the subject fully in person. Sometimes emails don’t convey everything well. But first, I want to start on a positive note. Peter is a delight to have in my class. He brings many interesting points of views to our class discussions and I have always enjoyed his projects. Many of the directions he takes them in are quite original.”
Oh, sure. He totally understood the aesthetic of spring.
Tony snorted. “And not liberty or something?”
“Hail—”
There was so much that Antonius did not know. There was so much he worried about, feared.
“You probably shouldn’t be hosting me. If your father were to find me, he’d blow a … what is that term? Fuse? Gasket?”
He sighed, leaning back in his chair.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “You shouldn’t refer to your superiors like that.”
No. Not going there.
Tony decided not to read into it and let them think what they want. They could always discuss it and have a heart-to-heart once they survived this.
Peter thought about it for a few moments.
Overnight, an unexpected cold front had hit the entire eastern seaboard. It didn’t bring any rain or snow, but there had been major winds overnight and a noticeable drop in temperature. Sure, it was getting closer to the winter, but no one was really looking forward to the days when they would need to shovel snow just to go to work or the grocery store. Well, Tony supposed, some people might. Bucky and Steve probably enjoyed shoveling snow.
“Obtuse then.”
For now, it was time for that wonderful miracle called “coffee”.
“That will be thirty dollars.”
Was there a way to have his cake and eat it too?
The last three days had been awful.
He shook his head and remembered that this was only a phone call.
“You guys aren’t even open yet, are you?”
“I am sure you are just pleased.”
He was not sure how they pulled it off, but he was almost a foot deep in bleeding heart flowers.
Thankfully, Tony finished his suit just moments before the alarm rang out and they were called to Assemble. They needed all hands on deck to defeat this week’s version of Doom Bots. Steve and Sam were already on the scene, having been nearby on a run when everything started to explode.
Near the mouth of the cave was a fire pit that allowed for light and warmth to come into the rest of the cave. He also could make out shelves where bread was stored above ground and a loom away from the fire. In the back of the cave were more supplies hanging on the walls, put on more shelves of wood tied together with leather strings, and a niche carved into one of the walls. He could not tell what was inside it. He knew better than to look.
“Hey! Pep!”
“You make sure you are never alone with him,” Tony begged. “We can’t trust him anymore. God, we should have never trusted him. Keep Happy around at all times, just in case.”
No one asked for axes or swords; for arrows to pierce men’s’ hearts.
Steve didn’t look up from his book. “Uh-huh.”
“Don’t remind me.”
“I’ll come and kick you around if you want,” Rhodey said, static marring some of his words. “More than happily, like back when I made sure you actually took your exams. As a matter of fact, you still owe me for that! I’m responsible for all of your degrees!”
“Yeah. So, I heard you like computers?”
A month later, another heat came around, but thanks to an army of doctors, it was not as bad as the time before. A few researchers hounded Steve for test results, written testimonies of experiences and symptoms, and blood samples, but he chased them off with some well-chosen words. Honestly, his life was turned upside down! Tony laughed for about an hour. Thanks to having the foresight to bring out his phone, so did everyone else when they saw the video.
had said in his head, over and over, like he was poking a bruise. They were okay. They had another date planned for the weekend, and in the grand scheme of things, Steve being Captain America wasn’t some betrayal. It was just about national and personal security.
“And no bacon,” Clint snickered around a mouthful of a BLT. “None.”
“Yeah. I’m,” he took in some more air, his lungs wheezing painfully. “I’ve been coughing up spores. I’m getting the results in today, but my doc can’t figure it out right now. It’s only been going on for a couple of days, breathe.”
But when one of them, a woman with shocking red hair, pointed at the strange material that was now in the center of his chest, Antonius quickly covered it with his hands.
Did he suspect something but couldn’t voice it?
Tony shook his head. “No. I’m sorry about that. If I had known, we’d have been doing this
This time, they were not heading to something that catered specifically to Peter’s strengths or interests. They were not even heading to some sort of school-wide event.
“Yeah.”
“This is a big change. We’re not …”
required so much heat and skill to work with, and sometimes, it was still brittle because of the impurities that were in it. Then there was the fact that wind and rain caused it to flake and turn. But if the cloak pin Nat had was any indication of what could be created with this new metal, then the things
Getting up, Steve went to the kitchen and fired up the coffee machine with the beans he had ground himself earlier that morning. Tony was there a moment later, hugging him from behind, pressing a kiss to his cheek. Steve leaned back into him and enjoyed his body heat, the soft, quiet moment. It was moments like these he loved committing to memory the most.
“That’s it?” Tony asked, squeezing Steve’s hand involuntarily. His palm was solid and warm. Steve’s thumb began to rub soothing circles on his wrist, right over his veins.
said papers. Love letters. God. Kill him now.
Rhodey gave him a look. “Wasn’t there this one place—”
“Sorry! I—sorry.”
Steve sighed then, as if he were going through some kind of torture. “It’s still demeaning. An omega doesn’t need to steal an alpha to prove they’re worthy or equal to an alpha. We do it all the time by literally doing all the things you guys do. Every day.”
“I don’t understand,” Antonius said, wishing he could. The man’s voice was soft and full of
Going over to him, Nat took his hand and placed the stone arrowhead she had used to kill the stag into his palm. He blinked up at her, not understanding. When he tried to give it back to her, she shook her head and curled his hand around it.
He and Tony waited a few moments, until everything became silent, save for the distant fighting.
The living room of the apartment was standard fare: a couch, an ottoman, a low table with random coasters on it, a plant in the window, and a television. He saw some pictures in frames on the wall, but he didn’t want to disturb anyone by wandering around to look at them. Going towards the only door that probably didn’t lead to a bedroom, he found a flight of stairs. If memory served right (he hoped it did), these were the same stairs Steve helped him walk up when he was half out of it from insomnia and too much caffeine.
it,” he gushed. “But beware, if Natasha gives you murder vibes, it’s because she’s secretly a spy, not because she actually wants to kill you.”
Anyone worth their salt could reasonably control themselves through heats or ruts. The symptoms, even the most common ones, could vary wildly, as did what their instincts insisted they do. Clint, a friend of Natasha’s, needed to make a ‘nest’ somewhere up high. Since he couldn’t attach it to a ceiling, he settled for making a pillow fort on the terrace of his apartment. Bucky often felt cooped up and like he would burst out of his skin, so he went to some of the more remote hiking trails for a few hours.
Bucky shook his head. “No. This hit him like a train. Pretty sure it’s not the flu, because we made sure to get our shots early.”
It was not wrong, people had told him throughout his life, to have feelings. Feelings were natural, normal. A part of the human condition and experience. However, Steve felt that all of the people who encouraged him to feel or act upon his feelings were not considering a major aspect of emotions: the circumstances surrounding them.
Peter nodded. “Okay.”
“Hey, they serve lemon water sometimes too,” he teased.
He realized, half way up the stairs, he was not fully awake to really appreciate that he was behind the counter. Sure, it was a little childish, but there was still a kind of thrill towards going places that were restricted in some way. This was not only behind the counter of the coffee shop, but also where Steve
Peter flushed. “Okay.”
“I think I know where we’re going,” Captain America said, right behind him. “You found some blueprints to the building, didn’t you?”
Steve laughed harder. “This was after high school graduation.”
He wasn’t supposed to say that out loud.
“Fine.”
“Yes,” Mr. Rogers agreed. “However, Peter has been displaying many symptoms that fall under ADHD. If this were about adjusting to middle school and a new environment, these issues would be less consistent and would be improving over time. I have also heard him complain that he has been losing possessions frequently, he forgets about extracurricular activities and other plans, and some of his relationships with his classmates have been deteriorating.”
He was free and his friends were beside him.
“Hey,” he replied. “I want your most complicated, obnoxious drink.”
“And I thought I told everyone no shovel talk,” Steve said, lightly smacking Sam’s shoulder.
The sniper nodded and turned around, heading down the hallway once more. They followed. “I got an escape route this way. Our backup is falling back now.”
“Zip it.”
“Lawyers,” Tony repeated. “It’s the least I can do.”
Steve had an arm around his waist and was helping him up the stairs.
Then Steve kissed him and Tony put all thoughts of flowers out of his mind.
“So, you have a bit of a crush,” Tony continued. “No problem. You just need to remain professional. Dating your student’s teacher is a breach of ethics.”
Oh, and then there was Steve’s side of this.
Steve swallowed thickly.
Tony shrugged, glad Steve wasn’t going to attempt to lie. “A lot of little things. Your voice, how you moved. You’ve got perfect runner’s form, you know?”
Tony turned back to Steve with a dignified, “Huh?”
“Lawyers,” Peter interrupted, looking shy. Like he wasn’t used to someone defending him.
Did Tony really see Alpha Night like that? As an opportunity to get around all that? He had to ask him more questions, figure out his other opinions about courtship rituals. Was Steve going about this all wrong? Was there a chance to win him if he didn’t want to follow tradition?
“So flirt back. Stop having a crisis. Ask him out.”
“You—you’re bruising like a peach! I can’t have—! Come on, my place isn’t too far from here and I got a bit of a kit.”
“That is nothing,” a third voice said. “I want to poke around that arc reactor of his.”
“One of these days,” he said with a screwdriver in a corner of his mouth. He was messing with a new phone prototype, using another screwdriver to get a component out.
Peter just blurted it out in front of MJ and Ned.
Hopefully, he would get to the bottom of this. It was sweet, in a weird way, that his son wanted him to have a love life, but with his history teacher of all people? Sure, he had a crush on Steve. He was very crush-worthy. But this hyper-focus wasn’t like when he was on that old school NASA binge or when he wanted nothing but strawberry flavored cereal for a month.
a perfect angel who had never done anything wrong.
But since when had life ever been predictable or easy for him?
Tony waved a hand, stopping him. “Nah, I’m not that much of an asshole to make you work after you just finished cleaning up. Besides, that looks like a more important mess than my mission to evade sleep for as long as possible.”
It was rough.
, but how many actually watched them? Was he an avid
Tony hated romance.
So just
(It wasn’t.)
? How did those people know he would be there? Even if it was just a coincidence, Tony had been kidnapped enough times to know that there were no such things as coincidences. Someone planned this. Someone leaked information about the test site and security measures and exploited it all.
“I make no promises.”
Steve looked up from him then, using his finger as a temporary bookmark. However, instead of having a contemplative look on his face, he almost had a pout.
of Hanahaki,” Steve sighed, rolling his eyes fondly, as if Tony was an idiot. “I looked into it as a possibility last night. I’ll be fine, if not single-handedly keeping Kleenex afloat. Besides, if they’re not ready to tell me their feelings or if they are working through something, I gotta respect that.”
“Is that why you’ve moved seats in class and are allowed to have your phone on your desk?” Ned asked. “Do those things help?”
“I really like that department, though,” Tony said. “Being able to create and toss ideas around and solve problems … sure, I have to manage projects the company decides to do and not everything will be approved because ‘money’, but I like it better than paperwork and lawyers.”
Tony pointed his tiny screwdriver at Peter. “I knew I liked you for a reason.”
Steve laughed and fished through his pocket for his wallet. He easily flipped to a picture of him and Bucky from when they were kids, grinning like idiots as they were soaking wet. It was summertime and the water balloon in Steve’s hand explained it all. In it, there was no ignoring that he was skinny and almost a little gaunt, his pale skin already flushed with sunburn.
Tony gave a soft knock. Silence followed, so he waited a few moments.
“No, you’re right. Doing this ritual is old fashioned, ultimately doesn’t prove a thing, and just perpetuates all sorts of harmful stereotypes and aspects of our culture. However, ignoring all of that, it comes down to an alpha and omega being able to express interest and consent to one another without all of the usual courtship trappings or social expectations. If I could, I would make that the everyday experience, but one step at a time.”
“Don’t feel guilty for surviving,” Pepper begged him. “Don’t. You are
But now … Now those who meant the most to him were here, safe and sound. And from the looks of it, maybe two more than he expected.
“Tony, all pedestrians hit every single crosswalk.”
Some discussion later led to getting a coffee at a nearby café.
“Tony!” Steve yelled, his voice amplified by the closed elevator.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Steve asked, bewildered.
Tony smiled nervously, like he was unused to asking for such things and someone reacting like it was no big deal. Which it wasn’t. “Sounds good.”
Steve turned and fixed his best ‘Disappointed Captain America’ face. Clint remained unaffected, only extremely put out by Bruce betraying him.
“Stock in my company? Sorry, I’m not in charge of that.”
“And what if your alpha was happy to run with you to the judge’s office?”
“Want to tell me about your latest project? Apparently you bugged Bucky for all of his pictures out at … where was it? Zion? Yellowstone?”
Tony could see Pepper shoving sexual harassment forms and classes at him already. Bad train of thoughts, abort, reboot! Find something appropriate to say!
you were turned into a squirrel?”
Fury stood up straighter. The representatives all hastily stood up.
“You say that like
Tony thought about the blueprints.
Stiofán looked ashamed.
! Where do you get these ideas? Do I need to put parental locks on the internet?”
“What claim?” Tony asked after downing some more coffee.
Steve looked up from the book he was reading. He was manning the library desk today, ensuring that people found their books and didn’t have too many hiccups with the new self-checkout stations. Overall, it had been a quiet day, until now. Peter Parker, who was a freshman and something like Tony’s mentee, came running up to the desk in an absolute panic.
Tony had a problem.
Peter quickly took a bite of his ice cream and suffered a mild brain freeze in his attempt to avoid the question. They had gone to one of their favorite ice cream shops that had all sorts of amazing flavors. Peter predictably got the one that was blended with all sorts of breakfast cereals. Tony decided to go for a simple dark chocolate.
He felt his stomach and spirit sink.
Steve laughed, bitter and resigned. “Sure. Tony you don’t—”
“You sure it’s not Steve?” Rhodey asked.
He asked the following morning. No one was surprised when Steve said yes.
“oh hi, totally didn’t expect to see you here at this one hole in the wall coffee shop literally no one in the entire world besides you knows about. what a coincidence.”
“Oh, for god’s sake, Stevie!” Bucky yelled. “His family has been in the business since World War II! I think he knows a thing or two about arms races!”
How long had it been since someone had not seen his father’s face and remembered his wrath and prowess at battle? How long had it been since someone had not seen his mother’s eyes and wondered what happened to her and her wealth? How long had it been since someone had not looked at him and only saw something to be controlled and used?
Captain America rolled his eyes and informed someone else of the change of plans through an ear piece. Once he was finished with the call, he waved his hand to follow him down a hallway.
“On it, sir.”
The man sneered. “Second guess and you’re still wrong. And they call you a genius. Get up.”
“Geez, you make me feel lazy.”
Clovers apparently were not just a symbol of Ireland or good luck.
Steve’s voice was cut off when Tony dove into the electronics of the Doom bot. It was a pity that the designs were solid—he was sure these robots could be put to much better use than destruction and mayhem. But, Doom’s lack of foresight would be his loss. How much more money and bad press could Doom handle before it all sunk?
“Lights,” he whispered.
There was silence on the other end of the line.
There was a familiar ‘zing’ in the air.
“It’s Tuesday!”
Tony laughed at his ridiculous husband.
“Better?”
“You do.” Bucky snickered.
Of course, like with the manicures, he had Tony to thank for that.
“Very well,” JARVIS replied, selecting something at random. Given the amount of Disney movies that was in the archives, no one was surprised to see the logo sequence come up.
With their different class schedules, Bucky’s part time job at the mechanic shop, and Steve’s work study at the campus library, it could be a hit or miss knowing if Bucky would be at the apartment or not. Sure, they tried to keep their schedules straight, but a piece of paper on the fridge only worked if they remembered to keep it current.
“Are you okay? You seem distracted lately.”
Old and bitter memories were instantly stirred up. He hated that he wasn’t contacted the moment Peter’s mother had died. If she had told him, if he had
Something in SI changed.
Even after their argument, even after Steve left the estate, Tony took the time to
The nearby forests also held many foods to be foraged. He did not recognize many of the plants that were in it. They were all leafier, cool to the touch. He left gathering those plants up to Shem’el and Stiofán. The last thing he wanted to do was accidentally pick a fatal flower. It was also not wise to go into the forest alone, even in the afternoon. He heard wolves howling the first night he had slept in the cave with the rest of the clan. He had not heard wolves in a long time, so protected in the highly organized and developed village he had been born in.
“Yes, honeybunch?”
The sniper looked over his shoulder and Tony was
Something told Tony that winter this year would be a bitter one. Frost was still lingering on the windows despite the morning sun and some people were worrying over storms and winds affecting winter festivals and events. The autumn events were a hit like always. Rhodey wasn’t able to go to the Comic Con, but Pepper thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate festival and all it had to offer. Sadly, Tony was steered out of the coffee festival after one hour. He did have to admit, it was probably for the best. Coffee beans boasting three times the amount of caffeine wouldn’t be good for anyone’s heart, no matter the condition.
Thor blinked slowly at them. “Stephen, what do you think pining consists of?”
“And that’s when he jumped me!” Flash burst out. “He totally went ballistic!”
He nodded.
“Thank you, for everything you did,” Captain America said. “It was messier than the usual rescue, but it would have been worse if not for your quick thinking.”
Tony pretended Bruce was trying to poison him in the ultimate betrayal.
Tony was still trying to wrap his brain around
“Yeah?” Steve asked, biting his lip.
Tony and Peter both stood in the front office, awkwardly, as Mr. Thompson took Flash home.
He could not believe that this was his life: standing in a grand house in Mayfair—
Steve? Steve with his heart on his sleeve? Steve who couldn’t resist picking a fight with a bully, even though he was a grown adult? Steve who couldn’t lie to save his life? Steve who could be a little shit and never saw a point in beating around the bush?
At this point, Happy had parked the car. “You two need a minute?”
Steve—oh thank god, he finally caught up with him again—stopped wiping down a table near the front for a moment, lemon-scented cleaner mixing in with the coffee.
“Not a problem. The fire alarm sent a lot of people packing, but I’m not sure how many of them were … civilian workers of HYDRA or how many agents stuck around. I was hoping to sneak out to the ground level by using the elevator or crowds as covered.”
. Crushes on celebrities or so-called ‘nice guys’ thinking they deserved love because they treated someone like a human being did not count. That was another part of it that made Tony sick, because this meant someone truly loved him, but thought that he would not feel the same.
numbers. People who could ruin numbers should be outlawed.
“I will.”
“You plan on courting someone?”
When the SHIELD helicopter finally came, Tony felt his knees go weak.
Steve heard someone approaching and if he was right, it was—
“Uh. That’s all the Irish I know, sorry.”
“What’d you yet?” Tony asked as he wandered up, wondering what the heck could have Steve acting like it was Christmas. Seriously, he was jumping up and down, like he could barely contain himself, and his smile had to be hurting his cheeks.
He needed to get un-kidnapped first.
“Come on, Pep, at least one. We could split it.”
Even without the phone, he could hear the whimper Steve let out.
That was not smooth at all.
“Admit it, you love the tropes as much as anyone else,” Pepper laughed.
Steve blinked at him before his face started turning a bit red.
Steve gasped.
“Tony?” he exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”
Steve looked annoyed for about a second longer before he shrunk in on himself, looking shy and insecure. Tony was about to launch into another serenade about how much more amazing Steve was than he clearly thought of himself, but held back. Steve had a determined look in his eye.
Steve chuckled and smoothed his hair. “I’m not. Ma sent a batch over yesterday. It’s still in the fridge, so it’ll be ready in a few minutes. That’s even better.”
“So, it’s a joke?”
“You’ll figure out how to tell your pops,” Steve encouraged. “It’s not like you signed a contract when you were born or something. Maybe you could compromise? Find someone who would be a better CEO and you become the head of the R&D department when that guy steps down. Buy some more stock or whatever, if it will put your pops at ease.”
“Are you crazy? You—you can’t just say those things! H-How could you!”
“Maybe because we don’t like complaining,” Sam replied.
“On a sci-fi kick?” Tony asked, smiling.
Bucky was at the counter again today. He gave him a smile and eyed Bruce a little critically. Bruce was kind of in a disarrayed, rumpled form today, thanks to a science binge that Tony was not responsible for. Just because he could lose himself in engineering and machinery did not mean that other scientists weren’t capable of getting lost in their own fields as well. Hence him proudly proclaiming to Pepper how
It wasn’t anything like what happened in the 90s, especially with some of the policies from the Bush Administration, but Tony had lost count how many times his knuckles rapped by a ruler or he had been dragged to the principal’s office for some teacher to complain about how he was so easily distracted and restless, how he didn’t follow directions, or got into arguments.
Hey everyone!
He just wanted to be able to save his best friend at the drop of a hat, if needed.
“Yes. He doesn’t smell like he usually does. This is … bitter. Like chocolate.”
“Yeah, but what if it’s something a little more?”
Tony quirked an eyebrow. “Oh?”
At least until someone put various snacks in front of them, including some bottles of water. Both of them jumped in surprise.
“Marry me,” Tony said. “Forget about money and titles and what the gossipmongers will say and just marry me.”
“Did you mean what you said?”
In the middle of the courtyard, among more soldiers and armored knights, Bruce—also known as The Hulk—was battling dozens on his own with ease. Cursed with a wrathful, monstrous form, they had hoped to not need to call for his services.
Bucky and Sam teased him relentlessly, but there was a reason why he had a sketchbook dedicated to just putting Tony on paper. He loved the way he smiled, the way he threw his head back when he laughed. He loved how graceful his fingers were and the power in his shoulders. Sure, he was shorter and more compact than the typical alpha, Steve hardly cared about ‘typical’ when he could see Tony’s eyes light up when he figured something out. There were way too many times where he had to force himself to pay attention to what Tony was saying instead of just listening to the sound of his voice wash over him.
“Yeah, that was from my USO days,” Steve said, voice heavy with emotions Tony couldn’t place. “You had to know some ballet, and keeping upright helps increase forward momentum. The girls trained me worse than any drill sergeant.”
“Nice job,” the sniper praised, his garbled voice still odd to Tony’s ears. He and Captain America looked winded now. How many goons were waiting for them on the roof? How long had it taken them to take them all out?
In the distance, there was a fiery explosion that shook everything, even the floor of the tower they were in. Men shouted, word spreading quickly of an attack.
