“Well now what does that say about you?” Steve asks kneeling in front of the boy “what does your remorse tell me Peter.”
Steve is torn on what to do, his new family is falling apart and he has to figure out how to put the pieces back together. What can he do Tony won’t talk to him and Peter only comes out of his room for food. How can he possibly do anything good for them if they won’t do anything for themselves.  He knew what Peter said to Tony, of course he was mad when the words reached his own ears. He had rushed in when he heard Peter yelling at Tony, he was powerless to stop the words from affecting Tony so deeply. While on the other had Tony needed to hear those words, Tony needed to understand that there needs to be a balance of yes and no when parenting.
Wade hears the cries of his beloved Peter and looks everywhere he can for him, his eyes land to a couple of boys standing above Peter. One of them is stomping repeatedly on his glasses and the other is going to start kicking him. Rage is the only thing he feels as he rushes the boy  that is going to kick Peter.
“Not now Tony…” Steve says brushing off the flirtation. Flirting won’t make him forget being left out.
Tony pulls the two closer to him, feeling a little left out and all. “Yeah it is pretty gross, but no one would dare do that to him now a days” he laughs kissing the top of Peter’s head.
“We’ll go tomorrow it’s the weekend by then and it’s also our field trip we’ll run away then! ” Wade says thinking of the escape plan.
Jack sat there listening to the stories about what has happened recently to a kid named Peter and him. Peter sounds really important to Wade just like he used to be, Jack just smiles and nods before talking about all the things he’s done so far.
It’s a long  hour filled with nice small talk and math problems. Ms. Skye loves how much Peter enjoyed math, she felt even more ecstatic when she heard that one of his fathers is picking him up. Steve had the afternoon free so he ended up with picking Peter up from school only for him to be ambushed by the teacher Peter was with.
Steve is of course still pissed beyond belief at Tony, how could he not be. He feels so neglected, so left out. All he wants is to tell Tony how he feels and put that selfish greedy man in his place… right next to him… where they can love each other for all their shortcomings along with all of the other things.
“Of course we do, you are the best thing that has ever happened to us, you are so important to us, Peter do you understand why your words hurt Tony so badly now?” Steve wipes away his tears as he smiles at him.
Peter exits the Elevator with Tony to the common area, Wade looks over from his game and smiles “Peter do you want to come play with me?!” He asks looking at the two.
“Yes Tony I’ll forgive you if Natasha has at least” Bruce says swatting Wade’s hand away from the toaster.
Jack did what he could around the small two bedroom apartment and whenever the bar was closed. James was good to him, taught him how to cook some basic things like hamburgers and bacon.
“Hey umm Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers… who’s going to make breakfast?” a little boys voice asks out of the blue.
Tony walks over to the couch to see Peter sitting next to Wade “So You Don’t Discipline Your Kid? No wonder he’s starting fights with mine.” Tony says rudely.
“So what if I am? The kid deserved that and more every single day before I finally-” the man wasn't able to finish his sentence because Steve knocked a couple -way more than a couple- of his teeth out.
“Look I know this is a big adjustment for kid, it’s a big change! You were kinda thrown into this whole big mess of things, I know this is hard for you, you’re starting school soon and you only have one person around here that’s your age, this is all just a big mess and it’s going to be hard.” Tony pulls Peter into his arms and holds him.
Ms. Skye rushes to the door when the figure on the other side knocks. “Oh goodness you must be one of Peter’s fathers! I’m so happy to meet you, I have the best news about your son!” She says holding on to Steve’s hands.
"Ever since…" Stark's voice audibly froze. "Ever since… 'The Incident,' my mind's been going non-stop. I keep thinking about what went wrong – what I did wrong – and I keep trying to fix it, and yeah, blaming myself kind of goes along with all of that."
"Uh, better than I expected?" Tony winced. "I mean, he didn't verbalize how disgusted he was with me, so that seems positive." Rhodey could not help but be disappointed in how low his friend's bar for "positive" was set, but at the same time he could not blame him. "He also did try to warn me that the board might oust me for this, so…" Rhodey's nostrils flared almost as much as his anger.
If it weren't for the fact that there was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent sitting right there, neither Pepper nor Lara would have had time to school their expressions into something more friendly and appropriate. Freeman had been coming up on them so fast, he was practically running, but the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent sprung up and got between them, demanding to see ID. Freeman was thrown off-kilter for a second, but recovered enough to fork over both his driver's license and his SI ID. The agent (Agent Morse, apparently from what she told Freeman) took both IDs and studied them with more scrutiny than she had Lara's. After a few moments, she appeared to be satisfied and handed the IDs back but was sure to keep her eyes on him cautiously. Freeman gave her a nod in thanks and continued his way over to Pepper.
"Yeah," Lara said. "But I couldn't get my fingers those damn petit little wires with those things on. You should have made those wires bigger."
"Well, right now I want him to rest," Dr. Fox said firmly so that way certain people (Tony) would understand that this is non-negotiable. "Captain Rogers is both physically and mentally exhausted from the trauma of this whole ordeal. Although they appear to be sleeping, most coma patients' brains are still active as they remain in their vegetative states. Of course, it's taxing for the brain to be continuously running at full power without the 'break' that sleep provides – although the brain never really takes a break – so a lot of times a patient will awaken from his coma and fall straight back to sleep. It's not that unusual. Captain Rogers seemed to be fighting sleep while I was checking up on him. That's a pretty impressive feat considering how long he was under and how much valium we've been pumping into his system."
Suddenly, this reality started to feel like it had gravity to it. He kept expecting for a flash to pull him away into the other one, but it didn't seem like that was going to happen. After a few seconds, he felt safe enough to try and respond to her.
Let's start with the pandemic because it's kind of the elephant in the room. To be clear, I wrote and posted that storyline with Clint getting infected months before the Coronavirus even first popped up. I had no idea this was going to happen and if it makes you uncomfortable to read those chapters again, I don't blame you. I'm a little uncomfortable reading those chapters myself. (Though my discomfort centers around the fact that I'm pretty sure now I got a lot of things wrong about quarantine and isolation, but I'm not a medical professional, so that was bound to happen.) My mental health - like so many others' - took a nosedive after the pandemic started and it's been really hard to motivate myself to even get out of bed, nevermind write. My physical health also hasn't been good. I haven't gotten the virus yet, but I've had other health issues to deal with and it's been a little hard to get in to see an actual doctor since this crisis started. So, yeah, that's been impeding my ability to write, too. I know, this is all excuses, but to be fair I have up to chapter forty-seven completed and you are going to have two solid months of uninterrupted posting, so really it's not that bad.
Once he was up, he put his hands down on the desk and leaned forward, taking slow, deep breaths. His eyes scanned the room. Everything looked the same, which should have been reassuring, yet somehow it wasn't. He swallowed hard.
"Alright," he said to Pepper before turning to Happy. "Can you take her to one of the guest rooms?" He gestured to Lara. "I doubt she can get herself home like this."
"Glad I could do my part." Tony wished he had a pillow or something he could throw at Rhodey. "Now is there anything else you want to go on this paper?"
Happy Canada Day to all Canadians! Enjoy the freedom you politely asked for and was given rather than just throw a tantrum like a spoiled toddler and take it yourself! (Looking at you, America!)
"Right," Tony said. "Avoid direct contact with his hands. The only problem with that is if I want to fight him, I'm going to have to do it hand-to-hand."
"Pretty sure he was born like this," Clint said. "He didn't have any blood on him, and I can't feel anything when I touch it…" Clint moved his hand over the stump, but immediately pulled it back when the dog gave a yelp of displeasure. "Yeah, he was born like this. He's just sensitive about it."
Despite his assurance, being alone in the room with Steve was easier said than done. He was just so tense and Tony knew it was because of Peggy telling him Steve was bi. He knew he had nothing to apologize for – Peggy was the one who broke Steve's trust, apparently, not him – but he didn't know how to proceed from here. He was just about to take a shot in the dark and say something, but his attention was diverted when a knock was heard from the doorway. Immediately he turned to see a man wearing a uniform emblemized with Los Angeles County Sherriff's Department patches.
Lara flicked the light off and laid back in bed. Her prospects at getting a full night's rest were looking good. Todd was going to be accompanying her to the courthouse the next day, so for once she and her boyfriend wouldn't be spending the whole night partaking in amorous activities. As such, the apartment was mostly quiet. (You could never really escape the noise in the city.)
"JARVIS," she called out. "Can you call the fire department's non-emergency number and tell them that there's no fire and the alarms went off falsely?"
To distract himself, Tony turned his attention over to Pepper, whose eyes were flitting from screen to screen with a look of deep shock on her face. Tony listened as she took a deep breath and finally spoke up.
Tony really wished he could direct a glare at himself. Instead, he settled for directing it at Freeman's image on the holographic screen. Eventually, though, he had to relent and did so with a heavy sight.
With all of this in mind, it made what happened to Tony make the slightest bit more sense. Add to that his celebrity and notoriety – which made him a household name – and the perfect recipe for a sordid controversy came together almost perfectly. It was a piece of gossip no one could resist, and almost everyone had to see for themselves in order to believe; Tony Stark was gay, and footage of him having sex with another man existed to prove it. All that had to be done to see proof was to pop a VHS into a tape player, and once convinced, for the person to pass the tape on to someone else.
"Good to know I'm not alone in that opinion." He heard Lara scoff at that as he turned back around to face her. "So, did you get any actual sleep or am I going to have to explain to everyone why you're walking around like you're auditioning for
Once they arrived at the hospital, Tony was quickly whisked off by several nurses to a private room on a mostly empty floor. Steve and Conroy were directed to a waiting room while Pepper followed Tony into his room. After Afghanistan and the whole Stane situation, Tony arranged things so that if he should get kidnapped/die/be rendered incapacitated in any way shape or form, Pepper and Rhodey had the legal authority to make decisions on his behalf. Currently, Rhodey was on a classified mission (something that seemed to be happening a lot in the weeks since he first donned the War Machine armor) so that left Pepper to be the de facto legal authority should something happen, or his illness became worse.
"I don't see how that should matter. I mean if you're ready and willing to talk." Carol narrowed her eyes while Natasha's raised in challenge. Before an argument could get started, Steve stepped in between them, placing a hand on each of their shoulders.
"Nah, my legs are tired anyways from sitting on them. Might as well stretch them out." Crossing the room with ease, Lara had the door open within moments. The shocked note in her voice was palpable. "Freeman? What are you…?"
"Yeah," Clint remarked as he quickly wiped off some of his arrows and stuck them back in his quiver. "Get in line."
"Alright," she said. "Don't worry, I know how to find him." That didn't make Steve feel reassured at all, but he accepted it as he and Natasha began to make their way out of the lab and back upstairs. "So, did I miss something or was Stark just trying to get to me back there?"
"Please tell me that wasn't the water I just made." Confused, Stark looked at the glass and back at her.
"Grow a spine, JARVIS," Tony remarked. "Tell him that I have a date." It was the truth, even if his date hadn't shown up yet.
My Dad's coming to pick me up at nine and it's 8:48 right now so I have to make this quick. Thank you for reading this story and chapter! Please favorite and follow if you like and don't be afraid to leave a review!
"Stark!" Natasha called out. "We're back! Loki's in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and he won't be getting out any time soon." Tony pulled back and looked at Steve, slightly disappointed.
Steve hadn't noticed it before, but Tony had apparently been walking with his eyes closed the entire time they were walking through the plane. He only realized it when Tony opened his eyes to look around. Well, that explained why it had been so difficult to walk.
She raised her gun at Knežević, but not fast enough. In that split-second, he reached out and grabbed Nina's forearm. Nina rushed to take a few steps backward, breaking the hold he had on her. Her eyes went to the spot where he had grabbed her, and she let out an ear-piercing scream. Duran's eyes widened with shock as Nina's arm slowly turned to stone.
"Do you need any help with this?" she asked. "I'm taking a break for lunch right now and I can still forge your signature. I can knock a few of these out for you." Tony shook his head.
"He could and he probably would," Lara said. "He'd also probably pay off my sixty-four thousand dollars in medical debt if I asked him to, but I don't make it a habit to take advantage of people like that. That's also probably why I get stepped on all the time, but you know…"
Going slow and being careful not to step on something sharp enough to go through his shoe and stab his foot, Tony made his way downstairs and immediately punched in his access code into the panel by the door. When the door came unlocked he rushed into the lab and was relived to see that it didn't look like anyone had gotten down there or taken anything. The lab was just as he left it days before. (Well, DUM-E had somehow inexplicably got himself wrapped up in measuring tape, but that wasn't too out of the ordinary.) Slowly, Tony let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.
The whole thing was surreal. No one ever expects to see themselves in a museum, and they certainly don't expect their exhibit to be dedicated "in memoriam." There were dozens of items locked in glass cases and numerous framed photographs lining the walls. Each member of the Howling Commandos had their picture on the wall with a small biography on a golden plaque underneath it. Steve skimmed through all of them, but his eyes lingered on Bucky's for just a moment too long.
Yes, Steve was aware of the irony of Captain America being scared. He did not need anyone to point it out or rub it in. What he needed was a magic boost in confidence that would make him not care about those things and just let himself be happy with Tony. However, reality did not work like that.
With that, the two of them pulled back. Tony shot a very displeased glare at the smirking redhead as he slid off the counter Steve had apparently pushed him up against.
"Alright," he said. "What's got you looking all scowl-faced there, Miss Killer Instinct." Natasha rolled her eyes at the nickname, but otherwise remained solemn.
"Okay." Lara turned her attention back to the screen, intently tapping away. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she almost jumped out of her seat. "Ooo! It says if I register for a rewards card, I can get a free party cake with the rental of any conference or common room, star restrictions apply."
"Are you okay now?" she asked. "Do you want to talk about it?" Nina nodded in the affirmative and Oswin took a deep breath. "Alright, lay it on me."
Although a doctor would probably advise against it, Tony was once again trying to alleviate his pain with alcohol. Yes, he knew that all alcohol did was numb the pain a bit and cause problems such as dehydration and deoxygenation of the brain which would end up making his headache much worse later, but now he didn't care. It was making him feel something resembling better and it had the added benefit of making him forget about the earlier interview, so in his mind, it was the best option available to him for getting through this press conference with his fragile sanity intact. Besides, for right now it was just one drink and it wasn't like he'd be driving himself home later.
"Wait, what do you mean you were 'assured'?" Pepper narrowed her eyes at him. "Didn't you read the questions before you went on-air?"
"I know," Lara agreed. "I was more talking about life in general. You know, getting back up on your feet?"
"Put on the suit," he said. "Let's go a few rounds." Once again, dirty thoughts started outweighing Tony's anger, but he was able to keep in check. He kept his eyes locked on Steve, challenging him to do something about it. He was only distracted by Thor's sudden burst of laughter.
"I know that," Steve said. "I know everyone already knows about you and realistically, this wouldn't put you in any danger, but I can't…" Steve had to take a deep breath. He couldn't figure out where his thoughts were going. He just knew he needed to make one thing clear to Tony. "You know I… Care about you, right?" He didn't risk using the "L" word for fear of a bad reaction. Hesitantly, Tony nodded.
With that thought, Oswin realized what she needed to do. She had to turn herself in. She didn't care if she was going to go to jail anymore. Innocent people were in danger and it wasn't like she had anything to lose.
"Well, I hate to tell you this, but your test turned up some very alarming results." Lara raised an eyebrow.
"I think so, too," Laura said. Clint looked back at the screen and his heart was warmed by the radiant smile she was giving him.
Jessica put the finishing touches on her makeup and pulled back her hair. Technically, she wasn't supposed to be wearing any, but she found that if she only kept it to a small amount in her natural shades, she usually could get away with it. The uniform was simple; a white polo shirt, khaki pants, and sturdy sneakers. Cheap enough for even the poorest members of the congregation to afford. Women could leave their hair straight down, pulled back with a black or white hairband, or up in a ponytail. No pigtails, buns, or braids. Black members could still have dreadlocks, but Jess had the sinking suspicion that if a white member tried to pull off that hairstyle, they'd have their entire head shaved.
"I think JARVIS can," Lara said. "But I'm sure Tony has a way to override him. The point would be mute."
Tony didn't know why he was so upset about that. Again, it wasn't like this was anything new. Steve had seen him at his absolute worst. Seeing him acting like a fool on a surveillance tape wouldn't change anything. Still, Tony somehow felt hurt. Not by Steve, but by himself.
"Nothing pressingly urgent," he assured, not wanting or needing to alarm her. "At least, not right now." He heard her give a sigh of relief.
"Depends." Steve turned to Tony. "Do you want to go?" Slowly but surely, Tony nodded. He felt Steve's warm arms start to wrap around him just as Carol approached.
"Partially," Adoniram confirmed. "Unification is important, but there's only one true way we can all be saved."
Entering the room, she made eye contact with Dante almost instantly. She was surprised to see that he looked about halfway decent. His hair was trimmed as neatly as she'd ever seen it and the long-sleeved button-up shirt he was wearing covered his tattoos. Most shockingly, though, was the fact that he looked happy to see her. The feeling wasn't mutual, and she wanted to make sure that he knew it.
"I should probably look into that once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files." Alarm bells chimed loudly in Steve's head.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I should have consulted you before asking Natasha to fill in for me, but to be fair, I had other things on my mind and I just wanted to be certain you'd get to that board meeting."
Tony nodded in agreement but did not say anything else for fear of being pressed for further explanation. He was still trying to figure out how to do this in the right way. He did not want to screw this up. If he did, there would not be any do-overs. No second chances. Nothing. That was it. To say that put some pressure on him would be a dramatic understatement.
With the Asgardian family gone, and Thor having left a bottle of mead on the table, Tony saw an opportunity and popped the cork.
Peter got up out of bed and went to the bathroom and climbed onto the counter from the toilet, he got into the medicine cabinet and get some painkillers for the two men.  He went back and gave them to Steve first then Tony. The two men quickly took the pills and drank some water not really knowing who the kid is.
“I saw that” he laughs  rushing over to his husband “Steve what the hell happened?” Tony huffs at the taller man.
“Because I don't want you hanging out with this trouble maker who isn't even disciplined” Tony glares at Wade.
Steve’s threat has Tony trying to pull away “How Could You~!” Tony cries dramatically as he fails to escape his significant other’s grasp.
“Oh no! I got adopted by two amazing men! They are so nice to me, they love me and they are working out how to raise a kid but they are doing the best they can” Peter smiles up at her.
“Steve punched a guy who used to be the foster father of my son. Oh yeah on another note you’re an aunt now” Tony chimes into the phone.
Peter nods as he pulls the men towards the doors of the mall “that doesn't matter now, come on let’s go!”
“I know, look here you got me, Stebe, Wade, Nat, and Bruce, and everyone else. We’re going to take care of you, we’ll love you for you, and we’re always going to be here for you. I know you feel like this is only temporary but Peter it’s not you’re stuck with us” Tony chuckles poking the back of Peter’s head.
Peter is then in the hands of the man behind him and he finally got a good look at him. Blonde and blue eyed, and very angry. “Peter!” his name came from none other than both of his dads as they started searching for him.
Jack jumps off the bar stool and sneaks over to the table. “Hi can I take your order?” he asks staring at the kid who is looking at the women.
Wade looks at his dear friend and lets out a sigh “Peter I will never leave you no matter what! Okay?”
The door burst open to reveal a redheaded women “Peter are you in here?”  her voice is like candy to wade’s ears.
“Tony I'm so sorry I said that to you, I don't want to be sent back and I am very happy you guys adopted me… You guys are the bestest thing that has ever happened to me”  Peter looks up at Tony as the tears drip down his face “I love you.”
The next morning Peter goes down to Wade’s floor waiting for him and his mom to come take them to the school for the field trip. He sits at the counter as Wade sneaks up behind him. Wade grabs Peter's’ sides “Blah” he shouts causing the younger one to jump and fall onto the older one.
As Peter runs to the lab he hears Bruce talking to Tony. Peter stops at the door to eavesdrop before he decides to interrupt them.
“Will do” he says before hanging up “Steve check his wallet” Tony looks at Peter and wipes off the drying tears “and you little man stop crying” he chuckles at the boy.
“Natasha Your boy got into a fight because Peter started a fight with a couple of other kids there is no good reason for that” Tony lashes back.
The drive to the school is short, the bus ride to the convention center was very boring for the boys, the whole day was planned, they would enjoy the field trip and once the classes went back to the buses the two wouldn't get on. They got split up by being in a different group from each other. This made Peter anxious, he didn't want to leave Wade’s side but the stupid teachers make him. Some guide lady directs the classes attention to a big thing of different types of spiders “then we have here a Achaearanea tepidariorum or otherwise known the common house spider” She says pointing to a glass case with twigs, grass, and other stuff for the spider. “This spider has been genetically modified with radiation, this has made it so the web is stronger, the spider itself seems to be immune to insecticides and some other nifty things” she finishes.
Bruce is shocked with how Wade is acting “you can call me dad then, father is to formal for me anyways” he laughs “alright well wade let’s get you cleaned up” he takes Wade’s other hand and pulls him and Peter to the infirmary.
Peter plates the eggs and starts making some toast “it also looks like we started fostering a kid” Steve says watching the boy.
If Tony had known having kids was going to be this hard he wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Peter is having a hard time so that means Tony and Steve would have to be patient with the kid. “Peter come here” Tony pats the spot next to him. Peter doesn’t budge, Tony sighs.
Tony pulls out his phone and speed dials Pepper. He waits for the female voice to answer her end of the line “Pep prepare the hounds” his voice is flat and dull.
Wade looks at Peter then back at the adults. He grabs Peter’s hand and pulls him to his feet, they run to the elevator to go back to Peter’s floor. Wade mainly only wants to get Peter out of that situation he’s had enough bad vibes today. “Look bud you should get some rest you've had a long day” Wade says grasping Peter’s elbow.
Steve is taken back by the out burst but sighs holding Tony back from chasing after him “Tony listen to me you need to calm down.. Peter was being bullied at school he didn't start the fight and neither did Wade” Steve explains soothingly to Tony.
Nat walks into the living room the next morning to see the two boys cuddled close on the couch. She could've sworn that Peter had gone back upstairs last night…. “Wade, Peter it’s time to get up for school” she says shaking the boys.
“Yeah that sounds nice” Peter says finishing his food “ you guys need to go shopping for me anyways we can do that today too” he says hopping down from the chair.
“Tony…. It was the 30’s and 40’s we only had desks we had to carry everything” Steve sighs holding his arms open for Peter. “But I did get swirlies.”
Bruce picks Wade up and sets him on the counter “how old are you Wade?” he ask brushing off Peter so he could get to work.
His breathing starts to labor, his stamina is wavering. Jack felt his energy draining as he continues to run away from the Hydra base. Wade is gone so that means that he got out thank god. Their life was hell in that facility, Wade is Jack’s best friend and only friend since they were the only to kids there.
Wade body slams the boy knocking him to the ground about five feet away, he turns to the other boy and slams his fist into his face. Wade punches him until he is unconscious, the other boy gets up and attacks Wade. Peter jumps in the way only to be punched in the face by the other boy himself. Wade pulls Peter away and knocks the boy’s teeth in before teachers are rushing over.
“Shit we need to go now!” the man holding him said. The three of them rush towards where they had broken in from. The lights flicker on as Peter is thrown into a helicopter, all of the men had made it safely on, he knew he was in big trouble.
That would be about two years ago, so much has happened those two years; Natasha and Bruce got married, Clint lives in the vents with his dog Lucky, Thor and Jane had a daughter, him and Tony started dating, Loki has joined the team, Sam still isn't as fast as him. Steve can’t wait  until him and Tony get married.. If Tony even wants to get married that is.
“Is that little Peter?” he says looking at the boy and Steve “dude you got a nasty little handful right there that kid is satan spawn!”
“We did discipline, he has been punished accordingly and knows what he did was wrong. He shouldn't have hurt those boys  even if it was within good reason” Nat starts.
Peter leaves them to do their own thing as he pulls a chair in front of the stove, he finds the pans and all the stuff for scrambled eggs and toast. Peter cooks breakfast for the three of them as Steve comes out to the kitchen. Steve watches the little boy cook and takes notice of little burn marks that seem to be healing “My name is Peter Parker” he says to the large man.
“Of course you can bud” Tony say moving him out of his lap before getting up “come on Stebe’s waiting” he laughs softly helping Peter up.
“Oh Bucky, Mom, this is Weasel he’s was my only friend when we were at Hydra together” Wade introduces him to the adults that he’s with.
Just then the elevator opened for Natasha and Bruce “oh there you are Wade” Nat says happily “did you finish your homework for today?” she asks sitting down with her husband on the other side of Wade.
Peter knows that these people are good, he knows one hundred percent that they will take care of him. He still can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong, he feels off and not in a good way, if there is a good way of feeling off that is. Peter adapted a habit of dropping everything he’s doing when the sun starts going down to run to his room.
Steve couldn't blame the kid, from the looks of it the kid seemed to have a lot of injuries all over him. The feeling of anger fills Steve’s gut, this kid must have gone through hell. Tony doesn't seem to take notice of the boy's wounds and helps him take the food to the table. Steve sighs how could they do this? Were they ready to be married and have a son?
Letting out a sigh Steve makes his way to Peter’s room, he need to let that poor boy know that he is loved and wanted by both him and Tony. A short knock on the door is graced with silence as Steve waits for the okay to come in. The door opens with Peter holding his suitcase all packed and ready to go. The pain of knowing why it’s packed hits him harder than he thought possible.
Bruce sighed  patting the boy’s head “well Wade you’re just a boy and you are now my son apparently so that mean you are to never call yourself that ever again” he smiles washing off the dried blood “you’re never going to be hurt like this by anyone of us I promise”
“Oh honey I will always want you, you’re such a good kid” Nat says “what would make you think I wouldn't want you?”
Peter watches Steve fret over him, a feeling of relief washes over him knowing that Steve does really care. Tears start streaming down his face. “I'm Sorry Daddy” he cries “I thought you wouldn’t care” the tears keep coming.
Tony walks into Steve as he wasn't really paying attention “um Steve I think we got married” He says holding out his hand with the ring around his ring finger. Steve looks at the ring and looks at his own hand sure enough there is a ring there too.
The elevator opens just as Steve is getting on to go get Tony “Oh Steve! Perfect Peter in hurt and very bloody from being pushed to the ground today by those bullies” Wade says holding Peter’s arms up to show Steve.
“I have a husband and I’m not sending Peter anywhere” Steve’s hands clench before he cracks his knuckles “Are you one of those jack asses that used to beat my kid?” Steve glares daggers at the man.
She looks around the case only to not find the spider anywhere “oh it must have been taken back for more testing…” she says “sorry kids let’s move on”
Peter stays in his room that night packing all his basic needs from there, he grabs some snacks in a smaller bag. He leaves the two bags by his door before crawling into bed for the night. The yelling hasn't really stopped either Steve and Tony just don’t work together anymore and he knows it.
“Are you enrolled in any schools near by Peter?” Steve looks back at the six year old, he would be in about first grade now right?
Tonight feels different for Jack because Gramps isn't letting him do much like normal. Jack looks around the bar, the only person that seems out of place is a man with a metal arm. Gramps won’t let Jack anywhere near the guy so he sends his waitress’ over instead.
The love Steve felt for this kid he hardly knows is just too overwhelming. “Which ones do you want?” He asks the boy sitting on the display case
Wade and Peter sit outside the principal's office as  Natasha, Bruce, Steve, and Tony are all talking to him. Peter looks at Wade, he’s not hurt at all except for his knuckles. Wade looks at Peter and frowns “I’m sorry I let that happen to you” he looks down at his hands “I should’ve gone to pick you up from class…” he says softly.
“And why’s that Peter? Did you do something you’re not proud of?” Steve looks at Peter as he starts to unpack the bag.
“If this happens again in the future I get to kick your ass Stark” Nat says waving him off “yes I’ll forgive you this time now leave me alone.”
"Should I take that to mean you bring your work home with you?" To Tony's surprise, the doctor laughed.
She thought as she staggered out of bed and into the living room. When she reached the doorway, she froze, having noticed the strange Asian man asleep on her couch. She panicked for a second before realizing she still had all the clothes on that she had been wearing the night before and her guest was fully clothed as well. At least she could scratch "awkward breakfast with a one-night stand" off her list of potential worries.
go into in-patient rehab," Tony said. "I set that penalty myself, so there's no unlawful imprisonment there. Still, it's not something I
"You know what," Dante said as he stood up. "I don't have to deal with this crap. I'm going in the room!"
When he thought about it, it really made sense. This entire country was filled with religious zealots. All he had to do was tap into their feeble minds and use their false Gods and paper idols to spread the ideas of socialism. It was practically genius!
"You're forgetting I'm the one who did all the heavy lifting," Tony said. "Literally, I lifted the heavy things."
"And we all lived happily ever after, the end." The sarcasm was practically dripping from Stark's mouth. "You never tried to screw me over and we can wrap this up by joining hand and singing a round of 'Kumbaya.'" Natasha raised an eyebrow.
"You're still not fired," Pepper said. "But if you don't come in tomorrow, you will be. Understand?"
When he was certain no one was paying attention to what his hands were doing, Tony quickly stuck a device on the underside of one of the holographic displays. The device was small and hexagonal-shaped, so anyone who just gave the machine a passing glance would just think it was your average, everyday bolt and not question it. It would give Tony the backdoor he needed to break into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database.
Pepper pulled back and smiled at him, making Tony wonder what made him think that she would be mad in the first place. Sure, once he was better, she would probably give him a piece of her mind, but right now, he was vulnerable, and she wasn't one to kick someone while they were down. Pepper then moved on to Steve, whom she embraced as well. Tony noticed that she turned to whisper in Steve's ear, too. For a moment, Tony wondered what they were talking about before he dismissed it as none of his business.
"Yesterday morning," Romanoff repeated. "Like around the same time we told you Stark was missing, and you completely brushed us off?" Freeman huffed.
"They let you read a book about picking locks in prison!" Oswin exclaimed and laughed at the same time.
"A lot of reasons," Natasha said. "Theft prevention, identification purposes, cases like these where someone is missing, and you need to find them. If they have footage of Tony on the elevator, we can use that to figure out where he could have gone."
“Great.” Rocket rasps, angrily. “So as soon as he sees us, he’s gonna snap his fingers again and destroy those Stones. So maybe they’re warning us
“What were you doing inside the ship’s engine?” Rhodey asks, in his Colonel voice, and it’s easy to see how Lang’s shoulders hunch in a scared movement before he raises his eyes.
“Selvig seemed to have some level of consciousness when he built the portal, if he hadn’t he wouldn’t have added a failsafe. And he did. Besides, after Loki was taken, the portal fell into SHIELD custody. I’m sure they had files on it.”
they stir on him, the irrational, profound, knee-jerking reaction, all those feelings that make him feel like he’s about to expel everything he has inside him even if he hasn’t eaten in days.
Sometimes, like now, Sam sits with him in the silence, messing around with whatever he can get his hands on, a pen or an ashtray, or the piles of info they gather as they go in undercover missions, aiding in minor conflicts in every country they lay a foot on. They have quite a few of those, too.

Bruce exhales a little too forcibly, as if he’s frustrated with Tony’s insistence, but also knows he can’t discard the possibility because they can’t be
So it takes a while. It takes a while for Wanda have the opportunity to catch him when he’s coming back, after another long day out in the city, right when he’s coming up the stairs of the emergency exit. He thought he’d have a better chance not to alert anyone of his presence if he started coming and going through them, rather than the stairs right down the hall.
“It’s strong enough to hold one, but is it strong enough to hold all six of them? At once?” Bruce asks, his tone verging on desperation – of fear or of hope, Tony can’t say. There’s too much in his words and his eyes for him to safely tell the difference. Maybe it’s both.
“Scott.” Steve warns, uncaring if he’s interrupting. “You’ve never read them. You don’t know what kind of demands are in there. You can’t just sign it and hope for the best.”
what he imagined it would be. He gets defensive, but not nearly as much as he used to – what would be the point, if they’re both here, in bed, and they have been over and over again? Denial is only as effective as the strength it takes to keep yourself away.
it when Ross first called me for a chit-chat, alright? Bringing it later would have just…” Tony gestures vaguely, exhaling harshly. “It would have been difficult to explain.”
, of leaving civilians to fend for their own out of some disgusting sadistic amusement, it only proves more and more what Tony suspected for so many years, only to be proven right, over and over again, since 2016.
He’s surprised to see Bruce in the Jet, rattled and sleep mussed as he is. He wrings his hands together, knees bouncing anxiously where he sits already strapped down by two security belts, eyes wild with fear. He’s still in his pajamas too.
, as dysfunctional and dependent of their harmful habits as they are, but he can’t possibly – there is no place for
“I know.” Tony interrupts, softly. “And honey, I’m telling you it isn’t that. I promise. I know… I know what you’re worried about. And you have a point. You do. But that’s not it.”
“Isn’t that what he wanted?” Tony whispers to himself, madly. “Less people, more food? Why are people starving?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be, Agent Barton.” Vision replies, plainly, before turning to face them, Steve, Natasha, and Sam, with a perfectly polite look on his face. “Thank you for having me during this time, and I apologize if I was, at any moment, an inconvenience. But I promise you are safe, and if it’s ever needed, you can always count on me to help you, if you need one extra hand.”
“I have to look for Pepper and Rhodey, and Happy, and May Parker—” Tony rambles on, knowing he’s not being nearly as successful in distracting her as he should, but he can’t possibly muster the strength to fake this right now.
“Yeah. Artificial Intelligence.” Tony explains quietly, only realizing after that he might have needed to do that, considering how
panic, from the sounds, from whatever happened out there, from the very real, inescapable consequences of the shortcomings of Tony’s actions.
“I’m still thinking about it!” Scott tries to reassure him; But it’s useless, because he has already
, and it is slowly driving him insane, ebbing away all the fight and all the anger and all the drive, and leaving him… with this. Which is ridiculous, because how can someone be hollow in two different ways? How can the hole inside his chest ache in two distinct beats, two wavelengths, one that stings sharp and one that burns slow? And he can’t make it stop, because once again,

The words hit them like a slap in the face – so suddenly that both Bruce and Rhodey jump in their places, and Tony gasps loudly enough that it nearly drowns the soft
“As much as the Queen is willing to give. I just hope it’s a lot.” Tony gestures exasperatedly with his arms open, almost shrugging when he raises his shoulders defensively in such a quick move. “I know they’re not fans of outsiders, much less someone like me, but if we have Natasha and Rogers backing us up, this might go better than if it’s just two aliens, one of which is an overgrown Furby, and us begging for scraps through the phone.”
is almost too much, almost – but apparently, Steve’s capacity for compartmentalization and adaptability really goes very far. So he takes the mission, and he does it.
They turn, surprised, the small bubble of safety and familiarity they fortuitously built around themselves ripping apart suddenly, and it feels like a slap in the face to see that it’s
, because Tony is selfish and he never denied it, and he can’t deny the only thing keeping him going now is the memory of Peter Parker dying in his arms, because it
"And why not?" Thanos asked. "You are their King. Certainly, your people would do anything to have you back on the throne, safe and sound."
"Of course." He nodded, but his tone didn't sound agreeing. "Well, I'll leave you in peace, then. Enjoy the rest of your night gentlemen, ladies." Salinas then turned and left the table with Freeman following closely behind him. As soon as they were out of his line of sight, Tony pulled his cellphone out of his jacket pocket.
"I hit the emergency fire button on the elevator," Lara said. "I would have given you a warning if I had known it was going to be that loud."
"So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?" Bruce asked. "What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?"
It went on and on for several minutes after the doctor and nurses left and Tony was alone in the room. He felt in danger of going insane. Luckily, at that point Conroy's sandy-blonde head popped through the door.
She had been implanted into the Peoples Unity Church for a few months now. Both S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra had their reasons for putting her there. S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted her to monitor a potential threat. Hydra wanted her to take it out. The latter was made very clear with the text her Hydra handler sent her the night before.
"Headache," was the only symptom that he felt the need to complain about. Pepper filled in the rest for him.
"I don't know," he admitted. "Short of committing myself to the funny farm, I don't know." A pang of sympathy reverberated through Natasha's entire being.
"Of course, it is," Salinas said. "Especially since you just lost us our key to Avengers Tower." Freeman frowned.
The stream of people zig-zagged around the room. It was almost as if no one knew where they were going or what they were supposed to be doing. As a result, Lara ended up getting pushed closer to the middle of the room, where the Peoples Unity Church had gathered. No matter how much she tried to resist, she ended up getting pushed further and further until she was close enough to catch a glimpse of one of the people sitting in the circle and recognize him. How could she not? She was married to him for three years.
"Chef salad, no cheese, no dressing," Lara responded without even needing to think about it. She then walked past Pepper and began to pick up the boxes.
"Is he alright to see people?" Steve asked, trying not to sound desperate. You had to cut him some slack, though. When someone announces they're dying, people tend to assume the worst. Luckily for Steve, Pepper nodded.
"Okay," he said. "Sex is an entirely different conversation. One that I am more than willing to have, but still a different conversation."
The closed captions stated that there were reports that the building was being squatted in or being used as an improvised homeless center. That seemed to ring true as the most recent images seemed to depict boards partially or totally ripped off windows. Most of the windows were darkened, despite the removal of the boards, though, except for one. That one held within it a sign declaring the building
"You said 'one of,'" Tony said. "Not 'the greatest man you've ever known.' You always refer to him like that."
Right away, Steve saw a plume of smoke rising from the other side of the city. Where exactly, he couldn't be sure, but it had to be at least on the other side of Manhattan. He glanced over in the direction of the tower. Although from the angle he was at, Steve couldn't see the building itself, he also didn't see any smoke emanating from that direction, which he chose to take as a good sign.
"It's just something to think about," he said. "We can discuss this more when you're in a better state of mind. We'd be lucky to have you though, Tony. We could use someone like you."
"It's alright," Rhodey said. "Anytime you need me, I'll be there." Tony nodded as Rhodey pulled away.
Steve and Natasha confronted the people who sent the biological weapon to Avengers Tower and learn that while the virus is no longer contagious, anyone infected with it only has a 50/50 chance of survival.
"We'll see about that," he tapped the screen and brought the phone to his ear. "Hello?" A pause. "No, I am not." Another pause. "She doesn't want to talk to you." Pause. "Who am I? Well, I'm the guy who's going to snipe your ass if you try to call this number again." Dante must have said something that made Clint roll his eyes. "Your ex works for Iron Man, genius. She has dangerous friends. Call again and you're dead." He then hung up and handed the phone back to her. "If he keeps calling you, have Natasha answer the phone. She's a master at the art of death threats." Lara took the phone back, completely stunned.
"No," Natasha said. She stopped on one page and her eyes started to scan it. "I did do that, but not for the reasons you two apparently think I did."
"That's a little bit more than 'haven't managed to get in the shower yet,'" she said. "That's more like David Kirby on his deathbed. Are you feeling okay? Do you need to see someone?"
After that, the second page was filled out and Rhodey turned to the third. Tony was just relieved they were making headway. He wasn't sure how much time the therapist would allow them before he had to really start his session and it would probably be better to have the forums done before then.
Rhodey shut the door behind her, knowing that the biggest thing Tony needed right then was privacy. Sauntering over to the man's bedside, Rhodey noticed that Tony would not look up at him and that was not a good sign. Realizing he was going to have to be the one to break the ice, Rhodey took a deep breath and kept his tone of voice careful.
"Jess!" she called as she broke out into a sprint, coming towards her. "What happened? What's going on?"
"Promise me you'll go to the hospital if you feel any worse." Tony tried to argue, but Pepper cut him off. "Don't say it, Tony. I don't care if it causes a media circus, your health and safety are priority number one. We can figure out how to handle the fallout later. You seemed bad last night, and I know that if you're letting that show, you're actually ten times worse than you're letting on."
"She's the leading mind in her field," Hill said. "We were hoping her expertise would be useful in potentially identifying what the powder is made of."
The BOLO stated that Knežević had been last seen wearing "only a soiled pair of underwear" and as having the ability to "turn anything he touched to stone." So, when reports of several 911 calls complaining about an intoxicated Asian man clad in only his underwear throwing rocks at people and screaming at them to get off the beach started to come in from the Vista Del Mar area, it was pretty much an obvious give-away as to where the wanted man was located.
"I'm going to call Duane," Salinas said. "Why don't you lie back down and relax? Don't worry, I'll tell him to bring Steve." Tony gave him a hard-sidelong glare. Salinas acted like he didn't see it as he walked into the next room, shutting the door behind him.
"A few days." Tony winced at the way Steve's eyebrows raised in alarm. "It's mostly just been a headache, though. I haven't been throwing up the entire time." That didn't do anything to ease Steve's concern.
"Good." Tony sounded genuinely relieved to hear that. "Sorry. When you didn't call, I thought they might have done something." Steve felt a pang of guilt was over him.
"I always come prepared," Carol remarked. "It wasn't that hard, considering all the pamphlets your recruiters hand out."
"Too bad," Lara said. "We're going." They made it through the first set of double doors before Tony was able to break Lara's grip again.
"Yeah. He gave me his phone number when I met him the other day and told me to call him." Steve was fingering the slip of paper in his pants pocket as he said that.
"You got seven and a half hours of sleep last night," JARVIS reported. "Although that is thirty minutes shorter than the standard doctor's recommendation, it is still an adequate amount for you to function off of."
"How did you even get involved with a guy like that?" Almost as soon as the question left his mouth, Bruce wished he hadn't asked it. He hadn't considered how she might react and worried that he might have offended her. Instead, she gave a humorless laugh.
“Oh don’t worry about it kid Natasha was just telling me all about how everyone has been” Bucky says gesturing to Natasha “I’ve been really busy and she was telling me how a couple of our friends adopted a kid and got married it’s all super funny” he laughs.
“well I'm going to adopt him… he's mine now and I'll kill you for him if you don't let us leave” she says grinning.
The two men shot up, which was the worst idea ever, as the two doubled over holding their heads groaning in pain, Peter got his answer. He was going to be making breakfast just like at his foster home… just like all his other foster homes.
Steve and Tony sorted everything out before going over to Peter to say good bye “Hey bud we’re leaving” Tony says patting peter’s head.
“Peter how many other foster families have hurt you?” Steve sits down across from the boy digging into the food. The food is so good that Steve can't help but melt over it.
“How about after we get dressed we go to the park? Would you like that Peter?” Steve changes the subject hoping to ease the tension he caused.
“Whoa slow down kid it’s not going anywhere..” Gramps jokes “I guess you can stay here but you have to pull your weight around here; cook and clean for me” he says cutting his pancake.
Steve tells Wade to leave so that he could talk to Tony. Steve of course tries to reason with Tony only to be brushed off as Wade exits the scene. “I am Very Disappointed in you Peter! You can't just listen can you?!” he says harshly to the boy.
“I don't know… I don't know what’s wrong with me” Peter looks up pleadingly at Tony “I just don’t feel right”
Steve chuckles at the cute gesture that has Tony both fuming and blushing “have you been left somewhere before?” he asks holding tightly onto the boy’s hand.
“It’s nice to meet you too” Peter looks around the room for a minute “I’ll be right back don’t move” he says before leaving Wade’s site.
Peter walks into the kitchen dressed and ready to go “what’s with the water works?” he looks at his two dads.
Steve laughs and pulls Tony closer, he wraps his arm around the other's shoulders. Now with the love of his life secure under his arm Steve kisses his temple. “If you actually get me boxers with your face on them I will set them on fire.” Steve says a little more threatening than their normal banter.
Peter rushes over to the couch to sit next to Wade. Wade hands him a controller and sets up the game for two player. Peter tries to beat Wade with strategy while Wade is just mashing buttons. The game isn't too bad just a first shooter where they kill NPC’s or each other. Right it’s each other.
Steve smiles leaning his head on Tony’s “I think that is a wonderful idea but it’ll have to wait a little longer.”He says leaving Tony’s side to say goodbye to Thor, Jane, and Thena.
Tony Goes to Nat and Bruce’s floor first to apologize to them, giving Peter time to calm down and all. He knocks on the wall before calling out to them “Hey Nat.. I uh wanted to apologize to you guys..” he shouts softly.
The elevator opens again and Tony’s voice is heard before he is seen “Peter Where Are You?!” he yells.
“Right because I have to make sure my Captain America gets his daily exercise in freezing cold weather” Tony grumbles to himself.
Thena, Thor’s daughter is laughing at Tony’s pain “well thank you Thor I’ll get you some hammer cleaner” He jokes trying to mask the shear pain in his back.
“I see well you have nothing to worry about sweetheart your dad and I love you very much and we’ll always want you” She smiles at him.
Tony looks from Steve to Peter only to notice that Steve was definitely crying a little “oh Steve it’s okay!” Tony laughs at him.
Peter sits in class ignoring everyone around him, he doesn't answer when anyone tries to talk to him. He’s just absent as he sits in his class. He does all the work asked of him but while he’s doing all of this an aching fear rolls through his body. What if Steve and Tony get divorced and they both don’t want him anymore? He’ll have to go back into the system and he’ll lose Wade… Wade is one of the most important people in his life he can’t lose him with everyone else.
Thor was planning on having a ‘parting party’ before he left for Asgard, so Steve wanted to shower before heading down to the common area of the tower. Tony wanted to change into something a little more comfortable for home seeing as he wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the day. The two went the separate ways to the bathroom and the bedroom.
Detention isn't that bad, all he has to do is sit there and do math. Peter can’t help the giddy feeling he has when he does math, it makes him think of Tony. Tony makes him happy. When he thinks of Tony he thinks of Steve, who he adores. Steve is like a mom to him, well as much as Steve can be like a mom.
“Ms. Skye, anyways nice to meet you too! Your son is a genius!” She gasps out as she moves towards her desk “he has solved all of the math homework sheets that I have and that even exceed three more grade levels!”
Steve huffs, pushing away from Tony to pick up his favorite boy in the world “Oh I’m going to miss you all day!” he cries holding Peter tightly.
Jack gets up and helps Wade up “I’m going to get your drinks so I’ll be right back” he says smiling at the three.
Steve and Tony  leave, leaving the class to do as it pleases. The teacher introduces Peter to the class, kids seem to already want to be his friends. Gwen introduces herself to him after he sits back down and Mary Jane is on the other side of him.
“You're so lucky, I'm so happy for you Wade!” Jack says pulling away from him “I've got it good here too, Gramps is really good to me”
Wade could feels his heart break as he grabs the redheads hand “let's go mom” he says spite. Natasha picks up the two boys and goes heads towards her jet.
Steve couldn't be happier, the two most important people in his life are happy again and are bonding. Bonding, without him… They have gotten so used to doing things without Steve they totally forgot about him. Why have they forgotten him? He asks himself this all week.  It’s not like he’s forgettable! He’s not little like he used to be, he’s big now and he can basically do anything he puts his mind to. So why must his son and husband forget about his existence?
“Oh.. um yeah it’s what I would do whenever I was bored or trying to stay away from my foster parents…” Peter says as he starts up the second paper.
Peter is nervous about starting school and for good reason. Steve and Tony seem to have a little change of heart about their wonderful adopted son.
Peter takes Tony’s hand as he leads him to the shared bedroom of the two men. He’s so tired but he’s also super wide awake. Steve sits up when Tony brings in Peter “Tony did you get him?” he asks.
At recess he decides to run away from home and he’ll need Wade to come with him. He walks around looking for Wade. The feeling of a hand grabbing his shoulder he turns to see Wade smiling down at him “looking for someone?” he laughs.
Bruce looks between his wife and his ‘son’ “well Wade I’m Bruce it’s nice to meet you” he says holding out his hand. Wade looks at his hand before taking it.
Peter gets off the elevator to his floor only to hear fighting from his Dads’ room. He walks the way of their shared room.
“Why should I repeat myself when you didn't even bother to listen the first time!” Peter shouts running to his room and slamming the door.
“No actually  I sat down with my mom and dad and told them all that happened at school” Wade says smiling.
The drive to the mall feels as if it takes forever. Peter fidgets in the back seat  looking at how unsafe it is for himself to be in the back of a sports car without a car seat or. Steve takes notice of how uncomfortable Peter is from the passenger seat “don’t worry Peter We’ll get you a car seat… and a safer car” Steve give Tony a side glance.
“Steve I’m cold!!” Tony yells for him “I want to go home before Thor leaves” Tony just can’t wait to get the Asgardian out of his tower.
Jack helps out anyway he can, even if it’s just taking orders of the customers. He serves them appetizers and sodas but isn't allowed to touch any alcohol. Gramps teaches him how to mix drinks during the day so that someday he can take over the bar from Gramps.
“He don’t seem to have anything visibly wrong with him Pops” the female adds “he might just be tired or sick”
Wade jumps over the table faster than Jack could say something to Wade. Jack is on the floor in a constrictor like embrace “OHMYFUUCK WEASEL!!!” Wade is yelling with excitement.
A redhead walks into the bar with a kid around his age, he can’t really see who the kid is due to the dim lighting and the crowd.  The redhead and the kid make their way over to the man with the metal arm, the blonde boy starts to look really familiar to jack  so he has to go check out the kid.
Wade grasps onto the stuffed weasel “I’ll take this one then” he says putting it on his head “how do I look” he smiles.
“Why didn't you tell me you got hurt” Wade pulls up Peter’s sleeves to look at his elbows. “Oh yeah that’s bad… we gotta tell Steve.. He’s more reasonable anyways…” Wade laughs softly at his joke.
Peter runs to his room trying to avoid the only men in his life he looked up to. He wants nothing to do with them right now because they won't even listen to his side of the story all they care about is how bad “he” made them look. He puts a chair under the doorknob to keep them out of his room.
The alarm goes off and the room now has a flashing red light. Peter screams out of the sudden shock. Wade holds on to him to help calm him down “hey it’s okay it’s just the hideout is under attack we’re going to be fine” he says.
The stress of all of this taking it’s toll on the both of them, they finish the food and go to their shared room. Peter was just finishing up tying shoes “well I’ll be waiting in the living room” he says darting out the door that they had just come through. Steve lets out a sigh going over to his side of the drawer grabbing a change of clothes before heading to take a quick shower. Tony gets his clothes and changes into them in the room. He heads to the living room to sit with Peter.
“Your rooms are still in the same place.” Tony tells them, gesturing in the vague direction of the other figures in the room, only vaguely seeing them at the edge of his peripheral vision, ashamed of raising his head and looking at them in the eye. “You can all stay there for the night.”
He thinks of May Parker, who could have slapped him in the face, could have screamed, could have killed him, but didn’t. Who knew about her nephew being too strong, too eager, too… heroic, to stand still, and had loved him too much to make him quit. Had despaired. Had hoped he’d always come back.
"No problem," Steve said. "Now, what can I do to help?" Tony turned to look behind him at the disassembled mess of the bar.
He immediately looked at her. He tried to get up, but the two people sitting next to him refused to unlink their arms and thus kept him down. For one, Lara found herself grateful for the Peoples Unity Church. Dante gave her a sort of apologetic look.
"Unless the fact that armed gunmen have invaded my tower is purely coincidental, then yeah, I'm pretty sure." Hill's attempt to keep that very nasty curse under her breath failed.
"Any chance I had with you," Tony clarified. "First with almost kissing you last week, then with all this fighting… God, the fighting… I'm so sorry Steve. I didn't mean any of that stuff I said either. I was just so mad and hurt..."
"Okay, okay, okay," Tony said over Pepper. "One thing at a time! First, I'm fine. I'm not hurt, I'm not dying, and I'm not kidnapped. I'm at S.H.I.E.L.D. and I'm perfectly safe."
"Do you hear that, choit?" she asked the animal. "I'm your fairy godmother! How amazing is that! I'm going to make all of your dreams come true!" Thankfully, all of Lucky's dreams at that moment involved licking her face off, so it wasn't a hard promise to keep.
Remember that disclaimer at the beginning about less-than-appealing language and intense scenes? Yeah, I do too.
"No," Tony said sarcastically. "I feel amazing. The only way that could have gone better is if a barbershop quartet delivered the news."
Her day had been largely uninterrupted. She got a text at one point from Tony asking if she knew his social security number (which she did, although texting it back to him almost certainly meant that she was going to have to memorize a new one) but other than that, she got no texts or phone calls, which she was thankful for. All in all, it looked like she was going to have the peaceful day she'd been longing for weeks, and she could finally just let her guard down.
