"I told you," she said in that accented voice of hers, now pouring herself a cup of the mead she had offered to her guests, "I know everything. I know you distrust the Chancellor but you are wise enough to know that if anything
"Whatever," Tony said, realizing once again that he had to pee. "Ugh," he muttered and struggled to get up from where he sat on the couch, grumbling to himself and flailing pathetically as he did so.
He did take advantage of Steve being there more than usual. He made Steve clean off the highest shelves that he couldn't reach without a ladder (or the jet-boots, but Steve had been adamantly against that), he got him to rearrange the furniture in the living room to his newest desires and specifications, and, against what were Steve's basest wishes, he even got him to repaint the room next to theirs a light and cheery yellow because fuck blue.
Tony dropped his arm and smiled proudly at the picture their little infant made in her outfit, and Steve hesitated a moment then said, "But what if she doesn't want—"
Tony merely smiled back, soft and knowing. "You're not wrong," he murmured, pure love and affection in his voice before he sobered and added, "But boring? Steve Rogers? That smart- mouthed punk that's never followed an order in his life? The man that charges headlong into battle, has jumped out of airplanes, off of buildings, into the jaws of death, and pulled so many other crazy stunts that he's taken years off my life? That guy? Sometimes I wish that guy was a bit more boring. My nervous system could use the break."
But Tony was different. Both Stark and Tony had that way of talking about things so far beyond Steve's understanding it was embarrassing, but whereas Stark did all that he could to hide his frustration from Steve — and sometimes not even — and had a certain way of being just the slightest bit condescending toward him, Tony delighted in having to explain things in a way that Steve could understand, his eyes lighting up and warmth and humor washing over his face.
—" He nodded at the now-sleeping baby in his arms. "I've never— First time in my life since Ma died, I have a real family of my own, and I just— If anything happened to either one of you—"
Bruce and Rhodey approached slowly, almost as though they were afraid of spooking him, and Tony tore his gaze away from where the portal had been and looked between his two friends, neither of which was doing a very good job of hiding his complete confusion at what had just transpired. Rhodey was the first one to finally speak, glancing around the empty living area and saying, "Well, you don't see that every day."
feed her!" Tony snapped then immediately felt bad about his attitude and said, "I'm sorry. I don't know—"
She nodded silently and stood up. Over his whines, she took the container of gelato and the spoon away from him and said, "Brush your teeth and go to bed," but there was an element of coldness in her voice that hadn't been there a few moments before, and Tony knew it wasn't directed at him.
Esmeralda nodded to the infant in his arms. "And wouldn't you have come to regret your choice if you had?"
"Wait," Barnes said after a moment and shared a look with Wilson. "Did you— Did the gutter mouth that is Steve Rogers just tell someone else to watch his language?"
Wilson just laughed some more and shook his head before he turned to Steve. "Shit, I am so bummed I can't stick around to see how this plays out, but you know how that crew gets when they're hungry— Actually, no, you don't yet, do you?"
"OK!" she said and bounded off the bed. Tony made to straighten the covers out, but he figured he'd get it when he came back to return the books and pencils — Cap wasn't due back for, what, a week? — and so he led Olivia back over to the elevator and hit the button for the penthouse floor.
"Look, I get that it's confusing," he said and wrapped loose arms around Steve's shoulders, "and I get that it's frustrating that I'm being kind of elusive with some of my answers." He rested his chin atop Steve's shoulder and continued talking, his breath warm and his odd facial hair scratching at Steve's neck. "And trust me, if I could tell you everything and not have it change anything, I would. We got a glimpse at a world where we didn't tell each other things, and trust me, it sucked. It was
Steve swallowed and motioned to the radio…thing. "That's not 'White Christmas.' That's not the 'White Christmas' I know."
"And we're both still alive and in perfect health," Tony said and took a gulp of his black liquid god. The coffee went down OK, but that bacon. He glanced over to where Steve stood tending to the sizzling strips of pork product. Ugh.
He adjusted himself in the chair and tried to cover up the sudden stiffness plaguing his cock, eyes closed and face flushing with the heat of want. Sam was muttering something at Bucky, and Bucky was laughing and saying something about how this was the most excitement Steve had gotten in months, and even though he heard voices, and even though he was in public, all he could see with his eyes closed was Tony, wanton and willing, on his knees, gagged, collared, bound, and looking up at Steve with those gorgeous brown eyes of his, those inky black lashes, pupils blown wide with the desperate need to be taken and fucked into submission—
Tony looked around for a clock and finally found his phone sitting on the coffee table. He reached out to grab it, and he checked the time and saw it was only late morning. He sighed and set the phone down and said, "Fine. Can we do it tomorrow then? Bright and early tomorrow morning, and then
"Well, not exactly," Tony said and reached out to grab his coffee. He took a long, slow sip and swallowed before he added, "More this fits the pattern of crazy shit that keeps happening to us."
He picked up his mug of coffee and took a sip of it, humming in delight as the flavor hit his tongue and the liquid warmed his throat and chest as he swallowed it down.
She preened a little before she took exactly two bites then set it down and began to pull the cheese off again.
Tony just blinked at him. "Are you trying to say I'm covering up my real feelings for him?" "I'm trying to say that you keep telling yourself that you don't like the guy beyond wanting him to…" He made a gesture at Tony that he guessed he was supposed to take as wanting Cap to suck him off. "But clearly, it's a lot more than that."
“Why, you wanton little slut,” he purred and pushed the plug a little deeper. “You were planning this, weren’t you? You knew exactly what you were doing disobeying me.”
Steve kept his focus on Esmeralda a moment longer then turned his gaze to Tony, and Tony met those crystalline blue-green irises of his and willed him to keep his attention focused on him and not the screwball.
Tony shook his head and patted his arm. "Nothing, babe. I'll go get us some grub. You get the sprog."
to save me — he could have let me die — and why shouldn't he have? Yeah, I was a fucking genius, but was I really worth saving?"
found someone that wasn't going to ditch him when someone more interesting came along. Hell, even here, I barely saw the guy. Been spending more of my time with Tasha and Sam and Clint. Not gonna say it feels like you took my best pal away from me. I'm happy for him. But yeah, I do sometimes kind of feel like you took my best pal away from me."
Rhodey stared at him a moment before he shook his head, muttered something under his breath, then glanced over at Olivia. He did a double-take then inched his gaze from Olivia to Tony and said, "Uh…do you know she's wearing that?" as he pointed at the t-shirt.
He closed his eyes and took a breath, and Tony said, "Just the usual morning business or something more?"
Steve broke the kiss just as Bruce and Natasha hummed their agreement. He brushed the tip of his nose against Tony's, and Rhodey said, "Yeah, I wouldn't put money on that if I were you."
There was wetness on his face, but he wasn't sure if it was from the water or if it was from the second batch of tears he quietly let fall as he grabbed some shampoo and soaped his hair up. Yeah, it was stupid to cry about this. There were thousands of worse things to get upset about, and it wasn't like Steve was going to leave him for Barnes — or maybe not in that way he wasn't.
Now, it was entirely possible that Tony was biased, but the wriggly little newborn he'd decided to call Olivia Louise Stark-Rogers — alternate universes be damned — was definitely in the Top 5 cutest babies ever born. Maybe Top 3. Yeah, OK, sure, maybe she kind of still had that 'fresh from the womb' look, but he was certain she was definitely Top 3 'fresh from the womb.' She had chubby cheeks, pouty lips, and a stubborn chin, and he knew even without anyone else pointing it out that her warm brown eyes were a perfect match for his. She was alert and curious in ways he'd never expected of a newborn, turning her head at odd sounds — like DUM-E's curious beeps and whirs as he sat in his corner and raised his arm every so often to get a look at the strange little intruder — and calming her fussing whenever Tony talked to her. She made weird gurgling noises and shook tiny fists in the air whenever she was able to fight them free of the towel she was wrapped in, and even if — according to the literature (what? Yeah, OK, maybe he'd read more than he'd let on) — her eyesight left much to be desired, he was certain that she could see him clear as a bell as she stared up at him, a grumpy little look on her face as she seemingly tried to figure him out.
It was a simple and yet beautiful sketch of Tony — as he'd looked like until earlier that morning — sitting in the rocking chair in their bedroom, their infant daughter nursing at his breast. Tony's head in the drawing was tipped downward to look at the baby, long, dark waves cascading over his shoulders, one arm supporting the infant while a delicate hand was raised to take the baby's hand in his. It was an all-around stunning sketch, even if he noticed Steve had put extra effort into his eyes, lining them with dark and startling lashes.
"Agreed," Steve said quickly and fervently, tightening his arms around Tony just the slightest. Tony wasn't even sure if Steve realized he had done it, and he was reminded — for just a brief moment — of a slightly panicked voice calling out, "
Tony had shifted his gaze away from Steve as he talked, like he was unable to look at Steve while he listened to those words come out of his mouth, but his final words gave him pause, and suddenly Tony was looking at him, concern and confusion lining those tear-filled brown irises.
. I explained to them very calmly and rationally how stupid they were being with their insistence on us following bullshit 'traditions' that were outdated thirty years ago."
"You don't know that, Steve. It could happen, and if it does, I just want…" He scowled a little and folded his arms, averting his gaze. "I just…I want to be able to say I was married."
Barton reminded him they weren't at 'fucking Hogwarts.' Wilson perked up and asked what house everyone thought they'd be in if they were. Barnes just asked, "What the hell is a 'Hogwarts'?"
"No, see, that's where you're wrong. Because it does. It totally does. If you really don't want to be separated from your…"
If it hadn't been for Steve and his super soldier super sperm, he wouldn't have been in this situation to begin with, now would he?
He huffed out a breath and whined a little as he saw what looked to be nothing good except for condiments and, ugh,
"I don't think you can buy a presidential election, Tony. Besides, there isn't another one of those for a couple years."
"Maybe I like it?" Tony mused, practically tickled pink by the knowledge that Steve could hate something so innocuous as a
Infant care was exhausting. He was tired, he was sore, he was moody, and he felt like half the time he was wandering around the penthouse like a zombie. Steve didn't fare much better, though Steve was fortunate in that none of his responsibilities required him to produce anything from his own body for the continued health and welfare of their child. Oh, not that Olivia hadn't tried it with Steve. Once, when Steve wasn't thinking (and was also naked from the waist up), he picked up their crying child from her bassinette—
for himself. He was sure the book contained mostly pictures of his old friends and comrades from the war, anyway.
But Steve pressed forward and added, “Honestly, I think you’re the one that really keeps this bag of mixed nuts together. You gave us somewhere to live. You give us gadgets and gizmos. You make sure we have everything we could possibly want. I…don’t know if I — if anyone’s — said it enough, but…
He wasn't sure how long ago that had happened. It felt like hours; it was probably one at the most. Natasha and Barnes were still down there with him. Bruce evidently didn't think JARVIS and DUM-E were enough support for him. It was the only reason why he could figure Natasha, at the least, was down there with him and not in the madhouse where she could be of better use.
"Very," Thor replied, a tinge of sympathy coloring his voice. "The Goddess Esmeralda no longer lives among the nine realms. For all the well that she intends, she has made many an enemy that wishes to see her done harm. It appears her actions have finally caught up to her. She was, as I understand it, no match for the being that finally put an end to her ministrations." He was silent a moment before he added, more somberly, "I am deeply sorry, my friends, for what she has done. I should not wish to defend her in light of these circumstances, but you should know that she had only the best of intentions for you both. You are, as she saw it, that oldest and most celebrated of life essences, and this is, as she believed, the last piece needed to solidify that bond. And while it is true that there are many among the realms that practice the arts Midgardians refer to as 'magic,' the Goddess's spells are of an entirely different persuasion and cannot be undone by anyone but her."
"OK," he replied and went over to his side of the bed and sat down. "JARVIS, put the lights down," he said, and without a word, darkness fell over the room.
"I don't think they like each other like that," Steve said as he sat down on a chair at the island and settled Olivia onto his lap. "I think Sam is seeing Sharon, and Buck's pretty sweet on Nat."
He climbed back up the couple flights then set her down and went back over to the door, and he said, "OK, you can go back to watching TV now," but after she scurried through the door, she made a beeline for the steps that led up to the bedroom.
"No," Steve said, "it's a lot more believable." He swung the shield out and cracked a Hydra agent in the skull, sending the poor bastard bleeding to the ground, and Tony turned and fired a repulsor at another one that had snuck out of the bush.
Tony attempted to button his jeans again but hissed when it was still just too tight for comfort. “Yeah, well, maybe the moment’s passed.”
He glanced up and met Steve's gaze, brown locking into blue, and he watched as Steve's eyes skirted all over his face, a small smile playing at his lips, and he shifted his hand from Tony's wrist to take Tony's hand in his.
"You're going to wish you hadn't said that," she mused, glancing to him briefly before she went back to looking at a tablet.
Steve continued to give him the soft, boyish smile. "I suppose I should file that information away for future reference."
Bucky nodded some more, and then he let out a breath and shrugged a little. "I mean, not that it really matters. We're not her godparents, so..."
Tony stuck the straw in his shake then reached out and grabbed one of Steve's fries. Steve glared at him and pointedly looked at Tony's own serving of crinkle cuts, but honestly, food always tasted better when it belonged to someone else, and it tasted especially good when it belonged to Steve.
Tony made sure to order all of Steve's favorites for when he came back, and he tucked them all into a bag and attached a note reading,
"He's a hundred," Tony muttered in reply. "Don't tell him I told you, but he also carries around a handkerchief. It's what people did back in his day. I guarantee you he's got one shoved into an inside pocket of his tux jacket."
Tony rolled his eyes and saw there was still a little bit left on Rhodey's plate. "Yeah?" he said and shoved his empty plate over beside Rhodey's then used his fork to pull what was left on Rhodey's plate onto his own. He pulled his plate back in front of him, and he cut into what he'd snagged for himself then shoved a bite in his mouth and said around it, "You have any
Before Tony could say anything, Steve got up from the bed, and he went around to the other side to get better leverage, and he reached down and scooped him up into his arms.
Tony didn't remember exactly what happened after that, but he was pretty sure Steve did have to carry him back upstairs and put him to bed.
"Are you embarrassing yourself, Steve? Do you need to hold your jacket in front of you? Or maybe you need me to walk in front of you?"
Thor got up and made to scoop Tony up, and he cried out and threw a leg and then an arm out to block him and squawked a bit about feeling violated or threatened or something, and Thor stood back in slight bemusement while Bruce just stared at him pointedly and said, "Would you go to bed?"
"Yeah, sure you did," Steve said and cuddled Tony in his arms. "Not fooling anyone, honey, least of all me."
"I forgot how well you know me," he said and squeaked a little as Steve reached up and, Tony's spend on his tongue, crushed their mouths together, forcing his tongue into Tony's mouth and forcing Tony to taste himself more than he could ever hope to get off his fingertip.
Barnes snorted out a laugh that became a chortle that turned into a guffaw that ended as a downright belly laugh complete with him clutching his gut and losing his balance as he fell into a chair. Tony just stared at him, perplexed, as he watched Barnes lose himself in the laughter, and finally, only when the tears were streaming down his face, did he get a hold of himself and sober enough to wipe the tears away and say, "Jesus Christ, Steve. Never change."
"How?" Bruce asked, face pinched in confusion. He looked to Steve and said a sincere, "No offense," then turned his attention back to Tony and said, "But
Now, a child from the future that desired nothing but love and affection from him didn't seem so bad. OK, there was still the little matter of who 'Daddy' was, and that…that was a little harder to compute. He actually had been full of shit when he'd been talking to Bruce before. He didn't actually think the Cap was that way. Cap was too perfect, too righteous, too all-American to be anything but a God-fearing heterosexual from the '40s. So, maybe this
"Sorry," he muttered then added, "just…Steve was always kind of a…sickly…sort. He used to talk about wanting kids, but he was the sort of fella… I just wasn't sure he'd actually ever be able to have 'em, you know what I mean?"
"'member? Daddy said you get him shirts that're too small, and you said nuh uh, you don't that's Daddy's size, then Daddy said you two are the same size and then he put on your Dark Moon shirt to show you and made it all big." She giggled a little and fell down onto the bed. "It was too small on him. You said it looked like another skin. And then you jumped on him and fell on the floor and then we
him. Tony squealed in laughter and begged Steve to stop, smacking him as he did so, and Steve finally did let up, sitting back as he panted, his arousal practically straining through his boxer briefs.
, "—it's pretty clear our Cap doesn't swing that way." He sighed out a breath and rubbed a hand over his face. "Of course, that's going to make it a hell of a lot harder to get her back where she belongs."
Something kind of funny hit him in the chest — hard — something that felt a lot like cold dread. He tried to suck in a breath but found he couldn't — not a good one — that funny thing sitting on his chest almost like a weight. Barton muttered something under his breath, and Steve let out the breath he'd taken, and Tony swallowed and looked between Steve and Thor and said, "What? Why? Don't I just go back after this—" he motioned to his belly, "—goes away?"
"This is Cap's baby," he continued. "Now, you don't think every Hydra fiefdom would love to get their hands on Captain America's baby? And trust me, there's a
"Thank you," he said then went around the island and stood beside Thor. "You too, big guy. Don't think you get out of this."
Also, Loki's scepter was still missing and their trail of leads on that had been cold for some time. All-in-all, not the 'merriest' of Christmases he'd ever celebrated, but not really the worst. The first Christmas after his ma had died was probably the hardest one for him, even if Bucky's family had been kind enough to take him in for the holiday. And the first Christmas after Buck had, well, disappeared for the time being was softened by what he still couldn't explain but had come to accept as a glimpse at his future.
Oh, he damned well knew there was a difference, but he was playing deliberately obtuse because, to be perfectly honest,
Tony sighed out a breath and dropped his arms. "Not— That sounds so permanent. I don't want— Not retire, but... A break," he said. "I need— I lost my parents, Steve. I know how that... I can't do that to her. I'm sorry. I know... I know we make a good team, I know I make comments about co-leading the group, but... I don't think I can do it anymore— Not to the extent that I did. I don't... I don't want to retire. I don't want to permanently give it up, but I think... I really think we need to maybe agree that we don't go out in the field at the same time anymore. You go? I'll stay here. The most I'll do is fly remotely like I did back when I was knocked up—"
He then weaved Tony around the other tables of guests, sidestepping the servers as they made their way out to the corridor and eventually to the elevator bank. Not one other soul was waiting for an elevator when they arrived, and Steve reached out and hit the 'up' button then stood back a step to wait, and Tony glanced up at him and said, "What is this?"
. Because it had happened once before. Because this was his life now. Being turned into a woman and being impregnated by his ninety-five-year-old fiancé — who was completely disgusted by him now — was his life.
"I'm seeing a distinct lack of rabbit food here," he said and began to dig into the serving dishes. Ravioli and pasta carbonara and chicken parmesan.
"You know, I'm a grown man. I can totally take care of myself," he said but didn't pull his arm away and instead let Natasha lead him away from the bed and over to the door.
"I'll just assume your idiocy is due to you being straight-as-an-arrow. But you have to at least objectively be able to admit that Cap is physically very appealing. His disposition could use a little work. I mean, it's a shame that such a pretty package has to have such a cold and impersonal and bitter inside. I almost want to say that he doesn't
He went back into the bedroom and looked around. He didn't see any suitcases lying about, so he went over to the dresser and pulled open a couple drawers until he found one filled with socks and underwear. It wasn't too hard to figure out which belonged to him and which to Tony — God, just the fact that… He shook his head and ignored the pile of colorful briefs and instead grabbed a dark gray pair of those snug boxers he'd awoken to find himself dressed in. He grabbed a t-shirt and found another set of those pajama pants with the strange faces on them and went into the bathroom to get himself cleaned up.
Tony bit his lip and pushed his head back into the pillow. Fine. Whatever. He didn't care. This totally counted as Steve fucking him.
"Yeah," he said and then said his 'goodbyes' before he ended the conversation, pressing the little red button on the screen and watching as Pepper's smiling face blinked away.
He tried to wrench away from Steve, but Steve wouldn't let him, instead guiding him back to the shower and helping him in.
"Yeah, that's what I thought." He stabbed the gelato again and shoved another spoonful in his mouth.
Bruce had a friend, who had a friend, who had a mother, who had a sister, who had been a photographer of some note back in the '60s. Bruce's friend had a portrait gallery, and though the photog herself was long gone, the sister had in storage dozens upon dozens of plates and negatives and prints from her work, and as it was fifty years since the start of the so-called 'British Invasion,' Bruce's friend wanted to do a retrospective of icons from the '60s music scene and had hit the sister up for prints to showcase.
He tilted his head back, bearing his neck, as he fell over the precipice, one hand clutching tight to the back of Steve's head while the other held fast to the one hand on his belly. He moaned, downright moaned like the wanton and debauched creature he was, and breathed out Steve's name like a prayer, and he let out a little cry as Steve came inside of him, the warmth flooding him, and against his better wishes—
"Yeah, well, more so than me," he said good-naturedly. "We live in an era where two fellas can get married now if they want to. I don't think anyone could ever have conceived of that back when Ma was still alive. I remember one of the last things she said to me was, '
"Principle of the thing," Steve said and picked the bottle up. Tony couldn't even attempt to hide the look of disgust that came over his face, and Steve gave him a lopsided smile. "I have sucked you off, eaten you out, and rimmed you, and
"Yeah. That I'm the long-lost Stark sister that mysteriously disappeared in 1978 or whenever we make it." He waved his hand in the air. "Details aren't important yet."
"But I don't have the right scars I'm supposed to have, and there's the little matter of being, you know, an entirely different
For only a brief second did Tony feel any remorse that he'd given up the search for Captain America. Only a second because how the hell was he supposed to know he was still alive? The man had crashed a plane into an unknown location in 1945. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together would have figured the man had probably died on impact.
"Yeah, a couple times. Pretty good. Can't complain. Nothing beats the city. Pizza, though?" He scoffed. "Don't even think of trying to get a decent slice in this town."
But that was a worry for another day. It was Christmas Eve, and unless Hydra or AIM or some megalomaniac with a massive chip on his shoulder and some time to kill decided to spoil the holiday, Steve had nowhere else to be but at home, lying on the floor with his daughter, his heart melting every single time she pushed herself up onto her elbows and giggled in delight.
Because much as he loved Steve, and much as he trusted Steve, Steve was not always right. No matter how much he thought he was.
"And deep down you know I'm right," he added. "Honey, I know. I get it, and I know, but you can't just expect everything to go back to the way things were before… Not immediately. Not yet. Not right now. It's going to take time. You know how you had to figure some things out when you came out of the ice? Imagine how he feels. Your life passed you by. His life… His life hasn't entirely been in the service of all that's good and just like yours has — and that's through no fault of his own."
. Slowly spread me wide. Make me beg for your cock. Spread me open wide and make me beg for it. Rub me. Crane your fingers and hit me in the right place and get me so hard and desperate. Tell me I can't come unless I come on your fingers. Make me cry and beg you to put your dick inside me, the corset so tight on me that I can barely breathe from—
Tony thought about this for a moment. "Yeah," he finally said. "I mean, if I'd absolutely had to, I would have figured something out. Plus, I mean, JARVIS would have been there to feed me information, so it's not like I would have been
Quarters. OK, he could cut it into quarters. If she'd wanted bite-sized pieces, 'Papa' was getting his ass up here and doing it himself.
"Tony, relax," Natasha said from where she sat on the couch. "You're going to wear yourself out before you even get started."
But to that end, he still didn't know how he felt about himself. He was sure he would always and forever on some level identify as a man, but he'd come to accept this new womanly side of him — the figure and the physiology and the like. He didn't feel like he acted any differently in this form, though he supposed he'd developed a few habits he'd remembered from how his mother used to carry herself as well as taken to heart the things that society said a woman should or shouldn't do. He sat with his knees together (well, except for when he'd been lugging around a thirty-five- pound watermelon on his gut), legs either crossed or closed, he prettied himself up with makeup and actually spent more than five minutes on his hair, he'd consciously worked to modulate his voice so it wouldn't go so screechy when he got excited, he'd even found himself cowed into not acting as aggressive with anyone because it wasn't 'ladylike.' He shaved and plucked and waxed his moustache (oh, but it was perfectly fine to have a moustache when he was a
Bruce frowned at him, and he folded his arms and leaned against the bar and said, "Tony, I'm not doubting that you think you feel this way—"
"Nah," he said with a shake of his head. "Which is why he's not allowed to give the battle reports on the Hulk to Bruce anymore. He's still the one that writes them up because he thinks anything that goes on the record should be as factual as possible—
But there was no way that little slip of powder blue paper stuck to his fridge was anything other than a signal from Bruce to the others that Tony and Steve had no more reason to argue over whether it should be 'Sarah Maria' or 'Maria Sarah.' Bruce, in what he probably thought was a 'subtle' way, had informed that gang of idiots of what he knew the sex of the gestating Stark- Rogers to-be, probably hoping Steve and Tony were too caught up in their own issues to notice.
He reached out like he was going to pinch the area of Wilson's neck and shoulder, and Wilson jumped back and cried, "How do you know
"Fine," Barton said with a shrug. "But now I'm thinking you two are a couple of sexist pricks." He motioned at Natasha and said, "How do you feel about that, huh? Your own Captain thinks he's too good to have a daughter — that his sperm is too good to carry any inferior X chromosomes."
She pursed her lips at him, eyes narrowed as she folded her arms. "I don't know. As your kind says, did you use protection?"
Tony Stark — his tender, gentle, caring, and funny Tony that looked at him like no one else ever had. It was a dream, and a pipe dream at that, something never to come to pass, something to be left to the wastebin of history like everything else from what he had once considered his life.
," she muttered, ensuring that the 'V' of the bodice was even and his ample cleavage was centered. She even taped the straps, which were gathered at the shoulder with a thin strap of satin, and Tony suddenly felt more like a show piece than he ever had in his life, especially when the assistant sewed some kind of rhinestone-encrusted scroll-like, flowery accent piece to the band just beneath and to the side of his left breast.
"Oh, no! No, you don't. Not that look. Goddamn it!" He turned back to the road. "You know what that look does to me!"
By the time they got back down to the ballroom, the speeches were winding down (Tony had made sure to take as much time as possible upstairs in the suite so that they didn't have to hear the speeches, plus, he'd needed to test the bed out to make sure it would be adequate for sleeping… and possibly other stuff…that night). Dessert was being served, and Tony sat down without complaint and helped himself to the delectable chocolate offering sitting in front of him. There was also a small cup of black coffee sitting to the right of the plate, and Tony pounced before anyone could tell him 'no,' putting the cup to his lips and taking as much of a gulp of the steaming hot beverage as he could muster — no sugar, no cream, just delicious, black, savory…
He didn't, but he didn't really feel like dragging this conversation out any longer. Steve would do his best to try to convince Tony of how he felt, but Tony would know that the entire time he was with Tony he was thinking about getting back to hanging out with
help acclimate Barnes back into the real world through…pretty nasty Wii bowling competitions, it looked like, so after sequestering himself in his lab, and with his machines and his stupid 'bots there to give him comfort, he called up Pepper, and the moment she picked up the phone, he said, "I think I've officially worn out my welcome with everyone."
"It's bad luck," Steve said, a bottle of beer in-hand as Tony, baby tucked into the crook of one arm, used his free hand to tear into the box Wilson had brought along with him, tossing the cutesy and pastel wrapping paper onto the floor and figuring
He grabbed some cleaner and wiped the vinyl of the table down, and he found a clean sheet in one of the storage cabinets and draped it over. He was about to grab a pillow off the couch so he'd have something to lay against when one hell of a pain hit him, and he sucked in a breath and squeezed his eyes shut, bracing his hands against the table as he leaned forward some and tried to wait out the sensation. He dug his fingernails into the vinyl and grit his teeth and began to count backwards from a hundred just for something to take his mind off the horrible, horrible feeling wracking his body, and when it was over, the only thing he could be bothered to mutter was a quiet, "
"No kidding," Steve murmured, Olivia cradled in his arms. "You know, they did that back in my day, too."
He stepped back, and Tony opened his eyes as Steve put his hands to either side of his face and cupped it gently.
She just put her hands back on him and began to rub again. "Because sometimes I think you're stronger than all of us. You're stubborn, too, but you're strong as well."
Steve just looked up from where he had lain the overnight bag on the bed and was unzipping it. "What?" he asked, clearly having not been inside Tony's head for that train of thought.
" Happy said from the phone, and while Rhodey turned away and Hill bit her lips to keep from laughing, Tony went over to him and slapped his arm and said, "Figure of speech, big fella. Steve's just afraid I'm going to back out." He stopped cold and pulled back a little. "Why? Is he backing out? Is there someone in there with him to make sure he doesn't run away?"
"Yeah," Steve murmured and brushed the wet hair out of his eyes. "Come on. Let's finish getting you cleaned off. You're getting soap all over."
anything, either, which didn't help matters. Oh, he felt the nausea and the exhaustion and the tenderness of his breasts (which were, at current, what he understood to be a generous C-cup), but he didn't actually
"It just is. I didn't, uh, I didn't really get a chance to talk to Steve much. I mean, I guess I did but—"
He sat up a moment, unsure of where he was, and he almost thought for a second that that hadn't been a dream until he realized that no, it was. Of course it was. He was in the bedroom of the former SHIELD safe house, and Steve—
Tony winced. "My god, and you're still alive," he murmured more to himself than to Steve. "Yeah, well, not tonight. Tonight, I'm driving you home."
Steve raised an eyebrow at him and said, "I…really don't remember when 'Captain America' was born, but Steve Rogers was born on July fourth, and all Steve Rogers needs is a nice, relaxing evening with his best fella and maybe a dinner."
OK, maybe not the first. He was sure there were others that had looked Steve's way before he, for whatever reason, settled for Tony. And he did. Settle. How could it be anything but? He was Captain America, and Tony, as he'd been assured many times over the years, was not.
This time, Natasha was on his right and Barnes on his left. The sensation of Barnes's metal arm holding his leg back was…different, maybe even a little uncomfortable, and Barnes himself really seemed like he was trying to look anywhere but, well, where the magic was happening. He
Tony snorted a laugh. "Yeah, laugh it up, Brooklyn Boy. I'm surprised you're not still shocked at the fact that there's a whole world out there beyond the East River."
But the doctor just smiled at him and said, "Truth be told, I wish more of the couples I saw come in here were like you."
Like a glutton for punishment, he sat there and once more read through the files SHIELD — or was it Agent…Coulson? Was that his name? Anyway, the files some agent had given him to look over — things to catch up on, things to file away for future reference. Though he knew the documents by heart, he pored yet again through the official records for his men — his Commandos — hoping for something to change with this latest scan-through. But the word 'Deceased' continued to stare back at him on every single file, mocking him as though to say,
It wasn't long after that that they were chowing down on appetizers and salads, Tony shoving food down his gullet because he was hungrier than he thought he'd ever been, and when the actual entrée arrived, he wolfed that down in record time as well — though he blamed that more on the pathetically small portion rather than his own insatiable appetite.
Steve was rather nonplussed by it as well. As first the leader of the Commandos during the war and now the leader of the Avengers, Steve was accustomed to ghastly sights. Plus, he grew up in the nascent days of modern medicine. Watching an actual childbirth was probably no more horrifying a sight than what he'd undergone as a kid in the naïve but well-intentioned attempt to cure him of what ailed him.
The man grumbled and groaned, and suddenly, the weight was lifting off his chest as the man pushed himself to a sitting position. He turned to Steve, smiling drowsily, and Steve tilted his head in thought. The black undershirt was an odd style choice, but there was something familiar about the man… Something about that dark hair and that odd facial thing he had going on and those brown eyes…
He snorted in derision. "Like that did any good. No, Brucie, it wasn't just the magic kid appearing out of the blue. She was just the last straw, the proverbial one that broke the camel's back. In this case, the camel's back is Pepper's unconditional love for me—"
know what's going on. He knows what's going on, he's going to want to stay, and he's going to drive you crazy."
Thor swallowed and frowned, his eyes offering his gravest sympathies. "My friends, I have just received word. The Goddess Esmeralda—"
He waited one long, painful moment before Steve said, "All right," and Tony grinned and jumped up to kiss him, but he forgot that he was still controlling the armor, and instead, Iron Man grabbed Steve by the face and smacked his facial slit against Steve's mouth, and Steve made a slightly strangled sound before he pulled back and rubbed his nose and said, "Maybe you might want to watch how you handle that thing."
in him, and that was why he was doing stupid shit like actually looking up at the ceiling to talk to JARVIS.
"No," Cap said, but Tony could tell his thoughts were still somewhere else, "just, uh, thinking about a dream I had once. I think it was a dream, anyway. It's not anything… Um… You mind if I ask you a question?"
He clicked off the call and shook his head before he tossed his phone onto the table and looked at Tony. "Are they our teammates, or are they our children?"
Tony hummed a little, pleased by Steve's reaction, and as Steve stood there and worked to get his brain back online, Tony grabbed the towel from the bed and went into the bathroom to hang it up to dry. He turned and caught sight of himself in the mirror for the first time since he'd let the others play dress-up with him, and he smiled at the picture that stared back at him, agreeing with Natasha's assessment that the designer might have been a bitch, but she was damned good at her job. Although…
Tony grumbled and said, "You'd have to ask the birdbrain. He thinks you spoil me with affection or attention or validation or something. I don't know. He's got everyone else convinced that I'm spoiled, too. I remember he said one time, 'If I let the Cap fuck me, think he'd let me get away with whatever I wanted, too?' Obviously, you weren't there at the time."
much of an asshole. I'd never wish that on anyone. However, I do wish you'd give some of Bruce's herbal teas a try—"
in person, but Pepper had made it to his wedding after all. And Happy, too, but Pepper...Pepper had made it, and that's what mattered.
"What's got his panties in a bunch this morning?" Natasha asked as she came into the kitchen. Wilson and Barnes followed behind, and Tony groaned and then pointed at Steve. "This is all your fault."
"Merry Christmas, you spoiled, little monster," the man said and leaned in to kiss her cheek, and she giggled again. "Got these two wrapped around your tiny, little finger— Yeah, don't get all coy with me, I'm onto you. I know your game."
why no one's panicking, and that's why Steve's been seen with this woman around town. Because it's not just some woman; it's Tony Stark. Honestly, the media's at fault for this whole thing."
"Yeah," Tony said with a shrug as he set up all the tools he figured he would need, "but not for the reason you're thinking. JARVIS is always monitoring what we do."
Then he got wind that they'd found the fish food formerly known as Captain America, and not only had they found him, they'd found him
"OK," Doctor Ganford said as she hung up the phone. "Serena is going to take you over to the exam room now. We'll go over more of your medical history and what to expect over there. I just wanted to take this opportunity to meet with you and discuss your rather…unique situation. In here, you can be 'Tony.' Out there, you'll be only 'Natasha.' How does that sound?"
now. But that doesn't mean I don't acknowledge that they're both very attractive — if terrifying — women."
"Good," Steve said and then began to work at a slow, gentle thrust, the plug in his ass hitting his walls with each and every hit, doubling the desperate, yearning need thrumming through him. "Oh, don't be like that," he said at Tony's despairing whine, his fingers trailing over Tony's abdomen, sending quivers of want down his spine and straight to his clit that was desperate for attention. "You want to know why? Because you like this. Because you like the control I have over you. Because you like that only I can do this to you. And you know what? I like that, too. Only I get to do this. Only I get to see this. This is for me and only for me. Because you're mine. You're my Antonia Natasha. No one else gets you like this, not now or ever. This is mine. This is only for me. You're like this only for me. You give yourself this way only to me. I've already marked you. This, right here?"
She continued to grin, and she did that little coy and bashful maneuver that little kids liked to do when they were teasing or lying to adults, and she said, "You know who," like Tony was supposed to know what she was fucking talking about.
no Natasha Carbonell. That was a name I made up when we were trying to keep this, as someone of my husband's generation might say, on the Q.T."
Tony just shrugged. "Maybe Howard was different back then? Maybe he was actually nice? Maybe Cap's more of an asshole than history's made him out to be? Who knows."
He sat up, alerted to the sensation, and as soon as he put a hand to his belly, Steve was in his space, putting his hand on top of Tony's and asking, "What's wrong?"
are just… There are no words good enough for what you are. You're my best friend, my greatest challenge, and the person I want to spend every lifetime with. I don't think I would have adjusted half as well to the future if it wasn't for you helping to guide me along the way. I… I love you, Tony. You know I love you, right?"
That's a lie because that would imply I am merely OK with what we do. I am not just 'OK' with it. I like it. I love it. I have maybe gotten to know my hand very well while I replay it the next morning in the shower. And I don't just mean in my other body. I mean this one, too. I… I want to do it, Steve. I want to play like this. I want you to do what you do best."
here—" he jerked a thumb at Barton, "—deserves the title of 'superhero,' so I'm not sure, much as I adore him, I would use him to bolster my claim that people actually ask for War Machine stories."
Tony thought about this a moment then said, "You know, here I thought I was doing such a good job pulling you into the twenty-first century, but you're doing everything you possibly can to pull me back to Five Points in the nineteenth."
He vomited until he gagged, and he flushed the toilet and rinsed his mouth out and wiped away the tears that had streamed down his cheeks. No, he wasn't crying again. The force of the retching just did it to him.
"If it makes you feel any better, she thinks the sun rises and sets with you, and future you seems to have a good relationship with her."
," she corrected, not even bothering to hide her annoyance at him for cutting off her rant again, "doesn't seem the least bit concerned by your mysterious disappearance. He's been spotted on dates with some woman—"
Cap frowned at him a bit, like he was perplexed. "Thanks?" he said, confused. "I mean your…your parents. They, uh…"
"What? I really mean it. None of this sappy 'I wub wu' bullshit. I really mean it when I say please, for the love of god, go to sleep already."
"Because," he said and flipped a few switches, "I…might be a bit more traditional than I want to admit."
But Doctor Ganford just smiled at what she probably perceived as their idiocy and said, "Don't worry. It's very human. And very perfect. Would you like to see?"
He tilted his head forward a little, his blue gaze locked into Tony's brown, and squeezed his hands ever so gently. Tony, however, just huffed out a breath.
Tony glanced up and met her gaze, and a slight shiver went down his spine at the way she seemed to be able to bore right into him and read his deepest and darkest thoughts. He'd thought only Steve could do that.
Steve had thought he'd cleaned up the place well enough, but Tony had methodically gone through and picked up every scrap of paper then arranged the gifts under the tree in the least cluttered way possible. When Steve had told him to leave it — who was Tony trying to impress? — Tony just said, "Yeah, well, not all of us enjoy living in our own filth. And I thought you hail from that generation that's all about pride and keeping up appearances?"
"To a degree, yes," Thor replied with a nod. "And it is why we must succeed in our quest to seek out and return the scepter to its rightful guard. It contains in it a power — a concentration of energy so strong and so destructive that it could very well destroy not only Midgard but all of the nine realms."
"You are more important to me than anybody has ever been in my life," Steve murmured into his neck. "I know you think you're in some kind of competition with Bucky over my attention, but you're not. Buck's my oldest pal, yeah, and I owe him a debt I don't think I can ever repay, but
"But we love him," he added and kissed her head again, breathing in that soft baby scent, his entire being warming at the thought of his family.
Tony just hummed, his mouth a flat line, as he stared down at Steve. "I think you're holding out on me, but I know if you are, you'll confess your sins eventually, so I'm not going to press you on it. Anyway, I thought you were dead, you didn't even know you were supposed to be dead, being that I was
"Yeah, I mean, it's good for strength training and all," Wilson said, "but I don't know. Think the laser tag arena would be better for tactics and strategy and agility training."
She just nodded and smiled a little, and she squeezed his hand again as the elevator opened, and Steve came into the room carrying a large cardboard shipping box. He stopped short when he saw Pepper and Tony sitting on the couch, and he glanced at Tony and said, "Uh…does she…?"
"It's really amazing, Buck," Steve said as he merged onto the interstate. "You just— You have to see it for yourself. You'll never believe it. It's like something we could only have dreamt about."
He scowled a bit as Steve leaned in and wrapped big, strong arms around him, pulling him close and cradling him against his chest. Tony sighed and went with it, resting his head on Steve's shoulder and putting his arms around Steve's ridiculously narrow waist.
"Yes," he said without even thinking, and Tony paused a moment before glancing back up at him again.
"It's not nothing. You had just given birth. You were supposed to be relaxing." He then shot a pointed look in his direction, tipping his head forward like he was looking over a pair of non- existent glasses and added, "Nat said she gave JARVIS explicit instructions for you to remain in the penthouse and you completely disregarded them."
to us to have the 'right' girl's name. Stop making it sound like we both secretly hope it's a girl. We don't. We want a boy. It's a boy."
Tony scoffed and went over to the fridge to grab one of the small bottles of juice Rhodey had bought earlier. He hit the door with his elbow to close it and shook the bottle a little as he went back over to the island.
He nodded his understanding, and he took another bite of his bagel and looked over the mess of paper and presents. "What a waste," he muttered around a mouthful of food.
"Tony, we shouldn't do it this way," Steve murmured, but Tony ignored him and said, "Yeah," to the man's question.
Cap was silent a moment, and Tony listened in for background noise so he could identify what sort of locale the Cap was calling from, but he couldn't hear anything.
The car arrived in the lobby, and they pushed on with about half-a-dozen other people that had crowded behind them in the time they had been waiting, and Steve kindly held the door for everyone then hit the button on the panel for each of the floors requested, which, of course, just meant it took them longer to get to their floor, but whatever, wasn't like he wanted to go to this stupid thing, anyway. Bruce and JARVIS were both totally capable of handling everything for him no matter what Bruce said.
Well, weirdly, there was something empowering about it. He'd never felt so in-tune with his body in his whole life — not this one nor his other one. He'd never trusted his body so much, never felt that his body knew much more than his mind ever did as he did at that moment. Bruce might have been telling him to push, encouraging him and telling him what a good job he was doing, but Bruce wasn't the one he was listening to. It was himself, it was his body, it was something so innate and ancient it was something that was just understood.
But Tony just ignored him and leaned in closer to show him something. "I mean, it does everything. Phone calls. Texts. Internet. All the best apps. Photos. Oh, and firewalls?" He scoffed. "No match for this baby. Can break through them—" he snapped his fingers, "—like that."
As battles went, it wasn't all that noteworthy. Go in, get the bad guys, get whatever tech they might have, hand them over to the proper authorities, and hop back on the plane for late-night pizza.
Tony reached up and rubbed a hand over his face. "This isn't happening. This can't be happening." He dropped his hand back down to the bed and glared at each face hovering above him. "I think we can all agree, upon pain of death,
"It's the principle of the thing," Natasha said, and Tony bit into his slice of toast. "Captain America isn't marrying Iron Man—"
He sat up as the others turned on him, Thor loosening his grasp on Steve, Esmeralda smiling in delight while the other three gawked at him in shock, surprise, and a little bit of horror. Tony sighed and looked down at himself, which, going by the breasts and the long, dark hair that fell in his face as he looked down, was maybe not the right pronoun to use.
Steve just smiled at him, knowing full-well that he was full of shit. "DUM-E is a devious little thing that's always looking for a way to cut the wire — like someone else I know."
"So, you just left Steve up there with the others?" Natasha asked and set Tony's one foot aside then motioned for the other one.
He inhaled a deep breath through his nose then exhaled it with a bit of a sigh. "They're just… things I've noticed. Things that happened when I was asleep. Other people got to watch these changes. I didn't. I just…woke up one day and had to accept that they'd happened."
"Hey, whoa!" he said and put his hands on either of her small shoulders. "No, I'm fine, baby. I just…" He made a hesitant face and scratched the back of his head. "I
His feet were beginning to ache — fucking stilettos — but he still pulled himself back up to the upper level and stumbled back over to the table, grimacing and trying to keep as much pressure off the most sensitive part of his feet as possible. He sat down in his chair in a huff and went to reach for his soda, only realizing at the last second that the one he'd grabbed had come from the guy he'd just chased off.
He dropped his hands from Tony's breasts and moved down to cup his ass, and he traced his fingers lightly over the sensitive flesh and said, "Are you ready for the final round?"
But Rhodey just stared at him, and Tony shrugged and said, "All right. Topic for another time. So, is it a woman? Are you ditching me for a woman?"
Which, you know, might have been feasible in some way if their ranks were not literally made up of half-a-dozen members, and two of those members were out of commission for the time being. It wasn't that they didn't want to help, it was just tough to do when they were already stretched thin to begin with.
"Oh, for heaven's sake," she muttered and rolled her eyes. "Did you not listen to a word I said in either of our past meetings?"
it. I'm not saying you have to believe it, but maybe you should just consider that that wasn't as much of an alternate universe life as you might have originally thought."
"Because," he said and pulled up the hem of his shirt. "You're like, I don't know…" He unhooked the cup of his bra, and no sooner had he done that than did Olivia latch on and began to nurse from him. "This sort of perfect…"
He woke up in the night, Steve asleep beside him, and maybe because he'd slept so much during the day yesterday, but he was unable to fall back to sleep with ease. He tossed and turned a bit and tried not to be too obvious about it so that he wouldn't wake Steve up, and if he did at any point, Steve was a good sport at pretending not to be bothered in the least.
Tony sighed again, and he moved to sit on the floor beside Steve, torn wrapping paper crinkling beneath him.
"Would serve that bastard right," Tony said and nestled closer just as another wave of nausea hit him. He made a face at it and said, "But yeah, maybe not right now?"
seriously. He'd watched the way he'd thumbed his nose at every Congressional hearing he'd been forced to attend — like it was beneath him and he had better things to do with his time. One in particular stood out to him — the way he'd stared right into the camera and said something about how he could always be counted on to pleasure himself. And then there were the…other… videos he'd found. He wasn't sure he was supposed to. The fella at SHIELD that had given him the computer and the info had also given him explicit details on exactly which 'sites' were approved for visiting. Unsurprisingly, those didn't net him that much information — he had a feeling they were 'approved' in that they would tell him only what SHIELD wanted him to hear — and so he'd snuck off to the library and accessed the so-called 'world wide web' from the anonymity of a guest account (and with the aid of a very nice librarian), reading up on everything he could click on.
"Then change the access code," Steve said and pulled his hand back to close up the folder. He glanced up at Hill and said, "Let me think about these. Anyone asks, tell them we're reviewing the requests. Don't say anything about making any decisions."
He shrugged and looked down at the baby in his arms. "Maybe," he said, almost like he was embarrassed to say the words. Yeah, just like he'd
Tony ripped the magazine out of his hands before he could finish his thought, and he turned to Tony, mouth flat, as Tony folded up the magazine and tossed it back onto the table ahead of them.
He glanced over at Tony, who was still snoring, his mouth hung open, and he tried to figure how much longer Tony would probably be there and if he could just leave the baby in her crib for Tony to find. But then Tony would just grumble at him about that, and he wasn't really looking to put him in a bad mood on Christmas, of all days, and so he exhaled a breath and steeled himself and sat up, setting the phone back on the table before he pushed the covers off his legs and swung them over the side of the bed. He scratched his abdomen with one hand and the back of his head with the other, yawning and stretching his back just the slightest until it popped, and he grunted and groaned a little and sat there, shoulders slumped, as he looked out at the dim, dreary sight Manhattan made at this moment.
"What? With what?" Tony asked, and Steve caught the way his back arched just the slightest like he was putting on a defensive move. "We're not giving into temper tantrums. We're not giving her everything she wants no questions asked. It's Christmas, Steve!"
You— You want me to— I'm sorry, are you trying to tell me I'm getting too emotional over the fact that the
He sat down at the computer and logged in, and he tried to read the specs that were on the screen for the Mark…XVI? Is that what it was? But the screen was blurry, and he kept blinking and trying to read what was there, but the blinking wasn't doing much to help him. It was only when he felt wetness on his cheeks that he realized what was happening to him, and he reached up and brushed the stray, stubborn tears away and said, "Not one word about this to anyone, J. Understand?"
He turned and met the gaze of what he took to be a middle-aged stock broker with a wife out in Jersey.
Tony nodded. "Can do. My super soldier fiancé is due back sometime tomorrow, and as much fun as it is sciencing with you, Brucie, it's a lot more fun having 'me' time with my gorgeous super stud."
until Rhodey got the time to introduce them to whoever it was he claimed to have been having some thing with over the course of the past year or so. Well, if this...whoever-it- was was even real and was not a) a figment of his imagination or b) inflatable. But he had a whole host of stories about Rhodey that he could not wait to embarrass him with.
"Oh," he said and tried to hide his disappointment. It sounded kind of interesting, actually, and he kind of wanted to see what it really looked like. "So, there's more of us?"
Barton almost earned himself demerits for that, Steve being none too pleased with the tag and assuming Barton's was teasing him about the #LadyLiberty thing. Which it totally was, Tony was pretty sure, because it was so fucking
Bruce nodded his understanding and said, "Uh, maybe we should let Tony alone a little while and let him relax and get some sleep. It's been a long twenty-four-hours for all of us, but probably more so for him."
He hadn't expected Steve to change his mind about that, but he was hoping it wouldn't sit so sourly in his stomach to hear it again.
But Steve just stared at him. "Are you trying to say I'm too much of a stick-in-the-mud, or is that a really bad attempt at an age joke in that Prohibition came in
He got up, only realizing now that someone had put him to bed (he was certain he'd fallen asleep on the couch), and bleary-eyed, he stumbled out of the bedroom and down the steps to the living area. The lights were off in the lounge, but light shone from the kitchen, and either his damned houseguests were helping themselves to his food again or Steve was home.
He squeezed and kneaded the breasts then slid firm, possessive hands down Tony's torso, settling them over his belly. He kissed from one side of Tony's neck to the other and growled into his other ear, "I love that this is mine," as he caressed his belly. "I love that I did this to you. I love that when people see you, they know I did that to you."
"What gets me is that your brother is only an ass in, like, half of these stories — not even," Tony said, a water goblet in his hand.
He winked at Tony then stepped on, and Tony stood there and stared at the elevator as the doors closed.
Maybe, through it all, maybe this was the little girl he'd fallen in love with all those years ago? Maybe she had always been his after all?
He pulled the pancake mix out of the cupboard and read over the list of ingredients. "I have to fix that one," he said breezily. "It broke, so we have to use this one today."
She made a hand motion at him, the sort that said 'wait a minute!' then said above the engines to Tony, "When did it start?"
Steve pulled out with a thoroughly debauched squelch, and as Tony gasped and pressed his forehead into his bound hands, he felt Steve kiss his shoulder again and say, "This was the second time. One more, and then it's your turn. Then you can come. Still OK, Antonia?"
"Are you that disinterested in me that you don't care if I trust you or not? That this can go either way for you and you won't care?"
He felt Steve's gaze on him, and he glanced over and met his eyes, and Steve smiled some and said, "OK. We'll be the Stark-Rogers…es. OK, now the plural sounds absolutely
Tony tried not to laugh. "OK, interesting way of saying that. Look, let me just say that the person that did this is…no longer around. There's no chance of this happening to anyone else." He pointed to someone else in the front row. "You."
He grabbed the plate and set it down in front of Olivia, and she happily grabbed the slice of toast and bit into it then said, with a mouthful of toasted bread, "Papa, I need a fork."
"Meaning? I mean, I know what you mean by immortality for Tony, but mortality — me. What would you do to me?"
Steve was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that he could openly talk about something like this and not have to worry about looking over his shoulder for a cop or an MP or someone that could report him to some higher authority.
that Cap had taken up with this mystery brunette. Unfortunately, most of them were just relieved that Steve had dropped the devil incarnate that was Tony Stark. Some of them weren't happy with Steve taking up with Tony
"I'm sorry, honey. Maybe in the morning I'll try to buy the rights to it and have it destroyed. Would that make you happy?"
Steve just laughed, and he tugged Tony closer and then put his hand around the back of Tony's neck to bring their mouths together, and before he kissed him, he murmured exactly one word against Tony's lips.
He licked his lips to get the rest of the jelly and powder and finished the bite and said, "Hey, where the hell do you think you're going?"
He pushed himself to his feet and went over to the dresser to pull out a pair of pajama pants — evidently, Tony was the only one that wanted to see him walking around in a pair of tight skivvies — and he pulled them on then went over to the bathroom and took a leak. He glanced at himself in the mirror before he left the room, and he put a hand to his face and rubbed his fingers under his chin to see how badly he needed a shave. Eh, not too bad. Tony had a thing about beard burn, but he could probably get away without shaving for at least half the day.
"Yeah, you just stormed on through, laid one smack on me, and then disappeared right back where you'd come from. I mean, then again, if I
Tony took the breadstick out of his mouth. "Not without you thinking about me going down on you, anyway."
The guy just grinned at him and pushed even closer. If Tony was being honest, the guy was practically dry-humping his hip.
body evidently hadn't seen any surgeries, so he left that blank as well then moved onto the section about 'family history,' which was pretty easy. Just his parents, both of whom were deceased through no
thing, really. Spooning with Steve was nice and fun and half the time their usual mode of sleeping, but it also left them very little room to stretch out if the occasion called for it, and with Steve being on the taller side, and Tony being
"Then he was a fucking moron," Barnes said and stood up. He reached out how discarded t-shirt and tugged it over his head.
Tony hummed and snuggled a little closer to Steve. "What's that corny-ass thing you told me back when this whole thing started? Oh, right! Together."
"Did he recognize you?" Natasha asked, and Tony grimaced a bit and hedged a little before he said, "
Tony shook his head. "No," he replied earnestly. "Your heart was in the right place. Your head was in your ass, but your heart was in the right place."
"What?" he asked, flat and deadpan, though it masked the spike of inner panic that warned him that Tony was setting him up for a major pratfall.
Tony stared at Steve for a few seconds before he smiled, and he shook his head a little then put a hand up to Steve's face and cupped his cheek.
Steve just grinned and nodded at him. "Oh," he said, a little proud and a little mischievous, "there's cake."
"That's not— What? No, that's— That's not the only reason we're getting married, all right? We're engaged. We've been engaged. We're just…speeding up the process a little bit. And, look, isn't that a little stupid and old-fashioned and superstitious not to let us spend the night with each other?"
Tony just stared at him and chewed on his lip a little in thought — totally not tying to be a come- on at all; seriously — before he nodded his head once and set the stylus down on the table.
Steve just squeezed his hand a little tighter. "It's not going to kill him. He's not dying," he said, but Bruce just frowned at him.
"Well," she said as the doors opened automatically and she led him onto the car. "I don't think anyone's taking it personally."
Tony closed his eyes, the lab going silent enough to hear a pin drop, and he felt some well of emotion build up inside of him until he couldn't take it any longer. He choked out a few gasps before he realized what was happening, and as the tears streamed down his face, he glanced up at the ceiling and said, "J, you tell anyone about this, and I'm dismantling you and donating you to DeVry."
"You really think that idiot wanted to break up with you? Really? Let me tell you, the night you broke up with him, when you fucked off to god-knows-where, three o'clock in the morning, your little boyfriend shows up at the doorstep, crying, begging us to tell him what he did wrong."
The little girl frowned and said, "Vision, are you in the ceiling, too? Papa, why's Vision in the ceiling?"
"What I think everyone's trying to say," Hill said quietly and contemplatively, "is that for as much as we tease you about being cheesy or sweet or gross with each other, we all kind of rely on you to be that way now because it's something stable and something we can count on even when things aren't looking so great in the outside world."
Tony did as told, and he felt Steve reach down and push his underwear aside to insert a finger in him. He gasped in a slight breath, and Steve hummed a little in displeasure and said, "Nowhere near how wet I want you."
Tony shot a glance at the other side of the road. "Wait," he said and tried to look beyond the leaves and the flecks of sunlight to see if there was anything that wasn't supposed to be there, "did you hear something?"
He snagged a cookie from the container on the coffee table and crunched on it then reached down and began to ball up piles of torn paper and ribbons. He wasn't joking when he said this whole thing was a waste. Christmas wrapping paper was expensive. His mother had never wrapped any of his presents in anything but old newspapers. Tony must not have made his fortune himself if he was keen to just throw his money around like that. Probably came from a father or a grandfather — which was odd because Steve couldn't imagine an 'old money' type like that being, well, openly homosexual. Weren't they expected to marry into another wealthy family and produce the next generation of heirs?
Which Tony, in one of his more brilliant moments at three a.m. when he couldn't sleep because he couldn’t get comfortable and somehow Steve had stolen the pillow that he liked to shove in between his legs, decided to right, trolling the internet and posting on one of the most popular Avengers fan forums that he — or rather 'Spare Parts Man' — was looking for actual vintage photographs related to Steve Rogers 'for a research project for his senior thesis.' Unsurprisingly, he got several hits on it, though none seemed actually legit except for a reply from 'JediEngineer770,' which a series of back-and-forth messages and emails only confirmed, and they eventually set up a meet-and-exchange for the end of June. Tony could only hope his pregnancy brain wasn't clouding his judgment for something like this, especially since there was something else also weighing on his mind:
Steve laughed and sat back, leaving the tablet alone. "You're just jealous that someone came up with the idea before you did."
Tony sat down on the couch, and Steve followed, making sure to sit a proper distance away from him. Tony raised an eyebrow at this and, noting the amount of space between them, said, "I'm going to assume it's because you don't know who I am and not because you think I have cooties or something."
But Tony shook his head and said, "No, babe, in this context, it's totally 'fucking.' They don't see it as 'making love,' like you do; they see it as down and dirty fucking, and they think I'm the one that corrupted you into doing it to begin with."
"So, there's no escaping it?" Tony asked, waving his mug around in the air as though motioning to emphasize his question.
Steve took the bottle out of Tony's hand, and he set it on the table then pulled Olivia's hand out of her mouth.
You know, maybe Steve's insistence on Tony not going out much was a blessing in disguise? He motioned to Steve. "Steve won't let me out of the building."
He crouched down and pulled her small hands away from whatever box she was going for, and he moved everything that was piled on top of it before he was able to get it out, but by that time, Olivia had found the toy telephone again and had plopped down with it, the receiver in her mouth as she turned the dial with her fingers. Tony stared at her a moment then looked up to glare at Steve.
He was about to go for the stairs when some noise from the room across the hall caught his ear, and certain he wasn't about to be caught by the odd fellow in the other room, he tiptoed over and pushed the already-ajar door open just a fraction more. He didn't know what he'd expected, but he hadn't expected what looked to be a child's nursery. He pushed the door more fully open and took in the sight of soft pastel colors and stuffed animals and white-painted furniture. There was a crib against one wall and a very young child standing inside it, hands with a tight grip on the railing.
"Oh, I can't wait to see what this chair comes out looking like," Rhodey said, staring at Steve and Thor in disbelief. He turned to Tony and added, "Are you really going to let those two assemble something?"
They met each other's gazes, and their eyes did a dance of wonder and confusion before, together, they looked down at the large swell of Tony's abdomen.
Tony then just shook his head, and he leaned over and put a hand to Steve's chest (more to steady himself than anything) and pressed a kiss to his forehead and said, "You're worrying over nothing, old man. Your oldest pal still likes you. Maybe he's just trying to give us some space, you know, 'cause we're married and should be wanting to spend every waking moment with each other."
"Papa's no fun," Steve told Olivia and began to open the box for her. She stood beside him and tried to help, and he pulled the small toy from the box and set it down for her to test out. Olivia plopped down and began to play with it, picking up the receiver and tugging on the dial and chirping with delight when it made noise, and Steve frowned and looked at the small, red lead attached to the front of it.
"It's a kids' movie," he explained to Barnes then turned to Wilson. "An alternate-universe kid of mine. Showed up a couple of years ago. Drove me nuts. Didn't stay long."
. Seven years ago, Stevie. Seven years. The grand total of all your relationships since then have amounted to—" He looked at Sam. "What'd we figure?"
JARVIS didn't say anything in response, but the light in the lab shifted, darkening, as a grid of lines came over Tony's form, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Jesus, J. Let me get—" and quickly moved to divest himself of the under armor he was still wearing.
And apparently all the city clerks on duty that day, who Hill later informed him had taken sworn oaths and signed non-disclosure agreements to prevent any of what had happened that day from leaking to the media. Tony really wasn't sure he trusted that, but whatever, nothing he could do about it now.
As he put the sandwich together, he heard Olivia quietly singing some song to herself — a really old one, he thought, maybe even from the forties, which...yeah, would probably make sense if the Cap was really her 'Daddy' — and when he turned around to hand her sandwich over, he saw that she was drawing patterns on the tabletop with her index finger, seemingly lost in her own little world. He set the sandwich down, and she stopped what she was doing and eyed it a moment before she said in a small voice, "Papa cuts it into little triangles."
He snorted a short laugh this time. "Of course you do." He blinked and focused on her again. "Probably know everything that's going to happen to us."
Steve took it and pocketed it then made his way back over to Tony, and like the gentleman that he was, he held out his arm for Tony to take. Tony, grasping his own small clutch in his hand, took his arm and said a suspicious, "What did you do?"
"Maybe there is something to this soul mate or bondmate business," she mused after a moment. "I never thought there was a perfect recipe for a relationship. Some work out; some don't. But I think you two have it down to a science more than most. You almost…balance each other. You bring out the best in each other. Of course, you can also bring out the worst in each other. But you two…need each other. You're at your best together. You…"
Then, to show Tony precisely what he meant, he traced his fingertips lightly up and down the swell. Tony let out a high-pitched keen and tipped his head back.
Tony let out another laugh. "Yeah, definitely 'no' on that one. Look, honey, it's not anything you need to worry about right now. She's ours, and that's all there is to it."
Cap swallowed and nodded. "Yeah," he said. "My dad, uh, died in the war. Never met him. Really only knew what my ma told me about. Ma, well…"
"I don't know about that," Hill said as she came back into the room, tablet in-hand. "The hospitals are down to the wire." She looked up from her tablet and met Tony's gaze. "They know we have power here. They want to know if they could transfer some of their patients here."
"You," the guy said, dipping his head to murmur the words close to his ear, "are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen come into this place. And I've been coming here a long time."
. I'm not— I spent forty-three years of my life as a man, OK? This doesn't— And I'm not saying— I'm saying that I'm absolutely horrified that I'm being forced to endure something that was not of my choosing and might very well kill me before everything is said and done.
"Uh, you know we're married, right? JARVIS had your name put on the accounts, like, the very next day."
An honest-to-god sob that began deep in his chest and came sputtering out in a pathetic blubber, and even through his tears, he could see Steve's absolutely wrecked and horrified expression, and he watched as Steve panicked and fought to get away from him, muttering, "I'm sorry," over and over again.
"I'm fine. Honest. It's just…a lot to take in, you know? A lot to— I feel like a fucking yo-yo being yanked around all over the place."
OK, so Tony had had some…issues…with Captain America over the years — namely, that Howard was more concerned with finding his dead friend than he was parenting his own kid. And whenever Tony fucked up, it was always—
The song finally got to the guitar solo part once Twelfth Avenue had turned into more of a limited-access highway, and Tony went to turn the volume down, but Steve said, "No, wait!" and pressed the button on the steering wheel to turn the volume up a little louder. Tony sat back, gobsmacked.
Natasha shrugged, and Tony looked between her and Pepper and said, "Seriously, how did you even get in?"
"Not gonna come back — I mean, it's not going to come back as anything we don't want to see," he said, setting the parameters.
He went to reach for Barnes's arm, but Barnes turned on him, and a flash of murder crossed his eyes before it vanished, and he pulled his arm away from Tony's reach.
"No, I think he did," Wilson said and folded his arms. "If I were you, man, I'd be insulted. He's your
Oh, but Tony had. Going back to his teenaged fantasies of that sexy, built Captain America that decorated his wall. The one that seemed to have muscles in all the right places, broad shoulders and a narrow waist. The one that ate Nazis for breakfast. How could he not? He'd figured out early on — not that he would ever have the guts to tell Howard — that a man did it for him just as well as a woman did, and he wasn't blind. Captain America was a hot piece of ass.
Tony knew about that, too? — and Tony's eyes went wide as he muttered a quiet, "Holy shit," then reached down to the table and grabbed his cellphone. He held it up in front of his face, and as Steve continued to glare at Tony, a flash went off at him, and Tony said, "Grumpy cat personified," before he pressed his thumbs against the shiny surface of the instrument.
"I don't want to be your doctor, Tony!" he cried, spreading his arms out wide in some misguided belief that it would drive his point home harder. "I do
But Steve just shook his head. "No," he said and picked his head up to look at Tony. "He's right. I—"
Tony turned to him but continued walking. "You…aren't of the naïve belief that women don't masturbate, are you?"
Bucky grinned at him. "Then I guess Stevie'll have to make like the ninety-year-old that we all know he really is and write another letter to our rep demanding they not privatize it." He smacked Steve's arm. "Seems to have worked so far."
Tony just patted his shoulder. "Mmm…let me think about it, yeah? A year ago, I would have said yes, have your wicked way with me however you want, but now it…"
"Uh," he said and lifted his arms like he didn't want to touch it — which he didn't — and he looked to Bruce for help, but Bruce just went from looking at the kid to Tony to the kid to back to Tony again.
Steve still had that look on his face like he wasn't sure he'd done well. "So…it's OK?" he asked again.
"If you say I'm getting emotional over nothing, J, I'll dismantle you and give you to the government to put back together!"
were she and the Captain together, and was that the Captain's baby? Was she just a surrogate for them? Was this the product of an affair? Was she trying to exploit him for something? Just what were her aims?
"Love you, too, sour patch," Tony said, and Jim just turned and clapped Steve on the shoulder and said, "Merry Christmas."
He wasn't actually sure if Tony trailed off or if that was the end of his thought. He just watched as Tony moved about the bathroom, hanging the cloth up to dry, grabbing Steve's old, wet clothes and tossing them into the clothes hamper. Steve, dry now, grabbed his clothes off the sink and stepped into them, and though he logically knew he was embarrassed by what Tony had seen him doing, at the same time, he wasn't as embarrassed as he thought he should have been.
"I never said they didn't," Steve replied and stole one of the freshly-baked cookies. He bit into it and added through the bite, "I just said it was expensive and unnecessary."
She grumbled and folded her arms in a pout, and Rhodey eyed her a moment, head tilted in thought, before he said, "Does she… She looks familiar when she does that, but I can't figure out who—"
Tony motioned over himself — at his belly and his breasts and his general south-of-the-border area — and said, "You know I didn't have any of this a year ago, right?"
"Oh," he said with a slight nod. "OK, well, how 'bout we go there just for a little while, huh? I'll uh—"
He was going to have to see about getting her new clothes in the morning. "There we go. Hey, do you need to brush your teeth?"
"Uh, yeah," Tony said, stepping out of the shadows. Both Barnes and the Hydra agent looked over to him. "I think in order to be a 'traitor,' you have to have been a willing participant in the organization to begin with. Don't think brainwashing counts."
. He wasn't quite sure if the voice was similar or not. He thought maybe it was, but then again, he was trying to remember back
." He grimaced and looked around and, with one hand covered in lube, he grabbed a pillow from the end of the bed and said, "Work with me, here. I've only got one hand at the moment."
So, he decided to go search Brucie out to see what he was up to because, if nothing else, Bruce would provide a distraction of some kind for him. Working on his own projects was not exactly easy-going — it was difficult to concentrate, hence the half-finished projects he'd set aside in favor of countless hands of computer solitaire — but it was pretty easy to tell Bruce what he was doing wrong with
He put his hand to his abdomen as a wave of nausea overcame him, and he grimaced and swallowed and added, "I mean, aside from the wanting to throw up all the time."
In all honesty, Tony hadn't meant for it to sound so…tawdry. He hadn't meant for it to come out like a come-on. And any hope that it had gone over what he had heretofore taken for the naïve Captain's head went straight out the window as he watched the good Captain run his gaze over the length of Tony's body then fist his hands at his sides and swallow. He probably didn't even realize he'd done these things.
Tony sighed and snuggled down into where he lay on the couch — comfortably until Steve had opened his big, fat gob. "Yeah, but I'd rather not have to deal with that shit if I can help it. Look, I don't know why I even
It was a ridiculously extravagant affair, and the part of him that still remembered cold nights spent with an empty stomach was almost embarrassed by it. Yes, it was nice that Tony apparently had money, but it was also a little disconcerting.
He had just moved her to the other breast when Steve woke up, yawning and murmuring a sleepy 'good morning' to him, and Tony watched as Steve looked over to his vacated side of the bed, frowned, and said, "Why's your side all wet?"
He sat back, blinking, unable to fully process what he'd just been told. Tony… This man was Howard's
Tony bit his lips a moment to keep from smiling too hard, and when he'd gained control of himself, said, "Hmm? No, I don't. What did I say?"
"Fuck that," he muttered. "You're marrying Tony Stark or you're not getting married at all." He scrolled down the page some more and read it over. Neither one of them had been married before, so that section didn't pertain to them, but then he got to the name change section and said, "Uh… what about names?"
Tony adjusted the baby in his arms, cradling her a little closer, if that was possible. God, he never wanted to let her go. "He wanted a boy."
Steve scowled right on back to her, and she waved her hands at him like she was trying to clear the air and said, "This isn't getting us anywhere."
"Not his lapdog," Steve said, hand poised to open the door to the workshop. He turned back to Tony and threw him a sardonic little smile that probably would have gone over the heads of anyone that didn't realize what a little shit Captain America could really be.
"Yes, I swallowed, you sick son-of-a-bitch!" He made a couple of disgusted — and over-the-top — gagging sounds and said, "The fuck did you do that for?"
He’d meant it to be blasé, but Steve just smiled at him fondly, affectionately, and said, “Yeah, you are.”
Hill put a hand to his shoulder and gave it a squeeze, but Steve turned his attention over to Tony and asked, "You're OK with this?"
would be there at the end of it. You, with your bad habits and your loud music and your absolutely neurotic way of looking at the world. Because I could stay, and I could marry Peggy, and I could settle down with her and have a family with her, and maybe I'd be happy. I don't know. What I thought was happiness then isn't what I know happiness is now. But I wouldn't… And you wouldn't be…"
"Yeah, me, too," Bruce agreed and frowned at Tony. "I thought Steve didn't know?" he murmured, nodding his head ever so slightly at Steve.
Barnes just turned to Steve in confusion, like Tony had started to speak a completely foreign language, and Steve did nothing but hand a paper napkin over to Tony.
"And Merry Christmas to you, too," he cooed at her and smiled as she gurgled and pressed her face into his shoulder. "God, you're a cute one," he said and turned to Tony. "So, I'd say a 'little birdie,' but it more like a loud, obnoxious goose said you guys chose Pep and Happy to be her guardian in the event that you two, uh, you know..."
Thor was still watching TV, and evidently Natasha wasn't fazed in the least by Jim's assessment of Tony's former lovers.
"Confusing. I—" He lowered his gaze but couldn't stop the flush slowly spreading over his cheeks. "I guess it still boggles my mind that this— that
"Of course you can't," she muttered, finger hovering over her mouth. "You're not made for that. You're not the creator. He is."
It was all he could concentrate on during the extremely late lunch or very early dinner (depending on how one looked at it) the others held in their honor at one of the more exclusive restaurants in the city, someone having footed the expense for a private dining room (and evidently the expense to pay off the wait staff as well; it was nice to know his hard-earned money was going to worthwhile endeavors). He couldn't even pay attention to the toasts or the conversations because he was too busy sitting there, his hand on his abdomen as he tried to feel that motion again — that strange fluttering that was equal parts foreign and comforting to him. He couldn't even appreciate how handsome Steve looked in his uniform (had he mention lately how fucking
'Anna Tasha' he had to assume was Natasha, but he was at a loss as to who 'Uncle Sam' and 'Wanda' were. He knew asking a four-year-old would be like bashing his head against the wall, though, and he was afraid the Other Guy wouldn't be able to handle it, so he just smiled and said, "How 'bout peanut butter and jelly?"
"Bucky," he replied easily then glanced up and met Tony's eyes in a slightly more meaningful stare. "Buck doesn't know the history of that, so…"
— pull me up on all fours and maybe just make me hold the position for a while, my cock all hard and red and straining against the silk, and then after a while, you could—"
He didn't quite know what Tony meant by that, but he knew even if he asked, Tony would be cagey about it, so he just gave Tony's hand a tight squeeze and said, "God, this is all so—"
Tony smiled a little in return, and before he knew it, Steve was leaning in and kissing him, pressing his mouth to Tony's in a chaste but warm measure of affection. One hand still holding the trinket, Tony reached out with his free hand and cupped Steve's cheek, holding him there and ignoring the chorus of immature groans that greeted them at the gesture.
Tony smirked at him. "Oh, think you're so smart, do you?" he asked then produced a spatula. "I'm very carefully going to scoop them off."
Tony stared up at his murder-mug a moment before he finally sputtered, "How do you purportedly know so much about babies?"
happy about) as they ran measuring tapes all over his body, wrote down things, and nodded to each other about suggested styles and materials, Natasha sitting in a leather-backed chair and watching them for any suspicious activity. After the measurements had been taken, one held different swatches of color and material up against him as the other looked on, and finally in disgust, the woman turned to Natasha and snapped, "Make yourself useful and do something with her hair," motioning to Tony as though the sight of Tony's long, somewhat unkempt dark tresses personally offended her.
"How do you even walk in these things?" he muttered over the booming sound of the music leaking out of the club's walls.
try being told by some crazy witch from space that you're pregnant and you can't get rid of it without killing yourself."
"I don't know," Tony said with a shrug. "I guess I can understand it. You both go into it under the impression that it's just sex and nothing else, why not?"
, almost, that it should happen this way — that Steve should die and a child be born in his stead. And not just any child but his own flesh and blood. The father had died, but a daughter had been born into this world to take his place. He thought about what Esmeralda had said — about bondmates and the desire to breed with one another — and he still thought it was stupid, but…
Steve just nodded, ignoring the 'alien' line as he handed the ring back. Tony slipped it back on his finger.
He was sitting on the floor, mounds of toys and clothing and knickknacks and wrapping paper surrounding him, Olivia squealing as she rolled around in a pile of already-torn paper. The toys had mostly been from 'Santa'; pretty little dresses in soft colors had come from people called 'Pepper and Happy'; soft little onesies (as Tony had called them) had come from 'Uncle James and Aunt Tasha'; something that looked like a child's first chemistry set had come from 'Uncle Bruce' (
Steve looked away, and he stared down at his plate before he said in a small and pained voice, "Tony, I can't lose you."
"Then why do you think you would feel it now?" she asked like she was exasperated from dealing with an idiot.
Tony shook his head. "Not telling. You gotta figure that out on your own. I know you can. You know how to Google. And if not, there's always JARVIS."
Jim tilted his head back and forth like he was weighing his options before he said, "Well, yeah, maybe there's a little part of me that's bummed at being passed over, but the rational and logical side of me says you guys made the right choice."
He also told her to just set the pot of coffee down on their table, but she assured him she only had the one carafe for regular and needed that for the scant few other customers that were milling about, and this started a five-minute tirade on the abject stupidity of 'decaf coffee.'
He jumped when he heard the sound of cannons firing. He fell to the floor, covering his neck, his heart pounding, and glanced around to try to identify where the guns were coming from.
"Nothing!" Bruce said, snapping off a disposable glove. "You're…a little further along than I was hoping."
Steve just rubbed his belly some more then said, "You know, they said it's a good idea to talk to him."
He squawked out a laugh as Barnes finally came to a stop right in front of Tony, and as his friends began to sing out a verse of 'Happy Birthday to You,' Tony looked down at the cake that was made in the shape and color of the Iron Man helmet, marveling at the richness of the colors and the pretty decent depiction of one of the more common armors he wore — usually to charity events and children's hospitals, as those were really the only places the public could get a good look at the armor.
," JARVIS replied, and Tony went into the closet and pulled out the small trunk where they kept their most intimate possessions. He flipped the latches and opened the lid, and he looked over the neat array of toys and implements they used for their play. He picked up the black leather collar, the one with the garnet and yellow topaz gemstone accents, and he brushed his thumb over the jewels and nodded his approval before he reached in and grabbed the leash that went with it. He thought about pulling out some of the other toys, but he figured he'd wait on that. He wasn't even sure Steve would be open to the collar.
"Huh?" he asked and stopped in the middle of the living room area. Now, if he were the Cap, where would he keep his art supplies?
Steve, recognizing what the event had turned into, just asked, "See? Was it so hard to wait until afterward?" only to end up with a sigh from Wilson and a headshake from Barnes as he said, "Gotta get you out of that old-world way of thinking, Stevie."
He shook his head and yawned a little. "No," he said, "think I'll head down to the lab and work on some stuff. Have a list about a mile long of stuff I'm supposed to do for everybody."
"Just get me a coke," he muttered and sat back against his chair, folding his arms tight over his chest.
"A guy from Jersey," he said and tossed the empty box onto the table. "Said his mother had them because her father had them because he was a huge Captain America fan and must have gotten them at a fire sale Howard threw after he broke into Steve's place and took all of his stuff. After he disappeared, I mean— Steve, not Howard."
Tony rolled his eyes. "What were you supposed to do? Jump after him?" He gave a hard tug on Steve's hands so that Steve would look at him, and when he did, Tony shot a pointed gaze his way and said in a very clipped and harsh tone, "Stop jumping off of, out of, and into things. You are going to kill me if you keep doing that. My heart cannot take you pulling that stupid shit time and time again. Are we clear?"
Tony had insisted that it wasn't a real checkup unless he was covered only by a thin paper smock, but Bruce said there was no reason for him to get undressed and he could do whatever examinations and run whatever tests he needed while Tony was fully clothed.
Three minutes. Steve could probably get him off in three minutes. They had a bathroom in this place, right?
But Tony just stroked his hair some more and said, "Sometimes I worry I'm not enough for him. I'm not enough to keep him happy."
Tony's eyes went wide a moment, like he hadn't expected Steve to say that, before a mask settled over his face, and he put on that phony smile that Steve could spot a mile away and always hated to see.
"'s'name we picked out of the book," he slurred as relaxation began to overtake him. "Pure coincidence."
"This Steve Rogers sounds like a terrible guy that doesn't realize how good he really has it. You should probably cut your losses while you can."
was his greatest responsibility and look! Look at how cute she was just lying there and sleeping and feeling all sorts of safe and secure and warm and loved and—
Sam snorted a laugh. "You know that's not going to be there for us when we get old, right? You know they'll have killed it by then."
"If they're going in the order we think they're going in," he said and opened his eyes again, "then it's too late for us to stop them from taking the next target. We should have time to get to the third target before they hit it. We'll cut them off there." He looked over the assembled group and added, "You've got five minutes. Get what you need."
Tony considered this look a moment before he said, "No, he does. That's 'cause Steve plays with him because Steve seems to think he's an overgrown puppy instead of a
Tony made a contemplative humming sound then said, "No, honey, you are. You remember that time we were at the cabin and you tried to be nice and make breakfast and you need up having to go out to McDonald's and get some McMuffins?"
" Tony repeated like he didn't quite understand what that asshole Barton was implying. Until he did.
Contrary to what most people thought, Tony was not an abysmal cook — one burned omelet for Pepper aside. OK, he really hadn't even taken the time to learn how to do it until he'd had something called 'shield waffles' demanded of him once upon a time, and after realizing that it wasn't the worst experience in the world, he found out he kind of
Tony didn't back down. The fuck he would. He was fucking Iron Man. Well, no, he was actually fucking Captain America, but he
"It worked, didn't it?" Steve offered as a defense. "They didn't catch on to who we were or what we were doing. And, speaking of which—" Steve reached out and took the small blue bag from him over his protests. "I'll take care of that from here on out."
He put his arms around her and hugged her, and he pressed a kiss to the crown of her head and said, the words coming to him like they were being fed to him through the ether, "I love you, too, baby girl."
"When am I ever not?" came his cocky reply, and she swatted at him, but there was a teasing and fond smile on her lips as she did so. She muttered something in Russian — probably one of the few words she remembered from the college Russian she'd taken — and Bucky replied in much the same way, and Steve had to suppress a laugh at the blind leading the blind. Natasha's Russian was probably as good as his German—
…experience I've ever had, but, as an experience, I'm kind of ready for it to be over. I'd like to go back to the way I was."
Steve just nodded once. "If I ever get caught up with Hydra, I firmly expect the first friendly face I see to be Iron Man storming the gates."
"I know that, Tony," Bruce said, trying for even but coming off annoyed. "But I'm not willing to take that risk. Some women don't even need meds. Some women barely have any pain. You've had absolutely zero complications from this pregnancy so far aside from the usual annoyances—"
Tony didn't even have the strength or the desire to curse him out. He just pressed he heels of his palms into his eyes and wondered once again why something so 'natural' was so goddamned painful.
people he lived with, he hung up his wet towels) that his stomach grumbled loudly and angrily. He stopped a moment and put a hand to his stomach. Come to think of it, he hadn't had anything since that turkey sandwich he'd found earlier, and as he thought about it, it turned out he was kind of hungry.
Tony was whispering Steve's name, part-prayer and part-whine, and Steve, in much less time and much less gracefully or graciously than before, was coming once again, filling Tony with his spend as he kept a firm hold of his hips and pumped into him, making Tony take everything he was giving to him. And Tony took it, Steve feeling a clench of muscle surround his cock like it was milking it for release.
He didn't like the look on Tony's face, so he turned his attention back to the 'cellphone' in his hand. "But what does it do?"
Tony was equal parts ashamed and not ashamed to admit that yeah, he kind of wondered what it tasted like. Olivia slurped it down like each feeding was the last taste she'd ever get, and not that he wanted to guzzle down a bottle of it himself, but he just…he
." He turned his attention to the detractor and said, "First of all, I am pregnant — I am quite noticeably pregnant — so
As he watched the door close behind Thor, he sighed out a breath and chastised himself a little for being so...unenthusiastic about Thor's offer. It wasn't that it was a bad offer. It wasn't. It was actually very kind and thoughtful of him, and he appreciated it very much. It was just...
"Yeah, well, the owner of that company that I run just came out on national live television and said he'd been turned into a woman and was pregnant with Captain America's child. Think answering for
Steve rolled his eyes and stifled a groan, but Bucky turned to him and said, "I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. You two are fucking idiots."
Tony gladly let her massage his tense and aching muscles, and he selfishly stood there for a good five or ten minutes, bracing himself against the back of the couch as he let her work out the knots, only the talking heads on TV making any noise. Even DUM-E was quiet as he sat to the side, almost like he was watching and waiting for Tony to give him a job to do.
be out there. I'm the captain. That's my team out there. I should be out there helping and setting an example and promoting our cause."
One hand steadying the baby, Steve inadvertently reached up and rubbed his nipple to soothe a phantom pain that suddenly cropped up at the memory of that.
Tony was roused from his slumber by the sound of harsh voices arguing, and he moaned a little and, for some odd reason, immediately thought of his parents arguing once upon a time.
He reached out to the table and grabbed the remote. "Sure, kiddo," he said and handed it over to her. "Have at it."
But today wasn't just any day. It was Christmas Day, and even though their crew was about half the size that it usually was, they were still hosting the festivities that morning. Which was...kind of nice, actually. He'd never had a big family. The only time he'd had anything like that were those times he joined in with Bucky's family.
He turned and began to make his way toward the elevator. "Where are you going?" Steve called out to him.
"I can see that," Barnes said. "Another reason I kind of…" He laughed and said, "Jesus, I could imagine, he got himself a girl, the first time she asked him if something made her look fat—"
It was also hard to feel sexy when you had a fucking watermelon strapped to your gut, but Steve didn't seem to mind that.
upstate. Yeah, several hours on the back of a hog. Just the way Tony would have wanted to start his weekend.
He swallowed and took a deep breath then straightened up, seeing DUM-E's claw raised in concern, and he tweaked a smile at the 'bot and said, "Don't worry, you overgrown erector toy. Daddy's just…"
Pepper went quiet for a moment, and she squeezed his hands some more and said in a low voice, "David Welch is here, by the way."
Tony smiled some, thankful for the distraction Steve's complaint had provided him with. "Why? Come on! It's your birthday!"
"Tony," Bruce called from where he still sat in front of him, "do you have a preference for who you want to cut the umbilical cord?"
Tony considered this a moment as he watched his slumbering babe. "Steve would have been disappointed."
He brought up his other hand and braced it against the shower wall, nails from both hands now digging into the tile and, for all he knew, loosening them from the wall. 'Happy place' wasn't working, and so he tried to remember some of the other suggestions from that class, finally remembering to focus on something that wasn't the pain. When counting backwards from one hundred didn't work any better than his 'happy place' did, he turned his attention to his equations, and he ran through those over and over until the pain had subsided, and as it began to die down, he pressed his forehead against the cool tile coated with warm condensation, and he rubbed his head back and forth a few times then exhaled a shaky breath and said, "When he gets back, I'm cutting his balls off."
Tony ignored him and moved over to Bruce. "Et tu, Bruce-ay?" his said, disappointment coloring his speech.
"That's not exactly how it works," Steve said, almost like he was trying to soften Tony's words for the others.
Was this a test? Steve had felt some sort of magnetic pull to the man from the moment he'd become aware of his presence, but what…
Tony grunted and, from some wellspring deep within, found the strength to shove the guy off of him, startling the loser as he stumbled back a little and fell into someone that had just exited the men's room.
"—that means I'm harboring some deep-down, desperate crush on him. Uh, hate to burst your bubble, goeduck, but I'm not. The guy's an uptight ass with a really nice, tight ass you could bounce a fucking quarter off of."
Steve turned his head the slightest to brush his lips over the shell of Tony's ear. "Is that a bad thing?"
the anchor whose name was completely lost on Steve said before the clip cut to footage of the previous night's Stark Foundation gala while an announcer read over the images,
"Yeah, you are," he said and set the tablet back on his lap. "You know, the suggestions really aren't half-bad."
"I dragged that idiot to Queens the night before I shipped out," he muttered, stabbing at the potatoes frying up in the pan.
A little unsteady, he got up on his knees and crawled between Tony's legs. Tony made a face at how uncomfortably wet and sticky he was there, but Steve just reached and took him by the underside of his thighs and pushed his stocking-clad legs back and away, spreading him open wide.
Steve — giving him that soft, intimate look that that other Steve had offered him, the one that made him feel like he was the most important thing in the world to that Steve. God help him, there were moments where he thought maybe this Steve was thinking about laying one smack on him like that other Steve had.
"Seriously?" one of the other gallery-goers asked from where he stood with a group beside the 'Scenes from London' panel.
He pressed a kiss to Tony's jaw, and that's when Tony felt Steve's other hand down at his clit, and he moaned a moment as he felt Steve's fingers work the hardened, engorged nub that had been so unfairly ignored for so long. And then Steve was thrusting into him, and he couldn't help the desperate, wanton, needy sounds that keened high in his throat even as he sucked at Steve's fingers.
"And the stupid son-of-a-bitch is just laying there, isn't he? Ready, willing, and able to take it."
make me her mother. And yes, I happen to think she and I are both very cute looking in our own adorable way, so she's not wrong on that, either."
Steve chuckled, nuzzling against the side of Tony's neck and said, "OK. Sure thing," and positioned Tony for the best angle of access. "Ready?"
Tony took the box from his hands. "Oh, this must be for me," he said and carried it over to the couch. He sat down with it, and Steve and Pepper exchanged 'hello's while Tony began to rip the tape off the box and plunder the bounty therein.
Tony stared at her a moment, and he thought about what this meant in principle — what was coming out and where it was coming out from — and he realized that while it was 'natural' and while he wasn't exactly ashamed by it, it really was probably something he was OK with not seeing.
Tony blinked as the silk fell away, and Steve put it on the nightstand and said, "For later," then took Tony's chin in his grasp and turned his head up toward him. "Look at me," Steve ordered, and he met Steve's hard, lustful gaze, but not before he let his eyes rake over the sight of Steve's cock, hard and erect, right in front of him, a bead of precome formed at the tip.
Steve just set his tablet down on the coffee table and turned his body so that he was facing Tony. "What happened?" he reiterated without answering his question. Then again, Tony already knew the answer to that question, didn't he?
There were already rumblings about what they'd done down on Worth Street. Well, not that so much as when they'd gone out for lunch/dinner afterwards. Linner? Dunch? What was that called? Anyway, there were already rumblings about that — someone that 'looked like' Captain America attending something that 'looked a lot like' a small wedding reception at one of the more upscale restaurants with 'someone that looked like' that mystery brunette he'd been seen out with previously.
Tony exhaled a breath. "We gotta be more careful now. I kind of have the feeling our joint fertility is through the roof, and unless I want to spend the rest of my, well, childbearing years pregnant, we've gotta watch what we're doing."
Tony stared at him a moment then turned to see Steve, jaw set and eyes hard as he glared at Welch. "What's your angle here? What's your gimmick? What are you looking for?"
He dropped his hands away from his face and got up from the chair. He made to go to the bar and pour himself a drink, but he thought better of it. Not because he didn't want it — he did — but because he couldn't. Not while he had her. Not while she was here. He wasn't going to be like his father. No matter whose kid she really was, he wasn't going to be like his father.
"He is," Tony replied and took a sip of water. He nodded his thanks to the host, who nodded back and left them.
But Olivia just stood over by the tree and clutched fast to her little plush toy. She shook her head and giggled and said, "No!" but Tony just raised his eyebrows and said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Did I phrase that as a question? I don't think I did."
"Isn't it?" He surprised even himself with the amount of venom in his voice, and he seemed to surprise Tony, too, judging by the latter's painful wince.
"Not entirely," he said, the tablet resting on his lap as he swiped through screens with one hand and fed himself with the other.
"Yeah, uh, your scale needs to be recalibrated," he said and pointed to the number it had spit out. No fucking way was he a hundred and fifty-seven pounds!
"I wish I could have been there with you. I mean it," he added at Steve's disbelieving scoff. "I wish I could have… I wish I could have seen what you saw. You're in my world. You don't have a choice. You know what my world looks like. I wish I could have seen your world. I wish I could have seen it with you. Fuck, even if I had to go looking like this—" He pulled one arm from around Steve and patted his belly before he put it back. "I wish I could have been there with you. Even just for a day."
"Ugh," Tony said and slumped into his chair. "They do remember the scent of those things makes me throw up, right?"
When they'd finished eating, Tony grabbed the check before Steve had even realized the waitress had brought it over, paid it, and no doubt left a fifty-percent tip.
Hey, he was getting better about it. Poor Buck still stared up at the ceiling like it was watching his every move. Which it...kind of was, to be honest.
"That implies he had a soul to begin with," Bucky said, and the guys laughed (Steve noticed Natasha's laughter was conspicuously absent) before Natasha suggested that they go check out the atrium and Pepper agreed wholeheartedly with that suggestion.
having a choice, but Tony ignored him and instead put a hand to his belly and said, "Look, if you could behave yourself tonight, I'd really appreciate it. Just…go to sleep or something, OK? Try not to kick me too much, maybe get your fat head
"That's right," he said with a false sense of pride. He had to believe alternate-universe him said it as a joke. He couldn't earnestly mean it, could he? Olivia seemed to think it was earnest, though, and he didn't want to rattle her small world too much just yet. "I am, and it was my choice, and I'm proud of it, and you can both kiss my…yeah."
"Yeah, sure, totally right there," he said and rolled his eyes, the diamond-and-sapphire band catching in the light as he raised the sandwich to his mouth to take another bite.
to mean something. It can't just mean that one of us has to knock up the other one. It has to— There has to be more to it than that. And I know you think I'm crazy, and I know you think I've flipped my lid, and I know you probably think this is just because I'm like this close—" he held his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, "—to dropping a kid, but it's not, all right? It's something— It's more than that. It's— I can't describe it, all right? I don't know how to describe it, but I can just… There should be a Steve-sized hole where my heart is right now, but there isn't. I don't— I can
"I wouldn't doubt it," she said with an easy shrug. "But overall, I don't think Hydra's known for being the most progressive or feminist organization."
Olivia continued to squawk, and Tony — in pain, exhausted from childbirth and childcare, sore from his prior Hydra-busting excursion, and wanting to stop the painful throb on his ears that was his newborn daughter's shriek — cried out, "But Bruce, she's hungry!"
He suspected, later on when Howard, Maria, and Jarvis had all died in that horrible wreck, that Tony mourned the loss of Jarvis more than he mourned both his parents.
"Sure. Why not? Serves the emotionally-repressed bastard right. You want to do it right after he comes home or wait a day or two?"
Tony moved his mouth from Steve's jaw to the pulse point in his neck. He sucked at it a bit then said, "Can't teach an old dog new tricks."
"I don't think you can equate facing an ex with throwing yourself on a grenade to save someone," he said and glanced at the monitor where, true to Sam's word, Tony was standing beside Pepper and Nat and fiddling with this phone.
"Yeah, definitely. They say boys are easier to raise, anyway, and as awesome as we are at being Avengers, I'm not sure that would automatically translate into being parents."
"I am not disgusted by you, if that's what you think. Clearly, I am not disgusted by the idea of sharing body fluids with you. It's just the principle of the thing, Steve. That is perfectly good orange juice that you're backwashing into!"
Hill reached out and patted his shoulder. "I'll explain later," she said and motioned him toward the door. "Come on. Nat's out there by herself."
Tony thought about the ache plaguing him in the particular area that had just been split wide open and said, "You mean it's going to get
He shrugged some. "Well, I don't real—" He heaved a sigh. "I don't know anymore. I just know that I would never entertain
Bruce then reached into the fridge and handed a bottle of water over to Tony. "Here," he said, and Tony stared at him a moment before he took the bottle from him.
thinking about it as anything more than a burden and something done to him without any say in the matter.
"It's really a pain anywhere in the city," Bruce said. "I guess Steve's right and we could have just walked."
"Not a bit," Tony said and finished setting things up. He got up from his chair and grabbed a sterile cotton swab. "Just a little swab in her mouth, and we should get what we need."
Tony nodded. "Then you understand my point. I'm not the same, you're not the same, and your pal is definitely not the same. We're going to help him, babe, believe me. We're going to get him to some point where he's OK. But it's going to take time, and helpful as I know you like to be, you might not be the best one to do it. You're too close. He needs someone that doesn't have as much invested — maybe someone that's even been through something similar."
"And I can afford it. So, yeah, I know, it makes more sense for me to stay home. Not saying you're not a big help and you're not her second-favorite person in the world, but, logically, it makes more sense for it to be me than you, and— Look, I love Iron Man. I love being Iron Man. Maybe I just love my daughter more."
Steve couldn't help the grimace that covered his face. "I think she wants to share her cookie with me."
Wilson moistened his lips to buy himself some time to formulate another response then said, "You're both a pain-in-the-ass in your own unique way, and you're both kind of fucking neurotic in your own weird ways, and you…kind of balance that out with each other in a way that I don't think
Tony didn't feel like going back to bed because what was the point? Steve wasn't there, so Steve couldn't help finish what he'd started
Steve directed some of his annoyance in Barton's direction, and Tony used the hand he had over Steve's mouth to turn his head back in his direction.
"Nah," Tony said and turned to his computer to run a simulation. "This might feel a little weird for a sec. Anything hurts in any way, you let me know, got it?"
"The button on the door handle right there. See it?" He didn't take his eyes off the road as he motioned to the spot in question. "Push it away from you once. That'll put it back up."
"Oh." Tony sat a little straighter and brightened. "I think we should go whole-hog. Someplace nice where we can get dressed up."
Tony snorted a laugh. "She's really not. She's on the bigger end of the newborn spectrum, which I can say I'm surprised given who her father is."
He snorted a laugh before he caught himself and went back to neutral again. "Are your daddy and your papa married?"
He found himself feeling kind of antsy after that — he had neglected his morning run — and seeing how he was unable to sit still and wait for the cookies to bake, Tony told him to go do something because he was driving him nuts, and after stomaching what ended up being a few minutes of
He stuck the fry in his mouth and chewed it, making sure to catch Steve's eye as he did so. Steve nodded in approval and went back to his plate, and Tony stared down at his.
Steve just stared at him some more, and he smiled and clasped his hands to his chest, the gesture, he was hoping, coming off humble and slightly submissive.
He swallowed and moved to sit down, hot, burning interest stirring within him again, and he blew out a breath and tore his gaze away from Tony, doing his best to think of the most abominable things imaginable in order to stave off the sudden hardening of his errant cock.
James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky. Best pal of Captain fucking America — the man Howard Stark was convinced his own son could never live up to. Captain America's best pal Bucky had killed Howard—
"I shouldn't be so… I don't have any right to be happy. Not after… Not after what I've done. And why do I deserve this more than anyone else? More than any of the others?"
He was struck first and foremost by a portrait of what appeared to be the photographer sitting on the wall that lined the sunken plaza of Rockefeller Center. Sitting to her left was another young woman that bore a familial resemblance to her, but with dark hair and features that suggested she probably took more after her other parent. Though the scene was New York, both girls looked like they had just stepped out of a store display window on Carnaby Street in 1967: bold-colored mini dresses; long hair; heavy-lidded eye makeup; one in knee-high boots while the other wore those loafer-type things with the low, chunky heels. Both girls were sitting slightly turned and cross-legged to show off long, lean legs, the hems of their dresses
"You do. It's ridiculous how much you eat. I made a dozen waffles the other night. I got two of them."
"I'm sick of being stuck in this tower. I'm not fucking Rapunzel. I want to go out. I want to go on a date."
He nodded and turned to the rest of the assorted group. "And the rest of you? Is that your excuse, too?"
He blew one last kiss in his little girl's direction then left the room, closing the door behind him.
"Yeah," he said and blew out a breath, "that one was a little stronger than the others." She nodded and hopped off the table. "I'll go get Bruce—"
Steve continued to chuckle as he looked down at the baby. "Your mommy doesn't meant that, doll baby."
"Didn't seem important at the time," he said with a shrug just as Barton and Romanoff made their way into the lab, both looking bored and in need of something to entertain them.
The sun was setting to the west, the Hudson a dark line separating the island from the mainland across the way. Deciding not to worry himself about their destination just yet, Tony contented himself by watching the steady stream of lights from the buildings that lined the roadway to his right. By chance, he spied a speed limit sign attached to a streetlamp and noted the posted speed of 50 MPH. He stole a glance over at the speedometer and saw the digital readout hold steady at 67. Funnily enough, he knew Steve was actually working to pace himself at that speed.
"Uh, television," Tony said quickly. "It's stuck on one of those Hallmark-type channels. You know the sort of schlock they play. Actually, you don't, but trust me, they do. I'm, uh, trying to fix it now."
—" he motioned at Tony's abdomen, "—is what you've been missing ever since the future version of your husband came to take her back to where she belonged?"
For the next hour or so, Olivia contented herself flipping through the stations, becoming bored with her selections almost as easily as she was able to select them. Tony bookmarked more of the necessities he might need if he was really going to do this — clothing, the proper foods, toys — and he was just contemplating a 'my first chemistry set' when he heard the elevator open again, and he sighed and said, "Nope, Brucie, still haven't changed my mind."
lose my mind. This is what I want, Steve. I want to go back to what I was. I want... I want my dick back."
"Look, it would make things so much easier for all of us if you would just admit already that I'm right and you're wrong and I helped you with the gift."
But the collection of devious friends and comrades sitting there in the living room just exchanged little smiles with each other before Natasha said, "Nothing. Don't worry about it. We're just trying to imagine you two being all traditional and conventional."
Tony waved him off and said, "These things never start on time, anyway," then turned to Steve and asked, "Is it OK? How does it look? Should I have gone more 'professional'? I was trying to do 'cute' but 'fun' at the same time."
Tony just stared at him, trying to process what he'd been told and coming up only with error messages. "I'm sorry. Are you trying to freeze us out?"
She moved her hand a little so that she could trail a finger down his cheek — almost like she was caressing him — and he jerked his chin away with as much fight as he had left in him and said, struggling to get the words out as things began to go a little blurry and woozy, "Isn't that…sw— uh, swee— sweet? The family…legacy." The more he tried to fight it, the more he felt as though he was caught in a fog — a jellied fog, if such a thing existed, his legs wobbly and his arms just not cooperating with what he wanted to do.
Steve reached out and grabbed an afghan from the back of the couch, and he shook it out and draped it over them, and Tony sighed a little and finally relaxed against him, murmuring, "I missed you."
But Steve didn't waver from that steadfast seriousness, and he said, "I mean it. You always come first, and I will do everything and anything in my power to protect you and her."
He stretched his back out some then bent down to grab the suit by the legs, and Barton made a hesitant sound and said, "Uh, Stark? Maybe you shouldn't do that?"
female and would now be for the rest of his life. He'd noticed some difference in the way people had treated him — that guy holding the door for him at that coffee shop, the media's fixation with his appearance in more superficial ways than he'd ever before experienced — and he'd even succumbed himself to taking on rituals and routines that were the bane of 'acceptable' womanhood for the modern American female — things like plucking and shaving and various other hair removal methods because god forbid any woman have a moustache or too heavy a brow (his brows weren't
Yeah, I remember, Steve. But I also remember a lot of other shit that's happened since then. And yeah, I get that he feels like it's his fault or something what happened to me, and I get that he feels guilty about that, but acting like it never happened doesn't change the fact that it
"I believe your exact words were: 'They don't like it? Fuck 'em.' Swear to god, you almost gave Barton a stroke when you said that. Funniest fucking thing I ever saw."
And then, before Tony could even take a breath, Steve's mouth was on his, and Steve's hands were on his body — all over his body. He squeaked a little in the kiss as Steve's hands went greedily from his breasts down to his belly and then to his ass, groping him, like he was trying to feel everything that he could before Tony got wise to him and threw him off. And then Steve's hands were on the underside of his thighs and trying to hoist him up to rest on his hips, and Tony put his hands on Steve's shoulders and pushed back, breaking the kiss in the process. He went to explain himself for his behavior — he just…honestly hadn't been feeling it for some time — but Steve, his lips reddened and glistening with saliva, his eyes hooded, just burned his crystalline blue gaze into Tony's and growled, "
He shook his head and left the room. He went back downstairs and found Bruce now sitting on the couch, waiting for his return, and he forced a tight smile at him and ignored that sad-eyed look on his face that said he was disapproving of Tony's actions but had no actual way of being able to stop him.
Oh, that was something Tony could do, he discovered as he sat on the couch later that afternoon — he thought it was afternoon, anyway going by the amount of light streaming in the windows — he could build thousands of little arc reactors for everyone so that something like this never happened again. What was Tony Stark doing, anyway? No one had heard anything from him since this whole thing had begun. Did he think he was above it all because he was pregnant with Captain America's child?
But Steve just laced up his sneakers. He'd already changed into a tight t-shirt and a pair of pants he wore for running. "We're supposed to be getting out of town for a couple days."
He shrugged and set the glass down. "In case you haven't noticed — and I'm so disappointed in you if you haven't — I did refrain, in my last two columns, from calling for your imprisonment."
Steve had changed into a pair of jeans and a t-shirt by this point, and he rolled his eyes as he moved closer to Tony's personal space.
Steve shrugged again, like he was ashamed of what he felt. "Kinda wouldn't mind a surprise. I mean, I kinda want a boy — I mean I
"Yeah, well, certain bigmouth mechanics keep their mouths shut, they won't have to know, now will they?"
"Not that Steve won't try every angle," Barnes said. "He wants you to be happy. He might annoy the rest of us to get to that point, but he wants you to be happy."
"Bruce said she was nine pounds, twelve ounces," Steve replied like those four ounces made a fucking difference.
"You know, I don't recall saying it like that," Steve said. "And I don't recall saying we should spend
Tony looked beseechingly at Bruce, but Bruce just grimaced and scratched the back of his head and stuttered out several non-words, and the little thing that had attached herself to him pulled back a little and looked up at him, eyes watery and lip trembling and face splotchy from where she'd had it pressed into his pants.
"J?" he said with a sigh then tucked the ring away in the drawer for safekeeping. "Remind me to put that somewhere safer for the duration."
Tony just groaned and fell back against the pillow. "I trust you. I was just tested recently. I'm good. But I trust you. Now just fuck me already. Jesus."
