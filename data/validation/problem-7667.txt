“I am. But Tony, what the hell are you doing?”
"How about the rest of you? Anything to say?" Steve demanded and even Tony felt concerned. Steve sounded deadly.
“Tony, are you ready?”
The party will be up next!
“No problem! Anytime Cap!” Iron man replied and Steve pictured a wink under the face plate. He knew Iron man was definitely pleased.
“How can I not?” Steve said softly with pure agony in his eyes and sounding like he was almost in pain, and Tony shook his head because he couldn’t listen to this, he
His shuffling gains some attention and when he looks back, the team are staring at him in silence. They’re not saying a word.
"My guess would be about just over three weeks. You've been missing for just over a month so that tells me you weren't with the Skrulls for long. What did you do about your injuries?"
“I’m sorry too. But you hurt me Steve. You let me down.”
"Well that seems kind of ironic. There's a joke in there somewhere." Tony mumbled but didn't argue. The excitement of the day was starting to catch up to him and the bed was looking very tempting.
“No, I was just-“
“Try to remember if you can.”
How can you say that-“ And for a moment Tony wants to curl his arms around Rogers because he sounds like he’s in pain from the very thought.
"Why not?"
“Enough, please. Can we just get inside? I need to sleep for at least three weeks.”
“Yes. Rogers is taking lessons don’t worry.”
“Some people aren’t meant for that. They don’t...”
The limo started to move. Steve uncrossed his legs and, keeping his eyes locked with Tony’s, spread his legs a bit.
He misses Steve. More than he can even begin to explain.
“Yeah. He doesn’t like that I have other interests.”
As soon as he straightened up, Tony opened his mouth to respond when suddenly alarms blared throughout the halls and the lights flashed red.
“What are you talking about?” Carol echoes behind him.
“The number of US bonded pairs has tripled in the last month. Over three thousand omega pregnancies have been confirmed. Steve...” Nat glanced at the door. “He is an exception.”
“Sorry.” Tony said quietly, staring past Steve’s shoulder. Then he just ducked his head and sighed tiredly, because he’d already embarrassed himself so what was a bit more? “Sorry, I-“
“Nice catch.” Tony said quietly and felt his breathing shake when the hands around him squeezed and then let go. Steve let out a slow breath and stepped back, allowing him to turn around and face him.
Tony thought a little sadly, fiddling with his wrists.
Sucking in a deep breath, he walked closer and closer until finally his foot touched that thing again. This time he didn’t startle, and instead, crouched down.
He was lucky he’d managed to get this appointment. Maybe he was downplaying it but things had been...difficult lately. Ever since he’d woken up from his self induced coma, too many things had happened at once and he’d barely had a chance to breathe. They’d taken out Norman which had been great and all but other than that...
It was just like old times.
“Agent Hill! What brings you here?” He tried, feeling a thin smile spread across his face. These days, he didn’t really have many people to talk to. Other than Jenny, of course.
The man was different. Unusual. Tony had never seen a person like him. He was so remarkably different from the humans and vampires Tony had seen, it was amazing. His eyes were narrowed and sharp, but there was a certain intelligence, a depth in there that Tony instantly liked. His cheeks were well defined and his jaw was chiseled like some of the angels Tony had once heard about. And his lips were a subtle pink, and they looked soft and inviting.
“I did.”
Completely fine.
It also gave him protection from the scanner ships.
“You shouldn’t be here Stark.”
When he blinked open his eyes, everything was blurring a little at the edges. It took him a second longer than he would’ve liked, to let go.
Ben ruled the roost. The others were obviously all just playing ball to Ben’s tunes, but that still didn’t make it easy for him. He’d have to convince Ben first that he wasn’t what Ben made him out to be. He was a futurist. He made mistakes. He was arrogant. But he wasn’t trying to make them feel any less than him.
They’d both come home better for it and Tony had felt a new level of comfort around Steve. It was like Steve understood him in a way that others didn’t. Had a similar view of the world even if his response was different. To Tony, Steve was safe.
His throat feels like it’s burning now, but it isn’t the whiskey. It’s not the slaps across his face or the feel of Sunset pressing his body into the mattress or the feeling of his body being torn apart by the shrapnel. It isn’t from hearing his father tell him Stark men are made of iron or that he was never going to be loved by Captain America and that having a faggot and a liar for a son was his own personal hell. It isn’t from the world repeatedly reminding him that Captain America, that
“Good. Because I have a job for you.”
in the ball pit. Something about some of the balls coming to life and the whole lot starting to move in waves every time he went near.
Tony frowned a little at that. Why did everyone keep going on about that?
Tony paused and flicked his eyes at the benches where some of the agents were organising sheets of metal. “I thought Ben ran the place.”
“And you’re a damn hero. The best.” Gabe insisted and Tony ducked his head down, trying his best to hide his smile.
Looking absolutely exhausted, Steve falls back into the chair beside his bed and drops his head into his hands. Stunned, Tony can’t do anything but stare.
“Oh, who’s trying to sleep?” She interrupted, widening her eyes and looking around at the rest of the group in mock horror. Tony noticed a smile starting to grow on Ben’s face as she did. “Have we forgotten someone?”
“You hate Ty. You said he used to take advantage of you in college. That he’s the reason why you hated alphas.”
It was Tony’s turn to scoff. “Now that’s just insulting.”
“I have a proposition for you. Just listen.” Robinson requested but the long fingers around his wrist tightened just a hair. So Tony nodded and tried not to yank his hand away out of habit. He hated it when strangers did that.
“Don’t do something hasty Stark. He cared about you too, I know that.” Bucky warns and follows Tony’s movements with dark eyes when he touches the bruise marks around his neck and doesn’t let Extremis heal them. It feels good to feel something after so long. The pain is bittersweet and the best thing in a long time.
“-ark! Stark! Stark!”
“Leave it!” Tony growls and tries not to flush when Rogers notices how hard he is under his jeans. “Put it down!”
“Exactly!”
The day merges into night out here. Tony wonders sometimes how he ever had the ability to make and pilot a suit of armor while simultaneously running a company, all while sober. Its like looking through glass and seeing a different reality.
“There’s no way-“
“I would. Try me, I swear.”
Tony’s hand shook around the phone. But he held firm. “I will. Just watch me-“
Robinson for his part, looked absolutely overjoyed. “Oh but you see, this meeting was incredibly important. I know you’re looking to take full shares back and I am willing to give it to you. My price is extremely reasonable.” He said with eyes that gleamed in the light. The man looked like he was about to burst.
With that, Steve let go and stood up, stepping away to open the blinds. Tony watched as he looked up and looked outside.
Fury sighed and looked at him. “Same thing as you. Now go home and eat. Maria told me you need food.”
“Why not?”
"I wanted to." Tony blinks and tastes salt on his lips. The air cools his cheeks and he realizes he's crying too. Once upon a time, he might've even been embarrassed. "It wasn't worth it."
“Hey.” Tony mumbled quietly and gave a small smile when the blonde stopped in front of him. Steve turned and gave him a once over, surprised but giving away nothing else.
They’re seven months in and Tony finds his days to be spread out over Ty and Steve and between all three of them, things are getting ridiculous. Tony feels both alphas getting more agitated as the due date draws near and he also know he pumping out more pheromones than any omega out there. The father of his pup is between these two and getting ready to protect his new family and it’s starting to affect the way all three of them function. Steve and Ty argue more and so does Tony. So it’s no surprise when things come to a head.
Steve didn’t notice. He was too busy lamenting to notice. “I really didn’t expect it to feel that...”
"I want to try. With you."
Reed freezes. Strange doesn’t move but he stops reading.
“What?” Even the young brunette that was placing their cutlery down paused and flashed Steve a look of surprise. The waiter looked just as stunned as Tony did but Steve was waiting patiently.
It had been hard to accept at first but Tony had known the risks right from the start. When Fury had asked him to host what would be his small family, he’d known even then that something would change. He just hadn’t been prepared for the intensity of his own feelings.
Overall it was unnerving. Perhaps he should’ve expected a strange being. But this one was oddly dressed and looked so different, despite being so similar.
In a strange turn of events, Pierce laughed good-naturedly and took another sip. It was so friendly that it just about hit Tony’s nerves, which didn’t help his mood at all.
Tony heard the sharp sound of tearing. The uniform lay in tatters on the floor.
Tony spends a few days in hospital with Steve and Petey. The team and Rhodey and Pepper visit them and there’s smiles and plenty of encouragement over the fact that Tony has chosen Steve again and a brief lecture from Rhodey on the importance of staying away from troubling alphas (Which Steve eagerly agrees to). It’s a wonderful feeling being surrounded by family and the omega part of him loves it.
“Yeah. I’m okay.” Tony said softly and felt himself go distant again as Clint began to circle him, checking for any damage to the armor. He thought he felt Clint grip his arms and stretch them out to check his torso. Weird since he was fine and Steve was the one who-
“Anthony? You’re back early.” Zeke said with surprise, opening the door to let Tony in. This time, Tony didn’t bother to say anything and simply chose to remain silent.
“That’s not all. He mustn’t engage with anyone. You hear me Anthony? Not a single person is to speak to you.”
Tony couldn’t speak. He couldn’t even breathe.
to help me, Tony!” Steve finally shouted and eyed Tony’s back carefully, knowing he was listening to every word. “That means something. I know you’re hurt. I know I hurt you-“
Great. Just great.
The injection was working. Tony was in control.
“The best Tony. You’re the best.” Steve murmurs and sighs softly. “I know you’ll remember. Because you always find a way. That’s you.”
“Tony, seriously? I’m not discussing our private life in front of this-this
"If there's anything you don't want, you tell me okay? We go as far as you want this to go. And if that means stopping here-"
Together they made their way through the extensive lab, and Tony found himself trying not to grin too hard when he saw what he had to work with. While the living quarters felt foreign, this felt like home. He recognised some of the designs some of the agents were working on as old replicas of Stark technology, and tried not to run over and correct an agent who was happening to change one of the designs. Still it was a little like candy land. This was what he’d come here for, and this was what he could still do.
“I’ll kill them. I’ll kill them all-!“ He snarled, feeling his rage finally boil over.
A being emerged from behind the blue ship and began to climb onto the hood. They seemed to stand tall and outstretched and raised their hand to cover their eyes as they looked in his direction-
“You too Tony. Let’s sit.”
Steve can feel Carol’s eyes on him. He can feel Reed’s hopeless gaze seeing through him.
Tony heard the words pass him. He didn’t say a thing and he felt his vision start to narrow to the sharp cobblestone floor. He could hear the words and track the voices, but it was like he was completely detached from his body. It was like watching the world through glass.
There was shouting and the sound of metal tearing and bullets being fired but gradually it all faded until there was nothing but a loud ringing in his ears.
The man’s nose wrinkled in disgust. Something guarded fell over his eyes and he stuck his chin up, his hair falling over his eyes at the movement.
“You’re my soulmate.” Steve tells Tony quietly, and suddenly it feels so much more real. To be telling Tony this, even if Tony doesn’t know it.
Rage began to brew in Tony’s heart. The thought of Steve doing this again was
Robinson smiled gleefully and nodded eagerly as if he was a kid at a candy store.
It was wrong. The entire image was wrong. Steve felt sick.
Just on his right was the bakery that he would often grab goods from. It was closed of course, since no bakery like this would be open at eleven at night. But on certain mornings, he’d collect his order and leave the biggest tip. And it would always be the same; a sesame bagel and plain one for himself. Once upon a time it had been part of his day to day but now it was just a part of the past. Something that felt wrong to look at.
“Oh pet.” Zeke sighed and sat on the bed beside him, brushing Tony’s hair back gently. “You are good, but you must do better.”
Tony didn’t know what to think. He knew Steve was planning something, just by the way he was talking. He looked totally energised and Tony just couldn’t understand why. Hadn’t Steve agreed they were done?
It’s been months. Steve can’t decide. He can’t sleep. He can’t do anything.
If Tony had been more himself, he would’ve laughed. “No.” He answered blandly instead, knowing he didn’t get the right to challenge their behavior. These people were not the problem obviously.
“Tony.” Steve interrupted, switching off the ignition, and something in the motion made Tony’s heart sink. “What does that even mean?”
The speech stretched on for some time, with every second drawing something new. Steve’s skin tone, the length of his fingers-even the exact pressure of his palm. It was firm enough but didn’t even come close to the maximum strength Steve could use. And Tony knew because he’d done the calculations. Steve’s strength could break bones.
As Steve clears the way and puts the various bags of clothes and gifts aside, Tony settles into the plush couch and gazes down at Peter. He’s sound asleep in a warm blanket that Steve had prepared by scenting it with his and Tony’s neck glands. The pup had seemed to settle very happily in it as a result, and even Tony couldn’t stop leaning closer, just to catch a bit of the scent. It made him feel safer too.
“I said?”
“I asked you for it.” Tony recalled and though he sounded strong, Steve’s shirt was getting worse. “You would’ve been okay to-“
“Hey.”
“Your trips. These outings, they happen once a week?” Steve asked quietly from his right hand side and Tony eyed him silently. They kept walking in a straight line but Tony got the feeling Steve had planned the long route.
When Tony tried to explain again for what must’ve been the seventeenth time, everyone had shushed him and told him to wait. They’d all know soon enough.
“Aww, what’s the matter Stark? Afraid the beds will be too small for your gigantic ego?” Ben reminded him like the pain in the ass he was. Tony seriously considered which one was worse; Doom or this jerk.
Steve looked at Tony then and smiled knowingly.
“I...I love you too.”
“We need to.” Steve said firmly, using one hand to hook around Tony’s neck. “We have to.”
“You ready?” Steve asked, sitting up and straightening his suit as the car rolled to a stop.
“You know I won’t. You
“Steve.”
EDIT:Tags have been updated-please observe!
He turned and looked Tony in the eye. His next words were firm.
He looked kind of...tired actually. A bit dulled and a little thinner than he remembered but nothing too concerning. Just something to watch he thought.
A hollow pit formed in his stomach. How he'd thought he could try and hurt Steve like that and not feel a thing afterwards was ridiculous.
“Stark-“
He’s lost track of the days. Is it Christmas yet?
, she tossed the remote into her other hand and pressed the plus button on the volume. Voices blasted through the speakers, loud enough that some of the agents next to the speakers actually jumped.
At the next stop, the group of agents swarmed out but not before a woman stopped and turned to him at the door. Her eyes lingered over him carefully and that's when it occurred to him.
Tony pauses and looks up, wondering how the man hasn’t made a sound yet. It occurs to him then that the man has left. There’s nothing but the cold breeze of a ghost. He’s gone.
Tony didn’t answer. He just stared tiredly ahead, feeling so exhausted he could sleep for days.
Once the door slides open, Ty walks in and takes his blazer off. Same as he always does, he strips off the first parts of this three piece suit and-
Tony looked into those eyes and didn’t turn away. “I just worry they’ll always come back. And finish the job.”
“They’re not your team. We all know who your real team is and I’m guessing that’s half the problem.” Steve said firmly, and clasped his hand tightly before pulling him away from the door.
“You were.” Captain Roger’s expression grows pinched. “Me and the others demanded Fury change that. And then you agreed to join the team.”
“B-bond?” Tony breathed and stared up at Steve through bleary eyes. “W-what bond?”
In one smooth motion, Steve released one of his wrists and spun him around. Then, with viper like speed, he grabbed Stark’s wrists back and pulled him against his chest, keeping his hands crossed in front of his chest.
Tony thinks to himself as he looks at Ty while they walk back. He eyes Ty’s hand by his side and wonders what Ty would do if he tried to reach out.
“Anthony.” Zeke growled suddenly, dropping his pen with a loud
“Still a while to go. There’s gonna be a bit of dance and then the president’s gonna do his thank you speech. Then dinner and more dancing.” Fury said, and watched him fiddle with the glass. “Why? Not enjoying yourself?”
“You should say your goodbyes. You don’t have much time left.”
“Yes.” Tony said quietly, trying to ignore the prickling feeling of wandering eyes on his neck. He felt like a mouse being sized up for a meal.
“That’s playing dirty...” Tony whispered, licking his lips and wincing at the dryness. Steve smiled though, which made it worth it.
“That Steve Rogers would become morally ambiguous. It’s not like you to use money for personal gain. Isn’t that something you’re against?”
"You're okay, I think that's enough tonight. Get some rest."
The whole world froze. Tony’s heart stopped. His body felt like it was free-falling and still, all at once. Nothing else mattered but the soft, gentle press of Steve’s lips against his.
!” Steve suddenly roared, loud enough that several of the waiters and customers paused to look at them. But Steve didn’t care. “You’re not a liability and I’m getting sick and tired of you thinking that! You act like that around everyone! Even around me you-“ Steve finally noticed the room and cut himself off, taking his voice down a notch. “-you act like you’re on egg-shells.”
.”Rogers glares at Ty as he says it and Tony almost laughs because
“Ah.” Zeke clucked his tongue and let his hand cup Tony’s cheek. “You lie. Your body tells me, but do not worry.”
“Don’t worry puppy. I’ll make you howl.”
“He’s being seen just over there with the other team. He’s fine, doing well.” The medic hummed and called out a number to his colleague. “Ninety-seven. Starting to stabilize.”
Steve blinked for a moment. Then he frowned. “Your boyfriend? Your boyfriend left you here?”
“No.” Reed acknowledges honestly and somehow, Steve appreciates it.
“One of the suits I saw. It was maroon. I almost went for it but-“ Steve gestured at Tony’s body. “This was better. Different on you.”
“I think I know what he likes Rogers-“
“Can I help you Senator?” Tony lifted his head up and tried to ignore the way his head throbbed at the sight of Stern's slimy grin. Behind him, a few politicians were snickering like a gang of crows.
When he pulled the glass back, he caught her staring.
“Yes. Now please.”
Tony thinks with a tired heart. It’s only fair they see him for what he is.
“For now. But when my bite is on you, you will be mine. And nothing he says will stop that.”
“I’m fine. But I think I might’ve found something.” He said, inching closer with his shield out. His eyes were glued to the mystery spot where his foot had connected with something. He prayed it was good news.
Tony, in his armor is looking at the screen too, just like everyone else. Steve pictures fear and guilt in Tony’s eyes. He’s seen it before after all, with the SHRA and their recent confrontation.
"Bucky told me. As soon as I woke up. I wasn't dead, Sharon never killed me. It's a long story but I was suspended in a coma and Bucky's been working to help me since he realized."
“You’re mine, Shellhead. What makes you think you can-“ Steve bites his tongue and looks away. His eyes burn with the threat of unshed tears and he doesn’t dare say more. He’s gonna have it out with Tony. He has to because this, not to mention this self-destructive play, is a serious concern and he won't have it. What kind of self-esteem does Tony have for him to be able to throw his own life away, or forget that-
“He’s fine. But he...everything’s fine.”
Steve's other hand curled around his waist and pulled him close. Tony's breath caught and for a moment, all he could do was stare at the man lips that were just mere inches away.
“He’s issued the order. You better come in or else.” Maria said harshly, sounding firm as a marshal, but Tony’s mind was in array.
Bemused, Tony let a grin slide onto his face. “Awww Happy, you don’t need to get so caught up in-“
It was almost unbelievable.
“Like when you spilled ice-cream over my shirt on the first date. Your puppy eyes were so sad-“
“Everything okay?” Tony asked quietly. Maybe he’d upset Steve again.
Tony felt much better for it. He didn’t argue.
But he's still Steve. Even the way he feels is the same.
“It doesn’t matter. I love you, I don’t care if anyone knows. Right?” He said softly, looking so hopeful, it nearly broke Steve’s heart.
That...that was the question really. Could he see himself with Tony Stark? Could he love this man?
Saturday rolled by and he could safely say things were going well. It was a good morning in the workshop and who needed lunch when he could just order in? Even if Jarvis kept reminding him to take a break.
Steve didn’t say anything to that. Instead he just stared at Tony like he was staring at a complete stranger.
There are reminders everywhere. It only adds to the feeling.
“I remember. Do you realise that? I remember standing there at my parents funeral and thinking over and over about my father’s words! And do you know what he used to say to me!?”
Tony played with idea in his head. He wouldn’t have to hunt as many humans, Steve did seem strong enough and-
Tony’s heart skipped a beat. For a second, he felt like he’d been shot.
Then he tilted Tony's head ever so slightly upwards and breathed his next words against his lips, feeling him shiver.
“Could it wait? I’m a little busy right now.”
So maybe he’d not really given so much thought to Steve’s reaction. Perhaps he should’ve known Steve would feel this way. Werewolves were possessive and Steve had said mates were special and-
He looked angry. Really angry. Whereas Pierce looked just as calm and pleasant as before. He had a wide smile on his face and didn’t seem at all bothered by the simmering man beside him.
“Don’t worry, I’m not stealing this one away. I just want to draw the others out. There’s probably more-“
Thor eyed him carefully before reaching over to pat him on the back. “I am glad you joined us. You fight well for a fledgling.”
Ten minutes went by and Tony was perfectly happy to procrastinate by playing with new ideas on his phone until-
“We got rid of Namor. He wasn’t welcome after what he did.” Strange says and for the first time, Steve is glad to hear him speak. He hasn’t heard his voice in weeks.
“So I smell like a coconut.”
sorry."
“Steve, his heart rate-!”
The voices are distant. He can just about hear them over the bleeping coming from his right. It’s a steady beat that sounds familiar-almost like his-
“I just needed to check that you were alright. You smell fine though.” The wolf sniffed, once again starting to edge towards Tony.
"Is it that urgent?" Maria was surprised, and honestly, Tony was too.
Then his heart sank.
“What do you mean?”
“Take it off.” He repeats. “I want to see the look in your eyes. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me exactly what you were thinking."
“Right.” Tony murmured, feeling uncharacteristically small. He’d really misjudged that one. Obviously Steve would be like that. Hell, the man had taken a nose-dive into the ocean to get to this level of authority. It was only fair people listen to him.
“My smell?” Tony said, feeling his brows rise in alarm.
His name appeared on the glass panel. The door revealed Steve’s gear and various Shield weapons. Guns, hoods, uniforms and all sorts of wonders were there.
His mouth watered a little. His lips parted at the sight.
“Fall backwards, I’ll catch you!” And hoped and prayed that Tony would understand because if he didn’t, Steve would lose him again and-
The body suit concealed any more injuries Tony could’ve had, but when Steve saw his face, he nearly saw red. There was a large bruise on his cheek and finger prints peeking out of his collar. And his hands were shaking by his sides despite the forced control.
Whitney screeched at him and slapped him hard, sending him careening towards the floor. He grunted when the bruise on his back flared once more.
“It is! And that’s exactly my point!” Steve cried out and was about to say more when he suddenly froze. Then he stopped and leaned back in his chair. Calmly, he folded his hands in his lap and smiled tightly, going back to his Commander stance. A reminder for him to behave because Steve was the boss here. Steve made the calls.
“Where’s Rogers?” Fury said, making eye contact with Maria once before running his eye over Tony carefully. If Tony didn’t know any better, he’d say Fury was concerned. Maria didn’t say a word but slipped away with a determined look.
A bitter smile spread over Tony’s face. The man wasn’t wrong.
His feet pushed off the ground, one foot after the other. His arms swung in tandem. Suddenly he was moving faster than some of the cars on the street.
There’s an odd sound coming from somewhere. Someone’s wheezing. Distantly he realizes it’s coming from him and he falls to his knees, cradling the body to his chest.
“Don’t worry. It won’t be long now. I forgive you Cap. That’s all I want to say.”
“They’re probably at the table.” Fury said quietly behind him. “It’ll be fine Stark, stop stressing.”
Steve took a deep breath and exhaled. In contrast to Tony’s nerves Steve looked completely relaxed and at ease with the world. Untouchable. Infallible.
Finally, after spending enough time staring at the reflections on the empty wine glasses, he shook his head and scrubbed at his eyes to stave off the burning. It felt like he’d poured his heart out without even saying a word.
“No. I just saw you on the roof that day and got attached. That’s all.” Steve said, and his eyes softened marginally.
“Yeah. He said I needed to have his scent? Whatever that means.”
He knew what it was. They all did. It just didn’t make sense to him that he’d been the one Steve had chosen. They despised each other. Well...he didn’t despise Steve but Steve certainly didn’t like him, that much was clear.
Steve nodded firmly. “You would be salaried for your time here. Ideally I’d have you staying on the Helicarrier full time until we have enough weapons to have a defense system in place. Once they’re done, we can discuss-“
He feels open and exposed, like a wound scrubbed raw. The grief he’d pushed aside, flares and peaks. He should’ve known better.
“YOU AREN’T HUMAN-“
Well that was odd. It wasn’t like Steve to-
Steve considered him carefully before nodding and opening the door to the limo.
”I think we should stagger the times a bit more. I should get whole days with you Tony, not half days.”
When Tony was younger, he was different. Not massively different to others or anything, but different to how things were now. He was different back then. He’d changed over time.
For a fraction of a second, Tony wants to cry. He’d come so close.
“Y’re really here.” Tony cries softly and watches Steve do the same.
Feeling something dim in the corners of his mind, he held his hands open as she requested and waited patiently for her to hand him something. She gave him an orange juice bottle and gestured to her cheeks.
He’d drifted after that. He didn’t really remember anything after so he suspected he’d passed out. When he came to though, he was met with Steve’s worried face and a decidedly unimpressed doctor. They hadn’t noticed he was waking up because they were busy discussing his health apparently.
“Were you...trying to get close to me?” Tony’s eyes widened because that was definitely the shuffle of a man caught red handed. And Steve’s eyes couldn’t be any wider.
He felt sick. He felt numb. And above all, he wanted Steve.
The door swings open quickly and before he knows it, hands spin him around and pull him close against a firm chest. Rogers wraps his arms around him and holds him tightly, gently nuzzling his hair.
This wasn’t the same. It wasn’t like humans. This was different-it drove Tony
The conversation continued for twenty minutes more and with every minute, Tony thought Steve became more relaxed. The tension in his shoulders was loosening and he seemed to be happy to listen to Tony’s ramblings. Dare he say, it was nice.
"But I was the one who-!" Tony cut himself off when Steve shook his head, and Tony knew Steve had to get whatever it was, off his chest.
Slowly he closed the door behind him, suddenly realizing that his eyes were wet.
Tony shifted in his seat and frowned a little to himself. “Right.”
Still. It was nice of her to ask. He hadn't expected anyone to actually take to him. Although she just seemed like a decent person so maybe it had nothing to do with him.
“Yeah, okay, sure.” Tony nodded, suddenly feeling more hopeful than he had in months. Before he could help it, his lips spread into a smile.
“Nothing.” Tony said firmly with a careful, tight-lipped smile that fooled even the press.
“You haven’t even spoken to me! Not once!”
“Me? I’m fine. Pfff, totally fine.” Tony finally said, rolling his eyes and looking up at the sky. No full moon tonight either. Go figure.
“What?”
“Steve.” Tony said, suddenly remembering the real reason why they were here. He let his eyes sweep over the streets carefully, feeling his body start to tense. “Why did you really suggest this? This day?”
“Besides.” Ty purrs and pushes his drink towards Tony. “We both know he’s not your alpha. It’s an odd match. You and I make a lot more sense. I mean, he’s Captain America for crying out loud.”
A smooth black zip-up uniform greeted him. It had the yellow Shield logo on the right hand side of the chest and white boots tucked underneath. There were white gloves to match and a set of black communicators all attached to a white belt that Tony assumed would go around his waist. It was strange to picture himself in it but that didn’t change a thing. Commander rule of course.
"Tony-"
“Do you know that bishops can become queen pieces? If played right, the queen can be replaced. But the loss is damaging. Tell me Captain.” Reed turns and looks him dead in the eye. “Does the loss of your Queen bother you?”
"I'm sorry about that morning. I really am. You shouldn't forgive me for that." He said, watching the way the rays washed over Steve's features. It made him look completely golden. Ethereal.
“Burn them.”
His mind went blank when Steve instantly reached out and pressed a hand to his cheek gently. His mouth clamped shut and his whole body froze in shock.
Steve’s eyes shot open and met Tony’s and as soon as he pulled away, Steve spun them both and pinned Tony against the wall, pushing firmly until there was no escape.
“Okay, great.” Tony said eagerly, leaning forward. “So you’re interested in the company. We can definitely work with-“
“S-sorry-“
But he saw nothing. Just the low layer of mist obscuring the blue ground.
“You don’t. That’s why you’re the genius.” Steve said with a soft look in his eyes and Tony silently wondered what he was thinking about.
“I know, it’s pretty sad right?”
“Right!”
"Has anyone seen the commander!?" Tony exclaimed, grasping the arm of a nearby agent who grunted and made to shove him off.
Silently, Steve unscrewed the cap, careful to avoid bursting the bottle and slid a hand under Tony’s shoulder, lifting him to guide the drink to his mouth.
“Me. It’s not their fault.”
A gunshot fired and Tony’s whole body erupted. Body writhing in pain, his boots cut off and he fell to the floor feeling dazed.
What he saw surprised him.
“Perfect. You have eyes on the target?”
“Paw patrol?”
They felt sore. There was a hint of iron and pine on his tongue.
“Jarvis, send Fury a message for me. Ask him what the dress code is for the event please?”
If Steve was here, he’d have probably made him turn back round. Tell him he can’t just keep ignoring others. But Steve’s not here. Tony’s all that’s left-the forgotten remains in an empty house. Steve was the substance and he was always extra.
Pepper had been right all along.
"How dare you act like you're any better than us!? When you waltzed in here like you own the place?" Ben snarled and stormed up to him, jerking a finger at him viciously. Instinctively, Tony tensed, mentally bracing for a fight.
“Back off Steve. You’re not my mother.” Tony grunted, rubbing at his eyes tiredly. Then he turned at looked at the man he loved.
The first; that it was the complete opposite of the cavern. It was warm and brightly lit, with earthy browns and reds and modern furniture that was laid out in a homely way.
What better way to put an end to his life than this? What better way to make sure no one suffers because of him again?
Either way, Tony couldn’t deny he was curious to know more. What kind of person would have Pureblood Prime Vampire Ezekiel Stane on the back foot? The man must have been something else to have Zeke retreating. Tony couldn’t even begin to imagine it.
Instead of answering, Steve hummed lightly and smiled politely at some of the cameras, lifting his free hand to wave. He didn’t look at Tony but urged them both forward purposefully.
“You disrespectful little shit! Don’t you see I’m dealing with-“
What had he said? That Steve was messy?
“Of course Commander! As soon as you reconsider my offer! I just want Stark, that’s all-“
Then he tilts his head and nods. “Hi team. Reed, hi.”
Watching from behind, Tony folded his arms and looked around briefly. Steve had just started to get to the base which meant that Tony was able to watch Steve’s location on the huge holo screen at the front of the room.
“Zeke, please.”
Steve! You're right about me, about everything you said. I'm not a good person and being with me is like...being trapped. You don't want to be with me."
“Am-am I-d-did you-?”
Tony drops his hand and shakes his head with a soft laugh.
“He’s gonna be okay?”
There was something Fury wasn’t saying. His shoulders were tense like he was expecting an attack, and his gaze kept darting back and forth between their surroundings and him. Fury kept looking and him with such a stressed look that Tony almost felt like asking if there really was a fight coming.
He took a deep breath and continued to follow Ben.
“Ow. Fuck OW!” Tony hissed, grabbing his hand and squeezing his eyes shut as pain shot through his arm. What the hell had he been thinking?
“I like to keep an eye. On the things that are important to me.” Steve said firmly, nostrils flaring as he calmed down. Tony warmed at the words though, even if he knew Steve didn’t mean it the way Tony wanted.
“I don’t know. He’s here somewhere-Steve, where are you-!?”
He never stuttered.
“There’s so much we’re not saying here Steve. I can’t just leave my work to work here! I have my own work too you know!” Tony pressed, knowing, just by the growing frown on Steve’s face, that he didn’t have a clue about the pressure he was under. He couldn’t, no wouldn’t walk out now.
Again, the burning desire to throw something at someone increases and briefly, Tony eyes the empty brown bottle by his feet. But then it simmers for a moment and finally dies back down.
“WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?” Steve roars, feeling like he was about to have a fist-fight coming his way. He didn’t understand; Reed was never like this.
"Tony. What the hell happened?"
“M’ in a hospital...” Tony croaks and suddenly breaks into coughs. His throat and nose feels sore and his head is pounding under the cold tube lights hanging above. His vision hazes for a moment until he can clearly make out Steve’s expression completely.
It’s Ty’s turn. For a moment Tony’s heart sinks.
“W-what? We’re not...bonded.” Tony parsed out, barely able to make sense of it. His fingers itched to touch the mark again.
“Shhh Tony, shhhhh.” Steve tried, squeezing Tony’s wrists gently in an attempt to ground him. It failed miserably when Tony felt a severe cramp in his abdomen and twisted onto his side to curl inwards. His hands trembled and his skin and clothes were soaked in sweat. His glazed eyes hid beneath his pale lids, which only added to the horrible sunken look they had. Weeks of sleep deprivation wasn’t helping Tony.
But after those few days, Steve approached his bed and folded his arms with a knowing grin.
Putting his shield back, he used his hands to wave away the mist.
“Great.” Steve beamed and Tony almost gaped at the sheer one-eighty. It was even worse when he saw the shit-eating grins on his new team-mates faces when he cast them a horrified glance.
“That’s...well if you’re sure. Oh, is it because you’re not sure with the mark?”
Life as an Avenger in the 21st century was never dull. Since waking up from the ice, Steve had begun a life unlike any other. Meeting the best team of superheros and being able to do his part to keep the world safe was a privilege. He couldn’t be happier...
A short silence dragged out loud enough for Tony to hear the tumbleweed scraping the floor.
The comment made Steve pause. Something changed in his stance and his eyes narrowed a little.
It’s too much. Tony feels like the rope he’s been balancing on has snapped. He’s fallen deep into the depths and he’s sinking and Steve’s here to push him down further.
Strange’s eyes are red rimmed, Steve notices. The tremors in his hands are even more pronounced as they come up in a surrender.
“Stark. Thank you for coming.” Steve finally said, placing his pen down with a quiet tap. Then slowly, he leaned back in his huge chair and inspected Tony carefully with a masked expression. Tony couldn’t make heads or tails of it but he knew from just the look alone that he was not forgiven.
It’s somewhat quiet this time of morning. There’s a peace that Tony gets that is always made better by this time. He was always asleep during this time before. Now he gets why Steve goes for his early morning runs.
“But I...” He couldn’t believe it. There had to be some mistake. Some-
Mealtimes had been…well this week they hadn’t been great. He’d attempted to join the team for breakfast, but found they varied their breakfast times each day (or maybe they all just had such hive mind, they all got up in perfect synchronization. It fit perfectly with his theory that they were all wasps). He’d tried to join at lunchtimes at the start of the week, and quickly found they had no space for him at the table anymore (that woman who’d allowed him before had disappeared), and it was the same for dinners. So he’d done the sensible thing.
Stars did not talk back after all.
A frown appeared on Steve’s face. “So there are some vampires that aren’t...born as vampires?”
Absently he reaches down and unlocks his other gauntlet and takes comfort from the very thing he’s always turned to in moments like this. His own private little secret that he’s kept close. He brings his wrist up and stares once more.
“Tired. Shakey. My head really hurts.” Tony admitted, dropping his head into his hands as the energy left him. He felt drained but that was nothing new.
Tony didn’t have even a second to react. Just as the words passed his lips, Steve had sauntered over to him and had wrapped an arm around his waist, physically pulling him towards the bike. Once close enough, Steve bracketed Tony against it, peering at him carefully. He leaned close enough for their breath to be shared and Tony was forced to look up.
“So you cast him out.” Steve says, like they haven’t just told him what he’d been hoping for. It adds to his question. “So that explains Namor but what about To-Stark?”
“Of course, of course. But, ah-“ Pierce took a sip of his drink and smiled knowingly. “Let me know when you get another badge. Might be a little harder these days. There’s just so many young men and women like you, it’s a hard job to decide who gets it.”
“Nothing.” Tony muttered and gently lifted the covers of the bed up. Then to Steve’s absolute horror, he bit his lip and sniffed.
“Sir, incoming call from Agent Hill.” JARVIS interrupted and Tony glanced at the small square image of Maria on his HUD.
And there was nothing. No marks on his legs, or ankles or even the base of his feet.
“H-hey-“ His throat closes and he starts to cough, feeling the dust on his face. It itches but thankfully when he pats at his cheeks the skin doesn’t fall away. It does surprise him though. He doesn’t remember taking his cowl off.
anymore, let alone heard.
“I do care. You know I do.” Steve said sharply, losing just a hair of that calm composure for a moment. “I’ve always cared when it’s comes to you.”
He would take the plates afterwards and wash everything up without so much as a quip and would always promise to make more the next time.
“You look really good. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in these colors. They suit you.” Steve said, and in a sudden bout of excitement maybe, he reached out and caught Tony's wrist in his hands. Tony resisted the urge to fidget as he tilted his wrist and inspected the watch under the light.
Tony coughed quietly against the sharp stone, feeling the vibrations of foot-steps banging on the ground. He thought he heard a woman screaming and the sound of fists swinging in the air. There was also a strange noise of something wet sticking to the walls, and swooping noises.
There was only one reason he could think of.
A question has been budding however, soft as a whisper in the dark recesses of his mind. Today he finally musters up the courage to ask because it hasn’t gone away, not since that first truce with the Illuminati.
The day flew by after that. He worked diligently on the calculations, ensuring every single one was right. He must’ve worked at triple speed because when he looked up at the clock, he’d realised he’d worked for hours. It was just past five in the evening. He’d missed lunch but it had been worth it.
“No. I really haven't-"
The door slid open and they made their way to Tony’s bedroom. As soon as they were in and Jarvis turned on the lights, Steve folded his arms and nodded.
“Your eyes look better pet. More red. More...natural.”
“Who cares?” Tony laughed bitterly. “It’s not like I’ve seen him this evening. And he’s busy.”
Pulling back, he grit his teeth together and shoved her against the wall, pressing her face into the rough bricks. Thankfully she froze.
He could see the stress on everyone’s faces. In the tension on their shoulders and the clenches of their jaws. These people were starting to worry too.
“Loud and clear Cap.” Nat’s voice crackled and Steve let out a breath.
“Stark.” She nodded and glanced at his circle of escorts that were quickly growing bored. “Edmund. Any issues?”
“-I’m telling ya, he’s a good one. Kind soul. And when Stevie runs head first, this one will keep him in line, I can see it. He’s gonna bring the best out in him, just you wait and see.”
There’s no point waiting after all. He might as well celebrate it.
“Something wrong?” Steve asked without even looking up. Tony was obviously still not...comfortable yet so he didn't want to draw any attention to the role-reversal.
He likes Steve. He
What would it be like? Would it be better than
“The couches are for us. When he gets older, we can shift them out and change the furniture. But I figured for now, it’s a good thing.”
Tony still felt unsure about it all. “I don’t know if I’m even gonna take you up on this. Or if I should.”
“Led Zeppelin.” Both alphas say at the same time and Tony smiles a little.
"I have loved you-"
Blearily, he tried to sit up. His elbows shook as he levered himself up.
Thor, the literal
Tony couldn’t stop smiling. He could feel his fangs expand with excitement. Today had been the best day of his life!
“Well, it was the commander’s request to I suppose he does, sir.”
“He...said that?” Tony tilted his head and tried to picture it. And somehow...
“I hope so my lord. I really do.”
Silently, Tony took the glass and drank until his throat burned. Once again, he got the distinct impression they were worried. Still, he didn’t stop until the whole glass was empty.
"You're alive." Tony whispers and watches Steve settle into the bed with him. The bed dips when he lies beside him, and Tony can feel the heat coming off him instantly. It really is Steve. He really is
“Do what?”
“That’s a low blow, don’t you think?” Tony said quietly, but glared at Ben with eyes that burned with rage. He didn’t come here to be insulted and he didn’t need to take that kind of crap from anyone.
and Tony seized the chance instantly. However good he was, he’d always been more stubborn than most, even to the prime.
“Captain.” Steve turned to Strange. “I'll do a full check up later but I really think someone should stay with him tonight. It would be good to help him feel more grounded and maybe if one of his closest friends stayed with him while he slept-“
“So you see that mummy there? The huge one with the helmet? That’s Thor. He’s my wrestling buddy. He’s not from around here but he’s learned to adapt pretty well. Makes a good member of the team.” Steve said proudly and something about the phrasing made Tony pause.
He doesn’t want his baby to lose their father. Or for his alpha to be hurt.
And Steve had been...fun. And that in itself was an enormous feet.
“Tony-“
He was breathing heavily and he could see Nat and Bruce and Thor eyeing him from behind Clint, a few feet away. The crowd of people recording were now muttering to each other and there was no doubt everyone had heard every single word. Every little piece of himself he vowed to never share.
“Hmmm.” Tony tilted his head and returned to his position of leaning over the balcony edge. Steve didn’t copy him this time but instead leaned with his elbow and kept his body facing Tony’s, and really that was just unfair since Steve looked far too good in the shirt and jeans that it was making Tony feel a little bit uncomfortable around his own pants-
Without wasting a second, Norman banged on the door and shouted; “Zeke! I’ve brought your pet like you asked! Better be quick though, his eyes are starting to go!”
His eyes glazed over. Voices became background noises.
“You do Tony.” Steve insisted and when Tony looked at him, he noticed weary blue eyes looking back.
Tony had never felt more shocked. As soon as he left the quarters he couldn’t help but clap a hand over his mouth in awe.
It’s when Steve touches Tony's cheeks that he breaks. There are trails of tears on Tony’s cheeks, still damp and shining.
Taking off his helmet and putting it aside, Tony took a deep breath and followed Steve to the ball pit. The whole areas had soft play items like green cubes and blue triangles, and there were plenty of mats for kids to play on. And at the back was a dark green net surrounding a brightly coloured ball pit. That was where they went.
“Reed. Come in.” Steve says quietly, feeling that familiar stone settle in his gut. Ever since the confrontation, he has felt this heavy weight, large and unyielding in its quest to pull him down. It’s ugly and nasty and makes him cruel, and these days have given him time to think about it.
For a moment, Fury said nothing. He just stared at Tony with a blank look. Then, his frowned deepened and harsh shadows clouded his expression. His gaze darted to the stain on Tony's shirt.
Tony’s fangs expanded completely. His mouth opened slowly. Then he pressed his lips to Steve’s neck and sunk his fangs in. Fresh, life-giving blood filled his mouth and then-
He was...fine. Not a scratch on him. His muscles felt achy and his waist and arm looked a little more pink than usual but...
“What kind of thing?”
“Oh god...
“My lord? What’s...” By mistake, Tony stepped on something that caught his eye. Then he bent down and picked it up.
Not really registering, Tony felt his lips move and then felt the Doctor grip his shoulders and lie him down on the plastic covers gently. Once Tony was completely flat, the man slipped a strange device with a plastic tip into his ear and held. The device beeped loudly in Tony’s ear and if he hadn’t been so detached, it would have startled him.
“Can you take Peter, Tony? Just hold him, just for a moment.” Steve says softly, and at Tony’s tired nod, places the squirming pup in his arms. The pup continues to whine but the cries die down. Within seconds, the pup calms and gazes up at Tony again, seeming fascinated once more.
“You can’t. But I appreciate the offer Mr. Stark.” Steve said lightly, tearing the peel off one of the bananas. “It’s not something I'd expect you to understand unfortunately.”
“Be ready for three. I’ll pick you up and take you.”
“Tony, stop taking pictures and get in here!”
“Shut up-“
. You may not remember everything, but even you know you’re a bad liar.” Steve scowls darkly and folds his arms, and for once, Tony is thrown by the alpha. Steve’s never called him out like that before.
“Thankyou. It’s really great.”
“How long until we’re done here?” Tony asked finally, balancing the now empty glass in one hand. His mind felt sluggish and fed up. Drained from the amount of revelations that had happened over evening.
With a huff, Maria tugged him around and guided him forward with a hand pressed against his back. The resounding footsteps followed him as he was frogmarched to the door. One of Maria’s underlings knocked and moments later, the opaque glass door slid open.
“I have to take care of my responsibilities. You happen to be a part of that. That includes what people say.”
Steve stared at Tony like he was a completely new person.
The words hit him like a slap. Sharp and directed, they completely stopped every thought and yanked him away from the edge. What the hell was he
“What does it matter!? We’re on opposite sides anyway-!”
“Okay!” Tony claps his hands quickly, trying to hide how much he’s shaking right now. “ I have no idea which of you it is. Or if either of you is even the father.”
“You’ll come back home? Back to me?” He says, even louder and Tony wonders if Steve even knows what he’s saying.
“Is there anything you want to say to us before we start?” Steve says because at the end of it all, he’s still a Captain. He’s still leader of the Avengers. There are some things that shouldn’t change.
The realization made him groan and the sheer feeling of Steve beginning to lavish him with kisses made him dizzy. It took everything in him not to beg for more.
“Okay, you know what? Let’s all just go home and-“
“I won’t. For once I won’t ask too much and do as I’m told.” Tony grinned at Steve’s raised brow, and brought Steve’s hand to his mouth, pressing a kiss to his palm. “Promise, commander.”
“Everything will be taken care of. Rogers will come and collect you an hour before with a driver and you’ll both arrive as a pair. For the first twenty minutes, let Rogers greet all the other guests and let him introduce you formally. After that, you can talk to some of the other guests, mingle and eat, dance for a while and then if you feel tired, head home. Rogers has agreed to take you back if you want to leave early. He’ll keep an eye on you.”
The lift kept going until he reached the quarters. Luckily no one was around and so he walked straight through the living area, and set his eyes on his bunk bed.
He shrugged and chose to focus on keeping his hands still. They were shaking in his lap.
Everything stopped. For a moment there was complete silence as the whole room went quiet. Only the film could be heard and somehow even that had become quieter.
The small square bathroom had only one mirror but it was well lit and there was a hook on the back of the door. Setting the case down, Tony took off his suit jacket and hung it up. Then he removed his tie, belt and shoes and put those aside too.
“Some of the instructions might be in Russian. Or Portuguese-“ Steve’s eyes started to crinkle as he watched Tony quickly rummage through the bag, taking some of the orange bottles out to stare at them like they were gold-dust. Some of the corners of the labels were peeling away but somehow, Steve didn’t think that would matter.
This was unacceptable. Tony and thousands of others had been brought down to...to
Putting every ounce of strength into his legs, and every bit of time he’d spent building up his muscles outside, he pushed forward and bolted for the exit. Sweat trickled down his forehead as he listened out for Zeke’s reaction.
“So.” Tony spun on his heel and faced the non-plussed soldier, forcing himself not to react when Steve still handed the car keys to the guards to retrieve the car. “Care to explain what that was about?”
He isn’t ready.
Bucky and Nat looked at each other before turning to Steve.
“You’re not much of a talker are you?” Gabe said quietly, not shifting, even when Tony looked at him. “I bet that’s Howard’s doing right there.”
“Piss off! Don’t need the likes of you here!”
Slowly, he made his way through the buttons of his white shirt. Once he pulled it off, the pants went next and finally, he pulled out the Shield uniform and began to tug it on.
At that, Tony looked away and focused on the sky blankly.
“Well it’s your name on the letter isn’t it?”
“Whatever it is, we’ll figure it out. This is our chance. Let’s take it.”
“He’s a good kid, I promise. He’s being difficult I know, but that lass doesn’t have a chance.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well,-“ Steve’s eyes gleamed over his mug. “Guess it’s time for you to let someone else look after you for a change.”
“You’re not wrong there. What about you?”
“Whitney, you need to listen to me.” Norman urged, letting his eyes search the growing crowd of vampires. The young vampires, a gathering of twenty or so, black haired and pale-skinned beings were all watching, crowding against the far wall to observe the impending fight. Nervous whispering filled the room, slowly growing in volume, the longer this played out. Even the twins were watching, chattering quietly between themselves at the sight.
“Hit the road!”
A sharp tap echoed throughout the cavern and instantly Tony turned, eyes darting towards the darkness of the caves. They were back. Ezekiel was back.
“Well you always enjoy these sorts. Frankly, I find the screaming distasteful.” Norman said lightly, observing his nails with a half-closed gaze.
sorry. If It wasn't for me, you would've still be alive. You wouldn't have-"
“Steve tells me you get up early to spend time with him. And we all know you hate early mornings.”
Humming his agreement, he focused on his screen and turned so as to follow the path. He was above trees now, and could see the warehouse up ahead.
He’d given up on meals. The few pieces of bagel slices and cream cheese from the janitor in the cafeteria was more than enough. It was more for the action itself than the actual food.
“Has anyone ever
“Tony!” Steve gasped and then steeled his gaze and ripped through the robot like tissue paper. Within minutes, the whole robot started to seize and fall.
“Thanks but you should really thank Thor.” Tony pointed out and gestured towards the cackling God in the center of the room. “It was really his idea.”
Plus he didn’t want anyone poking questions about his self imposed celibacy. Something the media and the rest of the world had no idea about.
For everyone keeping an eye, I am definitely still working on The Red String and A helping hand. I was writing for all three WIP's and a second part to an A/B/O fic of mine and this just happened to be the first chap to get finished. The others are next, I promise, and thank you all for being so patient and wonderful and supportive! You are all so lovely and I can't thank you enough :DDD
Confused, Tony frowns and tilts his head. “You kn’w why. M’ drunk.”
Reed doesn’t say a word. When Steve turns, he sees his face is pale as a sheet. Bone-white and horrified.
He decided to look around instead. With a sweeping glance, he noticed that the landing strip was completely empty of planes or any weaponry which was odd since even thousands of feet up in the air, the Helicarrier was still a target.
He’d been shown the cafeteria which had been teaming with Shield agents and the like. He’d never seen a room that full since the day the Avengers had broken up years ago. It was unlike anything he’d been used to.
Tony jumped off the plane with his four escorts and did his best to smile.
Eyes practically gleaming, Zeke nodded at Tony. “Isn’t that right Anthony?”
Carol shakes her head and sighs. “No. But they’re not heartless. Steve-“ she turns to him and her eyes are pleading. “-don’t...don’t beat them up any more. They’re already down and they were just trying to do what they could. They’re doing the best they can.”
This was unheard of. Tony has never seen Zeke in such a state.
Tony had been all of them.
“What?” Tony jerked his head towards Steve, just in case he’d grown another head. Had he heard that right?
“Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention! The president is about to give his speech so if you could all take your seats, we will begin shortly!”
Tony let his lips curve up. It was getting easier to plaster the smile on his face. “I do. It’s nice to watch the humans squirm.”
To his surprise, Stark barked out in laughter and took a swig of his drink like Steve had made the best joke ever. It didn’t sit right with Steve. No one should laugh like that at a compliment.
“Of course. Sleep well my lord.”
“You’re not okay. You haven’t been okay for a while have you Tony?”
It sounded like a chirp.
Any excuse to keep Fury from guessing.
If he was annoyed before, he was in an awful mood now.
“Anyway I just wanted to see how you were doing. I’m pretty much done with the introductions so...” Steve eyes met his and his lips twitched up. “I’m all yours for the night.”
“Yeah. Vices.” Steve sighed and blew out a breath. Then he turned and started to walk back out onto the main road.
(He was afraid. He wanted to find out but what if he was attacked? What if they hurt him and took his supplies? What if they just left him to die?)
“Indeed.”
“Don’t hesitate. If you need me, come find me. Okay?”
“No. But this isn’t a good thing. And Ty...” Zeke turned away, hiding his face in the shadows. “He’s been delayed.”
The rest of the week went by without a hitch. Tony completed some of the projects, attended plenty of meetings, just as he’d promised (
“What’s that?”
Those were the only things that kept him from giving up completely.
The next morning brought several unpleasant surprises. Within his corner of solitude (as he’d dubbed it), he’d figured he wouldn’t be too disturbed since all the other agents in the team were on the other side of the room. But it had been the complete opposite.
“Cap? I’m ready.”
Steve’s grip tightened. He wasn’t going anywhere, that was for sure.
"That's ridiculous." Tony laughed a little manically. "I think you mean he added me."
From the rubble, the Avengers emerged like the heroes they were. Tony could see not just Carol and Thor, but also Wanda, and the Falcon and several others.
Tony nearly dropped the phone but thankfully Steve caught it and took it away.
Then came the kicker.
“And pray tell, who would I send? Most of the family are far too inexperienced to survive out there.” Zeke said with an unimpressed look but his eyes didn’t leave Tony and Tony counted on that to be his guide.
“I should go.” Maria mumbled, and quickly gathered a stack of sheets and left the room. Tony didn’t take his eyes off Steve, not even for a second.
It couldn’t be that Steve was ready to forgive him. There was no way.
The disappointment was quickly replaced by a beam.
“Well I’m a busy man. Just because I don’t work for you, doesn’t mean I don’t work.” He replied, folding his arms too. He was exhausted from the journey and he didn’t appreciate the tone he was getting. Shield had called him, he came, what more did they expect?
“Tony. Don't.
Tony Stark not recommended. Of course it made sense.
He can’t dare to hope.
“What
Plus Steve knew him. He said he
” Steve roars and suddenly the pup bursts into a fit of wails, and Tony is caught between trying to move and not letting the wave of dizziness pull him down.
With a soft laugh, the air-hostess left him to it and helped get the Shield escorts settled. It was weird to think he was actually going to be a Shield agent, but he’d make it work. Besides, he’d been Director before so how hard could it be? He didn’t have to make any calls, he just had to build. That, he could do.
“Suit yourself.” Ty yawns and rolls over on the couch.
"I spoke to Carol. She said you called yourself a traitor." Steve said, like he was being forced to choke on marbles.
She looked great. Her blond hair was on the long side and her uniform was well maintained. She looked just as radiant and powerful as always.
There was something broken when he looked up at Steve. Steve’s eyes were full of sorrow, and a shadow clouded his features.
"Stark, this isn't funny-"
Steve was still staring at him with laser focus. It looked like he was waiting for him.
Tears leak from his eyes. His throat closes up and threatens to choke him and he hears sobs start to escape from inside. He kneels slowly on the floor and holds the photo frame to his chest as he bends over and weeps for the first time over Steve’s death.
Lips trembled but Tony nodded. His face was ice-white, the red starting to be replaced by a sickly grey-green.
Tony has been wondering. It’s been a few weeks and Ty hasn’t instigated anything like that unless it’s around Steve. Steve has been doing it since day one.
They said nothing for a moment. It was far worse than disappointment.
“As soon as they saw what happened the other day, they asked if they could see you. I told them they could come.”
Suddenly a slow smile spread across his face and he stared at Tony like he was in complete awe. Only it was borderline obsessive. Tony had seen that look before on some of his more personal enemies. It was never a good sign.
Tony doesn't have anything left to say except-
Steve flashed him a smile and leaned back against the bench, stretching his arms out to take up space. “I don’t have one. But I know mates are another thing entirely. Someone does something to your mate-“ Steve made a slow cut over his neck with his finger. “-they’re dead. No questions asked.”
Was that why he couldn’t remember anything before?
Finally Steve spoke, even though his eyes didn’t see him. “What exactly do you mean by that?”
The arm swung out of nowhere. Tony stopped. The team stopped. Everyone stopped.
"I know what you thought." Steve sniffed and shook his head miserably. "You must've thought I hated you. When I don't. I just didn't like that you kept Iron man away from me. Everything else was an excuse."
“Good. Ben, can you show Stark around? Show him the main quarters and labs. Don’t forget the cafeteria and showers.”
Tony stared at the empty space with unseeing eyes.
Steve lifted his head up from where he’d buried it in his hands. His expression was carefully blank as he answered.
“Go on. Open your mouth. I’ll stop you when it’s too much. It’s okay.”
“Confirmed.”
It burned like hell though. Steve had probably been right to tell him to stay away.
After their little discussion, Steve had made it very clear he was okay with the bonding. And after much convincing and a little probing, Tony had also made it clear.
Tony could already tell he’d pissed Maria off. “You realize it’s not me who wants you here right? It’s not my orders. They come from higher up.”
Iron man went quiet for a moment, letting the wind continue to fill the void for them. When Steve looked at him, he felt the arm around him tighten just a fraction.
“Oh grow up. I just said what you wanted to hear. Now stay out of my way. I don’t need you holding me back. We’re done here.”
"It's going great." Tony said with a tight-lipped smile, and shrugged despite Steve's scrutinizing stare. "Just like old times."
Steve had never seen Stark cry. In fact, he’d barely seen Stark around since the day he’d made that comment. But here Stark was, nursing a half full glass of whiskey and ice, as covering his mouth with one hand as he sobbed. It was awful.
The clerk sighs and hands him the bottle-a cheap brown brandy bottle with simple labeling that Tony’s too hazy to read-and raps his nails against the scratched wooden desk.
“He shouldn’t have done that!” Tony snarled and yanked his hand away from Clint. “He has a mate to think about!”
Tony was silent again. Steve couldn’t resist massaging his neck a bit more. Anything to mellow down the thick scent of lingering fear.
“Of course...” Steve turned and looked at the ceiling feeling something stir in his stomach. “Wouldn’t want Captain America escaping on your watch huh?”
“It is. They should be here soon.”
If he told Fury, it would only confirm what he thought, which would just be completely humiliating. And if he didn’t, Fury would just keep prying. So where was the middle ground?
Obviously, he knew they would try and screw with him initially. He saw that coming.
-?" Steve gasps and sobs and can barely string a sentence together without breaking and Tony's stomach curdles. This isn't right. Steve shouldn't be this upset.
“You’re not a killer at all are you?” Steve smirked, looking like he’d solved the biggest puzzle of all.
“He’s alive! Cap, he’s alive-!”
Steve was there too. And he was looking proud as ever, standing tall at the front as he led his team to victory.
He steps up to Tony and looks into the yellow eyes of the helmet. Behind them, he pictures fear.
Clint gave him an odd look but went back to his checking. “Yeah, of course.”
“I couldn’t complete the claims this time. I thought I heard someone.” Tony sighed, turning his tired eyes to Zeke with reluctance. Admitting that, didn’t make his night any better. He’d hardly done any favors tonight and hearing that-
Simply put, he didn’t care anymore.
“What do you have in mind?”
“I said hit the road! You’re messin’ up the wall!”
“You should see yours.” Steve smiled and at Tony’s puzzled look, he rolled him over gently until he was on his stomach and reached for Tony’s phone on the bedside table. A few clicks and then Steve let him roll back.
“No.”
The corridor is pitch black. The man standing in front of him is half masked by the shadows.
“What are you planning?” Bucky asked and Steve shook his head.
Tony choked on his drink, feeling like he'd just taken a direct hit to the stomach. When he pulled it back, he coughed and spluttered all over the place, feeling his chest wheeze in shock. Where the hell had that-
“They coming. I just checked and the inspector says he’s on his way.”
“I don’t care!” Tony screamed and the anger completely disappeared off Steve’s face at the reaction. “You’re hurt and it’s all my-“
, on a team with several others-
Tony swallowed and paused. Then he crept forward and edged closer, finally settling on a stool by the table. His eyes homed in on the long sweep of neck Steve was showing.
As much as he hated to admit it, he enjoyed talking to someone else. It was nice to be treated like a person rather than a pet.
“The armor would keep running for as long is the power held, not opening for any command except one. Perhaps Tony created the time-limit, we’re unsure. But we know he chose it’s purpose for one reason.”
Maybe he could’ve been more once. Maybe he could’ve had something greater to offer. The world would never know now, not while he stayed in this cavern.
“M-me?” Tony stammered and palmed the letter in his hand several times over. Fury raised a single brow and gestured to the quickly crinkling paper.
“Agent thirteen?” He glanced past Tony’s shoulder and scanned the dance floor. Then something flashed in his eyes and he turned and fixed Tony with a grin. His expression was sympathetic.
The local pay area had called the Avengers early in the morning to beg for help. Apparently some kid had gotten into the ball pit first thing and had started crying because the balls had come to life. And when the owner had gone to investigate, they’d noticed some strange, well,
Tony stared at him.
"Forget the SHRA. Forget everything for a minute." Steve says quietly and hugs him again gently. "You didn't even grieve, did you?"
”Tony!”
“So when will you tell your soulmate? You know who they are right?” Nat asked with a slight smile. When Tony glanced at her, her smile widened.
Steve sat back down and calmly reached for the tablet he’d been using to read the news.
“Cap.” Tony groans lightly and thankfully he goes silent and settles for walking beside him to his bedroom. Behind them, Ty is busy arguing with Jarvis.
“Why did you invite me? Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate it but we all know I’m the worst choice.” Tony held up his hands in surrender. It was all true, everyone knew it.
The furrow in Steve's brow loosened. He bit his lip and sighed.
He reaches for his pocket once again. He can’t feel his fingers so he can’t feel the card.
“Am I...am I bait?”
Steve raises a brow. “Any idea what it’s about?”
“I'm sorry for pushing you. I'm sorry for not giving you a chance. For judging you too quickly." Steve swallowed around the lump in his throat. He was holding Iron man and he'd made him
“Oh yeah. He was so pissed-“
Tony blew out and breath and watched the pieces fall into place. There was no point. Steve was right.
“Need to get that look off your face.” Gabe said firmly but watched like hawk as Tony stared at him before accepting the napkin. “This is a party. And you’re letting these pigs get to you. As if they’re better than you.”
“Actually.” Tiberius, his future owner, interrupted. “I’d prefer the bonding to be sooner. How about next week?”
“He’s not my boyfriend Sharon.” He said bitterly, feeling his lips curve up into a twisted smile. Oh, it wasn’t that he hadn’t thought about it. It was just that he was tired of seeing their relationship get worse and worse with each catastrophic event that affected the team. Since the SHRA, things had been shambolic and Steve hadn’t even entertained the idea of bringing them together since off course, he’d been assassinated in the process-
His mind flashed to the children. Their huge round eyes, a pale and sickly red as they fought for a bite. He wondered if other factions had similar experiences.
It makes no sense. They're together now. Sure, Tony doesn't remember taking the pills or the drink but he must've done it some time in the night. Maybe he'd simply drifted in his sleep and the ocean had swept him away. Maybe he'd died of a broken heart.
The force of Steve’s stare made him agree. He had to, otherwise Steve would not let this go. “Fine, I promise.”
“And whats the guarantee they’ll work with you? Hell, they might take one look at you and-“
The doctor seemed to frown even more. “You don’t get on with them?”
“So...” Steve said and Tony turned his head to stare at him tentatively. “How was your first day?”
“Easy. He doesn’t care.”
The scent in the room started to grow lighter. A part of him was glad but the other part was suddenly sad. He’d told Tony that over and over before his heat but this proved Tony hadn’t believed it until now. He’d known it but still...
Out of no-where, something came to him, like a remnant of who he was before all of this.
Relief flooded his veins like a drug. It was Steve's voice and he sounded unharmed. Tony almost felt dizzy.
“Don’t do this.” Tony breathed, feeling his hands start to shake. Steve’s hands simply tightened a fraction around his neck. His eyes tracked him with laser focus.
Tony didn’t know what to think. He didn’t even know what to say.
“Of course Captain.”
” He yells and slams his hand on the side of his bed. “How can I be happy!? I don’t want kids! I don’t even have an alpha!”
“It’s a fail safe. What else do you think?” Reed mumbles and Steve sighs and turns on his heel to face him.
“Alright soldier. Hit me, what’ve you got?” Tony sighed and Steve couldn’t help it.
“The Captain believes he has found his soulmate. He believes they have already begun their matching.”
“I think I should do it. It’s only temporary and it’ll get us out of this mess.”
“No problem.”
“Wow...” Tony whispers and snuggles the baby closer, watching the soft blue eyes blink back at him.
“You shouldn't have come here Strange.” Steve says through grit teeth. Thankfully, Strange bows his head compliantly.
“Yeah, that’s fair. But what if I still don’t feel comfortable? I don’t think this is a good idea.”
“Cap.” Tony frowned suddenly and studied the crowd below carefully. “Where is your soulmate?”
When they all headed back a few days later, the trip was silent. Steve had told the others openly what was going on. Steve was going to confirm the bond as soon as they got home.
“Oh hardly. Whitney is a mess. That Captain plagues me Anthony, I swear!”
Just before he left the lab, he turned however, and looked at Tony like he was worse than the dirt he walked on.
“Thanks.” Tony murmured, resisting the urge to gasp as Steve’s thumb brushed over his wrist. The touch sent a hot wave of tingling up his arm and a shiver ran down his spine.
Steve’s eyes narrowed into sharp bluish-grey slits. “No. Why?”
Tony’s whole body felt numb. His entire being went cold as if someone had poured ice over his head. He was looking at her but he almost couldn’t see her. All he could think of was Steve’s soft touches, his smile and the way he’d say something that made Tony feel like he was more.
He smiled the whole way back.
“Maybe. But Tony...”
He continued to unzip the bag and pulled the suit out by the hanger, now holding it up for him to inspect in one go. At first glance it appeared simple but one by one, the details started to emerge. Around the cuffs of the blue jacket, there were two thin lines of silver circling the wrists. And even on the tie there was a faint impression of blue swirls in the material. But along with all of that was the set of cuff links already seated in the suit.
“You do. And they look great. But I have certain requirements and I’d rather you go for your fitting. I’ve told them what I need.”
“Wow.” Tony blew out, for once at a complete loss for words. Ironman? Really?
The light in the room shrunk as the door almost closed. Then-
The room was cozy, and actually looked similar to the room Steve had in the mansion. The king bed lay in the center, and there was a desk with several stacks of paper and some tablets. Bed side tables and lamps kept the room well lit and on the left was two rooms, one, a walk in wardrobe, and the other, an en-suite.
The medics pulled Steve away before he could snap out of his daze. Steve’s hand brushing him as it fell woke him up from the dream scenario he was facing. As he came back to himself he met eyes with Steve who was watching him with a drowsy smile again.
“I haven’t been fair to you. Maybe I was out of line.” Pierce said quietly and took a swig of the drink he’d somehow managed to keep hold of, and then leaned over to double tap it against the bar. Tony watched him carefully, choosing to keep quiet.
“Don’t you already know who your soulmate is?” Nat quizzed for him which Tony was grateful for.
With the other hand, Ty then reaches for his belly. Steve closes a hand around Ty’s wrist before he does.
Steve’s heart stopped. The air left his lungs within seconds.
A dizzying sensation swept over him. His neck pulsed with excitement.
Tony couldn’t stand it. Clenching his fists he stood up and held his hands out to the Cap-tsum by the steps.
"But you don't work with Shield like that." Tony insisted firmly, feeling his fingers curl. "I know him, he's-"
Steve is his alpha. He has to be. The baby’s father would never try and hurt him or scare him like Ty did. It has to be Steve,
For once, Tony felt like he couldn’t breathe.
Steve was asking him to lunch. Steve Rogers, Captain America, was asking him to have some lunch. It was almost like a date. If Tony was being incredibly optimistic and totally delusional. Still, it was a nice thought.
Was every Steve and Tony together in their universes? Even these tiny beings?
Tony scoffed but he knew his cheeks were starting to heat again. To cover, he poured himself a glass of wine and took a sip. When he pulled back, Dugan was silently laughing at him.
The sound was music to Steve’s ears and determined, he tightened his grip on Tony’s chin, holding the needle in place. It wasn’t done yet.
Steve was just watching him and smiling. Not like before or any of those other times where there was a smirk or a laugh. He was really smiling, and it was soft around the edges and full of warmth, while his eyes were dancing with delight and there was a genuine happiness about him. He looked so happy, Tony couldn’t believe his eyes.
As Steve silently approached to fridge, he heard Mr. Stark chirp up from behind him.
Spinning around, Tony tried to hide how much he was blushing. Steve was checking him out, without question.
Just the thought made Tony's stomach turn. Almost unconsciously he shook his head.
"I love you. I'd do anything for you-"
”You know how Steve gets.” Tony explains as he lifts up his head and looks out of the cafe window. There’s couples wandering around holding hands. It’s the right day for it and many are smiling.
But he also talks about big things. His first heat for example. He talks about how Tony had wanted it to not hurt. How he’d asked Steve to be gentle and how he’d said after that he’d never felt safer and didn’t want Steve to stop after the first knot. He’d called Steve kind apparently and they’d not stopped since.
Maybe Fury saw his expression and ignored it. Or maybe he just didn’t realize since he was an excellent actor. Sometimes Tony hated himself.
It’s not fair. He hates it.
God, he wants a drink. He needs it-
“There’s no way in hell I’m letting you go. You’re still recovering and if something happened-“
“S’okay...’m okay...” Tony found himself whispering but Steve shook his head and held him tighter.
Steve was everything. This was everything.
He took Tony’s hand in both of them and pressed his lips to his knuckles.
Steve can’t sleep at night anymore. His dreams haunt him. He feels so alone.
“You disgust me. Your kind live to feed off others and none of you give damn about human life. You know some of us were actually human once!”
“Of course. I understand Captain. For what it’s worth, I am sorry.”
“Unless you don’t want me-“
“Well? How about it?
“Maybe we could...”
There was a moment of silence again. Only this time, when Tony eyed Steve, he noticed a frown appear on his face. The blue eyes dashed in thought.
gonna tell me!?”
“We know, Captain. We’ll do everything we can.”
All of a sudden, Tony’s mind began to form an idea. Just a small, odd, completely unlikely idea that was probably just wishful thinking.
He’d been right. This was a prison. Just one with a pay grade.
“It’s not that!” He snapped and instantly shrank back in his seat while the driver pulled them into the tower back entrance. He was in the middle with Steve on his left and Nat on his right. The others were in the car behind them. Lucky for him since it was already awkward enough.
Tony twisted his face so that he hid it in his shoulder. But he wasn’t shaking as much as before, he was squeezing Steve’s hand hard instead.
"Mhmm. You smell good." Steve said against his neck and huffed before lifting his head and squinting when Tony looked up at him.
“Tony? Hey, you with me?”
The helmet hisses as he pulls it away. And instantly the toxic air fills his lungs.
Tony’s body falls forward. It’s only by sheer instinct, that Steve manages to catch him.
For the first time in months, T’Challa speaks. And what he says, hurts more than seeing Strange cry.
“Oh?” Tony finally lifted his head up. There was a definite aim behind Steve’s next words. Tony braced himself.
He could be strong. He could put Tony’s wishes above his own. He could push aside the intense sweetness, that mouthwatering scent of warm liquid honey, toasted coconut and vanilla, to think for both of them and do the right thing. Steve wasn’t most alphas. He wanted his future with Tony,
That night, when Steve finally returned, Tony was just starting to doze, his body finally feeling relaxed enough to laze. Thanks to Peter, Tony knew every tid-bit of information on The Daily Bugle and the extensive ways in which Peter’s boss, a demon with a severe case of arachnophobia, managed to slay the legendary group of Avengers on an almost daily basis. Tony couldn’t help but wonder if the kid was a secret fan.
This is more than an explanation, Tony thought, but couldn't bring himself to say anything, too mesmerized by the ghost feeling of Steve's lips on his.
The speech continued for some time. President Ford only spoke for about five minutes but the introduction itself had taken a good ten. Tony had paid attention to none of it.
“Well. That didn’t come out easily did it.” Mr. Robinson laughed and leaned back against his chair with folded arms. “I can’t say I’m surprised but who’d have thought the great Tony Stark would come to me on his knees, practically begging-“
It was the right time. Iron man was laughing and happy and completely at ease. Steve had to ask now.
"That was amazing." Tony swallowed thickly, watching as Steve stripped fully, too quickly in his opinion and then gasped when Steve picked him up by his waist and lay him back on the bed gently. When he pulled away, Tony saw him pause and stare at his waist.
“He would also not stop you from doing whatever you want and would never get angry with everyone if, heaven forbid, something happened to you-“
“I think...” It’s so hard to know. If he's tried so hard for this baby, what if he remembers everything and wants to keep this baby. What if he really is happy where he is?
“But...” Tony couldn’t tear his eyes away from the final notes. The signatures and the clear directive. “I thought you...”
. But he never got a name when he encountered Tony. And Tony’s must’ve appeared as soon as they shook hands for the first time. Had Tony been happy
“You’re lucky I saved you-“
The family was not present. The father of the faction, Ezekiel was not present in the cavern at this time and so, as was common, the remaining members of the faction would squabble among themselves in a fit of rage that would only worsen with time. Tony knew it all too well and it was only because he had climbed the ranks, that he was fed enough to prevent that descent into madness.
Only a few weeks ago he hadn’t cared whether he lived or died. And today he was hoping desperately that he hadn’t just signed his own death warrant.
Something's wrong. His ears are ringing, something's
“Tony.” Steve said hoarsely from below him and when Tony blinked blearily at him, he saw Steve on his knees. Steve pressed his lips against his navel and spoke, and Tony was instantly taken back to the first time Steve had slept with him.
“God, don’t-don’t cry Tony. Please, I can’t, not with everything we've discussed.” Steve swallowed, cupping his mouth desperately. “Seeing you like this, it destroys me, I told you.”
Tony prayed Mr. Robinson would hear him out since this would really be his last chance. There weren’t many options left.
“Get him out of here, he’s hyperventilating-!”
“Tony, no, c'mon, I’m alright. I’ll be fine. As long as you’re-“
“Right this way, just follow the signs to the East Room. Enjoy your evening. Sir.” The guard said, and Tony got the distinct impression he was only really talking to Steve. Tony could’ve been dirt on the ground for all he cared.
There'd been a breech. Another one.
“...M’ssed me?” Tony croaked, and though it sounded like his typical sarcasm, Steve could see the shadow of fear in his tired eyes. They seemed so lifeless now and Steve had never hated anything more the Beyonder. God, what if Tony had lost hope and not thought they’d come for him? Surely he’d known?
"I don't think so mister." Steve said eagerly, feeling excited. "I'd recognize that aftershave anywhere. Do you drink a lot of coffee?"
So on one particular night, about two months after Steve’s death (
Never one to be phased, Tony nods and slips his hand into his pocket and pulls out the change. Then he stops and stares.
“I do actually.” Steve said, inspecting his wrist carefully, pulling it close to his nose. He glanced at Tony and then pressed a kiss over his pulse point.
"I'm sorry too. I should've seen you were hurting. That's on me." Steve swallowed then looked at him with a fire in his eyes. "Never again."
Steve was one person Tony didn’t want to upset right now. He didn’t want to be reminded of his failings and step on any toes. He just wanted to do whatever it was Steve needed and be done with it. The longer he stayed here, the more he’d miss his old life, and lament the decisions he made, even if he couldn’t remember them.
“You never talk to me. You don’t even come down to the communal floor. Hell, you don’t even talk to me at meetings.” Steve sighed and Tony almost wanted to say something he’d regret because Steve didn’t know that he had trouble fitting in. That he was soulless. That people didn’t like him, not this perfect picture of all things good.
“Steve? Steve. I need you to look at me-“
“I can guess who said that. Believe me, he’s not all he’s cracked up to be.”
“Steve?”
“I...well-“ Stark took a deep breath and swallowed, looking a little lost, and really Steve didn't blame him. “My best friend...he asked me to do something I couldn’t do. Because he wouldn’t be my best friend if I did it.”
went to MIT?” Steve asked, staring at Tony with shocked expression.
“Allow me.” Steve said softly and brushed his hands away to start unbuttoning Tony’s shirt. Swallowing, Tony licked his lips to moisten them and looked away. Steve was so close he could feel his heat against his skin.
“Excellent!” Zeke turned and beamed at the line up. His eyes hovered over Tony.
It was unfair, he knew. Sometimes it was just hard to accept that Steve really had moved on so easily. While he was still stuck in the past, trying desperately to get close. Wasn't that what this was?
“Steve!” Tony screeched and once again began to fidget but didn’t get far because of the cuff-like grip on his hands. Without wasting any time, Steve forced Tony back down until his was flat on his back and let go to shove the blanket edges into Tony’s sweaty palms. Reflexively, Tony held on and scrunched up the fabric tight, fingers so forced they would’ve dug marks into Tony’s palm if there was no cushioning.
“I’m sorry Tony.” Steve exhaled, suddenly dropping his head in his hands. “That...I didn’t mean to lose it there.”
He thinks, and slowly blinks his eyes open. The sluggish feeling starts to recede, leaving him faintly aware of someone gripping his hand tight. And as he starts to clear his eyes, he sees a familiar face staring down at him and blue eyes-so blue, he can’t help but breathe. The doctors are still working below the sheet and he can’t feel anything but a faint tugging sensation but an anesthetist is watching over him and along with him...
“Well...I have some questions about this party. I don’t actually know what I’m supposed to do.”
Tony frowned at the choice of words while Maria glared.
And then he told Steve everything. About Whitney and Norman and Zeke and the bonding and Ty-
"How would you feel if I was the one that took three bullets because I thought it would help you?"
The shield, where the hell was the shield? Suddenly he spotted Ben looking caught in the crossfire between some agents from another department and the robot. Towards his right was the shield.
He doesn’t know how much time passes but the scent of vanilla hits him first. Then apples and a hint of leather. Voices start to come back next. Then he hears one right above him.
“Get him away-!”
A part of Tony wanted to beg Fury to stay. It couldn’t really be that Pierce wanted to apologize to him? There had to be an insult in there somewhere?
With a nod, Steve took out his keys and leaned over his bike. “You need some food. Plenty of rest too I guess.” The lights turned on and the ignition kicked in. Steve revved it a few times and inclined his head.
“What-no! You’re not fat.”
“Hmmm.” Tiberius said, not giving anything away. His lips were pressed tightly together as his eyes looked Tony up and down patiently. He lingered around Tony’s neck.
Tony didn’t really know what to say to that. Except...
“I can understand you.” Grant said, only it came out as more of a question. His eyes lingered on the star on Steve’s chest. It looked so...so...
“Anyway, I think I should leave you to it. Wouldn’t be fair of me if I kept him all to myself. Enjoy, I’ll speak to you all later.” Pierce said and with a final pat, his hand slid off Tony’s back and he walked away.
"Please Carol, just-" He took a shaky breath and to his horror, tears began to build up in his eyes. "Just leave me alone. I'm fine, I promise."
Steve didn’t care. He didn’t care
“So I’ve been wondering about something. I wanted to know if you’d be up for giving it a try.”
Suddenly he spotted something. Over in the distance, far in the midst. A ship, just beginning to appear over the horizon.
They were out in the open this time. Just the sand beneath their feet and none of the Beyonder’s gimmicks. No fortress or morphing walls or ways for the Beyonder to make a quick escape with Tony. And this time Tony was completely free from any Iron man equipment. He was only wearing a skin tight white body suit and Steve recognized it instantly as a white version of his black under-suit. In the past, Steve had adored the neon lines on Tony’s body, often envisioning a moment where he’d trace them carefully, before ripping the whole thing off and making Tony his. Now the Beyonder had turned that into a mockery too.
“Tony.” He heard behind him and swore when he jumped in his seat a little. The starstruck glow in Jeremy’s eyes told him all he needed to know.
There was a pause. “We went to Central Park. We had some food and you kept talking about how busy it was. We talked pack and how people always bonded in your days.”
Steve wanted to laugh at that. Even Sharon was telling him. He needed to snap out of it. For Tony’s sake-
"It's fine. I understand." Tony said quietly too and shook his head, feeling lighter than before. Something felt right again. He had hope that things would get better.
“Gave me a scare there Tony.” Steve says glancing once at the monitor before looking back down at him. “But you’re okay now. You're doing great, we’ve got you.”
“Come now! I’m just grateful you could make it all! I’m immensely grateful old friend.” Zeke said and gestured to the line.
“I’m in love with you. I’ve been in love with you for some time-“
Steve’s eyes were glistening with intent. They seemed bright and full of focus, just as his position implied. He was leaning forward on the table, with both hands clasped in front. His sharp gaze was fixed on Tony like he was a target and his lips were curved up ever so slightly upwards. He wasn’t smiling but it was a close thing.
“Steve, please.” Tony presses a hand to his temples and massages them tiredly. Steve keeps bringing this point up. This is the third time this week.
The human, a young male with dirty brown hair and small features, squirmed in his grip, desperate to escape this depiction of hell. Tony scoffed at the attempt and merely bit harder into his neck, feeling his body thrum with the fresh intake of blood. He hadn’t felt this alive since he’d first died.
He'd screwed up somehow. Steve’s eyes were hard stones of sapphire. Gone was the calm, relaxed Avenger and instead, the Captain who annihilated Nazis and sacrificed his life for the country was back. Suddenly Steve looked so frustrated and no amount of him stepping back could change the way Steve was simmering.
“No, I didn’t know.” His voice came out muted and he wanted to curse himself for being so obvious but heaven help him, he couldn’t shake this all encompassing feeling of sadness. He just felt so...so
It took every ounce of strength to push himself forward. He flew across the room and tried not to cry out at the feeling of his stitches pulling. Luckily Steve had his eyes on whatever was behind him.
“So if he’s not interested in you, who is he interested in then, according to you?” Pierce asked curiously.
Then something strange happened. She smiled and nodded.
“...What is wrong with you?” Steve says, feeling stunned. Is this how far Tony is from reality now? Has he lost his mind?
“You’re right Tony.” Rogers says softly and in the dim light of the bathroom, Tony can see Rogers looking so upset. “Your alpha loves you so much. They’d do anything to keep you safe.”
But maybe this could be his new start. Maybe he could find his place amongst these people. There were so many groups and maybe he could find companionship amongst these men and women. Something like what he’d had before, even if it was just an ounce of that.
The sound that came out of Steve's mouth was almost a growl, and determined, he went for Tony's neck again. With a groan, Tony reached up and sunk his fingers into Steve's hair, tugging sharply when Steve pressed his lips under his jaw.
“Steal it?” Steve’s eyes flashed with rage as he nearly pushed past John’s hands. “I was the one who brought you here in the first place!”
“Can’t you stay for even a little while? We can get a milkshake with one of those neat bendy straws.”
“Wait a minute. I know you.” The man frowned and had a good look at Tony. He was close enough for Tony to simply lean down and bite but...
“An opportunity for you to get hurt. I don’t want you going through the motions of trying to get close to Steve, only to be told there’s no hope.”
Eventually they finished up dinner and the waiters came to take everything away. Meanwhile, Tony heard Gabe mention something to Dugan.
He needed to be so much more careful. For all that the mutt irritated him, he was a werewolf and could easily make his life a living hell. Wolves tended to work in groups or ‘packs’ and often drew attention to themselves with their large bodies and bad temper.
"Did you have a good sleep?" Steve asked quietly and Tony knew this was his only chance.
Please do let me know! Next chap will be up soon after my other fics are updated :DDD
As promised, Steve was there exactly fifteen minutes later and Tony, forever surprised by the soldier was delighted to see him looking so sleek. It was nice to think Steve was happy enough to spend some time with him, even if it was just for show, but still, the guy made an effort. He would take what he could get.
“I’ll always be there, even if just as a friend. As your pack alpha.”
Heart soaring, he switched on the slick black tablet and allowed it to power on. Once he was in, he went into the folders and tapped on the file that said ‘assignments. There he found a list of documents that seemed to link to various blueprints.
“Well...”
Tony scowled but quickly walked in, not bothering to question how Steve even came up with the idea to bring him here. This was his home for crying out loud. Vampires didn’t come to city apartments.
In a deadly calm voice, he met Ben eye-to-eye and spoke.
“Nope. Just busy making your life hell.”
They’d suggested a probation for the Illuminati members. Avengers positions but under strict measures. Curfew and monitoring. But avenging nonetheless.
Sitting in a seat in the centre of the long rectangular business table was Mr. Robinson. It was just him in the room, and he seemed to be busy doing something on the laptop in front of him. He had yet to look up.
And Rhodey had told him what he’d said.
“Scanning now.” Forcing himself to move, he lifted his wrist up and opened his palm. He didn’t focus beyond the watch as he scanned.
Norman turned to Tony. “You should be alert. If you see a brute of a mummy, a black or grey arachnid close to a scene, keep away.”
“You’re right. It’s the arc reactor.” Tony nods and doesn’t miss the way Rogers looks smug and Ty glares.
Is Steve really that afraid? That still doesn’t explain why Steve is so adamant about being the pup’s father. Or why he, Captain America, is so bothered about him.
who wasn’t close to Steve?
A risk. That’s what Ben had said. A risk. A liability.
“How about never?” Tony grumbled but slowly began to take off his shoes and suit jacket. He was wearing a black suit jacket, a shirt and some jeans so it wouldn’t take long. Just a few buttons to undo and-
The bartender watched their interaction and began to fix up a second round. At Pierce’s insistence, Tony finished his first drink and allowed the glass to be swapped out for a full one. Two cubes and the perfect mix.
Silently, he trudged back towards the lift, staring blankly at the wall as he did.
“To keep you safe.” Strange says and Steve’s didn’t think the world could be any more cruel until now.
Gabe faced him.
Hesitantly, Tony held up a hand and stepped forward. “Steve...”
“Thank you Whitney. But I must accept the punishment. Zeke’s words are just and I have wronged him.” He replied, ducking his head down in every attempt to show his shame. Good little vampires did as they were told by the father, and he was
Tony instantly ached for his old team. The Avengers team he apparently broke up.
“That’s true.” Jeremy pointed out and gestured to his chin, making Tony turn and flash him a grin. That was right. He loved this guy already.
Steve laughed and turned to the dirt caked armor with barely contained glee.
“Rogers.”
As Steve had pointed out, there was no one. No one except Steve and his team.
When he wakes up next, he’s in the same hospital room as before and flat on the bed with his legs propped up and a sheet covering his waist up to his bare chest. There are monitors and wires and several people in the room but everything is shimmery and faded and he can hear his heart racing in his ears. He hears other things too, like Rhodey talking to the doctors and someone talking about
Tony couldn’t stop smiling. The morning had started out so poorly and yet now things were looking up. And things were just gonna get better.
Sharon was talking to Steve. And they were both smiling and laughing. Tony could see her eyes lit up like diamonds.
Outside the tower there was a black limo with the chauffeur already seated in place and ready to go. It was that time of day when the sky was bright but the sun was just starting to lower. Something about the sight, calmed his nerves a bit. By the time they’d get to Washington, it’d be quarter to eight but Steve had said that would be fine.
He waited but Pepper said nothing. She didn’t even shift.
It was a huge robot. Insanely huge. And around it were several smaller ones that were raining down gunfire on the packs of agents. Some of the robots were focusing on taking down the agents in the turrets lining the top deck. Others were looking for something, tearing through the agents like paper.
“I’m not done here. I want you to stay with me and we’re gonna sort this whole mess out. How you two managed to screw it up is beyond me but we’ll sort it.”
“I am! I’m sick and-“
Casting his gaze back to the children, he assessed their state. At ten years old, these twins had been chosen to join the brotherhood, hand selected by Ezekiel for their features. They both had jet black hair, large bright eyes and a well defined nose. The shape of their lips was supple and in their previous life, must’ve been a healthy pink. Even their eyes would’ve been a deep blue, Tony was sure.
Steve couldn’t say a thing. All he could do was listen with an empty gaze and a broken heart.
“Hey Tony.” Steve smiled at him on one bright morning when Tony had just started to sink his teeth into the engine of an old Harley Davidson. “Do you mind if I draw you? I’m trying to get back into it, you know?”
Unconsciously, Tony began to groan quietly and try and pull away from Steve and really, he could empathize. Only that wouldn’t be enough to stop Steve from saving Tony’s life. If he had to endure a little pain, Steve would take it.
“Oh.” Tony breathed and ducked a little to look at it. It wasn’t something he’d ever seen before, it was just a species they’d heard about when discussing multiverses with Reed. He’d seen a picture of a fairly large Hulk tsum once and that was it. But this was a living, breathing tsum that looked exactly like Ironman. An
the heat coming of his skin.
Tony frowned. “Who? Sharon?”
“Sure.” Tony tried not to laugh at how quickly Steve relaxed and resumed that air of confidence. “Dance it is. Though I didn’t know you were a professional.” Tony snickered but then stopped and quickly glanced at him. Steve didn’t seem offended though. He looked quite pleased instead.
Nothing seemed to make it better. Not even the reassurances of his team that things would be alright. Nothing worked.
“We have landed and are on the upper deck. Awaiting instructions from the commander.”
Beside his shield was an outstretched hand. A human hand with four fingers and one thumb that was fully encased in a familiar red gauntlet. The mist didn’t allow for much, but Steve could already see further hints of red beside it.
At that, Fury’s brow rose.
and his older children flee into the forest of the northern interior with other family members in the hopes of finding freedom.
Steve smiled tightly behind his cowl and took Iron man's outstretched arm. Settling himself into their usual flight position, Steve let himself relax when Iron man curled an arm around his waist. He did the same and with a soft exhale, he clasped onto Iron man and took a deep breath.
He could die for all they cared. Right here, right now, in front of all of them. None of them would give a damn.
“I’m not...I don’t want to...I want to discuss this. Just you and me. Before we even consider d-divorce.” Tony said quietly and something flashed in Steve’s eyes.
Steve was looking at him with a kind expression. There was understanding in his eyes and sorrow at the thought of their suffering. But it was nice that Steve understood him, even if it was just a little. Tony didn’t really have anyone to talk to except for Rhodey and Pepper but even then they didn’t truly understand.
Then, to Tony’s absolute
“I know. And I’m glad. I hated being-“ Tony cut himself off and exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“And no matter what this joker says, you’re my omega Tony. And I can tell you everything. Ask me.” Rogers lifts his chin, suddenly confident. “Ask me anything about us. About you.”
“Since I’ve been here, I’ve literally been treated like shit. I’ve been insulted, completely brushed off and pulled left, right and centre. And I haven’t even had a decent conversation with Steve yet. What’s the point? Why did you even bring me here?”
“Can you do me a favor?” He tries again, and watches the man’s silhouette freeze. “P-please. It’s not much, I promise.”
Omegas are strong. He is strong but this...his son...he...
“Tony talk to me. You’re scaring me.” Steve demanded, taking Tony’s wrist to check his pulse. It was light-feathery. And much too fast.
He wouldn’t make it. And this error would cost him.
Pierce waved the apology away with a hand. “Please. I should apologize. I’m guessing you’re not ready to go public?”
His eyes shoot open and he blinks.
Steve seemed kind at heart. Tony felt he was a good man who wanted to help people. Despite struggling to keep his body from shaking, he felt safe around him.
“What? Actually, you know what? Never mind. Just show me the coordinates. How far am I?”
He was bonded to Steve. He was free from the family. And even had the chance to get a new one. There was so much he could finally do...
"Tony...what on earth are you doing here?"
“Are you sure?” Tony checked one more time. He’d never forgive himself if he hurt Steve.
"Sit. I need to speak to you."
“A decoy.”
His palms grew sweaty as his eyes flicked to the screen. His smile stayed the same as he spoke.
Chuckling softly, Tony turned and went on his way, smiling every so often when remembered the ring of Steve’s laugh.
Once Steve finished his soup, he sat back and stretched. Then he took a moment to watch Tony gingerly reach for a banana on the middle of the table. Steve pushed it towards him gently, nodding when Tony looked at him.
"Tony?" He asked quietly, with something that sounded an awful lot like concern. Then his hands slowly began to lower and Tony instantly shot out to grab them.
“N’ver had m’ card.” Tony whispers and begins to turn around. “J’st w’nted a fr’nd.”
"We should sleep." Steve reminded him gently and nodded towards the bed. "My bed is on offer. We don't need to do anything but Tony, I'd..."
His door is open for once and hence, when he hears the knocks, he knows exactly who it is and doesn’t get the chance to say no.
But Fury had mentioned it, he remembered. Fury had said Steve was learning to dance. Had it really all been for this night?
Making the decision, he stepped out of the sleeping area and observed the main living area. As he’d thought, the room was completely empty, with chairs askew and nothing but the green emergency lighting on. With the hours ticking away, the sun was almost fully set, painting the room dark in the grim light. For some reason, Tony was reminded of his boarding school from back when he’d been a kid. His father had sent him away and he’d never really come back the same after. It hadn’t been a bad change but he’d come back different. He’d changed.
“Let’s talk.” Tony said, sniffing quietly while Steve instantly felt filled with hope. “Let’s try again. I’m not saying I agree with you-“
His eyes fall on the armor standing behind him. Hidden among the crowd of Shield members, Avengers and Illuminati, it’s there, waiting and watching silently.
Tony doesn’t know how to feel as he climbs the steps. Each movement feels heavy like lead and threatens to pull him into a never ending abyss. A darkness that Tony knows he won’t be able to climb out of. It’s an end that Tony knows will be his last.
“Come. Let me help you.” And Tony was on him like a moth to a flame.
“Tony? Hey Tony.”
Steve didn’t say a word but nodded. Tony just blinked tiredly and tried to bring himself to care. The doctor continued.
“You talked about reputation yesterday.” He answered instead, looking at the fading sky. “You said they have a reputation to uphold.”
“It’s not like I wanted it either.” Tony breathed and for once, he was almost quiet as he looked down. “It hurts me too, you know. Like tearing a limb.”
Denial is strongest when you’re weakest. That’s what he’s learned. When you’re shaking and stammering as you wait out the withdrawal, all because the bottle had been drained all too quickly, you realize that’s when you hold onto your morals-no matter how far-fetched they seem.
“Would you like to grab some lunch? Just...you and me?”
As Steve watched Tony turn, he felt his stomach churn. If Tony left, there would be nothing to say this happened, nothing to even turn to during this time. They were on opposite sides. He might never see Tony again.
“It’s nice of you to say-“
He looks at Steve and feels his heart burst when Steve’s eyes begin to shine. There’s so much warmth and love there that Tony’s not used to and now he has to accept that he has a pup and they both have an alpha to support them. Not that he needed one but...
“Okay. Stop.” And instantly Tony unlatched, not wanting to ever dare upset the man, for fear that he’d hurt him or-
With a deep breath, Tony stood tall and faced them head on.
“Hey, you okay?”
He was nothing in comparison. Steve was everything.
Steve didn’t look up initially. He seemed wrapped up in typing something into a tablet.
“Tony? Can you hear me?” The being repeated and to Grant’s shock, knelt down beside him, and quickly began to reach for him.
“Shhhh, don’t worry. You’re safe now. You can stay with your mate and your babies.” Steve said softly and gently stroked the Cap-tsum and the Iron-tsum until both their eyes slid shut. They both began to purr and after a moment, stared up at Steve with new eyes. It was a new start for them. Even the babies looked excited.
The way he smelled. The way he looked.
"Yes. I don't know how you found out, but yes."
“Proceed as suggested.”
“Fine. A-okay. Just peachy.”
"I know you said you had feelings for Iron man. But can you honestly tell me you feel anything like that towards me?"
“Steve?” Tony asked, then yelped when Steve yanked him close and tucked him into his chest. His nose nuzzled Tony’s hair and his chest rumbled happily.
"You wanted me to fall in line. That's what I'm doing.
He’d never felt this way before, not even when he’d first felt his body crave blood . His whole world had come crashing down.
“You made these?” Steve asked beside him, and Tony didn’t miss the way Steve kept eyeing him, as if to say ‘
“You should at least see them. They’re family.”
Slowly, the assistant grabbed the steel handle and pulled the glass door open, finally showing some modicum of decency. It took every ounce of strength not to make a point of it as he walked through. Finally the door swung closed behind him, leaving just himself and one other person in the room. The man he’d wanted to see.
going?"
Tony didn’t want to answer. He couldn’t-he
“Tony? Are you okay?” Rogers says softly and makes a gesture that Tony recognizes as a sign for Jarvis to brighten the lights in his room. The room fills with warm light and Tony shakes himself out of his daze and walks towards the bed.
If Tony hadn't been so paralyzed by the news, he would've felt the sting of betrayal hit even harder. As it was, Tony was just struggling to even breathe.
Or even suspended.”
“Yep. Hence my no kill streak.” Tony clucked lightly, rocking on the balls of his feet nonchalantly. “Still need my fix you see.”
“Steve?” He frowned, sitting up but Steve just lifted a hand up slowly.
to. If he didn’t it would only get worse.
He was in front of the office. The commanders office. He could get access. He’d already gained access when he’d fiddled with the tablet downstairs.
It was strange to think Steve was sat here talking about food with him. It kind of seemed like something they would’ve done in the past. Before the SHRA.
But there’s no reality where the Avengers are a team. Where there are no lies. Where Tony doesn’t find a new way to destroy everything all over again.
I hope everyone is well and safe during this time! Thank you so so for your patience and support-please see the notes at the end!
“You’re safe. That’s the most important thing to me. Do you understand?” Steve’s voice suddenly dropped to a hoarse whisper and he swept his thumb under Tony’s eye softly.
“And here we have the main labs. Of course, we come up with only the best designs here, really you should consider yourself lucky you are going to be-“
“I know.” Steve fought the urge to smile when Tony drank more enthusiastically. “But you’re pale as a sheet.”

“Please-just...don’t let anything happen to him.”
“No.”
” He’d replied, giggling lightly when his mom had traced her gentle fingers over the smooth lines running in the creases of his wrist on his left arm.
“What’s fair?”
“Alpha...will you...knot me? Please? I can...you can use me...you could b-breed me...” Tony begged and exposed his throat and Steve’s eyes closed tightly.
They can’t stop the next incursion. They can’t. It’s not enough. There's plan B. There is no plan A.
Tony turns his head and looks up at the alpha and smiles.
That second option was the one they could see Tony dreaded. Steve knew that every time Tony glanced at Steve after admitting to a mistake during a mission, or after praising Bucky needlessly, it was because he was seeking assurance, and trying his best to avoid a forced bond. A forced heat, a forced pregnancy-a forced life.
“Like when you caught me after that mission with the robots and I passed out and woke up to see you staring at me, god you were so worried-“
If the asteroids were too big, they would have little room to maneuver and without serious horse-power, it would be near impossible for a human.
At the sound of the door blasting off, Steve stopped and looked up.
Whitney and Norman were in the center poised opposite each other, both purebloods in a crouched stance with their knees apart and arms out. While Normans’ fangs were retracted, Whitney’s were bared and her eyes were a deeper red than his.
“Don’t apologize.” Steve pulled back and looked at him carefully. “You remember your promise?”
“I’ll keep an eye on him. I’ll protect him.” He said quietly because he didn’t need to have it spelled out for him and maybe that was the right thing to say after all. The others were looking a little more relieved and Strange was staring back at him with bleak approval.
His eyes practically sparkled with excitement. “Okay, so-!”
Captain.” Tony spun around, pointing a finger at the nonplussed wolf. Steve grumbled a little and folded his arms but his tail started drifting around Tony again.
As he says it, he looks at Tony with a soft gaze. It’s not like when Ty smiles at him, it’s different. Like he’s proud but on the inside. Like he’s in awe rather than expects it.
Then Ty talks about sex. About how they’ve tried all sorts of things, things that Tony had not even thought of. And had told Tony he’d loved it all, and that Ty made him want to try new things.
“I’m not a kid...” Tony frowned but didn’t seem too upset. He took a sip and pulled back with wide eyes.
“Goodbye Anthony. You were a good pet.”
He felt Carol's eyes on him but didn't dare look. He didn't
“No. I’ll take over from here.” He ordered, and Tony didn’t know what to make of that. He still hadn’t even been looked at by Steve. This greeting was starting to become ridiculously familiar. Perhaps he needed to get used to this new routine. Apparently ex-Avengers didn’t get respect.
Not to mention, Tony wasn’t exactly on good terms with Shield. Maria was just one example, and Steve was his own category.
It’s the team. Or part of it. There’s Carol and Wanda and T’Challa all kneeling on the floor a few feet away from him.
“I worry.” Zeke sighed. “I fear they might start to encroach on some of our feeding areas.”
Maybe
Tony’s arms don’t hug him back. They don’t pat him on the shoulder as he smiles. They fall to the floor, cold and forgotten.
“Everyday huh?”
“Sorry Winghead. Not ideal I know.”
“I don’t hate you. I just...”
Suddenly Peter threw up his hands and collapsed in the chair, blowing out a breath in a way that made Tony snicker. “Only like,
Shame washed over him. Suddenly he couldn’t bare to look at her anymore. Was it that obvious? Did he always have to do such a piss-poor job of everything?
“I thought you worked alone. I’ve never seen you with anyone else. Are you employed?”
“I am sorry.”
"I'm okay." Tony promised and tried not to wince when Steve took a shuddery breath.
The warmth and comfort was mesmerizing. He couldn’t remember what it felt like to be held by anyone anymore and yet this felt so familiar and so new all at once-
“You need to stop believing you don’t deserve good things Tony.” Tony heard from above him as he gently rubbed his cheek into Steve’s abdomen. The hands around him tightened and he thought he felt Steve stiffen slightly.
“Yeah. That.”
. He didn't deserve her sympathy, or worse, her pity.
Would the party go well? Would he look okay? Did Steve have a plan for him after all and it all stemmed from this set?
Other things were happening too. Not only was he starting to feel detached from everyone around him, he was starting to notice things in the mirror.
“Why not?”
Steve shook his head and smiled sadly.
“Steve...” Tony gasped and sucked in deep breaths before swallowing and tilted his head back to catch his eye. He felt Steve’s hands loosen a fraction as their eyes met in the reflection.
Steve was looking at him with a soft smile. His own eyes were starting to glisten.
“Mr. Stark. Good to see you again. The Senator sends his regards.” Pierce said, taking a glass from one of the waiters and raising it in Tony’s direction. Tony wasn’t buying it-the guy was a complete snake.
Tony quickly turned, almost jolting at the sight.
That quickly pulled him out of his stupor. His heart began to pound. “No, it’s okay, don’t-“ But Fury was gone before Tony could stop him. He sighed and glanced at Maria. She seemed to just stare at him.
“No, no, it’s fine, I get it.” Stark said quickly and all happy appearances had faded. Stark’s eyes had gone tight and his lips looked pinched like he’d been caught doing something he shouldn’t have. “I’ll just go-“
He dragged his eyes up slowly from the blood splattered on Ezekiel’s boots to the base of his neck and stared. His eyes then darted up when he caught the shrill sound of Whitney’s laughter, but he kept refocusing on the splatters of blood all over Ezekiel’s armor.
“C’mon please!” Tony begged, feeling close to a nervous breakdown. “It’s freezing! I just need to borrow a phone-“
Needless to say, that conversation had ended with a long make out session and Tony having to fight for Steve’s sweatpants. Thankfully, he'd won.
“Of course. I’ve seen quite a few. None quite like you I’ll admit but-“ The man’s frown dissolved into a look of pure awe. If Tony had to guess, the man was shocked.
“Steve I...” Tony’s cheeks went dark red and his lips twisted downwards. He blinked rapidly, and instantly Steve knew what was wrong. He’d had hours to predict it.
Something flashed in Steve’s eyes, and he glanced at Tony. But as quickly as it appeared, it vanished, leaving Tony feeling off-center.
Quickly turning, he faced the agents in the room and called out sharply;
“Not possible.” Tony said, shaking his head desperately. “That’s not possible,  Steve-“
...And...
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t you
“You will. Because you made a mistake and now it’s costing you. You know what you did.”
"How about you stop being an asshole and stop making my life hell, and instead go back to whichever little shithole you came out of, hmm? How does that sound?" Tony said manically and felt his eyes fall to the picture again. It was fitting.
As they both settled into their seats, they began to talk about their week. Jeremy went first giving Tony time to lean on his hands and just enjoy watching him talk.
“I know why you’re here Mr. Stark. But please. Feel free to ask me.”
Tony threw his hands up in the air. “So!?”
“You could give the card to me. I could give it to them. I’ll tell the others what happened. I’ll tell them you died peacefully.” Steve says gently, looking at him sadly with his palm out and Tony glances at the hand before nodding.
“Really? Did he mention me?”
They kissed again at that. The world narrowed to that single point where Steve's mouth met his, and all he could focus on was the sweet taste of Steve's mouth on his, and the slow warm heat that was coiling in his belly.
, Steve thinks darkly.
Carol’s lips tremble. But her eyes are steady and she sucks in a breath. A soldier preparing for war.
Tony’s glare vanished. His lips quirked up a little and Steve just grinned, looking smug.
“Just-ah. Delivery from the research labs. Just doing a round trip.” Tony said quietly, and didn’t really respond when Steve gaped a little at him, then clamped his mouth shut and stared. Tony chose not to say a word, and simply placed the pile on the desk carefully with a soft grunt. When he stood tall, his heart suddenly raced and he grabbed at the strap just across his chest desperately. He grimaced when he started to feel sweat. A wave of cold and hot washed over him, leaving him shaky.
“Careful. I’ve seen spiders who’ve tried that leap. And they’ve missed.”
Little had he known just how difficult that must have been. Until now.
“Why do we never hold hands?”
“It’s John.” Tony’s look-alike grumbled and soon enough it was just Tony and Steve left. And they hadn’t backed up.
He’d forgotten. He’s lost blood. He shouldn’t be moving too much.
“Because you asked me and Pepper to help you delete your brain. And you forgot all that when we still live with that every single day.”
“Anthony Stane.” He replied, feeling a shiver run down his spine when Steve’s grin broadened.
“Okay, here we go-Cap, you first. C'mon, let’s go.” Tony says quickly and turns on his heel before the alphas can disagree. Of course, Ty has something to say about it.
“S-so...you didn’t-“
The moon was out tonight. A thin knife-edge crescent that was clear and unblocked by the clouds. Usually the air pollution would prevent Manhattan from seeing the stars, but the moon was always there.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry Shellhead.” Steve choked and cried into Tony’s dirt caked hair, not able to stop. He sucked in a breath and continued to hide his sobs in Tony’s hair.
“How about a paternity test?” Ty suddenly suggests and Tony wonder why he hadn’t thought of that. “I’ll get the obstetrician back, hold on-“
“You saved me.” Steve said with a dawning realization. “Why?”
He couldn't help it. A broad smile spread on his face, so bright that he was sure he looked insane for how happy he was. Like someone had lit a torch in him that had been out for so long. He felt renewed. Alive.
“Pardon?”
“Let. Go.” Tony said firmly but didn’t turn to face Steve, body angled towards the door.
It’s in this strange moment that Steve is suddenly hit with the thought. That if Tony was here, he’d know what to do. He’d know what to say. The Avengers wouldn’t be frozen in place and Strange wouldn’t be so broken he couldn’t say a word. Blackbolt and Beast would not stare at him with such disappointment and T’Challa wouldn’t ignore him for months on end.
And really Tony wanted to laugh. The irony was unbelievable. It was hysterical even.
As all of them did. As Tony once had.
“He’s barely breathing. We don’t know if we’ll get him help in time.” Wanda says quietly and Steve has had enough-
For a moment, the doctor showed the first signs of concern and looked torn. His gaze flitted to the door concealing the group of babbling Shield agents, and the genius laying prone in the bed. Finally, he took a deep breath and decided.
Tony’s alone again. Alone with his thoughts.
Looking down, he was shocked to find Steve’s arm wrapped around him from behind.
When they reached the punishment room, Tony heard Norman sigh. Suddenly he was reminded of the last time they’d stood in these positions. It was thanks to Norman that he’d even gotten a chance to leave the cavern. He should’ve thanked him for that.
“I-wait, what? I don’t-“ Tony honestly didn’t know where that had come from. “I don’t
Sometimes he wondered how he’d been as director. He didn’t think it would’ve been something he’d enjoyed but Steve and Maria had been clear about how tough the job was, and had showed him past reports.
“How quickly will this work Hank?” He asked, feeling something relight in him as Tony’s eyes fluttered.
“Kill Rogers! Fire now!”
“No problem.” Tony smiled and turned to walk around to the empty seat beside Maria. Only the second he did, Fury moved, quick as lightning and grabbed his sleeve and held him back.
Tony’s face boiled with heat. His mouth parted a little and he spun on his seat to demand an explanation when he froze.
Tony looked Dugan in the eye and smiled tightly. “I don’t know about radars and all. But I know Steve is special. I guess that’s why he’s on my radar.”
“So come see. Then I’ll let you get back to your work.”
That was when Tony was hit with the thought.
Not alone. Not like him. Not like someone broken.
Suddenly he heard chattering. A man, Brooklyn accent and deep-ish voice was approaching the alley. He was still on the main road but Tony could hear him coming closer. He closed his eyes and focused.
After missions, Shellhead always offered to fly him back to the mansion. It had become a sort of routine for them to the point where even the rest of the team didn’t mind. Steve was grateful; being able to soar through the sky with his best man was incredible and always gave him time to unwind and reflect.
He’d stayed true to himself. He did well in boarding school, graduated from MIT with flying colors and later went on to take some projects on for SI.
“Not much. Well actually maybe you can clarify some things.” Nodding to himself, he pulled out the letter from his pocket and held it up for Steve to see. “Are you really taking me to this thing?”
"I know. But I can't let people say things like that to you."
His eyes met Elijah and Zachariah’s who shrunk away from him instinctively. They looked terrified and he wanted to tell them they’d be alright.
All the way home, Tony wondered just what Steve had to be thinking to have said all of that. And if he really did mean what he said. The party would be telling.
With a tired sigh, Tony looked up and smiled. It didn’t reach his eyes but still, he tried.
“Yes, Mr Stark. How’re you feeling now?”
"I'm not Iron man. You've got it wrong-"
“You are the most important! If you think-“
“So are you Stark.” A new voice said behind him and Tony instantly turned and let out a sigh of relief.
No. This was a mission. He had to find out why he was going instead of the spies. Really, what did the bosses want him to do?
Tony’s eyes searched the crowd and spotted the missing puzzle piece. One of the camera holders was arachnid kind. But seriously? A journalist?
How he’d been wrong.
Steve gave him a look of ‘Aw shucks’, and let his hand drop. He seemed pleased with himself and reminded Tony of that happy dog on the billboard he’d seen weeks ago.
Suddenly a large screech reached his ears. Though distant, he thought it was coming from in front of him.
He was a blight. A massive thorn in the side. Even the guards thought so.
Tony agreed and without wasting another minute, reached out with his hands and picked Steve up by his waist. In one smooth motion he kicked them into the air and began to carry Steve to the giant robot.
“Don’t worry. I’m just glad you’re back.” Steve said and finally felt his lips curve into a smile.
“Still a fair bit to go. The coordinates are listed here, see? They haven’t moved but then again, we have no idea if the distress call was meant for us.” She said distantly with a slight eye-roll, twisting a few of the dials and clicking on several buttons. On the radar screen, a red dot appeared and flashed in that familiar sequence.
The three glance at each other before Reed looks back at Steve. “Understood. Captain.”
As they began to move against each other, Steve watched Stark like a hawk. He watched his body language, the way he swiveled his hips to dodge, the way he angled his right hand in the punches  and the way he mainly fought with his hands.
“Step away from him.” Steve,
Please let me know what you think! We’re nearly there!
Tony wonders.
“I know something’s bothering you. In fact, I know several things are bothering you.” Fury said, and with a glance at the bartender, guided Tony to the bare looking corner nearby. The small bit of privacy did make Tony’s shoulders relax slightly.
Tennis, sure.
“Of course. Hate to see him go but love to watch him leave and all that.”
The tension rose again. Tony didn’t dare look away from Steve’s back.
Which one is it Tony!?
Then he sealed his lips to Tony’s and pulled him close, holding him tightly in an almost bruising grip. Tony gasped in his mouth and Steve used the chance to slip his tongue into his mouth and take what was his. Tony moaned and shivered but didn’t stop and Steve couldn’t help but smile into the kiss.
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.” He murmured and pressed his lips to Tony’s, tasting, feeling, holding him in place-
, and when Tony turns it over and reads the blurb, it talks about a totalitarian government and a world of propaganda, confusion and disinformation. The story suggests that it focuses on a small family in North America where the father publishes a paper that speaks a little to closely of the truth. He's arrested by the dreaded
While he sat and waited, Zeke wandered around the room, reaching for a compartment in his chest of draws where ice-packs were found. Below that, Tony knew there was a hidden stash of blood bags, the kind that would feed a whole family for weeks.
Tony grunted as a man shoved past him. He shouldn’t have left the car. There was a reason he hated being outside like this.
The door slid open. Steve was gone. It was just the empty desk and chair and the side door for the commanders armory. Distantly, he realized the armory door opened with him having to break in. His palm on the scanner registered.
Totally-
From the corner of his eye, Gabe looked down. He must’ve noticed too, but kindly opted not to mention it. Instead, he turned to face the dance floor.
. Tony felt like a complete idiot. He should’ve seen this coming.
“H-hey St’ve?” Tony blinked and smiled softly at the blurry image of Steve above him.
“Yeah, m’fine.” He mumbled but managed to plaster a smile to his face at the pale look she was giving him. Behind her, Steve was now looking at him with a grim expression. He looked like he’d been punched and Tony briefly imagined calling Sharon over to make him feel better. They were gonna go out after all.
Tony’s throat burned and stuck as he fiddled with the cuff links in his sleeves. His heart felt like it was being squeezed with tight fingers.
“Oh don’t be dismayed pet. I know your type, you are curious by nature. Does it displease you so much?” Zeke asked kindly, though his eyes gleamed at the sight. After all, Tony knew he enjoyed seeing others squirm.
Tony couldn't say no. So they spent the day together, going first to Steve's office to talk about just a few things and discuss some of the info they'd gotten from the robot attack, and then carried on that talk on the way to the cafeteria. It took Tony a moment to realize Steve was actually going to spend lunch with him. Just the two of them.
He sighed and guided the human to a slouched position against the wall of the alley, kicking away some of the syringes into a nearby cardboard box. This had been his home once. In some distant part of his memory, he remembered travelling down a street just like this with a young woman named Pepper. Well maybe that hadn’t been her real name but he was certain he’d called her that once. Maybe a happy smile had been thrown his way once or twice, and he’d waved his hand and smiled proudly, explaining that he couldn’t wait to work on the cars. Had he been an inventor? A mechanic? He certainly felt like it suited him. He definitely felt he could improve this shitty armor.
What could he do?
Little things and big things. All about them and all about what they could have in Tony’s mind.
“So...” Steve said awkwardly and came around the table to sit opposite him. “Rough day?”
“You’re blushing.” Steve explained happily and then leered. “Really blushing.”
Tony watched the Adonis leave and shook his head. What was the world coming to if Captain America had time to take Ironman for waist measurements?
“Don’t pass out on-okay, okay-easy!” Steve caught his shoulders as he leaned forward and began to puke all over the bed, rancid bile dripping everywhere. Even with nothing in him, he retched, full body tremors that Steve could feel through his palms.
Whitney was waiting for him in the cavern. So was Norman.
“I thought these were your friends?” He said, watching the young spider-kid wave his hands around frantically at ‘Thor’.
Ty has no issues though since he’s too busy grinning manically and pointing at the Captain with a harsh finger.
Something began to poke in the back of Tony’s mind. Something important.
“I can do... never-mind.” Tony petered off and Steve fought the urge to beam as he cleaned, fully aware of what that meant.
He always has been.
The ball dropped out of his hand. It slipped right through his fingers.
Tony was gonna kill him. He was gonna kill him.
“Help my team complete the repairs.” Steve clarified, eyeing a particular phone on the table. “Shield’s R and D department is struggling. We need an extra set of hands and as much as I hate to say it, you’re our best chance.”
“Cap, what about you? Are you okay?”
“Quick and easy huh?” Tony said and slammed his napkin down on the table before shoving the chair back and standing up despite Jeremy’s gasp. “That’s not what you thought when you went down on me that night-“
Heart aching, Tony looked at Pierce with dim eyes. “Yeah. Well I’m glad you did. Get involved that is. Thanks for taking a chance on me.”
“Don’t do this.”
“Uh Steve?”
A broad smile stretches across his face. For the first time in months, Tony feels
Tony had no choice but to comply. In that sense, nothing had changed when it came to Steve.
Sweat begins to build down the base of Steve’s spine.
Quietened, the young children nodded their heads slowly, pale red eyes looking down as they tried to resist the urge to bite. Tony rolled his eyes and dropped them to the floor, diverting his deep red eyes to the upper levels of the cavern. No sign of anyone yet. All was quiet.
If there was one thing he was gonna do with his miserable life it was going to be helping Steve get out of this. He was going to keep Steve safe, even if it killed him.
“Let me! I need it-“
Tony knows he won’t be seeing him again any time soon. It’s a relief.
“I know. I’m so sorry. I always planned to come back and talk it out. I was just so afraid and when I got those papers, I was terrified.” Steve said, burrowing his head into Tony’s shoulder and somehow, Tony realised he was crying too.
“Steve.”
Could he even get a response better than that?
Steve stood up, frowning in concern. Careful, he reached out and pressed his palm against Tony’s forehead. He was still warm but seemed a lot cooler than before thankfully. His heat scent had also calmed down, less strong like honey but more like maple syrup. And still Tony.
“You should be in bed.”
There is a party being thrown tomorrow. Odd since Steve can’t imagine being happy right now. But the younger members of the Avengers want to throw it in celebration of managing to end it all, and the older members feel it’ll boost morale. But that’s not all.
“OH YOU THINK!?” Tony screamed, biting back a whimper when Steve pressed around his palm gently. It was already starting to swell.
When they pulled away, Tony laughed a little, causing Steve to eye him suspiciously.
“Agent Stark, you requested access?”
Tony started tossing the ball between his hands. “What about me?”
“Stand up. C’mon, I want you up.” Steve said, patting his knees and getting up. Once stood, he held out a hand and hauled Tony up, armor and all, until he was on his feet.
“I’d rather wait.” Tony admits and smiles thinly. “ Who knows, I might even remember.”
“That night when you and I slept together...it didn’t really...it wasn’t as simple as that.” Steve sighed and looked at Tony for help. Tony raised his brow for him to continue, trying to ignore the growing jitters that something was killing his body.
“GET OFF HIM YOU SICK FREAKS!”
“That’s not true.” He felt sick to his stomach. Like someone was pounding into him over and over. Slowly, he dropped his head into his hands and squeezed his eyes shut. It didn’t help.
“No can do Cap. Mr. Stark doesn’t really allow for much playtime.”
Tony wondered if Steve still remembered that. For all the brain deleting he’d done, Tony would never forget the look in Steve’s eyes back then. He’d never felt more important to anyone after that.
“Mr. Stark. Captain Rogers. Now that we have reviewed the papers and all decisions have been made, we will assemble the documents for you to sign. To be clear, Captain Rogers has agreed to not claim any assets that were acquired throughout the marriage. All property held by Mr. Stark is to be relinquished fully, with no divide of equities.” The lawyer eyed Steve at that, and only continued when Steve nodded tiredly. “All documents today will be registered and will effectively end the marriage between both parties involved. Once signed, both parties will have no relation identifiable by court. Gentlemen, please wait in the other room while we assemble the forms.” He finally said, standing up swiftly with a pile of sheets in hand. Tony’s lawyer stood up as well and he quickly followed them along with Steve.
"What?"
The next morning, Zeke had been in a fantastic mood. Norman had pointed out that the Captain had not caused any trouble the night before and Whitney had finally come to accept the terms of the new arrangement. She still hadn’t left her quarters but Norman had been adamant that she was calmer now than she had been before.
“I’ve just never really done well with politicians. They tend to not agree with me on most things. My being me and all that.” Tony joked but watched Fury’s fingers clench over the pen. For some reason, that made him feel better.
“Long.” Steve said smoothly and didn’t say anything else. Minutes passed much to Tony’s extreme disappointment but then-
And he still hadn’t really explained why.
mine.”
“You don’t.”
“Tony? Are you okay?”
“L’ve you Winghead.” Tony slurs and feeling his head loll, he brushes his fingers against the matted blond strands on Steve’s forehead.
“Hey, easy!” Steve hissed and pulled the doctors hand away in warning. Grateful, Tony smiled a little. He could barely move, he was so tired.
Then his smile dims. Hatred rears it’s ugly head.
“I meant what I said. I’m taking you out.”
Steve jerks sharply at that. His blue eyes narrow and meet Tony's head on. He looks in control but Tony can see how much his lips are trembling. The tears are still falling.
The sound of a door creaking softly, reached his ears. Keeping his eyes closed, he registered the air change as someone stood above him and paused.
Steve stares back at him with a dark, ugly gaze in his expression. His lips are pinched and his shoulders are taut and he looks coiled like a wire about to spring. But he follows Tony like a man starving. His expression is haunted and in the thin blue light, Tony sees fear on his face.
“Is there something wrong?” He raised a brow and tried to see her face, but the dark haired, slim woman didn’t even bother to turn back round and face him which just irritated him even more.
and couldn’t help but agree.
But oh no, Tony wasn’t gonna let this go. Suddenly he couldn’t stop smiling.
His eyes glanced up. “I think you’ve sprained it.”
Speaking of which-
Then Tony registered what he was seeing. The young man was half arachnid, half human, his face, the grey head of some hairy spider with several eyes. His body looked primarily humanoid but several spider legs sprouted from somewhere in his back.
“How was your meeting?” Tony asks and isn’t surprised when Ty groans. Meetings can be tough.
So when the sixth day rolled by, he eagerly collected his armor from Norman and headed out. An hour later, he was back on his favorite building of choice, this time at nine o’clock in the evening. The streets were much busier.
Tony had never been happier. Never.
“I know how he feels.” Tony said quietly. “Being the one who... who killed him...”
“Steve!”
He rushes out of the room quickly leaving Rogers and Tony alone. For a moment there’s pin-drop silence.
“The queen is the most powerful piece. It can move in all directions and adapt to all situations. Alone, it is an impenetrable piece but because it’s sole purpose is to guard the king, it often makes the sacrificial play. It was Tony's favorite piece, even though he never said.”
And that is...a pleasant surprise. That Steve is worried about him. It’s...
Something about the scene made Tony distinctly uncomfortable. “Uh, Steve-“
They looked worried. It really wasn’t good.
“Whatever Stark. Don’t expect any of us to jump for you.” Ben snapped and walked faster.
He’s shallow. And false and lonely and somewhat afraid of what could happen. But he also wants to know desperately which one of these alphas is his. Which one is the one he was chosen by who wanted him enough that they’re gonna have a baby? Which one made him feel so happy and sure that he agreed to try for a baby?
“Fine, except for the fact that you just sent me a contract stating that you might need to live on the Helicarrier for six months!? Who does he think he is!?”
Natasha held up the plastic bag and opened it to reveal the contents. Carefully, Steve took it and assessed the bottles inside, pulling a few out and giving them a shake. Something lifted from his shoulders then.
“Scan it. Dammit Steve, you need to send us the info!”
“I think I’ll take my leave now.” Tony said firmly and shoved the chair back to stand up. Without even casting a look back, he grabbed the steel handle and yanked it open.
“It’s a crying shame.” Steve explained with a serious expression. “How am I supposed to howl without a full moon?”
“Sure Ty.” He sighed and stood up and took the pile of folders from him carefully. Then he stopped and felt his eyes widen.
“You first.”
Tony’s eyelids fluttered again and finally they opened to reveal dazed, but electric blue eyes.
Steve didn’t waste much time after that. Within seconds, he ripped Tony’s shirt apart, sending buttons flying across the floor and then he was on Tony, devouring him and marking him and covering him so firmly that Tony couldn’t breathe.
“Captain?” The doctor asks quietly after the brief silence and Tony watches in awe as Rogers stares at him with a fierce expression.
Steve swiftly grabbed his arm, gaze sharp. “Easy. I can go pretty fast.”
He needed to lie down.
“Maria! Get the med team here. Tony needs medical attention, now!”
But more importantly-
Pierce was still watching him so Tony made sure not to blink too hard. It was better to distract than linger. The sooner he was able to find some space, the better.
Without bothering to wait, he began to walk past, only his body faltered and his vision swam. Still after a brief pause, he pushed past the pain and pushed on forward.
His husband sat opposite him, staring firmly at the table wood with dim eyes that carried no emotions. Nothing. They were carefully blank and didn’t shine like they used to. And yet Steve still somehow looked perfect, even after a year of being on the run.
It was tempting. The option to leave was very tempting. But...
Not surprised, she nodded and turned back to helping Hank. Steve watched, unblinking as Hank took three pieces of a metallic syringe and twisted them together to lock them into a single unit.
His fists tightened so hard they shook. “I was never a good person you know? Not really. But I wasn’t bad. I wasn’t so terrible.” Tony said with a crazed smile. “I did the same thing any twenty something year old would do with that amount of money. What’s so bad about that?”
It was difficult. How could he stay calm? How could he be neutral when Tony’s suit lay so vulnerable out here, millions of miles away from home, with no hope in sight? How could he be calm, when the last time he’d spoken to Tony, had been after Tony had woken up from a coma, where all he’d said was that he was done and that Tony had gone too far?
Their footsteps grew closer until they stepped into the light and instantly Tony was hit with the sharp smell of iron.
The suns were unbearably high. Their rays felt scorching as he traversed the dull landscape. Dust rose and soared lightly in the air.
Relief, it turns out, is something he can still feel.
“Why’re you being so nice to me? Do you want me to make you something?” Tony winked but Steve sighed and folded his arms.
For a moment he freezes at the sight of Steve holding the pup, and he scowls at them. But it quickly vanishes when he meets Tony's eyes. An easy smile spreads across his face and he straightens his jacket smoothly and tucks his hair back.
He was losing blood. And his whole body was shaking like he was in shock.
"This is real Tony. Otherwise you wouldn't imagine me doing that." Steve says quietly, sounding resigned, like he knows the truth. And what makes this real.
Fault. That was it. Simple and true. He had been the cause, he knew, even if he didn't remember.
The man,
“Well then. I’ll leave you to it Captain. I’m sure I’ll see you later after the president gives his speech. Enjoy the starters. Stark.” He tilted his head in Tony’s direction and stalked off, leaving Tony’s head reeling. As soon as Steve let him go, he spun on his feet and faced the soldier.
“Tony. Wave. Back.”
“Tony-“
Steve launches forward and kisses him then, firm and fierce and happy and grateful all at once. And when he pulls away, he's beaming giddily and can't stop.
The waiter came to them and nodded at Steve, leading them to a table tucked away at the back of the restaurant. It wasn’t too busy thankfully but that was likely because they’d missed the lunchtime rush. There was still enough people to attract attention though so Tony was grateful for the seating.
“What’s wrong?” He asked quietly.
“What’re you gonna do? Put on the suit.” Steve grit out and pushed closer until they were just nano-meters away-
“This is definitely where they made them. I’ll send you a shot.”
The giant robot was making a loud screeching noise and was waving its steel claws in the air, trying to deal with the source of its problem. Luckily Steve was completely out of its way.
“It’s hard. I know what you’re thinking but...” Tony looks down at his stomach and presses his hand to it. “I just don’t get what he sees in me. And plus, how can I be Captain America’s omega? Shouldn’t someone else be carrying his baby?”
“Just listening.” Tony replied quietly and released a breath when Steve nodded and leaned back again. Their hands didn’t move though.
Anything to keep the growing nausea at bay.
“Sure you are! Go hop into your suit and go see what all the fuss is about! I know the Commander has your suit on the top deck! Go get it!”
“Look I’ll-I’ll just go back in. I’m probably keeping you away anyway-“
“I thought I was not recommended.”
“No, I mean it.” Steve insisted and at Tony’s scathing look, he sighed. “It wasn’t like that. I just didn’t want you to be hurt.”
The ground is rough and jagged under his feet. His body sits in the shadow of an unassuming chain-store and blends against the background as men and women pass by. He doesn’t know what time it is, but he does know it’s around midday, just a few days before Christmas.
Tony looks up at the clearly bored clerk and sighs. His vision is starting to blur around the edges.
“What? Steve is taking
Warmth blooms in Tony’s heart. It feels right and yet so bright and new, unlike anything he’s felt before. Like belonging to something more.
“You can’t just say you’re leaving and not say why.” Tony explained, resisting the urge to grab Steve and shake him. How did he need to stand here and explain why Steve shouldn’t leave?
“No...Tony, god.” Steve croaks and to Tony’s dismay, starts to cry. “What have you
Tony whined and took a deep breath, huffing when the man shifted and sat them up even more. The man chuckled at that and Tony felt lips press firmly against his hair.
Steve was watching him like he'd gone crazy.
If he was human, he’d be permanently paralyzed. Norman had snapped part of his spine in two.
Tony’s hands started to tremble.
Beside him, Steve seemed to freeze. His hands hovered in the air and didn’t move a fraction. When Tony turned to look up, he saw a pained expression on his face, like he’d just realized something awful. Like Tony had just delivered bad news or stepped on a landmine.
“That’s fair. My therapist says I need to try opening up more so that’s what I’m doing.” Steve shrugged calmly like he hadn’t just dropped a bombshell. “She says it would help my adjustment and my PTSD.”
“I don’t want to leave this. I love you. That hasn’t changed no matter what’s happened between us. You’re the best part of my life.” Steve murmured into his ear, squeezing him tighter. “You’re my other half Tony. Don’t leave me.”
“I try, my lord.”
“No, absolutely not. Not Anthony-“ Zeke began but Norman simply turned and frowned at him.
“You don’t know
“How’re you holding up?” He whispered and like a wave, Tony felt relief crash into him so hard his vision swam and his chest felt like it was on fire. Luckily the medic behind him steadied him. But Steve’s eyes sharpened.
“Just because I have an orange beverage does not mean-“
The men mumbled as they stepped past Maria. Soon enough it was just Maria and her group. So many groups.
Then, turning to his left, Steve lifted his hand and brought it down in one swing.
“Hey there punk. What’re you doing out here all alone, huh?”
“Tony, I’d like you to meet my close friends, Dugan and Gabe. Dugan and Gabe are former members of-"
He was in Steve’s apartment. Specifically his bedroom. The whole room was dark, the blinds covering the night coming from the outside and casting a strange veil of peace over the room.
Much like these steps. They pave the way to his final resting place.
“Yes.” Thor said brightly and lowered his tone. “He is pleased. We should celebrate this with him for he is not alone.”
Each claim went without a hitch. He was faster than before and soon enough had just one route left.
“You think I brought you here for that? To mock you?” Fury said and scowled at the glasses in his hand. Then he looked up and shook his head.
“Look, I’m not asking for much.” Tony explains, or at least tries to and has to stop to suck in a breath and clamp his lips together. His teeth are chattering and the jacket is barely covering his hands.
“It has his blood on it.” He continued to echo, not daring to open his hand again, for fear that he’d see something else that would just break him. “It’s been broken off. Definitely his armor.”
When he finally reached the cavern, he stopped and pressed a hand to his chest, calming his breathing.
So much for lunch with Steve. And here Tony had been hoping for a miracle.
Pierce seemed to eye him carefully. Then his own smile dipped a little further and he shook his head firmly.
Things would get better. They already had.
Instead, Steve’s thumb started to rub gently on the back of his hand. Tony felt like his ears were on fire.
Beside him Steve whistled.
“You’re nervous.”
“Oh Cap, hey! How was the mission?”
“You’re amazing. I love you so much.”
“I...I can’t believe...”
He looked up and hissed. “Zeke.”
The evening slowed after that. Shortly after their...
"Steve." He waited for Steve to look at him and he licked his lips nervously. "Is it true that you only wanted me here because you missed me?"
“You might as well quit it now. He’s as good as-“
Looking at Steve now, Tony wasn’t sure what to think.
Tony raised a brow. “Oh?”
“No can do Hill. I’ve got better things to do than run around because some government organisation wants to kick me around.”
“It’s time, Mr. Stark. Please come with-“
“I’ll take it.”
When he returned that night, something was different. The air felt bleak and full of misery, like the afterglow of a horrid fight. The scent of sweat and blood filled Tony’s nose and this was just in the main hall, and without anyone around.
“Tony Stark. That’s his name isn’t it?” The Beyonder taunted, curling a hand under Tony’s jaw. Then ever so gently, he pulled Tony’s face towards him and pressed a gentle kiss to his lips. Tony didn’t say anything. He simply let it happen just like before.
A sob escapes his mouth. Fears takes hold.
“Hey Stark, have fun up there. I’m sure he’s just
But his expression was so soft. It was warm and open and kind and for once, Tony was sure it was directed at him. And when Tony reached those eyes, they went half-lidded and Steve's smile turned even softer.
Heart racing, Tony swore and turned to the agent on his left, who’d been carefully watching the flashing dot with him. Andrew. His name was
Feeling lighter, Tony headed towards the door but then paused.
