"Oh, hi, Steve!" he said, sounding bubbly.  "What is that, pizza? Thanks but no thanks, I'm not hungry.  I think I just made a breakthrough! Hey, for my birthday, I was thinking white tigers.  Can we get some of those guys? Or orange, honestly, orange would work. Are we still doing that June auction?  I just realized orchids and tigers both come in white, and orange. Can I borrow your shield? I wanna show you something cool.  Give me your shield."
Steve reached out to touch.
Steve hummed and got off of the crippled Alpha, standing.  He heard the sound of bullets scattering down the hallway. "I think the guards have caught up," Sam murmured, edging towards the doorway.  "They're probably shooting at that omega kid as we speak."
Tony let Rhodey shove him into bed, but he was still drumming away with his fingers.  Rhodey shot Steve a look. "It might be better to just let him go work. Usually when he gets hopped up, he either works on something or sleeps with like, four women."
"Second bedroom on the left is the biggest guest bedroom," called Tony as Banksy began dragging Donner upstairs, chatting the whole way up as they navigated around the orchids.
"I can't sleep next to you and pretend we're really together when you're not even here with me."
"He told me he didn't do trios," sneered Tony, unable to help the bitterness from creeping into his voice.  Finding out about Barnes had been awful, but had been made better knowing that Barnes was dead.  Now they had this Winter Soldier business and it was like Barnes was back from the grave.  Tony was honestly more upset by the idea of their bond being compromised than being partially bonded, through Steve, to a murderer.
"I don't know.  Sleep."
Even Donner looked intrigued.  "...open it," he agreed meekly, nodding.
Eric gave him a sympathetic look, like Steve was some kind of child who'd just been told that Santa Claus wasn't real. Steve was trying to repress his anger, which he knew Tony could feel.
"I gotta suit up,
When JARVIS mentioned Steve, Tony dropped the box he was holding and darted out, leaving papers, notebooks, and photos scattered all over the floor.
.  Tony had spent the whole movie acting like he was being tortured and proclaimed firmly that the title referred to the audience, not the characters.)
Weren't heats supposed to have a couple of lulls?  Tony wasn't an expert but he was pretty sure there were typically a few periods where the omega calmed down at least enough to get some water, go to the bathroom, carry on a conversation that didn't include pleas for more dick.
Watching the video was hard.  Not as hard as the other video Steve had released, the one when Tony had kicked him out.  But nonetheless difficult. Steve's talk of feeling rejected and unloved made Tony feel like a piece of shit.  It was a miracle that people didn't loathe him, he thought. Pepper and Aria and all of Steve's omega friends had every right to after what he'd put Steve through.
"No," said Tony, eyes narrowing a little.  "No, he's

survived."
"I'm just happy what we'll be doing next week.  And happy that you'll be able to do it with us, Steve," said Tiberius, patting Steve's wrist.
"Good honeymoon, cap?" Fury asked and Steve was taken back. Maybe it was a gesture of kindness. Or maybe it was Nick realising he needed Steve on his side.
Tony blinked, suddenly slightly more awake.  "Wait.  What? ...you guys hang out outside work?"
Another bead of fluid slid down Steve's neck, tinged pink with blood.  Tony reached up to wipe it away with one finger. "Does it hurt?"
) bonded... things were complicated.
"...now what?" asked Tony, leaning against the tank.  He studied Steve's face. He knew that look. That was Steve's Captain-America-there's-no-time-like-the-present-someone-has-to-do-something look.  He
Tony made a soft hum of encouragement to Steve, which was the closest he could come to saying it was okay considering his mouth was full.  He continued bobbing, Steve's cock slippery in his mouth with his saliva, dragging his tongue along it, eyes closed.
."  It was obvious what he meant.  He reminded Steve of Happy, a bit.
It was his mate's. And Steve couldn't have fun whilst Tony was in so much pain.
One frowned. "What do you mean?"
"Yeah?"
Steve reappeared from the kitchen just as the omegas were getting ready to 'storm' the Alphas' den. It was a bizarre tradition, almost cute, Steve thought, if he could ignore everything else. They were tugging on waistcoats, gathering up purses, and downing drinks. Hal tugged on his arm.
act entitled to sex again, then God help me Buck, you're not getting any," he added with a dry laugh.
"Anytime. And always for stuff like this," Gleason assured him.
Tony's eyes narrowed.  "Like
Tony kept one eye open, but the room was blurring.  He put out one hand weakly, groping for Steve's, but his limbs felt so heavy.  He wasn't sure whether or not he managed to grab Steve's fingers before darkness fell and just like that, he was unconscious, head dropping onto his chest.
"...and who the fuck is David Gleason?"
Steve woke later that evening to Tony's arms around him and his breath hot against his neck. He stirred a little and blinked, rubbing a hand over his face and sighed. This felt so strangely perfect. He grunted quietly and sat up. Steve moved to go take a piss and then devoured a few pastries and three glasses of water before returning to bed.
am?  I'm the one he tried to kill!" whined Tony.
Pepper blinked.  "What?"
He reached around to grasp Steve's dick.
is kind of an exaggeration.  I mean, growing up, we had staff.  Not that many, though.  Like, maybe six?  Jarvis did so much for us that we didn't really have many, other than the cook and my nannies and some gardeners.  After he died, it felt weird to try to replace him.  So it's just the usual maintenance crew around here, y'know, people to do the laundry and trim the hedges and junk.  No one
"Pho is Vietnamese," said Happy.  "Fortune cookies are Chinese."
"Now, Tina-" the presenter turned to the activist. "Do you think progress will actually come out of this? Do you think Captain America has the chance to cause real change or will the hype will die down?"
"Hm. I don't know as much as I should and I'm one of them," Steve pointed out as they settled back down. "I've never been taught about it either. All I know is to warn you that the first heat will be messy... and not in a fun way. I think they stop being sexy after about a day and just become pretty painful. Clint doesn't speak highly of them."
Tony didn't want to frighten him by telling him about Vanko.  He'd just have to keep Steve safe until he had more information.
"Nope," confirmed Steve.  He breathed out.  "I'm scared of myself, Tony. I didn't know I could be like that-- that I could go that off the rails so badly.  That's why I want you in charge."
Abby shrugged. "Who knows?" And there was it. Her tone was casual, like she was talking about an old high school friend-- not a guy who'd been bought and then publicly bonded in front of everyone. Disgusting.
When Tony grabbed Clint's hand by accident and then let go Steve wasn't sure what to do. He let his fingertips graze over his forearm briefly. It could easily be passed off as accident brush of skin, but he hoped it was some small comfort to the man.  He tried to catch Natasha's eye but she was clammed up thanks to Tony's question.
"You're an asshole," replied Pietro.
"Between seventy and a hundred ounces a day, averaging eighty-six," said JARVIS.
He got to his feet unsteadily and began stomping upstairs.  The smell of bacon assailed him. Right. Steve was an early riser.  Tony took a deep, steadying breath to calm himself, wanting to be strong for Steve, wanting to focus on the others' problems instead of his own.
"Come on," said Tony, giving Steve's hand another tug.  This time, Steve let Tony lead him down to the basement shop.
Steve whimpered; his neck burned and Tony was pulling away and spitting on the floor. His knot throbbed almost painfully inside of Steve. He felt something wet slip down the curve of his neck. He shuddered. "Tony?" He asked quietly, sounding almost afraid. "What-- what was that?"
Tony paced frantically, a ball of tension and energy, dander up, eyes cloudy with fury.
"Well, that's what I feel, I feel hungry!"
Steve laughed gently and shivered at the drag of Tony's tongue. He leaned in to kiss the corner of his mouth slowly, tenderly and then moved to hoist Tony up with almost no effort. "How can I refuse an offer like that?" he asked in a murmur, Brooklyn accent creeping through.
?" blurted Tony, looking around.  He felt weird, his limbs heavy, like they were filled with liquid instead of muscle.
- that feels good..."
Tony squinted; he thought he saw Steve, the outline of him elbowing a man at the base of his neck.  The man dropped limply.
"--and in case you're wondering, no, sorry, we
"I could really go for a taco," hummed Donner.
Tony sat on the edge of the bed, unable to comfort Steve properly.  He put a hand on his shoulder but that was it. He couldn't fucking believe this.
, getting into a passenger seat without a word. They'd always been like that- so in sync. It had made them good on the battlefield during the war, even if off it they'd barely been talking.
"I'm sorry," he murmured again, softly.  He felt like it was his fault, driving Steve to be reckless, and that, in turn, his fault for Steve ending up here with a forced bond mark on his neck.
"What are you... checking?" asked Tony.
"He's a nursing omega, you idiot!"  Pepper gave Tony a light slap over the head.  (She didn't bother to add that Donner and she probably shared a bra size; both were somewhere in the lower B range.)
Steve sighed. He thought back to the way he used to fawn over Bucky in the forties on the good days. He thought he was his world. He thought he was amazing...it was usually in pre-heats. Before the frustration kicked in Bucky used to
Tony hugged Steve back, nuzzling into his strong, broad chest.  He shivered when Steve whispered into his ear, but couldn't quite shake the anxiety that always accompanied sobriety.  Two drinks?  In a whole day?  Tony needed a damned bottle.  But Steve seemed so happy and he couldn't stand to take that away, so he nodded slightly.  They could bargain later.
you could get away with, you couldn't. This is the day you regret ever thinking you could do this to us." He squared right up to her. Melinda was tall, especially in her heels. She was a dominating Alpha but Steve was full of a righteous and quiet kind of fury and he stared her right down.

Maybe Karpov could help them.
be grateful," Rhodey said. "And I think he would be, if he wasn't so... scared."
He moved to tuck his face against the crook of Tony's shoulder. When he closed his eyes it felt like his vision was spinning so it was better to keep them open. Steve was semi-aware of his surroundings for the rest of the drive, curled into Tony's side the whole time.  Mostly he was surprised at himself.  Aria had warned him about celebrity culture but he hadn't realized how easy it was to get sucked in; he'd thought she had been exaggerating.  He hadn't been drunk since, what, '42, '43?  This was something else, for sure.  He was glad he hadn't taken the little candies Trey had given him.
Steve shrugged. "I don't know. I survived, I guess; wasn't much time for much else."
What?
"I think we'll have enough of a problem with you following orders already," Steve pointed out dryly. The Nat/Clint backstory was a complicated one, one he wasn't fully aware of yet. He knew it had been a messy time- a lot of fighting and a lot of-
Steve stared back.  His neck was searing.  Bucky had "fixed" it, all right.
He had expected Pepper to arrive first (after all, she lived only twenty miles east and it was the middle of the night, no traffic) so he was surprised when he heard a thump on the window.  He looked up; Sam was pushing his googles up onto his head.
"Shit."
Tony swallowed.  Would it be wrong of him to pursue this?  He could be playing into Fury's plan.  Who knew anymore?  Nothing had been certain these last two years, ever since Afghanistan.  Everything in his life was completely back-asswards.  His assistant was now his CEO and his omega was an undercover agent and he'd been dying and now he wasn't, and Justin fucking Hammer was trying to get his foot into the door of the Expo--
"He's not dead, look, he's breathing."
Tony's face broke into a grin.
But inhaling Steve's scent, pressing into the warm solidness of his body...
for a while?  You're acting all screwy.  You're safe now, you can calm down."  Steve's domineering attitude was usually charming, but right now, Bucky was feeling annoyed by Steve acting like
Donner beamed and nodded.
He squirmed a little when Tony's hand slipped back down, his thighs shiny with soap.
the one who wanted to do a second run, you're fine... Everything is fine, right?  You're fine.  Come on, let's get you water. Let's go somewhere quiet."
"Your lung capacity is slightly above average.  Looks like you bounced back pretty good.  Any other drugs?"
He sighed and then glanced up at his mate. The edges of his lips twitched up in the hint of a smile. "You
"Oh, that.  ...nope," said Tony.
He heard the softest of pleased gasps from Steve as his fingers slid over his spine; he shifted a little; the noise got him aroused in an instant.  Steve had said he
. He knew Sharon (or at least, "Kate the nurse," her undercover alias) swore by it. She said it got her through the day to day.  Steve traced his fingertips around the curve of the arc reactor idly, his expression becoming distant. "I know you said sex wasn't a big to deal to you," he whispered. "But it's a big deal to me. That only you've touched me."
wants a follow-up one. And someone called Tyler Swift, I think, wants me to be in their next music video.  ...do you know who those people are?"
"Didja bring the shield?" repeated Cooper.
Pepper reached over and grabbed the flask out of Tony's hand.  "Tony. Is this about Afghainstan?” She gestured to her neck.
He waited until Steve had left the room to pull out a digital blood analyzer.  He pricked his finger and checked it.  Toxicity: 19%.  That seemed high.  He gave the analyzer a small shake, as if that might change the number, but of course, it didn’t.  He tucked it away.  19%.  He forced his hands to be steady as he tied his tie.  It was where Steve had said it was, neatly folded in the medium brown bag.  Tony took a deep, steadying breath before going downstairs to meet Steve, his face a carefully controlled mask, hidden behind both his expression of fixed neutrality and a pair of aviator sunglasses worth several thousand dollars.  “Let’s rock and roll,” he said, smiling broadly.  The paparazzi had already crowded around outside the hotel.
Tony waited for Steve to wander away before he scooped up the mess on the floor, the vase (now cracked) and the tulips.  He knew there was no card, but looked for one anyway.
Guiltily, he thought about how hot he'd thought it was when Steve wore that damned collar.
"Well, we could go out for a meal, or to the cinema--"
"I, er, made them myself."
"Thanks," said Tony, grabbing one and following Kerry outside.  He felt better about being around an Alpha and simultaneously felt terribly guilty for preferring Kerry's company over, say, Ian's.
He was okay.
"Sorry, he got shot?  Like-- like with a
He heard Gene's name tossed around a few times, but never commented. It wasn't his place to.
Natasha shrugged dismissively. Steve's phone pinged.
Number Nineteen reached up for the microphone and smiled politely. Gail awkwardly handed it over, like she truly didn't know what to do anymore.
him?  In one of his own suits?
He reached behind Steve's ear and felt his neck.  Soft, warm, dry. Not a single bump or dimple to indicate where the fuck the stupid scent glands even were.
"About two minutes."
"I found him downstairs," Rhodey said and Steve sighed.
And then suddenly it all made sense. It all clicked. The attitudes. The recklessness. The goddamn smoothies. It all made perfect sense.
Then he heard it. A scuffle behind him. Steve whipped around. Nothing. "Tony?" He called out and then frowned when he got no response.
And at least in that sense, they were made for each other.
"Oh, hi," said Tony casually, his hips bucking up to press himself between Steve's legs.  He tilted his head aside and tilted the bottle back.  "...You, um, you're here now. Hi."  He leaned forward suddenly to kiss Steve's nipple, drawing his tongue over it, feeling Steve's skin pebble in response.  His back arched and his whole body moved in to Tony's touch.
"...hi.  Wow. Oh, wow.  Wow. Hi," he said, clearly not expecting a rumpled-looking Tony Stark to answer his own front door.
"No way.  JARVIS is my friend," said Tony.
Steve had woken to fever; it was the first time in his life he'd experienced a real heat.  He'd been so scared he'd wanted to cry; half his unit was unbonded Alphas and they were in the middle of nowhere.  So what if he was a supersoldier; he was still an omega, far from home, vulnerable and emotional and weak with need.  He'd emerged from his tent pale and shaking; the men had looked up at him.
But this was fine, too.  This work was less thrilling but just as important.
"He's in heat, too."
The room she led them to was oddly cozy.  It had a sofa and a rug; it looked almost homely.  Tony and Steve took the sofa. Natasha grabbed a chair and sat opposite them.
Steve sighed and leaned back into Tony's touch. He let his eyes slip shut briefly, just savouring the touch. Tony had been hidden away in the lab for far too long, he felt. He turned around in his arms and ran his hands down Tony's shoulders and arms. Steve leaned his head against Tony's forehead and sighed yet again. "I know. I know I don't need your approval, but I want it Tony, okay? Because it means something to me," he murmured.  "But please. Go sleep." Steve kissed his forehead, thumbs brushing against Tony's collarbone. "I want you at your best.  It will take me about six hours to sort through everything SHIELD's sent me," he said quietly and stepped back, his shoulders already less tense now him and Tony were finally agreeing. It was a relief. He hated to go into a fight in a bad mood. "I'll wake you up with waffles and coffee when I'm done, okay?"
"--yeah, and I said I was sorry, okay?  SHIELD wants to recruit you but there were questions regarding your stabili--"
Another possibility had occurred to Bucky, a terrible one.  Perhaps that other Alpha was Steve's war Alpha. "War Alphas" weren't uncommon during the Great War, or during the Second War, either.  Omegas like Steve needed protection and with their Alphas away, they sought out new companionship. If the Alpha didn't return, they'd rebond; if the Alpha did return, they'd simply go back to them.  Or, sometimes, the Alphas would duke it out and to the victor go the spoils. Bucky had known it was a possibility that Steve might seek out a temporary Alpha for protection; God knew the scrawny little guy needed it.  But wasn't the war over? Bucky was stateside now, he was

"--take his clothes off or destroy my kitchen?"
"Right, but you're not gonna fly a helicopter into the--"

was, it was big.
"Mmmm?" suggested Tony, mouth full.  He pressed his fingers against Steve's puckered entrance.  Steve whimpered and rocked into them needily. Tony didn't need any more encouragement than that; he pushed a pair of fingers into Steve, feeling the way Steve's body gripped them greedily.  Steve was just as wet and warm and inviting as Tony remembered. He bobbed his head on Steve's cock, moving his fingers languidly in and out of his body, the palm of his hand brushing over Steve's balls.  Steve's body was a tense, quivering mess; he kept feeling an unintentional arc, followed by a shuddery tensing as Steve resisted the urge to buck into his mouth and push himself down on Tony's fingers.
"Right, shall we try again?" Louis said, with a warm smile. Steve dropped his hands back down into his lap.   "As I was saying, Steve, you're in preheat, yes? What was your experience of this kind of thing in the forties?"
. "I suffered alone. Is that what you wanna hear? Jesus, Tony. It's really none of your goddamn business." And it wasn't, but Steve was telling him anyway. "I don't have anyone. I won't be getting 'knocked up'. Don't you worry."
"I'm here to help you."
"...how are we feeling?"
to him every morning.
"I know it's been a while, Buck," Steve breathed, his tone patient and admittedly manipulative. He moved up onto his knees.  "Do I need to show you what being bonded means? Why would we should never hurt each other?"
When Tony curled up behind him he did feel a little better. Steve let his eyes slip shut. Then he felt his mate nudge close to the glands behind his ears. "Tony." Steve's hand fisted in the sheet in front of him. "I dunno if I... if I feel like... I don't think I do. Sorry."
"Good morning, Steven," said a pleasantly, oily voice.  One that Steve knew all too well.
"Tony," he said softly, encouraging the Alpha to look up at him. His voice was raw, open and honest. "They're perfect. It's perfect."
and everything, he really believed in me, I'm sure that--"  Tony was aware that a note of hysteria was rising his his tone.  "--sure that there's a fucking recipe in his notes somewhere for a new element that I can just put in my body, no problem, probably right between his lemon cake recipe and a note telling me how
Tony flipped open the pamphlet.  His gaze landed on the phrase
"He was... trying to take me back, or take me away, I guess. The problem is, you let your Alpha treat you like an object once, it never stops. I let my first Alpha get away with so much. The way he treated me wasn't okay. And he's come back and assumed he can do the same. Because... because I guess that's how we were raised.  But that's not acceptable anymore.  Not in this century.  The problem is, if you're bought by an Alpha...that's already setting a very dangerous precedent. I met an omega last night whose been shot by his Alpha before. His Alpha makes him fight other omegas for entertainment. But then I found out that he doesn't even
"I thought it was real. I thought I was him in the drive. I asked him who he was and he said he didn't know. And there's tulips- everyone else has sent orchids. But
-- oh, God, it's so bitter."  He grabbed a corner of the sheets and dragged his tongue over it, desperate to get the taste out of his mouth.
"I know a girl in Stark Industries HR who'd be perfect for him," said Tony.  "She's an eight, maybe a nine. Drop-dead gorgeous. He works with people too, right?  I say we hook 'em up."
"Lucky number seven," agreed Tony.  He stopped suddenly. Sam walked into him, the suit solid and cold in the basement.
Tony cringed when he heard the snap.
His mind flashed back to the cave.  To the smell of cigarettes, and then the smell of burning flesh, of being held down, pinned, the back of his neck--
"A man tried to buy me when I was nearly seventeen. He was about your age," Steve told him.
"I think I can find home here." He hoped he already had. "But, I don't want to rush it... you know? I haven't even been awake six months, Tony," Steve pointed out. It felt strange to say it. So much had happened in such a short space of time. And he'd already mated and moved in with his Alpha and even driven a supercar.
He looked down at the cup in his hands.  His hands were shaking.
He watched Piper dance away to the bar. She skipped like a school girl. And did she just call him
"Hey, DeSoto.  Question. Bad omegas... they get sent to auction, right?  Do you know anything about that?"
"We better go.  We'll never hear the end of it if we arrive after a Honda," said Tony quietly, stroking Steve's waist softly.

"Aside from your publicists, you would do well to schedule meetings with your lawyers.  Dr. Gleason, Dr. Brazinski, and Dr. Brennan all request to see Captain Rogers on a daily basis for the next week.  Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes, the Undersecretary of Defense, the director of the CIA, and Gideon Malick of the World Security Council all require briefings with Captain Rogers and Mr. Stark, separately."
"Ha ha.  Knot."
Pepper looked at Phil and Steve helplessly.  This was worse than she thought.  Even though Tony and Steve were both intelligent, capable people, they were still at the mercy of their own bodies, and clearly, the air was thick with pheromones she couldn't sense.  She didn't trust Tony anywhere near Steve.  And she knew it was going to get worse before it got better.  "...do you think... do you think you can handle the plane ride back?" she asked delicately.
"Don't," she advised.
"Are you hurt, Mr Stark?"
"Tony.  I'm ordering you."
Tony's eyes followed them out of the room and he didn't speak until he heard the front door close, then he looked at Steve.  "...lots of therapy, huh? That sucks. ...this doesn't have anything to do with Eighty-Four, does it?" He took a swig from the carton, keeping his eyes focused on Steve, reading him.  Tony had meant to ask him earlier but forgotten. He'd heard about half of the conversation between Steve and the shrinks, though, and their talk about how Steve was always creating conflicts and battles to run into had jogged his memory.  He was starting to wonder if Eighty-Four was going to be one of those battles that ultimately got them in trouble and made Fury give them the stink eye. Steve's "projects" seemed to revolve madly around giving away money and making enemies, something Tony happened to be great at himself.  Still, he wanted to make sure they weren't running into another AU conference-type situation; his heart just couldn't take it. And besides, he wasn't sure if he'd gotten the squirrel costume back yet.
"Yes, sir.  ...the files are encrypted."
"My money has certainly killed less people than Stark's has."
"I apologize," repeated Tony, quietly, more calmly, more sincerely.  He cleared his throat and reached up to rub his arc reactor awkwardly.
Steve wasn't there, however. There was no sign of him. It was eleven in the morning, according to the green numbers flashing on the clock on the nightstand. Underneath the clock sat a sticky note that read "
His eyes snapped open and the first thing he was aware of was a tightness in his crotch.
. Steve felt a strange need to kiss him.
"I should probably go after him," she said apologetically and then slunk away. Steve noticed that she didn't head towards Dan's direction. Maybe he wasn't nice when he was angry. Lots of peoples' heads had turned, most of them watching a furious Dan march away. Steve struggled to hide the smile on his face.
"N-no," he grit out. "No piece of shit Alpha d-does-" It was hard for Steve to get out coherent sentences. He was terrified of his instincts taking over, of something dreadful happening.
He tossed the ledger aside and went back to searching through the old family memorabilia.
"Good morning, my star-spangled honeybear," he said to Steve, smirking at him.  Occasionally Tony liked to try to embarrass him, which wasn't hard, actually.
"Well, then he doesn't deserve you Steven," Peggy said simply and something sank in Steve's gut. He wished people would stop saying that. Like they knew what he deserved… like they all knew the terrible things Steve had done in the past in the name of justice. "Did you get a hotel? You must be exhausted."
"Yeah," said Tony, stomach turning a little.  "We, uh... we... I guess we lost one recently?"
Steve let out a soft huff.
When Steve was in heat, that all flew out the window.
someone
Her look grew stormy.  "You're no better than he is!" she snapped, and she whirled and stomped off.  Since they'd been traveling with the damaged Alpha, Pietro noticed they'd been fighting a lot more than ever before.  They had never had a third party before and it was interrupting the dynamic they'd developed over the years. The fact that the third party was a member of the binary status groups (as opposed to a neutral "beta") was making things worse, because Pietro and he could smell each other, while Wanda couldn't.
“Nooo, daddy! Real cookies!” Peter ignored his father’s affronted gasp as he crammed his tiny fingers between the lid and the container to try and pry the top off. “He made them from scratch, like with flour and eggs, not a bag of cookie dough.”
For half a second the billionaire wished he hadn't gone through such extensive lengths to keep his son's identity hidden from the public. It's not that he was ashamed, he just wanted his son to grow up as far from the spotlight as possible. That meant a restraining order on the press that would end in a lawsuit if any pictures of his kid ended up in the papers or the news.
“Depends,” she hummed, looking out to the pond that was only starting to defrost after a long, cold winter. “Are we talking about what happened at Stark’s or the fact that you’re not getting any sleep at night?” She gave him a sharp, knowing look.
"And you must be Mr. Rogers," Tony drawled, looking the teacher over. "Although I gotta say, I expected more sweaters and khakis and less long legs and rippling muscles."
“Would you stop that?” Steve hissed as soon as the waitress hurried back to the kitchen. “And, yeah. Maybe I’m a little over protective, but it doesn’t seem like anybody else is giving him the time of day!”
As it was, he had his phone in his hand, hovering over the button to call Natalie and see if she could come in short notice to watch Peter while he went out. He was practically shaking for a bottle of scotch right now.
“It’s absolutely stunning, Pete. We’ll have to show them as soon as possible and not a second later. It’s decided,” Tony nodded like it was official business, making his son giggle. He pointed to the orange blob floating to the left of Pepper. “What’s this?”
“It’s getting late. I should get home,” The blonde muttered, going to where he had thrown his jacket across the counter when he first came in. “I’m helping a neighbor move tomorrow and then I’ve got work in the afternoon.”
Steve couldn’t help but wonder if Pepper and Tony were together again. Not that it was any of his business, but the thought chewed at the back of his mind, much to his chagrin.
“Hey, I’m not complaining!” Tony pushed past the quiet, somber mood and tried to smile widely. “Lasers are much cooler than that hideous thing. Rogers totally got the short end of the stick here.”
“Well, no. He didn’t, but-”
“That’s enough outta you, son. You’ve got two options here,” The man started, bending at the waist so he could look his unruly child in the eyes. “One; you can walk out to the car yourself like a big boy. Or two; I pick you up, kicking and screaming, and take you to the car on my own. Your choice.”
Steve had fought tooth and nail to save his best friend and hundreds of other men who had sacrificed everything for their country. He helped free over four hundred men. He made the front of the newspaper back home.
After Tony had maneuvered Peter out of the carseat and up to his bedroom, he had flopped back onto the couch. It took all of his willpower to not hightail it to the closest open bar just in order to avoid having to face the fact that this whole situation was his fault, and his fault alone.
It’s not like you get to see the whole picture when you only meet-up with somebody once a month for an hour. Bucky’s free to call and come in whenever if there’s any problems with the arm whatsoever, but Tony’s not stupid. He knows Barnes would never do that and barely gets through these small appointments as it is.
“New babysitter?” she queried, raising an eyebrow.
Peter continued to play with his matchbox cars, back turned to his dad.
“Right. On that heartwarming note, come give me a hug, booger boy,” the genius rolled his eyes, but there wasn’t any hiding the fond smile that the boy had put on his face.
“Bye, Peter,” Pepper smiled, blowing the six year old a quick kiss before grabbing one of Tony’s bags despite his protests. “Shut it, we’re going to go load up the plane. You go brief the babysitter, then meet us there, you have five minutes.” she muttered, giving the genius a pointed look.
“Goodbye, Tony.”
“Please tell me you didn’t bone the guy who makes Bucky’s prosthetics,” Sam sighed, smacking at the pair of legs in front of him before just leaving them there to use as lumpy arm rests.
The other heroes also came down to help when they saw the Captain's insane action, helping him save some civilians, but they were still shooting heavily at Stark and the others, so they couldn't get them out.
“Make a toast for me, and if you can pay for me too I would also appreciate it”. said Stark with a big smile.
"Never, especially with the birthday gifts you give me."
“Yes, I suppose it affected her too much and that is why she is looking for a distraction like planning a protest with the women of the town, so men will stop seeing us only as objects... although she generalizes things, surely his husband wasn't like that, and surely the friend of her husband is not like that either". The woman gave him a smile that was surely classified as prohibited at that time.
“Welcome Tony”. Sang in unison as they wiggled and sending kisses to him. He smiled while sat in front of the bar, he didn’t plan to lose consciousness, it was only to cold off the heat of that strong summer day.
“Not enough”. He looked up, challenging those blue eyes to look at him. Tony did not see but Steve was about to take his hand, although at the end he cowered, making a fist. “I'm tired of this”.
“You did not do that”.
"It's Friday ... today ... can I stay?" Steve asked looking at him hopefully, and he couldn't refuse those puppy eyes, so he nodded and the blonde smile.
“It's just to cool off, I'll go to the workshop now, have to invent a machine to erase your memory and avoid the day when I said you could control how much alcohol I drink”.
“Tony...”
"Leave me, I know I was selfish, I just thought that if you knew the truth you would hate me as you hate Iron Man"
“Carry me. Daddy gets tired too quick, says ‘m too big,” The tired boy mumbled, continuing to reach up towards the blonde.
In fact, he had just finished setting up the watercolor sets just a little bit ago.
“Hey! What makes you think Mr. Rogers can carry you any better than I can?”
“Peter’s a sweet boy, it’s no trouble at all,” Rogers looked like he had something more he wanted to stay, but after a beat of awkward silence, it was obvious he wasn’t going to talk any time soon.
“Daddy? Are you ok?” He asked softly, patting his father’s knees. “Do you want me to call Unca Rhodey to help you breath?”
“Everytime daddy comes back from a long trip, we come her for cheeseburgers and ice cream,” the first grader informed him before crawling into the booth they had been led to. It was a corner booth, one of the seats that were wrapped in a circle around the table so both adults could sit on either side of Peter.
“Mr. Rogers, huh?” Natalie smiled and shook her head. “It’s getting late I should be off. Goodnight, Mr. Stark.”
“Tony, could you relax for just three minutes, here?” Pepper groaned, whacking the arm holding his phone with a manilla folder. “Nobody likes a helicopter parent.”
“Uh-huh, yeah,” Tony murmured, only distantly hearing the babysitter speak to him, as the room around him faded in and out of focus. “And how did he...how did he come up with this?”
Tony set his briefcase on the counter and immediately began to dig through the fridge. “So how did things fare here in the big apple while I was MIA?”
Peter giggled and shoved his dad’s hand away from the page. “No, that’s mama,” the six year old informed him, voice softer than it had been just a few seconds prior. “Ned said when his grandma died that she went upstairs to heaven and now she watches over him and his family. I don’t know about heaven or nothin’, but I think that mama is probably watching over me like the sun or somethin’.”
“What’s up, Peter?” the teacher asked as he got up from his seat as well.
“Please, call me Mr. Hogan,” the man grumbled, reluctantly shaking the blonde’s hand. Steve didn’t take it personally, he doesn’t think he’s ever once seen the man smile.
Peter had been rather grumpy in the morning, it wasn’t all that surprising seeing as he was usually a bit more subdued after Tony spent the weekend working.
“Oh, of course. That makes total sense,” Steve was holding back laughter as he played along.
“You hungry, Gizmo? ‘Cause if we don’t eat soon, it’ll be midnight, and everybody knows you can’t feed gremlins after midnight,” It was hardly even seven in the evening, but that wasn’t important.
“Ah-ah-ah, Peter’s friend. I’m still very dedicated to my life of solitude and I have a strict ‘no fraternizing with the parents’ rule.”
“Yeah! Like one time we got gummy bears on the ice cream!”
By 5:30, like usual, it was just Ned and Peter left in the room. Steve was trying in vain to pick up an overturned bowl of sequins that he would most likely be cleaning out of the rug for the rest of the school year when he heard a knock on the door frame.
"Wanna grab a pie?" asked Bucky conversationally.  He was starving. Literally. Because he had no money and hadn't eaten in well over a day.  The idea of eating a pizza, a real Brooklyn pizza, along with a pitcher of beer and maybe a couple of cigarettes, was so appealing it made his mouth water just thinking about it.  He hadn't had food or beer or, most importantly, nicotine in well over forty-eight hours, and he felt like shit. "I went by Hanley's earlier. D'you know they let in horseshoes now?  What'd you say?"
Shameless bonding, sex, smut, and other fun stuff.  Enjoy.
Then Sam was gone. Steve headed back upstairs and began flicking through articles Aria had forwarded to him:
"Yeah.  You with HYDRA?" called the man back.
"You should stop listening to him.  He's poison to your mind," said the omega, pulling out a packet of gum.  "If everyone were equal, then he wouldn't order you around like a dog, and you wouldn't have to listen to him."
...he hoped.
None of the three of them had enough experience or knowledge to realize that putting a heavily pregnant omega into an enclosed area with pair in heat, both of them dripping with pheromones, was a sure-fire way to induce labor.  Even if not for the extreme amount of pheromones in the air, the stress of seeing Gideon and Steve probably would have done it.
"Just crack, Mom, God!  And no one calls it--"
Tony let out a sigh and looked down, twisting his hands in his lap.  Tony was no good at talking about feelings and he hated it when his hands were idle.  If he wasn't working, then at least he liked to be turning a Rubik's cube or knitting (something he'd sworn Pepper, Steve, Happy, and Rhodey to secrecy).
He thought about the chances of Tony getting attacked...Steve guessed being mated to each other just made them a bigger target; two birds, one stone.
"No," he whispered hoarsely without realizing it.  "No..."
Clint smiled up.  "Well... if you were an Alpha, I sure as hell would be," he said.
"What?" asked Tony, clearly not paying attention, cuddling up to Steve, playing with the sleeve of his t-shirt.
Steve's voice broke a little.
"Many artists have offered to perform, including a few comedians. We're thinking we pick the best, the ones most likely to draw in viewers," Pepper said. "And maybe slip Steve into a song or two, for the 'hype'." She gave Steve a warm look, but he looked slightly terrified at the idea.
news stories, Jarv, not boring ones.  Y'know, something the government would care about.  ...I wanna start keeping tabs on SHIELD.  They've already been keeping tabs on me, for months, apparently.  We've got a lot of catching up to do.  And I need to find Barton."
The call ended, he was left wondering what to do or what to say, it lasted a couple of hours until he couldn't take it anymore and he opened the door, watching Steve standing by the window.
"Dang, I knew we can't count on him." That hurt Stark's soul, did Steve really think that way?
The Sheriff get up, cleaning the hay from his naked body, trying not to panic like the other man while he remember exactly how they end up there.
"You should lie down" Tony murmured closing the door behind him, but Steve ignored him. "You should-"
"You should come with me to drink more often, Sheriff, they do not seem to behave like dogs when authority is near," said the girl looking and winking at him. "Or we could drink at my place."
The battle was getting difficult, the bad guys were well organized and resistant enough, there were hostages so they simply could not fight them, they would harm them or threaten them.
"Tony, I don't hate Iron Man, I don't hate you, we just ... we just think too differently but I couldn't hate him, or hate you" he was starting to get confused and smiled.
Tony almost laughed because the blond clearly had not caught the direct message from the lady.
“Hurry up, we need to get the civilians out of here, where's Iron Man?” Tony heard as the captain shouted to the team.
“But you hate this too! You hate us... our thing...” Tony felt the tears go down his eyes, he did not know if it was the alcohol or the feeling that was clenching in his chest. The blonde wrapped him in his arms quickly.
Although it is true in the old west it will always feel like summer. Always warm like hell.
* * *
"Thanks Stark, maybe you aren’t an Avenger, but you have helped in the only way that you could, with your money," Steve once said to him and Tony had nothing more to say:
"Don’t say that, I promise you that in all the other lives I will do it, I will show you all my affection without fear" They both stared at each other, because there were times when being able to dedicate those looks was enough.
"We have to make a plan" someone had said but Rogers ignored them, getting off the ship and throwing his shield at the closest enemy to Tony, the shield bounced off a wall and get back to his arm, Stark was impressed.
“Stark, I thought we had made a deal”.
“You said you were going to moderate your problem...” The blonde with blue eyes said in a low voice approaching the other, he did not want to make a scene in public.
"Mhm" he muttered affirmatively.
“The only information that lady wants to give you is between her legs, you fool”.
“No, sheriff, you asked me to make a deal and I did not agree.” He held up his hand and the second glass was placed in front of him.
"Do what?"
Tony walked angrily to his workshop, where he rummaged through his things until he found half a bottle of liquor, tilting it to drink as much as possible in a sip. He puts it on the table and begins to decide which of his inventions to continue today but someone knocked on his door so he grabbed the bottle again and went to open, taking another long sip.
"Okay, I'll put the flowers in water, get comfortable, there's still pizza" Stark mentioned, pointing to the box on the center table as he went to the kitchen. When he was back he saw Steve sitting stiff in the single chair, Tony smiled mischievously and went to sit on his legs.
Steve stared at him, thinking, he really had not hit on those hints at first and although he figured it out, late, he still did not understand Tony’s discomfort for it.
"You're a..." Tony sighed deeply "Never leave me Potts."
“Jealous?” Tony was laughing very falsely while he finished dressing. “Now I know the size of your balls, Rogers, but don’t give yourself too much credit”.
They were both panting, the blue-eyed blonde began to accelerate his movements while the brunette tried his best to hold on with both hands to the large glass window, still managed to see the beautiful beach of Malibu.
Both greet cordially, the man with the plate making a movement with his hat. The lady requested and took in a single sip the drink of alcohol.
That's right, the honorable Captain America did not know that Tony Stark was Iron Man.
“Look who it is, did the officer decided at what time will go to his intimate date with the lady?” He is already affected by the amount of alcohol that entered quickly on his system. Tony pushed him off his shoulder, walking out of his garage. “I do not want to see you right now”.
It had been difficult to convince the other that he would never, for any reason, take off his shirt or any upper garment, it would be very obvious to have the reactor that was exactly the same as Iron Man, it had been difficult because he saw the disappointment on Steve’s face, Tony can tell because of his puppy eyes that Rogers thought that for him he was only a sexual partner, perhaps one of many, but the idiot have no idea that he had not been with anyone else since him. It had been at first because he was exhausted and very satisfied thanks to the blonde, but later simply because he doesn’t desire anyone else.
“Tell me more about this protest” says Steve interested while Tony rolls his eyes once again because it seems incredible that the man doesn't understand Sharon’s games.
The previous day, the sun was right at the top of the sky when Anthony Stark entered the bar, hearing sounds of wasted men arguing, others playing cards, some women staring with shameless smiling in the second floor.
"Are you crazy? Exposing yourself like that, why didn't you tell me?"
"Mr. Stark, Miss Pepper on the line" Jarvis announced. Tony huffed as he began to hear the redhead's screams and sermons.
They both laughed and a third glass settled in front of the mechanic, who moved it towards Steve.
“I'm in perfect condition, just stop moving”. He holds his head, he's dizzy.
"And if it was up to me too, Steve," he interrupted, looking up into his eyes, the blond smiled and leaned down to kiss him.
"Yes, in fact yes, but I promise you it will be a maximum of two hours, I will run away and return to spend the whole day with you."
"These six months have been great because I have you by my side."  Six months? Wow, time flies, it was incredible for Tony to keep a secret and especially so long.
"I'm coming, I'm coming" Tony expressed as he walked to the door, opening and being surprised by the huge bouquet of white roses, a giant bear and a box of... were those chocolates?, the blonde behind, holding all this, dressed in his usual brown pants, his plaid shirt and his hair arranged back. "Flowers, stuffed animals and chocolates, I don't know why it surprises me from an old man" he joked as Steve passed by, taking the gifts when they were in the living room.
An unfamiliar person opened it, a woman in a bathrobe.
"Captain Rogers!  Captain Rogers, is it true you're letting your mate collar you?"
"You know, the day your piece came out, our membership went up drastically. As did Horseshoe's, I believe. It was a spike that lasted a couple of days. You touched a lot of people, Captain," Ty breathed as he stared down at the water of the pool. It shimmered under the sun. "It was quite something. Not just coming out, but... well, being alive at all.  I couldn't believe it. I mean, the whole world thought you were dead."
For a moment, the two of them lay there, panting.
"Tony?"
"I don't care," said Wanda.  "...anywhere but here. For your own safety, Pietro.  We have to get rid of him.  Now."
"Three different omega rights groups?  How come there's no
By the time they got anywhere near the maternity ward, they'd already been there two hours.
"Georgina, get back--" began the man on the phone.  "--holy shit!" the young man muttered when he saw Steve.
Malick shut up, and nodded to Tony, deferring to Tony to order for his omega.
"Hmm... Steve, what'd you think?  This one's pretty calm."
Happy didn't take the hint.  "Oh, great! What about 'em?"
Richard patted his arm.  "Sure thing. You just take it easy for now.  No pushing yet. Make sure you stay hydrated and I'll check in every hour, okay?  So far, everything looks great. Congratulations, Donner."
"Love you, 'mega.  G'night," Tony breathed onto Steve's neck, relaxing against him, erection pressed into his thigh.
."  A third voice, sharp and hard and commanding.
"Normally Steve would do it."  Tony felt a twist in his stomach.  He'd felt
"You're the best, Happy," said Tony, climbing into the back of the Audi and opening the container of soup.  His eating habits, Steve had come to learn over the last few weeks, were at best strange and at worst almost inhuman.  Tony ate when he felt like it, and ate what he wanted to; his wealth let him request nearly anything at any time, and he had no qualms about taking advantage of that.
What did those words mean? They were random. Steve wasn't sure he even understood all of them but they clearly meant something to the soldier. Who snapped. The cold metal fingers against his neck were choking and all of a sudden Steve was struggling to breathe. And he was no longer frozen. Steve
"I guess we'll see when the time comes," Steve said, feeling like that was the appropriate middle ground answer. He squeezed Tony's hand again. He could feel that he was uncomfortable.
"Where
"Hey, Tony, aren't you coming?  I really think you could get a lot out of Frond's talk!" called Eric, gesturing.
"Yes, sir."
All at once everyone snapped into place, and Tony let out a blood-curling scream, flinging himself to the ground.
"I mean, I'd consider a three--"
Steve opened the letter and frowned. "It's... are these tickets? For Tony Stark plus one?" He dropped them on the table, not knowing what they were for.
"Asshole!" Steve made a noise of anger and threw his phone against the wall. It didn't break. Small mercies.
Suddenly he felt a punch to his gut.
" bellowed Tony.
"Why..." His hands twisted up in the sheets, his words directed at no one in particular. "Why did you-- what did I do wrong?"
"Hey." Steve reached across the table and brushed his fingers against Tony's. "You're not 'following in his footsteps.' I know I didn't know your dad all that well, but being something like Iron Man, and what that represents, that's not him.  That's
“I can assure you, I’m not. What makes you say that?”
It’s hard to imagine Peter is content spending basically the entire day away from his dad, but despite all that, the kid is constantly singing his praise. If he wasn’t such a stickler for science, Steve was sure the kid was convinced his father hung the moon.
But, lo and behold, the monday after their Valentine’s day dinner, Tony rang him up and asked if Steve would be available to watch his son over the weekend.
Well, googled is a loose term, seeing as he was pacing in front of a holo-screen in the living room after he had put Peter to bed for the night.
“Thanks for watching my rugrat,” Tony shrugged. “You got paypal? I’ll give you the cash through paypal.” he muttered, as he started to walk out of Peter’s room and back towards the living room.
“Cut the shit, Tony. I want to hear out of your own mouth that you know and acknowledge we have something scheduled tomorrow and that you will be there,” Pepper groaned. “This is important!”
It isn't often that Steve Rogers has a minute to sit and do nothing and wonder about the circumstances that brought him to where he is today.
“I don’t want Miss Natalie to be my babysitter anymore, she doesn’t read any of my books right. Doesn’t use any of the voices,” Peter flopped over, wrapping both his tiny arms around Steve’s considerably larger one. “I want you to be my babysitter now. You can do really good drawings an’ you like superheroes an’ I bet you could throw me like a basketball too. That would be cool.”
“You totally have baby fever, Stevie,” There it was. That slimy bastard.
“Nooo! You’re just getting old, daddy!” Peter laughed, trying to shove Tony’s hands away.
No, he wasn’t going to get drunk tonight. He wasn’t going to make things worse by leaving his son for the third time in a week. He’s Tony fucking Stark and he’s not going to sit here throwing a pity party for any longer than he already has.
Steve glanced up at the ceiling nervously, before heading back into the living room where Peter was watching cartoons.
Not that it seemed to matter, what with Steve being able to read him like an open book.
For the entire weekend.
“What’s wrong with my phone?”
“Don’t be scared!” Peter called out from inside of the fort Steve and him created using the back of the sofa, more chairs, and bed sheets. The thing took up nearly half the living room, obviously built big enough for Rogers to fit in it. “Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is here to save you!” the six year old burst out of the fort, scrambling over the couch. He was wearing one of Tony’s baggy old t-shirts that was an eye-bleeding red at one point but had died down to pink over the years, and there was a fuzzy blue blanket tied around his neck to act as a cape.
“Yeah, the middle finger never seems to pop up fast enough when I’m around my roommate,” Bucky sighed, leaning over to look inside the arm along with Tony.
I'm actually posting Friday's chapter before eleven at night, break out the fuckin champagne! Let's celebrate.
Not trying to think too hard about it, the blonde slunk back to his bike and popped his helmet on.
Peter jumped to his father’s side as if magnetized. “So can Mr. Steve be my new babysitter? Pleeeeease? I’ll make you ‘sketti if you say yes!” the little boy begged, grabbing fistfuls of his dad’s suit jacket and tugging insistently.
“What? No!” Now Bucky was starting to look a little flustered, finally looking away from the genius. “And for your information, his name is Sam. He’s just a friend.”
“Well?” Bucky motioned for the other to keep talking. “Have any of them put the moves on you, Mr. Prude?”
“Get that shit-eating grin off your face before I take it off myself,” Tony groaned, shoving the rag back into his tool kit and shooting the mechanic the nastiest glare he could manage. “That’s it. You’ve lost arm privileges, hand it over.”
“You’re no fun, Rhodey bear,” the Stark huffed, hopping up from the couch and to the elevator. It was Valentines Day afterall, and he felt as though a good drink was in order. A gift to himself. “I’m so scared up here! It’s lonely in this big tall tower, and you never come visit.”
Just that small movement had Natalie’s attention the same as if Tony had jumped onto the counter and screamed, and wasn’t that interesting?
“I think you do. ‘Cause you didn’t even blink when I said I’d slap you silly, but the moment I brought up Steve, suddenly you’re listening?”
“None at all, and if we did I’d have already solved a way to fix that little issue.”
(See the end of the chapter for
ok first off, sorry the last two chapters have literally just been set-up but good news! This was the last one, next chapter is the big date!
“Yep, sure is. Why?” A hint of amusement crept into Sam’s voice. “You lonely? Why don’t you call up your handsome rich boyfriend, see if he can come pick you up?”
Peter raised a skeptical brow up at Steve and the man could barely contain his laughter.
Rogers noticeably softened, giving the first grader a small nod and a smile. “It’s almost Friday, you can go ahead and take all your projects home.”
“Everything good up on Mars, Space Cadet?” Tony snapped his fingers, trying to bring Steve back from wherever he had drifted off to in his thoughts.
The second table had the younger students and some of the more quiet kids.There wasn’t any assigned seating in the art room but it seemed they always sat in around the same places each time.
“Sure thing, Doc. I have noticed this one malfunction, though.”
Ok, so maybe he was still mad.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter, right?” Nat asked, standing up and brushing herself off. “Since you definitely don’t have a crush on Stark, all of that stuff is pointless.” She had the smallest hints of a smug smile on her face as she stared down at a stunned Steve.
“Aw, that’s sweet of you, Peter. I had fun too,” Steve bent down to hug him back, so Peter didn’t just have his arms around his legs. “I’ll see you Monday, ok?”
“Hey guys! I’m just finishing setting up today’s activity. Once everybody’s in here we can start,” Steve called out to the small group of girls who were pulling out chairs at one of the two round tables.
“What a dreamboat. An american hero at his finest,” Tony hummed as he skipped over a link to an article from wikipedia.
Surprisingly the entire building hadn't burst at its seams from their chaotic energy, but they'd had some close calls from what the artist had heard.
Tony thought that would have been enough to get Peter interested, but a wave of disappointment filled him as he watched his son run away and back to his bedroom. God, he had really messed up this time if not even the promise of cookies could get his son to do something as simple as eating dinner with him. The urge to run away multiplied in tenfold, he ruined the one good thing in his life right now. All for some stupid business trips, he was so stupid and a pathetic excuse for-
"Steve!" Tectontic appeared behind them. He grinned down at him. "Hey man, you were looking a little rough last time I saw you..."
"...I knew that," said Tony quietly, offering Steve the key fob.  History had never been his best subject but he knew how few rights omegas had had a century ago.
"You okay, Stark?"
"Before all this I didn't understand why I was here. Why I hadn't died," Steve murmured. "But this... this made it all worth it."
He moved on automatic to make them waffles like he had the night before. This time he did them with bacon and scrambled eggs, glancing over and guiding Tony to the mugs as he made them both hot drinks. For Steve, it was green tea; he ignored Tony's look of disapproval. He needed to get back into his routine.
Karpov swore under his breath.
"I love dismantling security systems," said Tony gleefully.  It was true. To Tony, fences made bad neighbors. He spent a lot of time hacking just for fun.  A way to fine-tune his skills and also to get access to information. The more forbidden the information, the more exciting it was.
Tony ran a finger down the faint, almost invisible treasure trail that ran from Steve's navel to his crotch, the golden hair light and thin and soft.
"Miss Potts has been here all night and has made your breakfast.  She is downstairs with a Dr. David Gleason."
"Nat?  Hel--" began Steve.
"Don't people usually go to a fancy restaurant for their anniversary?" Steve asked and Aria gave him a look. Bucky and him didn't exactly do anniversaries; they'd never had the means to. It was a treat if there was food on the table and Steve wasn't sick.
"Down, boy," said Natasha.  She was only half-joking; Tony's hackles had been up for nearly an hour and he was oozing enough aggression to make even her uncomfortable.  "We want to scare him, not obliterate him. If you're sure about this, c'mon."
about it.  Steve, an omega, pinning Tony, an Alpha.  Tony was feeling the same sort of thrill he got from having the girl on top.  (This happened to be one of his favorite positions.)
"What the fuck's an omegologist?"
it?" asked Tony, incredulous.
Tony had been escorted through all sorts of protests in his forty years.  You made plenty of enemies as a weapons designer. This was the first time he'd ever had to shove through a protest that wasn't directly toward him.  And somehow, that made it worse. Because these people didn't hate Steve for actually killing anyone, which was a pretty legit reason to hate someone.  Tony had been called a killer and a murderer and he'd even had a couple of assassination attempts ("For Sokovia!" A place Tony doubted he'd even be able to find on a map...) but he had always felt a sort of smug sense of deserving.  Like it was an accomplishment, somehow.
"Phil's in there," said Pepper, shoving him out of the room.  (Phil was in his nest; Steve could just barely make out suppressed groans of pain.)
But fear was something inherently simple and universal in all minds.  Even those the belonged to geniuses.  She'd brought him down; now, she only needed to keep him down long enough for her and her brother to have their revenge.
There was a collection of tables and chairs. The courtyard was covered in a blue canopy that draped over small arches they were entwined with vine leaves. It was a gorgeous and homely place and it made something seize in Steve's chest. He squeezed Tony's hand.
The house was gorgeous as they pulled up to it and not too dissimilar in style to their own. Steve and Tony got of their car and could hear a soft rumble of music coming from the house. It wasn't 'booming' but there was definitely a party going on inside. They stepped through the open doors at the entrance to find a house full of famous people. Of course, Steve didn't recognize most of them but he could just tell... famous people were different, their own brand of insane. Especially at parties.
"No!  He's my omega!" shouted Tony.
Tony groaned internally and strode away.  He needed a break and Steve was MIA, probably off signing autographs with one hand while saving someone with the other hand.
"Arranged," said Tony.
"Man, you've been like a ghost, I've been trying to get ahold of you for over a week.  You forget about me or something?  I heard you were on base today and thought we could catch up."
Natasha glanced down at her phone.  Her face betrayed nothing.
"We have plenty of lining options.  Fur is a bit more delicate, and a bit harder to maintain, but we do offer it," suggested Lydia.  "Most of the linings for these are synthetics, designed to breathe... but of course, the drawback is that they can get chilly.  Kitty, you have suede, correct?"
"Great, perfect, I'll meet you there in twenty minutes," said Tony.
Tony was still laughing.  "...the only limit I have is my imagination, weren't you listening, Jarv?  We can make it... we can synthesize it right here, we need... this is easy, we just need to build a particle accelerator... Steve!  Steve, I found it!  ...
Alpha happens to
"Sorry.  He's not yours, though, right?  I didn't peg you as the kind of guy to get possessive.  I mean, I can see
Steve bit his bottom lip. "Fine." He said. "But Tony has the right to turn it off whenever he deems necessary."
"What is the point that you're trying to make, exactly?"
. Natasha had laughed so hard the first time she saw him step into one.  (New York's SHIELD headquarters was old enough to retain some relics from Steve's age; one was the "Ladies and Horseshoes" sign over the showers.  Used to following signs, Steve had followed it without thinking; thankfully, Natasha was embarrassment-proof, and she was kind enough to point him toward the men's showers, where Steve had found other omega men casually changing among unbonded Alphas like it was no big deal.)
"Just in case you ever need reminding that you have a heart," Steve murmured and turned around to run his hands down Tony's arms. "Sorry, I er... ruined your wall."
"Maybe it's a common name in Greece," said Ducky.
Tony padded back to the bedroom, feeling thoroughly exhausted from their conversation, even though it had been short and sweet.  He went to the bar, but all the good stuff was long gone. There was a bottle of red left, a Malbec. Tony grabbed that and flopped onto the bed with the bottle and a corkscrew, hoping if he drank it fast enough he might be able to escape back into unconsciousness.
Wordlessly, Pepper offered him a throw that was draped over the back of the couch; Phil took it and added it to the pile.
"I didn't say he did, I just thought it would make us feel better."
"Well, technically, it was rhodium.  The degradation of palladium to rhodium.  But I'm fine now!  I'm not dying anymore!  Well, in the cosmic sense, we all are, but... Steve, you were my last PA, can you handle this for me?  Oh!  And I need you to buy art supplies.  For the studio."
Steve was getting blood all over everything.  Tony hadn't realized how hard he'd been biting down.  This bite was nothing like the gentle mating bite he'd made when they'd bonded.  This was real, savage. Tony couldn't stop staring at it. He'd thought only morons went feral, and assumed that his intelligence made him immune to it.  Apparently not.
"Dude. I dunno how you went through all that in that time. Think it woulda killed me.  I'd rather have it spaced out."
How to explain to Steve that he'd been drinking for nearly thirty years, daily, and that alcohol was his go-to for joy, sorrow, boredom, anxiety, everything?  That not drinking had become painful, a shaky, sweaty, nauseous experience that Tony would much rather avoid?  He had been drunk at his party, but that had been what, three nights ago?  Since then he'd only had the one drink, and now he was being hit with withdrawal, hard.
Maybe because none of them were really his friends.  Tony could count his friends on one hand, and he hadn't seen any of them, unless you counted Steve.
be an Avenger!" he said petulantly.
"Wait.  Which one do you want us to do?" demanded Tony, throwing an arm around Steve to steady himself.  "Steve... Steve, do you have the keys?  I think I might be a little drunk.  I'm celebrating my new job," he explained to the bartender.  "But it's top-secret so I can't talk about it.  ...but it's with SHIELD."
"I deserved everything I got in there. I brought it entirely on myself and I take full responsibility for it," Steve said calmly, hyperly aware that that beeping sound was his heart rate. And if he got stressed or nervous his heart rate would make it glaringly obvious. "I guess I just called HYDRA because I... could?"
Donner?" sneered Gideon impatiently.
"Ugh," said Tony, who had not gotten gifts for anyone yet and was hoping Pepper would step up to the plate for him.
?"  He scoffed.  "Yeah, right."
It seemed unfair how thoroughly Tony had altered his lifestyle, and here Steve was, dangling the "let me make my own choices" card over his head.
Tony walked out of the bedroom, tie slung over his shoulders.  DeSoto hurried over and began tying it for him with a look of intense concentration.  Despite all his faults, one thing was for sure: he was a hell of a lot better at ties than either Steve or Tony was.
"If you want me to treat him, then you then let them put him in a bed," Kate stated, tone unwavering as she stared into Tony's face.  It looked oddly small in the helmet; the faceplate was off and it was strange to see the bruised human face behind the Iron Man. "Get out of that god-awful tin box and put it somewhere safe and then you get your face fixed up. I can't treat him in your arms, and right now he's looking a little worse for wear."
Tony was woken by the smell of bacon and eggs in a pan. Steve had a radio station on in the background, playing softly, one with alternative folk music that eased a person into the day.  Clint had recommended it to him; apparently radio came from satellites nowadays. He cooked with well practiced ease, quite contently lost in his own world as he fried mushrooms and tomatoes, adding them to the plates. He ate his own food in less five minutes (embarrassingly) and then made a tray up for Tony with the food and a cup of coffee. Steve had slept on the couch that night, not wanting to intrude upon Tony's space.
"Yes. Of course. She's probably the best person from my past, I mean... she changed the way I saw the world. And she still means a lot to me, you know?" He could sense Tony's nerves and squeezed his hand gently. "She spoke about you, when I met her before...and she asks about you when she calls. She'll be glad to see you," he said, making it sound like a promise.
