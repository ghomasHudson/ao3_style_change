He sees when Tony realizes the exact moment that he clued on to the fact that something was wrong because Tony tries to pull a face to show exactly how unhappy he is with Clint but it fails. All it does is fall flat and show how miserable he looks.
They let their phones ring until it stopped, and then Steve finally picked up his phone, opening his text messages.
Instead, it sounded like she was almost encouraging him to get back at that prick that drugged Tony.
Until one day Steve doesn't pitch. It's unlike him not to pitch at one of their planned outings, especially when they'd rescheduled this particular outing at least three times due to their conflicting schedules.
"Tones, it doesn't matter. We're not saying anything about your relationship with Steve. We just want to know if you're sure about this. What if the guy is just after your money? We know there's the possibility that he isn't, " Rhodey tries to placate, "but there's also the possibility that he is. Look at all the other times someone wanted you for your money."
Natasha sounds oddly amused, and all too knowing when she replies. "Alright, don't kill anyone," she says, sounding downright cheerful.
"Maybe I felt sorry for you and that's why I decided to do a favor for everyone else who had to listen to your pick-up lines," Steve teased.
He did, however, look up when he heard someone call Steve's name. He turned to look and when he did, he saw a pretty blonde standing in front of the table.
Just the other day he and Steve had been alone in the elevator on the way to the boardroom where the rest of the team were waiting to start a meeting and they hadn't shared a single word between them.
= Tony! I haven't seen you in so long? Are you so busy that you don't have time to visit me anymore?
Steve nods jerkily and he can tell that Steve is probably deciding on whether or not it was safe to stay down here with him or if he should just go to bed.
When Steve glances at the alarm clock he's not surprised to find that it's still early. He's been trying to go back to sleep for more than an hour and has completely given up on sleep, feeling too antsy and like he was too small for his skin.
Not that it was a secret, of course. Tony had told him numerous times before that he was warm and comfortable.
Neither of them said anything and he couldn't help but wish that he'd find the courage to say something, anything to Steve.
He hoped for his sake that neither Pepper and Rhodey nor Steve would ever find out about his little obsession with possessiveness.
Although he had no doubt that Doctor Mikhailov would say the same thing whenever she popped in for a check-up, just using better terms.
They hadn't even sat down for ten minutes when a waitress asked them for their orders, giving each of them a bright smile and didn't even blink twice when she realised who they were.
He sighed, opening his eyes and sitting upright so that he was leaning against the headboard instead.
Tony is now playing with the iron man plaster that Bruce had given him to stick over his arm and is smiling dopily.
"Okay, I know this isn't exactly what you want, but it's better than the alternative, which would be us packing a bag for our daughter at the end of each week so that that other gets to keep her when it's their chance. And there's also the fact that Pepper already had people see things up in the penthouse. Do you want to move everything to your floor? Because then we need to order duplicates of everything so when she stays with either of us she's comfortable. And if it's not that what's bothering you and simply the fact that staying at the penthouse with me is what makes you
He doesn't know what drugs Tony was fed, and he'd feel better if Tony stayed awake until he got him safely back to Bruce at the tower.
"Sir, the lab will remain unlocked until you and Captain Rogers talk to one another," the A.I. tells him, sounding extremely self-assured and more than a little smug.
The thought is enough to spur him on and he gulps down the last few mouthfuls of coffee, hissing as it burns his tongue, and he rushes to grab his cellphone and heads to the penthouse elevator.
Tony must’ve picked up on it too because if possible, he hunches over even more and pointedly avoids his eyes when answering him.
And that's more or less when they realize that they have to tell their friends, and by extension, the rest of the world.
Just as things were beginning to get interesting (right when Tony felt as if he was ready to take Steve with him and stow him away in his room in the penthouse for an entire week), Tony heard an embarrassed cough behind them.
The nurse adjusts Steve's grip on the baby, and then leaves with a smile, moving further into the room to give them a semblance of privacy.
He feels more than sees how Steve's body goes slightly rigid before he pulls away from him, blue eyes roaming worriedly over his form. Most likely checking for any injuries or signs that he might have hurt himself while down in the lab. He feels a flare of irritation rise up inside of him and he has to tamp down on it hard to keep from snapping at Steve to leave him alone.
He nodded at the receptionist, and when she sent him a beaming smile and a nod in return he was off. He headed down the hallway leading to the maternity ward, passing a couple of rooms until he reached Steve's private room, and then he knocked, waiting a couple of seconds before sticking his head in.
Wait, scratch that, who the hell even sang about their heartache? He certainly never wanted to write a song about how he was feeling, much less about how he hurt Steve.
He could've gotten married to Peggy, maybe have had a house with a white picket fence. Maybe had a child with her and a pet.
The silence stretched between them, and for a while, neither of them made any move to say anything or to ask any more awkward questions.
He thinks he's done a good job of ignoring Tony so far but the man has to ruin it for him, stepping into his space and grimacing at his hands.
If anything, his voice didn't relay any of what he was feeling and it was hard to get a read on Steve.
He recalls Steve carrying him last night in his arms like he was some sort of invalid and groans, putting his head in his hands. Steve was so warm and had smelt so nice. And he was really good at cuddling, not that he would ever be caught saying that, of course.
"Coming right up," Steve said, "You're amazing, you know that?" he said, referring to Tony's thoughtfulness. He grabbed the pot and poured himself a mug of coffee before grabbing the ingredients needed for their breakfast. Then he focused his attention on Tony, pulling him closer with one hand and dipping his head so that their lips met in a chaste kiss.
Which meant that the A.I. anticipated that something was either about to go wrong, and that one or the other were about to go in for the kill (it used to be said teasingly, before, but now it sounded as if they really were going to kill one another) or that they were going to wreak havoc.
And if a few tears fell when he kissed Tony and pulled him closer to his body in thanks, well, that was between them.
"We're all done here. I'd like to keep him here overnight, just for peace of mind," Bruce is quick to add, "JARVIS can monitor him better from here and should anything happen can notify me immediately. You can go to bed, Steve. I'm sure he'll be fine and you look like you need the sleep."
Bruce nods. "I think I'll be able to see, yes. And if I do happen to miss anything then we've got JARVIS to help and pick up on it. Although, judging by what you've told me, it seems as though this is just your standard run of the mill drug. Not bad enough to have any bad lingering effects on him, but I have a hunch that it was mixed with a few other drugs as well. Tony's actually really lucky. From what I've seen, this is the tamest effects that someone who's been drugged have ever experienced."
"It's nothing special, Stark," two can play at that game. Tony wanted to pretend that everything was fine and whatever they had before didn't exist, he could do it too. "Anyone from the team would've done the same. We care about one another. We work together and have to have each other's backs. That's what being part of a team is about."
And for Tony, just seeing Steve genuinely happy at the news that he gets to visit his daughter and to hold her is enough to make him smile.
Except, Tony's looking at him in confusion, head cocked to one side and eyebrows furrowed. He can already feel his heart sink right down to his feet at the sight. Tonight was just not going to plan.
The smell of strong coffee permeating the air is enough to lead him to the kitchen where FRIDAY had already started the machine for him.
Except, Natasha was extremely straightforward about these things and doesn't hesitate to show her displeasure or annoyance or anger. So he doesn't think this was the case. Maybe she was just annoyed with him for not trying to fix the whole thing with Tony. It's always hard to tell with her.
And if he benefited from the close contact as well, if the familiar smell of Steve and the heat that radiated from Steve's body was a balm that soothed him like no other, he wasn't about to deny himself that little pleasure.
good-looking man in the world. Just ask Rolling Stones. He was voted hottest man three years in a row.
He takes the small pile of clothing from Steve's hands and packs it away in the open drawer, making sure that everything was packed away neatly before closing it.
Tony's eyes widened before he glared, nostrils flaring in anger. If Steve was trying to rile him up, to anger him, then he was doing one hell of a job.
"Lay it on me. Can't be worse than last year. I'm pretty sure he sent me a couple of Valentine's Day messages while he was drunk," Steve said, knife poised in the air as he thought back to the year before.
"Steve, how was he when you first found him? Any speech impairments? You said that he told you he was feeling dizzy and that his head hurt," Bruce asks him and he nods.
They spend the day together at the tower, watching movies and ordering in. After, well, it certainly wasn't planned, not that Tony was going to go complaining about it.
Steve hadn't looked up yet and he cleared his throat, letting loose a chuckle of amusement when Steve's head whips up and his eyes widen at the sight of him.
The wheelchair was lying abandoned near the doorway, waiting for when Steve had to return to his room.
Steve packs the book back into the gift bag and puts it on the bedside table along with the box of chocolates. The dress he folds neatly.
In the background, fucking George Michael was still singing his woes away and, in a fit of frustration and disappointment, he threw a spanner in the air, hitting the wall opposite his workbench.
He's managed it before, the seven months after their break-up was proof of that. And now that he's suddenly found himself a new parent, his independence was shot to hell. He couldn't allow it to go on any further. Sooner or later the other shoe will drop and Tony will realize that Steve was just another burden that he needed to carry.
"Hi, Tasha. What do you know about a certain Tiberius Stone?  The CEO of Viastone." If his ma were still alive she would have flicked his ear and glared at him as he asked the question. She always hated people that were impolite, and believed that you had to always be polite to a woman. Seeing as it was the twenty-first century and all, he knew that people thought a whole lot more differently, and if he tried to treat Natasha like he was brought up to, she would be less than pleased. So while he tried to treat her like he treated everyone else, habits were hard to break.
He's standing outside the doors of the bank with Rhodey trying to coax him inside (the man had even tried to bribe him with the promise of coffee and red velvet cake, not that he was going to admit to it working, of course) when someone bumps into him.
JARVIS really wouldn't let anything happen to Tony. He remembered something from a couple of months ago, when he'd first entered Tony's workshop.
"She's so tiny," Steve whispers, voice full of awe as he trails a gentle finger across her cheek. She leans into the touch and Tony sees the way Steve's eyes light up.
He wants to hide the bag in the far corner of the kitchen cabinet, somewhere where he can't find it.
He smiled, walking over to Steve to kiss him on the forehead. "Morning. I got a call from Pepper earlier. I have to catch a flight to Tokyo now and I'll be back in about a week's time. Maybe less if I'm good and get all the paperwork done and the deal goes through. Though we all know how much I hate paperwork, which means that I'll probably be there for the full week. Sorry if I woke you."
Steve wastes no time in opening the bag, making sure not to rip it. He brushes aside the tissue paper and pulls out the first thing he sees.
Tony glanced at Steve, smirking slightly. "They all knew about it?" he asked. Steve shook his head in agreement. "I told them, yes. And I got both Pepper and Rhodey's blessings. Somehow the others found out."
Tony picked up the letter and cleared his throat, getting ready to read the two rather heartfelt words he'd written on the paper. "Dear Cap," he read, "Fuck you," Tony's therapist blinked and resisted the urge to facepalm. She certainly wasn't expecting that. "Okay. We'll try the letter some other time," she said. Tony nodded happily. He reckoned he did well.
He still looked tired and there were circles under his eyes, making them look bruised. He supposed Steve would look tired for a while, he
No, JARVIS had sounded downright worried when he called the team down to the common room. And for an A.I. who had no emotions, he sure as hell sounded like a human then.
Tony's got a look in his eye that he immediately dislikes. Tony's not going to make this any easier on him.
"Ah, yes. Whoever knew that Natasha was a secret lover of romance films? Tell you what, how about we go out tonight for dinner? We could go out and then watch a movie when we get back. And if you want, we could stop on the way for dessert," Steve suggested. He hoped that Tony said yes, seeing that he had already made plans in his head. Ones that he was hoping would come to fruition and would help lift Tony's spirits a little.
No matter how guilty betraying Tony's trust in him made him feel, using Tony's own A.I. against him was the only way that they could get out of the bathroom, and he intended to use it.
Rhodey and Bucky glared at him, and Natasha, who was calmly painting her toenails crimson, stopped what she was doing and scowled.
"You know, you're such a fucking dick. Of the two of us, people actually thought I was the type to cheat. Guess they were wrong, and that even America's Golden Boy can't resist the temptation of someone flirting with him. How absolutely sinful. The public would be up in arms if they knew."
"You weren't in bed. Why?" Steve asks. His tone of voice isn't accusatory, more curious, and slightly confused. If the sight wasn't so endearing he thinks that he just might snap at Steve. But Steve looks cute when he's confused and instead of snapping at Steve like he wants to, he settles for something slightly bitter.
He feels around for any points of tenderness, gauging Tony's facial expressions and tries to move it slowly to check the range of motion.
When Tony had left for the gala, having to rush to the hall and find Tony boxed in the men's bathroom drugged up to his gills with who-knows what was the farthest thought from his mind at the time; all that he had planned for the evening was to paint a bit, and take a warm shower before climbing into bed and settling in for the night with a book.
In which a few more tears are shed, there are emotionally stunted conversations, and Steve and Tony finally get to hold their daughter. Oh, and there might be a name.
Tony is more than happy to stand and watch Steve and his daughter. There's a warm, unfamiliar feeling spreading throughout his body, but he's not worried about it. Instead, he basks in the feeling.
that? I would never - I wouldn't hurt our daughter. Ever," Steve sounded so sure, so horrified of the prospect of doing something to intentionally hurt their daughter, that Tony couldn't help but pull him a little closer.
"Do I have to? Pepper is going to kill me for this!" Tony asked, pouting slightly. Steve chuckled, tugging on Tony's arm until he was close.
So Tony tried. He really did. He tried to get over Steve but how do you get over someone you still love? He even tried to forgive Bucky for killing his parents but nothing worked. He tried to be a good father to Peter but it was difficult without Steve there to tell him how well he was doing when he was feeling low about himself and panicking about being like his own father who didn't even care about him.
It's not that difficult to join the conversation and soon he finds himself laughing both at Sam's dry humor and Natasha's quick wit. He notices that they're purposefully poking fun at one another in an attempt to make him laugh and speak more, which he does, and chooses not to say anything at their lack of subtlety.
Tony wasn't his, was never his to start with, and these thoughts that were swirling around his head needed to stop or he was going to lose his mind.
"Really, Nat? Way to make a guy feel wanted," he allows his tone to come off as teasing, instead of the annoyed tone he wants to convey, and he watches as it reaches its desired effect.
Tony's vision blurred and he sobbed. "I just- I miss you, Steve. I can't keep on going on like everybody wants me to," Tony sobbed. "Tony, put Rhodey on the phone. Or Peter," Steve ordered and Tony shook his head even though Steve couldn't see him.
Tony couldn't fault him for it, though.  The thing was, they hadn't even spoken about living arrangements. Yes, he had promised Steve that he would be there for their daughter. He can't imagine being one of those parents that ignore the mere existence of their children. And if he's being honest with himself, he can't imagine being the type of parent that Howard was to him.
When he opened his eyes, he made contact with Rhodey, who looked just as unimpressed and incredulous as he himself was feeling before opening his mouth just to say: "Well, I'm not touching that one with a ten-foot pole. They can sort this one out themselves."
He doesn't spare any more time thinking about the what ifs and instead focuses on Tony. Tony who was extremely confused and terrified and under the effects of whatever drugs had been slipped into his drink, suffering from a brief bout of delirium and hallucinations. Tony who as soon as this was over would lock himself into his lab and wouldn't leave until this blew over and everyone forgot about it.
He watched as she blinked slowly at him, each blink getting heavier and heavier and he knew then that he'd do anything for her.
Tony looked at her in confusion. "I want you to write a letter," she said and Tony blinked. "A letter?" he asked in disbelief. He didn't know how writing a letter would help him get over Steve.
He doesn't say anything, eyes roaming along Tony's body until he reaches his eyes, searching for some sort of clue that Tony's joking.
So he does what he does best. Talk until people are forced to listen to him and they eventually stop talking themselves.
It was a wonder that Tony was even standing when he came down to the lab earlier to tell him about supper.
"No! I'm not mad at you, okay? I promise I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at the people who did this to you, Tony."
"You're so warm. And - and comfortable. I don't want to move. Can I lie on you? Then I can fall asleep," Tony whispered, almost as if he were telling Steve a secret.
"Which I will not be sharing with the class," Steve echoed, watching as Tony rolled his eyes and sighed.
He checks on Steve and finds that the blond is still sleeping peacefully. He moves quietly out of the plastic chair, wincing when his back and neck spasms slightly from the awkward position he'd slept in during the night. He really was getting too old to fall asleep just about anywhere.
"JARVIS, send Rhodey and Pepper a voice message. Tell them I say enjoy the holidays, and send your family my greetings. Tell them to - tell them to stay longer, god knows they need a vacation."
He gently pulls Tony towards him and is surprised at how easy Tony falls against his side, trusting. When Tony puts a hand around his forearm and rests his head on his shoulder, he has to tell himself that this is not real, and that it's not right. Because Tony is still mad at him, he's still mad at Tony and this is all not real because someone drugged Tony. He just needed help, and called the first person he knew.
Some days he's overcome with a bone-deep tiredness that he knows is from his own sadness and he allows himself to feel it, because he knows that it will disappear eventually. As suddenly as it had crept up on him it's quick to go away and he's able to go on with his day once more.
His mind was plagued with thoughts of what his life could be like if he wasn't forced to crash the plane into the Arctic.
Tony dresses quickly, running a hand through his wet hair and winces when he realizes that his hair will dry in its natural curls, simply because he was too lazy to brush it out properly. Which, since he had forgone getting a haircut two weeks ago, was going to be even more of a nightmare. But he doesn't care about that; he's rushing to get back to the medical floor so that he can be there when Steve wakes up.
And while Ty was the one to put whatever drug he had chosen in Tony's drink, he was sure that Ty wasn't the only one in this. From what little Tony had told him of Ty, it didn't sound as if he could pull something like this off without the help of someone else. Someone else who had a grudge against Tony.
"Good morning. You're up early today," Steve greeted. He was surprised to find Tony up at this hour. Usually the brunet was still asleep whenever he came back from his run and would usually wake when he was finished with his shower and in the middle of making a pot of coffee.
"You don't need to make excuses, Tony. Talk to me, sweetheart," Steve says, squeezing to grab his attention.
He's surprised, as anyone else would be. After all, Rhodey hardly got leave from training, and if he did, it was only for a day, not an entire week.
"No - no, I know that he's out there. He's -" Tony hiccuped, "He's out there, waiting for me to come out. Steve, tell him to go away!" Tony said hysterically.
She nods and takes a bite of the half of the bagel with the strawberry jam on it and makes her way to the lounge.
"I don't know… that's a really good one. Remember the sentient toaster? You were bordering on manic by the time I found you and muttering about increasing the speed of a slinky. Those were two things I never thought I'd see, much less hear. But then the toaster made toast by itself and all but blew up in Thor's face when he tried to put a pop tart in, so all in all, not the
In the back of his mind, Tony felt guilty, and then he realized that Dum-E was only a robot and he had more pressing things to deal with.
Nevertheless, he stays silent and doesn't bother answering Tony's look of confusion, taking the mission brief from his hands instead.
"Mi comare" comes from the Italian comare, which means godmother or second mother. In other words, someone who takes care of you.
"Hey, Fri, get ready to add some input on the blueprints for the new StarkPhone. It needs to be checked, although I know everything is correct because I'm a genius, but I also know that Pepper will take great joy in threatening me with those killer heels of hers if I don't check it before I send it off to R&D," he said, pulling up a hologram in front of him and sitting down.
He turns around and is ready to defend Tony should the need arise when he sees just who is standing by his car.
"How's our resident genius doing?" she asks, worry shining in her green eyes. She rubs a hand against Tony's face before scratching at his scalp with her fingernails. She stops when Tony's nose scrunches up and he tucks his face into Steve's chest. She raises an eyebrow and steps back once more, a smirk on her face.
It's pathetic how he's relating to someone who's dead. He hated that he's even sitting here in his lab, drinking stale coffee (why the hell was he sober for this?) and listening to this stupid song in the first place. And really, it's not as if he was the one who 'gave' his love away to anyone.
The tweet was already waiting to be sent, one simple line that would have a major impact on their lives from now on:
She turns to look at him, and, if he looked long and hard enough, he's able to see the worry on her face, but, since Natasha is extremely good at what she does and he doesn't want to spend forever trying to understand what it is exactly that she's thinking (the effort is wasted, as soon as he thinks he knows what she's thinking she proves him wrong), he can only make out the slight furrow in her perfectly sculpted eyebrows.
Rhodey had then told her and they'd agreed that in Tony-speak, it was very much a date, and in his head he saw it as that.
The room is dark when Tony wakes up, and he's extremely glad for the blinds that block out the light of day. He's pretty sure that it's early morning, but with the lack of light, it's hard to distinguish exactly what time it is.
"Do you want me to go check if I can find Doctor Mikhailov? I can ask her if you're allowed to see the baby," he said.
An emotion that he got really tired of seeing on his friend's faces when they thought he wasn't looking. Although, in the beginning, right after he and Tony broke up they hadn't even bothered to disguise their worry and concern. Now they were slightly more subtle about it, but he was getting better and better at identifying it for what it was; them looking out for a friend.
"You are indeed correct, Sir. In France we like to say a simple congratulations and give our blessings to the newly engaged couple. What I said was that I hope you will make each other extremely happy."
He was mad at Tony, but he couldn't find it in himself to be mad at Tony when he was like this. When he was stuck in this situation. Especially because he wasn't firing on all senses.
Its a deserted beach, daylight hours.  A small cove, white sand.  Steve alone, walks along the shore, closing his eyes and feeling the warmth of the sun.  he picks up a stone and tosses it into the water.  He feels the breeze and smiles.  He sits on the beach, clenching and unclenching his toes in the sand.  He removes his glasses, looks at them for a moment and drops them on the sand.  Looks up and watches the sea and the skies.
Steve looks down at his clothes, a tad self-conscious.  “Don’t take that wrong.  It’s refreshing, I mean look around” Tony gestures to the crowd, “people try so hard to look how they think they should look” the clientele does look like they’re trying too hard, “looks that they probably saw in some movie.”
Holding a quarter in her hand, “Oh.  Do you want to…?”  Steve looks at the game.  The racing game depicts a red car thundering along a highway.  The vehicle spins out of control in a shower dust.  Steve stares at that for a moment, it disturbs him.  Then he answers, “Uh no… thank you… sorry it’s not you.  I’m sort of…” he gestures around “Just want to get my Barings.”  Natasha responds, “Uh Okay.  See you around.”  She smiles.  Steve wonders off, Natasha watches him leave, the she drops a quarter in Bubble Bobble.
“When I arrived back on Earth, you were considered a deserter.  The American public was divided.  You were hated by the government and the public, the Alt-right used your image to fight for smaller government.  You were either hated or praised by hate groups.  Tony hated seeing your image like that.  He hurt seeing the world hate you after you have fought to protect them.  So, he came up with a plan.  A plan to make the United State need you once more, even if it meant that he would be hated.  He became aggressive as a leader.  Eventually Rhodey and Pepper left because of it.  Peter stayed loyal to Tony.  Tony cared for Peter and he didn’t want the kid to fall with him, so he made Peter hate him as well.  After the team disbanded, he then began terrorizing the country.  When he finally took over the country, resistance movements appeared.  The public began using your image as a sign for change, for peace, and as hatred towards Tony.”  Carol got closer to Steve.   “He set up a plan to get you and the rogue avengers to come back to defeat him.  And when I say defeat, I mean he wanted you to kill him.”
Lights turn on in the room. The models stand on the platform. Tyra stands in front of the judges facing the contestants. She holds an envelope which has Top Model printed on it.
*Wanda voice over as she hugs everyone goodbye: “I am shocked that I am going home, because I feel like I did bring a lot of energy to my pictures.” Photo tribute of Wanda’s photo appears. “I know I’m not just a pretty face, cuz I was never the pretty girl in school. I know my stuff and it’s just I didn’t get a chance to prove it, and I didn’t get a chance to werk it. I’m going to make it on my own.” Wanda is shown waving goodbye as she leaves the judging room.
Meanwhile, elsewhere, Tony is leaving a house-- a kind of clapboard beach house-- and walking towards his car, a red jeep.
Steve’s eyes were wide open, taking in all the new formation.  He closes his fist with the dog tags inside.
On the balcony outside of Tony's bedroom.  The clock reads 11:55p.m.  The décor in Tony's room is slightly different, 2002 style.  There's a poster for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics on the wall.  The bed is in disarray.
“What are you talking about!?” Steve yells.  “He became a ruthless ruler, he killed almost all of congress, and he took over various countries!  How is that out of love?  TELL ME!”
Steve, exactly the same age, but dressed subtly differently, his styling befitting the year 1980, strides past the store with the TV in the window.  Which is showing a scene from the "
Picture appears of Peter ripping the shirt open to reveal a hero costume underneath. Phil: “I love your idea if having you reveal the costume.”
While everyone is enjoying themselves Nick and Phil walk out with envelopes in their hands. They look serious.
“Carol Danvers, I used to work with Tony.”  She walks forward and leans against the wall.  “I brought you here because I need to talk to you about Tony.”
Steve doesn't allow the blank look that has now taken over Tony's face to make him feel guilty. He thinks he's done enough of feeling guilty to last a lifetime and isn't this the point?
He watched Steve's face carefully as he spoke, noting the way the blond furrowed his eyebrows as he got closer and closer to blurting out 'move in with me?' and the way a deep frown started to form.
He'd barely walked five steps when he saw her walking down the hallway, apparently already on her way to Steve's room.
Tony gives their sleeping daughter one last look and then walks over to Steve, standing behind the chair.
"Of course you will, Sir. Check should be done in five," she said and he sobered up, fingers moving quickly across six different holograms all at once.
What was unusual was that they were arguing at the asscrack of dawn. And the fact that they were arguing at all right now.
"So, I phoned Pepper last night and she had some people drop off a couple of baby supplies at the penthouse. Knowing Pepper, she probably had them assemble the crib and everything else that had to be built. She also might've had a few people clear out one of the spare rooms and turn it into a nursery. I know we didn't talk about it, but you know Pepper, she has good intentions. So, what do you say? Move in with me? Well, I mean, there's the guest bedroom, so not really in with me
The whole touching thing. The close contact. He never realized how much he missed being warm. Or the fact that he was cold for so long that being warm was strange for him. Steve was warm.
The silence wasn't awkward, wasn't even tense because Steve didn't even make an effort to say anything to him, just gave him a tiny smile and pulled out his phone, shooting off a text to someone before pocketing the device once again.
"Tony, please. Bruce is waiting for us at the tower. He has something he wants to share with you. You like spending time with Bruce, don't you?" he asks.
"Steve," Tony says extremely seriously, head righting itself, "you've said that already. At least five times, if I'm not mistaken. Why are you repeating yourself?" he asks, sounding slightly confused and amused all together. It's a weird combination and yet, that's all that he can think of when he looks at Tony at this moment.
"Steve! Steve, he's in here. No! Ty, I don't want you to touch me! Leave me alone! Stop it!" Tony shrieked, edging back until he was against the wall near the mirror, eyes moving around the room wildly and hand held up in the air as if he had his repulsors on. That action must've been his fight or flight instincts kicking into high gear as the adrenaline courses through his veins.
Friends go out together. And he and Steve have long ago passed the 'strangers who keep on running into each other stage' and ventured into the 'friends who sometimes go out together for coffee' stage.
And, after nearly two years of them being together - they had celebrated their first anniversary more than five months ago - he liked to think that he knew Tony well enough by now.
"You should've seen your face! Priceless! Okay, fine. What happens if I agree to this dinner of yours? Are you going to stop stalking me?" Steve asks seriously.
He and Pepper actually got on really well, despite the situation that they found themselves in. They had a shared like for all things art and had even gone to the Metropolitan Museum of Art together, with Tony insisting that he tag along. Pepper had simply raised an eyebrow at Tony before whispering in his ear that the closest Tony had come into contact with any art was whenever she bought him pieces for a collection before it went into underground storage never to be seen.
I was originally going to break this chapter up because it seemed too long, but then I scrapped the idea.
His blood pressure rises significantly higher than what it had been earlier on when Tony had explained to him what had happened and it's only when he thinks of Tony who is sitting in the passenger seat of his car that he keeps himself calm.
When they finally sleep together (shocker! It only happens after date number six. If the rest of the world knew that Tony Stark hadn't just bedded someone without all the dating in between they'd die of shock) there's nothing special leading up to it.
Which was a massive problem for him right now, especially since he needed to get Tony to Bruce as soon as possible. He didn't like the effects that whatever was used to drug Tony had on him.
"Sure thing, Boss man. Are you sure the reason that you need my help to check everything isn't just because you're getting slow in your old age?" she teased him and he glared at the nearest camera.
He puts his hand on Steve's shoulder and leans down to look at her properly. "She's ours," he says, and Steve nods. "Yeah, she is."
Steve didn't sound too happy about it, but his tone wasn't angry or bitter, so Tony counted it as Steve being in agreement. Really, Steve never gave up so easily, so if he was doing it now, it must mean that he agreed with Tony's logic.
"Thanks, Cap. I won't be able to help much since I'll be at SI when you guys are on the mission, but FRIDAY will be able to should you need it. Just ask her for anything. I'll be back in time for a debriefing," Tony says.
His sketchbook was closed hastily and put to one side and he stood up as if in a trance and walked away, heading back to his and Tony's floor to change into clothing that was more suitable for the gym.
"You - What? You're not supposed to talk to the person who pays your salary like this! Blasphemy! I will not stand for it," he whined.
"I'm not asking you, Tony, I'm telling you. And right now I'm not liking the way your ankle is swollen. Maybe if you'd told me about your ankle earlier then we could've forgone going to medical, but you didn't and now your ankle has swelled even more. I won't ask anyone else to help you, because I know you and you hate medical," he says as he grabs hold of Tony's waist and slowly lifts them up.
Didn't mean his hands weren't twitching or his eyes didn't glance over to the empty bar area a few times.
Steve's sick for almost two weeks, and then when two weeks are over he's as right as rain; cheery and laughing and sassing Tony left, right and center.
"Pepper, just go before he wakes up and you scare him away. We'll talk later, okay? After I've woken up properly and had a good breakfast. And no, I won't be in to SI today. Steve and I have plans," he says as he turns his back to her and carries on with his task.
Tony felt a surge of panic take hold of him, but he managed to suppress it enough to urge Steve to hand her over.
He pulls his hands our of Tony's grip and steps back, not looking Tony in the eye and gathers his things.
"Stark! Listen to me, we're not going outside, I promise. What happened?" he asked, feeling a lump at the back of his throat. He felt guilty because he wasn't there when this had happened. Maybe if he was with Tony then this wouldn't have happened. He wouldn't have gotten the phone call from Tony and Tony would've been safe and very much not high.
Clint was the next to join. And then the remainder of the team filed out of the common room, each heading to their respective floors before passing out.
Not even a second later he hears the ding of the elevator as the doors open and Pepper steps inside.
He steps around Stone's pathetic form that is hunched over, clutching at his bleeding nose and gets into the car, shutting the door behind him and smiles down at Tony's sleeping form.
Truth be told, he never really thought past that, which, in hindsight, was an issue on his behalf. Really, he was just so surprised and caught in the moment when Steve was in the throes of labor that when everything was finally over, he was still reeling from it. And then after, when he called Pepper, the whole thing with the living arrangements hadn't even been on his mind.
So he shrugs it off and tells JARVIS to remind Tony that they'll be having supper with the rest of the team and watching a movie later. JARVIS assures him that the message would be relayed and he made his way down to his art studio to work off a little more of the adrenaline that was still coursing its way through his body. Unfortunately for him, the fight with Doom and his bots were of no challenge and was easily defeated, which meant that he didn't have an outlet for all of his energy. Painting helped relieve some of whatever pent up emotions or leftover adrenaline he had and it seemed like the best bet.
Except, Steve didn't really want him like that, did he? Steve had just wanted him for a roll around in the hay, and he had gladly given it to him. But… he had done the same to Steve. Hadn't he? He'd used Steve, and he couldn't be upset about Steve returning the favour.
"He's done neither because I've done nothing to antagonize him," Loki responded, rising smoothly.  "If you both will excuse me, I have places to be."
For a long moment Clint remained sitting perfectly still, hands crossed on the table in front of him before standing hard enough to send his chair over backwards and stomping for the door.
"I didn't dismiss you—" Fury started and let it go when Clint flipped him off and slammed the door on his way out. "—But I guess you already knew that."
Loki's lip curled up in a sneer, "He's a fool if he thinks that the person he misses is still here."
"I mean what did he do?" His eyes were locked on Tony's as much as possible considering the other's sunglasses he was still wearing, "I have no idea what Pepper and Rhodey were talking about."  But he had suspicions.
Natasha unfolded from where she had pulled one leg up to rest her forearm across it, "Well, you all heard the man, let's open gifts."
"Oh good," Tony said but his voice was distracted as Steve’s breath brushed the skin of his neck, and then his jaw.
“Alright, I’m confused,” Tony admitted, Samuel perched on top of his shoulders and purring. “Did you just say Nick Fury was coming to Christmas?”
He shook his head, hair starting to static against the pillow. “No. Mood. We are not talking about it right now.”
"What happened while I was gone?" Thor asked, looking over at her, tone firm and with only a hinted rumble in it.
Thor trailed after him, looking at the books as he passed, realizing he was picking books out for Loki in the back of his mind, seeing another he thought he might convince Sif to read before shaking his head and focusing on Bruce's back instead.
Bruce laughed, sliding the finished pancakes onto another plate and shutting off the stove before joining Clint, "Lots of teeth, but really fascinating biology when you get right down to it."
"All your attempts to the contrary," Rhodey snapped and Thor looked across the room with a frown, remembering Steve's snarled anger about Tony only fighting for himself when they first met.
"We were busy.  And distracted.  We got caught up in other things until Clint realized it was Christmas Eve. No idea why Jarvis let that go. Maybe he has a sense of humor."
Bruce shifted back from where he had heard most of the conversation, glancing over his shoulder at the hall briefly yet held his ground beyond the initial shift.  Natasha neither moved or gave an indication if she had known he was there or not.
He'd made his way almost through the entire store, finding a book about world travel and wonders for Thor, and a fancy dart board for Clint before stopping in despair in front of the kitchen supplies. "Steve likes food doesn't he?"
Victor hummed, looking around the room one more time to make sure he had not missed any technology or trinkets. At least the ones he didn’t mean to leave behind as a final “fuck you” to the Fantastic Four. "If you say so. You're still quite lucky you have such a charming reward to pay or I'd have no reason to offer my help. The invasion of New York was stunningly done, if cut off prematurely. It’s too bad your work since then has only been lackluster."
“You don’t sound pleased,” Loki said, and Thor felt his fingers tighten as he held his hands together.
Bruce let his hand rest next to Clint's hand. "I don't remember much, just that I woke up hurting and feel like throwing Logan through a few trees every time I see him."
“A few.” He paused, focusing his gaze on his plate, "Betty, I don't, I don't know if this is working."
“And then tomorrow I’ll introduce you to New Mexico,” Thor said and Loki’s eyes widened slightly in alarm. “It will be fun,” Thor added, as if he was talking about everything in the future.
For a long moment, Tony didn't reply and Clint's laugh was not kind. "Even you don't want to admit you were having drinks with Loki."
"If you have something to say you might as well," Tony replied, still fiddling with the phone, having brought up the floor plans as he tried to pick out floor tiles for Bruce's bedroom.
"Are..." He cut himself off, changing the question entirely, "How drunk are you both planning to get?"
"Thanks for the food," Clint murmured, not sure the other could even hear him anymore before he carefully picked the boxes up to return them to the small guest room he was calling his own.
“We are inviting people, on purpose,” Tony said. “I just usually think of people as like Pepper or—”
“You know, while I remember the fact I have historically fucked up on things like allergies and dates I think I’m actually a little insulted right now,” Tony huffed as Steve reached out, pulling him down on the bed beside him. “Steve you’re going to stain the sheets if I end up on
"I didn't tell Clint because I didn't want him to get too reckless. Doesn't mean I was happy about it," Natasha replied, looking up at him from her seat. There was half the room between them and Fury crossed his arms over his chest, looking at the ceiling for a moment.
"I try to avoid anything that might end in scars, even for the sake of your amusement, Stark," the other drawled.
Bruce nodded, "Massive, but pretty docile.  Dangerous for sheer size and the fact that it's still a wild animal."
"It is a holiday to spend with family in this realm," Thor said, waving the hand not on Jane's waist around the lights and snow. "That will always hurt."
"Well first he approached the kitten, lifted the little guy’s paw, and then seemed to stop and pick the whole thing up and then he was like a kid in a candy store excited," Tony said. "I'm thinking there's a story there and I'd like to hear it."
"Can I have another hour to mope and cry before I have to answer that?" he asked, looking over and his eyes slid all the way to the door and he froze. "Or—or I suppose I could do it now."
Natasha pursed her lips before rising from her chair, "I'll go write my report. You'll have it by tomorrow."
"Agent Phil Coulson," Tony said, voice sounding a little hollow. "You knew him a little, didn't you?"
Steve sighed and shook his head, "I disagree. I'm not sure what would make you think that, but hating you isn’t ever going to be better for me."
Bruce spoke from where he was leaning against the counter, his fingers curled around a mug of tea, "It might not do anything out of the ordinary."
"It's probably good that Tony's pretty well alienated the political population that would take offense to that already," Bruce said, focusing on his cooking rather than look at Clint again.
“Well fuck,” Tony said under his breath, looking at the crate of strawberries under his elbow. “Jarvis, quick. Is Steve allergic to strawberries?”
Bruce's smile was wide, "Exciting though.  It appears we need to duel for our meal any time we want to have fondue.  Which is too bad."
"Yeah but when the tabloids come by asking when Captain America and Iron Man are having a baby together it's always good to be able to have some crazy stories," Clint shrugged.
Tony's eyes widened and he jerked the chair back around because he couldn't remember where the nearest pair of sunglasses were and he knew his eyes showed all his lies. "Because you kissed me."
"Oh just wondering if Stark has any other super villains who destroy cities he likes to pal around with. Say, do you like Doom?" Clint said and Tony's eyes narrowed obviously, even under the sunglasses.
Steve let out a long breath, pressed against Tony even though Tony was still on top of the sheets. “The future has some incredible benefits.”
Fury laughed, but he didn't sound amused at all. It was a laugh of exhaustion. "You're probably right. Doesn't change my outlook though. I do things my way, you do it yours."
“Not by following your example,” Tony said and paused as a small child, with blue and green spikes for hair looked up at him on the way out the door.
“I’m going to assume you’re saying you all in a human race sort of way rather than an Avengers sort of way,” Tony replied, arching a brow over toward him. “Are you going to eat that olive?”
“Well, carry on then,” Tony said, as Thor came down the stairs, whistling what sounded like oh come all ye faithful. Clint and Tony both watched him walk past.
"We're going to have to get you grown up food," Clint told the kitten, grinning as he looked up and mewed at him as he dropped the food into his dish. Tony had taken one look at the dish on the counter, shrieked for fifteen minutes and then built a better food and water system that included a small waterfall, and Clint suspected a force field to make sure all food remained inside the dishes and never, ever on the counter.
"Thanks for the support," he said, shaking his head as Rhodey frowned at him before looking back at the model plane, focusing on that instead of strangling his friend. Tony's comment earned a long look from Natasha, but she didn't say anything at the moment, the kitten trailing after her and twining around her ankles.
Clint ignored him. "Samuel, huh? Do you like that one?" he asked, petting the kitten under the chin and grinning at the purr.
Tony let out a strangled sound of annoyance. “It was just one kiss under the mistletoe. It’s not like it meant anything so stop poking around in there.”
"Well, it's a hard act to follow—attempting to destroy one world and attempting to conquer another," Loki replied with a shrug.
Clint frowned, leaning further into the couch. "So how's the pack, I'm sorry, the students," Tony said instead.
Clint shrugged. "I don't know if he'd tell you if you asked. But he has a hole carved into his chest and it's not for decoration, you idiot." His nerves were feeling raw, from the lights and Christmas and the ties in the window and seeing the ornament of a father and son, and he knew he was taking it out on Steve but better Steve than himself.
"You'd be surprised by the night I had, for the love of god I was coming from upstairs," he said, slowing down.
It was just about two and a half hours after Natasha had left that footsteps were heard on the stairs and Jane entered, looking around. The entire main room was draped in lights and decorations, the tree having been so covered in ornaments and garlands that it was almost impossible to tell how scraggly it had been originally, "Oh my."
"You did say I was stuck with you," Tony said, feeling his shoulders relax at so thoroughly changing the topic.
Steve held up the glass he’d poured himself to indicate that it had in fact gone down, "Yeah, I'm drinking for all the good it does."
"So you're going to insist this is a big deal?" Tony asked and Clint's eyes narrowed, ready to shoot Tony for asking.
Bruce rose quickly, starting after him but stopping not sure if he should follow the other. Tony watched Clint stomping down the stairs and heading to the gym. Emerging on the roof, he looked over at Bruce. "Well, I was going to see how Clint was doing but now I think I might ask you instead."
"Bit of both," Bruce answered, his lips curling upward slightly again as he glanced at Clint.  "There's no way they were both aware of how the other would react to that, so the secretly gay lovers is probably out.  But secretly wanting the other?  That I believe."
Which lead to one day, when Bruce woke up after a code green to find Clint sitting next to him, one knee drawn up against his chest and his arms wrapped around it.
“Seriously?” Clint repeated. “How could you not have seen Star Wars, I mean, okay, some quotes I can see you knowing without seeing but—” They entered the elevator, and Jarvis cleared his throat.
She rested her arm on his shoulders, her fingers combing through his hair, "Personally I’m not sure what I think of such high level of probable surveillance."
She shrugged slightly, "Beyond liking to see you smile again tonight?  No, no ulterior motives.  It was good to see."
Pepper's lips quirked up at the clatter of Steve dropping the second frying pan he'd been pulling out of the cupboard he'd finally found it in. Bruce smiled, amused, "Sounds like you've said that before."
"Good," Tony said and dragged his teeth along the imprint of Steve's shoulder blade before turning his head. "Good."
"You still owe me a plane," Rhodey said, even though he was already looking at the packaging of the box, fully intending to try and fly it off Tony's reconstructed balcony after breakfast.
“I’m saying the Other Guy sure seems to be on a courtship binge,” Clint said. “I know he recognized Betty back—before—but this is way more proactive than just recognizing me.”
Steve trailed behind him, watching the other man quietly before drifting toward a display of posters.
"Traditionally I think you're supposed to open those," Bruce said, still looking amused by the chemistry set he finally set aside in order to pick up another package.
"We have had our whole lives to fit around each other," Thor said, not adding the snide comments between Fandral about Hogun's smile or Volstagg asking Fandral if he liked his face or Sif's cold wrath that was as like to earn a verbal attack as a physical one when she was pushed. "The Avengers are still figuring out where the jagged and hurt edges are."
“Star Trek’s a TV series, I’d say it’s too long at this point,” Bruce spoke, glancing at Tony.  “Are you weighing in on what we’re watching on your TV?”
"Oh the press will have a field day.  I do hope I can obtain copies of those headlines wherever I end up."
"Well, isn't friendship and companionship what this holiday's technically about?" Jane asked from where she had curled her legs up next to her.
"I'm not actually sure," Steve admitted, pushing back the blankets and starting to find his clothes.  "It wasn't happy, but I'm not sure how angry it was."
Bruce stopped a short distance from Clint, sliding his hands into his pockets and trying to keep himself calm, "Clint?"
"Sorry, that came out of nowhere, didn't it," he offered Thor a sheepish glance.  "I've just been curious.  It's obviously different than here, but what's it like?"
"Old misunderstanding," Steve answered, quietly, watching the way the new fondue set seemed to be considering the old one.
Tony blinked at him, pushing his glasses back up. "You do seem to like taking in strays, sir," Jarvis said and Tony scowled up at the ceiling.
She offered him a ghost of a smile, "We might try.  But we've never been much for communicating when we're apart.  We'll see each other at conferences, maybe get coffee if we're in the same city, but we won't keep in touch.  And, maybe that's okay."
“Well, maybe he’ll leave before it becomes a problem,” Steve said, already getting distracted by Tony’s mouth again, eyes drifting down.
Steve also looked at Clint, pouring his whisked eggs into a pan, "So we'll all live here. I guess I should know what you guys like in your omelets then?"
Clint just laughed, possibly hysterical. "Yeah, well," he said. "We worked together, you know. Nothing like secret ops missions through Europe and Central America to make people close." Not to mention all the nights in hotel rooms when it was too hot to move, or the other nights when there was plenty of movement, Phil running his hands up and down Clint's back as Clint kissed his collarbone.
And this, dear readers, is the chapter in which we discovered that VS's Clint muse is a complete film snob.  We have no explanation for this.  Meanwhile, Tony Stark is busy and doesn't have time for movies more than like once a year, fight me.
"Alright," he agreed, pushing himself to his feet and offering her a smile, one hand resting on her waist.
"Alright," Thor said. "There would surely be stores like this that would sell logs would they not? Or should we find a lumber yard?"
Steve ran a hand over his face and shook his head, "Son of a bitch. I suppose that's one sort of signal flare.  It didn't stop there, though did it? I'm beginning to think my original assessment of FUBAR doesn't begin to encompass this."
“Well, it’s natural when you’re kissed,” Tony said, except he still stared at Steve and his eyes had always been the most honest part of him.
"I was going to set him up in my floor tonight, if no one objects?"  Steve responded, glancing toward Clint to see if the other would prefer to have the kitten for the night.
Steve bit back his first question in the interests of good relations. Bruce glanced between them, sipping at his water again, "And here you told me you weren't even tipsy about fifteen minutes ago."
Skimming his hands over Steve's shoulders he found himself laughing because he couldn't quite get his arms wrapped all the way around. “You really are shaped like a Dorito.”
"Well, that his first name was Phil and not agent and he was sorta seeing a cellist," Tony replied, staring at the helmet in confusion.
"I think a lot of people want to throw Logan through a few trees," Clint shrugged. "He blew smoke into my face the first time we met and I hit him in the ass with a trick arrow. I can't tell if we get along or not."
"Yeah?" he asked, standing in front of his bow like he still wasn't sure about picking it up or not.
Loki smirked at that, "Agreed.  It would be interesting to hear exactly what you lot have decided should be kept of your old tales."
"Yeah," Tony said. "Both rich kids with a fondness for alcohol. Not that we were kids together. But, sometime, when I was going to MIT we crossed paths on break and we were both pretty sick of it—and drunk let's not forget that—and we made some stupid agreement not to lie to each other. And not be nice, either so much."
Natasha snorted, "Not that you did much to help that along," she said, not having to mention how trunicated Tony's file had been.
Tony flicked a hand at Charles, other hand holding both his fondue sets. “Whatever. I should send you something on purpose next time just to make your life hard.”
“After centuries together, and you think only a few years could break it?” Thor finally said, turning all the way around again. “You think I would cast you aside so quickly as that?”
"And give up the lab and grant and research?"  He shook his head, "I won't ask that of you.  What you're working on could change the world for the better so much, Betty.  I’m not worth that.  And the danger that would put you in is too much."
“You know things cannot go back to the way that they were,” Loki said after another moment of silence stretched out too long. “Not least because Odin—”
That earned a laugh, as Charles called a counter response, "And yet you've picked up a tower of strays yourself."
"As I said, it's flashy enough," Clint said, picking up another, more sedate one for Bruce and looking around for puzzles. "We can look for a frame, I think I remember a store nearby."
Charles stepped off the elevator, looking around and ignoring Tony's plotting of his demise, "Oh, this is nice.  Very modern, but nice."
Natasha rolled her eyes, "All we have to do is tell them that they get to stay together and they should go quietly."
"I'm sure there are stores where you could find things!" Thor said, happily. "What do you think people would like?"
"Look, I managed to get that arc reactor in me by myself," Tony pointed out and Thor was looking at him.
"Oh, fine.  I just sent Clint running because I tripped all over his current troubles," Bruce replied, still watching the city moving below.
"Not a lot of people get excited about books. Sure, they read them, but actually find them exciting?  That's not the most common thing."
"No, you asked about Stane, the arc reactor came later," Rhodey said, though his eyes flickered at the fact Steve knew that much now. "You knew Howard, right?"
Loki, his appearance distorted to look similar to the businessmen on the street, looked at the latest headlines and dates on the paper he had picked up. Stiffening on the roof Clint’s eyes finally found the businessman that caused the ache to swell. He had to be certain before firing.
"Because I don't know if I could have kept it.  And I, I never know what's going on when the Other Guy is in control.  To come out of that and find out that he hurt her or worse?"  Bruce shook his head, "I couldn't."
"What was it like growing up with him?  Or would you rather not talk about him?"  Bruce glanced at Thor, considering the other.
“Loki has escaped from his imprisonment in Asgard,” Thor replied and Clint’s expression shut down. “But he is lying low and I cannot track him until I rest.” He offered Clint and the rest a tired smile. “So I could partake in films. I am surprised to see everyone here already.”
Shifting his shoulders back, Clint didn't respond for a moment. "No, I couldn't have," he said finally. He'd gone to the apartment that he'd spent weeks in, when they had the rare moments tucked away without SHIELD or business, but it had hurt enough he'd grabbed only what he wanted and left, locking the door behind him. But he'd expected more time to let go.
Tony avoided meeting Steve's look. Steve ignored Rhodey and Pepper, his attention entirely on Tony something indistinguishable in his voice, "You were dying?"
"Bitch, bitch, bitch, Charles," Tony said, hitting the elevator open with one of his elbows. "Not to say it isn't disconcerting, but you could be dead you know."
"Yeah, I'll be fine. Betty will go on and have a normal life, I hope, and I will continue on my research and working with you."
"And he needed company," Tony finished. "The other one shouldn't get drunk and Blondie over there can't. Actually, I'd bet good money that Romanov would be hard to get drunk too."
As to Charles' legs, this story is based after the events of X-Men the Last Stand and due to the post-credits scene Charles is alive in a body that was not his own.  He carries a cane because the body was bedridden its entire life and he still has weakness along with occasionally debilitating migraines from the fact that the brain in his new body is not accustomed to his telepathic abilities.  (Erik is also de-aged, we claim Marvel Machinations to explain that at this point).  Charles has a broken moral compass and always has, he just used to fake it better when he wasn't walking around in someone else's body.
Tony leaned up to lick the first knob of Steve's spine. "So if we can't call each other gorgeous, what will our pillow talk be?"
Steve offered a wry smile at that, "Well, it's appreciated.  I think Natasha was ready to smother me if she ended up with another cold shower.  Thank you for your time."
Pepper blinked at the package, "You usually do.  I was expecting to go get my gift tomorrow."  She opened the package, withdrawing the sapphire earrings, her eyes widening, "Tony, these are wonderful."
Tony looked around, finally taking his sunglasses off but not looking at Steve. He shifted around the group until he was closer to the outside of it.
When a shape moved in the darkness of his room he held his hand out, Mjölnir springing instantly to his grip. “Who is there?” he demanded, because he had no bothered to turn the light on. Some nights the electric lights of Midgard bothered him and he preferred to stay in the semi-darkness. Surrounded by New York it was never truly dark.
And Tony can't help the curiosity that takes over; he walks over and stands beside the chair that Steve's sitting in.
Sorry for the long delay in my updating schedule, but I think we can all agree that my schedule has been totally scrapped and I now only update when I can. Which is not as often as I'd like, to be honest.
"So Clint was up bright and early this morning. Sent a whole bunch of messages. You know, the usual Valentine's Day ones. I swear, this man has a freaking arsenal of pick-up lines and puns for every occasion," Tony spoke for the first time in five minutes.
And secondly, I wasn't the one stringing you along. Is this not what you were planning on doing to me? Or did I get it wrong? Tell me, were you not the one who kissed me first, and then told me that nothing was going to come of it because you and Pepper were on a break? And then, not even two weeks later, you do it again. I'm sorry, did I imagine sleeping with you? Because I'm pretty sure the two of us messed around more than once. And Pepper, does she know about this? Does she know that I was nothing more than your little rebound fling?" Steve bit out harshly, each word sounding more and more bitter and hurtful as they fell out of his mouth.
He sleeps the entire day, only waking to eat the soup that Tony ordered in - Tony refused to try and make soup, no matter how much he cared for the blond he didn't want to make Steve sicker than he already was - and take his flu medication.
She was right, like she always was, not that he was willing to say it to her face, of course. But he was willing to bet his entire fortune on the fact that she knew just how right she was whenever she ended up warning him about something.
Steve couldn't help the smile that tugged at his lips. Tony had said yes. He'd said yes to marrying him and to building a life together. He was absolutely giddy at the thought of it.
As the window leading to the common room slid open, he was immediately drawn to the two figures sitting on the sofa in front of the flatscreen.
"I might, you know, for a price. Give me some time to think about it," Tony said, pretending to think.
The short blond was sitting right at the back of the coffee shop where it was probably quieter, body turned towards the window and his head bent over a book. It's only after watching him for a few seconds longer, that he recognizes the leather-bound book and that Steve seems to be drawing in it.
It was a Moroccan blend, one that Steve discovered while on a mission and had brought back home. They'd tried it and surprisingly, Tony liked it, and whenever the blend was coming to the last little bit, Tony had it imported.
"So am I, but I'm sure we'll be able to see each other again soon. And at least we're together. It won't be the same as last year's Valentine's Day but we can still celebrate," Steve said.
Bruce sighs, punching the bridge of his nose. He puts his glasses back on and looks over at Tony. When he sees that Tony's drifting off again, he shakes him awake.
As soon as his bare foot touches the floor he can't help but let out a shiver; it was freezing in the guest room.
Which, is it really all that important? Why go through all the effort to go to the bank when you can do it online?
He turns around and sighs when he sees DUM-E holding his cord in his claw, clearly caught in the act of trying to make a run from his charging station.
Tony keeps on rubbing soothing circles on Steve's back, allowing him to calm down slowly and at his own pace.
He laid in bed, eyes wide awake but body protesting loudly against its inability to sleep. He tried everything, from shutting his eyes tightly against the darkness of their bedroom to counting sheep to listening to the playlist that Tony had composed for him for nights like this when he couldn't sleep.
He knew that it was wrong, it being Christmas Eve and all, but he couldn't lay in bed any longer. His mind replaying his parents' death's in his head like some sort of broken film. Steve was dead to the world, exhaustion clear on his face even in his sleeping form. He knows he should be a good boyfriend and stay in bed, but being near Steve seemed too much for him at the moment. And the guilt at staying away from his slumbering boyfriend was practically eating him alive, but he soldiers on and shakes it off like he always does.
It's not like they jumped to that conclusion immediately, more that Steve had some sort of inkling as to what was going on with his own body. There was also the little fact that Steve wasn't entirely honest when he told Tony that he felt fine whenever he asked.
So he stays silent and lets Steve process things. Allows Steve to see that he really is staying. For good. Nothing, not even Steve's half-hearted attempts at pushing him away will make him stay away from his precious daughter and the bright future she holds the key to.
As soon as she was in his arms, it was like all the breath was knocked out of him. He was too afraid to breathe too loud or to hold her too close in case he accidentally hurt her.
Finally, I feel like I can breathe again! Ugh, I feel like the last I've updated was five years ago. So not cool. In regards to this fic, there isn't much plot, as it goes, but it is essential to the fic. Of course, because it's me, there's slight angst and negative thoughts, but it will get better, promise!
He and Tony weren't meant to be so friendly with one another, especially not since they were exes. Tony told him that they were essentially roommates. Of course, it wouldn't do to dodge one another and ignore the other's existence, but since they weren't together anymore, they didn't have to depend so heavily on one another.
When the brunet finally moved, it was sudden, and he pulled Steve impossibly closer to him, his hands finding their way into Steve's hair and his lips meeting Steve's in a chaste kiss.
"Wait, what? Oh, I get it. Must be a Valentine's Day special that they're doing or something. It's kinda cute. And I love candy hearts. Guess it's my lucky day after all," Tony said, staring at the candy heart that stated
Steve shook his head. "No, a nurse. Nurse… Hannah? Yeah, she was here. Although I think Doctor Mikhailov should be here soon."
The feeling, if he's describing it correctly, and if the alcohol that's burning its way down his throat is anything to go by, then he's feeling kind of empty. And numb.
When there's silence on the other end, he puts his phone away in his pocket with a sigh, only then realising that Natasha hadn't given him any information on Stone.
At dinnertime, he was silent, only speaking when spoken to. He listened to the others' stories, laughing whenever they said something funny. At least at this hour, unlike this morning when he went out on his run with Sam his actions weren't mechanical. They were real.
He'd done the reading, well, he got FRIDAY to read it out to him while in the shower, but it still counted as him doing research. Whatever Steve was feeling and going through was normal. All people who just gave birth felt this way, some had it worse than others. So yes, at least he could tell Steve this. That whatever he was going through was normal and was okay.
He knows he has absolutely no right, no right at all, to feel as hurt as the way that he's feeling right now. And maybe hurt isn't the way to describe the way he's feeling, although hurt is
He first noticed it when they finished their little street fight with Doom (he absolutely refused to call it a mission because to him, missions meant battling against their challenging enemies and blowing up their hideouts while staying hidden long enough to make it out and be on their way home on the Quinjet before their enemies even realized what hit them) and Tony had flown back to the tower without saying a word.
But then he was given a miracle, and he realized that he would do anything to keep her happy and would be more than willing to watch the world burn if something happened to her.
He shoots Rhodey a glare and pointedly looks at the entrance to the bank. Rhodey laughs some more and when it's clear that Tony won't budge, he sighs and throws his hands up. "Fine, I'm going, I'm going," he says and walks inside.
The landing platform on the roof helped him out of his suit and he couldn't help but shiver. After all, he was only in his flight suit with a pair of jeans thrown over for some form of decency.
"Eh, details." Tony waved a hand through the air. "Happy Valentine's day to us," Tony spoke softly, brown eyes glowing golden in the light of the candle between them.
"Hello, Sir. Captain Rogers is indeed correct. There is no one outside the bathroom and should anyone try to come into contact with you, I'll make sure they leave straight away. You're in safe hands, Sir," JARVIS' voice is oddly gentle for something that isn't living, and once again, he's reminded of just how clever Tony was to create something like JARVIS.
Sure, Steve looked downright nervous and Tony could just about make out the telltale signs of Steve's guilt when the young nurse - Nurse Hannah, Tony remembered her name - handed their tiny baby to Steve to hold.
"So do you. I seem to remember a few instances where you had absolutely no shame in using your horrible pick-up lines on me," Steve said after a brief pause.
And let's be honest, there aren't a lot of inches, no matter what Tony says when he's feeling insecure about himself and his physique. (As big as Tony's ego is, his height is incomparable; he's like a tiny adorable kitten that's walking around in an expensive suit).
He's just coming back from his mission of getting to the kitchen without catching anyone from the team's attention and getting a fresh pot of coffee, and is about to step into the lab when JARVIS stops him.
"Brucie-bear! Hi! Steve says I have to tell you that I'm not feeling great and I have a headache. He won't let me fall asleep, Bruce. Tell him to let me sleep," Tony whined into the phone.
Tony had a hard time focusing on him, and his eyes, with both pupils blown wide, kept on drifting to the bathroom door. It was almost as if he were afraid that the person who did this to him was going to come after him.
It's only once the meeting is over and everyone is standing up to leave does he turn around, eyes searching for Steve. He's disappointed when he doesn't see him, but then again, the meeting had gone on for
"How could I say no to that? Such a sappy speech. And I can't believe you proposed with a candy heart. Unbelievable," Tony said, shaking his head in disbelief.
After, dessert resumes as normal and they spend the rest of the evening together, watching movies and sipping on wine until the early hours of the morning.
He bites his lip and pointedly looks at the table in front of him. This way he won't be so distracted by Tony that he forgets his own mission: to get over Tony.
It was all part of the healing process. A road that they were traveling. Together. And that's all that mattered.
Not that he's feeling all too calm at the moment, in fact, he's the exact opposite of calm right now.
And when Steve finally pulls away from him, not fully, but a mere couple of inches away just so that he could look him in the eye, Tony allows that, too.
So he ignored Tony's whining and the pout that made him want to back Tony up against a wall and kiss him until he was breathless (he knew it wasn't ever going to happen again, and told himself to forget it) and spun Tony around until the man was looking at him face to face. His eyes searched Tony's blown ones, and grabbed his hands, effectively stilling their movements midair.
He lost track of time a while ago, but he knows he's been down in the gym for a long time. Natasha and Clint had long come to soar and then left again, same with Bucky and Sam.
"A letter," she confirmed. "This letter, Tony, is a very important part of the healing process. By writing to Steve, you afford yourself the opportunity to thank him, or forgive him, or ask him why he did the things he did. Now, we don't mail the letter but the simple act of putting it on paper frees you, allows you to let go," she said, "Do you think you can do that for me?"
Tony was his main priority. He was willing to put aside his own annoyance and anger at Tony from their argument and focus on the state that Tony was in.
"Only about a million times, Tony. Also, I suggest you answer Pepper," Steve said. He looked pointedly at Tony's phone where it had lit up, no doubt due to Pepper texting him about the little stunt that he had pulled.
He cleared his throat. "Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I tell Cupid to shoot you with that arrow one more time?" Tony read. He looked up at Steve, waiting for a reaction.
In which Steve grows frustrated and throws someone overboard, and continues to ignore the obvious signs that maybe, just maybe, everything isn't okay.
"Shut up. I don't sleep well by myself and I was severely sleep deprived and hyped up on caffeine. And you don't get to play the innocent card! I believe you were warned in advance by both Rhodey-bear and Pepper before we got together, so you can't say you weren't warned about my genius ideas. And the sentient toaster was a brilliant idea! My baby is just scared of Thor and his pop tarts, that's all," Tony patted the toaster lovingly.
“I considered Tony as a brother.   He was a good man; he deserves to be a good man.  Only you and I will know that, and it makes he happy that I’m not the only one to see it.  Please accept this for my brother Steve.”
“THOR THE GOD OF THUNDER IS APPROACHING!” Yells Thor. Item to sell: Pants. Phil: “although Thor gave good face, he was joking around a little too much. Other than that, he gave a great photo.”
*Tony, 19: “Damn, this is not a good sign at all. I’m going to be the lone wolf in this competition.”
"So one night, he's 21... comes out to his folks.  They're a little 'up tight' about it you might say.  They tell him they don't want a gay son, it's not natural and so forth.  They fight, he gets in his car, runs it off the road.  BOOM!"
machine, one of those huge two-player 'dancing games' where you step on pads on the floor to progress, when he suddenly stops.  Tony's dancing on it, with Natasha, whose alternative look suddenly seems quite chic.
The models’ jaws drop while the actors do their best to pretend to look shocked. Then Tyra walks out, looking amazing but also very serious. She walks over to the stage.
Moments later, the fire door is flung open as Steve stomps out.  In the middle of the alleyway, he paces in a circle for a moment, upset and uncertain, not knowing what to do.  He spots the fire escape, sneaking up the side of the building.
when she spots Steve, "Hey!"  Steve recognizes her, "Oh hey!"  Natasha points at the Pac Man cabinet, "Golden Age, right?"  "Right!" Steve says still looking around.  "You playing, or..."  "Sorry looking for someone," Steve apologizes.  Natasha nods, "Maybe next time?"  Steve nods and walks away.
"You would not have got me at all.  At All." Steve let's out a sigh, "If you really met me, I mean if you REALLY met me, you wouldn't like me..."
Coulson: “You would have an Amazing pose, but as soon as Russel picked up the camera, you lost the pose. You need to hold on to the pose.”
starts playing on the stereo.  He reverses out of the driveway and goes to drive forward, but suddenly Carol is there, in the road.  He pulls a face, not entirely unkind, but unimpressed and impatient.  He guns the engine and drives around her.  Tony's car roars along the highway,
Steve abruptly stands up, very flustered, “I—uh—I—listen…”  Tony isn’t offended, immediately takes it with good grace.  “It’s okay” Tony responds.
was in love with her."  This is hard for him, "but she chose not to stick around."  Steve slides closer, and runs his hand through Tony's hair.  There are tears glistening in Tony's eyes now, "So now it's me.  And I'm passing through, and before I leave I'll have a good time.. I'm just gonna have a good time,"
Steve looks back over at Tony.  Tony is looking at the table, Steve looks back down at his drink, blushing, then back at Tony.  This time Tony is looking at him, sipping on a straw flustered Steve looks back down.  Tony smiles faintly, he leans in to Wanda , interrupting her.  "... I mean I guess if at the time, I'd put that money into, like computing.  Caught that first wave, woulda been a different story-"  "Gotta use the bathroom", Tony tells her.  He stands up and walks toward the men's room.  Across the way, Steve watches him go.  Tony glances at him as he leaves.  Steve gets up.
"Didn't think to.  You know when she was dying, Pepper said to me- when they offered her this, to pass over, pass through serve eternity in this fucking graveyard you're so in love with- she said 'How can I?  When Peter didn't get the chance, How can I?'" Tears are in Tony's eyes, "And so she went, and I wish I could believe she's with him now, they're together, but I don't.  I believe they're nowhere.  Like you said, gone, just gone."  Steve goes to embrace him, but Tony physically pushes him away.  "No.  I pitied you and that's the truth, I pitied you.  And now you give sales pitch about how fucking peachy 'forever' can be..."
“Yes” Carol answers.  “He’s kept these since the day you gave them to him.  I took these off his body when I retrieved you from the battle sight.  He looked at peace.”  Carol starred out the window, taking in the view of the field.  “You may not believe me, but Tony never stopped loving you.  It’s been 4 years since you and the rogue avengers left, but he never stopped loving you.”
The entrance to the tech company 'Shield' is highly secured.  The campus is in Silicon Valley with a huge sign reading SHLD Systems.
A small distance away, Steve is found, dressed in his regular attire, watching Tony, plucking up the courage to approach.  From Steve's perspective, Tony is listening to Wanda.  When in reality Tony is a tad bored.  Wanda's saying stuff like, "... so it was micro-surgery I guess, I mean both my kneecaps were just worn down..."  Back to Steve.  he seems to be exhaling, calming himself, mentally counting down.  Then, he starts walking over.
Suddenly everyone realizes there’s an upstairs. The BEDROOMS. BEDS. All the models run upstairs. The Penthouse is a 3-bed 2-bath apartment with 2 office spaces. The largest room is the New York Room (originally the master bedroom), with 4 twin beds and 1 queen, a walk-in closet and a beautiful bathroom with 2 sinks, a toilet, and a tub/shower. Downside to this room is all doors have been replaced by curtains. The second largest room is the Tokyo Room, 4 twin-size beds, amazing views, but only 2 dressers. The smallest room, Milan Room has 2 bunkbeds, enough for 4 models with a beautiful closet, downside is the tight squeeze. Just outside of the rooms is the second bathroom, and a lounge area overlooking the kitchen, dining room, runway, and living room. Steve, Clint, Thor, Natasha, and Bruce run into the New York Room, jumping on the beds, and Steve lays right on top of the Queen.
“With each other?”, Steve hesitantly asks.  “Uh huh”, Tony looks at Steve in a ‘of course silly’ type of way.
“What are you, like Amish?  That’s one sheltered existence you got there.”  Steve shrugs, “As far as my family is concerned, I can’t do anything.”  Tony sits beside Steve, “Yeah.  Well, no-one knows about even half the shit I get up to”, tony pauses, “with your folks, it’s from a place of love, though right?  They worry.”
Dramatic music plays as aerial views of the skyline of Los Angeles is displayed. Fade into Tyra’s face. The Judging room is beautiful, the nightline of LA is behind the judges and with a giant Screen behind the judges. To the left of the judges is a giant ANTM sign, and in front of the judges is a platform in which the Models stand. Their faces are revealed when the light turns on.
Steve strides away, through the rain, murmuring to himself.  “Okay.  Okay.  Okay” Steve tells himself, “Shit.  Shit.”  He Stops.  He looks up at the sky again.  Closes his eyes.  Exhales, opens his eyes again.  Makes a decision.  He turns on his heel to look at Tony.  But he’s not there, Steve just catches a glimpse of Tony walking back in through the fire escape, the door closing behind him.  Steve hovers for a moment, then decides not to follow.  He turns around again and walks away, a little crushed.
Steve walks over to watch as they dance to some hi-energy Japanese pop.  Tony is doing well, as is Natasha.  As the music comes to an end, they're both awarded a GREAT! ranking.  Tony high-fives Natasha, and looks around.  He locks eyes with Steve.  Looks unsure of himself for a moment, his smile drops.  Then he turns to Natasha, "Excuse me, gotta use the bathroom."  He starts to head off, Steve is in hot pursuit.  By the restroom, he catches up to him.
Tyra: “Definitely am getting high fashion, but I want to say that in your film you had photos in which you older than you are, and that’s not a good thing. Next up is Shuri.”
Steve abruptly wakes up drenched in sweat.  He’s shirtless and bandaged up.  He’s back at the compound, specifically the medical wing.  Light is coming in the room through the open spaces in the curtains.  He quickly turns to the side to see a figure in the corner of the room.  It’s a blonde woman.  “Who are you?” he asks.
“Kind of the first game to do that.”  She continues.  Steve just lost his last life “Dammit!”  Natasha tries to interest him in the Top Speed cabinet.
"Is that what he told you?  He’s more insane than I thought.  Did he tell you when he stopped loving me?”
I never thought people would actually read this, lol.  Still getting the hang of this website.  enjoy chapter 2
Tony looks at Steve for a moment.  Steve is kicking his legs against the wall, absentmindedly.  Tony looks at his legs, “What would like to do?  That you’ve never done?”  He sidles in, a little closer.  Steve smiles, a little excited, a little shy.  “Uh…”, Steve looks up at the Sky, “Oh so many things.”
Tyra: “Thanks Peter, next up is… Clint Barton. Whose hero name is Hawkeye trying to sell a black shirt.”
.  A Chrysler PT cruiser thrums past.  Steve, styled for the era, passes a shop window with a widescreen TV showing footage from 2002.  Into Shield he goes.  The system is blaring
Phil walks around to where everyone is making their ideas and getting dressed. Russel James is setting up his cameras. Russel James to Camera: “I want to see if the models can take something cheesy and turn it into high fashion, many clients love to reference pop culture for their designs, so this will be a test for them today. Also, they must be able to sell the product they are wearing.”
They arrive at Tony's house.  Tony's Jeep is parked outside his home.  Tony and Steve are entering the front door.  They walk inside, Steve looks around.  It's a nice place, Steve looks around a moment, "Wow!"
Steve stands up with sheer force.  ‘Please don’t make me do this’ he thinks to himself.  ‘You have to do it’ another voice in his head whispers.  “Fine!” Steve exclaims, he drops his shield, “Let’s do this one on one.”  He tightens his leather gloves on his hands.  “Face me like a man Tony.”  Tony turns around, the life in eyes has faded, he doesn’t recognize the man who stands before him.  This isn’t the Tony he used to love.  The old Tony may have signed the accords, but Tony would never overthrow the US government, he would never become a ruthless dictator, and he would never kill his friend.  What happened to him?  Now’s not the time to ask, it’s only time to stop him, even if it means killing him.
A pair of LEDs flicker immensely, labeled San Junipero Server3 0012-TonySt@rk and San Junipero Server3 0011-Steve R0g3rs.
Carol stares at him.  “Your ex-husband is a complicated man.”  She takes a seat in the armchair near the bed.  “He had some secrets he wished to take to the grave, but I am going to tell you who Tony really is.”
The New York Room: Natasha: “I think the six of us in this room are definitely the final 6.” “I couldn’t agree more.” Comments Clint. Steve and Thor nod in agreement.
Tony and Steve are on the dance floor, in 80's attire, but Steve is no longer wearing glasses, and they both have gold bands on their ring fingers.  They laugh and embrace each other on the dance floor.
"No."  A beat.  She looks at him.  A penny drops for her, "you too huh?  Well-" She drinks in a kind of toast.  Steve looks flat.  This is no use.  He's about to leave when Carol takes pity on him.  "Try a different time  Seen him in the 80s, mid 90s, 2002 one time," she takes a sip, "He's worth a shot right?"  She raises her bottle again.
A couple sidle over to Steve.  A man and a woman, both in their mid twenties.  Both dressed as sailors.  "Hey" the mans says loudly over the music.  "Wanna have fun?" says the woman.
Tony thumbs in the direction of Carol, “She’s not a bad girl, I feel kind of bad, met her at the Quagmire, so…”  “What’s a Quagmire?” Steve asks, cutting Tony off.  Tony looks at him, he decides Steve is a little innocent.  “If you don’t already know what the Quagmire is, you probably don’t want to know.”  Tony looks at Steve’s empty glass.  “You want another one?”  Tony asks.  Steve replies hesitantly, “Uh, I’m not sure—”
Tyra: “You also lost your neck, if you would’ve raised your chin a bit, I think it would have made this picture a lot better.”
Steve waves his head as though to say ‘kind of yes, kind of no’ uncertain how to answer.  “We’ll go with tourist.  So, you’re new here?”
“Shh,” Tony’s just reached a conclusion, “why the glasses?”  Self-consciously, Steve touches his glasses.  “I mean I like them, they totally work on you, but do you need them?  I mean do you…”  “Yeah the lenses don’t do anything.” Steve answers right way.  “Knew it!”  Tony slightly yells.  “I wore glasses back in school, but I guess now they’re kind of a comfort thing.”
“TONY NO!” Steve yelled at the sight before him.  Tony slashes Natasha’s throat with a jagged piece of his broken armor.  Tony isn’t facing him, he lets Natasha’s body fall, next to the others.  The bodies of Bucky and Sam, in a pool of their own blood.  Steve couldn’t believe it had come to this.  Tony’s armor has been destroyed but three of his best friends have died by Tony’s hands.  Steve must do what is necessary.  Steve’s eyes begin to water, “Why?” he lets out.
by Kylie Minogue.  Steve scans the bar, the booths, the dance floor- nothing.  He's walking out, past the arcade section, past a Namco
It's dark in here.  The two men lay down on the bed, Tony leading Steve.  Tony's hand moves to unbutton Steve's jeans.  Steve is breathless, "You'll have show me." "Good", Tony replies.  Tony takes Steve's shirt off, revealing his muscular body, "Wow!"  They kiss passionately.
Nick: “In front of us, she’s very beautiful, but I would never book the girl who is in this picture.”
Steve glances at the dance floor.  People uninhabited, laughing, enjoying themselves.  Then he looks at Tony, “Dance Floors are not ‘me’”.  “Ah let’s not limit ourselves”, Tony says, he grabs Steve’s hand and starts to lead him toward the dance floor.  Steve pulls back hesitant, “I can’t”
“When you left, Sir sequestered himself in his lab for months.  When Natasha and Vision left, he felt unloved, he felt useless.  Sir thought of the avengers as his family.”
Steve doesn’t look up, “Thanks, I’ve played it before.”  Natasha is thinking of something to say, “It’s got different endings depending on if you’re in one or two player.”  He’s too focused on the game, “uh-huh?”
' anyone.  So you've been..." Tony laughs gently, "...just totally fucking inconvenient."  Tony squeezes his hand harder, "Is... that... I mean... " Tony is getting emotional now, "I don't know how
Both Peters look up, “…Parker.” Peter breathes out in reassurance. “Tony.” Bruce, Natasha and Hope are called right after. “Five models left.” Quill, Nebula, Carol, Shuri and Wanda, are the only ones left.
Steve turns to face Tony, "You said you didn't know how long there is.  Back on the roof. 'I don't know how long there is'.  What was that?"  Tony tenses up a little.  He leans back and exhales, "They tell me three months.  It spread basically everywhere."  Steve is in full attention, Tony continues, "They've said three months before, six months ago, so y'know what do they know?"  Tony looks at the cigarette in his fingers, "doesn't even taste of anything."  He flicks it over the edge.  There is a silence.
Tyra: “Best photo goes to…” Tyra pulls out a photo “…Steve.” Steve has a look of shock on his face, steps down and walks towards Tyra. “Congratulations Steve, you’re still in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Model.” “Thank you, Tyra.” Steve adds.
.  The car skids to a halt.  Tony looks at Steve, who's ruffled, breathing fast.  Suddenly Tony claps his hands, laughs once, "Sorry but" Tony laughs, "Man your face."  Steve laughs nervously, Tony starts the engine again.
Elder Tony, sitting in a chair, suddenly lurches forward slightly, as though rousing from a dream.  He reaches for the 'connector' nodules on his temples and takes them off.  In the corner of the room sits Rhodey, asleep with a tablet in his lap.  Elder Tony rubs his eye a little, leans back against his chair and sighs.
by Lipps Inc pounds from the speakers as Steve looks around.  Everyone is dressed in the styles and fashions of 1980, but there is no sign of Tony.  Steve walks past the arcade section, which features
Tokyo Room: Okoye returns from the kitchen and sees a towel on the floor. She picks it up and realizes it is still wet. “Who the hell left this used towel on the floor?” Okoye yells. Wanda and Hope come in the room. “Hey what are you doing with my towel?” asks Wanda. “Putting it in the dirty laundry, because your ass just leaves shit on the ground.” *Wanda, 18: “Wtf this bitch is trying to call me dirty for leaving my towel by my bed.”
“Looking...?”  Steve, indicating the two of them, “You know?  Two guys dancing”.  Shock appears on Tony, “Okay.  One, folks are way less uptight than they used to be, and two, this is a party town, no-one’s judging”.  Tony looks down at himself, at his own body.  Does a slightly ridiculous ‘sexy’ move, “Face it, if they were starring, it’s because I.  Am.  Bodacious.”.  That makes Steve laugh a little, “You’re Stupid”.  “Thank you”, Tony bows slightly.
Downstairs Peter and Shuri sit on the couch with large blankets and large bowls of Captain Crunch. They just discuss about life outside of the show, suddenly the screen turns on revealing Tyra Mail. “Tyra Mail!” Peter and Shuri yell. The models rush to the TV screen.
The chorus of the track is in full swing.  Tony dances- care free.  Steve is quite awkward.  Almost just standing, watching.  He looks around, trying to vaguely move his shoulders in time, nut it’s painful to watch.  Tony leans in, “Copy me!”, Tony says in a raised voice over the music.  He starts to perform a dance move, pretty much lifted from Michael Jackson—nothing to elaborate—indicting Steve should copy him.  Steve starts to follow suit.  He’s getting better.  Tony laughs and nods, “You got it.”
, "Never got this song; it's kind of weird."  Tony Looks around and spots Steve, He smiles and holds his arm out to Wanda, "Shall we dance?"  "Uh, Sure-" She responds.  He leads her to the dance floor.  Steve stops walking and watches.  As they approach the dance floor,
Elder Tony sits opposite Peggy at a small table.  They both have trays in front of them.  Lines behind them forming to get food and drinks.  "So he didn't tell you?" she asks.  "No", he sets his coffee down, "No he did not... He said he was just visiting."  "More like visiting the trial version" Peggy adds.  Tony stares down into his coffee, Peggy fills the silence, "I mean I known him the past three years.  We talk on the com-box.  He told how he ended up quadriplegic?  And how long he's been that way?"  Tony's face says no, he didn't.
Nebula poses her gun at the ceiling. Hero Name: Nebula. Item to sell; Black boots. Phil: “Nebula needs more confidence because her nerves were showing in her face.”
Tyra: “You were all probably wondering why the fiercest 14 were going home, because you weren’t going home.” Everybody cheers in agreement. “I got to go now before you beat me up.” Tyra laughs hysterically out of the penthouse. The models are all so happy.
On a shared balcony of the tower, a party is set up with a stage. The models and actors run to the drinks and food, some dance and some converse.
Tyra looks around, “Well hello models, welcome to the first panel of the season.” Cameras pan to the various smiling faces of the models. “The first judge is the Legendary Runway Coach, Nick Fury.”
Steve looks a little troubled, Tony can't see this, but after a few beats he notices Steve is facing the other way.  "Hey!" nothing "you okay?" Tony is waiting for Steve to answer.  "Yeah", Steve turns around, Tony is looking straight at him, not watching the road.  Suddenly Steve sees headlights coming straight for them.  Their car has drifted into the oncoming lane.  "SHIT!" Steve yells.  Tony quickly tugs the wheel, sending the car off the road, on a long dusty bank.  Steve looks
“Last week, we had the most amazing…” Carol says, interrupting Tony.  Cutting her off, Tony tells her “Last week was last week” indicating Steve “I need to talk to my friend here, okay?  Haven’t seen him in a while.”  Tony puts a supportive arm around Steve.  Steve is surprised but puts on a smile for Carol.  Carol goes to speak but Tony interrupts “Carol!  He’s sick.  Like six months to like sick.” “Five actually” Steve playing along.  Tony looks at Steve, amused and impressed, but then immediately hurry to hide this, he looks back at Carol, “I need to catch up with him.  Private time.”  Carol looks, considers protesting, then thinks better of it, “okay, okay” she turns to Steve “Hey, I’m Sorry.”  Steve replies, “That’s okay.”  She looks at Tony, “I’ll see you around.”  “Sure.” Tony replies.  The guys watch her leave.
Carol sighs deeply, “What I’m going to tell you, you’re not going to believe.” She glares at Steve. “Tony only told me because I was new to the team.  I was only on earth once a every month, so Tony felt he could tell me his secrets and plans.”
Tyra walks over to the ‘rejects’ with sadness in her eyes, “I’m so sorry, but we’re not going to give up, right?” The ‘rejects’ all nod. Tyra waves over the finalist, “We have to get this competition started models.” She heads over to the doors of the building and the “finalists” run over and they all head inside. The rejects are all sad and trying to cheer each other up.
"Ah" Tony thinks, "Couples months" slight pause, "plan is, long enough to enjoy myself."  He looks at Steve, "Guess I'm a tourist like you", and gives him a smile.  Steve looks out the window again, "yeah."
They arrive at Smashbox Studios, everyone is excited for their first photoshoot. They walk in to see a large green screen behind Phil Coulson, wearing a cape?
Steve spot a small photo of a man aged around 40 on a mantel piece.  A photo of a dark haired man smiling beneath a hand made sign reading "Happy Birthday Peter."  "With your dad?" Steve asks.  Tony gently turns Steve away from the photo, to face him instead.  Then he starts kissing Steve.  After a moment's hesitation, Steve reciprocates.
Steve’s eyes begin to tear up, “Why did you tell me all of this?  Wouldn’t it have been better to keep this all as a secret?”
Tyra: “This picture is amazing, the pose, the face, and the smizing eyes. And I feel like I should go out and by that outfit.”
“If you let me finish, then you will get your answer.”  Carol sits back down.  “Tony still loved you.  He still loved you even when you cheated on him with Bucky.  The Accords were the nail in the coffin, and he noticed how you stopped loving him.  Regardless, he still loved you, even if you didn’t.”
Steve leans over and gives him a kiss.  Tony is embarrassed, possibly even annoyed by the vulnerability he's just displayed.  He glances at a clock radio by the bed.  It's 11:59pm.  "Time's nearly up" Tony says.  "Then lets lie here", Steve replies.  They lie, in the dark, without speaking for a full fifteen seconds.
"That's not what I mean," Tony starts to tense up, "Pass over.  When you're ready, when it's your time.  Pass over," Steve begs.
. “Loki.” “Jane.” “Margret.” “Stephen… Strange.” Steve Rogers looks upset that he wasn’t the Steven they were looking for. “19 models, but only 5 spots left.”
“The Prizes are a bit similar to the past 2 seasons, a Contract with LA Models, and a Contract with FENTY Beauty.” Pictures of the past two winners, Ororo Munroe and Scott Lang appear in the FENTY ads. “and your new prize… a Cover, and a six-page spread in… Vogue Italia.” All the contestant’s cheer. “Let’s begin.”
“Shuri.” Shuri basically sprints to Tyra, which makes Tyra chuckle, “Congratulations, you’re still in the running to become America’s Next Top Model.” Shuri thanks her. There’s a long pause, which makes the contestants nervous. “Quill.” There’s a sigh of relief, “I would’ve called you sooner, but you need to impress the judges more.” Quill thanks her. “Three girls, but only 2 photos. The next name I am going to call is…” dramatic music, “…Nebula.” Nebula covers her mouth; opened by shock. “We need to see more confidence; you need to feel as good a you do in this photo. Congratulations, you’re still in the running to become America’s Next Top Model.”
The sun rises on Downtown LA. The models enter the limousine and it drives off. The vehicle arrives to a fancy mansion in Beverly Hills. The models walk to the back yard where there stands Phil Coulson and Erin Wason. The models cheer in excitement.
Nick Fury: “Yes. Since your arrival you have been watched and analyzed, and we have decided on our finalists.”
There's no-one else here.  Tony is standing in front of the mirror checking his hair.  Steve enters.  He stands beside him.  Just stands there for a moment, no-one says anything.  Then Steve breaks the silence, "I don't know how to do this."  Tony is still looking in the mirror.  Mock innocent, "Do what?"
Just then, Carol appears nearby.  She opens her mouth to speak, but Tony gets the first comment “okay, Carol?  You’re just pestering now.  Do I have to red light you?”  Carol checks her watch “Two hours thirty-five, there’s not much time left.”
There's a silence, Tony looks lost in thought.  Peggy looks over at Rhodey with a 'What do I do?' face, Rhodey looks back at her with an 'I don't know'.  Tony is the one to break the silence, "When?" Tony asks.  Peggy waves an arm in the direction of the hospital cafeteria, "uh... let's go grab a coffee."
Then a hand reaches down to help him up.  He turns around.  It's Steve!  Tony looks at the outstretched hand, then looks up at Steve.  He begins to reach up.  The clock on the dash clicks to midnight.  Steve now stands alone in the middle of the road.
“It’s my first night”, Steve answers.  “First night!  Well okay!” Tony says cheerfully.  He clinks his glass against Steve’s.  The music changes.  The opening of Fake by Alexander O’Neal begins.  Tony laughs and claps.  “Oh my god! Ha!”, Tony laughing, “we HAVE to dance to this.”  He takes a huge gulp of his drink.
Nick: “Huh. The hands are very distracting, and it takes away from the fact that you’re supposed to be selling the jacket.”
Nick: “The person who impressed me the most is…” he pauses, “…Tony.” He jumps up and down in excitement.
there is, and I can't... I... I wasn't prepared for this, for YOU, for wanting something so-"  Abruptly Steve turns to him, and they kiss passionately.
“You are.  Jack and Coke, times two” Tony demands.  “Oh no.  Mine was just a coke” Steve chimes in.  Tony tells the barman, “Times two.” completely ignoring Steve. “Thor” starts fixing the drinks.  Tony turns to Steve and looks at him slightly strangely.
"You want to spend forever somewhere nothing matters?  End up like Carol; all those... lost fucks at the Quagmire, trying anything just to feel something?  Go ahead but I'm out.  I'm gone."  Tony takes a long breath.
Phil: “A lot of you might need some more practice, but I will not be picking the winner.” Everyone looks confused, “because…” Nick walks out from behind the models.
Meanwhile Peter and Shuri are by the TV waiting for more Tyra mail. Once they hear the yelling from upstairs, the skull mail appears. Peter and Shuri yell for their fellow houseguest to come. Once everyone is there, the message appears.
"More than 50 years back.  It's been his whole lifetime basically, so the who San Junipero system's been a big deal for him.  The biggest deal."  She takes a bite out of her sandwich, "The hospital didn't have a subscription, some of us held a crowd-sourcing campaign.  Took us a year but we got the money."  She sips her drink, "Course till he passes over, goes permanent, he's got the five-hour weekly limit, but I guess you're the same."
“No.  I mean…” Steve puts his hands over his eyes, “Dammit”.  His eyes open again, trying to get words out, “Look I—ah—you seem…”
Suddenly Steve is in a white tuxedo, "Better?"  Smiling, Tony opens the car door.  Steve climbs in and they drive off, there are tin cans affixed to the back, bouncing and sparking off the road.
Everyone walks into the hallway, grabbing their backpacks and purses and head into the elevator. They ride the elevator for a few minutes, and they’re navigated by production into a room. The room is covered in tape, boards and curtains. Their suitcases are plopped just right under the stairs.
