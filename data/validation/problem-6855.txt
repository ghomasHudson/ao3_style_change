Steve felt miserable; based on the fight that had erupted in front of the team, it was obvious that both were still reeling from their conversation in the lab earlier that day.
Obadiah stared back at Tony as he clasped his hands together, still leaning to the side in his chair.
Steve shook his head empathically. “No, Tony. I’m fine. I promise…just a little nervous, that’s all…”
Mount Liberty Hospital wasn’t too far away from Stark Tower. Steve looked down at the hospital landing pad to see several doctors standing around waiting for them to land. Tony easily guided the helicopter into place before jumping out of the cockpit. Steve jumped out after him, delicately slinging a bag containing the Synergy device behind his shoulder. The bag had a huge Stark Industries logo embellished on it.
Tony rolled his eyes again as he tapped on a section of the suit. “Whatever.” He sighed as he swiped the image away before pulling out his phone from his pajama pants.
Steve forced himself to smile back, although it was becoming difficult to do so considering whatever was going on between the two of them. He took his time reentering the room, walking over to the side of the bed he was sleeping on before waking up and climbed in. Tony slid in right after him, hugging the edge. Neither said a word to the other the rest of the night.
Tony glanced upward at Steve mid pour with a weak grin. He placed the bottle down on the counter and sighed loudly.
“Okay, Tony, we don’t have a lot of time, but…” Steve turned to face Tony again, now finding him slumped all the way onto the floor and unconscious.
Tony stepped forward as he watched Thor and Natasha manhandle Loki out of the space. “You’re helping by going to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Tony straightened up, looking at Steve before rushing out of the room. Steve glared at Thanos before following Tony out.
Bucky sighed. He looked past Sam through the room before looking downward. “Ugh…I’m going to sound so stupid saying this…”
“Stane,” Obadiah finally answered, pausing to listen to the other end of the receiver, “…yes, I also agree. I—” Obadiah rolled his eyes, but then smiled as he noticed some board members walking out of the lodge.
“You know, it was cute when you both hauled yourselves in the lab the first night, but now…” Steve indicated how disheveled both Peter and Tony appeared with a curt nod. Tony looked at him as if he didn’t know what his husband was referring to.
After initial talks concerning the project, Obadiah had then reached out to a scientist who had worked for Stark Industries when Howard Stark oversaw the company, Dr. Thanos. Under Tony’s brief regime, Thanos had been let go after leaking tech secrets; he subsequently went to work via the black market. However, Obadiah had managed to track him down and convince him to redirect Project Synergy.
“If you need me, I’ll be at the hospital.” Tony said sternly, waiting for Obadiah to exit the office.
Tony laughed as he walked past Steve to get to the console. “Not yet, Cap. I need to calibrate the suits before testing it with the system software. Just hang tight.”
Steve shrugged. “Yes?” He had meant for his answer to sound more definite, but he couldn’t really gauge Tony’s response.
Tony tapped on the top of the car before looking back at Steve. “I’ll talk to you later, Rogers.” He gave Steve one last reassuring smile before sliding into the car.
into you. You got that too nerdy smart guy thing going on.” Tony had waved his hand around as if it magically demonstrated Bruce’s attractive personality.
“So, uh, “Clint coughed, but he was grinning at his friend, “you get that date with Banner yet? You two were working late last time I was conscious…”
Tony crouched down next to Steve, laughing as soon as he realized that Steve hadn’t seriously injured himself. He helped Steve to the bed who groused all the way up.
Tony rolled his eyes, but then looked away from Steve. “Rogers, it’s fine. You just caught me off guard, okay?”
“Is it about the buyers?” Steve asked quietly after a moment. He could feel Tony’s stress levels and was attempting not to add to it again.
It was obvious that the penthouse was huge, but Steve and Sam could hear laughter and music playing from the balcony, delightfully filling the space around them. They stood still, transfixed by every single inch of Tony’s place, remarking silently to themselves how modern and tech-looking everything appeared to be with sprinkles and dashes of antique-looking items and toys for children.
“Wow,” Bruce’s voice materialized as they worked, “this is going more smoothly than I had hoped.” He joked.
Obadiah wore a broad, satisfied grin on his face as he waited for the press pool to settle. He straightened out his suit jacket before resting his hands on the podium in front of him, waiting to give his speech.
After describing what best he could about Thanos’s intended plan, Fury had put Loki into protective custody on the condition that he would no longer leak Synergy secrets. Tony had been even more frustrated with Loki’s detailed responses; he didn’t understand why or if Loki was protecting Obadiah. Tony wanted to move quickly to prevent Thanos from further sabotaging Synergy, but he needed to gather more intel to prove that Obadiah was also complicit.
— Tony panicked as the phone rang a second time, irrationally thinking that Steve might be in bed with Sharon although he had just spent the last few minutes convincing himself that their relationship wasn’t serious.
Steve shrugged. “Maybe. Or he was having a bad day. I don’t actually know so I can’t really speculate.” Although Tony’s behavior had been irritating, Steve decided to give the man the benefit of the doubt. He often gave others the benefit of the doubt; it was something he had learned to do while in the army, but his natural disposition leant toward it.
Tony made a face before laughing to himself, knowing that Bucky was only trying to get a rise out of him. He turned around to sit down in his chair.
“Hey!” Bucky had suddenly appeared at the threshold of the entrance to the kitchen. Sam quickly motioned for him to chill in front of Steve who was facing away from him.
“Actually,” Tony made his chair recline as Steve sat down next to him, “I think I might end up passing out…I need to ask T’Challa where he bought these chairs…”
Loki snorted as he placed the cap on Obadiah’s desk. He set the package next to it, shedding his coveralls before opening the package to find another disguise and his tool kit.
It was early in the evening and Tony was sitting in a nice, quiet restaurant with Pepper, still sulking over the fight he had with Steve the past weekend. Tony had made dinner plans with Pepper a while ago; part of him wanted to cancel, but he needed some sort of distraction from the argument with Steve and his lingering suspicion that Steve was possibly keeping something from him.
“Do you two need any help?” Steve asked, putting his hand on Tony’s shoulder as he approached the stove.
Tony laughed again as he messed up Peter’s hair. “Okay, finish packing so May isn’t waiting too long.”
That entire week, Steve had spent most of his waking hours trying to figure out how best to approach Tony, yet he was feeling anxious and overwhelmed; he thought Tony would have cooled down by now to at least work in the lab with him, but he hadn’t heard one word from Tony since Monday.
Steve nodded as he leaned inward to kiss Tony again. Tony grimaced through the kiss as he felt his chest constricting, but then Steve holding him seemed to calm his body to degree, enough not to fidget uncomfortably.
However, Thor didn’t care. What was important was uncovering what Thanos was up to and the Synergy team needed all the help they could get.
“…everything appears fine. But…” She trailed off, glancing upward quickly to acknowledge Tony and Bruce.
Bruce shook his head with another sigh. “I’m not entirely sure what else we can do at the moment…” he turned to face the console that displayed the list of sequences related to Thanos’s weapon, “…Tony and I already discussed this, but if we push the device past its current limits, it may end up being more destructive than Thanos’s weapon. We can’t afford any mistakes since the stakes are so high…”
Obadiah stared at Tony, cracking a slight smile before walking toward the door. He walked past Tony before turning somewhat. They glared at each other before Obadiah patted Tony on the shoulder, keeping his hand in place as he looked at Tony intently.
The press pool began clamoring for more answers as both Rhodey and Bruce fielded their own questions. Tony kept his eyes on Steve; his expression was soft, yet it was accompanied by an affected grin.
Steve nodded slowly. “…he was so upset the last time I saw him…I just made everything worse with arguing over Synergy in front of the team…I should have talked to him in private…”
Tony took a moment before answering. He looked directly at Steve. “Nice work then, Rogers. I don’t know anything about acting, but you definitely deserved an Oscar for
“Tony…” Steve started, feeling Tony smile through the phone, “…so Sam and Shuri are having a thing a couple days before the wedding…it’s for the bridal party…but we can bring a plus one…” He squeezed his eyes shut as he waited for Tony’s response, now instantly regretting his proposal.
“Okay, have fun.” Sam was in the kitchen drinking a cup of a coffee as Steve passed the opening, carrying an overnight bag on his way out to work.
“…I was thinking about asking a friend of mine over for dinner, you know, with you and me. Would that be okay? I know you have a busy schedule with being a nine-year old and whatnot…”
Someone, near Tony and Steve, was whispering loudly to the person next to them. However, without missing a beat, Steve whisked himself and Tony away from the chatty couple, obscuring the bystanders’ view.
Tony tapped on his earpiece. “Okay, great. We just generated the S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker…” he motioned for Shuri and Bruce to set up the tracking device.
Tony kissed him as he continued to rub; his mind locked on the feeling of Tony in his mouth. Steve felt his body giving in as he gasped once more, groaning as his body speed up its pace. He groaned again as he finally let go, staying on top of Tony, panting somewhat before sliding to lie on his side. He felt Tony run a hand through his hair.
Rhodey eyed Tony suspiciously before going back to what he was talking about before. Tony listened to Rhodey for a bit before excusing himself to go outside on the balcony.
. Tony sighed to himself, knowing full well that his obsession with his feelings for Steve would eventually affect his work.
“Bruce...help Steve get people away from the building...” He directed in the lowest, saddest tone although Bruce had awkwardly witnessed every single word exchanged.
"I really don't know what you have to say to me without Pepper being here, Obie." Tony shot back before returning to his phone.
Steve took a deep breath and pushed forward as best as he could. There was no use in trying to argue back.
Tony groaned loudly into the pillow before turning over onto his side. Earlier that evening, he had updated Fury on the situation with the Synergy device. Some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had been dispatched to the Tower in the labs, Pepper’s place and May’s. Tony had also sent Peter over to May’s thinking it would be safer for him to be there, but that only exacerbated the feeling of loneliness Tony had been wading through all night.
busy that I probably won’t get a chance to sit them down until another week or so…I mean Pepper already knows we’re seeing each other. Wouldn’t be surprised if Fury and Obie are already aware. Just gotta be transparent or whatever.” This time Tony managed to make his statement sound like a joke toward the end which prompted a smile from Steve.
Finally, Steve realized that Tony was holding a tube of lube. He felt a little uneasy as it became clear that there were about to have anal sex.
Tony smiled back shyly, but then chuckled at the way Steve used the word “technology”. He thought about Peter meeting Steve but wondered how to go about doing it without making it a huge deal. Also, would Steve even want to meet Peter? He was probably just being nice asking about him from time to time. Tony ordered himself not to over think the possibility or lack thereof until he finally figured out Steve’s intentions.
Thanos grinned at him, accentuating that wicked scar on his face. “Good.” He motioned for Obadiah to follow him into the testing room. As they entered the room, the scientists scrambled around trying to prep the device again for use. Thanos motioned for Obadiah to stand with him near the device.
Bruce sighed as he dipped his eyeglasses downward. “Yeah…I have no idea what the hell I’m looking at, Tony…”
Steve exhaled with relief as he entered the elevator; he wasn’t sure Tony would let him up. Steve scanned his fingerprint before he leaned against the back wall of the elevator. He agonized over what he was going to say to Tony once they greeted each other. The elevator flew past each floor until it reached the penthouse; the shaft stopped promptly before opening its doors to reveal a very worn-out looking Tony.
“Okay everyone. I want you to meet the newest member of our team. Steve Rogers, a decorated military vet who now studies law at Columbia University.” Fury reached out across the table in Steve’s direction. Everyone else in the room turned to stare at him.
“You know what’s great about the device? Its super lightweight, yet durable. That’ll be great once we’re on the ground, don’t you think, Tony?”
He took a moment before continuing, unsure if he should bring up having Steve stay over when Peter was home.
Tony smiled weakly at his friend. He did feel a little less stressed lately since getting to know Steve better. His issues hadn’t gone away completely, but it was nice to have Steve distract him once in a while.
“What?” Tony got into Loki’s personal space, “what the fuck are you talking about? If you’re not working for Thanos, then you can tell us who’s been involved.”
Steve eased in another finger; his motions were picking up pace causing Tony to moan even more. Steve could feel his cock twitch with anticipation as he listened to Tony moan and squirm on his fingers. He kept watching, rapt by the scene.
too excited about science. Everything science. This furor for the pursuit of knowledge is no less intense when it comes to Peter’s project for his school’s upcoming science fair. Steve tries to remind Tony that it’s just a “fair” and not a “tech expo”, but Tony only laughs; of course their kid will have
Natasha lowered the helicopter so that the team could help Steve and Tony inside before they flew straight to Mount Liberty.
Steve shuffled a bit as he looked away from Tony to look upward at the ceiling. “I always felt awkward…it felt like I wasn’t…doing it right…”
“Wait a second, Tony.” Bruce said as he watched Tony slam the door to the guest room before pacing back and forth, “what’s going on?”
He smiled as he reached out a hand to caress Tony’s neck. “I don’t like talking about past relationships, or lack thereof…” he laughed quietly which seemed to ease the atmosphere between the two.
They continued their Synergy-related conversation until they reached Tony and Steve’s lab. Upon approach, Tony spotted Steve working in the lab already. He froze immediately, almost knocking into Bruce in the process.
Tony nearly dropped his drink as Rhodey walked in front of his view of Steve, “Pep sent me over here to get you ready for the presentation. Are you ready or just daydreaming?”
“I don’t have the time or the energy to deal with this right now, Bucky. You can do whatever you want, but I’m not leaving this room until later this evening.”
Sam nodded again, but Tony could tell from his expression that he was genuinely concerned. However, Tony barely responded as he said goodbye before walking out onto one of the balconies.
Tony walked ahead of Steve out of the main space to one of the smaller spaces attached to it. One of the consoles had the mostly reconstructed Synergy device sitting on top.
Tony squirted some lube into the palm of his hand. “Also, let me know when or if you want to stop. It feels weird at first, but trust me, if you like it, you’ll be begging me to touch you like this always.”
Steve took his time responding, telling himself he could finally take his time. He smiled at Tony who smiled back.
Clint took his time approaching Steve and Tony. “Uh,” he shuffled around a bit, looking incredibly uncomfortable, “I think you guys look great together, by the way…” He offered awkwardly before spinning around to sprint off in the opposite direction.
Steve reached out his hand to stop Tony from squirming around so much, placing his hand on Tony’s shoulder and squeezing tightly.
Steve had to keep himself from blinking as he turned to face Tony directly. He did like spending time with Tony in the lab, but this would be the first time they would be together outside of the lab and not with the team. Although some aspects of Tony’s personality still bothered Steve, he was relaxing more around his lab mate and having lunch with him sounded nice.
“Despite the immense amount of stress you put on yourself, you’re perfectly healthy for someone your age.”
Tony scoffed. “I don’t know, Bruce. When are you going to ask Natasha out on a proper date?” He sneered as soon as Bruce turned red from the comment.
The comment made Steve laugh as he let Tony walk ahead of him, and Steve laughing made Tony’s face turn red from how much better he was beginning to feel.
“Relax, Tony. I think it did more good than harm. Steve seemed appreciative of the information. I can tell he likes you. And I’m not just saying that.” Bruce crossed his arms again. Tony sat backward in his chair, desperately looking everywhere except at his friend.
Steve hummed loud enough for Tony to hear that he was seriously considering this seemingly important question.
Tony chuckled as he turned over onto his side to reach out a hand to caress behind Steve’s ear. Steve eventually settled, letting Tony touch him.
Steve smiled with relief as he joined them, kissing Tony before rubbing Peter on the shoulders. To Steve, Peter looked fine from having been so upset the night before.
“Thanos worked for me for about a year…we caught him using company equipment trying to build some sort of a weapon…but nothing I’ve ever been contracted to build…something more…diabolical, I guess…let’s just say, nothing a military couldn’t use without being charged with a war crime…”
Tony nodded, happily pointing to a cupboard. Steve retrieved a couple plates, washed them off, and found some silverware before walking to the dining room. Tony met him with a giant serving plate full of breakfast food.
After learning about Clint earlier that morning, Steve wasn’t sure how to process his emotions. After Tony and Bruce had taken the time to upgrade the device to the new recommended safety measures, Steve had been sure that the team would be able to use the device more effectively. Now one of his teammates was in the hospital and the program was at a standstill.
Tony chuckled, looking down at himself, pulling Steve closer toward his body. He took his time rubbing Steve before answering.
Bucky then leaned against a counter, smiling at both Tony and Peter before looking directly at Steve.
Steve nodded before answering. He could sense Tony slowly disengaging himself from the conversation.
Steve took his time before addressing Tony; he could feel Tony pulling away from him again and figured it was probably best to talk in the morning.
“Sam!” Bucky was calling for Sam, still reclining in his seat, “we can drink on this flight, right?”
“Tony, I’m not doing this.” He crossed his arms as soon as he made sure his towel was secure around his waist.
Steve breathed deeply. “I know you wanted…” he stopped as he looked directly at Tony who was now facing him.
me?” Steve repeated, “Tony, how many times do I have to remind you that you broke up with me. I don’t understand why you keep doing this. You
“And, uh, thanks for the offer, Sam, but I should really get home. I need to relieve my intrepid babysitter.”
“It is now half past six, Sir. Mr. Parker should arrive in a few minutes based on past received data.” Tony sighed after J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him once again of the time; he had barely finished the thing he was working on.
Bruce squeaked, shoving the piece of paper into his pocket. “Of course, not.” He joined Tony at the console, “so, uh, the reactor…” he tried, pointing to a projection.
Tony had stifled any emotion he possibly could before going out to the house with Steve. He knew that if he didn’t, he would be a wreck the entire weekend. However, after becoming even closer to Steve physically, Tony let his guard down which could have been the main contributing factor to his recurring nightmare and subsequent panic attack over Peter.
, just uphold your end of the bargain and I’ll do mine. Agreed?” Obadiah nodded once before angrily tapping on his phone to end the call.
Steve shook his head as he placed a hand on Tony’s arm. “I’m not saying to ignore Peter…it’s just when you get really excited about something like this…well…” He stopped before elaborating.
“I, uh, well…” Tony began. Steve picked up on his tentativeness almost instantaneously. He reached out a hand to rub Tony’s shoulder.
“Bureaucratic nonsense.” Steve answered with his best stage confidence, which earned a flashy grin from Tony.
Obadiah laughed quietly. “I heard about your great work today and I think the board would agree that you would be the best to represent this project and Stark Industries during some of our upcoming promotional press conferences.”
“Yeah, I’m down.” Tony offered casually as he unhooked himself from Steve to slide his hands into his pants pockets.
He turned around to face the middle of the office, nodding. After a minute of barely listening, Obadiah looked at his watch, noting the time passed in what he thought was an unnecessary conversation.
Tony looked back up at Steve before leaning in more, wavering a bit before placing a hand on Steve’s knee.
“It’s okay. Stay as long as you want.” He rushed out of the room toward his home office, leaving Steve in a state of frustration and confusion.
Tony nodded as he continued to smile at Steve. They looked at each other before Steve motioned toward the inside.
Tony had to stop himself for a moment. He wasn’t even sure if Steve was interested in him, although the whole being vulnerable thing at dinner and now this suggested otherwise. Or maybe he was just being nice? Maybe Steve felt sorry for him because he was such a maladroit and could barely function around other people who hadn’t already known him for years.
Bruce chuckled. “So, what do you think of Steve, Tony?” Tony knew Bruce had picked up on his interest in their newest team member early on that day, especially when Tony was trying to talk to Steve as casually as possible, yet he sounded strangely inept at the same time. Bruce had also caught Tony staring at Steve once or twice.
Steve nodded as he walked ahead of Tony, accidentally bumping into him in the process. Tony sharply sucked in a breath of air, holding still as Steve passed.
“…with this tiny sleek device, the Stark Facial Converter, one could more than alter their face, they could become—”
“…of course, Tony…” Steve said after a brief pause, “but please remember that I’m here whenever you need me…”
Tony turned somewhat to smile back at Steve before placing a record on top of the player. It spun around a few times until it began playing Billie Holiday’s “I’ll Be Seeing You”. Tony plopped down on the sofa, groaning to himself as the music continued to play. Steve watched the scene in front of him before taking his time to join Tony. He sat up straight with his hands in his lap as Tony sank further into the cushions, leaning on the armrest with a hand covering his face.
“Do you think this will ruin our chances for the state-wide competition?” Ned asked Peter as he cowered behind his friend.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s before rubbing it. He turned his head somewhat. “Thanks, Rogers, but we got it handled. Right, Parker?”
“Sir, it’s a quarter to six.” J.A.R.V.I.S. reminded Tony of the time. It was getting close to when Peter’s aunt would be dropping off the nine-year-old.
Tony then shuffled around, trying to get comfortable. “Uh, Steve…” he started, smiling weakly, “…thank you…for coming back for me…”
Tony nodded as he scrolled through his phone. “So, you’re not going to like this, but I had to switch up the wiring for the reactor.”
Steve smiled to himself as best as he could considering that he still had Tony in his mouth. He felt a hand run through his hair, prompting him to move his free hand up Tony’s front, feeling his abdomen. Tony pushed upward into his mouth, but Steve could tell that he was trying to restrain himself. Tony’s body felt tense, but Steve tried to convey that he was fine by glancing upward at Tony as much as possible, continuing to feel his body.
Steve smiled as he reached out hand. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Beck. Peter talks about you all the time.”
“Uh, sure?” Tony finally responded as he looked around himself awkwardly before taking Steve’s hand to follow him toward the other dancing couples.
a softy parent, Tony. Steve agrees with me,” he retorted, “remember how worked up you were about that trip to Venice?”
Both Steve and Tony hopped into the employee express elevator to get to the mezzanine level with the helicopter.
It also wasn’t lost on Tony that that night with Steve had been the first in long while he had finally slept all the way through the night. The reminder made Tony feel even more sick with grief.
Ever since seeing Steve in person since their breakup, Tony couldn’t stop thinking about him. After they broke up, Tony suffered through a serious bout of depression that led him to drinking constantly. The episode had happened mostly while Peter was away at a summer camp for a couple months, but Tony had managed to get himself together before the worst happened. During that time, he had also received every single one of Steve’s messages and calls but was too upset with himself and how their relationship ended to answer.
And sure, Tony was brash and harsh at times, but it didn’t really bother Steve. He was planning to give his lab partner a chance before writing him off just based on first impressions.
“Hey! I don’t know what you’re—ugh…forget it.” Tony picked up a few napkins from the counter to dry his shirt. As he tried to make himself look more presentable before summoning up enough courage to speak to Steve in a casual setting, Tony felt someone place a hand on his shoulder.
“Remember that person he was seeing?” Tony continued, “Steve told me on the phone before we came out here that they broke up and that he wasn’t looking for a relationship…”
Tony clenched his glass to steady himself, interrupting Sharon as soon as she finished a sentence. “Uh, would you excuse me for a second? I see someone I should be coaxing into investing in the company. It was really nice to meet you. Hope you enjoy the party.” Tony spun around to walk away from Sharon before she had a chance to respond.
They stayed like this for a second or so before Tony pulled away. “I’m sorry, Steve…I have to go. I’m sorry…” He whispered before letting go.
Rhodey shook Steve’s hand. “Nice to meet you, Steve. Tony’s been telling me that you’re quite the teammate.”
After reading Steve's letter a few more times, Tony finally convinced himself that maybe he should try to calmly talk to Steve in person and just let him say what he had written out loud.
Hammer nodded quickly before looking around the restaurant. He lowered his voice as he leaned inward.
Tony stopped laughing, wiping his eyes as he turned to face Steve. He kept his expression rigid to show that he was finally taking the conversation seriously.
“What an asshole. I can’t believe no one called him on it.” Sam shook his head back and forth with disgust.
The three of them went silent before Bucky spoke up again. “Let’s get out of here,” he sat down at the table, “it’ll get your mind off this fight with Tony. You’ll probably have a clear head after.” He tried, clearly grimacing from his own comment.
Tony smiled with a wave as he continued to work. “Just checking over your work, Parker. We’re lab partners, right?”
Tony nodded slowly as he leaned up against Steve. They swayed for a few moments longer before Tony let go of Steve, feeling Steve take his hand again as they left the space and out the venue before walking toward their suite.
Steve’s cheery disposition changed as he looked away before looking back at Tony. “She’s great…uh…she works in Manhattan at the public defender’s office…that’s how we know each other…uh…that’s really it…”
Tony turned around quickly before hearing or seeing a response from Loki. He marched out of the conference room as Natasha went back into the room to detain Loki with Bruce and Thor until more agents arrived.
Tony let out an exasperated sigh as he jogged after Peter down the hallway to the nine-year-old’s bedroom. “Oh yeah?” Steve could hear their feet patter across the wood flooring as Tony responded to Peter, “I’m pretty sure if I go in there, something will swallow me alive.”
Tony looked up at his friend who was still smiling at him. He tried reciprocating, but his expression was pained. He groaned again, lounging as far as he could in his chair.
Steve continued to wait until it became obvious that Tony was done for the night. He closed his eyes, but the entire night, he had trouble sleeping. He could feel Tony wrestling around next to him, indicating that he wasn’t asleep either. After a while, Tony had left the bed, but Steve stayed, figuring it was probably best to give Tony some space.
Tony glanced at Steve but continued to rummage through the boxes. To Steve, he already looked emotionally drained.
“Mother fucker…” Fury breathed before turning around to face Agent Hill, “is this real?” He pointed back at the projection to see Agent Hill nodding back at him.
“That’s something I’ll need to get used to.” Steve said with as little effort as possible which earned him a twinkle in the eye from Fury.
Obadiah stared at Steve before laughing to himself again. He crossed his arms again, looking downward before looking up at Steve with an unsettling grin.
He laid down, turning over onto his back as he listened to the shower run. Steve thought about the way Tony was looking at him which elicited a warm feeling inside. He turned his head a bit to look at the bathroom door, thinking about Tony showering, imagining Tony standing naked in the shower, touching himself while possibly thinking about him. The feeling prompted by his imagination grew as Steve could feel himself getting hard just thinking about Tony.
He held onto Tony, still feeling euphoric. The feeling washed over him as Steve suddenly felt himself falling asleep, still clutching onto Tony as he let himself drift off.
Tony sighed as he clicked on the message. He had barely gotten through Hammer’s usual annoying platitudes when there was a knock at his door.
Steve had taken the advice to heart; it became apparent, as their relationship progressed, that Tony had lingering issues he was trying to address, but Steve had developed some patience in trying to maneuver difficult conversations with Tony.
“…I shouldn’t get into the middle of it…Shuri told me to stay out of it…but I feel like I need to say something…” Sam began.
Tony scrunched up his face at the draft text message. Maybe it sounded a little too casual? Maybe a little too desperate? Had he even called him Steve to his face? Why was he wishing him a good night?
“They’re so made for each other but are too dumb to even notice.” Clint sighed to himself, groaning as he tried to make sense of the task he was given.
Steve nodded back again, taking his time approaching Tony. “Tony, I understand how you feel, but please also remember that you’re amazing…” he smiled at Tony as he took another step toward him, “you’re a great dad,” he took one more step forward, “and a great friend and teammate, Tony.”
“So, what’s on the schedule for today, Rogers? Do we get to just hang out or do we have to do group things?” Tony asked, keeping his back facing Steve as he cooked.
Tony waited a second before he heard her voice. “Hey, May. Oh, that’s good…no need, I’ll pick him up later this afternoon…,” Tony walked around his desk to shuffle through some papers, balancing his phone on his shoulder, “…ha, yeah I’m taking the afternoon off, finally for the first time in a while…that’s also good to hear…okay I’ll see you two later today…talk to you later.” Tony hung up after a second, looking downward at his phone.
After a moment or two, Tony pulled away from Steve. “But, I kind of wish you said something before we came out here…maybe we could try when we get back into town.” He offered, but he was smiling to indicate that he wasn’t upset with Steve mentioning the idea.
“I know which year it is, J.A.R.V.I.S.” Tony rolled his eyes again as he rose from his stool. He grumbled to himself as he walked to the elevator.
Tony shook Lupho’s hand before turning toward Steve. “Yes, and this is my husband.” He said with an crafty grin.
Tony marched up to Loki, tapping a few times on the tablet he was holding until he found the cleaned-up footage of Dr. Selvig damaging the Synergy device and Loki attacking Clint.
too fast. Peter wants to go on some trip to Europe with his classmates, but Tony’s having the most difficult time letting him go. “What are you going to do when he goes to college?” Steve rightfully inquires. But it turns out Tony might have been right. However, the danger ends up being not too far away from New York City.
Steve sat near the edge of the furniture; he felt like scooting closer toward Tony but was hyper self-conscious of how it would be perceived. After all, Steve was still embarrassed about the whole kiss situation at the event.
Tony’s face began to hurt from smiling so much, but he couldn’t help himself. He took his time walking back to his bedroom, thinking about Steve all along the way. As soon as he opened the door, he took his time visually soaking in the remnants of his time with Steve embodied in how messy his bed looked before they left. Tony kicked off his shoes, stripping down to his briefs before sliding into the bed, wrapping himself in the sheets as he smelled the pillow Steve was lying on.
Tony laughed. “I think Steve would really appreciate the offer, but he would probably stay with me in my room, like he usually does when he spends the night.”
Steve tried to smile back, but there was something off about Tony’s behavior now. He opened his mouth to try to explain why he didn’t want Sam to see them like this, but then Tony smacked a hand to his forehead.
Steve scooted closer toward him, pulling him close to his body. “…you can be the same with me…I’m not going anywhere…”
They both continued to stare at the other for a second or so before the rest of the team barged into the lab.
“Don’t you think you’re working Riri a little too hard for this thing, Tony?” Steve asked as he watched Tony tap on his phone.
Steve shook his head a few times. He could feel his cheeks flushing. “I…well…” He shifted on the cushion, but not enough to move Tony’s hand.
Tony gasped and moaned with every movement, running a hand through Steve’s hair. Steve used his other hand to hold Tony still, but he wiggled underneath Steve as he sucked his cock.
Tony attempted to retain his smile but he couldn’t stop his emotions from overrunning his composure; no one had ever been this direct with him before, especially after a serious fight.
Before their untimely deaths, Peter’s biological parents had worked at Stark Industries for a number of years. Both Tony and Pepper had grown close to the Parkers and Tony confidently counted them among the friends he could trust. Although he had been close to them, Tony had never expected the couple to leave him custody of their child in case of an accident, which happened about two years ago.
Still facing away from Tony, Steve nodded as he plated two plates for himself and Tony. “It’s okay. I don’t mind.”
Steve smiled a little too wide, too astonished that Tony had said yes, but that he also sounded a little excited.
Gamora looked behind herself before motioning for Nebula to follow her out of the room. They glanced down the corridor to see their father speaking with his team of scientists before the group walked into the testing area. Gamora motioned again for Nebula to follow her down another hallway.
Steve nodded, looking away before looking back at Tony. “…sometimes I think about you calling me Captain…”
Obadiah gasped for air as soon as the hood over his head lifted. He struggled, realizing that he was tied to a chair. He kept gasping for air as his eyes adjusted to the change in light, seeing that he was in a tiny room with Thanos and one of his daughters.
Steve criticized himself. He quickly replied to Sam to let him know that he’ll be home a little later and that the trip was fine. And of course, it hadn’t been; Tony would barely speak to him the entire trip back. To Steve, it almost felt as if his partner was struggling with beginning a conversation but Steve figured that their relationship had so deteriorated from his antics at the event that now they could hardly communicate on small talk terms. Steve no longer felt the camaraderie he used to feel with Tony, and it was making him feel terrible.
Steve was standing next to the only bed, staring down at it. Tony joined him at the bed, now starting down at whatever had captured Steve’s attention. There, on top of the bed, was a teddy bear holding a giant red heart, snuggled on top of a bed of roses.
Tony shook his head as he threw the diary across the lab. He then picked up his tablet to resume scavenging for parts. After another moment, Tony passed the diary again which was laying open, face down. He sighed loudly as he walked up to the diary, closing it shut before he could see any of the open pages. He walked it over to his work bag, shoving it inside, not really sure what he planned to do with it.
“Open brackets: Ominus inverted, 56789 divided by 234, delta then another aleph, closed brackets.” Tony kept reading off figures, but Steve was having trouble catching up.
“Look, officer,” Tony stepped in front of the police officer to get her to pay direct attention to him. She conveyed her annoyance with Tony invading her space as she slowly crossed her arms.
Shuri nodded but she winced. “Well…” she used two fingers to zoom into the image of the weapon before enlarging the list of numbers, “there’s a small pattern to these numbers that resembles some coding I found in the weapon…”
“Uh…maybe…” Steve shrugged, “…we can do something together this weekend? I miss seeing…you and Peter…” He shrugged again as he smiled weakly at Tony.
taken a photo of the tech, there was a possibility the image could be leaked, and Tony had way too many enemies to keep track of who would love to steal the Synergy specs.
Tony and Bruce walked over to Shuri who was now standing up with a small piece of the Synergy’s device’s vibranium core in her hand. The three of them looked at each other before looking at the core.
Pepper stared at Tony as he walked into the elevator, making it evident that she didn't believe him, but she let it go with a nod.
Bruce and Natasha were working at S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Headquarters and had asked him to go back to Stark Industries to retrieve some numbers. He had trouble understanding why he had to get the fucking numbers or whatever they were; they could just wait until the morning when Tony was in, but Natasha and Bruce preferred to work late.
Tony heard Steve sigh. “I know, Tony. I should have, but…” there was a long pause, “…I wasn’t sure if you would even care…”
Steve looked at Tony suspiciously, but then regained himself. “This could be serious, Tony.” He responded as they reached the other side of the den where Thor had a huge built-in bar. Natasha and Clint were standing at the counter, chatting.
Steve groaned as Tony continued. “I don’t know why it’s a crime to be excited about working on something with your kid. Should I pull a Howard Stark and ignore him?” Tony had meant for the comment to sound like a joke but the look on Steve’s face signaled that the mood had shifted suddenly.
“That’s quite the statement, Colonel. If that’s the case, then no need to worry.” Obadiah grinned once more before clapping his hands together.
Tony sighed. “…well, it could take out more than just a city block…definitely more than a police precinct and the buildings surrounding it…”
“I also understand,” Steve continued, reaching for the earpiece Tony had given the team after they resumed Synergy operations at Stark Enterprises, “if this means you don’t want me on Synergy…”
Unfortunately, the rest of the weekend wasn’t so gentle with him. Steve ended up spending all of his free time obsessing over people thinking he was having sex with Tony. He wondered if anyone had ever mentioned it to Tony; he wondered what Tony would even think.
Tony stared at the message for a minute or two before he heard a knock at his door. He flinched, but before he could answer, the door cracked open revealing Obadiah Stane. Tony groaned in his head but was sure his expression conveyed neutrality.
Tony gave in and crack a smile as he grabbed Steve’s hand. He let Steve pull him up to sit next to him on the bed, but Tony made sure to stay near the edge.
“Tony, why wouldn’t I want to meet Peter? He’s important to you.” He said with a smile, albeit his tone reflected his concern.
Rhodey nodded as he pointed away from the group. “Uh, yeah. He said something about needing to go back to your guys’s suite.”
Loki looked upward at Natasha before looking downward at the tablet. He stayed silent as the footage played in front of him.
The water splashed around as they held onto each other, their bodies grinding against another; Steve was trying to hold onto Tony as he pushed down, at one point almost losing his grip, but then Tony repositioned himself for a better hold.
He took a moment before slowly rising from the bed, walking to the corner of the room where there was a chair. He picked up the chair to carry back over to Steve’s bed. He looked at Steve, smiling a little as he reminded himself that Steve was getting better. He positioned the chair next to the bed, sitting down as he grabbed his snacks and some documents he needed to review.
Steve grimaced. It wasn’t as if he were completely opposed to swearing, although he never really did himself, but he figured since this was a professional environment, professionalism reigned supreme. He quickly learned that that wasn’t the case with Tony Stark.
“Rogers, save it.” Tony angrily interrupted motioning toward Steve with one hand, “not only do I have to deal with you snooping through my things, you’re insubordinate on top of it.”
Tony whistled to himself before stopping suddenly; he had scrolled to a date that made his heart sink, realizing that the trip to his family’s house in the Hamptons was fast approaching. But instead of dwelling on it, Tony told himself to cool it, squeezing his eyes shut, counting to ten, before taking off down the corridor to get to his meeting.
Thanos’s chilling reasoning rendered everyone else in the room speechless, clearly disturbed by Thanos’s untenable grasp on reality. A second or two passed before Thanos began laughing to himself before the intensity of the laughter increasingly rose.
Tony reluctantly broke away from Steve, but he was still holding on. “Okay,” he turned to everyone else, “you can all leave now.”
Steve waited for the bathroom door to close, lying back down on the bed to face the ceiling. He was still enraptured by the euphoria from last night that he didn’t think twice before hopping off the bed to walk to the bathroom.
Ever since he left Tony’s penthouse, Steve had been trying to replay last night, but all the details were fuzzy. All he remembered was getting into an intense conversation with one of Thor’s friends about mythical or historical battles or whatever before waking up. The one thing he could remember, however, was his dream about Tony. Steve had woken up and fled in horror because he thought he had a dream about making out with Tony, and then, still thinking about it as he woke up, practically fondling Tony’s mattress.
Tony made a face before he uncrossed his arms to reach into the breast pocket of his jacket. He pulled out a pair of eyeglasses before placing them delicately on the bridge of his nose.
Both Steve and Tony were standing in the latter’s kitchen one evening after work, practicing their lines for the first promotional tour for the Synergy device. Tony was walking around the space, rifting on lines while Steve stood awkwardly in one place at the island, looking down anxiously at a piece of paper with some notes scribbled on it.
Natasha’s eyes widened with disbelief. She grabbed Dr. Selvig by the arm before using a secured-mobile phone to call Agent Hill.
Hammer shook his head, leaning back into his chair. “We managed to stop it before he got far…there was something about the core of the weapon that made it unstable—”
Tony coughed before releasing from a full embrace, but he kept a hand on Steve’s arm while holding the saran wrapped bowl. Steve kept both hands on Tony’s waist.
Tony considered the statement before responding. It was true that the second simulation went far better than the first. Tony had shown Steve the best way to memorize the keys that created the figures they needed to input into the Synergy device. Both communicated with each other when needed and neither one lost their cool. Tony had figured that Steve was being as professional as possible. Anyone else would have probably asked to be assigned with someone else.
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know, Mr. Stane. You tell me.” He then turned to walk briskly out of the conference room.
“Why ask if you’re already listening in on my conversations?” Bruce muttered, prompting a laugh from Tony.
“Oh, I didn’t know you and Ms. Potts were close.” Steve responded. The statement sounded more factual than anything else, but Tony immediately clammed up.
Steve nodded as he reached over to rub Tony’s back. “This was really nice of you, Peter. Thank you so much.”
Steve groaned as he pumped himself in and out of Tony before finally settling on top. Tony gasped out loud as he let go of his cock. He stretched out his arms on either side as Steve laid on top of him panting.
Tony clapped his hands together. “That sounds great! Better coming from you than Fury or me, trust me. Because, you know, you got that ‘face’.” He joked.
Obadiah counted to steady himself before taking out his phone, tapping on it a few times before he reached Pepper’s number. He waited as the phone rang twice before Pepper answered.
Tony chuckled again. “Let me hold you a bit longer then we can clean up before going to bed…” He whispered.
Steve sighed; he knew this was going to become an issue during Bucky’s visit. Steve had hoped he would figure out the best thing to say to Bucky about his recent absence before his best friend arrived in town, but he was at a lost. Steve had been so busy with Synergy and trying to comprehend his feelings for Tony that he had neglected his friendship with his oldest friend. The two used to call each other at least once a week, but the last few months had been filled with infrequent updates and consistent failed scheduled phone chats.
Peter clapped his hands. “Until bedtime.” He smiled up at Tony who was still making faces with the mask on.
“Steve…” Tony stepped toward Steve, feeling his eyes well up with tears, “I…I…” he struggled, stopping to stand in the middle of the office.
. Come on.” Tony paused for a second as he motioned for the band he hired for Steve’s party to set themselves up behind him.
As the two friends went their separate ways after Steve matriculated into Columbia, it had been difficult going from seeing Bucky almost every single day to only a few months at a time. But since becoming close with Sam, who had overlapped with Steve at Columbia’s law school and also served in the military, Steve found the long absences in his relationship with Bucky a bit more tolerable. The three of them had gotten close and now Sam and Bucky talked on a regular basis without Steve. Steve looked forward to having Bucky around as part of his normal routine and was thankful that his newest best friend got along with his oldest.
“…you should have seen him, Tony,” Tony groaned as Bruce pressed on, “he looked heartbroken that he didn’t even know about trip. You should have talked to him.”
Upon entering, Steve and Thor were met with a nicely dressed woman standing in the foyer. She stood defiantly with her arms crossed.
“…you are serious…” Steve continued as it became increasingly obvious that Tony wasn’t going to or unable to fully respond.
Peter clapped his hands together as Steve buckled him into his seat. “Yeah! He’ll like that. He works late sometimes.”
Tony punched the button to open the doors, nearly tripping and taking Steve down with him as they entered the corridor. As their kiss grew even more passionate, Steve made it difficult for them to get to the private elevator which was just on the other side of the corridor, but Tony didn’t mind. They made out for a minute or so outside of the elevator before Tony managed to drag them inside. Steve was all over him as Tony struggled to open up the fingerprint scanner for the tech to confirm his identity. He managed to get the print scanned as he pried himself away before returning to Steve.
Steve nodded, swiping through data on his tablet without missing a beat. “Okay, well maybe someday I’ll go with you.”
“Okay. Well, when you want to talk about it, I’m here.” It was now obvious that Bruce was referring to Tony’s other issues beyond the botched simulation.
Steve got up from the bed to take a shower, meeting Tony later in the dining room. That day, they managed to go through the boxes in their target rooms before moving on to wayward items in the basement. That night, they ordered dinner again and went to bed late, exhausted from the work that day. To Steve, Tony appeared completely unfazed, but something about it was preventing Steve from talking to him about it, especially after having kept the diary against Tony’s wishes.
After spending some time in Tony’s lab, the rest of the team had gathered to view the facilities together as Fury explained their project timeline. From the tour, Steve had the chance to fully observe his teammates, who seemed like people he could rely on.
Tony watched Steve eye him as if he didn’t believe him, but finally he nodded back. “I’m sorry…I guess I’m just trying to get use to this…” Steve responded quietly.
A few minutes passed before a black car drove onto the harbor before driving toward the landing strip. Steve shielded his eyes from the sun’s glare, squinting to see a figure emerging from the car once it came to a full stop. As soon as he recognized that the figure was Tony, Steve smiled and waved, watching Tony talk to Happy who was in the driver’s seat before walking toward Steve. Steve could see that Tony was smiling back at him as he approached the plane.
After a few weeks of silence, Steve tried to call Tony, but he never answered. Steve was afraid to push communication even further without Tony responding; all Steve could think about was their blow ups in the past and he knew an argument over their breakup would probably end poorly.
Tony kept his eyes away from Steve as he continued to stretch, almost revealing skin as his shirt lifted.
Steve turned around with a kind smile which made Ned turn even more red. “I think Tony said your mom said something about nuts, right?”
He remembered the conversation he had with Bruce a while back after the first failed simulation, now thinking that he might have antagonized Tony more than he realized over the failsafe. Steve wanted the team to proceed with caution, but he had also let his emotions overtake his common sense; he should have taken his time and worked to have a calm and clear conversation with Tony.
Steve expressed his confusion as he followed Tony’s gaze with his eyes, looking behind himself at the elevator before looking back at Tony who also looked just as confused.
“Yet, we haven’t had any issues. Rogers is excellent with the device.” Tony kept grinning, thinking back to watching Steve work with the device in the hospital room.
Tony waited a moment before responding; this could either go extremely well or devastatingly spoil the night. He then transferred his energy into his sexiest bedroom self.
“…after we raided Thanos’s lab…” Fury began, slowly facing the group once more, “I noticed that something was off about the coordinates…but it didn’t dawn on me until we found the chemical traces that someone still working for Thanos had sent the coordinates…”
Thor leaned inward as his voice dropped. “Loki, I do not understand the animosity you have toward me…we have not spoken in a such a long time…” His expression was calm, yet poignant.
Tony instantly bucked upward into Steve’s mouth, feeling Steve’s tongue swirl around him. Tony moaned, louder than before as he tried preventing himself from yanking on Steve from how great the sensation felt. Steve licked up and down Tony, feeling his chest with his free hand as the other stroked his cock.
Steve felt a strong hand take a hold of his shoulder as he instantly recognized the gruff, yet pleasant-sounding voice. Steve felt his anxiety dissipate bit by bit as he turned around to face Nick Fury. Fury was standing behind him, now crossing his arms. He was wearing an all-black suit that matched his jet-black eye patch. Steve instinctively moved to salute him but instantly eased once he reminded himself to relax.
Then, Steve wondered: could Tony’s behavior be connected to his relationship with his father? Steve wasn’t in expert in psychology, of course, but he had personal experience with mental health issues.
, Rogers.” Tony seemed to be already in a state of feigned dismissiveness before Steve had a chance to answer him.
“Don’t say a word.” Steve half-jokingly, yet half sternly commanded. Sam put up his free hand in surrender before chuckling some more as Steve plopped down on the couch. He exhaled deeply as he put his hand over his face, head leaning back.
Tony effortlessly whisked the sheets of paper away from Steve so he could continue reading the instructions.
He knew he wasn’t right for Steve; he had made the right decision. However, as the song played on, and Tony was unable or unwilling to change it, he began crying, thinking about Steve. Maybe his friends were right.
“Fury’s been tracking Loki and Selvig on and off for months, but,” Natasha stepped forward to point defiantly at Loki, “we
He grinned at Tony once more before opening the door to exit the office. Tony groaned loudly to himself as soon as he was left alone, burying his head in his hands. His moment of solitude was soon interrupt, nevertheless, as another knock rapped on his door.
“…I think he and I talked back when we first went out…” Sharon explained quietly, “he didn’t tell me anything specific…he just mentioned that you guys had been serious…”
Loki let out a curt laugh as he took his time looking back at Thor. Thor was looking at him with a sincere expression again that made him roll his eyes but he couldn’t help being somewhat moved by his brother’s persistence, probably a remnant from their childhood before he found out that he was adopted.
Tony paused before continuing, smiling at Steve again. “I love you…so much, Steve.” The sentence started at strong but then ended in a whimper of emotion.
The computer then projected the numbers above a console. Steve walked over to look at the numbers, although he wasn’t entirely sure what he was looking at.
Tony nodded a couple times, counting to himself in his head. He thought maybe he should talk to Steve about the upcoming trip to the Hamptons because surely that was the reason why he was overly emotional.
Steve smiled before moving inward to kiss Tony. Tony kissed him back, rubbing Steve’s back before moving his hands downward to cup Steve’s ass. Steve moaned softly into Tony’s mouth; he thought about how great it felt being so close to Tony which translated into thinking about how great it would feel to be
Steve chuckled, feeling a little self-conscious about being so brazen. “Uh, well,” he laughed awkwardly again as he ran a hand through his hair, “if you are, I can wait.”
“I know, Steve. But whoever attacked Clint was probably looking for the device…” He explained, his voice trembling.
Tony laughed. “I’m glad to know that the insurance we provide for our employees is top notch, but why didn’t you say anything? I would’ve gotten what you needed, since you’re, well, you know, with me.”
The plan was for Obadiah to deliver Thanos’s weapon to the island, yet Obadiah wasn’t too clear on the details; both Thanos and Nebula had been extremely cryptic when they kidnapped him and forced him to carry out this task.
Tony nodded. In the moment it was nice, but this wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted Steve, the way they were before.
It felt like the pit of Tony’s stomach dropped to the kitchen floor; now he was worried that Steve was planning to end things with him yet respected him enough to do so in person.
Tony had turned his body around to face Peter. He had one arm on the island countertop. “Good start, Parker…hmmm…” he began, “…I’m going to go with the IBM 360.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “They asked a few of us to participate in recruitment campaign for the army. It was around the time I became a Captain.”
“Mr. Rogers!” Obadiah shouted as he wedged himself between Natasha and Bruce, “so glad to see that you are well.”
Thanos grinned once more before relaxing his face. “Greed, Mr. Rogers. Absolute greed. You’ve said it yourself: our world is becoming more destructive by the minute. Your team thinks you can save humanity by saving others with Synergy, but I
Steve laughed as he followed Tony out of the kitchen and into the foyer. He found Tony standing near the elevator, studying his watch. Tony grinned at him before he walked over to give Steve another kiss as the elevator chimed with an arrival.
Steve’s expression stayed the same, signaling to Tony that he knew he was joking about Steve’s first day at Stark Industries, but chose not to call Tony out on it. Tony silently gave himself some credit for making a flirty move that wasn’t too overt.
Peter laughed, rolling his eyes as he rifled through his backpack until he produced something square and poorly covered with Christmas wrapping paper. Steve made a sentimental face of appreciation as Tony grinned from how goofy the wrapped gift looked.
Thor turned around from his conversation to address Tony. “It’s Jörmungandr!” He answered happily, holding the pitcher with the cocktail high up in the air.
Tony sipped gingerly out of his cocktail. He was perched against the bar counter with one elbow rested on the surface. Bruce had been rambling on and on about the algorithm, but Tony was barely paying attention; he was too busy watching Steve talk to Thor and Clint.
“Some working music would be nice, J.A.R.V.I.S., if you don’t mind, please.” Tony teased as the computer began playing the remix to “Savage.”
Steve laughed as they waved once more before exiting the stage. They were joined immediately by Bruce and Rhodey who then walked with them to a room filled with press agents. Rhodey motioned for everyone to take a seat. Steve pulled out a chair at the end of the table in front of the press pool, followed by Tony who was joined in the middle with Bruce. Rhodey sat down at the opposite end of the table.
Tony waved Steve off as he laughed to himself before answering. “Steve, that’s really nice of you…” he then moved a hand to rub Steve’s hand on his arm.
An audible sigh of relief collectively escaped the team before Tony spoke up. “Did he say anything?”
Bucky looked down at Steve before addressing Tony again. “Uh, thank you for coming to see him, but you can leave whenever. Sam and I have it covered…besides…” Bucky looked directly at Tony, “you should probably be with your kid.”
“Are you seriously writing this down?” Tony had turned around quickly, almost as if he had eyes on the back of his head.
“Well that means a lot coming from you.” Tony smirked. Steve was too focused on Tony to see that Sam was making a face at the two of them.
Tony sat back in his chair. He looked at Steve before glancing over at Rhodey and Bruce, taking a moment to project an infectious smile.
Tony laughed again but this time it was subdued as Steve could tell that he had picked up on his apprehension.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony to pull him inward for a hug. “Well that means a lot coming from you.” He whispered.
Steve nodded. “Yes…,” he whispered quietly before he began grinding against Tony’s body. He leaned downward to kiss him, using one hand to direct Tony’s hand toward cupping his ass. Tony complied as he grabbed Steve’s ass cheeks as hard as he could. He let out a moan and shut his eyes as Steve pushed downward into his body, using prolonged thrusts to rub him himself against Tony’s leg.
“…uh, so…” Tony sniffled a few times, squeezing his eyes shut as he tried to get himself to calm down. He felt a hand slide around his waist.
Tony crossed his arms as Bruce continued. “…I was planning to tell you that I had told him, but I didn’t want to upset you more with the change in plans…”
Steve moaned as Tony touched him, rocking his hips upward into Tony’s body as the feeling intensified. Steve pulled Tony forward to kiss him as Tony squirted some lube into Steve’s hands. Steve then reached forward to feel Tony’s ass, spreading his cheeks apart as he entered Tony with two fingers, fucking him slowly as Tony moaned from feeling Steve inside of him.
Tony smiled. “Well, I was kind of hoping for this, to be honest, but I didn’t want to pressure you…”
“Oh wow,” Steve flipped through the pages as he turned to sit down on the tufted loveseat next to the desk, “these are really good, Peter.”
Tony looked at Steve before facing the road again. “Thank you again for coming with me…it’s a lot to ask for, but—”
But of course, considering how dangerous the suit could be, Tony had kept his invention to himself. Steve and Peter had override access codes to J.A.R.V.I.S. but those were only to be used in case of emergency. Tony knew that although Steve was a pro when it came to working with the Synergy device, he was still too freaked out to try anything else high tech, so Tony didn’t have to worry about him snooping around and finding the specs to the suit. Peter was more of a consideration, but Tony knew that his newly minted teenager was too obsessed with his personal life to really care about anything his dad was possible getting into.
Steve’s eyes widened as his face immediately reddened. He stuck out an arm to walk around Bucky, but Bucky stopped him.
“I don’t know what to tell you...while I’m inclined to believe the opposite, Anthony and his team said the device’s core was obliterated in the explosion…”
Steve stared at Tony realizing that he was asking him to feel his ass. Steve repositioned himself slowly taking his time moving his hand past Tony’s cock. Tony lifted his body somewhat slowly, moving side to side to get more comfortable. Steve ran his hand along Tony’s skin taking his time until he felt puckering. Tony moaned again, the way he did the last time Steve fucked him. Steve kept going, feeling the outside of Tony before rubbing with the lube.
“My father is dangerous and desperate…” Gamora started, taking a moment, “…I tried to stop him, but he’s too far gone.”
He looked upward at Tony again before inching closer toward his cock, rubbing as tenderly as possible, which seemed to feel great to Tony who started moaning. Steve swallowed a lump in his throat before he closed his eyes, opening his mouth slowly, letting his tongue touch the tip of Tony. He pressed his body downward into the bed as he took more of Tony in, pleasantly surprised with how nice he felt in his mouth.
As soon as it stopped, Steve and Tony almost fell out into the foyer before running toward Tony’s bedroom. Steve grabbed Tony by the waist again as they entered, pulling them down onto the bed. Tony kissed Steve as he tried to remove his uniform, but the intensity between the two made him fumble.
Steve sighed to himself as he turned on the lights to his office. He took every free, non-work moment before the workday officially began as he strolled to his desk, placing his workbag in its usual spot on the floor next to his desk before slumping down into his chair.
“We’ll have to reconvene with our team before we speak with you further.” Whoberis said coolly, not even taking a moment to acknowledge Tony directly.
Bruce attempted to interrupt again, but Tony stopped him as he rounded the conference table to confront Steve who stood his ground as he approached.
The group mumbled back the phrase as the photographer snapped a few photos. After a moment, Sam managed to gather the entire bridal party together. Steve and Tony stayed neared each other; Steve could sense that Tony was also feeling awkward about the mistake, but something about Tony staying near him strangely relieved Steve.
Over the past week, Steve had finally figured out that Sam had picked up on his attraction to Tony; during the last few weeks, Steve had been torturing his friend with consistent Synergy updates that had more to do with something Tony had done than anything else. Yet, Steve was still too insecure about his feelings to really discuss it; he needed more confirmation from Tony first. If that were a possibility, of course.
“…Bruce and I are working on codes for another scenario before the publicity tour starts.” Tony desperately tried to change the tone in the conversation again, hoping Steve would just play along.
Steve could tell that Fury was over whatever Tony was serving, but the older man never flinched. Steve appreciated Fury’s doggedness especially when dealing with people who seemed to have an inflated sense of themselves.
Steve slapped a hand to his forehead, looking around the lab as if searching for the right thing to do next, spotting the diary flipped open on its spine. Steve sighed as he walked over to retrieve it, crouching down, taking his time picking it up with the diary still opened. It had fallen open on a series of sketches and some tasks Howard had written to himself. Steve sighed again, looking up at the glass façade, fighting with himself whether he should follow Tony.
“The upgrades show this, Tony. And you have Shuri working on the project, too. It’ll only get better,” Steve reached out a hand toward Tony as he continued, “we have an opportunity to do great things with Synergy, Tony. And it’ll help in rerouting Stark Industries from weapons manufacturing like you want.” He ended with a restrained smile.
Steve let go of Tony but let Tony hold his hand until the former was too far away in the direction of the billiard room to retain a firm grasp.
Steve looked around aimlessly, trying to convince himself that that was all there was to it before joining Tony and Peter in the kitchen again.
“Hey, Rogers…” Tony shuffled around, trying to find something to fidget with, but his avant-garde statues were the only objects in reach.
“Tony, I’m sorry if I offended you. I didn’t mean to,” he began, placing a hand on Tony’s back, “maybe we should get some sleep and talk about it in the morning?”
“You guys on break already?” Clint barged into the lab as he interrupted Tony. Thor came in right after him as Natasha took her time entering. She looked over at Steve and smiled. Steve turned a shade of pink almost immediately.
Obadiah nodded at Steve as he began to close his door. Steve barely responded verbally as he turned around to head down the corridor, noting so himself, again, to be on the lookout for similar behavior from Obadiah in the future.
Steve smiled, but not too much in case Peter was over talking about art. “Really? I would like to see them someday.”
Tony’s expression turned coy. He shuffled around shyly, before making his way over to join the group.
But then Tony would know that Steve had held onto the diary. Steve sighed out loud as he racked himself with guilt. He looked around the room, trying to think quickly. He finally decided that he would hold onto the diary and maybe bring it up with Tony sometime in the future, but not right after the weekend.
“It says I’m supposed to report at the end of the month.” Steve glanced at the letter again. His hand was shaking so he placed the letter gently on top of the countertop. Sam noticed, but only gave his friend a reassuring rub on the shoulder.
“If the place is hip, it’ll be on a Wednesday. Cool people don’t like mixing with the crowds during the weekends; college kids drink on Thursdays; and Wednesdays are the middle of the week, which means it’s almost over. Seems like something a hipster would come up with.” Clint sneered.
He continued to search until everything hushed around him; his vision was shielded by a blinding light…
the one who broke up with me, so I don’t really understand why you’re acting like you want to fix things between us. It’s too late.”
“Yeah, it’s great that you all managed to keep your project going. I hope it all works out…” Sharon offered, clearly unaware of the specifics of Stark Enterprises and Synergy.
“The one happening on Roosevelt Island. I’m sure they sent you something. It’s supposed to be the biggest thing happening this year.”
Tony walked in a group with Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, and Pepper. He looked around as they approached the reception, trying to avoid Steve as much as possible. The live band began playing while the bridal party ushered out to the middle of the space to dance.
“If you’re going to blame anyone, blame me,” he pointed behind himself at Bruce, “Banner only went along because I asked him.”
The officer removed her sunglasses to study Tony. He stared back at her before cracking a smile, but the officer scoffed, unimpressed.
“Okay!” Tony clapped his hands together to address Bruce and Shuri again, “let’s haul the items we're keeping to Banner’s lab.”
T’Challa laughed heartily as he patted Sam on the back. “Not to worry, dear brother. You’re family!”
Steve shoveled out the last sentence as quickly as possible, basically physically preventing himself from hiding underneath the nearest table.
Tony nodded with a chuckle. “I suppose you can call them that. My dad always had shit lying around from his experiments, so I would just put together whatever I could get my hands on.”
Sam shuffled back and forth on his feet. “At this design expo thing…I didn’t realize who Shuri was until we had dinner.” He added meekly.
“I’m so embarrassed…” Steve hung his head as he leaned up against the wall of the hallway. He closed his eyes as he felt a hand lightly brush his arm.
Steve nodded as he gave Tony his phone. “I’ll stay with you tonight then pick up Peter tomorrow. Do you want to see him here or wait until you’re back home?”
Yet, later that evening when he was getting ready for bed, Steve couldn’t stop thinking about whatever was bothering Tony to upset him like that. He knew he would just have to learn to adjust; that was the only way. He had already learned a lot working on the project and with Tony. He wasn’t going to let one misunderstanding or other future ones ruin this opportunity.
“I don’t know. Why don’t you break up with Natasha, don’t speak to her for a year, ask her to rejoin Synergy then ask me how
“Tony, I’m really sorry…but I haven’t mentioned to Sharon that we used to date because she and I have only been on a couple of dates—”
Steve glanced at Tony with a smile. “Sounds great, but I can meet you here before dropping off Peter, so you don’t have to make so many trips.”
Obadiah followed the staffer through the building and past the main event area before arriving at a nicely furnished conference room.
“Tony,” Shuri joined Bruce and Tony, “I don’t know if it’ll work, but try jamming the center of the core with something…it should give you five to seven minutes to get away from the device if it does get triggered by the weapon…”
“Oh yeah. Sam complains about the charge on this all the time. I think he has an extra charger. Hold on.”
Tony wasn’t sure how to articulate how he was feeling without further ruining his relationship with Steve. Tony could feel them growing distant, but he had trouble trying to be honest with himself. He did love Steve and he didn’t want to lose him.
Tony let out a sigh as he fell onto his back on the bed with his arm dangling off the edge clenching his phone. Last night’s conversation with Steve had been so fucking weird. Tony’s mind spun from the confused mess: he had trouble trying to figure out why Steve would get so close then apologize profusely for being so close. And why he seemed so cool with Tony now even though he ran out of the penthouse after Thor’s party.
you would get here early.” Grinning, Tony opened the glass door for Steve, who tried mustering up a casual nod as he entered the lab.
Tony and Steve followed Strange into a building built temporarily in the middle of the park. As they walked toward the clinic, they came across several hospital beds containing people being treated by several nurses and doctors.
“Then make sure you do that after you make me some coffee, my dearest.” Tony shifted around to lie on his back, patting Peter on the leg.
“…wait a goddamn second…” Fury breathed, tapping on his earpiece again, “Hill, set up a video conference with the Synergy team, but I’m sending something to you in the meantime…”
Tony took another deep breath, thinking he should just turn his phone off for the rest of the night.
Tony, without really considering the consequences, seized the opportunity as he thought back to the memory of Steve saying something similar to him a long time ago.
Steve took a breath as soon the private express elevator arrived at the penthouse. Forget the first time they used the Synergy device out in the field, this was probably the most nerve-racking thing he had ever experienced outside his military experience. But it was strange; he and Tony weren’t
“…you’re some date, Rogers…” Tony smiled to himself, “I didn’t get to see you at all this evening, let alone dance.”
Tony weighed the possibility; he felt like talking but he feared that he might have a panic attack. He rubbed his chest as he looked away from Steve, just waiting for the pain to appear out of nowhere.
Steve looked back up at Sam and Bucky, both expressing sincerity, but Steve sensed that they wanted him to be completely transparent about his feelings.
There was something more to the comment that Steve had trouble deciphering, but he let it go. After some minutes passed, J.A.R.V.I.S. informed them that May was in the lobby and on her way up to the penthouse.
Obadiah glared back at him, yet he was confused by what exactly Thanos was getting at. They had the schematics, Tony no longer had control over Synergy, and they were free to sell their version of the device with Stark Industries reaping the benefits.
Tony rubbed his shoulder some more before rising from the sofa, holding out his hand for Steve to take. Steve smiled timidly before accepting. He followed Tony to his master bedroom, his heart doing somersaults the entire trip there. As they entered, the bedroom was dimmed, but Steve could still see Tony in front of him.
Tony sat at the island in the middle of his kitchen, sulking as he tried to get some work done, but was still too hung up on the fight he was having with Steve. He was also trying to eat a dinner he had made for himself, but for some reason he couldn’t quite balance the flavors like Steve usually did whenever he cooked which made him feel even more depressed.
He walked ahead of Tony and Steve, pointing to the specs. “How did you create this? The medical research lab at Columbia said they were more than a year away from finding a cure…”
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat as he adjusted his tie, confused that Tony was excited to see him even though he hadn’t heard from him.
“I didn’t get a chance to talk to you about the assignment before the meeting. It sounds like Steve is doing fine.” The two of them walked out of the room into the hallway.
Tony glanced downward at his leg before slowly looking up at Steve, grinning widely from making Steve laugh. Steve smiled back; although there was a weird feeling between them, it was fading steadily as they settled in their seats.
Tony’s body violently jerked him awake. He sat up panting, sweating, clenching his chest as if his heart would burst into a million little pieces at any moment. Reminding himself to inhale then exhale deeply, Tony looked over to other side of his bed, which was empty of course.
“Just let me call Rhodey to let him know I’ll be out a little later than expected.” He excused himself as he nearly sprinted to the restrooms. He almost dropped his phone as he called his friend, making a mental note that his phone was now at thirty percent.
Steve let Tony walk ahead of him, hesitating a bit before following. He finally caught up with Tony, standing a little too closely behind him as the latter opened the fridge. Tony made a show of trying to find something for Steve to drink.
“…no longer can we…rely on traditional methods to protect…and, uh, sustain ourselves and our fellow people. This, um…calls for alternate—alternative, uh, means…” He concluded, stumbling through the entire sentence.
Steve nodded, although he felt apprehensive. He looked downward at his notes once more, clearing his throat a few times.
Steve sighed. “No, things aren’t working out…we talked last night…so we’re not seeing each other anymore…”
“—Dr. Banner, I’m sorry, but this doesn’t really concern you.” Steve nearly added in time with Tony.
“…the last time I saw my parents, I got into a huge fight with my dad…” Tony breathed out; he could feel Steve nodding against his neck.
Steve nodded. “Yeah I still need to remind myself that Tony’s famous and not just my lab partner and teammate.” He joined Sam in cleaning up.
“Roosevelt Island.” Thanos started as he backed away from Obadiah, “I need you to take the weapon there for the tech conference.”
“Steve…it’s okay—you’re doing nothing wrong…it’s me…I’m going to sleep in the office down the hall, okay? Just come and get me if you need anything.” He walked briskly out of the bedroom, nearly bumping into the doorframe, trying not to look back at Steve.
Steve laughed as he stepped into the shower, wrapping both hands around Tony’s waist before pushing him up against the back wall, feeling along his body as Tony kissed him. Tony turned them around so that his back was facing the showerhead. He kissed Steve once more before washing the soap out of his hair as Steve held onto him, rubbing his back.
Steve nodded as he reached down Tony’s body, feeling Tony’s hard cock before rubbing more vigorously. Tony chuckled as he shook his head.
“Cap?” Sam glanced upward quickly at Steve who was standing next to Bucky, “but, uh, not to put any pressure on you and Sharon—”
Bruce nodded. The two then fell into absolute working silence for a moment or so before Bruce broke it.
Tony placed his plate down on the table as he shook his head. “I don’t buy it. Something’s off. Obie
“I’m going to have to contact Hammer to figure out this Thanos mess.” Tony said to Steve as he undressed before crawling into the bed. Steve nodded, doing the same.
Steve could feel Tony nearing the verge; his body began to jerk the way it did the last time they were intimate. Steve moaned softly, completely caught up in the moment.
Steve waited a minute before he joined Tony at the railing. He let Tony settle before continuing. “Tony, I’m not talking about Sharon…I’m talking about you and me…” He explained quietly.
Steve knew that he was possibly referring to someone taking the opportunity to sabotage the device while out in the field. Even so, without delay, Tony began to read the solved equations out loud for Steve who inputted them into the device.
Steve’s office assistant popped her head into his office. “Mr. Rogers? There’s a visitor here to see you.”
Tony inhaled as he covered his face with his hands. He peered through his fingers before lightly slapping his desk.
Tony tried to smile back, thinking back to when he became emotional after being with Steve. He coughed a few times, shuffling back and forth on his feet.
“We’ll tell the board that the core was destroyed in the lab explosion.” Tony added before finally turning around to look back at Bruce and Shuri.
Bruce mouthed “I’m sorry” before covering his mouth, shocked by his action. Tony looked at Bruce then the phone then back at Bruce.
One early evening, Tony, Steve, and Peter were hanging out in Tony’s home office. The lab on the seventieth floor was still a tangled mess, so Tony had been working in his home office during the day ever since Steve’s extended stay.
Tony looked directly at Steve who was still waiting patiently for him to respond. His expression was stern, but it softened as Tony hesitated.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony, are you serious? I really doubt playing music while we work is the most important thing.”
Thanos chuckled as he listened to his daughters squabble. Eventually, he waved a hand to get the two to cease before turning toward Obadiah. Obadiah frowned before shooting Thanos a grin.
“That I would fool around with you while I was seeing someone else? Tony, do you not know me at all?” Steve’s expression was harsh as he spoke, so harsh that for a second Tony barely recognized him.
Steve nodded again as he let Tony move inward for a kiss. Steve turned a little to kiss Tony back. He felt Tony feel the back of his neck before his hands roamed down the length of his body again, pushing into Steve.
The desk manager nodded before laying out the suite keys. Everyone moved around the desk to grab their keys as more staff employees appeared to guide their to their suites.
Steve nodded as he continued to smile. “So…you don’t mind?” Tony slowly asked, but not sure if he should have.
Tony perked up. He finally realized that Bruce and Peter were staring at him while he was drafting messages to Steve on his phone.
“Hey, Tony. Could you slow down for a second? I’m still trying to input the first set.” Steve fumbled as he tried to remember the last figure from the first set.
Steve joined him on the edge as he placed a hand on his shoulder. “Tony, you really didn’t have to. The party was more than enough. And I got to hear you sing.”
As Steve reached his bike, slinging his work bag further onto his back before mounting, he thought about Tony which translated into thinking about not having met Peter. Steve sighed to himself: he knew he needed to hold back and give Tony some space. Steve usually operated that way, so he should allow Tony to do the same.
“This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Working on Project Synergy at Stark Industries would turn you into the man you’ve always wanted to be, and blah, blah, blah.” Sam interrupted his friend, but Steve couldn’t fully appreciate Sam’s playful teasing; Steve’s back was turned toward him. The two friends were standing in their tiny kitchen: Steve near the fridge, while Sam stood across the room, leaning against a countertop.
Tony used a finger to scroll through the sequences before he landed on one to show to Peter. He hoisted the nine-year old up in the air to get a better look at the projection. Steve smiled as he quietly observed.
Steve winced before settling, confused as to why Tony kept bringing up Sharon when he had thought he had been clear before.
Tony laughed. “Steve, relax” He then leaned forward to whisper into Steve’s ear, “…but we can stop if you want…”
Tony stared back at him, too shocked to really answer. His mouth bobbed open a few times as he tried to comprehend Steve’s reaction.
Steve sighed with a grin before rising from the couch. “Okay, Thor. Pour me a glass of… Jörmungandr.” He took his time pronouncing the word as he marched up to Thor who, along with everyone else, cheered him on.
“I like the beard, by the way.” Tony smiled widely at Steve as he pointed to his face, “well, I like the old look, too. But this really suits you.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “Do you think I should say something to Tony when I see him next? I don’t want this rumor flying around…especially with all the company politics…”
“Also,” Steve started, “if you want, considering you need someone to babysit…I can watch Peter for you when you’re out with Pepper…” He tried to look cool about it, but he was sure his expression exposed how awkward he was beginning to feel about volunteering.
Tony nodded with a grin before accidentally bumping up against Steve to get to his seat. He cooed as he took his time sitting down, marveling at how much space was available between their seats the table.
. You guys act like you used to be married,” he chuckled loudly before walking away from Steve to get to his bedroom, “I’m going out, but don’t wait up for me unless you and Tony have more plans later.” He added before closing the door to his bedroom.
“…you have physical therapy twice a week, so, I’ll take half days on those days to drive you there.”
“Oh, and…uh…thank you for your service.” He heard Bruce offer awkwardly. In the past, it had bothered Steve whenever he was out and about in his uniform or told someone about his service and they responded with the same phrase. After a while, he realized people were trying to be nice or genuinely appreciative, so Steve just nodded and smiled whenever it was uttered.
Steve looked slightly downward at Tony whose face went rigid before he burst into laughter causing Steve to groan again.
Tony was sitting at the little table on the edge of Steve and Sam’s kitchen. He was twirling around a beer bottle in his hands as he casually offered Sam a tour of the Synergy labs. Sam was sitting on the other side of the table, completely mesmerized by having a conversation with Tony Stark. Steve was standing at the kitchen counter, plating the rest of dinner.
Steve remained calm as he checked Tony’s pulse, relieved that he was still breathing. Steve then hoisted Tony’s body over his shoulder before running out of what was left of the conference room. He ran down half exposed hallways, running past the remains of the tech expo’s main event space, seeing flames and smoke everywhere. Steve hurriedly looked around for an escape, dodging pieces of the building as it came crashing down. He knew he needed to get to the side of the building facing the water so that the team could see them from the helicopter.
Tony groaned as he crouched downward to look for his phone. He stood up to sit back on the edge of the bed, tapping on his phone a few times.
Steve inhaled then exhaled deeply. He turned slightly away from Tony. “If you hadn’t stopped us, we probably would have had sex. Don’t tell me you don’t remember that.”
Sam had been in constant communication with Tony since the explosion, but Tony hadn’t heard a word from Bucky. The only time they had seen each other was the day of the explosion at the hospital and Bucky had refused to talk to anyone. Sam had told Tony that he and Bucky went to visit Steve about an hour before the team did yesterday. And Tony was grateful that he had managed to avoid Bucky up until now; he was still feeling weird from their last conversation.
Tony kept himself from grimacing. “Of course, Rogers. I meant it when I said we couldn’t do this without you…”
“We’re not interfering, we can help you.” Tony pointed toward the precinct, “that bomb your team is trying to disarm is
Tony was sitting on the bed in the bedroom, reading a digital copy of his dad’s original schematics of the Synergy device. Steve had left earlier to meet up with Bucky and Sam for a bit.
He didn’t have to be present during the conversation at the event to know Obadiah was trying to use Steve against him. That part should have been the most upsetting revelation. But something about Steve practically losing his shit over the idea they would end up in bed together bothered Tony to no end. He had been completely fixated on it since that morning and could barely focus on anything else.
“When he was writing in that fucking diary,” Tony shook his head as he sharply interrupted Steve, pointing a finger at the diary then to himself, “…those were some of the
Tony shuffled around a bit, expressing curiosity before really responding. To Steve it felt like forever; he began to regret even saying anything about the tour.
“Well, I don’t mind talking to you Tony until you feel tired…” Steve offered, “actually…if you want…you can come over and we can talk in person…or I can come to you? I think I need the company, too…or whatever is fine…I just know how difficult it is for you to sleep sometimes, so I’m sure everything that’s happening is only making it worse…”
“Tony, I know we said we weren’t getting each other gifts this year because of the trip to Malibu and our recommitment ceremony, but I got you something.”
Steve pulled Tony up to his face as he gasped heavily from the intensity. Tony smiled at him before kissing him, taking his time as he used one hand to rub Steve’s neck again and the other to rub his leg.
Tony chuckled before reaching out a hand to stop Steve, turning somewhat to address him more directly.
Steve winced before he responded. To Tony, it was obvious that Steve was trying to choose his words carefully, but he didn’t feel like hearing what he had to say that could possibly explain such a misunderstanding.
Tony slid down to the bathroom floor against the door, holding his head in his hands as soon as he made contact with the floor tiles. He had trouble trying to figure out why it was so difficult for him to say to Steve that he loved him too. He even had been thinking about asking Steve that night if he would like to move in, but now he struggled to think clearly. Tony rubbed both hands through his hair thinking back to what Obadiah said about their relationship.
Peter, still holding onto Steve, turned his head to nod at Tony. Tony laid down, motioning for Peter. Steve waited before they were situated to lie next to them. It was a tight fit, but all three of them hugged up against each other.
Steve sighed as he crossed his arms. “I feel like this one is too tight.” He could feel himself becoming even more uncomfortable as the suit even more accentuated his build every time he moved.
Steve was cautious of adding to the tension between Tony and Obadiah, but he couldn’t lie to Tony either.
Steve chuckled again as Tony clumsily opened a cupboard to retrieve dishware and flatware, finally deciding that he should be honest with Steve about what happened to him after they broke up.
Peter nodded quickly before jumping out of car. “I hope he stays forever!” He shouted as he dashed to the elevator.
“We need to keep an eye on this...I can feel it getting out of control. You know how he gets.” Gamora said coolly.
She rose from her chair at the table, rounding it before leaning on the edge. She carried one of her tools with her, twirling it around and around in her hands before she continued.
“I'd rather be in custody.” Dr. Selvig looked intently at her, his voice, this time, never quivered.
Tony inhaled as he closed his eyes to think. It was true; he never liked talking about his dad, especially with the people closest to him. He had also talked to a therapist about that in the past, yet, he never came to the realization that it was necessary to be open like that with the person he was seeing.
Pepper looked back and forth between Tony and Obadiah, still extremely confused. Obadiah lingered before clapping his hands together, making the situation even more awkward than it had already been.
Later that evening, after putting Peter to bed and wishing Bruce a good night, Tony strolled to the master bedroom.
Tony nodded once as he shuffled around to provide some room for Steve to sit next to him. After Steve settled next to him, both men stared at the beach; the few lights surrounding the landscape only hinted at the dark coloring of the water below them.
“You okay?” Steve asked as soon as they were alone, placing his hands in the front pockets of his jeans.
Despite how worn he looked Clint managed to shuffle around a little in the bed to get more comfortable.
“Tony, it’s okay.” Steve stepped into the room. He sat down on the other side of Peter’s bed before the nine-year old reached out for him. Steve, caught off guard, paused before hugging Peter back.
But as Steve filed through the memory of his past actions, Tony ended up scooting closer toward him instead, slowly closing the gap.
Tony attempted to ignore Steve’s outstretched hand, but by this time, Steve had scooted himself closer to the edge to peer over the side of the mattress, wearing a kind-hearted smile. Tony was incredible annoyed, mostly with himself, but also with last night and the entire trip, but something about Steve’s jovial presence managed to break through his misery.
Tony could tell from Natasha’s expression, which wasn’t easy to do usually, that something was bothering her. He motioned for her to continue.
Rhodey laughed, but his gaze lingered on Tony. “Tone, don’t fight it. Steve’s good for you and vice versa.”
Tony stopped struggling with the lock as he let Steve gently turn him around so he could face him directly.
Tony smiled as he buried his head into Steve’s chest, using one hand to draw him close to his body. Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulder to pull him in close. He kissed the top of Tony’s head before settling.
Tony cried to himself as he placed his head in between his knees. He stayed like this before turning slightly to look at the side of the bed Steve used to sleep on when they were dating.
“Ugh, forget it.” Steve let out quickly, lying down flat in the bed, trying to pull the covers up to his neck, but Tony yanked on the blankets as he continued to laugh. Steve then tried to turn over onto his side to face away from Tony, but the latter pulled on his body to turn him back around, still laughing although subdued.
Steve sighed as he thought about that day, smiling a little as he remembered that that was also the same day Tony had asked him to try out the team’s safety uniforms.
“It’s a minor security breech. The agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. handled it as effectively as possible.” Tony responded with reassurance which seemed to ease the board member.
Steve laughed as he leaned inward to kiss Tony again. Tony scooted downward in the bed as Steve laid down on top of him.
surprised; ever since returning to the lab from their outing, all he could think about was the possibility of having a quiet night in with Steve someday.
Steve spun around away from the sink. “I probably did something else stupid at the party. Thor was passing out some cocktail he made after you left.”
But before Steve could finish, Thor kicked the door handle, causing the door to fly open, taking part of the door frame with it. In the room were several people, including Loki, sitting on couches and futons, staring at the commotion.
Steve furrowed his brow as he took the hint that the conversation had been taken to another level; it was now more about their continuing fight than anything else.
“But you really need to take more breaks more often. That’s the best evidence I can give you and your stress levels.” He waved bye to Tony before exiting the office.
Nebula had assured him that the weapon was stable when not in motion, so Obadiah decided to leave the briefcase in a niche under a counter in the conference room. Before arriving, the tech conference staffers had agreed to providing high-profile participants with high-tech secure rooms.
Bruce and Shuri nodded before the trio broke up to work in various places in the space. Before walking over to the table she usually stationed herself, Shuri rejoined Tony at the console.
Steve smiled as he followed him, waiting for Tony to gather whatever he had been working on in the office before following him to the bedroom.
Bruce joined her. “Yeah, whatever he was referring to could be obsolete with this current iteration…”
Tony was in his autopiloted helicopter on his way back into the city, thankful he didn’t have to pilot the damn thing because he was too upset about Steve.
Tony laughed. “Okay, Parker. I’ll figure out what we’re having if you cook most of it.” He quickly looked over and downward at Peter.
“Would you, um…” Steve flinched, almost sure he hadn’t heard Tony begin to address him again. He turned somewhat to look at his lab mate out of the corner of his eye.
“Bruce…” Shuri whispered, looking in the direction of the niche in the counter Obadiah had hidden the weapon the day before, “it’s over in that counter…”
Natasha approached the window looking into Clint’s hospital room. She could see Clint sitting up in his bed, talking with his wife, Laura, while their kids played in a corner.
Tony looked dejected by Steve’s answer. Steve paused again, trying to figure out how to navigate the situation without upsetting Tony.
Steve looked upward at the ceiling before peeking downward at the covers on top of his body. He removed the sheets slightly to keep looking at himself before reaching downward to feel a little. He moaned as soon as his hand found its way to the base of his cock. He closed his eyes as he felt himself, getting so caught up in the moment that he lost track of time.
Tony had to stop himself from rolling his eyes again. He shifted in his seat but before he could say anything, Obadiah continued.
Steve nodded back as he let Bucky drag him toward Sam and some in-laws. Tony watched them leave before looking around the space. A few guests were dancing and eating while some had congregated outside closer to the water.
On the way over, Tony had been trying to find the best thing to say to Steve, but it was obvious from their exchange in the lab that Steve was about to confess that he wasn’t really into Tony, essentially playing games with him the whole time, even if unintentionally.
“It’ll be stable enough for a small attack…so it’ll still emit the reactionary blast,” Bruce added, “but like I said, if Thanos is planning for something big, we’re risking the device’s stability.”
Tony nodded as he felt Steve come inside of him before feeling himself come all over his chest. “Fuck,” Tony moaned as soon as his mouth was free, “I love you, too, Steve.”
Tony nodded back but felt too weirded out about Bucky moving in with Steve, alone. He tried to shake it off, refocusing the conversation on something else, but every attempt failed. Thankfully, he was saved by a cheery-looking Bruce who had approached them.
Tony tried to respond, but his mind kept trying to reconstruct his behavior. He had been head-over-heels in love with Pepper as their friendship developed. A therapist he once saw told him that was a usual pattern he exhibited in relationships, but he thought he was over that with Pepper.
Tony’s eyes widened. He slowly placed the device on the table in front of him as he rose out of his chair.
Steve smiled, now thinking about Tony being inside of him and how great it felt despite a little pain at first. It was nothing like anything he had ever experienced before and he definitely wanted to try it again.
“Peter, why don’t you tell Tony what you learned today?” Steve asked Peter who had taken a break from his story to eat his food.
if you deserve it, Captain Rogers.” For a brief moment it felt as if Steve and Tony were the only people in the room. They immediately stopped whatever was going on between the two of them as soon as Sam let out a little too loud, uncomfortable-sounding cough.
But Tiberius held still as he leaned inward to stare at Tony before looking over in Steve’s general direction.
Strange pointed to the beds. “We’ve been receiving so many new cases that we can’t fit everyone in the clinic, that’s why this entire area has been cordoned off.” He explained further.
…Tony wondered to himself before searching for Steve in the main part of the mansion. He found Steve chatting with someone at the buffet table.
Tony used his body weight to push Steve onto his back. He then climbed on top of Steve, straightening up as he rocked his hips forward. He leaned forward slightly to rest his hands on Steve’s chest. Steve’s body instinctively rocked upwards into Tony’s, but he tried to restrain himself once he realized he was rolling his hips faster.
Steve groaned as he tried to get the phone away from Tony, but the latter maneuvered effortlessly around him, still laughing at Steve’s expense. Tony got up from his chair to show the video to Peter who clapped his hands as soon as he recognized Steve. “That’s you, Steve!” He exclaimed with delight.
Tony nodded as he sat down in the chair indicated. He took his time making himself comfortable as he waited for Mr. Beck to continue. Mr. Beck also took his time; he shuffled a few things on his desk, before sighing and interlacing his fingers on top on the desk.
The scientist kicked the tablet across the space before turning back around toward the object the team had been working on the past few months.
Sam smiled back before motioning for everyone to follow them down the airstrip to a fleet of armored cars that would drive them closer to the resort buildings. T’Challa smiled as he greeted Bucky and Steve, shaking their hands vigorously.
“It’s really great to see you, Tony, but I thought we were spending some time together tomorrow night?”
“I suppose we’ll need to go back in. We’ll practice creating the functions with the keys before the next simulation.” Tony kept his hands on his hips before turning around slowly to face Steve. Steve couldn’t help but stare intently at Tony; his change in tone was a little unnerving. Was this his attempt at apologizing?
“So, when are you supposed to show up for work?” Sam chugged his glass of champagne before pouring himself another. He motioned toward Steve to do the same. Steve smiled, knowing he should celebrate his achievements more often, and reciprocated the act.
“Barton. Please. You’re interrupting important business.” Tony sighed as he put his hands on his hips. Clint huffed instead of verbally responding as he walked over to one of the consoles.
Tony turned away from Steve, sighing as he rested his hands on his hips. Steve waited bit a longer before continuing, now watching Tony finally put on something to wear.
Tony looked away from Steve before looking back up at him again. Steve looked at him intently until he leaned inward, with Tony doing the same. Tony then kissed Steve as he kissed him back with Tony’s hands traveling up Steve’s backside as Steve pulled him close to his body.
Obadiah looked at Thanos then at the device. It looked more or less like the device Tony and his team had constructed with a few modifications that could be gleamed from Howard’s original schematics. The original device that Thanos had constructed with the help of Dr. Selvig and the parts Loki had stolen from Stark Industries had been used as a guide to build this new weapon. Thanos also bought a shipment of vibranium off the black market after the Wakandans curtailed their exports once Synergy shut down.
“So…what is it?” Clint asked as he leaned further back into his chair. Steve thought he was close to falling over.
Tony waved the intern off before addressing him. He pointed back at Steve as he stormed out of the conference.
Tony rolled his eyes with a brusque laugh. “Everyone always says they’re worried about me when they should be worried about themselves.” He drained the half pour before slamming the glass on the counter. He then turned to march out of the kitchen.
Tony sighed, trying not to lose his cool over the whole situation. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “I don’t understand. Peter would have said something about this.”
Steve waited again, realizing that he had unintentionally upset Tony even more. “I didn’t say you were old, Tony.” He then shuffled a bit so that he could face Tony more directly, “I said you were older than me. Also, that’s not the point. The point is that you’re my employer.”
“Please don’t tell me you were planning to leave without saying goodbye.” Steve looked downward to see Tony smiling up at him.
Tony leaned backward in his chair as he pursed his lips together. “Of course, it doesn’t, Obie. Fury and his agents sound like they have the security part handled.”
Steve sat rigid in the chair, trying not to look even more frightened than he had been about a second before. Tony gave him a thumbs up and a cheeky smile before pressing a button on the device. It made a clicking noise, but before it did anything, Tony suddenly lurched to the side, screaming in agony as he fell off his seat.
Tony nodded slowly as he sat down in a chair next to the bed. Steve had been in the hospital for a couple days since the explosion and this was the first time anyone had seen him since his surgery.
Steve sighed as he nodded, joining Tony at the console. He watched Tony work quickly and effortlessly; the numbers and sequences showing the calibration raced up a projection above the console.
“Bruce should ask her.” Peter beamed at Bruce, who only shielded his face with his hand. Tony laughed hysterically.
Tony reached over to pat Steve on the back as they proceeded to walk to the front of the room. “Yep, I think we’re good to go.”
Bruce and the rest of the team had crowded around Clint who was looking out along the water with a pair of binoculars. Clint scanned the area until he spotted two heads bobbing up and down in the water.
Tony nodded as he reached downward to caress Steve’s face. “I get it. But we’ll take it easy, okay?”
Fury interrupted the chatter. “We haven’t had any new assignments, but we need to keep testing the device before this scheduled simulation for the board. I think now that we have the device stabilized and have run a few scenarios on it, and I believe we’re ready to test it in the field once again.”
“Rogers,” Tony began, “set yourself up a few feet away from the explosive. We shouldn’t need to get close.”
“So, before I go all the way in, I can’t touch your cock, even though I really want to…” Tony massaged Steve’s hips, “I guess it’ll make you tense.” He kissed Steve as he pushed himself forward.
As it became clear that his friend’s thoughts were occupied elsewhere, Bruce halted in the middle of the hallway with his arms crossed. Tony kept walking, completely unaware that Bruce was no longer walking beside him.
From their playfulness with one another, it was obvious that Natasha and Clint had known each other for a while, but they didn’t act like they were dating. Steve learned later that Clint was married after the latter bombarded him with wallet-sized photos of the Barton family’s last vacation trip. However, it was obvious that something was going on between Natasha and Bruce; both ignored each other as much as possible, acting professional on every level, however there were moments when Steve caught one or the other watching the other. Steve smiled at the thought; he remembered being initially shy like that with his ex-girlfriend, Peggy.
Steve wondered to himself, trying to calculate when Bucky would have had the opportunity to do such a thing.
Steve gulped as he looked over at Tony before facing the robot again. It continued toward him slowly before Peter tapped on the tablet again to stop it moving before giving Tony another thumbs up. The robot lifted its main component once more. Steve stared at the robot, wide eyed. The robot stopped stretching to its full length, menacingly towering over Steve.
Mr. Beck nodded. “Everyone can benefit from a little therapy.” He smiled back at Steve and Tony, but of course that made Tony feel even less reassured.
Tony nodded as well, trying to use it as an opportunity to make a joke, but his kid’s thoughtfulness shattered any immediate attempt.
Natasha spotted him walking into the restaurant and waved for him to join her. Bruce coughed nervously as he took his time walking to the table. He hesitated before giving her a weird semi-hug, but Natasha just brushed it off.
Not only had Steve been exposed to his hotheadedness early in their working relationship, his lab mate was also aware of his personal struggles. Who knows what’s going on through Steve’s head now?
Loki swore as he panicked, trying to finish what he could without tripping the failsafe. The device made a noise, and Loki swore again, banging on the device a few times with his elbow before it clicked once more. He couldn’t get to the reactor mechanism in time which would have controlled the size of a blast, but Loki paid little attention to it, looking behind himself to see that the corridor was clear. He straightened himself out before walking briskly out of the lab to the employee express elevator.
“Tony?” Tony could see Steve watching him as he internally debated with himself, “I really want us to make this work.”
Steve sucked on him for a moment longer before letting go. He then laid down on top of Tony, humping his body, letting out ragged gasps in between.
“Yeah, sure.” Peter barely let out as he hopped out of the car but was internally grateful that Tony had been right about the trip.
Tony inhaled sharply as he felt Steve unzip his pants, pulling them downward as he felt Tony through the fabric of his briefs. Tony pushed upward in Steve’s hand as his cock hardened with every stroke. Tony closed his eyes as he felt Steve pull down his briefs, feeling Steve’s hand against his skin.
“Yeah, it’s a personal preference of mine.” Steve spun around the image a few times. After a couple swipes and zooms, he felt like he was quickly getting a hang of the controls.
Tony hardly said goodbye to his friend before hanging up. He knew Rhodey was just teasing him, but he was trying to tread lightly with Steve in order not to scare him again.
“…I’m so…close, Tony…” Steve let out, but his body was one step ahead of him, groaning as he came instantly.
Despite the damage the robot had wrought on the auditorium, no one sustained any serious injuries. Yet the following day, Steve and Tony had received a phone call from Peter’s school with an earnest request from the principal to meet her for an emergency meeting that day.
Gamora squinted her eyes before looking back at Nebula who only rolled her eyes. Gamora then looked back at Obadiah before lowering her silencer.
Bruce shrugged. “Nothing…I’m just worried about you, that’s all.” He barely missed a beat as he returned to his work.
Tony waved her off with a smile. “But he didn’t. You just proved that Obie is scheming behind us and this company. We just have to make sure he doesn’t get anywhere near the device to replicate weaponry.”
“Oh, well I would have thought that he would have by now.” Bruce shrugged before looking downward at a tablet he was holding.
“Can you please send me these?” Tony tapped on the phone after returning it to Pepper’s desk. He hopped out of the chair to exit Pepper’s office, stopping at the doorway to look back at her.
Lately, ever since they started working on their friendship, Steve had been thinking about whether he should tell Tony that he had kept the chip. During one workday afternoon, Steve remembered Tony vaguely explaining that the modifications to the Synergy device had made all the old components obsolete, so he wasn’t sure if it would even help.
Thanos stepped closer toward him, mere inches away from his face. “If you trust my methods, then you’ll trust that we’ll produce this ‘super’ weapon to its full capacity.” He made sure to emphasize the word “super”, showing his frustration with everyone referring to his masterpiece so trivially.
Something was still bothering Tony about this trip; he was confused by Steve’s intentions. Tony remembered that Steve had told him on the phone that he wasn’t looking for a relationship at the moment, but here they were on a wedding getaway for the bridal party, sharing a suite obviously meant for a couple, a situation Steve seemed unwilling to fix.
Steve laughed as he looked over at Peter who was tinkering with the robot. His eyes then scanned the entire lab: it looked as if Tony and Peter had been camping out in the space for days. Steve crossed his arms as he glared at Tony who was too busy chomping on a cookie while scrolling through data on a tablet.
Loki sighed as he hung his head. He was standing in front of the Synergy team at Stark Enterprises in the main space.
J.A.R.V.I.S. repeated itself for the second time to an unconscious Tony. As the computer continued on, the damage to Tony’s suit caused the system signals to cross one another, triggering one of Tony’s favorite playlists, starting with Beyoncé’s “I Miss you”. Tony woke up immediately a few seconds into the song, blinking his eyes in confusion as he looked around the charred remnants of the conference room and the surrounding area.
Tony shook his head as he marched away from the group to the other side of the space, feeling the walls collapsing in on him as he wrestled with trying to figure out what to do next.
Steve nodded before pointing to a file on the projected desktop above the console. “What’s this, Tony?”
Tony laughed quietly, looking downward before looking up to give Steve a coy grin. “Because, baby, you’ve never done this before and there’s a
Clint was there to celebrate after a forced leave of absence due to his injuries and Fury was almost ready to let him return to his full tasks with Natasha. Bucky was in town to train for his new assignment; he and Sam had watched a live stream of the presentation in Berlin with the others at the restaurant as they waited for the rest to arrive.
Tony turned to Peter with a shrug. “I don’t see any reason why your dad should know anything about this, right?”
“Banner was supposed to go with me, but something came up…” Tony looked directly at Steve, “…would you like to come along instead? I understand if you don’t want to…”
Steve could tell from the sound in Tony’s voice that he was grinning downward at him. He inhaled deeply as he nodded, still feeling his body rock into the bed. He felt Tony rocking on top of him before squeezing his ass which caused Steve to suck in an air of breath.
“You look busy…” Tony stood looking downward at a student who was holding a notebook with the Stark Industries logo plastered on it. She looked meekly at Steve before looking back at Tony.
Tony sighed as he straightened up to cross his arms. “Loki, I don’t have time for the melodramatics. We know you had something to do with Selvig damaging the device; we know you doctored the security tapes;
Tony squiggled a bit. “Haven’t what, Steve?” He ran a hand through Steve’s hair to indicate that it was fine for him to be open about whatever seemed to be bothering him.
“Yes, of course!” Obadiah quickly stopped what he was doing, rising from the desk to shoo the guard out of the office as he welcomed the carrier inside. The guard tried to response, but Obadiah slammed the door in his face.
Tony smacked his forehead as he remembered receiving an invitation a while back for some international tech event that planned to feature some of the biggest names in the industry while also giving startups some space to brand their new ideas.
the resort staff forgot to change it at the last minute. But just tell Sam and they’ll fix it, dude.”
“Let’s check out the rest of this party, shall we?” Tony kept grinning at Steve before heading toward the door.
Steve chuckled as he watched Tony walk up to the island. “Maybe…we can find some time to spend together…the three of us I mean…maybe next weekend?” He stayed near the entrance to the kitchen before joining Tony at the island, “…well…I guess I don’t know what your plans are…”
Steve nodded with a kind smile. To Tony, something about the smile was both super sexy and innocent.
Clint snorted as he pulled out his phone to tap on it a few times. “How did you guys manage to make it when I was in the hospital?”
“I was just reading before calling it a night…trying to keep my mind occupied…are you all right?” Steve repeated.
He remembered that Tony’s lab was on the eastern side of the tower and headed in that direction. His nervousness dissipated as he imperceptibly continued breathing deeply. He knew by the time he reached the lab’s glass doors he would be at his A-game. Why many of the labs had glass faces was beyond Steve, but he didn’t know too much about lab design, so maybe it served a purpose.
Loki waved him off with an unsettling grin. Steve made a mental note to himself to ask Tony about it when he finally got a chance to escape Thor.
Bucky’s laughter subsided as it became clear Steve hadn’t appreciated his comments. “I’m sorry, Steve. Who would have thought that you would be the one getting the all the action nowadays?” He smiled, but something about his expression seemed off to Steve.
Steve nodded quickly, unable to really contribute verbally. He was moaning more now as he felt Tony rubbing his neck and his cock. Steve pushed back into Tony’s body, feeling himself ease more as Tony touched him longer. After a moment, Tony let go of Steve after kissing his neck.
Again, the group agreed with Tony and the state of the project. Tony nodded back as he accidentally locked eyes with Steve. He then physically turned his body to look at Thor who was flanking the group on the opposite end.
Tony sat up straight in the bed, looking around his bedroom before nodding. “Uh, sure! Yeah just give me a minute. I’ll let you know when I’m close to your place.”
However, it appeared that Tony had picked up on Steve’s palpable trepidation because he stopped what he was doing to look at Steve.
Steve laughed as he let Tony’s hands roam along the side of his body. “Like, seriously,” Tony started again, “weren’t you in the military? Also, Synergy?”
Thor managed to get along with everyone; he even got into a long-drawn-out conversation with Steve about his military service, interests in art, and plans related to his law degree outside of Synergy. Steve appreciated the company as he was still getting use to the various personalities of his teammates.
Tony nodded again as he let Pepper hold his hand a bit longer before their waiter walked over to take their food orders.
Tony watched Steve shuffle around, setting up his work area like he had his first day on the team. Tony continued to watch, debating whether he should be straight forward with Steve or just stick to his original plan.
As soon as Tony settled the bill, they walked to Steve’s apartment, mostly discussing Synergy. Suddenly, Tony, out of the corner of his eye, as Steve unlocked the front door to the building, spotted a motorcycle parked near some of the resident cars. He looked on curiously as he walked toward it, noticing that it was sporting a small decal representing Steve’s unit from when he was in the army.
“I’m going to get some snacks and coffee from the café. I’ll be right back.” She rubbed Natasha’s shoulder before reaching over to kiss Clint delicately on his forehead. He nodded back at her as both he and Natasha watched her leave the room.
“I’m sorry I have to leave so early. But I’ll see you later this week. Happy Birthday.” Pepper leaned toward Steve to hug him, and Steve smiled as he hugged her back. Pepper looked back at Tony, waving before exiting the kitchen.
Steve looked over at Tony who was still looking downward at the record. He was clenching the casing at the edges.
As Fury finished his statement, the simulation began to pixelate, slowly revealing the suite. The rest of the team appeared near Steve, Tony, and Fury, and Pepper and Rhodey were trying to usher the board members standing above on a balcony out of the space. The team promptly marched out of the suite as they followed Fury who continued to give orders.
Tony unlocked the mailbox with the fingerprint scanner, noticing as soon as it opened a lone small white envelope in the middle of the box. Tony looked around as if he were searching for the carrier who had left it. He then saw a security guard sitting at the front desk playing solitaire with a deck of cards.
. You act all cute and innocent, but I’m on to you.” He answered, now practically wagging his finger in Steve’s face. To Tony, Steve was the one who kept sending mixed signals.
“It’s not it, Banner. We can still reinvent Synergy; it just can’t exist in its current form now that someone out there knows its mechanics.”
“Goddammit, Tony…” Bruce took a deep, harsh breath before explaining, “…I’m going with Tony to his parent’s house out in the Hamptons this weekend. He’s finally clearing out some of the family heirlooms…he hasn’t been there in ages and asked me to go with him for emotional support…”
“Oh, and this is Sharon.” Steve motioned behind himself to a nicely dressed woman that was standing behind them.
“Tony, you know what I mean. I wouldn’t have chased you for your money or fame. I wouldn’t have treated you poorly…”
Sam and Bucky glanced at each other, shrugging before pretending as if Steve hadn’t dropped a bomb on them.
“…uh, become…a different…person.” Tony finally finished which prompted everyone including Steve to clap after the presentation.
“Goodnight, baby. J.A.R.V.I.S., lights, please.” Steve felt the bed shift a bit, as the lights in the bedroom dimmed, knowing that Tony was sitting up in the bed still working with his bedside table lamp on.
Steve cradled the glasses in his hands before sighing again. But before he could let Sam offer him some more advice, Steve jumped up off the couch as he headed toward his bedroom.
Steve, without wasting another moment, flung the blankets off his body as he got up from the bed to find something to wear. To Steve, Tony looked too distressed to drive, especially while it was still dark outside.
“From the look you’re giving me now, I see that it’s working. Uncanny, right?” Tony grinned, now leaning backward onto his forearms.
Steve nodded again, unable to stop himself from smiling even wider. He let Tony hold onto him for a while, almost falling asleep. Not too long after, they eventually untangled themselves to change the sheets before calling it a night.
Tony nodded before looking away from Steve before gently untangling himself. He coughed a couple times, before turning his head to look at Steve, wearingly.
Rhodey chuckled on the other end of the receiver. “Yeah, he’s fine, Tone. You wanted me to call you when we got to the museum. So, I’m calling to let you know that we have
I'll provide summaries after this is completed (can't give away spoilers!), but I'm currently writing the next two installments to this series: one a short story and the other will be a direct sequel to Synergy. I've also figured out the rest of this series, so please stay tuned!
Tony had been berating himself every day for breaking up with Steve because he was terrified of ruining their relationship. But something about seeing Steve again gave Tony some much-needed confidence. He decided that he would go the friend route, much like he had the first time he got to know Steve until Steve became more comfortable with him again. Then Tony planned to ask Steve if they could start over and take things slow. Tony even managed to convince himself that he needed to be honest with Steve and finally tell him that he also loved him but was just too afraid to admit it when Steve confessed his feelings.
Still, any shot Tony had in even thinking about asking Steve out had probably been blown with that failed first simulation.
They walked down the hallway before being greeting by a slew of more excited conference staffers before being ushered through another hallway that emptied out into a larger space where most of the tech companies had set up their stations.
Steve considered his friend’s claim. He supposed that was also true, but he didn’t feel like getting into it.
As soon as they neared their target, Clint dipped Natasha who used the opportunity to pick the pocket of one of the men they were dancing next to, finding a computer chip. Clint then spun her around as she repositioned herself upright, allowing Clint to whisk them away from the couple.
Pepper clapped her hands together with delight, but then restrained herself as best as she could; Fury only nodded but it was accompanied with a typical-sly-Fury smile; and Obadiah’s expression remained painfully stoic.
Everyone responded quickly as they followed Tony’s orders, filing out of the command center to head in opposite directions.
life wondering if you missed out on something? I know I wasn’t Tony’s biggest fan when you started this thing, but I saw the way he was with you today, and I can tell he likes you.” He pointed at Steve. “And vice versa.”
Tony blinked a few times as he reoriented himself, trying not to look past Rhodey to see where Steve had gone.
“Welp…” Clint leaned up against the console as the rest of the team silently absorbed Loki’s ominous comment, “we’re fucked.”
“Um, yeah…I just,” Tony took a moment before continuing, “I’ve been getting this weird feeling in my chest lately…I’m planning to see Strange about it Wednesday morning.”
Whispering from the press pool grew in unison as Pepper motioned for Rhodey to take the podium. He confidently strode up to the podium, producing an official looking piece of paper to read from.
Tony slowly swiveled in his chair, letting his hands dropped to his sides. “I think I’ll be ready to go back there soon. But that’s if I don’t plunge into a downward spiral again.”
Steve noticed that his friend’s usual content disposition had slowly morphed into a look of concern.
Steve stared back at Tony, seemingly on the verge of fighting back another fit of his own. Tony closed his eyes as he wrapped a hand around Steve’s arm to disengage himself. Steve backed away from the door so Tony had some space.
“Cap, Buck and I were thinking about going to a movie later this evening if you would like to tag along?” Sam chuckled, “I think we definitely need an emergency Tête-Bro-Tête.”
After another minute of lengthy internal grousing about Steve, Tony marched to his bedroom. He tried to sleep, but he kept tossing and turning all night, thinking constantly about the letter out in the kitchen.
Tony tried to maneuver past Steve, but Steve blocked his path. Tony then backed a foot away. “Steve, I have to get back to the city—I have to check on Peter.”
“This device right here will allow our team to help someone in need immediately. Using your specialized skills, the user will be able to program the device to assist effectively and sufficiently. And this—” Fury clicked another button which caused the device to collapse onto itself and disappear. The room returned to its normal light intensity, “—is just the beginning.”
“It was nice to see you both again, and I hope you have a nice rest of the day!” Mr. Beck showed Steve and Tony out into the hallway before closing the door.
Fury was standing on the landing from above with Obadiah, Pepper, and some board members standing directly behind them. The group was flanked by Agent Hill and Agent Coulson. Rhodey was at the very end of the railing, leaning over slightly to get a better view of the team.
Tony nodded, somewhat relieved that Steve thought they had been a good team. “I mean…I think I may also be the reason why you eventually upgraded to a smart phone to join the rest of us this century.” He winked at Steve.
Steve struggled to join Tony standing. “So, I’m going to have to be the one who says no because we had pizza the other night?” He rested his hands on his hips as he looked back and forth between Tony and Peter who were both acting like they didn’t know what Steve was talking about.
“It’s nice to see you again, Rogers.” Tony accepted Steve’s hand, taking his time shaking it back which sent a wave of emotions through Steve’s body.
As Tony’s mind and body whirled, trying to mentally prepare himself for his conversation with Steve, less than an hour had passed.
Rhodey chatted some more about Synergy, but Tony’s attention was divided as he couldn’t help himself from observing from afar Steve who had been occupied with entertaining investors since they arrived at the loft. He watched Steve listen patiently to one of the investors, smiling the way he usually did that was both genuine and reassuring.
Tony and Steve barely waited half a second as the vault door clicked as soon as Shuri reassembled the codes. The vault door opened slowly, but instead of revealing the team’s next objective, a gruff-looking Fury appeared with his arms crossed.
Thor, Natasha, and Bruce followed closely behind. Bruce walked up to Tony and clapped his back a few times with a goofy grin. Thor walked over to Steve and did the same, but Steve managed to hold his balance from Thor’s usual too force-filled greetings.
Tony groaned as he turned over onto his back, realizing that he had fallen asleep on the floor of his office. He groaned again as his body ached from the whiskey and sleeping on the hard floor. Tony blinked a few times before he turned his head, seeing his dad’s diary laying open next to him on its spin, face up.
“What couple suite fiasco?” Sam placed a hand on Bucky’s shoulder as the latter began laughing again.
“…oh and…” as Steve turned to exit the space, Tony continued, “how’s Saturday then? Is that okay for dinner?”
“I would like to, but that depends if it’s okay with Tony…” Steve meekly added before Tony could respond.
Steve nodded as he leaned inward to kiss Tony, taking his time like he had earlier. Tony breathed deeply as he accepted the kiss from Steve, wrapping his arms around his neck as he pulled him in close. Steve laid on top of Tony as Tony used his legs to draw him in nearer. Steve kissed Tony on the lips before moving to kiss the underside of his chin. He then gently turned Tony over onto his side as he laid behind him, rubbing Tony’s chest from behind.
“…that you have been accepted into Project Synergy!” Steve snapped back to the present as he felt Sam give him a hug from behind.
“And miss out on Steve Rogers stories from before we met? Yeah, I got it covered. Rhodey’s with him.”
Tony tried to straighten up as best as he could. He looked over at Steve who looked on the brink of falling over.
He watched Peter slowly look up at him and smile a little, although it was clear that he was timid about being put on the spot.
Although she seemed cold at first in the conference room, Natasha now emanated a kindness to her that Steve appreciated.
“…I would like to announce that Stark Industries is…,” but before he could continue, Obadiah felt someone brushed up against him to stand next to him on the podium. He stopped speaking to see that Pepper was now standing on the podium.
Tony pressed his clicker a few times to zoom in closer to the vibranium core. Everyone, except for Obadiah, scooted their chairs closer toward the table as numbers and specs ran next to the image. Tony ignored the board’s murmuring as he glanced back at Obadiah who was now crossing his arms. The older man wore a strange smile, one that used to make Tony feel extremely uncomfortable when he was younger, but of course he pressed on without missing a beat.
As his conversation with the board member continued on, Steve felt a hand squeeze his shoulder. He turned to see that Bucky was now standing next to him.
Steve took a deep dramatic breath, causing Tony to side eye him. “Jesus, Rogers. Don’t be such a big baby.” Tony joked before wrapping a hand around Steve’s waist to pull him in close.
“When I built this resort…” T’Challa began as everyone was out of the cars and following him to the building, “I brought my personal architect with me. I had to import most of the construction materials, but it was important for me that this place reflected Wakanda. I prefer doing business that way!”
Steve squeezed Tony’s body before tilting his head to degree to look downward. “Tony, I forgive you, but I should have made it easier for you to talk to me…”
Tony nodded. “That’s a good idea, Banner. But hopefully he brings one of his friends and not a date.” He joked, of course unaware of the magnitude of such a decision.
Steve could barely focus on one image as Fury spoke. He glanced around the room and noticed that the rest of his teammates seemed just as transfixed as he was.
“Synergy has the ability to replicate any material possible due to its vibranium core.” Steve ended with a wink and nod at the crowd which earned him even more adoration.
“I-I…Steve…” Tony reached out toward Steve before shrinking back into the couch, “…I’m sorry, I just thought—”
“Steve…I don’t understand you at all…you break up with your girlfriend and then ask me on this trip…what did you think I was going to expect?"
Both Bucky and Steve looked at Sam before Bucky started laughing again. Steve sat back into his chair with a groan, sinking downward.
“Steve, how many times do I have to remind you that I’ve been around the block a few times?” Tony had meant for the statement to sound lighthearted, but it didn’t play well with Steve who let go of him before straightening up. Tony made a whiny noise because obviously the mood was possibly ruined.
Tony continued to study the data on the hologram, never breaking his rhythm as he scrolled up and down with one finger. “Unfortunately, he
“Hey, Pep. I won’t lie to you, but this could potentially become more dangerous than it already has been. Promise me you’ll lie low now, okay?” He made sure to convey to her his sincerity for her wellbeing.
“What’s up, Obie?” Tony tried for as casually as possible without letting his growing disdain for someone he used to consider a father figure seep out of his voice.
After finally processing the situation, Tony spun around to face the group who had gathered nearer toward him, all waiting anxiously for any response.
Peter frowned a little, but ultimately nodded back with a contained smile. Tony finished what he was doing before jogging to stand next to Peter.
“…can’t we use the device for the missing pieces? It’ll probably be a better fit than anything Selvig could come up with…”
The team managed to treat everyone who was involved in the accident before Fury ended the simulation. Everyone on the landing, except Obadiah, clapped at the end.
To say that Thor had an interesting place, would be a disservice to Thor and his place. Any visitor would have certainly believed they had been transported to a Viking lodge; it would have been tough to debate whether Asgard were a myth after experiencing such a set up.
“…I’m not usually like this—” Steve tried to explain but was soon interrupted by Tony lunging toward him and taking a hold of his face before planting the drunkest kiss on his lips. Tony felt Steve wrap his hands around his waist and squeeze him tightly.
Some of the reporters laughed while some others began shouting over each other, trying to be the first to get a question in.
As Steve was in the process of responding to Tony, a ringing sound emitted from their suite’s foyer. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other before Steve walked through the living space to get to the foyer. He walked up to the elevator to review the security panel next to the elevator. Steve squinted to see Bucky requesting access to his and Tony’s suite. Steve approved the access and not long after Bucky appeared in the foyer.
Strange scoffed as he finished packing up his medical bag. “Tony, for as long as I have known you, you’ve never been fearful of embracing the unknown. Why not with whomever you’re seeing now?
Tony walked to the side of the cabin where Steve was standing to see two free seats in front of a nicely carved, wooden table. The cabin had its own resort feel to it: a tasteful amount of gold trimming lined the deep mahogany wood paneling lining the interior of the plane. All of the amenities that one could ever possibly need during a longer flight was available at a short grasp.
Steve blushed, prompting a laugh from Tony. “Sorry about the late response, but thanks for checking about allergies. I’ll pretty much eat anything.” Steve clarified; his expression reticent.
Tony put his hands on Steve’s shoulders to get him to hold up. “…I know I already said this, but…thanks for being here…with me…”
Obadiah attempted to intimidate Fury with a scowl, however, he hadn’t accounted for Fury’s famed, perfected stare down. The two ended up glaring at each other, intensely, for at least a few minutes. Everyone else looked back and forth between the two men, as if they were watching a tennis match, until Obadiah finally gave in. He laughed quietly, mustering up that usual fakeness he saved for board meetings and the press.
Steve hung his head, sighing to himself again. “…I understand, Tony…really I do…and I shouldn’t have raised my voice and I should have chosen my words more carefully, but, Tony, of all the things to bring up? And, I know I already said this, but you know I’ve been seeing Sharon—”
“…I don’t think I’m right for anyone, to be honest.” Tony chuckled quietly, trying to lighten up the mood.
After a moment or two of thinking about the night his parents died, Tony moved his hand away from Steve to rub his forehead. He counted to himself before inhaling then exhaling.
“You know…I haven’t had a good night’s sleep since the time I accidentally passed out in your bed, Rogers.” Tony smiled meekly at Steve.
Natasha nodded sternly. She rubbed Clint’s shoulder again, trying to ease her friend, noting to herself that she wasn’t going to get much more out of him.
Tony swiveled back and forth in his desk chair. He shuffled through his notes as he tried to concentrate on his work, however his thoughts kept returning to his brief interaction with Steve in the lab. Their time together had been a lot more pleasant than he had expected. Also, Tony had been extremely impressed with Steve’s quickness at picking up the tech.
Steve smiled as he walked around the car to get into the driver’s seat. “Okay, then. Tell me what we should make, and we’ll get what we need for him.” He asked as soon as he closed the door and started the engine.
Steve shook his head, but he let it go; he wasn’t going to question Tony on how he chose to parent his child.
Steve moaned as Tony continued to finger him; he felt himself losing control as Tony slid the finger in and out of his body. As the feeling intensified, Steve couldn’t help himself from rubbing vigorously against the mattress, moaning louder than he had ever before. He could feel Tony rubbing his body with one hand while the other continued in and out.
Shuri chuckled as she finished gathering her things. She reached out her hand first to Tony then to Bruce.
“…Dr. Thanos went to work for Hammer Industries, I think, after he was fired. They…Thanos and his daughters…knew you were close to figuring out their plan, so Thanos had his daughters pose as buyers at some event to throw you off his scent. Someone…I don’t know who…might have been one of Thanos’s daughters…contacted me to help convince Selvig to tamper with the device and build the super weapon for Thanos…and yes, I…doctored the footage…”
Tony sighed as he looked at Steve from a distance. “I’m sorry, Rogers…this whole fucking thing is my fault…”
The following day, Tony and Steve assessed whatever was left before loading some items into their car to either be kept privately or donated to a museum. Everything else was tossed into a dumpster to be hauled off later by the current owner. They drove back to the city that evening, Tony chatted about work and Steve listened, yet he anxiously mulled over his decision to keep something this big away from Tony.
Agent Hill walked up to the monitor to get a better look. She nodded before turning to face Agent Coulson.
Sam nodded as Bucky clapped his hands together. “Hey, let’s try to enjoy Sam’s last day of freedom.”
Bruce nodded, thinking deeply before answering. “I’m working on something that will dissolve the material we use to construct our labs' hardware and software.”
Needless to say, Tony was annoyed that he had to meet with Hammer; it seemed as if Hammer Industries' business model was to copy everything Stark Industries produced so it wasn’t a surprise to him that a fired Stark Industries employee had went to work for Hammer.
“So, I already know from our conversations what you like to listen to, Rogers. I hope you don’t mind given the terrible mood.” Steve waited as Tony busied himself with the record player.
Tony felt that weird sob in his throat as he watched Steve walk toward him. He felt like running away; the feeling between them made him feel too exposed and he could feel the dull sensation in his chest again.
Tony turned to look at him. He looked worn, but he was smiling a little. “I, uh, actually…since this shit with Thanos is coming to ahead, I think I might just go back into the city early…I have a prototype autopiloted helicopter that I just synced with J.A.R.V.I.S…” He answered, shrugging.
Tony motioned with his hands to get everyone to calm down. “I’m not happy about the situation either, but we can’t keep Synergy in its current form while we have someone using Stark Industries employees to build a massive super weapon.”
At the press event before the conference presentation tomorrow, Obadiah planned to announce new plans for Stark Industries while Thanos’s contact was scheduled to picked up the weapon. The press event was the last move Obadiah needed to make before gaining majority control over the company.
Steve watched Tony close his eyes; he felt Tony push upward into his body, slowly rolling his hips with anticipation. Steve caressed the sides of Tony’s body with both hands before scooting downward, lying down on the bed as he finally reached Tony’s cock again.
Steve nodded again as he felt himself getting close from just rubbing up against the bed. He reached downward to touch himself, moving a hand past the band of his briefs, all the while still sucking on Tony, almost forgetting which movement to use as he felt his own body giving in.
But before Steve could finish, Tony waved him off with a soft, kind-hearted expression. “It’s fine. Don’t worry about it, Rogers.”
Shuri laughed. “Well, I may be in my late twenties, but I think I know a thing or two.” She winked at Tony before pulling out her tool kit to work on the device.
Steve continued to smile at Tony as they were left alone again. Tony turned to look at him, making a face.
Tony turned slowly to stare at Steve. “Uh, yeah…” he began, his expression was blank before he smiled back, “I think that’s a great idea, Rogers.”
heard, Rogers.” The statement made Steve laugh, although his expression eventually settled to express his concern for Tony.
Tony sighed before he took his time straightening up in his chair. “Steve told me that someone at the board event thought they were dating…”
Tony sat on the edge of his bed, tapping on his phone to pull up Steve’s contact profile from his favorite’s list. After talking to Bucky, he thought maybe he should wait to see if Bucky had managed to convince Steve to call him. However, as the hours dragged by, Tony could no longer wait. Now all he could think about was possibly losing Steve because he wouldn’t let him express himself in person.
Steve nodded, but kept his hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony felt him rub it gently, a move he had trouble processing after having learned that Thanos was close to deploying his weapon soon.
Steve shook his head. “Just because Synergy is at a standstill doesn’t mean that the team needs to split up. We can only learn from this and create something better.”
this is another setback, and I realize that it’s not going to plan, but we have the schematics and Anthony has to also hand over any salvageable material per the board’s request…”
Bruce rounded the console to lean against an edge. “Shuri sent me an email last night that she found some obscure notation in your dad’s original schematics that we missed the last pass…she’s not really sure what it means, though…but she’ll explain after she finishes something she was working on all night at Stark Industries.”
Maybe he was being ridiculous about the dream. Like Sam said, no one would ever know that he had dreamt about Tony or had fallen asleep in his bed. He reminded himself to get a grip and just go with the flow, let loose like Bucky had suggested.
After the project ended, Bruce went back to work on his daily tasks for the company. Tony had also hired Shuri as a fulltime Stark Industries employee. And everyone else on the team went back to work at their original positions before they joined Synergy.
“I know you didn’t want to have this party, Tony. But it’s great so far.” Steve practically whispered. He was close enough to Tony for his lab mate to hear his hushed voice.
“Okay, Tony. You caught me,” he sighed before continuing, “I did take advantage of the whole pretending to be married thing to kiss you at that mansion.” Steve turned bright red again as he confessed.
“…he’s escalating…” Loki began to explain, “…only the people closest to him would have this information…if they sent
Steve stared at Tony, not really understanding his current demeanor before he shook his head. “Is it okay if I stay for dinner at least? I wanted to see Peter before going back.” He teased awkwardly.
Sure, he had a habit of dropping the ball repeatedly when it came to relationships, and it was true that he had trouble when it came to commitment. He had believed, or at least told himself, that after his wild twenties and thirties he was finally becoming serious. Or maybe that was the point? Maybe his lack of self-awareness of how he was hurting Pepper was the reason why she finally called it quits. He did care for her, but Tony would have never stayed with someone like that if he were treated the same way.
Tony reached over to give Bruce a semi-hug with his free hand. “Banner, I’m just giving you a hard time. Where are you planning on romancing the lovely Ms. Romanov?”
Steve’s smile brightened as it widened. The last month or so had been like this between him and Tony.
Pepper inhaled deeply before answering. “You can make it work, Tony, by talking things through. I know how much you care about Steve. I can see that you two belong together…you just have to try.”
Rhodey motioned for them to follow him as he rolled his eyes. “Come on, you two. You’re going to make my head explode.”
Steve was intently listening to Fury and Natasha banter back and forth with the board member they had gathered around. He contributed to the conversation more than usual, finding himself becoming more comfortable with discussing not only the Synergy device but also his much-appreciated involvement with the team.
Tony was so thankful that the conversation easily lent toward Bruce and his relationship problems instead of his own. He thought about texting Steve as he continued to tease Bruce. He should try for a laid-back, yet professional tone. Steve seemed like the type who would appreciate that.
“…would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow night? There’s a place I’ve been meaning to try that’s over in your neck of the woods.” He looked downward at his shoes as he continued to fidget, just waiting for Steve to reject him like he had over the weekend.
“I probably would have ignored you then, Rogers.” Tony scooted closer toward Steve to wrap his arms around his waist. “I’m glad I met you now. Yeah, my past was pretty wild and I’m amazed that I came out more or less okay, but I wasn’t ready to be with someone like you…”
Tony slammed the door to his office close before throwing his work bag to the other side of the room. He looked around the office for something else to throw, until his saw in the corner of his eye a framed photograph of himself with his mother during a family vacation when he was little. Tony had found it while going through the boxes at the house out in the Hamptons. He stepped to the bookshelf and grabbed the frame. He paused for a moment as he looked at the photo before placing the frame back down on the shelf.
Tony could feel himself coming to the edge, and as he neared that edge, his emotions got the best of him again.
Steve used his thumb to stroke the inside of Tony’s hand. Tony scooted closer toward Steve, freeing his hand to hook it around the latter’s shoulders to give him a semi hug.
Tony looked back at Bruce who appeared to be thinking deeply. “Yeah, he should definitely say something…but why don’t you give him some more time?”
Colonel James Rhodes—Rhodey to those who knew him the best—was Tony’s best friend from college. Well, to be more precise, Rhodey was probably one of the few people who had lived through Tony’s wilder days and chose to stick around after. Tony was grateful for the friendship: since college, they both had helped each other out of sticky situations, with Tony’s always being the stickiest. It was nice having someone close who was understanding, but also real when it came to getting him to see clearly.
Fury shrugged, much like Bruce had done. “I made a deal with Stark. He doesn’t meddle in the government dealings and I don’t get in the way of the lab work. It keeps the peace.” He ended with a leer, crossing his arms.
The other end of the receiver went absolutely quiet as Steve waited for Tony to answer him, the tension becoming unbearable as the silence grew longer.
Natasha nodded as she looked over at Bruce who smiled back shyly before desperately looking elsewhere. The team continued to congratulate each other, except for Tony who was in the process of leaving the arena. Steve watched Tony exit, waiting a minute or two before following him.
Steve looked past Tony as he took a deep breath. He then looked directly at him, drumming up the courage to sound as sexy as possible.
“Tony, we’re close…there’s no denying that…I just want you in my life, that’s all.” Steve made sure to definitively punctuate the end of his sentence to convey his sincerity.
“Tony…” Steve tried pulling Tony down to meet him face to face but stopped as a current of pain shot through his arm. Tony laughed again as he leaned downward to meet Steve.
Sam chuckled lightly. “He doesn’t like it. But it’s still a good way to describe his stern yet encouraging moods.”
“What?” Tony looked to his side, expecting to see Bruce. He grimaced before glancing behind himself to see instead an extremely annoyed Bruce far down the hallway.
P.S. I edited some of the past chapters for clarity, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar/continuity errors!!
Steve looked surprised by Tony’s tone as Tony stood up from the desk with a heavy-laden sigh. “I’m sorry, Steve…I’m not trying to get into a fight about it either…but I’m done with Synergy. I don’t really care if the government picks it up or if Obie sells it for parts.”
Steve, without responding verbally, only smiled at him sweetly before moving a hand to caress Tony’s face. The gap between them disappeared once again as Steve resumed kissing Tony. Tony let Steve hold him as Tony felt his body practically melt in Steve's hands. He slid a hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him as close as possible. The kiss lasted for a few seconds, but Tony could have sworn it felt like ages.
Strange laughed. “Just don’t end up in my hospital again, unless you’re here to assist with the Synergy device.”
“…he said something about poor performance…” Pepper looked around the room as if someone was listening in on their conversation.
Tony waved his hands around theatrically. “Yada, yada, yada—bureaucratic nonsense—something like that.”
Obadiah looked around the room as his expression changed. He then chuckled, his whole body shaking from his witless humor.
“I’m relaunching Synergy and I want you to rejoin the team.” Tony ended with a casual shrug and grin.
Steve nodded before following Bucky out onto the balcony where a table and a few chairs were set up for their brunch.
Steve waited a second before leaning inward to kiss Tony. He felt Tony run a hand up his side until it met his neck, massaging him as they felt each other. Steve turned the two of them at an angle before gently pushing Tony down onto the bed.
Tony nodded, somewhat relieved that the government was planning to pick up Synergy despite Obadiah’s efforts.
“Wanna dance?” Steve ended the question with a cute shrug, almost mimicking the time Tony had asked him to dance at the board event.
Steve uncrossed his arms he watched Tony reposition himself underneath the robot with Peter. “You’re probably one of the smartest people I know, Tony, but sometimes it does help having another pair of eyes.”
“Tony,” Steve was looking downward at him, holding onto his arms, “I understand where you’re coming from…and I’m on your side whatever you choose to do, but we can’t let whoever is trying to sabotage us win like this.”
Steve sighed as he kept his hand in place. He glanced back at the conference room as the whole group was now huddled outside.
The employee express elevator whizzed up Stark Tower to the main Synergy labs located on the seventieth floor. Steve slightly bounced from side to side as the elevator carried him up the building. He could feel his nerves starting to get the best of him again, but he was used to calming himself when the moment called for it.
Tony and Steve barely spoke to one another as the private jet carried them from the west coast back to New York, landing in Queens at the undisclosed location Tony was storing his unmarked gadgets. They spoke even less as Tony drove them back to Stark Tower, and the tension was at an all-time high as soon as they arrived back to their lab, just in time to get a few more working hours in before calling it a day.
Steve shook his head again. He was struggling with trying to process seeing Tony again and possibly relaunching Synergy. But there was no way he could move forward with the team.
Steve barely nodded as he grabbed the tablet before handing it to Tony. He watched his lab mate scroll through some more equations on the console, before holding the tablet an inch or so above it for a few seconds. Tony then handed him the tablet.
Thanos had his daughters meet him in his office later that evening. As soon as they arrived, he was sitting at his desk watching a recording of the Synergy promotional event Steve and Tony had given in Berlin. Thanos cackled to himself as he listened; Gamora and Nebula were standing on the other side of the desk, annoyed with their father’s developing obsession with Synergy.
“Tony, nice to see you.” Sam chuckled as he looked over at Steve. Steve was absolutely mortified, but he was trying to hold it together without falling apart in front of Sam and Tony.
