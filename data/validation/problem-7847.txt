Steve shook his head, removing his hands from his face. Staring at the wall, he cleared his throat "I won't blame you, if you want to leave."
There was another family, the Kaplans. They were crying and holding Tony's hand, thanking them profusely for Steve's act of bravery. Tony had just muttered cold okays. It wasn't okay with him though. It didn't seem okay to his nine year old self that he had to lose his Papa for some strangers.
Tony waited patiently for May to walk away so he could pester the man without getting chastised. The brunet almost pounced on to the other man the second May walked away. "Hi! I'm Tony. I live across your house."
He wasn't lying. Peter adored Steve. Hell he knew that Peter loved him more than anyone except Tony. Even Rhodey. Which spoke a lot considering that the colonel secretly spoiled Peter with all of the things that Tony denied him.
Peter couldn't help but grin as Joey let out a loud peal of giggles. He lifted his son into the air, blowing another raspberry on his smooth baby belly. This time he joined Joey in laughing.
"Get it?" He asked, pulling back. Tony felt his face burn on seeing the look his lover was giving him at the moment. His clear blue eyes were full of fondness, nothing but pure unadulterated fondness..
Tony put Peter to sleep a bit later and walked back to his own room, yawning. He slipped into some comfy pajamas and stretched sleepily as he walked towards the window. He could feel the exhaustion from the day creeping up to him slowly. He started to close the window when he heard the revving of a bike. Tony glanced out in surprise to see a young blond man mount off the bike.
Squinting hard, he glanced back towards his room. The blond couldn't help but worry about Natasha seeing it. It must look like a tornado had hit his bedroom. Steve had started to pull out every single piece of clothing inside his closet trying to find a good outfit. Somehow, it felt like whatever he chose wouldn't be good enough for Tony.
"I know. Still don't understand why people find it hard to believe that you were the stern parent." Peter said, trying to clear his throat.
Barnes' family had dropped in yesterday too. His family was Becca, a college girl who looked like Bucky's female clone and Mama Barnes, an older woman who wrapped her arms around anyone who was close to her. Tony had been victim more than once, letting out strangled cries everytime she squeezed him inside her arms.
Bucky let out a silent hum before he said, "She misses you, you know…"
Sue smiled and waved his worries away quickly, "Of course it is! We kicked Wanda out years ago and this guy doesn't ever come out. He's a hermit."
This had been the main reason Tony and Peter left their tower in New York. Living with just the help and occasionally Pepper worked when Peter was young. But Tony hardly felt it would be healthy for a six-year-old to grow up without peers of his own age.
The little boy sprinted back into the hall, bouncing on his heels excitedly. "We have a swing!"
Tony was being completely truthful, Peter was in love with the book. His son had almost had a panic attack on not being able to find the book after he woke up. It was only after Tony had given it back and Peter had flipped to the end of the book that he had calmed down.
"Look." Steve pointed to the wonky writing on the piece of paper. Tony smiled at him and glanced down to see it was labelled 'MY FAMILY' like before. But now it seemed to have a few more labels.
'Ony?" The blond croaked out, his voice barely audible.
And just like that, Steve felt like somebody had punched him on the solar plexus. He chewed on the insides of his lip as Tony stared at him hopefully. He felt his chest seize in fear as he opened the car door. Letting out a shaky breath, he slid inside and clawed at the seatbelts.
strange noise his step-brother let out. Seeing the bright look on Bucky's face, Steve didn't know how to respond. Should he be happy that he was finally proud of one of his choices or should he be panicking about how sad he will make Bucky when he inevitably messes things up with Tony?
Nothing good, Tony wanted to tell her. But he didn't think it would go well with Obadiah. So, he plastered a fake smile on his face. "Tony Stark."
Tony scowled at Obie's choice of words. He knew Obie wasn't exactly the biggest fan of children but that gave him no right to talk about his son like that. Throwing the man a glare, he said, "I'm sure we can work on that. I'll have Pepper schedule more meet-greets and interviews this month."
"Sorry to keep you waiting," he muttered, slipping in his jacket.
and the yellow blob in it, sure as hell looked more like a father than a favourite uncle.
"Honey bear no…" Tony whined as They followed him around the house.
. He stretched his back out and turned to the side of his car where a tiny head had popped up. He fought back a smirk after seeing his six-year-old grin at their new home as if he had just reached Treasure Island.
"Tony. Are you there?" Natasha's calm voice finally asked him.
Peter fidgeted with the sleeve of his sweatshirt uncomfortably as he sat on the couch with Johnny. He looked up at the screen of the television and quickly ducked his head. He could feel his cheeks burn with embarrassment.
Tony took his coffee cup with both of his shaky hands and took a long gulp. He wondered if Steve would find it off-putting if he squealed like a teenage girl. It wasn't every day that beautiful academics called him brave and admirable and applauded him for one of the biggest turning points of his life.
Tony stopped grinning, replacing it with a soft mile, "Just because you couldn't handle your baggage one day doesn't mean you are a nut Steve."
He was not lying. Peter did get acquainted with Sue's little brother, Johnny last weekend when they had gone to the weekly cookout. Tony had made friends too. He had hung out with Clint Barton who lived a few houses down. The man was an ex-sniper in the army. He had come a few years back due to a medical discharge. Now, he was happily married to a high powered lawyer, Natasha Romanov. Tony had talked to her too, she was a nice woman. Even if a bit scary.
"So, Peter's birth was definitely a shock. A good one but still." He had a spoonful of his dessert and looked at Steve, who was playing with the contents of his own plate.
"He already went over to Steve's with Clint. He's excited to spend time with Steve again. They hardly got to hang out all this time," Tony told Rhodey as they walked over to Steve's house.
Tony could see that Peter had very carefully written the word
"Oh, please, I don't want to be a homewrecker." Sunset intervened immediately. Tony gave her a grateful smile.
The morning after Peter tried to wake his father up but he wouldn't move. Peter crouched down to take his pulse, confirming what he already knew. Peter didn't care to wipe the tears trailing down his cheeks as he leaned over to kiss his father on the forehead.
"Tones, would you get Steve a change of clothing?" She asked, her eyes glimmering with an emotion he would regard under the category of kindness.
Rhodey huffed out a breath dramatically but nodded. Tony smiled and planted a wet kiss on the other man's cheek. He hadn't been lying when he said the last months had been hard. Steve had been struggling with his therapy sessions and it hadn't helped that the antidepressants Dr. Leshnerr had given him were dragging him down. It pained Tony to see someone he loved struggling so hard.
Tony gave her an amused look and scooped his son into his own arms. Peter buried his face into Tony's neck and grumbled, "Wanna sleep…"
She grinned back at him nonchalantly, rising from her chair. She ran her fingers through her luscious brown curls and confided with a conspiratorial smile. "Besides I hear the Prince of Wakanda is here for the party too. I definitely want some of that."
"Hi," Tony said.
Tony almost choked on a laugh as Sunset  walked herself out of the room. He quickly decided not to judge the younger woman, Not when he had led an extremely similar lifestyle when he was her age. Shaking his head, Tony turned around to face Obadiah. He wasn't exactly surprised to see that his godfather was seething.
Tony had been too angry to speak and had restrained himself from firing his blasters and blowing the entire place up.
“You’re early,” Tony said.  “You’re not due back until tomorrow.”
“Come on Cap, you gotta admit, you’re a man of few words,” Tony said.
It was close to 2am when he knocked on Steve’s door. He took a deep breath and waited as he heard footsteps nearing the door. There was a long pause of quiet, as Steve gauged whether or not to let him in.
“Listen, I don’t know why you’re so mad at me anyway. You’re the one who’s always arguing for more autonomy. I was only doing what you would do. There’s no reason…”
“Maybe in the morning?”
For a second, Tony can see them both, four-year-old Peter hiding inside Peter’s lopsided smile, in the way his left ear still sticks out slightly. “Hey, kid.”
“Look, I just mean that it might be nice to have someone there to jump start the process a bit. Have a drink, make some small talk, and then leave you to it.”
Peter tugs at his pants again, this time raising his arms, waiting to be picked up. He’s surprisingly light in Tony’s arms, his head resting perfectly against Tony’s shoulder.
“He’s bruised and battered to hell but otherwise alive,” Sam had said. That was over three hours ago. Until then, they had been searching for Steve for 8 days. Sam and Rhody had been the ones to find him, half-naked and shivering in the dense, cold woods around Eastern Europe.
Tony strokes the side of Steve’s face, tips his head down and kisses him. It’s brief, just a slow but firm press of lips, and Steve tastes of sleep and mint toothpaste. He pulls back an inch, resting his forehead against Steve’s. Steve’s hand curls through his hair and keeps him there.
Anyone with a healthy respect for privacy would turn around at this point, but Tony stays still, trying to piece together what’s happening. Steve looks at him over his shoulder, his fingers white against the sink. “I can’t remember what happened to me” he says. “Everything is fuzzy...just bits and pieces of things. Hell, you probably know more than I do.”
“Peter, I need to talk to you about tomorrow,” he says after they’re back from watching Steve and Natasha practice hand to hand. Peter looks up from his drawing, a series of stick figures Tony can’t quite get a good look at it.
“I’m fine now,” Tony says, rubbing Peter’s back and letting him break down just a little. “I’m alright,” he whispers into the boys hair. “I’m always going to be alright.”
“You know what I mean,” Steve snapped. Even in the dark, Tony could see Steve’s eyes flash in anger.
“Yes,” Tony says. “We’ve got to make a big decision about you. About making you big again.”
They’re halfway through the dishes when the door chimes. It’s Bruce and Hope. One look at their faces tell him it isn’t good news. Bruce has always had a shit poker face but it’s the way he pauses in the doorway that Tony realizes he needs to take a seat to hear this.
“It’s OK, Tony,” Steve says, taking the package from his hand. “I’m ready.”
Tony has never doubted Steve’s resolve, and he doesn’t now.
“Fine,” Steve says, gripping the marble basin. “It’s nothing.”
“Does he remember anything at all?” Bruce walks with him after dinner, a sedate affair that Steve had skipped.
Bruce cruses under his breath.
It’s a surprise to them both when Peter jerks out of her arms. “I don’t wanna go! I’m staying with Mr. Stark!”
Eventually, Steve stirs.
“We’re gonna try again. There are three different frequencies we can use,” Bruce’s voice comes over the intercom but he sounds tense.
That’s how Steve finds them, resting on the couch as the sun hovers on the horizon, bathing the room in a warm, yellow glow. This is usually Tony’s least favorite time of day, the few moments when day turns into evening always filling him with a deep, unsettling sadness. Tonight though, the golden light drifting through the room catches against the wide array of blond and brown in Steve’s hair, makes his blue eyes a a deep, dark pool.
Resigned to his fate, Tony flopped down on the bed still in his coat as Steve moved around the room, unpacking. He hung up his suits, and Tony’s too, before kicking lightly at Tony’s legs with his foot.  It had been a long flight on the heels of an even longer day, and despite his reluctance over the sleeping arrangements, he was glad to be stationary for a bit. The fire had warmed the room nicely, and the soft yellow lights made everything feel cozy.  He stared at Steve standing above him, before holding out a hand to be helped up.
Kara gasped as Tony continued to rub his thumb along her clit, sending shivers of pleasure through her body. Finally, Steve pulled her panties all the way down and placed his mouth between her legs.
“He’s OK. He looks just fine,” Steve says, squeezing his hand.
Right, juice it is.
“Why?” Peter says, grinning. “I’m coming right back.”
“He’s alive,” Sam says, as if reading Tony’s mind. “I don’t know how but right now that’s all that matters.”
“Not many,” Steve’s gaze doesn’t waiver. “Some insomnia, residual aches and pains. Nothing serious.”
May shakes her head. ”I can’t get close to this Peter,” she says. “I don’t think I’d be able to let him go.” She smooths back Peter’s hair and gathers up her coat and bag. “Ben and I never had kids. I always wanted a baby, but not like this. Fix him, Tony. Fix him now.”
“How’s your refractory period, Rogers?,” Tony asked, resting his sticky hand against Steve’s belly. “We’re not done yet.”
“No go, huh?”
“Jesus, how do you handle these things?” Steve finds him outside on the balcony overlooking a twinkling Midtown. “They’re not so bad, but the key is that you have to maintain a steady and proper buzz the entire time,” Tony replies, lifting his glass. Steve’s expression gives away nothing but annoyance. He nods to Tony and starts to make his way back inside before changing his mind.
Peter doesn’t though, just keeps going and going until all the threats have been neutralized. Instead of the usual cheering and back slapping that accompanies the end of a successful sim, there’s a tense silence across the simulation floor. Steve snaps off his cowl and tosses his shield onto the ground, leveling Peter with his gaze. Tony holds his breath and waits for the shouting match, but there’s no reprimand. Steve just shakes his head and walks off the floor, the rest of the team following slowly in his wake.
Before the fight, me and Tony started walking to each other. I am so conflicted, I mean I love Tony and I'm still trying to get over the fact that he cheated and here I was thinking he had dropped his 'playboy' act but I was dead wrong, CLEARLY! And to think it was with his ex, I mean worst case scenario when he gets drunk is a hangover. But you know what I'm going to keep calm.
"It's fine, I'll get J. A. R. V. I. S. to wash them once he's back." He shrugged it off.
Summary:- There really is no summary to this one so let's get right down to business and all you need to know is Peter is around 6 and Tony is obviously filthy rich.
"Hey hon, where are you going?" As soon as I got there, he started undressing and- ooh, look at that ass. Oh My God, all he's wearing are boxers. Why am I freaking out, I've hit that so many times!  Hot damn though, look at that chest!
PS. Very important, please if you have any requests for one-shots, please comment or message me or anything and unless its smut or m-preg, I will be sure to write it(not comfortable with that yet)
"Don't finish them all, I wanna try one." Okay, but it's not like the only doughnut he'll ever have.
"What do you mean, I came here for a drink, I always do. I- I didn't know you were gonna-" Is he stuttering? Wow that's a first.
But for Peter its something a little more terrifying, Bath Day! Steve has already run the bath and put the bubbles in but Peter is more reluctant to go than ever. All because he's going through a phase.
"And he also has the same ringtone, the same friend..." and then he stared into my eyes, "...and the same eyes!" Shit, he may be on to me. Oh no, now he's going for the hat, damn it and its off. Great.
"Yes. Thanks." Again, it really wasn't that much better and that water tasted like liquid gold to me. Ahh.
"Just in case you see something you like."
"Sure, which ones?" I dig into the bag again.
"Hey Clint."
"Okay", Tony says paying for the toy and looking around for me. He sees nothing so he starts walking towards the snack stands with the guide and Peter.
Oh, here we are. The doors open to the dining room and heads all turn to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Lion King!"
"J, the recipe!" I was out of it.
Oh who am I kidding, it's Clint, he'll probably bet him to make out with a rando.
I haven't written in some time, like compared to what I used to, and I actually don't know why, so expect a few more this week if I can find time. Its just been a bit hectic because I'm moving and the packing and everything, it's exhausting. So, I will be posting a few more this week, I have some good ideas, just wait.
It was a weird walk here. Everyone kept looking at me. I assumed it was because  I'm Captain America but some people had almost disgusted looks on their faces while most were just amused. I'm back, yay. Oh and Tony's here. Double yay. Oh my god, is he cooking? He must be either really bored, hungry or has an itch to burn the Tower down.
"This place is safe for children, right?" Tony asked wrapping an arm around Peter, as if it would keep him safe from all harm.
He let out a deep sigh, "It doesn't matter what I think,
"Aren't you gonna call Peter?"  Rhodey asked as Tony pressed the pie into his hands to pull on his own jacket.
"Peter Benjamin Stark," The boy rasped out, his voice hoarse from crying.
Tony grinned with almost the same pride he showed when Steve praised his son. "Well, hop in."
Padding his way through the silent hall, Tony felt shivers run through his spine. The house was silent but he could sense it was the dangerous kind. Just like the silence before a storm.
Steve let out an annoyed groan and turned to glance at Tony. He felt his mouth go dry on seeing his date, Tony looked like a fucking model for Vogue in his perfectly tailored two-piece suit. Steve gulped hard and pulled his lips into a trembling smile, trying to return Tony's warm one.
"I love you too, Peter Pan…"
"Let's get out before the ghost gets us!" Johnny said quickly, his words lacking the usual bravado.
"Yeah, I'm sure you two will have a very good time." Sue smiled ruffling Peter's messy mop of brown hair.
"Pardon." Obie blinked at him.
The man offered them a hasty smile and walked off. Tony glanced up to Natasha nervously. The redhead was currently busy unbuttoning her friend's shirt raised an eyebrow at him. Tony glared at her. She just rolled her eyes, her green eyes twinkling.
Peter rubbed his hands on Harry's back and muttered, "It will be okay, Harry."
Stepping inside Tony couldn't help but feel guilty for looking around and wasting time, after sneaking a glimpse at Steve. The man's shirt which was soiled with bile before now seemed to be covered in sweat and what Tony could only guess were hus tears.
"Baseball is dumb!" Peter crossed his arms on his chest.
Tony nodded and settled down beside Steve. He glanced over again to see that Steve had his face buried in his hands. Atleast, none of them smelled like barf anymore and Tony counted that as a win. He slowly slid over to Steve and opened his mouth to speak but the blond spoke first. "I won't blame you."
But seeing the small smile Natasha offered, Tony couldn't help but feel he had helped the blond. Tony sat back silently as the redhead crouched down to Steve, speaking to him in soft whispers as she stroked his hair. He was surprised to see that his boyfriend was even responding.
Steve closed his eyes, sucking in the air with great difficulty. He nodded, "Yeah."
. That boy loves you too much, I can't do anything about Peter spending time with you. Not until somebody invents a Peter repellent."
Steve let out a rough chuckle as he scratched his beard. He knew that Bucky hated his beard, even though Natasha, Sharon and for some reason his student, Gwen had said that he looked good with one. Bucky argued that if he didn't need a beard in more than twenty years, he didn't understand why Steve felt the need now.
"Steve!" He cried out, rushing over to the man who was crumpled out on the floor. He tried to heave the blond up. But Steve seemed to be intent on pushing back, letting out noises that reminded Tony of a wounded animal.
The brunet was pleased to see that all the pain had vanished from Steve's face, replaced by a bright smile as he listened to him talk.
Tony cleared his throat as he nodded, "Peter told me what happened, yesterday. I'm--."
Tony sighed, "I know, Obie."
A voice, carrying an uncanny resemblance to Steve's late wife, told him pitifully.
The gang let out impressed howls and talked among themselves. A few moments later another boy asked, "Have you seen any of the superheroes?"
"Riri's sister chewed up her assignment," Bucky told him as he walked into his office.
"Hey Sharon." He muttered moving on. He threw his jacket on the kitchen chair and started to move around the hall. It seemed like Sam's family had dropped in earlier. His sister Sarah was chatting with Natasha in the backyard.
"I have to say, I'm a big fan of how you turned Stark Industries around," Steve told him as he fiddled with the rim of his coffee cup.
Peter scrunched his nose, thinking it over slowly, and gave him a small nod before wiggling out of his arms. Tony laughed and let him dash inside their new house. The genius followed his son closely but paused for a moment, his hand placed on the doorknob. He swallowed dryly, surveying the cozy suburban homes. Tony could hope that they would be able to survive in the brand new environment. Shaking the thoughts out and commanding himself to think more positively, Tony headed into the house.
Tony tapped his fingers against the phone, imagining every worse situation associated with Steve. Cursing under his breath, the brunet typed in a message asking him to call him when he got the chance. Something clawed inside his chest on seeing that his text had not even been delivered to the blond. Before he could contemplate his feelings about the situation anymore Obadiah burst inside, announcing his presence loudly.
He pulled the drawer hard but it wouldn't budge. Cursing under his breath, he tried again to see that there was a paper stuck inside. Tony almost tore the paper into half as he took it out. He let out a breath feeling his chest fill with warmth on seeing the content inside the crumpled piece of paper. Steve had drawn Peter and him and quite beautifully at that. Tony ran his fingers through the drawing, feeling a surge of affection towards the blond. He quickly pocketed the drawing and went out of the room after grabbing a soft woollen.
Probably no one care but I was listening to the; The Fault in our Stars album in Spotify when writing. If you wanna... It's sparkly y'all ✨
"On it, Boss," Happy chuckled taking a quick left.
Steve turned to him with the remnants of the smile he had given the old lady and Tony felt sucker-punched. He had known before that his neighbour was an aesthetically pleasing man. But seeing him up close, Tony couldn't help but decide which part of him was most beautiful, the periwinkle blue eyes, sharp lines of his jaw or the sweet dimple on his cheek.
The other man slammed his fist on the desk and snarled, "I don't know if you understand-"
Peter gifted him for the response with a million watt smile and ran off to find his unfinished drawing.
Tony pushed out a small breath and massaged his temples, "Happy, I'm gonna die without coffee."
Leaning back against the cushioned seat, He glanced at the other person occupying the table. Tony's eyebrows flicked up on seeing the book that hid the man's face.
"Come on Stark, come over and join us in a rousing game of monopoly!" Clint crowed from the couch. Becca rolled her eyes beside him. Tony ignored them both and tried to find his son.
"Huh?"
Buckly let out another voice closely resembling one of a dying cat. Steve ignored him and grabbed Natasha into a quick hug before he could go get dressed.
"Why are you doing this to yourself?" Bucky snapped at him, his voice leaching with anger and resignation.
"Poor kid," he muttered, going back to his own work.
Steve smiled at how earnest the boy's words were. He rubbed his back softly and asked "What's your name, son?"
"Hi," Steve offered him a wobbly smile. Tony dropped down next to him, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist. He buried his face on the blond's shoulder, peppering his chin with kisses.
"I had a great time, Steve." Tony muttered, wrapping a strong hand around his arms.
"He isn't like a… criminal or anything, right?" Because that would mean Tony would be moving out. He was going to move right out, it didn't matter if he would have to drive back to Manhattan with his lousy back. He had moved to this vanilla suburb with sweater-wearing dads so his son could have a safe childhood. If his neighbour was a criminal it would break the whole deal.
Peter let out a small sniffle. Tony was right. Even he knew it. Steve made anything and everything happen for Peter. Even when he was being unreasonable. That had made it twice as hard for Peter to come in terms with the fact that his Papa had died.
"Let's go meet them, Daddy! Let's go!" The boy tugged on his arm, making him stumble towards the front door. Tony let out a hearty laugh, his chest filling with warmth on seeing Peter's enthusiasm.
"Peter, Tony's asking for you…" Mary Jane muttered as she walked into the hall. Peter let out a small groan and heaved himself up. He offered Joey to the redhead, only after placing a kiss on the crown of his head.
"I love you so much, daddy…"  Peter's chest lurched painfully with emotions.
"So, why don't you think a bit about that?" He asked with an unsympathetic smile before he closed the door to the office, leaving a cowering Obadiah Stane behind.
He nodded and offered an awkward salute as she let herself and Steve out of the room. Tony glanced around the hall quickly wondering where the hell Steve's room was. The times he had been over both he and Steve were drunk off their asses. The rest of the time they had spent together was mostly out. They were both comfortable with it considering they had agreed to take their relationship slow. It had been a while since either one of them had had a real relationship.
"I'll see you next week, Steve."
"No. She gave me the chewed up papers," Bucky shook his head in exasperation and dropped in the pitiful wad of papers on his desk.
Steve guffawed looking over to Bucky. The brunet let out an annoyed snarl, "I can't believe after years of celibacy, you chose a joker."
Tony cleared his throat loudly attempting to catch either one of their attention. Obie continued pacing around the room as if hadn't heard him but Pepper was more polite, she stopped reading the files and gave him a small smile.
"Well, normally I would jump at an offer as delectable as this one--" He paused to wink at Sunset. The woman smiled shyly, rolling her eyes in exasperation-- "But considering that I'm in an extremely satisfying relationship with a beautiful man, it will be a hard no from me."
"Ring, Daddy! Ring!" Peter jumped up and down. Tony nodded and pressed the doorbell. He waited patiently as a jittery Peter vibrated beside him. He wrapped his arm around his son and pressed the doorbell again. Tony could feel Peter's shoulder hunch under his arm as nobody opened the door.
Tony glared at Obie. He knew that the man was far from being happy about his relationship with Steve. But this felt like the other man was trying to sabotage their relationship. Which man would be happy to find their lover's name along with some woman in dirty tabloids. Tony might not be the best at relationships but he knew better than to treat his boyfriend like a dirty secret.
Natasha and Steve didn't answer, the brunet sitting on the loveseat did. "I've had worse." He turned to Steve who was slumped over Natasha, he seemed too tired to even lift a finger.
"I'm sorry."
"Dad?"
Tony followed him inside quickly, giving Steve an easy smile before igniting the engine. Steve gave the genius shaky smiles, quick nods and hums when he chattered away happily.
The spacious two-story colonial was already straightened up with their things stacked into the respective places. A few hundred bucks could make a huge difference with moving crews, he had learned quickly.
“They don’t like it when you do that.”  Tony jumped a little at the sound of Peter’s voice behind him.  He picked up the place card anyway and swapped it for the one he was holding in his hand.
“Good,” Tony says, pulling away finally. “Good.”
“Fuck,” he curses, his own dick jumping at the feel of it. Steve arches back into him, moans as Tony frees him from the damp cloth and takes him in his hand. He’s so hard it must be painful and Tony doesn’t try to draw it out or make it last any longer than it should. He strokes Steve a few times, pays attention to way Steve’s rocking into his hand, the way his fingers are crushing the pillow.
“FRIDAY, black out shades at 90%”
“Are you working in the lab today?” Peter asks as Bruce and the others start to leave.
“You know, I have bad dreams too,” Steve says.
“Like you’re marking your territory. Like Steve is a thing that belongs only to you.”
“Fuck,” Steve gasps, his entire body lighting up with pleasure.
“I’m not supposed to wake anyone up in the morning,” he says in a bad attempt at a whisper. “My mom says I have to play quietly so the adults can sleep.”
“Bruce?” Tony stands next to him, eyes finally taking in the child. He has to clear his vision more than once, not totally believing his eyes.
“Am I going into the tunnel?”
In the mornings, Steve and Tony do their own awkward dance, negotiating space and boundaries that somehow seem more important in the light of day.  Neither of them are good sleepers, but Steve usually wakes first, slipping out from under Tony’s arm before he can object.  He goes for a run and showers, coming out of the bathroom just as Tony’s waking up.
He thinks about the room Peter usually sleeps in when he’s here, all the way at the other end of the residence wing. “How about you bunk with me tonight?” Tony says. “That way I can make sure you don’t run off and break into the fridge for more juice.”
“I think he tried to tell me,” Tony says finally, picking up their conversation from earlier. He gets up, begins to pace, reliving the moment in his head. “‘
“Yeah,” Peter says, already falling back asleep.
“Peter!” May’s rushing through the door and Tony has to put his hands on his knees for a second. He’s shaking badly, adrenaline and relief making him light headed.
“Aren’t you supposed to be at a dinner or something?” Peter was sprawled across his bed in jeans and an oversize Stark Industries sweatshirt, playing a video game. He looked unsurprised to see him.
“You gotta talk to me, Pete,” Tony pleads. “That Leviathan almost flattened you. You were inches away from getting crushed. That’s not an acceptable risk.”
“Why did what bother me?”
“I take it the Quantum Tunnel simulation finished running?” He takes the seat across Bruce, wishing he’d bothered to change out of his pajamas before having this conversation.
“Hmm.” Steve nods in affirmation, eyes still glassy and weak. His arms are on top of the blankets, dotted with round, symmetrical puncture wounds. The clinical nature of the marks unsettle Tony even more. He’s about to leave, let Sam have his turn, when Steve looks up at him, uncertain.
Tony shakes his head. “Not that he’s told me.”
Steve puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I’m gonna miss you, buddy. We all are.” he says.
It’s late by the time he finally heads back to his room and punches in the code without thinking. The door has slid shut behind him before he registers Steve, sitting naked at the edge of his bed, silhouetted in the warm glow of a bedside lamp.
“Funny,” he mumbled as Sam laughed. As compensation for the slight, he grabbed a fork and began to pick at the fruit and eggs on Steve’s plate.
She turns to Tony, panicked tears in her eyes. “Would you do it?”
He wakes to early morning light filtering into the room. The drapes haven’t been shut and streaks of pale gold cross the bed, creating little windows of light across Steve’s bare back. With no one to judge him for doing so, Tony lets himself stare at Steve’s profile, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest. In this light, Steve’s hair is more golden than brown, his lashes stark against his pale skin. Unable to help himself he grazes the back of his hand against Steve’s cheek, feeling the scratchy coarseness of his beard. Usually a light sleeper, Steve doesn’t even stir. He trails light finger tips across Steve’s back, marveling at the muscled smoothness. The serum heals fast enough that there are no scars from his ordeal in the barn, no bodily proof of the horror he suffered through. It’s with a pang of deep sadness that Tony realizes that Steve’s body heals quickly, so his spirit has no choice but to play along, whether it wants to or not.
“Wait,” Tony starts to protest, to tell them he has no idea how to take care of a kid, when Peter starts kicking his legs against his side.
“How’s he doing?” Tony catches Bruce off to the side, as the others pour a few drinks to celebrate.
“Steve had to carry you out to the clearing, did you know that? When we got you to the jet, his hands, his suit...everything was just covered.”
There were smothered giggles and a yelp of laughter from Peter. At his left, Steve let out a low sigh that was either disappointment or resignation or both.
Tony shrugs. “Better than ‘
Tony lies down next to him, rubbing his back gently. “It was just a dream Peter,” he whispers, his own heart hammering in sympathy. “Nothing’s going to hurt you. I’m right here. You’re alright.” Tony kisses the side of his face, murmuring reassurances into Peter’s ear until his grip relaxes just the slightest.
“I know it’s not exactly bringing down a Latvian spy or anything, but my day was pretty good,” Peter finished at last.  A few minutes later, Sam rapped on the door. He was holding, Tony was pleased to see, a very large pizza.
“Want me to help?” he says quietly. “I can, if you want me to.”
He tries to talk to Peter, but calls go unanswered, texts left on read. It’s some comfort that Peter’s still hanging around the compound, making the long trek from Queens pretty much daily, but worry licks at his insides none the less.  He’s not Peter’s father, not even an uncle, but the kid means more to him than the world. The distance between them sits like lead in his stomach.
It’s fine though, because it’s a face he’s happy to see.
“OK.”
He nods, and squeezes Steve hand again, tries to make his smile look a little less sad. Logically, he gets it. It’s hard seeing people you love dangle between life and death, he wouldn’t wish it on anyone.  Still, it doesn’t ease the sudden, new ache in his chest.
“That’s not....you don’t have to.” Even in the dim bathroom light, Tony can see the flush spread across his chest.
Fix him. But fix him how?
Before Sam could continue, Steve pushed his plate towards Tony and laid his hands on the table. There was always a little flick in his eyes, a twitch of his jaw, that indicated it was time to get serious. Their MO here was to divide and conquer, the four of them hitting up as many hearings and committee meetings as they could. Policy was made at these things, and they couldn’t afford to not have a voice at the table. Their roles were clear. Natasha and Sam would lead the charm offensive, Tony would toe the UN line of cooperation and oversight, while Steve, for once, played agitator, pushing for more freedom and autonomy.
Steve bit his lip but nodded. He snapped his head up his head upon hearing the
He smiled nervously, feeling his heart skip a beat as he gazed at the other man. Tony's lips were swollen from kissing, his coffee brown eyes even darker with lust.
He heaved himself up and was about to get out when his eyes got hooked on the bookshelf near him. He padded his way over and ran his chubby fingers through the spine of the books, he felt his eyes go wide in awe. They had even more books than Peter did. He pulled back a book and gazed at its cover. It was beautiful with many beautiful paintings adorning the pages. As Peter thumbed through the pages he could feel the book clawing at his attention. Forgetting all about the ball, Harry, and the fact that he was in a stranger's house, Peter plopped down on the floor and slowly started to read through the pages. He loved everything about it. Peter was almost halfway through the first few pages when a pair of feet stopped in front of him. Peter restrained the urge to keep on reading and glanced up.
"Basically, yes. We just walk around hand in hand. Flirt a little, maybe share a kiss or two and get a column in a handful of gossip magazines," Sunset supplied helpfully.
Steve froze for a moment on realizing that the boy was now staring at him. His brown eyes wide as he sucked on his thumb. Despite himself, Steve flashed a grin at the kid. The small brunet's eyes widened for a moment before he smiled and gave him a shy wave.
"I'll make sure of that, Dr. Leshnerr" Natasha replied.
Steve patted down the navy blue button down she had picked out for him and glanced at her for a second. The redhead gave him a fond eye roll. "Stop worrying, the blue brings out your eyes and those pants bring out something else."
"I do hope I was anything like the man you needed…" The old man chuckled, running his slender fingers through Peter's brown locks of hair.
Obie let out a bark of laughter looking from him to Sunset. Tony pursed his lips, finding the situation extremely
Peter grinned at that, he had seen heroes. He had seen Captain America, Iron-Man, Spider-Man, and even Black Widow when he had gone to Disneyland last summer. They were all really nice too, Iron Man had even offered him candy.
Steve rolled his eyes, tipping his head back against the chair. He should have seen it was a trap. It wasn't like he didn't miss Mama Barnes. He missed her like a part of him. But he didn't have the heart to go over anymore. Not when Becca and her kids were over. The last thing he wanted to do was snap at the kids or something as bad. He no longer had the energy to play Fun Uncle Steve anymore.
Tony nodded and rubbed his hand along Steve's cold neck. He flinched as Steve let out a pathetic whine and threw up all over the floor and himself. Tony tried not to scrunch his nose at the horrible smell of bile. Surprisingly it was a much easier task than trying to look at Steve who was still lying crumpled against him.
Peter nodded meekly.
This got another loud set of cries and howls. Peter beamed happily as all of them declared him to be one of the cooler kids. Johnny punched him on the shoulder in pride. Peter just smiled; he was happy to have friends now. Maybe they would even play with him at school.
Steve felt a shy smile grow on his lips on finding that Tony was gazing at him, his eyes crinkling fondly.
Great. Fantastic. He moved away from a safe tower where they were walking distance from the police precinct to a place filled with crazies. And the way Sue talked, this Wanda woman wasn't anything to be cracked up about either.
That was the moment it dawned on Peter that he was not inside his room. The little boy let out a cry and dropped the book. The man in front of him crouched down so he could see his face. It was the man he had waved at yesterday.
Tony rolled his eyes as Obie paced around the office like a maniac. He glanced away from the man and looked at his assistant, Pepper. She was somehow ignoring the older man and poring over the flies spread out on the table.
It had taken a few months for the meds and therapy to kick in. Tony could already see the slight differences. When he wasn't tired out Steve smiled more easily and he wasn't always wound tight like he would explode any given minute. The only problem was that since Steve started to go to his classes again they hardly had any time to spend together.
"What are we gonna do?" Harry asked, chewing on his lips.
Steve snapped his head up and gave Tony a grateful smile. To Tony's surprise, the blond was an associate professor at NYU's department of literature. At the time he went to college, the professors had been balding, pot bellied men who wore tweed jackets, not young men who could bench press a truck. Anyways, it wasn't a wonder that Steve got the job at such a young age anyway. As they talked through various topics Tony realised that the man was more eloquent and knowledgeable than most of the
"I'm guessing you don't enjoy baseball?" He asked with a kind smile.
He felt a light laugh escape from his throat on seeing Peter's face light up. He winked at the kid and gently plucked the book out of his hand. He thumbed through the pages slowly.
He failed to hold back a snicker as the man entered his porch and started to shuffle for his keys. He couldn't blame Sue for blushing about the suburban hermit, he thought as he slipped into his bed. From what Tony could see the man looked like he was sculpted by Michelangelo himself.
"We discussed this, you'll be able to bathe alone when you're seven and not before." Steve says this while putting Peter on his lap to wash his front. Peter simply grunts but doesn't give in and after trying and trying and trying, Steve is fed up with his son and lets him do what he wants. Of course being the overprotective father though, he decides to sit in the bathroom to keep an eye on him.
"Yeah, why?"
"Tony calm down." I had to cut in before he blew his head off.
Everyone chuckled before going to the living room and watching all the footage of Steve and laughing away. The only down side was Peter no longer had a friend which Steve probably noticed so...
"Wonderful! I am most excited to meet infant Peter. I has been far too long since I sa-"
I couldn't let him go to a club and risk losing him, I mean he wouldn't be losing much but my luck was through the roof when I got him and I ain't gonna let him go. That means 'redirecting' the sluts who wanna grind up on him. Thankfully Steve isn't the only one without their significant other so Clint will probably stop him if he's about to do something stupid. Right?
"Like what you see, Capsicle?" He looked really smug. So I decided to mess with him.
Since Tony was feeling cooped up which I have to say was kinda ironic considering he's in his lab like 24/7, we decided to go to the beach so it would just be us three, Clint and Pietro(You know I had to hit you with some Hawksilver at some point). I packed lunch in one of these cute little picnic baskets which Tony bought twenty of when I said I liked them. And now I'm off to change Peter into a beach onesie. He has this really cute red one that I think would be perfect for the occasion. I also grab a onesie, striped blue and white. You get it? Cause then together we'd be wearing Captain America colors. Anyway, I loaded the car and the five of us drove off. What I didn't know however, is that the car was merely taking us to a jet which was obviously flying us to Australia cause Tony is way too over the top not to.
"Cheat on you." I cut him off. It wasn't a question, cause I knew that was the right answer.
"N- no.. N-- n- no."
"I feel violated." Clint said softly holding his chest while Pietro tried comforting him. Such a bunch of drama queens.
I thought about it a lot and there's not a lot of places Steve would go except one, Central Perk(if you get this reference, we should be friends). So I went to the roof, suited up and flew off. I planned my apology countless times and I've spoken in front of millions of spectators but to this day, this is the most nervous I have been. It didn't take long to arrive but not wanting to draw attention, I left the suit about a block away and walked into the coffee shop. I saw Steve sitting in a corner reading a book and walked over to him. Steve always loved reading, it was his way of catching up, well that and movies but mostly books. He was quite engrossed in his book so he didn't notice me until I said,
"Hey." He lightly pecks me on the cheek.
"Out running." I didn't want to start an argument even when I knew I would win but I didn't because I'm the bigger man, both figuratively and literally.
"Wow your biceps are bigger in real life." She said giggling. Now she's gonna go for the kill.
"J, whatever Steve was making, get me the recipe and dictate." That was the only way.
"A week?!" I was too overtaken to notice anything else. I would have to deal for two children for a week?!
"Loki, could I please have him?" Maybe if he does, Tony will also start liking him or in the least, start not minding him.
"Borrow if you must, or rent but don't worry it will never leave your person and you can watch me throughout my usage." He tried sounding innocent for Peter but I caught the hints he was dropping.
Yep, walking, walking, walking, there he is. Oh and there's Clint. I need to talk to him!
Summary:- This is an AU after Civil War but there was no homecoming cause the Avengers took care of the Vulture. And the Civil War happened cause Tony cheated on Steve(as well as the accords thing) and Peter was left out of the fight. Also, Bucky didn't kill Tony's parents.
perched behind his desk, glasses on and the blue screen light illuminating his facial features: he wasn't ready.
"Did you just say first-timer!?" Oh My God!! He's never eaten a doughnut! What is his life, he hasn't lived!! How did I not know this?! After, I if course threw another minor tantrum about how his life isn't complete. He had very good replies but still....it's doughnuts! Then, I get Peter a 'Custard Cream' and old Steve an 'Old Fashion' and we all sat down on the couch and ate.
Word Count:- 1068
"That's weird anyway, about the child..."
"Of course not, dumbo." What the hell?! Oh thank god it's just Nat. Oh and she has a phone with a torch.
I lift the blanket of his head and jump back startled. That was NOT Peter, it was a random baby or was it? I couldn't quite place my finger on it but I sort of recognised him. But no, I'm still super freaked, I mean what is a random baby doing in my bed? Did Steve adopt another baby and not tell me?!
"He seemed OK, I'll be dropping you of to meet him at Stark Tower this Saturday at least until we get the custody part sorted out."
"Papa? Why is daddy on floor? Is he ok?"
Soon, Steve came back and saw we were still eating. So he grabbed the boxes, all of them and yanked them away from us.
"Hey hon!" I was excited, I hadn't seen him today, so as soon as I saw him, I encompassed him into a tight hug.
"Hi." I whisper in his ear. "Whatcha doing?"
"We're doing the copy Tony challenge, he's winning." What?
"No, I was hungry"
"Oh hey, my boyfriend has the same shirt in which case I'm sorry because that means it's expensive."
"Pete, what were you thinking?" I didn't want to sound to harsh so I didn't scream. I understand where his rage was coming from, but revenge? That was not how we raised him. Bucky managed to get the pumpkin off my head because it was stuck and I had got cleaned up.
"J, get Steve down here. No hell get everyone down here ASAP and tell Nat to get a bottle of warm milk while she's at it" At least if everyone's there I make a big scene while firing Steve.
While worst case scenarios started going through my mind, even Peter stopped crying at the noise. So I climb over Peter who was sleeping in the middle of the bed to see that Tony had woken up- probably due to the noise-and hit is head hard on the wooden underside of the bed. I giggle and gently kiss Tony on his head where he got hurt and help him up. I know I'm not supposed to find this funny with the crying and whatnot but it was pretty darn hilarious. Everything was going fine but there was something to couldn't get my head around. So I look at Peter, "Why did you cry, did you get another nightmare?"
Breakfast was good, and very frustrating. I've learnt not to deal with a hungry Tony. And usually it's a lot worse, I have no idea why he isn't flipping a table right now. Maybe he actually feels something: guilt. I didn't think it was possible or that this day would ever come but I think he feels guilty of raising his voice. This is a good day.
Summary:- Okay, Loki comes to visit, Peter is about two and I just wanna say this isn't how I see Loki, like I don't see him as evil, mostly because I have friends who are crushing hard on him akx I'm sorry, but the picture was staring me in the face and I couldn't resist.
"Are you crazy?!" I lift up one of the helmets to examine the paint.
So just in case you were the most oblivious person in the world, Tony loves donuts. Okay no, love is an understatement. I honestly feel like he spends most of his time wondering whether he'd pick me or donuts if he had to. So yeah, love wouldn't begin to scrape the surface of his feelings and emotions towards donuts and no perverts, I'm not talking about donut sex! And it's not one those cases like, 'yeah I'll eat one if I have the chance', no he will go out of his way to ensure he has a donut for breakfast, tea time, after lunch and dinner as dessert. His favorite is chocolate.
"J. A. R. V. I. S?! Do you still work?" I guess not.
"Wokay." That the first thing I've heard him say. He had a funny accent.
"Yep." That was his response? Yep? "Come here, I'll get it." Get what? What is he gonna get? I'm kinda scared. He comes over and reaches over to my hair and starts pressing on my head, almost looking for something. I crouch so that its easier for him. Wait, okay I think he found what he was looking for because I kinda heard a click. He hums in approval. Yep he definitely found something. There's another click, and another one and another one. Okay, let's just settle at there are a lot. After he was done, he pulled at something and all at once my head was like fifty times lighter.
"You'll be okay, dad. You'll be with him now…" He whispered into the man's ears.
"Hey, love…" He greeted with a sad smile, walking inside the little girl's room.
Steve chuckled and wiped Peter's tears away with the sleeve of his sweater. He ruffled the boy's hair and asked, "Do you like to read Peter Benjamin Stark?"
Peter shrugged in disbelief and glanced at the others. He didn't believe in ghosts, and neither did his daddy. His father had told him those were just lies to scare little boys like him.
"Daddy!" Tony stopped short and turned upon hearing Peter.
"Oh, really. You aren't hiding yourself, then?" The brunet snapped, his voice raging with anger.
Harry sobbed, "My daddy's gonna kill me!"
Peter's heart clenched on seeing the very first picture. It was a picture from the day that he had been taken home from the boy's home. He still remembered how scared he was of seeing Steve and Tony. It didn't help that one of them was
Bucky grinned like a
She wanted him to check on Steve? Tony felt his nerves start to fry again. What was wrong with Steve? If something had happened to his boyfriend, shouldn't Tony have known before Natasha? Tony felt his heart halt for a moment thinking about the unanswered messages.
He let out a low chuckle on reading the text Tony had sent him.
Tony smiled at his son warmly hoping to god that the neighborhood kids were not bullies. It would be very easy for Peter to get bullied considering he was small for his age and had no idea how to play around with others. He had grown up in a penthouse, he played outside only once or twice a month when his cousins came home.
Tony glanced up on hearing a small sniffle. He let out an empathetic noise and wrapped his arms around the younger man. He rubbed Steve's back, feeling a little surprised that the man had anymore tears left to cry.
Steve silently stared at him, his eyebrows furrowed as if he wasn't trying to solve a particularly difficult problem.
Tony took a shaky breath as he walked up the lawn of the house opposite them. For all that he had whined about his son's pitiful social skills, Tony could be just as bad. He made stupid jokes when he got nervous and that managed to either affront people or scare them away from him.
Steve felt his own widen as he looked at it closely. Poor Riri seemed to have done all the work. He could catch most of the complicated equations and very little of the diagrams.
Steve let out a loud snort. He had heard more than a few of those excuses from his students too. It made no sense to him. If they had worked hard enough to get into NYU, they could most definitely continue working hard enough to submit their assignments before the deadline.
Steve gave him another grateful smile, "Thank you, Tony." He leaned back against his chair for a moment before saying, "But can we just pretend that I know how to shut my trap and have a normal first date?"
"Did your parents not warn you about going into others' houses without permission?" He asked him in a measured voice.
Steve shuddered, taking a moment to compose himself. He gave Tony a sad smile. "It's not your fault. Besides, I'm the idiot who brought it up on our first date."
"Daddy buys me books whenever he goes out. I've never seen this book."
Probably, one of the NYU nerds. Nice arms though, Tony thought to himself with a smirk.
Steve rubbed at his temple tiredly and stared at the stack of papers to be marked. In hindsight, taking on four classes might have been biting off more than he could chew off. But he had nothing else to do. If he wasn't doing work, he was either lounging on his couch or cleaning his house. He would much rather read through his student's papers.
Peter huffed out in indignation as they walked out. "It was you."
Steve let out another sniffle, Tony could feel his shirt slowly get wet with his tears. He simply buried his nose in Steve's hair and held him as close as he could.
Steve cleared his throat, "It's just so unfair. Why her? Why not me? It just--." Steve let out a pained groan, his face bitter with pain.
Tony let out a soft hum, letting Steve know that he had his full attention.
He glanced away from his phone to see that Peter was already sitting next to him, carefully placing the unfinished drawing of Spider-Man on the table.
"Shut up! You were the best dad I could ever ask for..." Peter threw himself at the older brunet. He was ugly crying now. Sobbing against his father's frail chest.
Peter smiled and both of them slowly fell into a comfortable veil of silence. It was when they reached the end of the album that Peter's breath hitched. The last picture. They had taken it on a picnic to the park. The three of them shining with happiness. It was a really adorable picture where his Papa had his arms wrapped around a younger Tony and a ten year old Peter. It was the final picture they had taken as the whole family.
"She was a surprise too. The most pleasant surprise that Peggy and I ever had," Steve continued, a ghost of a smile haunting his lips.
Grinning to himself like an utter loon, he texted the man back.
Cheshire cat. "Sod off, I was just getting to know Tony."
Steve eyed him carefully and let out a sneer, "Really?"
Steve smiled to himself, feeling his heart flutter. It felt lighthearted to someone who wasn't his pseudo-big brother or Sam.
Steve gave him a sparkling smile and started to gather his stuff to move away from the table. Tony bit his lip, feeling a twinge of sadness as he watched the man walk away. To his surprise, Steve turned around halfway and gave him a small wave. Tony grinned and returned him the lamest thumbs up in the universe.
Joey started gurgling excitedly again and Peter assumed that at the moment his son was pleased with getting raspberries blown on his belly.
Tony let out a chuckle on seeing a familiar drawing. He should have known that Peter was working on his gift for Steve when he refused to show him what he was working on. He smiled on recognising a tall blond figure and brown haired man who he could only assume was himself. They were both holding a tiny figure between them.
"Excuse me?" Tony blurted out in confusion.
"You, me and Peter are a unit. You hear?" He chided Steve in a mock stern voice. He smiled when Steve's arms which were wound around his waist became tighter.
Steve almost felt his head spin with the other man's scent. Tony smelled like vanilla, coffee, and for some amazing reason, grease. It was one of the most addictive scents Steve had ever smelled.
Steve rolled his eyes as he pushed his best friend off the table. He could remember it clearly even now. It was one of the few situations when he saw Mama Barnes panicking. She was torn between making sure her daughter was okay after eating the cheap acrylic paint and consoling an eight-year-old Steve who had burst into tears.
"Well, we try." He let out a chuckle and turned to Obadiah, raising a questioning eyebrow at him. He was confused why he was sitting in his office making small talk to Sunset Bain. It wasn't like they would be benefiting from a business alliance. On the list of businesses trying to get hooked up with Stark Industries, Baintronics was dead last.
He had been almost on the verge of a panic attack inside his closet. Thankfully, Natasha and Bucky had decided to drop in. Bucky had pulled him out of the room and deposited him on the couch, while Natasha took it upon herself to choose his outfit for the date.
Bucky laughed, "Of course, you won't! What I mean is, you even put in the effort to trim your depression beard for this man."
Tony felt the faint annoyance he had been feeling all week, poke it's head up once again. Obie had been pushing him all week, trying to get him to push out something new for Stark Industries. Tony glanced up to look at the older man, he shrugged in surprise on seeing that he was accompanied by a stranger.
"Just, let me help you!" Tony admonished, wrapping his fingers around Steve's upper arm. Tony flinched and almost jumped back when his boyfriend's hands were travelling up his chest until they were clutching at the collar of his shirt with a vice-like grip. Tony waited nervously as Steve's misty blue eyes roamed around the room before coming back to him. "No, no! No, you don't understand! You have to get them out!"
Steve typed back in his
"Then, you would be happy to let me spend time with Peter again, right?" Steve asked his voice sarcastic but Tony could see the plain fear he was trying to hide behind the clear blue eyes.
"Why not? Didn't Barnes give you one?" Rhodey snapped back in annoyance.
Peter held back a grimace. He kind of wanted to say no. He really had to be in a particular mood to see the old pictures they had of Papa. He was especially vulnerable as he had to make Tony understand that his Papa was gone last week.
"Yeah! Captain America let me hold his shield," he told them excitedly.
"The guy who lives there is kind of an...um…" Sue stopped talking to glance at Peter who was gaping at both of them. She huffed out a laugh and told Tony, "Poo-poo person?"
"Steve?" He asked slowly, after watching the blond stare at the candle in front of them with an odd look in his eyes.
Tony nodded looking over to the house she had pointed to. The house was constructed the same way almost all the other houses had been done. Uniqueness was a feature that suburban homes lacked, Tony had noted quickly.
The blond leaned over to snatch his phone, he felt his chest tighten as he saw that he had a few texts from Tony. Bracing himself for a polite rejection, he opened the chat thread. Steve felt a small smile tug at the corner of his lips on reading the texts.
Tony let out a small scowl on hearing the other man's words, he quickly snatched and admonished him fondly. "Hey, none of that! You know you can tell me anything and everything."
Tony had no idea what he could do. Especially when Steve was glaring tiredly at the floor as if he was trying to avoid the fact that Tony was crouched down beside him. Thankfully, Bucky and Natasha dropped in pretty quickly. Both of their eyes went wide in shock seeing Tony sitting on the end of the stairs, while Steve curled up on himself near a pool of his own vomit.
The blonde beamed "Agent Coulson told us you'll be moving in today, Mr. Stark. I'm Susan Storm, I live two houses to your left."
"Then we should go introduce ourselves, Daddy!" Peter cried out happily, his face brightening at the prospect of new friends.
"So, you got a hot date?" Bucky asked, eying him warily.
Steve winced as his eyes watered, adjusting to the unfamiliar material. It had been years since he had worn contacts instead of his glasses, so it wasn't a big surprise that his eyes were disturbed.
Tony nearly preened at the compliment. He took pride in raising his son as a polite and kind boy. He gave Steve a small smile, "He is, and thank you for the book too. Peter loves it."
"And if you promise me, you'll accept others' help like a good boy. I'll be more than happy too. Elated, actually."
Steve let out a hum of approval as he sat down next to Peter. "Maybe I'll give it to you…"
Tony glanced up at Steve and let out a choked laugh on seeing the look on the blond's eyes. It had been such a long time since somebody who wasn't his family had looked at him with so much want and affection, that Tony felt his throat burn with emotions. Unable to find words, Tony jerked his head and the brunet was gifted for his effort by the sweetest smile from his date.
"It's okay, kid. Just tell your father the truth," Johnny tried to console the younger boy, but it was to no avail. Harry was still staring at the ground, his lips trembling as fat tears rolled down his eyes.
Steve heaved himself up and stared at the phone, making sure he hadn't misread Tony's text. It wasn't like Steve hadn't noticed the approving looks Tony sent his way. But he hadn't thought the genius would ever act up on it.
"He's nine," Sue cleared up quickly, to Tony's relief.
She giggled sweetly. "Aww, he's shy…"
"I'll be out in a moment," he told him and ducked inside.
"I'm delighted to hear that! Peter deserves for people to know how wonderful he is," Pepper replied earnestly, her eyes sparkling with fondness.
Peter was a city boy through and through; he had grown up with indoor toys and playhouses. He was hardly acquainted with the fun that was roughing it out in the sun. Tony used to be the same, he could still remember how excited he had been on seeing the vast backyard surrounding Rhodey's house when he was a little boy.
Tony glanced up to see Sharon Carter grinning at him from beside the staircase. The tall blonde had rounded on him yesterday to give him a pseudo shovel talk, Steve's friends were extremely loyal to him. She had told him in less than kind words that if he hurt her brother in law, she would torture him to death in an extremely painful way. She didn't seem like she was kidding either.
The blond winced on finding the offending object. He must have dropped the picture when he had been storming through the room to find an outfit for his date. Putting the picture of his late family back on the nightstand, he fell back into his bed. Steve buried his face into a pillow, squeezing his eyes shut.
Tony grimaced on seeing the painful look that quickly passed through Steve's face as his hand idly moved to his chest. He could almost hear the warning sirens, telling him to change the subject.
He almost felt the urge to cry on seeing the big old fashioned flex with Uncle Ben's painted in the once bright scarlet paint. He climbed out of the car and almost made a run for the cafe. The brunet let out a satisfied groan as the scent of slow roasted coffee beans and baked goodies tickled his nostrils.
Tony looks at me sarcastically and sighs, "OK, I've had enough of babysitting you two for one day, let's head back to the hotel and maybe buy a new suitcase on the way"
I feel like Tony is deliberately trying to piss me off. No joke, like I mean I love him, but he has a specific skill set and when he tries things not in that set, he tends to, how do I put it lightly, threaten life in the Tri-State Area. Not always but this has happened before, that story will be for another day(Tell me if you want me to write that). Like the last time, everyone but Tony and Bruce were on a mission including me and Tony tried painting. Let's just say, we got home to a neon tower, literally. The walls were electric orange and pink and all the fluorescents and it was just a lot. Another time, he tried archery and 'borrowed' Clint's arrows, wanna know what happened? Scott, Bruce and Stephen ended up in the hospital! So, it's a little more than terrifying when Tony tries something new.
"No, that's what I succeeded in doing, he just thinks he's talking to fans." Damn, that was smart, Steve would never deliberately do something like that.
"WTF, you went to Disneyland without us!?" Blurted Clint and Pietro.
Summary:- I'll give it to you straight. Tony. Cooking. You should know by now what's gonna happen.
"Let's get freaky, Cap O'Lantern."
"Ooh me too, I found some paints back there earlier, that's something we could do!" Shit. Even Nat snapped her head at me, amused with the situation, she found out a couple months ago. What can you do with two super assassins in the house.
"Hey Cap, how are you?" The person I'm hugging is Bruce. Well that's just great. I pull away blushing my cheeks off.
"Do you like it?" I say holding up my canvas so that Steve can see." And at this point I'm betting myself on whether he's gonna say the same thing he said the last hundred times or not.
"Daddy said he'll stay calm if you give him the secret weapon!" Are you kidding me.
"WHAT!" Tony for the first time in his life looked scared, really scared.
a house in a good neighbourhood for ultimate fun, emphasis on bought. Anyway, the entire team moved in there for a few days. Clint, Natasha, Bruce, Tony, Peter and I were gonna go trick or treating with an impromptu tag along by Thor while the rest of the Avengers stayed back.
"Without me?" I can't see him but I can tell he's pouting that cute pout of his.
Peter looks at him before hugging him again tightly. Steve lets out a smile which he hadn't done for a very long time before ruffling his hair.
"We're not mad, just make sure it won't happen again." He nodded in shame. That meant he felt bad which meant I was doing this right. Even though what h did was wrong, it would have been funny and well deserved, oh well.
"Yo Steve, where the alcohol at?! Tony?"
"Maybe."
"How dare you! You are both idiots and that would be an understatement!" Her laughing expression soon drained and was replaced with irritation and anger. Nonetheless, she did technically deserve it and Tony didn't swear so I couldn't be mad. In addition, her brat also drenched Peter so, yeah. But while I had come to terms with it, she wasn't having any of it. Now I am a calm, peaceful, patient and understanding person and I could take all the insults in the world, but what I can't tolerate is when people insult my loved ones, let alone hurt them. So when she raised her hand at Tony, I was pissed. She was about to slap him right across the face, when I of course had to step in. I caught her hand mid air, it was like something out of a soap opera where dramatic music would be playing in the background right about now. The expression she held was the definition of priceless.
"Of course." He gently hands Peter over. Yay, I always knew he was good-ish.
"What's your secret weapon, Poppy?" Uhhh....crap.

"I am a Frost Giant! My kind have killed many and most children scream at the mere thought of one!" He actually seems really nice. Also, his face is turning blue and some black stuff is coming out of him. He looks really cool. I like blue.
Today is so peaceful. I like today. Which reminds me, where's Steve? I don't think he went on the mission with the others
I flipped through the album with Pops(Steve) and it was so cute. It was filled with baby pictures of me and all sorts of stuff. Pops was on the verge of crying, he didn't show it but I could tell. I knew he missed Dad but I'm honestly kinda scared he may never forgive him, not that think what Dad did was a good thing but they're meant to be together.
It felt like he truly cared.
"Awww", me and Peter say in harmony.
Daddy was beyond confused at this point.
"Oh, sure. Luke, I'll text you." I need to tell J. A. R. V. I. S. to make that number 'accidentally' disappear. We walk back while he tells me what he did with Clint and Pietro.
"Its serious this time, and Cap isn't gonna back down."
"I gotta take a call, do you mind watching Peter for a few?"
We reached Disneyland and checked in into a two bedroom suite. Then we decided to just get some dinner and start bright and early at Disneyland in the morning. I'm actually super excited, ever since I unfroze and Clint forced me to watch Disney movies, I have dying to go there. We had dinner at some super posh place who had extremely exuberant prices with so many zeroes after them... But Tony as usual spared no expense.
Yay, another one bites the dust! I'm happy cause this is the longest one I've written and I'm very proud. Peace out.

"So what is it?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Another one!! I saw this picture and basically fell in love with it so I decided, it's been long since I wrote a jealousy one, oh wait no, I write one last weekend. Anyway, enjoy!!
I walked out of the elevator into the living room in my PJs.
So anyway, this month, the rest of the team were all on a mission leaving only me and Tony in tower. This would be fun. It was about 5am. Shit, I rushed and ran out the door for my run. Usually I leave way earlier, I'll probably have to cut down my route, damn it! Thankfully, the morning was amazing so that made up for it.
"No, let me help you." He sat me down again after a got up to leave and started cleaning off the glass and beer.
"Sure, well come on everyone else is inside." Finish the awkward moment.
Trick or treating was loads of fun. It hadn't changed a lot but the costume choices definitely took a turn, in my day, when trick or treating had only just started, people just dressed up as professions but now, there was a much bigger variety like TV stars, animated characters and I'm proud to say, even Avengers. There were quite a few Captain Americas and there were as cute as hell. Thankfully we weren't recognised. We didn't want to create a commotion on Halloween. There were so many cute kids, and the atmosphere was buzzing with excitement. We hit every house on the street and we were on our last. We opened the door to a very grumpy looking lady. I assumed it was part of her character so I was polite nonetheless.
Again, he didn't say anything, but he got up, and walked toward me rather quickly and pulled me into a hug. I stood diagonally to accompany my face resting in the crook of his shoulder. His rubbed soothing circles on my back while held on to him for dear life. "I am so sorry." And for the first time after what felt like a long time, it felt like he truly meant his words.
"NO!" That was- shit. You didn't need to know that. Anyway usually I'd be up for Steve in the shower, maybe even join him but my starvation is growing by the second. You know what?! F*¢* Steve! Figuratively and literally. I stomp to the kitchen with the utmost confidence which is when I realise I can't cook. Darn it.
"I like you Tony."
"I was scared tha- that... that you would wou-"
"Hello miss." She did exactly the opposite of what I expected. She was incredibly rude, she rolled her eyes and snorted. It was funny how those two simple actions bothered me to my core. Then, out of nowhere, a kid can out from behind her, he was dressed in a Star Wars stormtrooper costume and looked quite cute. But as I've learnt, never judge a book by its cover. He pulls a gun from beside the doorframe and squirts Peter. Not once, not twice but until he and his costume are drenched. The worst part was the woman didn't do anything. On the contrary, she laughed! What disrespectful brats. I would never say it out loud but they were. Tony however felt differently.
After a surprisingly not that long flight, we reached Perth and Oh My God, it was gorgeous. The sea was like glass, well glass with waves, but still so beautiful. I carried Peter and all our stuff with Pietro and took them to an empty spot to set up. We got the lot including a beach umbrella, beach toys and all sorts of things. Then, Tony followed sporting a very, very short pair of hot rod red trunks. He sat down next to me in the sand.
"No buts, trust me one last time, please I won't let you down!"
"Yeah yeah, whatever. What's up with Cap's shirts?" I went straight to the point. Wait, why is he smirking?
After a lot, and I mean a lot of squirming, Peter was finally sitting in the tub with Steve who was gently scrubbing Peter's back with a loofah. Yep, Steve was having a great time, but the frown on Peter's face could make Mickey Mouse crumble.
"Sure." Great. We get to the nearest store and in case you're wondering, it was ten minutes away and this is without superspeed. So, we get there soon enough and walk straight to the pastry aisle. I'll be drop-dead honest with you,  I've never had a doughnut so I have no idea what to buy. It's just that back then, I didn't think doughnuts were much of a priority and then the Captain America and the War and just no time to buy anything and now, between Loki and Thanos, it's been pretty hectic. So yeah, I haven't tasted a doughnut but Pete has so maybe he'll help me.
"Its called a secret for a reason Pete but I think you could try talking to Daddy and he might just listen." Topic changing works every time. Peter gets of my lap on the couch and walks to the kitchen where Tony had retreated to, probably for a cup of coffee so that he'd have more energy to scream at us, or rather me.
"Are you sure, cause it looks like it!" Now I was mad. I headed over to it and picked it up. I placed it in front of him. He knew he was in for it and soon the entire Tower was.
"What the f–" but I was quickly cut of by a frowning Steve who was wobbling with the weight of the hammer.
"Are you kidding me, Steve has been at it for like five hours. Usually by now, Tony has him calmed down and naked!"
"Hey Tony." He looks at me and smiles before going back to his painting. That smile made me go weak in the knees. He's so pretty! It isn't fair!
"This thing is AWESOME!!!" I said holding up the Platinum card.
"I love you." I add hoping last night wasn't a dream. Please, please, please, please.
"I was talking to Peter about the store." I said it clear but his smile didn't decrease in any sense. "So, wanna come Pete?" I emphasized the last word.
Summary:- Let's go to the beach because why not. And also because I found this really cute picture and I really love it so I'm doing a beach scene. Here we go. Also, contrary to what the title says, this is NOT a smut!!
We reach home and see the rest of the team sitting on the couch, watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S, eating pizza and they barely take any notice as we walk in and say hi. So I go unpack but Steve takes all the toys he bought and shows them off to the team.
"Tony, what are you doing here?" That was stupid, considering I know exactly what he's doing here.
"How is it?" I swear I'd rather he lied than tell me he hated it because doughnut-loving is essential(doughnut loving is eating doughnuts, not whatever your dirty mind conceived).
Daddy was acting very weird today. Papa and everyone else were happy because Uncle Thor came to visit but Daddy seemed more upset than usual. So he took me to his lab and gave me a toy while he fixed something. It was really funny. It kept saying funny words and noises but I can only care about one thing for so long and I got bored but Daddy fell asleep. Maybe I should go find Papa. I would wake Daddy up but Pops says he doesn't sleep enough and needs all the rest he can get. So I walk out of the lab and into the room where the TV is. It's empty. Maybe Pops is in his room? Maybe I should just look for Aunt Nat. I was about to walk out when a voice spoke which is weird cause there wasn't anyone there so I turned around.
"D– Daddy's replacing me!!!"
"Nice T-shirt." It was suave and exactly what I was going for.
"Is that my shield?" This was the quietest I've spoken yet buy he must've known I was mad cause his eyes widened and head snapped at me.
"Hi." I heard an oh too familiar voice call out. Shit shit shit shit.
"Of course I do." I won, surprise.
"Are you gonna be in here all night?" I was gonna try and ease him into the question.

"The eagle but I know its a bird."
I bring out an ice pack, wrap it in a cloth napkin, then hand it to Tony. I then dig through the fridge for anything to give Peter and end up coming out with peanut butter and strawberry jam. I quickly fix Peter a PBJ and he eats it after which I tuck him and Tony in. Finally I was done and I couldn't help but wonder why I was the responsible one. Oh right, I'm married to Tony Stark.
"All right, pick one", said Tony holding up a mickey mouse soft toy in one hand and the lion king one in the other.
"LANGUAGE!!!" The entire team screams at them.
I got out of my shower and went down to the kitchen to make lunch. I figured that since Tony had a late breakfast, he wouldn't mind lunch a little late. I got out of the elevator and entered the kitchen an- what the hell!?! Shit. Just to brief it up for you, Tony was on fire, so were the curtains and half the fricking kitchen!!!
"Hi. Oh and thanks for the gift, I really like it. When did Peter call you?"
"Boop."
Summary:- Halloween Special! And obviously it's a Superfamily and well trick or treating. But I'm not doing the thing where they go as themselves because that's a bit typical.
Painting is actually quite fun. We should do it more.
"What? Ew no! I don't even check them they're only for emergencies! And yes Steve in the shower is an emergency and he must always be monitored" I cried out.
"Yep not gonna happen again!"
"I was hungry." He shrugs it off. I knew it was one of the three and he hardly ever has an itch to burn the Tower down, so technically, I guessed it.
The baby looked at Daddy with his big blue eyes, then looked at me and back at him. He had eyes exactly like Pops and that's why I liked him, he reminded me of Poppy.
"Are you okay?!" I ran up to Tony as I relieved from the initial shock and came back to reality.
"We've been in the pool for an hour! I'm done, I have to go find Pete!" You know what, hell with them. I climb out and just grab a towel. Once I get to the elevator, I push the button. Apparently, you can talk to the ceiling but I don't get the point. Actually if we're being honest, there is no point, it's just making everyone lazier. And weirdly enough, I fee like the elevator is moving faster. Huh. Anyway, I reach the living room only to find Loki lying on the couch with his knees propped up and Peter in his hands. Oh good, no using ceiling man to find him.
"Where's Pietro?" It's unusual he isn't here.
"Steve." He dragged his voice a little, probably trying to evoke pity, wasn't going to work. "It's just that I-" I put my hand up signalling him to stop. I had enough. This wasn't the first time we had to cancel plans for work and it wouldn't be the last.
"Good." He knew this was a big deal for me so I knew he wouldn't say no, but he actually sounded genuine so yay. But I'm glad that was the first one he tried because I don't think he would've like one with too many toppings, even being a sweet tooth. We ate and ate and then soon Steve stopped but me and Peter kept eating.
"Let's play a game!" I already knew what we were gonna end up doing and I also knew Tony wasn't gonna like it. Slyness coming through.
"Yes you do Pete plus it'll be over before you know it" says a semi nude Steve wearing nothing but navy blue boxers with little white stars on them.
"Yeah, I do, wanna know why? Cause we've been married for FOUR YEARS!!! And I thought I had taken out the 'playboy' side of you but I was CLEARLY MISTAKEN! And if that wasn't enough, you had to screw Strange, your ex. You know what, I'm just realizing that I actually trusted you? You know what this was all my fault."
"Hey, you still have the pumpkin head?" Tony came up to me in the jet back home.

"Having fun?" Both heads turn my way as I walk closer to them.
"Praise the Lord!!" This time it was me who stumbled back. Well wouldn't you?!!? I had hair until like my belly button and the whole thing looked like a ga pride flag!!!! There is not a colour in this world that isn't in my hair right now! I'm not even kidding.
"I love you." What?! Did he just say I love you? Do he mean it or was he trying to make me feel better. Oh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap.
"No, I'm fine." Giving him my best Southern impression.
Summary:- Peter wasn't adopted, he was a surrogate of the merged sperms of Tony and Steve. So naturally he inherits a lot from them including their nightmares.
"Sure, I'll get the ball." I put my hand on Steve's shoulder and spin him around.
"Hey J, is everyone here?"
"Ooh, I have an idea!!" I said excitedly. Now my idea may have been a little extravagant but as I say, if you've got money, flaunt it.
He immediately looked up and sighed. God, now I'm dying, those damn blue eyes get me every time it's almost like they can physically pierce my soul.
The rest of the Avengers poured out of the house at the noise but I was too busy running downstairs to see. I ran straight to the front door to see everyone surrounding Pops, you couldn't see his head, it was kinda creepy but also really funny. Dad was busy laughing and taking pictures. As soon as I was noticed, all eyes were on me, the presumed culprit as the laughter died down a notch.
"Hey Capsicle." I was trying to sound sweet but I was so nervous.
"How about catch?" My suggestion is going to be accepted. It has to be.
"Yeah Tones?"
"I guess we're gonna have to entertain ourselves some other way." He adds. And no he isn't talking about sex. I think. Is he? Knowing Tony, it might be.
"Very well sir, Mr Banner is on his way and will arrive in 21.6 seconds at the speed he is travelling."
"Tony!" I had to interrupt him. "What are you actually doing here?"
Ahh! Drawing. It just makes me feel so at peace, not like I was frozen in the ice for over six decades. And it's a great way to pass time, and if I'm being honest, I don't think I'm that bad. Tony doesn't know because he'd probably wanna do something like buy an art gallery for me but I like how it is now, I have a few paintings here and there in cafes and whatnot. Right as I was saying, it really is a great way to pass time when Tony is tinkering away. An-
I walked back and Steve was already in bed by the time I walked in so I climbed in with him. We talked for a while but he said he wasn't in the mood for *clears throat* so I got closer and whispered seductively...
Steve returned home to Peter after a week in Germany. He had been staying with Ned, but he was just dropped back off at home and he had been waiting so long but of course he knew what was going on with his parents. And he couldn't imagine life without them both.
Usually when we celebrated in the Tower, we had simpler costumes but this time, we decided to go all out. I was a werewolf, Tony a vampire and Pete was a cute little zombie, even though Tony wanted to make him a mini Iron Man. I was on board with it....until he made a working, flying, shooting prototype for him called Mini Fe. Nevertheless, it was a great name. Anyway, that was when I had to put my foot down so he became a zombie, a very cute one at that. Apart from that, Thor came as Superman, whoever that is and Clint and Nat became Harry and Hermione. Bruce went with Hulk hands and an uncanny voice to match.
"Do you need help?" It was actually more of a statement than a question because I was going to help him either way.
"And do you come to bed after that?" My arms had moved up and were crossed over my chest. I thought it would be more intimidating having an offensive stance. He again opened his mouth to say something but shut it at the loss of words and counter arguments. "Exactly."
So Tony returns to his call but while pacing past the bathroom door and occasionally glancing at Peter and smiling. But after going back and forth for a while, while taking his occasional glance inside the bathroom, he sees no one inside the tub.
"Stop acting like your 'sorry's matter. I don't need them, You don't have to say sorry to me, I just want, no need you to come up to bed and eat dinner with me and all the small things. Because believe it or not, I would love you more if I got to see you once in a while without having to bring you food and coffee to your lab. I miss the old Tony. The Tony that used to organise picnics in the park for dates which I cherished more than any expensive restaurant, the Tony that made me a hand-made photo album for Valentine's Day as opposed to a store bought card and a plastic rose. I don't need big grand gestures, I just want to know you've put thought into your present rather than just list it to the end of your priorities. What happened to him?" He said nothing, just looking at me straight in the eyes for the first time. I was on the verge of breaking down to be honest. My sobs started hitching in my throat, my eyes welled with unshed tears and my arms were used for the sole purpose of drying them.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What the f*¢*!?!!!" What the hell. Why is he shouting. What is wrong with him. He literally stumbled back at the sight of me. Wait! Is my haircut bad? Oh no, I knew I needed a mirror! Okay? Now he's laughing, maybe my haircut is funny? That's not a good think but its better than being bad so I'm cool.
"I wanted to keep an eye on you." If it wasn't for my super hearing, there is no way I would've gotten that.
I reached out and boop him. That always works on Daddy. Suddenly his black octopus arms go back in and his face goes back to normal. Yay! Maybe I fixed him! That really does work! But then the man walks closer and picks me up.
"Yessss! Peter go pack a bag"
"Still talking and make breakfast!" Okay, I don't wanna start a fight but I do not like that tone.
"Cap! You're making the wrong choice, we need to be kept in check!"
Suddenly everything went black and all I could see was the glimmering of light on the elder wand and the figure of Voldemort edging towards me. Then I saw a green flashing light, "Avada Kedavra!!" And I woke up in my racecar bed sweating through my PJs. At this point, anything would be scary to me, you could show me a pencil and I would imagine it killing someone
"So-"
"Steve, look it's not that. I just work until like three in the morning."
"Pervert!" Pietro cried out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yet all you do is stare! Why?!" Oh no. He asked me a question. What do I say? Ummmmmm.......
"Later, where's Steve?"
"Did you know how much money was on this thing? Neither do I!! It just says infinity!!! And just look at this awesome stuff I got Peter!" Steve answers himself
"What the F-word?!!!!!" There were Iron Man helmets everywhere each painted with a cartoon character. What is wrong with this guy.
"Of course Capsicle" says Tony as he sees Steve for red as a cherry.
They disappear into the forest and I make my way to Steve.
Today's Friday and the Avengers are having a pretty chill day. Bruce is teaching Thor how to work a cell phone, Nat is watching a movie and has blasted the volume to try and drown out the moans of Clint and Pietro's make out sesh taking place next to her and Tony had been on business calls in his bedroom all morning.
"3:00am. Can't sleep?" What is she talking about.
"Are you that brave, child of Midgard? Or are you too stupid to feel fear?" Huh. Okay he's using big words like Daddy. Usually when that happens, Pops makes him stop and then Daddy says they go boop in the bedroom. That's what Dad always says.
"Thanks J." Okay cool, so he's back and I just realised I'm hungry. You know what, I'm gonna try this cooking thing, it sounds interesting and Steve seems to like it a lot. Quick Pasta it is! Oh the elevators here.
It's lunch. WHERE THE HELL IS STEVE!! I'm starving! Maybe he left food in the kitchen? No I already checked the kitchen. Wow, I'm talking to myself, this is spectacular. Anyway just out of optimism which I don't have but still, I'm going to check the kitchen again. Sarcasm yay. I walk up to the kitchen and wow, what a surprise it's empty! But this time there's raw food laid out. That means he came and prepped. Which means he should be somewhere around here.
At least I got away from painting for a bit. I mean I love him and all but I liked it when painting was just my thing. Hopefully when the power comes back, he'll grow out of it. Eh, might as well go check on him. Ugh why are there so many stairs!? Ah finally. What the F*¢*!!!!!
"Hey Pete!" They said almost in perfect synchronisation but they're eyes glued on the television screen watching what looked like a documentary of what happened in Sokovia. But I'm sure they missed him just as much as I did. Me and Peter had a great time, after he finished his homework, we watched a movie but fell asleep through half of it, then played monopoly with the team and when I was time for him to go home, I walked him down waiting for Steve so I could make my peace offering. Steve came after about a minute or so and handed Peter a helmet. Peter got on the bike and they were about to leave which is when I stopped him,
"I do NOT do that."
"No, you have to tell me what we're doing." I need to know something.
The entire team burst into laughter yet still amazed by what had just happened.
"You forgot you were taking care of a child, our child!?!" I felt really stupid and ashamed and embarrassed.
"Weeell, I was planning on going out with Sam and all." Please please please. Tony looked really unsure but he knew he couldn't stop me so he forced a smile and went along with it.
Word Count:-  1411
"I'm sorry." He had said it countless times and I would be a terrible person to not forgive him.
"STEVE!?" Steve walked out of their bedroom still not knowing what happened. But he wasn't too worried considering he's quite uses to Tony screaming. *wink wink*
"I didn't realise when I left to find you." I was trying to not create a scene but Steve obviously didn't care and even with how softly I spoke, his super hearing picked up anything and everything.

"So why don't you fly on back with your cute little hammer and bring him down so he can change Stevie back!"
I be dishin' these one shots out like DJ Khaled shoots out 'Another one's. Another one. And that makes a personal best at three this weekend. Also, why is he so hot?!
It was such a boring day at the Tower today and unfortunately since Thor would rather stay an Avenger, I'm being crowned in a week! Not saying I would'nt love being king, and bossing people around but it's soo much responsibility. And I have to leave for Asgard with Thor tomorrow to handle the preparations. So, I decided to make my last day count as I probably wouldn't be back here for a while. PS. Don't tell anyone but I kinda still have my scepter... Sshhhh!! Thanos is gonna be pissed.
"I knew ittt!!!"

"Dad! It's that mean kid and his mother!" I looked to where he was pointing and sure enough there he was, trick or treating. Me and Tony had moved on from the incident, but we didn't think Nat as so we ran down because if Peter could see them, you could be damn sure Natasha could too.
"Spiced up the food yesterday, yes! It was bland!" Tony cut in. I need to know what he was talking about.
After it was over, he tucked me in but a little while after I could hear the growl of his motorcycle before it faded into the distance. I called Dad up and told him how the night went and asked if Pops was at the tower where I thought he would be after looking through the album and willing to accept Dad's apology like Dad had planned. But he wasn't which is when I started panicking but Dad told me to calm down and said he would take care of it so I hung up and went to sleep. No I didn't, I facetimed MJ. No one goes to sleep at 10:00pm. Pfft.
Of all days Thor could have brought his asshole of a brother, he chooses the week Peter doesn't have school. He could've brought him any other time when he wouldn't be here for half the day but noooo, it had to be now. Oh look, they're here and Thor again destroyed my lawn. I swear that guy had no regard for lawn maintenance.
